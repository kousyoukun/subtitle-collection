1
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:27,787
雷 你要去哪里?
<i>Ray, where are you going?</i>

2
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,951
回来睡觉
<i>Come back to bed.</i>

3
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:00,932
小心点 你这小可怜...
Watch it, you miserable little...

4
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:34,127
昆妮!
Queenie!

5
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:39,460
早 瓦特!
'Morning, Walter!

6
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:44,764
小乖乖 他们的草坪需要养分

11
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:45,858
早 中尉
Good morning, Lieutenant.

12
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:47,156
伦斯菲太太
Mrs Rumsfield.

13
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,737
嗨 瑞奇

15
00:05:58,214 --> 00:05:59,775
伦斯菲先生 小心...
Oh, Mr Rumsfield, be careful. Queenie...

16
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:04,718
该死的
Goddam it. 

17
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:07,841
瓦特
Walter. Walter!

18
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:11,559
- 瓦特! - 我真爱那老兄 
<i>- Walter! - I love that dude.</i>

19
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:14,051
- 瓦特! - 马克! 
- Walter! Walter! - Mark!

20
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:18,641
你起来干嘛?
What are you doing up?

21
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:23,396
瓦特的狗又在伦斯菲的草坪上大便了
Walter's dog just took a dump on Rumsfield's lawn again.

22
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:25,896
很好
Good, honey.

23
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:27,900
糟老头 我知道你在里面
I know you're in there, old man!

24
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:31,242
- 邻居听得到了 - 你给我听好
- Honey, honey, the neighbours. - Listen up, mister.

25
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:36,071
你那只会叫的老鼠这次是最后一次在我的草坪上大便
That piece of scum, barking rat of yours has just taken his last dump on my lawn!

27
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:41,410
我再发现一次 我就要把它的屁股缝起来
I find one more... just one... I'm gonna catch him and staple his ass shut!

28
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:45,916
- 我现在就动手 - 亲爱的 别这样 
- I'm gonna do it right now. - No, no, no! Honey, don't.

29
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,501
我们回家吧
<i>Come on. Let's go home.</i>

30
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:54,928
亲爱的 我们应该搬家
<i>Hey, honey, I think we should move.</i>

31
00:06:58,188 --> 00:07:01,604
对面是个军火贩子而那边住着一个疯子
We got an arms dealer across the street and a crazy person down it.

32
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:03,601
他们没事就吵个没完
All they do is fight.

33
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:05,935
够甜吗?
Is this sweet enough?

34
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:08,437
隔壁新搬来的人姓什么? 
Now these new next-door neighbours... What is their name?

35
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:10,607
- 柯罗佩? - 嗯
- The Klopeks? - Mm-hmm.

36
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,282
- 那是斯拉夫的名字吗? - 不知道
- Is that a Slavic name? - I don't know.

37
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,115
他们已经搬来一个月了 你想他们会整理庭院吗?
They've been here a month. Think they're gonna do something about their yard?

38
00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:24,962
你还要吃吗?
Are you gonna eat any of this?

39
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:29,958
不 我的胃又在痛了
Oh, no. I got that thing with my stomach again.

40
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:32,838
不知道昨晚那里又在搞什么鬼
I wonder what was going on over there last night.

41
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:36,298
- 我就知道会这样 - 什么?
- I knew this was gonna happen. - What?

42
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:39,890
- 没事 - 你知道会发生什么事?
- Nothing. - What did you know was going to happen?

43
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:41,887
已经开始了
It's started already. Look at you.

44
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,972
你准备就这样坐着发呆一星期
You're gonna sit around all week doing nothing...

45
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:48,644
回去上班时感觉只会比现在更糟
get bored out of your mind and go back to work worse than you are now.

46
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:50,645
我才不会
No, I'm not.

47
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:54,901
求求你 让我们离开家吧 开去湖边休息一下
Please, let's pack up the car and go to the lake. Just get away and rest.

48
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:58,824
看看你 大清早起来看狗大便
You should see yourself. You were up at dawn watching a dog poop.

49
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,154
你把去湖边叫做休息吗?
You call going up to the lake resting?

50
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:04,332
在假日的车潮中开四个小时的车
It is four hours of driving on the tollway in holiday traffic...

51
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,624
就为了去某间潮湿的小屋
to sit in some dank, wet cabin...

52
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:10,124
然后等着隔壁的大头喝醉 从楼梯跌下去
and wait for that neighbour with the enormous head to get drunk and fall down.

54
00:08:10,214 --> 00:08:13,334
他得了水脑症 你不应该这样取笑他
He's a hydrocephalic. I don't think that you should make fun of him.

55
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,833
亲爱的 那可不是我心目中的休息
Honey, that's not my idea of restful.

56
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,178
待在家里 什么也不做 这才叫休息
This is restful: Hanging around the house, just being lazy.

57
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,515
我就要待在家里
That's what I want to do. I just wanna... hang around.

58
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,511
什么也不做 听听球赛
Be lazy, listen to the ball game...

59
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,474
喝个两百瓶啤酒
and drink a couple hundred beers.

60
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:30,020
偶尔在户外抽根雪茄
<i>Smoke an occasional cigar... outside.</i>

61
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:33,192
我会修理后院的烤肉架
I'll fix the barbecue in the backyard. I'll do that.

62
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,027
卡罗 这正是我想要的
This is what I need, Carol. I need... this.

63
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:41,113
等着瞧 一周之后我就会脱胎换骨
And at the end of the week, I'll be a brand new human being.

64
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:43,444
反正这是你的休假
It's your vacation.

65
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,505
【文森】

65
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:12,935
嘘! 安静点
Shh! Quiet.

66
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:27,078
阿特拿着枪
<i>Art's got a gun.</i>

67
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:31,656
阿特!
Art!

68
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,451
雷 你们在吃饭吗?
<i>Hey, hi, Ray. Are you guys eatin' in there?</i>

69
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:38,500
你知道苏珊对她的喂鸟器很讲究挑剔
You know how Suzette is about her bird feeder.

70
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,666
这些乌鸦不知道从哪里跑出来
These crows start showing up out of nowhere.

71
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,668
她一直念着要我把它们赶走
She's all over my back to get rid of 'em.

72
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:45,003
她说 乌鸦太大了 用不了喂食器
"The crows are too big for the bird feeder," she says.

73
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:47,670
- 我不记得以前看过乌鸦 - 坏得很
- I don't remember seeing crows around before. - Oh, big bastards too.

74
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:50,173
所以我才拿着枪 准备射个几只
That's why I got the gun. I'm gonna pop a few.

75
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:53,185
你怎么不跟苏珊去她妈妈家?
Why didn't you go with Suzette to her mother's?

76
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:57,518
嘿 我在这里这里吃饭 你能想像我和她们俩单独相处一星期吗?
Hey, I'm eating here. Can you imagine me and the two of them alone for a week?

77
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:59,684
我宁愿嚼碎玻璃
I'd rather chew broken glass.

78
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:04,190
这是单身汉的黄金假期啊
Uh-uh, this is gonna be a big week for the bachelor kid.

79
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:06,274
文森
<i>Vince.</i>

80
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,858
文森
<i>Vince.</i>

81
00:10:08,953 --> 00:10:10,909
雷 你怎么没去上班?
How come you're not at work, Ray?

82
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:14,281
- 我请了一星期的假 - 一星期的休假?
- I took the week off. - A week off?

83
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:16,865
真好 你们打算去湖边吗?
That's great. Are you guys going to the lake or something?

84
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,202
- 不 后院 - 后院?
- No, the backyard. - Backyard?

85
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:21,703
我只想待在家里休息
I just want to hang around the house and relax.

86
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:25,713
休息? 看看你们隔壁的怪胎 祝你好运
Relax? Good luck with those maniacs you got living next door.

87
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:28,376
- 你有见过柯罗佩一家人吗? - 没有
- Have you met the Klopeks yet? - No.

88
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:31,222
我没见过 这条街上没人见过
No, I haven't. Nobody on the block has.

89
00:10:31,307 --> 00:10:35,719
可是我和卖房子给他们的那个女经纪人谈过
But I did talk to the real estate broad that sold them the place.

90
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:39,643
据说他们上一栋房子被烧了
Apparently, their last house only burnt to the ground.

91
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:42,223
- 真的吗? - 是啊
- Really? - Yep.

92
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:46,861
燃烧的恐怖地狱
A hideous, raging inferno.

93
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:50,071
来自地狱的芳邻
Neighbours from hell.

94
00:10:52,327 --> 00:10:54,236
也许吧
Maybe.

95
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:58,077
不论如何 我很庆幸我不住在他们隔壁
Whatever it is, I'm glad I'm not the one who lives right next door.

96
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:02,911
来吧 让我们面对现实 柯罗佩一家很古怪
Come on, let's face it. These Klopeks are strange.

97
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:05,165
从他们搬来以后我就一直在观察
I've been watching that house ever since they moved in.

98
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:07,925
没人进来 没人出去
No one goes in. No one comes out.

99
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:10,416
没有访客 没有送货
No visitors. No deliveries.

100
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:12,468
你觉得他们都吃什么?
What do you think they're eatin', Ray?

101
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:17,432
也许这些人只想独来独往
Well, maybe these people just want to keep to themselves, Art.

102
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,594
还记得以前住在隔壁的纳普斯家吗?
Remember when the Knapps lived next door?

103
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:21,928
你和他们聊过几次? 两次
How many conversations did you have with the Knapps? I had two.

104
00:11:22,022 --> 00:11:24,098
他们搬走时连一声再见也没说
They didn't even say goodbye when they moved.

105
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:26,764
拜托 这两家根本不能比
Oh, please. Don't even compare the two.

106
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,945
即使纳普斯一家不爱说话也还算正常
At least, if they weren't conversational the Knapps were semi-normal.

108
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,910
他们会整理庭院 会锄草 他们有一块草坪
They worked in their yard. They mowed their lawn. They had a lawn to mow.

109
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,777
至于柯罗佩家... 我们甚至不知道有几口人
These Klopeks... We don't even know how many of them there are.

110
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:40,947
一共有三人
<i>There are three of them.</i>

111
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,875
只有晚上才会出来
They only come out at night.

112
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,451
瑞奇巴特勒说他们是夜行性动物
Ricky Butler says they're nocturnal feeders.

113
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:48,040
瑞奇巴特勒说的
Oh, Ricky Butler says.

114
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:51,545
上星期我拿着望远镜爬上屋顶
Last week when I was up on the roof with my telescope...

115
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,875
看到他们在自己的后院
I saw them in their backyard.

116
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:57,753
- 他们在做什么? - 挖地
- What were they doing, honey? - Digging.

117
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:03,185
- 像挖墓者吗? - 有可能
- Kind of like grave diggers? - Maybe.

118
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,891
好了 谈话到此为止
All right, that's enough of this conversation.

119
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:09,895
我不准你再和瑞奇巴特勒偷窥柯罗佩家了
I want you to stop spying on the Klopeks with Ricky Butler.

120
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:14,064
还有我不希望你在他脑袋里灌输这些半调子理论
And I'd like you to stop filling his head with such half-cocked theories.

121
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:18,235
- 你要去哪里? - 去换上我的休假拖鞋
- Where you goin'? - I'm gonna change into my vacation togs.

122
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:20,401
蛋吃完了吗?
Are you done with your eggs?

123
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:26,912
我要把百日菊和其他花混在一起
I'm gonna mix the zinnias in with the rest of the flowers.

124
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:28,910
苗圃的人说...
The man at the nursery said...

125
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:33,213
- 真把我气死了 - 什么?
- Boy, that really burns my ass. - What?

126
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:38,540
那个老烂人 他的草坪是这条街最漂亮的
<i>That old fart. He's got the best lawn on the block.</i>

127
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,595
你知道为什么吗?
And you know why?

128
00:12:43,683 --> 00:12:48,926
因为他训练小狗在我的院子大便
Because he trains his dog to crap in my yard.

129
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:54,644
嘿 伦斯菲太太
<i>Hey, Mrs Rumsfield.</i>

130
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:57,308
今天早上没有晒黑线
No tan lines this morning.

131
00:12:57,404 --> 00:13:01,272
很俏
<i>Looks nice.</i>

132
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:04,700
隔壁那个小子真没出息
<i>That kid next door is a meatball.</i>

133
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:12,040
彼得森
<i>Peterson.</i>

134
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:16,290
昨天晚上那群外国佬吵吵闹闹时 他穿着睡袍走出来
He came out in his robe last night when the foreigners were making that racket.

135
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,420
什么也没做
He didn't do one thing.

136
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:23,134
你要先做什么?
<i>So, what are you gonna do first?</i>

137
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:25,130
不晓得
I don't know.

138
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:27,796
- 我有给你看过我的新工具吗? - 还没
- Hey, did I show you my new tools? - No.

139
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:30,299
这工具真棒
These are great.

140
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,478
卡罗父亲送我的圣诞节礼物
Carol's father gave them to me for Christmas.

141
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,137

142
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,815
- 你看 - 噢 真帅 
- Look. - Oh, those are beauties.

143
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:45,698
- 要拿它们盖东西吗? - 应该会吧
- You gonna build something with those? - I think so. Probably

145
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,822
球赛什么时候开始?
Hey, what time does the ball game go on?

146
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,069
大概一点吧
I think it's at about 1:00.

147
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,452
你想去小吃店买个牛肉三明治吗?
<i>You want to go down to the deli and get one of those beef sandwiches?</i>

148
00:13:53,541 --> 00:14:00,504
不想 我要去买车库门的电动开关来装
<i>No. I'm thinking of getting one of those electric garage door openers And installing 

it.</i>

150
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,086
雷
Ray. Ray!

151
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,174
雷 过来
<i>Ray, come here.</i>

152
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:19,896
那是什么?
What is it?

153
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:25,191
是我的邻居
It's my neighbour.

154
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:31,826
一个匈奴人从洞穴走出来了
Hey, one of the Huns came out of the cave.

155
00:15:05,943 --> 00:15:08,730
去打声招呼吧
Why don't you go say hi?

156
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:12,397
是呀 何不呢?
Well, yeah, I guess I could.

157
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:15,408
这个时机最恰好
This would be the perfect time.

158
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:18,827
如果你去和他搭讪 我们就能知道他是什么德行了 去吧
If you go talk to him, we could see what he's like. Go.

159
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:21,239
你也可以跟他打招呼啊
You could say hi to him too.

160
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,733
- 可是他是你的邻居 - 他也是你的邻居
- But he's your neighbour. - No, he's your neighbour as well.

161
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:26,082
可是你的房子和他交界
But you share a property line with him.

162
00:15:26,171 --> 00:15:28,744
我们都在同一条街上 所以你也可以去
We're all on the same block, so you could go too.

163
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,924
我们都在同一个小镇 可是你在他隔壁
We're all in the same town, but you're next to him.

164
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:34,251
如果他要借东西 他会找你
<i>If he was gonna borrow anything, he'd come over to your place.</i>

165
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:36,966
他现在很忙
<i>Well, he's busy now.</i>

166
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:39,547
他才不忙 他要进去了 快点 因为...
He's not busy. Now he's goin' in. Go now because if...

167
00:15:39,642 --> 00:15:44,304
他要进去了 要打招呼就趁现在
<i>He's going back in. If you were gonna say hi, you should probably...</i>

168
00:15:44,396 --> 00:15:46,852
他要进屋子了 你要错过了
He's going into the house. You're gonna lose him.

169
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:49,266
他要进...
<i>He's gonna go in...</i>

170
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,679
- 现在你搞砸了 - 我才没有搞砸
- Now you've blown it, haven't you? - No, I didn't blow it.

171
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:53,770
- 胆小鬼 - 他进屋子了
- Chicken. Chicken. - He went into his house.

172
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:56,105
他走进屋子 又不是我胆小
I'm not chicken because he went into his house.

173
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,698
你在自己儿子面前没种
You look like a chicken in front of your son and everything. Your son.

174
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:01,695
过来
<i>Come on.</i>

175
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:05,323
- 如果真的那么了不起 那我们就去打招呼 - 我是开玩笑的
- If it's suddenly a big deal, let's just go say hello. - Hey, hey, it's a joke!

176
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,326
- 去打招呼 - 干嘛那么凶?
- Let's say hello. - Why so edgy?

177
00:16:07,418 --> 00:16:09,328
- 走阿 - 试试无咖啡因
- Come on, come on. - Try decaf.

178
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,290
他们正在看谁有种去按门铃
They're daring each other to ring the doorbell.

179
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:15,584
我们不应该这样盯着人瞧
We shouldn't stare like this.

180
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:18,297
我们一起去打招呼 否则你就是胆小鬼
Why don't we both go say hello, or are you chicken?

181
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:20,426
加油 彼德森先生!
Go for it, Mr Peterson! Yes!

182
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:24,642
现在大家都在看我们
Now everybody's watching us.

183
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:26,636
- 干得好! - 好 好吧!
<i>- Good going, man! - Yeah, okay, yeah.</i>

184
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:29,813
我和你去就是了 没问题
I'll go in with you. Sure. No problem.

185
00:16:29,898 --> 00:16:32,305
走吧
Let's go.

186
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,852
地下室的窗户有铁条
<i>There's bars on the basement windows.</i>

187
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:14,379
- 他们的阳台也有洞 -那是诱敌的陷阱
<i>- They got holes in their porch too. - That was a booby trap.</i>

188
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,349
- 你还好吧? - 还好
- You okay? - Yeah.

189
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:19,015
- 我不会付帐的 - 我们应该告他们
- I'm not gonna pay for that. - We shouldn't pay for that. We should sue them.

190
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:24,354
这个吗... 让我们先打声招呼
Well, um, let's... Let's say hello.

192
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:51,514
快去拿水管 撑着点! 
Get the hose. Hang on, men!

193
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:59,182
跑来我这! 向水这里跑!
<i>Run to me! Run to water!</i>

194
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:05,656
雷 过来! 向水这里跑!
Ray, over here! Run to water!

195
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:08,776
跑来我这! 快!
<i>Run to me! Come on!</i>

196
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:32,589
我想蜜蜂走了 马克 我想蜜蜂走了!
<i>I think they're gone, Mark. I think they're gone!</i>

197
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:35,432
- 你们被叮到了吗? - 我不敢相信你们那么做
- You men hit? - I cannot believe you did that.

198
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:37,678
- 我也不敢相信 - 我不敢相信! 这帅呆了
- Neither can I. - I cannot believe it! That was great.

199
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:40,437
上星期我去那里也碰到同样的事
The same thing happened to me last week. I was over there.

200
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:43,772
但不是蜜蜂 而是一只狂犬病的松鼠
It wasn't bees though. It was a foaming squirrel.

201
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,232
在东南亚我们把这种事称为 "业障"
In Southeast Asia, we'd call this type of thing "bad karma."

202
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:18,465
亲爱的 如果你一直碰 蜜蜂叮的伤口就不会好
<i>Honey, bee stings don't heal if you keep playing with them.</i>

203
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,808
如果我们去湖边 我会被叮两倍的包
<i>If we had gone to the lake, I'd have twice as many of these.</i>

204
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:26,307
- 你早上可没有什么都说中 - 你要去哪里?
<i>- It isn't like anything you said is coming true. - Where are you going?</i>

205
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,641
我连走到隔壁房间也要你问东问西吗?
<i>I can't walk away without you asking where I'm going?</i>

206
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:32,317
我要去法国巴黎 我要去加拿大班夫 好吗?
<i>I'm going to Paris, France. I'm going to Banff, Canada, all right?</i>

207
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,480
- 这就是我要去的地方 - 你要带狗去吗?
<i>- That's where I'm going. - Are you taking the dog?</i>

208
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,146
对 对 我要去遛狗
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking the dog for a walk.

209
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,828
不 等等
No, wait, wait, wait.

210
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,671
文森 到这里来 
Hey, Vince, let's go over here, huh?

211
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,832
今晚我们不走那条路
Let's not go that way tonight.

212
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:58,010
这个庭院很好
Here's a nice yard. It's a good yard.

213
00:19:58,095 --> 00:20:00,135
嘿 遛狗的人!
Hey, you with the dog!

214
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,507
嘿 别让那只杂种狗到我的草坪 听到没?
<i>Hey, keep that mutt off my lawn, will ya?</i>

215
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:06,511
很好 自由活动
All right. Have a field day.

216
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:12,344
他来这里抽雪茄 因为太太不准 他以为我不晓得
He comes here to smoke cigars. His wife won't let him. He doesn't know I know that.

217
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,808
嗨 雷 你好吗?
Hi, Ray. How ya doin', bud?

218
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:17,655
- 嘿 彼德森先生 - 很高兴见到你
- Hey, there, Mr Peterson. - Good to see you.

219
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:20,657
- 要打火机吗? - 谢谢
- Wouldn't need a lighter, would you? - Thanks.

220
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:24,822
- 今晚夜色真美 - 是呀 绿色的天空
- It is a lovely night, isn't it? - Yeah, green sky tonight.

221
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:31,493
早晨天空发绿 邻居就要警戒
Green sky at morning: Neighbour take warning.

222
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:37,329
夜晚天空发绿呢?
Green sky at night?

223
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:40,591
邻居就该落荒而逃
Neighbour take flight.

224
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:47,174
彼德森先生 你看过「哨兵」这部电影吗?
<i>Did you ever see the movie The Sentinel, Mr Peterson?</i>

225
00:20:47,268 --> 00:20:49,188
是关于一个老人有一栋...
It's about the old guy who owned the apartment...

226
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,388
像是地狱入口的公寓
which is kind of like the gateway to hell.

227
00:20:53,773 --> 00:20:55,682
我没看过
No, I didn't see that.

228
00:20:55,775 --> 00:21:01,066
我正在想
Oh, well, I was doing some thinking.

229
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:05,533
他们上一栋房子被烧掉等等的...
And, you know, being that their last house burned down and all...

230
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:09,533
也许有人把门开着没关
it's like, maybe, somebody left the gate open.

231
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:17,208
是他们 又在活动了
It's them. They're movin' around again.

232
00:21:17,296 --> 00:21:21,708
事情发生的当晚也是这样
It was a night just like this that it happened.

233
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,709
发生什么了 韦嘉纳先生?
What happened, Mr Weingartner?

234
00:21:23,802 --> 00:21:27,218
那是好久以前的事了 星克立丘那时比现在小多了
It was a long time ago. Hinkley Hills was a lot smaller then.

235
00:21:27,306 --> 00:21:32,547
也比较安全 不必锁门 左邻右舍都认识
Safer too. You never had to lock your doors. Everybody knew everybody.

236
00:21:32,643 --> 00:21:36,059
我那时大概九、十岁吧
I must have been maybe nine, ten years old.

237
00:21:36,147 --> 00:21:39,064
- 你知道现在那个购物中心吧? - 知道
- You know where the big mall is? - Yeah.

238
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,230
街角那里本来是一家杂货店
There used to be a big drugstore on the corner there.

239
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:44,403
- 有个很大的汽水吧台 记得吗? - 记得
- It had a big soda fountain. Remember? - Yeah.

240
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:47,573
店主是一个戴着眼镜 矮矮胖胖的人
The guy who ran it was a rotund guy, had glasses.

241
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:50,231
叫做史奇普 住在榆木街
His name was Skip. Lived over on Elm.

242
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:53,577
有太太和两个孩子 人不太灵光
Had a wife, a couple kids. Not too sharp.

243
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:57,246
大概四十岁左右 戴着一顶纸帽子做樱桃可乐
The guy's 40 years old, he's wearing a paper hat and making cherry Cokes.

244
00:21:57,334 --> 00:21:59,907
当然他没有去选州长
It's a cinch he's not running for governor, right?

245
00:22:00,003 --> 00:22:04,582
不管怎样 那年夏天非常闷热
Anyway, it got hot that summer. It got real hot. It was sweltering.

247
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:07,248
热到连内裤都会出汗 然后爬到... 
<i>That heat where your underwear sweats and it crawls up the...</i>

248
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:09,253
反正很热就对了
Anyway, it's hot, okay?

249
00:22:09,346 --> 00:22:13,923
榆木街开始传出一股臭味
And they start smelling this really vile stench over on Elm...

250
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,768
人们认为是从史普奇家里传出来的
and they figure it's comin' from Skip's place.

251
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:18,761
没有人想说什么
No one wants to say anything.

252
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:21,096
难不成趣敲他家的门说 "你家真臭" ?
Do you knock on the guy's door, "Hi, your house stinks"?

253
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,763
所以大家设法不闻不问
So people are trying to ignore it, right?

254
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:27,442
假装没这回事 你知道那些松香片吧?
They're trying to pretend it isn't happening. You know those pine things?

255
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,606
他们设法用挂在车里的松香片挂在家里的阳台上
They're trying to cover up with those pine things that you can put in cars.

256
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:32,782
来掩盖那股臭味
People are hanging those on their porches.

257
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:38,285
- 瑞奇 你觉得很好笑吗? - 是呀
- Oh, you think that's funny, Ricky? - Well, yeah.

258
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:40,615
让我告诉你后来发生的事
Let me tell you what happened next.

259
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:44,124
州政府的卫生督察员来到小镇
The state health inspector shows up. They talk to Skip.

260
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:46,288
和史奇普谈话 他说他的污水帮浦有问题 他们就走了
He says he's got a sump pump problem. They leave.

261
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:48,587
他说他会想办法修理污水帮浦
The guy's got a sewer problem. He says he'll look after it.

262
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:50,465
一切都没事了 对吧?
Everything's okay, right?

263
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:52,460
错了 两个小时后...
Wrong. A couple hours later...

264
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:54,841
史奇普的窗户开始冒烟
there's smoke pouring out of the windows of Skip's house.

265
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,970
- 救火员赶到 你猜他们发现什么? - 什么?
- The firemen go in. Know what they find? - What?

266
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:59,631
史奇普的家人 全死了...
Skip's family, dead. Murdered...

267
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:03,345
好几星期前被史奇普拿冰钻打死了
by Skip... weeks earlier... with an ice pick.

268
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:10,142
那个人拿着冰钻杀了全家
Yeah, the guy killed his whole family... With an ice pick.

270
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:14,488
是呀 他把他们放在阴凉的地下室 
Yeah. Yeah, just put 'em in the cool basement...

271
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:19,152
用床单盖着 然后继续为镇上的人做冰淇淋
covered 'em up with a sheet and went back to makin' treats for the townsfolk.

272
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:23,824
只是史奇普没料到那年夏天热浪来袭
Only Skip didn't count on there being a big heat wave that summer.

273
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:27,665
你知道镇上的人在榆木街上闻到的是什么味道吗?
You know what all those people were smelling on Elm, Ricky?

274
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:29,830
是什么?
What?

275
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:35,840
史奇普家人的尸体在暑气中分解
Skip's family's bodies decomposing in the summer heat.

277
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:39,012
显然 有一天史奇普多做了一杯柠檬果汁汽水
Apparently, one day Skip made just one-too-many lemon phosphates.

278
00:23:39,097 --> 00:23:42,264
"疯狂杀戒"
El snappo.

279
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:48,223
我还记得 小时候听人说过
I remember that. I remember hearing about that when I was a kid.

280
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:53,272
那年夏天他们把汽水吧台拆了
They-They tore down the soda fountain that fall.

281
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,860
这些小镇充满了这一类的故事 就在你的鼻子底下发生
These towns are full of those stories. They're happening right under your nose.

282
00:23:56,947 --> 00:23:58,940
说到鼻子...
You know, speaking of noses...

283
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:01,702
自从这家人搬来以后...
ever since this family has moved to this block...

284
00:24:01,786 --> 00:24:05,368
我一直闻到一种奇怪的味道
I've been noticing a weird kind of odour.

285
00:24:05,456 --> 00:24:07,698
有点像死尸的味道
Kind of like death.

286
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:15,920
球员韦布 跳高一点
Jump a little higher, Spud Webb.

287
00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:18,379
- 灌篮高手! - 抱歉 彼德森先生 这是我的错
- Oh, slam dunk! - Sorry, Mr Peterson. It was a mistake.

288
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:20,377
- 这是我的错 - 别道歉
- Well, it wasn't a mistake. - Don't apologize.

289
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,795
- 我要回家了 - 噢 别这样
- I'm goin' home. - Oh, come on.

290
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:26,472
- 别这么胆小 只是开个玩笑嘛 - 很抱歉 彼德森先生
- Don't be a weenie. It was a joke! - I'm sorry, Mr Peterson.

291
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,936
我要去做有建设性的事 像是去看电视
I'm gonna go do something productive. I'm gonna go watch television.

292
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,231
答案是 他是华盛顿诞辰后的下一个联邦假日
<i>The answer is: it's the next federal holiday after washington's birthday</i>

293
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,225
- 林肯诞辰
<i>- What is Lincoln's birthday.</i>

294
00:24:36,318 --> 00:24:38,227
- 阵亡将士纪念日? - 阵亡将士纪念日 选择
<i>- What is Memorial Day? - Memorial Day is it. Select.</i>

295
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,229
他们把林肯和华盛顿的诞辰放在同一周
They combined Lincoln's birthday with Washington's. It's one weekend now.

296
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:42,231

297
00:24:42,324 --> 00:24:44,732
保持镇静 张开双臂 和身体保持正确角度浮起来
<i>"Remain calm, float with arms stretched out at right angles to the body..."</i>

298
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:47,662
大学时你常对我那样说
That's what you used to say to me in college, right?

299
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:52,407
- 你父母怎么了? - 他们星期四才回来
- What about your parents? - They're not home 'til Thursday.

300
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:59,419
吉儿 我对天发誓 这比电视上的节目还精采
Gail, I swear to God, this is better than anything on television.

301
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:02,424
- 我们为什么不能去看电影? - 电影?
- Why can't we go to a movie? - "A movie"?

302
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,083
那又不是真的 跟电视一样
That's not real. It's the same as television.

303
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:07,753
相信我 这是真的
Trust me. This is real.

304
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:10,220
这是我的左邻右舍
This is my neighbourhood.

305
00:25:12,185 --> 00:25:15,103
他又准时出来了
<i>Here he comes, right on schedule.</i>

306
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:20,891
天啊 我真爱这条街
God, I love this street.

307
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:33,494
雷
Ray.

308
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:35,490
- 什么? - 谁是墨索里尼?
- What? - Who was Mussolini?

309
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,492
"多么甜蜜" 是...
"How sweet it is" was, uh...

310
00:25:37,585 --> 00:25:39,624

311
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:42,119

312
00:25:42,214 --> 00:25:44,788
- 阿特 我们正在看电视 - 他要做什么?
- Art, we're watching the show. - What does he want?

313
00:25:44,884 --> 00:25:48,964
我不知道 不过我会赶回来看 「终极问题」
I don't know. But I'll be back in time for Final Jeopardy.

314
00:25:49,054 --> 00:25:51,212

315
00:25:51,306 --> 00:25:55,932
好戏开始了 看吧
<i>Okay, the show's started. Check it out.</i>

316
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:59,554
你看到那个捲发的傢伙吗? 那是彼德森先生
You see the guy with the curly hair? That's Mr Peterson.

317
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:03,016
他是怀疑论者 人很实际
<i>He's this sceptic. He's basically grounded in reality...</i>

318
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:05,861
不希望相信他的邻居正在搞鬼
<i>and he doesn't want to believe his neighbours are up to something strange.</i>

319
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:09,030
因为如果是真的 他就得面对
<i>'Cause if they were, he'd have to deal with it.</i>

320
00:26:09,115 --> 00:26:12,732
现在看那个胖子 那是韦嘉纳先生
Okay, now see the fat guy? That's Mr Weingartner.

321
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:14,866
他认为柯罗佩真的很邪恶
<i>He thinks the Klopeks are really evil...</i>

322
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:17,527
他们正在地下室建地牢
<i>and that they're building a dungeon in their basement.</i>

323
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:21,703
他和伦斯菲先生决定今晚做一点探查
<i>He and Mr Rumsfield decided to do a little snooping tonight.</i>

324
00:26:21,794 --> 00:26:23,786
这一定很精彩
<i>This should be good.</i>

325
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:27,540


326
00:26:33,137 --> 00:26:36,222
- 这是什么? - 这是红外线望远镜
- What is this? - It's an infrared scope.

327
00:26:36,307 --> 00:26:38,976
狙击手的夜视工具
<i>Snipers use it for night vision.</i>

328
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,720
我们拿它做什么?
What are we gonna do with it?

329
00:26:40,812 --> 00:26:42,721
爬过去查看装了铁条的地下室窗户
Get a look in those barred- up basement windows.

330
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:44,890


331
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:50,735
我们不应该这样做
I've been thinking about it. I don't think we should go through with this.

332
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:52,231
你是胆小鬼吗?
Are you a 'fraidy cat?

333
00:26:52,322 --> 00:26:55,240
我只是觉得太过头了
No, I just think things have gone off the deep end.

334
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:59,572
红外线夜视望远镜? 接下来要窃听电话吗?
Infrared night vision scopes? What are we gonna do next, tap their phone?

335
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:01,572
那可以安排
That can be arranged.

336
00:27:01,665 --> 00:27:04,416
最后就剩下在他们前院烧一个十字架
Then all we have to do is burn a cross on their front lawn.

337
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:05,912


338
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:08,920
- 安静 - 你听到什么?
- Quiet. - You hear that?

339
00:27:09,005 --> 00:27:10,914
我以为只有我听到
<i>I thought that was just me.</i>

340
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:13,758
- 那是一种低频率的哼声 - 越来越大声
- It's a low-frequency hum or something. - It's getting louder.

341
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:16,416
你听
Listen.

342
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:19,264
那是变压器还是什么的?
Is that a transformer or something?

343
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:21,257
该死的电力公司
The goddam power company.

344
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,099
可是我不能...从哪里传来的?
But I can't... Where is it coming from?

345
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:28,687
我知道从哪里传来的
<i>I know where it's coming from.</i>

346
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,130


347
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,464
搞什么鬼啊?
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

348
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,969
部分停电
Brownout.

349
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,977
那味道闻起来好像在煮猫
Smells like they're cooking a goddam cat over there.

350
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:13,106
- 我要去一探究竟 - 蹲下!
- I'm gonna go find out what exactly... - Get down, get down!

351
00:28:34,753 --> 00:28:37,670
没有车前灯
No headlights.

352
00:30:12,796 --> 00:30:15,321
我可以想像新闻报导说
I can see the news report now:

353
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:19,098
他们一家很安静 独来独往
"They were a quiet family. Kept pretty much to themselves.

354
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:23,764
没有人怀疑他们正在搞鬼
No one would have ever suspected them of foul play."

355
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:31,770
我从来没有看过人把自己的垃圾开到路边
I've never seen anybody drive their garbage to the street...

356
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:33,773
然后拿一根棍子勐敲乱打
and then bang the hell out of it with a stick.

357
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,701
从来没看过
I've never seen that.

358
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,949
我们应该去看看 垃圾桶里面到底有什么
I say we get a look in those garbage cans.

359
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:49,958
我可能太小心了 可是那样不是有点可疑?
Call me overly cautious, but don't you think that's a bit suspicious?

360
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:53,464
在晚上十一点下大雨的时候翻他们的垃圾筒?
The three of us going through their garbage at 11:00 at night in the middle of a rainstorm?

361
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,801
说得对 垃圾跑不了的
Affirmative. That garbage is going nowhere.

362
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,805
明天一早在看也不迟 望远镜还我
I say we wait 'til first light. Scope me.

363
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,643
我要走了
<i>I'm outta here.</i>

364
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:07,471
下雨延期
Rain delay.

365
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,601
真倒楣
Bummer.

366
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:25,664
你前天说的半调子理论是什么?
Ray, what was that you were saying the other day about half-cocked theories?

367
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:28,667
雷 好好睡
Ray... sleep tight.

368
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:38,225
周三晚上不行 我要打保龄球
No way Wednesday night. I'm in a league.

369
00:32:38,318 --> 00:32:42,398
这场讲习会将改变你的一生 那个人是很棒的治疗师
This seminar could change your life, Vic. The man is a great healer.

370
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:45,573
我是很棒的保龄球选手 周三晚上要对抗罗西利水电队
And I'm a great bowler. Wednesday night we're taking on Roselli Plumbing.

371
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:48,066
你应该接触这个人
You should expose yourself to this guy, Vic.

372
00:32:48,161 --> 00:32:50,912
他了解超物理力量
He understands paraphysical forces...

373
00:32:50,996 --> 00:32:55,243
水晶的疗效和按手发功
the healing capabilities of crystals and the laying on of hands.

374
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:58,288
你想试试按手发功吗?
You wanna try laying on some hands?

375
00:32:58,378 --> 00:33:01,249
收垃圾的 等等!
Wait! Hold it, garbies! Garbies!

376
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,590
收垃圾的 等一下!
Garbagemen! Hold on a minute! Wait a sec!

377
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:08,425
等等! 你在干什么?
<i>Wait! Wait! Wait! Hold it! What are you doin'?</i>

378
00:33:08,514 --> 00:33:10,754
- 我在清垃圾 - 你疯了吗?
- I'm emptying garbage. - Are you outta your mind?

379
00:33:10,848 --> 00:33:13,304
给我!
Give me that!

380
00:33:13,393 --> 00:33:16,844
- 住手! - 什么也没有
- Hey, cut that out! - There's nothing here.

381
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:19,607
没有断手断脚
Not a finger, not a nose, nothing!

382
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,932
- 把那个给我 - 拿去
- Give me that. - Here you go.

383
00:33:22,026 --> 00:33:25,110
- 你在干什么? - 你要我帮忙
- What are you doin'? - You asked me to help.

384
00:33:25,196 --> 00:33:27,105
你要打给谁?
Who you calling?

385
00:33:27,198 --> 00:33:29,518
我要打给德凡尼 要他们打小木屋打开
I'm calling the Delvaneys and having them open the cottage.

386
00:33:29,534 --> 00:33:32,106
我才不想去小木屋
No, Carol. I don't want to go to the cottage.

387
00:33:32,202 --> 00:33:34,954
好 大卫和我去 你留在这里当间谍
Fine. Then Dave and I will go and you can stay here and spy.

388
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:36,947

带大卫去小木屋 留我在家里走来走去
Take Dave and go to the cottage. Leave me to pad around the house.

391
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:47,290
你成天就和那些傻瓜在街上晃来晃去
"Pad around the house"? All you do is pal around the neighbourhood With those two 

chuckleheads.

393
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:49,626
- 我实在很担心你 - 为什么?
<i>- I am very, very worried about you. - Why?</i>

394
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:52,470

<i>- You're acting like... - What am I acting like, Carol?</i>

395
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:54,464
我就像在休假的人  
Like a guy who's on vacation! 

396
00:33:54,557 --> 00:33:56,466
- 这才不像在休假 - 我很晚起床
- This is not someone on vacation! - See? I sleep late!

397
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,468
- 那去晒晒太阳啊! - 穿睡衣怎么晒?
- Get a tan then! - In my pyjamas?

Your mom and I are having a conversation! If you... What?

404

从垃圾车出来! 你发神经吗?
<i>Get out of the truck! Are you nuts?</i>

405
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,155
一定在这里某个地方
Hey, it's gotta be in here somewhere.

406
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:22,490
最高法庭裁决 一个人的垃圾一到路边

Did you guys pick up a Hefty bag out of that yard that was bulky and probably a little moist?

"谁来收拾这个烂摊子"?
<i>"Who picks up this mess"?</i>

419
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:00,529
你来收拾这个烂摊子 因为你是收垃圾的
You're gonna pick up the mess because you are a garbageman.

420
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,027
我收的是桶子里的垃圾 不是街上的垃圾
I pick up garbage in cans, not from the street!

421
00:35:03,122 --> 00:35:05,198
雷 这里找不到
Ray, there's nothing in here.

422

Wait a minute. You're all dirty, and you're shaking.

427

瓦特知道你在外面吗?
I wonder if Walter knows you're outside.

- 他们是食尸者! - 我可没说
- I told you! They're ghouls! - No, I didn't say that.

433
00:35:41,158 --> 00:35:42,569
他们可能在挖别的东西
They could have been digging for anything.

434
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,902
他们可能在挖大蚯蚓
They could have been digging for night crawlers.

435
00:35:44,995 --> 00:35:48,246
- 大蚯蚓? - 他们是渔夫 他们需要鱼饵
- Night crawlers? - They're fishermen. They need bait.

436
00:35:48,332 --> 00:35:50,240
清醒过来 面对现实吧
Wake up and smell the coffee! 

437
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:53,916
那小子昨晚看到我们趁我们睡觉时爬起来
The kid spotted us last night. When we were sleeping, he got up.

走到垃圾筒旁边 拿起尸体然后...
He went to the garbage can, he took the body and then he...

439
00:35:57,006 --> 00:36:00,755
埋在自己的院子里
He buried him in the backyard.

440
00:36:00,844 --> 00:36:03,798
- 我们走吧 - 这个我喜欢
- Let's get outta here. - I like this.

441
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:06,426
我讨厌死巷 只有一条出路 而且那些人好怪
I hate cul-de-sacs. There's only one way out, and the people are weird.

442

Does anyone know if Walter left a spare key around anywhere?

444
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,899
他出门时一定忘了喂昆妮
He must have gone away and forgot to feed Queenie.

445

你怎么进去的?
How did you get in there?

449
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:43,456
士兵有本事解决难题 进来吧

有挣扎的迹象

电视机开着 椅子翻倒

我应该上楼检查一下
I think I should go upstairs and check this out.

457

I don't like this. I don't like snooping around a neighbour's house.

你是说死人的家里?

- 你可以不偷瓦特家的东西吗? - 有什么差别?
- You wanna not steal that from Walter's house? - Hey, what's the difference?

反正这堆垃圾会流进跳蚤市场
All this junk is gonna end up in a flea market sooner or later.

那里有只死老鼠
A dead rat! There!

473

亲爱的 那不是老鼠

474
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:51,355
那是瓦特的假发
That's Walter's toupee.

475
00:37:51,448 --> 00:37:54,200
把假发放在炉子上 真是好位置
Beautiful place to keep a toupee: On the stove.

我们知道这些老人家
One thing about these old guys:

478
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:02,374
他们没戴假发是不会出门的
They don't ever leave the house without their hair.

479
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:05,033

- Hey, sorry, but we have not looked... - Let's just get outta here.

打破饼干又不犯法
It's not against the law to break cookies.

486

我不敢相信你竟然说服我这样做
I can't believe you people talked me into this.

526
00:40:53,788 --> 00:40:56,623
撒旦是好人 撒旦是朋友
Satan is good. Satan is our pal.

527
00:40:56,708 --> 00:41:01,037
雷 你在念经
Ray, Ray, you're chanting. Hey.

528
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:06,372
一旦被他们控制住 一切就完了
Once they get in here, it's over, pal.

529
00:41:08,595 --> 00:41:11,049
恶魔崇拜者?
Satanists, huh?

530
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:13,973
仪式杀人狂?
Ritual killers?

531
00:41:14,058 --> 00:41:17,723
非常好
Nice. Very, very nice.

532
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:19,887
让我把事情搞清楚
So let me get this straight.

533
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:25,769
柯罗佩把瓦特当成祭品献给魔王?
The Klopeks are offering up Walter as a human sacrifice to Beelzebub?

534
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:28,067
这是一种说法
That's one of the theories. Yeah.

535
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:32,234
好极了
Mm-hmm. Great, great.

536
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:36,073
你就要这样在家里休息一周是吧?
So this is your relaxing week at home, huh?

537
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:38,570
我根本不会错过的
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.

538
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:41,535
- 约翰城的一周 - 你要去哪里?
- A week in Jonestown. - Where are you going?

539
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:43,535
厕所
To the bathroom.

540
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:45,953
别紧张
Relax.

541
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,606
是什么?
What is it?

542
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:34,422


543
00:43:04,747 --> 00:43:06,656
卡罗?
Carol?

544
00:43:17,258 --> 00:43:19,334
卡罗?
Carol?

545
00:43:24,265 --> 00:43:26,174
卡罗?
Carol?

546
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:51,364
 


547
00:43:51,457 --> 00:43:54,707


548
00:43:54,794 --> 00:44:00,380
你请邻居来吃烤肉实在太好了
It was so nice of you to invite the new neighbours over for a barbecue.

549
00:44:08,641 --> 00:44:10,882


550
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:16,053
撒旦是好人 撒旦是朋友
<i>Satan is good. Satan is our pal.</i>

551
00:44:16,147 --> 00:44:18,555
我要杀死每个人
<i>I want to kill everyone.</i>

552
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,022
撒旦是好人 撒旦是朋友
<i>Satan is good. Satan is our pal.</i>

553
00:44:31,453 --> 00:44:34,371
雷彼德森
<i>Oh, Ray Peterson...</i>

554
00:44:34,456 --> 00:44:36,365
不管你做什么...
<i>whatever you do...</i>

555
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:39,329
都不要让他们对你做出...
don't let them do to you...

556
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,255
他们对我做的事
what they did to me.

557
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:44,498
我想那一定很痛
Ooh, I bet that hurts, huh?

558
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,759


559
00:44:55,852 --> 00:44:59,102
这个鲜血奶昔是谁点的?
Who the heck ordered the blood shake?

560
00:44:59,188 --> 00:45:03,435
雷 我是阿特 我只是假扮成史奇普
Hey, Ray. It's not Skip. It's me, Art. I'm just pretending to be Skip.

561
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:05,934
你在这理有没有看到冰钻?
You didn't happen to see an ice pick around here, did you?

562
00:45:08,156 --> 00:45:11,606
别管闲事
<i>Mind your own business.</i>

563
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,780
别管闲事
Mind your own business!

564
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:18,948

Okay!

565

你是否愿意做我邻居
<i>Won't you be my neighbour</i>

579
00:46:05,085 --> 00:46:09,663
请你 请你

580
00:46:09,756 --> 00:46:13,669
做我邻居好吗
<i>Please, won't you be my neighbour</i>

581
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:17,970
雷 我们有个计划

582
00:46:18,055 --> 00:46:22,266
我们有个计划 快点下来
We got a plan. Come on. We got...

583
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:25,601
抱歉 我先生不舒服 他要留在房间里
Sorry, boys. My husband's not feeling well. He has to stay in his room.

584
00:46:25,688 --> 00:46:28,013
- 他不乖 - 别这样
- Ooh, he was bad. - Come on.

585
00:46:28,107 --> 00:46:30,063
卡罗 让他出来 
Please, Carol, let him come out.

586
00:46:30,149 --> 00:46:32,687
拜托
<i>Come on.</i>

587
00:46:32,777 --> 00:46:36,027
在他变回我丈夫之前是不会出门的
He can't come out until he resembles the man that I married.

588
00:46:36,114 --> 00:46:39,732
- 我们没有那么多时间 - 请让他出来
- We don't have that kind of time. - Please let him come out.

589
00:46:39,826 --> 00:46:43,076
我已经把答案告诉你们了
I think that I have given you my answer.

590
00:47:06,143 --> 00:47:11,219
不 蜜蜂从那里出来
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The bees came from there.

591
00:47:11,313 --> 00:47:14,896
- 小心这个洞 - 我们试试侧门
- Watch this hole. - Okay, let's try the side door.

592
00:47:29,331 --> 00:47:31,407
好 做吧

593
00:47:31,499 --> 00:47:36,078
做什么? 我们说好一起做的
Do what? We agreed to do it together.

594
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:10,110
雷  
Ray. Ray.

595
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:12,112
我只是想打个盹
I'm only trying to take a nap.

596
00:48:12,205 --> 00:48:14,114
我只是躺在这里闭上眼睛
I'm only laying here with my eyes closed...

597
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:16,116
想要睡他妈的一觉
trying to get some goddam sleep.

598
00:48:16,209 --> 00:48:18,451
安静点 如果不重要我也不会吵醒你
Quiet, quiet, quiet. I wouldn't wake you if it wasn't important.

599
00:48:18,544 --> 00:48:21,957
- 我们让柯罗佩现形了 - 知道了
- I think we flushed 'em out. The Klopeks. - Okay.

601
00:48:22,048 --> 00:48:24,455
- 伦斯菲和我让他们现行了 - 怎么说?
- Rumsfield and I, we flushed 'em out. - How?

602
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,626
我们写了一张纸条塞在门下
We wrote a note. We slipped it under their door.

603
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:28,795
- 按了门铃然后遛之大吉 - 你这样做了?
- We rang the bell, and then we ran. - You did that?

604
00:48:28,888 --> 00:48:32,303
- 是阿 - 老天! 蠢蛋
- Yeah. - Oh, geez! Stupid idi...

605
00:48:32,391 --> 00:48:34,300
我真不敢相信
I can't believe you...

606
00:48:37,396 --> 00:48:40,313
我只是写 "我知道你们干的好事"
All I did was write, "I know what you've done."

607
00:48:40,399 --> 00:48:43,649
- 我又没有签名什么的 - 我真无法... 你这个蠢蛋
- I didn't sign it or anything. - Oh, I can't... You stupid...

608
00:48:43,735 --> 00:48:47,151
- 你为什么不... 老天! - 你得吓唬吓唬他们
- Why didn't you... God! - You gotta goose these people.

609
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:50,820
你得给他们一点颜色 让他们知道你在这里
You gotta give them a little shot, let 'em know that you're there.

610
00:48:50,908 --> 00:48:53,150
乖狗 文森 去捡吧
Good dog, Vince. Go get it.

611
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:56,161
阿特 你知道吗? 他们会认为是我写的
Here's the thing, Art. They're gonna think I did it.

612
00:48:56,247 --> 00:48:58,654
- 为什么? - 那个老傢伙看到我在写纸条...
- Why? - The old guy saw me write a note...

613
00:48:58,749 --> 00:49:00,658
把它放在瓦特的门底下
and put it under Walter's door.

614
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:03,325
所以他们会认为是我干的!
So they're gonna think that I did it!

615
00:49:03,421 --> 00:49:06,920
你写了一张纸条放在... 我不知道
You wrote a note and put it under the... I didn't know that.

616
00:49:07,007 --> 00:49:09,712
没关係 反正我门佔上风了
<i>It doesn't matter 'cause we got 'em on the run now.</i>

617
00:49:09,802 --> 00:49:11,710
现在他们知道我们晓得了
Now they know that we know that they know that we know!

618
00:49:11,803 --> 00:49:15,587
当然有关係 事情是你做的 可是他们会怀疑我!
Yes, it does matter! You did it, but they're gonna suspect me!

619
00:49:15,682 --> 00:49:18,007
他们不会怀疑别人
They're not gonna suspect anybody. They're...

620
00:49:27,277 --> 00:49:30,692
- 你知道这是什么吗? - 是一根骨头
- Do you know what this is? - It's a bone.

621
00:49:30,779 --> 00:49:35,026
- 是股骨 - 是一根股骨
- It's a femur. - It's a femur bone.

622
00:49:36,618 --> 00:49:42,039
股骨是人类的臀部骨头
A femur just happens to be a human thigh bone, Ray.

623
00:49:42,124 --> 00:49:45,707
- 等等 你怎么知道? - 上生物课时学的
- Wait, how do you know that? - Biology 101.

624
00:49:45,794 --> 00:49:49,044
看看这玩意的尺寸
Look at the size of this thing.

625
00:49:49,131 --> 00:49:51,538
你想这是鸡骨头吗?
Think this came off a chicken or something?

626
00:49:51,632 --> 00:49:54,040
文森从哪里挖到的?
Where the hell did Vince get this?

627
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:03,095
从篱笆下面挖的
<i>He dug it up from underneath the fence.</i>

628
00:50:06,939 --> 00:50:11,850
雷 毫无疑问了
Ray. Ray, there's no doubt any more.

629
00:50:11,943 --> 00:50:15,727
这是真的 你的邻居杀了人
This is real. Your neighbours are murdering people.

630
00:50:15,822 --> 00:50:20,568
他们把尸体剁开 埋在后院里
They're chopping 'em up. They're burying 'em in their backyard.

631
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:25,248
雷 这是瓦特的骨头
Ray, this is Walter.

632
00:50:25,332 --> 00:50:29,085
不!
No!

633
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:47,478
一定还有其他解释
There's just got to be some other explanation for this.

634
00:50:51,606 --> 00:50:54,940
只是垃圾罢了 那傢伙到处捡垃圾
It's just some litter. The guy's a litterbug.

635
00:50:56,778 --> 00:51:01,606
可能是糖果纸 可能是纸巾
<i>It could be a candy bar wrapper. It could be a napkin.</i>

636
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,609
可能是弄皱的信用卡收据
It could be a crumpled up credit card receipt.

637
00:51:03,702 --> 00:51:06,157
那些东西满街都是
Those things blow around all the time.

638
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:08,653
不 是我的纸条
It, uh... No, it's my note.

639
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:14,996
- 噢! 抱歉 
- Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

640
00:51:15,087 --> 00:51:18,372
我没看见你
I didn't see you. I didn't see you.

641
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,799
好极了 捏碎了啤酒罐你觉得好一些了吗?
Great. Crush a beer can. You feel better now?

642
00:51:24,304 --> 00:51:26,795
我认为...
<i>Well...</i>

643
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:30,472
我们不应该再像幼稚园小朋友了
I think it's time we all stopped acting like kindergartners.

644
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,807
- 你说是不是 雷? - 是的 卡罗
- Don't you, Ray? - Yes, Carol.

645
00:51:34,897 --> 00:51:39,109
在有人从屋顶跌下来或让自己着火之前
Now, before somebody falls off a roof or sets themselves on fire...

646
00:51:39,193 --> 00:51:41,103
我们应该过去敲门
I think we should go over there, knock on their door...

647
00:51:41,195 --> 00:51:43,153
邀请他们好好聊一聊
and invite ourselves in for a nice, neighbourly chat.

648
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:47,486
我们一个月前就该这么做了
<i>Get to know these people like we should have done a month ago.</i>

649
00:51:47,577 --> 00:51:50,696
好主意 我来烤巧克力饼干
That's a good idea. I'll make brownies.

650
00:51:50,787 --> 00:51:55,366
- 好极了 趁你们... - 我们不会邀你的
- Great. While you keep 'em busy, I... - You're not invited.

651
00:52:16,645 --> 00:52:19,183
- 卡罗 我们明天再做好吗? - 你放松好吗?
- Can't we do this tomorrow, Carol? - Would you relax?

652
00:52:19,273 --> 00:52:22,191
我们只要聊个五分钟
We'll probably find out more in five minutes of friendly chat...

653
00:52:22,276 --> 00:52:25,977
可能就比你们一个月的案中侦查还有更多发现
than you guys can in a month of snooping around.

654
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:36,032
好 每个人尽量保持正常
Okay, now, everybody just act normal.

655
00:52:42,796 --> 00:52:45,037
是谁? 
Who is it? 

656
00:52:45,131 --> 00:52:48,085
我是隔壁的卡罗彼德森
It's Carol Peterson from next door.

657
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:52,041


658
00:52:52,137 --> 00:52:55,091
巧克力饼干完了
There go the goddam brownies.

659
00:52:58,143 --> 00:53:03,054
欢迎搬来到梅菲尔区 我们是你的邻居
Hi. Welcome to Mayfield Place. We're your neighbours.

660
00:53:03,148 --> 00:53:05,224
我们带了一些点心
We brought dessert...

他们在里面 大家都站着
They're in there, all right. They're just standing around.

好极了 别担心 我可以应付的
Oh, great. Don't worry, you guys. I can get this.

把工具丢过来
Just throw me the tools.

690
00:55:11,228 --> 00:55:14,264


691

今天真潮湿

<i>Yes, I just can't seem to do anything with my hair.</i>

693
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,123

A sardine?

694
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,469

I'm trying to cut back.

695
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:33,044
要来点沙丁鱼吗?
<i>Sardine?</i>

696
00:57:25,898 --> 00:57:28,982


697

你们目前还住得惯吗?

704
00:57:52,923 --> 00:57:55,331
相当舒服的房子吧

牆壁很坚固

706

708
00:58:34,129 --> 00:58:36,798
是灰尘的关係 抱歉
It's packing dust. I'm sorry.

709
00:58:36,882 --> 00:58:39,289
所以...
<i>So...</i>

710
00:58:39,384 --> 00:58:42,718
就你和叔叔住在这里 是吗?
Just you and Unc living here in the house, is that it, sonny?

711
00:58:42,804 --> 00:58:46,553
- 不... - 这是一个小家庭
- No... - Please, this is a small family:

712
00:58:46,641 --> 00:58:50,056
我 这个小伙子
Me, the young boy...

713
00:58:50,144 --> 00:58:54,723
还有我哥哥 他是医生
and my brother... the doctor.

714
00:58:54,815 --> 00:58:58,564
社区里有个医生真好
<i>Won't it be nice to have a doctor in the neighbourhood?</i>

715
00:59:01,989 --> 00:59:07,410
你们能保留这些原木实在太好了
You know, I think it's great you've been able to stay with all the original wood.

716
00:59:07,495 --> 00:59:10,245
纳普斯一家住在这里时 我从来没拜访过
I was never over here when the Knapps lived here.

717
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:14,244
那对纳普斯家实在太遗憾了
How unfortunate for the Knapps.

718
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:20,088
说来好笑 可是我不记得门口有看到搬家的卡车
You know, it's funny, but I don't remember seeing a moving van out front.

719
00:59:20,173 --> 00:59:25,049
这我不明白 但卡车一整天都停在户外
<i>I don't understand that. It was parked outside all day!</i>

720
00:59:25,387 --> 00:59:29,254
怎么样...
S-Say, how is, uh...</i>

721
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:33,761
你这里的下水道管用吗?
the... drainage on your property here?

722
00:59:33,852 --> 00:59:36,094
在我们家 只要一下雨
I know when it rains at our house...

723
00:59:36,188 --> 00:59:40,435
地下室就会淹水
boy, the basement just floods right over.

724
00:59:40,526 --> 00:59:44,773
地下室? 雷提出一个好主意
Basement? Ray comes up with a winning idea.

725
00:59:44,863 --> 00:59:47,022
也许我们应该看看地下室
Maybe we should go take a look in the basement.

726
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:51,109
也许几分钟前是哥哥在那里
Maybe that was brother down there tapping on the ceiling a couple minutes ago.

728
00:59:51,202 --> 00:59:53,111
谁晓得?
Who knows?

729
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:59,458
你哥哥是什么样的医生?
Just what kind of doctor is this brother of yours?

730
01:00:00,044 --> 01:00:03,260
你何不自己去问他?
Why don't you ask him yourself?

731
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:41,330
啊 我们有客人
Ah, we have guests.

732
01:00:41,417 --> 01:00:43,659
可以这么说
Sort of.

733
01:00:43,753 --> 01:00:47,003
我哥哥 医生
My brother, the doctor.

734
01:00:49,091 --> 01:00:50,999
华纳柯罗佩
Werner Klopek.

735
01:00:51,092 --> 01:00:53,334

How nice to meet you.

736
01:00:53,428 --> 01:00:55,337
雷彼德森
Ray Peterson.

737
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:59,013
抱歉 我的手套
Oh, pardon my glove.

738
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,559
我认为蜡烛对女士很浪漫
I thought the candles would be romantic... for the ladies.

739
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,892
它们很美
They're lovely.

740
01:01:53,986 --> 01:01:56,737
我真的为油漆感到抱歉
I really must apologize for the paint.

741
01:01:56,822 --> 01:02:00,072
我正在修饰我的油画
I was just touching up one of my pictures.

742
01:02:00,158 --> 01:02:04,405
绘画能让我放轻松
<i>I find painting relaxes me.</i>

743
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:17,420
- 要代糖吗? - 不用 谢谢
- Sugar substitute? - No, thank you.

744
01:02:17,508 --> 01:02:23,095
我们没有早点介绍自己实在太失礼了
<i>It was impolite of us not to have introduced ourselves sooner.</i>

745
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:26,845
我的工作相当孤独
<i>I find my work is rather solitary.</i>

746
01:02:26,934 --> 01:02:30,931
总是使我们一再搬家
It always keeps us on the move.

747
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:35,433
你知道我们四年内搬了四次吗?
Did you know we've had to move four times in as many years?

748
01:02:35,525 --> 01:02:41,112
搬家一定让你不好受吧 汉斯
<i>Oh, all that moving must be very hard on you, Hans.</i>

749
01:02:41,197 --> 01:02:44,613
确实 明天...
Indeed. And tomorrow...

750
01:02:44,701 --> 01:02:50,953
我们必须到大学讨论另一次搬家
Tomorrow we must all go to the university to discuss yet another transfer.

752
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,531
不 我们才刚刚认识你们
No. And we're just getting to know you.

753
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:56,295
真遗憾 是不是 亲爱的?
That's a shame. Isn't that a shame, honey?

754
01:02:56,378 --> 01:02:57,837
很遗憾
That's a shame.

755
01:02:57,921 --> 01:03:00,128
谁说的?
Says who?

756
01:03:02,217 --> 01:03:08,303
我今天才跟汉斯说 今天
And I was just remarking to Hans... today...

758
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:14,134
若能认识我们所有的新邻居该有多好
how nice it would be to meet all of our new neighbours...

760
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:17,479
而你们就来了
<i>and here you are.</i>

761
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:20,899
- 事实上 我们没有全到 - 是吗?
- Actually, we're not all here. - Oh?

762
01:03:20,985 --> 01:03:26,276
瓦特 隔壁的老人 我们不知道他到哪里去了
Walter, the old man next door. We don't know where the hell he is.

763
01:03:26,366 --> 01:03:28,275
天啊!
Oh, God! Jesus Christ!

764
01:03:28,368 --> 01:03:32,234
抱歉!
Sorry! Sorry! Ow!

765
01:03:32,329 --> 01:03:35,496
老人的困境
Terrible thing, the plight of the elderly.

766
01:03:35,582 --> 01:03:37,491
我们前天还在说
We were just remarking the other day...

767
01:03:37,584 --> 01:03:39,493
像那种老人
about how an old guy like that...

768
01:03:39,586 --> 01:03:41,994
可能不声不响就翘辫子了
could just drop off the face of the Earth without a sign.

769
01:03:42,089 --> 01:03:45,339
消失了 没有人再看到他 毫无踪迹
Vanish. No one ever see him again. No trace. Nothing.

770
01:03:45,425 --> 01:03:50,295
雷 对吧? 我们昨天还谈到
Right, Ray? Yesterday, wasn't it? We were just talking about it yesterday.

772
01:03:50,388 --> 01:03:54,255
我猜你们有
I bet you were.

773
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:58,846
我们别再说客套话了
<i>Why don't we just cut all this polite crap, all right?</i>

774
01:03:58,938 --> 01:04:02,022
你们每次传出来的噪音到底是怎么回事?
What's the weird goddam noise you got comin' outta here all the time?

775
01:04:02,108 --> 01:04:03,602
我想我们应该走...
Uh, I think we should go...

776
01:04:03,693 --> 01:04:05,851
地窖里到底藏了什么 柯罗佩先生?
What have you got in the cellar, Herr Klopek?

777
01:04:05,945 --> 01:04:09,361
- 马克 - 雷
- Mark! - Ray.

778
01:04:09,448 --> 01:04:12,697
来吧 告诉他你看到什么
<i>Come on. Tell him what you saw. Tell him.</i>

779
01:04:12,784 --> 01:04:14,693
我必须借一下洗手间
I have to use your bathroom.

780
01:04:14,786 --> 01:04:17,194
雷 还记得前天晚上吗?
Ray, remember night before last?

781
01:04:17,288 --> 01:04:19,365
- 你说他们在挖地 - 别开门!
- You said they were digging. - Don't open that!

782
01:04:19,457 --> 01:04:21,616
雷!
<i>Ray!</i>

783
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:23,418


784
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:29,457
你把马养在地下室?
You keep a horse in the basement?

785
01:04:47,609 --> 01:04:51,558
- 那是窃贼吗? - 不 是阿特

是个胖子
A fat one.

788
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:01,320
走啊 你这个卑劣的杂种
Go on, you mangy mutt!

789
01:05:02,915 --> 01:05:07,743
如果蓝卓吓到你们 我很抱歉
<i>I'm sorry if Landru frightened you.</i>

790
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:11,585
它的尺寸常会吓到人 - 噢 不会
<i>- His size tends to overwhelm people. - Oh, no, no.</i>

791
01:05:11,673 --> 01:05:15,089
我们打扰太久了 很高兴认识你们
We've imposed on you enough for one evening. It's been lovely meeting you.

792
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,419
- 医生 鲁本 再见 - 再见 汉斯
<i>- See you, Doc. Later, Reub. - Bye, Hans.</i>

793
01:05:17,512 --> 01:05:21,261
医生 谈得真愉快
Yes, Doctor. It's been real.

794
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,591
- 你还好吧? - 我没事

- 我们自己回去吧 亲爱的? - 晚安
<i>- We'll see ourselves to the door. Honey? - Goodnight.</i>

797
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:38,438
好吧 我承认他们是有点奇怪
<i>Okay, I admit it. They're slightly eccentric.</i>

798
01:05:38,532 --> 01:05:40,442
- 何止有点奇怪 - 卡罗...
"Slightly eccentric"? -Carol...

799
01:05:40,534 --> 01:05:42,610
- 但这不代表... - 拜托!
<i>- But that doesn't mean... - Come on!</i>

800
01:05:42,703 --> 01:05:45,870
这些人根本变态
These people are clearly psychos!

801
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:50,291
雷 你认为呢?
Ray, what do you think?

802
01:05:50,377 --> 01:05:55,288
是呀 你觉得呢?
Yeah, what do you think?

803
01:05:55,382 --> 01:05:59,130
雷 你怎么一声不吭
Right. Been awfully quiet, Ray.

804
01:05:59,219 --> 01:06:02,967
发表一下意见吧
Maybe we could have a little participation here.

805
01:06:03,056 --> 01:06:07,469
我认为他们没问题 我想邦妮和卡罗是对的
I think they're clean. I think Bonnie and Carol are right.

806
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,802
- 看吧? - 好极了 雷
<i>- See? - That's great, Ray.</i>

807
01:06:09,895 --> 01:06:12,469
只想讨好女人而不给我们撑腰
Just pull open the door, pull the rip cord and bail out on us.

808
01:06:12,564 --> 01:06:15,316
还亏是你先开始的
That's rich, considering you're the one who started this whole thing.

809
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:17,477
喂 是谁先开始的?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who started it, tuna neck?

810
01:06:17,569 --> 01:06:19,479
整件事都是你挑起的
You instigated this whole damn thing!

811
01:06:19,571 --> 01:06:21,481
你知道事谁挑起的吗? 是你儿子看到别人在后院挖地
You know who instigated this? Your boy watching people dig in the backyard!

812
01:06:21,573 --> 01:06:24,989
- 你给我离开... - 亲爱的 我们可以失陪一下吗?
- You leave my... - Honey, would you and Bonnie excuse us?

813
01:06:25,077 --> 01:06:29,490
我应该在起居室跟兄弟们谈一下
I think I should have a talk with the boys in the den for a few minutes.

814
01:06:29,581 --> 01:06:32,154
好
Okay. 

815
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:35,002
亲爱的 看到你回复神智真好
It's good to see you've come to your senses, sweetie.

816
01:06:36,421 --> 01:06:38,828
只要一两分钟
Just a minute or two.

817
01:06:52,769 --> 01:06:54,845
雷 怎么样?
So, what's the deal, Ray?

818
01:06:54,938 --> 01:06:58,806
你跟婆子们站在同一国是吗?
Are you siding with the chicks against us? Is that it?

819
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,352
是呀 你完全让女人摆布?
Yeah, are you totally pussy-whipped or what?

820
01:07:02,446 --> 01:07:04,687
有种就挺身站出来
Just take your balls out of your wife's purse.

821
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:07,023
难得表明一下你的立场
Make a stand for one time in your life.

822
01:07:07,117 --> 01:07:10,033
雷 别这样
Hey, Ray, come on.

823
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:12,871
- 只是打个比方 - 是笑话 他在开玩笑
- It's just a figure of speech. - It's a joke. He's kiddin' around.

824
01:07:12,955 --> 01:07:15,197
是瓦特的假发
<i>Oh, it's Walter's rug.</i>

825
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:18,161
你拿到老头的假发了 不得了
<i>You got an old guy's wig. Big deal.</i>

826
01:07:18,252 --> 01:07:21,206
你整天都把它塞在裤子里吗?
You've had that in your trousers all day?

827
01:07:21,297 --> 01:07:26,540
你昨天在瓦特家找到之后
After you found this in Walter's house yesterday...

828
01:07:26,636 --> 01:07:31,047
我把它塞回信箱里了
I slipped it back in through the mail slot.

829
01:07:31,139 --> 01:07:34,888
这一次是从哪里来的?
Where did you get it this time?

830
01:07:37,812 --> 01:07:39,888
柯罗佩家? 哇赛
Klopeks? Wow.

831
01:07:39,981 --> 01:07:42,733
狗从地下室冲出来的时候
After the dog came up out of the basement.

832
01:07:42,817 --> 01:07:44,893
我发现它塞在一堆杂志中间
I found it wedged between a bunch of magazines...

833
01:07:44,986 --> 01:07:48,236
杂志都是寄给瓦特的
all of which were addressed to Walter.

834
01:07:48,323 --> 01:07:51,905
那意思就是说...
Then that means that...

835
01:07:51,992 --> 01:07:56,903
柯罗佩潜回瓦特家里...
Klopeks went back inside Walter's house...

836
01:07:56,997 --> 01:07:59,405
拿到假发
and got the hair.

837
01:08:04,171 --> 01:08:07,089
士兵 我们该怎么办?
What do we do now, soldier?

838
01:08:07,174 --> 01:08:10,589
你听到他们说明天要出们
You heard them say they were going away tomorrow.

839
01:08:10,677 --> 01 :08:12,005


840
01:08:12,095 --> 01:08:14,420
早上等车子一开走...
As soon as that car leaves in the morning...

841
01:08:14,514 --> 01:08:19,508
我就要跳过篱笆 找不到尸体誓不回来
I'm going over the fence and I'm not comin' back 'til I find a dead body.

842
01:08:21,187 --> 01:08:25,600
没有人能干掉我街上的老人还逍遥法外
Nobody knocks off an old man in my neighbourhood and gets away with it.

843
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:26,488
各位 我们全副警戒
Gentlemen, we are on alert.

844
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:28,492
亲爱的 你知道可以做什么吗?
Honey, you know what you could do?

845
01:09:28,585 --> 01:09:32,202
去园艺中心买些石板铺在走道上
Go get those flag stones at the garden centre and put them along the walk.

846
01:09:32,296 --> 01:09:34,170
那是一件好差事
Yeah, that'd be a nice project.

847
01:09:34,256 --> 01:09:37,839
可是我今天要和阿特打一个半小时的四人二球赛
I've got a foursome lined up with Art today in an hour and a half though.

848
01:09:37,926 --> 01:09:40,678
我又不是说马上 你讨厌高尔夫的
I didn't mean right now. You hate golf.

849
01:09:40,763 --> 01:09:43,847
我在休假 我只想出去透透气
Well, it's my vacation. I just wanted to get out of the house.

850
01:09:43,932 --> 01:09:46,009
被我烦了一星期 你应该也想出去兜兜风
I would think, after the week I put you through, you'd want to too.

851
01:09:46,101 --> 01:09:49,849
为什么我觉得你想摆脱我?
Why do I get the impression you're trying to get rid of me?

852
01:09:49,937 --> 01:09:53,271
我要出去一整天 这是你去拜访艾芙琳的好机会
I'm gonna be gone all day. It'd be a good time for you to go see Evelyn.

853
01:09:53,358 --> 01:09:55,516
跟表弟妹好好玩
And you have a good time with the cousins.

854
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:59,275
我讨厌他们 鲁迪是白痴 黛安好臭
I hate them, Dad. Rudy is a moron, and Diane smells.

855
01:09:59,364 --> 01:10:01,855
周末愉快
Have a nice weekend.

856
01:10:03,284 --> 01:10:06,036
回头见
I'll see you later.

857
01:10:09,457 --> 01:10:11,864
卡罗 看我的新高尔夫手套
<i>Hey, Carol, see my new golf glove?</i>

858
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:14,035
这样我打高尔夫就不会起水泡了
I got it so I don't get blisters playing golf.

859
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,369
我们真的要大打特打
We're gonna be playing that much golf. Really.

860
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:19,873
前面当心
Fore!

861
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:22,043
你认为她相信吗?
Think she bought it?

862
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:36,637
史帝夫 怎么样?
Yo, Steve-man. What's the haps, dude?

863
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:39,899
你今天一定要过来 保证精彩
You gotta come down here today. It's gonna be live.

864
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,062
不 你一定要来
No, you've got to.

865
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:45,404
有大事要发生 我不能告诉你
Something's about to happen. I can't tell you.

866
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:53,739
你知道你在干什么吗 阿特?
Are you sure you know what you're doing, Art?

867
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,908
那些电线里面都是电
There's a lot of juice going through those wires.

868
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,077
要是碰错了 你就烤熟了
You hit the wrong one, you're a Post Toastie.

869
01:10:58,169 --> 01:11:00,328
电力是我的朋友
Electricity is our friend.

870
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,382
何况 我们要摘掉他们的警铃
Besides, we wanna take out their alarms, don't we?

871
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:06,421
也许我们可以避开篱笆另外找条路
I was thinking we could bypass the fence altogether and find another way in.

872
01:11:06,511 --> 01:11:08,919
没有人知道他们有多少警铃
No one knows how many trip alarms they have in there.

873
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:12,595
不 我只要喀擦一声就可以全部摆平
No, I can take out everything they've got with one clip of the snips.

874
01:11:12,683 --> 01:11:14,759
- 是吧 队长? - 肯定
- Right, Captain? - Affirmative.

875
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:19,597
警铃模式
Siren mode.

876
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:22,607
很酷吧?
Pretty neat, eh?

877
01:11:22,693 --> 01:11:25,101
我可以连接所有警铃频道
I can raise all the police channels...

878
01:11:25,195 --> 01:11:28,362
和电力公司频道
and the power company channels on this baby.

879
01:11:28,449 --> 01:11:30,606
- 阿特 小心点 - 没问题的 雷 
<i>- Be careful up there, Art. - It's okay, Ray.</i>

880
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,784
我们得赶紧行动才行 我们正在耗时间
We gotta get going though. We're burning daylight here.

881
01:11:36,873 --> 01:11:40,787
我们过去后 应该从哪里挖起?
Hey, where should we start diggin' once we get over there?

882
01:11:40,877 --> 01:11:44,791
从后院开始 然后检查地下室
We start in the backyard, then check the basement.

883
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:47,004
上面小心点 慢慢来
Be careful up there. Go slow, huh?

884
01:11:47,091 --> 01:11:50,340
安全是我的中间名
Hey, safety is my middle name.

885
01:11:51,386 --> 01:11:54,304
我以为他的中间名是路易
I thought his middle name was Louis.

886
01:11:55,891 --> 01:11:58,464
你确定你没问题吗?
<i>Are you sure you're all right up there?</i>

887
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,517
他知道自己在干麻吗?
I don't know that he knows what he's doing.

888
01:12:00,604 --> 01:12:04,981
- 那你为什么不上去? - 太高了
- Well, why didn't you go up there? - It's very high.

889
01:12:13,824 --> 01:12:17,407
天哪!
Oh, Jesus!

890
01:12:19,413 --> 01:12:22,782
老天 快用那玩意叫救护车
Jesus Christ! Get an ambulance on that thing!

891
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:28,629
我没事
I'm okay. I'm all right.

893
01:12:32,842 --> 01:12:34,752
我触电了 可是没事
I took a jolt, but I'm okay.

894
01:12:34,844 --> 01:12:36,754
你能站起来吗? 
Can you stand up? 

895
01:12:36,846 --> 01:12:40,262
- 试试这个 - 好多了
- Try one of these. - Oh, yeah, that's better.

896
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,758
老天
No, no, no. Jesus.

897
01:12:42,852 --> 01:12:46,518
看我的手指
Look at my fingers.

898
01:12:46,606 --> 01:12:50,603
指甲都变黑了
My fingernails are black.

899
01:12:50,693 --> 01:12:53,362
- 我补的牙好热 - 看看这
- My fillings are hot. - Hey, look at this.

900
01:12:53,445 --> 01:12:57,194
他还真切对了线路 警铃没响
The man actually hit the right wire. There's no alarm.

901
01:12:57,283 --> 01:13:00,865
- 干得好 - 恭喜
- Hey, good work. - Congratulations

902
01:13:00,953 --> 01:13:04,536
- 我要去建立通讯基地了 祝一切顺利 - 好的
- I'm gonna set up a communications base. - You got it.

903
01:13:04,623 --> 01:13:08,288
拿去 你需要这个
Here, you're gonna need this.

904
01:13:32,899 --> 01:13:35,355
伦斯菲 老兄
Hey, hey, hey, Rumsfield! Dude!

905
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:37,483
你拿着枪做什么?
What are you doing with the gun?

906
01:13:37,571 --> 01:13:40,406
闭上你的狗嘴 漆你他妈的房子
Just shut up and paint your goddam house!

907
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:44,322
哇赛 好
Whoa! Fine.

908
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:53,076
特遣部队一号 这是鹰眼
Task Force One, this is Eagle Eye.

909
01:13:53,169 --> 01:13:56,538
一切安全
You are all clear.

910
01:13:58,049 --> 01:14:00,337
收到了 鹰眼 我们正要跨过去
Roger, Eagle Eye. We're going over.

911
01:14:00,426 --> 01:14:05,800
收到了 红罗浮 让雷跨过去
Roger. Red rover, red rover, let Ray go over.

912
01:14:08,017 --> 01:14:12,345
很好 现在 红罗浮 让阿特跨过去
Good. Now, red rover, red rover, let Art go on over.

913
01:14:16,733 --> 01:14:19,141
好极了 结束
That's great. Over.

914
01:14:25,367 --> 01:14:28,237
天气变得好热
It's really getting hot out here.

915
01:14:28,328 --> 01:14:31,244
是啊 变得好热
Yeah. Yeah, it is getting hot, Art.

916
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:35,624
你怎么不挖个自己的洞?
Why don't you dig one of your own holes, huh?

917
01:14:35,709 --> 01:14:39,458
我只是在检查这个 而且... 无线电... 我在监督
I was just checking this one. Besides, the radio... I was monitoring...

918
01:14:39,546 --> 01:14:43,758
事情远比我们想得还棘手
This is turning out to be a lot more work than we thought it was gonna be.

919
01:14:43,842 --> 01:14:47,710
我们进屋吧 里面应该比较凉快
Why don't we check the house? It's probably a lot cooler in there.

920
01:14:47,805 --> 01:14:50,425
好主意 让我们试试屋子
That's a good idea.Let's try the house.

921
01:14:50,515 --> 01:14:53,184
从地下室开始
We'll start in the basement.

922
01:14:53,268 --> 01:14:57,597
我们从地下室开始 然后一路往上
We'll start in the basement and just work our way up.

923
01:14:57,689 --> 01:15:00,808
雷 我想我们在后院找不到东西的原因
<i>Ray, I'm thinking the reason we didn't find anything in the backyard...</i>

924
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,460
是因为他们可能没有把尸体埋在后院 
<i>is because they probably weren't burying anybody in the backyard.</i>

925
01:15:03,528 --> 01:15:07,228
他们把尸体挖起来埋在地下室
<i>They were digging bodies up and they probably buried them in the basement.</i>

926
01:15:07,323 --> 01:15:09,565
只是可能而已 阿特
<i>That's a possibility, Art.</i>

927
01:15:09,659 --> 01:15:13,406
我们从厨房开始吧 那里可能有些冰啤酒
<i>I say we start in the kitchen. They probably got some cold beer in there.</i>

928
01:15:13,495 --> 01:15:17,078
或是德国蒜肠什么的 我饿死了
<i>Or some knockwurst or something. I'm starving.</i>

929
01:15:17,165 --> 01:15:20,083
门锁了
It's locked.

930
01:15:20,168 --> 01:15:22,375
把信用卡给我 - 
Hey, give me a credit card. 

931
01:15:40,146 --> 01:15:44,938
- 你从哪里学的? - 我不知道怎么弄
- Where did you learn how to do that? - I don't know how to do this.

932
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:50,899
反正是一张烂卡
Ah, it's a shit store anyway.

933
01:15:55,952 --> 01:16:00,116
雷 你知道什么是 "擅闯空门" 吗?
Ray, do the words "breaking and entering" mean anything to you?

934
01:16:01,374 --> 01:16:07,247
伦斯菲先生 嘿!
<i>Hey, Mr Rumsfield! Hey, yo, man!</i>

935
01:16:07,339 --> 01:16:09,248
我想向你介绍我的朋友 
I wanted to introduce you to my friend.

936
01:16:09,341 --> 01:16:12,590
- 史帝夫昆兹 - 嘿 老兄
- This is Steve Kuntz. - Hey, dude.

937
01:16:12,676 --> 01:16:14,799
他今天下午过来看好戏
He's here to watch the show this afternoon.

938
01:16:14,887 --> 01:16:16,796
很好
Great.

940
01:17:00,305 --> 01:17:03,555
嘿 老兄 好戏什么时候开始?
Hey, man, when's the big unveiling, huh?

941
01:17:03,642 --> 01:17:09,348
- 我两小时候要去工作 - 嘿 老兄 滚开
- I gotta go to work in a couple hours. - Hey, man, piss off!

942
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:12,854
把这个浑小子撵出你的院子
Get this lame-o out of your yard! 

943
01:17:12,942 --> 01:17:15,943
- 混小子 滚出我的院子 - 怎么搞的?
- Get out of my yard, lame-o! Hey! - What's his problem?

944
01:17:16,028 --> 01:17:18,187
滚出我的院子
<i>Get out of my yard!</i>

945
01:17:25,746 --> 01:17:28,368 
雷 看看暖炉的尺寸
<i>Ray, look at the size of this furnace.</i>

946
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:30,947
这玩意一定有八十年历史了
This thing's got to be 80 years old.

947
01:17:31,042 --> 01:17:33,616
这种老房子一定很难取暖
These old places have got to be hell to heat.

948
01:17:33,712 --> 01:17:35,455
这栋房子没有那么大
<i>This house isn't that big.</i>

949
01:17:35,547 --> 01:17:39,710
要这种暖炉做什么?
What the hell does he need a furnace like this for?

950
01:17:41,678 --> 01:17:45,177
一定做过修改 导管是新的
I think there's been some modifications on this 'cause this conduit's brand new.

951
01:17:45,265 --> 01:17:47,886
它一直通到后面那里 然后从天花板的洞穿过去
It runs all the way back over there and up through a hole in the ceiling.

952
01:17:47,976 --> 01:17:50,466
有一些通到他们客厅
I saw some of that in their living room.

953
01:17:50,561 --> 01:17:53,230
家用暖炉的调温器
And a thermostat on a home furnace...

954
01:17:53,314 --> 01:17:56,018
需要到五千度吗?
Is that supposed to go to 5,000 degrees, do you think?

955
01:17:56,108 --> 01:17:57,982
那一定就是噪音的来源
It must be what all the noise was.

956
01:17:58,068 --> 01:18:00,028
看看这里装的东西
Look at all the stuff they put together down here.

957
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:03,155
- 屋子里都是电池 - 少说有四十个
- They got this place wired with batteries. - There's got to be 40 of them.

958
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:06,027
你看 这里有电
Look, we got power here.

959
01:18:23,343 --> 01:18:26,593
这不是普通的暖炉
This is no ordinary furnace.

960
01:18:33,268 --> 01:18:37,895
那是什么?
<i>What's that?</i>

961
01:18:44,488 --> 01:18:46,943
喂 伦斯菲!
<i>Yo, Rumsfield!</i>

962
01:18:52,662 --> 01:18:55,947
不得了!
<i>Awesome!</i>

963
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,531
伦斯菲先生 你还好吗?
<i>Mr Rumsfield, are you okay?</i>

964
01:18:58,626 --> 01:19:01,295
- 我没事 - 帅呆了
- Yes, yes, I'm all right. - That was very cool, man.

965
01:19:02,588 --> 01:19:05,210
阿特 看
Art. Art, look.

966
01:19:05,299 --> 01:19:07,707
- 你看! 我找到了 - 松脱的土
- Look! I found it! - That's loose dirt.

967
01:19:07,802 --> 01:19:11,845
他们一定在暖炉里烧尸体
They must have burned his body up in the furnace...

968
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:13,887
然后把他的骨头埋在这里
and then buried his bones right here.

969
01:19:13,974 --> 01:19:16,761
现在我们该怎么办?
What do we do now?

970
01:19:19,646 --> 01:19:21,555
我会告诉马克这里有个火葬场
I'll tell him that they built a crematorium down here.

971
01:19:21,648 --> 01:19:25,693
别告诉他 他会想跑下来看 等我们找到端倪再说
Don't tell him that. He'll just want to come down. Wait 'til we find something.

972
01:19:25,777 --> 01:19:28,398
雷 那可能要一整晚
Ray, that could take all night.

973
01:19:33,951 --> 01:19:38,577
伦斯菲先生 你们让整条街停电了
Mr Rumsfield, you guys managed to knock out the power in the entire block.

974
01:19:38,664 --> 01:19:40,989
搞不好整个城镇南端都停电
<i>Probably the whole south end of town.</i>

975
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:43,040
瑞奇 给我闭嘴!
Ricky, shut up!

976
01:19:43,585 --> 01:19:46,586
我们要去麦当劳 
We're gonna make a run to McD's.

977
01:19:46,672 --> 01:19:49,459
- 你要来个麦当堡什么的吗? - 不行!
- You want a Quarterpounder or something? - Oh, no way!

978
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:52,254
你们现在不能走 精彩好戏就要上场了
Hey, you guys can't go now. It's the best part.

979
01:19:52,343 --> 01:19:55,843
- 我打给送披萨的 - 好耶!
- I called the pizza dude. - All right!

980
01:20:25,751 --> 01:20:28,621
雷 我想我们可以放弃了 他们不可能埋的这么深 
<i>Ray, I think we can give up. They'd never bury him this deep.</i>

981
01:20:28,712 --> 01:20:34,334
除了我们之外 谁会一直挖到这团烂泥?
<i>Who, besides us, would dig this deep into this kind of sludge?</i>

982
01:20:34,425 --> 01:20:36,963
那是金属!
<i>That was metal!</i>

983
01:20:37,053 --> 01:20:39,508
你碰到地窖了!
That was metal! You hit a crypt!

984
01:20:39,597 --> 01:20:45,137
他们把他埋在地窖里! 我去拿喷灯! 我打给它
They buried him in a crypt! I'll get my blowtorch! I'll call it in!

985
01:20:45,227 --> 01:20:49,853
喂! 呃... 鹰眼 这是特遣部队一号
Hello! Hey, uh... Eagle Eye, this is Ground Force One.

986
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:53,273
我们找到瓦特了 我马上来! 
We have found Walter! We found Walter! I'll be out in a minute!

987
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:57,227
快挖! 太棒了! 我们找到他了
Dig there! Dig there! Oh, yes! We found him!

988
01:20:59,574 --> 01:21:01,816
我们逮到你了 鲁本
We caught you, Reub.

989
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:05,326
你把我们当成傻子 可是你错了
You've been playing us for saps, but you were wrong.

990
01:21:48,454 --> 01:21:50,660
韦嘉纳先生! 阿特!
<i>Mr Weingartner! Art!</i>

991
01:21:50,747 --> 01:21:53,784
看那边! 现在就看!
Look! Look over there! Look! Right now!

992
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,923
走开 走开 我自己来
Go on. Go on. I'll...

993
01:22:04,636 --> 01:22:06,545
瓦特!

01:22:09,474 --> 01:22:12,427


995
01:22:12,518 --> 01:22:15,852
雷! 雷蒙!
Ray! Raymond!

996
01:22:16,814 --> 01:22:19,270
仔细听好 先生
<i>Listen up real carefully, mister.</i>

997
01:22:19,358 --> 01:22:21,647
我们碰到大麻烦了
We got a real problem.

998
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:25,270
雷 你猜我看到谁了? 是瓦特
Hey, Ray, guess who's not in the basement? Walter!

999
01:22:25,364 --> 01:22:27,902
他回来了!
He's back! He's back!

1000
01:22:35,206 --> 01:22:38,907
柯罗佩回来了 还带着警察
<i>Klopeks! With coppers!</i>

拦住他们 我去找雷
Keep 'em busy. Keep 'em busy. I'll get Ray.

1002
01:22:43,131 --> 01:22:46,049
- 拦着他们! - 好的 没问题
<i>- Keep them busy! - All right, okay, all right!</i>

1003
01:22:46,134 --> 01:22:50,380
停车! 停啊! 别往前了!
Stop! Stop right there! Don't go any further!

1004
01:22:50,471 --> 01:22:54,053
我叫你停啊 停!
You're going! Stop!

1005
01:22:54,141 --> 01:22:57,759
警察先生 等等
Hey, Mr Officer, wait.

1006
01:22:57,853 --> 01:22:59,762
这些人在我爸妈家
There are these people in my parents' house...

1007
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:01,812
把他们的食物吃光了!
and they're eating all their food!

1008
01:23:08,489 --> 01:23:10,397
雷 瓦特回来了
<i>Ray, Walter showed up!</i>

1009
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:14,618
- 还有柯罗佩 我叫瑞奇去... - 我挖到瓦斯管了 快跑!
- The Klopeks! I got Ricky down there... - I hit the gas line! Run!

1010

- 瓦斯! - 快跑!
- Gas!  - Run!

1011
01:23:17,205 --> 01:23:19,245
- 这里出了什么事? - 谢天谢地
<i>- What is the problem here? - Thank God you're here.</i>

1012
01:23:19,332 --> 01:23:22,203
- 没问题 警官 - 这不是警察的事
- No problem, sir. - This is not a police matter.

1013
01:23:22,293 --> 01:23:24,618
我们挖到瓦斯管 瓦斯管外洩!
<i>We hit a pipe! There's all kinds of gas!</i>

1014
01:23:24,712 --> 01:23:27,797
要爆炸了!
It's gonna blow!

1015
01:23:30,717 --> 01:23:34,501
- 棒呆了 - 瑞奇真知道怎么搞派对
- All right! - Ricky sure knows how to throw a party.

1016
01:24:05,001 --> 01:24:07,705
那是你的房子?
Was that your house?

1017
01:24:15,635 --> 01:24:17,592
雷
Ray.

1018

那里有东西在动
Something is moving in there.

1019
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:04,965
雷 你找到了 对吧?
Ray... Ray, you found it, right?

1020
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:07,264
在爆炸之前你找到了 对吧?
Before it blew, you found it, right?

1021
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:10,435
告诉我你找到了 对不对?
Hey, tell me you found it. You found it, right?

1022
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:14,186
在一切爆炸之前你一定找到了
Before everything went off, you had to have found it.

1023
01:25:15,776 --> 01:25:18,314
先生 你有官司上身了
You got a lawsuit on your hands, mister.

1024
01:25:20,864 --> 01:25:24,565
天哪 怎么回事?
Oh, God, what's this?

1025
01:25:44,345 --> 01:25:50,172
请注意 远离路障
Your attention, please. Please stay behind the barricade.

1027
01:25:56,982 --> 01:26:00,232
请退后
You want to step back, please?

1028
01:26:00,318 --> 01:26:03,439
- 那是我家 - 抱歉 我得获得瓦斯公司批准
- That's my house. - Sorry. I've got to get the all clear from the gas company.

1029
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:06,614
- 我可以批准 她住这里 - 我有问你吗?
- I can clear this. She lives here. - Did I ask you?

1030
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:09,273
小姐 请后退 听到没?

1033
01:26:24,216 --> 01:26:29,555

- is buried in that house, Sherlock. - Watch it.

1038
01:26:42,108 --> 01:26:44,017
他到底跑哪去了?
Where was he anyway?

1039
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:47,064
斯尼克先生今晚八点以前都在医院里
Mr Seznick was at the hospital 'til 8:00 this evening.

1040
01:26:47,155 --> 01:26:49,823
星期一晚上他心悸了
Monday night he had some heart palpitations.

1041
01:26:49,907 --> 01:26:54,403
他打电话给女儿和女婿 他们把他送到医院
He called his daughter and son-in-law, and they took him to the hospital.

1042
01:26:54,494 --> 01:26:57,994

What about the wig? They found a wig in this house.

01:26:58,081 --> 01:27:00,288
- 他的假发 - 柯罗佩帮他收信
- His wig. - The Klopeks were picking up his mail.

1044
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:04,836
医生可能把假发跟报纸及信件混在一起了
The doctor somehow got that wig mixed up with the newspapers and letters.

1045
01:27:04,922 --> 01:27:08,172
医生? 你真相信他是医生?
"Doctor"? You don't believe that this guy's a real doctor, do you?

1046
01:27:08,258 --> 01:27:10,582
对 我相信他是医生
Yes, I do believe he's a doctor.

1047
01:27:10,676 --> 01:27:14,010
事实上 他是一位受人尊敬的病理学家
In fact, he's a very well-respected pathologist, my friend.

1048
01:27:14,096 --> 01:27:18,094
你没有让他在那场爆炸丧生算你走运了
I'd say that you are damn lucky you didn't kill him in that blast.

1049
01:27:18,184 --> 01:27:22,051
是阿 谢天谢地
Oh, yeah, I thank my lucky stars.

- 好好照顾这个煳涂蛋 - 老兄 你的车抱歉了
- Take care of this nitwit. - Sorry about your car, man.

1051
01:27:27,026 --> 01:27:31,189
破坏私人财产 破坏公共财产
<i>Destruction of private property. Destruction of public property.</i>

骚扰 攻击 破坏
Harassment, assault, vandalism.

1054
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:41,695
那个老人还说他收到勒赎信
And that poor old man claims he's got a ransom note...

1055
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:44,245
说你绑架他的狗
that says you kidnapped his dog!

1056
01:27:46,628 --> 01:27:49,083
你听得见吗 彼得森先生?
Do you hear me okay, Mr Peterson?

1057
01:27:51,715 --> 01:27:55,843
我真的喜欢你的发型
I really do like your hair, honey.

1058
01:27:55,928 --> 01:27:57,967
这不会改变事实
<i>You know, this doesn't change a thing.</i>

1059
01:27:58,055 --> 01:28:00,890
他们以为没事了 但可不是这样
They may think it does. They may think they're off the hook, but they're not.

1060
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:03,596
他们有事 对吧? 告诉他们
No, they're not. Are they, Ray? Go ahead, tell 'em.

1061
01:28:03,686 --> 01:28:05,974
我们掌握了他们犯罪的证据
We got the goods on 'em, don't we?

1062
01:28:06,063 --> 01:28:08,221
哪一天他们去挖那个院子
Someday they're gonna dig up the back of that yard...

1063
01:28:08,315 --> 01:28:10,770
会发现股骨之外的整块残骸
and they're gonna find the rest of that skeleton to go with that femur.

1064
01:28:10,858 --> 01:28:15,070
- 可能不是瓦特 但... - 闭嘴 阿特!
- It might not be Walter, but... - Shut up, Art! Shut up!

1065
01:28:15,154 --> 01:28:18,654
天啊 你还不知道要罢手
God, you don't know when to quit, do you?

1066
01:28:18,741 --> 01:28:21,612
看看我!
Look at me!

1067
01:28:21,703 --> 01:28:24,372
都是因为你 我去掉半条命
I'm a shell of a man because of you, Art.

1068
01:28:24,455 --> 01:28:27,706
- 好了 - 士兵!
- Now, now... - Soldiers!

1069
01:28:27,792 --> 01:28:30,709
你别再去烦他们了!
You leave 'em alone! Get off their case already!

1070
01:28:30,794 --> 01:28:35,207
他们又没有对我们怎么样
They didn't do anything to us. They didn't do anything to us!

1071
01:28:35,299 --> 01:28:38,465
好吧 他们是不一样 他们独来独往
All right, so they're different! So they keep to themselves!

1072
01:28:38,552 --> 01:28:42,087
你能怪他们吗? 隔壁邻居闯进他们家里
Can you blame them? They live next door to people who break into their house...

1073
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:44,850
在他们出门时把房子烧掉了
and burn it down while they're gone for the day.

1074
01:28:46,268 --> 01:28:49,850
还记得你说住在郊区的人吗?
Remember what you were saying about people in the 'burbs?

1075
01:28:49,937 --> 01:28:51,846
像史奇普的人
People like Skip?

1076
01:28:51,939 --> 01:28:57,645
锄了八百次的草后突然变了样
People who mow their lawn for the 800th time and then snap?

1077
01:28:57,737 --> 01:29:00,903
那就是我们! 不是他们!
Well, that's us! It's not them! That's us!

1078
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:05,735
是我们跳过篱笆 偷窥别人的窗户
We're the ones vaulting over fences and peeking in through people's windows!

1079
01:29:05,828 --> 01:29:10,288
是我们把垃圾扔到街上 是我们点的火
We're the ones throwing garbage in the street and lighting fires!

1080
01:29:10,373 --> 01:29:13,160
是我们自己疑神疑鬼
We're the ones who are acting suspicious and paranoid, Art!

1081
01:29:13,251 --> 01:29:17,628
我们才是疯子! 不是他们!
We're the lunatics! Us! It's not them!

1082
01:29:19,215 --> 01:29:21,504
是我们
It's us.

1083
01:29:24,179 --> 01:29:28,093
我不知道要怎么说
I don't know what to say.

1084
01:29:28,183 --> 01:29:30,091
你要我搬家吗?
What, do you want me to move?

1085
01:29:33,938 --> 01:29:36,808
- 我要杀了他! - 你疯了!
- I'm gonna kill him! - You're crazy!

1086
01:29:38,901 --> 01:29:41,143
- 退后! -  住手!
- Back off! - Stop it! Stop it!

1087
01:29:41,237 --> 01:29:44,652
分开!
Break it up!

1088
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:47,776
- 住手! - 我不管! 我被炸到了!
- Stop it! Stop it! - I don't care! I've been blown up!

1089
01:29:47,868 --> 01:29:50,026
带我去医院!
Take me to the hospital!

1090
01:29:50,119 --> 01:29:52,610
带我去医院 我不舒服
Take me to a hospital. I'm sick.

1091
01:29:52,705 --> 01:29:58,376
我的眼睛很痛
My eye hurts.

1092
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:11,635
亲爱的 我会找出他们送你去哪家医院
Honey? I'll just find out what hospital they're taking you to...

1094
01:30:11,723 --> 01:30:15,507
然后我随后就到 
and then I'll... follow right along.

1095
01:30:15,602 --> 01:30:17,595
-好吗? - 好的
<i>- Okay? - Okay, honey.</i>

1096
01:30:18,897 --> 01:30:21,435
- 你还好吧? 我很好 卡罗
- You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, Carol.

1097
01:30:31,075 --> 01:30:34,776
混小子 离开我的车
Okay, hepcats, get off my car!

1098
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:37,540
老兄 你应该待久一点
Dude, you should hang out a little bit.

1099
01:30:37,623 --> 01:30:40,624
送披萨的马上就来了
We've got the pizza dude coming.

1100
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:43,414
你这个白痴 呆子
You imbecile! You sub-moron, you!

1101
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:48,216
是谁?
<i>Who's that?</i>

1102
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:54,919
柯罗佩医生 很抱歉
Oh, Dr Klopek, I'm so sorry.

1103
01:30:55,015 --> 01:30:57,553
柯罗佩医生 等我出狱后
You know, Dr Klopek, when I get out of prison...

1104
01:30:57,642 --> 01:31:00,727
我会帮你重盖新房子
I'm gonna help you rebuild your house.

1105
01:31:00,812 --> 01:31:04,311
我甚至会亲手盖一部分 我有工具
I'll even do some of the work myself. I have the tools.

1106
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:07,733
卡罗父亲刚送给我一套新工具
Carol's father just gave me a brand new set of tools.

1107
01:31:07,819 --> 01:31:12,195
我看起来像白痴吗 彼德森先生
Do I look like an idiot, Mr Peterson?

1108
01:31:12,281 --> 01:31:14,190
不像
No.

1109
01:31:14,283 --> 01:31:18,328
你把我当成傻子吗?
Do you take me for an imbecile?

1110
01:31:18,412 --> 01:31:20,321
没有
No.

1111
01:31:20,414 --> 01:31:24,957
你骗得了别人
You may have fooled the others, Mr Peterson...

1112
01:31:25,044 --> 01:31:27,036
可是骗不了我
but you don't fool me.

1113
01:31:28,464 --> 01:31:30,621
我骗了别人?
Uh, I fooled the others?

1114
01:31:30,715 --> 01:31:33,965
- 可是你骗不了我 - 我骗不了你?
<i>- But you don't fool me. - I don't?</i>

1115
01:31:34,052 --> 01:31:37,006
对 你骗不了
No, you don't.

1116
01:31:37,096 --> 01:31:39,469
我不懂你的意思
Am I missing something, Doctor?

1117
01:31:39,557 --> 01:31:44,682
少装了 彼德森先生 你在我的地下室
Come now, Mr Peterson. You were in my basement.

1118
01:31:44,771 --> 01:31:49,646
你当然看了暖炉里面
Surely, you looked in the furnace.

1119
01:31:49,733 --> 01:31:54,027
我看到了暖炉 医生
I saw your furnace, Doctor...

1120
01:31:54,112 --> 01:31:58,774
可是我认为暖炉是自家的事
but I figured a man's furnace is his own business.

1121
01:31:59,868 --> 01:32:03,700
你看到一个骷髅头了 对吧?
You saw one of my skulls, didn't you?

1122
01:32:03,789 --> 01:32:06,873
我知道你有
Oh, yes. I know you did.

1123
01:32:07,876 --> 01:32:11,493
它属于你的邻居
It belonged to a neighbour of yours.

1124
01:32:11,587 --> 01:32:15,799
名叫纳普斯
The name was Knapp.

1125
01:32:15,883 --> 01:32:19,086
我们的房子是从他们那来的
We took the house from them.

1126
01:32:19,178 --> 01:32:23,887
我像他们出价买房子 可是你知道老人是什么样子
I offered to buy it, but you know how old people are.

1127
01:32:23,975 --> 01:32:27,972
他们恋旧 捨不得
They grow so attached to things.

1128
01:32:28,062 --> 01:32:30,469
柯罗佩医生 我忘了皮夹
Uh, you know, Dr Klopek, I think I forgot my wallet.

1129
01:32:30,564 --> 01:32:35,309
我让你留着股骨
I let you keep the femur.

1130
01:32:35,402 --> 01:32:39,898
可是骷髅头要还我
Now, now, I want my skull.

1131
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:43,822
也许 我应该拿你的
Or, perhaps, I might just take yours.

1132
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:45,654
汉斯

1134
01:33:16,816 --> 01:33:18,939
送披萨的!

1135
01:33:25,617 --> 01:33:27,526
干得好!

1136
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,502
真够瞧

1137
01:33:46,929 --> 01:33:50,593
公民逮捕!

1138
01:33:52,099 --> 01:33:56,311
我 雷彼德森 因为你企图谋杀

1139
01:33:56,395 --> 01:33:58,471
我以公民的身分逮捕你
for my attempted murder!

1140
01:33:58,564 --> 01:34:00,473
这个人不知道自己在说什么
The man doesn't know what he's talking about.

1141
01:34:00,566 --> 01:34:03,022
- 公民逮捕 - 雷
- Citizen's arrest. Citizen's arrest. - Oh, Ray.

1142
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:05,981
别惹我 卡罗 他承认他们杀了纳普斯一家人
Don't start with me, Carol. The man confessed. They murdered the Knapps.

1143
01:34:06,072 --> 01:34:08,064
- 他精神错乱 - 嘿 福尔摩斯
<i>- He's demented. - Hey, Sherlock.</i>

1144
01:34:08,157 --> 01:34:10,730
叫柯罗佩告诉你 他们把尸体埋在哪里
<i>Get the Klopeks to tell you where they buried the stiffs.</i>

1145
01:34:10,825 --> 01:34:13,862
你拿不出尸体 你没有证据
<i>You don't have a stiff. You don't have any evidence.</i>

1146
01:34:13,954 --> 01:34:15,863
现在有证据了
You do now.

1147
01:34:27,008 --> 01:34:28,965
这是你的车吗 柯罗佩医生?
This your vehicle, Dr Klopek?

1148
01:34:33,013 --> 01:34:35,587
医生 我们走吧
<i>Let's go, Doc.</i>

1149
01:34:35,683 --> 01:34:40,309
嘿! 小木偶!
Hey! Pinocchio!

1150
01:34:40,396 --> 01:34:42,353
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

1151
01:34:46,986 --> 01:34:49,109
逮到你了!
Gotcha!

1152
01:34:53,825 --> 01:34:56,660
别动 小伙子
Don't you make a move, sonny.

1153
01:34:56,744 --> 01:35:01,702
我在丛林待过一年半 三两下就可以折断你的脖子
I was 18 months in the bush, and I can snap your neck in a heartbeat.

1154
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:04,958
我认为全世界的变态和狂热者以及谋杀者
I think the message to psychos, fanatics, murderers...

1155
01:35:05,044 --> 01:35:06,954
都应该知道
nutcases all over the world is, uh...

1156
01:35:07,046 --> 01:35:11,458
别找郊区居民的麻烦 因为我们不会忍受的
do not mess with suburbanites because, uh, we're not gonna take it any more.

1157
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:13,424
我们不是只会照顾草坪
We're not gonna be content to look after our lawns...

1158
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:15,337
给汽车打蜡和油漆房子
and wax our cars, paint our houses.

1159
01:35:15,429 --> 01:35:18,549
我们会把他们揪出来
We're out to get 'em, Don. We are out to get them.

1160
01:35:22,728 --> 01:35:24,767
- 哈罗 - 嗨
- Hello. - Hi.

1161
01:35:26,648 --> 01:35:30,645
你现在要做什么?
So, what are you gonna do now?

1162
01:35:30,735 --> 01:35:34,898
我要打包去湖边
I'm gonna pack a bag and go up to the lake.

1163
01:35:34,989 --> 01:35:36,898
我们逮到他们了 邻居
We got 'em, neighbour.

1164
01:35:38,117 --> 01:35:41,652
- 我会避开他们 - 嘿 大伙儿
- Get away from him. - Hey, you guys.

1165
01:35:41,746 --> 01:35:44,581
想去喝杯啤酒什么的吗?
You wanna go down to Bowl-O-Rama for a beer or something?

1166
01:35:44,665 --> 01:35:48,366
那招窒息压制真够瞧 那傢伙真凶暴
Man, that was an incredible choke hold you put on me, pal. The guy's a brute.

1167
01:35:48,461 --> 01:35:50,369
那只手指还好吧?
How's that finger? Is it okay?

1168
01:35:50,462 --> 01:35:52,538
你们要去哪里? 
Where are you guys going? Where you going?

1169
01:35:52,631 --> 01:35:55,252
去渡假
I'm going on vacation.

1170
01:35:55,342 --> 01:35:57,667
渡假? 你疯了吗?
"Vacation"? What, are you crazy?

1171
01:35:57,761 --> 01:35:59,800
这事成了媒体的头条新闻
This is a major media event here.

1172
01:35:59,888 --> 01:36:03,838

I want you to keep an eye on the neighbourhood for me.

1182
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:38,585
没问题 彼德森先生
You betcha, Mr Peterson.

1183
01:36:38,675 --> 01:36:41,592
包在我身上
<i>No problem.</i>

1184
01:36:57,317 --> 01:36:59,274
天啊 我真爱这条街
God, I love this street.
