00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:06,700
Once upon a time,
in deep winter,

5
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,782
a queen was admiring
the falling snow

6
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,415
when she saw a rose blooming
in defiance of the cold.

7
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,207
Reaching for it,
she pricked her finger

8
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,005
and three drops of blood fell.

9
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,255
And because the red seemed
so alive against the white

10
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,932
she thought, "If only I had
a child as white as snow,

11
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:35,434
<i>"lips as red as blood hair
as black as a raven's wings</i>

12
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,062
"and all with the
strength of that rose. "

13
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,777
Soon after, a daughter
was born to the Queen

14
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,409
and was named,
"Snow White."

15
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,407
And she was adored
throughout the kingdom

16
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:58,957
as much for her defiant
spirit as for her beauty.

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,948
We found it
in the woods.

18
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,325
It's injured, Mother.

19
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,410
It must have
broken its wing.

20
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,252
Don't worry,
it will heal in time.

21
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,582
I'll look after it.

22
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,414
You possess a rare
beauty, my love.

23
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,421
In here.

24
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,506
Never lose it.

25
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,260
It will serve you well
when you become queen.

26
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,316
Be careful
you don't fall.

27
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,772
I'm just
getting you an apple.

28
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,861
Here you go.
Thank you.

29
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,192
William!

30
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,941
William!

31
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,578
The next winter was
the harshest in memory

32
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,994
and Snow White's mother
passed away.

33
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,789
The King was inconsolable.

34
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,000
Taking advantage
of his grief,

35
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,427
a dark and mysterious
army appeared

36
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,258
and lured him into battle.

37
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,832
What devil
spawned this army?

38
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,417
Send them back to hell!

39
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,918
No prisoners!

40
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,397
The dark
army was defeated,

41
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,938
but what would soon come
to pass was far darker.

42
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,105
Sire!

43
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,662
A prisoner.

44
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,242
Fear not,

45
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,582
you will come to no harm
from me or my men.

46
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,290
What is your name,
my lady?

47
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,136
Ravenna, sire.

48
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,560
So enchanted by
her beauty was the King

49
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,351
that he forgot, for the first
time, his broken heart

50
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,894
and the very next day,
she would become his wife.

51
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,272
You're so beautiful.

52
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,611
That's kind, Child.

53
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,282
Especially when
it is said that yours

54
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,580
is the face of true beauty
in this kingdom.

55
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,328
Come.

56
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,412
This all must be
difficult for you.

57
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:15,088
I, too, lost my mother
when I was a young girl.

58
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,470
I can never take
your mother's place.

59
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,879
Never

60
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,932
But I feel that
you and I are bound.

61
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,437
I feel it there.

62
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,265
Your heart.

63
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,154
You will be
the ruin of me.

64
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,911
Indeed, my lord.

65
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,749
I was ruined
by a king like you once.

66
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,959
I replaced his queen,

67
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,886
an old woman.

68
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,885
And, in time, I, too,
would have been replaced.

69
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,059
Men use women.

70
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:58,813
They ruin us and when
they are finished with us

71
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:04,068
they toss us to the dogs
like scraps.

72
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,070
What have you given me?

73
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,749
When a woman stays young
and beautiful forever,

74
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,542
the world is hers.

75
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:20,043
First, I will take
your life, my lord.

76
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,964
And then
I'll take your throne.

77
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,797
Welcome, brother.

78
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,136
MY queen.

79
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,638
She had tricked her way into
the kingdom with a phantom army.

80
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,475
She now welcomed
a very real one.

81
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,888
William!

82
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,598
Snow, get out! Snow!

83
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,851
I can't leave!

84
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,351
The Princess!
No!

85
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,269
Get out of here! Go!

86
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,449
William! Don't leave me!

87
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,868
Father, we must go back!
We must!

88
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,874
No!
We've lost her!

89
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,209
No! No! No!

90
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,801
Don't leave me!
William!

91
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,404
Out.

92
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,450
Out!

93
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,971
Mirror, mirror

94
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,846
on the wall,

95
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,474
who is
the fairest of them all?

96
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,977
It is you, my queen.

97
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,860
Yet another kingdom
falls to your glory.

98
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,492
Is there no end to
your power and beauty?

99
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,124
The remnants, my queen.
What do we do with them?

100
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,008
To the sword.

101
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,842
Finn.

102
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,522
Lock her up.

103
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:31,398
One never knows when royal
blood may be of value.

104
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,042
So poisonous was
the reign of Ravenna,

105
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:54,004
that nature turned on itself and
people turned on each other.

106
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,919
The land died

107
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,423
<i>and with if, hope</i>

108
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,431
And all that time, she
kept Snow White imprisoned

109
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,143
high up
in the north tower.

110
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,587
Our Father who art
in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

111
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,749
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
done on Earth as it is in heaven,

112
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,213
Give us this day our daily
bread, and forgive us our sins,

113
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,549
as we forgive those
who sin against us.

114
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,588
Lead us not into temptation,

115
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,474
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

116
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,118
Hello'?

117
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,077
Hello'?

118
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,797
What is your name?
I am Greta.

119
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,961
What happened to you'?

120
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,926
All the girls in our
village were taken.

121
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,807
I was trying to reach Duke Hammond's
castle when I was caught.

122
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,639
Duke Hammond?

123
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,303
Is he alive'?

124
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,523
Does he still fight
in my father's name?

125
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,183
You're the King's daughter.

126
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,438
The night the King died, we were
told all in the castle were slain.

127
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,481
And William?

128
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,649
Is the Duke's son
still alive?

129
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,194
I don't know, Princess.

130
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,996
What will they do to me?

131
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,113
Do you remember
when we were children

132
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,527
begging for scraps
like those wretches?

133
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,612
Yes, sister.

134
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,952
Am I not kinder?

135
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,710
YES.

136
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,758
These two were captured
leading an ambush

137
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,757
on one of our
supply trains.

138
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,142
Your son'?

139
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,857
Handsome.

140
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,900
Obviously, a debt
owed to your mother.

141
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,577
There was a time I would have lost
my heart to a face like yours.

142
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,494
And you, no doubt,
would have broken it.

143
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,366
lain, no!

144
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,022
You would kill your queen'?

145
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,524
Such courage.

146
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,276
Such beauty.

147
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,482
But how strong
is your heart?

148
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,907
No. My son.

149
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,294
My son!

150
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,971
Leave him.

151
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,181
Let him return
to the Duke

152
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,230
and speak of the generosity
of his queen.

153
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:42,932
Out.

154
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,441
Out!

155
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,314
Magic comes
at a lofty price.

156
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,729
And the expense grows.

157
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,731
You look...
Old.

158
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,524
Tired.

159
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,496
MY Dower

160
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,913
fades.

161
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,754
I have something
for what ails you.

162
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,185
Oh.

163
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,945
Greta?

164
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,657
Greta?

165
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,619
on the wall,

166
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,299
who is fairest
of them all?

167
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,293
My queen,

168
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,551
on this day,
one has come of age

169
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,762
fairer even than you.

170
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,395
She is the reason
your powers wane.

171
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,055
Who is it'?

172
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,975
Snow White.

173
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,519
Snow White?

174
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,697
She is my undoing?

175
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,615
I should have killed her
when she was a child.

176
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,279
Be warned.

177
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:48,417
Her innocence and purity
is all that can destroy you.

178
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,331
But she is also
your salvation, Queen.

179
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,629
Take her heart
in your hand

180
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,296
and you shall never again
need to consume youth.

181
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,387
You shall never again
weaken or age.

182
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,723
Immortality.

183
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:10,056
Immortality

184
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,058
forever.

185
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,819
Finn!

186
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,406
Brother,

187
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,659
bring me
the King's daughter.

188
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,647
Did I wake you?

189
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,658
Are you always awake
when I watch you'?

190
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,126
You've never
come in before.

191
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,127
My sister won't allow it.

192
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,383
She wants you
all to herself.

193
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,343
I'm afraid of her.

194
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,347
And not of me?

195
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,508
No.

196
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,312
Fear not, Princess.

197
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:20,194
You will never again
be locked in this cell.

198
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,821
What does she
want from me'?

199
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,201
Your beating heart.

200
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,591
Get me out of here!

201
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,589
No!

202
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,174
Greta?

203
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,724
Go.
Get me out of here!

204
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,685
No!
Go.

205
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:57,894
No!

206
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,470
Stop her!

207
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,593
Catch her!

208
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,312
Seize her!

209
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,466
Get to the gate!

210
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,488
Bring her back to me!

211
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,051
How is it that
an innocent young girl

212
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,134
makes a fool
of my brother?

213
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,222
Armed only with a nail.

214
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,817
If she'd had a sword,

215
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,229
she would have
taken my kingdom.

216
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:04,158
"Bring me
the King's daughter,"

217
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:10,915
and you let her slip right through
your tiny little fingers.

218
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,824
How'?

219
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,836
You swore that
you would protect me!

220
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,997
You swore!

221
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,386
Now there's no one
I can trust.

222
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,889
No one. There's no
loyalty, no loyalty.

223
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,551
None, not even from you!

224
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,058
Where is she?

225
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:39,359
She was chased
into the Dark Forest,

226
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,861
where the men lost her.

227
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,774
She's no good to me
in the Dark Forest, lost!

228
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,036
I need her heart!
You failed me, Finn!

229
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,868
Have I not
given all to you!

230
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,548
Havel

231
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,209
not given you all?

232
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,263
Yes, sister.

233
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,224
Quiet.

234
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,063
I have no powers
in the Dark Forest.

235
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,904
You have to find me someone.

236
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,454
Someone who knows it.

237
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,745
Someone who can hunt her.

238
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,840
You owe me money
from my pocket

239
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,091
and money for the girl.

240
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,924
Well, you know, I seem
to have drunk it all,

241
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,009
but you're welcome to it
when it comes out again.

242
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,932
You've gone too far.
I want my money!

243
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,976
Here it is!

244
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,646
The Queen
demands your presence.

245
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,061
Can't you see
I'm having a bath?

246
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,070
Trust me on this, sister.

247
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,287
All right! All right!

248
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,280
Hey!

249
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,959
My brother tells me you are a widower.
A drunkard.

250
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,846
And one of few who has
ventured into the Dark Forest.

251
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,051
Aye.

252
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,174
One of my prisoners
has escaped there.

253
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,809
Then he's dead.
She.

254
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,264
She is certainly dead.

255
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,019
Find her.

256
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,351
Bring her to me.

257
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,528
No, I've been to that forest.
I'm not going back.

258
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,861
You will be
rewarded handsomely.

259
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,195
What good is gold to me

260
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,197
if I'm lying dead with the
crows picking at my eyes?

261
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,206
Why is she of such value?

262
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,371
That is none
of your concern.

263
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,544
I'll determine what
concerns me, thank you.

264
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:48,082
You will do this for me,
huntsman!

265
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,713
And if I refuse?

266
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,473
Do me the favor,
I beg of you.

267
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,517
To his knees.

268
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,477
So you wish to be reunited
with your beloved?

269
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,605
You do not
speak of my wife.

270
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,036
You miss her.

271
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:30,632
What would you give
to see her again?

272
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,219
You know of my powers.

273
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,765
Bring me the girl

274
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,219
and I will bring back
your wife.

275
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,729
Nothing can bring her back.

276
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,265
I can.

277
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,276
A life

278
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,283
for a life.

279
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,092
She can't have gone far.

280
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,635
All right,
do exactly as I do.

281
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,684
It's a bad idea.

282
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,961
Stay here.

283
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,354
Come here'
No!

284
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:58,609
Will you help me?

285
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,324
Please, the Queen
is going to kill me.

286
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,483
Sure she is.

287
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,444
She's going
to rip out my heart.

288
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,659
Quick work.

289
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,539
Hey.

290
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,075
Well done, huntsman.

291
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,581
Hand her over.

292
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,047
What do you intend
to do with her?

293
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:18,958
Why do you care'?

294
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,089
You want her... Hey!

295
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,300
Give me what
I was promised.

296
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,215
You did your job well.

297
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,059
Now, keep your word.

298
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,352
He'll kill us both.
Shut up.

299
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,479
He will.
I said, shut up.

300
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,186
No, no.

301
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,602
I'll keep my word
when the Queen keeps hers.

302
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,894
Where's my wife?

303
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,656
He's going
to betray you.

304
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,160
My sister has many powers.

305
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:50,999
She can take life away,
or sustain it,

306
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:56,918
but she can't bring your wife
back from the dead, you fool!

307
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,423
I want her back!

308
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:05,197
I will find you!

309
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,542
Quiet. All right?

310
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,920
Hey, what the
hell's going on'?

311
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,880
Who are you? Why does the
Queen want you dead?

312
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,215
She wants everyone
dead, all of us.

313
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,629
What makes you
so damn valuable?

314
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,431
You should know,
you're the one hunting me.

315
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:36,600
Forget it.

316
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,394
I should have never got involved
in the Queen's business.

317
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,403
What did I get in?
Stupid...

318
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,235
Where are you going'?

319
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,576
Getting away from you. You're
trouble, is what you are.

320
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,864
I need to get to the Duke's castle.
There's an army there.

321
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,576
Oh, the Duke's army?

322
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,413
Bunch of farmers and
milkmaids with pitchforks.

323
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,750
I know sheep that
have more fight in them.

324
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,043
I'm valuable.

325
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,258
That's why you're
here, isn't it?

326
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,808
If you return without me,
you're dead.

327
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,727
If you leave me,
I'm dead.

328
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,769
Just for argument's sake,
how much reward?

329
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,144
However much is enough.

330
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,273
At least thirty gold pieces...
A hundred.

331
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,577
Help me.

332
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:35,947
Who are you?

333
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,458
Maybe you should have
asked the Queen that.

334
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,959
I don't trust you.

335
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,626
I've given you my word.
I still don't trust you.

336
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,250
But you have a deal.

337
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,430
Give me that,
before you lose a finger.

338
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,815
She killed my brave lain
with just the palm of her hand

339
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,075
and then she drew a dagger
from her side with no blood.

340
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,993
She cannot be killed.

341
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,489
But there is more.

342
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,376
The Princess is alive.

343
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,712
Where is my son'?

344
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:23,854
We have word
of the Princess.

345
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,396
Ravenna has kept her,
all these years.

346
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:30,895
She lives?

347
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,866
She escaped the castle,
into the Dark Forest.

348
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,403
I'm going after her.

349
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,196
We don't know if she survived.

350
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,280
William!

351
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,699
What?

352
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:47,086
You ventured beyond the castle
walls again, disobeying my orders.

353
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,083
We're all that's left,
don't you understand?

354
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,257
I cannot afford to lose
any more of my men.

355
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,417
I'm going alone.

356
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,549
I will not lose
my only son.

357
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,969
You don't know
the Dark Forest.

358
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,134
Then I'll find
somebody who does.

359
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,429
I will not abandon her
a second time.

360
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,684
The forest gains its
strength from your weakness.

361
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,981
Do you drink
to drown your sorrows?

362
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,987
Or your conscience?

363
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,528
What concern is it of
yours, why I drink?

364
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,655
I suppose a man's
sorrows are his own.

365
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:07,333
What does a young girl like
you know about sorrow?

366
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,389
Don't flatter yourself.

367
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,091
Now stay close.

368
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,775
You men know the dark forest?

369
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,742
Load and prepare.

370
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,829
You ride for
50 gold pieces.

371
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:49,750
Does it not trouble you
to serve her'?

372
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,332
Who the Queen?

373
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,165
I serve no one.

374
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,426
Especially that old hag, and any other royalty.
They're all damned.

375
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,226
The King and his true
queen are not damned.

376
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,393
The King?

377
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,056
He's the one that let
the devil in the door.

378
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,392
It's his fault the kingdom's
plunged into darkness.

379
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:17,645
From you?

380
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,063
You know nothing.

381
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,318
What? And you do?

382
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,742
What's a wee scrod like you
care about the King anyway?

383
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,616
You're barely old enough
to remember him.

384
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,742
The land is diseased.

385
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,415
Nature is upturned.

386
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,539
This, this is the legacy
of your precious king.

387
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:58,728
Do you need a bowman?

388
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,237
I have a bowman.

389
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,694
Kill him.

390
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,203
I said, do you
need a bowman?

391
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,057
Here, I want
to show you something.

392
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,813
Which is your lead foot?

393
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,189
If someone comes at you,
you raise this arm up

394
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,158
and you block, and use their
strength against them.

395
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,236
You're small, so wait
until they're close

396
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,703
and you drive it through
their heart to the hilt.

397
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,709
You understand'?
Do not hesitate.

398
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,161
You look in their eyes

399
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,877
and do not pull it out
until you see their soul.

400
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,642
I couldn't do that.

401
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,647
Well, you might not
have a choice.

402
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,459
We have their trail.

403
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,049
Move on. Move on!

404
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,789
Wait.

405
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,626
Is this the edge
of the Dark Forest?

406
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,832
Aye.

407
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,335
What is it?

408
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,063
Troll!

409
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,818
Go!

410
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,369
Run!

411
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,089
I told you to run.

412
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:35,137
If I had,
you would be dead.

413
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,670
Only demons or spirits pass through
the Dark Forest. Which are you?

414
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,714
We're fugitives
from the Queen.

415
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,000
We mean you no harm.

416
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,842
Where are all the men?

417
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,502
Gone.

418
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,410
Have you got
nothing to drink?

419
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,911
You have traveled far

420
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,748
and carried
a great burden.

421
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,255
I've had worse jobs.

422
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,544
Anyway,
she's not that heavy.

423
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:44,057
You don't know
who she is.

424
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,552
What do you mean?

425
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,108
Why? Who is she?

426
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,941
Maybe it needs a skirt,
or a dress or something?

427
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:58,818
That's nice.

428
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,741
How about a face?

429
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,572
Your mother
wants to see you.

430
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,964
Why didn't you tell me?

431
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,798
Because I'd think
it was too difficult a task?

432
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,467
You would be right.

433
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,140
I didn't trust you.

434
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,059
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

435
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,721
Our scars protect us.

436
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:12,141
Without beauty, we are
worthless to the Queen.

437
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,891
It's a sacrifice we made

438
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,318
so we could raise
our children in peace

439
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,856
while their fathers
are at war.

440
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:23,941
And you,

441
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,360
your sacrifice will come.

442
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,699
You must rest.

443
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,024
How can you desert her
when you know the truth?

444
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,935
Aye, I know the truth.

445
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:03,197
That's why she should be as
far away from me as possible.

446
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,483
Anything I ever cared about
was taken away from me.

447
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,110
Not this time.

448
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,573
She's safer here with you.

449
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,146
Lily! Lily, come On!

450
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,685
Come on!

451
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,823
Run, rats, run!

452
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,286
Find her!

453
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,710
Find her!

454
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,458
Come on!

455
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,299
Get in the boats!
Get in the boats!

456
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:05,630
Lily!

457
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:36,558
In there, baby.
There you go.

458
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:40,645
Come on!

459
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,891
NO! No!

460
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:49,896
Come on! Let's go!

461
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,440
No! We have to help them!

462
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,732
You will. Go'

463
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,822
Come on!
Go!

464
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:28,064
Your beauty is all that
can save you, Ravenna.

465
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:33,482
This spell will make your beauty
your power and protection.

466
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:39,906
By fairest blood
it is done.

467
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,581
Here. Drink, drink!

468
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:47,830
But, be warned.

469
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:51,466
By fairest blood,
this spell can be undone.

470
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,929
Avenge us!

471
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,001
I'm sorry.

472
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,841
I'm sorry.
You're not.

473
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,179
I am.
You left us.

474
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,647
We should never
have been there.

475
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,732
Hey, look at me.

476
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,735
I'll take you to
Duke Hammond's, okay?

477
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,319
All right'?

478
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,077
You have my word.

479
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,324
Wait!

480
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:17,718
This is our lucky day.

481
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,005
Oh, no. Dwarves.

482
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:23,050
The hedge-pig I loathe most in the
world lands right in our lap.

483
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,433
Come on, Beith.

484
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:25,885
Is this how
you treat a friend?

485
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,771
Oh! No, no, no,
you puttock.

486
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,557
This is how
I treat a friend.

487
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,276
She's pretty.

488
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:36,563
And who's this?

489
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,404
Is this an errant apprentice
or captive?

490
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:40,567
This man is helping me.

491
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:41,860
We should kill them both.

492
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:43,404
He's caused us
nothing but trouble.

493
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,200
Skewer him and leave her to rot.
I don't like killing girls.

494
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,208
I do.
Good.

495
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,619
Leave her alone, Duir.

496
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,753
He's got nothing. One silver
coin and an empty codpiece.

497
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,718
Two days we sat here.
What for?

498
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,254
Nothing.

499
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,630
We should have stayed by the river.
What a waste of time!

500
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,767
Cut us down, Beith.
I have gold I can pay you.

501
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,929
It's not here, it's
hidden back in the woods.

502
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,768
Shut your ugly mug,
huntsman.

503
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:14,309
If you had any pennies, you would
have pissed it away on mead by now.

504
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:15,648
Cut us down,
then I'll show you.

505
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,312
Pull the other one,
you lying dangler.

506
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:20,483
Tell them the truth, huntsman.
There's no time!

507
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,993
I have to take this girl to Hammond's.
She's not safe here.

508
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,825
Well, my little heart
bleeds for you.

509
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,615
We should chop them up
and feed them to the wolves.

510
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:29,999
Yeah. Yes!

511
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,542
Who is she?

512
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,461
She's worth
a lot of gold to me.

513
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,998
Which I am happy to share with
you stupid little dwarves.

514
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:37,582
Stop that!

515
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:40,293
Gold is worth nothing to any
of you if you're all dead!

516
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,803
The Queen's men hunt us!

517
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,135
They're very close!
Shut up!

518
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,303
You have love
for the Queen?

519
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,764
We have no love for the Queen.

520
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:50,053
Then you fight against her?

521
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,604
No one fights
against the Queen.

522
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:53,982
We lost everything
when the King died.

523
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,437
We fight only
for ourselves!

524
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,601
YES.

525
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,320
My father was King Magnus.

526
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:08,655
Muir,

527
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,784
does she speak the truth?

528
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:15,834
Yes. She is of the blood.

529
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:20,300
She is destined, Beith.

530
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:25,343
I see an end
to the darkness.

531
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:30,893
Riders!

532
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,178
They found us!

533
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,892
If you don't cut us down,
we'll all be killed!

534
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,183
I don't like this, Beith.
It smells like trouble.

535
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,727
You'll find your weight in
gold if you out us down, now!

536
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:39,894
Shut up, Princess.

537
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,855
Queen's riders!

538
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:43,899
And they're coming
this way!

539
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:46,033
We'll take her,
but not him!

540
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,569
What?

541
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,032
No, both of us!

542
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,697
Cut them both down, Gort!

543
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,366
Let's get the hell
out of here!

544
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,246
Move it! Move it!

545
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,531
They're close.

546
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,233
Blasted fairy music.

547
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,815
Yeah.

548
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,360
Good thing there's
plenty of moss about.

549
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:58,992
Where are we?

550
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,496
They call it Sanctuary,
my lady.

551
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,539
It's the home
of the fairies.

552
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,048
Fairies.

553
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,026
Clear!

554
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,865
Coll'?

555
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,411
Clear!

556
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,245
Set up camp!

557
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,536
Gus. Quert.
Make the fire.

558
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,417
Gort, your mug.

559
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,152
Play louder,
you whey-face,

560
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,730
I can still hear
them harpy fairies.

561
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:18,909
Duir, would you really
have killed her?

562
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:20,573
Yeah.

563
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,242
Of course.

564
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:46,149
That seat's not taken, if that's
what you were about to ask.

565
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,772
I want to thank you.

566
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,282
It's only a log.

567
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,985
There's no need
to thank me.

568
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,407
No, for before.

569
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:00,617
For defending me.

570
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:03,954
Ah. Your father
was a good man.

571
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:06,119
The kingdom prospered.

572
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:07,958
Our people prospered.

573
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:11,795
There were more of you.

574
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,380
Aye.
Yeah.

575
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,800
The men you see before you

576
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,763
and many, many more,
went deep into the caves.

577
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:25,313
We were noble gold miners

578
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,312
because we could see
the light in the darkness.

579
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,487
Gus. Gus?

580
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,987
You were just a boy,
but you remember.

581
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:40,157
When we returned
to the surface,

582
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,161
there was nothing.

583
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:45,829
The land was blackened.

584
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,961
Everything,
everyone was gone.

585
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,499
Was dead.

586
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:57,508
That was the month
your father died.

587
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,093
I'm very sorry.

588
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:03,518
As am I, Princess.
As am I.

589
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:07,354
Son, play a happy song.

590
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,689
Why spend your leisure
Bereft of pleasure

591
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:15,025
Amassing treasure
Why scrape and save?

592
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:18,741
Why look so canny
At ev'ry penny?

593
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,699
You'll take no money
within the grave

594
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,706
I know I'm a bit gicky,

595
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,205
but would you care
for a dance'?

596
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:30,537
I'd be honored, Gus.

597
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,548
Our glasses clinking
And round and round

598

600
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:43,725
<i>So, lads and lasses
Because life passes</i>

601
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:47,888
Come fill your glasses
for another round

602
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,395
I don't trust her,
and I don't believe her.

603
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,905
No matter what Muir says.

604
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,987
I feel peculiar.

605
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,571
Queer almost.

606
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,906
What'? Since when?

607
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:06,414
I'm tingling all over,
but I feel lovely.

608
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,074
I feel lovely.

609
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,497
How's your gout'?

610
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:11,912
Gout?

611
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:16,215
It's a bit better.

612
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,421
And my cough.

613
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,427
You know,

614
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,926
this is her doing.

615
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,257
How much have
you had to drink?

616
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,175
No, it was the mushrooms.

617
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:30,930
Send a log downstream.

618
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,102
With hump for tramel
The scripture's camel

619
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:39,193
Still fleecing us out
of our bevvy, huntsman?

620
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,697
What do you say
we let bygones be bygones?

621
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,612
Not yet, nut-hook.

622
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:51,785
Hug.

623
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:54,579
Come fill your glasses
for another round

624
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,794
ls iomai sli sin
Do bhios ag daoine

625
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,459
So what's in it for you?

626
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:02,087
What are you talking about?

627
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,055
I'm talking about the girl.

628
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:10,599
Come fill your glasses
for another round

629
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:13,310
Is it really
just the gold?

630
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,146
I'm not sure, Beith.

631
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:20,188
If I had any sense, I'd have
abandoned her long ago.

632
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,649
Muir says she's destined.

633
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,910
Question is, huntsman,

634
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:27,950
for what?

635
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:29,660
Hmm?

636
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:01,372
Get up.

637
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:21,813
Father? What was that? Father?

638
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,944
I know, son, I know.

639
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:25,779
It's him.

640
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,633
No, no, no, huntsman.

641
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:31,174
No one's ever
seen this before.

642
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,714
The white hart bows before
the Princess, Father.

643
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,214
He's blessing her.

644
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:12,336
What are you talking about?

645
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:15,886
You have eyes, huntsman,
but you do not see.

646
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,843
You, who have been
with her the longest.

647
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,680
She is life itself.

648
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,481
She will heal the land.

649
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:27,060
She is the one.

650
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:35,903
Can't you feel it?
Are your ailments not gone?

651
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:38,492
Gold or no gold,

652
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,498
where she leads,
I follow.

653
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:42,909
Aye.
I'm with you'

654
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,076
Yes, Father.

655
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,007
Ambush!

656
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,211
Aim low! Aim low!

657
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:06,473
Coll, Duir, take him.

658
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:09,769
Gus, go with her.

659
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,405
Stay with me.
Don't you wait for me.

660
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,044
You first.

661
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,088
I know.

662
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:52,603
Go. That way.

663
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,192
Go, go!

664
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,379
No, no, it's me!
It's William.

665
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:53,918
It's William.

666
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:11,224
I admire your fight,
huntsman.

667
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,065
Your wife was the same.

668
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:16,570
What do you know
of my wife?

669
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,072
I remember them all.

670
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:22,823
But especially

671
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:26,075
the ones with fight.

672
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,585
She screamed your name,

673
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:35,001
but you weren't there.

674
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:48,344
Now, you can beg her
forgiveness in the Otherworld.

675
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:07,992
Sister,

676
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,915
heal me.

677
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,048
Forgive me, brother.

678
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:32,642
I feel...

679
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:02,709
Arrow!

680
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,525
Gus. Gus!

681
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,866
Gus, breathe.
Gus, breathe.

682
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,381
I won't leave you, miss.

683
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,727
We used to have pride.

684
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,889
And now we just
pilfer and drink

685
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,267
and dream about
when we didn't.

686
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:47,941
Every man here would die for the
chance of becoming that man again.

687
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,614
So, we follow you, Princess,

688
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:54,075
in life and in death.

689
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:56,240
And we shall
have our pride again.

690
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:01,041
On Gus's soul,
this I swear.

691
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:23,064
Dark the stars
And dark the moon

692
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:31,325
Hush the night
And the morning loon

693
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:38,746
Tell the horses
And beat on your drum

694
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:45,506
Gone their master
Gone their sun

695
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:53,347
Dark the oceans
Dark the sky

696
01:24:54,089 --> 01:25:00,062
Hush the whales
And the ocean tide

697
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:08,279
Tell the salt marsh
And beat on your drum

698
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:12,737
Gone their master

699
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:16,946
Gone their sun

700
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:25,793
Dark to light
And light to dark

701
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:33,258
Three black carriages
Three white carts

702
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:43,565
What brings us together's
What pulls us apart

703
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:54,659
Gone our brother
Gone our heart

704
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,112
I'm sorry I left you.

705
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,328
You didn't.

706
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:06,370
If I'd have thought
you were alive,

707
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:08,538
I would have come for you.

708
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,128
We were children, William.

709
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,757
You're here now.

710
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:37,239
Hush the whales
And the ocean tide

711
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:46,703
Tell the salt marsh
And beat on your drum

712
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:56,971
Gone their master
Gone their sun

713
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:33,207
Here.

714
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:53,063
She hasn't changed.

715
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,739
She has that same
light inside her.

716
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,534
You must see it.

717
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,954
You'd be blind
if you didn't.

718
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:16,550
Thought about her every
day since I lost her.

719
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,597
I can hardly believe
I found her.

720
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:27,352
You should tell her
how you feel.

721
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:28,474
It'd be good for her.

722
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:29,554
No.

723
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,932
I wouldn't know how.

724
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:36,653
Your not telling someone
something like that

725
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:39,740
and living with the regret

726
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,238
is a lot worse.

727
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:07,722
William.

728
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:13,477
It's as if nothing's
changed here.

729
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:18,069
The world seems

730
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:19,696
beautiful again.

731
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:20,947
It Will be,

732
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:23,575
when you are queen.

733
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,614
The people of this kingdom
hate Ravenna with every fiber.

734
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:32,455
I used to hate her.

735
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:36,204
But now I feel only sorrow.

736
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:38,715
Once people
find out you're alive,

737
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,042
they will rise up
in your name.

738
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,212
It takes more
than a name.

739
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,675
You are
your father's daughter.

740
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:49,843
The rightful heir.

741
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:53,889
If I had a choice,
I'd take you far away.

742
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:59,486
Keep you safe by my side.

743
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:03,737
But I have a duty.
And so do you.

744
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,326
How do I inspire?

745
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:09,829
How will I lead men?

746
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:14,076
The way you led me
when we were children.

747
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:17,829
I followed you everywhere.

748
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,959
Iran when you called.

749
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:26,176
I would have done
anything for you.

750
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,557
That's not
how I remember it.

751
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:32,014
No?
No.

752
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:35,893
And we used to fight
all the time.

753
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,566
And argue.

754
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,425
Do you remember that trick?

755
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:10,177
What trick?

756
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:39,502
You see, child,

757
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:43,961
love always betrays us.

758
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:03,310
Wake up.

759
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:40,226
By fairest blood
it was done,

760
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:44,977
and only by fairest blood

761
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,605
can it be undone.

762
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:53,744
You were the only one

763
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:57,406
who could break the spell
and destroy me.

764
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:09,375
And the only one

765
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:11,510
pure enough

766
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:15,135
to save me.

767
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:21,810
You don't even realize
how lucky you are

768
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:25,350
never to know
what it is to grow old.

769
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:26,643
NO!

770
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:53,174
No.

771
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:12,235
No. No.

772
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:18,696
What are you looking at'?
Do something!

773
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:20,409
You're dwarves, healers.

774
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:22,666
Save her. Help her.

775
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:30,916
No. This cannot be.

776
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:39,592
Please, please.

777
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:22,638
Please.

778
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:27,480
What do we do, Beith?

779
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:30,191
What we promised.

780
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:38,569
Well, here you are.

781
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:42,445
All dressed up,
like you're about to

782
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:44,609
wake up and give me
more grief. Am I right'?

783
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:57,964
You deserved better.

784
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:04,880
I once had a wife,
Princess.

785
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:10,305
Sara was her name.

786
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:13,145
When I came back
from the wars,

787
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:15,189
I carried with me
the stench of death

788
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:17,476
and the anger of the lost.

789
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:22,397
I wasn't worth saving, that's for sure.
But she did so anyway.

790
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:26,451
And I loved her so much.

791
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,783
I loved her more than
anyone or anything.

792
01:38:29,946 --> 01:38:33,826
And then I let her out of
my sight and she was gone.

793
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:40,294
And I became myself again.

794
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:42,754
A self I never cared for.

795
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:49,132
Until you.

796
01:38:52,885 --> 01:38:55,104
See, you remind me of her.

797
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,942
Her heart. Her spirit.

798
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:06,365
But now you, too,
have gone'

799
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:10,574
You both deserved better,
and I'm so sorry I failed you.

800
01:39:11,404 --> 01:39:13,031
I'm so sorry.

801
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:23,541
But you'll be a queen
in heaven now

802
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:26,340
and sit among the angels.

803
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:16,177
She died for us!

804
01:40:16,802 --> 01:40:18,395
For our cause!

805
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:20,431
We cannot just hide
behind these walls

806
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:22,475
and watch this land
die with her!

807
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:25,645
Your grief clouds
your judgment, my son.

808
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:30,737
My grief makes me
see clearer, Father.

809
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:36,948
My duty is to protect those
people who come to me for help.

810
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:40,709
I will defend them
to the last drop of my blood,

811
01:40:41,786 --> 01:40:44,039
but I will not
abandon these walls.

812
01:41:05,184 --> 01:41:07,061
The spell is lifted.

813
01:41:38,467 --> 01:41:40,060
Death has favored you.

814
01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:41,937
Death favors no man.

815
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:43,977
We must ride

816
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:47,519
like thundering waves under the
tattered battle flag of my father.

817
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:49,104
You must rest.

818
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,114
We have rested
long enough.

819
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:03,709
Frost to fire and fire to frost.

820
01:42:08,748 --> 01:42:10,716
Iron will melt.

821
01:42:14,253 --> 01:42:17,382
But it will writhe
inside of itself!

822
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:21,476
All these years

823
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,646
all I've known is darkness.

824
01:42:26,891 --> 01:42:30,566
But I have never seen a brighter
light than when my eyes just opened.

825
01:42:32,438 --> 01:42:35,567
And I know that light
burns in all of you!

826
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:38,910
Those embers

827
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:41,910
must turn to flame.

828
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:46,460
Iron into sword!

829
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:48,579
I will become your weapon!

830
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,002
Forged by the fierce fire

831
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:53,293
that I know is
in your hearts!

832
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:57,797
For I have seen
what she sees.

833
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,638
I know what she knows.

834
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:05,934
I can kill her.

835
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:11,777
And I'd rather die today

836
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:16,149
than live another day
of this death!

837
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:20,953
And who will ride with me'?

838
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,034
Who will be my brother?

839
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:25,124
Aye!

840
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:13,498
Farewell, Princess.

841
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,031
Where are they?

842
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:40,908
Amassed on the cliffs.

843
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:43,034
Their numbers
have swollen.

844
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:46,113
They say the King's
standard flies again.

845
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:48,619
Then let them come.

846
01:44:49,366 --> 01:44:53,587
And let them break their
skulls on these stone walls

847
01:44:53,954 --> 01:44:56,207
and bring me my prize.

848
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:13,770
My lord,

849
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:16,064
we only have a few hours
before the tide comes in.

850
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:18,400
Not long enough
to breach the castle walls.

851
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:19,984
Is there no other way in?

852
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:21,444
There is another way.

853
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:27,492
Hi-ho, lads,
it's off to work.

854
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:30,534
If he starts whistling,
I'll smash his face in.

855
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:36,580
YES.

856
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:38,833
We're promised gold
and what do we get'?

857
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:40,091
POO!

858
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:42,049
How low has
the dwarf race sunk?

859
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:46,636
That looks like one of mine.

860
01:45:46,966 --> 01:45:47,967
Hold this!

861
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:11,244
All right.

862
01:46:11,323 --> 01:46:13,075
The gatehouse
is 50 yards to the right.

863
01:46:13,242 --> 01:46:14,960
And there's a whole
army out there.

864
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:17,334
Six dwarves
against an army?

865
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:19,999
I like them odds.

866
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:24,595
We must ride now.
The portcullis will be open.

867
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:33,930
So, you're back from the dead
and instigating the masses.

868
01:46:37,808 --> 01:46:40,027
You look very
fetching in mail.

869
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:45,945
We ride!

870
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:53,784
All right.
We move as one.

871
01:46:58,287 --> 01:46:59,504
After you.

872
01:47:14,637 --> 01:47:17,481
Hey, go, go,go

873
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:36,768
Sorry.

874
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:41,890
What's happening, Coll'?

875
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:43,313
They're on the beach!

876
01:48:50,065 --> 01:48:51,282
Release!

877
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:34,151
Ready! Release!

878
01:49:39,156 --> 01:49:40,328
Release!

879
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:57,182
Go, go, 90!

880
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:02,596
The summit's breached!

881
01:50:09,686 --> 01:50:11,029
Back here, lads!
Come on!

882
01:50:11,188 --> 01:50:12,690
Get back to it!

883
01:50:25,702 --> 01:50:27,670
Pull!
Nion, get on that rope!

884
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:29,582
Come on!
Go on!

885
01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:31,754
Quert!

886
01:50:34,253 --> 01:50:35,300
It's a massacre
down there!

887
01:50:35,379 --> 01:50:37,177
Gort, on that rope!

888
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:40,392
We must turn back!

889
01:50:40,676 --> 01:50:43,179
No! I gave them my word!

890
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:44,688
It's over!
Get on now!

891
01:50:49,893 --> 01:50:50,894
She's moving.

892
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:53,613
You done it, lads!

893
01:50:59,027 --> 01:51:00,700
Charge!

894
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:02,322
Ya!

895
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:14,835
Form! Form!

896
01:53:01,275 --> 01:53:02,697
William!

897
01:55:27,212 --> 01:55:30,512
Come and avenge
your father

898
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:34,599
who was too weak
to raise his sword.

899
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:40,816
Ah.

900
01:55:53,864 --> 01:55:54,865
Go on.

901
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:58,452
Watch them die.

902
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:16,224
How does it feel,

903
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:19,230
knowing you were the one who
led them to their deaths?

904
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:20,640
You see?

905
01:56:20,724 --> 01:56:23,443
We're not that different,
are we?

906
01:56:26,104 --> 01:56:27,731
I'm everything you're not.

907
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:53,800
You cannot defeat me!

908
01:56:54,925 --> 01:56:58,054
I've lived too many lives.

909
01:56:58,470 --> 01:57:00,939
Ravaged entire kingdoms.

910
01:57:01,348 --> 01:57:05,478
I have been given powers that
you could not even fathom!

911
01:57:08,271 --> 01:57:09,693
I will never stop.

912
01:57:11,107 --> 01:57:12,529
Never

913
01:57:14,653 --> 01:57:17,281
I will give
this wretched world

914
01:57:17,447 --> 01:57:21,873
the queen it deserves.

915
01:57:26,623 --> 01:57:29,672
By fairest blood,
it is done!

916
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:49,479
And only by fairest
blood is it undone.

917
01:58:46,161 --> 01:58:48,539
You can't have my heart.

918
02:00:00,402 --> 02:00:04,327
In the name of all that
is good and just in this land

919
02:00:04,489 --> 02:00:06,457
I crown you queen.

920
02:00:49,075 --> 02:00:50,622
Hail to the Queen!

921
02:00:51,411 --> 02:00:53,288
Hail to the Queen!

922
02:00:53,663 --> 02:00:55,336
Hail to the Queen!

923
02:00:55,665 --> 02:00:57,338
Hail to the Queen!

924
02:00:57,667 --> 02:00:59,669
Hail to the Queen!
