1
00:01:16,222 --> 00:01:20,257
Yo, we're gonna look for dead
bodies at the Seneda warehouse.

2
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:22,393
You wanna come?

3
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:26,097
What will you do if you
<i>actually</i> find a dead body?

4
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,667
Roll it over!

5
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:32,870
Yeah, we'll probably
roll it over.

6
00:01:32,872 --> 00:01:35,239
Are you going into forensics?

7
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:38,542
Why would we go there?

8
00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:40,377
I think we're just gonna
stay here.

9
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:44,115
Yeah.

10
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:46,450
Suit yourselves.

11
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:53,290
Hammer toss!

12
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:05,469
Oh, shit! Hold up.
Extra large slush puppies?

13
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:07,338
Really?

14
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,206
You know, I don't care what they
say, you guys know how to party.

15
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:12,510
Seriously. Seriously.

16
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:13,878
I hate this town.

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,148
Are you kidding me, man!

18
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,251
Whatever drugs everyone is on
seem to be working pretty well.

19
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:24,188
Is this the big reward?

20
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,823
I mean, did we really
not get invited...

21
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:27,658
To any graduation parties?

22
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,461
Come on, if you don't get
invited to a single party...

23
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:33,597
For four years straight, you
don't generally get invited...

24
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,833
Yeah, well, it's graduation, you
graduate together as a class...

25
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:37,301
So you'd think after...

26
00:02:37,303 --> 00:02:38,936
Dude, we traded cool
for college.

27
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:41,372
Yeah, i...

28
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:43,240
All I'm saying is, I'm looking
at this thing...

29
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:46,577
And I don't feel as good
as the people out there.

30
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:48,212
We're just sitting here.

31
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:49,513
Bro, what were you expecting?

32
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:54,618
I don't know. Something cool.

33
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,291
I'll just take us home.

34
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,000
Hello, Andy.

35
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:44,969
Hey, Yaco.

36
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:47,738
Have you been looking forward
to another summer...

37
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,707
As much as I have?

38
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,776
Last year you were only
a janitor.

39
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:55,446
Groundskeeper, actually.

40
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:58,449
But this year you're a pro!

41
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:01,719
You realize this could only
happen with my blessing.

42
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:06,523
You are my beggar apostle
and I am your Christ.

43
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:09,293
Well, I appreciate you putting
in a good word with the board.

44
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:11,996
After lunch, you'll be teaching
the beginner ladies classes...

45
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:14,765
And Salvatore will be handling
the men.

46
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:17,868
Okay, cool.

47
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,304
Any tips for the new guy?

48
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:22,573
Do not let the women chat
with each other.

49
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:26,944
Once they start, they learn
nothing.

50
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:30,547
You have to be a man.

51
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:34,285
Yeah, my dad says that, too.

52
00:05:17,963 --> 00:05:20,798
Muay Thai, punch!

53
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,033
Guys, in the
post-apocalyptic future,

54
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:25,636
in which we survive by
eating cats and the elderly,

55
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:29,106
you will need to know how
to punch. Stop smiling.

56
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:31,942
In the future, smiling will
be seen as a sign

57
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:36,413
you wish to be eaten. Hai!

58
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:41,785
As a parting thought...

59
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:46,757
Remember, the prickliest
cactus can still give you water.

60
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,792
Class dismissed.

61
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:53,864
What did that cactus mean?

62
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:55,632
What do you think it means?

63
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:58,569
Something scary can be good?

64
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:01,905
That's right. Don't be afraid
of something for how it looks...

65
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:03,974
Because it might be special
inside.

66
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:05,976
Hey, you!
Hi!

67
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,780
Oh... olive,
you know this lady?

68
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:11,014
She's my cousin!

69
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,750
Hey, hey, I'm just making sure.

70
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:15,052
Rival Dojos are trying to steal
my students all the time...

71
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:16,887
Because you're the best.

72
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,523
I'm Tinsley. Olive's
mom asked me to pick her up.

73
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:22,059
How's it going? I'm the lion.

74
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:23,994
I haven't seen you before.

75
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,896
Yeah, I come here every summer.

76
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:27,164
I haven't seen you before.

77
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,966
Oh yeah, I'm one of the locals.

78
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:32,035
Oh, wow, I don't
think I've ever met a local.

79
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,904
They hide us
during the summer...

80
00:06:33,906 --> 00:06:36,173
So we don't upset the tourists.

81
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:38,008
The lion should come to your
party.

82
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,477
Yes, I'm having
a party at my parent's house...

83
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,579
On the point this afternoon.
You should come!

84
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:46,049
I'm sorry, are you
inviting me to a party?

85
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:47,151
Yeah, I am.

86
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,953
But... but, I'm me.

87
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:51,422
You can bring whoever you want.

88
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:53,490
I'll see you later today.
Bye.

89
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:55,692
- Take care.
- Thank you!

90
00:06:55,694 --> 00:06:56,827
See you, guys.
Was that fun?

91
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:57,928
Yeah!

92
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,164
Oh!

93
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,732
You are the man, lion!

94
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:03,801
Good looks! Good looks!

95
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:08,205
Wow, you weren't even
nervous, bro. I'm all right.

96
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:09,740
No, I was pretty nervous.

97
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:13,143
So, Andy, have
you heard anything...

98
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:14,778
From your imaginary
Indian pen pal?

99
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,481
Yes, she actually
wants to come to the cape...

100
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:18,882
In August before
she goes to UCLA.

101
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:20,784
Whoa...

102
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:22,953
But apparently, it's $2,000
to get her here from Mumbai...

103
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:24,888
In the summer, so I want
to figure out a way to help.

104
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,723
So, out of curiosity,
when she emails you...

105
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:29,593
Does it go to your spam folder
and you have to drag it out?

106
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:32,596
Yeah, sometimes, because
she's from a far away place.

107
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:34,565
Uh, okay, have you guys
skyped at all?

108
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:38,135
No, she's from a remote area
and her family's computer...

109
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:40,137
Doesn't have a working camera.

110
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,774
It's not a scheme, you guys,
okay? She's exists!

111
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:46,643
Bro, I still don't entirely
understand how you met her.

112
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:49,079
I told you a million times,
she's an econ nerd, too...

113
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:51,915
She posts comments on a website
that I read and I emailed her...

114
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:53,684
That I liked her ideas
and we hit it off.

115
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:55,085
It's your murderer...

116
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:56,620
These are the last months
of your life, bro.

117
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:58,922
Let's say that this girl
is real.

118
00:07:58,924 --> 00:08:01,525
She's gonna have way more
experience than you.

119
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:04,528
Okay, Cleopatra,
how do you know that?

120
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,597
Under what scenario could a
human being on this earth...

121
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,198
Not have more
experience than you?

122
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,133
I've been... I've
done... I've done things.

123
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,768
Oh, and India
has the Kama Sutra, bro.

124
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,670
Exactly! India
has the Kama Sutra.

125
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:15,873
Yeah, they like, fuck
sideways and shit, bro.

126
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,675
That's intimidating for anybody.
It is.

127
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:21,578
I'm not intimidated.

128
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,785
Did that shirt
shrink in the wash?

129
00:08:28,787 --> 00:08:31,288
No, I don't know, I can't really
figure out what happened.

130
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,823
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

131
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,558
Oh, yes! Sweet!
Wow, crazy!

132
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,693
Just a little something new
I'm working with.

133
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:38,729
If I can't impress my friends,
there's no way I'm gonna...

134
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:40,197
Be impressing the
food network, so... dig in!

135
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:41,965
Oh, yeah, this looks great.
Guys, guys, guys...

136
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,101
I waited until
we were all together...

137
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:48,205
To bring this up,
but I have information.

138
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:49,806
About what?

139
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:52,009
About a party on the point.

140
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,978
To be specific, I have
an invitation to a party...

141
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,048
On the point this afternoon
and I can bring anyone I want!

142
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,017
Okay, calm down.
Who invited you to the point?

143
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,019
I've never been on the point.
Yeah, me, neither.

144
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:05,556
You're sure this is true? We're
invited to an actual party?

145
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:08,725
Bro, bro, bro, no, it's real!

146
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:11,128
And it starts today
and goes all night!

147
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,163
I'm assuming, I'm assuming.

148
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:15,666
I don't know, man, I gotta
finish up here after lunch.

149
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:17,200
I have an 11:00 o'clock
curfew...

150
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:18,802
So it's like it doesn't
even make sense to go.

151
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:20,571
Two "no's" immediately
from the group!

152
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:22,573
I mean, you're going to Harvard,
why do you need a curfew?

153
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:25,175
Curfews are for riot zones
and crumbling dictatorships...

154
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:26,243
Not for us!

155
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:28,045
Dramatic.

156
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:30,180
Lion, what would happen if
you missed your curfew today?

157
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:33,050
Huh? You're going to
Mit on scholarship.

158
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,018
You know, my parents actually
don't get home...

159
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,787
Until like 4:00 am
most weekends.

160
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:39,790
I'm starting to think
they're swingers, man.

161
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,593
Stanford-bound spice, you?

162
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:44,328
I've been here until 2:00
before.

163
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,896
My parents will probably
just think I'm here.

164
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:48,098
There you go.
What are you trying to say, bro?

165
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,236
- Andy!
- Dude!

166
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:54,638
Whoo!
Whoo!

167
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,039
You know I have
to clean that up, right?

168
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,374
That was badass! Yes!
Yeah! Yes!

169
00:09:57,376 --> 00:09:58,842
Breaking stuff!

170
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:00,611
You know I work here, don't you?

171
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,346
I'm sorry about the glass,
I'm trying to make a point.

172
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:04,014
The reason that we never
partied in high school...

173
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:06,116
Is because we wanted
to get out of here.

174
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:08,919
And now we are! And I feel
like I missed out on some...

175
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:11,254
Experiences and I
know you guys do, too.

176
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:12,923
Lion, what do you
wish you'd done?

177
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:17,327
Uh... ancient Asians
took this mushroom called...

178
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,097
Fly Agaric, by feeding
it to reindeer and drinking...

179
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:21,298
Its urine for
psychedelic effects.

180
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,933
What?

181
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:25,235
You're talking
about doing some drugs?

182
00:10:25,237 --> 00:10:26,770
Put some drugs in you!

183
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:28,705
Nora, what do you want to do?

184
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:32,242
Uh, I think it would have
been cool to have a boyfriend.

185
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:34,778
Why are you laughing?

186
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,647
I don't... I don't think
we knew that.

187
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:38,148
It's not that uncommon a thing.

188
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,150
Go get yourself a boyfriend!

189
00:10:40,152 --> 00:10:43,153
Wow, thank you
for your approval, Andy.

190
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:45,255
Spice? Talk to me.

191
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:48,358
You know, I'm ready
to hook up with a girl.

192
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,260
Mm-hm.
I need release.

193
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:51,428
Release, release!
Say no more.

194
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,729
Thank you.
We know what that means.

195
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:54,398
Yeah, I do.

196
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,366
What I'm saying, is this
afternoon, starting at this...

197
00:10:56,368 --> 00:10:59,770
Party, we do all the things
that we wish we'd done...

198
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:01,972
The last four years.

199
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:06,743
Drinking, drugs, sex...
With girls.

200
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:10,981
Release yourself! Relationships!
I want hard miles!

201
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:12,816
I don't want to go to college
as some lamb...

202
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:14,117
Being led to slaughter.

203
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:16,386
I don't want to be
boring anymore.

204
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:19,423
From now on, this is the
summer of "yes!"

205
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:22,025
Let's just say, "yes!"

206
00:11:22,027 --> 00:11:23,360
Say, "yes!"
Yes!

207
00:11:23,362 --> 00:11:25,028
Say, "yes!"
Yes!

208
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,963
Spice?
Hell, yeah.

209
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:28,732
Yeah!

210
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:33,203
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes!

211
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:38,241
All right, welcome to summer!

212
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:41,712
Okay, Gabby, here we go.

213
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:43,246
Whoa, Gabby!

214
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:45,182
Oh! That's it!

215
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:47,217
I love your visor, Mrs. Jones.

216
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:48,852
Here's our star player
right here.

217
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:51,021
- This is our star tennis player.
- Whoo!

218
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:53,790
You just dance around the court.

219
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,926
That winter was too long, huh?

220
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:57,427
Uh-huh!
Too long.

221
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:01,765
Nice! Strong!
Beautiful stroke.

222
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:04,434
That's way over there,
that's a bench shot.

223
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:06,470
We'll give you a couple points
for hitting the bench.

224
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:08,839
Okay, Gabby, here we go.

225
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:14,344
Now, Gabby, you're doing this,
right?

226
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:18,381
And we're going to need more of
just sort of like a this, right?

227
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:27,023
Good group, great group, wow.

228
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:31,361
Andy?
Yeah?

229
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:33,363
When did you turn 18?

230
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:34,765
Uh, January.

231
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,166
Happy birthday.

232
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:37,618
It was, uh...

233
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:39,069
You know what? You should
come over for drinks sometime.

234
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:41,972
18 is the drinking
age in most of the world.

235
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:44,441
I should have been born foreign.

236
00:12:44,443 --> 00:12:47,277
Being a tennis pro
automatically makes you foreign.

237
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,847
Well, then,<i> c'est parfait.</i>

238
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:53,517
You're not!

239
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,352
Thinking.

240
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,224
Andy, do you teach private
tennis lessons?

241
00:13:01,226 --> 00:13:03,960
Don't all pros?

242
00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:07,063
In my experience.

243
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,834
Hm...

244
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:46,303
Why in the world would Danya
be sending bikini pictures...

245
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:48,839
To you that early in the morning
on a Sunday, bro?

246
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:51,575
She is an insomniac,
that's why...

247
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:54,077
And it's not unusual
for her to email me late.

248
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,413
You are so talking to
a guy sitting in his attic...

249
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:58,281
In Worchester wearing
clown makeup.

250
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:01,885
Let's do this, guys.

251
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:04,187
Here we go.

252
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:10,160
Let me see. Right here,
the lion, great.

253
00:14:10,162 --> 00:14:14,598
Hey, you guys have a good time,
be safe, okay? We'll see ya.

254
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,266
All right.
Thank you.

255
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:17,567
Okay!

256
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:21,905
We're gonna go to a party!

257
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:34,434
I just think that this...

258
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:36,318
It's crazy that this is in our
town, you know what I mean?

259
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:38,188
I know, that this
actually exists here...

260
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,090
Like minutes away from us.

261
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:41,224
Right.
Whoa.

262
00:14:41,226 --> 00:14:43,143
It's like if
George Washington...

263
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:45,504
And Norman Rockwell fucked and
had kids and they had houses.

264
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:48,231
Oh, dude!

265
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:50,200
I finally know
how bad our lives suck.

266
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:55,505
This is crazy.

267
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:56,573
Massive.

268
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:59,109
That is a
shitload of individuals.

269
00:14:59,111 --> 00:15:01,211
Can I just park here?

270
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:03,914
If you're going
to park here, Andy...

271
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,182
You have to be really careful,
seriously!

272
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:08,084
He's gonna hit...
I'm not gonna hit anything.

273
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:10,453
What a nice spot we got!

274
00:15:12,457 --> 00:15:15,158
Should we like kick it
for five or 20 minutes?

275
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,961
No, we're going in.

276
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:19,429
Just say, "yes."

277
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,401
Say, "yes."

278
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:34,344
Wow, I am a prairie dog
in heaven right now.

279
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:39,215
I don't know what to do
with my hands.

280
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:45,622
I think... should we just go...

281
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:47,090
Yeah, we go right in there,
right?

282
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:48,558
Everybody's, yeah...

283
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,363
Hey, oh, nice, so,
where are the drinks?

284
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,566
Yes.
Right.

285
00:15:56,568 --> 00:15:58,068
I feel like I
could have told you that.

286
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,004
You the man, bro. Okay.
Do they have beers, too?

287
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:26,329
We don't belong here.

288
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:27,881
Yes, we do.

289
00:16:27,882 --> 00:16:29,432
All right, we're just
uncomfortable...

290
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:32,135
Because we don't have drinks
in our hands.

291
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:34,137
Let's go.

292
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,314
The drinks are up there.

293
00:16:57,396 --> 00:16:59,763
What are you doing?
No idea!

294
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:04,367
Ooh, shoot.

295
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:08,538
Okay... okay... drinks.

296
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,542
Starting now,
"yes" to everything.

297
00:17:12,544 --> 00:17:14,477
Yes!
Yes!

298
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:16,746
Yes!

299
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,087
Dude, I'm gonna...

300
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:29,726
It's like fire in my body.

301
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:31,094
I'm gonna throw up!

302
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:33,563
There's a fire in my body.

303
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:40,236
No, seriously, I wouldn't
lie about Midgetville.

304
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:41,771
And for the record, we wish it
was called something else...

305
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:45,642
Too, but... maybe we can
be the change.

306
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:50,113
I don't know what I'm saying.

307
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:51,714
These guys are different.

308
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:56,119
Dragon.

309
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,387
Oh...

310
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:59,155
Rahrr...

311
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:07,597
Nora! Thought I saw you.
Come on！

312
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,466
No, I don't... I don't...
Come on.

313
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:13,369
Of course, I do,
because it's the summer of yes.

314
00:18:14,806 --> 00:18:16,272
So pretty.

315
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:18,208
You have that right.
Tinsley, this is Nora.

316
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,609
Hey.
Hi.

317
00:18:19,611 --> 00:18:21,111
Hi, Tinsley.
We work at the lab together.

318
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:22,178
Thank you. Oh...

319
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:30,820
Well, that's so... you're here,
we're both here, that...

320
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:33,323
Yeah, I'm staying down
the road with some friends...

321
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:35,291
And their son dragged me along.
Oh, cool.

322
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:37,427
I think I'm the oldest
person here by about ten years.

323
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:42,232
I love your dress, by the way.
Oh.

324
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:44,400
God, I wish I had boobs
like yours.

325
00:18:48,907 --> 00:18:51,057
Hmm.

326
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,208
There's no way, it's the hardest
dessert to make in the world.

327
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:57,380
No, I'm telling you, spice could
make a soufflé right now...

328
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:59,215
And it would be delicious.

329
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:01,851
It would instantly
collapse. This party's loud.

330
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:04,821
No, no, okay, I bet you $100...

331
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:08,258
$100 that I could
make a soufflé right now...

332
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,193
And it'll stay standing,
it will not collapse.

333
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:13,630
You're on.

334
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:16,666
$100?

335
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,403
Hey, give me those mitts!
Is that flour?

336
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:22,172
Oh, that's cocaine!

337
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:23,806
What are your
hidden talents, Andy?

338
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:26,643
My hidden talents...
Well, it's pretty useless...

339
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:33,483
But I can catch food thrown
from any distance, in my mouth.

340
00:19:33,485 --> 00:19:37,854
Mmm, okay.

341
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:40,890
Oh, you're gonna do it? Okay.

342
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:46,429
You can go bigger than that.

343
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:49,464
Okay, wait, okay, I'm not...
I'm serious...

344
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:52,202
I'm not messing around
right now! Come on!

345
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:59,742
I catch stuff!
I catch stuff in my mouth!

346
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:02,312
I catch marshmallows
in my mouth! Woo!

347
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:11,654
Is he doing, high Tai chi?

348
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:14,524
"High chi?"

349
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:23,566
Just say, "yes?"

350
00:20:23,568 --> 00:20:27,003
Summer of yes, this is good,
this is good.

351
00:20:29,274 --> 00:20:30,974
I don't like cold water...

352
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:33,643
So, maybe we can
take our clothes off inside.

353
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:37,814
Oh... yes... yes.

354
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:43,486
It has risen!

355
00:20:43,488 --> 00:20:45,722
I am the greatest chef
on this planet!

356
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:53,696
Consider comping the check?

357
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:56,833
We can think of something.

358
00:20:57,802 --> 00:20:59,802
Take off those mittens.

359
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:12,915
Hey.

360
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:18,655
Hi.

361
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:21,724
I think this is the part where
you take your clothes off, too.

362
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:25,061
Yeah, me, yeah.

363
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:31,534
You're like freakishly tall,
huh?

364
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:32,568
Yeah.

365
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:39,909
That's a really cool bag.
Or is it a clutch? Or...

366
00:21:43,615 --> 00:21:45,381
You haven't done this before,
have you?

367
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:47,784
No.

368
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:52,455
And I actually need like 10,000
practice hours before August.

369
00:21:52,457 --> 00:21:54,557
Malcolm Gladwell, outliers?

370
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,793
Yeah, I need to be an expert.

371
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:57,994
Why?

372
00:21:57,996 --> 00:22:01,864
I have this Indian
girl coming to visit me.

373
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:03,966
They have the Kama Sutra.

374
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:07,437
I... exactly.

375
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:11,708
But, I'm sorry, I'm like talking
about another girl and...

376
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,811
On the bed... now!

377
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,948
Yes... on the bed.

378
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:28,358
Relax.

379
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,693
We can at least knock a couple
of minutes...

380
00:22:30,695 --> 00:22:32,795
Off those 10,000 hours.

381
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:41,637
Are you gonna keep doing
that face?

382
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,152
I know, it's... I feel like
making out on the beach...

383
00:22:56,154 --> 00:22:58,621
Is less comfortable than it
looks on TV.

384
00:22:58,623 --> 00:23:01,090
Yeah. Your body is amazing.

385
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:02,692
Really?
Yes!

386
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:04,961
Whoa, thank you. That's new.

387
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:07,163
Yeah?
Yeah.

388
00:23:18,843 --> 00:23:22,879
I understand what you want, but
I'm not a hand job machine!

389
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:24,580
I have to feel special about
someone...

390
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:27,016
Before I give them a hand job.

391
00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:30,119
I thought the soufflé
was special.

392
00:23:30,121 --> 00:23:32,655
If you had tried some
subtlety...

393
00:23:32,657 --> 00:23:34,857
Instead of moving your hips
all creepily...

394
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:37,160
You would have got one.

395
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:40,029
But...

396
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:41,864
Go fuck your soufflé!

397
00:23:44,836 --> 00:23:48,137
Where have you been?
We have been worried!

398
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:49,739
Sorry.

399
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:51,574
What have you been up
to tonight?

400
00:23:52,944 --> 00:23:56,979
Not too much... goodnight.

401
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,004
Please just send me to my room.

402
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:58,674
Thank you.

403
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,846
What do you think happened
to him?

404
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:05,882
I don't know, but I'm jealous.

405
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:21,964
Oh, jeez, feel free to pass me
a new skull, man, honestly.

406
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:25,535
Yeah, no, I can feel my brain
decaying lobe by lobe.

407
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:27,003
Andy, hey, Andy!

408
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:31,207
Dude. Oh!

409
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:34,310
That's what I'm talking about.

410
00:25:34,312 --> 00:25:36,979
Why are people
throwing food at you?

411
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:39,181
Oh, you were skinny dipping
with a 30-year-old man...

412
00:25:39,183 --> 00:25:40,550
During my performance.

413
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:41,884
It was glorious.

414
00:25:41,886 --> 00:25:43,886
When did you get a body, anyway?
Last night.

415
00:25:43,888 --> 00:25:47,790
Hmm, that's pretty
crazy. You're finally a girl.

416
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,258
Thank you.

417
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,294
Must have been awkward
today with your coworker.

418
00:25:51,296 --> 00:25:54,997
No, no, we're gonna actually
hang out again later this week.

419
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:56,198
Alone?

420
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,602
Yeah... summer of yes.

421
00:26:01,105 --> 00:26:03,272
Are you hanging out
with anybody alone, lion?

422
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:06,776
Oh, uh, just some guys
who have an opium connection.

423
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:09,078
Well, you guys had fun...

424
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,881
I don't think that girl
wants to see me again.

425
00:26:11,883 --> 00:26:13,916
No release?

426
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:16,469
Not a drop.

427
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,021
But I did get us invited
to another party... on a dock.

428
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:21,023
Two rich girls invited me.

429
00:26:21,025 --> 00:26:21,991
Boom.

430
00:26:21,993 --> 00:26:23,192
Round two!
Really?

431
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:24,894
Yeah, man!
Guys, guys?

432
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,762
Have we somehow become cool?

433
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:43,346
Whoa, whoa.
Hey.

434
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:44,947
Hey, you again.

435
00:26:44,949 --> 00:26:47,383
Um, I'm actually here
to teach a lesson.

436
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:49,752
And to pick up my
car from the party.

437
00:26:49,754 --> 00:26:50,820
We walked home.

438
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:52,822
Lion swam, I think.

439
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,759
See ya!

440
00:27:18,349 --> 00:27:21,884
Gabby, it's Andy!
It's lesson time.

441
00:27:39,003 --> 00:27:42,972
Uh, Gabby, are you in here?

442
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:45,241
I'm almost done.

443
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:47,777
I left your money
on the night table.

444
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:49,679
Okay, okay, cool.

445
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:51,013
I'm so glad you could come.

446
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:52,548
Me, too.

447
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:54,082
It's weird, I didn't see
your court coming in here.

448
00:27:54,085 --> 00:27:56,752
That's because
there is no court.

449
00:27:56,754 --> 00:28:01,023
Holy shit! Gabby, wait,
Gabby, what are you doing?

450
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:04,093
Gabby... Gabby!

451
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:06,095
Shut up, Andy.

452
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:07,697
Okay.

453
00:28:21,746 --> 00:28:23,345
Five times?

454
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:25,715
Five times.

455
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:29,151
It's like the olym...
The Olympics or something.

456
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:31,721
The "vagathalon."

457
00:28:39,063 --> 00:28:43,365
Hey, all right. Hey now.

458
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:45,835
What kind of tennis
lesson takes three hours?

459
00:28:45,837 --> 00:28:52,908
Oh, we were just, uh, working
on strokes... techniques.

460
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:57,046
Forehand, backhand... grips.

461
00:28:57,048 --> 00:28:58,814
See ya!

462
00:29:18,903 --> 00:29:21,403
I think the lion is taking acid.

463
00:29:24,342 --> 00:29:28,043
Yeah, he said he wants to
push his body to its limits.

464
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:31,347
Does Tai chi help with fighting?

465
00:29:34,118 --> 00:29:37,219
Bruce Lee once said...

466
00:29:37,221 --> 00:29:40,556
"A wise man can learn more
from a foolish question...

467
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:43,192
"Then a fool can learn
from a wise answer."

468
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:48,130
Have you ever used it to fight?

469
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:55,137
When it's finally
time for me to fight...

470
00:29:56,874 --> 00:29:59,341
I'll know.

471
00:29:59,343 --> 00:30:04,380
Oh jeez, look at that.
Who's this guy?

472
00:30:04,382 --> 00:30:07,149
Is he her boyfriend now
or something?

473
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:11,220
What kind of Australian
is named, Erland?

474
00:30:11,222 --> 00:30:13,189
Who cares, she's happy.

475
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:15,224
He's 12 years older than her.

476
00:30:15,226 --> 00:30:17,092
Yeah, and if I was
30 years old...

477
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:20,329
I'd be wanting to nail
18-year-olds too, man.

478
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:21,931
Guy's a creep.

479
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:23,365
Holy shit!

480
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:24,533
Hm?

481
00:30:24,535 --> 00:30:26,335
You like Nora!

482
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:31,140
I like nor... are you out
of your mind?

483
00:30:31,142 --> 00:30:33,075
She's been my friend
since I was born.

484
00:30:33,077 --> 00:30:35,077
Yeah, and until recently
she's dressed like a guy...

485
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,478
And you've looked like an
acupuncture needle.

486
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,881
You're jealous.

487
00:30:38,883 --> 00:30:43,185
Look, I don't know
what I'm feeling.

488
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:46,589
You poor, sensitive,
tragic soul, you.

489
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:49,258
Three days ago, a 42-year-old
woman paid me...

490
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,459
To have sex with her.

491
00:30:50,461 --> 00:30:51,527
No.

492
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:54,563
Yeah, "private tennis lesson."

493
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:58,467
I've got two more scheduled
with her this week.

494
00:30:58,469 --> 00:31:00,236
How's that for sensitive?

495
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:02,004
Not sensitive at all.
Holy shit, man!

496
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:05,374
You know how I'm gonna prove
to you that Danya is real?

497
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:08,577
I'm gonna fly her out
here myself.

498
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:11,380
I'm gonna put her up in
a fancy bed and breakfast.

499
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:14,116
I'm gonna seduce her
at fine dinners...

500
00:31:14,118 --> 00:31:18,153
That I pay for and
it's gonna be magic.

501
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:19,521
Ha!

502
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:24,326
Now, if you'll excuse me...

503
00:31:24,328 --> 00:31:27,196
I've gotta wash off the sight
of that.

504
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:40,542
Whoo!

505
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,211
Andy!

506
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:47,349
Fuck, yeah!

507
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:53,055
Andy?

508
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:55,557
Victoria! Hey, looking good
out there.

509
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,626
Thanks.

510
00:31:57,628 --> 00:32:02,131
Um, you know, Gabby told me that
you were giving private lessons.

511
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:04,967
$150 an hour, is that right?

512
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:09,371
You... you mean a full lesson?

513
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:14,243
Yeah, a full lesson.

514
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,213
Tomorrow at 4:00, okay?

515
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:23,719
My schedule is open,
I can do it tomorrow, I can...

516
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:26,388
My address is on the call sheet.

517
00:32:32,163 --> 00:32:34,163
What!

518
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:38,734
Oh, you're so
much hotter than my mom!

519
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,145
Yeah!

520
00:32:54,218 --> 00:32:56,618
Oh, my god!

521
00:33:16,674 --> 00:33:19,708
And this.

522
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,044
I will end you... ready?

523
00:33:22,046 --> 00:33:25,080
<i>S'il vous plait!</i>
<i>S'il vous plait...</i> ow!

524
00:33:50,474 --> 00:33:52,341
And this, please.

525
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:57,112
Open that pretty mouth.

526
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:11,660
Another hole-in-one.

527
00:34:11,662 --> 00:34:16,065
Can you please stop using
Qi gong to influence the ball?

528
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:17,699
This isn't fun for us.

529
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:20,169
Andy, Qi gong isn't something
I can just turn on and off.

530
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:24,173
Right, I'm gonna try my hand
at this.

531
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:26,175
Oh, stop traffic.

532
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:29,545
Yes.
Oh, my, thank you.

533
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:31,814
Did you guys pay a hot
girl to follow you around?

534
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:34,216
Great strategy, seriously.

535
00:34:34,218 --> 00:34:35,784
I think that's
Nora Sullivan, dude.

536
00:34:35,786 --> 00:34:38,720
Yes, my name... I'm Nora.

537
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:40,222
Holy shit, you're right.

538
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:42,491
Way to get in early, guys,
seriously...

539
00:34:42,493 --> 00:34:44,626
I like the strategy.
Hey, honestly.

540
00:34:44,628 --> 00:34:45,828
Are you sexually active?

541
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,197
That's so offensive.

542
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,631
You know what, and also,
you guys never talked to us...

543
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:51,366
Before, so you don't really
get to start now.

544
00:34:51,368 --> 00:34:52,534
Can you just fuck off!

545
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:53,635
All right, Nora.

546
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:54,770
Wow.
Okay, all right...

547
00:34:54,772 --> 00:34:56,505
I thought she was quiet,
it's cool.

548
00:34:56,507 --> 00:35:00,142
Okay, we'll catch you guys
on the last hole, all right?

549
00:35:00,144 --> 00:35:01,477
We'll fuck off for now,
we'll be back later.

550
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:03,412
Bye-ee!
Jeez...

551
00:35:03,414 --> 00:35:04,746
God, I hate those guys.

552
00:35:04,748 --> 00:35:06,582
How do they not know
people like us now?

553
00:35:06,584 --> 00:35:08,250
Hey man, it's just
different circles.

554
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:10,252
Hey, speaking of different
circles.

555
00:35:10,254 --> 00:35:12,654
Now how is that "airland" doing?

556
00:35:12,656 --> 00:35:14,389
Erland?
Erland.

557
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:16,558
Does he have talents aside
from being handsome?

558
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,228
He tries to write pop songs.

559
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,264
Oh, no, Australians do
have a natural sense of rhythm.

560
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:25,667
Look, he's 30, you're 18,
he's not with you...

561
00:35:25,669 --> 00:35:28,203
Because he wants you to edit
his post-doctoral thesis.

562
00:35:28,205 --> 00:35:30,873
Um, I'm pretty sure that
you and I discussing...

563
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:33,475
My relationship is
none of your business.

564
00:35:33,477 --> 00:35:34,643
Relationship?
Yes!

565
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:36,645
It's a relationship?
Yes!

566
00:35:36,646 --> 00:35:38,646
Is he your boyfriend?
Yep... yep. He's my boyfriend.

567
00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:40,616
There's no way he's your
boyfriend!

568
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:46,622
I'm done with mini golf...

569
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:47,756
So I'll just wait in the car
for you guys?

570
00:35:47,758 --> 00:35:49,258
Is that cool? So...

571
00:35:52,296 --> 00:35:55,364
Nora?

572
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:58,934
Are you serious? You're calling
her out on the age difference?

573
00:35:58,936 --> 00:36:01,436
Yo, lion, you know Andy here
has been having sex...

574
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:02,905
With older women from the club
for money.

575
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:05,841
Holy tits, you're
a hooker? Pound that shit.

576
00:36:05,843 --> 00:36:09,411
I'm not... thank you.
I'm not a hooker.

577
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:14,516
I'm... getting some experience
and I'm teaching them lessons.

578
00:36:14,518 --> 00:36:16,552
Dude, they're not lessons!

579
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:19,254
God...

580
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:25,394
They're technically lessons.

581
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:51,386
Please don't be a catfish.

582
00:37:16,347 --> 00:37:19,648
Are you just rhyming
my name with other girl's names?

583
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,383
Have you tried to rhyme
your name?

584
00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:24,586
Girls' names are all there are.

585
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:29,258
Something on your mind?

586
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,930
I, uh, got into a fight with a
friend at mini golf, it was bad.

587
00:37:34,932 --> 00:37:38,000
You want to do something
to get out of your head?

588
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:40,802
Well, what are you thinking?

589
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:49,678
The world behind the curtains.

590
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,480
Crap, this is so cool.

591
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:54,983
And here is the autonomous
underwater vehicle, "fetch."

592
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:56,885
Fetch.
Center point of our research.

593
00:37:56,887 --> 00:37:58,087
Uh-huh.

594
00:37:58,088 --> 00:37:59,288
Collector of good data
on specimens...

595
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,623
Ranging from the Acan coral...

596
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:02,791
From the Netherlands Antilles...

597
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:04,726
Through to the fur seal
populations...

598
00:38:04,728 --> 00:38:06,428
In the Shetland islands
of Antarctica.

599
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,930
And black hydrothermal
smoker vents in the Galapagos.

600
00:38:08,932 --> 00:38:12,801
That's correct, yeah,
black smoker hydrothermal vents.

601
00:38:12,803 --> 00:38:14,069
These things are worth like...

602
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:16,705
A quarter of a million
dollars a piece.

603
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:18,573
Ten more years of education...

604
00:38:18,575 --> 00:38:21,743
And maybe I'll feel like I
actually deserve to be in here.

605
00:38:23,981 --> 00:38:27,516
This is a robotics lab,
are you joking?

606
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:29,718
No.

607
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,921
Are you my boyfriend?

608
00:38:32,923 --> 00:38:34,923
Come on, Nora.

609
00:38:34,925 --> 00:38:36,658
Are you?

610
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,428
Yes, yes, of course,
I'm your boyfriend, Nora.

611
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,595
Hmm.

612
00:38:40,597 --> 00:38:42,464
I care about you.

613
00:38:42,466 --> 00:38:43,932
Do you?

614
00:38:43,934 --> 00:38:45,967
I do.

615
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:47,669
How much?

616
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:52,741
I... have this!

617
00:38:53,777 --> 00:38:54,860
Oh, my god.

618
00:38:54,861 --> 00:38:55,944
Okay, okay, but you've
gotta admit...

619
00:38:55,946 --> 00:38:57,045
You'd have a virginity story...

620
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:58,513
Better than any of your friends,
right?

621
00:38:58,515 --> 00:39:00,782
Who the hell says
that I'm a virgin?

622
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:04,052
Clearly, you've never been to a
national high school leaders...

623
00:39:04,054 --> 00:39:06,421
Of tomorrow conference.

624
00:39:06,423 --> 00:39:08,857
Yeah, clearly I haven't.

625
00:39:23,874 --> 00:39:25,474
Hm?

626
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:26,775
What's the matter?

627
00:39:26,777 --> 00:39:30,045
Uh, nothing.

628
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:33,682
It's just girl stuff.

629
00:39:33,684 --> 00:39:35,617
Client?

630
00:39:37,988 --> 00:39:42,124
You understand, I'm not
a prostitute, right?

631
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:43,759
I'm going to Dartmouth.

632
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:46,662
Well, then you should have
waited to start...

633
00:39:46,663 --> 00:39:49,564
Your career as a sex worker
until you got to New Hampshire.

634
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:51,166
No state income tax.

635
00:39:51,168 --> 00:39:55,570
You think I have
to declare this?

636
00:39:55,572 --> 00:39:57,539
Gabby, I'm home!

637
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:00,075
Whoa!
Oh, my god, you have to go!

638
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:01,476
Is that...?
Go that way now!

639
00:40:01,478 --> 00:40:03,946
My clothes are in...

640
00:40:03,947 --> 00:40:06,415
I don't care, my husband's
gonna walk in this... go, go!

641
00:40:08,085 --> 00:40:11,153
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

642
00:40:41,218 --> 00:40:44,085
Don't you look handsome.

643
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:46,121
Stupid! You're so stupid!

644
00:40:46,123 --> 00:40:48,056
You are so stupid,
you are an idiot, you're dumb.

645
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:58,667
No, no, no.

646
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,997
They've made some great
additions to this course.

647
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:31,032
It's challenging, but fun.

648
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:37,873
They also have go-karts
at this place now.

649
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,908
Thank you for this
blanket, by the way.

650
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,643
Yeah, just make sure
it's all the way...

651
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:43,845
Between you and the seat.

652
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,301
Golden boy!

653
00:41:49,302 --> 00:41:51,653
What are you in for, naked
insider trading or something?

654
00:41:51,655 --> 00:41:53,855
Huh? Hey, numbers in the nude!

655
00:41:53,857 --> 00:41:55,891
Calculous with your cockulous?

656
00:41:55,893 --> 00:42:00,195
Aw... it's great
to see you, Plymouth rock.

657
00:42:00,197 --> 00:42:03,665
Why is he making fun
of you, you know about math?

658
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,267
A little bit.

659
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:07,736
Can I ask you something?

660
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:10,171
Sure, you have me under arrest.

661
00:42:10,173 --> 00:42:12,607
I'm taking out a mortgage.

662
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:15,010
These numbers just
don't seem to add up.

663
00:42:16,747 --> 00:42:19,214
I'm not a banker,
but I can take a look.

664
00:42:26,857 --> 00:42:31,293
Okay, so, that's it, the problem
here is that this number here...

665
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,328
Is based on a 30-year
amortization...

666
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,796
When you wanted a 20, right?

667
00:42:34,798 --> 00:42:36,481
Right.

668
00:42:36,482 --> 00:42:38,165
Your instincts were right,
this is a clerical error.

669
00:42:38,168 --> 00:42:39,668
They blew it.

670
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,137
Hey, thank you, man.

671
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:45,006
You probably saved me a ton
of money.

672
00:42:45,008 --> 00:42:47,175
Well, you have good reason
to be upset at your lender.

673
00:42:47,177 --> 00:42:50,679
Now, does this maybe
change things...

674
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:54,149
In terms of the naked
in the car situation?

675
00:42:54,151 --> 00:42:57,852
What? No! I already
wrote it up.

676
00:42:57,854 --> 00:43:00,622
You know you can't
just drive around town...

677
00:43:00,624 --> 00:43:02,591
Showing your ass like that,
right?

678
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:03,792
You know, I'm just saying...
You know that?

679
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:05,961
I do you a favor,
you do me a favor.

680
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:07,829
Like I rub your back,
you rub mine.

681
00:43:07,831 --> 00:43:09,230
Okay, I did not rub anything!

682
00:43:09,232 --> 00:43:10,966
I wasn't... I had a scorecard
there...

683
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:13,902
Maybe you saw the outline
of things, but that's all I had.

684
00:43:13,904 --> 00:43:15,637
That's enough, the outline
is enough.

685
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:20,375
Don't show that too tall ass
around here again.

686
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:31,119
Hey, Yaco. Salvatore!
What's up?

687
00:43:31,121 --> 00:43:33,121
Heard about your driving
incident.

688
00:43:33,123 --> 00:43:37,058
Yeah, yeah, it was crazy,
just a dare gone wrong.

689
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,161
Oh, Gabby dared you to
flee from her house naked?

690
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:43,965
How do you know?

691
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:46,468
I, too, am fucking Gabby.

692
00:43:46,469 --> 00:43:48,970
For many years now. All the
things she does with her pinky,

693
00:43:48,972 --> 00:43:51,339
I know all about this.
As do I!

694
00:43:51,341 --> 00:43:53,191
No!

695
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:55,042
And now you start doing the
same and you almost get caught.

696
00:43:55,045 --> 00:43:58,146
If you get caught, suspicion
falls on all the pros...

697
00:43:58,148 --> 00:44:00,081
At the club, does it not?

698
00:44:01,985 --> 00:44:06,221
Such sloppy behavior we cannot
risk.

699
00:44:06,223 --> 00:44:10,325
No more sleeping with women.
You will ruin everything.

700
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:13,228
Keep your beef and the chorizo
somewhere else...

701
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,096
You can't tell me where
to put my chorizo.

702
00:44:15,098 --> 00:44:16,898
I can.
It's my chorizo...

703
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,335
Stop giving private lessons
or you are fired.

704
00:44:20,337 --> 00:44:22,904
You were my apostle.

705
00:44:22,906 --> 00:44:26,341
Little did I know,
that apostle was... Judas.

706
00:44:26,343 --> 00:44:28,377
What?

707
00:44:28,378 --> 00:44:30,818
You betray me not with a kiss,
but with a fuck! What the fuck?

708
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:33,482
Yaco...

709
00:44:33,483 --> 00:44:35,283
Andiamo, Salvatore.
Salvatore, you get it.

710
00:44:35,285 --> 00:44:36,918
No!

711
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,953
Salvatore!

712
00:44:38,955 --> 00:44:41,022
Salvatore...

713
00:44:57,374 --> 00:44:59,941
Did you find going to
public school a disadvantage...

714
00:44:59,943 --> 00:45:01,476
For your college application?

715
00:45:01,478 --> 00:45:03,912
You know, tins, honestly
if you're smart enough...

716
00:45:03,914 --> 00:45:05,674
It doesn't really matter
where you come from?

717
00:45:11,121 --> 00:45:12,320
Now, uh...

718
00:45:12,322 --> 00:45:14,322
Don't worry, I got the goods
in here.

719
00:45:14,324 --> 00:45:16,291
Let's go.
Yeah.

720
00:45:16,293 --> 00:45:19,394
Wow, Mit and drugs.

721
00:45:19,396 --> 00:45:21,429
He'll probably solve cold
fusion his freshman year.

722
00:45:21,431 --> 00:45:24,199
Probably.

723
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,968
I'm pretty sure you don't know
lion well enough...

724
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,136
To weigh in on what
he's gonna do.

725
00:45:28,138 --> 00:45:29,588
Andy, what are you doing?

726
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:31,039
Yeah, we're all going to college
pretty soon...

727
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:32,941
What do you got going?

728
00:45:32,943 --> 00:45:35,376
Maybe... isn't there a kangaroo
helicopter...

729
00:45:35,378 --> 00:45:39,914
With like digeridoo blades
that can come grab you...

730
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:42,917
And haul you back to Australia,
so you're not in my face...

731
00:45:42,919 --> 00:45:45,186
Every moment of the rest
of the summer?

732
00:45:45,188 --> 00:45:47,188
You know what, Andy,
I'm sure there is.

733
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,858
But you see, kangaroo
helicopters with digeridoo...

734
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,060
Blades, they breakdown pretty
easily, so...

735
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:56,831
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you're a funny man!

736
00:45:56,833 --> 00:46:00,135
I can't stand you!

737
00:46:00,137 --> 00:46:03,037
One... I'm just... I'm so...
That's cool.

738
00:46:05,308 --> 00:46:07,108
I like you.

739
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:09,310
30-year-old,
I'm gonna fuck with a dad?

740
00:46:09,312 --> 00:46:11,513
I'm speaking to you, Andy!

741
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:13,214
Totally fucking unacceptable!

742
00:46:13,216 --> 00:46:17,952
What is wrong with you lately?

743
00:46:17,954 --> 00:46:19,354
I'll go apologize!

744
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:21,122
That's not what I want, I want
you to tell me...

745
00:46:21,124 --> 00:46:23,324
What is going on right now!

746
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:26,561
There's three weeks left
of summer...

747
00:46:26,563 --> 00:46:29,831
And I don't want to share
that time with "airland."

748
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:31,032
Well, his name is Erland.

749
00:46:31,034 --> 00:46:32,133
Whatever.

750
00:46:32,135 --> 00:46:33,968
And he's not even around
that much.

751
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:35,203
He's around whenever
you're around.

752
00:46:35,205 --> 00:46:36,571
He's my boyfriend.

753
00:46:36,573 --> 00:46:38,957
Right.

754
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:41,342
Whoa, why are you like
trying to ruin this for me?

755
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:43,178
I'm not trying! Why are you...

756
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,763
Why did you do...

757
00:46:44,764 --> 00:46:46,347
Dude, what did I do, just tell
me what I did, what did I do?

758
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:48,049
You got a guy and
you're all lovey dovey...

759
00:46:48,051 --> 00:46:49,517
You're just some type of person
you never were before!

760
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:50,852
Whoa, so you're...

761
00:46:50,854 --> 00:46:52,137
You're blossoming right now...

762
00:46:52,138 --> 00:46:53,421
And you're not supposed to
blossom right now.

763
00:46:53,423 --> 00:46:56,157
I'm sorry, but it should
be us together!

764
00:47:02,899 --> 00:47:06,601
Um... okay.

765
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:14,375
I had no clue that you
felt this way.

766
00:47:16,146 --> 00:47:18,413
How do you feel
this way about me?

767
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:21,850
I don't know, I don't
know, I don't... I just do.

768
00:47:23,587 --> 00:47:25,153
That would be really weird.

769
00:47:25,155 --> 00:47:27,555
No, it wouldn't.
Yeah, yes, it would.

770
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:29,123
It doesn't have to be.
Yeah, no, how about this.

771
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,575
Whoa, whoa!

772
00:47:30,576 --> 00:47:32,026
See, that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

773
00:47:32,028 --> 00:47:34,112
Stop...

774
00:47:34,113 --> 00:47:36,197
Come here, let me show you
something else. Come here.

775
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:37,866
Can you come closer?

776
00:47:40,203 --> 00:47:42,103
I want you to fuck me.

777
00:47:42,105 --> 00:47:43,171
What?

778
00:47:43,173 --> 00:47:44,439
I want you to fuck me.

779
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:46,441
Stop!

780
00:47:46,442 --> 00:47:48,442
Okay, then why don't you try?
You say something dirty to me.

781
00:47:48,445 --> 00:47:50,011
Try.

782
00:47:50,013 --> 00:47:54,249
F... finger me.
No... finger you.

783
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,017
Okay, all right.
You... I will...

784
00:47:56,019 --> 00:47:58,353
That's exactly, hmm. So...

785
00:47:58,355 --> 00:48:00,355
Okay, okay, okay.
We know each other too well.

786
00:48:00,357 --> 00:48:01,556
You've proven your point.

787
00:48:03,393 --> 00:48:07,395
I feel so weird.

788
00:48:07,397 --> 00:48:08,997
I'm sor... I'm sorry?

789
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:12,233
Whatever, like there's a beach
full of girls...

790
00:48:12,235 --> 00:48:14,369
That think you're really cool,
for whatever reason...

791
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:16,571
And only I know the
truth, so let's just...

792
00:48:16,573 --> 00:48:20,942
I forgot already. Didn't happen,
and it's never gonna happen.

793
00:48:20,944 --> 00:48:25,947
So, let's just forget about it.

794
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,952
Hold on.

795
00:48:30,954 --> 00:48:32,086
What, who is it?

796
00:48:32,088 --> 00:48:35,323
Private tennis lesson,
I'm on call.

797
00:48:35,325 --> 00:48:37,659
What do you mean, you're gonna
go do a private tennis lesson...

798
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:39,160
When you're... you've
been drinking!

799
00:48:39,162 --> 00:48:43,531
I agree, it isn't
entirely professional.

800
00:48:43,533 --> 00:48:45,066
Does this have something
to do...

801
00:48:45,068 --> 00:48:47,035
With why you've been driving
around naked?

802
00:48:49,673 --> 00:48:52,240
You whore!

803
00:48:58,248 --> 00:49:01,983
So, the lion has gone
full-blown crazy.

804
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:05,353
Yeah, he taught me the
quivering hand technique...

805
00:49:05,355 --> 00:49:07,588
With his palm, you know?

806
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:08,723
The touch of death?

807
00:49:08,725 --> 00:49:11,059
Yeah, the touch of death.

808
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:12,660
Seems irresponsible.

809
00:49:12,662 --> 00:49:14,662
I mean, he was high
when he told me.

810
00:49:14,664 --> 00:49:17,098
No, no, what are you
doing, what are you doing?

811
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,367
Watch that thing, easy does it!

812
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:23,271
Pardon me, man.

813
00:49:23,272 --> 00:49:27,174
Hey, airland! Let's have a chat.
I am sorry about earlier.

814
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:29,310
You're an ass, Andy.

815
00:49:29,312 --> 00:49:33,348
Maybe I have been recently,
but if you hurt her...

816
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,650
I will kill you.

817
00:49:35,652 --> 00:49:38,586
Okay. Come on.

818
00:49:39,756 --> 00:49:41,289
Nailed it.

819
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:43,691
I don't think he's
coming back, either.

820
00:49:43,693 --> 00:49:46,761
Hello?

821
00:49:46,763 --> 00:49:51,265
Hi, Diana. You know what?

822
00:49:51,267 --> 00:49:54,302
Private lessons are over.

823
00:49:56,573 --> 00:50:02,076
Okay... they're back on and
I will be there in 20 minutes.

824
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:04,545
Thank you.
No, no, what?

825
00:50:04,547 --> 00:50:09,484
I'm sorry, a client just
offered me a thousand dollars

826
00:50:09,486 --> 00:50:10,551
for a lesson.

827
00:50:10,553 --> 00:50:13,454
A lesson? A client?

828
00:50:13,456 --> 00:50:15,189
Dude, you don't even have your
tennis racket with you...

829
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:16,724
Listen to yourself.

830
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:18,258
What the hell's happening
with my friends this summer?

831
00:50:18,261 --> 00:50:21,496
It's like I'm the only one
that's being me. That's me.

832
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:23,197
Last one and I'm out.

833
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:26,501
Okay, so, one last big gig
before retirement?

834
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:28,503
That's real mature, I'm sure
that's what they all say.

835
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:31,506
What are you doing? Dude!

836
00:50:40,316 --> 00:50:42,617
Diana!

837
00:50:50,593 --> 00:50:52,727
Diana?

838
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:01,469
Hello?

839
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:06,474
Diana?

840
00:51:06,476 --> 00:51:08,676
Andy?

841
00:51:08,678 --> 00:51:13,414
Huh? What?
Conch, what are you doing?

842
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:15,516
What you... babysitting.

843
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,620
Someone let you babysit?

844
00:51:19,622 --> 00:51:22,723
What the hell's that supposed
to mean?

845
00:51:22,725 --> 00:51:26,394
Wait, I've never seen you sober.

846
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:29,430
You think I do my job drunk?

847
00:51:29,432 --> 00:51:31,799
That's messed up, man.
Hey, get in here.

848
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:37,605
Sit, sit, sit.

849
00:51:39,275 --> 00:51:44,245
Hey, so, what are you
doing here?

850
00:51:48,585 --> 00:51:52,153
I was at a party.

851
00:51:52,155 --> 00:51:53,654
Yeah?

852
00:51:53,656 --> 00:51:55,823
And I'm looking for a Diana.

853
00:51:55,825 --> 00:51:57,458
You mean, Ms. Bradfield?

854
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,327
Yeah, she lives next door.

855
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:01,195
Oh.

856
00:52:01,197 --> 00:52:03,264
Weird person to be looking
for in your current state.

857
00:52:03,266 --> 00:52:05,233
Ah!

858
00:52:05,235 --> 00:52:10,171
Seriously? Yo, this is Andy,
we went to high school together.

859
00:52:10,173 --> 00:52:13,441
Hello, child.

860
00:52:13,443 --> 00:52:16,878
So, can't believe you were
at a party.

861
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,913
You never came to our parties.

862
00:52:18,915 --> 00:52:24,152
He, we never, we were
never invited to his parties.

863
00:52:24,154 --> 00:52:28,289
Nobody's ever invited,
they just show up.

864
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:29,790
That's what a party is.

865
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:33,794
That doesn't really...
Really apply to us, though.

866
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:38,566
Are you stupid? Because nobody
ever disliked you guys.

867
00:52:38,568 --> 00:52:41,536
You guys are the ones
who stayed away.

868
00:52:41,538 --> 00:52:43,471
You exiled yourselves.

869
00:52:46,676 --> 00:52:48,376
Hard truths.

870
00:52:50,213 --> 00:52:51,779
Anyway, shake it off, listen.

871
00:52:51,781 --> 00:52:53,848
You should come to the
summer dump party.

872
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:56,851
Yeah, and I know how important
it is for you to feel special...

873
00:52:56,853 --> 00:52:59,820
So, you can be my honored
guests.

874
00:52:59,822 --> 00:53:02,523
Summer dump?

875
00:53:02,525 --> 00:53:05,226
I would love that. When is it?

876
00:53:05,228 --> 00:53:07,378
Same time every year.
Last weekend in August.

877
00:53:07,379 --> 00:53:09,529
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta get back to babysitting.

878
00:53:09,532 --> 00:53:11,899
Okay? I'm sure Diana
is waiting for you.

879
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:13,801
Ooh, bro, you should
have taken her to prom!

880
00:53:13,803 --> 00:53:16,370
Seriously, given her age,
she could've chaperoned...

881
00:53:16,372 --> 00:53:19,640
And been your date. Come on,
Andy, think about these things.

882
00:53:19,642 --> 00:53:21,642
Conch.
Yeah?

883
00:53:21,644 --> 00:53:23,744
Dude, you're my friend now.

884
00:53:24,647 --> 00:53:25,913
Bye!

885
00:53:39,495 --> 00:53:40,595
Send.

886
00:54:24,474 --> 00:54:27,975
Punch... throw a kick, punch.

887
00:54:32,982 --> 00:54:34,649
What is going...

888
00:54:45,695 --> 00:54:50,798
What? Keep busy, guys,
just keep doing your thing, man.

889
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,667
Punch!

890
00:54:55,505 --> 00:54:56,904
Oh, man.

891
00:55:02,045 --> 00:55:05,613
She's 18... yes, 18.

892
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:10,318
Of course, you're not
a replacement.

893
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:14,021
I want<i> you</i> in my bed...

894
00:55:14,023 --> 00:55:17,658
And this weekend will be
perfect, yeah.

895
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:20,394
Really?

896
00:55:28,638 --> 00:55:29,970
Fuck.

897
00:55:32,108 --> 00:55:34,709
Hey, Andy, looking good.

898
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:39,547
Hey! No, you look good,
you do!

899
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:41,882
Sit down!
No, no!

900
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:44,852
We told you, Andy, no more sex!

901
00:55:46,989 --> 00:55:49,724
Gabby's husband called
asking if either of us...

902
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:53,394
Had lost a headband, which he
found in his bedroom.

903
00:55:53,396 --> 00:55:54,762
Aw, that's where that one went.

904
00:55:54,764 --> 00:55:55,830
Ow!

905
00:55:57,133 --> 00:55:59,433
Okay, okay, easy, easy.

906
00:55:59,435 --> 00:56:01,936
Look, look, let's form an
alliance together, let's work...

907
00:56:01,938 --> 00:56:04,238
Ow!

908
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:06,539
Shh. Such sloppiness has no
place at the pro shop.

909
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:10,544
You're fired. And if anyone else
comes sniffing around here...

910
00:56:10,546 --> 00:56:12,880
Looking for the man
who's been with their wives...

911
00:56:12,882 --> 00:56:16,717
I will give them your name.

912
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:20,688
You flew too close to the sun.
Judas...

913
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,656
The pussy sun.

914
00:56:24,093 --> 00:56:28,496
Salvatore...
No, Andy, not today!

915
00:56:34,137 --> 00:56:37,671
I called Yaco about it, he swore
up and down it wasn't his.

916
00:56:37,673 --> 00:56:41,509
It's a fact, Yaco isn't
into women.

917
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:43,477
He'd never touch your wife.

918
00:56:43,479 --> 00:56:45,012
She's not into Italians...

919
00:56:45,014 --> 00:56:47,882
So, Salavatore is out.

920
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:49,683
Did you ask her about Andy?

921
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:53,421
The high school kid? No. Why?

922
00:56:53,423 --> 00:56:55,055
Because
when Victoria had too much...

923
00:56:55,057 --> 00:56:59,627
To drink the other night,
she told me she slept with him.

924
00:56:59,629 --> 00:57:05,433
I'll talk to the other guys,
see what they know about it.

925
00:57:11,607 --> 00:57:12,873
Thanks.

926
00:57:20,883 --> 00:57:22,450
What happened this morning,
guys?

927
00:57:22,452 --> 00:57:25,786
Oh, nothing, lion and
I lost our jobs...

928
00:57:25,788 --> 00:57:30,191
And Nora found out Erland is
sleeping with somebody else, so-

929
00:57:30,193 --> 00:57:32,626
who knew that peyote would stay
in my system for three days?

930
00:57:32,628 --> 00:57:35,629
God, I'm so stupid to cut
it that close, man.

931
00:57:35,631 --> 00:57:37,598
Easy.

932
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,201
Guys, I'm done with drugs
and alcohol.

933
00:57:40,203 --> 00:57:42,770
Okay, a warrior needs
his mind to be sharp.

934
00:57:42,772 --> 00:57:46,574
At least the summer's almost
over, so...

935
00:57:46,576 --> 00:57:50,811
Almost... we got
invited to summer dump.

936
00:57:50,813 --> 00:57:52,480
Oh, my god!
Are you serious?

937
00:57:52,482 --> 00:57:54,748
No way.
You're not...

938
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,917
You guys don't' want to...
You wanna go?

939
00:57:56,919 --> 00:58:00,521
No, no, I mean, I'm exhausted,
you guys.

940
00:58:00,523 --> 00:58:03,958
I vote that we just
cut our losses.

941
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,193
No! Our group has been
disintegrating this summer.

942
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:09,029
You two have been fighting each
other, you fried your brain...

943
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:13,067
And I've... I mean, not much has
happened for me, I realize that.

944
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:14,869
It probably should have by
now and I'm not too happy...

945
00:58:14,871 --> 00:58:16,871
With my progression,
either, but...

946
00:58:16,873 --> 00:58:19,139
This is the last time we're
gonna be together like this...

947
00:58:19,141 --> 00:58:21,075
So, we're going to summer dump!

948
00:58:21,077 --> 00:58:23,811
Okay.

949
00:58:25,114 --> 00:58:30,251
Sorry. Some weird number.

950
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:32,052
Hello?

951
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:35,789
<i>Danya
Andy? It's Danya.</i>

952
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:39,760
Danya? Hi!

953
00:58:39,762 --> 00:58:42,296
<i>Danya I'm at the shuttle
bus stop in Hyannis.</i>

954
00:58:42,298 --> 00:58:44,298
<i>I got a transfer from Boston.</i>

955
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,834
You're at the shuttle bus stop?

956
00:58:46,836 --> 00:58:49,770
<i>Danya you got my
emails I was coming, right?</i>

957
00:58:49,772 --> 00:58:52,172
Oh, you didn't check your spam
folder, did you?

958
00:58:52,174 --> 00:58:54,108
Your email? Of course,
I got your emails.

959
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,277
I'm gonna come get you,
I'm gonna come right now.

960
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:57,845
I'll be there in ten minutes.

961
00:58:57,847 --> 00:59:00,114
Danya okay, Andy, I'm excited.

962
00:59:00,116 --> 00:59:02,283
Me, too, me, too!
Okay, bye.

963
00:59:07,723 --> 00:59:12,993
So, Danya is real and she is
here and I'm gonna go get her.

964
00:59:12,995 --> 00:59:14,962
She just like showed up
out of the blue?

965
00:59:14,964 --> 00:59:16,830
Indians are spontaneous
like that.

966
00:59:16,832 --> 00:59:18,599
Gandhi was pretty patient.

967
00:59:18,601 --> 00:59:20,390
Shut up.

968
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,180
You know I'm coming,
right, I have to see this.

969
00:59:22,181 --> 00:59:23,970
Yeah, no, me, too, because I
can't go back to the lab, so.

970
00:59:23,973 --> 00:59:25,906
I have work, so I'll be
staying here.

971
00:59:25,908 --> 00:59:27,641
Good, yes, all of you
stay here...

972
00:59:27,643 --> 00:59:29,810
Because you'll freak her out
if you come.

973
00:59:35,685 --> 00:59:39,687
Oh, the Internet is awesome.
Okay.

974
00:59:43,993 --> 00:59:48,195
Hi! This is...

975
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,766
Oh, that's nice.

976
00:59:52,768 --> 00:59:54,635
Oh, my god.

977
00:59:56,973 --> 00:59:58,105
Ah, she sees me.

978
00:59:58,107 --> 01:00:01,275
Who are those people?

979
01:00:01,277 --> 01:00:03,711
Oh, they came with the car.

980
01:00:07,617 --> 01:00:10,150
You can't understand
anything about the world...

981
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:13,187
If you don't read Amartya sen's
"inequality re-examined."

982
01:00:13,189 --> 01:00:15,122
Okay, but I read,
"development as freedom."

983
01:00:15,124 --> 01:00:18,058
That's just an appetizer
for "inequality re-examined."

984
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,096
You'll have to feed me dinner.

985
01:00:23,966 --> 01:00:25,733
Hey, have you ever read,
intuition...

986
01:00:25,735 --> 01:00:27,267
Lion!
Sorry.

987
01:00:31,307 --> 01:00:32,773
Okay...

988
01:00:32,775 --> 01:00:38,946
Um, that should...
That should cover it.

989
01:00:41,384 --> 01:00:42,916
Thank you.

990
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:50,791
Oh. Oh, yes.

991
01:00:50,793 --> 01:00:54,928
Where did you get so much
cash to pay for this place?

992
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:57,431
I'm a sperm donor.

993
01:00:57,433 --> 01:00:59,967
You must be exhausted.

994
01:01:01,837 --> 01:01:04,872
I am so glad you're here.

995
01:01:04,874 --> 01:01:06,140
Me, too.

996
01:01:12,281 --> 01:01:17,351
Um, I have to go in there
all of a sudden...

997
01:01:17,353 --> 01:01:22,690
But I'm gonna come back here
and then, we're just...

998
01:01:22,692 --> 01:01:25,926
We're just never leaving.
Okay?

999
01:01:25,928 --> 01:01:27,161
Okay.

1000
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:28,962
All right, I'll be right back.

1001
01:01:47,983 --> 01:01:51,885
Ow! Oh, god, fire.

1002
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:58,792
Hot, hot burn. Oh, my god!

1003
01:02:09,772 --> 01:02:12,906
Something is wrong...
Something is wrong.

1004
01:02:17,413 --> 01:02:24,852
Okay, so... I have to go now,
I have to go do something.

1005
01:02:24,854 --> 01:02:26,420
You're leaving?

1006
01:02:26,422 --> 01:02:28,922
It's nothing weird,
I just gotta go. Okay?

1007
01:02:28,924 --> 01:02:30,457
I'll be back, I'll be back.

1008
01:02:33,863 --> 01:02:36,230
Looks like you have
a yeast infection.

1009
01:02:36,232 --> 01:02:38,532
A yeast infection?

1010
01:02:38,534 --> 01:02:40,951
Men get yeast infections, too.

1011
01:02:40,952 --> 01:02:43,369
Particularly if you're having a
lot of intercourse...

1012
01:02:43,372 --> 01:02:44,938
And your immune system
is suppressed...

1013
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,106
Which would be the case...

1014
01:02:46,108 --> 01:02:48,175
If you've been drinking
a lot of alcohol.

1015
01:02:48,177 --> 01:02:50,811
Oh, my god.

1016
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:53,781
Lucky for you, it's curable with
a seven-day course of treatment.

1017
01:02:53,783 --> 01:02:55,816
Any way we could speed that up?

1018
01:02:55,818 --> 01:02:59,186
Some women have success putting
non-sweetened probiotic yogurt..

1019
01:02:59,188 --> 01:03:02,156
Directly on the infection.

1020
01:03:02,158 --> 01:03:06,393
Nope. No, no, no.
This can't be happening...

1021
01:03:06,395 --> 01:03:08,061
I've been very careful.

1022
01:03:08,063 --> 01:03:11,198
You've been having a lot
of sex, Andy.

1023
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,033
I know.

1024
01:03:13,034 --> 01:03:14,867
Lay off sex for the next week
and you'll be fine.

1025
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:17,838
Lay off for the next week?
I can't.

1026
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,842
Yes, you can... okay?

1027
01:03:21,844 --> 01:03:26,213
I gotta... can I pay for this
visit in cash?

1028
01:03:26,215 --> 01:03:29,216
I don't want my parents
to see my insurance bill.

1029
01:03:29,218 --> 01:03:31,218
It's a paper trail thing.

1030
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:34,321
You've had sex with 15 women
in the past two months...

1031
01:03:34,323 --> 01:03:37,591
And you carry that kind of cash?

1032
01:03:37,593 --> 01:03:38,992
Yes.

1033
01:03:38,994 --> 01:03:40,394
Who are you?

1034
01:03:40,396 --> 01:03:42,496
I don't even know anymore.

1035
01:03:45,467 --> 01:03:47,901
And you're certain, she's not a
spy sent to kill you...

1036
01:03:47,903 --> 01:03:50,003
Or some shit, bro?

1037
01:03:51,073 --> 01:03:53,440
Going for a walk.

1038
01:03:53,442 --> 01:03:56,476
Andy, Andy come in!

1039
01:03:56,478 --> 01:04:00,180
I can't hear you.

1040
01:04:00,182 --> 01:04:04,251
What? You can absolutely
hear her, bro.

1041
01:04:04,253 --> 01:04:07,020
Can't hear you, either.

1042
01:04:07,022 --> 01:04:09,623
I'm just craving it right now.
I don't even...

1043
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,625
If you wanna know one thing
about me...

1044
01:04:11,627 --> 01:04:14,528
It's that I love yogurt.

1045
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:20,334
Oh, yeah, you know, that's the
one.

1046
01:04:20,336 --> 01:04:22,936
That's the one, I love this
stuff.

1047
01:04:22,938 --> 01:04:24,571
This is gonna do the trick.

1048
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:44,191
No... fuck it.

1049
01:04:47,363 --> 01:04:49,296
Ah, yes.

1050
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:58,605
Oh, my gosh, my stomach is
killing me from those clams.

1051
01:05:13,355 --> 01:05:17,057
Hey, where have you been?
Been calling you.

1052
01:05:17,059 --> 01:05:20,527
I've been looking for your
dick under this microscope.

1053
01:05:20,529 --> 01:05:23,330
Um, what?

1054
01:05:25,334 --> 01:05:30,570
I, uh, I heard you, heard you
talking to a girl on the phone..

1055
01:05:30,572 --> 01:05:36,243
The other day about how I was 18
and you could use a replacement?

1056
01:05:36,245 --> 01:05:37,577
I believe that's how you put it.

1057
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:41,014
Does that ring any bells?
So you just fuck off!

1058
01:06:10,546 --> 01:06:13,313
This is it.

1059
01:06:13,315 --> 01:06:17,250
Alcohol's in here, right?

1060
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:11,638
<i>Identify yourselves.</i>

1061
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:18,211
Uh... Andy, spice,
lion and Nora.

1062
01:07:18,213 --> 01:07:19,746
<i>Who's the hot girl?</i>

1063
01:07:19,748 --> 01:07:26,386
Nora. And... Danya!
Danya, also.

1064
01:07:26,388 --> 01:07:30,157
<i>Holy shit!
It's the smart kids!</i>

1065
01:07:33,595 --> 01:07:36,663
<i>And have you come
for precious metals...</i>

1066
01:07:36,665 --> 01:07:39,733
<i>For your space laboratories?</i>

1067
01:07:39,735 --> 01:07:41,468
We came to hang out!

1068
01:07:45,674 --> 01:07:48,842
<i>You heard them!
They wanna hang...</i>

1069
01:07:48,844 --> 01:07:50,844
<i>And they have extra brain cells.</i>

1070
01:07:50,846 --> 01:07:54,347
<i>Find them and destroy them!</i>

1071
01:07:54,349 --> 01:07:57,350
Whoo! Conch!

1072
01:07:58,787 --> 01:08:01,788
Hell, yeah, this is gonna be...

1073
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:04,291
This is Danya, this is Danya.
No shit, how you doing?

1074
01:08:04,293 --> 01:08:06,626
She's from India.
She came from India.

1075
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:08,395
<i>You got hot!</i>

1076
01:08:08,397 --> 01:08:09,696
Thank you.

1077
01:08:09,698 --> 01:08:12,332
<i>You used to not be hot.</i>

1078
01:08:12,334 --> 01:08:13,800
I know.

1079
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:15,569
<i>But now you're hot.</i>

1080
01:08:15,571 --> 01:08:18,371
Thank you, thank you.

1081
01:08:18,373 --> 01:08:19,673
<i>Hot.</i>

1082
01:08:23,178 --> 01:08:26,279
Woo!

1083
01:08:32,187 --> 01:08:37,791
Goddamn, the palate on that is
wrong, it's so wrong. Let's see.

1084
01:08:42,598 --> 01:08:44,865
This will fuck people up.

1085
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:47,200
What are you doing
with that punch?

1086
01:08:47,202 --> 01:08:49,202
I'm improving it. Here.

1087
01:08:51,773 --> 01:08:53,573
Try it.

1088
01:09:03,485 --> 01:09:06,253
It's great.
Huh?

1089
01:09:23,405 --> 01:09:25,639
<i>Andy Evans!</i>

1090
01:09:25,641 --> 01:09:28,808
<i>Recipient of the
role of distinction award.</i>

1091
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:31,411
<i>Being this is your first
summer dump...</i>

1092
01:09:31,413 --> 01:09:33,914
<i>This is your initiation!</i>

1093
01:09:33,916 --> 01:09:36,349
<i>Foam mattress wrestling!</i>

1094
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,220
I'm not doing that.

1095
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:42,456
<i>I'm not doing that, uh-uh.</i>

1096
01:09:42,457 --> 01:09:44,691
<i>The role of distinction award
is given to the student...</i>

1097
01:09:44,693 --> 01:09:46,560
<i>That best exemplifies the

1098
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:48,628
<i>Of academic excellence...</i>

<i>Loyalty and service

<i>Ring girls, prepare him.</i>

1101

<i>Your champion, Andy will be
wrestling... Plymouth rock!</i>

1103
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:15,422
Do you think you're smart?

1104
01:10:15,424 --> 01:10:16,590
What?

1105
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:17,958
I said, do... you...

1106
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,994
Think... you're... smart?

1107
01:10:20,996 --> 01:10:23,897
Not anymore, I don't.
Oh, no!

1108
01:10:25,267 --> 01:10:26,633
Let go!

1109
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:41,681
Come on, Andy! Come on!

1110
01:11:03,438 --> 01:11:07,007
Okay, put him down!
Put him down!

1111
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:20,687
Get up... get the fuck
up... get the fuck up!

1112
01:11:54,423 --> 01:11:59,059
Andy! Andy! Andy, Andy!

1113
01:12:12,908 --> 01:12:15,608
Sorry, my hands are chapped.

1114
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,844
It's...
I do yardwork.

1115
01:12:17,846 --> 01:12:19,779
It's just... keep going,
keep going.

1116
01:12:24,553 --> 01:12:26,953
You're doing me next, you know.

1117
01:12:26,955 --> 01:12:29,656
Release!

1118
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:34,527
Hey, lion.

1119
01:12:36,064 --> 01:12:37,831
You okay?

1120
01:12:39,601 --> 01:12:43,069
I came from India thinking it
was going to be this...

1121
01:12:43,071 --> 01:12:49,609
Romantic trip, but... I don't
think Andy even likes me.

1122
01:12:49,611 --> 01:12:53,713
I've been here a week and
he hasn't touched me.

1123
01:12:55,884 --> 01:13:00,387
He hasn't touched you?

1124
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:02,689
But you're so beautiful.

1125
01:13:02,691 --> 01:13:05,959
I mean you're like Krishna's
bride, Bhadra.

1126
01:13:14,469 --> 01:13:18,104
You wanna go somewhere
and talk about this?

1127
01:13:18,106 --> 01:13:22,675
Aren't we talking about it
somewhere now?

1128
01:13:22,677 --> 01:13:29,916
I mean, yeah, but there are
other somewheres.

1129
01:13:50,505 --> 01:13:52,572
What is it?

1130
01:13:56,611 --> 01:14:01,481
Thought I sensed something...
Fuck it.

1131
01:14:02,818 --> 01:14:04,784
My body gets so hot.

1132
01:14:04,786 --> 01:14:06,119
Tell the story.

1133
01:14:06,121 --> 01:14:08,955
I have zero muscles,
I have zero muscles.

1134
01:14:08,957 --> 01:14:11,024
Epic, man.
Dude, thank you, thank you.

1135
01:14:19,968 --> 01:14:24,971
What?

1136
01:14:24,973 --> 01:14:26,806
Hi, mom.

1137
01:14:26,808 --> 01:14:28,007
<i>Mrs. Evans
Andy, where are you?</i>

1138
01:14:28,009 --> 01:14:30,076
I'm watching a movie.

1139
01:14:30,078 --> 01:14:32,045
Time to eat your own dick, Andy.

1140
01:14:32,047 --> 01:14:33,047
I have to go.

1141
01:14:36,852 --> 01:14:40,019
I love you. I know you know
that, but I need to express...

1142
01:14:40,021 --> 01:14:43,056
It to you right now, verbally,
before I die.

1143
01:14:43,058 --> 01:14:48,261
No guy has ever said that
to me verbally, before death.

1144
01:14:48,263 --> 01:14:51,264
How could anybody not love you?

1145
01:14:51,266 --> 01:14:53,633
Hey, Andy!

1146
01:14:53,635 --> 01:14:55,268
All right, all right,
all right, I'll be honest.

1147
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,904
I have conflicting thoughts
about what has happened over...

1148
01:14:57,906 --> 01:14:59,506
The last couple months
and I am sorry.

1149
01:14:59,508 --> 01:15:01,841
And if I were you guys,
I would be just as mad.

1150
01:15:01,843 --> 01:15:03,943
I fucked your wives,
for god's sake.

1151
01:15:03,945 --> 01:15:08,581
But I got a yeast infection,
that sucks... it really sucks.

1152
01:15:08,583 --> 01:15:11,784
Also, which one
of you is Gabby's husband?

1153
01:15:11,786 --> 01:15:14,220
Gabby, now, Gabby does this
thing with her pinky, right?

1154
01:15:14,222 --> 01:15:16,956
That hurts a lot, feels good,
but it hurts so much...

1155
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:19,292
And I've had to ice most
days of the summer.

1156
01:15:19,294 --> 01:15:20,760
I just want to say that also.

1157
01:15:20,762 --> 01:15:24,731
So, I am a victim here
as well... right?

1158
01:15:27,969 --> 01:15:30,303
You're an idiot.

1159
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:43,583
This has nothing to do with you!

1160
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:45,051
Lion, you sure
you wanna do this?

1161
01:15:45,053 --> 01:15:49,155
Fuck, yeah, bro, it's a totally
justifiable use of force.

1162
01:16:01,903 --> 01:16:03,636
In a mob, you gotta use
the low Thai kicks.

1163
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:12,345
Lion!

1164
01:16:12,347 --> 01:16:14,914
This is about my wife.

1165
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:18,217
I'm sorry, bro...
This is about my friend.

1166
01:16:27,195 --> 01:16:31,230
Oh, my god!

1167
01:16:36,304 --> 01:16:38,271
Fuck yeah!

1168
01:16:43,211 --> 01:16:45,044
You're amazing!
I got you!

1169
01:16:45,046 --> 01:16:46,145
I love you!
We did it!

1170
01:16:46,147 --> 01:16:47,880
I actually love you!

1171
01:16:47,882 --> 01:16:49,882
Holy shit! What the fuck!

1172
01:16:49,884 --> 01:16:52,318
Oh, my god! Holy shit!
They're dead.

1173
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,953
I think they're all dead!

1174
01:16:57,325 --> 01:16:59,258
Oh, my.

1175
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:05,298
Hey, guys. What'd I miss?

1176
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:09,035
Uh, I mean... I don't
even know where to start.

1177
01:17:09,037 --> 01:17:12,105
It's been the longest
night, I think we gotta call it.

1178
01:17:12,107 --> 01:17:15,742
Okay, I'm chillin'.

1179
01:17:15,744 --> 01:17:17,243
Why do you seem so relaxed?

1180
01:17:17,245 --> 01:17:20,279
You know what, I'm just feeling
refreshed, you know?

1181
01:17:20,281 --> 01:17:22,315
Release?

1182
01:17:22,317 --> 01:17:23,383
I've been released.

1183
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:25,718
Oh, man!

1184
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,121
Congratulations.
It's your moment.

1185
01:17:28,123 --> 01:17:29,322
I'm so proud of you.

1186
01:17:29,324 --> 01:17:31,157
Hey!

1187
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:33,760
Don't hide it, I already saw it,
why would you hide it?

1188
01:17:33,762 --> 01:17:35,094
Where would you hide it?

1189
01:17:35,096 --> 01:17:39,966
Wearing a sock as a shirt...
What the hell?

1190
01:17:44,105 --> 01:17:47,073
Who did this?

1191
01:17:47,075 --> 01:17:48,808
I did, sir.

1192
01:17:50,311 --> 01:17:52,178
They deserve it?

1193
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:54,347
They were trying to kill Andy.

1194
01:17:54,349 --> 01:17:55,448
Too tall.

1195
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:57,684
You remember me?

1196
01:17:57,685 --> 01:17:59,919
Absolutely. Got my
mortgage situation fixed.

1197
01:17:59,921 --> 01:18:01,454
That means you got your
arrest fixed.

1198
01:18:01,456 --> 01:18:02,889
Really?

1199
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:05,008
Mm-hm. Come on with it.

1200
01:18:05,009 --> 01:18:07,126
Hey, thank you, thank
you. I was drinking a beer...

1201
01:18:07,128 --> 01:18:10,263
Looks like there's nothing
to see out here. Right?

1202
01:18:10,265 --> 01:18:12,165
You kids want a ride?

1203
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:14,467
In a cop car?
That would be awesome.

1204
01:18:14,469 --> 01:18:15,768
Let's go.

1205
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:17,370
Okay...
Absolutely.

1206
01:18:17,372 --> 01:18:19,205
Can you put on the sirens?

1207
01:18:23,044 --> 01:18:26,112
<i>Yes! Legend!</i>

1208
01:18:39,828 --> 01:18:42,428
Reach out and get that.

1209
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:44,964
Yep... that's it.

1210
01:18:49,838 --> 01:18:51,370
Thanks, guys.

1211
01:18:51,372 --> 01:18:54,841
Hey, good luck at college, Andy.

1212
01:18:54,843 --> 01:18:56,375
Appreciate it.

1213
01:18:58,113 --> 01:19:02,181
Mom... breathe. I'm okay.

1214
01:19:07,222 --> 01:19:09,756
The last few days...

1215
01:19:09,758 --> 01:19:13,259
I've never experienced
anything like it.

1216
01:19:13,261 --> 01:19:17,063
I had no idea those positions
had a use outside of karate.

1217
01:19:17,065 --> 01:19:19,265
Visit me as soon as you can.

1218
01:19:19,267 --> 01:19:20,783
Let's shoot for winter break.

1219
01:19:20,784 --> 01:19:22,300
I'm planning on being a
millionaire near the end...

1220
01:19:22,303 --> 01:19:26,005
Of the first semester anyway,
so, we'll go somewhere nice.

1221
01:19:32,514 --> 01:19:34,380
They're actually pretty cute.

1222
01:19:41,956 --> 01:19:44,323
Bye, Andy, good luck
at university!

1223
01:19:44,325 --> 01:19:49,128
Thank you! Bye, Danya!
Good luck at UCLA.

1224
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:53,499
You're an ass! Do you know how
much it cost me...

1225
01:19:53,501 --> 01:19:56,035
To fly her over here
and then you end up with her?

1226
01:19:56,037 --> 01:19:59,071
As the proverb goes...

1228
01:20:02,443 --> 01:20:04,377
What does that mean?

1229
01:20:06,381 --> 01:20:09,015
"Luck exists in the leftovers."

1230
01:20:33,575 --> 01:20:37,910
What?
Yep.

1231
01:20:37,912 --> 01:20:40,179
It's not fun.

1232
01:20:40,181 --> 01:20:42,982
Hey, thanks for saving my life.

1233
01:20:42,984 --> 01:20:45,318
Come on, bro, you would
have done the same for me.

1234
01:20:46,554 --> 01:20:49,088
Love you.
Love you, man.

1235
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:55,328
Was a kick-ass summer, guys.

1236
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:58,898
Yeah, kinda sucks, though,
I'm gonna miss you guys a lot.

1237
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,366
I'm gonna miss you guys, too.

1238
01:21:00,368 --> 01:21:06,072
And it does suck but...
We're gonna be okay.

1239
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:09,141
You better make people
call you spice at Stanford.

1240
01:21:09,143 --> 01:21:12,144
I don't know, man, I think I'm
gonna kick it off with, Mike.

1241
01:21:12,146 --> 01:21:14,530
Mike?

1242
01:21:14,531 --> 01:21:16,915
See where it evolves from
there. What's wrong with that?

1243
01:21:28,329 --> 01:21:30,062
Hey!

1244
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,508
See you, guys.
Bye.

1245
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:44,210
Hey, I miss you guys already!

1246
01:21:44,212 --> 01:21:45,611
Love you!

1247
01:21:47,448 --> 01:21:48,448
Ow!

1248
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:04,814
Next time, I'm gonna see you...

1249
01:22:04,815 --> 01:22:06,999
You're gonna have a Dartmouth
meathead beer gut.

1250
01:22:07,001 --> 01:22:10,002
Next time I see you, you'll
be pregnant by a Kennedy.

1251
01:22:10,004 --> 01:22:13,572
Cool, we'll just hang around
admiring each other's bellies.

1252
01:22:13,574 --> 01:22:15,508
Love it.
Perfect.

1253
01:22:18,713 --> 01:22:22,048
Don't make any new friends
at school, please.

1254
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:25,384
Okay... you, either.

1255
01:22:25,386 --> 01:22:27,253
Deal.

1256
01:22:27,255 --> 01:22:30,089
I love you, too.

1257
01:22:30,091 --> 01:22:35,494
I just didn't say it at that
weird, evil steel mill.

1258
01:22:35,496 --> 01:22:38,364
You know, it was a bad setting.

1259
01:24:14,529 --> 01:24:16,295
Hey, Andy, heads up!

1260
01:24:17,765 --> 01:24:20,232
Hey, Tinsley.
Hey.

1261
01:24:22,837 --> 01:24:26,772
Nicely done. Automatic.

1262
01:24:26,774 --> 01:24:29,308
Thanks. I'm Andy.

1263
01:24:31,746 --> 01:24:33,479
Hey.
