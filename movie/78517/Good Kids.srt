1
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,250
Yo, we're gonna look for dead
bodies at the Seneda warehouse.

2
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,390
You wanna come?

3
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,090
What will you do if you
actually find a dead body?

4
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,660
Roll it over!

5
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,870
Yeah, we'll probably
roll it over.

6
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,230
Are you going into forensics?

7
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,540
Why would we go there?

8
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,370
I think we're just gonna
stay here.

9
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,110
Yeah.

10
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,450
Suit yourselves.

11
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,290
Hammer toss!

12
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,460
Oh, shit! Hold up.
Extra large slush puppies?

13
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,330
Really?

14
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,200
You know, I don't care what they
say, you guys know how to party.

15
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,510
Seriously. Seriously.

16
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,870
I hate this town.

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,140
Are you kidding me, man!

18
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,250
Whatever drugs everyone is on
seem to be working pretty well.

19
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,180
Is this the big reward?

20
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,820
I mean, did we really
not get invited...

21
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,650
To any graduation parties?

22
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,460
Come on, if you don't get
invited to a single party...

23
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,590
For four years straight, you
don't generally get invited...

24
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,830
Yeah, well, it's graduation, you
graduate together as a class...

25
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,300
So you'd think after...

26
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,930
Dude, we traded cool
for college.

27
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,370
Yeah, i...

28
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,240
All I'm saying is, I'm looking
at this thing...

29
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,570
And I don't feel as good
as the people out there.

30
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,210
We're just sitting here.

31
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,510
Bro, what were you expecting?

32
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,610
I don't know. Something cool.

33
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,290
I'll just take us home.

34
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,000
Hello, Andy.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,960
Hey, Yaco.

36
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,730
Have you been looking forward
to another summer...

37
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,700
As much as I have?

38
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,770
Last year you were only
a janitor.

39
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,440
Groundskeeper, actually.

40
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,440
But this year you're a pro!

41
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,710
You realize this could only
happen with my blessing.

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,520
You are my beggar apostle
and I am your Christ.

43
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,290
Well, I appreciate you putting
in a good word with the board.

44
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,990
After lunch, you'll be teaching
the beginner ladies classes...

45
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,760
And Salvatore will be handling
the men.

46
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,860
Okay, cool.

47
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,300
Any tips for the new guy?

48
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,570
Do not let the women chat
with each other.

49
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,940
Once they start, they learn
nothing.

50
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,540
You have to be a man.

51
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,280
Yeah, my dad says that, too.

52
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,790
Muay Thai, punch!

53
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,030
Guys, in the
post-apocalyptic future,

54
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,630
in which we survive by
eating cats and the elderly,

55
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,100
you will need to know how
to punch. Stop smiling.

56
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,940
In the future, smiling will
be seen as a sign

57
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,410
you wish to be eaten. Hai!

58
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,780
As a parting thought...

59
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,750
Remember, the prickliest
cactus can still give you water.

60
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,790
Class dismissed.

61
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,860
What did that cactus mean?

62
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,630
What do you think it means?

63
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,560
Something scary can be good?

64
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,900
That's right. Don't be afraid
of something for how it looks...

65
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,970
Because it might be special
inside.

66
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,970
Hey, you!
Hi!

67
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,780
Oh... olive,
you know this lady?

68
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,010
She's my cousin!

69
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,750
Hey, hey, I'm just making sure.

70
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,050
Rival Dojos are trying to steal
my students all the time...

71
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,880
Because you're the best.

72
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,520
I'm Tinsley. Olive's
mom asked me to pick her up.

73
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,050
How's it going? I'm the lion.

74
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,990
I haven't seen you before.

75
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,890
Yeah, I come here every summer.

76
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,160
I haven't seen you before.

77
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,960
Oh yeah, I'm one of the locals.

78
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,030
Oh, wow, I don't
think I've ever met a local.

79
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,900
They hide us
during the summer...

80
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,170
So we don't upset the tourists.

81
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,000
The lion should come to your
party.

82
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,470
Yes, I'm having
a party at my parent's house...

83
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,570
On the point this afternoon.
You should come!

84
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,040
I'm sorry, are you
inviting me to a party?

85
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,150
Yeah, I am.

86
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,950
But... but, I'm me.

87
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,420
You can bring whoever you want.

88
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,490
I'll see you later today.
Bye.

89
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,690
- Take care.
- Thank you!

90
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,820
See you, guys.
Was that fun?

91
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,920
Yeah!

92
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,160
Oh!

93
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,730
You are the man, lion!

94
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,800
Good looks! Good looks!

95
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,200
Wow, you weren't even
nervous, bro. I'm all right.

96
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,740
No, I was pretty nervous.

97
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,140
So, Andy, have
you heard anything...

98
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,770
From your imaginary
Indian pen pal?

99
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,480
Yes, she actually
wants to come to the cape...

100
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,880
In August before
she goes to UCLA.

101
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,780
Whoa...

102
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,950
But apparently, it's $2,000
to get her here from Mumbai...

103
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,880
In the summer, so I want
to figure out a way to help.

104
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,720
So, out of curiosity,
when she emails you...

105
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,590
Does it go to your spam folder
and you have to drag it out?

106
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,590
Yeah, sometimes, because
she's from a far away place.

107
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,560
Uh, okay, have you guys
skyped at all?

108
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,130
No, she's from a remote area
and her family's computer...

109
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,130
Doesn't have a working camera.

110
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,770
It's not a scheme, you guys,
okay? She's exists!

111
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,640
Bro, I still don't entirely
understand how you met her.

112
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,070
I told you a million times,
she's an econ nerd, too...

113
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,910
She posts comments on a website
that I read and I emailed her...

114
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,680
That I liked her ideas
and we hit it off.

115
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,080
It's your murderer...

116
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,620
These are the last months
of your life, bro.

117
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,920
Let's say that this girl
is real.

118
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,520
She's gonna have way more
experience than you.

119
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Okay, Cleopatra,
how do you know that?

120
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,590
Under what scenario could a
human being on this earth...

121
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,190
Not have more
experience than you?

122
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,130
I've been... I've
done... I've done things.

123
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,760
Oh, and India
has the Kama Sutra, bro.

124
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,670
Exactly! India
has the Kama Sutra.

125
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,870
Yeah, they like, fuck
sideways and shit, bro.

126
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,670
That's intimidating for anybody.
It is.

127
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,570
I'm not intimidated.

128
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,780
Did that shirt
shrink in the wash?

129
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,280
No, I don't know, I can't really
figure out what happened.

130
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

131
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,550
Oh, yes! Sweet!
Wow, crazy!

132
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,690
Just a little something new
I'm working with.

133
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,720
If I can't impress my friends,
there's no way I'm gonna...

134
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,190
Be impressing the
food network, so... dig in!

135
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,960
Oh, yeah, this looks great.
Guys, guys, guys...

136
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,100
I waited until
we were all together...

137
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,200
To bring this up,
but I have information.

138
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,800
About what?

139
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,000
About a party on the point.

140
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,970
To be specific, I have
an invitation to a party...

141
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,040
On the point this afternoon
and I can bring anyone I want!

142
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,010
Okay, calm down.
Who invited you to the point?

143
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,010
I've never been on the point.
Yeah, me, neither.

144
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,550
You're sure this is true? We're
invited to an actual party?

145
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,720
Bro, bro, bro, no, it's real!

146
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,120
And it starts today
and goes all night!

147
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,160
I'm assuming, I'm assuming.

148
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,660
I don't know, man, I gotta
finish up here after lunch.

149
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,200
I have an 11:00 o'clock
curfew...

150
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
So it's like it doesn't
even make sense to go.

151
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,570
Two "no's" immediately
from the group!

152
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,570
I mean, you're going to Harvard,
why do you need a curfew?

153
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,170
Curfews are for riot zones
and crumbling dictatorships...

154
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,240
Not for us!

155
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,040
Dramatic.

156
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,180
Lion, what would happen if
you missed your curfew today?

157
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,050
Huh? You're going to
Mit on scholarship.

158
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,010
You know, my parents actually
don't get home...

159
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,780
Until like 4:00 am
most weekends.

160
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,790
I'm starting to think
they're swingers, man.

161
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,590
Stanford-bound spice, you?

162
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,320
I've been here until 2:00
before.

163
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,890
My parents will probably
just think I'm here.

164
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,090
There you go.
What are you trying to say, bro?

165
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,230
- Andy!
- Dude!

166
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,630
Whoo!
Whoo!

167
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,030
You know I have
to clean that up, right?

168
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,370
That was badass! Yes!
Yeah! Yes!

169
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,840
Breaking stuff!

170
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,610
You know I work here, don't you?

171
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,340
I'm sorry about the glass,
I'm trying to make a point.

172
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,010
The reason that we never
partied in high school...

173
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,110
Is because we wanted
to get out of here.

174
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,910
And now we are! And I feel
like I missed out on some...

175
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,250
Experiences and I
know you guys do, too.

176
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,920
Lion, what do you
wish you'd done?

177
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,320
Uh... ancient Asians
took this mushroom called...

178
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,090
Fly Agaric, by feeding
it to reindeer and drinking...

179
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,290
Its urine for
psychedelic effects.

180
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,930
What?

181
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,230
You're talking
about doing some drugs?

182
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,770
Put some drugs in you!

183
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,700
Nora, what do you want to do?

184
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,240
Uh, I think it would have
been cool to have a boyfriend.

185
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,770
Why are you laughing?

186
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,640
I don't... I don't think
we knew that.

187
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,140
It's not that uncommon a thing.

188
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,150
Go get yourself a boyfriend!

189
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,150
Wow, thank you
for your approval, Andy.

190
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,250
Spice? Talk to me.

191
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,350
You know, I'm ready
to hook up with a girl.

192
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,260
Mm-hm.
I need release.

193
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,420
Release, release!
Say no more.

194
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,720
Thank you.
We know what that means.

195
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,390
Yeah, I do.

196
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,360
What I'm saying, is this
afternoon, starting at this...

197
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,770
Party, we do all the things
that we wish we'd done...

198
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,970
The last four years.

199
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,740
Drinking, drugs, sex...
With girls.

200
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,980
Release yourself! Relationships!
I want hard miles!

201
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,810
I don't want to go to college
as some lamb...

202
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,110
Being led to slaughter.

203
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,380
I don't want to be
boring anymore.

204
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,420
From now on, this is the
summer of "yes!"

205
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,020
Let's just say, "yes!"

206
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,020
Say, "yes!"
Yes!

207
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,960
Spice?
Hell, yeah.

208
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,730
Yeah!

209
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,200
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes!

210
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,240
All right, welcome to summer!

211
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,710
Okay, Gabby, here we go.

212
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,240
Whoa, Gabby!

213
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,180
Oh! That's it!

214
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,210
I love your visor, Mrs. Jones.

215
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,850
Here's our star player
right here.

216
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,020
- This is our star tennis player.
- Whoo!

217
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,790
You just dance around the court.

218
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,920
That winter was too long, huh?

219
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,420
Uh-huh!
Too long.

220
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,760
Nice! Strong!
Beautiful stroke.

221
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,430
That's way over there,
that's a bench shot.

222
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,470
We'll give you a couple points
for hitting the bench.

223
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,830
Okay, Gabby, here we go.

224
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,340
Now, Gabby, you're doing this,
right?

225
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,380
And we're going to need more of
just sort of like a this, right?

226
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,020
Good group, great group, wow.

227
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,360
Andy?
Yeah?

228
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
When did you turn 18?

229
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,760
Uh, January.

230
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,160
Happy birthday.

231
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,610
It was, uh...

232
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,060
You know what? You should
come over for drinks sometime.

233
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,970
18 is the drinking
age in most of the world.

234
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,440
I should have been born foreign.

235
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,270
Being a tennis pro
automatically makes you foreign.

236
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,840
Well, then, c'est parfait.

237
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,510
You're not!

238
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,350
Thinking.

239
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,220
Andy, do you teach private
tennis lessons?

240
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,960
Don't all pros?

241
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,060
In my experience.

242
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,830
Hm...

243
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,300
Why in the world would Danya
be sending bikini pictures...

244
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,830
To you that early in the morning
on a Sunday, bro?

245
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,570
She is an insomniac,
that's why...

246
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,070
And it's not unusual
for her to email me late.

247
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,410
You are so talking to
a guy sitting in his attic...

248
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,280
In Worchester wearing
clown makeup.

249
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,880
Let's do this, guys.

250
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,180
Here we go.

251
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,160
Let me see. Right here,
the lion, great.

252
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,590
Hey, you guys have a good time,
be safe, okay? We'll see ya.

253
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,260
All right.
Thank you.

254
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,560
Okay!

255
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
We're gonna go to a party!

256
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,430
I just think that this...

257
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,310
It's crazy that this is in our
town, you know what I mean?

258
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,180
I know, that this
actually exists here...

259
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,090
Like minutes away from us.

260
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,220
Right.
Whoa.

261
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,140
It's like if
George Washington...

262
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,500
And Norman Rockwell fucked and
had kids and they had houses.

263
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,230
Oh, dude!

264
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,200
I finally know
how bad our lives suck.

265
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,500
This is crazy.

266
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,570
Massive.

267
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,100
That is a
shitload of individuals.

268
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,210
Can I just park here?

269
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,910
If you're going
to park here, Andy...

270
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,180
You have to be really careful,
seriously!

271
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,080
He's gonna hit...
I'm not gonna hit anything.

272
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,450
What a nice spot we got!

273
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,150
Should we like kick it
for five or 20 minutes?

274
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,960
No, we're going in.

275
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,420
Just say, "yes."

276
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,400
Say, "yes."

277
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,340
Wow, I am a prairie dog
in heaven right now.

278
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,210
I don't know what to do
with my hands.

279
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,620
I think... should we just go...

280
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,090
Yeah, we go right in there,
right?

281
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,550
Everybody's, yeah...

282
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,360
Hey, oh, nice, so,
where are the drinks?

283
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,560
Yes.
Right.

284
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,060
I feel like I
could have told you that.

285
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,000
You the man, bro. Okay.
Do they have beers, too?

286
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,320
We don't belong here.

287
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,880
Yes, we do.

288
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,430
All right, we're just
uncomfortable...

289
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,130
Because we don't have drinks
in our hands.

290
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,130
Let's go.

291
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,310
The drinks are up there.

292
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,760
What are you doing?
No idea!

293
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,360
Ooh, shoot.

294
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,530
Okay... okay... drinks.

295
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,540
Starting now,
"yes" to everything.

296
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,470
Yes!
Yes!

297
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,740
Yes!

298
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,080
Dude, I'm gonna...

299
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,720
It's like fire in my body.

300
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,090
I'm gonna throw up!

301
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,560
There's a fire in my body.

302
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,230
No, seriously, I wouldn't
lie about Midgetville.

303
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,770
And for the record, we wish it
was called something else...

304
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,640
Too, but... maybe we can
be the change.

305
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,110
I don't know what I'm saying.

306
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,710
These guys are different.

307
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,110
Dragon.

308
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,380
Oh...

309
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,150
Rahrr...

310
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,590
Nora! Thought I saw you.
Come have a cigarette.

311
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,460
No, I don't... I don't...
Come on.

312
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,360
Of course, I do,
because it's the summer of yes.

313
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,270
So pretty.

314
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,200
You have that right.
Tinsley, this is Nora.

315
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,600
Hey.
Hi.

316
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,110
Hi, Tinsley.
We work at the lab together.

317
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,170
Thank you. Oh...

318
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,820
Well, that's so... you're here,
we're both here, that...

319
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,320
Yeah, I'm staying down
the road with some friends...

320
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,290
And their son dragged me along.
Oh, cool.

321
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,420
I think I'm the oldest
person here by about ten years.

322
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,230
I love your dress, by the way.
Oh.

323
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,400
God, I wish I had boobs
like yours.

324
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,050
Hmm.

325
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,200
There's no way, it's the hardest
dessert to make in the world.

326
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,380
No, I'm telling you, spice could
make a soufflé right now...

327
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,210
And it would be delicious.

328
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,850
It would instantly
collapse. This party's loud.

329
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,820
No, no, okay, I bet you $100...

330
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,250
$100 that I could
make a soufflé right now...

331
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,190
And it'll stay standing,
it will not collapse.

332
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,630
You're on.

333
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,660
$100?

334
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,400
Hey, give me those mitts!
Is that flour?

335
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,170
Oh, that's cocaine!

336
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,800
What are your
hidden talents, Andy?

337
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,640
My hidden talents...
Well, it's pretty useless...

338
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,480
But I can catch food thrown
from any distance, in my mouth.

339
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,850
Mmm, okay.

340
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,890
Oh, you're gonna do it? Okay.

341
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,420
You can go bigger than that.

342
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,460
Okay, wait, okay, I'm not...
I'm serious...

343
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,200
I'm not messing around
right now! Come on!

344
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,740
I catch stuff!
I catch stuff in my mouth!

345
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,310
I catch marshmallows
in my mouth! Woo!

346
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:11,650
Is he doing, high Tai chi?

347
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,520
"High chi?"

348
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,560
Just say, "yes?"

349
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,000
Summer of yes, this is good,
this is good.

350
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,970
I don't like cold water...

351
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,640
So, maybe we can
take our clothes off inside.

352
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,810
Oh... yes... yes.

353
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,480
It has risen!

354
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,720
I am the greatest chef
on this planet!

355
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,690
Consider comping the check?

356
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,830
We can think of something.

357
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Take off those mittens.

358
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,910
Hey.

359
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,650
Hi.

360
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,720
I think this is the part where
you take your clothes off, too.

361
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,060
Yeah, me, yeah.

362
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,530
You're like freakishly tall,
huh?

363
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,560
Yeah.

364
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,900
That's a really cool bag.
Or is it a clutch? Or...

365
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,380
You haven't done this before,
have you?

366
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,780
No.

367
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,450
And I actually need like 10,000
practice hours before August.

368
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,550
Malcolm Gladwell, outliers?

369
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,790
Yeah, I need to be an expert.

370
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,990
Why?

371
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,860
I have this Indian
girl coming to visit me.

372
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,960
They have the Kama Sutra.

373
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,430
I... exactly.

374
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,700
But, I'm sorry, I'm like talking
about another girl and...

375
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,810
On the bed... now!

376
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,940
Yes... on the bed.

377
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,350
Relax.

378
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,690
We can at least knock a couple
of minutes...

379
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,790
Off those 10,000 hours.

380
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,630
Are you gonna keep doing
that face?

381
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,150
I know, it's... I feel like
making out on the beach...

382
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,620
Is less comfortable than it
looks on TV.

383
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,090
Yeah. Your body is amazing.

384
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,690
Really?
Yes!

385
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,960
Whoa, thank you. That's new.

386
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,160
Yeah?
Yeah.

387
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,870
I understand what you want, but
I'm not a hand job machine!

388
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,580
I have to feel special about
someone...

389
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,010
Before I give them a hand job.

390
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,110
I thought the soufflé
was special.

391
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,650
If you had tried some
subtlety...

392
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,850
Instead of moving your hips
all creepily...

393
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,160
You would have got one.

394
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,020
But...

395
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,860
Go fuck your soufflé!

396
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:48,130
Where have you been?
We have been worried!

397
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,730
Sorry.

398
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,570
What have you been up
to tonight?

399
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,970
Not too much... goodnight.

400
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,000
Please just send me to my room.

401
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,670
Thank you.

402
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,840
What do you think happened
to him?

403
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,880
I don't know, but I'm jealous.

404
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,960
Oh, jeez, feel free to pass me
a new skull, man, honestly.

405
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,530
Yeah, no, I can feel my brain
decaying lobe by lobe.

406
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,000
Andy, hey, Andy!

407
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,200
Dude. Oh!

408
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,310
That's what I'm talking about.

409
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,970
Why are people
throwing food at you?

410
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,180
Oh, you were skinny dipping
with a 30-year-old man...

411
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,550
During my performance.

412
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,880
It was glorious.

413
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
When did you get a body, anyway?
Last night.

414
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,790
Hmm, that's pretty
crazy. You're finally a girl.

415
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,250
Thank you.

416
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,290
Must have been awkward
today with your coworker.

417
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,990
No, no, we're gonna actually
hang out again later this week.

418
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,190
Alone?

419
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,600
Yeah... summer of yes.

420
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,270
Are you hanging out
with anybody alone, lion?

421
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,770
Oh, uh, just some guys
who have an opium connection.

422
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,070
Well, you guys had fun...

423
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,880
I don't think that girl
wants to see me again.

424
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,910
No release?

425
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,460
Not a drop.

426
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,020
But I did get us invited
to another party... on a dock.

427
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,020
Two rich girls invited me.

428
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,990
Boom.

429
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,190
Round two!
Really?

430
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,890
Yeah, man!
Guys, guys?

431
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,760
Have we somehow become cool?

432
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,340
Whoa, whoa.
Hey.

433
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,940
Hey, you again.

434
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,380
Um, I'm actually here
to teach a lesson.

435
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,750
And to pick up my
car from the party.

436
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,820
We walked home.

437
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,820
Lion swam, I think.

438
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,750
See ya!

439
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,880
Gabby, it's Andy!
It's lesson time.

440
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,970
Uh, Gabby, are you in here?

441
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,240
I'm almost done.

442
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,770
I left your money
on the night table.

443
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,670
Okay, okay, cool.

444
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,010
I'm so glad you could come.

445
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,540
Me, too.

446
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,080
It's weird, I didn't see
your court coming in here.

447
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,750
That's because
there is no court.

448
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:01,020
Holy shit! Gabby, wait,
Gabby, what are you doing?

449
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,090
Gabby... Gabby!

450
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,090
Shut up, Andy.

451
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,690
Okay.

452
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,340
Five times?

453
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,710
Five times.

454
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,150
It's like the olym...
The Olympics or something.

455
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,720
The "vagathalon."

456
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,360
Hey, all right. Hey now.

457
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,830
What kind of tennis
lesson takes three hours?

458
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:52,900
Oh, we were just, uh, working
on strokes... techniques.

459
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:57,040
Forehand, backhand... grips.

460
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,810
See ya!

461
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,400
I think the lion is taking acid.

462
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,040
Yeah, he said he wants to
push his body to its limits.

463
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,340
Does Tai chi help with fighting?

464
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,210
Bruce Lee once said...

465
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,550
"A wise man can learn more
from a foolish question...

466
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,190
"Then a fool can learn
from a wise answer."

467
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,130
Have you ever used it to fight?

468
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,130
When it's finally
time for me to fight...

469
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,340
I'll know.

470
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:04,380
Oh jeez, look at that.
Who's this guy?

471
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,140
Is he her boyfriend now
or something?

472
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,220
What kind of Australian
is named, Erland?

473
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,180
Who cares, she's happy.

474
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,220
He's 12 years older than her.

475
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,090
Yeah, and if I was
30 years old...

476
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,320
I'd be wanting to nail
18-year-olds too, man.

477
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,930
Guy's a creep.

478
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,360
Holy shit!

479
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,530
Hm?

480
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,330
You like Nora!

481
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,140
I like nor... are you out
of your mind?

482
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,070
She's been my friend
since I was born.

483
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,070
Yeah, and until recently
she's dressed like a guy...

484
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,470
And you've looked like an
acupuncture needle.

485
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,880
You're jealous.

486
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,180
Look, I don't know
what I'm feeling.

487
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,580
You poor, sensitive,
tragic soul, you.

488
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,250
Three days ago, a 42-year-old
woman paid me...

489
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,450
To have sex with her.

490
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,520
No.

491
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,560
Yeah, "private tennis lesson."

492
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,460
I've got two more scheduled
with her this week.

493
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,230
How's that for sensitive?

494
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,000
Not sensitive at all.
Holy shit, man!

495
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,370
You know how I'm gonna prove
to you that Danya is real?

496
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,570
I'm gonna fly her out
here myself.

497
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,380
I'm gonna put her up in
a fancy bed and breakfast.

498
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,110
I'm gonna seduce her
at fine dinners...

499
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:18,150
That I pay for and
it's gonna be magic.

500
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,520
Ha!

501
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,320
Now, if you'll excuse me...

502
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,190
I've gotta wash off the sight
of that.

503
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,540
Whoo!

504
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,210
Andy!

505
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,340
Fuck, yeah!

506
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,050
Andy?

507
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,550
Victoria! Hey, looking good
out there.

508
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,620
Thanks.

509
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,130
Um, you know, Gabby told me that
you were giving private lessons.

510
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,960
$150 an hour, is that right?

511
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,370
You... you mean a full lesson?

512
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:14,240
Yeah, a full lesson.

513
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,210
Tomorrow at 4:00, okay?

514
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,710
My schedule is open,
I can do it tomorrow, I can...

515
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,380
My address is on the call sheet.

516
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
What!

517
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,730
Oh, you're so
much hotter than my mom!

518
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,140
Yeah!

519
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,610
Oh, my god!

520
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,700
And this.

521
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,040
I will end you... ready?

522
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,080
S'il vous plait!
S'il vous plait... ow!

523
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,340
And this, please.

524
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,110
Open that pretty mouth.

525
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,660
Another hole-in-one.

526
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:16,060
Can you please stop using
Qi gong to influence the ball?

527
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,690
This isn't fun for us.

528
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,160
Andy, Qi gong isn't something
I can just turn on and off.

529
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:24,170
Right, I'm gonna try my hand
at this.

530
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,170
Oh, stop traffic.

531
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:29,540
Yes.
Oh, my, thank you.

532
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,810
Did you guys pay a hot
girl to follow you around?

533
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,210
Great strategy, seriously.

534
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,780
I think that's
Nora Sullivan, dude.

535
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,720
Yes, my name... I'm Nora.

536
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,220
Holy shit, you're right.

537
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,490
Way to get in early, guys,
seriously...

538
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,620
I like the strategy.
Hey, honestly.

539
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,820
Are you sexually active?

540
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,190
That's so offensive.

541
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,630
You know what, and also,
you guys never talked to us...

542
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,360
Before, so you don't really
get to start now.

543
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,530
Can you just fuck off!

544
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,630
All right, Nora.

545
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,770
Wow.
Okay, all right...

546
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,500
I thought she was quiet,
it's cool.

547
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,140
Okay, we'll catch you guys
on the last hole, all right?

548
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,470
We'll fuck off for now,
we'll be back later.

549
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,410
Bye-ee!
Jeez...

550
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,740
God, I hate those guys.

551
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,580
How do they not know
people like us now?

552
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,250
Hey man, it's just
different circles.

553
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,250
Hey, speaking of different
circles.

554
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,650
Now how is that "airland" doing?

555
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,380
Erland?
Erland.

556
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,550
Does he have talents aside
from being handsome?

557
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,220
He tries to write pop songs.

558
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,260
Oh, no, Australians do
have a natural sense of rhythm.

559
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,660
Look, he's 30, you're 18,
he's not with you...

560
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,200
Because he wants you to edit
his post-doctoral thesis.

561
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,870
Um, I'm pretty sure that
you and I discussing...

562
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,470
My relationship is
none of your business.

563
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,640
Relationship?
Yes!

564
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
It's a relationship?
Yes!

565
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Is he your boyfriend?
Yep... yep. He's my boyfriend.

566
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,610
There's no way he's your
boyfriend!

567
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,620
I'm done with mini golf...

568
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,750
So I'll just wait in the car
for you guys?

569
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,250
Is that cool? So...

570
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,360
Nora?

571
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,930
Are you serious? You're calling
her out on the age difference?

572
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,430
Yo, lion, you know Andy here
has been having sex...

573
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,900
With older women from the club
for money.

574
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,840
Holy tits, you're
a hooker? Pound that shit.

575
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,410
I'm not... thank you.
I'm not a hooker.

576
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:14,510
I'm... getting some experience
and I'm teaching them lessons.

577
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,550
Dude, they're not lessons!

578
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,250
God...

579
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,390
They're technically lessons.

580
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,380
Please don't be a catfish.

581
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,640
Are you just rhyming
my name with other girl's names?

582
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,380
Have you tried to rhyme
your name?

583
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,580
Girls' names are all there are.

584
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,250
Something on your mind?

585
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,930
I, uh, got into a fight with a
friend at mini golf, it was bad.

586
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:38,000
You want to do something
to get out of your head?

587
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,800
Well, what are you thinking?

588
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,670
The world behind the curtains.

589
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,480
Crap, this is so cool.

590
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,980
And here is the autonomous
underwater vehicle, "fetch."

591
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,880
Fetch.
Center point of our research.

592
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,080
Uh-huh.

593
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,280
Collector of good data
on specimens...

594
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,620
Ranging from the Acan coral...

595
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,790
From the Netherlands Antilles...

596
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,720
Through to the fur seal
populations...

597
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,420
In the Shetland islands
of Antarctica.

598
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,930
And black hydrothermal
smoker vents in the Galapagos.

599
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:12,800
That's correct, yeah,
black smoker hydrothermal vents.

600
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,060
These things are worth like...

601
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,700
A quarter of a million
dollars a piece.

602
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,570
Ten more years of education...

603
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,740
And maybe I'll feel like I
actually deserve to be in here.

604
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,510
This is a robotics lab,
are you joking?

605
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,710
No.

606
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,920
Are you my boyfriend?

607
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
Come on, Nora.

608
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,650
Are you?

609
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,420
Yes, yes, of course,
I'm your boyfriend, Nora.

610
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,590
Hmm.

611
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,460
I care about you.

612
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,930
Do you?

613
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,960
I do.

614
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,660
How much?

615
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,740
I... have this!

616
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,860
Oh, my god.

617
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,940
Okay, okay, but you've
gotta admit...

618
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,040
You'd have a virginity story...

619
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,510
Better than any of your friends,
right?

620
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,780
Who the hell says
that I'm a virgin?

621
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,050
Clearly, you've never been to a
national high school leaders...

622
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,420
Of tomorrow conference.

623
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,850
Yeah, clearly I haven't.

624
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,470
Hm?

625
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,770
What's the matter?

626
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,040
Uh, nothing.

627
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,680
It's just girl stuff.

628
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,610
Client?

629
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,120
You understand, I'm not
a prostitute, right?

630
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,750
I'm going to Dartmouth.

631
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,660
Well, then you should have
waited to start...

632
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,560
Your career as a sex worker
until you got to New Hampshire.

633
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,160
No state income tax.

634
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,570
You think I have
to declare this?

635
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,530
Gabby, I'm home!

636
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,070
Whoa!
Oh, my god, you have to go!

637
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,470
Is that...?
Go that way now!

638
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,940
My clothes are in...

639
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,410
I don't care, my husband's
gonna walk in this... go, go!

640
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,150
Woo-hoo!

641
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,080
Don't you look handsome.

642
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,120
Stupid! You're so stupid!

643
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,050
You are so stupid,
you are an idiot, you're dumb.

644
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,660
No, no, no.

645
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,990
They've made some great
additions to this course.

646
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,030
It's challenging, but fun.

647
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:37,870
They also have go-karts
at this place now.

648
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,900
Thank you for this
blanket, by the way.

649
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,640
Yeah, just make sure
it's all the way...

650
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,840
Between you and the seat.

651
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,300
Golden boy!

652
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,650
What are you in for, naked
insider trading or something?

653
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,850
Huh? Hey, numbers in the nude!

654
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,890
Calculous with your cockulous?

655
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:00,190
Aw... it's great
to see you, Plymouth rock.

656
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,660
Why is he making fun
of you, you know about math?

657
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,260
A little bit.

658
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,730
Can I ask you something?

659
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,170
Sure, you have me under arrest.

660
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,600
I'm taking out a mortgage.

661
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,010
These numbers just
don't seem to add up.

662
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,210
I'm not a banker,
but I can take a look.

663
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:31,290
Okay, so, that's it, the problem
here is that this number here...

664
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,320
Is based on a 30-year
amortization...

665
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,790
When you wanted a 20, right?

666
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,480
Right.

667
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,160
Your instincts were right,
this is a clerical error.

668
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,660
They blew it.

669
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,130
Hey, thank you, man.

670
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,000
You probably saved me a ton
of money.

671
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,170
Well, you have good reason
to be upset at your lender.

672
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,670
Now, does this maybe
change things...

673
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,140
In terms of the naked
in the car situation?

674
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:57,850
What? No! I already
wrote it up.

675
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,620
You know you can't
just drive around town...

676
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,590
Showing your ass like that,
right?

677
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,790
You know, I'm just saying...
You know that?

678
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,960
I do you a favor,
you do me a favor.

679
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,820
Like I rub your back,
you rub mine.

680
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,230
Okay, I did not rub anything!

681
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,960
I wasn't... I had a scorecard
there...

682
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,900
Maybe you saw the outline
of things, but that's all I had.

683
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,630
That's enough, the outline
is enough.

684
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:20,370
Don't show that too tall ass
around here again.

685
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,110
Hey, Yaco. Salvatore!
What's up?

686
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,120
Heard about your driving
incident.

687
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,050
Yeah, yeah, it was crazy,
just a dare gone wrong.

688
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,160
Oh, Gabby dared you to
flee from her house naked?

689
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,960
How do you know?

690
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,460
I, too, am fucking Gabby.

691
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,970
For many years now. All the
things she does with her pinky,

692
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,330
I know all about this.
As do I!

693
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,190
No!

694
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,040
And now you start doing the
same and you almost get caught.

695
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,140
If you get caught, suspicion
falls on all the pros...

696
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,080
At the club, does it not?

697
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,220
Such sloppy behavior we cannot
risk.

698
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,320
No more sleeping with women.
You will ruin everything.

699
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,220
Keep your beef and the chorizo
somewhere else...

700
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,090
You can't tell me where
to put my chorizo.

701
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,890
I can.
It's my chorizo...

702
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,330
Stop giving private lessons
or you are fired.

703
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,900
You were my apostle.

704
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,340
Little did I know,
that apostle was... Judas.

705
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,370
What?

706
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,810
You betray me not with a kiss,
but with a fuck! What the fuck?

707
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,480
Yaco...

708
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,280
Andiamo, Salvatore.
Salvatore, you get it.

709
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,910
No!

710
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,950
Salvatore!

711
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,020
Salvatore...

712
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,940
Did you find going to
public school a disadvantage...

713
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,470
For your college application?

714
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,910
You know, tins, honestly
if you're smart enough...

715
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,670
It doesn't really matter
where you come from?

716
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,320
Now, uh...

717
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
Don't worry, I got the goods
in here.

718
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,290
Let's go.
Yeah.

719
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,390
Wow, Mit and drugs.

720
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,420
He'll probably solve cold
fusion his freshman year.

721
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:24,190
Probably.

722
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,960
I'm pretty sure you don't know
lion well enough...

723
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,130
To weigh in on what
he's gonna do.

724
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,580
Andy, what are you doing?

725
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,030
Yeah, we're all going to college
pretty soon...

726
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,940
What do you got going?

727
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,370
Maybe... isn't there a kangaroo
helicopter...

728
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:39,910
With like digeridoo blades
that can come grab you...

729
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,910
And haul you back to Australia,
so you're not in my face...

730
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,180
Every moment of the rest
of the summer?

731
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,180
You know what, Andy,
I'm sure there is.

732
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,850
But you see, kangaroo
helicopters with digeridoo...

733
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,060
Blades, they breakdown pretty
easily, so...

734
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,830
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you're a funny man!

735
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:00,130
I can't stand you!

736
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,030
One... I'm just... I'm so...
That's cool.

737
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,100
I like you.

738
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:09,310
30-year-old,
I'm gonna fuck with a dad?

739
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,510
I'm speaking to you, Andy!

740
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,210
Totally fucking unacceptable!

741
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:17,950
What is wrong with you lately?

742
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,350
I'll go apologize!

743
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,120
That's not what I want, I want
you to tell me...

744
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,320
What is going on right now!

745
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,560
There's three weeks left
of summer...

746
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,830
And I don't want to share
that time with "airland."

747
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,030
Well, his name is Erland.

748
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:32,130
Whatever.

749
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,960
And he's not even around
that much.

750
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:35,200
He's around whenever
you're around.

751
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,570
He's my boyfriend.

752
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,950
Right.

753
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:41,340
Whoa, why are you like
trying to ruin this for me?

754
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,170
I'm not trying! Why are you...

755
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,760
Why did you do...

756
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,340
Dude, what did I do, just tell
me what I did, what did I do?

757
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,040
You got a guy and
you're all lovey dovey...

758
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,510
You're just some type of person
you never were before!

759
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,850
Whoa, so you're...

760
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,130
You're blossoming right now...

761
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:53,420
And you're not supposed to
blossom right now.

762
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,150
I'm sorry, but it should
be us together!

763
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:06,600
Um... okay.

764
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,370
I had no clue that you
felt this way.

765
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,410
How do you feel
this way about me?

766
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,850
I don't know, I don't
know, I don't... I just do.

767
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,150
That would be really weird.

768
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,550
No, it wouldn't.
Yeah, yes, it would.

769
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,120
It doesn't have to be.
Yeah, no, how about this.

770
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,570
Whoa, whoa!

771
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,020
See, that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

772
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,110
Stop...

773
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,190
Come here, let me show you
something else. Come here.

774
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,860
Can you come closer?

775
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,100
I want you to fuck me.

776
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,170
What?

777
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,430
I want you to fuck me.

778
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,440
Stop!

779
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,440
Okay, then why don't you try?
You say something dirty to me.

780
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,010
Try.

781
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:54,240
F... finger me.
No... finger you.

782
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,010
Okay, all right.
You... I will...

783
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,350
That's exactly, hmm. So...

784
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,350
Okay, okay, okay.
We know each other too well.

785
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,550
You've proven your point.

786
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:07,390
I feel so weird.

787
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,990
I'm sor... I'm sorry?

788
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:12,230
Whatever, like there's a beach
full of girls...

789
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,360
That think you're really cool,
for whatever reason...

790
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:16,570
And only I know the
truth, so let's just...

791
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,940
I forgot already. Didn't happen,
and it's never gonna happen.

792
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,940
So, let's just forget about it.

793
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,950
Hold on.

794
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,080
What, who is it?

795
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,320
Private tennis lesson,
I'm on call.

796
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,650
What do you mean, you're gonna
go do a private tennis lesson...

797
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,160
When you're... you've
been drinking!

798
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,530
I agree, it isn't
entirely professional.

799
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,060
Does this have something
to do...

800
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,030
With why you've been driving
around naked?

801
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:52,240
You whore!

802
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,980
So, the lion has gone
full-blown crazy.

803
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,350
Yeah, he taught me the
quivering hand technique...

804
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,580
With his palm, you know?

805
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:08,720
The touch of death?

806
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,050
Yeah, the touch of death.

807
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,660
Seems irresponsible.

808
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,660
I mean, he was high
when he told me.

809
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,090
No, no, what are you
doing, what are you doing?

810
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,360
Watch that thing, easy does it!

811
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,270
Pardon me, man.

812
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:27,170
Hey, airland! Let's have a chat.
I am sorry about earlier.

813
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,310
You're an ass, Andy.

814
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:33,340
Maybe I have been recently,
but if you hurt her...

815
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,650
I will kill you.

816
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:38,580
Okay. Come on.

817
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,280
Nailed it.

818
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,690
I don't think he's
coming back, either.

819
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,760
Hello?

820
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,260
Hi, Diana. You know what?

821
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,300
Private lessons are over.

822
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:02,070
Okay... they're back on and
I will be there in 20 minutes.

823
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,540
Thank you.
No, no, what?

824
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:09,480
I'm sorry, a client just
offered me a thousand dollars

825
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,550
for a lesson.

826
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,450
A lesson? A client?

827
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:15,180
Dude, you don't even have your
tennis racket with you...

828
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,720
Listen to yourself.

829
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,250
What the hell's happening
with my friends this summer?

830
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,490
It's like I'm the only one
that's being me. That's me.

831
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,190
Last one and I'm out.

832
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,500
Okay, so, one last big gig
before retirement?

833
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,500
That's real mature, I'm sure
that's what they all say.

834
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,500
What are you doing? Dude!

835
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,610
Diana!

836
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,720
Diana?

837
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,460
Hello?

838
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,470
Diana?

839
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,670
Andy?

840
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:13,410
Huh? What?
Conch, what are you doing?

841
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,510
What you... babysitting.

842
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,620
Someone let you babysit?

843
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,720
What the hell's that supposed
to mean?

844
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,390
Wait, I've never seen you sober.

845
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,430
You think I do my job drunk?

846
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:31,790
That's messed up, man.
Hey, get in here.

847
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,600
Sit, sit, sit.

848
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:44,240
Hey, so, what are you
doing here?

849
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,150
I was at a party.

850
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,650
Yeah?

851
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,820
And I'm looking for a Diana.

852
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,450
You mean, Ms. Bradfield?

853
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,320
Yeah, she lives next door.

854
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,190
Oh.

855
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,260
Weird person to be looking
for in your current state.

856
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,230
Ah!

857
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:10,170
Seriously? Yo, this is Andy,
we went to high school together.

858
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,440
Hello, child.

859
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,870
So, can't believe you were
at a party.

860
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,910
You never came to our parties.

861
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:24,150
He, we never, we were
never invited to his parties.

862
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:28,280
Nobody's ever invited,
they just show up.

863
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:29,790
That's what a party is.

864
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:33,790
That doesn't really...
Really apply to us, though.

865
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:38,560
Are you stupid? Because nobody
ever disliked you guys.

866
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,530
You guys are the ones
who stayed away.

867
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,470
You exiled yourselves.

868
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,370
Hard truths.

869
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,770
Anyway, shake it off, listen.

870
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,840
You should come to the
summer dump party.

871
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:56,850
Yeah, and I know how important
it is for you to feel special...

872
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,820
So, you can be my honored
guests.

873
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,520
Summer dump?

874
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,220
I would love that. When is it?

875
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,370
Same time every year.
Last weekend in August.

876
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,520
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta get back to babysitting.

877
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,890
Okay? I'm sure Diana
is waiting for you.

878
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,800
Ooh, bro, you should
have taken her to prom!

879
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,370
Seriously, given her age,
she could've chaperoned...

880
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:19,640
And been your date. Come on,
Andy, think about these things.

881
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,640
Conch.
Yeah?

882
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,740
Dude, you're my friend now.

883
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,910
Bye!

884
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:40,590
Send.

885
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,970
Punch... throw a kick, punch.

886
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,640
What is going...

887
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:50,790
What? Keep busy, guys,
just keep doing your thing, man.

888
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,660
Punch!

889
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,900
Oh, man.

890
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,610
She's 18... yes, 18.

891
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,310
Of course, you're not
a replacement.

892
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:14,020
I want you in my bed...

893
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,650
And this weekend will be
perfect, yeah.

894
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:20,390
Really?

895
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,970
Fuck.

896
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,700
Hey, Andy, looking good.

897
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:39,540
Hey! No, you look good,
you do!

898
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,880
Sit down!
No, no!

899
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:44,850
We told you, Andy, no more sex!

900
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,720
Gabby's husband called
asking if either of us...

901
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,390
Had lost a headband, which he
found in his bedroom.

902
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:54,760
Aw, that's where that one went.

903
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,830
Ow!

904
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,430
Okay, okay, easy, easy.

905
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:01,930
Look, look, let's form an
alliance together, let's work...

906
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:04,230
Ow!

907
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,530
Shh. Such sloppiness has no
place at the pro shop.

908
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:10,540
You're fired. And if anyone else
comes sniffing around here...

909
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,880
Looking for the man
who's been with their wives...

910
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,710
I will give them your name.

911
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:20,680
You flew too close to the sun.
Judas...

912
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,650
The pussy sun.

913
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:28,490
Salvatore...
No, Andy, not today!

914
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,670
I called Yaco about it, he swore
up and down it wasn't his.

915
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:41,500
It's a fact, Yaco isn't
into women.

916
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:43,470
He'd never touch your wife.

917
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,010
She's not into Italians...

918
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,880
So, Salavatore is out.

919
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,680
Did you ask her about Andy?

920
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,420
The high school kid? No. Why?

921
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,050
Because
when Victoria had too much...

922
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:59,620
To drink the other night,
she told me she slept with him.

923
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:05,430
I'll talk to the other guys,
see what they know about it.

924
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,870
Thanks.

925
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,450
What happened this morning,
guys?

926
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:25,780
Oh, nothing, lion and
I lost our jobs...

927
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:30,190
And Nora found out Erland is
sleeping with somebody else, so-

928
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,620
who knew that peyote would stay
in my system for three days?

929
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,620
God, I'm so stupid to cut
it that close, man.

930
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,590
Easy.

931
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,200
Guys, I'm done with drugs
and alcohol.

932
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,770
Okay, a warrior needs
his mind to be sharp.

933
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:46,570
At least the summer's almost
over, so...

934
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:50,810
Almost... we got
invited to summer dump.

935
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,480
Oh, my god!
Are you serious?

936
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,740
No way.
You're not...

937
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,910
You guys don't' want to...
You wanna go?

938
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:00,520
No, no, I mean, I'm exhausted,
you guys.

939
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,950
I vote that we just
cut our losses.

940
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,190
No! Our group has been
disintegrating this summer.

941
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:09,020
You two have been fighting each
other, you fried your brain...

942
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:13,060
And I've... I mean, not much has
happened for me, I realize that.

943
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,860
It probably should have by
now and I'm not too happy...

944
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,870
With my progression,
either, but...

945
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:19,130
This is the last time we're
gonna be together like this...

946
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,070
So, we're going to summer dump!

947
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:23,810
Okay.

948
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:30,250
Sorry. Some weird number.

949
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,050
Hello?

950
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,780
Danya
Andy? It's Danya.

951
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:39,760
Danya? Hi!

952
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,290
Danya I'm at the shuttle
bus stop in Hyannis.

953
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,290
I got a transfer from Boston.

954
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,830
You're at the shuttle bus stop?

955
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,770
Danya you got my
emails I was coming, right?

956
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:52,170
Oh, you didn't check your spam
folder, did you?

957
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,100
Your email? Of course,
I got your emails.

958
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,270
I'm gonna come get you,
I'm gonna come right now.

959
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,840
I'll be there in ten minutes.

960
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,110
Danya okay, Andy, I'm excited.

961
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:02,280
Me, too, me, too!
Okay, bye.

962
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:12,990
So, Danya is real and she is
here and I'm gonna go get her.

963
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:14,960
She just like showed up
out of the blue?

964
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,830
Indians are spontaneous
like that.

965
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:18,590
Gandhi was pretty patient.

966
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,390
Shut up.

967
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,180
You know I'm coming,
right, I have to see this.

968
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,970
Yeah, no, me, too, because I
can't go back to the lab, so.

969
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,900
I have work, so I'll be
staying here.

970
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,640
Good, yes, all of you
stay here...

971
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,810
Because you'll freak her out
if you come.

972
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,680
Oh, the Internet is awesome.
Okay.

973
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:48,190
Hi! This is...

974
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,760
Oh, that's nice.

975
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,630
Oh, my god.

976
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,100
Ah, she sees me.

977
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,270
Who are those people?

978
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:03,710
Oh, they came with the car.

979
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:10,150
You can't understand
anything about the world...

980
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:13,180
If you don't read Amartya sen's
"inequality re-examined."

981
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,120
Okay, but I read,
"development as freedom."

982
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,050
That's just an appetizer
for "inequality re-examined."

983
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,090
You'll have to feed me dinner.

984
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,730
Hey, have you ever read,
intuition...

985
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,260
Lion!
Sorry.

986
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,770
Okay...

987
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:38,940
Um, that should...
That should cover it.

988
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,910
Thank you.

989
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:50,790
Oh. Oh, yes.

990
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:54,920
Where did you get so much
cash to pay for this place?

991
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:57,430
I'm a sperm donor.

992
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,960
You must be exhausted.

993
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:04,870
I am so glad you're here.

994
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,140
Me, too.

995
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:17,350
Um, I have to go in there
all of a sudden...

996
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:22,690
But I'm gonna come back here
and then, we're just...

997
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,920
We're just never leaving.
Okay?

998
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,160
Okay.

999
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,960
All right, I'll be right back.

1000
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:51,880
Ow! Oh, god, fire.

1001
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:58,790
Hot, hot burn. Oh, my god!

1002
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,900
Something is wrong...
Something is wrong.

1003
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:24,850
Okay, so... I have to go now,
I have to go do something.

1004
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,420
You're leaving?

1005
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:28,920
It's nothing weird,
I just gotta go. Okay?

1006
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,450
I'll be back, I'll be back.

1007
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:36,230
Looks like you have
a yeast infection.

1008
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:38,530
A yeast infection?

1009
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:40,950
Men get yeast infections, too.

1010
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:43,360
Particularly if you're having a
lot of intercourse...

1011
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,930
And your immune system
is suppressed...

1012
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,100
Which would be the case...

1013
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,170
If you've been drinking
a lot of alcohol.

1014
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:50,810
Oh, my god.

1015
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:53,780
Lucky for you, it's curable with
a seven-day course of treatment.

1016
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,810
Any way we could speed that up?

1017
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:59,180
Some women have success putting
non-sweetened probiotic yogurt..

1018
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:02,150
Directly on the infection.

1019
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:06,390
Nope. No, no, no.
This can't be happening...

1020
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,060
I've been very careful.

1021
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,190
You've been having a lot
of sex, Andy.

1022
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,030
I know.

1023
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,860
Lay off sex for the next week
and you'll be fine.

1024
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:17,830
Lay off for the next week?
I can't.

1025
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,840
Yes, you can... okay?

1026
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:26,210
I gotta... can I pay for this
visit in cash?

1027
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:29,210
I don't want my parents
to see my insurance bill.

1028
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:31,210
It's a paper trail thing.

1029
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:34,320
You've had sex with 15 women
in the past two months...

1030
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,590
And you carry that kind of cash?

1031
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:38,990
Yes.

1032
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:40,390
Who are you?

1033
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:42,490
I don't even know anymore.

1034
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,900
And you're certain, she's not a
spy sent to kill you...

1035
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,000
Or some shit, bro?

1036
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:53,440
Going for a walk.

1037
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,470
Andy, Andy come in!

1038
01:03:56,470 --> 01:04:00,180
I can't hear you.

1039
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:04,250
What? You can absolutely
hear her, bro.

1040
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:07,020
Can't hear you, either.

1041
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:09,620
I'm just craving it right now.
I don't even...

1042
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,620
If you wanna know one thing
about me...

1043
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:14,520
It's that I love yogurt.

1044
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:20,330
Oh, yeah, you know, that's the
one.

1045
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,930
That's the one, I love this
stuff.

1046
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,570
This is gonna do the trick.

1047
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:44,190
No... fuck it.

1048
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,290
Ah, yes.

1049
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:58,600
Oh, my gosh, my stomach is
killing me from those clams.

1050
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:17,050
Hey, where have you been?
Been calling you.

1051
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:20,520
I've been looking for your
dick under this microscope.

1052
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,330
Um, what?

1053
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:30,570
I, uh, I heard you, heard you
talking to a girl on the phone..

1054
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:36,240
The other day about how I was 18
and you could use a replacement?

1055
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,570
I believe that's how you put it.

1056
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:41,010
Does that ring any bells?
So you just fuck off!

1057
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:13,310
This is it.

1058
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:17,250
Alcohol's in here, right?

1059
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:11,630
Identify yourselves.

1060
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:18,210
Uh... Andy, spice,
lion and Nora.

1061
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,740
Who's the hot girl?

1062
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:26,380
Nora. And... Danya!
Danya, also.

1063
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:30,150
Holy shit!
It's the smart kids!

1064
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:36,660
And have you come
for precious metals...

1065
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,730
For your space laboratories?

1066
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,460
We came to hang out!

1067
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:48,840
You heard them!
They wanna hang...

1068
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,840
And they have extra brain cells.

1069
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:54,340
Find them and destroy them!

1070
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:57,350
Whoo! Conch!

1071
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:01,780
Hell, yeah, this is gonna be...

1072
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:04,290
This is Danya, this is Danya.
No shit, how you doing?

1073
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,620
She's from India.
She came from India.

1074
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:08,390
You got hot!

1075
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:09,690
Thank you.

1076
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:12,330
You used to not be hot.

1077
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:13,800
I know.

1078
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,560
But now you're hot.

1079
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:18,370
Thank you, thank you.

1080
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:19,670
Hot.

1081
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:26,270
Woo!

1082
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:37,790
Goddamn, the palate on that is
wrong, it's so wrong. Let's see.

1083
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:44,860
This will fuck people up.

1084
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:47,200
What are you doing
with that punch?

1085
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,200
I'm improving it. Here.

1086
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:53,570
Try it.

1087
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,250
It's great.
Huh?

1088
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,630
Andy Evans!

1089
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,800
Recipient of the
role of distinction award.

1090
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:31,410
Being this is your first
summer dump...

1091
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:33,910
This is your initiation!

1092
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:36,340
Foam mattress wrestling!

1093
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,220
I'm not doing that.

1094
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,450
I'm not doing that, uh-uh.

1095
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:44,690
The role of distinction award
is given to the student...

1096
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:46,560
That best exemplifies the
principles...

1097
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,620
Of academic excellence...

1098
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:51,860
Loyalty and service
to the rest of the class.

1099
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:53,600
Ring girls, prepare him.

1100
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:57,300
To demonstrate those
principles...

1101
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:01,870
Your champion, Andy will be
wrestling... Plymouth rock!

1102
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,420
Do you think you're smart?

1103
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,590
What?

1104
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:17,950
I said, do... you...

1105
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,990
Think... you're... smart?

1106
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:23,890
Not anymore, I don't.
Oh, no!

1107
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,630
Let go!

1108
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,680
Come on, Andy! Come on!

1109
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:07,000
Okay, put him down!
Put him down!

1110
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:20,680
Get up... get the fuck
up... get the fuck up!

1111
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:59,050
Andy! Andy! Andy, Andy!

1112
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,600
Sorry, my hands are chapped.

1113
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,840
It's...
I do yardwork.

1114
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,770
It's just... keep going,
keep going.

1115
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:26,950
You're doing me next, you know.

1116
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:29,650
Release!

1117
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,520
Hey, lion.

1118
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,830
You okay?

1119
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,060
I came from India thinking it
was going to be this...

1120
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:49,600
Romantic trip, but... I don't
think Andy even likes me.

1121
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:53,710
I've been here a week and
he hasn't touched me.

1122
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:00,380
He hasn't touched you?

1123
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,680
But you're so beautiful.

1124
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:05,950
I mean you're like Krishna's
bride, Bhadra.

1125
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:18,100
You wanna go somewhere
and talk about this?

1126
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:22,670
Aren't we talking about it
somewhere now?

1127
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:29,910
I mean, yeah, but there are
other somewheres.

1128
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,570
What is it?

1129
01:13:56,610 --> 01:14:01,480
Thought I sensed something...
Fuck it.

1130
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,780
My body gets so hot.

1131
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:06,110
Tell the story.

1132
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,950
I have zero muscles,
I have zero muscles.

1133
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:11,020
Epic, man.
Dude, thank you, thank you.

1134
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:24,970
What?

1135
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:26,800
Hi, mom.

1136
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,000
Mrs. Evans
Andy, where are you?

1137
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,070
I'm watching a movie.

1138
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:32,040
Time to eat your own dick, Andy.

1139
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,040
I have to go.

1140
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:40,010
I love you. I know you know
that, but I need to express...

1141
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:43,050
It to you right now, verbally,
before I die.

1142
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:48,260
No guy has ever said that
to me verbally, before death.

1143
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:51,260
How could anybody not love you?

1144
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,630
Hey, Andy!

1145
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:55,260
All right, all right,
all right, I'll be honest.

1146
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,900
I have conflicting thoughts
about what has happened over...

1147
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,500
The last couple months
and I am sorry.

1148
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,840
And if I were you guys,
I would be just as mad.

1149
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,940
I fucked your wives,
for god's sake.

1150
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:08,580
But I got a yeast infection,
that sucks... it really sucks.

1151
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:11,780
Also, which one
of you is Gabby's husband?

1152
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:14,220
Gabby, now, Gabby does this
thing with her pinky, right?

1153
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:16,950
That hurts a lot, feels good,
but it hurts so much...

1154
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:19,290
And I've had to ice most
days of the summer.

1155
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:20,760
I just want to say that also.

1156
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:24,730
So, I am a victim here
as well... right?

1157
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,300
You're an idiot.

1158
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:43,580
This has nothing to do with you!

1159
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,050
Lion, you sure
you wanna do this?

1160
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:49,150
Fuck, yeah, bro, it's a totally
justifiable use of force.

1161
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,630
In a mob, you gotta use
the low Thai kicks.

1162
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,340
Lion!

1163
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:14,910
This is about my wife.

1164
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:18,210
I'm sorry, bro...
This is about my friend.

1165
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:31,230
Oh, my god!

1166
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,270
Fuck yeah!

1167
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:45,040
You're amazing!
I got you!

1168
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,140
I love you!
We did it!

1169
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,880
I actually love you!

1170
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,880
Holy shit! What the fuck!

1171
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,310
Oh, my god! Holy shit!
They're dead.

1172
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,950
I think they're all dead!

1173
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,250
Oh, my.

1174
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:05,290
Hey, guys. What'd I miss?

1175
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:09,030
Uh, I mean... I don't
even know where to start.

1176
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:12,100
It's been the longest
night, I think we gotta call it.

1177
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:15,740
Okay, I'm chillin'.

1178
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:17,240
Why do you seem so relaxed?

1179
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,270
You know what, I'm just feeling
refreshed, you know?

1180
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,310
Release?

1181
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:23,380
I've been released.

1182
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,710
Oh, man!

1183
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,120
Congratulations.
It's your moment.

1184
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,320
I'm so proud of you.

1185
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,150
Hey!

1186
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:33,760
Don't hide it, I already saw it,
why would you hide it?

1187
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,090
Where would you hide it?

1188
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:39,960
Wearing a sock as a shirt...
What the hell?

1189
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:47,070
Who did this?

1190
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:48,800
I did, sir.

1191
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:52,170
They deserve it?

1192
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:54,340
They were trying to kill Andy.

1193
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:55,440
Too tall.

1194
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:57,680
You remember me?

1195
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,910
Absolutely. Got my
mortgage situation fixed.

1196
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,450
That means you got your
arrest fixed.

1197
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:02,880
Really?

1198
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:05,000
Mm-hm. Come on with it.

1199
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,120
Hey, thank you, thank
you. I was drinking a beer...

1200
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,260
Looks like there's nothing
to see out here. Right?

1201
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:12,160
You kids want a ride?

1202
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,460
In a cop car?
That would be awesome.

1203
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,760
Let's go.

1204
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:17,370
Okay...
Absolutely.

1205
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:19,200
Can you put on the sirens?

1206
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,110
Yes! Legend!

1207
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:42,420
Reach out and get that.

1208
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:44,960
Yep... that's it.

1209
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:51,370
Thanks, guys.

1210
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:54,840
Hey, good luck at college, Andy.

1211
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,370
Appreciate it.

1212
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:02,180
Mom... breathe. I'm okay.

1213
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:09,750
The last few days...

1214
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:13,250
I've never experienced
anything like it.

1215
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:17,060
I had no idea those positions
had a use outside of karate.

1216
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:19,260
Visit me as soon as you can.

1217
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,780
Let's shoot for winter break.

1218
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,300
I'm planning on being a
millionaire near the end...

1219
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:26,000
Of the first semester anyway,
so, we'll go somewhere nice.

1220
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:34,380
They're actually pretty cute.

1221
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:44,320
Bye, Andy, good luck
at university!

1222
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:49,120
Thank you! Bye, Danya!
Good luck at UCLA.

1223
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:53,490
You're an ass! Do you know how
much it cost me...

1224
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:56,030
To fly her over here
and then you end up with her?

1225
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:59,070
As the Japanese proverb goes...

1226
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:02,440
"Nokorimono Ni wa fuku Ga aru."

1227
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,370
What does that mean?

1228
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:09,010
"Luck exists in the leftovers."

1229
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:37,910
What?
Yep.

1230
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:40,170
It's not fun.

1231
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:42,980
Hey, thanks for saving my life.

1232
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:45,310
Come on, bro, you would
have done the same for me.

1233
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:49,080
Love you.
Love you, man.

1234
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:55,320
Was a kick-ass summer, guys.

1235
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:58,890
Yeah, kinda sucks, though,
I'm gonna miss you guys a lot.

1236
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,360
I'm gonna miss you guys, too.

1237
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:06,070
And it does suck but...
We're gonna be okay.

1238
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:09,140
You better make people
call you spice at Stanford.

1239
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:12,140
I don't know, man, I think I'm
gonna kick it off with, Mike.

1240
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:14,530
Mike?

1241
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:16,910
See where it evolves from
there. What's wrong with that?

1242
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,060
Hey!

1243
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,500
See you, guys.
Bye.

1244
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:44,210
Hey, I miss you guys already!

1245
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:45,610
Love you!

1246
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,440
Ow!

1247
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:04,810
Next time, I'm gonna see you...

1248
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:06,990
You're gonna have a Dartmouth
meathead beer gut.

1249
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Next time I see you, you'll
be pregnant by a Kennedy.

1250
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,570
Cool, we'll just hang around
admiring each other's bellies.

1251
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:15,500
Love it.
Perfect.

1252
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:22,040
Don't make any new friends
at school, please.

1253
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:25,380
Okay... you, either.

1254
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:27,250
Deal.

1255
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:30,080
I love you, too.

1256
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:35,490
I just didn't say it at that
weird, evil steel mill.

1257
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:38,360
You know, it was a bad setting.

1258
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,290
Hey, Andy, heads up!

1259
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,230
Hey, Tinsley.
Hey.

1260
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:26,770
Nicely done. Automatic.

1261
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:29,300
Thanks. I'm Andy.

1262
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:33,470
Hey.
