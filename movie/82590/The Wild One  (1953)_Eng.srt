1
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,087
It begins here for me on this road.

2
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,923
How the whole mess happened,
I don't know.

3
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,677
But I know it couldn't happen again
in a million years.

4
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,471
Maybe I could have stopped it early.

5
00:00:55,764 --> 00:01:00,518
But once the trouble was on its way,
I was just going with it.

6
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,981
Mostly I remember the girl.

7
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:08,401
I can't explain it,
sad chick like that.

8
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,531
But something changed in me.
She got to me.

9
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,953
But that's later, anyway.
This is where it begins for me.

10
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,914
Right on this road.

11
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,107
Come on, get off the track!

12
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,945
What are you doing?
Get over there! Come on, all of you!

13
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,381
Now they're approaching the turn
for the last lap.

14
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,758
Let's see, Riley and some....

15
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:43,848
Hillman taking a tumble. And Jones
doing very well to avoid him too.

16
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:48,144
This is the final lap coming up
and still anybody's race.

17
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:56,235
That's Conners in the hay.
It's a bad break for Charlie Conners.

18
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:05,202
And they'll go into the last lap.
Last time around coming up.

19
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,455
They're all hot today.
It's anybody's race.

20
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,708
They're in that order now,
but anything can happen.

21
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,210
Maybe a record....

22
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:25,139
Come on, Al! Come on! Come on!
Thattaboy! Come on!

23
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,112
Hey, get off the track! Get off the track.

24
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,323
Please don't cross the track.

25
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:49,413
Please don't cross the track. Don't get
hurt. Blood makes everything slippery.

26
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,540
What's the matter
with you chowder heads?

27
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,918
You in such a big hurry to die?

28
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:58,631
Those words mean anything to you,
squirrels? Are you looking for trouble?

29
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:02,927
These outlaw outfits always want
to foul things up for everybody else.

30
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,680
Hey, what kind of outfits?
Say that again.

31
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,266
Outlaw outfits, like yours.

32
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,227
Okay, square, right now.

33
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:15,564
You want to drag Johnny here
100 yards for beers, or you chicken?

34
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:20,111
- The square's chicken.
- They're all chicken.

35
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,198
You want to see something?
You wanna see Johnny go?

36
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,159
He can really go.
He can really screw it on.

37
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,580
What do you get when you win
one of these scrambles? $5000?

38
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,708
Boy, I'd sure like to win me $5000.

39
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,084
Hey, you dummy, come here.

40
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,212
If you win, they give you
one of these beautiful gold statues.

41
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,757
- Solid gold.
- Pure solid gold. Dipped.

42
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,468
- What do you do with it?
- Take it home to your mother.

43
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,970
Yeah, then you throw it away.

44
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:50,266
Break it up, break it up. Put these
trophies back. All of you, stand back.

45
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,019
Hey, where can I get me
one of these jazzy suits?

46
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,188
I want to look like
a street cleaner too.

47
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,901
Hey, who are you? What are you
doing here? You a cop or something?

48
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,987
Come on.

49
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:08,117
- Don't push anybody.
- Okay, okay, break it up.

50
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,244
We got enough entertainment
around here.

51
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,872
I've seen enough of you guys
to last me forever.

52
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,001
Now, hit the road.
I mean right now. Get going.

53
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,629
We want to watch
the thrilling races, daddy.

54
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,799
One more cute remark
and you won't be riding any cycles.

55
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,135
I'll put the bunch of you away
for a month.

56
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,012
Now, get going.

57
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,157
Hey, fellas, come here.
Look what Johnny won.

58
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,035
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Second place?

59
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,079
So Johnny
only won second place, huh?

60
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,457
What do you mean?
First place was two feet high.

61
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,510
Hey, Johnny, look.

62
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,805
These squares are having a dance
in Carbonville tonight. We'll go, huh?

63
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,016
- No, man. That's nowhere.
- Come on. We can clobber it.

64
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,897
Come on, Johnny. Let's go someplace.

65
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,442
Let's get out of here. Every time
you look around, there's cops.

66
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,113
All right, let's get rolling.

67
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,492
This way.

68
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,027
- Where's that bunch from?
- I don't know, everywhere.

69
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,446
I don't even think
they know where they're going.

70
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,157
Termites. Nutty.

71
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,617
Ten guys like that give people
the idea everybody...

72
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,912
that drives a motorcycle is crazy.
What are they trying to prove?

73
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,748
Beats me. Looking for somebody
to push them around...

74
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,543
so they can get sore
and show how tough they are.

75
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,462
They usually find it someplace,
sooner or later.

76
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,350
Hey, Johnny, where are we going?

77
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,978
- Let's get gas.
- Yeah, give us some gas!

78
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,021
Hey, gas man.

79
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,066
Ben, business before pleasure.

80
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,782
Jimmy,
better put some more beer on ice.

81
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,078
What is this joint? What war do you
suppose this joint was left over from?

82
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:26,583
Hey, fellas, drag for beers.
Who wants to drag for beers?

83
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,047
Last guy in the door of that joint
buys beers.

84
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,845
Last guy in buys.

85
00:10:55,822 --> 00:11:00,868
- Hey, who is it? Who is it?
- Art, you all right? It's Art Kleiner.

86
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,286
Come on.

87
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,834
- Hey, help this man out!
- Hey, help this man out!

88
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,590
Help the man out! Help the man out!

89
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,469
Put me down! Put me down!

90
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,806
Help the man out! Help the man out!

91
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:31,398
- What is all this?
- We're just dragging for beers.

92
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,025
And this guy:

93
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,528
- He doesn't know how to drive.
- Yeah.

94
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,697
There's a boy hurt here.

95
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,077
It's his ankle. Looks pretty bad.

96
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:49,041
What's all that, Kathy?
What's all that? Somebody killed?

97
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,377
Hey, Crazy,
you can't sleep in the street.

98
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,296
Man, look at this cycle.
You really stacked up this thing.

99
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,216
I'll call Dr. Ziegler.
Get your pickup, we'll take him over.

100
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,510
Harry, you seen how it happened.

101
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,096
Those motorcycles
were coming straight at me.

102
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,433
I swung my wheel over as hard as I
could, but they... Take a look at that.

103
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,645
- What about this, Harry?
- It was an accident. I saw it.

104
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,730
Mark got excited, that's all.

105
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,442
- Aren't you gonna arrest anybody?
- Take it easy, Art. Take it easy.

106
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,945
I'm not excited.
I'm just telling you what happened.

107
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,822
I tried to miss him, then he hit me.

108
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,492
My car's a wreck and somebody has
to pay for the damages, and I mean it.

109
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,121
Okay. You the big cop in the town?

110
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,624
Next time, tell him to look where he's
going. He don't know how to drive.

111
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,670
I mean, he ought to turn one way
or the other. You know what I mean?

112
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,464
There was guys all over the street
trying to miss him.

113
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:41,218
- Now, just a minute...
- He's all right, but my boy's busted up.

114
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:45,055
- Look here, Harry...
- Forget it, Art. Forget it.

115
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,933
- Some cop, huh?
- See Johnny back him down?

116
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,686
Yeah. What a screwball town.

117
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,692
Art Kleiner's too old
to be driving an automobile.

118
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,944
Where was he going, anyway?

119
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:04,450
Always going someplace.
Crazy, excited.

120
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:10,706
Taking a lot of vitamin pills, drinking.
Over-stimulated.

121
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,669
Ought to arrest
the whole lot of them.

122
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,089
Call the militia.

123
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,482
- Do you want something?
- Yeah. I'd like a bottle of beer.

124
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,486
- The beer's just in the bar.
- Alrighty.

125
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,173
Why, thank you.

126
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,767
Look, Harry.
The fender's scraping in the tyre.

127
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,519
Wait a minute.

128
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,608
There you are. It won't scrape no more.
Good as the rest of them.

129
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,861
Oh, no. Harry, aren't you
gonna do something about this?

130
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,780
- Well, what do you expect me...?
- What do you want Harry to do?

131
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,034
Arrest all these boys? All 30 or 40
of them and whatever there is?

132
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,912
It's the principle. You let something
like this go by and anything goes.

133
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,249
- That's right. Make your complaint, Art.
- I sure will.

134
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,336
That's silly.
Your car is okay, you're okay.

135
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,755
And it's lucky, the way you drive.

136
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,566
- Say, you live here all the time?
- All my life.

137
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,324
We've been over to Carbonville,
at the meet.

138
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,535
Bunch of motorcycles came through
this way yesterday.

139
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:42,292
They didn't stop. Is that what they give
you in those races for killing yourself?

140
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,086
That's right.

141
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,922
You want it?

142
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,675
- No.
- Well, go on, take it. Go ahead.

143
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,551
- No.
- Go on.

144
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,721
You can't do that. You won it.

145
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:00,811
You have to get your name engraved
on it, whatever you do. It's important.

146
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,772
You don't give something like that away
just like that.

147
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,942
Not unless you knew a girl real well
and you liked her.

148
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,904
Hey, Johnny.

149
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,658
About this town,
they've got a doc here.

150
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:19,037
They'll rewire Crazy. What are we gonna
do? Sit around and scratch ourselves?

151
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,457
Are we gonna wait for Crazy,
or are we gonna get out of this dump?

152
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,378
We're gonna wait for Crazy.

153
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,805
Go.

154
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,724
Go, go.

155
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,492
Hey, you guys! Johnny says we're
gonna hang around and wait for Crazy.

156
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,952
They're gonna fix him up.

157
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,747
- What do we do here?
- Give me a swig of this, will you?

158
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:06,543
Don't fight, boys. Plenty more where
this came from. It's ice-cold too.

159
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,296
- Hey, doc.
- Yeah.

160
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,757
Hey, where do we eat?

161
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,135
Right there. Bleeker's Cafe.
We'll take good care of you.

162
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,220
- You got some steaks?
- Kansas City steaks?

163
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,639
Well, we serve good meat.

164
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,603
- Where's the motel?
- The hotel is right over there.

165
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,564
Hey, they've got a hotel here.

166
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:33,111
- Hey, come on, lead me to that brew.
- Hey, check the hot rod.

167
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,034
Hey, the fire went out!

168
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:15,403
How are you doing, blondie?
Hey, baby. Where you going?

169
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,465
Well, look who's here.

170
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,848
- What'll you have, girls?
- Yeah, what will it be, girls?

171
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,642
- The usual.
- The usual. All right, just one minute.

172
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,563
- And hit us with a couple of beers.
- Jimmy, put a couple more cases on ice.

173
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,314
Kathy said you wanted
some glasses.

174
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,817
That was an hour ago.
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

175
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:57,821
- Take over here, will you, Jimmy?
- Come on, Jimmy!

176
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,448
I'm dying of thirst.
I'm dying of thirst.

177
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,033
Please stop mumbling.

178
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,703
Jimmy, what do you hicks do
around here for kicks?

179
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,079
What time is it?

180
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,165
Hey, what do you do around here?
Anything ever happen?

181
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,626
- Oh, yes.
- Like what?

182
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:15,422
- Roses grow.
- Oh, roses grow.

183
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,382
- People get married.
- Married.

184
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,926
Crazy as any place else.

185
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,138
Bugs get on them,
cause trouble sometimes...

186
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,682
- ...that is, if you don't spray good.
- Yeah.

187
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,518
- There's no bugs on you, Jim?
- I mind my own business.

188
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,020
That's the way to be, Jim.

189
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:36,359
I listen to the radio. Music, that is.
News is no good, excites people.

190
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,654
- Hey, Jim, what about TV? You like TV?
- What?

191
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,115
New thing, Jim. Television.

192
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,618
- Oh, pictures.
- Yeah.

193
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:49,497
No, no pictures.
Everything these days is pictures.

194
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,666
Pictures and a lot of noise.

195
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,962
Nobody even knows how to talk,
just grunt at each other.

196
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,596
- Where you been?
- Working.

197
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:08,183
Listen, what's happening later?
What are you gonna do later?

198
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,392
I work.

199
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,853
- You've got to goof off, don't you?
- What?

200
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,273
- You're not gonna work forever, are you?
- It feels like it sometimes.

201
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,028
I'm talking about tonight,
after you finish up?

202
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,073
I have to stay here
as long as we're busy.

203
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,743
It sounds like we'll be busy
until you leave here.

204
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,206
Where are you going
when you leave here?

205
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,377
Don't you know?

206
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,587
Man, we're just gonna go.

207
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,507
Just trying to make conversation.
It means nothing to me.

208
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:45,220
On the weekends
we go out and have a ball.

209
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,806
What do you do? I mean,
do you just ride around...

210
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,016
or do you go
on some sort of a picnic?

211
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,731
A picnic? Man, you are too square.
I'll have to straighten you out.

212
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:03,905
Listen, you don't go any one special
place. That's cornball style. You just go.

213
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:09,244
A bunch gets together after all week,
it builds up. The idea is to have a ball.

214
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,788
If you're gonna stay cool,
you've got to wail.

215
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,707
You've got to put something down.

216
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,459
You got to make some jive.
Know what I'm talking about?

217
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:20,213
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Well, that's all I'm saying.

218
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,675
My father was going to take me
on a fishing trip to Canada once.

219
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,176
Yeah?

220
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,930
- We didn't go.
- Crazy.

221
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,899
Solid.

222
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,695
Hey, pops, give me one
of those crazy beers, will you, man?

223
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,115
- Man, that was real cool.
- Thanks, daddy-o.

224
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:51,411
That's fine old playing.
We've got to get this beer.

225
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,705
Thank you, pops.

226
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:58,918
- Bop me, dad.
- I bopped you, dad. Pops, thumb me.

227
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,254
Come on. That's it. Thumb me.

228
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,340
- Now, give me some skin. Ooze it out.
- Ooze it out.

229
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,427
- Just nice and... Ooze it out.
- Thattaboy, ooze it.

230
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:11,473
- Now, elbow us. Just elbow us.
- Pops, do you pick up on this jive?

231
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,434
- What?
- Pick up on this jive? This crazy music.

232
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,687
- Did you dig the rebop?
- What?

233
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:21,858
- The rebop, dad. The rebop.
- He's a square. Don't you get this?

234
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:25,945
You take the brew on the side
and the time, and you take this bottle....

235
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,282
Drink and....

236
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:44,881
Go, go, go.

237
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,264
- How about a dance? Come on.
- How about you? You want to struggle?

238
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,893
- Let's try.
- Thattagirl. You're a daring one.

239
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,241
Hey, can I help you?

240
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:37,225
Hey, these are keen!
Johnny, get a load of this.

241
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,018
- They're real bells.
- Aren't they cute?

242
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,186
Crazy.

243
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,523
Somebody tell me what that means.
"BRMC." What does it mean?

244
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:47,068
- Black Rebels Motorcycle Club.
- Isn't that cute?

245
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:51,739
- Johnny, what are you rebelling against?
- What have you got?

246
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:58,329
Kathy, aren't they wonderful?
Did you hear what I said?

247
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,415
I said, "What does 'BRMC' mean?"

248
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,959
He said,
"Black Rebels Motorcycle Club."

249
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,545
I asked, "What are you
rebelling against, Johnny?"

250
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:09,090
And he said, "What have you got?"
"What have you got?"

251
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,350
What's the matter?
Don't you like to dance?

252
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,352
Well, I don't dance very well.

253
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,856
The squares are having a dance
in Carbonville. You want to make it?

254
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,276
Aren't you Miss...?
Taken about that.

255
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:34,949
- Oh, my.
- Coffee, please.

256
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,913
Two coffees, please.

257
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,709
- You want to go?
- I can't.

258
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:48,963
- How come?
- Well, I can't. Besides, it's silly.

259
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:54,510
- You just came from Carbonville.
- So what? We'll just go back over there.

260
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,431
Hey.

261
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:02,018
Hey, you gentlemen
ordered some coffee.

262
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,855
I think you ordered some coffee.
The young lady's waiting for you.

263
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,024
That's a good boy.

264
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,986
What's with him?

265
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,459
You won yourself something, did you?
Well, that's a nice souvenir to have.

266
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:32,423
Look, Johnny, out there
I think you got me a little wrong.

267
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,219
I've got a job to do,
but I'm not hard to get along with.

268
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,222
It's generally just a misunderstanding...

269
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,643
but looks like anything that might
develop into real trouble....

270
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,232
It can be decided if folks
just sit down and talk it over.

271
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,199
Dad.

272
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:05,540
Would you like me
to fix you a steak sandwich or...?

273
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,710
No.

274
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,261
Why did you do that for?
Why are you trying to be so rude?

275
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,890
I don't like cops.

276
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,353
Let's get out of here.

277
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:28,646
Come on.

278
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:40,742
- Did you get lined up with that chick?
- No, man. Her old man is that itchy cop.

279
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,953
- Let's get out of this town.
- I'd like to get me a cop's daughter.

280
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,955
Some deal, eh, Dinky?

281
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,933
One beer,
and a sidecar for my friend.

282
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,311
He got his clutch overhauled.

283
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,063
- Crazy, how's the foot?
- I got it.

284
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,902
Dig that cat, daddy-o.

285
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,118
What are you doing tonight?

286
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:45,848
Hey, the Rebels are here!
Hey, the Rebels! Come on!

287
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,017
It looks like Johnny's here.

288
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:52,480
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Johnny, this joint's wide open.

289
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:55,316
- What's the matter? This is a bar.
- Let's get out of here.

290
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:58,361
No, it's a drag. Come on.

291
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:23,886
Hi, sweetheart. What are you doing
in this miserable gully, Johnny, my love?

292
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:28,307
I love you, Johnny.

293
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,351
I've been looking for you
in every ditch...

294
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,520
from Fresno to here,
hoping you was dead.

295
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,731
Chino's giving him the needle,
and your boyfriend don't go for that.

296
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,489
You've been having yourself a time,
huh, Johnny?

297
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:49,996
You do look pale.
Have you been taking care of yourself?

298
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,082
You been staying out
too late at night?

299
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,751
That's mine, Chino. Take it off.

300
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,971
Don't do that.

301
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,439
That's better, Johnny.

302
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,820
I missed you. Ever since
the club split up, I missed you.

303
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:26,157
- We all missed you. Did you miss him?
- Yeah.

304
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,701
The Beetles missed you.
All the Beetles missed you.

305
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,078
Come on, Johnny, let's go inside,
have a beer...

306
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,539
and I'll beat
the living Christmas out of you.

307
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,125
Johnny, for old times' sake.

308
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,465
Don't take that away from Chino.
It's so beautiful.

309
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:46,886
Chino needs it. It makes Chino
feel like a big, strong man.

310
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:51,599
Yeah, Chino wants to be
a big racetrack hero. All these girls.

311
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:57,647
I didn't win it. I just gleebed it.

312
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:01,150
But I gleebed it off a guy
that didn't win it either.

313
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,236
Look, Johnny, you want one?

314
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,155
How about you go gleeb one
someplace for yourself, huh?

315
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,957
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

316
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,918
This is the main event.

317
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:22,004
Ladies and gentlemen....

318
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,257
This lovely young lady over here...

319
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:28,511
shall hold this beautiful object
signifying absolutely nothing.

320
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,973
Watch closely.
See how the timid maiden of the hill...

321
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,225
clutches the gold to her breast.

322
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:38,938
And see how she fights back a tear while
her hero bleeds to death in the street.

323
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,276
Come on, get up, you big hero.

324
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,167
- What are they fighting about?
- I don't know.

325
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,420
Don't know themselves, probably.

326
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,676
Stop this.
I've seen hoodlums like this before.

327
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,513
If you don't get tough with them the
minute they get out of line, you're sunk.

328
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:26,402
You are the cop. If you can't boot these
jerks out, we'll have to bust a few heads.

329
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,697
- That won't help matters.
- Take it easy, Charlie.

330
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:33,284
Nothing but talk. Talk. I'll see
if everything is all right at home.

331
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:59,352
Chino, come on, get up, boy.
Don't let him make a fool out of you.

332
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,188
Go get him, Chino.
Come on, go get him! Go get him, Chino!

333
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,571
Johnny, I love you.

334
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:20,414
Johnny, how about you and me,
we'll go and have a...

335
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:29,465
Shut up! Let's you and me have a beer,
Johnny. Shut up, I said!

336
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,015
- Get out of the way. I want out.
- What's the big idea?

337
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,518
Shut up!

338
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,229
- You know how to drive?
- Come on, I want out of here.

339
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:47,900
- You're awful noisy, ain't you?
- Now, look, you get away from me.

340
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,986
- What did he do?
- Tried to run Meatball over.

341
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,614
Come on, up and over!

342
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:57,201
Heave, ho! Heave, ho!

343
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,580
Break it up. Break it up. Break it up.

344
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,960
- Chief, he tried to run Meatball over.
- Nobody ran anybody over.

345
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,003
He ran his motorcycle
in front of my car.

346
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,089
Yeah? And then I suppose
his cycle crawled...

347
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,341
under your front wheel
all by its lone self?

348
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:16,011
- I want this man arrested.
- He wants me arrested? You hear that?

349
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,683
- He hit me.
- Well, hit me back, you coward. Go on.

350
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:24,478
All right, quiet! I'm gonna take
you both down and lock you up.

351
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:25,771
- Both of us?
- Yes.

352
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:31,026
So we can all talk
without everybody yelling. Quiet!

353
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:36,031
Whether I'll hold anybody or not depends
on just how badly this boy here is hurt.

354
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,200
See, I'm with the chief.

355
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,412
- Are you hurt, man?
- He don't feel a thing.

356
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,539
- Harry.
- What?

357
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:49,170
- Let me talk to you.
- All right, break it up. Move along.

358
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,631
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Of course I know what I'm doing.

359
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:58,429
- Let's get these guys out of town.
- Sure. We have to make a living here.

360
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,974
If you arrest Charlie Thomas,
he'll never forgive you.

361
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,851
Well, okay.

362
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,981
- Okay, come on. Come on.
- What about him?

363
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,609
Frogface, dear friend,
we are being parted.

364
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,944
Our love is being nipped in the bud.

365
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:18,824
Wait a second. What did this boy do
that frogface didn't do?

366
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,993
Johnny,
I want to talk to you a minute.

367
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,622
I've given you a couple of chances.
I don't know what you're after...

368
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,583
- Chief, let me tell you about Johnny.
- Shut up.

369
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,587
I'm in a spot here.
You can do me a favour.

370
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,424
You take your boys and go on,
and the other bunch too.

371
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:39,136
- Can I go too, chief?
- Yeah, and he goes too.

372
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,681
I made a deal with a cop once.

373
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,642
Let me tell you about Johnny,
daddy-o.

374
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,354
He's okay, but you don't get on his back.
He don't like nobody on his back.

375
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:52,024
We had the same club once, and
the Beetles got on his back all the time.

376
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,275
He didn't like that.

377
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:58,072
- Then you don't wanna do what I say?
- Save me, Johnny. I'm going to the can.

378
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Yes or no?

379
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:04,620
- I don't make no deal with no cop.
- Okay. Come on.

380
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:10,000
Hey, Johnny, write my mother
a letter and tell her I'm in the can!

381
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,128
Johnny, you gonna let that phoney cop
get away with this.

382
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,214
Hey, write my mother a letter...

383
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:19,468
tell her to send me a case of beer.
Oh, the shame of it all!

384
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,929
Oh, the shame of it all!

385
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,890
- Let's give this joint the needle.
- What time is it?

386
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,934
Where's that chick
that's got my gold?

387
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,603
She was standing right over there.

388
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,691
Hi, Johnny.

389
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:36,944
Thank you.

390
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,405
Hey, Johnny.

391
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,785
Don't you remember? Britches.

392
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:48,497
You remember. The last weekend
we went out scrambling.

393
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,292
- Before the club split up.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

394
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:56,755
- How have you been?
- I'm still swinging.

395
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:01,844
I didn't know what happened to you.
It's been a year I didn't see you.

396
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:07,850
- I thought about you.
- I'll see you later, okay?

397
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,196
Where's my gold?
I'm gonna blow this joint.

398
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:25,326
Fine. Go someplace else
and cause trouble.

399
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,079
Listen, he put Chino in the can. Why
didn't he put that frogface in the can?

400
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:33,500
He was afraid of making a mistake.
He's afraid of losing his job.

401
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,171
He's the town joke and I'm stuck
with him.

402
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:41,467
He hasn't got any business being a cop.
No more than you have with that.

403
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:44,678
He's a fake, like you.

404
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:51,560
Well, you've impressed everybody now,
big motorcycle racer.

405
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,105
Take that back so they can give it
to somebody who really won it.

406
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,565
Say what?

407
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,409
Who are you, some girl
who makes sandwiches or something?

408
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,287
Your father wears a hat
says he's a big, important man.

409
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,373
You start telling me what to do?

410
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,125
Nobody tells me what to do.

411
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:19,588
You keep needling me, if I want to,
I'm gonna take this joint apart.

412
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,674
You're not gonna know what hits you.

413
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,975
- Hey, beer.
- Johnny, what's the pitch? We leaving?

414
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,812
Not just yet.

415
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:55,828
Hey, Johnny.

416
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,081
- Johnny, come on, let's go spring Chino.
- Yeah, one phoney cop.

417
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:02,167
- Let's get him out of there.
- Hey, we've got this town on the ropes.

418
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,878
- Come on.
- All right, let's go.

419
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:50,424
Hello, Dorothy,
get me the sheriff's office in Elsburgh.

420
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:54,178
I'll see if I can get through
for you, Harry.

421
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:01,310
Hey, look what's in here.
Hello, baby.

422
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:05,189
- How does this work?
- Can I get my mother on this?

423
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,566
- This is Dorothy. Help!
- Hello?

424
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,860
- Hello, baby.
- How does this work?

425
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:15,449
Goodbye, Dorothy.
Go on, take the day off, Dorothy.

426
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,009
What is this?

427
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,890
What are you doing here? Get off
my lawn! Come on, get out of here!

428
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,809
Listen, you hooligans,
you've caused enough trouble.

429
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:46,563
- Hey, Chino!
- Hey, Chino!

430
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,982
- Hey, Chino!
- Get up, Chino.

431
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,026
Come on, Chino!

432
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:57,741
- Let's open it up.
- Hey, you guys. Look, I've got the key!

433
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,911
- Where'd you get the keys?
- I see it.

434
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,789
- I wore gloves. No fingerprints.
- Good.

435
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,707
Hurry up. Hurry up.

436
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,501
Hey, Chino, wake up.

437
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:10,545
In you go. Get in there.

438
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,508
Hey, Chino.
Chino, come on, get up.

439
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:17,094
- There you go.
- Come on, Chino.

440
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,138
Leave him alone. Let him sleep it off.

441
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,934
Hey, you want room service?
We'll leave a call for you.

442
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,982
Sleep well, Chino.

443
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,360
Chino will be surprised
when he wakes up.

444
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,488
Johnny, what happened to that cop?
Let's go give him a bad time.

445
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,407
Yeah, I'll take the cop's daughter.

446
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:42,536
- Okay, okay, I was smiling.
- Maybe she's got a sister for me.

447
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,956
Johnny, where are you going?

448
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,814
Hello. Hello, hello.

449
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,566
Hello.

450
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:16,153
- What's the matter? Don't they answer?
- Did you get them?

451
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:19,489
The phone is dead.
Better send somebody for the militia.

452
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:24,661
That's silly. Let me try.
Hello, operator. Operator.

453
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,831
Dorothy.
I guess you're right.

454
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,046
Kathy, go see if you can find your dad.
Tell him I need him right away.

455
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,882
You better go home and stay there.

456
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,389
Come on!

457
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,392
Come on, Bleeker!

458
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,274
Now, wait a minute!

459
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:27,808
- Hi, Johnny. Where have you been?
- What do you want?

460
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:31,686
Talk to me, Johnny.
Sing me a song.

461
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:35,649
- Buy me a beer.
- You've got a beer.

462
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:38,318
I want to know how you've been, Johnny.

463
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:43,281
I'm singing tonight, Johnny.
I'm really singing.

464
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,243
I'm on the Christmas tree.

465
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:53,625
- You got a date?
- Yeah, I got a date.

466
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,710
Johnny.

467
00:45:55,878 --> 00:46:00,966
Remember the night...? The first time
I went out scrambling with the Rebels.

468
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:02,676
Remember?

469
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:08,640
That was the first time I ever saw you.
I haven't seen you since.

470
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:13,311
We really got ourselves
hung on the Christmas tree, didn't we?

471
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:19,276
Boy, was I green. Was I really green.

472
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:25,782
I thought I was really living it up. I had
me a guy and we were really gonna go.

473
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,535
But we had a lot of yaks anyway,
didn't we, Johnny?

474
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:34,291
Well, say it.
Can't you say something?

475
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,880
Please, Johnny.
I won't get on your back.

476
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,424
I wouldn't do that.

477
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:47,971
But we had a lot of yaks anyway,
didn't we?

478
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,184
What do you want me to do,
send you some flowers?

479
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,981
Where's that girl?
Where's that Kathy?

480
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:01,693
The bar's closed, counter's closed,
everything is closed.

481
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:07,032
- Hey, Johnny, can't you stop this?
- Where's that Kathy? I'm looking for her.

482
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,286
- I don't know. If you can stop this...
- I don't stop nothing, man.

483
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:15,123
- They're wrecking my place.
- You're doing all right, man.

484
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,542
Oh, no. Please.

485
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:27,135
- You all right?
- Let's get to work on these boys.

486
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,887
- Anybody bring a gun for me?
- Here.

487
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:32,516
- Wait a minute.
- Wait till somebody gets killed?

488
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:37,020
I don't go all the way with Charlie either.
But we've got to protect ourselves.

489
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,731
But two wrongs
never made anything right.

490
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:43,777
- When you start using guns....
- I'm gonna use it, one end or the other.

491
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,036
Anybody who wants to
stay and talk some more...

492
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,574
can have an ice cream social with Bill.
Anybody don't, can come with me.

493
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,786
If you find him, bring him to the back
of the store. We'll meet there.

494
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:57,332
We'll do what we can. Let's get hold
of this Johnny before the others do.

495
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,945
Hey, Crazy, man, go, go, go!

496
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,116
That Mildred gives
the craziest permanents.

497
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:34,744
- Marina, honey, let's dance.
- I've been tapped.

498
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,478
Hey, baby!

499
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,439
Go, go, go!

500
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,988
Come on, Leroy.
Come on, Johnny, go!

501
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:17,162
Hey, guys, look. New talent.
Hey, fellas.

502
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,876
- Well....
- That's a good one.

503
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:24,085
Let's get her!

504
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,367
Please don't do this.
Please don't. It's too expensive. Please.

505
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,787
Mildred, honey, where you been?
Let's dance, sweetie.

506
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:09,005
- Hey! The chick!
- Johnny's girl! Let's get her!

507
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,651
Get on.

508
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,923
Get up.

509
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:40,401
I'm sorry, I can't fight back.

510
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:46,574
I'm too tired. It would be better,
wouldn't it? Then you could hit me.

511
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,829
You think you're too good for me.
Nobody is too good for me.

512
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,040
Anybody who thinks
they're too good for me...

513
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,250
I make sure
I knock them over sometime.

514
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,753
I can slap you around to show you
how good you are...

515
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:02,090
and tomorrow I'm someplace else
and I don't even know you or nothing.

516
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,257
Do you want to?

517
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:08,388
I wouldn't waste my time on a square like
you. What I wanna knock myself out for?

518
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,140
- I'll take you back and dump you. Come.
- Johnny.

519
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,309
Quit that.

520
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:17,563
It's crazy, isn't it?
You're afraid of me.

521
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:22,110
I don't know why,
but I'm not afraid of you now.

522
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:23,945
You're afraid of me.

523
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:31,202
I'm afraid of you? Are you cracked?
Come on, get on.

524
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:41,129
I wanted to touch you.
I wanted to try, anyway.

525
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,882
Try what?

526
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,593
I don't know.

527
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:54,475
I wanted to make it the way
I always thought it would be sometime...

528
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,394
with somebody.

529
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,189
The way I always thought it might be.

530
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:08,740
You're still fighting, aren't you?
You're always fighting.

531
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,785
Why do you hate everybody?

532
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:24,881
I've never ridden on a motorcycle
before. It's fast. It scared me.

533
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:32,472
But I forgot everything.
It felt good. Is that what you do?

534
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:39,395
I'm gonna leave.
That's what you want me to do, isn't it?

535
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:46,402
You know what I used to think about?

536
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:50,239
I used to think about it a lot
after my mother died.

537
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:58,790
That somebody would come here
and stop at Uncle Frank's place...

538
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:02,710
and buy a cup of coffee or something...

539
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:06,881
and he'd like me right away
and he'd take me with him.

540
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:19,852
Johnny, you were going to give me that
statue. Will you give it to me now?

541
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:22,897
Why?

542
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,275
I don't know.

543
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:31,322
I just wondered if you still wanted
to give it to me, that's all.

544
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,574
It's crazy.

545
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:45,878
Where did you want this guy
to take you?

546
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,422
This guy that had a cup of coffee.

547
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:53,928
I don't know.
Wherever he was going, I guess.

548
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,935
I'm shaky.

549
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:06,732
I wish I was going someplace.

550
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:14,615
I wish you were going someplace.
We could go together.

551
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,125
Johnny, Johnny.

552
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:25,793
Hey.

553
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:28,212
Hey. Quit it.

554
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,716
What's the matter, Kathy?
I was only trying to...

555
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,634
- Chino, how did you get out of the can?
- Johnny, I love you.

556
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:01,138
Let's you and me have a beer, and I'll
beat the living Christmas out of you.

557
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,225
Come on, get everybody together.

558
01:00:04,393 --> 01:00:07,728
- We're gonna get out of here.
- Storm the Bastille!

559
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:28,749
There he comes!
That's him!

560
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,047
That's him. He's the one who....

561
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:33,606
Dad, they've got Johnny.
They're taking him....

562
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:37,693
You've just been sitting here?
Aren't you gonna do anything?

563
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,653
There isn't anything to do, Kathy.

564
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:43,282
We have to help him. They took him
in a car, Mr. Thomas and some men.

565
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:44,700
He wasn't doing anything.

566
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:48,287
He was trying to stop it.
He was going to leave.

567
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,833
- How are things at Frank's?
- Fight started. I don't know.

568
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:54,126
I came to look for you.

569
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:58,089
- Uncle Frank is very upset.
- Well, he got what he wanted.

570
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:03,719
- Business before pleasure.
- Listen, they've gone crazy. Everybody.

571
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:07,556
They've got Johnny. You've gotta
help him. They're going to beat him up.

572
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,142
I tried to talk to him.

573
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:16,482
- Don't you even care?
- What can I do?

574
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:20,528
Nothing, I guess.

575
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:26,242
But if you don't do something,
you're worse than any of them.

576
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:31,705
They brought it on themselves. I
saw it coming, but what could I do?

577
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:36,544
Charlie Thomas is a bully.
He was a bully in the third grade.

578
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,131
What am I supposed to do,
shoot somebody?

579
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:53,727
- Charlie, let me talk to the boy. - Bill,
stay out of this. Get out of our way.

580
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:58,482
- My old man used to hit harder than that.
- Shut up.

581
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,529
Hold on, there.

582
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:09,410
Get away from that boy. Get back.

583
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:12,621
This has got nothing to do with you.
We've got a little job to do.

584
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,749
- This is my job.
- You won't have it long.

585
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,961
We're doing something that should've
been taken care of before this:

586
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:22,673
Pounding a little respect for law
and authority into this guy's thick skull.

587
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,175
That's not the way to do it.

588
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,969
You got a better way?
You've had a lot of time to try it.

589
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:32,475
Harry, look, you're too soft-hearted.
This is no time for kindness.

590
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,603
- It's as good a time as any.
- We're doing this our way.

591
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:39,315
We're gonna make good and sure he
doesn't try anything like this soon again.

592
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:43,444
I don't know what he's tried or hasn't
tried. This boy's in my custody.

593
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:46,113
If he's done anything to deserve
punishment, he'll get it...

594
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,032
but in the right way, not from you.

595
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,244
Now, now, Harry. Take it easy.
After all, we're all old friends.

596
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:57,249
- Let's be calm and talk it over. Come on.
- Yeah, let's talk this over, Harry.

597
01:03:58,126 --> 01:03:59,335
Hey!

598
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,245
There he comes. That's him!

599
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,582
What's all that? What's all the noise?
What's going on?

600
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:02,601
- Get him up.
- We'll really fix him for this.

601
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,270
- I'm gonna break your neck.
- Finally killed a man, huh?

602
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,481
Okay, come on. Leave him alone.

603
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,315
What's the idea?

604
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,484
Let's go.

605
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,282
Harry, how did all this
get started anyway?

606
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:01,702
We had this man, we had this whole
thing stopped when he stuck his nose it.

607
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:06,331
- There's a little more to it than that.
- All right. We'll find out what happened.

608
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:10,127
Round up everybody on a motorcycle.
Pick up all the witnesses you can find.

609
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:12,755
The old man is dead.
A dishwasher down the street.

610
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,174
That makes it a manslaughter charge,
doesn't it?

611
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:19,344
We'll see. We'll see. Let's pick up
everything and sort it out inside.

612
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:11,563
Twenty years is too good for him.

613
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:14,942
I spotted him for the ringleader
the first five minutes.

614
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:19,363
I knew somebody was gonna get killed.
I couldn't get anybody to listen to me.

615
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:22,866
You killed Jimmy with a lot of talk, as
sure as he killed him with a motorcycle.

616
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,117
Wait a minute.

617
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:29,081
All right, okay, okay. That's enough.
Now, stop it. That's all.

618
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:48,058
Well, son,
you've got yourself something here.

619
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:50,811
Real important trouble.

620
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,357
It just shows you what a boy can do
if he'll work at it.

621
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:59,152
Well?

622
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,531
Haven't you anything to say?

623
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:10,497
I didn't kill nobody. Those guys were
after me and I just took off. That's all.

624
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:15,836
Maybe something hit my cycle.
I don't know what happened.

625
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:19,673
Then I went out, and that's...
That's all.

626
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,218
Yeah.

627
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:25,929
Well....

628
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,228
Let's go.

629
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:41,486
I located my daughter. She went home.
Do you want to talk to her?

630
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:44,072
- No. Bring her in later.
- You'd better talk to her now.

631
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,449
You do? Well, I don't.

632
01:10:45,617 --> 01:10:46,950
I've been up half the night.

633
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:50,203
I've got a long drive home
before I can get this joker booked.

634
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:53,123
- But she was with the boy.
- He knows that. Art Kleiner is...

635
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:55,208
Shut up, Frank.

636
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,423
All right. Come in, sit down.

637
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,967
That'll be all.

638
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:09,765
- Kathy's my niece. I have a right to stay.
- All right, but keep quiet.

639
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:16,730
- Well?
- It's crazy.

640
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,398
Yeah, I know.

641
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:22,527
I've got one fact. A man's dead,
and our boy here is stuck with it.

642
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:26,323
- I don't think it was his fault.
- Do you know one way or the other?

643
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:28,992
No.

644
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,708
You haven't fallen for this fellow,
have you?

645
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:45,884
No. No, I couldn't.

646
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:51,223
Let's go.

647
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:02,943
They beat him up.
I saw them. He wasn't doing anything.

648
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:04,611
I know he was leaving.

649
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:08,407
- He just wanted to go when...
- Yes, I know.

650
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,660
Sheriff, listen.

651
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:16,623
- Sheriff, wait, please.
- She's upset. She didn't mean that.

652
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,959
But regardless
of what happened to old Jimmy...

653
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:20,877
that boy deserves everything
he gets.

654
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:26,299
- Art here saw her fighting him off.
- No, Uncle Frank is wrong. He helped me.

655
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:27,843
They were after me and...

656
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:30,595
She was crying,
trying to get away from him.

657
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:35,058
I wasn't trying to get away from him.
I was just trying to get away.

658
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:45,652
Maybe we better tell him, Frank.

659
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:47,738
Tell me what?

660
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,741
- Why, the...
- Art and I were coming up the street.

661
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,076
Now, we didn't see who threw it...

662
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:58,373
but a tyre iron either hit the boy
or the motorcycle, and it went wild.

663
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:03,211
- Who threw what?
- A tyre iron. You know, it's a....

664
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,922
The thing to take the tyre off the rim.

665
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,675
Yeah. Somebody threw it
and it landed at our feet.

666
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,846
Why didn't you say so before?

667
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:27,402
Sit down.

668
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,825
John Strabler.

669
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,914
You got any friends, Johnny?

670
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,461
You picked up a few around here
last night, strange as it seems.

671
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,296
A couple anyway.

672
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,800
They got you off the hook
for a while.

673
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:55,055
I don't get you.

674
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:59,017
I don't get your act at all.
And I don't think you do, either.

675
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:04,439
I don't think you know what you're
trying to do, or how to do it.

676
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:10,070
I think you're stupid.
Real stupid and real lucky.

677
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:14,241
Last night you scraped by,
just barely.

678
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:17,869
But a man's dead on account of
something you let get started...

679
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:20,413
even though you didn't start it.

680
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:31,299
I don't know if there is any good in you.
I don't know if there's anything in you...

681
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:34,094
but I'm gonna take a big,
fat chance...

682
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,596
and let you go.

683
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:42,227
There'll be a hearing on this tyre-iron
business. You'll get a summons.

684
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,354
And you'd better show up.

685
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,566
Put him on the road.

686
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:56,741
- Is that yours?
- Yeah.

687
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,577
Go ahead.

688
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:02,789
Don't you want to say anything
to these people?

689
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:09,296
What's the matter?
You been hit over the head so often...

690
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:12,632
you don't know when you're getting
a break? At least say thank you.

691
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:19,014
It's all right.
He doesn't know how.

692
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:35,280
Okay, hotshots, the fun is over.

693
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:39,784
Every one of you monkeys is down in my
book, and all the damage will be paid for.

694
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,371
You've got 10 minutes to clear out.

695
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:46,499
Just stick your nose back in this county,
any of you...

696
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,544
and you'll never see daylight again
as long as you live.

697
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:51,379
Now, get.

698
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,222
Some coffee.
