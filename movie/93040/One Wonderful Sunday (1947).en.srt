Directed by
AKIRA KUROSAWA

18
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,074
I haven't had a smoke
in three days.

19
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,918
Sorry I was late.

20
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,714
You shouldn't have come.

21
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,758
There's no point.

22
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,288
Why?

23
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,095
I've only got 15 yen.
What kind of date is that?

24
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,464
I have a little money too.

25
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,336
I'm a man.

26
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,442
I can't spend
a woman's money.

27
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,134
Don't say that.

28
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,891
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,537
I only have 20 yen myself.

30
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,850
It's okay
if you don't have money.

31
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,917
I used to think that way too,
but not now.

32
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,823
People only realize the value
of money when they're broke.

33
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,760
You've changed, Yuzo.

34
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,402
Just wised up, that's all.

35
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,373
Let's not discuss it anymore.

36
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,076
Just leave it all to me.

37
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,249
It's a wonderful Sunday.

38
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,888
A Sunday with 35 yen.

39
00:04:55,561 --> 00:05:01,090
"A new type of residence,
more comfortable, and cheaper to build.

40
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:06,597
Special price of 100,000 yen
for the first 100 buyers."

41
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,736
Doesn't that sound great?

42
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,433
Let's take a look.

43
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,447
It's free to look.

44
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,583
We'd be wasting our time.

45
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,312
Just a look.
Come on, hurry.

46
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,426
Come on!

47
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,943
Come on, hurry up.

48
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,642
Through the front door.

49
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,521
Welcome! Please come in!

50
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,231
Welcome.

51
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,797
What's wrong?

52
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,644
Nice and bright, isn't it?

53
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,617
The workmanship is horrible.

54
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,979
This would've cost
1,000 yen before.

55
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,088
Maybe so.

56
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,888
But the layout isn't bad.

57
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,692
This is the living room.

58
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,036
The cupboard would go here.

59
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,072
The low table would go here.

60
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:55,939
I don't need a vanity or bureau,
but I'd like a Western-style dresser.

61
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:03,645
And some rattan chairs.

62
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,931
If we had a garden,
I'd plant tomatoes and green peas.

63
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,635
Let's go.

64
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,271
This is foolishness.

65
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,940
Why?

66
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,845
You're being unrealistic.

67
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,114
You're in a dream world.

68
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,045
We're penniless.

69
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,887
Don't call us that.

70
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,747
Well, aren't we?

71
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,459
We literally don't have
a penny in the bank.

72
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:47,361
We have to face reality
to survive in a world like this.

73
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:55,100
This is the kind of world
where you need dreams the most.

74
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,936
You can't live without them.
It'd be too painful.

75
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,004
Dreams won't fill your belly.

76
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:13,625
You had dreams too,
before you went off to war.

77
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:36,444
We said we'd open a nice caf�
after we got married, remember?

78
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,412
Good coffee and pastries
at a fair price.

79
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,018
"The Hyacinth Caf�."

80
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,549
We even gave it a name.

81
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,200
The war destroyed that dream.

82
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:03,198
Right now we have to figure out
some way just to survive.

83
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,206
Let's think about that first.

84
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,140
I do.

85
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:11,840
I think about it 100 times a day.
We don't even have a place to live!

86
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:16,784
You live with your sister.
I stay in a friend's room.

87
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,986
How much longer
will it be like this?

88
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:26,828
You're all I have left
in the world.

89
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,134
No matter how small it is,

90
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,331
I want a place
we can call our own.

91
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,188
I don't like it.

92
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,264
But there's plenty of light.

93
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,266
- It's flimsy.
- 100,000 yen is cheap.

94
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,063
Let's go.

95
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,642
Sorry for the intrusion.

96
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,880
I hate matchbox houses.

97
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,654
It's cheap,
and you get what you pay for.

98
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,718
But it's better
than that room we saw for rent.

99
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:09,124
At least the wood isn't knotty.
Not bad by today's standards.

100
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,871
Sorry to bother you,

101
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,006
but did you mention
a room for rent?

102
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,608
Oh, that place
was too filthy to consider.

103
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,439
May I ask where it was?

104
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,171
Very well.

105
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,811
See where
that car just turned?

106
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,251
Follow that road
to the rail crossing...

107
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,298
FRONT DESK

108
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,859
Pardon me.
We just came to inquire:

109
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:51,097
Do you have a room for rent?

110
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,106
That's right.

111
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,206
How big is it?

112
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,982
Six tatami mats.

113
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,354
No direct light whatsoever.

114
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,488
All you see from the window

115
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,662
are the toilets
of the factory next door.

116
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,035
It's cold, so you're bound

117
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,535
to have rheumatism
all winter long.

118
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,641
And it's terrible
in the summer too.

119
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,172
You'll probably end up

120
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,907
with typhus.

121
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,566
May we see it anyway?

122
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,033
Sure you can...

123
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,371
but I wouldn't recommend it.

124
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,910
Actually,
that used to be my room.

125
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,716
I got sick and couldn't
pay the rent for two months.

126
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:21,726
The landlord seized my things
and evicted me.

127
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,024
Now I sleep in the bathroom,

128
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,992
and I have to work here
during the day.

129
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,968
I tell you,
the landlord's a bastard.

130
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,702
Do you have
lawful employment?

131
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,910
We also do not
allow children.

132
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,810
We have no children.

133
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,178
You'll need
three guarantors in Tokyo.

134
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,683
We have that.

135
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,221
Rent and all fees
must be paid in new yen.

136
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,793
Don't do it.
Take my advice.

137
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,432
How much is the rent?

138
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:05,434
Just look what happened to me!
That landlord -

139
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:12,172
It's 600 yen,
and key money is 2,000.

140
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,441
Between the two of us,

141
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,244
we make 1,200 yen a month.

142
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,514
Maybe we should just forget it.

143
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:30,851
But let's say
we pay half of that in rent.

144
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,802
We just can't afford it.

145
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,939
We'd have to go hungry
half the month.

146
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,105
Plus the key money
is 2,000 yen.

147
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,047
The nerve!

148
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,477
Asking if we have
"lawful employment"!

149
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:58,088
Who could afford it
even with a good job?

150
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,451
Trying to make fools of us!

151
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,894
Black marketeering passes
for "lawful" these days.

152
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,002
We're the exception
because we're honest.

153
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,167
<i>Our ball, please!</i>

154
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:21,710
I wish people in big houses thought
about people like us sometimes.

155
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,580
You think they care?

156
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,819
They only care
about themselves.

157
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,868
<i>Our ball, please!</i>
<i>Hey, lady!</i>

158
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,278
They look worried!

159
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,750
Hey, let me play!

160
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,793
Is that okay?

161
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,530
Fine with me.

162
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,714
Back up!

163
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,177
Play ball!

164
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,614
Strike him out!

165
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:36,913
Strike him out!

166
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,555
He's a sitting duck!

167
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,061
Come on!

168
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,323
Come on!

169
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,576
Let him hit it!

170
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,342
Time out!

171
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,425
Get ready!

172
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,533
Come on!

173
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:03,832
Ball!

174
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,656
DELICIOUS SWEET BUNS

175
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,599
Who did that?

176
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,350
Don't cry. Good boy.

177
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,459
You? Aren't you
a little big for this?

178
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,756
I'm sorry.
Any damage?

179
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,829
Damage?

180
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,250
You wanna buy these off me?

181
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,389
How much?

182
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,792
With a discount, ten yen.

183
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,637
Troublemaker!

184
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,182
What now?

185
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,567
You're a strong hitter.

186
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,429
The man threw in
an extra one for free.

187
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,971
Don't cry, okay?

188
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,941
Isn't that nice?

189
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,074
Don't cry, okay?

190
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,116
Be a good boy.

191
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:34,754
If it hadn't been for that,
we wouldn't have these buns to eat.

192
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,336
They're good.

193
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,544
- We've got 25 yen left.
- Whose card is this?

194
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,081
An old army buddy's.

195
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,091
Our sergeant
beat him constantly.

196
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,557
He couldn't even
salute properly.

197
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,066
But now he's made it big.

198
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:21,638
I ran into him the other day.
He's opened a cabaret.

199
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,603
Let me see.

200
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,075
Hey, little boy!

201
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:36,615
I've never been to a cabaret.
I'd like to go.

202
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,790
Why? You don't even dance.

203
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,924
I just want to see.

204
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,953
Take me there.

205
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,925
I don't really like him.

206
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,827
But he's still your friend, right?

207
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,668
Wouldn't he show us around?

208
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,463
Yeah, but -

209
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,436
Then let's go.

210
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,735
I want to see it.
Come on!

211
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:08,409
CABARET DRUM
KIKUZO SEGAWA, OWNER

212
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,404
Is Mr. Segawa in?

213
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,472
Welcome.

214
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,012
I'd like to see the owner.

215
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,106
Is he in?

216
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,749
Please wait a moment.

217
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:35,104
What's the nature of your visit?
Perhaps I can help.

218
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,172
Um, I'd like...

219
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,169
I'd like to see Mr. Segawa.

220
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,057
I'm a friend.

221
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,918
I'm afraid
at the moment he's...

222
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,799
Spit it out.
Is he here or not?

223
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,938
No need to get upset.
This way, please.

224
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,266
Please, come this way.

225
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,070
Follow him.

226
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,543
Please come in.

227
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,487
This way, please.

228
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,896
<i>Hey.</i>

229
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:21,043
You're new here.
What gang are you with?

230
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:25,706
- What?
- You heard me! What gang?

231
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,942
Who's your boss?

232
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:36,252
Oh, I get it!
You're not a gangster!

233
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,776
The manager's on his way.

234
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,207
Hey!

235
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:04,354
I came to see Mr. Segawa.
If he's not in -

236
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,421
Just hold on.

237
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,092
Not bad for an amateur!

238
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,754
Good idea, saying
you wanna see "Mr. Segawa."

239
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,833
That'll get you
half a dozen bottles.

240
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,032
Just saying "the owner"
wouldn't have worked.

241
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:29,304
They'd throw you some yen
and send you off.

242
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,677
Wait.

243
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:35,717
You have to apply yourself
to learn anything.

244
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:39,881
This business isn't
as easy as you think.

245
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:44,321
For example, say,
"May I please see the owner?"

246
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:48,625
And it's "Out the door
and never come back!"

247
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,367
Hey, you!

248
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,372
How wasteful!

249
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,126
Damn it all!

250
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,492
These dishes are at least
100 yen each.

251
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,558
Hey!

252
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,069
Not here.
The bathroom's that way.

253
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,567
The hostesses get sick
once in a while.

254
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,566
Poor kids!

255
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:38,836
They have to drink to make money
and wind up overdoing it.

256
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,093
Unfortunately Mr. Segawa can't see you.
Please enjoy your visit.

257
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:08,338
Holy cow, you hit the big time!

258
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,911
What are you doing?

259
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,075
What about this?

260
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,091
Well, was he there?

261
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,113
He was out, right?

262
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,245
That's okay.

263
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,552
We'll save it for next Sunday.

264
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:58,842
- A wonderful Sunday...
- Commemorated with a photo.

265
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,166
Our first time here...

266
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,329
the cherry blossoms
were blooming.

267
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,769
It'll be spring again soon.

268
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,572
But it's getting colder.

269
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:35,045
What if it snows?
- We can make two snowmen.

270
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,920
Do you have a winter coat?

271
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,254
This raincoat is thick enough.

272
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,962
I saw your shoes.

273
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,840
You mean the big hole?

274
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,440
They drain quicker that way

275
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,442
if they get wet.

276
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,213
What's wrong?
Are you angry?

277
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,821
No.

278
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,622
I just feel worthless, that's all.

279
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,821
Why?

280
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,694
I'm sick of my job.

281
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:27,799
At this rate
we'll never get married.

282
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,439
I'm thinking of quitting.

283
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:34,611
And then what?
Find another job?

284
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:35,938
No.

285
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,410
Then what?

286
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,879
The black market?

287
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,646
No, not that!

288
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,758
Honest people can't even
afford the train these days!

289
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,689
But still -

290
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,455
What do you want?
Money?

291
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,992
I don't want money.

292
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,738
I want a rice ball.

293
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,243
I'll give you 10 yen for one.

294
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,277
Keep your money.

295
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:50,382
Don't be stupid.
Just take it.

296
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,421
That's all right.
Eat it.

297
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:56,917
Really?

298
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,493
Thanks.

299
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:44,065
Where are your parents?

300
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,412
Any brothers and sisters?

301
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,185
Aren't you cold?

302
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,652
What a pain!
Everyone ask the same questions.

303
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,924
Don't worry about me.
Worry about yourselves.

304
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,398
Right, lady?

305
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:19,710
How much do you make a day?

306
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:23,945
Where do you live?
Downtown?

307
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,923
You're a sad case.

308
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,525
Stop acting big, mister!

309
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,699
You're just an ex-soldier,
no better than anyone else.

310
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,368
You go home and eat
nothing but potatoes.

311
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,440
Don't be stupid.
It's not our fault.

312
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,809
But I still feel terrible.

313
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,611
What are you talking about?
Come on.

314
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,548
I can't stand it.

315
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,183
I feel so confused and upset.

316
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,922
Just forget it.

317
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:08,080
He's a child just like them,
yet they lead such different lives.

318
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,350
He's no child.

319
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,019
I'd say he's older than us -

320
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,749
Stop it!

321
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,628
I'll probably see him
in my dreams tonight.

322
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,592
Stop it now!

323
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,482
I'm over it now.

324
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,657
But now where do we go?

325
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:07,737
ZOO

326
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,843
How about the zoo?

327
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,816
We can be like children
and forget all the bad stuff.

328
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,256
Twenty-three yen left.

329
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:34,298
WALKING PATH

330
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:41,209
When I came here as a kid,
I'd just suddenly start running.

331
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,637
Let's run!

332
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,484
Look!
Pigs in the lion's cage!

333
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:55,082
The world these days
is run by pigs

334
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,888
who've gotten fat
on the black market.

335
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,500
What a happy couple!

336
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,930
That's because
they can sleep on the water.

337
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,512
- What fine coats!
- Don't shout!

338
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:23,982
What a life,
being able to survive on paper!

339
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:28,625
Tissue paper ain't cheap!
Two dozen sheets run 20 yen.

340
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,527
What a nice house!

341
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,029
With central heating!

342
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:46,139
They act like we're the show
and not them.

343
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,904
Look at him.

344
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:54,044
He looks like he pities us.
- Stop it!

345
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,818
That bird looks depressed.

346
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:03,521
Exactly like the man
we spoke to about the room.

347
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,218
"No direct light whatsoever"?

348
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,562
He looks depressed too.

349
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,070
You're the one who's depressed.

350
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,217
"Animals are happy.

351
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:39,192
They don't have to deal
with inflation."

352
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,196
It's raining.
As if things weren't bad enough.

353
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,811
It's winter.
It should be snowing instead.

354
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:11,121
What shall we do now?

355
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,761
We have lots of time
on our hands.

356
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,758
Time isn't much use
without money.

357
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,904
We've still got 20 yen.

358
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,032
Let's go see a movie.

359
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:30,777
Seeing movies, taking walks -

360
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,742
we've had
enough dates like that.

361
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:47,730
What?

362
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,663
What is it?

363
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,072
Come on.

364
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,046
Tell me.

365
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,745
How about coming to my place?

366
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,249
Won't your roommate be there?

367
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,998
He won't be back until late.

368
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:50,118
Why don't we go
to my house instead?

369
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:59,192
With 16 people in your tiny house,
a guest is in the way.

370
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,337
Afraid to go back?

371
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,768
Your sister and I
don't get along so well.

372
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,809
That's normal.

373
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,073
She's always complaining.

374
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:15,012
She and I
are like night and day.

375
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:21,283
Let's go. My room's not clean,
but I can make you some tea.

376
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,628
Don't you want to come?

377
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,412
Why?

378
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,608
It's just...

379
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,085
Then let's say good-bye here.

380
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:54,246
No point
catching cold in the rain.

381
00:44:56,393 --> 00:45:00,796
You can only do
so much with 35 yen.

382
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,763
I'll catch a streetcar.
Bye.

383
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,994
Wait a minute!

384
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,971
So... you're coming then?

385
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,911
Well?

386
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:25,682
Are you coming?

387
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,087
Make up your mind.

388
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:41,263
SCHUBERT'S
<i>UNFINISHED</i> SYMPHONY

389
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:44,233
Let's go hear this concert!

390
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:53,239
Remember our first date?

391
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,811
We went to a concert.

392
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,981
The same <i>Unfinished</i> Symphony.

393
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:05,295
It won't be the same.
We'll only be disappointed.

394
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:06,724
Why?

395
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,093
Those musicians
are working in dance halls now.

396
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,566
But Schubert isn't working
in a dance hall, is he?

397
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,468
The <i>Unfinished</i> Symphony
hasn't changed.

398
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:21,269
Come on, let's go!

399
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,681
Can you get in a concert
for 10 yen these days?

400
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,249
Look here.

401
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,685
"B tickets, 10 yen."

402
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,526
Art is for the masses.

403
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:40,788
We can make it if we hurry.

404
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,195
Let's hurry!

405
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,127
Come on!

406
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,115
This train's so slow!

407
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:35,877
Faster, faster!

408
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:38,520
<i>Allegro vivace!</i>

409
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,000
We made it in time!

410
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,884
I want this many B tickets.

411
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,452
I can't do that.

412
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:21,053
Why not?
I'm paying for them.

413
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:33,230
B tickets for 15 yen!

414
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:36,199
I want this many B tickets.

415
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,809
There are only a few left.

416
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,946
Give me all of 'em.

417
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,209
Hurry it up!

418
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,622
The nerve!

419
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,191
No more B tickets.
- You have A tickets?

420
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,886
Yes.

421
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,065
Only A tickets left.

422
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,005
What are you waiting for?

423
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,909
Hurry it up!

424
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:22,142
B tickets here, 15 yen!

425
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,912
B tickets right here, 15 yen!

426
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:48,437
B tickets, 15 yen.

427
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,113
B tickets right here, 15 yen.

428
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,080
Anyone for B tickets?
Fifteen yen.

429
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,820
Fifteen yen!

430
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,690
B tickets, 15 yen.

431
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,329
I'll pay 10.

432
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:08,793
Don't be an idiot!

433
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:12,730
You're causing trouble.
Sell them for 10.

434
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:15,131
I paid good money for them!

435
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,165
Ten yen!

436
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:20,974
Get out of here, you idiot!

437
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,810
What now?

438
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,354
What now, you bastard?

439
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:42,660
Let's get out of here. Hurry!

440
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,892
Come on. Hurry!

441
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,696
What's going on?

442
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,068
What do you think you're doing?

443
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,870
Huh? What are you doing?

444
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,412
You've got
some nerve, chump.

445
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,534
Now, who needs tickets?

446
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,931
Fifteen yen!

447
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:51,232
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

448
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:58,941
What a terrible Sunday
this has turned into.

449
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,805
I'm going home.

450
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,874
You should too.

451
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,424
What's the matter?

452
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:45,636
I can't leave you
alone like this.

453
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:51,472
I can't leave feeling this way.

454
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:59,078
We won't see each other
until next Sunday.

455
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,825
Does your arm hurt?

456
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:17,973
It's not my body that hurts.

457
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,781
Shall I make some tea?

458
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:46,717
I don't want
anything to drink.

459
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,928
I'll go get some sweets.

460
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:57,465
I don't want any.

461
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,837
What should I do?

462
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,546
All you do
is act mean to me.

463
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:21,423
Please don't make
that frightening face.

464
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:29,156
Aren't you fed up
with me by now?

465
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,169
I'm just a stray dog.

466
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,145
I'm sick of being like this.

467
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,152
Sick of being so miserable.

468
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:09,429
Everyone's miserable
these days.

469
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,267
It's too much.

470
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:18,447
You never see past
the present moment.

471
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:23,212
You never try to look
to the future with hope.

472
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:27,217
How can I
when I feel like this?

473
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,622
All I see is darkness.

474
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,067
I can't take it anymore.

475
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:19,135
It feels like everyone's
turned their back on me.

476
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:26,281
I feel my courage
fading bit by bit.

477
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,791
I can't even rely on myself.

478
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:48,630
I just feel like...

479
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,908
smashing everything to pieces.

480
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,749
Masako!

481
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:21,532
You're all I've got.

482
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,213
You're all that's left.

483
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,356
No! Don't!

484
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,144
Always the prim little lady.

485
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:17,982
I'm going home.

486
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,928
So is this the end?

487
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,701
Masako!

488
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,370
It's okay!

489
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:04,281
I understand.

490
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:06,578
Don't be silly!

491
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:09,551
It's okay!

492
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:12,756
It's okay.

493
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,906
You silly girl!

494
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:38,279
It's all right!

495
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,260
I understand how you feel.

496
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,032
Come on.

497
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,485
Silly fool.

498
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,470
Don't cry.

499
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,286
Silly fool.

500
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,244
The sun's come out.

501
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:08,896
What do you say
we go out again?

502
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:15,134
We'll get some tea.

503
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,698
What are you thinking about?

504
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:50,738
Nothing.

505
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,074
Are you angry?

506
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:57,782
No.

507
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,351
I'm happy.

508
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:08,486
You've been quiet
the whole time.

509
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:17,164
I don't say much
when I'm happy.

510
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,807
What's wrong?

511
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:58,603
We're in trouble.

512
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:04,381
Thirty yen?

513
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:09,315
That's strange.

514
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:14,362
Look. Coffee is five yen.

515
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:17,623
The pastries are five.

516
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,767
Right, five yen each.

517
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,864
Four times five is 20.

518
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:28,203
Something's strange.

519
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:39,719
It says two <i>caf� au lait.</i>
They're 10 yen each, so 20.

520
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:45,553
With two pastries,
it comes to 30.

521
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:54,826
What a scam!

522
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,567
What should we do?

523
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:11,282
Let's go.

524
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:15,715
Excuse me.

525
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:19,385
That'll be 30 yen.

526
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:34,639
You can pay next time.

527
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:36,936
I'll be back for it tomorrow.

528
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,687
- How much was he short?
- Ten yen.

529
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:10,872
We should have
never gone in.

530
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:16,978
I thought we could finally
enjoy a happy moment,

531
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,810
but it all got
messed up again.

532
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:36,103
You're wrong.

533
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,937
Let's open the Hyacinth Caf�.

534
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:47,509
If it takes three years,
or even five,

535
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:50,150
we're going to open a caf�.

536
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:52,980
No matter what!

537
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:02,921
That wasn't coffee -
it was brown water!

538
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:09,101
They put in a drop of milk
and charge

539
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:10,999
20 yen!

540
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:24,551
It's our duty to open an honest, affordable
shop and put 'em out of business!

541
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:27,847
Great!
You're your old self again.

542
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:31,489
Pipe down.

543
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:36,026
No matter what they say,
we're opening a shop.

544
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,398
I don't care how small.

545
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,626
Even a tent!
An open-air stand!

546
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,806
- So we'll close when it rains?
- Don't be foolish!

547
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:47,600
Our customers won't allow it!

548
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:49,743
Come wind or rain,

549
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:53,142
they won't be able to live
without my delicious coffee.

550
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:54,975
And at a fair price.

551
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:56,878
Of course!

552
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,190
High volume at low margins!

553
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:08,893
A caf� for the masses!

554
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:16,761
One day we'll get there.

555
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:25,702
Nine feet wide
is enough to start.

556
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:40,050
The glass door will say
in gold letters,

557
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:43,425
"The Hyacinth -
A Caf� for the Masses."

558
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:47,466
Not gold.
Cobalt blue enamel.

559
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:51,063
But gold Gothic lettering
would be great.

560
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:53,002
Cobalt blue.

561
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:00,373
Gold lettering doesn't go with
"caf� for the masses."

562
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,106
But -

563
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:05,579
Well, it doesn't matter.

564
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:08,221
First you open
the revolving door.

565
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:22,058
The counter is here.

566
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,898
Customers can watch
the coffee being made.

567
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:26,630
I'm a coffee whiz!

568
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:29,366
The pastry case will go here.

569
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,416
We'll hang an elegant
oil painting up here.

570
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:42,149
The curtains will be
a soft cobalt blue.

571
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:43,984
Cobalt blue again?

572
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:46,160
Leave the colors to me.

573
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:50,921
Tables will go here,
with plenty of room in between.

574
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,066
For customers' comfort.

575
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:56,863
We'll have tables for the masses,
nice and long.

576
01:22:57,072 --> 01:22:58,300
I object.

577
01:22:58,506 --> 01:22:59,871
Why?

578
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:05,175
We need small tables too -
for lovers.

579
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:11,883
It's important to create
a quiet ambience.

580
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:15,586
We have to have
a gramophone.

581
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:18,022
And carefully chosen records.

582
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:20,050
No pop songs.

583
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:22,619
At least "The Apple Song."

584
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,329
Good coffee will be
our point of pride.

585
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:28,661
And cute little
homemade cakes.

586
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,831
I'll play the customer.

587
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:44,051
Welcome.

588
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:50,483
One coffee and a pastry.

589
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,125
Coming up.

590
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:04,534
Wow, that was fast!

591
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:08,808
We don't take too long
like some other caf�s,

592
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:13,242
and our coffee's
not lukewarm like theirs.

593
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:29,686
You're right.
It's not bad.

594
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:32,492
Some milk?

595
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:36,158
Even with milk...
- It's still not 10 yen!

596
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:42,503
Tell me:

597
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,803
Who said he didn't want

598
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:48,210
to think about the future,
that he had no dreams?

599
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:40,992
<i>The moon is rising</i>

600
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:47,508
<i>The round, round moon</i>

601
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:54,980
<i>As round as round gets</i>
<i>As round as a dish</i>

602
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:56,548
Silly!

603
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:58,480
- Hey.
- What?

604
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:01,587
Remember I said,
"Dreams won't fill your belly"?

605
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:03,222
I take it back.

606
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:04,891
Why?

607
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:09,452
I had no dinner tonight,
but I'm not even hungry.

608
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:22,739
You're like a little boy.

609
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:26,774
The tiniest little boy
in the world.

610
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,220
Careful!

611
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:11,722
- I've got an idea!
- What?

612
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:17,621
AMPHITHEATER

613
01:27:57,672 --> 01:27:59,401
Your special box seat.

614
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:04,272
What are you going to do?

615
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:19,883
You can create worlds
in your dreams, right?

616
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:30,703
Very well.

617
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:34,602
I give you

618
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:36,743
the <i>Unfinished</i> Symphony.

619
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:45,779
I'm the conductor.

620
01:28:48,723 --> 01:28:50,918
The orchestra's
all invisible men.

621
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:56,988
Don't laugh.

622
01:29:09,744 --> 01:29:11,041
Look.

623
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:14,579
Everyone's in tuxedos,

624
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:17,444
in their places,
holding their instruments.

625
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,950
I can see it clearly.

626
01:29:28,096 --> 01:29:31,224
They're tuning up.

627
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:39,535
You can hear them, right?

628
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,005
Right?

629
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:49,383
Good!

630
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:54,806
What's wrong?

631
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:06,856
Are you sure
you can hear it?

632
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:11,993
I can hear it!

633
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:15,028
Of course I can hear it!

634
01:31:16,938 --> 01:31:17,905
All right, then!

635
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:31,050
This will be the most
beautiful night of our lives!

636
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:39,276
What's wrong?
Why did you stop?

637
01:33:41,816 --> 01:33:43,249
It's no good.

638
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:47,046
You're wrong!
I could hear it!

639
01:33:47,989 --> 01:33:50,287
You have to believe in it.

640
01:33:53,694 --> 01:33:56,162
Come on. Just try.

641
01:33:57,832 --> 01:34:00,357
Come on, try!

642
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:55,050
What's the matter?

643
01:34:56,190 --> 01:35:00,286
I'm telling you,
I can hear it.

644
01:35:02,063 --> 01:35:05,328
Just try!

645
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:12,400
Please.

646
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:14,838
Try!

647
01:36:05,993 --> 01:36:11,454
Ladies and gentlemen,
a round of applause!

648
01:36:11,665 --> 01:36:16,034
Please find it in your hearts
to cheer him on.

649
01:36:16,804 --> 01:36:18,533
Please.

650
01:36:19,907 --> 01:36:23,900
There are so many
poor young lovers like us in this world.

651
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:30,573
Please give us all
a big hand.

652
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:37,721
We're freezing
in the cold winds of this world.

653
01:36:37,925 --> 01:36:40,758
Do it for poor young lovers
everywhere.

654
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:46,632
Please cheer us on.

655
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:52,164
Help us dream
beautiful dreams.

656
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:57,270
Please, a round of applause.

657
01:36:58,512 --> 01:37:00,639
Please.

658
01:37:03,517 --> 01:37:07,009
Please applaud!

659
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:10,580
