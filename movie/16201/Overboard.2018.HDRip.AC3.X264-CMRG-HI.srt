00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:10,074
Okay, well, then stick to the script.
We have a plan.

478
00:26:10,076 --> 00:26:12,876
One month until the test.
Bobby will hire him,

479
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:15,613
and he'll be an extra paycheck,
so you have time to study.

480
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,816
I barely know the guy.
I am not gonna let him move in.

481
00:26:18,818 --> 00:26:20,850
But you're gonna
be there, studying.

482
00:26:20,852 --> 00:26:21,819
That's why it's genius.

483
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,686
He'll never have to be
alone with the kids.

484
00:26:23,688 --> 00:26:24,754
Come on.

485
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:26,659
You're doing this
for your girls.

486
00:26:27,926 --> 00:26:29,827
I'm doing this for my girls.

487
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:30,794
There you go.

488
00:26:30,796 --> 00:26:33,732
Okay, here, use this.
Bobby won't even notice.

489
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:36,899
Good news.

490
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:39,802
Your wife has come
to take you home.

491
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:42,841
(SCOFFS) Finally.
It's about time.

492
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:46,079
What? Wait.

493
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,080
I'm married?

494
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:52,585
Hi, honey.

495
00:26:56,421 --> 00:26:58,891
I do not recognize this lady.

496
00:27:00,693 --> 00:27:02,192
(SIGHS) I was afraid
this would happen.

497
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:04,998
Did you bring the materials
we talked about?

498
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:09,966
I know this must be
very disorienting,

499
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:12,138
but here's our
marriage license.

500
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,007
My name is Leo Sullivan?

501
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,842
Yes. Your great-grandfather...

502
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:24,013
Your great-great-grandfather,
Finbar Sullivan,

503
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:30,721
emigrated from Ireland, to fight
for Mexico in the war of 1846.

504
00:27:30,723 --> 00:27:31,557
(SMACKS LIPS)

505
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:36,061
That's gobbledygook!
It can't be true.

506
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:42,165
Honey, we have been
married for 15 years.

507
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,702
We have three
wonderful daughters.

508
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,937
No, there's no way
I have children.

509
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:49,740
And if I did,
they'd be sons.

510
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:51,140
I'm just saying.

511
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:55,781
I have your passport,
your birth certificate...

512
00:27:56,115 --> 00:27:57,947
Oh...

513
00:27:57,949 --> 00:28:00,317
Here's a photo
from our honeymoon.

514
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,921
We went to Reno?

515
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:04,788
Now I know you're lying.

516
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,090
Leo! Sweetie,
stop puzzling.

517
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:07,959
I'm puzzling.

518
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:12,029
You and I are
Mr. and Mrs. Leo Sullivan.

519
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:13,667
We met in Cancun.

520
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,933
You were a tour guide.

521
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:18,268
I was working
on a cruise ship.

522
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,337
Is any of this
ringing a bell?

523
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:22,306
Nope. Nothing.

524
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:24,907
We dated
every time I docked.

525
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:26,944
We would get
frozen yogurt

526
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:29,847
and watch the sunset
over the Playa Tortugas.

527
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:31,781
That's where
we fell in love.

528
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:33,884
Sounds like you're
a romantic, Leo.

529
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:35,219
(SIGHS) Look, look, look.

530
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:38,088
I admit there are many things
I've forgotten,

531
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,190
but from the depths
of my soul,

532
00:28:40,192 --> 00:28:42,091
I know I'm not married
to this woman.

533
00:28:42,093 --> 00:28:45,863
So, unless I see
some real proof,

534
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:48,301
I'm getting a slice
of pie at the cafeteria, hmm?

535
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:51,870
Good luck, crazy lady.

536
00:28:52,804 --> 00:28:55,305
Wait, wait. Wait. Honey?

537
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:58,142
I didn't wanna say this,

538
00:28:58,144 --> 00:29:00,144
because I know
it embarrasses you.

539
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:04,984
But you have a tattoo of a cartoon
mouse on your right butt cheek.

540
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:06,785
No, I don't.

541
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,196
You're really my wife?

542
00:29:20,198 --> 00:29:22,301
For better or worse, baby.

543
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:53,163
All right, here we are.

544
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:57,203
I know it doesn't look like
much, but it's full of love.

545
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:08,180
I'm poor?

546
00:30:08,414 --> 00:30:09,782
Yup.

547
00:30:15,186 --> 00:30:16,790
Come on in.

548
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,357
Oh, Dad!

549
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,126
- Daddy!
- We missed you so much.

550
00:30:24,128 --> 00:30:25,328
(DOG BARKS)

551
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,199
I'm so glad you're okay.

552
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:31,467
Emily?

553
00:30:31,469 --> 00:30:32,869
Hey.

554
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:34,937
She's too cool to admit it,

555
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:38,075
but she was
the most worried of all.

556
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:41,848
(STAMMERING) I'm sorry, I
don't recognize any of you.

557
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:44,146
Oh, come on.

558
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:48,085
Molly, Olivia, Emily,

559
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:50,023
your three musketeers?

560
00:30:51,055 --> 00:30:52,088
No.

561
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,894
Uh... I've got homework.

562
00:31:01,032 --> 00:31:02,366
How come they don't
look like me?

563
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:04,100
Oh, sweetie...

564
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:06,002
We had trouble
getting pregnant,

565
00:31:06,004 --> 00:31:07,974
so we had to use
a sperm donor.

566
00:31:09,274 --> 00:31:10,440
I'm sterile?

567
00:31:10,442 --> 00:31:12,442
That doesn't change a thing.

568
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:14,278
You are still their father.

569
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,380
You've done everything
for this family.

570
00:31:17,382 --> 00:31:20,986
Taken two, even three jobs.

571
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:22,220
I work?

572
00:31:22,222 --> 00:31:24,387
How do you think
we can pay for all of this?

573
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:28,258
I'm afraid to ask, but
what do I do for a living?

574
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
Well, before
you got laid off,

575
00:31:30,262 --> 00:31:32,296
you were a foreman at
the poultry processing plant.

576
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:33,963
Luckily, Bobby,

577

my boss's husband,
you met bowling,

578
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:38,935
gave you a job
at his construction company.

579
00:31:38,937 --> 00:31:42,271
It is awful, backbreaking
work, I know,

00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:44,107
but we are lucky
to have it.

(SIGHS)

582
00:31:45,977 --> 00:31:49,014
I need a drink.
Lots of them.

- (CHUCKLES)
- What? Please don't tell me I'm sober?

584
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:57,087
You had your three-year chip,

585
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:58,355
but then you relapsed

586
00:31:58,357 --> 00:32:01,457
and you ended up on that beach.

587
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:06,128
So what is that? Four days?
You got four days, honey.

No alcohol. Whatsoever.

00:32:15,273 --> 00:32:17,441
I need to use the restroom.

593
00:32:17,443 --> 00:32:20,476
I assume it's that room
over there with the toilet.

- Hey!
- Hi.

Under the sink!

00:33:25,476 --> 00:33:26,579
Of course.

00:33:29,348 --> 00:33:31,114
(CHUCKLING) Yes.

00:33:31,116 --> 00:33:33,386
Under the sink,
of course.

Alive or...

614
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:57,510
Good thoughts, people.
Only good thoughts.

615
00:34:04,515 --> 00:34:06,450
I was fat?

616
00:34:06,452 --> 00:34:11,554
Um, yeah. You didn't make the best
decisions when you were drinking, honey.

617
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:13,255
(WHISPERING) Tomorrow
we're going to Goodwill.

618
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:14,657
Bobby's skinny clothes
are not skinny.

619
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,393
I assume these Seahawks
are some kind of sports team

620
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:19,128
and I'm a big fan,

621
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,396
because most of my clothes

622
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:22,699
have this God-awful
green and blue bird on it.

623
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:25,501
Football, Dad.
It's our thing.

624
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:27,570
We watch every game together.

625
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:29,438
Even when I haven't
done my homework.

626
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,007
Hey. Everyone does
their homework.

627
00:34:31,009 --> 00:34:35,277
Including me. And right now I've gotta
memorize protocols for thoracic surgery.

628
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:38,181
So, Leo, why don't you get
dinner started?

00:34:38,183 --> 00:34:41,518
What? Cook? Me? Cook?

632
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:49,592
While I'm studying for my exam,

633
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:52,329
you keep the house running.

634
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:55,132
But I don't even know
how to turn on the stove.

635
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,467
Oh! Honey, come on.

636
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:01,473
Salad, pasta. There's a jar
of sauce in the fridge.

Yes, I do.

1292
01:14:27,971 --> 01:14:30,671
It's based on
an old, Spanish legend.

01:14:30,673 --> 01:14:32,273
- (LAUGHS)
- Yeah.

1294
01:14:32,275 --> 01:14:34,708
Very romantic, by the way.

1295
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:38,979
You see, there was a poor
housemaid named Catalina.

1296
01:14:38,981 --> 01:14:44,652
She was very pretty and caught the eye
of the colonial governor's son, Arturo.

Okay, wait. You don't
remember anything,

1298

yet you remember this?

1299
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:50,858
It's a very famous legend.

1300
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:52,560
So, they fell in love.

1301
01:14:52,562 --> 01:14:53,627
Of course.

1302
01:14:53,629 --> 01:14:55,729
But Arturo's father forbade it.

1303
01:14:55,731 --> 01:14:59,300
He couldn't have his only son
running around with a commoner.

1304
01:14:59,302 --> 01:15:03,671
So, he ordered Arturo to return
to Spain, which he did.

1305
01:15:03,673 --> 01:15:06,707
But not before
promising Catalina

1306
01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:08,975
he'd come back
and signal for her

1307
01:15:08,977 --> 01:15:11,748
with three long blasts.

1308
01:15:12,615 --> 01:15:14,649
Just like you heard.

1309
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:18,752
This sounds suspiciously like one of
the shows the kitchen guys watch.

Anyway, a year later,
everything went as planned.

1312
01:15:25,128 --> 01:15:28,628
She swam out,
but the fog was too thick.

1313
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:31,332
He called out,
"Catalina! Catalina!"

1314
01:15:31,334 --> 01:15:34,034
She yelled back,
"Arturo! Arturo!"

1315
01:15:34,036 --> 01:15:36,903
And with that,
he dove into the water.

1316
01:15:36,905 --> 01:15:38,773
They reunited,

1317
01:15:38,775 --> 01:15:41,042
and Catalina, who,
up until that point,

1318
01:15:41,044 --> 01:15:42,577
had been resisting him

1319
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:45,516
because of some test
she had to study for,

1320
01:15:46,048 --> 01:15:48,851
finally let him kiss her.

1321
01:15:49,919 --> 01:15:50,952
Hmm.

1322
01:15:50,954 --> 01:15:52,920
Oh. Now I remember.

1323

about to go in reverse.

A sacred vow,
which I kept, I think.

And don't assume
I didn't have opportunities,

Yes, but that's not the point.

But he is our dad?

No, don't tell him
what I told you to tell him.

Tell him what really
happened. Emily?

blacked out on the beach.

No, damn it!
Tell him the truth!

- We like him.
- We want to keep him.

1406
01:19:57,299 --> 01:20:00,266
You can't keep him.
He doesn't belong to you.

1407
01:20:00,268 --> 01:20:03,304
He didn't belong to you, either,
but that didn't stop you.

No, I'm not.
She's covering for me.

You don't have to lie
for me anymore.

the help I need.

Now, don't worry.
You don't have to tell Bobby.

01:44:20,527 --> 01:44:22,263
Hey, come here.

1751
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:23,895
What are you doing here?

1752
01:44:23,897 --> 01:44:25,064
I was hoping you might
be in the market

1753
01:44:25,066 --> 01:44:28,634
for a top-notch, Scottish nanny
with excellent references.

1754
01:44:28,636 --> 01:44:30,403
You know I'd love that,

1755
01:44:30,405 --> 01:44:32,805
but there's no way
we can afford you.

1756
01:44:32,807 --> 01:44:34,806
Well, in fact you can, sir.

1757
01:44:34,808 --> 01:44:36,475
Sofia sent me back
with the yacht.

1758
01:44:36,477 --> 01:44:37,409
She wanted to remind you

1759
01:44:37,411 --> 01:44:40,378
it was a birthday present
from your father.

1760
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:43,317
The deed is in your name.
It's still yours.

1761
01:44:45,386 --> 01:44:47,586
Oh, my God.

1762
01:44:47,588 --> 01:44:49,424
You mean I can sell it?

1763
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:51,756
It must be worth a fortune.

1764
01:44:51,758 --> 01:44:53,395
Over 60 million.

1765
01:44:57,432 --> 01:44:58,433
Pesos?

1766
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,570
God, no, ma'am. Dollars.

1767
01:45:03,437 --> 01:45:04,537
Oh.

(SCREAMING AND CHEERING)

1770
01:45:19,486 --> 01:45:22,854
By the power invested in me
by the Royal Norwegian Navy,

1771
01:45:22,856 --> 01:45:25,359
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1772

(KIDS SCREAMING)

1773

BOBBY: <i>Okay.</i>

1778
01:46:18,812 --> 01:46:20,979
Before I toast the happy couple,

1779
01:46:20,981 --> 01:46:23,482
let me just dispel a few rumors

1780
01:46:23,484 --> 01:46:24,617
that have been floating around

1781
01:46:24,619 --> 01:46:26,719
about me being cheated on.

1782
01:46:26,721 --> 01:46:30,723
Never happened. Okay?
Not once, not ever.

1783
01:46:30,725 --> 01:46:33,661
There's just so much
I wanna say.

1784
01:46:34,195 --> 01:46:35,764
But I'm not a poet.

1785
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:38,730
I don't have words.

1786
01:46:38,732 --> 01:46:40,502
- I have music.
- (EMILY SPEAKING SPANISH)

1787
01:46:50,844 --> 01:46:54,646
(IN ENGLISH) I'm so sorry I couldn't
be there to celebrate with you.

1788
01:46:54,648 --> 01:46:57,783
But I'm here in the Philippines,

1789
01:46:57,785 --> 01:47:01,586
spearheading the Montenegros'
Children's Education Initiative,

1790
01:47:01,588 --> 01:47:05,024
and, oh, I've been here
helping these kids

1791
01:47:05,026 --> 01:47:09,662
have a happier, better life,
and they adore me.

1792
01:47:09,664 --> 01:47:11,896
- Right?
- No.

1793
01:47:11,898 --> 01:47:13,032
When we first met,

1794
01:47:13,034 --> 01:47:15,067
I was the catch. Okay?

1795
01:47:15,069 --> 01:47:17,036
I was the football player.

1796
01:47:17,038 --> 01:47:18,770
I was the quarterback,
all right?

1797
01:47:18,772 --> 01:47:20,238
She didn't even make
cheerleader.

1798
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:21,907
She was on the spirit squad.

about five minutes from curtain.

1805
01:47:50,804 --> 01:47:53,104
I'm playing Hodel
in <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

1806
01:47:53,106 --> 01:47:55,576
- And I thought now was a good time to talk about allowance.

1808
01:48:06,721 --> 01:48:08,753
I have never in all my puff
been at a wedding

1809
01:48:08,755 --> 01:48:09,954
where there's been a free bar.

1810
01:48:09,956 --> 01:48:12,091
Usually, at the end, the (BLEEP)
tries to settle up the bill.

1811
01:48:12,093 --> 01:48:13,292
And they're,
"Oh, no, I didn't have it.

"I only had beer,

(IN ENGLISH) Bobby has asked me
to read a prepared statement.

1817
01:48:33,748 --> 01:48:35,814
"I never cheated on my husband.
