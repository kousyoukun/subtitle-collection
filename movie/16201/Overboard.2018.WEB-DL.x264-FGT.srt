Watch some sports
like real men.

15
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,483
This has 10 times the emotion
of your football.

16
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:55,554
It's ridiculous.

17
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:58,923
Hey. Sorry, some surfer
gave me wet money.

18
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:00,358
Well, here
are your deliveries.

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,295
Oh, and I would save
650 Cypress for last.

20
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:06,230
Canadian bacon
and pineapple? No. Ew.

21
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:07,932
Hey, he's cute,
and you might have fun.

22
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:09,600
I don't have time for fun.

23
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:10,935
Well, then
you're doing it wrong.

24
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:12,671
Add it to the list.

25
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:14,238
It's not ridiculous.

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,741
These stories come
from real life.

27
00:02:15,743 --> 00:02:17,375
Crazy things happen
all the time.

28
00:02:17,377 --> 00:02:19,644
Come on,
back me up on this.

29
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:20,980
I don't watch
this shit.

30
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:22,648
I don't even hear it. It's
like working at my <i>abuela's.</i>

31
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:30,125
Huh.

32

<i>When suctioning
mucus from a patient's lung,</i>

33

<i>which action completes
the procedure...</i>

34
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,265
Hey, girls,
come on, let's go!

35
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:41,433
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi, Mom!

36
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:43,538
Move! We gotta go!

37
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:48,473
Really, Mom? The sign?

38
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:49,607
Be embarrassed
in the car, okay?

39
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:51,976
I've got eight minutes to get
these pizzas across town.

40
00:02:51,978 --> 00:02:53,180
Move!

41
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:55,480
How was school?

42
00:02:55,482 --> 00:02:57,285
- Fine.
- Oh, don't tip 'em.

43
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:04,255
Change of plans, sir.

44
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:06,591
We're just having
some minor mechanical issues.

45
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:09,428
We'll dock at the nearest
harbor for some repairs

46
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,761
and I'll arrange to have

47
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:12,664
the carpets
professionally cleaned.

48
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,299
Don't need to know how
the sausage is made, Colin!

49
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:17,704
Absolutely right, sir.

50
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:18,398
- Papa. Papa.
- Mmm-hmm.

51

<i>When swabbing fecal matter,</i>

52
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:06,912
<i>a nurse should take which
of the following precautions?</i>

53
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:08,446
- Bye, Mom!
- See ya, Mom!

54
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:10,415
All right, listen
to your grandma, okay?

55
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:11,350
Hi, Grandma!

56
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,117
And, hey, I want you
to take a bath, Olivia!

57
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,819
- Use soap.
- Okay.

58
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:15,888
You're not gonna
believe this.

59
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,456
Remember how I sang
that song from <i>Les Mis</i>

60
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,624
at the Saint James talent show

61
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:21,626
and everyone said
I was amazing?

62
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:23,595
Okay, Mom, can you just
type this up in an e-mail,

63
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:24,862
because I'm gonna be late
for my other job.

64
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:26,898
Turns out, a producer

65
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,802
from the Eugene Senior Theater
touring company was there.

66
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:32,371
He had tears.

67
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,905
Anyway, one of their leads
fell in the shower,

68
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:36,641
and they want me to step in.

69
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:38,710
What? When is this all
supposed to be happening?

70
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,746
I'm leaving tonight.
They're already in tech.

71
00:05:40,748 --> 00:05:43,715
No! Mom, my nursing exam
is in less than a month

72
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:44,883
and you agreed to help.

73
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:48,819
I'm 72. If I don't follow
my dreams now, when will I?

74
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:51,723
Never, Mom!

75
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:54,425
The whole reason we moved here
is so I could study more.

76
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:55,727
I already failed
the exam once.

77
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:56,727
No, don't guilt me.

78
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,162
You're not the only one
with a dead husband.

79
00:05:58,164 --> 00:06:01,465
Dad's not dead,
you're divorced!

80
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:03,768
Oh, and I'm gonna need you to take care of Fiona.

81
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,903
The kennel won't take her.
She has crate anxiety.

82
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:08,439
You can't possibly
be this selfish.

83
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:10,908
I'm sorry, honey, but the
theater is calling me.

84
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,013
Oh! Literally.
They need my dress size.

85
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:18,820
Hi, there. Normally a zero,
but a two if I'm bloated.

86
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,559
Good night.

87
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:29,830
Hey, don't stay up too late.

88
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,520
Oh, God.

89
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:06,030
Holy crap.

90
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:08,936
Here we are. I'll be
around if you need me.

91
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,847
<i>Guess where I am?</i>

92
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:23,614
Some dude's yacht.

93
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:24,749
You little tramp.

94
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:27,018
- I'm cleaning the carpets.
- Oh.

95
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,624
Oh, my God. Theresa,
look at this bathroom.

96
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,559
God, I could live in here!

97
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:33,924
Oh.

98
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:37,698
And they have candy.
Who has candy in the bathroom?

99
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:43,501
That's not candy.

100
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:45,069
<i>Yeah, because nobody has candy
in the bathroom.</i>

101
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:47,105
- Oh, God.
- <i>Because it's a bathroom!</i>

102
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:48,943
<i>Okay, come on, show me more.
Wait, wait, wait.</i>

103
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:51,710
Is that the guy?
Is he married? He's cute.

104
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:53,110
And that's not even
a very good picture.

105
00:07:53,112 --> 00:07:54,578
Hello, Theresa!

106
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,047
- Oh, God.
- Hi!

107
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:58,016
<i>By the way, she's single,
and horny.</i>

108
00:07:58,018 --> 00:07:59,850
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

109
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:01,285
I'll get out of here.

110
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:03,855
No, no, no. I should get up.
Busy day.

111
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:05,693
I've got a lot of...
Whew!

112
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:08,792
Really nothing to do.

113
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:11,566
Colin, I'm ready for
my Bloody Mary. Yeah.

114
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:14,001
Mostly Mary. Yeah.

115
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:22,006
Well, now you know.

116
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:24,708
I'm a grown man with
a tattoo on his butt.

117
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,744
Is that Speedy Gonzales?

118
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:28,879
Do you know another cartoon
mouse with a sombrero?

119
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:34,752
I hate the pussycat.

120
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,123
Let me guess, you were, uh, a
little tipsy when you got that?

121
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,625
Not at all.

122
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:43,127
I love Speedy.
He's fast, he's charming.

123
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:44,963
He's Mexican.

124
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:46,665
He outsmarts the pussycat

125
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:49,034
and brings delicious
cheese to his people.

126
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:51,506
And he's just fun to look at.

127
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:54,072
My name is Leonardo.

128
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:56,811
Kate. Sullivan.

129
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:02,079
You're very attractive
for a carpet cleaning lady.

130
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:03,180
Yeah.

131
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:06,851
Although you maybe could do
something with your hair.

132
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:08,019
Yeah...

133
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:10,955
No, well, no, that's not it.
It's your face.

134
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:13,190
Yeah. I mean, it's good.

135
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:16,093
I wanna like it,
it's just...

136
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:18,865
It's just somehow less than
the sum of its parts.

137
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:22,833
What animal do people
say you look like?

138
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:24,902
Apologies, sir, I thought
you were up and about already.

139
00:09:24,904 --> 00:09:26,905
Ah, finally.
It's about time.

140
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:31,809
Um, have Chef Gerard prepare
breakfast. Then, fire him.

141
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:34,145
Of course, but perhaps we could
give him a few weeks' notice.

142
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:35,679
His wife's expecting.

143
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:37,084
But his food is boring.

144
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:39,587
Absolutely.

145
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:45,223
There you are,
sleepyhead. Hi.

146
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:48,693
Well, this is awkward.
We're wearing the same thing.

147
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:56,233
Boop! Boop!

148
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:57,801
Lead the way, girls!

149
00:09:57,803 --> 00:09:59,036
Okay.

150
00:09:59,038 --> 00:10:00,905
Boop! Boop!

151
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,708
Boop!

152
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,914
Oh, try to hurry. I'm pretty
sure I'm gonna need the room.

153
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:14,051
- Excuse me, Captain?
- Yeah.

154
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:15,853
Checked the engine,
you're in luck.

155
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:18,122
It's just the anti-siphon
valve. No problem.

156
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:22,894
I was just telling him

157
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:25,929
that I was right,
and that he's a dumbass.

158
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:27,866
Say, how'd this dude
make all his money, anyway?

159
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:29,200
He didn't.

160
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:32,069
His family owns the largest building
supply company in the world.

161
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:33,907
Now this is what
he does all day.

162
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:37,876
Chicken fight?

163
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:10,834
All right. Here's my info.

164
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:12,303
If you're ever in Norway,
look me up.

165
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:14,072
The summers are insane.

166
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:17,074
That's happening, Oddvar.
That's definitely happening.

167
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:20,978
Hi. Excuse me, I was
told to clean in there.

168
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,847
Something about
a glitter bomb?

169
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:24,115
Is that gonna disturb you?

170
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:25,549
No, not at all.

171
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:28,553
Hmm. I'm craving something.
What is it?

172
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:31,222
Excuse me,
are you talking to me?

173
00:12:31,224 --> 00:12:34,092
Sweet, but not
too sweet. Hmm.

174
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:38,328
Is it mango? I'm pretty
sure it's mango.

175
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,000
No. No, wait, wait.
It's papaya.

176
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:43,333
Is it papaya?

177
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:45,270
I would have no way
of knowing that.

178
00:12:45,272 --> 00:12:47,972
Of course.

179
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,943
Could you be a doll
and get me a little of both?

180
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:51,876
Hmm?

181
00:12:51,878 --> 00:12:54,145
You know I was just hired
to do carpets, right?

182
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:56,981
I don't see why that should prevent
you from getting me a little snack.

183
00:12:56,983 --> 00:13:00,117
Don't you have, like, 10,000
other people to do that for you?

184
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,920
Yeah. But you're right here.

185
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:04,021
Okay, I'm sorry, but I really
have to finish up

186
00:13:04,023 --> 00:13:05,957
so I can pick my girls
up from school.

187
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,992
Shh.

188
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,333
Perhaps
you don't know who I am.

189
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:17,135
I know exactly who you are.

190
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:20,070
You showed me your ass and did
a number on my self-esteem.

191
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:22,040
Then why don't
I have my fruit?

192
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,208
Beats me.
But I'm not getting it.

193
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,843
Okay. Fair enough.

194
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:26,910
You're fired.

195
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:30,214
For not getting you a mango?

196
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:31,381
Or a papaya.

197
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:33,450
Okay, you know what?
That's fine.

198
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:35,889
Just pay me
and I'll be on my way.

199
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,626
I'm not paying you or the "We
Care Carpet and Fabric Company."

200
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:43,928
Dude, you have
a toilet in there

201
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,130
that costs more than
I make in a year.

202
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:49,333
You hired me to do a job.
I did it. You're paying me.

203
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:50,334
Nope.

204
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:53,070
Mr. Montenegro, ready
to ship out when you are.

205
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:55,809
Great! Push off.
The Pacific awaits.

206
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:57,978
Goodbye, Kate.

207
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:06,284
You are a horrible person.

208
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:08,185
<i>A first-class asshole!</i>

209
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:10,454
"A first-class asshole."

210
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:12,122
You're no charmer yourself.

211
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:14,492
Oh, whoa! That stung.

212
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:18,228
You selfish,
condescending prick!

213
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,367
I bet you haven't worked a single day
in your entire, self-absorbed life.

214
00:14:26,071 --> 00:14:29,140
And to think I was
this, this close,

215
00:14:29,142 --> 00:14:31,111
to inviting you to join
us in the Jacuzzi.

216
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:35,679
There isn't enough
penicillin in the world!

217
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:39,516
No, no, wait.
No, no, no.

218
00:14:39,518 --> 00:14:42,185
No. Don't untie the boat.

219
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:46,256
Excuse me, wait. Excuse me!
Captain! I'm still on board.

220
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:48,192
Don't leave yet!

221
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:53,397
Women adore me. I'm charming,
and fit, and disease-free.

222
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,198
Oh, grow up.

223
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,468
You are a vain,
empty little man,

224
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,437
who'd be nothing
without his daddy's money.

225
00:15:00,974 --> 00:15:02,372
Oh, no!

226
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:05,510
You gotta be kidding me!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait.

227
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:07,078
Better jump off.

228
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,415
No. No. I am not going
anywhere, until you,

229
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:14,084
or one of your butlers
or bimbos writes me a check.

230
00:15:14,086 --> 00:15:17,387
Fine. Next stop,
San Francisco.

231
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:20,894
Fine. I'll be a pain in your
ass for the next 12 hours.

232
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:25,530
I guess I didn't
think this through.

233
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:27,301
No, you didn't.

234
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,907
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

235
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:41,979
What the hell
is wrong with you?

236
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:43,448
Wait! My equipment.

237
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,919
Oh, of course.

238
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:47,117
Here you are.

239
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:50,190
No! No, no, no!
It's very expensive! No!

240
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:52,223
Oh!

241
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:55,359
Wait. I forgot something.
Your bucket.

242
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:57,063
- Fetch.
- No!

243
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:06,103
And just so you know,

244
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:09,073
my life is not empty!
Hmm?

245
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:13,077
Everyone wants my life
because it's meaningful.

246
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,415
I hate you!

247
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:17,084
Goodbye.

248
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,225
Oh, God.

249
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:33,197
And now I owe the cleaning company
$3,000 for a new machine!

250
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,433
And they fired me.
He is the devil.

251
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:37,168
Whoa, who's the devil?

252
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,503
- Leonardo Montenegro.
- Who's that?

253
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:42,506
Says here he's the son of the
third richest man in the world.

254
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:46,109
A Latino? Hell yeah.
<i>Mi gente,</i> babe, showin' up.

255
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:48,512
Hey! Those are for the crew,
right? Not their boss?

256
00:16:48,514 --> 00:16:50,415
What are you talking about,
babe? I lost eight pounds.

257
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,349
Pretty soon I'm gonna be
breaking out my skinny shirts.

258
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:59,056
I love when he dances.

259
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:00,391
Bring back the Hasselbeck.

260
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:02,093
You know what I got
in my bank account?

261
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:06,097
$42. I need to get
another job. Like, tonight.

262
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,298
Bobby, are you hiring?

263
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,201
Yeah, sure, if you can haul
giant bags of concrete all day.

264
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:13,136
We could probably scrape
together a few bucks for you.

265
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:16,473
Just Benny started college
and somebody bought a boat!

266
00:17:16,475 --> 00:17:18,242
Come on, babe,
we're gonna relitigate this?

267
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:20,278
I paid significantly
below market for that boat.

268
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,678
I had to buy it.
It was a steal.

269
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,548
Why am I even trying
to be a nurse?

270
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,383
I'm gonna be
delivering pizzas

271
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:27,251
and cleaning carpets
for the rest of my life.

272
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:29,156
Kate, don't say that.
Hey, look.

273
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:31,321
Have a garlic knot.

274
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:34,224
It makes everything just a
little bit better, I promise.

275
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:35,425
No, it doesn't.

276
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:37,031
No? I'll have one.

277
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,442
<i>Moretti
plays it back to midfield,</i>

278
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:53,176
<i>controlling the
pace as always.</i>

279
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:10,694
Oops.

280
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:12,696
Give me a second.
Don't turn of.

281
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,167
My condom drawer's empty.

282
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:18,536
I'll fix this.

283
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,672
<i>And the door was wide open,
but Magnusson hesitates...</i>

284
00:18:23,676 --> 00:18:25,309
I've told
the man repeatedly,

285
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:27,377
for the nine minutes
I am having my supper,

286
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:28,549
I am off the clock.

287
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:33,253
What am I paying
these people for?

288
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:35,653
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

289
00:19:03,949 --> 00:19:05,284
Please be here.

290
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:09,389
Damn it,
I'm relentless.

291
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:15,528
Hmm.

292
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,415
Yes!

293
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,451
Five!

294
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:53,167
Whoa!

295
00:19:58,571 --> 00:19:59,803
Help me, somebody!

296
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:02,272
Help me, please!

297
00:20:02,274 --> 00:20:04,311
Please, anyone, help!

298
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:06,810
Colin! Help!

299
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:08,748
- <i>Goal!</i>
- Yeah! Yeah!

300
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:13,186
Help me!

301
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:17,521
Help, Captain!

302
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:27,301
Help! Help, somebody!

303
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:21,254
Rough night, pal?

304
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:31,095
Hey!

305
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,337
I don't wanna get
your hopes up, ma'am,

306
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,571
but we might
have found him.

307
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:43,507
Like I told the officer,

308
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:46,676
I don't know what day it is.
I don't know where I was born.

309
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:49,446
I don't even know my own name.

310
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:51,581
I remember nothing
except waking up

311
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,550
on a beach with
an ass full of sand.

312
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:54,751
You're a doctor, right?

313
00:21:54,753 --> 00:21:56,389
Well, fix it.

314
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:58,325
And also...

315
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:02,428
Can I get a prettier nurse?

316
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:05,299
She is the pretty one.

317
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,505
<i>Probably caused by acute
trauma to the medial temporal lobe.</i>

318
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:18,776
Amnesia, really?
Is it permanent?

319
00:22:18,778 --> 00:22:21,145
Well, the brain
is a tricky thing.

320
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:23,380
He might get his memory back
in a couple of days

321
00:22:23,382 --> 00:22:25,383
or maybe never at all.

322
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,385
But to be honest,
we've only had

323
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,520
one case of amnesia
here in Elk Cove

324
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:32,923
and that was a pretty young
woman back in the '80s.

325
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:35,925
Fingers crossed,
this is your brother,

326
00:22:35,927 --> 00:22:38,695
but this is a beach town, we do
get our share of homeless here.

327
00:22:38,697 --> 00:22:41,464
So what happens if he's just some
poor guy living on the street?

328
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:44,769
Then he'll be shipped off to a
psychiatric facility up in Salem.

329
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:46,505
- Oh, my God.
- People get lost up there.

330
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:48,806
Here we are.

331
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:51,876
And he really
remembers nothing?

332
00:22:51,878 --> 00:22:53,278
Not a thing.

333
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,583
For the hundredth time,
I don't want chicken or beef.

334
00:22:57,617 --> 00:22:58,982
I want fish.

335
00:22:58,984 --> 00:23:02,822
A simple, grilled piece of sea bass.
With a buttery Chardonnay.

336
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,490
That's not my brother.

337
00:23:06,492 --> 00:23:08,626
Do it! Today!

338
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:10,194
What are you waiting for?

339
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,506
Oh, shit.

340
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,774
Shit! Ow.

341
00:23:22,908 --> 00:23:23,909
Shit!

342
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:25,876
Shit.

343
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:29,713
I got two weeks. I am having
a total anxiety attack.

344
00:23:29,715 --> 00:23:31,648
I can't make
those girls move again.

345
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,983
Okay, honey, hang on. I got
a half a Xanax in my purse.

346
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:35,653
We're gonna
figure this out.

347
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:37,355
Kate. Look at this.

348
00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:41,724
I was searching for a used lawnmower in
the <i>Beachcomber,</i> and look what I found.

349
00:23:41,726 --> 00:23:45,495
Amnesia. Right here
in our little town.

350
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:47,464
I told you this stuff happens
all the time.

351
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:49,032
Dude has no idea who he is.

352
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:50,469
Oh, my God.

353
00:23:51,536 --> 00:23:53,572
Oh, my God.
That's him.

354
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,941
That's the asshole!

355
00:23:56,943 --> 00:23:59,510
"An unidentified homeless man.

356
00:23:59,512 --> 00:24:02,245
"General retrograde amnesia.

357
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:03,981
"There was hope
a Mexico City woman

358
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:06,817
"yachting nearby
might be his sister, but..."

359
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:09,052
That was his sister.

360
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:10,253
Unbelievable.

361
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:11,789
I bet she's pretending
not to know him,

362
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,022
so she can take over
the company.

363
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:15,461
They did that on
<i>Amor sin Maquillaje.</i>

364
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:16,694
Okay.

365
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:18,695
We are going down
to the hospital right now

366
00:24:18,697 --> 00:24:19,963
and getting the money
he owes me.

367
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:21,999
And add a little
for pain and suffering, too.

368
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:25,502
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna add a lot.
He treated me like crap.

369
00:24:25,504 --> 00:24:26,803
Yeah, and I
need new cleats.

370
00:24:26,805 --> 00:24:28,505
We're all gonna
get new cleats!

371
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:29,574
Okay, wait.
Hey, Kate?

372
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:31,709
If he didn't pay you when
he knew who you were,

373
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:33,680
what makes you think
he's gonna pay you now?

374
00:24:35,947 --> 00:24:38,581
This is so frustrating!

375
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,885
I hate rich people.
They get away with everything.

376
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:42,752
But you know what?
No, not this time.

377
00:24:42,754 --> 00:24:45,655
Because I am not gonna
tell them who he is.

378
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:47,660
I am just gonna let him
rot in there.

379
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,860
Yeah, you could do that,

380
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:54,531
or you can be like them and take
advantage of the situation.

381
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:56,299
How? How could I do that?

382
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:01,475
What?

383
00:25:10,616 --> 00:25:11,949
State or federal?

384
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:14,117
All right, hey, girls. I'm
gonna need you to help your mom

385
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,586
dig up some old family photos.

386
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:18,688
I'm gonna ask Bobby to loan us a box
of his useless, skinny clothes,

387
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,058
because I have an idea
that you're gonna hate,

388
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,531
but you're wrong because
it is poetic in its justice.

389
00:25:26,831 --> 00:25:28,331
- Hi.
- Hi.

390
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:31,635
I'm here to pick up my
husband, the man with amnesia.

391
00:25:31,637 --> 00:25:33,570
Oh. You must be Kate?

392
00:25:33,572 --> 00:25:36,040
Dr. Fletcher was so excited
to get your call.

393
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:37,042
We all were.

394
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:38,945
I'll go get him.

395
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:43,646
Almost forgot. Here's
everything he had with him.

396
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:44,650
Thank you.

397
00:25:54,627 --> 00:25:56,659
Wait, okay,
you're just nervous.

398
00:25:56,661 --> 00:25:57,794
Yeah, really nervous.

399
00:25:57,796 --> 00:26:00,030
This is crazy
and probably illegal.

400
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:04,033
Kate, come on.
Where are you going?

401
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:06,069
Look, do you wanna get evicted?

402
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:07,305
Of course not.

403
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:10,074
Okay, well, then stick to the script.
We have a plan.

404
00:26:10,076 --> 00:26:12,876
One month until the test.
Bobby will hire him,

405
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:15,613
and he'll be an extra paycheck,
so you have time to study.

406
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,816
I barely know the guy.
I am not gonna let him move in.

407
00:26:18,818 --> 00:26:20,850
But you're gonna
be there, studying.

408
00:26:20,852 --> 00:26:21,819
That's why it's genius.

409
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,686
He'll never have to be
alone with the kids.

410
00:26:23,688 --> 00:26:24,754
Come on.

411
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:26,659
You're doing this
for your girls.

412
00:26:27,926 --> 00:26:29,827
I'm doing this for my girls.

413
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:30,794
There you go.

414
00:26:30,796 --> 00:26:33,732
Okay, here, use this.
Bobby won't even notice.

415
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:36,899
Good news.

416
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:39,802
Your wife has come
to take you home.

417
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:42,841
Finally.
It's about time.

418
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:46,079
What? Wait.

419
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,080
I'm married?

420
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:52,585
Hi, honey.

421
00:26:56,421 --> 00:26:58,891
I do not recognize this lady.

422
00:27:00,693 --> 00:27:02,192
I was afraid
this would happen.

423
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:04,998
Did you bring the materials
we talked about?

424
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:09,966
I know this must be
very disorienting,

425
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:12,138
but here's our
marriage license.

426
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,007
My name is Leo Sullivan?

427
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,842
Yes. Your great-grandfather...

428
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:24,013
Your great-great-grandfather,
Finbar Sullivan,

429
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:30,721
emigrated from Ireland, to fight
for Mexico in the war of 1846.

430
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:36,061
That's gobbledygook!
It can't be true.

431
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:42,165
Honey, we have been
married for 15 years.

432
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,702
We have three
wonderful daughters.

433
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,937
No, there's no way
I have children.

434
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:49,740
And if I did,
they'd be sons.

435
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:51,140
I'm just saying.

436
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:55,781
I have your passport,
your birth certificate...

437
00:27:56,115 --> 00:27:57,947
Oh...

438
00:27:57,949 --> 00:28:00,317
Here's a photo
from our honeymoon.

439
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,921
We went to Reno?

440
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:04,788
Now I know you're lying.

441
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,090
Leo! Sweetie,
stop puzzling.

442
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:07,959
I'm puzzling.

443
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:12,029
You and I are
Mr. and Mrs. Leo Sullivan.

444
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:13,667
We met in Cancun.

445
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,933
You were a tour guide.

446
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:18,268
I was working
on a cruise ship.

447
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,337
Is any of this
ringing a bell?

448
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:22,306
Nope. Nothing.

449
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:24,907
We dated
every time I docked.

450
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:26,944
We would get
frozen yogurt

451
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:29,847
and watch the sunset
over the Playa Tortugas.

452
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:31,781
That's where
we fell in love.

453
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:33,884
Sounds like you're
a romantic, Leo.

454
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:35,219
Look, look, look.

455
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:38,088
I admit there are many things
I've forgotten,

456
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,190
but from the depths
of my soul,

457
00:28:40,192 --> 00:28:42,091
I know I'm not married
to this woman.

458
00:28:42,093 --> 00:28:45,863
So, unless I see
some real proof,

459
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:48,301
I'm getting a slice
of pie at the cafeteria, hmm?

460
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:51,870
Good luck, crazy lady.

461
00:28:52,804 --> 00:28:55,305
Wait, wait. Wait. Honey?

462
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:58,142
I didn't wanna say this,

463
00:28:58,144 --> 00:29:00,144
because I know
it embarrasses you.

464
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:04,984
But you have a tattoo of a cartoon
mouse on your right butt cheek.

465
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:06,785
No, I don't.

466
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,196
You're really my wife?

467
00:29:20,198 --> 00:29:22,301
For better or worse, baby.

468
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:53,163
All right, here we are.

469
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:57,203
I know it doesn't look like
much, but it's full of love.

470
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:08,180
I'm poor?

471
00:30:08,414 --> 00:30:09,782
Yup.

472
00:30:15,186 --> 00:30:16,790
Come on in.

473
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,357
Oh, Dad!

474
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,126
- Daddy!
- We missed you so much.

475
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,199
I'm so glad you're okay.

476
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:31,467
Emily?

477
00:30:31,469 --> 00:30:32,869
Hey.

478
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:34,937
She's too cool to admit it,

479
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:38,075
but she was
the most worried of all.

480
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:41,848
I'm sorry, I
don't recognize any of you.

481
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:44,146
Oh, come on.

482
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:48,085
Molly, Olivia, Emily,

483
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:50,023
your three musketeers?

484
00:30:51,055 --> 00:30:52,088
No.

485
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,894
Uh... I've got homework.

486
00:31:01,032 --> 00:31:02,366
How come they don't
look like me?

487
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:04,100
Oh, sweetie...

488
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:06,002
We had trouble
getting pregnant,

489
00:31:06,004 --> 00:31:07,974
so we had to use
a sperm donor.

490
00:31:09,274 --> 00:31:10,440
I'm sterile?

491
00:31:10,442 --> 00:31:12,442
That doesn't change a thing.

492
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:14,278
You are still their father.

493
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,380
You've done everything
for this family.

494
00:31:17,382 --> 00:31:20,986
Taken two, even three jobs.

495
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:22,220
I work?

496
00:31:22,222 --> 00:31:24,387
How do you think
we can pay for all of this?

497
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:28,258
I'm afraid to ask, but
what do I do for a living?

498
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
Well, before
you got laid off,

499
00:31:30,262 --> 00:31:32,296
you were a foreman at
the poultry processing plant.

500
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:33,963
Luckily, Bobby,

501
00:31:33,965 --> 00:31:36,265
my boss's husband,
you met bowling,

502
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:38,935
gave you a job
at his construction company.

503
00:31:38,937 --> 00:31:42,271
It is awful, backbreaking
work, I know,

504
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:44,107
but we are lucky
to have it.

505
00:31:45,977 --> 00:31:49,014
I need a drink.
Lots of them.

506
00:31:52,384 --> 00:31:55,152
What? Please don't tell me I'm sober?

507
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:57,087
You had your three-year chip,

508
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:58,355
but then you relapsed

509
00:31:58,357 --> 00:32:01,457
and you ended up on that beach.

510
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:06,128
So what is that? Four days?
You got four days, honey.

511
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,267
- We're still really proud of you.
- Mm-hmm.

512
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:10,334
I see.

513
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:13,039
No alcohol. Whatsoever.

514
00:32:13,371 --> 00:32:15,271
<i>Nada.</i>

515
00:32:15,273 --> 00:32:17,441
I need to use the restroom.

516
00:32:17,443 --> 00:32:20,476
I assume it's that room
over there with the toilet.

517
00:32:20,478 --> 00:32:23,746
Look at you, babe.
It's all coming back!

518
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:27,119
Boop.

519
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:29,586
I don't like that.

520
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:32,990
One more.

521
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,494
Boop, boop!

522
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:51,311
This can't be my life.

523
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:14,967
Honey!

524
00:33:17,636 --> 00:33:19,504
- Hey!
- Hi.

525
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:23,075
Running low on toilet paper.

526
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:25,474
Under the sink!

527
00:33:25,476 --> 00:33:26,579
Of course.

528
00:33:29,348 --> 00:33:31,114
Yes.

529
00:33:31,116 --> 00:33:33,386
Under the sink,
of course.

530
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:43,393
Please keep my beloved brother
in your prayers

531
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:44,627
as you head back to Mexico.

532
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:47,396
I'm going to stay here
until I find him.

533
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:49,401
Alive or...

534
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:57,510
Good thoughts, people.
Only good thoughts.

535
00:34:04,515 --> 00:34:06,450
I was fat?

536
00:34:06,452 --> 00:34:11,554
Um, yeah. You didn't make the best
decisions when you were drinking, honey.

537
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:13,255
Tomorrow
we're going to Goodwill.

538
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:14,657
Bobby's skinny clothes
are not skinny.

539
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,393
I assume these Seahawks
are some kind of sports team

540
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:19,128
and I'm a big fan,

541
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,396
because most of my clothes

542
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:22,699
have this God-awful
green and blue bird on it.

543
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:25,501
Football, Dad.
It's our thing.

544
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:27,570
We watch every game together.

545
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:29,438
Even when I haven't
done my homework.

546
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,007
Hey. Everyone does
their homework.

547
00:34:31,009 --> 00:34:35,277
Including me. And right now I've gotta
memorize protocols for thoracic surgery.

548
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:38,181
So, Leo, why don't you get
dinner started?

549
00:34:38,183 --> 00:34:41,518
What? Cook? Me? Cook?

550
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,520
Sweetheart, I know
you had a head injury,

551
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:46,558
but we made a deal.

552
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:49,592
While I'm studying for my exam,

553
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:52,329
you keep the house running.

554
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:55,132
But I don't even know
how to turn on the stove.

555
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,467
Oh! Honey, come on.

556
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:01,473
Salad, pasta. There's a jar
of sauce in the fridge.

557
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:07,677
Holy cow.

558
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,215
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
uh, pardon me.

559
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,124
Nothing like an icy cold beer
on a warm day.

560
00:35:19,357 --> 00:35:20,659
Mmm, mmm.

561
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:25,098
Yes.

562
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:52,221
Ugh!

563
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:53,790
Is this the sauce
we always use?

564
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:56,726
It tastes like red nothing.

565
00:35:56,728 --> 00:35:59,563
And how are you supposed to tell
when the noodles are done?

566
00:35:59,565 --> 00:36:00,566
Taste one.

567
00:36:10,641 --> 00:36:12,544
Mmm. Mmm.

568
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,415
Hot, hot, hot!

569
00:36:24,288 --> 00:36:25,822
When's the maid coming?

570
00:36:25,824 --> 00:36:28,628
As I'm saying this,
I fear I'm the maid.

571
00:36:30,328 --> 00:36:32,430
No one cleans
like you do, sweetie.

572
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:39,603
This is awesome.

573
00:36:39,605 --> 00:36:41,003
Honey?

574
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:44,409
Try not to dilly dally.
We're all super hungry.

575
00:36:46,612 --> 00:36:48,712
I like having a dad around.

576
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:51,014
He's not your dad, genius.

577
00:36:51,016 --> 00:36:53,349
You agreed to have
a good attitude.

578
00:36:53,351 --> 00:36:55,719
And I'll have a great attitude
if you let him babysit,

579
00:36:55,721 --> 00:36:58,587
so I'm not stuck here watching
these guys all the time.

580
00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:01,257
We went over this.
I don't want him to babysit.

581
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:03,592
Why does he only get
to do your chores?

582
00:37:03,594 --> 00:37:06,563
I wanna go to the pool like
every other kid in my class.

583
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:08,665
I don't care!
He's not babysitting.

584
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:09,735
'Cause you think
he's a pervert?

585
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:12,501
Of course not!

586
00:37:12,503 --> 00:37:13,837
What's a pervert?

587
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,273
- Nothing.
- Then can I have one?

588
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,744
No! He's not babysitting.
End of story.

589
00:37:20,612 --> 00:37:21,811
Good night.

590
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:24,250
I never get anything.

591
00:37:27,752 --> 00:37:31,323
So, is this where
the magic happens?

592
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:35,625
You don't even remember
who I am,

593
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:37,496
and you still wanna
have sex with me?

594
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:40,499
Yes. Very much.

595
00:37:41,732 --> 00:37:43,532
So, basically,

596
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:46,335
you wanna have sex
with a complete stranger?

597
00:37:46,337 --> 00:37:48,471
Yes. Very much.

598
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:50,407
All right, big boy.

599
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:51,544
You know the rules.

600
00:37:53,578 --> 00:37:55,848
What? Hey, wait, wait, wait.

601
00:37:56,915 --> 00:37:58,451
I'm not sleeping with you?

602
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,750
You need 30 days
clean and sober.

603
00:38:01,752 --> 00:38:05,390
You and your sponsor came up with that.
It was your idea, not mine.

604
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:08,558
What are you saying?

605
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,328
- Boop!
- You're gonna make me sleep on the couch?

606
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,795
Nope. We tried that last time

607
00:38:12,797 --> 00:38:14,898
and you ended up
in the liquor cabinet.

608
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:19,605
So, where am I sleeping?

609
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:23,275
Here you go.

610
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:25,811
You have a cot and everything.

611
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:28,811
All right,

612
00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:31,848
so I'm gonna lock up
the house for the night.

613
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,420
If you need to use the bathroom,

614
00:38:35,721 --> 00:38:36,822
here you go.

615
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,458
I'm a nobody.

616
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:45,494
A poor, sterile, drunk nobody,

617
00:38:45,496 --> 00:38:47,364
who has to pee in a bottle.

618
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,532
But you're my nobody.

619
00:38:49,534 --> 00:38:53,136
All right, Bobby's picking you up
in the morning, bright and early.

620
00:38:53,138 --> 00:38:55,838
So you need to get
some rest, okay?

621
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,444
Oh, and watch out for bears.

622
00:39:53,697 --> 00:39:55,935
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

623
00:39:59,036 --> 00:40:00,770
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you.

624
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:02,739
Yeah, don't spill on it.

625
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:04,643
It's a classic and everything.

626
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:07,846
Seriously, they're hard to find.

627
00:40:13,784 --> 00:40:15,451
<i>Okay, everybody.</i>

628
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:16,652
This is Leo.

629
00:40:16,654 --> 00:40:18,654
Burro. Burrito.

630
00:40:18,656 --> 00:40:20,690
Vito, because he loves
<i>The Godfather.</i>

631
00:40:20,692 --> 00:40:22,058
This is my worthless nephew,
Jason.

632
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,828
We call him Lucky, because
he's lucky to have a job.

633
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,764
And 'cause I got hit by
lightning. Twice. For real.

634
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:28,965
I shouldn't even be here.

635
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:30,967
Yeah. Gordo was like,
"Whoa, shit!"

636
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:33,670
Bro, you don't get
to call me that, okay?

637
00:40:33,672 --> 00:40:35,971
And don't be so cocky.
I used to look just like you.

638
00:40:35,973 --> 00:40:38,574
The hair, the abs,
the little bedroom eyes.

639
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:40,643
You definitely don't
get to call me that.

640
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:42,715
You gotta work for me at least six months, okay?

641
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,530
Come on, we got
a pool to dig. Let's go.

642
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:03,969
Hey.

643
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:09,873
Listen, I'm pretty sure
I've never worked construction.

644
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:13,610
So, I might be more suited
for running errands,

645
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:15,612
or maybe
some light office work.

646
00:41:15,614 --> 00:41:17,579
I could be the guy
who gets the muffins.

647
00:41:17,581 --> 00:41:18,982
Look, I got your back,
all right?

648
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:21,284
- I'll go easy on you.
- Good.

649
00:41:21,286 --> 00:41:22,688
Great.

650
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:31,960
Yo!

651
00:41:31,962 --> 00:41:33,965
Any of this jogging your memory,
Lady Hands?

652
00:41:37,735 --> 00:41:39,969
After this I got
a real easy job for you.

653
00:41:39,971 --> 00:41:41,737
No, I'm just kidding, bro.

654
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,926
Uh...

655
00:42:13,837 --> 00:42:15,640
No, no, no.

656
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:56,645
- Coffee.
- Yes.

657
00:42:56,647 --> 00:42:57,880
Thank you.

658
00:42:57,882 --> 00:42:58,884
You're welcome.

659
00:42:59,683 --> 00:43:00,817
Look at this guy.

660
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:03,753
He's got it all dialed in,
with his espresso machine

661
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:05,124
and that sweet little peach.

662
00:43:06,123 --> 00:43:08,690
That's gonna be me one day.

663
00:43:08,692 --> 00:43:10,628
You can come over
whenever you want, bro.

664
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:15,230
Hey, guys?

665
00:43:15,232 --> 00:43:18,967
Can I get you to haul the dirt
on the other side of the house?

666
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:20,402
I know it's longer,

667
00:43:20,404 --> 00:43:22,607
but Nadia and I are trying to have a quiet morning.

668
00:43:24,174 --> 00:43:26,208
- Right.
- No speak English.

669
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,978
Sorry.
I will talk to Bobby.

670
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,982
<i>Si.</i> Bobby.

671
00:43:33,183 --> 00:43:34,719
I love doing that.

672
00:44:35,746 --> 00:44:39,248
Remember, when you're
washing the jersey, cold water.

673
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,154
You listen.
Gentle cycle. Okay?

674
00:44:43,922 --> 00:44:45,954
<i>Bueno.</i>

675
00:44:45,956 --> 00:44:48,858
Hey, respecting
the wash instructions

676
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,793
is the best way
to respect the team.

677
00:44:51,795 --> 00:44:53,665
And no reds, they tend to bleed!

678
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:02,941
Tortured, tired, thirsty.

679
00:45:05,342 --> 00:45:08,777
Hi, honey!
How was your first day?

680
00:45:08,779 --> 00:45:10,248
Terrible. My body.

681
00:45:11,215 --> 00:45:15,083
Pain. Every. Part.

682
00:45:15,085 --> 00:45:16,786
Oh.

683
00:45:16,788 --> 00:45:18,286
I was in the car...

684
00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:24,893
And I said, "What?"

685
00:45:24,895 --> 00:45:26,195
Do we need to take him
to the hospital?

686
00:45:26,197 --> 00:45:27,963
- I said, "Bobby..."
- No, no, no. No.

687
00:45:27,965 --> 00:45:30,333
He is fine.
He just needs some rest.

688
00:45:30,335 --> 00:45:32,300
Rest. Rest.

689
00:45:32,302 --> 00:45:34,003
Oh, that's right.

690
00:45:34,005 --> 00:45:36,105
Dirt is...

691
00:45:36,107 --> 00:45:38,206
You know what? Why don't you
take a few minutes,

692
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:41,045
before you get started on all the
things you have to do tonight?

693
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:45,114
What? There's more?

694
00:45:45,116 --> 00:45:48,016
I know you're
having trouble remembering,

695
00:45:48,018 --> 00:45:49,951
so I made you a list.

696
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:51,087
No, no, no.

697
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:54,857
It's physically impossible
for me to get off this couch.

698
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:57,125
I mean, my legs are
no longer functioning.

699
00:45:57,127 --> 00:45:59,061
Look. Look.

700
00:45:59,063 --> 00:46:01,266
I want, but I can't.

701
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,168
And even if I could move...

702
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,974
I wouldn't want to do any of
the vile things on this list.

703
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:12,944
There's a couple more
on the back, too.

704
00:46:33,831 --> 00:46:36,165
I know that guy.
How do I know that guy?

705
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:38,337
Hey. Do you work
at Jiffy Lube?

706
00:46:40,304 --> 00:46:41,973
God, I hope not.

707
00:46:43,907 --> 00:46:45,877
This is gonna drive me crazy.

708
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:12,235
Is this new sauce?
It tastes different.

709
00:47:12,237 --> 00:47:15,204
Yeah.
I added a few things.

710
00:47:15,206 --> 00:47:18,306
Some chopped onion,
a little red pepper

711
00:47:18,308 --> 00:47:20,942
and a pinch of something
called cumin.

712
00:47:20,944 --> 00:47:24,913
I couldn't bear another bowl
of that tasteless slop.

713
00:47:24,915 --> 00:47:26,818
I like it.
I like it a lot.

714
00:47:27,217 --> 00:47:28,319
It's better, right?

715
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:29,920
I don't know.

716
00:47:29,922 --> 00:47:32,221
I feel like we've been
having pasta too much.

717
00:47:32,223 --> 00:47:34,322
Maybe you should
mix it up a little.

718
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:38,059
Okay, I'm gonna take
mine up to study.

719
00:47:38,061 --> 00:47:41,366
Hey, after you clean the kitchen,
don't forget, it's garbage day.

720
00:47:48,038 --> 00:47:51,243
It's entirely clear to me now why
I blocked out my life, Fiona.

721
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,413
It's a hideous existence.

722
00:47:58,415 --> 00:48:00,315
Good night, you guys.
I love you.

723
00:48:00,317 --> 00:48:01,853
- Good night, Mom.
- Love you.

724
00:48:06,523 --> 00:48:09,925
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
Aren't you exhausted?

725
00:48:09,927 --> 00:48:12,364
Who would use exhaustion
as an excuse to not make love?

726
00:48:14,098 --> 00:48:15,297
Everybody.

727
00:48:16,335 --> 00:48:21,170
To the shed. I know. I know.
It's hard for me, too.

728
00:48:21,172 --> 00:48:22,374
Nice work today.

729
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,427
Turn it off! Turn it off!

730
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,965
Turn it off!

731
00:48:51,735 --> 00:48:54,036
Yo, I'm
gonna post this on my Snapchat.

732
00:48:54,038 --> 00:48:56,005
I'm gonna make you
a little beaver, bro.

733
00:48:56,007 --> 00:48:57,739
How come we always
get the shit jobs?

734
00:48:57,741 --> 00:48:59,741
Because you're unskilled laborers!

735
00:48:59,743 --> 00:49:02,043
Land of the free,
no land of the free lunch.

736
00:49:08,152 --> 00:49:11,119
Okay. You are a genius.

737
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:13,054
I got seven hours
of sleep last night,

738
00:49:13,056 --> 00:49:15,458
and guess what
he's making for dinner?

739
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,059
Chicken skewers, coconut rice.

740
00:49:18,061 --> 00:49:20,462
Aw, I want a fake husband.

741
00:49:20,464 --> 00:49:22,364
Thank you. Thank you.

742
00:49:22,366 --> 00:49:25,166
I got more studying done this
week than I have in months.

743
00:49:25,168 --> 00:49:26,501
Maybe next time I ask you
to commit a crime,

744
00:49:26,503 --> 00:49:28,040
you won't fight me on it.

745
00:50:58,862 --> 00:51:00,563
Bro,
you're lucky you have amnesia.

746
00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:02,098
I remember when I thought
my nephew

747
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,498
was actually gonna
do something with his life.

748
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,203
Music is something. I'm an artist.

749
00:51:06,337 --> 00:51:07,536
You're sleeping
on my couch, bro.

750
00:51:07,538 --> 00:51:08,436
Yeah, well,
that tune's gonna change

751
00:51:08,438 --> 00:51:10,438
when I thank you
at the Grammys, Gordo.

752
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,540
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

753
00:51:11,542 --> 00:51:14,143
You better pick it up, dawg.
You know what I'm saying?

754
00:51:14,145 --> 00:51:16,679
'Cause the Diaz metabolism
slows down around 30.

755
00:51:16,681 --> 00:51:17,880
See this right here?

756
00:51:17,882 --> 00:51:21,583
It's not gonna get you on the charts, dawg.

757
00:51:21,585 --> 00:51:22,751
I got some work
I don't feel like doing.

758
00:51:22,753 --> 00:51:24,089
Why do you even wear that hard hat, man?

759
00:52:13,603 --> 00:52:15,439
"Act like a man."

760
00:52:21,612 --> 00:52:22,714
Act like a man.

761
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,456
Act like a man!

762
00:52:38,596 --> 00:52:40,728
- See you tomorrow, Bobby.
- Okay, brother.

763
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,534
Hey, remember, don't tell
Theresa about the chicken parm.

764
00:53:01,786 --> 00:53:03,155
Hey.

765
00:53:03,654 --> 00:53:05,320
Hey.

766
00:53:05,322 --> 00:53:06,625
I got you something.

767
00:53:07,424 --> 00:53:08,560
Frozen yogurt.

768
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,261
Like the old days on the Playa.

769
00:53:12,263 --> 00:53:14,266
- What?
- On the Playa Tortugas.

770
00:53:15,732 --> 00:53:17,433
Oh, oh.

771
00:53:17,435 --> 00:53:20,402
Right. Yeah, the sunsets.

772
00:53:20,404 --> 00:53:23,404
- Yeah.
- Yes. Good times.

773
00:53:23,406 --> 00:53:26,007
I couldn't remember
which flavors we liked,

774
00:53:26,009 --> 00:53:27,842
so I got an assortment.

775
00:53:27,844 --> 00:53:30,214
Thanks. This was

776
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:32,748
really nice of you.

777
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,288
I know I haven't been the
easiest to live with lately,

778
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:40,456
but I'm gonna try
a little harder.

779
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:44,729
I can't promise a lot harder,
but maybe I'll surprise myself.

780
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:48,566
Well, keep doing this.

781
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:52,337
Maybe next time,
bring some toppings.

782
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:56,337
Mmm.

783
00:53:56,339 --> 00:53:58,342
Mango. I love mango.

784
00:53:59,377 --> 00:54:00,579
Have I always loved mango?

785
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:03,746
As long as I've known you.

786
00:54:03,748 --> 00:54:05,217
Ah, yes.

787
00:54:07,284 --> 00:54:08,750
When we were young

788
00:54:08,752 --> 00:54:10,821
and couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

789
00:54:17,828 --> 00:54:19,360
No.

790
00:54:19,362 --> 00:54:20,496
Okay.

791
00:54:20,498 --> 00:54:23,699
Well... I'll be in my shed.

792
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:25,403
Trying to have a good attitude.

793
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:27,638
Just me and the spiders.

794
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:29,473
Oh.

795
00:54:31,074 --> 00:54:32,476
Forgot my bathroom.

796
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,250
Whew. Whew!

797
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:26,494
I'm calling to get a death
certificate for Leonardo Montenegro.

798
00:55:26,496 --> 00:55:28,832
He died a couple of weeks ago
in a shark attack.

799
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:34,570
Yes. An attack by a shark fish?

800
00:55:34,572 --> 00:55:36,371
I think I'm saying
that correctly.

801
00:55:49,886 --> 00:55:51,622
Montenegro.

802
00:55:57,862 --> 00:55:58,897
Burro.

803
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:00,632
Burrito.

804
00:56:08,973 --> 00:56:10,342
Hey! Hey!

805
00:56:22,853 --> 00:56:24,786
- Thanks, Bobby.
- You got it, bro.

806
00:56:26,456 --> 00:56:27,655
- All right.
- Hey!

807
00:56:27,657 --> 00:56:28,857
- Hey!
- Hey, sweetie!

808
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:29,860
<i>Bueno.</i>

809
00:56:30,694 --> 00:56:32,628
Oi, remember Hasselbeck.

810
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:35,367
He's way more mobile
than people give him credit for.

811
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,733
Hey.

812
00:56:38,735 --> 00:56:42,440
- Why aren't you riding?
- It's no fun with training wheels.

813
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:46,775
I never taught you
to ride a bike?

814
00:56:46,777 --> 00:56:49,777
It's okay. Some dads
can't be around that much.

815
00:56:49,779 --> 00:56:51,382
No, it's not okay.

816
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:55,650
I'm gonna fix this. Right now.

817
00:56:55,652 --> 00:56:57,388
Let me just put this away. Okay?

818
00:56:59,556 --> 00:57:01,456
What are you doing here?

819
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:03,625
They got us working bankers'
hours today.

820
00:57:03,627 --> 00:57:04,793
Whatever those are.

821
00:57:04,795 --> 00:57:07,996
So then it's cool if you
watch those guys,

822
00:57:07,998 --> 00:57:09,797
so I can go to the pool?

823
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:11,535
Yeah, sure. Why not?

824
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,970
Thanks, Dad.

825
00:57:14,638 --> 00:57:16,838
- Hey, Mom.
- <i>You're gonna be blown away.</i>

826
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:21,509
<i>Modern Senior</i> magazine said
my performance stole the show.

827
00:57:21,511 --> 00:57:24,846
And the Saint Jude wellness
newsletter featured me on the cover.

828
00:57:24,848 --> 00:57:27,916
That certainly justifies
leaving me without childcare.

829
00:57:27,918 --> 00:57:29,083
Life's short, Kate.

830
00:57:29,085 --> 00:57:30,918
You gotta do
what makes you happy.

831
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,119
<i>I don't wanna have regrets</i>

832
00:57:32,121 --> 00:57:34,690
<i>just because I didn't do
what I wanted to do.</i>

833
00:57:34,692 --> 00:57:35,991
<i>You'll understand
someday, honey.</i>

834
00:57:35,993 --> 00:57:37,793
Shit! I gotta go, Mom.

835
00:57:37,795 --> 00:57:39,561
Everyone's looking.

836
00:57:39,563 --> 00:57:40,661
I don't care!

837
00:57:40,663 --> 00:57:44,967
I asked you for one month,
just watch your sisters.

838
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:47,703
And we don't even know anything about this guy.

839
00:57:47,705 --> 00:57:50,005
Whose fault is that? I didn't
bring him into the house.

840
00:57:50,007 --> 00:57:51,639
That's not the point.

841
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:53,645
And I'll tell you why
in two minutes.

842
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:02,750
We're not done
talking about this!

843
00:58:02,752 --> 00:58:05,286
And because of you,
their pizza was cold

844
00:58:05,288 --> 00:58:07,088
and they gave me a lousy tip.

845
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:10,060
Maybe you got a bad tip
because you run like a duck.

846
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:13,661
You better hope
everything's okay.

847
00:58:13,663 --> 00:58:17,032
I hate this. I hate this
whole thing. It's so stupid.

848
00:58:21,005 --> 00:58:22,871
I love the Seahawks!

849
00:58:22,873 --> 00:58:25,840
Our team just ran the ball
to the finish line.

850
00:58:25,842 --> 00:58:27,009
The end zone.
We've been over this.

851
00:58:27,011 --> 00:58:29,645
Oh, right. Touchdown.

852
00:58:29,647 --> 00:58:31,079
It's coming back slowly.

853
00:58:31,081 --> 00:58:34,849
See, Mom, everything's fine.
No one died.

854
00:58:34,851 --> 00:58:38,755
Oh, and, Kate, I got some of the guys
to help me fix that leak in the roof.

855
00:58:39,723 --> 00:58:41,623
And you unpacked the boxes?

856
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:44,726
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And I found these pillows.

857
00:58:44,728 --> 00:58:46,828
The couch needed
a splash of color.

858
00:58:48,766 --> 00:58:49,931
What?

859
00:58:49,933 --> 00:58:53,537
"Little by little, the bird
builds its nest." It's French.

860
00:58:54,038 --> 00:58:56,040
Wait. I speak French.

861
00:58:57,174 --> 00:58:58,643
Why do I speak French?

862
00:58:59,877 --> 00:59:01,043
Uh...

863
00:59:01,045 --> 00:59:04,712
Well, you were a tour guide,

864
00:59:04,714 --> 00:59:08,717
and it's well-known
that Parisians love Cancun.

865
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:12,991
For it's chips and salsa
and its flamenco dancers.

866
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:17,826
Thanks for humiliating me
for nothing.

867
00:59:17,828 --> 00:59:21,896
Hey! Hey, we had a deal,
and you didn't stick to it.

868
00:59:21,898 --> 00:59:22,898
You're grounded.

869
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,168
Who cares? I'm basically
a prisoner here anyway!

870
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,673
- For a week!
- Kate, Kate, Kate. Hey.

871
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:31,706
Can I talk to you for a sec?

872
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:35,045
Okay, listen, you remember
what it's like to be 13.

873
00:59:36,045 --> 00:59:38,646
I don't, but you probably do.

874
00:59:38,648 --> 00:59:40,047
What are you getting at?

875
00:59:40,049 --> 00:59:41,717
And no phone!

876
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:44,686
Hey, hey, I just think
maybe you're being...

877
00:59:44,688 --> 00:59:46,822
I don't know,
a little hard on her.

878
00:59:46,824 --> 00:59:48,924
Don't tell me how
to raise my kids.

879
00:59:48,926 --> 00:59:50,929
"Your kids"?

880
00:59:51,661 --> 00:59:52,893
"Your kids"?

881
00:59:52,895 --> 00:59:54,029
Hey. Listen.

882
00:59:54,031 --> 00:59:57,632
Just because those girls
were not conceived with my seed,

883
00:59:57,634 --> 01:00:00,034
doesn't make me any less
their father or a man.

884
01:00:00,036 --> 01:00:01,103
Of course not. I just...

885
01:00:01,105 --> 01:00:03,070
I'm not done.

886
01:00:03,072 --> 01:00:06,775
All I do is work and work
and slave for this family.

887
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:08,909
I may not have put us
in the lap of luxury,

888
01:00:08,911 --> 01:00:10,581
but I'm a provider.

889
01:00:11,181 --> 01:00:13,849
What you said was a low blow.

890
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:18,085
An unfair and hurtful low blow.

891
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:20,991
- Honey, I...
- Low blow.

892
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:23,724
I need some air.

893
01:00:25,228 --> 01:00:26,630
Leo!

894
01:00:29,232 --> 01:00:30,831
Right after I check the score.

895
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:33,103
<i>And it is good!</i>

896
01:00:34,904 --> 01:00:37,672
- We lost.
- <i>A stunning win for Arizona.</i>

897
01:00:37,674 --> 01:00:38,875
I hope you're happy.

898
01:00:40,009 --> 01:00:42,744
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

899
01:00:42,746 --> 01:00:44,813
And not because
I don't remember, hmm?

900
01:00:44,815 --> 01:00:46,884
Because I don't know.

901
01:00:52,956 --> 01:00:55,257
My name is Leo
and I'm an alcoholic.

902
01:00:55,259 --> 01:00:57,025
Hi, Leo.

903
01:00:57,027 --> 01:00:59,895
To be honest, I don't really
remember my drinking days.

904
01:00:59,897 --> 01:01:01,762
- Yep.
- Been there.

905
01:01:01,764 --> 01:01:04,733
I got in a fight
with my wife tonight.

906
01:01:04,735 --> 01:01:07,772
I stood outside a bar
for 20 minutes.

907
01:01:09,272 --> 01:01:12,776
I came this close. This...

908
01:01:15,813 --> 01:01:17,145
But here I am.

909
01:01:17,147 --> 01:01:19,915
- Keep coming back.
- One day at a time.

910
01:01:19,917 --> 01:01:23,784
<i>♪ Bloody stools

Holy shit!

913
01:01:36,032 --> 01:01:38,933
Leonardo Montenegro.

914
01:01:38,935 --> 01:01:42,337
Yeah, he was murdered by a shark in
your district several weeks ago.

915
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:43,471
<i>Sorry, ma'am.</i>

916
01:01:43,473 --> 01:01:46,041
Haven't had a shark attack
around here in four years.

917
01:01:46,043 --> 01:01:47,108
<i>Really?</i>

918
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,844
Don't you have to check
with other police stations?

919
01:01:49,846 --> 01:01:51,279
<i>Lady, I promise you,</i>

920
01:01:51,281 --> 01:01:53,280
if anyone's gonna hear
about a shark attack,

921
01:01:53,282 --> 01:01:54,752
it's gonna be me.

922
01:01:55,819 --> 01:01:56,987
Good luck to you.

923
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,922
Hmm.

924
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,829
- Hey.
- Hey.

925
01:02:06,797 --> 01:02:07,799
Um...

926
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:09,801
Sorry about tonight.

927
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:12,166
I'm the one
who should apologize.

928
01:02:12,168 --> 01:02:16,237
No, I really need to keep
my side of the street clean

929
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:19,843
and, you know, cultivate
an attitude of gratitude.

930
01:02:21,277 --> 01:02:25,813
I overreacted. I talked
to Emily and ungrounded her.

931
01:02:25,815 --> 01:02:28,150
I'm just so stressed out
about this test.

932
01:02:28,152 --> 01:02:30,819
Well, you've been
working so hard and...

933
01:02:31,955 --> 01:02:33,087
I got it.

934
01:02:33,089 --> 01:02:35,992
And I've been thinking
how I can help.

935
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:37,958
So I talked to Theresa

936
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,197
and she's okay with me
picking up a few of your shifts.

937
01:02:41,397 --> 01:02:43,965
- Really? You'd do that for me?
- Yeah.

938
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,065
I'm not being selfless.

939
01:02:45,067 --> 01:02:47,138
I'm just thinking
of myself less.

940
01:02:48,138 --> 01:02:50,005
You like it with milk, right?

941
01:02:50,007 --> 01:02:51,142
And a little sugar.

942
01:02:52,976 --> 01:02:56,076
Oh, and I'll take the kids
all day Sunday so you can study.

943
01:02:56,078 --> 01:02:57,281
By yourself? I can't let...

944
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:02,016
Actually, that would be amazing.

945
01:03:02,018 --> 01:03:03,884
Great.

946
01:03:03,886 --> 01:03:06,121
I was also thinking
that I should... Oh! Ah!

947
01:03:06,123 --> 01:03:09,023
Sharp knife. Blood. Blood.
Lots of blood.

948
01:03:09,025 --> 01:03:10,025
- I do not like blood.
- All right.

949
01:03:10,027 --> 01:03:12,159
All right, take it easy. You're okay.

950
01:03:12,161 --> 01:03:13,895
- Let me see, let me see.
- Help.

951
01:03:13,897 --> 01:03:15,230
I'm just gonna wash it off.

952
01:03:15,232 --> 01:03:17,165
Feeling queasy. Gonna faint.

953
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:18,366
No. You're not gonna faint.

954
01:03:18,368 --> 01:03:19,934
- I'm fainting.
- No.

955
01:03:19,936 --> 01:03:20,969
The room is spinning.

956
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:23,438
All right, let's just
sit you down over here.

957
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,340
How bad is it?

958
01:03:25,342 --> 01:03:27,308
Should I go to the hospital?
Do I need a tourniquet?

959
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:30,177
Relax. You are
with a trained professional.

960
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:31,913
- Do I need stitches?
- No.

961
01:03:31,915 --> 01:03:34,051
Please help me.
I'm bleeding to death.

962
01:03:34,884 --> 01:03:36,418
Oh, God! It's really deep.

963
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,920
What the hell are you doing?

964
01:03:38,922 --> 01:03:41,922
Cleaning the cut.
My God, you're such a baby!

965
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,159
I got this.

966
01:03:44,161 --> 01:03:45,860
I took a whole class on it.

967
01:03:45,862 --> 01:03:46,962
Dressing wounds?

968
01:03:46,964 --> 01:03:49,163
Dealing with
hysterical patients.

969
01:03:53,069 --> 01:03:54,104
All right.

970
01:03:55,072 --> 01:03:56,073
Okay.

971
01:03:57,007 --> 01:03:58,042
There.

972
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:08,819
You have very good
bedside manner.

973
01:04:10,453 --> 01:04:12,219
- You think so?
- Yeah.

974
01:04:12,221 --> 01:04:14,154
Sometimes I worry about that.

975
01:04:14,156 --> 01:04:16,259
No. No, you're a natural.

976
01:04:18,895 --> 01:04:22,866
All right. There you go.
Good as new.

977
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,076
Well, um...

978
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:35,346
I guess I'll let you study.

979
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:39,317
Thanks for taking
such good care of me.

980
01:04:43,085 --> 01:04:44,087
Okay.

981
01:04:51,194 --> 01:04:52,196
Good night.

982
01:04:53,996 --> 01:04:54,998
Wait.

983
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,400
You can sleep inside.
Downstairs, on the couch.

984
01:05:02,038 --> 01:05:03,874
You've made me very happy.

985
01:05:40,344 --> 01:05:42,513
We'll pick you up
after the game, hmm?

986
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,949
You're welcome!

987
01:05:49,552 --> 01:05:52,219
Why can't we go swimming?

988
01:05:52,221 --> 01:05:54,322
We're giving your sister
a little space.

989
01:06:01,431 --> 01:06:03,163
Too much space.

990
01:06:03,165 --> 01:06:04,534
We're giving her too much space.

991
01:06:06,402 --> 01:06:07,601
Everyone's watching.

992
01:06:07,603 --> 01:06:08,837
I don't care!

993
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:13,174
I don't have to listen to you.
You're not even my real dad.

994
01:06:13,176 --> 01:06:16,210
What? Your mother told you?

995
01:06:16,212 --> 01:06:18,179
Well, I'm still not letting
you throw your life away

996
01:06:18,181 --> 01:06:21,483
for some sex-crazed,
curly-haired wolf.

997
01:06:21,485 --> 01:06:24,388
That boy wants one thing
and one thing only.

998
01:06:25,054 --> 01:06:26,056
He's gay.

999
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:29,190
Okay. One different thing.

1000
01:06:31,627 --> 01:06:34,561
What are you doing?
Why are you crying?

1001
01:06:34,563 --> 01:06:36,067
Because I'm miserable.

1002
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,501
You are?

1003
01:06:38,134 --> 01:06:39,235
Yeah.

1004
01:06:41,371 --> 01:06:43,570
I was really popular
in Portland,

1005
01:06:43,572 --> 01:06:47,308
and here everyone's on group
texts that I'm not a part of.

1006
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:49,411
And there's this boy in
my Spanish class that I like,

1007
01:06:49,413 --> 01:06:51,145
but he doesn't know
that I exist.

1008
01:06:51,147 --> 01:06:53,614
And he's friends with the
lifeguard here and that's...

1009
01:06:53,616 --> 01:06:56,019
Wait, you're taking Spanish?

1010
01:06:58,554 --> 01:06:59,654
<i>Muy bien.</i>

1011
01:06:59,656 --> 01:07:02,123
Your pronunciation
is very natural.

1012
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:04,358
I mean, you still need
to roll the "R's".

1013
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,094
What?

1014
01:07:06,096 --> 01:07:07,494
Say it.

1015
01:07:07,496 --> 01:07:09,596
- You have to... Okay, okay.
- Dad!

1016
01:07:09,598 --> 01:07:12,199
How could he
not know you exist?

1017
01:07:12,201 --> 01:07:15,570
You're a beautiful, smart,
thoughtful young woman.

1018
01:07:15,572 --> 01:07:17,404
He'd be lucky
to be your boyfriend.

1019
01:07:17,406 --> 01:07:20,375
But you're way too young
for a boyfriend.

1020
01:07:20,377 --> 01:07:21,842
They'd all be lucky
to be your boyfriend.

1021
01:07:21,844 --> 01:07:24,612
Every boy here should beg
to be your boyfriend.

1022
01:07:24,614 --> 01:07:28,083
But I forbid it. I forbid it!

1023
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:31,853
I know I'm all over the map.
It's just...

1024
01:07:31,855 --> 01:07:35,190
It's very confusing
having a daughter.

1025
01:07:35,192 --> 01:07:39,096
Look. I'm not gonna do
anything stupid. All right?

1026
01:07:45,502 --> 01:07:47,038
<i>Gracias.</i>

1027
01:07:56,346 --> 01:07:58,413
Blue 52. Hot route left.

1028
01:07:58,415 --> 01:07:59,713
Hut, hut, hike!

1029
01:08:06,656 --> 01:08:08,456
Yes! Yes!

1030
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:10,425
Go, go, go. Yes! Yes! Yes!

1031
01:08:10,427 --> 01:08:13,128
Go! Go! Go! Yes!

1032
01:08:14,531 --> 01:08:17,067
Woo-hoo!

1033
01:08:18,668 --> 01:08:21,336
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1034
01:08:21,338 --> 01:08:24,407
- Go team! Yeah, we did it!
- That's my daughter.

1035
01:08:24,907 --> 01:08:26,110
We know.

1036
01:08:27,643 --> 01:08:29,277
Second touchdown.

1037
01:08:30,379 --> 01:08:31,613
We're winning, actually.

1038
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,117
Yeah,
we kicked their butts!

1039
01:08:34,517 --> 01:08:36,618
- Thanks for rescuing me.
- Ah.

1040
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:38,622
My mind was
turning into mush.

1041
01:08:40,589 --> 01:08:42,422
Hey, Molly!

1042
01:08:42,424 --> 01:08:45,159
When did you learn how to ride
without training wheels?

1043
01:08:45,161 --> 01:08:46,429
Dad taught me.

1044
01:08:48,498 --> 01:08:50,334
She only fell once.

1045
01:08:52,369 --> 01:08:54,502
Faster! Faster! Faster!

1046
01:08:54,504 --> 01:08:56,440
Come on, come on, come on! Yes, yes, yes!

1047
01:08:56,772 --> 01:08:59,373
Whoo!

1048
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:01,376
So how do I get rid
of the brain freeze?

1049
01:09:01,378 --> 01:09:03,377
- Go like this.
- Like this?

1050
01:09:03,379 --> 01:09:05,415
Mmm.

1051
01:09:07,316 --> 01:09:09,551
Are you gonna leave us?

1052
01:09:09,553 --> 01:09:12,586
What do you mean?
Of course not. I'm your dad.

1053
01:09:12,588 --> 01:09:15,422
Sometimes dads leave.

1054
01:09:15,424 --> 01:09:18,560
Well, I guess maybe they do,
but I'm not going anywhere.

1055
01:09:18,562 --> 01:09:20,561
You're stuck with me.

1056
01:09:20,563 --> 01:09:22,398
Thank you.

1057
01:09:32,575 --> 01:09:34,809
"A. Sudden weight gain.
B. Abdominal itch.

1058
01:09:34,811 --> 01:09:37,380
"C. Bloody stools. D. Light..."

1059
01:09:39,348 --> 01:09:40,517
Bloody stools.

1060
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:06,442
<i>Ay,</i> Papa!

1061
01:10:18,554 --> 01:10:19,722
Papa!

1062
01:10:36,873 --> 01:10:38,506
Colin,
were you with Magdalena

1063
01:10:38,508 --> 01:10:40,375
when she identified
my brother's body?

1064
01:10:40,377 --> 01:10:43,377
No, ma'am, she was quite insistent
on handling the matter herself.

1065
01:10:43,379 --> 01:10:44,612
Are you insinuating?

1066
01:10:44,614 --> 01:10:45,646
Are you insinuating?

1067
01:10:45,648 --> 01:10:47,348
Should I be insinuating?

1068
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:48,448
Should I be insinuating?

1069
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:50,385
And before you answer that,
remember I'm Scottish.

1070
01:10:50,387 --> 01:10:51,618
I can do this all day long.

1071
01:10:53,789 --> 01:10:56,491
Hey! So, the test?

1072
01:10:56,493 --> 01:10:59,760
There was a couple that I blanked
on, but at least it's over.

1073
01:10:59,762 --> 01:11:02,396
Now I don't have
to keep up this insane lie.

1074
01:11:02,398 --> 01:11:05,466
Are you sure you don't wanna wait a
couple of weeks before you tell him?

1075
01:11:05,468 --> 01:11:07,068
I mean, good help
is hard to find.

1076
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:09,903
Yeah, totally. And the guys are
really starting to like him, too.

1077
01:11:09,905 --> 01:11:12,340
No. No. Fair is fair.
He has paid his debt.

1078
01:11:12,342 --> 01:11:13,707
I have tortured him
long enough.

1079
01:11:13,709 --> 01:11:14,876
Okay.

1080
01:11:14,878 --> 01:11:17,414
You're really gonna hate
doing your own laundry again.

1081
01:11:18,414 --> 01:11:19,816
Guys...

1082
01:11:20,816 --> 01:11:23,318
I feel pretty nervous.

1083
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,551
I think he's gonna freak out.

1084
01:11:24,553 --> 01:11:25,854
Freak out?

1085
01:11:25,856 --> 01:11:28,323
Kate, you're telling a ditch digger
he's a billionaire, you know.

1086
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:30,491
I'm pretty sure
he's gonna be okay with it.

1087
01:11:30,493 --> 01:11:31,527
Yeah.

1088
01:11:35,632 --> 01:11:36,797
Hey.

1089
01:11:36,799 --> 01:11:37,801
Hey.

1090
01:11:39,401 --> 01:11:41,668
Uh, I need to talk to you.

1091
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:43,904
Yeah. What's up?

1092
01:11:43,906 --> 01:11:47,341
I have to confess something,
and I don't know where to start.

1093
01:11:47,343 --> 01:11:49,409
Well, whatever it is,

1094
01:11:49,411 --> 01:11:51,514
I'm sure it's not
that big of a deal.

1095
01:11:52,548 --> 01:11:54,415
- It's pretty big.
- Yeah?

1096
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:57,288
And this is gonna sound crazy.

1097
01:11:58,387 --> 01:12:02,325
Maybe funny-crazy
or crazy-crazy.

1098
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:05,525
But I did something terrible.

1099
01:12:05,527 --> 01:12:07,798
Hold that thought.

1100
01:12:08,831 --> 01:12:09,833
Girls!

1101
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,369
Dinner's ready!

1102
01:12:17,673 --> 01:12:19,609
Yeah. Sit down, please.

1103
01:12:21,844 --> 01:12:25,380
- Be careful, it's hot.
- It smells so good.

1104
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:26,913
- I hope it tastes good.
- It looks so good.

1105
01:12:26,915 --> 01:12:28,851
Use a spoon. Mmm.

1106
01:12:30,419 --> 01:12:32,452
So...

1107
01:12:32,454 --> 01:12:34,824
What's this awful thing
you need to confess?

1108
01:12:36,892 --> 01:12:38,328
I...

1109
01:12:40,562 --> 01:12:42,932
Come on, I'm your husband.
You can tell me anything.

1110
01:12:51,907 --> 01:12:54,442
I forgot it's our anniversary.

1111
01:12:54,444 --> 01:12:55,743
Really?

1112
01:12:55,745 --> 01:12:56,943
Today?

1113
01:12:56,945 --> 01:12:58,581
Happy anniversary!

1114
01:12:59,949 --> 01:13:02,015
We're going out!

1115
01:13:42,725 --> 01:13:44,024
You guys are really good.

1116
01:13:44,026 --> 01:13:45,828
<i>Thanks, bro. Tell my uncle.</i>

1117
01:13:54,771 --> 01:13:56,938
Fifteen years.

1118
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:59,543
A lot of couples don't
make it that long.

1119
01:14:00,243 --> 01:14:01,445
Yeah.

1120
01:14:02,044 --> 01:14:03,780
Thanks for sticking with me.

1121
01:14:05,981 --> 01:14:08,084
I know I haven't made
things easy.

1122
01:14:11,987 --> 01:14:14,488
- It's pretty out here.
- Beautiful.

1123
01:14:18,026 --> 01:14:21,561
Do you know what it means when a
ship honks three times like that?

1124
01:14:21,563 --> 01:14:24,468
Someone told me once,
but I forgot.

1125
01:14:25,834 --> 01:14:26,904
Yes, I do.

1126
01:14:27,971 --> 01:14:30,671
It's based on
an old, Spanish legend.

1127
01:14:30,673 --> 01:14:32,273
Yeah.

1128
01:14:32,275 --> 01:14:34,708
Very romantic, by the way.

1129
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:38,979
You see, there was a poor
housemaid named Catalina.

1130
01:14:38,981 --> 01:14:44,652
She was very pretty and caught the eye
of the colonial governor's son, Arturo.

1131
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:47,054
Okay, wait. You don't
remember anything,

1132
01:14:47,056 --> 01:14:48,588
yet you remember this?

1133
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:50,858
It's a very famous legend.

1134
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:52,560
So, they fell in love.

1135
01:14:52,562 --> 01:14:53,627
Of course.

1136
01:14:53,629 --> 01:14:55,729
But Arturo's father forbade it.

1137
01:14:55,731 --> 01:14:59,300
He couldn't have his only son
running around with a commoner.

1138
01:14:59,302 --> 01:15:03,671
So, he ordered Arturo to return
to Spain, which he did.

1139
01:15:03,673 --> 01:15:06,707
But not before
promising Catalina

1140
01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:08,975
he'd come back
and signal for her

1141
01:15:08,977 --> 01:15:11,748
with three long blasts.

1142
01:15:12,615 --> 01:15:14,649
Just like you heard.

1143
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:18,752
This sounds suspiciously like one of
the shows the kitchen guys watch.

1144
01:15:18,754 --> 01:15:20,887
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Uh-huh.

1145
01:15:20,889 --> 01:15:25,126
Anyway, a year later,
everything went as planned.

1146
01:15:25,128 --> 01:15:28,628
She swam out,
but the fog was too thick.

1147
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:31,332
He called out,
"Catalina! Catalina!"

1148
01:15:31,334 --> 01:15:34,034
She yelled back,
"Arturo! Arturo!"

1149
01:15:34,036 --> 01:15:36,903
And with that,
he dove into the water.

1150
01:15:36,905 --> 01:15:38,773
They reunited,

1151
01:15:38,775 --> 01:15:41,042
and Catalina, who,
up until that point,

1152
01:15:41,044 --> 01:15:42,577
had been resisting him

1153
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:45,516
because of some test
she had to study for,

1154
01:15:46,048 --> 01:15:48,851
finally let him kiss her.

1155
01:15:49,919 --> 01:15:50,952
Hmm.

1156
01:15:50,954 --> 01:15:52,920
Oh. Now I remember.

1157
01:15:52,922 --> 01:15:55,790
Three honks means a boat's
about to go in reverse.

1158
01:15:57,593 --> 01:15:58,628
Okay.

1159
01:15:59,062 --> 01:16:01,064
Maybe. Factually.

1160
01:16:01,664 --> 01:16:02,799
But I...

1161
01:16:20,749 --> 01:16:22,585
Was it always this good?

1162
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:27,123
Every time with you
is like the first time.

1163
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:39,102
Look at this thing.
We built it.

1164
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:43,237
Your first pool, bro.

1165
01:16:43,239 --> 01:16:44,872
Good job.

1166
01:16:44,874 --> 01:16:47,707
Hey, look at you,
you got working man hands now.

1167
01:16:47,709 --> 01:16:48,911
Yeah!

1168
01:16:49,178 --> 01:16:51,244
Yes, I do!

1169
01:17:03,426 --> 01:17:05,126
That's good.

1170
01:17:05,128 --> 01:17:08,028
<i>Take that play, get
off the block there by Laken Tomlinson.</i>

1171
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:11,666
<i>This guy will be a defensive
MVP one day, I guarantee you.</i>

1172
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,603
Dad, what's a pervert?

1173
01:17:17,005 --> 01:17:18,204
Um...

1174
01:17:18,206 --> 01:17:20,073
Well, uh...

1175
01:17:20,075 --> 01:17:21,777
When a man

1176
01:17:22,879 --> 01:17:24,214
has a van...

1177
01:17:25,947 --> 01:17:27,148
Kate!

1178
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:28,882
Molly has a question for you.

1179
01:17:29,986 --> 01:17:32,019
What is taking them so long?

1180
01:17:32,021 --> 01:17:33,253
Would you relax?

1181
01:17:33,255 --> 01:17:35,855
They said they were gonna post
the results after 2:00 p.m.

1182
01:17:35,857 --> 01:17:36,957
All right. Halftime.

1183
01:17:36,959 --> 01:17:39,126
I'm getting lunch.

1184
01:17:39,128 --> 01:17:41,164
Oh, wait. Where's my list?

1185
01:17:41,931 --> 01:17:42,997
Here.

1186
01:17:42,999 --> 01:17:45,035
Mmm... <i>Ciao.</i>

1187
01:17:46,902 --> 01:17:48,903
Wait! Hey, I forgot.

1188
01:17:48,905 --> 01:17:50,704
Honey!

1189
01:17:50,706 --> 01:17:54,207
Get coleslaw, okay?
And maybe some potato chips.

1190
01:17:54,209 --> 01:17:55,810
Okay, got it.

1191
01:17:55,812 --> 01:17:58,845
Write it down. I know you.
You're gonna forget.

1192
01:17:58,847 --> 01:18:01,181
And get cookies. I want cookies.

1193
01:18:01,183 --> 01:18:02,652
Cookies.

1194
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,022
Pen.

1195
01:18:14,262 --> 01:18:15,264
Kate!

1196
01:18:16,932 --> 01:18:18,131
What's the matter?

1197
01:18:18,133 --> 01:18:21,268
I don't know.
I was just wondering

1198
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:24,771
what the wife on an
infertile man would be doing

1199
01:18:24,773 --> 01:18:29,045
with a strip of ribbed,
reservoir-tipped Trojans?

1200
01:18:29,945 --> 01:18:30,946
Okay...

1201
01:18:31,813 --> 01:18:34,515
This is not what you think.

1202
01:18:34,517 --> 01:18:35,949
It's nothing.

1203
01:18:35,951 --> 01:18:38,018
Nothing? We made a vow.

1204
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:40,887
A sacred vow,
which I kept, I think.

1205
01:18:40,889 --> 01:18:43,791
And don't assume
I didn't have opportunities,

1206
01:18:43,793 --> 01:18:44,958
because I did.

1207
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,230
Lots and lots of them. Probably.

1208
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:49,195
This is nuts.

1209
01:18:49,197 --> 01:18:51,098
You know what, I'm glad.

1210
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,332
I'm glad you found these,

1211
01:18:52,334 --> 01:18:55,705
because I have been trying to
think of a way to tell you this.

1212
01:18:56,038 --> 01:18:57,307
You and I...

1213
01:18:59,909 --> 01:19:01,777
We're not really married.

1214
01:19:02,945 --> 01:19:04,545
Have I not made you happy?

1215
01:19:04,547 --> 01:19:06,814
Yes, but that's not the point.

1216
01:19:06,816 --> 01:19:08,815
I'm not your wife.

1217
01:19:08,817 --> 01:19:11,985
Those kids in there,
they're not your children.

1218
01:19:11,987 --> 01:19:13,757
Oh, this again.

1219
01:19:14,289 --> 01:19:15,855
Low blow.

1220
01:19:15,857 --> 01:19:17,259
All right, come on.
Come on!

1221
01:19:17,893 --> 01:19:20,127
Girls?

1222
01:19:20,129 --> 01:19:23,934
Girls, I just told him the truth,
and I want you to tell him, too.

1223
01:19:27,102 --> 01:19:28,237
Go ahead, tell him.

1224
01:19:30,005 --> 01:19:32,006
Tell him what?

1225
01:19:32,008 --> 01:19:33,276
Tell him he's not your dad.

1226
01:19:34,009 --> 01:19:34,975
But he is our dad?

1227
01:19:34,977 --> 01:19:38,011
No, don't tell him
what I told you to tell him.

1228
01:19:38,013 --> 01:19:40,247
Tell him what really
happened. Emily?

1229
01:19:40,249 --> 01:19:42,882
He got drunk and
blacked out on the beach.

1230
01:19:42,884 --> 01:19:44,885
We were really worried.
I couldn't sleep.

1231
01:19:44,887 --> 01:19:46,886
No, damn it!
Tell him the truth!

1232
01:19:46,888 --> 01:19:49,092
Don't you speak to
my three musketeers like that.

1233
01:19:49,825 --> 01:19:51,060
I've had it.

1234
01:19:54,129 --> 01:19:55,296
What do you think you're doing?

1235
01:19:55,298 --> 01:19:57,297
- We like him.
- We want to keep him.

1236
01:19:57,299 --> 01:20:00,266
You can't keep him.
He doesn't belong to you.

1237
01:20:00,268 --> 01:20:03,304
He didn't belong to you, either,
but that didn't stop you.

1238
01:20:03,306 --> 01:20:06,907
- You know I have my reasons.
- So do we.

1239
01:20:06,909 --> 01:20:10,010
Leo, listen. Look, look, look.
Those condoms aren't Kate's.

1240
01:20:10,012 --> 01:20:11,045
They're mine.

1241
01:20:11,047 --> 01:20:12,145
Don't cover for her.

1242
01:20:12,147 --> 01:20:15,349
No, I'm not.
She's covering for me.

1243
01:20:15,351 --> 01:20:18,318
Yeah. I'm the one
sleeping with the customers.

1244
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,854
Really?

1245
01:20:20,856 --> 01:20:24,190
I have a problem, Leo.
I'm obsessed with sex.

1246
01:20:24,192 --> 01:20:25,326
Come on.

1247
01:20:25,328 --> 01:20:27,627
I'm a sex addict!
It's a real thing.

1248
01:20:27,629 --> 01:20:28,962
What are you talking about?

1249
01:20:28,964 --> 01:20:30,197
Kate! I confessed.

1250
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:31,998
You don't have to lie
for me anymore.

1251
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,634
I can finally get
the help I need.

1252
01:20:33,636 --> 01:20:35,336
Now, don't worry.
You don't have to tell Bobby.

1253
01:20:35,338 --> 01:20:36,871
I'll tell him.

1254
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:37,874
Do you hate me?

1255
01:20:40,176 --> 01:20:41,410
Of course not.

1256
01:20:42,978 --> 01:20:44,815
I know the flesh is weak.

1257
01:20:45,447 --> 01:20:49,116
Hey, one day at a time. Hmm?

1258
01:20:49,118 --> 01:20:50,283
Yeah, one day at a time.

1259
01:20:53,222 --> 01:20:56,126
I'm so sorry I didn't trust you.

1260
01:20:57,293 --> 01:20:59,393
That really scared me.

1261
01:20:59,395 --> 01:21:02,061
It was like my whole life
was a lie.

1262
01:21:02,063 --> 01:21:03,363
Come on,
they're back on the field!

1263
01:21:03,365 --> 01:21:06,100
Hey. Second half's
about to start.

1264
01:21:06,102 --> 01:21:07,204
Mind doing the sandwich run?

1265
01:21:10,472 --> 01:21:12,107
What are you doing?

1266
01:21:13,308 --> 01:21:15,376
I can't keep this up forever.

1267
01:21:15,378 --> 01:21:16,677
Why not?

1268
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:19,279
Okay, look, I know your relationship's
a little unconventional.

1269
01:21:19,281 --> 01:21:22,283
But whose isn't?
You guys are good together.

1270
01:21:22,285 --> 01:21:23,684
Stop fighting it.

1271
01:21:23,686 --> 01:21:25,051
I'll tell you one thing.

1272
01:21:25,053 --> 01:21:28,689
Pretend or not, Bobby's Latin ego
is not gonna like being cheated on.

1273
01:21:28,691 --> 01:21:30,323
- Kate!
- Shit.

1274
01:21:30,325 --> 01:21:31,328
They told him.

1275
01:21:33,262 --> 01:21:35,031
You passed! You're a nurse!

1276
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,142
Congratulations, Mom!

1277
01:21:56,986 --> 01:21:58,188
- Hike!
- Let's do this.

1278
01:22:06,529 --> 01:22:08,061
- Hey, Gordo.
- Hey.

1279
01:22:08,063 --> 01:22:09,065
You okay?

1280
01:22:10,031 --> 01:22:10,965
Huh? Oh.

1281
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:13,300
Yeah, well, you know,
I've been better.

1282
01:22:13,302 --> 01:22:14,167
Yeah.

1283
01:22:14,169 --> 01:22:16,202
But this is the
wake-up call we needed.

1284
01:22:16,204 --> 01:22:18,572
I wasn't as attentive to her
needs as I should have been.

1285
01:22:18,574 --> 01:22:21,511
You know, I can be
emotionally remote, bro.

1286
01:22:23,212 --> 01:22:25,112
We're starting couples therapy.

1287
01:22:25,114 --> 01:22:26,316
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

1288
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:30,317
Just, whatever you do,
you know, don't...

1289
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:33,022
I'm sorry, take Kate
for granted. Because...

1290
01:22:35,191 --> 01:22:38,324
Look, I know we can be
a little <i>machista.</i>

1291
01:22:38,326 --> 01:22:40,327
- It's our way. Yeah.
- You know?

1292
01:22:40,329 --> 01:22:43,199
But your vulnerability
and honesty really touches me.

1293
01:22:48,204 --> 01:22:49,205
You owe me.

1294
01:22:49,571 --> 01:22:51,537
I know.

1295
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:54,241
Oh, yeah,
this is a Christmas card.

1296
01:22:54,243 --> 01:22:55,475
Oh, God, it's cold!

1297
01:22:55,477 --> 01:22:57,377
I got you!

1298
01:22:57,379 --> 01:22:59,516
That's him.
The chicken fight guy.

1299
01:24:03,344 --> 01:24:06,079
Hold the ashes!
Sorry, sorry.

1300
01:24:07,182 --> 01:24:08,450
This was taken 20 minutes ago.

1301
01:24:09,485 --> 01:24:10,650
- Leonardo?
- What?

1302
01:24:10,652 --> 01:24:12,454
It's Leonardo!

1303
01:24:24,432 --> 01:24:26,600
Hey, you guys! You guys!

1304
01:24:26,602 --> 01:24:28,568
Before I cut the cake,

1305
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:31,305
I just want to thank you all
for being here.

1306
01:24:31,307 --> 01:24:34,174
I could not have passed
the test without you all.

1307
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:36,510
- Nurse Kate!
- Nurse Kate!

1308
01:24:36,512 --> 01:24:38,048
Especially you, Leo.

1309
01:24:38,547 --> 01:24:40,279
He cooked, he cleaned.

1310
01:24:40,281 --> 01:24:43,216
He worked two jobs,
he kept me laughing.

1311
01:24:43,218 --> 01:24:44,685
And if you haven't tried
the empanadas yet,

1312
01:24:44,687 --> 01:24:46,319
they are delicious.
He made them.

1313
01:24:46,321 --> 01:24:47,554
They're gone!

1314
01:24:49,624 --> 01:24:51,190
What, babe?

1315
01:24:51,192 --> 01:24:52,529
They're delicious, bro.

1316
01:24:58,467 --> 01:25:00,103
Wait, wait, wait.

1317
01:25:00,535 --> 01:25:01,601
Wait, wait, wait.

1318
01:25:01,603 --> 01:25:03,202
I want to say something, too.

1319
01:25:03,204 --> 01:25:05,338
I mean, look at this face.

1320
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:06,907
- Look at this face.
- Oh!

1321
01:25:06,909 --> 01:25:09,542
Isn't this the most beautiful
face you've ever seen?

1322
01:25:09,544 --> 01:25:11,377
Second. Second most beautiful.

1323
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:14,616
She's too good for you!

1324
01:25:16,352 --> 01:25:20,690
And also, I don't remember
the first time I did this,

1325
01:25:22,258 --> 01:25:24,224
and that doesn't feel right.

1326
01:25:24,226 --> 01:25:26,362
So, Kate,

1327
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:30,163
will you marry me again?

1328
01:25:30,165 --> 01:25:32,101
Holy crap.

1329
01:25:33,369 --> 01:25:34,504
Yeah.

1330
01:25:35,337 --> 01:25:37,436
Yes! Yes, I will!

1331
01:25:37,438 --> 01:25:39,372
- She said yes!
- She said yes!

1332
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:42,275
That's what
I'm talking about, Leo!

1333
01:25:42,277 --> 01:25:43,377
Go, Mom!

1334
01:25:43,379 --> 01:25:45,278
That's what
I'm talking about, bro!

1335
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,180
That's my boy right there.

1336
01:25:47,182 --> 01:25:49,248
Okay, that's love, baby.

1337
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:53,287
"'And now, gentlemen, ' said d'Artagnan,
without stopping to explain his conduct,

1338
01:25:53,289 --> 01:25:56,256
"'all for one, and one for all.

1339
01:25:56,258 --> 01:25:58,524
"'That is our motto, is it not?

1340
01:25:58,526 --> 01:26:00,195
"'But still, look here.'"

1341
01:26:43,571 --> 01:26:45,404
Wow.

1342
01:26:45,406 --> 01:26:46,773
Whose fancy car is that?

1343
01:26:46,775 --> 01:26:48,344
That's so cool.

1344
01:27:05,761 --> 01:27:07,297
Hey, Papi!

1345
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,363
Sofia!

1346
01:27:09,365 --> 01:27:10,463
Hi, Magda!

1347
01:27:10,465 --> 01:27:12,265
Let me just drop this
in the house.

1348
01:27:12,267 --> 01:27:13,335
Hey.

1349
01:27:36,691 --> 01:27:37,694
Papi.

1350
01:27:38,459 --> 01:27:39,462
Sofia.

1351
01:27:40,396 --> 01:27:42,331
Magda.

1352
01:27:43,331 --> 01:27:44,700
Oh, my God, I remember.

1353
01:27:46,302 --> 01:27:48,338
I'm Leonardo Montenegro.

1354
01:27:49,338 --> 01:27:50,639
Kate!

1355
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,805
I'm cured!

1356
01:27:52,807 --> 01:27:55,509
The doctor said my memory
could come back suddenly,

1357
01:27:55,511 --> 01:27:57,310
and he was right.

1358
01:27:57,312 --> 01:27:59,813
I mean, I saw Papi...

1359
01:27:59,815 --> 01:28:02,616
I walked past him into
the house and poof!

1360
01:28:02,618 --> 01:28:03,783
It came back!

1361
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,820
Honey, ask me anything.

1362
01:28:07,822 --> 01:28:10,690
Ask me about my childhood
in Mexico City.

1363
01:28:10,692 --> 01:28:13,393
About my car collection.

1364
01:28:13,395 --> 01:28:14,827
About my money.

1365
01:28:14,829 --> 01:28:17,366
Money. I have money!

1366
01:28:18,433 --> 01:28:21,534
Lots and lots of money.

1367
01:28:21,536 --> 01:28:23,740
This is the happiest day
of my life!

1368
01:28:26,775 --> 01:28:27,777
Wait.

1369
01:28:32,414 --> 01:28:33,750
You're not my wife.

1370
01:28:35,683 --> 01:28:37,387
Why would you make me think...

1371
01:28:40,422 --> 01:28:41,723
Why would you do that to me?

1372
01:28:45,526 --> 01:28:46,828
I know why.

1373
01:28:49,397 --> 01:28:54,303
You're that awful carpet cleaner
lady who hates me.

1374
01:28:56,972 --> 01:28:58,441
And...

1375
01:28:59,441 --> 01:29:02,576
And these are your kids

1376
01:29:02,578 --> 01:29:04,513
and you made me believe...

1377
01:29:06,714 --> 01:29:07,717
Oh, God.

1378
01:29:09,418 --> 01:29:10,719
Oh, God.

1379
01:29:12,154 --> 01:29:13,656
You tricked me.

1380
01:29:14,923 --> 01:29:16,426
You used me.

1381
01:29:16,792 --> 01:29:17,858
Leo...

1382
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:19,426
No, no, no.

1383
01:29:19,428 --> 01:29:20,697
My name is not Leo.

1384
01:29:21,597 --> 01:29:22,799
It's Leonardo.

1385
01:29:24,665 --> 01:29:26,668
And I don't belong with you.

1386
01:29:30,672 --> 01:29:31,874
And I don't belong with them.

1387
01:29:40,949 --> 01:29:42,485
I'll get my things.

1388
01:30:11,746 --> 01:30:13,482
There's nothing
in there that's mine.

1389
01:30:17,518 --> 01:30:18,920
For what it's worth...

1390
01:30:20,021 --> 01:30:21,556
I'm sorry.

1391
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:23,525
And...

1392
01:30:24,793 --> 01:30:26,596
And thank you.

1393
01:30:38,941 --> 01:30:39,942
Hey.

1394
01:30:57,058 --> 01:30:58,591
Girls.

1395
01:30:58,593 --> 01:30:59,725
Don't go!

1396
01:30:59,727 --> 01:31:02,261
Dad! Dad! Don't go.

1397
01:31:02,263 --> 01:31:04,831
Dad! Dad!

1398
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:05,868
Dad!

1399
01:31:06,668 --> 01:31:07,701
Dad!

1400
01:31:07,703 --> 01:31:09,836
No! Don't go, don't go!

1401
01:31:09,838 --> 01:31:11,007
Wait, no.

1402
01:31:16,078 --> 01:31:17,446
Daddy!

1403
01:31:18,847 --> 01:31:20,483
Daddy, wait!

1404
01:32:05,593 --> 01:32:06,893
Welcome back, sir.

1405
01:32:06,895 --> 01:32:08,763
Your funeral was lovely,
by the way.

1406
01:32:18,072 --> 01:32:20,840
I liked Dad's sauce better.

1407
01:32:20,842 --> 01:32:22,908
Sweetie, you know
he was never really your dad.

1408
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:24,877
You should have tried
to stop him.

1409
01:32:24,879 --> 01:32:26,680
What was I gonna say?

1410
01:32:26,682 --> 01:32:29,849
I lied to him.
I basically kidnapped the man.

1411
01:32:29,851 --> 01:32:33,623
So what? You're obviously
totally in love with him.

1412
01:32:34,655 --> 01:32:35,956
What does it matter now?

1413
01:32:35,958 --> 01:32:37,657
He's back to his old life,

1414
01:32:37,659 --> 01:32:41,063
with his servants
and supermodels.

1415
01:32:42,597 --> 01:32:43,665
It's over.

1416
01:32:44,732 --> 01:32:48,538
Now finish up, 'cause
Grandma can't wait to see ya.

1417
01:34:05,047 --> 01:34:06,616
No, I don't drink.

1418
01:34:09,985 --> 01:34:13,089
Wait, wait. I do drink.

1419
01:34:14,188 --> 01:34:15,154
Fill her up, Colin!

1420
01:34:15,156 --> 01:34:17,791
Yes, that was definitely
my recollection, sir.

1421
01:34:17,793 --> 01:34:20,460
- Give me the bottle.
- Ah, what was I thinking?

1422
01:34:40,248 --> 01:34:42,282
This is horrifying.

1423
01:34:46,855 --> 01:34:48,223
Why is she doing this?

1424
01:34:49,958 --> 01:34:53,029
Because life's short, and you
don't wanna have regrets.

1425
01:34:59,868 --> 01:35:01,134
Come on. We're getting Leo.

1426
01:35:01,136 --> 01:35:02,234
Yay!

1427
01:35:02,236 --> 01:35:05,070
Excuse us. Diarrhea. Excuse us.

1428
01:35:05,072 --> 01:35:06,305
Where are you going?

1429
01:35:06,307 --> 01:35:07,842
- I'll call you.
- Yes, yes, yes!

1430
01:35:10,212 --> 01:35:11,813
Hurry up,
we gotta catch him.

1431
01:35:19,087 --> 01:35:20,753
Sir, you should have called me.

1432
01:35:20,755 --> 01:35:21,954
I'd have gotten that for you.

1433
01:35:21,956 --> 01:35:24,157
You know, it's funny.

1434
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:26,259
I've had this boat for 10 years,

1435
01:35:26,261 --> 01:35:29,229
and I don't think
I ever stepped foot in here.

1436
01:35:29,231 --> 01:35:31,163
Well, that's because
you have people

1437
01:35:31,165 --> 01:35:33,032
to take care
of everything for you.

1438
01:35:33,034 --> 01:35:36,301
You know, when I was
working construction,

1439
01:35:36,303 --> 01:35:39,072
I hated rich assholes like me.

1440
01:35:39,074 --> 01:35:40,273
Hmm.

1441
01:35:40,275 --> 01:35:43,342
Did you hate me, Colin?
You can be honest.

1442
01:35:43,344 --> 01:35:46,011
Well. If I may
remind you, sir,

1443
01:35:46,013 --> 01:35:49,215
the reason I got this job was because
the last steward was honest.

1444
01:35:49,217 --> 01:35:51,721
Eh.

1445
01:35:53,254 --> 01:35:54,723
Can I confess something?

1446
01:35:55,089 --> 01:35:56,092
Hmm.

1447
01:35:58,125 --> 01:36:01,129
I'm not exactly sure
where I fit in anymore.

1448
01:36:02,062 --> 01:36:03,065
Is that crazy?

1449
01:36:05,267 --> 01:36:10,235
Most of us only know the world
that we're born into.

1450
01:36:10,237 --> 01:36:14,110
You've had the privilege of seeing life
from an entirely different perspective.

1451
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:16,876
Yeah, I did.

1452
01:36:16,878 --> 01:36:18,147
And it sucked, didn't it?

1453
01:36:26,053 --> 01:36:27,153
What's up, Kate?

1454
01:36:27,155 --> 01:36:29,157
Bobby, we need your boat!

1455
01:36:30,225 --> 01:36:32,926
You hear that?
She needs my boat.

1456
01:36:32,928 --> 01:36:34,063
She needs it.

1457
01:37:46,368 --> 01:37:49,002
"There was hope
a Mexico City woman

1458
01:37:49,004 --> 01:37:51,874
"yachting nearby
might be his sister."

1459
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:21,136
Three.

1460
01:38:22,102 --> 01:38:24,272
Three! That's Kate!

1461
01:38:25,339 --> 01:38:27,073
That's Kate.

1462
01:38:27,075 --> 01:38:29,141
Leonardo.

1463
01:38:29,143 --> 01:38:30,913
Move away, Captain.

1464
01:38:41,423 --> 01:38:44,159
Arturo! Arturo!

1465
01:38:44,959 --> 01:38:48,293
Catalina! Catalina!

1466
01:38:52,499 --> 01:38:55,435
- They're turning!
- Mom! Mom! Mom!

1467
01:38:55,437 --> 01:38:58,003
They're turning around.
Why are they turning around?

1468
01:38:58,005 --> 01:38:59,738
- I don't know.
- Bobby, do something.

1469
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:01,276
No, no, no!

1470
01:39:02,142 --> 01:39:03,212
Papa!

1471
01:39:13,554 --> 01:39:15,354
Come on,
come on, we're losing them!

1472
01:39:15,356 --> 01:39:16,521
Can't this thing go any faster?

1473
01:39:16,523 --> 01:39:18,157
No, it's a leisure boat, babe!

1474
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:19,391
Just admit you overpaid.

1475
01:39:19,393 --> 01:39:20,592
Okay, okay, I overpaid!

1476
01:39:20,594 --> 01:39:22,327
We're never gonna catch them.

1477
01:39:22,329 --> 01:39:23,498
I should have sprung
for the 40-footer.

1478
01:39:27,201 --> 01:39:29,202
I'm sorry, Kate.
There's nothing I can do.

1479
01:39:43,017 --> 01:39:45,318
I love you, Kate!

1480
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:48,023
I love you, too!

1481
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,269
What's he doing?

1482
01:40:03,437 --> 01:40:06,240
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa! That was amazing!

1483
01:40:09,811 --> 01:40:11,179
Man overboard!

1484
01:40:17,584 --> 01:40:19,818
- What? Kate!
- Mom!

1485
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:21,153
- Mom!
- Kate.

1486
01:40:21,155 --> 01:40:23,088
I'm coming!

1487
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:26,059
Mom! What are you doing?

1488
01:40:26,061 --> 01:40:28,461
What are you waiting for? Get the dinghy!

1489
01:40:28,463 --> 01:40:29,498
Get the dinghy, bro!

1490
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,533
I never want to be
apart from you!

1491
01:40:33,535 --> 01:40:36,038
I'll never
let you go again!

1492
01:40:40,075 --> 01:40:41,110
Leonardo!

1493
01:40:48,148 --> 01:40:50,218
Never actually been in this thing, bro.

1494
01:41:15,509 --> 01:41:17,245
Mom! What is he doing?

1495
01:41:18,312 --> 01:41:19,511
I don't know!

1496
01:41:19,513 --> 01:41:21,346
I'm negotiating!

1497
01:41:21,348 --> 01:41:23,315
Kate, get in here!
You're gonna drown. Come on!

1498
01:41:26,387 --> 01:41:27,389
Leo!

1499
01:41:59,486 --> 01:42:01,389
Honey, are you coming?

1500
01:42:08,495 --> 01:42:10,496
This is not how I envisioned
this moment.

1501
01:42:10,498 --> 01:42:12,564
I know. I know.

1502
01:42:12,566 --> 01:42:15,301
It's just that most people
don't actually

1503
01:42:15,303 --> 01:42:17,369
have to choose between
love and money.

1504
01:42:17,371 --> 01:42:19,173
It's not easy.

1505
01:42:37,659 --> 01:42:40,792
It's easy. I choose you.

1506
01:42:40,794 --> 01:42:43,261
<i>Oye,</i> Leo, you're giving up
a lot, dude.

1507
01:42:43,263 --> 01:42:46,232
No one would begrudge you if you
wanted to take a few minutes.

1508
01:42:46,234 --> 01:42:47,567
Bobby, would you stay
out of this?

1509
01:42:47,569 --> 01:42:48,534
What? I'm just saying!

1510
01:42:48,536 --> 01:42:51,269
Love fades, okay?
I mean, it's wonderful.

1511
01:42:51,271 --> 01:42:53,605
But some of the excitement
goes away. Now, money...

1512
01:42:53,607 --> 01:42:55,774
Bobby! Shut the hell up!

1513
01:42:55,776 --> 01:42:58,677
- You shut up, babe!
- Yeah! Shut the hell up!

1514
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:00,249
Kate, listen.

1515
01:43:01,449 --> 01:43:03,649
My life was richer
when I was poor with you

1516
01:43:03,651 --> 01:43:05,454
than when I had all the money
in the world.

1517
01:43:08,755 --> 01:43:10,756
If I jump back in the water,

1518
01:43:10,758 --> 01:43:13,326
will you promise
to kiss me this time?

1519
01:43:13,328 --> 01:43:14,362
Yes.

1520
01:43:31,012 --> 01:43:32,246
Go, Kate!

1521
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:35,280
<i>Ay.</i>

1522
01:43:46,261 --> 01:43:47,560
Go, Mom!

1523
01:43:58,505 --> 01:44:00,573
Lunches are done!

1524
01:44:00,575 --> 01:44:02,475
Bobby's picking me up in five.

1525
01:44:02,477 --> 01:44:04,743
All right. You sure you can pick
up the girls from school today?

1526
01:44:04,745 --> 01:44:06,578
- Uh, yeah.
- I got it.

1527
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:08,413
Emily, tell him I'm coming.

1528
01:44:08,415 --> 01:44:09,415
Yes.

1529
01:44:09,417 --> 01:44:11,317
Then I'll drop Olivia
at football practice,

1530
01:44:11,319 --> 01:44:12,486
but you have to pick her up.

1531
01:44:13,754 --> 01:44:16,488
- Colin?
- Hello again.

1532
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:18,724
What on Earth?

1533
01:44:20,527 --> 01:44:22,263
Hey, come here.

1534
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:23,895
What are you doing here?

1535
01:44:23,897 --> 01:44:25,064
I was hoping you might
be in the market

1536
01:44:25,066 --> 01:44:28,634
for a top-notch, Scottish nanny
with excellent references.

1537
01:44:28,636 --> 01:44:30,403
You know I'd love that,

1538
01:44:30,405 --> 01:44:32,805
but there's no way
we can afford you.

1539
01:44:32,807 --> 01:44:34,806
Well, in fact you can, sir.

1540
01:44:34,808 --> 01:44:36,475
Sofia sent me back
with the yacht.

1541
01:44:36,477 --> 01:44:37,409
She wanted to remind you

1542
01:44:37,411 --> 01:44:40,378
it was a birthday present
from your father.

1543
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:43,317
The deed is in your name.
It's still yours.

1544
01:44:45,386 --> 01:44:47,586
Oh, my God.

1545
01:44:47,588 --> 01:44:49,424
You mean I can sell it?

1546
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:51,756
It must be worth a fortune.

1547
01:44:51,758 --> 01:44:53,395
Over 60 million.

1548
01:44:57,432 --> 01:44:58,433
Pesos?

1549
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,570
God, no, ma'am. Dollars.

1550
01:45:03,437 --> 01:45:04,537
Oh.

1551
01:45:19,486 --> 01:45:22,854
By the power invested in me
by the Royal Norwegian Navy,

1552
01:45:22,856 --> 01:45:25,359
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1553
01:45:32,133 --> 01:45:34,536
- Go, Mom!
- Go, Mom!

1554
01:45:35,803 --> 01:45:37,439
Go, Dad!

1555
01:46:17,712 --> 01:46:18,810
<i>Okay.</i>

1556
01:46:18,812 --> 01:46:20,979
Before I toast the happy couple,

1557
01:46:20,981 --> 01:46:23,482
let me just dispel a few rumors

1558
01:46:23,484 --> 01:46:24,617
that have been floating around

1559
01:46:24,619 --> 01:46:26,719
about me being cheated on.

1560
01:46:26,721 --> 01:46:30,723
Never happened. Okay?
Not once, not ever.

1561
01:46:30,725 --> 01:46:33,661
There's just so much
I wanna say.

1562
01:46:34,195 --> 01:46:35,764
But I'm not a poet.

1563
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:38,730
I don't have words.

1564
01:46:38,732 --> 01:46:40,502
I have music.

1565
01:46:50,844 --> 01:46:54,646
I'm so sorry I couldn't
be there to celebrate with you.

1566
01:46:54,648 --> 01:46:57,783
But I'm here in the Philippines,

1567
01:46:57,785 --> 01:47:01,586
spearheading the Montenegros'
Children's Education Initiative,

1568
01:47:01,588 --> 01:47:05,024
and, oh, I've been here
helping these kids

1569
01:47:05,026 --> 01:47:09,662
have a happier, better life,
and they adore me.

1570
01:47:09,664 --> 01:47:11,896
- Right?
- No.

1571
01:47:11,898 --> 01:47:13,032
When we first met,

1572
01:47:13,034 --> 01:47:15,067
I was the catch. Okay?

1573
01:47:15,069 --> 01:47:17,036
I was the football player.

1574
01:47:17,038 --> 01:47:18,770
I was the quarterback,
all right?

1575
01:47:18,772 --> 01:47:20,238
She didn't even make
cheerleader.

1576
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:21,907
She was on the spirit squad.

1577
01:47:21,909 --> 01:47:23,578
When I look at Leo...

1578
01:47:24,712 --> 01:47:25,981
When I look at Kate...

1579
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:29,951
When I look at Leo and Kate...

1580
01:47:43,897 --> 01:47:46,832
Right now, I'm backstage

1581
01:47:46,834 --> 01:47:48,766
at the Golden Pond
Retirement Home,

1582
01:47:48,768 --> 01:47:50,802
about five minutes from curtain.

1583
01:47:50,804 --> 01:47:53,104
I'm playing Hodel
in <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

1584
01:47:53,106 --> 01:47:55,576
And I thought now was a good time to talk about allowance.

1585
01:48:02,549 --> 01:48:06,719
<i>♪ Leo has the best spaghetti
I ever tasted ♪</i>

1586
01:48:06,721 --> 01:48:08,753
I have never in all my puff
been at a wedding

1587
01:48:08,755 --> 01:48:09,954
where there's been a free bar.

1588
01:48:09,956 --> 01:48:12,091
Usually, at the end, the
tries to settle up the bill.

1589
01:48:12,093 --> 01:48:13,292
And they're,
"Oh, no, I didn't have it.

1590
01:48:13,294 --> 01:48:14,859
"I only had beer,
you"

1591
01:48:14,861 --> 01:48:16,095
There's always a
at a wedding.

1592
01:48:17,597 --> 01:48:18,732
Leonardo.

1593
01:48:29,009 --> 01:48:31,745
Bobby has asked me
to read a prepared statement.

1594
01:48:33,748 --> 01:48:35,814
"I never cheated on my husband.

1595
01:48:35,816 --> 01:48:36,814
"I never would.

1596
01:48:36,816 --> 01:48:38,587
"No woman ever would."

1597
01:48:49,597 --> 01:48:51,095
- Mwah!
- Cheers.

1598
01:48:51,097 --> 01:48:52,730
Mmm.

1599
