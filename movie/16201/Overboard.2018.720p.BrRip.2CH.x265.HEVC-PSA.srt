Watch some sports
like real men.

15
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,883
This has 10 times the emotion
of your football.

16
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,954
It's ridiculous.

17
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:59,323
Hey. Sorry, some surfer
gave me wet money.

18
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:00,758
Well, here
are your deliveries.

19
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,695
Oh, and I would save
650 Cypress for last.

20
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:06,630
Canadian bacon
and pineapple? No. Ew.

00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:08,332
Hey, he's cute,
and you might have fun.

22
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't have time for fun.

23
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:11,335
Well, then
you're doing it wrong.

24
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:13,071
Add it to the list.

25
00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:14,638
It's not ridiculous.

26
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,141
These stories come
from real life.

27
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:17,775
Crazy things happen
all the time.

28
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:20,044
Come on,
back me up on this.

29
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:21,380
I don't watch
this shit.

30
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:23,542
I don't even hear it. It's
like working at my <i>abuela's.</i>

31
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:30,525
Huh.

32
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,827

34
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,665
Hey, girls,
come on, let's go!

35
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:41,833
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi, Mom!

36
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:43,938
Move! We gotta go!

37
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:48,873
Really, Mom? The sign?

38
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,007
Be embarrassed
in the car, okay?

39
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:52,376
I've got eight minutes to get
these pizzas across town.

40
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:53,580
Move!

41
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:55,880
How was school?

42
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:57,685
- Fine.
- Oh, don't tip 'em.

43
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:04,655
Change of plans, sir.

44
00:03:04,657 --> 00:03:06,991
We're just having
some minor mechanical issues.

45
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:09,828
We'll dock at the nearest
harbor for some repairs

46
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,161
and I'll arrange to have

47
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:13,064
the carpets
professionally cleaned.

48
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:15,699
Don't need to know how
the sausage is made, Colin!

49
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:18,104
Absolutely right, sir.

50
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:18,798
- Papa. Papa.
- Mmm-hmm.

51

<i>When swabbing fecal matter,</i>

<i>a nurse should take which
of the following precautions?</i>

53
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:08,846
- Bye, Mom!
- See ya, Mom!

54
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:10,815
All right, listen
to your grandma, okay?

55
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:11,750
Hi, Grandma!

56
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:13,517
And, hey, I want you
to take a bath, Olivia!

57
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,219
- Use soap.
- Okay.

58
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:16,288
You're not gonna
believe this.

59
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,856
Remember how I sang
that song from <i>Les Mis</i>

60
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:20,024
at the Saint James talent show

61
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:22,026
and everyone said
I was amazing?

62
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:23,995
Okay, Mom, can you just
type this up in an e-mail,

63
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:25,262
because I'm gonna be late
for my other job.

64
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:27,298
Turns out, a producer

65
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,202
from the Eugene Senior Theater
touring company was there.

66
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:32,771
He had tears.

67
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:35,305
Anyway, one of their leads
fell in the shower,

68
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:37,041
and they want me to step in.

69
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:39,110
What? When is this all
supposed to be happening?

70
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:41,146
I'm leaving tonight.
They're already in tech.

71
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:44,115
No! Mom, my nursing exam
is in less than a month

72
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:45,283
and you agreed to help.

73
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:49,219
I'm 72. If I don't follow
my dreams now, when will I?

74
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:52,123
Never, Mom!

75
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,825
The whole reason we moved here
is so I could study more.

76
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:56,127
I already failed
the exam once.

77
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,127
No, don't guilt me.

78
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,562
You're not the only one
with a dead husband.

79
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:01,865
Dad's not dead,
you're divorced!

80
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:04,168
Oh, and I'm gonna need you
to take care of Fiona.

81
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,303
The kennel won't take her.
She has crate anxiety.

82
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:08,839
You can't possibly
be this selfish.

83
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:11,308
I'm sorry, honey, but the
theater is calling me.

84
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,413
Oh! Literally.
They need my dress size.

85
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:19,220
Hi, there. Normally a zero,
but a two if I'm bloated.

86
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,959
Good night.

87
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:30,230
Hey, don't stay up too late.

88
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,920
Oh, God.

89
00:07:04,197 --> 00:07:06,430
Holy crap.

90
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:09,336
Here we are. I'll be
around if you need me.

91
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,247
<i>Guess where I am?</i>

92
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:24,014
Some dude's yacht.

93
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:25,149
You little tramp.

94
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:27,418
- I'm cleaning the carpets.
- Oh.

95
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,024
Oh, my God. Theresa,
look at this bathroom.

96
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,959
God, I could live in here!

97
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:34,324
Oh.

98
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:38,098
And they have candy.
Who has candy in the bathroom?

99
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:43,901
That's not candy.

100
00:07:43,903 --> 00:07:45,469
<i>Yeah, because nobody has candy
in the bathroom.</i>

101
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:47,505
- Oh, God.
- <i>Because it's a bathroom!</i>

102
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:49,343
<i>Okay, come on, show me more.
Wait, wait, wait.</i>

103
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:52,110
Is that the guy?
Is he married? He's cute.

104
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:53,510
And that's not even
a very good picture.

105
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:54,978
Hello, Theresa!

106
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,447
- Oh, God.
- Hi!

107
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,416
<i>By the way, she's single,
and horny.</i>

108
00:07:58,418 --> 00:08:00,250
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

109
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:01,685
I'll get out of here.

110
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:04,255
No, no, no. I should get up.
Busy day.

111
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:06,093
I've got a lot of...
Whew!

112
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:09,192
Really nothing to do.

113
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:11,966
Colin, I'm ready for
my Bloody Mary. Yeah.

114
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,401
Mostly Mary. Yeah.

115
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:22,406
Well, now you know.

116
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:25,108
I'm a grown man with
a tattoo on his butt.

117
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,144
Is that Speedy Gonzales?

118
00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:29,279
Do you know another cartoon
mouse with a sombrero?

119
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:35,152
I hate the pussycat.

120
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,523
Let me guess, you were, uh, a
little tipsy when you got that?

121
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,025
Not at all.

122
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:43,527
I love Speedy.
He's fast, he's charming.

123
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:45,363
He's Mexican.

124
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:47,065
He outsmarts the pussycat

125
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:49,434
and brings delicious
cheese to his people.

126
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:51,906
And he's just fun to look at.

127
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:54,472
My name is Leonardo.

128
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:57,211
Kate. Sullivan.

129
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:02,479
You're very attractive
for a carpet cleaning lady.

130
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:03,580
Yeah.

131
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:07,251
Although you maybe could do
something with your hair.

132
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:08,419
Yeah...

133
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:11,355
No, well, no, that's not it.
It's your face.

134
00:09:11,357 --> 00:09:13,590
Yeah. I mean, it's good.

135
00:09:13,592 --> 00:09:16,493
I wanna like it,
it's just...

136
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:19,265
It's just somehow less than
the sum of its parts.

137
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:23,233
What animal do people
say you look like?

138
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:25,302
Apologies, sir, I thought
you were up and about already.

139
00:09:25,304 --> 00:09:27,305
Ah, finally.
It's about time.

140
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:32,209
Um, have Chef Gerard prepare
breakfast. Then, fire him.

141
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:34,545
Of course, but perhaps we could
give him a few weeks' notice.

142
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:36,079
His wife's expecting.

143
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:37,484
But his food is boring.

144
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:39,987
Absolutely.

145
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:45,623
There you are,
sleepyhead. Hi.

146
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:49,093
Well, this is awkward.
We're wearing the same thing.

147
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:56,633
Boop! Boop!

148
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:58,201
Lead the way, girls!

149
00:09:58,203 --> 00:09:59,436
Okay.

150
00:09:59,438 --> 00:10:01,305
Boop! Boop!

151
00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:05,108
Boop!

152
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,314
Oh, try to hurry. I'm pretty
sure I'm gonna need the room.

153
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:14,451
- Excuse me, Captain?
- Yeah.

154
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:16,253
Checked the engine,
you're in luck.

155
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:18,522
It's just the anti-siphon
valve. No problem.

156
00:10:21,494 --> 00:10:23,294
I was just telling him

157
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:26,329
that I was right,
and that he's a dumbass.

158
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:28,266
Say, how'd this dude
make all his money, anyway?

159
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:29,600
He didn't.

160
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:32,469
His family owns the largest building
supply company in the world.

161
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:34,307
Now this is what
he does all day.

162
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:38,276
Chicken fight?

163
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:11,234
All right. Here's my info.

164
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:12,703
If you're ever in Norway,
look me up.

165
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:14,472
The summers are insane.

166
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:17,474
That's happening, Oddvar.
That's definitely happening.

167
00:12:17,476 --> 00:12:21,378
Hi. Excuse me, I was
told to clean in there.

168
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,247
Something about
a glitter bomb?

169
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:24,515
Is that gonna disturb you?

170
00:12:24,517 --> 00:12:25,949
No, not at all.

171
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:28,953
Hmm. I'm craving something.
What is it?

172
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:31,622
Excuse me,
are you talking to me?

173
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:34,492
Sweet, but not
too sweet. Hmm.

174
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:38,728
Is it mango? I'm pretty
sure it's mango.

175
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,400
No. No, wait, wait.
It's papaya.

176
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:43,733
Is it papaya?

177
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:45,670
I would have no way
of knowing that.

178
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:48,372
Of course.

179
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:50,343
Could you be a doll
and get me a little of both?

180
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:52,276
Hmm?

181
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:54,545
You know I was just hired
to do carpets, right?

182
00:12:54,547 --> 00:12:57,381
I don't see why that should prevent
you from getting me a little snack.

183
00:12:57,383 --> 00:13:00,517
Don't you have, like, 10,000
other people to do that for you?

184
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,320
Yeah. But you're right here.

185
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:04,421
Okay, I'm sorry, but I really
have to finish up

186
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:06,357
so I can pick my girls
up from school.

187
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,392
Shh.

188
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,733
Perhaps
you don't know who I am.

189
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:17,535
I know exactly who you are.

190
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:20,470
You showed me your ass and did
a number on my self-esteem.

191
00:13:20,472 --> 00:13:22,440
Then why don't
I have my fruit?

192
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,608
Beats me.
But I'm not getting it.

193
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,243
Okay. Fair enough.

194
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:27,310
You're fired.

195
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:30,614
For not getting you a mango?

196
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:31,781
Or a papaya.

197
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:33,850
Okay, you know what?
That's fine.

198
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:36,289
Just pay me
and I'll be on my way.

199
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,026
I'm not paying you or the "We
Care Carpet and Fabric Company."

200
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,328
Dude, you have
a toilet in there

201
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,530
that costs more than
I make in a year.

202
00:13:46,532 --> 00:13:49,733
You hired me to do a job.
I did it. You're paying me.

203
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:50,734
Nope.

204
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:53,470
Mr. Montenegro, ready
to ship out when you are.

205
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:56,209
Great! Push off.
The Pacific awaits.

206
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:58,378
Goodbye, Kate.

207
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,684
You are a horrible person.

208
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:08,585
<i>A first-class asshole!</i>

209
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:10,854
"A first-class asshole."

210
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:12,522
You're no charmer yourself.

211
00:14:12,524 --> 00:14:14,892
Oh, whoa! That stung.

212
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:18,628
You selfish,
condescending prick!

213
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,767
I bet you haven't worked a single day
in your entire, self-absorbed life.

214
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:29,540
And to think I was
this, this close,

215
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:31,511
to inviting you to join
us in the Jacuzzi.

216
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:36,079
There isn't enough
penicillin in the world!

217
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:39,916
No, no, wait.
No, no, no.

218
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:42,585
No. Don't untie the boat.

219
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:46,656
Excuse me, wait. Excuse me!
Captain! I'm still on board.

220
00:14:46,658 --> 00:14:48,592
Don't leave yet!

221
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:53,797
Women adore me. I'm charming,
and fit, and disease-free.

222
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,598
Oh, grow up.

223
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,868
You are a vain,
empty little man,

224
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,837
who'd be nothing
without his daddy's money.

225
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:02,772
Oh, no!

226
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:05,910
You gotta be kidding me!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait.

227
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:07,478
Better jump off.

228
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,815
No. No. I am not going
anywhere, until you,

229
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:14,484
or one of your butlers
or bimbos writes me a check.

230
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:17,787
Fine. Next stop,
San Francisco.

231
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:21,294
Fine. I'll be a pain in your
ass for the next 12 hours.

232
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:25,930
I guess I didn't
think this through.

233
00:15:25,932 --> 00:15:27,701
No, you didn't.

234
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,307
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

235
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:42,379
What the hell
is wrong with you?

236
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:43,848
Wait! My equipment.

237
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,319
Oh, of course.

238
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:47,517
Here you are.

239
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,590
No! No, no, no!
It's very expensive! No!

240
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:52,623
Oh!

241
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,759
Wait. I forgot something.
Your bucket.

242
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:57,463
- Fetch.
- No!

243
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:06,503
And just so you know,

244
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:09,473
my life is not empty!
Hmm?

245
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:13,477
Everyone wants my life
because it's meaningful.

246
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,815
I hate you!

247
00:16:15,648 --> 00:16:17,484
Goodbye.

248
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,625
Oh, God.

249
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:33,597
And now I owe the cleaning company
$3,000 for a new machine!

250
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:35,833
And they fired me.
He is the devil.

251
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:37,568
Whoa, who's the devil?

252
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,903
- Leonardo Montenegro.
- Who's that?

253
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:42,906
Says here he's the son of the
third richest man in the world.

254
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:46,509
A Latino? Hell yeah.
<i>Mi gente,</i> babe, showin' up.

255
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:48,912
Hey! Those are for the crew,
right? Not their boss?

256
00:16:48,914 --> 00:16:50,815
What are you talking about,
babe? I lost eight pounds.

257
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,977
Pretty soon I'm gonna be
breaking out my skinny shirts.

258
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,456
I love when he dances.

259
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,791
Bring back the Hasselbeck.

260
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:02,493
You know what I got
in my bank account?

261
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:06,497
$42. I need to get
another job. Like, tonight.

262
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:07,698
Bobby, are you hiring?

263
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,601
Yeah, sure, if you can haul
giant bags of concrete all day.

264
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:13,536
We could probably scrape
together a few bucks for you.

265
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:16,873
Just Benny started college
and somebody bought a boat!

266
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,642
Come on, babe,
we're gonna relitigate this?

267
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:20,678
I paid significantly
below market for that boat.

268
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,078
I had to buy it.
It was a steal.

269
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,948
Why am I even trying
to be a nurse?

270
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,783
I'm gonna be
delivering pizzas

271
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:27,651
and cleaning carpets
for the rest of my life.

272
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:29,556
Kate, don't say that.
Hey, look.

273
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:31,721
Have a garlic knot.

274
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:34,624
It makes everything just a
little bit better, I promise.

275
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:35,825
No, it doesn't.

276
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:37,431
No? I'll have one.

277
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:51,842
<i>Moretti
plays it back to midfield,</i>

278
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:53,576
<i>controlling the
pace as always.</i>

279
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:11,094
Oops.

280
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:13,096
Give me a second.
Don't turn of.

281
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,567
My condom drawer's empty.

282
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:18,936
I'll fix this.

283
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:22,072
<i>And the door was wide open,
but Magnusson hesitates...</i>

284
00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:25,709
I've told
the man repeatedly,

285
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:27,777
for the nine minutes
I am having my supper,

286
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:28,949
I am off the clock.

287
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:33,653
What am I paying
these people for?

288
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:36,053
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

289
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:05,684
Please be here.

290
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:09,789
Damn it,
I'm relentless.

291
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:15,928
Hmm.

292
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:35,815
Yes!

293
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:37,851
Five!

294
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:53,567
Whoa!

295
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:00,203
Help me, somebody!

296
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:02,672
Help me, please!

297
00:20:02,674 --> 00:20:04,711
Please, anyone, help!

298
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:07,210
Colin! Help!

299
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:09,148
- <i>Goal!</i>
- Yeah! Yeah!

300
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:13,586
Help me!

301
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:17,921
Help, Captain!

302
00:20:24,997 --> 00:20:27,701
Help! Help, somebody!

303
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:21,654
Rough night, pal?

304
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:31,495
Hey!

305
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,737
I don't wanna get
your hopes up, ma'am,

306
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,971
but we might
have found him.

307
00:21:41,973 --> 00:21:43,907
Like I told the officer,

308
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:47,076
I don't know what day it is.
I don't know where I was born.

309
00:21:47,078 --> 00:21:49,846
I don't even know my own name.

310
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:51,981
I remember nothing
except waking up

311
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:53,950
on a beach with
an ass full of sand.

312
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:55,151
You're a doctor, right?

313
00:21:55,153 --> 00:21:56,789
Well, fix it.

314
00:21:57,189 --> 00:21:58,725
And also...

315
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:02,828
Can I get a prettier nurse?

316
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:05,699
She is the pretty one.

317
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,905
<i>Probably caused by acute
trauma to the medial temporal lobe.</i>

318
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:19,176
Amnesia, really?
Is it permanent?

319
00:22:19,178 --> 00:22:21,545
Well, the brain
is a tricky thing.

320
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:23,780
He might get his memory back
in a couple of days

321
00:22:23,782 --> 00:22:25,783
or maybe never at all.

322
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:27,785
But to be honest,
we've only had

323
00:22:27,787 --> 00:22:29,920
one case of amnesia
here in Elk Cove

324
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:33,323
and that was a pretty young
woman back in the '80s.

325
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:36,325
Fingers crossed,
this is your brother,

326
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:39,095
but this is a beach town, we do
get our share of homeless here.

327
00:22:39,097 --> 00:22:41,864
So what happens if he's just some
poor guy living on the street?

328
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:45,169
Then he'll be shipped off to a
psychiatric facility up in Salem.

329
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:46,905
- Oh, my God.
- People get lost up there.

330
00:22:47,972 --> 00:22:49,206
Here we are.

331
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:52,276
And he really
remembers nothing?

332
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:53,678
Not a thing.

333
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,983
For the hundredth time,
I don't want chicken or beef.

334
00:22:58,017 --> 00:22:59,382
I want fish.

335
00:22:59,384 --> 00:23:03,222
A simple, grilled piece of sea bass.
With a buttery Chardonnay.

336
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,890
That's not my brother.

337
00:23:06,892 --> 00:23:09,026
Do it! Today!

338
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:10,594
What are you waiting for?

339
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,906
Oh, shit.

340
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:22,174
Shit! Ow.

341
00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:24,309
Shit!

342
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:26,276
Shit.

343
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:30,113
I got two weeks. I am having
a total anxiety attack.

344
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:32,048
I can't make
those girls move again.

345
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,383
Okay, honey, hang on. I got
a half a Xanax in my purse.

346
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:36,053
We're gonna
figure this out.

347
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:37,755
Kate. Look at this.

348
00:23:37,757 --> 00:23:42,124
I was searching for a used lawnmower in
the <i>Beachcomber,</i> and look what I found.

349
00:23:42,126 --> 00:23:45,895
Amnesia. Right here
in our little town.

350
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:47,864
I told you this stuff happens
all the time.

351
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:49,432
Dude has no idea who he is.

352
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:50,869
Oh, my God.

353
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:53,972
Oh, my God.
That's him.

354
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,341
That's the asshole!

355
00:23:57,343 --> 00:23:59,910
"An unidentified homeless man.

356
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:02,645
"General retrograde amnesia.

357
00:24:02,647 --> 00:24:04,381
"There was hope
a Mexico City woman

358
00:24:04,383 --> 00:24:07,217
"yachting nearby
might be his sister, but..."

359
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:09,452
That was his sister.

360
00:24:09,454 --> 00:24:10,653
Unbelievable.

361
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:12,189
I bet she's pretending
not to know him,

362
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:13,422
so she can take over
the company.

363
00:24:13,424 --> 00:24:15,861
They did that on
<i>Amor sin Maquillaje.</i>

364
00:24:16,095 --> 00:24:17,094
Okay.

365
00:24:17,096 --> 00:24:19,095
We are going down
to the hospital right now

366
00:24:19,097 --> 00:24:20,363
and getting the money
he owes me.

367
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:22,399
And add a little
for pain and suffering, too.

368
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:25,902
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna add a lot.
He treated me like crap.

369
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:27,203
Yeah, and I
need new cleats.

370
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:28,905
We're all gonna
get new cleats!

371
00:24:28,907 --> 00:24:29,974
Okay, wait.
Hey, Kate?

372
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:32,109
If he didn't pay you when
he knew who you were,

373
00:24:32,111 --> 00:24:34,080
what makes you think
he's gonna pay you now?

374
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,981
This is so frustrating!

375
00:24:38,983 --> 00:24:41,285
I hate rich people.
They get away with everything.

376
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:43,152
But you know what?
No, not this time.

377
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:46,055
Because I am not gonna
tell them who he is.

378
00:24:46,057 --> 00:24:48,060
I am just gonna let him
rot in there.

379
00:24:48,928 --> 00:24:51,260
Yeah, you could do that,

380
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:54,931
or you can be like them and take
advantage of the situation.

381
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:56,699
How? How could I do that?

382
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:01,875
What?

383
00:25:11,016 --> 00:25:12,349
State or federal?

384
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:14,517
All right, hey, girls. I'm
gonna need you to help your mom

385
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,986
dig up some old family photos.

386
00:25:15,988 --> 00:25:19,088
I'm gonna ask Bobby to loan us a box
of his useless, skinny clothes,

387
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,458
because I have an idea
that you're gonna hate,

388
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,931
but you're wrong because
it is poetic in its justice.

389
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:28,731
- Hi.
- Hi.

390
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:32,035
I'm here to pick up my
husband, the man with amnesia.

391
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:33,970
Oh. You must be Kate?

392
00:25:33,972 --> 00:25:36,440
Dr. Fletcher was so excited
to get your call.

393
00:25:36,442 --> 00:25:37,442
We all were.

394
00:25:38,277 --> 00:25:39,345
I'll go get him.

395
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:44,046
Almost forgot. Here's
everything he had with him.

396
00:25:44,048 --> 00:25:45,050
Thank you.

397
00:25:55,027 --> 00:25:57,059
Wait, okay,
you're just nervous.

398
00:25:57,061 --> 00:25:58,194
Yeah, really nervous.

399
00:25:58,196 --> 00:26:00,430
This is crazy
and probably illegal.

400
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:04,433
Kate, come on.
Where are you going?

401
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:06,469
Look, do you wanna get evicted?

402
00:26:06,471 --> 00:26:07,705
Of course not.

403
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:10,474
Okay, well, then stick to the script.
We have a plan.

404
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:13,276
One month until the test.
Bobby will hire him,

405
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,013
and he'll be an extra paycheck,
so you have time to study.

406
00:26:16,015 --> 00:26:19,216
I barely know the guy.
I am not gonna let him move in.

407
00:26:19,218 --> 00:26:21,250
But you're gonna
be there, studying.

408
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:22,219
That's why it's genius.

409
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:24,086
He'll never have to be
alone with the kids.

410
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:25,154
Come on.

411
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:27,059
You're doing this
for your girls.

412
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:30,227
I'm doing this for my girls.

413
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:31,194
There you go.

414
00:26:31,196 --> 00:26:34,132
Okay, here, use this.
Bobby won't even notice.

415
00:26:35,634 --> 00:26:37,299
Good news.

416
00:26:37,301 --> 00:26:40,202
Your wife has come
to take you home.

417
00:26:40,204 --> 00:26:43,241
Finally.
It's about time.

418
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:46,479
What? Wait.

419
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,480
I'm married?

420
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:52,985
Hi, honey.

421
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:59,291
I do not recognize this lady.

422
00:27:01,093 --> 00:27:02,592
I was afraid
this would happen.

423
00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:05,398
Did you bring the materials
we talked about?

424
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:10,366
I know this must be
very disorienting,

425
00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:12,538
but here's our
marriage license.

426
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,407
My name is Leo Sullivan?

427
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:20,242
Yes. Your great-grandfather...

428
00:27:20,244 --> 00:27:24,413
Your great-great-grandfather,
Finbar Sullivan,

429
00:27:24,415 --> 00:27:31,121
emigrated from Ireland, to fight
for Mexico in the war of 1846.

430
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:36,461
That's gobbledygook!
It can't be true.

431
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:42,565
Honey, we have been
married for 15 years.

432
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:45,102
We have three
wonderful daughters.

433
00:27:45,104 --> 00:27:48,337
No, there's no way
I have children.

434
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:50,140
And if I did,
they'd be sons.

435
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:51,540
I'm just saying.

436
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:56,181
I have your passport,
your birth certificate...

437
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:58,347
Oh...

438
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:00,717
Here's a photo
from our honeymoon.

439
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,321
We went to Reno?

440
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:05,188
Now I know you're lying.

441
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,490
Leo! Sweetie,
stop puzzling.

442
00:28:07,492 --> 00:28:08,359
I'm puzzling.

443
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:12,429
You and I are
Mr. and Mrs. Leo Sullivan.

444
00:28:12,431 --> 00:28:14,067
We met in Cancun.

445
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,333
You were a tour guide.

446
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:18,668
I was working
on a cruise ship.

447
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,737
Is any of this
ringing a bell?

448
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:22,706
Nope. Nothing.

449
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,307
We dated
every time I docked.

450
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:27,344
We would get
frozen yogurt

451
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:30,247
and watch the sunset
over the Playa Tortugas.

452
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:32,181
That's where
we fell in love.

453
00:28:32,183 --> 00:28:34,284
Sounds like you're
a romantic, Leo.

454
00:28:34,286 --> 00:28:35,619
Look, look, look.

455
00:28:35,621 --> 00:28:38,488
I admit there are many things
I've forgotten,

456
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,590
but from the depths
of my soul,

457
00:28:40,592 --> 00:28:42,491
I know I'm not married
to this woman.

458
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:46,263
So, unless I see
some real proof,

459
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:48,701
I'm getting a slice
of pie at the cafeteria, hmm?

460
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:52,270
Good luck, crazy lady.

461
00:28:53,204 --> 00:28:55,705
Wait, wait. Wait. Honey?

462
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:58,542
I didn't wanna say this,

463
00:28:58,544 --> 00:29:00,544
because I know
it embarrasses you.

464
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:05,384
But you have a tattoo of a cartoon
mouse on your right butt cheek.

465
00:29:05,951 --> 00:29:07,185
No, I don't.

466
00:29:19,198 --> 00:29:20,596
You're really my wife?

467
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:22,701
For better or worse, baby.

468
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:53,563
All right, here we are.

469
00:29:53,565 --> 00:29:57,603
I know it doesn't look like
much, but it's full of love.

470
00:30:07,445 --> 00:30:08,580
I'm poor?

471
00:30:08,814 --> 00:30:10,182
Yup.

472
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:17,190
Come on in.

473
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:21,757
Oh, Dad!

474
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,526
- Daddy!
- We missed you so much.

475
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,599
I'm so glad you're okay.

476
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:31,867
Emily?

477
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:33,269
Hey.

478
00:30:33,271 --> 00:30:35,337
She's too cool to admit it,

479
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:38,475
but she was
the most worried of all.

480
00:30:38,477 --> 00:30:42,248
I'm sorry, I
don't recognize any of you.

481
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:44,546
Oh, come on.

482
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:48,485
Molly, Olivia, Emily,

483
00:30:48,487 --> 00:30:50,423
your three musketeers?

484
00:30:51,455 --> 00:30:52,488
No.

485
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,294
Uh... I've got homework.

486
00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:02,766
How come they don't
look like me?

487
00:31:02,768 --> 00:31:04,500
Oh, sweetie...

488
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:06,402
We had trouble
getting pregnant,

489
00:31:06,404 --> 00:31:08,374
so we had to use
a sperm donor.

490
00:31:09,674 --> 00:31:10,840
I'm sterile?

491
00:31:10,842 --> 00:31:12,842
That doesn't change a thing.

492
00:31:12,844 --> 00:31:14,678
You are still their father.

493
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,780
You've done everything
for this family.

494
00:31:17,782 --> 00:31:21,386
Taken two, even three jobs.

495
00:31:21,686 --> 00:31:22,620
I work?

496
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:24,787
How do you think
we can pay for all of this?

497
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:28,658
I'm afraid to ask, but
what do I do for a living?

498
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,660
Well, before
you got laid off,

499
00:31:30,662 --> 00:31:32,696
you were a foreman at
the poultry processing plant.

500
00:31:32,698 --> 00:31:34,363
Luckily, Bobby,

501
00:31:34,365 --> 00:31:36,665
my boss's husband,
you met bowling,

502
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:39,335
gave you a job
at his construction company.

503
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:42,671
It is awful, backbreaking
work, I know,

504
00:31:42,673 --> 00:31:44,507
but we are lucky
to have it.

505
00:31:46,377 --> 00:31:49,414
I need a drink.
Lots of them.

506
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:55,552
What? Please don't tell me I'm sober?

507
00:31:55,554 --> 00:31:57,487
You had your three-year chip,

508
00:31:57,489 --> 00:31:58,755
but then you relapsed

509
00:31:58,757 --> 00:32:01,857
and you ended up on that beach.

510
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:06,528
So what is that? Four days?
You got four days, honey.

511
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,667
- We're still really proud of you.
- Mm-hmm.

512
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:10,734
I see.

513
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:13,439
No alcohol. Whatsoever.

514
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:15,671
<i>Nada.</i>

515
00:32:15,673 --> 00:32:17,841
I need to use the restroom.

516
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:20,876
I assume it's that room
over there with the toilet.

517
00:32:20,878 --> 00:32:24,146
Look at you, babe.
It's all coming back!

518
00:32:26,451 --> 00:32:27,519
Boop.

519
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:29,986
I don't like that.

520
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:33,390
One more.

521
00:32:33,392 --> 00:32:34,894
Boop, boop!

522
00:32:49,807 --> 00:32:51,711
This can't be my life.

523
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:15,367
Honey!

524
00:33:18,036 --> 00:33:19,904
- Hey!
- Hi.

525
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:23,475
Running low on toilet paper.

526
00:33:24,576 --> 00:33:25,874
Under the sink!

527
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:26,979
Of course.

528
00:33:29,748 --> 00:33:31,514
Yes.

529
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:33,786
Under the sink,
of course.

530
00:33:41,492 --> 00:33:43,793
Please keep my beloved brother
in your prayers

531
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:45,027
as you head back to Mexico.

532
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:47,796
I'm going to stay here
until I find him.

533
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:49,801
Alive or...

534
00:33:54,806 --> 00:33:57,910
Good thoughts, people.
Only good thoughts.

535
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:06,850
I was fat?

536
00:34:06,852 --> 00:34:11,954
Um, yeah. You didn't make the best
decisions when you were drinking, honey.

537
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:13,655
Tomorrow
we're going to Goodwill.

538
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:15,057
Bobby's skinny clothes
are not skinny.

539
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:17,793
I assume these Seahawks
are some kind of sports team

540
00:34:17,795 --> 00:34:19,528
and I'm a big fan,

541
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,796
because most of my clothes

542
00:34:20,798 --> 00:34:23,099
have this God-awful
green and blue bird on it.

543
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:25,901
Football, Dad.
It's our thing.

544
00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:27,970
We watch every game together.

545
00:34:27,972 --> 00:34:29,838
Even when I haven't
done my homework.

546
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,407
Hey. Everyone does
their homework.

547
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,677
Including me. And right now I've gotta
memorize protocols for thoracic surgery.

548
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,581
So, Leo, why don't you get
dinner started?

549
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:41,918
What? Cook? Me? Cook?

550
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Sweetheart, I know
you had a head injury,

551
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:46,958
but we made a deal.

552
00:34:47,893 --> 00:34:49,992
While I'm studying for my exam,

553
00:34:49,994 --> 00:34:52,729
you keep the house running.

554
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:55,532
But I don't even know
how to turn on the stove.

555
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:58,867
Oh! Honey, come on.

556
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:01,873
Salad, pasta. There's a jar
of sauce in the fridge.

557
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:08,077
Holy cow.

558
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,615
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
uh, pardon me.

559
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,524
Nothing like an icy cold beer
on a warm day.

560
00:35:19,757 --> 00:35:21,059
Mmm, mmm.

561
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:25,498
Yes.

562
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:52,621
Ugh!

563
00:35:52,623 --> 00:35:54,190
Is this the sauce
we always use?

564
00:35:54,192 --> 00:35:57,126
It tastes like red nothing.

565
00:35:57,128 --> 00:35:59,963
And how are you supposed to tell
when the noodles are done?

566
00:35:59,965 --> 00:36:00,966
Taste one.

567
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,944
Mmm. Mmm.

568
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,815
Hot, hot, hot!

569
00:36:24,688 --> 00:36:26,222
When's the maid coming?

570
00:36:26,224 --> 00:36:29,028
As I'm saying this,
I fear I'm the maid.

571
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:32,830
No one cleans
like you do, sweetie.

572
00:36:38,103 --> 00:36:40,003
This is awesome.

573
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:41,403
Honey?

574
00:36:41,405 --> 00:36:44,809
Try not to dilly dally.
We're all super hungry.

575
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:49,112
I like having a dad around.

576
00:36:49,114 --> 00:36:51,414
He's not your dad, genius.

577
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:53,749
You agreed to have
a good attitude.

578
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:56,119
And I'll have a great attitude
if you let him babysit,

579
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:58,987
so I'm not stuck here watching
these guys all the time.

580
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:01,657
We went over this.
I don't want him to babysit.

581
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:03,992
Why does he only get
to do your chores?

582
00:37:03,994 --> 00:37:06,963
I wanna go to the pool like
every other kid in my class.

583
00:37:06,965 --> 00:37:09,065
I don't care!
He's not babysitting.

584
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:10,307
'Cause you think
he's a pervert?

585
00:37:11,835 --> 00:37:12,901
Of course not!

586
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:14,237
What's a pervert?

587
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,673
- Nothing.
- Then can I have one?

588
00:37:16,675 --> 00:37:20,144
No! He's not babysitting.
End of story.

589
00:37:21,012 --> 00:37:22,211
Good night.

590
00:37:22,213 --> 00:37:24,650
I never get anything.

591
00:37:28,152 --> 00:37:31,723
So, is this where
the magic happens?

592
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,025
You don't even remember
who I am,

593
00:37:36,027 --> 00:37:37,896
and you still wanna
have sex with me?

594
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:40,899
Yes. Very much.

595
00:37:42,132 --> 00:37:43,932
So, basically,

596
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:46,735
you wanna have sex
with a complete stranger?

597
00:37:46,737 --> 00:37:48,871
Yes. Very much.

598
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:50,807
All right, big boy.

599
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:51,944
You know the rules.

600
00:37:53,978 --> 00:37:56,248
What? Hey, wait, wait, wait.

601
00:37:57,315 --> 00:37:58,851
I'm not sleeping with you?

602
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,150
You need 30 days
clean and sober.

603
00:38:02,152 --> 00:38:05,790
You and your sponsor came up with that.
It was your idea, not mine.

604
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:08,958
What are you saying?

605
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,728
- Boop!
- You're gonna make me sleep on the couch?

606
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,195
Nope. We tried that last time

607
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:15,298
and you ended up
in the liquor cabinet.

608
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:20,005
So, where am I sleeping?

609
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:23,675
Here you go.

610
00:38:24,275 --> 00:38:26,211
You have a cot and everything.

611
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:29,211
All right,

612
00:38:29,213 --> 00:38:32,248
so I'm gonna lock up
the house for the night.

613
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,820
If you need to use the bathroom,

614
00:38:36,121 --> 00:38:37,222
here you go.

615
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,858
I'm a nobody.

616
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:45,894
A poor, sterile, drunk nobody,

617
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:47,764
who has to pee in a bottle.

618
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:49,932
But you're my nobody.

619
00:38:49,934 --> 00:38:53,536
All right, Bobby's picking you up
in the morning, bright and early.

620
00:38:53,538 --> 00:38:56,238
So you need to get
some rest, okay?

621
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,844
Oh, and watch out for bears.

622
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:56,335
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

623
00:39:59,436 --> 00:40:01,170
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you.

624
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:03,139
Yeah, don't spill on it.

625
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:05,043
It's a classic and everything.

626
00:40:06,844 --> 00:40:08,246
Seriously, they're hard to find.

627
00:40:14,184 --> 00:40:15,851
<i>Okay, everybody.</i>

628
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:17,052
This is Leo.

629
00:40:17,054 --> 00:40:19,054
Burro. Burrito.

630
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:21,090
Vito, because he loves
<i>The Godfather.</i>

631
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:22,458
This is my worthless nephew,
Jason.

632
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,228
We call him Lucky, because
he's lucky to have a job.

633
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,164
And 'cause I got hit by
lightning. Twice. For real.

634
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:29,365
I shouldn't even be here.

635
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,367
Yeah. Gordo was like,
"Whoa, shit!"

636
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:34,070
Bro, you don't get
to call me that, okay?

637
00:40:34,072 --> 00:40:36,371
And don't be so cocky.
I used to look just like you.

638
00:40:36,373 --> 00:40:38,974
The hair, the abs,
the little bedroom eyes.

639
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:41,043
You definitely don't
get to call me that.

640
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:43,765
You gotta work for me at
least six months, okay?

641
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,930
Come on, we got
a pool to dig. Let's go.

642
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:04,369
Hey.

643
00:41:06,204 --> 00:41:10,273
Listen, I'm pretty sure
I've never worked construction.

644
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:14,010
So, I might be more suited
for running errands,

645
00:41:14,012 --> 00:41:16,012
or maybe
some light office work.

646
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:17,979
I could be the guy
who gets the muffins.

647
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:19,382
Look, I got your back,
all right?

648
00:41:19,384 --> 00:41:21,684
- I'll go easy on you.
- Good.

649
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:23,088
Great.

650
00:41:31,161 --> 00:41:32,360
Yo!

651
00:41:32,362 --> 00:41:34,365
Any of this jogging your memory,
Lady Hands?

652
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:40,369
After this I got
a real easy job for you.

653
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:42,137
No, I'm just kidding, bro.

654
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,326
Uh...

655
00:42:14,237 --> 00:42:16,040
No, no, no.

656
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:57,045
- Coffee.
- Yes.

657
00:42:57,047 --> 00:42:58,280
Thank you.

658
00:42:58,282 --> 00:42:59,284
You're welcome.

659
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:01,217
Look at this guy.

660
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:04,153
He's got it all dialed in,
with his espresso machine

661
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:05,524
and that sweet little peach.

662
00:43:06,523 --> 00:43:09,090
That's gonna be me one day.

663
00:43:09,092 --> 00:43:11,028
You can come over
whenever you want, bro.

664
00:43:13,231 --> 00:43:15,630
Hey, guys?

665
00:43:15,632 --> 00:43:19,367
Can I get you to haul the dirt
on the other side of the house?

666
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:20,802
I know it's longer,

667
00:43:20,804 --> 00:43:23,724
but Nadia and I are trying
to have a quiet morning.

668
00:43:24,574 --> 00:43:26,608
- Right.
- No speak English.

669
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:29,378
Sorry.
I will talk to Bobby.

670
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,382
<i>Si.</i> Bobby.

671
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:35,119
I love doing that.

672
00:44:36,146 --> 00:44:39,648
Remember, when you're
washing the jersey, cold water.

673
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:42,554
You listen.
Gentle cycle. Okay?

674
00:44:44,322 --> 00:44:46,354
<i>Bueno.</i>

675
00:44:46,356 --> 00:44:49,258
Hey, respecting
the wash instructions

676
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,193
is the best way
to respect the team.

677
00:44:52,195 --> 00:44:54,065
And no reds, they tend to bleed!

678
00:44:59,704 --> 00:45:03,341
Tortured, tired, thirsty.

679
00:45:05,742 --> 00:45:09,177
Hi, honey!
How was your first day?

680
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:10,648
Terrible. My body.

681
00:45:11,615 --> 00:45:15,483
Pain. Every. Part.

682
00:45:15,485 --> 00:45:17,186
Oh.

683
00:45:17,188 --> 00:45:18,686
I was in the car...

684
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:25,293
And I said, "What?"

685
00:45:25,295 --> 00:45:26,595
Do we need to take him
to the hospital?

686
00:45:26,597 --> 00:45:28,363
- I said, "Bobby..."
- No, no, no. No.

687
00:45:28,365 --> 00:45:30,733
He is fine.
He just needs some rest.

688
00:45:30,735 --> 00:45:32,700
Rest. Rest.

689
00:45:32,702 --> 00:45:34,403
Oh, that's right.

690
00:45:34,405 --> 00:45:36,505
Dirt is...

691
00:45:36,507 --> 00:45:38,606
You know what? Why don't you
take a few minutes,

692
00:45:38,608 --> 00:45:41,445
before you get started on all the
things you have to do tonight?

693
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:45,514
What? There's more?

694
00:45:45,516 --> 00:45:48,416
I know you're
having trouble remembering,

695
00:45:48,418 --> 00:45:50,351
so I made you a list.

696
00:45:50,353 --> 00:45:51,487
No, no, no.

697
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:55,257
It's physically impossible
for me to get off this couch.

698
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:57,525
I mean, my legs are
no longer functioning.

699
00:45:57,527 --> 00:45:59,461
Look. Look.

700
00:45:59,463 --> 00:46:01,666
I want, but I can't.

701
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,568
And even if I could move...

702
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:09,374
I wouldn't want to do any of
the vile things on this list.

703
00:46:11,442 --> 00:46:13,344
There's a couple more
on the back, too.

704
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:36,565
I know that guy.
How do I know that guy?

705
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:38,737
Hey. Do you work
at Jiffy Lube?

706
00:46:40,704 --> 00:46:42,373
God, I hope not.

707
00:46:44,307 --> 00:46:46,277
This is gonna drive me crazy.

708
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:12,635
Is this new sauce?
It tastes different.

709
00:47:12,637 --> 00:47:15,604
Yeah.
I added a few things.

710
00:47:15,606 --> 00:47:18,706
Some chopped onion,
a little red pepper

711
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:21,342
and a pinch of something
called cumin.

712
00:47:21,344 --> 00:47:25,313
I couldn't bear another bowl
of that tasteless slop.

713
00:47:25,315 --> 00:47:27,218
I like it.
I like it a lot.

714
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:28,719
It's better, right?

715
00:47:29,387 --> 00:47:30,320
I don't know.

716
00:47:30,322 --> 00:47:32,621
I feel like we've been
having pasta too much.

717
00:47:32,623 --> 00:47:34,722
Maybe you should
mix it up a little.

718
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:38,459
Okay, I'm gonna take
mine up to study.

719
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:41,766
Hey, after you clean the kitchen,
don't forget, it's garbage day.

720
00:47:48,438 --> 00:47:51,643
It's entirely clear to me now why
I blocked out my life, Fiona.

721
00:47:53,311 --> 00:47:54,813
It's a hideous existence.

722
00:47:58,815 --> 00:48:00,715
Good night, you guys.
I love you.

723
00:48:00,717 --> 00:48:02,477
- Good night, Mom.
- Love you.

724
00:48:06,923 --> 00:48:10,325
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
Aren't you exhausted?

725
00:48:10,327 --> 00:48:12,764
Who would use exhaustion
as an excuse to not make love?

726
00:48:14,498 --> 00:48:15,697
Everybody.

727
00:48:16,735 --> 00:48:21,570
To the shed. I know. I know.
It's hard for me, too.

728
00:48:21,572 --> 00:48:22,774
Nice work today.

729
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,827
Turn it off! Turn it off!

730
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:48,365
Turn it off!

731
00:48:52,135 --> 00:48:54,436
Yo, I'm
gonna post this on my Snapchat.

732
00:48:54,438 --> 00:48:56,405
I'm gonna make you
a little beaver, bro.

733
00:48:56,407 --> 00:48:58,139
How come we always
get the shit jobs?

734
00:48:58,141 --> 00:49:00,141
Because you're unskilled laborers!

735
00:49:00,143 --> 00:49:02,443
Land of the free,
no land of the free lunch.

736
00:49:08,552 --> 00:49:11,519
Okay. You are a genius.

737
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:13,454
I got seven hours
of sleep last night,

738
00:49:13,456 --> 00:49:15,858
and guess what
he's making for dinner?

739
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,459
Chicken skewers, coconut rice.

740
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:20,862
Aw, I want a fake husband.

741
00:49:20,864 --> 00:49:22,764
Thank you. Thank you.

742
00:49:22,766 --> 00:49:25,566
I got more studying done this
week than I have in months.

743
00:49:25,568 --> 00:49:26,901
Maybe next time I ask you
to commit a crime,

744
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:28,440
you won't fight me on it.

745
00:50:59,262 --> 00:51:00,963
Bro,
you're lucky you have amnesia.

746
00:51:00,965 --> 00:51:02,498
I remember when I thought
my nephew

747
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,898
was actually gonna
do something with his life.

748
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,140
Music is something. I'm an artist.

749
00:51:06,737 --> 00:51:07,936
You're sleeping
on my couch, bro.

750
00:51:07,938 --> 00:51:08,836
Yeah, well,
that tune's gonna change

751
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:10,838
when I thank you
at the Grammys, Gordo.

752
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,940
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

753
00:51:11,942 --> 00:51:14,543
You better pick it up, dawg.
You know what I'm saying?

754
00:51:14,545 --> 00:51:17,079
'Cause the Diaz metabolism
slows down around 30.

755
00:51:17,081 --> 00:51:18,280
See this right here?

756
00:51:18,282 --> 00:51:21,983
It's not gonna get you on the charts, dawg.

757
00:51:21,985 --> 00:51:23,151
I got some work
I don't feel like doing.

758
00:51:23,153 --> 00:51:25,553
Why do you even wear that hard hat, man?

759
00:52:14,003 --> 00:52:16,003
"Act like a man."

760
00:52:22,012 --> 00:52:23,132
Act like a man.

761
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,856
Act like a man!

762
00:52:38,996 --> 00:52:41,128
- See you tomorrow, Bobby.
- Okay, brother.

763
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,934
Hey, remember, don't tell
Theresa about the chicken parm.

764
00:53:02,186 --> 00:53:03,555
Hey.

765
00:53:04,054 --> 00:53:05,720
Hey.

766
00:53:05,722 --> 00:53:07,025
I got you something.

767
00:53:07,824 --> 00:53:08,960
Frozen yogurt.

768
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:12,661
Like the old days on the Playa.

769
00:53:12,663 --> 00:53:14,666
- What?
- On the Playa Tortugas.

770
00:53:16,132 --> 00:53:17,833
Oh, oh.

771
00:53:17,835 --> 00:53:20,802
Right. Yeah, the sunsets.

772
00:53:20,804 --> 00:53:23,804
- Yeah.
- Yes. Good times.

773
00:53:23,806 --> 00:53:26,407
I couldn't remember
which flavors we liked,

774
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:28,242
so I got an assortment.

775
00:53:28,244 --> 00:53:30,614
Thanks. This was

776
00:53:31,181 --> 00:53:33,148
really nice of you.

777
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:36,688
I know I haven't been the
easiest to live with lately,

778
00:53:37,788 --> 00:53:40,856
but I'm gonna try
a little harder.

779
00:53:40,858 --> 00:53:45,129
I can't promise a lot harder,
but maybe I'll surprise myself.

780
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:48,966
Well, keep doing this.

781
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,737
Maybe next time,
bring some toppings.

782
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:56,737
Mmm.

783
00:53:56,739 --> 00:53:58,742
Mango. I love mango.

784
00:53:59,777 --> 00:54:00,979
Have I always loved mango?

785
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,146
As long as I've known you.

786
00:54:04,148 --> 00:54:05,617
Ah, yes.

787
00:54:07,684 --> 00:54:09,150
When we were young

788
00:54:09,152 --> 00:54:11,221
and couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

789
00:54:18,228 --> 00:54:19,760
No.

790
00:54:19,762 --> 00:54:20,896
Okay.

791
00:54:20,898 --> 00:54:24,099
Well... I'll be in my shed.

792
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:25,803
Trying to have a good attitude.

793
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:28,038
Just me and the spiders.

794
00:54:28,871 --> 00:54:29,873
Oh.

795
00:54:31,474 --> 00:54:32,876
Forgot my bathroom.

796
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,650
Whew. Whew!

797
00:55:22,025 --> 00:55:26,894
I'm calling to get a death
certificate for Leonardo Montenegro.

798
00:55:26,896 --> 00:55:29,232
He died a couple of weeks ago
in a shark attack.

799
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:34,970
Yes. An attack by a shark fish?

800
00:55:34,972 --> 00:55:36,771
I think I'm saying
that correctly.

801
00:55:50,286 --> 00:55:52,022
Montenegro.

802
00:55:58,262 --> 00:55:59,297
Burro.

803
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,032
Burrito.

804
00:56:09,373 --> 00:56:10,742
Hey! Hey!

805
00:56:23,253 --> 00:56:25,186
- Thanks, Bobby.
- You got it, bro.

806
00:56:26,856 --> 00:56:28,055
- All right.
- Hey!

807
00:56:28,057 --> 00:56:29,257
- Hey!
- Hey, sweetie!

808
00:56:29,259 --> 00:56:30,260
<i>Bueno.</i>

809
00:56:31,094 --> 00:56:33,028
Oi, remember Hasselbeck.

810
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,767
He's way more mobile
than people give him credit for.

811
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,133
Hey.

812
00:56:39,135 --> 00:56:42,840
- Why aren't you riding?
- It's no fun with training wheels.

813
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:47,175
I never taught you
to ride a bike?

814
00:56:47,177 --> 00:56:50,177
It's okay. Some dads
can't be around that much.

815
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:51,782
No, it's not okay.

816
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:56,050
I'm gonna fix this. Right now.

817
00:56:56,052 --> 00:56:57,788
Let me just put this away. Okay?

818
00:56:59,956 --> 00:57:01,856
What are you doing here?

819
00:57:01,858 --> 00:57:04,025
They got us working bankers'
hours today.

820
00:57:04,027 --> 00:57:05,193
Whatever those are.

821
00:57:05,195 --> 00:57:08,396
So then it's cool if you
watch those guys,

822
00:57:08,398 --> 00:57:10,197
so I can go to the pool?

823
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:11,935
Yeah, sure. Why not?

824
00:57:12,335 --> 00:57:13,370
Thanks, Dad.

825
00:57:15,038 --> 00:57:17,238
- Hey, Mom.
<i>- You're gonna be blown away.</i>

826
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:21,909
<i>Modern Senior</i> magazine said
my performance stole the show.

827
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:25,246
And the Saint Jude wellness
newsletter featured me on the cover.

828
00:57:25,248 --> 00:57:28,316
That certainly justifies
leaving me without childcare.

829
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:29,483
Life's short, Kate.

830
00:57:29,485 --> 00:57:31,318
You gotta do
what makes you happy.

831
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,519
<i>I don't wanna have regrets</i>

832
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:35,090
<i>just because I didn't do
what I wanted to do.</i>

833
00:57:35,092 --> 00:57:36,391
<i>You'll understand
someday, honey.</i>

834
00:57:36,393 --> 00:57:38,193
Shit! I gotta go, Mom.

835
00:57:38,195 --> 00:57:39,961
Everyone's looking.

836
00:57:39,963 --> 00:57:41,061
I don't care!

837
00:57:41,063 --> 00:57:45,367
I asked you for one month,
just watch your sisters.

838
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:48,103
And we don't even know
anything about this guy.

839
00:57:48,105 --> 00:57:50,405
Whose fault is that? I didn't
bring him into the house.

840
00:57:50,407 --> 00:57:52,039
That's not the point.

841
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:54,045
And I'll tell you why
in two minutes.

842
00:58:00,983 --> 00:58:03,150
We're not done
talking about this!

843
00:58:03,152 --> 00:58:05,686
And because of you,
their pizza was cold

844
00:58:05,688 --> 00:58:07,488
and they gave me a lousy tip.

845
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:10,460
Maybe you got a bad tip
because you run like a duck.

846
00:58:11,695 --> 00:58:14,061
You better hope
everything's okay.

847
00:58:14,063 --> 00:58:17,432
I hate this. I hate this
whole thing. It's so stupid.

848
00:58:21,405 --> 00:58:23,271
I love the Seahawks!

849
00:58:23,273 --> 00:58:26,240
Our team just ran the ball
to the finish line.

850
00:58:26,242 --> 00:58:27,409
The end zone.
We've been over this.

851
00:58:27,411 --> 00:58:30,045
Oh, right. Touchdown.

852
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:31,479
It's coming back slowly.

853
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:35,249
See, Mom, everything's fine.
No one died.

854
00:58:35,251 --> 00:58:39,155
Oh, and, Kate, I got some of the guys
to help me fix that leak in the roof.

855
00:58:40,123 --> 00:58:42,023
And you unpacked the boxes?

856
00:58:42,025 --> 00:58:45,126
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And I found these pillows.

857
00:58:45,128 --> 00:58:47,228
The couch needed
a splash of color.

858
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:50,331
What?

859
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:53,937
"Little by little, the bird
builds its nest." It's French.

860
00:58:54,438 --> 00:58:56,440
Wait. I speak French.

861
00:58:57,574 --> 00:58:59,043
Why do I speak French?

862
00:59:00,277 --> 00:59:01,443
Uh...

863
00:59:01,445 --> 00:59:05,112
Well, you were a tour guide,

864
00:59:05,114 --> 00:59:09,117
and it's well-known
that Parisians love Cancun.

865
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,391
For it's chips and salsa
and its flamenco dancers.

866
00:59:15,525 --> 00:59:18,226
Thanks for humiliating me
for nothing.

867
00:59:18,228 --> 00:59:22,296
Hey! Hey, we had a deal,
and you didn't stick to it.

868
00:59:22,298 --> 00:59:23,298
You're grounded.

869
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,568
Who cares? I'm basically
a prisoner here anyway!

870
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:29,073
- For a week!
- Kate, Kate, Kate. Hey.

871
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:32,106
Can I talk to you for a sec?

872
00:59:32,108 --> 00:59:35,445
Okay, listen, you remember
what it's like to be 13.

873
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:39,046
I don't, but you probably do.

874
00:59:39,048 --> 00:59:40,447
What are you getting at?

875
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:42,117
And no phone!

876
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:45,086
Hey, hey, I just think
maybe you're being...

877
00:59:45,088 --> 00:59:47,222
I don't know,
a little hard on her.

878
00:59:47,224 --> 00:59:49,324
Don't tell me how
to raise my kids.

879
00:59:49,326 --> 00:59:51,329
"Your kids"?

880
00:59:52,061 --> 00:59:53,293
"Your kids"?

881
00:59:53,295 --> 00:59:54,429
Hey. Listen.

882
00:59:54,431 --> 00:59:58,032
Just because those girls
were not conceived with my seed,

883
00:59:58,034 --> 01:00:00,434
doesn't make me any less
their father or a man.

884
01:00:00,436 --> 01:00:01,503
Of course not. I just...

885
01:00:01,505 --> 01:00:03,470
I'm not done.

886
01:00:03,472 --> 01:00:07,175
All I do is work and work
and slave for this family.

887
01:00:07,177 --> 01:00:09,309
I may not have put us
in the lap of luxury,

888
01:00:09,311 --> 01:00:10,981
but I'm a provider.

889
01:00:11,581 --> 01:00:14,249
What you said was a low blow.

890
01:00:14,251 --> 01:00:18,485
An unfair and hurtful low blow.

891
01:00:18,487 --> 01:00:21,391
- Honey, I...
- Low blow.

892
01:00:22,525 --> 01:00:24,124
I need some air.

893
01:00:25,628 --> 01:00:27,030
Leo!

894
01:00:29,632 --> 01:00:31,231
Right after I check the score.

895
01:00:31,233 --> 01:00:33,503
<i>And it is good!</i>

896
01:00:35,304 --> 01:00:38,072
- We lost.
- <i>A stunning win for Arizona.</i>

897
01:00:38,074 --> 01:00:39,275
I hope you're happy.

898
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:43,144
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

899
01:00:43,146 --> 01:00:45,213
And not because
I don't remember, hmm?

900
01:00:45,215 --> 01:00:47,284
Because I don't know.

901
01:00:53,356 --> 01:00:55,657
My name is Leo
and I'm an alcoholic.

902
01:00:55,659 --> 01:00:57,425
Hi, Leo.

903
01:00:57,427 --> 01:01:00,295
To be honest, I don't really
remember my drinking days.

904
01:01:00,297 --> 01:01:02,162
- Yep.
- Been there.

905
01:01:02,164 --> 01:01:05,133
I got in a fight
with my wife tonight.

906
01:01:05,135 --> 01:01:08,172
I stood outside a bar
for 20 minutes.

907
01:01:09,672 --> 01:01:13,176
I came this close. This...

908
01:01:16,213 --> 01:01:17,545
But here I am.

909
01:01:17,547 --> 01:01:20,315
- Keep coming back.
- One day at a time.

910
01:01:20,317 --> 01:01:24,184
<i>♪ Bloody stools

912
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:30,891
Holy shit!

913
01:01:36,432 --> 01:01:39,333
Leonardo Montenegro.

914
01:01:39,335 --> 01:01:42,737
Yeah, he was murdered by a shark in
your district several weeks ago.

915
01:01:42,739 --> 01:01:43,871
<i>Sorry, ma'am.</i>

916
01:01:43,873 --> 01:01:46,441
Haven't had a shark attack
around here in four years.

917
01:01:46,443 --> 01:01:47,508
<i>Really?</i>

918
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:50,244
Don't you have to check
with other police stations?

919
01:01:50,246 --> 01:01:51,679
<i>Lady, I promise you,</i>

920
01:01:51,681 --> 01:01:53,680
if anyone's gonna hear
about a shark attack,

921
01:01:53,682 --> 01:01:55,152
it's gonna be me.

922
01:01:56,219 --> 01:01:57,387
Good luck to you.

923
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,322
Hmm.

924
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,229
- Hey.
- Hey.

925
01:02:07,197 --> 01:02:08,199
Um...

926
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:10,201
Sorry about tonight.

927
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:12,566
I'm the one
who should apologize.

928
01:02:12,568 --> 01:02:16,637
No, I really need to keep
my side of the street clean

929
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:20,243
and, you know, cultivate
an attitude of gratitude.

930
01:02:21,677 --> 01:02:26,213
I overreacted. I talked
to Emily and ungrounded her.

931
01:02:26,215 --> 01:02:28,550
I'm just so stressed out
about this test.

932
01:02:28,552 --> 01:02:31,219
Well, you've been
working so hard and...

933
01:02:32,355 --> 01:02:33,487
I got it.

934
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:36,392
And I've been thinking
how I can help.

935
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,358
So I talked to Theresa

936
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,597
and she's okay with me
picking up a few of your shifts.

937
01:02:41,797 --> 01:02:44,365
- Really? You'd do that for me?
- Yeah.

938
01:02:44,367 --> 01:02:45,465
I'm not being selfless.

939
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:47,538
I'm just thinking
of myself less.

940
01:02:48,538 --> 01:02:50,405
You like it with milk, right?

941
01:02:50,407 --> 01:02:51,542
And a little sugar.

942
01:02:53,376 --> 01:02:56,476
Oh, and I'll take the kids
all day Sunday so you can study.

943
01:02:56,478 --> 01:02:57,681
By yourself? I can't let...

944
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:02,416
Actually, that would be amazing.

945
01:03:02,418 --> 01:03:04,284
Great.

946
01:03:04,286 --> 01:03:06,521
I was also thinking
that I should... Oh! Ah!

947
01:03:06,523 --> 01:03:09,423
Sharp knife. Blood. Blood.
Lots of blood.

948
01:03:09,425 --> 01:03:10,425
- I do not like blood.
- All right.

949
01:03:10,427 --> 01:03:12,559
All right, take it easy. You're okay.

950
01:03:12,561 --> 01:03:14,295
- Let me see, let me see.
- Help.

951
01:03:14,297 --> 01:03:15,630
I'm just gonna wash it off.

952
01:03:15,632 --> 01:03:17,565
Feeling queasy. Gonna faint.

953
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:18,766
No. You're not gonna faint.

954
01:03:18,768 --> 01:03:20,334
- I'm fainting.
- No.

955
01:03:20,336 --> 01:03:21,369
The room is spinning.

956
01:03:21,371 --> 01:03:23,838
All right, let's just
sit you down over here.

957
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,740
How bad is it?

958
01:03:25,742 --> 01:03:27,708
Should I go to the hospital?
Do I need a tourniquet?

959
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:30,577
Relax. You are
with a trained professional.

960
01:03:30,579 --> 01:03:32,313
- Do I need stitches?
- No.

961
01:03:32,315 --> 01:03:34,451
Please help me.
I'm bleeding to death.

962
01:03:35,284 --> 01:03:36,818
Oh, God! It's really deep.

963
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,320
What the hell are you doing?

964
01:03:39,322 --> 01:03:42,322
Cleaning the cut.
My God, you're such a baby!

965
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,559
I got this.

966
01:03:44,561 --> 01:03:46,260
I took a whole class on it.

967
01:03:46,262 --> 01:03:47,362
Dressing wounds?

968
01:03:47,364 --> 01:03:49,563
Dealing with
hysterical patients.

969
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:54,504
All right.

970
01:03:55,472 --> 01:03:56,473
Okay.

971
01:03:57,407 --> 01:03:58,442
There.

972
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,219
You have very good
bedside manner.

973
01:04:10,853 --> 01:04:12,619
- You think so?
- Yeah.

974
01:04:12,621 --> 01:04:14,554
Sometimes I worry about that.

975
01:04:14,556 --> 01:04:16,659
No. No, you're a natural.

976
01:04:19,295 --> 01:04:23,266
All right. There you go.
Good as new.

977
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:32,476
Well, um...

978
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:35,746
I guess I'll let you study.

979
01:04:37,447 --> 01:04:39,717
Thanks for taking
such good care of me.

980
01:04:43,485 --> 01:04:44,487
Okay.

981
01:04:51,594 --> 01:04:52,596
Good night.

982
01:04:54,396 --> 01:04:55,398
Wait.

983
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,800
You can sleep inside.
Downstairs, on the couch.

984
01:05:02,438 --> 01:05:04,274
You've made me very happy.

985
01:05:40,744 --> 01:05:42,913
We'll pick you up
after the game, hmm?

986
01:05:44,847 --> 01:05:46,349
You're welcome!

987
01:05:49,952 --> 01:05:52,619
Why can't we go swimming?

988
01:05:52,621 --> 01:05:54,722
We're giving your sister
a little space.

989
01:06:01,831 --> 01:06:03,563
Too much space.

990
01:06:03,565 --> 01:06:04,934
We're giving her too much space.

991
01:06:06,802 --> 01:06:08,001
Everyone's watching.

992
01:06:08,003 --> 01:06:09,237
I don't care!

993
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:13,574
I don't have to listen to you.
You're not even my real dad.

994
01:06:13,576 --> 01:06:16,610
What? Your mother told you?

995
01:06:16,612 --> 01:06:18,579
Well, I'm still not letting
you throw your life away

996
01:06:18,581 --> 01:06:21,883
for some sex-crazed,
curly-haired wolf.

997
01:06:21,885 --> 01:06:24,788
That boy wants one thing
and one thing only.

998
01:06:25,454 --> 01:06:26,456
He's gay.

999
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,590
Okay. One different thing.

1000
01:06:32,027 --> 01:06:34,961
What are you doing?
Why are you crying?

1001
01:06:34,963 --> 01:06:36,467
Because I'm miserable.

1002
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:37,901
You are?

1003
01:06:38,534 --> 01:06:39,635
Yeah.

1004
01:06:41,771 --> 01:06:43,970
I was really popular
in Portland,

1005
01:06:43,972 --> 01:06:47,708
and here everyone's on group
texts that I'm not a part of.

1006
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,811
And there's this boy in
my Spanish class that I like,

1007
01:06:49,813 --> 01:06:51,545
but he doesn't know
that I exist.

1008
01:06:51,547 --> 01:06:54,014
And he's friends with the
lifeguard here and that's...

1009
01:06:54,016 --> 01:06:56,419
Wait, you're taking Spanish?

1010
01:06:58,954 --> 01:07:00,054
<i>Muy bien.</i>

1011
01:07:00,056 --> 01:07:02,523
Your pronunciation
is very natural.

1012
01:07:02,525 --> 01:07:04,758
I mean, you still need
to roll the "R's".

1013
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,494
What?

1014
01:07:06,496 --> 01:07:07,894
Say it.

1015
01:07:07,896 --> 01:07:09,996
- You have to... Okay, okay.
- Dad!

1016
01:07:09,998 --> 01:07:12,599
How could he
not know you exist?

1017
01:07:12,601 --> 01:07:15,970
You're a beautiful, smart,
thoughtful young woman.

1018
01:07:15,972 --> 01:07:17,804
He'd be lucky
to be your boyfriend.

1019
01:07:17,806 --> 01:07:20,775
But you're way too young
for a boyfriend.

1020
01:07:20,777 --> 01:07:22,242
They'd all be lucky
to be your boyfriend.

1021
01:07:22,244 --> 01:07:25,012
Every boy here should beg
to be your boyfriend.

1022
01:07:25,014 --> 01:07:28,483
But I forbid it. I forbid it!

1023
01:07:28,485 --> 01:07:32,253
I know I'm all over the map.
It's just...

1024
01:07:32,255 --> 01:07:35,590
It's very confusing
having a daughter.

1025
01:07:35,592 --> 01:07:39,496
Look. I'm not gonna do
anything stupid. All right?

1026
01:07:45,902 --> 01:07:47,438
<i>Gracias.</i>

1027
01:07:56,746 --> 01:07:58,813
Blue 52. Hot route left.

1028
01:07:58,815 --> 01:08:00,113
Hut, hut, hike!

1029
01:08:07,056 --> 01:08:08,856
Yes! Yes!

1030
01:08:08,858 --> 01:08:10,825
Go, go, go. Yes! Yes! Yes!

1031
01:08:10,827 --> 01:08:13,528
Go! Go! Go! Yes!

1032
01:08:14,931 --> 01:08:17,467
Woo-hoo!

1033
01:08:19,068 --> 01:08:21,736
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1034
01:08:21,738 --> 01:08:24,807
- Go team! Yeah, we did it!
- That's my daughter.

1035
01:08:25,307 --> 01:08:26,510
We know.

1036
01:08:28,043 --> 01:08:29,677
Second touchdown.

1037
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:32,013
We're winning, actually.

1038
01:08:32,015 --> 01:08:33,517
Yeah,
we kicked their butts!

1039
01:08:34,917 --> 01:08:37,018
- Thanks for rescuing me.
- Ah.

1040
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,022
My mind was
turning into mush.

1041
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:42,822
Hey, Molly!

1042
01:08:42,824 --> 01:08:45,559
When did you learn how to ride
without training wheels?

1043
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:46,829
Dad taught me.

1044
01:08:48,898 --> 01:08:50,734
She only fell once.

1045
01:08:52,769 --> 01:08:54,902
Faster! Faster! Faster!

1046
01:08:54,904 --> 01:08:57,148
Come on, come on, come on! Yes, yes, yes!

1047
01:08:57,172 --> 01:08:59,773
Whoo!

1048
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,776
So how do I get rid
of the brain freeze?

1049
01:09:01,778 --> 01:09:03,777
- Go like this.
- Like this?

1050
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:05,815
Mmm.

1051
01:09:07,716 --> 01:09:09,951
Are you gonna leave us?

1052
01:09:09,953 --> 01:09:12,986
What do you mean?
Of course not. I'm your dad.

1053
01:09:12,988 --> 01:09:15,822
Sometimes dads leave.

1054
01:09:15,824 --> 01:09:18,960
Well, I guess maybe they do,
but I'm not going anywhere.

1055
01:09:18,962 --> 01:09:20,961
You're stuck with me.

1056
01:09:20,963 --> 01:09:22,798
Thank you.

1057
01:09:32,975 --> 01:09:35,209
"A. Sudden weight gain.
B. Abdominal itch.

1058
01:09:35,211 --> 01:09:37,780
"C. Bloody stools. D. Light..."

1059
01:09:39,748 --> 01:09:40,917
Bloody stools.

1060
01:10:05,641 --> 01:10:06,842
<i>Ay,</i> Papa!

1061
01:10:18,954 --> 01:10:20,122
Papa!

1062
01:10:37,273 --> 01:10:38,906
Colin,
were you with Magdalena

1063
01:10:38,908 --> 01:10:40,775
when she identified
my brother's body?

1064
01:10:40,777 --> 01:10:43,777
No, ma'am, she was quite insistent
on handling the matter herself.

1065
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:45,012
Are you insinuating?

1066
01:10:45,014 --> 01:10:46,046
Are you insinuating?

1067
01:10:46,048 --> 01:10:47,748
Should I be insinuating?

1068
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:48,848
Should I be insinuating?

1069
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:50,785
And before you answer that,
remember I'm Scottish.

1070
01:10:50,787 --> 01:10:52,018
I can do this all day long.

1071
01:10:54,189 --> 01:10:56,891
Hey! So, the test?

1072
01:10:56,893 --> 01:11:00,160
There was a couple that I blanked
on, but at least it's over.

1073
01:11:00,162 --> 01:11:02,796
Now I don't have
to keep up this insane lie.

1074
01:11:02,798 --> 01:11:05,866
Are you sure you don't wanna wait a
couple of weeks before you tell him?

1075
01:11:05,868 --> 01:11:07,468
I mean, good help
is hard to find.

1076
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:10,303
Yeah, totally. And the guys are
really starting to like him, too.

1077
01:11:10,305 --> 01:11:12,740
No. No. Fair is fair.
He has paid his debt.

1078
01:11:12,742 --> 01:11:14,107
I have tortured him
long enough.

1079
01:11:14,109 --> 01:11:15,276
Okay.

1080
01:11:15,278 --> 01:11:17,814
You're really gonna hate
doing your own laundry again.

1081
01:11:18,814 --> 01:11:20,216
Guys...

1082
01:11:21,216 --> 01:11:23,718
I feel pretty nervous.

1083
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,951
I think he's gonna freak out.

1084
01:11:24,953 --> 01:11:26,254
Freak out?

1085
01:11:26,256 --> 01:11:28,723
Kate, you're telling a ditch digger
he's a billionaire, you know.

1086
01:11:28,725 --> 01:11:30,891
I'm pretty sure
he's gonna be okay with it.

1087
01:11:30,893 --> 01:11:31,927
Yeah.

1088
01:11:36,032 --> 01:11:37,197
Hey.

1089
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:38,201
Hey.

1090
01:11:39,801 --> 01:11:42,068
Uh, I need to talk to you.

1091
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:44,304
Yeah. What's up?

1092
01:11:44,306 --> 01:11:47,741
I have to confess something,
and I don't know where to start.

1093
01:11:47,743 --> 01:11:49,809
Well, whatever it is,

1094
01:11:49,811 --> 01:11:51,914
I'm sure it's not
that big of a deal.

1095
01:11:52,948 --> 01:11:54,815
- It's pretty big.
- Yeah?

1096
01:11:54,817 --> 01:11:57,688
And this is gonna sound crazy.

1097
01:11:58,787 --> 01:12:02,725
Maybe funny-crazy
or crazy-crazy.

1098
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,925
But I did something terrible.

1099
01:12:05,927 --> 01:12:08,198
Hold that thought.

1100
01:12:09,231 --> 01:12:10,233
Girls!

1101
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,769
Dinner's ready!

1102
01:12:18,073 --> 01:12:20,009
Yeah. Sit down, please.

1103
01:12:22,244 --> 01:12:25,780
- Be careful, it's hot.
- It smells so good.

1104
01:12:25,782 --> 01:12:27,313
- I hope it tastes good.
- It looks so good.

1105
01:12:27,315 --> 01:12:29,251
Use a spoon. Mmm.

1106
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:32,852
So...

1107
01:12:32,854 --> 01:12:35,224
What's this awful thing
you need to confess?

1108
01:12:37,292 --> 01:12:38,728
I...

1109
01:12:40,962 --> 01:12:43,332
Come on, I'm your husband.
You can tell me anything.

1110
01:12:52,307 --> 01:12:54,842
I forgot it's our anniversary.

1111
01:12:54,844 --> 01:12:56,143
Really?

1112
01:12:56,145 --> 01:12:57,343
Today?

1113
01:12:57,345 --> 01:12:58,981
Happy anniversary!

1114
01:13:00,349 --> 01:13:02,415
We're going out!

1115
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,424
You guys are really good.

1116
01:13:44,426 --> 01:13:46,228
<i>Thanks, bro. Tell my uncle.</i>

1117
01:13:55,171 --> 01:13:57,338
Fifteen years.

1118
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:59,943
A lot of couples don't
make it that long.

1119
01:14:00,643 --> 01:14:01,845
Yeah.

1120
01:14:02,444 --> 01:14:04,180
Thanks for sticking with me.

1121
01:14:06,381 --> 01:14:08,484
I know I haven't made
things easy.

1122
01:14:12,387 --> 01:14:14,888
- It's pretty out here.
- Beautiful.

1123
01:14:18,426 --> 01:14:21,961
Do you know what it means when a
ship honks three times like that?

1124
01:14:21,963 --> 01:14:24,868
Someone told me once,
but I forgot.

1125
01:14:26,234 --> 01:14:27,304
Yes, I do.

1126
01:14:28,371 --> 01:14:31,071
It's based on
an old, Spanish legend.

1127
01:14:31,073 --> 01:14:32,673
Yeah.

1128
01:14:32,675 --> 01:14:35,108
Very romantic, by the way.

1129
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:39,379
You see, there was a poor
housemaid named Catalina.

1130
01:14:39,381 --> 01:14:45,052
She was very pretty and caught the eye
of the colonial governor's son, Arturo.

1131
01:14:45,054 --> 01:14:47,454
Okay, wait. You don't
remember anything,

1132
01:14:47,456 --> 01:14:48,988
yet you remember this?

1133
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:51,258
It's a very famous legend.

1134
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,960
So, they fell in love.

1135
01:14:52,962 --> 01:14:54,027
Of course.

1136
01:14:54,029 --> 01:14:56,129
But Arturo's father forbade it.

1137
01:14:56,131 --> 01:14:59,700
He couldn't have his only son
running around with a commoner.

1138
01:14:59,702 --> 01:15:04,071
So, he ordered Arturo to return
to Spain, which he did.

1139
01:15:04,073 --> 01:15:07,107
But not before
promising Catalina

1140
01:15:07,109 --> 01:15:09,375
he'd come back
and signal for her

1141
01:15:09,377 --> 01:15:12,148
with three long blasts.

1142
01:15:13,015 --> 01:15:15,049
Just like you heard.

1143
01:15:15,051 --> 01:15:19,152
This sounds suspiciously like one of
the shows the kitchen guys watch.

1144
01:15:19,154 --> 01:15:21,287
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Uh-huh.

1145
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:25,526
Anyway, a year later,
everything went as planned.

1146
01:15:25,528 --> 01:15:29,028
She swam out,
but the fog was too thick.

1147
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:31,732
He called out,
"Catalina! Catalina!"

1148
01:15:31,734 --> 01:15:34,434
She yelled back,
"Arturo! Arturo!"

1149
01:15:34,436 --> 01:15:37,303
And with that,
he dove into the water.

1150
01:15:37,305 --> 01:15:39,173
They reunited,

1151
01:15:39,175 --> 01:15:41,442
and Catalina, who,
up until that point,

1152
01:15:41,444 --> 01:15:42,977
had been resisting him

1153
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:45,916
because of some test
she had to study for,

1154
01:15:46,448 --> 01:15:49,251
finally let him kiss her.

1155
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:51,352
Hmm.

1156
01:15:51,354 --> 01:15:53,320
Oh. Now I remember.

1157
01:15:53,322 --> 01:15:56,190
Three honks means a boat's
about to go in reverse.

1158
01:15:57,993 --> 01:15:59,028
Okay.

1159
01:15:59,462 --> 01:16:01,464
Maybe. Factually.

1160
01:16:02,064 --> 01:16:03,199
But I...

1161
01:16:21,149 --> 01:16:22,985
Was it always this good?

1162
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:27,523
Every time with you
is like the first time.

1163
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:39,502
Look at this thing.
We built it.

1164
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:43,637
Your first pool, bro.

1165
01:16:43,639 --> 01:16:45,272
Good job.

1166
01:16:45,274 --> 01:16:48,107
Hey, look at you,
you got working man hands now.

1167
01:16:48,109 --> 01:16:49,311
Yeah!

1168
01:16:49,578 --> 01:16:51,644
Yes, I do!

1169
01:17:03,826 --> 01:17:05,526
That's good.

1170
01:17:05,528 --> 01:17:08,428
<i>Take that play, get
off the block there by Laken Tomlinson.</i>

1171
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:12,066
<i>This guy will be a defensive
MVP one day, I guarantee you.</i>

1172
01:17:12,068 --> 01:17:14,003
Dad, what's a pervert?

1173
01:17:17,405 --> 01:17:18,604
Um...

1174
01:17:18,606 --> 01:17:20,473
Well, uh...

1175
01:17:20,475 --> 01:17:22,177
When a man

1176
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:24,614
has a van...

1177
01:17:26,347 --> 01:17:27,548
Kate!

1178
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:29,282
Molly has a question for you.

1179
01:17:30,386 --> 01:17:32,419
What is taking them so long?

1180
01:17:32,421 --> 01:17:33,653
Would you relax?

1181
01:17:33,655 --> 01:17:36,255
They said they were gonna post
the results after 2:00 p.m.

1182
01:17:36,257 --> 01:17:37,357
All right. Halftime.

1183
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:39,526
I'm getting lunch.

1184
01:17:39,528 --> 01:17:41,564
Oh, wait. Where's my list?

1185
01:17:42,331 --> 01:17:43,397
Here.

1186
01:17:43,399 --> 01:17:45,435
Mmm... <i>Ciao.</i>

1187
01:17:47,302 --> 01:17:49,303
Wait! Hey, I forgot.

1188
01:17:49,305 --> 01:17:51,104
Honey!

1189
01:17:51,106 --> 01:17:54,607
Get coleslaw, okay?
And maybe some potato chips.

1190
01:17:54,609 --> 01:17:56,210
Okay, got it.

1191
01:17:56,212 --> 01:17:59,245
Write it down. I know you.
You're gonna forget.

1192
01:17:59,247 --> 01:18:01,581
And get cookies. I want cookies.

1193
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:03,052
Cookies.

1194
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:05,422
Pen.

1195
01:18:14,662 --> 01:18:15,664
Kate!

1196
01:18:17,332 --> 01:18:18,531
What's the matter?

1197
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:21,668
I don't know.
I was just wondering

1198
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:25,171
what the wife on an
infertile man would be doing

1199
01:18:25,173 --> 01:18:29,445
with a strip of ribbed,
reservoir-tipped Trojans?

1200
01:18:30,345 --> 01:18:31,346
Okay...

1201
01:18:32,213 --> 01:18:34,915
This is not what you think.

1202
01:18:34,917 --> 01:18:36,349
It's nothing.

1203
01:18:36,351 --> 01:18:38,418
Nothing? We made a vow.

1204
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:41,287
A sacred vow,
which I kept, I think.

1205
01:18:41,289 --> 01:18:44,191
And don't assume
I didn't have opportunities,

1206
01:18:44,193 --> 01:18:45,358
because I did.

1207
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,630
Lots and lots of them. Probably.

1208
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:49,595
This is nuts.

1209
01:18:49,597 --> 01:18:51,498
You know what, I'm glad.

1210
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,732
I'm glad you found these,

1211
01:18:52,734 --> 01:18:56,105
because I have been trying to
think of a way to tell you this.

1212
01:18:56,438 --> 01:18:57,707
You and I...

1213
01:19:00,309 --> 01:19:02,177
We're not really married.

1214
01:19:03,345 --> 01:19:04,945
Have I not made you happy?

1215
01:19:04,947 --> 01:19:07,214
Yes, but that's not the point.

1216
01:19:07,216 --> 01:19:09,215
I'm not your wife.

1217
01:19:09,217 --> 01:19:12,385
Those kids in there,
they're not your children.

1218
01:19:12,387 --> 01:19:14,157
Oh, this again.

1219
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:16,255
Low blow.

1220
01:19:16,257 --> 01:19:17,659
All right, come on.
Come on!

1221
01:19:18,293 --> 01:19:20,527
Girls?

1222
01:19:20,529 --> 01:19:24,334
Girls, I just told him the truth,
and I want you to tell him, too.

1223
01:19:27,502 --> 01:19:28,637
Go ahead, tell him.

1224
01:19:30,405 --> 01:19:32,406
Tell him what?

1225
01:19:32,408 --> 01:19:33,676
Tell him he's not your dad.

1226
01:19:34,409 --> 01:19:35,375
But he is our dad?

1227
01:19:35,377 --> 01:19:38,411
No, don't tell him
what I told you to tell him.

1228
01:19:38,413 --> 01:19:40,647
Tell him what really
happened. Emily?

1229
01:19:40,649 --> 01:19:43,282
He got drunk and
blacked out on the beach.

1230
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:45,285
We were really worried.
I couldn't sleep.

1231
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:47,286
No, damn it!
Tell him the truth!

1232
01:19:47,288 --> 01:19:49,492
Don't you speak to
my three musketeers like that.

1233
01:19:50,225 --> 01:19:51,460
I've had it.

1234
01:19:54,529 --> 01:19:55,696
What do you think you're doing?

1235
01:19:55,698 --> 01:19:57,697
- We like him.
- We want to keep him.

1236
01:19:57,699 --> 01:20:00,666
You can't keep him.
He doesn't belong to you.

1237
01:20:00,668 --> 01:20:03,704
He didn't belong to you, either,
but that didn't stop you.

1238
01:20:03,706 --> 01:20:07,307
- You know I have my reasons.
- So do we.

1239
01:20:07,309 --> 01:20:10,410
Leo, listen. Look, look, look.
Those condoms aren't Kate's.

1240
01:20:10,412 --> 01:20:11,445
They're mine.

1241
01:20:11,447 --> 01:20:12,545
Don't cover for her.

1242
01:20:12,547 --> 01:20:15,749
No, I'm not.
She's covering for me.

1243
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:18,718
Yeah. I'm the one
sleeping with the customers.

1244
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,254
Really?

1245
01:20:21,256 --> 01:20:24,590
I have a problem, Leo.
I'm obsessed with sex.

1246
01:20:24,592 --> 01:20:25,726
Come on.

1247
01:20:25,728 --> 01:20:28,027
I'm a sex addict!
It's a real thing.

1248
01:20:28,029 --> 01:20:29,362
What are you talking about?

1249
01:20:29,364 --> 01:20:30,597
Kate! I confessed.

1250
01:20:30,599 --> 01:20:32,398
You don't have to lie
for me anymore.

1251
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,034
I can finally get
the help I need.

1252
01:20:34,036 --> 01:20:35,736
Now, don't worry.
You don't have to tell Bobby.

1253
01:20:35,738 --> 01:20:37,271
I'll tell him.

1254
01:20:37,273 --> 01:20:38,274
Do you hate me?

1255
01:20:40,576 --> 01:20:41,810
Of course not.

1256
01:20:43,378 --> 01:20:45,215
I know the flesh is weak.

1257
01:20:45,847 --> 01:20:49,516
Hey, one day at a time. Hmm?

1258
01:20:49,518 --> 01:20:50,683
Yeah, one day at a time.

1259
01:20:53,622 --> 01:20:56,526
I'm so sorry I didn't trust you.

1260
01:20:57,693 --> 01:20:59,793
That really scared me.

1261
01:20:59,795 --> 01:21:02,461
It was like my whole life
was a lie.

1262
01:21:02,463 --> 01:21:03,763
Come on,
they're back on the field!

1263
01:21:03,765 --> 01:21:06,500
Hey. Second half's
about to start.

1264
01:21:06,502 --> 01:21:07,622
Mind doing the sandwich run?

1265
01:21:10,872 --> 01:21:12,507
What are you doing?

1266
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:15,776
I can't keep this up forever.

1267
01:21:15,778 --> 01:21:17,077
Why not?

1268
01:21:17,079 --> 01:21:19,679
Okay, look, I know your relationship's
a little unconventional.

1269
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:22,683
But whose isn't?
You guys are good together.

1270
01:21:22,685 --> 01:21:24,084
Stop fighting it.

1271
01:21:24,086 --> 01:21:25,451
I'll tell you one thing.

1272
01:21:25,453 --> 01:21:29,089
Pretend or not, Bobby's Latin ego
is not gonna like being cheated on.

1273
01:21:29,091 --> 01:21:30,723
- Kate!
- Shit.

1274
01:21:30,725 --> 01:21:31,728
They told him.

1275
01:21:33,662 --> 01:21:35,431
You passed! You're a nurse!

1276
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:47,542
Congratulations, Mom!

1277
01:21:57,386 --> 01:21:58,588
- Hike!
- Let's do this.

1278
01:22:06,929 --> 01:22:08,461
- Hey, Gordo.
- Hey.

1279
01:22:08,463 --> 01:22:09,465
You okay?

1280
01:22:10,431 --> 01:22:11,365
Huh? Oh.

1281
01:22:11,367 --> 01:22:13,700
Yeah, well, you know,
I've been better.

1282
01:22:13,702 --> 01:22:14,567
Yeah.

1283
01:22:14,569 --> 01:22:16,602
But this is the
wake-up call we needed.

1284
01:22:16,604 --> 01:22:18,972
I wasn't as attentive to her
needs as I should have been.

1285
01:22:18,974 --> 01:22:21,911
You know, I can be
emotionally remote, bro.

1286
01:22:23,612 --> 01:22:25,512
We're starting couples therapy.

1287
01:22:25,514 --> 01:22:26,716
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

1288
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:30,717
Just, whatever you do,
you know, don't...

1289
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,422
I'm sorry, take Kate
for granted. Because...

1290
01:22:35,591 --> 01:22:38,724
Look, I know we can be
a little <i>machista.</i>

1291
01:22:38,726 --> 01:22:40,727
- It's our way. Yeah.
- You know?

1292
01:22:40,729 --> 01:22:43,599
But your vulnerability
and honesty really touches me.

1293
01:22:48,604 --> 01:22:49,605
You owe me.

1294
01:22:49,971 --> 01:22:51,937
I know.

1295
01:22:51,939 --> 01:22:54,641
Oh, yeah,
this is a Christmas card.

1296
01:22:54,643 --> 01:22:55,875
Oh, God, it's cold!

1297
01:22:55,877 --> 01:22:57,777
I got you!

1298
01:22:57,779 --> 01:22:59,916
That's him.
The chicken fight guy.

1299
01:24:03,744 --> 01:24:06,479
Hold the ashes!
Sorry, sorry.

1300
01:24:07,582 --> 01:24:08,850
This was taken 20 minutes ago.

1301
01:24:09,885 --> 01:24:11,050
- Leonardo?
- What?

1302
01:24:11,052 --> 01:24:12,854
It's Leonardo!

1303
01:24:24,832 --> 01:24:27,000
Hey, you guys! You guys!

1304
01:24:27,002 --> 01:24:28,968
Before I cut the cake,

1305
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:31,705
I just want to thank you all
for being here.

1306
01:24:31,707 --> 01:24:34,574
I could not have passed
the test without you all.

1307
01:24:34,576 --> 01:24:36,910
- Nurse Kate!
- Nurse Kate!

1308
01:24:36,912 --> 01:24:38,448
Especially you, Leo.

1309
01:24:38,947 --> 01:24:40,679
He cooked, he cleaned.

1310
01:24:40,681 --> 01:24:43,616
He worked two jobs,
he kept me laughing.

1311
01:24:43,618 --> 01:24:45,085
And if you haven't tried
the empanadas yet,

1312
01:24:45,087 --> 01:24:46,719
they are delicious.
He made them.

1313
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:47,954
They're gone!

1314
01:24:50,024 --> 01:24:51,590
What, babe?

1315
01:24:51,592 --> 01:24:53,512
They're delicious, bro.

1316
01:24:58,867 --> 01:25:00,503
Wait, wait, wait.

1317
01:25:00,935 --> 01:25:02,001
Wait, wait, wait.

1318
01:25:02,003 --> 01:25:03,602
I want to say something, too.

1319
01:25:03,604 --> 01:25:05,738
I mean, look at this face.

1320
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:07,307
- Look at this face.
- Oh!

1321
01:25:07,309 --> 01:25:09,942
Isn't this the most beautiful
face you've ever seen?

1322
01:25:09,944 --> 01:25:11,777
Second. Second most beautiful.

1323
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,016
She's too good for you!

1324
01:25:16,752 --> 01:25:21,090
And also, I don't remember
the first time I did this,

1325
01:25:22,658 --> 01:25:24,624
and that doesn't feel right.

1326
01:25:24,626 --> 01:25:26,762
So, Kate,

1327
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:30,563
will you marry me again?

1328
01:25:30,565 --> 01:25:32,501
Holy crap.

1329
01:25:33,769 --> 01:25:34,904
Yeah.

1330
01:25:35,737 --> 01:25:37,836
Yes! Yes, I will!

1331
01:25:37,838 --> 01:25:39,772
- She said yes!
- She said yes!

1332
01:25:41,042 --> 01:25:42,675
That's what
I'm talking about, Leo!

1333
01:25:42,677 --> 01:25:43,777
Go, Mom!

1334
01:25:43,779 --> 01:25:45,678
That's what
I'm talking about, bro!

1335
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,580
That's my boy right there.

1336
01:25:47,582 --> 01:25:49,648
Okay, that's love, baby.

1337
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:53,687
"'And now, gentlemen, ' said d'Artagnan,
without stopping to explain his conduct,

1338
01:25:53,689 --> 01:25:56,656
"'all for one, and one for all.

1339
01:25:56,658 --> 01:25:58,924
"'That is our motto, is it not?

1340
01:25:58,926 --> 01:26:00,595
"'But still, look here.'"

1341
01:26:43,971 --> 01:26:45,804
Wow.

1342
01:26:45,806 --> 01:26:47,173
Whose fancy car is that?

1343
01:26:47,175 --> 01:26:48,744
That's so cool.

1344
01:27:06,161 --> 01:27:07,697
Hey, Papi!

1345
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:09,763
Sofia!

1346
01:27:09,765 --> 01:27:10,863
Hi, Magda!

1347
01:27:10,865 --> 01:27:12,665
Let me just drop this
in the house.

1348
01:27:12,667 --> 01:27:13,735
Hey.

1349
01:27:37,091 --> 01:27:38,094
Papi.

1350
01:27:38,859 --> 01:27:39,862
Sofia.

1351
01:27:40,796 --> 01:27:42,731
Magda.

1352
01:27:43,731 --> 01:27:45,100
Oh, my God, I remember.

1353
01:27:46,702 --> 01:27:48,738
I'm Leonardo Montenegro.

1354
01:27:49,738 --> 01:27:51,039
Kate!

1355
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,205
I'm cured!

1356
01:27:53,207 --> 01:27:55,909
The doctor said my memory
could come back suddenly,

1357
01:27:55,911 --> 01:27:57,710
and he was right.

1358
01:27:57,712 --> 01:28:00,213
I mean, I saw Papi...

1359
01:28:00,215 --> 01:28:03,016
I walked past him into
the house and poof!

1360
01:28:03,018 --> 01:28:04,183
It came back!

1361
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:08,220
Honey, ask me anything.

1362
01:28:08,222 --> 01:28:11,090
Ask me about my childhood
in Mexico City.

1363
01:28:11,092 --> 01:28:13,793
About my car collection.

1364
01:28:13,795 --> 01:28:15,227
About my money.

1365
01:28:15,229 --> 01:28:17,766
Money. I have money!

1366
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:21,934
Lots and lots of money.

1367
01:28:21,936 --> 01:28:24,140
This is the happiest day
of my life!

1368
01:28:27,175 --> 01:28:28,177
Wait.

1369
01:28:32,814 --> 01:28:34,150
You're not my wife.

1370
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:37,787
Why would you make me think...

1371
01:28:40,822 --> 01:28:42,123
Why would you do that to me?

1372
01:28:45,926 --> 01:28:47,228
I know why.

1373
01:28:49,797 --> 01:28:54,703
You're that awful carpet cleaner
lady who hates me.

1374
01:28:57,372 --> 01:28:58,841
And...

1375
01:28:59,841 --> 01:29:02,976
And these are your kids

1376
01:29:02,978 --> 01:29:04,913
and you made me believe...

1377
01:29:07,114 --> 01:29:08,117
Oh, God.

1378
01:29:09,818 --> 01:29:11,119
Oh, God.

1379
01:29:12,554 --> 01:29:14,056
You tricked me.

1380
01:29:15,323 --> 01:29:16,826
You used me.

1381
01:29:17,192 --> 01:29:18,258
Leo...

1382
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:19,826
No, no, no.

1383
01:29:19,828 --> 01:29:21,097
My name is not Leo.

1384
01:29:21,997 --> 01:29:23,199
It's Leonardo.

1385
01:29:25,065 --> 01:29:27,068
And I don't belong with you.

1386
01:29:31,072 --> 01:29:32,274
And I don't belong with them.

1387
01:29:41,349 --> 01:29:42,885
I'll get my things.

1388
01:30:12,146 --> 01:30:13,882
There's nothing
in there that's mine.

1389
01:30:17,918 --> 01:30:19,320
For what it's worth...

1390
01:30:20,421 --> 01:30:21,956
I'm sorry.

1391
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:23,925
And...

1392
01:30:25,193 --> 01:30:26,996
And thank you.

1393
01:30:39,341 --> 01:30:40,342
Hey.

1394
01:30:57,458 --> 01:30:58,991
Girls.

1395
01:30:58,993 --> 01:31:00,125
Don't go!

1396
01:31:00,127 --> 01:31:02,661
Dad! Dad! Don't go.

1397
01:31:02,663 --> 01:31:05,231
Dad! Dad!

1398
01:31:05,233 --> 01:31:06,268
Dad!

1399
01:31:07,068 --> 01:31:08,101
Dad!

1400
01:31:08,103 --> 01:31:10,236
No! Don't go, don't go!

1401
01:31:10,238 --> 01:31:11,407
Wait, no.

1402
01:31:16,478 --> 01:31:17,846
Daddy!

1403
01:31:19,247 --> 01:31:20,883
Daddy, wait!

1404
01:32:05,993 --> 01:32:07,293
Welcome back, sir.

1405
01:32:07,295 --> 01:32:09,163
Your funeral was lovely,
by the way.

1406
01:32:18,472 --> 01:32:21,240
I liked Dad's sauce better.

1407
01:32:21,242 --> 01:32:23,308
Sweetie, you know
he was never really your dad.

1408
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:25,277
You should have tried
to stop him.

1409
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:27,080
What was I gonna say?

1410
01:32:27,082 --> 01:32:30,249
I lied to him.
I basically kidnapped the man.

1411
01:32:30,251 --> 01:32:34,023
So what? You're obviously
totally in love with him.

1412
01:32:35,055 --> 01:32:36,356
What does it matter now?

1413
01:32:36,358 --> 01:32:38,057
He's back to his old life,

1414
01:32:38,059 --> 01:32:41,463
with his servants
and supermodels.

1415
01:32:42,997 --> 01:32:44,065
It's over.

1416
01:32:45,132 --> 01:32:48,938
Now finish up, 'cause
Grandma can't wait to see ya.

1417
01:34:05,447 --> 01:34:07,016
No, I don't drink.

1418
01:34:10,385 --> 01:34:13,489
Wait, wait. I do drink.

1419
01:34:14,588 --> 01:34:15,554
Fill her up, Colin!

1420
01:34:15,556 --> 01:34:18,191
Yes, that was definitely
my recollection, sir.

1421
01:34:18,193 --> 01:34:20,860
- Give me the bottle.
- Ah, what was I thinking?

1422
01:34:40,648 --> 01:34:42,682
This is horrifying.

1423
01:34:47,255 --> 01:34:48,623
Why is she doing this?

1424
01:34:50,358 --> 01:34:53,429
Because life's short, and you
don't wanna have regrets.

1425
01:35:00,268 --> 01:35:01,534
Come on. We're getting Leo.

1426
01:35:01,536 --> 01:35:02,634
Yay!

1427
01:35:02,636 --> 01:35:05,470
Excuse us. Diarrhea. Excuse us.

1428
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:06,705
Where are you going?

1429
01:35:06,707 --> 01:35:08,347
- I'll call you.
- Yes, yes, yes!

1430
01:35:10,612 --> 01:35:12,213
Hurry up,
we gotta catch him.

1431
01:35:19,487 --> 01:35:21,153
Sir, you should have called me.

1432
01:35:21,155 --> 01:35:22,354
I'd have gotten that for you.

1433
01:35:22,356 --> 01:35:24,557
You know, it's funny.

1434
01:35:24,559 --> 01:35:26,659
I've had this boat for 10 years,

1435
01:35:26,661 --> 01:35:29,629
and I don't think
I ever stepped foot in here.

1436
01:35:29,631 --> 01:35:31,563
Well, that's because
you have people

1437
01:35:31,565 --> 01:35:33,432
to take care
of everything for you.

1438
01:35:33,434 --> 01:35:36,701
You know, when I was
working construction,

1439
01:35:36,703 --> 01:35:39,472
I hated rich assholes like me.

1440
01:35:39,474 --> 01:35:40,673
Hmm.

1441
01:35:40,675 --> 01:35:43,742
Did you hate me, Colin?
You can be honest.

1442
01:35:43,744 --> 01:35:46,411
Well. If I may
remind you, sir,

1443
01:35:46,413 --> 01:35:49,615
the reason I got this job was because
the last steward was honest.

1444
01:35:49,617 --> 01:35:52,121
Eh.

1445
01:35:53,654 --> 01:35:55,123
Can I confess something?

1446
01:35:55,489 --> 01:35:56,492
Hmm.

1447
01:35:58,525 --> 01:36:01,529
I'm not exactly sure
where I fit in anymore.

1448
01:36:02,462 --> 01:36:03,465
Is that crazy?

1449
01:36:05,667 --> 01:36:10,635
Most of us only know the world
that we're born into.

1450
01:36:10,637 --> 01:36:14,510
You've had the privilege of seeing life
from an entirely different perspective.

1451
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:17,276
Yeah, I did.

1452
01:36:17,278 --> 01:36:18,547
And it sucked, didn't it?

1453
01:36:26,453 --> 01:36:27,553
What's up, Kate?

1454
01:36:27,555 --> 01:36:29,557
Bobby, we need your boat!

1455
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:33,326
You hear that?
She needs my boat.

1456
01:36:33,328 --> 01:36:34,463
She needs it.

1457
01:37:46,768 --> 01:37:49,402
"There was hope
a Mexico City woman

1458
01:37:49,404 --> 01:37:52,274
"yachting nearby
might be his sister."

1459
01:38:20,501 --> 01:38:22,181
Three.

1460
01:38:22,502 --> 01:38:24,672
Three! That's Kate!

1461
01:38:25,739 --> 01:38:27,473
That's Kate.

1462
01:38:27,475 --> 01:38:29,541
Leonardo.

1463
01:38:29,543 --> 01:38:31,313
Move away, Captain.

1464
01:38:41,823 --> 01:38:44,559
Arturo! Arturo!

1465
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:48,693
Catalina! Catalina!

1466
01:38:52,899 --> 01:38:55,835
- They're turning!
- Mom! Mom! Mom!

1467
01:38:55,837 --> 01:38:58,403
They're turning around.
Why are they turning around?

1468
01:38:58,405 --> 01:39:00,138
- I don't know.
- Bobby, do something.

1469
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:01,676
No, no, no!

1470
01:39:02,542 --> 01:39:03,612
Papa!

1471
01:39:13,954 --> 01:39:15,754
Come on,
come on, we're losing them!

1472
01:39:15,756 --> 01:39:16,921
Can't this thing go any faster?

1473
01:39:16,923 --> 01:39:18,557
No, it's a leisure boat, babe!

1474
01:39:18,559 --> 01:39:19,791
Just admit you overpaid.

1475
01:39:19,793 --> 01:39:20,992
Okay, okay, I overpaid!

1476
01:39:20,994 --> 01:39:22,727
We're never gonna catch them.

1477
01:39:22,729 --> 01:39:24,249
I should have sprung
for the 40-footer.

1478
01:39:27,601 --> 01:39:29,602
I'm sorry, Kate.
There's nothing I can do.

1479
01:39:43,417 --> 01:39:45,718
I love you, Kate!

1480
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:48,423
I love you, too!

1481
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,669
What's he doing?

1482
01:40:03,837 --> 01:40:06,640
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa! That was amazing!

1483
01:40:10,211 --> 01:40:11,651
Man overboard!

1484
01:40:17,984 --> 01:40:20,218
- What? Kate!
- Mom!

1485
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:21,553
- Mom!
- Kate.

1486
01:40:21,555 --> 01:40:23,488
I'm coming!

1487
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:26,459
Mom! What are you doing?

1488
01:40:26,461 --> 01:40:28,861
What are you waiting for? Get the dinghy!

1489
01:40:28,863 --> 01:40:30,143
Get the dinghy, bro!

1490
01:40:31,599 --> 01:40:33,933
I never want to be
apart from you!

1491
01:40:33,935 --> 01:40:36,438
I'll never
let you go again!

1492
01:40:40,475 --> 01:40:41,595
Leonardo!

1493
01:40:48,548 --> 01:40:51,708
Never actually been in this thing, bro.

1494
01:41:15,909 --> 01:41:17,645
Mom! What is he doing?

1495
01:41:18,712 --> 01:41:19,911
I don't know!

1496
01:41:19,913 --> 01:41:21,746
I'm negotiating!

1497
01:41:21,748 --> 01:41:23,715
Kate, get in here!
You're gonna drown. Come on!

1498
01:41:26,787 --> 01:41:27,789
Leo!

1499
01:41:59,886 --> 01:42:01,789
Honey, are you coming?

1500
01:42:08,895 --> 01:42:10,896
This is not how I envisioned
this moment.

1501
01:42:10,898 --> 01:42:12,964
I know. I know.

1502
01:42:12,966 --> 01:42:15,701
It's just that most people
don't actually

1503
01:42:15,703 --> 01:42:17,769
have to choose between
love and money.

1504
01:42:17,771 --> 01:42:19,573
It's not easy.

1505
01:42:38,059 --> 01:42:41,192
It's easy. I choose you.

1506
01:42:41,194 --> 01:42:43,661
<i>Oye,</i> Leo, you're giving up
a lot, dude.

1507
01:42:43,663 --> 01:42:46,632
No one would begrudge you if you
wanted to take a few minutes.

1508
01:42:46,634 --> 01:42:47,967
Bobby, would you stay
out of this?

1509
01:42:47,969 --> 01:42:48,934
What? I'm just saying!

1510
01:42:48,936 --> 01:42:51,669
Love fades, okay?
I mean, it's wonderful.

1511
01:42:51,671 --> 01:42:54,005
But some of the excitement
goes away. Now, money...

1512
01:42:54,007 --> 01:42:56,174
Bobby! Shut the hell up!

1513
01:42:56,176 --> 01:42:59,077
- You shut up, babe!
- Yeah! Shut the hell up!

1514
01:42:59,079 --> 01:43:00,649
Kate, listen.

1515
01:43:01,849 --> 01:43:04,049
My life was richer
when I was poor with you

1516
01:43:04,051 --> 01:43:05,854
than when I had all the money
in the world.

1517
01:43:09,155 --> 01:43:11,156
If I jump back in the water,

1518
01:43:11,158 --> 01:43:13,726
will you promise
to kiss me this time?

1519
01:43:13,728 --> 01:43:14,762
Yes.

1520
01:43:31,412 --> 01:43:32,646
Go, Kate!

1521
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:35,680
<i>Ay.</i>

1522
01:43:46,661 --> 01:43:47,960
Go, Mom!

1523
01:43:58,905 --> 01:44:00,973
Lunches are done!

1524
01:44:00,975 --> 01:44:02,875
Bobby's picking me up in five.

1525
01:44:02,877 --> 01:44:05,143
All right. You sure you can pick
up the girls from school today?

1526
01:44:05,145 --> 01:44:06,978
- Uh, yeah.
- I got it.

1527
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:08,813
Emily, tell him I'm coming.

1528
01:44:08,815 --> 01:44:09,815
Yes.

1529
01:44:09,817 --> 01:44:11,717
Then I'll drop Olivia
at football practice,

1530
01:44:11,719 --> 01:44:12,886
but you have to pick her up.

1531
01:44:14,154 --> 01:44:16,888
- Colin?
- Hello again.

1532
01:44:16,890 --> 01:44:19,124
What on Earth?

1533
01:44:20,927 --> 01:44:22,663
Hey, come here.

1534
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:24,295
What are you doing here?

1535
01:44:24,297 --> 01:44:25,464
I was hoping you might
be in the market

1536
01:44:25,466 --> 01:44:29,034
for a top-notch, Scottish nanny
with excellent references.

1537
01:44:29,036 --> 01:44:30,803
You know I'd love that,

1538
01:44:30,805 --> 01:44:33,205
but there's no way
we can afford you.

1539
01:44:33,207 --> 01:44:35,206
Well, in fact you can, sir.

1540
01:44:35,208 --> 01:44:36,875
Sofia sent me back
with the yacht.

1541
01:44:36,877 --> 01:44:37,809
She wanted to remind you

1542
01:44:37,811 --> 01:44:40,778
it was a birthday present
from your father.

1543
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:43,717
The deed is in your name.
It's still yours.

1544
01:44:45,786 --> 01:44:47,986
Oh, my God.

1545
01:44:47,988 --> 01:44:49,824
You mean I can sell it?

1546
01:44:50,858 --> 01:44:52,156
It must be worth a fortune.

1547
01:44:52,158 --> 01:44:53,795
Over 60 million.

1548
01:44:57,832 --> 01:44:58,833
Pesos?

1549
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,970
God, no, ma'am. Dollars.

1550
01:45:03,837 --> 01:45:04,937
Oh.

1551
01:45:19,886 --> 01:45:23,254
By the power invested in me
by the Royal Norwegian Navy,

1552
01:45:23,256 --> 01:45:25,759
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1553
01:45:32,533 --> 01:45:34,936
- Go, Mom!
- Go, Mom!

1554
01:45:36,203 --> 01:45:37,839
Go, Dad!

1555
01:46:18,112 --> 01:46:19,210
<i>Okay.</i>

1556
01:46:19,212 --> 01:46:21,379
Before I toast the happy couple,

1557
01:46:21,381 --> 01:46:23,882
let me just dispel a few rumors

1558
01:46:23,884 --> 01:46:25,017
that have been floating around

1559
01:46:25,019 --> 01:46:27,119
about me being cheated on.

1560
01:46:27,121 --> 01:46:31,123
Never happened. Okay?
Not once, not ever.

1561
01:46:31,125 --> 01:46:34,061
There's just so much
I wanna say.

1562
01:46:34,595 --> 01:46:36,164
But I'm not a poet.

1563
01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:39,130
I don't have words.

1564
01:46:39,132 --> 01:46:40,902
I have music.

1565
01:46:51,244 --> 01:46:55,046
I'm so sorry I couldn't
be there to celebrate with you.

1566
01:46:55,048 --> 01:46:58,183
But I'm here in the Philippines,

1567
01:46:58,185 --> 01:47:01,986
spearheading the Montenegros'
Children's Education Initiative,

1568
01:47:01,988 --> 01:47:05,424
and, oh, I've been here
helping these kids

1569
01:47:05,426 --> 01:47:10,062
have a happier, better life,
and they adore me.

1570
01:47:10,064 --> 01:47:12,296
- Right?
- No.

1571
01:47:12,298 --> 01:47:13,432
When we first met,

1572
01:47:13,434 --> 01:47:15,467
I was the catch. Okay?

1573
01:47:15,469 --> 01:47:17,436
I was the football player.

1574
01:47:17,438 --> 01:47:19,170
I was the quarterback,
all right?

1575
01:47:19,172 --> 01:47:20,638
She didn't even make
cheerleader.

1576
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:22,307
She was on the spirit squad.

1577
01:47:22,309 --> 01:47:23,978
When I look at Leo...

1578
01:47:25,112 --> 01:47:26,381
When I look at Kate...

1579
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:31,631
When I look at Leo and Kate...

1580
01:47:44,297 --> 01:47:47,232
Right now, I'm backstage

1581
01:47:47,234 --> 01:47:49,166
at the Golden Pond
Retirement Home,

1582
01:47:49,168 --> 01:47:51,202
about five minutes from curtain.

1583
01:47:51,204 --> 01:47:53,504
I'm playing Hodel
in <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

1584
01:47:53,506 --> 01:47:56,906
And I thought now was a good
time to talk about allowance.

1585
01:48:02,949 --> 01:48:07,119
<i>♪ Leo has the best spaghetti
I ever tasted ♪</i>

1586
01:48:07,121 --> 01:48:09,153
I have never in all my puff
been at a wedding

1587
01:48:09,155 --> 01:48:10,354
where there's been a free bar.

1588
01:48:10,356 --> 01:48:12,491
Usually, at the end, the
tries to settle up the bill.

1589
01:48:12,493 --> 01:48:13,692
And they're,
"Oh, no, I didn't have it.

1590
01:48:13,694 --> 01:48:15,259
"I only had beer,
you"

1591
01:48:15,261 --> 01:48:16,495
There's always a
at a wedding.

1592
01:48:17,997 --> 01:48:19,317
Leonardo.

1593
01:48:29,409 --> 01:48:32,145
Bobby has asked me
to read a prepared statement.

1594
01:48:34,148 --> 01:48:36,214
"I never cheated on my husband.

1595
01:48:36,216 --> 01:48:37,214
"I never would.

1596
01:48:37,216 --> 01:48:39,176
