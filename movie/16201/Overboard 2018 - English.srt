1
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,563
If you're gonna trash me in front of
the gringos, do it in Spanish.

2
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,982
Yeah, none of them speak Spanish.

3
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:30,900
Bye...

4
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,110
Ladies.

5
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,286
Why won't he answer?

6
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,998
I'm sure he's on that floating orgy.

7
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,249
I need him here.

8
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,585
Easy, Papi, you'll get better.

9
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,753
You don't know that!

10
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,296
Neither does he!

11
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,007
And he's the idiot who
cut out my gallbladder...

12
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,301
and gave me this mystery infection.

13
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,637
I need Leonardo in Mexico City.

14
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,305
I made my decision.

15
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,350
I'm handing Montenegro Industries
over to him.

16
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,353
That's absurd!

17
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,607
He's not capable of running a
multi-national corporation.

18
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,736
He'll rise to the occasion.

19
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,364
Like I did when I had to...

20
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,992
that summer in 1961...

21
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,161
Here it comes... Vienna.

22
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,789
I met the love of my life... in Vienna.

23
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,377
But Mom said you met in Barcelona.

24
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,628
Yeah, I met her there.

25
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,965
But in Vienna, I met this dancer--

26
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,801
Listen to me.

27
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,761
I'm the one with the experience.

28
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,390
Magda, now's not the time.

29
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,933
I'm just saying...

30
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,937
he should leave the company to
someone who <i>actually </i>works there.

31
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,479
And me?

32
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,063
What?

33
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,983
Why do you always belittle my work
with our chritable division?

34
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,652
Of course!

35
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,072
Because of you a bunch of
poor kids can play violin.

36
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,824
The world's a better place.

37
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,493
You mock me, but
classical music saved my life!

38
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,579
Anti-depressants saved your life!

39
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,790
It's not a violin, it's a cello!
-Stop it, you two!

40
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,208
I made my decision.

41
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,543
...it's a cello.

42
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,586
Find your brother

43
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,964
and bring him home before
this butcher kills me.

44
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,675
God, unbelievable!

45
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,927
- Papi, you're going to--
- Leave me be!

46
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,133
Wanna join us
in the jacuzzi?

47
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,968
Yes, my little angel.

48
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,454
The mechanic agrees with me, dumbass.

49
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,485
...so we'll fly to Mexico tonight.

50
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,863
No, we'll take the boat.

51
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,242
Papi is dying.

52
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,119
He'll hold on.

53
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,913
He's too stubborn to die quickly.

54
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:04,581
Listen.

55
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,292
When I'm in charge, will
there be a lot of meetings?

56
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,002
Because I've been thinking...

57
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,879
of buying a soccer team.

58
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,089
Sounds fun, right?

59
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,592
You are unbelievable.

60
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,384
What?

61
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,678
You're a child!

62
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,471
What?

63
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,931
The company should be mine.

64
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,933
I do all the work.

65
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,519
You can still do all the work.

66
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,439
I'll be the pretty face...

67
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,648
...obviously.

68
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,859
You'll be the brains.
It's a win - win.

69
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,029
Why does Papi have
these old, macho ideas?

70
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,781
That's not the reason.

71
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,032
Then what?

72
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,743
I think he just...

73
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,370
loves me more.

74
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,247
It's true. Don't be upset.

75
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,752
Look -- I love you. I love you a lot.

76
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,379
But...

77
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,047
you can be unpleasant.

78
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,006
I want to shoot myself.

79
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,633
Even you can't stand yourself.

80
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,009
I wish you were never born.

81
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,011
You need to relax.

82
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,221
I'm calling my masseuse.

83
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,639
God, help me.

84
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,890
Deep tissue or hot rocks?

85
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,725
I want nothing -- shut up!

86
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,394
Four hands?

87
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,576
I'm drunk.

88
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,578
Good, I'll take advantage of you.

89
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,095
Is there a problem?

90
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,284
Don't take too long.

91
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,168
Hi, Papi.

92
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,340
All good -- just hit a wave.

93
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,014
...everything's under control.

94
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,560
"Pancho's" having dinner tonight!

95
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,337
Help me!

96
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,382
Bringing him home safe and sound.

97
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:21,846
Please! Help!

98
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:36,147
Papi's getting weaker.
Where's Leonardo?

99
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,666
Carlos, you still making fake documents?

100
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,044
Absolutely not.

101
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,838
Out of that racket.

102
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,549
I'm a law-abiding American citizen.

103
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:44,050
What is that noise?!

104
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:43,943
Welcome, man.

105
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:47,489
Damn, you got some soft hands.

106
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,949
What've you been doing?

107
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:52,118
Back off -- poor guy's got amnesia.

108
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,538
I know what he's been doing.
Working at a nail salon.

109
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,625
Those are some real lady hands.

110
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:36,955
A little bit?

111
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:48,341
I wish I could've brought
his body home, but...

112
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:50,677
...the shark did too much damage.

113
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:59,144
Why does my son smell like meat?

114
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:04,065
Because, in the end...

115
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:06,234
that's what we all are...

116
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:07,861
Hamburger.

117
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:11,322
You'll be throwing me on
the grill soon enough.

118
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,450
- Oh, my God!
- Don't say that!

119
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:17,912
The new antibiotic's going to work.

120
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:21,750
I know this is an emotional time,

121
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,877
but perhaps we should talk about

122
00:42:23,918 --> 00:42:25,837
the future of the company.

123
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,756
There's nothing to talk about.

124
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:29,215
When I'm in the ground,

125
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:30,300
you're in charge.

126
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,928
I'm humbled, Papi.

127
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:37,057
Look at you -- the crown
you always dreamed of.

128
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:38,558
That's what you wanted, right?

129
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:40,602
Yes.

130
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:42,812
But not like this.

131
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:44,606
Not like this.

132
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:24,354
Sorry, mister. I don't speak English.

133
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:49,713
What happened, Lady Hands?

134
00:43:49,754 --> 00:43:51,715
Lose your memory and your muscles?

135
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:55,635
Come on!

136
00:43:56,511 --> 00:43:57,512
With gusto, buddy.

137
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:09,399
Lady Hands, do it like a man!

138
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:11,067
Go for it, dude!

139
00:44:18,783 --> 00:44:21,494
Do it again!
I need to film that!

140
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,792
He flipped like a monkey!

141
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:49,554
Turn that thing off!

142
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:51,222
You're spraying me!

143
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:04,694
Let's get it done!

144
00:49:29,928 --> 00:49:31,304
...and I don't know,

145
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:32,722
I feel like...

146
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:35,558
I'm stuck in a life that isn't mine.

147
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,060
I mean...

148
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:38,812
look at this guy with his mansion

149
00:49:38,853 --> 00:49:41,731
and his view of the ocean.

150
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:45,151
I feel like that should be my life.

151
00:49:45,193 --> 00:49:49,823
Yeah, you should be living like
Bill Gates or Carlos Slim

152
00:49:49,864 --> 00:49:52,534
with a big house and a private jet.

153
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:55,161
Me too, man.

154
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:56,830
That's why I play the lottery.

155
00:49:56,871 --> 00:50:02,752
Every Friday at the same time,
I buy the same numbers.

156
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:05,755
12 - 21 - 45
My lucky numbers.

157
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:09,092
The day the Godfather got
shot buying oranges.

158
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,261
Those numbers are
really working for you!

159
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:14,264
You don't understand.

160
00:50:14,305 --> 00:50:19,728
I feel like something's profoundly wrong.

161
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:21,980
Sometimes I look at my wife and...

162
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:24,107
I have no idea who this person is.

163
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:25,650
Tell me about it.

164
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,986
You should've seen Sonia in high school.

165
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:30,363
She was smokin' hot.

166
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:33,742
Now I barely recognize her.

167
00:50:33,783 --> 00:50:35,035
She got really ugly.

168
00:50:35,076 --> 00:50:36,911
Trust me, she's disappointed too.

169
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:39,748
He's one to talk.

170
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:41,041
No, I'm serious.

171
00:50:41,082 --> 00:50:43,418
I don't feel like we're really
husband and wife.

172
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,131
We haven't had sex in
I don't know how long.

173
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:49,883
Really, I have no idea.

174
00:50:49,924 --> 00:50:52,260
You know the last time
I had sex with my wife?

175
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:54,679
Nine months before
my daughter was born.

176
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:56,556
She just turned three.

177
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:58,558
- Quick, move away.
- He's looking at us!

178
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:06,358
Yeah, an "artist".

179
00:51:20,705 --> 00:51:22,165
Come on, let's go.

180
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:25,919
Kiss my ass!

181
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,962
You know I can take you!

182
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,800
The thing is, the thing is...

183
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:35,095
I feel like I'm just a paycheck.

184
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:36,721
Lady Hands...

185
00:51:36,763 --> 00:51:38,223
that's what you are.

186
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:41,518
But not a very good one.

187
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:44,020
Pathetic.

188
00:51:44,312 --> 00:51:46,564
We all feel this way, man.

189
00:51:46,606 --> 00:51:48,066
- Really!
- Absolutely.

190
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:49,526
- All of you?
- All of us.

191
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:51,152
Welcome to the club.

192
00:51:51,194 --> 00:51:53,446
Listen, Lady Hands, you're blessed.

193
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:55,490
You got a decent job.

194
00:51:56,741 --> 00:52:00,286
A wife who puts up with your crap.
Three beautiful, healthy girls.

195
00:52:00,578 --> 00:52:01,830
Will you wake me
when he's done?

196
00:52:01,871 --> 00:52:03,081
Don't be a jerk.

197
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:09,796
Know what Don Corleone
would say to you?

198
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:13,258
He'd say: "Act like a man."

199
00:52:15,593 --> 00:52:17,887
And then he'd slap you.
Do I need to slap you?

200
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:20,640
No. I got it, I got it.

201
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:22,017
Well, then...

202
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:46,745
I'm having a hard time, Papi.

203
00:54:46,786 --> 00:54:48,788
Remember when I went to New York

204
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:51,374
to try to be a concert cellist?

205
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:53,835
You were furious and cut me off.

206
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:57,630
And I've forgiven you.

207
00:54:58,298 --> 00:54:59,507
Mostly.

208
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,719
But Leonardo was there for me.

209
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:04,721
He flew to New York and...

210
00:55:04,763 --> 00:55:07,265
helped me decorate my apartment.

211
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:10,435
He was the only one
who believed in my talent.

212
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:11,936
Always.

213
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:16,524
His death was very sudden...

214
00:55:16,566 --> 00:55:19,778
and Magda's been so vague
about the details...

215
00:55:37,253 --> 00:55:39,798
Oh my God, how much do
these things weigh?

216
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,174
90 pounds.

217
00:55:41,216 --> 00:55:42,842
It's cruel.

218
00:55:42,884 --> 00:55:46,346
They should make it so an actual
human being can carry them.

219
00:55:46,388 --> 00:55:48,682
Probably save like
3 cents a bag this way.

220
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:53,520
Greedy bastards.

221
00:55:53,561 --> 00:55:55,188
Hey, it's payday.

222
00:55:56,856 --> 00:55:58,316
About time.

223
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:01,653
Thank you, boss.

224
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:03,238
Here you go, Leo.

225
00:56:03,279 --> 00:56:05,532
And the client wats us to
leave early so he can...

226
00:56:05,573 --> 00:56:07,575
get a massage or count
his money or something.

227
00:56:10,286 --> 00:56:11,746
Watch out!

228
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:15,792
What're you staring at?

229
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:19,462
It can't be, but this feels like
the first paycheck I ever got.

230
00:56:19,504 --> 00:56:20,964
Don't lose it, Lady Hands.

231
01:05:23,798 --> 01:05:25,884
What happened to Catalina?

232
01:05:25,925 --> 01:05:26,968
She lost the baby.

233
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,470
She lost it?

234
01:05:29,637 --> 01:05:31,473
Now Arturo will never marry her.

235
01:05:31,514 --> 01:05:33,475
Of course not. Never.

236
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:58,226
Yeah, it's boring. I hate it.

237
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:45,482
Go have fun.

238
01:10:03,328 --> 01:10:04,954
Don't bury me yet.

239
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:07,874
I'm all better.

240
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:10,377
Easy, you're still recovering.

241
01:10:10,418 --> 01:10:12,420
I just peed on my own.

242
01:10:12,462 --> 01:10:16,424
Can you believe
this quack was right?

243
01:10:16,466 --> 01:10:18,468
I've been right for 30 years.

244
01:10:20,011 --> 01:10:22,222
I'm filled with happiness!

245
01:10:22,263 --> 01:10:25,266
You can dial it back.
You still get the company.

246
01:10:26,893 --> 01:10:29,312
Probably should've given it
to you from the start.

247
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:32,941
I'm humbled, Papi.

248
01:23:09,864 --> 01:23:11,366
My God!

249
01:23:14,786 --> 01:23:16,788
Leonardo, you always
supported my musical dreams.

250
01:23:18,081 --> 01:23:20,250
Like you said, "When
God gives you a gift...

251
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:22,293
it's your responsibility to use it."

252
01:23:23,586 --> 01:23:26,214
This is for you. It's Bach.

253
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:34,305
It was here, that fateful night...

254
01:23:34,347 --> 01:23:38,059
when Leonardo bravely fought

255
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:42,022
the savage shark and perished.

256
01:23:42,063 --> 01:23:44,899
Today, his remais can--

257
01:23:44,941 --> 01:23:49,738
Sofia, that's enough.
Thank you, my dear.

258
01:23:49,779 --> 01:23:54,909
Today his remains can
join the rest of his body.

259
01:23:54,951 --> 01:23:59,372
Let's each take a handful
of our beloved Leonardo...

260
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:03,168
and say our final goodbyes.

261
01:24:12,677 --> 01:24:15,180
He's alive! Leonardo's alive!

262
01:24:19,225 --> 01:24:21,853
He's alive!

263
01:24:52,759 --> 01:24:54,344
Thank you, my love.

264
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:56,012
You changed my life.

265
01:26:56,299 --> 01:26:59,552
He's been through a lot.
Let's not overwhelm him.

266
01:30:26,676 --> 01:30:28,136
Come on, son.

267
01:32:52,822 --> 01:32:55,283
You've made me very happy.

268
01:32:55,325 --> 01:32:56,451
My father...

269
01:32:56,493 --> 01:33:01,539
Leonardo Montenegro,
founded the company 100 years ago.

270
01:33:01,581 --> 01:33:03,208
And now I can retire...

271
01:33:03,249 --> 01:33:04,668
knowing my son,

272
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:08,505
Leonardo Eduardo Gustavo
de la Cruz Montenegro y Nieto,

273
01:33:08,546 --> 01:33:10,382
will lead us into the future.

274
01:33:11,591 --> 01:33:12,550
What?

275
01:33:12,592 --> 01:33:14,844
You said I was going to be in charge.

276
01:33:14,886 --> 01:33:16,471
Well...

277
01:33:16,513 --> 01:33:19,516
Life gave me lemons and
I was trying to make lemonade.

278
01:33:19,557 --> 01:33:21,059
Don't get upset.

279
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:22,936
I'm going to need your help.

280
01:33:22,977 --> 01:33:25,355
This is all new to me.

281
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:27,065
But I have some ideas.

282
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:29,317
See, he already has ideas.

283
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:30,151
For example...

284
01:33:30,193 --> 01:33:32,987
we should sell 30 pound bags of cement

285
01:33:33,029 --> 01:33:34,280
in addition to the 90.

286
01:33:34,322 --> 01:33:35,115
Here's why--

287
01:33:35,156 --> 01:33:38,284
Do you have any idea
how much that would

288
01:33:38,326 --> 01:33:40,328
increase production cost?

289
01:33:41,496 --> 01:33:42,956
Ballpark --

290
01:33:44,499 --> 01:33:45,959
Three million. A year.

291
01:33:47,002 --> 01:33:49,754
Have you ever carried
a bag of cement?

292
01:33:49,796 --> 01:33:51,172
They give you a hernia.

293
01:33:51,214 --> 01:33:53,925
Who cares?

294
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:55,802
The people carrying them.

295
01:33:56,428 --> 01:33:59,014
Are you listening to this nonsense?

296
01:33:59,055 --> 01:34:00,849
Give him time, Magda.

297
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:02,892
The cub will become a lion.

298
01:36:40,258 --> 01:36:41,259
Good morning, Papi.

299
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:42,510
Morning, son.

300
01:36:42,552 --> 01:36:43,595
Coffee?

301
01:36:43,636 --> 01:36:44,763
Yes, thank you.

302
01:36:44,804 --> 01:36:46,681
Beautiful weather we're having.

303
01:36:46,723 --> 01:36:48,183
Yes.

304
01:36:48,975 --> 01:36:50,143
What the heck?!

305
01:36:50,185 --> 01:36:52,103
Why is the sun rising over there?

306
01:36:53,021 --> 01:36:54,856
Because we're headed back to Oregon.

307
01:36:54,898 --> 01:36:57,067
What? Why?!

308
01:36:57,108 --> 01:36:59,527
To be with that con artist?

309
01:37:00,111 --> 01:37:01,529
Absolutely not!

310
01:37:01,571 --> 01:37:02,697
I forbid it!

311
01:37:03,323 --> 01:37:04,157
Papi, wait.

312
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:05,158
Let's talk about this.

313
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,910
No! I'm turning this boat around!

314
01:37:06,951 --> 01:37:08,870
We're going back to Mexico!

315
01:37:08,912 --> 01:37:10,538
Papi, listen to me.

316
01:37:11,247 --> 01:37:12,832
This is ridiculous.

317
01:37:12,874 --> 01:37:14,042
What's going on?

318
01:37:14,084 --> 01:37:16,127
I'm stopping your brother

319
01:37:16,169 --> 01:37:17,754
from throwing his life away

320
01:37:17,796 --> 01:37:20,256
for some pizza nurse!

321
01:37:20,298 --> 01:37:23,385
I'm a grown man!
I can be with who I want!

322
01:37:23,426 --> 01:37:25,345
Yes, follow your heart.

323
01:37:25,387 --> 01:37:27,138
What about the company?

324
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:29,516
You have responsibilities.

325
01:37:29,557 --> 01:37:32,477
For once in your life, do the right thing!

326
01:37:32,519 --> 01:37:34,270
For the first time, I am!

327
01:37:34,312 --> 01:37:37,065
I adore this new Leonardo.
So romantic.

328
01:37:37,107 --> 01:37:38,358
I say go for it.

329
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:38,942
Right?

330
01:37:38,983 --> 01:37:41,778
Yes, of course you want
him out of the picture.

331
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,238
Look what I found...

332
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:45,573
in something called "The Beachcomber."

333
01:37:52,956 --> 01:37:54,040
That was you.

334
01:37:54,874 --> 01:37:56,001
What?

335
01:37:56,042 --> 01:37:59,879
You deliberately left
Leonardo in that hospital.

336
01:38:01,214 --> 01:38:02,132
Is this true?

337
01:38:02,173 --> 01:38:03,216
Of course not.

338
01:38:03,258 --> 01:38:05,635
That could've been any woman
from Mexico City...

339
01:38:05,677 --> 01:38:07,429
yachting off the Oregon coast.

340
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:09,097
Yeah, because there are so many.

341
01:38:09,139 --> 01:38:11,099
You left him there!

342
01:38:11,141 --> 01:38:14,019
- To rot!
- Please, Papi, you know I would never...

343
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:14,602
Quiet!

344
01:38:14,644 --> 01:38:15,603
She's lost her mind!

345
01:38:15,645 --> 01:38:17,522
You're sinister!

346
01:38:17,564 --> 01:38:18,398
Quiet!

347
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:19,816
You're a lying goat!

348
01:39:03,401 --> 01:39:04,861
Don't turn around!

349
01:39:05,612 --> 01:39:06,696
Open the door!

350
01:39:06,738 --> 01:39:08,114
Papi, please!

351
01:39:08,156 --> 01:39:09,074
Let me in!

352
01:39:09,115 --> 01:39:11,576
No! That woman brainwashed you!

353
01:40:11,261 --> 01:40:12,721
That fool!

354
01:40:13,138 --> 01:40:14,264
Take the helm!

355
01:40:41,124 --> 01:40:43,293
If you do this...

356
01:40:43,335 --> 01:40:44,044
it's over!

357
01:40:44,085 --> 01:40:45,462
No turning back!

358
01:40:45,503 --> 01:40:46,546
I don't care!

359
01:40:46,588 --> 01:40:47,797
I love her!

360
01:40:50,383 --> 01:40:52,010
I'll cut you off!

361
01:40:52,052 --> 01:40:53,053
I swear!

362
01:40:53,511 --> 01:40:54,971
So be it!

363
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:57,182
You'll be disinherited!

364
01:40:57,223 --> 01:40:59,559
You won't have a penny to your name!

365
01:41:01,978 --> 01:41:03,188
Not a penny?

366
01:41:03,355 --> 01:41:04,564
Nothing!

367
01:41:04,898 --> 01:41:06,316
You'll be a pauper!

368
01:41:06,649 --> 01:41:07,859
Wait! Wait!

369
01:41:08,318 --> 01:41:10,278
Let's not overreact!

370
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,988
We can work something out!

371
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:14,491
What if I keep the Swiss accounts?

372
01:41:14,532 --> 01:41:15,367
No!

373
01:41:23,541 --> 01:41:26,419
And don't even think about
running Montenegro Industries!

374
01:41:27,504 --> 01:41:30,006
Your sister will be in charge!

375
01:41:30,674 --> 01:41:32,425
I'm humbled, Papi.

376
01:41:32,467 --> 01:41:33,635
Not you.

377
01:41:33,677 --> 01:41:34,844
I'm giving it to Sofia.

378
01:41:34,886 --> 01:41:36,513
You left your brother for dead.

379
01:41:41,059 --> 01:41:42,727
You're firing me?

380
01:41:42,769 --> 01:41:44,979
You're kicking me out of the family?

381
01:41:45,397 --> 01:41:46,648
Of course not.

382
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:50,694
We're putting you in charge
of our charitable division.

383
01:41:50,735 --> 01:41:52,320
The smelly, poor kids?!

384
01:41:52,362 --> 01:41:53,571
Yep.

385
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:56,241
You're so insensitive!

386
01:41:57,409 --> 01:41:59,619
Son, listen carefully.

387
01:42:01,371 --> 01:42:03,665
This is your last chance.

388
01:42:03,707 --> 01:42:05,208
What if you give me...

389
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,502
a generous monthly stipend?

390
01:42:07,544 --> 01:42:08,545
No!

391
01:42:19,222 --> 01:42:22,058
How about one lump sum,
held in trust--

392
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:23,059
No!

393
01:42:23,101 --> 01:42:24,936
It's all or nothing!

394
01:42:26,104 --> 01:42:27,731
That's your final offer?

395
01:42:27,772 --> 01:42:29,274
Final!

396
01:42:32,527 --> 01:42:33,737
Okay.

397
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:28,249
Sir, do you want to adopt me?

398
01:43:36,299 --> 01:43:37,842
A rich guy with amnesia,

399
01:43:37,884 --> 01:43:39,928
a big-hearted poor girl,

400
01:43:39,969 --> 01:43:42,389
a disapproving father, an evil sister...

401
01:43:43,807 --> 01:43:45,433
Real life is better than a telenovela.

402
01:45:26,451 --> 01:45:27,869
You may kiss the bride.

403
01:46:40,525 --> 01:46:44,029
I'm very happy for Leonardo.

404
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:48,158
You are very happy for Leonardo.

405
01:46:48,199 --> 01:46:50,994
She is very happy for Leonardo.

406
01:47:31,493 --> 01:47:32,702
The words of Vito Corleone.

407
01:47:33,745 --> 01:47:36,873
A wise man. A man of intelligence.

408
01:47:36,915 --> 01:47:40,377
Sure, he killed many people.

409
01:47:40,418 --> 01:47:43,755
But always for work...
never for pleasure.

410
01:47:55,684 --> 01:47:59,729
When you stab
somebody for pleasure...

411
01:47:59,771 --> 01:48:02,315
you cut out his intestines and guts.

412
01:48:18,832 --> 01:48:20,792
You're still disinherited.

413
01:48:20,834 --> 01:48:23,503
But I'm still going to buy the yacht.

414
01:48:23,545 --> 01:48:24,838
Not for you.

415
01:48:24,879 --> 01:48:27,257
For my beautiful granddaughters.

416
01:48:27,298 --> 01:48:29,175
They deserve the world.

417
01:48:38,601 --> 01:48:41,604
...you peel back the
skin and muscle.

418
01:48:41,646 --> 01:48:44,232
You take out the guts...
the intestines...

419
01:48:44,274 --> 01:48:47,444
the pancreas... the kidneys and --

420
01:48:47,485 --> 01:48:49,362
Anyway, congratulations to the
happy couple.

421
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:55,910
Vamos de fiesta!
