1
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,560
If you're gonna trash me in front of
the gringos, do it in Spanish.

2
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,980
Yeah, none of them speak Spanish.

3
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,100
Huh.

4
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,900
Bye...

5
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,110
Ladies.

6
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,280
Why won't he answer?

7
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,990
I'm sure he's on that floating orgy.

8
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,240
I need him here.

9
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,580
Easy, Papi, you'll get better.

10
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,750
You don't know that!

11
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,290
Neither does he!

12
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,000
And he's the idiot who
cut out my gallbladder...

13
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,300
and gave me this mystery infection.

14
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,630
I need Leonardo in Mexico City.

15
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,300
I made my decision.

16
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,350
I'm handing Montenegro Industries
over to him.

17
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,350
That's absurd!

18
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,600
He's not capable of running a
multi-national corporation.

19
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,730
He'll rise to the occasion.

20
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,360
Like I did when I had to...

21
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,990
that summer in 1961...

22
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,160
Here it comes... Vienna.

23
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,780
I met the love of my life... in Vienna.

24
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,370
But Mom said you met in Barcelona.

25
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,620
Yeah, I met her there.

26
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,960
But in Vienna, I met this dancer--

27
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,460
- Papa. Papa.
- Mmm-hmm.

28
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,800
Listen to me.

29
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,760
I'm the one with the experience.

30
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,390
Magda, now's not the time.

31
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,930
I'm just saying...

32
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,930
he should leave the company to
someone who <i>actually </i>works there.

33
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,470
And me?

34
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,060
What?

35
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,980
Why do you always belittle my work
with our chritable division?

36
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,650
Of course!

37
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,070
Because of you a bunch of
poor kids can play violin.

38
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,820
The world's a better place.

39
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,490
You mock me, but
classical music saved my life!

40
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,570
Anti-depressants saved your life!

41
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,790
It's not a violin, it's a cello!
-Stop it, you two!

42
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,200
I made my decision.

43
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,540
...it's a cello.

44
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
Find your brother

45
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,960
and bring him home before
this butcher kills me.

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,670
God, unbelievable!

47
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,920
- Papi, you're going to--
- Leave me be!

48
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,130
Wanna join us
in the jacuzzi?

49
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,960
Yes, my little angel.

50
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,290
The mechanic agrees with me, dumbass.

51
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
...so we'll fly to Mexico tonight.

52
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,860
No, we'll take the boat.

53
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,240
Papi is dying.

54
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,110
He'll hold on.

55
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,910
He's too stubborn to die quickly.

56
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,580
Listen.

57
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,290
When I'm in charge, will
there be a lot of meetings?

58
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,000
Because I've been thinking...

59
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,870
of buying a soccer team.

60
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,080
Sounds fun, right?

61
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,590
You are unbelievable.

62
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,380
What?

63
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,670
You're a child!

64
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,470
What?

65
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,930
The company should be mine.

66
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,930
I do all the work.

67
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,510
You can still do all the work.

68
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,430
I'll be the pretty face...

69
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,640
...obviously.

70
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,850
You'll be the brains.
It's a win - win.

71
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,020
Why does Papi have
these old, macho ideas?

72
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,780
That's not the reason.

73
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,030
Then what?

74
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,740
I think he just...

75
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,370
loves me more.

76
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,240
It's true. Don't be upset.

77
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,750
Look -- I love you. I love you a lot.

78
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,370
But...

79
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,040
you can be unpleasant.

80
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,000
I want to shoot myself.

81
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,630
Even you can't stand yourself.

82
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,000
I wish you were never born.

83
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,010
You need to relax.

84
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,220
I'm calling my masseuse.

85
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,630
God, help me.

86
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,890
Deep tissue or hot rocks?

87
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,720
I want nothing -- shut up!

88
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,390
Four hands?

89
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,570
I'm drunk.

90
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,570
Good, I'll take advantage of you.

91
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,890
Oops.

92
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,090
Is there a problem?

93
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,280
Don't take too long.

94
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,160
Hi, Papi.

95
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,340
All good -- just hit a wave.

96
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,010
...everything's under control.

97
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,560
"Pancho's" having dinner tonight!

98
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,380
Bringing him home safe and sound.

99
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,840
Please! Help!

100
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,936
~ Papi's getting weaker. Where's Leonardo? ~

101
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,660
Carlos, you still making fake documents?

102
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,040
Absolutely not.

103
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,830
Out of that racket.

104
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,540
I'm a law-abiding American citizen.

105
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:43,940
Welcome, man.

106
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,480
Damn, you got some soft hands.

107
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,940
What've you been doing?

108
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,110
Back off -- poor guy's got amnesia.

109
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,530
I know what he's been doing.
Working at a nail salon.

110
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,620
Those are some real lady hands.

111
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,950
A little bit?

112
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:48,340
I wish I could've brought
his body home, but...

113
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,670
...the shark did too much damage.

114
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,140
Why does my son smell like meat?

115
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,120
Uh...

116
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,060
Because, in the end...

117
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,230
that's what we all are...

118
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,860
Hamburger.

119
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,320
You'll be throwing me on
the grill soon enough.

120
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,450
- Oh, my God!
- Don't say that!

121
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,700
No, no, no.

122
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:17,910
The new antibiotic's going to work.

123
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,750
I know this is an emotional time,

124
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,870
but perhaps we should talk about

125
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,830
the future of the company.

126
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,750
There's nothing to talk about.

127
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,210
When I'm in the ground,

128
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,300
you're in charge.

129
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,920
I'm humbled, Papi.

130
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:37,050
Look at you -- the crown
you always dreamed of.

131
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,550
That's what you wanted, right?

132
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Yes.

133
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,810
But not like this.

134
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,600
Not like this.

135
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,840
- Coffee.
- Yes.

136
00:43:22,624 --> 00:43:24,350
Sorry, mister. I don't speak English.

137
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,710
What happened, Lady Hands?

138
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,710
Lose your memory and your muscles?

139
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,630
Come on!

140
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,510
With gusto, buddy.

141
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,390
Lady Hands, do it like a man!

142
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,060
Go for it, dude!

143
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,490
Do it again!
I need to film that!

144
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,790
He flipped like a monkey!

145
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,220
You're spraying me!

146
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,690
Let's get it done!

147
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,300
...and I don't know,

148
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,720
I feel like...

149
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,550
I'm stuck in a life that isn't mine.

150
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,060
I mean...

151
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,810
look at this guy with his mansion

152
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,730
and his view of the ocean.

153
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,150
I feel like that should be my life.

154
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:49,820
Yeah, you should be living like
Bill Gates or Carlos Slim

155
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,530
with a big house and a private jet.

156
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,160
Me too, man.

157
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,830
That's why I play the lottery.

158
00:49:56,870 --> 00:50:02,750
Every Friday at the same time,
I buy the same numbers.

159
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,750
12 - 21 - 45
My lucky numbers.

160
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:09,090
The day the Godfather got
shot buying oranges.

161
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:11,260
Those numbers are
really working for you!

162
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,260
You don't understand.

163
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:19,720
I feel like something's profoundly wrong.

164
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,980
Sometimes I look at my wife and...

165
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,100
I have no idea who this person is.

166
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,650
Tell me about it.

167
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,980
You should've seen Sonia in high school.

168
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,360
She was smokin' hot.

169
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,740
Now I barely recognize her.

170
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,030
She got really ugly.

171
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,910
Trust me, she's disappointed too.

172
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,740
He's one to talk.

173
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,040
No, I'm serious.

174
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,410
I don't feel like we're really
husband and wife.

175
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,130
We haven't had sex in
I don't know how long.

176
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,880
Really, I have no idea.

177
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,260
You know the last time
I had sex with my wife?

178
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,670
Nine months before
my daughter was born.

179
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,550
She just turned three.

180
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,550
- Quick, move away.
- He's looking at us!

181
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,350
Yeah, an "artist".

182
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,856
Come on, let's go.

183
00:51:24,336 --> 00:51:25,910
Kiss my ass!

184
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,960
You know I can take you!

185
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,800
The thing is, the thing is...

186
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,090
I feel like I'm just a paycheck.

187
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:36,720
Lady Hands...

188
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,220
that's what you are.

189
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,510
But not a very good one.

190
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,020
Pathetic.

191
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,560
We all feel this way, man.

192
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,060
- Really!
- Absolutely.

193
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,520
- All of you?
- All of us.

194
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,150
Welcome to the club.

195
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,440
Listen, Lady Hands, you're blessed.

196
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,490
You got a decent job.

197
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,280
A wife who puts up with your crap.
Three beautiful, healthy girls.

198
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:01,830
Will you wake me
when he's done?

199
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,080
Don't be a jerk.

200
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,790
Know what Don Corleone
would say to you?

201
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,250
He'd say: "Act like a man."

202
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,880
And then he'd slap you.
Do I need to slap you?

203
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,640
No. I got it, I got it.

204
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,810
Well, then...

205
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:46,740
I'm having a hard time, Papi.

206
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,780
Remember when I went to New York

207
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:51,370
to try to be a concert cellist?

208
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:53,830
You were furious and cut me off.

209
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,630
And I've forgiven you.

210
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,500
Mostly.

211
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,710
But Leonardo was there for me.

212
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,720
He flew to New York and...

213
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,260
helped me decorate my apartment.

214
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,430
He was the only one
who believed in my talent.

215
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,930
Always.

216
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,520
His death was very sudden...

217
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,770
and Magda's been so vague
about the details...

218
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,790
Oh my God, how much do
these things weigh?

219
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,170
90 pounds.

220
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,840
It's cruel.

221
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,340
They should make it so an actual
human being can carry them.

222
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,680
Probably save like
3 cents a bag this way.

223
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,820
Montenegro.

224
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,520
Greedy bastards.

225
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,180
Hey, it's payday.

226
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:58,060
About time.

227
00:55:58,310 --> 00:55:59,090
Burro.

228
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:00,770
Burrito.

229
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:01,650
Thank you, boss.

230
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,230
Here you go, Leo.

231
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:05,530
And the client wats us to
leave early so he can...

232
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,570
get a massage or count
his money or something.

233
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:10,280
Hey! Hey!

234
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,740
Watch out!

235
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,790
What're you staring at?

236
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,460
It can't be, but this feels like
the first paycheck I ever got.

237
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,960
Don't lose it, Lady Hands.

238
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,880
What happened to Catalina?

239
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,960
She lost the baby.

240
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,470
She lost it?

241
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:31,470
Now Arturo will never marry her.

242
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,470
Of course not. Never.

243
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:58,220
Yeah, it's boring. I hate it.

244
01:06:58,750 --> 01:06:59,850
<i>Muy bien.</i>

245
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:45,480
Go have fun.

246
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,230
<i>Gracias.</i>

247
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,950
Don't bury me yet.

248
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,530
<i>Ay,</i> Papa!

249
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,870
I'm all better.

250
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:10,370
Easy, you're still recovering.

251
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:12,420
I just peed on my own.

252
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:16,420
Can you believe
this quack was right?

253
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,460
I've been right for 30 years.

254
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:19,920
Papa!

255
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:22,220
I'm filled with happiness!

256
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,260
You can dial it back.
You still get the company.

257
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,310
Probably should've given it
to you from the start.

258
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:32,940
I'm humbled, Papi.

259
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,700
Colin,
were you with Magdalena

260
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,570
when she identified
my brother's body?

261
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,360
My God!

262
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:16,780
Leonardo, you always
supported my musical dreams.

263
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,250
Like you said, "When
God gives you a gift...

264
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:22,290
it's your responsibility to use it."

265
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:26,210
This is for you. It's Bach.

266
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:34,300
It was here, that fateful night...

267
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:38,050
when Leonardo bravely fought

268
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:42,020
the savage shark and perished.

269
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:44,890
Today, his remais can--

270
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:49,730
Sofia, that's enough.
Thank you, my dear.

271
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:54,900
Today his remains can
join the rest of his body.

272
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:59,370
Let's each take a handful
of our beloved Leonardo...

273
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:03,160
and say our final goodbyes.

274
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:12,650
It's Leonardo!

275
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:15,180
He's alive! Leonardo's alive!

276
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,850
He's alive!

277
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:54,340
Thank you, my love.

278
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:56,010
You changed my life.

279
01:26:56,290 --> 01:26:59,550
He's been through a lot.
Let's not overwhelm him.

280
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:28,130
Come on, son.

281
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:55,280
You've made me very happy.

282
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,450
My father...

283
01:32:56,490 --> 01:33:01,530
Leonardo Montenegro,
founded the company 100 years ago.

284
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:03,200
And now I can retire...

285
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,660
knowing my son,

286
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:08,500
Leonardo Eduardo Gustavo
de la Cruz Montenegro y Nieto,

287
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:10,380
will lead us into the future.

288
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:12,550
What?

289
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:14,840
You said I was going to be in charge.

290
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,470
Well...

291
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:19,510
Life gave me lemons and
I was trying to make lemonade.

292
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:21,050
Don't get upset.

293
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:22,930
I'm going to need your help.

294
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:25,350
This is all new to me.

295
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:27,060
But I have some ideas.

296
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:29,310
See, he already has ideas.

297
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:30,150
For example...

298
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:32,980
we should sell 30 pound bags of cement

299
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:34,280
in addition to the 90.

300
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,110
Here's why--

301
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:38,280
Do you have any idea
how much that would

302
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,320
increase production cost?

303
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:42,950
Ballpark --

304
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:45,950
Three million. A year.

305
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,750
Have you ever carried
a bag of cement?

306
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:51,170
They give you a hernia.

307
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:53,920
Who cares?

308
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,800
The people carrying them.

309
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:59,010
Are you listening to this nonsense?

310
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,840
Give him time, Magda.

311
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:02,890
The cub will become a lion.

312
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:41,250
Good morning, Papi.

313
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:42,510
Morning, son.

314
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:43,590
Coffee?

315
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:44,760
Yes, thank you.

316
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,680
Beautiful weather we're having.

317
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,180
Yes.

318
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:50,140
What the heck?!

319
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:52,100
Why is the sun rising over there?

320
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:54,850
Because we're headed back to Oregon.

321
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:57,060
What? Why?!

322
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,520
To be with that con artist?

323
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:01,520
Absolutely not!

324
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:02,690
I forbid it!

325
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:04,150
Papi, wait.

326
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:05,150
Let's talk about this.

327
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,910
No! I'm turning this boat around!

328
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:08,870
We're going back to Mexico!

329
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:10,530
Papi, listen to me.

330
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:12,830
This is ridiculous.

331
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:14,040
What's going on?

332
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,120
I'm stopping your brother

333
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,750
from throwing his life away

334
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:20,250
for some pizza nurse!

335
01:37:20,290 --> 01:37:23,380
I'm a grown man!
I can be with who I want!

336
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:25,340
Yes, follow your heart.

337
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:27,130
What about the company?

338
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:29,510
You have responsibilities.

339
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:32,470
For once in your life, do the right thing!

340
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:34,270
For the first time, I am!

341
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:37,060
I adore this new Leonardo.
So romantic.

342
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:38,350
I say go for it.

343
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:38,940
Right?

344
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:41,770
Yes, of course you want
him out of the picture.

345
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,230
Look what I found...

346
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:45,570
in something called "The Beachcomber."

347
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:54,040
That was you.

348
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:56,000
What?

349
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:59,870
You deliberately left
Leonardo in that hospital.

350
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:02,130
Is this true?

351
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:03,210
Of course not.

352
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:05,630
That could've been any woman
from Mexico City...

353
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:07,420
yachting off the Oregon coast.

354
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:09,090
Yeah, because there are so many.

355
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:11,090
You left him there!

356
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:14,010
- To rot!
- Please, Papi, you know I would never...

357
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:14,600
Quiet!

358
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,600
She's lost her mind!

359
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,520
You're sinister!

360
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:18,390
Quiet!

361
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:19,810
You're a lying goat!

362
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:31,110
Move away, Captain.

363
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:04,860
Don't turn around!

364
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:06,690
Open the door!

365
01:39:06,730 --> 01:39:08,110
Papi, please!

366
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:09,070
Let me in!

367
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:11,570
No! That woman brainwashed you!

368
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:12,720
That fool!

369
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:14,260
Take the helm!

370
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:43,290
If you do this...

371
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:44,040
it's over!

372
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,460
No turning back!

373
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:46,540
I don't care!

374
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:47,790
I love her!

375
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:52,010
I'll cut you off!

376
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:53,050
I swear!

377
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:54,970
So be it!

378
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:57,180
You'll be disinherited!

379
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:59,550
You won't have a penny to your name!

380
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:03,180
Not a penny?

381
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:04,560
Nothing!

382
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:06,310
You'll be a pauper!

383
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:07,850
Wait! Wait!

384
01:41:08,310 --> 01:41:10,270
Let's not overreact!

385
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,980
We can work something out!

386
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:14,490
What if I keep the Swiss accounts?

387
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:15,360
No!

388
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:26,410
And don't even think about
running Montenegro Industries!

389
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:30,000
Your sister will be in charge!

390
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:32,420
I'm humbled, Papi.

391
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:33,630
Not you.

392
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:34,840
I'm giving it to Sofia.

393
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,510
You left your brother for dead.

394
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:42,720
You're firing me?

395
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,970
You're kicking me out of the family?

396
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:46,640
Of course not.

397
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:50,690
We're putting you in charge
of our charitable division.

398
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:52,320
The smelly, poor kids?!

399
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:53,570
Yep.

400
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:56,240
You're so insensitive!

401
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,610
Son, listen carefully.

402
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,370
Honey, are you coming?

403
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:03,660
This is your last chance.

404
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:05,200
What if you give me...

405
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,500
a generous monthly stipend?

406
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:08,540
No!

407
01:42:19,370 --> 01:42:22,050
How about one lump sum,
held in trust--

408
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:23,050
No!

409
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,930
It's all or nothing!

410
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:27,730
That's your final offer?

411
01:42:27,770 --> 01:42:29,270
Final!

412
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:33,730
Okay.

413
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:28,240
Sir, do you want to adopt me?

414
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:37,840
A rich guy with amnesia,

415
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:39,920
a big-hearted poor girl,

416
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:42,380
a disapproving father, an evil sister...

417
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,430
Real life is better than a telenovela.

418
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:27,860
You may kiss the bride.

419
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:44,020
I'm very happy for Leonardo.

420
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:48,150
You are very happy for Leonardo.

421
01:46:48,190 --> 01:46:50,990
She is very happy for Leonardo.

422
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:32,700
The words of Vito Corleone.

423
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:36,870
A wise man. A man of intelligence.

424
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:40,370
Sure, he killed many people.

425
01:47:40,410 --> 01:47:43,750
But always for work...
never for pleasure.

426
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:59,720
When you stab
somebody for pleasure...

427
01:47:59,770 --> 01:48:02,310
you cut out his intestines and guts.

428
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:18,830
Leonardo.

429
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:20,790
You're still disinherited.

430
01:48:20,830 --> 01:48:23,500
But I'm still going to buy the yacht.

431
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:24,830
Not for you.

432
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:27,250
For my beautiful granddaughters.

433
01:48:27,290 --> 01:48:29,170
They deserve the world.

434
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:41,600
...you peel back the
skin and muscle.

435
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,230
You take out the guts...
the intestines...

436
01:48:44,270 --> 01:48:47,440
the pancreas... the kidneys and --

437
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:49,360
Anyway, congratulations to the
happy couple.

438
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:51,290
- Mwah!
- Cheers.

439
01:48:51,290 --> 01:48:52,930
Mmm.

440
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:53,960
Ah!

441
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:54,450
Whoo!

442
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:55,200
Vamos de fiesta!
