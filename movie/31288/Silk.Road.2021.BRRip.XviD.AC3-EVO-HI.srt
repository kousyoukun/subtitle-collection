Um...

159
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,020
Well, I'm almost a physicist.

160
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,755
I never quite got to...

161
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,924
- That's not what I mean.
- ...actual physics...

162
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,129
Honestly?

163
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,230
[woman] Always.

164
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,099
Okay.

165
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:05,039
I don't really wanna say.
To be honest, it sounds corny.

166
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,141
Try me.

167
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,877
Okay. Um...

168
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:15,616
Ever since I can remember,
I've always wanted to change the world.

169
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,219
How?

170
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,621
Um...

171
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,759
Are you familiar with Ludwig von Mises?
Austrian School of Economics?

172
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,128
Um, no.

173
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,262
Okay, most people aren't.

174
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,798
But his ideas are beautiful.

175
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:33,434
It's like poetry or math.

176
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,035
I'm wilting, Rossman.

177
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,237
Okay.

178
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,305
In a sentence,

179
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,841
every action that we take
outside of government control

180
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,810
strengthens the market
and weakens the state.

181
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,447
Seriously?
[chuckles]

182
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,048
Yes.

183
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:50,017
I just fucked
a libertarian?

184
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:53,888
Surprise.

185
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,239
Fucking Morales, eh?

186
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,042
<i>Mi hombre,</i> huh.
[chuckles] Come here.

187
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:19,046
[chuckles]

188
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:24,485
Fucked up out there, Johnny.
I know that.

189
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,821
Well, we kept you in too long.
You went native. That's on us.

190
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,456
No, man, I should've...

191
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,358
I'm a big boy, I can take it.

192
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:33,327
I should've fucking put
the hand up and said,

193
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,264
"Yo, man, over here. Not fucking...
not waving around."

194
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,903
- So I'll ride the bench a while.
- Rick...

195
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:45,105
Come on, man, I can work
Bocelli behind a desk, I can...

196
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:48,108
You wrapped your car around
a tree in Old San Juan, man.

197
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,177
I also took a narco predator
off the streets, too.

198
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,513
You might wanna mention that.

199
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,147
What about
when I listen to the wire,

200
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,015
and then I find out
that the whole thing,

201
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:58,252
it jumped off because you
told Gomez he was retarded?

202
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,389
I mean, what the fuck,
you know? [chuckling]

203
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,124
You want me to fucking say, man?
You listen...

204
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:07,228
Rick, maybe I'm not
making myself clear.

205
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:08,862
No, man,
maybe I'm not makin' myself clear.

206
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:09,964
- Rick...
- I ride the bench for a while.

207
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,398
You tell me how long...

208
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,535
You were coked
out of your fucking mind,

209
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:16,237
endangering the lives
of civilians.

210
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,038
You're never
working the streets again.

211
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,273
What the fuck
does that mean?

212
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,474
What do you think
it means?

213
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:26,780
It's what I do, Johnny.
It's who I am, man, I mean, come on.

214
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:30,451
Fucking look at me,
I'm a fucking door kicker, man.

215
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:33,320
Read it. Read this shit.

216
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:37,559
Fuck sakes, man. The brass,
they wanted you out on your ass.

217
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:39,893
No pension. No nothing.

218
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:47,167
You're being reassigned, man.
Cybercrimes.

219
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:50,037
See GS Shields on Monday.
He'll get you squared away.

220
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:08,389
Mm.

221
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:10,858
It was really good.
[chuckles]

222
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,996
So how's the book business?

223
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,232
Sold the bus.

224
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:21,402
Well, that seems
a bit drastic, love.

225
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:25,105
No, Mom... Good Wagon
just was not the thing.

226
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,042
Really wasn't.

227
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:32,514
[chuckles, sniffles]

228
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,587
[man]
Give her a shot.

229
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,561
Come on.
Let's see if you still got it.

230
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,563
I'm not a trained monkey, Dad.

231
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:52,166
When Ross was nine,
he was consumed with the idea

232
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,301
of making the Guinness
Book of World Records.

233
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,371
- What was it, eight seconds?
- 6.8.

234
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:00,140
[Dad] We trained every day
for three months.

235
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:06,980
And then the night before,
Ross abruptly decides it wasn't the thing.

236
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:11,285
PhD, a video game start-up,
now Good Wagon.

237
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,120
Tell me when you see a pattern.

238
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,188
Let's go.

239
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,993
It was really good.

240
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,896
[Mom] Thanks, honey.
Yeah, it was nice to meet you.

241
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,173
Are you okay?

242
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,043
Yeah.

243
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,178
You sure?

244
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,348
Yes, yes. I'm fine.

245
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,250
Look, just because
your dad's a dick

246
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,085
doesn't mean that you
won't change the world.

247
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:48,422
I believe in you,
Rossman.

248
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,702
[chattering]

249
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,704
[Rick] Hey.

250
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:39,607
I'm after Supervisor Shields.

251
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:40,974
Yeah, I'm Shields.

252
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,347
Rick Bowden.
Johnny Morales sent me.

253
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,416
It's an honor to meet you, Bowden.
We're glad to have you.

254
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,285
- It's good to be here.
- Yeah.

255
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,287
Yeah, sorry, I'm late.
I hit the range, little tune up.

256
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,455
I gotta re-qualify.

257
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:55,557
[whispering] Can I ask you

258
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,624
a personal question, Rick?

259
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:58,425
Yeah.

260
00:15:58,459 --> 00:15:59,993
Is it true

261
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,395
what happened in,
uh, Puerto Rico?

262
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,996
What part?

263
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,666
Eighteen-month op went sideways

264
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:07,401
when you told the cartel boss
he was a Mongoloid?

265
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,173
So we got an open floor plan.
Foster inter-squad exchange.

266
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,008
But Johnny said
you were old school.

267
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,611
Thought you might prefer
some privacy.

268
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:20,481
So we got you in here.
This little number.

269
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:29,223
We got a series 9, 16 gigs of RAM.
Intel processor. She's a rocket.

270
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:30,324
RAM up, huh?

271
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:36,531
Yeah. RAM up. Well,
welcome to Cybercrimes, Bowden.

272
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,540
[whispering] You can do this.

273
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:49,711
[Max] Okay, real talk.
Good Wagon was never gonna work.

274
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:52,346
Brick and mortar is dead.
We live in a convenience culture.

275
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,381
Everyone wants everything
shipped to their door.

276
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,383
And Bezos
already beat you to it.

277
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,653
Now,
today's moneymaker is social

278
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,755
because everyone wants to know
what everyone else is up to.

279
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:03,825
- Like I said it would.
- No. Bullshit. That is bullshit.

280
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:06,561
People want anonymity.
Now more than ever.

281
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:10,497
The Internet was spawned off of the
things that people try and keep secret.

282
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:14,201
Think about it.
Porn, gambling, drugs.

283
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:17,839
Okay, but you can't buy drugs
on the Internet, Ross.

284
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:20,440
Hmm.
I've been thinking about this.

285
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:23,110
What if you could?

286
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,278
[snickers]

287
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,346
Uh, what are you saying?

288
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,751
Think about it.
Amazon for drugs.

289
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,419
[Julia] You despise Amazon.

290
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,388
But I love freedom.

291
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,423
Yeah, well, whoever does this,

292
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,492
they're an idiot, first off,

293
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:41,295
and second off, they'd be busted
in, like, two seconds.

294
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,797
Not if
every transaction's encrypted.

295
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:46,266
What do you know about Tor?

296
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,669
- What, the Onion Router?
- Nothing.

297
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,672
Uh, it was designed by the
spooks at DARPA and the Navy.

298
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:53,841
It's a network that directs web
traffic through a series of relays.

299
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,142
[Julia] What for?

300
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,745
Concealing location and usage.

301
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,847
Essentially,
it's a digital invisibility cloak.

302
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:02,650
It's perfect for doing
business on the Dark Web.

303
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:06,588
Okay, but if they follow the
money, then you're fucked, right?

304
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,322
Bitcoin.

305
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,490
- Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin?

306
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,292
Bitcoin.

307
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:14,194
Bitcoin?

308
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:17,665
It's like tokens in an arcade.

309
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:19,667
You go into the arcade,
you buy the tokens,

310
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:22,202
but nobody knows
which tokens you used.

311
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,338
- Okay, it's a little...
- [Ross] It's completely anonymous transactions.

312
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:28,175
- Think about it.
- It's a little basic explanation, uh, but...

313
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,242
I like tokens.

314
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:31,779
And I like drugs.

315
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:33,915
[man on video] <i>Okay,

It's a book.

No. You're missing it.

Look, I am using the Internet

but dudes are buying and selling
narcotics on the computers.

promoted and put into cybercrimes, so...

how to buy dope on YouTube.

[chattering]

468
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,904
Whoa, holy shit, man.
What the fuck?

469
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:47,074
This is some kind of, like,
ghetto Batcave, huh?

470
00:26:47,108 --> 00:26:51,045
Yeah. Told you.
This sneaker-head shit is a moneymaker.

471
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:53,114
- Yeah?
- You got a computer and a connection,

472
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:54,915
- you can sell anything.
- Really?

473
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:57,051
Don't touch
any of my shit, though.

474
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:58,652
All right, man. Christ.

475
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:00,788
All right, check this out.

476
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:02,690
[sighs]

477
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:11,665
eBay for dope fiends.
They even got reviews and shit.

478
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:13,868
Oh, shit.

479
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:18,005
- [Rayford chuckles]
- So what do you do? You just...

480
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,741
You buy it on here
and then what?

481
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:22,076
[Rayford] What do you mean,
"and then what?"

482
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:25,112
What, it just arrives
at your fucking door?

483
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:28,382
Yeah, yo. People been fucking with
the Dark Web for a minute now.

484
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:30,217
Light shit,
you know what I'm saying?

485
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:32,720
Niggas was using PayPal,
Western Union, dumb shit.

486
00:27:32,753 --> 00:27:34,221
But you cyber pigs
was on to that.

487
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:37,291
The genius of this,
they using Bitcoin.

488
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,893
Fucking genius shit.

489
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:42,062
What's Bitcoin?

490
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:44,131
It's crypto currency, yo.

491
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:45,900
- Okay.
- It's the future of money.

492
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,334
I'm sayin', a few niggas
know about it now,

493
00:27:47,368 --> 00:27:49,203
but once people get hip
to this shit,

494
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:51,105
it's gonna be in every suburb
in America.

495
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:54,942
The fuck do you know
all this shit, man?

496
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:56,844
Baltimore Public Library.

497
00:27:57,478 --> 00:27:59,847
[laughs] Fuck.

498
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,116
Fuck is so funny, yo?
You wanna buy some drugs or not?

499
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:03,484
I do wanna buy some drugs,
so...

500
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:05,452
Don't touch my shit, all right?

501
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:06,854
Don't touch my shit.

502
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:09,023
Come on, dude,
lighten up, so...

503
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:10,891
Uh-huh.
What you want?

504
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:12,493
[Rick] I don't know.
I think we should start with...

505
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:15,362
[Rayford] Anything you want.
You want some mushrooms?

506
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:18,299
You look like
someone who does mushrooms.

507
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,335
[chattering]

508
00:28:24,205 --> 00:28:26,073
[sighs]

509
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:28,876
You know, you are a walking
cliché, Bow-den.

510
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:31,178
White man buying dope
from a nigga in the hood.

511
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,881
Yeah, well,
that's Bowden, motherfucker.

512
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:35,849
Bowden, Bow-den,
same shit, man.

513
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,151
- Bowden.
- All right.

514
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:39,453
Yo, let me ask you a question.

515
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:41,956
- Shoot.
- Who out there slinging right now?

516
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:45,092
[Rick] Some jumpy-ass
rabbit motherfucker

517
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:47,361
with the cornrows
and the buck teeth there.

518
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:50,731
- Look at him. [chuckles]
- Yeah. You racist as shit.

519
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:53,067
Yeah, but am I fucking wrong?

520
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,969
Nah, today you right as rain.

521
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:58,973
But tomorrow,
look over there, see that?

522
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:00,174
See that nigga right there?

523
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,877
- [Rick] Hmm.
- Game is changing, feel me?

524
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:05,879
Do you have my shit?

525
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:07,948
Yeah.

526
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:11,986
- Bam.
- No shit.

527
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:13,487
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

528
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,991
Welcome to the future, baby.

529
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,995
Let me see your phone.

530
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:23,931
- Your phone.
- Fuck you want with my phone?

531
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,099
Let me see your phone.

532
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:26,967
There, have at it.

533
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:30,938
All right. Let me see your ID.

534
00:29:31,606 --> 00:29:34,509
- Why?
- Let me see your ID. Shit.

535
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,212
Old-ass wallet.

536
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:39,880
[Rick]
What are you doing?

537
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:41,482
[Rayford]
Can you just relax for a second?

538
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:44,552
All right.

539
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,056
Congratulations, you now own
a Bitcoin wallet.

540
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:52,192
Next time you want some dope,
have Uncle Sam send it, all right?

541
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,530
Now that's your solid,
don't call me no fucking more.

542
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:58,332
[muttering]
Get your own fucking...

543
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:17,519
No, I mean, we're talking
about a multi-jurisdiction.

544
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:20,522
- The situation that, um...
- [Rick] Shields, you need to see this.

545
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:22,022
- But what I'm saying is that, if...
- [Rick] Boss.

546
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:23,223
Hold on, one moment.

547
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:26,293
No, not now, Rick, stop.
Go on.

548
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:30,230
Yeah, right, in a normal situation
there's, uh, you know,

549
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:33,500
for every man in the forces,
there's a manager.

550
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:36,203
So what I'm saying here is that
we take the...

551
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:38,506
I mean, we could, yeah,
but, it...

552
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:43,444
[Ross] <i>I've decided to keep a journal
about my experience running the site.</i>

553
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:47,047
<i>I imagine that someday I may have
a story written about my life</i>

554
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:50,017
<i>and it would be a good idea to
keep a detailed account of it.</i>

555
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:53,987
<i>I'm creating
a year of prosperity and power</i>

556
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,890
<i>beyond what I have
ever experienced before.</i>

557
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:01,462
<i>Silk Road
is going to become a phenomenon.</i>

558
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:03,631
<i>And at least one person
will tell me about it</i>

559
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:06,033
<i>unknowing
that I was its creator.</i>

560
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,478
[Max] Oh, shit.
These beers fair game? Ross?

561
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:21,248
Earth to Ross. Hello,
Mr. Rossington. Okay.

562
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:23,016
That's a yes.

563
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:25,252
[Ross]
Yo, check this out.

564
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:29,123
[Max] Great name, nice camel.

565
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:30,290
Keep reading.

566
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:34,596
Okay, Indicas,
Sour Diesel 13 and Grape Ape.

567
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:38,132
Acid,
microdot or blotter.

568
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:42,035
MDMA, ecstasy,
basically the same thing and 'shrooms.

569
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:44,938
Yeah, dude,
you're, uh, so getting busted.

570
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:47,642
Nope.
Bitcoin plus Tor. Untraceable.

571
00:31:47,675 --> 00:31:49,977
You're insane.
Can you please tell him he's insane?

572
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,345
You're insane.

573
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:53,347
Also, uh,
just a thought, friend.

574
00:31:53,815 --> 00:31:57,519
How's anyone supposed to find this?
You can't advertise it, Ross.

575
00:31:57,552 --> 00:32:00,120
I've been posing as a user
and touting it on the forums.

576
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:03,056
The forums?

577
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,025
- What? The chat rooms...
- [laughs]

578
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:07,194
You're too good for chat rooms,
too good for forums?

579
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:09,664
No, man, chat rooms are,
uh, cute, they're nice.

580
00:32:09,697 --> 00:32:14,234
But you're gonna want more exposure
than, you know, some 4chan fuck-heads.

581
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:16,638
Oh, you should call
my friend over at Gawker.

582
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:19,072
You have a friend at Gawker?

583
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:21,609
Yeah, I met him
at South By last year.

584
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:23,010
Don't ask.

585
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:24,612
Lot of questions there, but...

586
00:32:24,646 --> 00:32:26,146
[Max] Okay, well,
he's not just gonna

587
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,749
pick up an anonymous call

588
00:32:27,782 --> 00:32:30,484
at like, what,
10 o'clock at night?

589
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:34,087
Uh, that's exactly what he's gonna
do, he's a reporter. It's a story.

590
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:38,225
Don't do it.
Ross, I'm begging you, don't do it.

591
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:40,327
Ross, don't do it.

592
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,564
Yeah. Give me his number.

593
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:44,331
- [Max] No.
- [Ross] Yeah.

594
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,401
*67.

595
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:48,570
- Of course.
- This is fucking dumb.

596
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:50,170
I wasn't born yesterday.

597
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:52,105
You're literally
going straight to...

598
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,541
It's your idea, bro.

599
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:58,680
[phone ringing]

600
00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:03,317
Gawker.

601
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,520
- [Ross] <i>Adrian? Uh...</i>
- Who's this?

602
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:10,290
- <i>You don't know me, but I have your next story.</i>
- Thirty seconds.

603
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:14,261
Making small talk with your pot dealer
sucks. Buying cocaine can get you shot.

604
00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:17,231
But what if you could buy drugs
online like socks or light bulbs?

605
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:20,367
<i>Now you can with an online
website called Silk Road.</i>

606
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,169
[Max]
<i>Did you coach him on this?</i>

607
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:23,538
Who am I talking with?

608
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:26,273
<i>Call me Mark.</i>

609
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:29,042
- <i>No last name, but you can quote me.</i>
- [Julia laughing]

610
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:32,780
- And you created it?
- <i>No, but I ordered ten hits of acid</i>

611
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:36,518
<i>delivered to my doorstep
by the US Postal Service.</i>

612
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:38,318
And what did that feel like?

613
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:40,788
Well, to tell you the truth,
Adrian...

614
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:44,592
it kind of felt like the future.

615
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:47,494
[Max, Julia laughing]

616
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:51,365
Last question.
Anything you can't get on Silk Road?

617
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:53,367
<i>Nothing to harm or defraud.</i>

618
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,104
Like kiddie porn
or stolen credit cards.

619
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:59,139
<i>So no weapons-grade plutonium?</i>

620
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:00,374
Or murder for hire.

621
00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:02,577
<i>Is there anything
you'd like to add?</i>

622
00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:05,479
Yes.

623
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,584
Stop funding the state
with your tax dollars

624
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:13,253
and direct your productive
energies towards the black markets.

625
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:16,156
- Fuck you.
- Whoo!

626
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:19,259
- Holy shit. [chuckles]
- That felt good, man.

627
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:21,395
- You know what that felt like?
- [Ross, Julia] No.

628
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:23,330
- The future. You know.
- [laughs]

629
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:25,299
I just felt it right in my
bones, right there, the future.

630
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:27,167
[Ross] Go fuck yourself.
Don't be jealous.

631
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,570
[Max] It's right there,
it's right ahead of us.

632
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:37,110
[footsteps approaching]

633
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:42,249
Oh, hey, peanut! What are you doing here?
Huh? What are you doing here?

634
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:43,818
Hey.
We were in the neighborhood.

635
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,352
Thought we could stop by
and say hey.

636
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:47,722
- Is that right? This for me?
- Mm-hmm.

637
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:49,724
Figured you could
use the company.

638
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:51,793
Yeah, another Cobb salad
with those dipshits,

639
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:54,127
- I swear to God I'll eat a bullet.
- [Edie] Language, Daddy.

640
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:56,229
[Rick] Oh, "language, Daddy."
Is that right?

641
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:57,765
Nineteen years
you've been on this job,

642
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,333
this is the first time
I've been in your office.

643
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:00,702
Yeah, the last one

644
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:02,269
wasn't exactly
a daycare, was it?

645
00:35:02,302 --> 00:35:04,371
Neither was Max's Taphouse.

646
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:07,875
Tell you what,
why don't we get outta here, huh?

647
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:09,611
- Why don't we go somewhere special?
- Get some ice cream.

648
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:13,213
Ice cream for lunch?
No, no, no, no, no.

649
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:14,816
She's gonna have ice cream for
lunch, come on, let's go.

650
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:16,383
I'm having ice cream
for lunch?

651
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:17,518
Yeah, you are,
only if you behave.

652
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:18,686
Yeah, we'll see about that.

653
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,354
You watch that mouth, girl.

654
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:21,556
Come on, let's go.

655
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,325
[chuckles] Look at that.
What do you think? Huh?

656
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,261
Edie, look, they got nurse sharks.
Go check 'em out.

657
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:30,364
Oh, my God. Go on, honey.

658
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:32,700
[Sandy]
I think they're sleeping.

659
00:35:34,535 --> 00:35:35,637
You checking up on me?

660
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:39,641
Yeah, I am.
You okay with that?

661
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:44,344
Oh, my gosh.
Babe, look. Check it out.

662
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:45,947
[Rick] Did you go to the school?

663
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,784
I did. Forest Hills,
babe, it's amazing.

664
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:52,520
Classes are all small,

665
00:35:52,553 --> 00:35:54,287
and the teachers
all specialize

666
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,923
in overcoming
learning challenges.

667
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:59,259
- Okay.
- It's... it's great.

668
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:01,562
Hey, baby, honey,
don't tap on the glass.

669
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:04,364
[Sandy] She saw a little boy
her age who had built a robot.

670
00:36:04,398 --> 00:36:06,534
A walking, talking robot.
It was...

671
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:07,602
How much?

672
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,370
Did they say?
Did you talk about it?

673
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:11,606
- [clears throat] Yeah.
- How much?

674
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:13,407
Forty.

675
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:15,375
Fuck.

676
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:20,213
[Sandy] I told them you were in law
enforcement and that I am a nurse,

677
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:22,717
and they have scholarships
and she's eligible for those.

678
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,484
So we're gonna go for it.

679
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,453
- [Rick] They said that?
- Yeah.

680
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:27,755
- Really?
- Yeah.

681
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:31,592
Hey, come on, look at her.
Look at that little...

682
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:34,796
I mean, how do they not give
her a full scholarship, huh?

683
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:36,597
[Sandy] Mm. [chuckles]

684
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:38,231
- Huh?
- Yeah.

685
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:40,200
And you think
this is the way to go, huh?

686
00:36:40,768 --> 00:36:41,836
This is good for her.

687
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:45,606
I need you
to get on board, okay?

688
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,243
You with us?

689
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:53,881
When am I not with you, huh?

690
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,416
Hmm?

691
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:09,797
[Julia]
It'll never go in. Yeah!

692
00:37:09,831 --> 00:37:11,999
You suck.
Doesn't he suck? He sucks.

693
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,433
No, you're jealous.

694
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:14,569
- [Max] Constantly.
- [phone chimes]

695
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,505
Well, your phone is blowing up.

696
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:19,507
Are you sure you don't
want to check you phone?

697
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,008
- Don't you want to check your phone?
- Don't sabotage.

698
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:22,577
- I know you do.
- Don't sabotage.

699
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,878
Wait, now, seriously, dude,

700
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:26,346
you have like
50 unread messages.

701
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:28,983
[phone chimes]

702
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,417
What the hell?

703
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:32,754
This says a 101.

704
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:34,756
You get hacked or something?

705
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:35,790
[phone chimes]

706
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,258
Three hundred
and thirteen new messages.

707
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:41,529
- From who?
- I don't know. I...

708
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:44,464
I had everything from Silk Road
forwarded to my Gmail.

709
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:45,633
[laughing] Holy shit.

710
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:50,337
The Gawker article posted.
He wrote what you said, word for word.

711
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:53,941
- [laughing] Holy shit.
- [phone chimes]

712
00:37:55,009 --> 00:37:56,844
1,154.

713
00:37:56,878 --> 00:37:58,846
That's gonna
crash your site, man.

714
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:03,017
Shit, you're right.

715
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:06,988
Okay, we gotta go.
Finish your beer.

716
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:09,090
No, actually, fuck your beer.
We gotta go.

717
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:10,958
- No, we got a full fucking pitcher, Ross.
- No, we got to go.

718
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:13,360
- We can't just...
- Hold on, I got this.

719
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:17,965
Grab your shit. Just leave...
leave the chip. Come on.

720
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:24,404
[Max]
Bounced the local hosting?

721
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:26,941
[Ross] Outsourced it
to a data center in Iceland.

722
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,510
Get fucked, NSA.

723
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:31,746
NSA?

724
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:36,517
I just made 75 grand in Bitcoin
in the last 90 minutes, babe.

725
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,554
Sooner or later
someone's gonna come knocking.

726
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:47,562
But now,
they can't trace my IP address.

727
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:51,999
Ross,
that's $833 a minute.

728
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:55,002
Go the other way.

729
00:38:56,804 --> 00:38:58,039
[both laugh]

730
00:38:58,072 --> 00:39:02,577
Holy shit,
1.2 million a day.

731
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,380
[laughs]

732
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,020
- [both laughing]
- Fuck you.

733
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:21,863
[man 1] <i>Neighbors, there is something
interesting going on right now.</i>

734
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:25,666
<i>What if I were to tell you
that there is a drug super store</i>

735
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,001
<i>on the Internet right now?</i>

736
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:31,672
[Ross]
<i>To all the new faces, welcome.</i>

737
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:35,142
<i>Our basic rules are to treat
others as you wish to be treated,</i>

738
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:39,479
<i>and don't do anything

739
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:40,781
<i>Something special
came in the mail.</i>

740
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:46,419
It looks and feels
exactly like eBay, Amazon,

741
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:49,557
whatever other online purchasing
site you're familiar with.

742
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:54,629
[Ross] <i>Silk Road is already making
an impact on the war on drugs</i>

743
00:39:54,662 --> 00:39:58,833
<i>by expanding people's access
to controlled substances.</i>

744
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:03,037
<i>Every transaction

745
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,140
<i>outside the nexus of state
control is a victory.</i>

746
00:40:06,173 --> 00:40:09,877
<i>So there are literally hundreds
of victories here each week,</i>

747
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:12,847
<i>and each one weakens the state.</i>

paranoid about using the mail?</i>

753
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:31,098
No. They, like, vacuum seal it
so the dogs can't even smell it.

754
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:33,901
Like, seriously,
they've thought of everything.

755
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:36,771
- [woman 1] Whoa.
- [woman 2] Yeah. Game changer.

756
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:40,975
- [woman 1] Who runs it?
- [woman 2] I don't know, but the guy's pretty genius.

757
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:46,047
Genius.

758
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,015
Don't get ahead of yourself.

759
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:51,185
Their words.

760
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,691
[man] Anybody else
from your outfit coming today?

761
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:58,559
Nope, they save
all the good stuff for me.

762
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:05,533
Okay. US Postal Service interdicts
narcotics by two primary means.

763
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:09,103
One is drug dogs, effective for large
shipments of controlled substances,

764
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:10,972
typically a kilo or more.

765
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:13,541
The other is random X-rays.

766
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:15,176
This is your
ounce or less crew.

767
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:17,111
This latter category,

768
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:19,647
we've noticed a 300% increase
in the past three months.

769
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,717
Lot of little stuff adds
up to the big stuff, right?

770
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,720
- Theoretically.
- So what do you think's driving the spike?

771
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:27,088
I don't know,
it's all small-time,

772
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:28,556
so they haven't given us
the resources

773
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:29,991
to figure it out yet.

774
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:31,726
Well, do they have
anything in common?

775
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:33,894
Actually, yes.

776
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:37,298
Everything they've seized out
of Utah has that stamped on it.

777
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:38,566
[Rick] No shit.

[doorbell rings]

Yo, Rayford, man, come on.
It's Bowden. Open the fuck up.

783
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:30,251
[Rayford] Motherfucker.

Oh, fuck.

[Rayford] Fuck.

790
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:47,968
[Rick] You open
this motherfucking door,

791
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:50,104
- you motherfucking piece of fuck!
- [banging on door continues]

792
00:42:53,374 --> 00:42:55,876
Fucking game, dude, huh?
You think this is fucking funny?

793
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,245
Come on,
why don't you ease it?

794
00:42:58,279 --> 00:43:01,382
Goddamn! Fuck, dude,
it smells dank in here.

795
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:03,784
You know, I'm gonna have you
note that that came anonymous...

796
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:05,953
Oh, what, you cooking up a
chicken with this oregano? Hmm.

797
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:08,956
No, that's from a customer.
I didn't pay for that. That's...

798
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:12,226
Yeah, I don't give a fuck
about your fucking chicken.

799
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:13,360
[coughs]

800
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:17,598
What else can you tell me about
this cat that sold you the 'shrooms?

801
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:20,835
Uh, goes by the name
of Chronic Pain.

802
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:22,036
Yeah, and what else?
Come on.

803
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,872
- That's it.
- Come on, dude, help me out.

804
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:27,875
I got an envelope postmarked Utah.
I got no return address.

805
00:43:27,908 --> 00:43:29,376
Utah's a big-ass state.

806
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:33,080
What else can you tell me about him?
Something? Chronic Pain?

807
00:43:33,114 --> 00:43:36,050
Well, hold on.
What makes you think it's a him?

808
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:40,654
You ever seen this movie called
<i>Cocaine Cowboys?</i> It was a documentary.

809
00:43:40,688 --> 00:43:44,058
And the baddest motherfucker in that
was a bitch named the Black Widow.

810
00:43:44,492 --> 00:43:46,894
She was drilling holes
in motherfuckers...

811
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:49,263
What the fuck has this got to do
with what I'm asking you about?

812
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:52,199
I'm just saying. A nigga can be
whoever they want on the Internet.

813
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:56,003
Whoever they want.

814
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:07,448
- [ferret chittering]
- [man] You know what people do with cats?

815
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:09,950
They just let them
live in their fucking house.

816
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:12,786
They don't even
actually interact, like, ever.

817
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,091
They're like, "Oh, look at all my cats.
I keep them alive."

818
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:20,861
You and I, we, like,
actually hang out.

819
00:44:20,895 --> 00:44:22,396
[chittering continues]

820
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:28,435
Imagine a baby,
but it's tall, it's cute.

821
00:44:29,504 --> 00:44:33,340
But it's intimidating,
it is the size of a basketball hoop

822
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:36,243
and it's asking for its pacifier.
[laughing]

823
00:44:36,277 --> 00:44:38,145
[machine whirring]

824
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:40,147
And it could crush you,

825
00:44:40,181 --> 00:44:42,249
but it's asking
for a cracker or something.

826
00:44:44,218 --> 00:44:46,787
You're the man now, dawg.

827
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:53,227
[chuckling] What was the movie where
James Bond was the guy with the blind kid?

828
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,862
That was a good movie.

829
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:09,877
[Julia]
Why don't you come to bed?

830
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,011
Listen to this.

831
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:15,282
"Fish scale Colombian cocaine."

832
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:20,454
"Has a nice sheen and provides a rush
of euphoria and confidence." [chuckles]

833
00:45:21,822 --> 00:45:22,890
Now this one.

834
00:45:23,658 --> 00:45:28,996
"Crystal MDMA.
Has a lovely fizz and a wisp of smoke."

835
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:32,166
You've got issues.

836
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:34,134
I think I just solved them.

837
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:37,838
This guy is a one-man fan club.

838
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:41,141
That's not what I meant.
You're getting obsessive.

839
00:45:41,175 --> 00:45:42,943
I think you mean obsessed.

840
00:45:42,977 --> 00:45:44,011
You know what I meant.

841
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,214
I'll be in bed.

842
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:53,454
[song playing on video]

843
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:57,458
Oh, that's not where we're
going with our teeth, baby.

844
00:45:57,891 --> 00:46:01,061
- [ferret chittering]
- We're not going down there, going up here.

845
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,231
Oh, hold up.

846
00:46:04,265 --> 00:46:06,200
"Your work
has not gone unnoticed.

847

Wanna offer you a job."

848
00:46:07,901 --> 00:46:09,103
What?

849
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:13,207
Uh, okay.

850
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:17,278
What do I have to do?

851
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:19,446
What? You gotta get up.

852
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,249
This is getting interesting.
You're gonna miss this, come here.

Manage orders. Get rich."

"Get rich"?

00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:29,890
I'm in, brother.

856
00:46:32,092 --> 00:46:35,429
"Send scan of your ID"?

857
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:37,898
Yeah, what do you think of that?
What should we tell him?

858
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:41,068
To kiss our dimply ass?

859
00:46:42,102 --> 00:46:47,007
"Why do you need my ID
when I don't know who you are?"

Yes.
I'm just gonna roll the die

[scanner whirring]

You support this, right?
You wanna be an underboss, right?

867
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:18,272
You don't wanna be a fucking
ferret your whole life.

Asleep on the couch.

Oh.
She must be fucking drunk.

You wanna help me?

Take a picture of me?
Do that?

Well spotted, honey. How's that?

Thanks for helping.

Tonight our Call-6 investigators dig
into what's known as The Dark Net.

906

It's been called
eBay for illegal drugs.

907
00:50:09,777 --> 00:50:12,246
A network
of relatively hidden websites

908
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:15,315
where users can buy everything
from ecstasy to opium.

Someone that is wanting
to sell illegal drugs

914
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,268
can use this to come in contact with
someone that wants to buy illegal drugs.

What do you think?

Oh, my God, Ross,
this is really serious.

00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:20,480
Putting together
an inter-agency task force

928
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:22,884
- on some online dope bazaar.
- What, Silk Road?

929
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:25,152
- Yeah.
- No, we're already on it. Who's running point?

930
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:27,487
A guy called Tarbell.
Sounds like a real gunner.

931
00:51:27,522 --> 00:51:30,725
He's just looking for a token narc
to qualify for OCDETF funding.

932
00:51:30,758 --> 00:51:32,259
You got somebody we can spare?

No fucking way,
I got my A-Team on this.

934
00:51:34,328 --> 00:51:36,496
FBI'll just steal our work
claiming credit.

00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:39,366
Shields, I can't say no to an
inter-departmental request, okay?

936
00:51:39,399 --> 00:51:41,603
Look, personally,
I don't give a fuck who you send,

937

and a heartbeat.

What the fuck, it's a website.

They sell dope and shit
on the net.

948
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,236
Perfect. The FBI's putting
together a task force.

949
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:18,438
There's a briefing at the
Federal Building at 1100.

950
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:20,842
Report to Agent Tarbell.
You'll love him.

951
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:23,377
- Okay. Hey, Shields?
- Yep?

00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,747
Is there any way to track
dope busts in the mail?

953

You know, small shit,
ounce or less.

954
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:30,618
Yeah, I'll have Sirkis
set up a geofence.

955
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:33,554
They'll notify you whenever the local
postal interdiction police gets a pop.

956
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:36,156
- Geofence? Good.
- Yeah.

957
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:38,258
Why?

958
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:41,261
No reason, you know,
I might have an idea

959
00:52:41,294 --> 00:52:43,430
to crack
this Silk Road shit wide open.

960
00:52:43,463 --> 00:52:45,232
- Rick?
- Yeah.

961
00:52:45,265 --> 00:52:47,300
I've got a next-level team
on this, okay?

And I don't need some old-school

Tor's the king of high-security,
low-latency Internet anonymity.

967
00:53:07,722 --> 00:53:09,824
You're aware, boss,
that given the volume of users,

968
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:12,827
the odds of finding a single IP
address are almost impossible?

you'd say that, Kim.

Worth five American cents.

He got hit by lightning...

No.

He had that nickel
in his pocket, though.

987
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:06,279
The electrical current burned
a hole in his dungarees,

seared through
his testicular wall

00:54:07,882 --> 00:54:09,784
and cauterized
his vas deferens.

Did you...
did you need something there?

No. I just, uh, wondered if
we're working any human sources?

You can just crack it the

Maybe.

01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:26,287
All these other young bucks, they think
I'm some kind of old fucking dinosaur.

1083
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,022
They're doing
their digital downloads.

1084
01:01:28,055 --> 01:01:29,924
But I'm the one
with these fucking hooks in.

1085
01:01:29,957 --> 01:01:32,426
I'm the one who's gonna bring
this fucking prick down.

1086
01:01:33,427 --> 01:01:36,797
This is exactly how you
sounded before Puerto Rico.

1087
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:39,300
No, it's not how it was like
in Puerto Rico.

1088
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:41,202
- It's different?
- Yeah, completely different.

1089
01:01:41,235 --> 01:01:42,269
- Is it?
- Yeah.

1090
01:01:42,303 --> 01:01:43,337
Is it, Rick? Really?

1091
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:44,838
What's going on in Utah?

1092
01:01:45,906 --> 01:01:48,042
[laughing]
What the... What?

1093
01:01:48,075 --> 01:01:49,910
- What?
- Yeah. What?

1094
01:01:49,944 --> 01:01:52,012
I get the same high-purchase
alerts you do, okay?

1095
01:01:52,046 --> 01:01:54,982
Tell me what the fuck
is going on in Utah.

1096
01:01:57,451 --> 01:02:00,254
Cyber conference. Yeah.

1097
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:02,156
- It's a cyber conference? Okay.
- Yeah.

1098
01:02:02,189 --> 01:02:03,857
- And you're paying for it?
- No.

1099
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:05,059
They haven't
requisitioned the money yet.

1100
01:02:05,092 --> 01:02:06,193
They'll pay me back.

1101
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,198
You know, the thing
about being married to a narc

1102
01:02:11,232 --> 01:02:14,235
is that you never know
when they're lying to you.

1103
01:02:17,572 --> 01:02:18,973
[officer]
Let's go. Engage.

1104
01:02:25,879 --> 01:02:27,948
"Weird Al" Yankovic.

1105
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:29,483
[officer] Let's go.

1106
01:02:40,494 --> 01:02:42,129
[gunshot]

1107
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,803
- Get under there! Get the fucking...
- [overlapping shouting]

1108
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:52,172
- [officer 1] Hands where I can see them!
- [officer 2] Don't fucking move!

1109
01:02:52,206 --> 01:02:54,275
- Down now!
- Down on the fucking ground!

1110
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:58,312
- What? You fucking deaf? Huh? You what? Huh?
- I can help.

1111
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:00,347
- I can tell you anything you want to know.
- [Rick] Huh? Yeah?

1112
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:03,217
Thought he was gonna win
the fucking penalty shoot, yeah?

1113
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,252
Well, no, you don't fucking know.
What do you got here?

1114
01:03:05,286 --> 01:03:07,488
- What is this? Is this your fanny pack?
- Yeah.

1115
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:11,425
A fucking fanny pack?
Dude, your mother know about this? Huh?

1116
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:15,796
- [groans]
- Huh?

1117
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:17,565
Whoa!

1118
01:03:18,232 --> 01:03:20,367
- Yeah!
- It's... I... It's for my taxes.

1119
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:22,102
Fat, fucking roll, dude.

1120
01:03:22,136 --> 01:03:23,971
I don't like bank...
I don't trust banks.

1121
01:03:24,506 --> 01:03:26,440
Fucking hook this prick up
and voucher this.

1122
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:28,809
[groaning, panting]

1123
01:03:30,077 --> 01:03:32,846
Clean your fucking ears out.
What did I say?

1124
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,049
I said go take a sketch of the
premises and then report back to me.

1125
01:03:36,283 --> 01:03:37,418
You boys got a light?

1126
01:03:45,225 --> 01:03:47,194
Where the fuck do they find these guys?
I swear to God.

1127
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:49,363
Well, probably
a fucking vegetarian.

1128
01:03:54,201 --> 01:03:56,203
You know,
swear to fucking God, dude.

1129
01:03:57,672 --> 01:03:59,340
This whole job's changed.

1130
01:04:00,608 --> 01:04:03,645
Well, we certainly can't get
shit done the way we used to.

1131
01:04:03,678 --> 01:04:05,179
Fucking A.

1132
01:04:09,651 --> 01:04:11,218
Don't know about you,
but I don't have

1133
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:13,555
the fucking patience
for this bullshit.

1134
01:04:13,588 --> 01:04:16,223
Flung out the paperwork and that.
You know what I'm saying?

1135
01:04:17,257 --> 01:04:19,126
No. What are you saying?

1136
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:21,095
I'm saying I can take it
from here if you want.

1137
01:04:23,063 --> 01:04:24,231
Is it gonna
come back on me?

1138
01:04:25,466 --> 01:04:27,201
Do I look like a vegetarian?

1139
01:04:27,968 --> 01:04:29,002
[chuckles]

1140
01:05:02,537 --> 01:05:05,038
[Ross] Where the fuck
are you, Curtis?

1141
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,043
- Hey.
- Hey.

1142
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:12,680
- Have you eaten anything?
- [sighs] I'm fine.

1143
01:05:15,717 --> 01:05:17,552
- You know, I'm starting to get a little...
- Don't!

1144
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:20,588
I'm sorry.

1145
01:05:23,023 --> 01:05:24,559
I'm really sorry. I...

1146
01:05:25,426 --> 01:05:27,995
Look, I am running
a $50 million company,

1147
01:05:28,028 --> 01:05:29,731
operating in
17 different countries

1148
01:05:29,764 --> 01:05:31,398
with exactly one employee

1149
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:33,100
who just dropped off
the face of the Earth.

1150
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:35,469
It's just a website, Ross!

1151
01:05:40,207 --> 01:05:41,475
It's the thing.

1152
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:45,613
And you would know that,
except you've never done anything.

1153
01:05:52,152 --> 01:05:53,187
[scoffs]

1154
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:56,423
I'm gonna go for a run.

1155
01:05:56,957 --> 01:06:00,194
And when I come back,
I want you and all your shit out of here.

1156
01:06:00,227 --> 01:06:01,596
You hear me?

1157
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:15,042
[Curtis] <i>Please, sir,
this guy we're dealing with,</i>

1158
01:06:15,075 --> 01:06:20,314
he's got unlimited resources
and he's unpredictable...

1159
01:06:20,347 --> 01:06:22,717
I'm gonna break your fucking
nose, and I'm gonna do it.

1160
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,385
He's... I can tell you
whatever the fuck you...

1161
01:06:25,419 --> 01:06:28,088
I'll write a term paper,
for fuck's sake!

1162
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:29,657
- Money.
- The money.

1163
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:32,125
I know all about
how the money works.

1164
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:33,695
- So?
- Okay.

1165
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:36,196
There's Bitcoin.
Are you familiar with Bitcoin?

1166
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,799
Bitcoin?

1167
01:06:37,832 --> 01:06:40,300
- Don't be a fucking cunt, Curtis.
- Oh, fuck!

1168
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:43,203
Don't be a cunt, Curtis.
Don't be a fucking cunt, dude.

1169
01:06:43,237 --> 01:06:45,472
- Don't be a fucking cunt, okay?
- Okay, no cunt.

1170
01:06:45,507 --> 01:06:47,040
You fat fucking cunt!

1171
01:06:47,074 --> 01:06:48,442
Can't fucking...

1172
01:06:48,475 --> 01:06:51,178
So, you know Bitcoin.

1173
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:57,084
And there's some people use
Bitcoin to transfer money.

1174
01:06:57,117 --> 01:06:59,052
They make transactions.

1175
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:02,690
Those transactions on Silk Road
get put into an escrow account

1176
01:07:02,724 --> 01:07:06,661
and then stays there until
both parties have signed off.

1177
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:08,530
So nobody gets ripped off.

1178
01:07:08,563 --> 01:07:12,534
- That, and there's a ratings-based system.
- Yeah.

1179
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:17,371
The customer service and dependability,
reliability, it's all a big part of it.

1180
01:07:17,404 --> 01:07:20,307
Skip the corporate bullshit, okay?
You're no global conglomerate, so...

1181
01:07:22,276 --> 01:07:26,648
See, we are, though.
We are a global enterprise.

1182
01:07:27,749 --> 01:07:29,449
And it's growing.

1183
01:07:29,483 --> 01:07:31,619
Not growing by the week
or the month,

1184
01:07:31,653 --> 01:07:33,420
it's growing by the hour.

1185
01:07:33,453 --> 01:07:36,824
And at the crest of it
is fucking DPR and he's...

1186
01:07:36,858 --> 01:07:38,425
He's a visionary.

1187
01:07:40,595 --> 01:07:42,062
No shit.

1188
01:07:42,897 --> 01:07:44,532
And what are you?
An apostle?

1189
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:47,635
In pink fucking socks
and Crocs, dude?

1190
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:50,838
I'm the one... [laughs]

1191
01:07:50,872 --> 01:07:53,741
I may look like
a fucking idiot to you,

1192
01:07:53,775 --> 01:07:56,476
but I am the one who has access
to the escrow account.

1193
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:01,214
Fucking holding out on me,
dude.

1194
01:08:02,617 --> 01:08:04,384
- Okay.
- No, I'll tell you anything.

1195
01:08:04,418 --> 01:08:05,787
You're gonna prove it
is what you're gonna do.

1196
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,421
I'll prove anything.
How?

1197
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:11,491
Wire me the Bitcoin.

1198
01:08:13,595 --> 01:08:15,563
[laughs]

1199
01:08:15,597 --> 01:08:17,665
That's...
That's not how it...

1200
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:19,333
That is how it works,
but it's not how it works.

1201
01:08:19,366 --> 01:08:21,234
Well, what are you
gonna do with the...

1202
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:24,839
Gonna mark it Exhibit A in
the case against your boss.

1203
01:08:24,872 --> 01:08:26,340
Oh.

1204
01:08:26,874 --> 01:08:30,645
Okay. I appreciate what you're
doing, but this is...

1205
01:08:31,345 --> 01:08:35,482
It's like $200,000 or
something in the account.

1206
01:08:35,516 --> 01:08:37,417
He could kill me
for that type of money.

1207
01:08:40,588 --> 01:08:41,623
Really?

1208
01:08:44,324 --> 01:08:45,560
What?

1209
01:08:51,431 --> 01:08:52,600
[Ross] What the fuck?

1210
01:09:06,346 --> 01:09:08,916
What the fuck are you doing
with my money, Curtis?

1211
01:09:13,755 --> 01:09:16,223
Got you,
you son of a bitch.

1212
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:24,532
Hey, Max!
Your parents still in Aspen?

1213
01:09:24,565 --> 01:09:26,266
- Holy shit!
- Hey, man.

1214
01:09:26,299 --> 01:09:28,569
The prodigal son returns.

1215
01:09:28,603 --> 01:09:30,838
- Yeah. [chuckles]
- Yes, it has been a while.

1216
01:09:30,872 --> 01:09:33,240
Yup, it's been
six weeks, dude.

1217
01:09:34,942 --> 01:09:39,547
Hey, uh, look,
I got a favor to ask you.

1218
01:09:40,213 --> 01:09:43,450
If I give you someone's ID, can you
look up if they've been arrested or not?

1219
01:09:44,451 --> 01:09:47,755
Why do you always come to me
with this shit, Ross?

1220
01:09:48,488 --> 01:09:50,357
'Cause you're my best friend.

1221
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:57,699
What's their name?

1222
01:09:59,567 --> 01:10:01,903
Uh, Curtis Clark Green.

1223
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:04,972
Out of Spanish Fork, Utah.

1224
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:12,747
You, uh...
You having a party?

1225
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,248
If you'd read any of my texts
for the last six weeks,

1226
01:10:15,282 --> 01:10:17,952
you'd know
I'm moving to New York.

1227
01:10:17,985 --> 01:10:19,219
Surprise!

1228
01:10:24,491 --> 01:10:25,960
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1229
01:10:28,996 --> 01:10:30,363
[sighs]

1230
01:10:32,466 --> 01:10:34,401
[Max] Okay, that's weird.

1231
01:10:34,434 --> 01:10:37,839
There's a report for his arrest
in Spanish Fork, Utah,

1232
01:10:37,872 --> 01:10:40,942
but, for some reason,
he was never charged.

1233

Weird-looking dude.

Hey, Julia.

- Julia, look, just talk to me. Just talk!
- No!

1246
01:11:40,668 --> 01:11:43,538
You're selling assault rifles
on your fucking site, Ross.

1247

Yeah. Yeah, I am.
It's the Second Amendment.

1248
01:11:49,744 --> 01:11:53,380
When you said that you were
gonna change the world, I just...

1249
01:11:54,782 --> 01:11:56,651
I wanted to believe
that it was for the better.

1250

- Okay.

Julia, just listen.

- Leave me alone, Ross.
- Listen to me.

You heard her, asshole.

1254

Fuck off.

- Anything for you.
- Yeah.

Shit didn't even record.

1266
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,943
I did what you asked me to do.
I transferred the money!

1267
01:13:28,976 --> 01:13:30,912
Why the fuck
are you doing this?

1268
01:13:30,945 --> 01:13:34,115
Because, my friend,
if we pin some bullshit narcotics beef

1269
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:36,217
on your fucking pirate boss,

1270
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:39,687
he's gonna post bail, walk free
and wanna chase up loose ends.

1271
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:42,223
And we know who that is.
On the other hand,

1272
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:45,559
if we get him on a conspiracy
to commit murder and kidnapping,

1273
01:13:45,593 --> 01:13:47,528
- well, that's 25 years to life.
- [camera clicks]

- Nice, dude, here we go.

1275
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:53,734
- Why did you say murder? No!
- That's what I fucking said, dude. Here, come on.

1276

Get the fuck up.

Open up, dude, open up.

Here we go. You got it.
Keep it in.

01:15:45,246 --> 01:15:47,148
Okay, don't choke on that.

shit out of there, there you go.

1298

Curtis,
just give me a second here.

1299
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:58,159
All right.

1300
01:15:59,693 --> 01:16:01,896
Come on, Curtis,
hold your breath, dude. Fuck!

1301

- FBI cybercrimes has taken over the investigation.

1309
01:17:29,016 --> 01:17:31,385
Good. Hold the fucking phone.
I got the entire case right here.

1310
01:17:31,418 --> 01:17:33,220
Now, whatever it is,
turn it over to Tarbell.

1311
01:17:33,254 --> 01:17:35,022
No, hear me out.
You're gonna wanna see this.

1312
01:17:35,055 --> 01:17:36,290
- Trust me.
- No, I'm not. Not on the desk.

- Not the desk.
- Come on, here.

- Hang on.
- Rick!

1316

- It's just... Hang on.
- I don't have the time.

1317

This department
doesn't have the money, okay,

1318
01:17:45,232 --> 01:17:46,767
to teach you
how law enforcement works

in the 21st century.

1320

So take your handwritten notes,

01:17:49,436 --> 01:17:50,771
shove them in your Brownwell

1322

- Okay?
- Just... Come on.

Trust me. Look at this. Just...

1325
01:17:54,775 --> 01:17:55,809
I'll say it again.

For what?

1387
01:22:28,148 --> 01:22:30,652
To make it green,
motherfucker.

1388
01:22:30,685 --> 01:22:32,219
All right.

1389
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:38,992
You sure
about this shit, yo?

1390
01:22:39,026 --> 01:22:40,595
Just change it, okay?

[Tarbell] This guy's clearly self-taught.
Even though he fixed it,

1406
01:23:50,532 --> 01:23:53,601
we could read the previous version
underneath. Nice job, Kim. Okay.

1407
01:23:53,635 --> 01:23:55,402
Goddamn it. What, Bowden?

1408
01:23:55,435 --> 01:23:57,371
Uh, I was told
to give you this.

1409
01:23:57,404 --> 01:23:59,373
Just put it somewhere.

1410
01:23:59,406 --> 01:24:04,378
Ladies and gentlemen,
the IP address of the Silk Road server.

1411

[murmuring]

1412
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:09,483
- [man] Holy shit.
- [Tarbell] All right, get to work.

1413
01:24:09,517 --> 01:24:11,351
[chattering]

1414
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:12,854
[Tarbell] Kim,
do we have a physical address?

1415
01:24:12,887 --> 01:24:14,789
He's hosted on
a server farm in Iceland.

1416
01:24:14,822 --> 01:24:17,190
[Tarbell]
Okay, I'll call the AUSA.

1417
01:24:17,224 --> 01:24:19,493
And within 24 hours,
we'll be monitoring this guy in real time.

1418
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:23,598
- Hey, what if it is encrypted chats, too?
- Huh?

1419
01:24:23,631 --> 01:24:26,333
[Tarbell] No. But when we bust
him, we'll seize his laptop,

1420
01:24:26,366 --> 01:24:27,735
and then we'll get everything.

1421
01:24:27,769 --> 01:24:29,771
Everyone he ever dealt with.

1422
01:24:31,873 --> 01:24:35,075
...Iceland, you prosecute him right
here and I need to confirm now.

1423
01:24:36,243 --> 01:24:37,712
With a little luck,
we'll do it.

1424
01:24:42,349 --> 01:24:44,484
[phone ringing]

1425
01:24:54,328 --> 01:24:55,830
Hey. I need your help
with something.

1426
01:24:55,863 --> 01:24:57,397
You don't knock?

1427
01:24:57,999 --> 01:25:01,435
Look, it's no secret you and
I don't see eye to eye, okay?

1428
01:25:01,903 --> 01:25:05,740
- No.
- I know that you know that I think you're a...

1429
01:25:06,808 --> 01:25:07,875
Well, you're a dick.

1430
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:10,778
Yeah. [chuckles]

1431
01:25:10,812 --> 01:25:15,382
But Tarbell's a bigger dick,
and I hear he may have found DPR.

1432
01:25:15,415 --> 01:25:17,150
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1433
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,519
- He hasn't said anything to me.
- He wouldn't.

1434
01:25:18,553 --> 01:25:20,454
But I got a source
at the Bureau.

1435
01:25:20,487 --> 01:25:22,189
Says there's a kid
ordering fake passports

1436
01:25:22,222 --> 01:25:23,591
in San Francisco...

1437
01:25:24,424 --> 01:25:26,493
[whispers]
under the name Josh Terrey.

1438
01:25:28,563 --> 01:25:30,163
- Josh Terrey.
- Yeah.

1439
01:25:30,197 --> 01:25:32,366
- In San Francisco.
- Yeah.

1440
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:36,169
Homeland Security's got him
under 24-hour surveillance.

1441
01:25:37,605 --> 01:25:38,940
So, what do you want
from me?

1442
01:25:38,973 --> 01:25:40,642
You got anyone on the ground
out there

1443
01:25:40,675 --> 01:25:42,209
who might be able
to check it out for us?

1444
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,779
Get us in the game?

1445
01:25:44,812 --> 01:25:47,515
But you thought boots on the
ground was a waste of time.

1446
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:49,517
Call it an exception,
right?

1447
01:25:51,919 --> 01:25:53,721
Yeah.

1448
01:25:53,755 --> 01:25:57,324
Well, it's just too bad
that I am a dick.

1449
01:25:58,126 --> 01:26:01,696
Real shame.
Real fucking shame.

sitting on this prick.

my kid's PONY League playoffs.

1452
01:26:19,547 --> 01:26:21,749
Package is on his doorstep.
It's not like he doesn't know it's there.

1453
01:26:21,783 --> 01:26:22,950
Let's jam him.

1454
01:26:22,984 --> 01:26:24,484
Yes, ma'am.

01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:45,606
- Hey.
- Hey.

1458
01:26:46,974 --> 01:26:48,543
- I think you have the wrong address.
- Oh, no.

1459
01:26:49,777 --> 01:26:51,244
I'm Nob.

1460
01:26:52,947 --> 01:26:54,448
Yeah, step aside.

1461
01:26:55,717 --> 01:26:57,417
- How did you find me?
- Close the door.

1462
01:27:03,423 --> 01:27:05,660
- How'd you find me?
- How fucking old are you, dude?

1463
01:27:06,259 --> 01:27:07,762
- Twenty-seven.
- Yeah?

1464
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:10,230
- Yeah.
- You've been shaving long?

1465
01:27:10,865 --> 01:27:11,933
What?

1466
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,570
You have two federal agents in
an unmarked across the street.

1467
01:27:16,037 --> 01:27:18,539
- They're here to arrest you for...
- Wait. What hap...

1468
01:27:18,573 --> 01:27:23,578
Shh... ordering fake passports
off the Silk Road. Yeah.

1469
01:27:23,611 --> 01:27:27,481
When they knock on that door,
this is what you're gonna tell 'em.

Joshua Terrey?

1472
01:27:34,021 --> 01:27:35,656
- Yeah.
- Agent Conroy.

1473
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:37,859
Homeland Security.
This is Agent Ramirez.

1474
01:27:37,892 --> 01:27:38,926
This belong to you?

1475
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:41,896
[Conroy] Contains fake IDs
and passports.

1476
01:27:41,929 --> 01:27:43,664
Do you know anything about that?

1477
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:49,670
Can I see that for a second?

1478
01:27:50,838 --> 01:27:51,906
Yeah.

1479
01:27:52,707 --> 01:27:56,878
Shit. Well, it says right
there, "No signature required."

1480
01:27:56,911 --> 01:27:59,714
Meaning, I haven't
taken possession of it.

1481
01:28:00,347 --> 01:28:02,784
Which is why you knocked
instead of kicked.

1482
01:28:04,986 --> 01:28:10,825
Well, anybody could have ordered that,
you know, off the Silk Road, for instance.

1483
01:28:10,858 --> 01:28:12,527
[Ramirez] With your pictures?

1484
01:28:13,661 --> 01:28:18,800
It's a free country. Now, um...
[inhales sharply] if you'll excuse me...

1485
01:28:19,267 --> 01:28:22,837
Sorry I couldn't help you guys
out, but I got some work to do.

1486

01:28:39,654 --> 01:28:40,822
Now what?

1490
01:28:40,855 --> 01:28:41,889
Now...

1491
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:45,425
you delete
our fucking chat history.

1492
01:28:46,527 --> 01:28:47,562
Yeah.

1493
01:28:47,595 --> 01:28:48,696
- Like, now.
- Yeah.

1494
01:28:48,729 --> 01:28:50,497
- Do it.
- Yeah. Just...

1495
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:57,337
[Rick] You think
this is a fucking game?

1496
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:02,743
- All of it.
- Yeah. Just give me a second.

1497
01:29:02,777 --> 01:29:04,145
[Rick] You think I'm
going down 'cause of you?

1498
01:29:04,178 --> 01:29:05,746
I ain't going down
because of you.

1499
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,516
It's gone. It's done.

1500
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:10,450
Fucking better be.

1501
01:29:13,087 --> 01:29:16,791
Next time,
just don't be such a smart ass.

1502
01:29:20,728 --> 01:29:21,996
Yeah.

You rubbing it out?

The fuck is that?

01:30:47,648 --> 01:30:50,151
- [Rayford] It's 37K, yo.
- [Rick] Thirty-seven K?

1516
01:30:50,184 --> 01:30:52,753
Dude, I had fucking 200K
in my Bitcoin wallet.

1517
01:30:52,787 --> 01:30:55,488
Well, it's not my fault that Bitcoin
been going up and down and shit.

1518
01:30:55,523 --> 01:30:57,091
It's fucking volatile.

Won't even
fucking last me a year.

- Motherfucker. Unbelievable.
- Forty fucking grand?

I thought your kid was in
pre-school, yo. Shit.

1524
01:31:11,539 --> 01:31:14,942
I don't care. Gonna see how

- Any word from the Icelandic Embassy?

My guys are heading to Reykjavik in
an hour. When it goes, it goes fast.

until his servers are mirrored?</i>

Twelve hours from when they
hit the Thor Data Center.

And it's what,
seven, eight hours' flight?

if you need any backup.</i>

me, Friendly Chemist.

Shit. Bowden,
you know something, huh?

1539
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,579
[Rick] Hmm.

1540
01:31:52,413 --> 01:31:55,282
He wants to fuck me in the ass,
he can pay for the privilege.

1541
01:31:57,952 --> 01:31:59,987
[Ross whistling]

1542
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:11,198
Fucking bullshit.

1543

[sighs]

1544
01:32:17,238 --> 01:32:20,941
- No. No. No.
- Piece of shit.

1545
01:32:20,975 --> 01:32:24,011
Ah. I'm gonna
send you something, okay?

1546
01:32:24,045 --> 01:32:25,880
Send him this.

1547
01:32:27,148 --> 01:32:29,550
Is that
his fucking IP address, yo?

1548
01:32:30,017 --> 01:32:31,285
That'll wake him up.

1549
01:32:39,193 --> 01:32:40,227
Shit.

1550
01:32:57,778 --> 01:32:59,280
What's so funny, dude?

1551
01:32:59,313 --> 01:33:01,749
We're on a fucking stakeout,
you know, right?

1552
01:33:01,782 --> 01:33:03,250
Well, it's more like
a shakedown, remember?

1553
01:33:03,284 --> 01:33:04,318
- I guess so.

1554
01:33:09,857 --> 01:33:11,692
[Rick] Fuck, yeah,
I do international jobs.

01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:15,863
Friendly fucking Chemist

1556
01:33:15,896 --> 01:33:17,765
- [chuckles]
- I think I might know a biker up there

1557
01:33:17,798 --> 01:33:19,200
who could take care of business.

1558
01:33:21,035 --> 01:33:24,705
I want you to set up another user
profile, RedWhiteAndBlue.

1559
01:33:24,738 --> 01:33:27,241
Fucking Bowden,
a stone-cold criminal.

1560
01:33:27,875 --> 01:33:29,877
When the fuck
you learn how to do that?

1561
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:32,279
<i>Hey, it's Cally. Uh...</i>

1562
01:33:32,313 --> 01:33:35,149
<i>We are here at the restaurant,

Please hurry. Okay, love you, bye.</i>

[Mom] You're a major...

1566
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:46,227
Hey, sorry I'm late.

1567
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:49,196
- Hi, sweetheart. Hi.
- Hey.

1568
01:33:49,864 --> 01:33:52,700
- You look great.
- You look stressed.

1569
01:33:52,733 --> 01:33:54,935
Oh, no.
It's just work stuff, you know?

1570
01:33:56,003 --> 01:33:58,172
How was the flight? Oh.

1571
01:33:58,672 --> 01:34:01,075
I don't know why you wasted
money on business class.

1572
01:34:01,775 --> 01:34:03,677
[all chuckle]

1573
01:34:03,911 --> 01:34:08,249
Uh... Well, reservation's under my name.
Ulbricht.

1574
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,118
Follow me.

1575
01:34:11,152 --> 01:34:12,786
Listen, I'll see you guys
in there.

1576
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:13,921
- Okay?
- Okay.

1577
01:34:14,523 --> 01:34:16,290
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

1578
01:34:17,324 --> 01:34:19,827
- You sure?
- Yeah. No, I'm good.

1579
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,696
Okay.
Don't let me strain it.

[Rayford] Cold, bitch. Cold.

1583
01:34:43,384 --> 01:34:46,420
- Please.
- [chuckles] Fuck, dude.

1584
01:34:48,189 --> 01:34:50,124
Fucker, hit him back, though.

[phone chimes]

1586
01:35:04,438 --> 01:35:05,472
[Cally] We can just order.

1587
01:35:05,507 --> 01:35:07,741
No. Let's wait for him.

1588
01:35:36,804 --> 01:35:38,839
[Rayford]
We got him. Let's go.

1589
01:35:40,174 --> 01:35:42,076
Checkmate, motherfucker.

1590

[bones crack]

1592
01:35:48,882 --> 01:35:50,384
Here he comes.
We'll wait.

1593
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:51,885
I'm sorry about that.

1594
01:35:53,053 --> 01:35:56,156
Work's been, uh... crazy.

1595
01:35:58,826 --> 01:36:00,227
[Dad] Hey.

1596
01:36:02,997 --> 01:36:05,366
I'm really proud of you
and how hard you're working.

1597
01:36:08,202 --> 01:36:10,271
I guess you found the thing.

1598
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:14,174
Yeah.

1599
01:36:49,376 --> 01:36:51,412
[wind howling]

1600
01:37:17,171 --> 01:37:19,541
How the fuck
do you eat that shit, yo?

1601
01:37:19,574 --> 01:37:22,209
- The fuck you got against bear claws, huh?
- Fucking disgusting.

1602
01:37:22,677 --> 01:37:26,447
Don't even got a fucking half-and-half
at this bullshit-ass donut shop.

1603
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,382
The fuck is this?

1604
01:37:28,415 --> 01:37:30,951
You call me out here to watch
you eat a fucking bear claw?

1605
01:37:36,558 --> 01:37:38,459
I want you
to give that to Sandy.

1606
01:37:45,299 --> 01:37:47,501
You could still get out
from under this, right?

1607
01:37:47,935 --> 01:37:49,403
Right. [chuckles]

1608
01:37:51,071 --> 01:37:52,373
Tired, man.

1609
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:55,442
"Tired, man."

1610
01:37:57,177 --> 01:37:59,046
Don't give up, Rick.

1611
01:37:59,079 --> 01:38:01,014
[scoffs] You know, man...

1612
01:38:02,282 --> 01:38:03,618
I was wrong about you.

1613
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:07,087
You are a friend.

1614
01:38:10,625 --> 01:38:12,025
Don't let me down.

1615
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:39,486
He's on the move.
Got his laptop with him.

1616
01:38:39,521 --> 01:38:41,021
[Tarbell]
<i>Which way is he coming?</i>

1617
01:38:42,657 --> 01:38:44,191
Right at you.

1618
01:38:44,692 --> 01:38:46,059
Fuck.

1619
01:38:51,031 --> 01:38:52,534
[waiter] How can I help you?

1620
01:38:52,567 --> 01:38:55,102
- Iced tea, please.
- Sure. It'll be three dollars.

1621
01:39:01,175 --> 01:39:03,545
- Keep the change.
- [waiter] Thanks.

1622
01:39:15,289 --> 01:39:16,490
On him.

1623

[Ross] <i>For years,
I was frustrated</i>

1627
01:39:31,305 --> 01:39:33,508
<i>by what seemed to be
the insurmountable barriers</i>

1628

<i>So, I began making a website where people
could buy and sell anything anonymously.</i>

1630
01:39:44,418 --> 01:39:47,755
<i>I built it because I think
the pursuit of freedom</i>

1631

<i>is the most
noble human endeavor.</i>

1632
01:39:51,091 --> 01:39:53,327
<i>I knew the state might try
to impede it,</i>

1633
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:56,063
<i>but if we never try
for fear of retribution,</i>

1637
01:40:04,806 --> 01:40:08,275
<i>It's about taking back
our liberty.</i>

1638
01:40:08,308 --> 01:40:12,346
<i>And as corny as it sounds,
I just wanna look back at my life</i>

He doesn't log in, we abort.

1643
01:40:24,559 --> 01:40:27,261

Uh, yeah, pump that over.
Okay, we're good.

1650
01:40:40,608 --> 01:40:43,578
Let's zoom in there.
Yeah, that's good. Yeah.

1651
01:40:43,611 --> 01:40:45,279
We got him, huh?

1652
01:40:45,312 --> 01:40:47,214

Let's get him.

Hold, hold.

[Rick] <i>Hey, kid, listen.</i>

[Tarbell] Do it, you son of a bitch.
Come on. Log in.

Now.

Head down. Keep moving.
Head down. Turn around.

This whole country is overrun

And everything they know,

Experience matters, Johnny.

And you, above all people,
should know that.

1692
01:43:26,507 --> 01:43:30,812
You got a whole building full of us old

[Shields] Rick, turn around.
Hands up.

1697
01:43:46,027 --> 01:43:48,228
Hands where I can see 'em.
You're under arrest.

Did you, uh...

1712

[inhales]

01:45:46,446 --> 01:45:47,849

Hey. Oh, peanut.

Hi, Dada.

So?

1723
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:06,000
Oh, my gosh. Wow.
Look at that, huh?

1724
01:46:06,033 --> 01:46:09,770
Mom, you're seeing that?
Huh? Is it matching?

1725
01:46:10,338 --> 01:46:12,472
- No?
- I made it my own way.

1726
01:46:14,108 --> 01:46:17,377
Good girl, peanut.
Good girl.

1727
01:46:18,546 --> 01:46:21,782
So, new school, huh?
Excited?

1728
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:26,453
Nervous? Little?
No, you're not nervous, are you?

1729
01:46:26,486 --> 01:46:28,689
No, you're my big tiger,
aren't you?

1730
01:46:28,723 --> 01:46:31,959
- [roars]
- [roars] There you go. Huh?

1731
01:46:34,095 --> 01:46:36,496
They're probably gonna
tell you some things, peanut.

1732
01:46:37,665 --> 01:46:39,867
They're gonna tell you,
you're gonna hear some things, you know,

1733
01:46:39,901 --> 01:46:41,836
say things like,
you know, life is...

1734
01:46:43,704 --> 01:46:45,573
life is not always
black and white,

1735
01:46:45,606 --> 01:46:48,408
but, you know, things are
more complicated than that.

1736
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:50,912
Okay?

1737
01:46:50,945 --> 01:46:55,650
But here's the truth.
Okay?

1738

- There's good and bad in this world.
- [knocking on door]

01:47:03,591 --> 01:47:07,762
And, uh, sometimes you gotta make a
choice, you gotta pick a side, okay?

1740
01:47:11,198 --> 01:47:13,701
I'll always be there
to tell you this...

1741
01:47:17,104 --> 01:47:18,706
that you are loved.

1742
