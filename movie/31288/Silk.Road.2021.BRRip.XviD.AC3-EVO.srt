00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,202
<i>For years I was
frustrated by what seemed to be</i>

3
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:14,308
<i>the insurmountable barriers between the
world as it is and the world I wanted.</i>

4
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:17,377
<i>So, I began making a website</i>

5
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,714
<i>where people could buy and sell
anything anonymously.</i>

6
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,215
He's on the move,
got his laptop with him.

7
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,585
<i>Which way is he coming?</i>

8
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,521
Right at you.

9
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,891
<i>Blue hoodie, jeans, flip-flops.</i>

10
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,326
<i>On foot, westbound
towards the target location.</i>

11
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,361
<i>I'm letting him go,
confirm when you have a visual.</i>

12
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,331
<i>I knew the state
might try to impede it.</i>

13
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,433
<i>But if we never try
for fear of retribution,</i>

14
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,636
<i>then we've already lost,
you know?</i>

15
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,374
<i>Silk Road is about
something much bigger</i>

16
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,510
<i>than thumbing your nose
at the man.</i>

17
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,648
<i>It's about
taking back our liberty.</i>

18
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:59,353
<i>And as corny as it sounds,
I just wanna look back at my life</i>

19
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,824
<i>and know that I did something
that helped people.</i>

20
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,393
Nobody moves until my go.
He doesn't log in, we abort.

21
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,896
- <i>Copy.</i>
- And I repeat, he closes the laptop,

22
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,898
<i>the data's encrypted
and we got shit.</i>

23
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:12,232
<i>Roger that, out.</i>

24
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,570
<i>Everybody on point
here, heads on a swivel.</i>

25
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,821
<i>Aggress, collapse and contain.
Stand by for takedown.</i>

26
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,927
Hey, who the fuck
is calling him?

27
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:47,769
Hello?

28
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,437
Keep it running.

29
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,572
I'll be here.

30
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:33,748
Fuck this fucking shit.

31
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,694
- How you doing?
- Hey.

32
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:49,931
Uh, give me
a pack of Camels, please.

33
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:51,298
Mm.

34
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:53,601
Something else?

35
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:00,842
Mints. You got any mints?

36
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,710
Yeah, right behind
you, lower shelf.

37
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,650
Rick Bowden. What's up, yo?
When you get out?

38
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:12,520
'- Cause I heard you was in the...
- booby hatch.

39
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,956
First off, Rayford,
I was in, uh...

40
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:17,692
I was in rehab,
not a psych ward.

41
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,292
Oh, well,
I heard it was rehab,

42
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,393
then it was a psych ward.

43
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,461
Really?

44
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:23,531
Yeah, who told you that?

45
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,000
Clocked your digital footprint.

46
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,305
Well, it was good to see you, brother.

47
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,741
I ain't
your fucking brother.

48
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,543
Oh, why you
do me like that, yo?

49
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:36,844
We... We friends, right?

50
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:38,045
I don't have fucking friends,

51
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,412
I have informants.

52
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,520
Oh, fuck this dude, I'm...

53
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,388
- Your cigarettes?
- I don't want no fucking cigarettes, man.

54
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,094
Motherfucker so angry, yo.

55
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,494
Get all kinds in here.

56
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,064
Where them
hot Cheetos at, bro?

57
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,404
Unless you're a postal worker,
you're not allowed to dress like one,

58
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,506
even on Halloween.

59
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,977
Defacing the dollar bill,
consorting with a known pirate.

60
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:13,380
Technically, these are all
crimes against the state.

61
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,684
Right now there are
5,000 criminal statutes.

62
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,086
And that's just at the national level.
Forget about the states.

63
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,523
Well, until 1967,
it was illegal

64
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:25,793
for a white man to marry a Black
woman in the state of Virginia.

65
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:29,831
In 14 other states, including the
great state of Texas, mind you,

66
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:34,635
it was illegal for two people to
have consensual sodomy until 2002.

67
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,905
America has lost its compass,
man.

68
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:40,373
If you wanna fall in love with
someone who doesn't look like you

69
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,476
or have sex with somebody who does,
that is your inalienable right.

70
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,014
I thought we were
talking about Obamacare.

71
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:49,449
What the fuck
are you talking about?

72
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,687
Look, it doesn't matter how
well-intentioned the president is, man.

73
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,657
The state cannot legislate what
the person can and can't do.

74
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:58,159
It is un-American.

75
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,861
And next, they're gonna
come for our guns

76
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:01,696
and giving them
to the border crossers.

77
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,463
Am I right?

78
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,866
Uh, who the fuck
is this guy?

79
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,901
Case in point.
A perfect stranger

80
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,903
wants to butt in
on a private conversation

81
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:13,074
between friends with an
inane, ignorant non sequitur,

82
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,776
his right to do so
is constitutionally-protected.

83
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:18,646
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

84
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,714
You believe this asshole?

85
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:20,948
Well, the First Amendment.

86
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:28,923
Out of your league.

87
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,060
Wanna dance?

88
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,730
No one else is.

89
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,099
Exactly.

90
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,510
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

91
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,713
Uh, we were
gonna pick you up.

92
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,815
I didn't want
Edie to see me in that place.

93
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,585
Okay.

94
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,922
- Welcome home.
- Ah.

95
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,724
- Hey, so we are clear...
- Daddy! Hey!

96
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:07,128
- Oh!
- Hey! Look who's here!

97
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,665
I missed my peanut.
Oh, come here.

98
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,938
Come here, let me look at you.
I missed you.

99
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:18,471
I missed you more.

100
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,475
You're just beautiful.
You sure are.

101
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:25,680
Come on,
let's just take these inside.

102
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,014
Let's go and make necklaces,
come on.

103
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:28,649
Let's do matching ones,

104
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:29,984
let's do two yellows,
two blues. Yeah?

105
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,118
Okay.

106
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:32,853
House looks good.

107
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,088
You look good.

108
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,124
Huh?

109
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,126
Two yellows.

110
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,697
What's that? Huh?

111
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,699
Come on, I thought we said
we were gonna do matching.

112
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,667
- It's matching. Isn't it?
- No, it's not.

113
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,036
We got a green and a brown.

114
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,074
What did... Should we do two
browns and two greens then, yeah?

115
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:54,141
Sure.

116
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:56,143
You okay?

117
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:57,912
Yeah.

118
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,185
Matching, isn't it?

119
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,854
Come on, come here.

120
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,622
Sweetie, hey.

121
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,691
You know what'd be super fun?

122
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:12,927
Do you wanna go set up a tea
party for dad in your room?

123
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,261
He loves tea.

124
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,163
Yeah.

125
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,839
It's a thing. The school called
and we have to get her tested.

126
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,273
- Tested?
- Yeah.

127
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:27,541
No, we're not
getting her tested.

128
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28,943
Are you kidding me? Come on.

129
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,144
Honey, she's a late bloomer.

130
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,612
It's a learning disorder. Rick,

131
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,214
- it's a real thing, okay?
- Oh.

132
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,082
I've been here, okay,
you haven't been here.

133
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:36,884
I'm the one raising her right now.

134
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,023
Look, honey, you know...

135
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,126
I lost my way a little.

136
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,029
Okay? But I'm back. And I'm...

137
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:52,233
I'm gonna be here
for you and Edie, okay?

138
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,701
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

139
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,037
Hmm? Hmm?

140
00:08:58,072 --> 00:09:00,074
You do it again,
you don't bother coming back.

141
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,135
Hey.

142
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,738
Two plates?
What are you, a monk?

143
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:33,040
No,
it's an experiment.

144
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,876
I don't have anything
because I don't need anything.

145
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:41,615
Okay, well, besides from
living like a homeless person,

146
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:42,716
what's your deal?

147
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:44,285
Um...

148
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,020
Well, I'm almost a physicist.

149
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,755
I never quite got to...

150
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,924
- That's not what I mean.
- ...actual physics...

151
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,129
Honestly?

152
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,230
Always.

153
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,099
Okay.

154
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:05,039
I don't really wanna say.
To be honest, it sounds corny.

155
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,141
Try me.

156
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,877
Okay. Um...

157
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:15,616
Ever since I can remember,
I've always wanted to change the world.

158
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,219
How?

159
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,621
Um...

160
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,759
Are you familiar with Ludwig von Mises?
Austrian School of Economics?

161
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,128
Um, no.

162
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,262
Okay, most people aren't.

163
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,798
But his ideas are beautiful.

164
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:33,434
It's like poetry or math.

165
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,035
I'm wilting, Rossman.

166
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,237
Okay.

167
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,305
In a sentence,

168
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,841
every action that we take
outside of government control

169
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,810
strengthens the market
and weakens the state.

170
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,447
Seriously?

171
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,048
Yes.

172
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:50,017
I just fucked
a libertarian?

173
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:53,888
Surprise.

174
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,239
Fucking Morales, eh?

175
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,042
<i>Mi hombre,</i> huh.
Come here.

176
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:24,485
Fucked up out there, Johnny.
I know that.

177
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,821
Well, we kept you in too long.
You went native. That's on us.

178
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,456
No, man, I should've...

179
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,358
I'm a big boy, I can take it.

180
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:33,327
I should've fucking put
the hand up and said,

181
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,264
"Yo, man, over here. Not fucking...
not waving around."

182
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,903
- So I'll ride the bench a while.
- Rick...

183
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:45,105
Come on, man, I can work
Bocelli behind a desk, I can...

184
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:48,108
You wrapped your car around
a tree in Old San Juan, man.

185
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,177
I also took a narco predator
off the streets, too.

186
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,513
You might wanna mention that.

187
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,147
What about
when I listen to the wire,

188
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,015
and then I find out
that the whole thing,

189
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:58,252
it jumped off because you
told Gomez he was retarded?

190
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,389
I mean, what the fuck,
you know?

191
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,124
You want me to fucking say, man?
You listen...

192
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:07,228
Rick, maybe I'm not
making myself clear.

193
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:08,862
No, man,
maybe I'm not makin' myself clear.

194
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:09,964
- Rick...
- I ride the bench for a while.

195
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,398
You tell me how long...

196
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,535
You were coked
out of your fucking mind,

197
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:16,237
endangering the lives
of civilians.

198
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,038
You're never
working the streets again.

199
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,273
What the fuck
does that mean?

200
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,474
What do you think
it means?

201
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:26,780
It's what I do, Johnny.
It's who I am, man, I mean, come on.

202
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:30,451
Fucking look at me,
I'm a fucking door kicker, man.

203
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:33,320
Read it. Read this shit.

204
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:37,559
Fuck sakes, man. The brass,
they wanted you out on your ass.

205
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:39,893
No pension. No nothing.

206
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:47,167
You're being reassigned, man.
Cybercrimes.

207
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:50,037
See GS Shields on Monday.
He'll get you squared away.

208
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:08,389
Mm.

209
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:10,858
It was really good.

210
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,996
So how's the book business?

211
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,232
Sold the bus.

212
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:21,402
Well, that seems
a bit drastic, love.

213
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:25,105
No, Mom... Good Wagon
just was not the thing.

214
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,042
Really wasn't.

215
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,587
Give her a shot.

216
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,561
Come on.
Let's see if you still got it.

217
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,563
I'm not a trained monkey, Dad.

218
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:52,166
When Ross was nine,
he was consumed with the idea

219
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,301
of making the Guinness
Book of World Records.

220
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,371
- What was it, eight seconds?
- 6.8.

221
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:00,140
We trained every day
for three months.

222
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:06,980
And then the night before,
Ross abruptly decides it wasn't the thing.

223
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:11,285
PhD, a video game start-up,
now Good Wagon.

224
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,120
Tell me when you see a pattern.

225
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,188
Let's go.

226
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,993
It was really good.

227
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,896
Thanks, honey.
Yeah, it was nice to meet you.

228
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,173
Are you okay?

229
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,043
Yeah.

230
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,178
You sure?

231
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,348
Yes, yes. I'm fine.

232
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,250
Look, just because
your dad's a dick

233
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,085
doesn't mean that you
won't change the world.

234
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:48,422
I believe in you,
Rossman.

235
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,704
Hey.

236
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:39,607
I'm after Supervisor Shields.

237
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:40,974
Yeah, I'm Shields.

238
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,347
Rick Bowden.
Johnny Morales sent me.

239
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,416
It's an honor to meet you, Bowden.
We're glad to have you.

240
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,285
- It's good to be here.
- Yeah.

241
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,287
Yeah, sorry, I'm late.
I hit the range, little tune up.

242
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,455
I gotta re-qualify.

243
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:55,557
Can I ask you

244
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,624
a personal question, Rick?

245
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:58,425
Yeah.

246
00:15:58,459 --> 00:15:59,993
Is it true

247
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,395
what happened in,
uh, Puerto Rico?

248
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,996
What part?

249
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,666
Eighteen-month op went sideways

250
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:07,401
when you told the cartel boss
he was a Mongoloid?

251
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,173
So we got an open floor plan.
Foster inter-squad exchange.

252
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,008
But Johnny said
you were old school.

253
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,611
Thought you might prefer
some privacy.

254
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:20,481
So we got you in here.
This little number.

255
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:29,223
We got a series 9, 16 gigs of RAM.
Intel processor. She's a rocket.

256
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:30,324
RAM up, huh?

257
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:36,531
Yeah. RAM up. Well,
welcome to Cybercrimes, Bowden.

258
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,540
You can do this.

259
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:49,711
Okay, real talk.
Good Wagon was never gonna work.

260
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:52,346
Brick and mortar is dead.
We live in a convenience culture.

261
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,381
Everyone wants everything
shipped to their door.

262
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,383
And Bezos
already beat you to it.

263
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,653
Now,
today's moneymaker is social

264
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,755
because everyone wants to know
what everyone else is up to.

265
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:03,825
- Like I said it would.
- No. Bullshit. That is bullshit.

266
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:06,561
People want anonymity.
Now more than ever.

267
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:10,497
The Internet was spawned off of the
things that people try and keep secret.

268
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:14,201
Think about it.
Porn, gambling, drugs.

269
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:17,839
Okay, but you can't buy drugs
on the Internet, Ross.

270
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:20,440
Hmm.
I've been thinking about this.

271
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:23,110
What if you could?

272
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,346
Uh, what are you saying?

273
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,751
Think about it.
Amazon for drugs.

274
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,419
You despise Amazon.

275
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,388
But I love freedom.

276
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,423
Yeah, well, whoever does this,

277
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,492
they're an idiot, first off,

278
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:41,295
and second off, they'd be busted
in, like, two seconds.

279
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,797
Not if
every transaction's encrypted.

280
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:46,266
What do you know about Tor?

281
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,669
- What, the Onion Router?
- Nothing.

282
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,672
Uh, it was designed by the
spooks at DARPA and the Navy.

283
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:53,841
It's a network that directs web
traffic through a series of relays.

284
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,142
What for?

285
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,745
Concealing location and usage.

286
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,847
Essentially,
it's a digital invisibility cloak.

287
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:02,650
It's perfect for doing
business on the Dark Web.

288
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:06,588
Okay, but if they follow the
money, then you're fucked, right?

289
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,322
Bitcoin.

290
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,490
- Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin?

291
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,292
Bitcoin.

292
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:14,194
Bitcoin?

293
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:17,665
It's like tokens in an arcade.

294
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:19,667
You go into the arcade,
you buy the tokens,

295
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:22,202
but nobody knows
which tokens you used.

296
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,338
- Okay, it's a little...
- It's completely anonymous transactions.

297
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:28,175
- Think about it.
- It's a little basic explanation, uh, but...

298
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,242
I like tokens.

299
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:31,779
And I like drugs.

300
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:33,915
<i>Okay,
so the first thing you need to do</i>

301
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:36,818
<i>is go to www.torproject.org.</i>

302
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:40,788
<i>Go to the link in the description,
guys, click the download Tor button.</i>

303
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:43,423
Tell me
that's not a YouTube tutorial.

304
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,493
It's not like they're
giving classes at UT, babe.

305
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:50,197
<i>Welcome to
an introduction to the Internet.</i>

306
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:52,900
<i>If you're not comfortable
with your computer,</i>

307
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:55,435
<i>you may need
to play this tape many times.</i>

308
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:02,275
<i>Using your pointer finger,
rest it on the left button.</i>

309
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:05,813
<i>Press down
and you will see a menu bar.</i>

310
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:09,182
<i>Press down
and you will see a menu bar.</i>

311
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:11,284
<i>Press down
and you will see a menu bar.</i>

312
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,588
- <i>Press down and you will...</i>
- Motherfucker!

313
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,298
<i>I didn't know
you knew how to write code.</i>

314
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,435
<i>I don't,
but I'm teaching myself.</i>

315
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,205
I'm not gonna get up from this
computer until I've mastered it.

316
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,513
All right. Enjoy your nerd shit.
I'm gonna go get tacos.

317
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:47,522
Where you guys at on Bocelli?
Huh?

318
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,624
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, fuck that, come on, where you at?

319
00:19:49,657 --> 00:19:51,793
It's an eyes-only briefing,
Rick. You know the drill.

320
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:54,227
Boss, we could really use one of
Bowden's informants right now.

321
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,831
He's not running any.
He's in Cybercrimes.

322
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:58,766
Come on.

323
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:02,269
Okay.

324
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:12,880
Hey.

325
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:19,721
What is it?

326
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:21,823
Open it.

327
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:29,931
It's a book.

328
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:31,298
It's a little more than that.

329
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,534
Open it.

330
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,740
You bought
drugs from yourself.

331
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:40,007
I had to beta test it.

332
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:45,012
By committing a felony?
Congratulations.

333
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:46,480
No. You're missing it.

334
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:49,817
Look, I am using the Internet

335
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:51,953
as an instrument of liberty.

336
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:53,755
But that's illegal, Ross.

337
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:56,624
But the war on drugs is a farce.
This is America.

338
00:20:56,657 --> 00:21:01,529
If you wanna smoke a bowl, snort a line,
pop a pill, that is your prerogative.

339
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:06,000
And now, thanks to Underground
Brokers, you can.

340
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:08,335
Underground Brokers?

341
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:09,637
That's the name of the site.

342
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:13,541
Okay, aside from it
being a terrible name,

343
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:16,376
are you sure
you wanna go through with this?

344
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,478
You don't like the name?

345
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:22,349
That's all you heard?
That's all you're taking away?

346
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,417
You are
so loving yourself, don't you?

347

Cocksucker.

365
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:36,791
- Yes, Rick.
- Dude, look at this, man.

366
00:22:36,824 --> 00:22:38,559
I think it has
a fucking virus or something.

367
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:40,460
I swear to God, every time
I try to hit,

368
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,929
well, it says, it just...

369
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:44,431
What is "undeliverable message"?
What is that?

370
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:48,102
Well, Rick, okay,
I know you're having a hard time adapting.

371
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:49,737
Okay, and I get it's weird,
it's weird, dude,

372
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,572
having a 26-year-old boss.

373
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:53,674
Frankly,
it's pretty odd for me, too.

374
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,711
But you can't call me in here
every day for tech support.

375
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,880
I'm running
17 active investigations.

376
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:00,781
I simply don't have the time.
All right?

377
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:02,116
Yeah, well, I apologize.

378
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:05,753
Just trying to,
you know, find my place.

379
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:07,822
All right, Rick,
I'm just gonna be straight with you,

380
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:10,892
because that's what
Johnny Morales suggested.

381
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:13,493
You don't have to do squat.

382
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:18,966
Like, you can just kind of sit
back, watch old Orioles games or,

383
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,002
I don't know,
whatever it is you're into.

384
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:24,639
And in nine months,
you can retire with full pension.

385
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,508
So, that's it, huh? Just...

386
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:30,778
Rick, okay, I've got an ace
team of 20-somethings out there,

387
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:33,080
fresh out of MIT, Cal Tech.

388
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:35,783
They're making financial cases
that, frankly,

389
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:37,018
you wouldn't
even understand, okay?

390
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:39,486
But you know what?

391
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,789
You don't have to, okay?
So just relax, it...

392
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:45,760
I was locking up bad guys since before
you started shaving your fucking nuts.

393
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:48,629
Now, I maybe old and slow...

394
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,098
but I ain't stupid.

395
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:58,706
I'm glad
we understand each other.

396
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,100
Yo, Rayford,

397
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,635
come on, man,
get in the car.

398
00:24:28,803 --> 00:24:31,872
Come on, shit, dude, don't be like that.
I thought we were friends.

399
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:34,474
Oh, now we friends?
Fuck you, Bowden.

400
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:38,612
Come on, Rayford,
get in the fucking car, dude. Huh?

401
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:43,050
I ain't gonna fucking bite.

402
00:24:44,018 --> 00:24:45,252
There you go.

403
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,996
I'm out the game, yo,
I don't sling no more.

404
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:58,065
What's in the box?
Show me.

405
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,200
It's just sneakers, yo.

406
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,735
Open the fucking box, dude.

407
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:02,770
Sneakers. You see?

408
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:04,739
Hey. Tut-tut-tut-tut.

409
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:06,507
No, don't touch that.
Come on, yo.

410
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:10,978
No shit, huh?

411
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:13,280
That's what you do.

412
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:14,815
Yeah, sneakers, thank you.

413
00:25:16,684 --> 00:25:18,219
I need a solid, dude.

414
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:19,987
- Solid? No.
- Yeah.

415
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:21,288
I'm not doing
no more Rick Bowden solids, yo.

416
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:22,656
- No?
- No.

417
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:28,029
See, I'm remembering a night
at 1:00 a.m. in the morning

418
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:32,166
when I got a call that you'd been
picked up by the Baltimore PD.

419
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:34,235
And I got out of bed,
drove down,

420
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:36,670
got there by 2:00

421
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:38,105
and saved
your little Black ass

422
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:39,707
from getting violated.

423
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,042
Yo, what's the solid, yo?
What you need?

424
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:42,610
Oh, gonna need
a little bit more

425
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:44,178
of manners than that, dude.

426
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,579
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

427
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:48,682
What do you need, yo?

428
00:25:48,716 --> 00:25:50,084
You might not know it,

429
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:55,256
but dudes are buying and selling
narcotics on the computers.

430
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:58,692
There was a reshuffle at work and I got
promoted and put into cybercrimes, so...

431
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:02,897
I need someone to show me
how to buy dope on YouTube.

432
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,998
Can you do that?

433
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,033
Buy dope where?

434
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:08,002
On YouTube.

435
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:11,105
What, did I say it wrong?

436
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:12,907
Fucking tube,
whatever the fuck tube it is,

437
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,341
I need to buy it off it.

438
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:18,045
Oh, shit. Yo, you have
no fucking idea, yo.

439
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,213
Well, that's...

440
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:22,983
Oh, shit.
You gonna buy dope on YouTube.

441
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:24,919
Yeah, let's get, uh,
some meth on Google.

442
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:27,088
Just back the fuck up, dude.

443
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:29,256
- You wanna get some fucking...
- Do you know what an informant is?

444
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,059
For sure. I'ma inform you that
you don't buy dope on YouTube.

445
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:33,928
I'm gonna inform you
that I'm gonna

446
00:26:33,961 --> 00:26:35,696
- fucking shoot your fucking sneakers.
- Whoa, whoa!

447
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,904
Whoa, holy shit, man.
What the fuck?

448
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:47,074
This is some kind of, like,
ghetto Batcave, huh?

449
00:26:47,108 --> 00:26:51,045
Yeah. Told you.
This sneaker-head shit is a moneymaker.

450
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:53,114
- Yeah?
- You got a computer and a connection,

451
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:54,915
- you can sell anything.
- Really?

452
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:57,051
Don't touch
any of my shit, though.

453
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:58,652
All right, man. Christ.

454
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:00,788
All right, check this out.

455
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:11,665
eBay for dope fiends.
They even got reviews and shit.

456
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:13,868
Oh, shit.

457
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:18,005
So what do you do? You just...

458
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,741
You buy it on here
and then what?

459
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:22,076
What do you mean,
"and then what?"

460
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:25,112
What, it just arrives
at your fucking door?

461
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:28,382
Yeah, yo. People been fucking with
the Dark Web for a minute now.

462
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:30,217
Light shit,
you know what I'm saying?

463
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:32,720
Niggas was using PayPal,
Western Union, dumb shit.

464
00:27:32,753 --> 00:27:34,221
But you cyber pigs
was on to that.

465
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:37,291
The genius of this,
they using Bitcoin.

466
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,893
Fucking genius shit.

467
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:42,062
What's Bitcoin?

468
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:44,131
It's crypto currency, yo.

469
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:45,900
- Okay.
- It's the future of money.

470
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,334
I'm sayin', a few niggas
know about it now,

471
00:27:47,368 --> 00:27:49,203
but once people get hip
to this shit,

472
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:51,105
it's gonna be in every suburb
in America.

473
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:54,942
The fuck do you know
all this shit, man?

474
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:56,844
Baltimore Public Library.

475
00:27:57,478 --> 00:27:59,847
Fuck.

476
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,116
Fuck is so funny, yo?
You wanna buy some drugs or not?

477
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:03,484
I do wanna buy some drugs,
so...

478
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:05,452
Don't touch my shit, all right?

479
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:06,854
Don't touch my shit.

480
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:09,023
Come on, dude,
lighten up, so...

481
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:10,891
Uh-huh.
What you want?

482
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:12,493
I don't know.
I think we should start with...

483
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:15,362
Anything you want.
You want some mushrooms?

484
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:18,299
You look like
someone who does mushrooms.

485
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:28,876
You know, you are a walking
cliché, Bow-den.

486
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:31,178
White man buying dope
from a nigga in the hood.

487
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,881
Yeah, well,
that's Bowden, motherfucker.

488
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:35,849
Bowden, Bow-den,
same shit, man.

489
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,151
- Bowden.
- All right.

490
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:39,453
Yo, let me ask you a question.

491
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:41,956
- Shoot.
- Who out there slinging right now?

492
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:45,092
Some jumpy-ass
rabbit motherfucker

493
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:47,361
with the cornrows
and the buck teeth there.

494
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:50,731
- Look at him.
- Yeah. You racist as shit.

495
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:53,067
Yeah, but am I fucking wrong?

496
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,969
Nah, today you right as rain.

497
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:58,973
But tomorrow,
look over there, see that?

498
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:00,174
See that nigga right there?

499
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,877
- Hmm.
- Game is changing, feel me?

500
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:05,879
Do you have my shit?

501
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:07,948
Yeah.

502
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:11,986
- Bam.
- No shit.

503
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:13,487
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

504
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,991
Welcome to the future, baby.

505
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,995
Let me see your phone.

506
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:23,931
- Your phone.
- Fuck you want with my phone?

507
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,099
Let me see your phone.

508
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:26,967
There, have at it.

509
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:30,938
All right. Let me see your ID.

510
00:29:31,606 --> 00:29:34,509
- Why?
- Let me see your ID. Shit.

511
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,212
Old-ass wallet.

512
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:39,880
What are you doing?

513
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:41,482
Can you just relax for a second?

514
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:44,552
All right.

515
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,056
Congratulations, you now own
a Bitcoin wallet.

516
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:52,192
Next time you want some dope,
have Uncle Sam send it, all right?

517
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,530
Now that's your solid,
don't call me no fucking more.

518
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:58,332
Get your own fucking...

519
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:17,519
No, I mean, we're talking
about a multi-jurisdiction.

520
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:20,522
- The situation that, um...
- Shields, you need to see this.

521
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:22,022
- But what I'm saying is that, if...
- Boss.

522
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:23,223
Hold on, one moment.

523
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:26,293
No, not now, Rick, stop.
Go on.

524
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:30,230
Yeah, right, in a normal situation
there's, uh, you know,

525
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:33,500
for every man in the forces,
there's a manager.

526
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:36,203
So what I'm saying here is that
we take the...

527
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:38,506
I mean, we could, yeah,
but, it...

528
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:43,444
<i>I've decided to keep a journal
about my experience running the site.</i>

529
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:47,047
<i>I imagine that someday I may have
a story written about my life</i>

530
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:50,017
<i>and it would be a good idea to
keep a detailed account of it.</i>

531
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:53,987
<i>I'm creating
a year of prosperity and power</i>

532
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,890
<i>beyond what I have
ever experienced before.</i>

533
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:01,462
<i>Silk Road
is going to become a phenomenon.</i>

534
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:03,631
<i>And at least one person
will tell me about it</i>

535
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:06,033
<i>unknowing
that I was its creator.</i>

536
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,478
Oh, shit.
These beers fair game? Ross?

537
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:21,248
Earth to Ross. Hello,
Mr. Rossington. Okay.

538
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:23,016
That's a yes.

539
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:25,252
Yo, check this out.

540
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:29,123
Great name, nice camel.

541
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:30,290
Keep reading.

542
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:34,596
Okay, Indicas,
Sour Diesel 13 and Grape Ape.

543
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:38,132
Acid,
microdot or blotter.

544
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:42,035
MDMA, ecstasy,
basically the same thing and 'shrooms.

545
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:44,938
Yeah, dude,
you're, uh, so getting busted.

546
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:47,642
Nope.
Bitcoin plus Tor. Untraceable.

547
00:31:47,675 --> 00:31:49,977
You're insane.
Can you please tell him he's insane?

548
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,345
You're insane.

549
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:53,347
Also, uh,
just a thought, friend.

550
00:31:53,815 --> 00:31:57,519
How's anyone supposed to find this?
You can't advertise it, Ross.

551
00:31:57,552 --> 00:32:00,120
I've been posing as a user
and touting it on the forums.

552
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:03,056
The forums?

553
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,025
What? The chat rooms...

554
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:07,194
You're too good for chat rooms,
too good for forums?

555
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:09,664
No, man, chat rooms are,
uh, cute, they're nice.

556
00:32:09,697 --> 00:32:14,234
But you're gonna want more exposure
than, you know, some 4chan fuck-heads.

557
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:16,638
Oh, you should call
my friend over at Gawker.

558
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:19,072
You have a friend at Gawker?

559
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:21,609
Yeah, I met him
at South By last year.

560
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:23,010
Don't ask.

561
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:24,612
Lot of questions there, but...

562
00:32:24,646 --> 00:32:26,146
Okay, well,
he's not just gonna

563
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,749
pick up an anonymous call

564
00:32:27,782 --> 00:32:30,484
at like, what,
10 o'clock at night?

565
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:34,087
Uh, that's exactly what he's gonna
do, he's a reporter. It's a story.

566
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:38,225
Don't do it.
Ross, I'm begging you, don't do it.

567
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:40,327
Ross, don't do it.

568
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,564
Yeah. Give me his number.

569
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:44,331
- No.
- Yeah.

570
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,401
*67.

571
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:48,570
- Of course.
- This is fucking dumb.

572
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:50,170
I wasn't born yesterday.

573
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:52,105
You're literally
going straight to...

574
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,541
It's your idea, bro.

575
00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:03,317
Gawker.

576
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,520
- <i>Adrian? Uh...</i>
- Who's this?

577
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:10,290
- <i>You don't know me, but I have your next story.</i>
- Thirty seconds.

578
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:14,261
Making small talk with your pot dealer
sucks. Buying cocaine can get you shot.

579
00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:17,231
But what if you could buy drugs
online like socks or light bulbs?

580
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:20,367
<i>Now you can with an online
website called Silk Road.</i>

581
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,169
<i>Did you coach him on this?</i>

582
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:23,538
Who am I talking with?

583
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:26,273
<i>Call me Mark.</i>

584
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:29,042
<i>No last name, but you can quote me.</i>

585
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:32,780
- And you created it?
- <i>No, but I ordered ten hits of acid</i>

586
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:36,518
<i>delivered to my doorstep
by the US Postal Service.</i>

587
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:38,318
And what did that feel like?

588
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:40,788
Well, to tell you the truth,
Adrian...

589
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:44,592
it kind of felt like the future.

590
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:51,365
Last question.
Anything you can't get on Silk Road?

591
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:53,367
<i>Nothing to harm or defraud.</i>

592
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,104
Like kiddie porn
or stolen credit cards.

593
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:59,139
<i>So no weapons-grade plutonium?</i>

594
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:00,374
Or murder for hire.

595
00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:02,577
<i>Is there anything
you'd like to add?</i>

596
00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:05,479
Yes.

597
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,584
Stop funding the state
with your tax dollars

598
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:13,253
and direct your productive
energies towards the black markets.

599
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:16,156
- Fuck you.
- Whoo!

600
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:19,259
- Holy shit.
- That felt good, man.

601
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:21,395
- You know what that felt like?
- No.

602
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:23,330
The future. You know.

603
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:25,299
I just felt it right in my
bones, right there, the future.

604
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:27,167
Go fuck yourself.
Don't be jealous.

605
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,570
It's right there,
it's right ahead of us.

606
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:42,249
Oh, hey, peanut! What are you doing here?
Huh? What are you doing here?

607
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:43,818
Hey.
We were in the neighborhood.

608
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,352
Thought we could stop by
and say hey.

609
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:47,722
- Is that right? This for me?
- Mm-hmm.

610
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:49,724
Figured you could
use the company.

611
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:51,793
Yeah, another Cobb salad
with those dipshits,

612
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:54,127
- I swear to God I'll eat a bullet.
- Language, Daddy.

613
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:56,229
Oh, "language, Daddy."
Is that right?

614
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:57,765
Nineteen years
you've been on this job,

615
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,333
this is the first time
I've been in your office.

616
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:00,702
Yeah, the last one

617
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:02,269
wasn't exactly
a daycare, was it?

618
00:35:02,302 --> 00:35:04,371
Neither was Max's Taphouse.

619
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:07,875
Tell you what,
why don't we get outta here, huh?

620
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:09,611
- Why don't we go somewhere special?
- Get some ice cream.

621
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:13,213
Ice cream for lunch?
No, no, no, no, no.

622
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:14,816
She's gonna have ice cream for
lunch, come on, let's go.

623
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:16,383
I'm having ice cream
for lunch?

624
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:17,518
Yeah, you are,
only if you behave.

625
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:18,686
Yeah, we'll see about that.

626
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,354
You watch that mouth, girl.

627
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:21,556
Come on, let's go.

628
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,325
Look at that.
What do you think? Huh?

629
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,261
Edie, look, they got nurse sharks.
Go check 'em out.

630
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:30,364
Oh, my God. Go on, honey.

631
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:32,700
I think they're sleeping.

632
00:35:34,535 --> 00:35:35,637
You checking up on me?

633
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:39,641
Yeah, I am.
You okay with that?

634
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:44,344
Oh, my gosh.
Babe, look. Check it out.

635
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:45,947
Did you go to the school?

636
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,784
I did. Forest Hills,
babe, it's amazing.

637
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:52,520
Classes are all small,

638
00:35:52,553 --> 00:35:54,287
and the teachers
all specialize

639
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,923
in overcoming
learning challenges.

640
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:59,259
- Okay.
- It's... it's great.

641
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:01,562
Hey, baby, honey,
don't tap on the glass.

642
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:04,364
She saw a little boy
her age who had built a robot.

643
00:36:04,398 --> 00:36:06,534
A walking, talking robot.
It was...

644
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:07,602
How much?

645
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,370
Did they say?
Did you talk about it?

646
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:11,606
- Yeah.
- How much?

647
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:13,407
Forty.

648
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:15,375
Fuck.

649
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:20,213
I told them you were in law
enforcement and that I am a nurse,

650
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:22,717
and they have scholarships
and she's eligible for those.

651
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,484
So we're gonna go for it.

652
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,453
- They said that?
- Yeah.

653
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:27,755
- Really?
- Yeah.

654
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:31,592
Hey, come on, look at her.
Look at that little...

655
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:34,796
I mean, how do they not give
her a full scholarship, huh?

656
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:36,597
Mm.

657
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:38,231
- Huh?
- Yeah.

658
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:40,200
And you think
this is the way to go, huh?

659
00:36:40,768 --> 00:36:41,836
This is good for her.

660
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:45,606
I need you
to get on board, okay?

661
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,243
You with us?

662
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:53,881
When am I not with you, huh?

663
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,416
Hmm?

664
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:09,797
It'll never go in. Yeah!

665
00:37:09,831 --> 00:37:11,999
You suck.
Doesn't he suck? He sucks.

666
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,433
No, you're jealous.

667
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:14,569
Constantly.

668
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,505
Well, your phone is blowing up.

669
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:19,507
Are you sure you don't
want to check you phone?

670
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,008
- Don't you want to check your phone?
- Don't sabotage.

671
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:22,577
- I know you do.
- Don't sabotage.

672
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,878
Wait, now, seriously, dude,

673
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:26,346
you have like
50 unread messages.

674
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,417
What the hell?

675
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:32,754
This says a 101.

676
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:34,756
You get hacked or something?

677
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,258
Three hundred
and thirteen new messages.

678
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:41,529
- From who?
- I don't know. I...

679
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:44,464
I had everything from Silk Road
forwarded to my Gmail.

680
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:45,633
Holy shit.

681
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:50,337
The Gawker article posted.
He wrote what you said, word for word.

682
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:53,941
Holy shit.

683
00:37:55,009 --> 00:37:56,844
1,154.

684
00:37:56,878 --> 00:37:58,846
That's gonna
crash your site, man.

685
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:03,017
Shit, you're right.

686
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:06,988
Okay, we gotta go.
Finish your beer.

687
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:09,090
No, actually, fuck your beer.
We gotta go.

688
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:10,958
- No, we got a full fucking pitcher, Ross.
- No, we got to go.

689
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:13,360
- We can't just...
- Hold on, I got this.

690
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:17,965
Grab your shit. Just leave...
leave the chip. Come on.

691
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:24,404
Bounced the local hosting?

692
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:26,941
Outsourced it
to a data center in Iceland.

693
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,510
Get fucked, NSA.

694
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:31,746
NSA?

695
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:36,517
I just made 75 grand in Bitcoin
in the last 90 minutes, babe.

696
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,554
Sooner or later
someone's gonna come knocking.

697
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:47,562
But now,
they can't trace my IP address.

698
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:51,999
Ross,
that's $833 a minute.

699
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:55,002
Go the other way.

700
00:38:58,072 --> 00:39:02,577
Holy shit,
1.2 million a day.

701
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,020
Fuck you.

702
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:21,863
<i>Neighbors, there is something
interesting going on right now.</i>

703
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:25,666
<i>What if I were to tell you
that there is a drug super store</i>

704
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,001
<i>on the Internet right now?</i>

705
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:31,672
<i>To all the new faces, welcome.</i>

706
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:35,142
<i>Our basic rules are to treat
others as you wish to be treated,</i>

707
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:39,479
<i>and don't do anything
to hurt or scam anyone else.</i>

708
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:40,781
<i>Something special
came in the mail.</i>

709
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:46,419
It looks and feels
exactly like eBay, Amazon,

710
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:49,557
whatever other online purchasing
site you're familiar with.

711
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:54,629
<i>Silk Road is already making
an impact on the war on drugs</i>

712
00:39:54,662 --> 00:39:58,833
<i>by expanding people's access
to controlled substances.</i>

713
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:03,037
<i>Every transaction
that takes place</i>

714
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,140
<i>outside the nexus of state
control is a victory.</i>

715
00:40:06,173 --> 00:40:09,877
<i>So there are literally hundreds
of victories here each week,</i>

716
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:12,847
<i>and each one weakens the state.</i>

717
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,918
<i>To learn more about libertarianism,
philosophy or just to make friends,</i>

718
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:18,786
<i>check out the forums.</i>

719
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:21,088
<i>Oh, and please,
contribute to the community</i>

720
00:40:21,122 --> 00:40:24,659
<i>by reviewing your sellers,
buyers and products.</i>

721
00:40:24,692 --> 00:40:26,961
<i>And you're not
paranoid about using the mail?</i>

722
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:31,098
No. They, like, vacuum seal it
so the dogs can't even smell it.

723
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:33,901
Like, seriously,
they've thought of everything.

724
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:36,771
- Whoa.
- Yeah. Game changer.

725
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:40,975
- Who runs it?
- I don't know, but the guy's pretty genius.

726
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:46,047
Genius.

727
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,015
Don't get ahead of yourself.

728
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:51,185
Their words.

729
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,691
Anybody else
from your outfit coming today?

730
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:58,559
Nope, they save
all the good stuff for me.

731
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:05,533
Okay. US Postal Service interdicts
narcotics by two primary means.

732
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:09,103
One is drug dogs, effective for large
shipments of controlled substances,

733
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:10,972
typically a kilo or more.

734
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:13,541
The other is random X-rays.

735
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:15,176
This is your
ounce or less crew.

736
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:17,111
This latter category,

737
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:19,647
we've noticed a 300% increase
in the past three months.

738
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,717
Lot of little stuff adds
up to the big stuff, right?

739
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,720
- Theoretically.
- So what do you think's driving the spike?

740
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:27,088
I don't know,
it's all small-time,

741
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:28,556
so they haven't given us
the resources

742
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:29,991
to figure it out yet.

743
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:31,726
Well, do they have
anything in common?

744
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:33,894
Actually, yes.

745
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:37,298
Everything they've seized out
of Utah has that stamped on it.

746
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:38,566
No shit.

747
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:29,183
Yo, Rayford, man, come on.
It's Bowden. Open the fuck up.

748
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:30,251
Motherfucker.

749
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:35,656
Oh, fuck.

750
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:39,994
Fuck that nigga right there.

751
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:46,033
Fuck.

752
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:47,968
You open
this motherfucking door,

753
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:50,104
you motherfucking piece of fuck!

754
00:42:53,374 --> 00:42:55,876
Fucking game, dude, huh?
You think this is fucking funny?

755
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,245
Come on,
why don't you ease it?

756
00:42:58,279 --> 00:43:01,382
Goddamn! Fuck, dude,
it smells dank in here.

757
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:03,784
You know, I'm gonna have you
note that that came anonymous...

758
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:05,953
Oh, what, you cooking up a
chicken with this oregano? Hmm.

759
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:08,956
No, that's from a customer.
I didn't pay for that. That's...

760
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:12,226
Yeah, I don't give a fuck
about your fucking chicken.

761
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:17,598
What else can you tell me about
this cat that sold you the 'shrooms?

762
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:20,835
Uh, goes by the name
of Chronic Pain.

763
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:22,036
Yeah, and what else?
Come on.

764
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,872
- That's it.
- Come on, dude, help me out.

765
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:27,875
I got an envelope postmarked Utah.
I got no return address.

766
00:43:27,908 --> 00:43:29,376
Utah's a big-ass state.

767
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:33,080
What else can you tell me about him?
Something? Chronic Pain?

768
00:43:33,114 --> 00:43:36,050
Well, hold on.
What makes you think it's a him?

769
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:40,654
You ever seen this movie called
<i>Cocaine Cowboys?</i> It was a documentary.

770
00:43:40,688 --> 00:43:44,058
And the baddest motherfucker in that
was a bitch named the Black Widow.

771
00:43:44,492 --> 00:43:46,894
She was drilling holes
in motherfuckers...

772
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:49,263
What the fuck has this got to do
with what I'm asking you about?

773
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:52,199
I'm just saying. A nigga can be
whoever they want on the Internet.

774
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:56,003
Whoever they want.

775
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:07,448
You know what people do with cats?

776
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:09,950
They just let them
live in their fucking house.

777
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:12,786
They don't even
actually interact, like, ever.

778
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,091
They're like, "Oh, look at all my cats.
I keep them alive."

779
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:20,861
You and I, we, like,
actually hang out.

780
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:28,435
Imagine a baby,
but it's tall, it's cute.

781
00:44:29,504 --> 00:44:33,340
But it's intimidating,
it is the size of a basketball hoop

782
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:36,243
and it's asking for its pacifier.

783
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:40,147
And it could crush you,

784
00:44:40,181 --> 00:44:42,249
but it's asking
for a cracker or something.

785
00:44:44,218 --> 00:44:46,787
You're the man now, dawg.

786
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:53,227
What was the movie where
James Bond was the guy with the blind kid?

787
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,862
That was a good movie.

788
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:09,877
Why don't you come to bed?

789
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,011
Listen to this.

790
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:15,282
"Fish scale Colombian cocaine."

791
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:20,454
"Has a nice sheen and provides a rush
of euphoria and confidence."

792
00:45:21,822 --> 00:45:22,890
Now this one.

793
00:45:23,658 --> 00:45:28,996
"Crystal MDMA.
Has a lovely fizz and a wisp of smoke."

794
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:32,166
You've got issues.

795
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:34,134
I think I just solved them.

796
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:37,838
This guy is a one-man fan club.

797
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:41,141
That's not what I meant.
You're getting obsessive.

798
00:45:41,175 --> 00:45:42,943
I think you mean obsessed.

799
00:45:42,977 --> 00:45:44,011
You know what I meant.

800
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,214
I'll be in bed.

801
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:57,458
Oh, that's not where we're
going with our teeth, baby.

802
00:45:57,891 --> 00:46:01,061
We're not going down there, going up here.

803
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,231
Oh, hold up.

804
00:46:04,265 --> 00:46:06,200
"Your work
has not gone unnoticed.

805
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:07,868
Wanna offer you a job."

806
00:46:07,901 --> 00:46:09,103
What?

807
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:13,207
Uh, okay.

808
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:17,278
What do I have to do?

809
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:19,446
What? You gotta get up.

810
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,249
This is getting interesting.
You're gonna miss this, come here.

811
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:25,319
"Review products.
Manage orders. Get rich."

812
00:46:25,352 --> 00:46:26,920
"Get rich"?

813
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:29,890
I'm in, brother.

814
00:46:32,092 --> 00:46:35,429
"Send scan of your ID"?

815
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:37,898
Yeah, what do you think of that?
What should we tell him?

816
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:41,068
To kiss our dimply ass?

817
00:46:42,102 --> 00:46:47,007
"Why do you need my ID
when I don't know who you are?"

818
00:46:49,511 --> 00:46:51,546
Nice try, jokester.

819
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:58,419
Oh! Underboss, bitches!

820
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:01,121
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

821
00:47:01,155 --> 00:47:07,094
Yes.
I'm just gonna roll the die

822
00:47:07,127 --> 00:47:08,996
and hope I don't die.

823
00:47:11,198 --> 00:47:14,468
You support this, right?
You wanna be an underboss, right?

824
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:18,272
You don't wanna be a fucking
ferret your whole life.

825
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,983
I need a name. I need a name.
I need a name.

826
00:47:32,286 --> 00:47:34,522
"Then David came to Nob..."

827
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:39,126
Nob it is for me.

828
00:47:40,494 --> 00:47:41,962
Daddy?

829
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:45,667
Oh, hey, peanut,
what are you doing up? Huh?

830
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,135
Where's Mom?

831
00:47:49,002 --> 00:47:50,538
Asleep on the couch.

832
00:47:50,572 --> 00:47:52,640
Oh.
She must be fucking drunk.

833
00:47:53,974 --> 00:47:55,042
You wanna help me?

834
00:47:55,744 --> 00:47:57,612
Take a picture of me?
Do that?

835
00:48:00,515 --> 00:48:02,383
Right there we go, just...

836
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:05,185
Up here, honey.
Up here, yeah?

837
00:48:05,986 --> 00:48:07,087
Smile, Dada.

838
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:09,056
No, no smile, I'm a bad guy.

839
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:10,958
Just pretending to be a bad
guy, but I'm a bad guy.

840
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:13,528
Bad guys
wear their hoodies up.

841
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:19,199
You got a point. All right.
Well spotted, honey. How's that?

842
00:48:22,136 --> 00:48:25,305
- Got it.
- Got it, yes, you did. Bingo.

843
00:48:25,774 --> 00:48:28,208
Off you go, okay?
Thanks for helping.

844
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:30,344
Little things, Dada,
make you believe.

845
00:48:30,377 --> 00:48:33,648
Little things. Yeah, well,
one more little thing, okay? Honey?

846
00:48:34,516 --> 00:48:36,684
This is between you and me, okay?
Don't tell Mom.

847
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:44,592
Up you go.

848
00:48:47,027 --> 00:48:48,962
Fuck. Okay.

849
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:10,083
- <i>Yo.</i>
- Yeah, dude, it's me.

850
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,019
<i>Stop calling me
all the time, man.</i>

851
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:13,588
How do I get the picture
from the camera

852
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:15,355
to the fucking computer, man?

853
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:52,527
Oh, here we go.
We're up. Thanks.

854
00:49:54,629 --> 00:49:55,763
Yeah.

855
00:50:02,236 --> 00:50:06,139
Tonight our Call-6 investigators dig
into what's known as The Dark Net.

856
00:50:06,908 --> 00:50:09,744
It's been called
eBay for illegal drugs.

857
00:50:09,777 --> 00:50:12,246
A network
of relatively hidden websites

858
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:15,315
where users can buy everything
from ecstasy to opium.

859
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:18,620
<i>The Silk Road website is
a particular headache for authorities.</i>

860
00:50:18,653 --> 00:50:21,421
<i>The government says
hundreds of thousands of users</i>

861
00:50:21,455 --> 00:50:24,659
<i>use the impossible-to-trace
website which sells drugs.</i>

862
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:29,129
<i>We're talking about cocaine,
LSD, ecstasy. You name it and it's here.</i>

863
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:31,566
Someone that is wanting
to sell illegal drugs

864
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,268
can use this to come in contact with
someone that wants to buy illegal drugs.

865
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:38,238
What do you think?

866
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:43,110
Oh, my God, Ross,
this is really serious.

867
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:46,814
<i>An underground website
used to sell illegal drugs</i>

868
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:49,383
<i>is the new target for New York
senator, Charles Schumer.</i>

869
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:52,654
<i>He has asked federal authorities to
shut down and investigate the site.</i>

870
00:50:52,687 --> 00:50:55,523
<i>It's known as Silk Road.</i>

871
00:50:55,557 --> 00:51:01,194
<i>This website is nothing more than an
all-you-can-order buffet of contraband</i>

872
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:03,531
<i>that needs to be shut down
immediately.</i>

873
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:06,601
Are you scared?

874
00:51:09,637 --> 00:51:10,672
Yeah.

875
00:51:13,908 --> 00:51:15,208
Yeah.

876
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:18,613
Hey, you got
a call from the FBI.

877
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:20,480
Putting together
an inter-agency task force

878
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:22,884
- on some online dope bazaar.
- What, Silk Road?

879
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:25,152
- Yeah.
- No, we're already on it. Who's running point?

880
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:27,487
A guy called Tarbell.
Sounds like a real gunner.

881
00:51:27,522 --> 00:51:30,725
He's just looking for a token narc
to qualify for OCDETF funding.

882
00:51:30,758 --> 00:51:32,259
You got somebody we can spare?

883
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:34,294
No fucking way,
I got my A-Team on this.

884
00:51:34,328 --> 00:51:36,496
FBI'll just steal our work
claiming credit.

885
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:39,366
Shields, I can't say no to an
inter-departmental request, okay?

886
00:51:39,399 --> 00:51:41,603
Look, personally,
I don't give a fuck who you send,

887
00:51:41,636 --> 00:51:43,337
long as they got a badge
and a heartbeat.

888
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:46,841
Fuck.

889
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:51,713
Jesus fucking Christ.

890
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:55,550
Oh, Jesus.

891
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:57,351
- Bowden?
- Yeah.

892
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,189
Oh, hang on. What?

893
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:05,492
Are you
familiar with Silk Road?

894
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:06,694
Yeah.

895
00:52:06,728 --> 00:52:08,128
- Really?
- Yeah.

896
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:10,230
What the fuck, it's a website.

897
00:52:10,263 --> 00:52:11,699
They sell dope and shit
on the net.

898
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,236
Perfect. The FBI's putting
together a task force.

899
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:18,438
There's a briefing at the
Federal Building at 1100.

900
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:20,842
Report to Agent Tarbell.
You'll love him.

901
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:23,377
- Okay. Hey, Shields?
- Yep?

902
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,747
Is there any way to track
dope busts in the mail?

903
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:28,248
You know, small shit,
ounce or less.

904
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:30,618
Yeah, I'll have Sirkis
set up a geofence.

905
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:33,554
They'll notify you whenever the local
postal interdiction police gets a pop.

906
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:36,156
- Geofence? Good.
- Yeah.

907
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:38,258
Why?

908
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:41,261
No reason, you know,
I might have an idea

909
00:52:41,294 --> 00:52:43,430
to crack
this Silk Road shit wide open.

910
00:52:43,463 --> 00:52:45,232
- Rick?
- Yeah.

911
00:52:45,265 --> 00:52:47,300
I've got a next-level team
on this, okay?

912
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:49,269
And I don't need some old-school
street crap buggering it up.

913
00:52:49,971 --> 00:52:52,439
Report to the task force,
keep your trap shut,

914
00:52:52,472 --> 00:52:53,841
and don't make us look stupid.

915
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:01,949
As the NSA puts it,
with 2.5 million daily users,

916
00:53:01,983 --> 00:53:07,689
Tor's the king of high-security,
low-latency Internet anonymity.

917
00:53:07,722 --> 00:53:09,824
You're aware, boss,
that given the volume of users,

918
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:12,827
the odds of finding a single IP
address are almost impossible?

919
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,327
I was hoping
you'd say that, Kim.

920
00:53:19,534 --> 00:53:22,904
What you got there
is five grams of cupronickel.

921
00:53:23,336 --> 00:53:27,909
75% copper, 25% nickel.
Worth five American cents.

922
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:29,577
What the hell
happened to it?

923
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,813
I got this brother-in-law
in West Texas,

924
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:33,413
married to my kid sister.

925
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:35,650
Seven kids between them.

926
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:39,854
Now I'm not saying for certain,
there's an extra chromosome involved,

927
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:41,823
but this guy is not gonna win
any MacArthur Grants.

928
00:53:41,856 --> 00:53:43,558
Do you know what I'm saying?

929
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:45,927
And until last Tuesday,
he might have been

930
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,762
the unluckiest man
in America.

931
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:49,897
Well, what happened Tuesday?

932
00:53:51,498 --> 00:53:55,937
He got hit by lightning...
for a second time.

933
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,538
Did it kill him?

934
00:53:57,572 --> 00:53:58,606
No.

935
00:54:00,474 --> 00:54:02,543
He had that nickel
in his pocket, though.

936
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:06,279
The electrical current burned
a hole in his dungarees,

937
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:07,849
seared through
his testicular wall

938
00:54:07,882 --> 00:54:09,784
and cauterized
his vas deferens.

939
00:54:12,754 --> 00:54:13,988
God's own vasectomy.

940
00:54:16,524 --> 00:54:18,826
The odds of that happening?
One in 25 million.

941
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,695
My point being, Kim...

942
00:54:20,728 --> 00:54:22,663
...nothing's impossible.

943
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:26,834
Fantastic. I see the DEA sent
its best and its brightest.

944
00:54:26,868 --> 00:54:29,036
Uh, welcome to the task force,
Mr. Flintstone?

945
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,506
No, Bowden, Rick Bowden, DEA.
Hey, guys.

946
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:33,608
Chris Tarbell, FBI.
Have a seat, please.

947
00:54:33,641 --> 00:54:35,610
Sorry, I'm late, man,
I just got fucking caught up in here.

948
00:54:36,343 --> 00:54:38,278
Sure you did. Okay.

949
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:40,648
Are we working
any human sources?

950
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:41,883
- No.
- No?

951
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:43,584
Sorry, what was that?

952
00:54:43,618 --> 00:54:46,386
Did you...
did you need something there?

953
00:54:46,419 --> 00:54:49,690
No. I just, uh, wondered if
we're working any human sources?

954
00:54:51,025 --> 00:54:52,059
Negative.

955
00:54:52,593 --> 00:54:54,394
Well, you mean not yet, huh?

956
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:58,599
No, I mean, I'm just not really
into wasting resources, sport.

957
00:54:58,633 --> 00:55:02,435
We're not tailing guys here.
We're hunting IP addresses.

958
00:55:05,907 --> 00:55:07,440
I mean, fuck, somebody
some where's

959
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,409
touching the keyboards, right?

960
00:55:09,442 --> 00:55:11,512
Wait a minute,
are you gonna crack this?

961
00:55:11,546 --> 00:55:13,915
You can just crack it the
old-fashioned way, Agent Bowden?

962
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:15,550
Maybe.

963
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:16,984
That's fantastic.
I'll tell you what,

964
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:19,921
when you snatch him up,
send me a fax.

965
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,487
Ross.

966
00:57:03,591 --> 00:57:05,626
Ross, we need
to have a conversation.

967
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,794
Just one sec.

968
00:57:07,528 --> 00:57:08,629
Pay attention to me.

969
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:12,066
- I am.
- Look, this is on the Silk Road homepage.

970
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:18,906
Crack, crystal meth. You're making money
off of drug addicts and poor people.

971
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:24,477
Julia, look, the average Silk
Road user is college educated,

972
00:57:24,512 --> 00:57:26,948
has a laptop
and has access to broadband.

973
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:29,150
More than that,
there are seller reviews.

974
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:33,220
Baby, buying drugs off of my site is
safer than buying 'em on the street.

975
00:57:33,254 --> 00:57:34,789
Give me a break, Ross.

976
00:57:34,822 --> 00:57:36,624
You might not
understand this.

977
00:57:36,657 --> 00:57:40,561
This is my community
and I care about it.

978
00:57:48,836 --> 00:57:49,937
Wait.

979
00:58:10,558 --> 00:58:11,592
Zoom right here.

980
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:13,861
Third one this week.

981
00:58:14,462 --> 00:58:17,031
It's hardly worth the paperwork
for a little marijuana.

982
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:20,735
It's about
the right amount, though.

983
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:33,681
Fucking meth?
Jesus Christ.

984
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:46,827
Come on,
I saw you, you fucking bitch.

985
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:17,758
Hey. Where you been?

986
00:59:18,626 --> 00:59:19,660
Out.

987
00:59:24,632 --> 00:59:25,699
Hey.

988
00:59:28,135 --> 00:59:29,170
I'm sorry.

989
00:59:30,738 --> 00:59:33,741
Sorry that
I've been distant...

990
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:37,812
and I've been
a little obsessed.

991
00:59:37,845 --> 00:59:38,913
You're right.

992
00:59:41,148 --> 00:59:43,284
And obsessive.
Both are correct, actually.

993
00:59:47,321 --> 00:59:48,823
You're such a dick.

994
01:00:00,668 --> 01:00:02,269
I got something else
to tell you.

995
01:00:04,238 --> 01:00:05,306
What?

996
01:00:06,874 --> 01:00:11,345
I got a new name...
for my admin.

997
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:14,682
The Dread Pirate Roberts.

998
01:00:19,053 --> 01:00:21,856
<i>Princess Bride.</i>
You fucking kidding me?

999
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:23,891
No.

1000
01:00:24,425 --> 01:00:26,293
Julia, it's brilliant.

1001
01:00:26,327 --> 01:00:28,195
Look, that way,
I can pass it along to somebody else.

1002
01:00:28,229 --> 01:00:30,131
This thing is gonna
outlive all of us.

1003
01:00:30,965 --> 01:00:34,668
This isn't a movie, Ross.
I'm gonna go to bed.

1004
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:40,341
<i>♪ As you wish ♪</i>

1005
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:51,418
Where have you been?

1006
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:54,288
Edie waited up.

1007
01:00:55,055 --> 01:00:57,758
Yeah, I was at work.
I was working.

1008
01:00:57,791 --> 01:00:59,894
What's going on here, huh?
Are you drunk?

1009
01:01:00,361 --> 01:01:02,196
- Are you?
- Yeah. No, I'm...

1010
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:04,832
No,
I'm fucking working, I said. Huh?

1011
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:05,933
Hmm.

1012
01:01:07,368 --> 01:01:11,238
I'm hunting, baby. I'm hunting big game.
I mean, seriously, Sandy.

1013
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:13,707
Like kingpin shit.

1014
01:01:13,741 --> 01:01:16,877
Yeah, I mean, this guy's gotta be...
You know, he's got these...

1015
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:19,480
He's like
the first millennial gangster.

1016
01:01:19,514 --> 01:01:21,315
Yeah, it's the future
of drug trafficking,

1017
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:23,951
I'm telling ya.
I ain't seen nothing like it.

1018
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:26,287
All these other young bucks, they think
I'm some kind of old fucking dinosaur.

1019
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,022
They're doing
their digital downloads.

1020
01:01:28,055 --> 01:01:29,924
But I'm the one
with these fucking hooks in.

1021
01:01:29,957 --> 01:01:32,426
I'm the one who's gonna bring
this fucking prick down.

1022
01:01:33,427 --> 01:01:36,797
This is exactly how you
sounded before Puerto Rico.

1023
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:39,300
No, it's not how it was like
in Puerto Rico.

1024
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:41,202
- It's different?
- Yeah, completely different.

1025
01:01:41,235 --> 01:01:42,269
- Is it?
- Yeah.

1026
01:01:42,303 --> 01:01:43,337
Is it, Rick? Really?

1027
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:44,838
What's going on in Utah?

1028
01:01:45,906 --> 01:01:48,042
What the... What?

1029
01:01:48,075 --> 01:01:49,910
- What?
- Yeah. What?

1030
01:01:49,944 --> 01:01:52,012
I get the same high-purchase
alerts you do, okay?

1031
01:01:52,046 --> 01:01:54,982
Tell me what the fuck
is going on in Utah.

1032
01:01:57,451 --> 01:02:00,254
Cyber conference. Yeah.

1033
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:02,156
- It's a cyber conference? Okay.
- Yeah.

1034
01:02:02,189 --> 01:02:03,857
- And you're paying for it?
- No.

1035
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:05,059
They haven't
requisitioned the money yet.

1036
01:02:05,092 --> 01:02:06,193
They'll pay me back.

1037
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,198
You know, the thing
about being married to a narc

1038
01:02:11,232 --> 01:02:14,235
is that you never know
when they're lying to you.

1039
01:02:17,572 --> 01:02:18,973
Let's go. Engage.

1040
01:02:25,879 --> 01:02:27,948
"Weird Al" Yankovic.

1041
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:29,483
Let's go.

1042
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,803
Get under there! Get the fucking...

1043
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:52,172
- Hands where I can see them!
- Don't fucking move!

1044
01:02:52,206 --> 01:02:54,275
- Down now!
- Down on the fucking ground!

1045
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:58,312
- What? You fucking deaf? Huh? You what? Huh?
- I can help.

1046
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:00,347
- I can tell you anything you want to know.
- Huh? Yeah?

1047
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:03,217
Thought he was gonna win
the fucking penalty shoot, yeah?

1048
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,252
Well, no, you don't fucking know.
What do you got here?

1049
01:03:05,286 --> 01:03:07,488
- What is this? Is this your fanny pack?
- Yeah.

1050
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:11,425
A fucking fanny pack?
Dude, your mother know about this? Huh?

1051
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:15,796
Huh?

1052
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:17,565
Whoa!

1053
01:03:18,232 --> 01:03:20,367
- Yeah!
- It's... I... It's for my taxes.

1054
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:22,102
Fat, fucking roll, dude.

1055
01:03:22,136 --> 01:03:23,971
I don't like bank...
I don't trust banks.

1056
01:03:24,506 --> 01:03:26,440
Fucking hook this prick up
and voucher this.

1057
01:03:30,077 --> 01:03:32,846
Clean your fucking ears out.
What did I say?

1058
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,049
I said go take a sketch of the
premises and then report back to me.

1059
01:03:36,283 --> 01:03:37,418
You boys got a light?

1060
01:03:45,225 --> 01:03:47,194
Where the fuck do they find these guys?
I swear to God.

1061
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:49,363
Well, probably
a fucking vegetarian.

1062
01:03:54,201 --> 01:03:56,203
You know,
swear to fucking God, dude.

1063
01:03:57,672 --> 01:03:59,340
This whole job's changed.

1064
01:04:00,608 --> 01:04:03,645
Well, we certainly can't get
shit done the way we used to.

1065
01:04:03,678 --> 01:04:05,179
Fucking A.

1066
01:04:09,651 --> 01:04:11,218
Don't know about you,
but I don't have

1067
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:13,555
the fucking patience
for this bullshit.

1068
01:04:13,588 --> 01:04:16,223
Flung out the paperwork and that.
You know what I'm saying?

1069
01:04:17,257 --> 01:04:19,126
No. What are you saying?

1070
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:21,095
I'm saying I can take it
from here if you want.

1071
01:04:23,063 --> 01:04:24,231
Is it gonna
come back on me?

1072
01:04:25,466 --> 01:04:27,201
Do I look like a vegetarian?

1073
01:05:02,537 --> 01:05:05,038
Where the fuck
are you, Curtis?

1074
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,043
- Hey.
- Hey.

1075
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:12,680
- Have you eaten anything?
- I'm fine.

1076
01:05:15,717 --> 01:05:17,552
- You know, I'm starting to get a little...
- Don't!

1077
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:20,588
I'm sorry.

1078
01:05:23,023 --> 01:05:24,559
I'm really sorry. I...

1079
01:05:25,426 --> 01:05:27,995
Look, I am running
a $50 million company,

1080
01:05:28,028 --> 01:05:29,731
operating in
17 different countries

1081
01:05:29,764 --> 01:05:31,398
with exactly one employee

1082
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:33,100
who just dropped off
the face of the Earth.

1083
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:35,469
It's just a website, Ross!

1084
01:05:40,207 --> 01:05:41,475
It's the thing.

1085
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:45,613
And you would know that,
except you've never done anything.

1086
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:56,423
I'm gonna go for a run.

1087
01:05:56,957 --> 01:06:00,194
And when I come back,
I want you and all your shit out of here.

1088
01:06:00,227 --> 01:06:01,596
You hear me?

1089
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:15,042
<i>Please, sir,
this guy we're dealing with,</i>

1090
01:06:15,075 --> 01:06:20,314
he's got unlimited resources
and he's unpredictable...

1091
01:06:20,347 --> 01:06:22,717
I'm gonna break your fucking
nose, and I'm gonna do it.

1092
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,385
He's... I can tell you
whatever the fuck you...

1093
01:06:25,419 --> 01:06:28,088
I'll write a term paper,
for fuck's sake!

1094
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:29,657
- Money.
- The money.

1095
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:32,125
I know all about
how the money works.

1096
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:33,695
- So?
- Okay.

1097
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:36,196
There's Bitcoin.
Are you familiar with Bitcoin?

1098
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,799
Bitcoin?

1099
01:06:37,832 --> 01:06:40,300
- Don't be a fucking cunt, Curtis.
- Oh, fuck!

1100
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:43,203
Don't be a cunt, Curtis.
Don't be a fucking cunt, dude.

1101
01:06:43,237 --> 01:06:45,472
- Don't be a fucking cunt, okay?
- Okay, no cunt.

1102
01:06:45,507 --> 01:06:47,040
You fat fucking cunt!

1103
01:06:47,074 --> 01:06:48,442
Can't fucking...

1104
01:06:48,475 --> 01:06:51,178
So, you know Bitcoin.

1105
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:57,084
And there's some people use
Bitcoin to transfer money.

1106
01:06:57,117 --> 01:06:59,052
They make transactions.

1107
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:02,690
Those transactions on Silk Road
get put into an escrow account

1108
01:07:02,724 --> 01:07:06,661
and then stays there until
both parties have signed off.

1109
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:08,530
So nobody gets ripped off.

1110
01:07:08,563 --> 01:07:12,534
- That, and there's a ratings-based system.
- Yeah.

1111
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:17,371
The customer service and dependability,
reliability, it's all a big part of it.

1112
01:07:17,404 --> 01:07:20,307
Skip the corporate bullshit, okay?
You're no global conglomerate, so...

1113
01:07:22,276 --> 01:07:26,648
See, we are, though.
We are a global enterprise.

1114
01:07:27,749 --> 01:07:29,449
And it's growing.

1115
01:07:29,483 --> 01:07:31,619
Not growing by the week
or the month,

1116
01:07:31,653 --> 01:07:33,420
it's growing by the hour.

1117
01:07:33,453 --> 01:07:36,824
And at the crest of it
is fucking DPR and he's...

1118
01:07:36,858 --> 01:07:38,425
He's a visionary.

1119
01:07:40,595 --> 01:07:42,062
No shit.

1120
01:07:42,897 --> 01:07:44,532
And what are you?
An apostle?

1121
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:47,635
In pink fucking socks
and Crocs, dude?

1122
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:50,838
I'm the one...

1123
01:07:50,872 --> 01:07:53,741
I may look like
a fucking idiot to you,

1124
01:07:53,775 --> 01:07:56,476
but I am the one who has access
to the escrow account.

1125
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:01,214
Fucking holding out on me,
dude.

1126
01:08:02,617 --> 01:08:04,384
- Okay.
- No, I'll tell you anything.

1127
01:08:04,418 --> 01:08:05,787
You're gonna prove it
is what you're gonna do.

1128
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,421
I'll prove anything.
How?

1129
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:11,491
Wire me the Bitcoin.

1130
01:08:15,597 --> 01:08:17,665
That's...
That's not how it...

1131
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:19,333
That is how it works,
but it's not how it works.

1132
01:08:19,366 --> 01:08:21,234
Well, what are you
gonna do with the...

1133
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:24,839
Gonna mark it Exhibit A in
the case against your boss.

1134
01:08:24,872 --> 01:08:26,340
Oh.

1135
01:08:26,874 --> 01:08:30,645
Okay. I appreciate what you're
doing, but this is...

1136
01:08:31,345 --> 01:08:35,482
It's like $200,000 or
something in the account.

1137
01:08:35,516 --> 01:08:37,417
He could kill me
for that type of money.

1138
01:08:40,588 --> 01:08:41,623
Really?

1139
01:08:44,324 --> 01:08:45,560
What?

1140
01:08:51,431 --> 01:08:52,600
What the fuck?

1141
01:09:06,346 --> 01:09:08,916
What the fuck are you doing
with my money, Curtis?

1142
01:09:13,755 --> 01:09:16,223
Got you,
you son of a bitch.

1143
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:24,532
Hey, Max!
Your parents still in Aspen?

1144
01:09:24,565 --> 01:09:26,266
- Holy shit!
- Hey, man.

1145
01:09:26,299 --> 01:09:28,569
The prodigal son returns.

1146
01:09:28,603 --> 01:09:30,838
- Yeah.
- Yes, it has been a while.

1147
01:09:30,872 --> 01:09:33,240
Yup, it's been
six weeks, dude.

1148
01:09:34,942 --> 01:09:39,547
Hey, uh, look,
I got a favor to ask you.

1149
01:09:40,213 --> 01:09:43,450
If I give you someone's ID, can you
look up if they've been arrested or not?

1150
01:09:44,451 --> 01:09:47,755
Why do you always come to me
with this shit, Ross?

1151
01:09:48,488 --> 01:09:50,357
'Cause you're my best friend.

1152
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:57,699
What's their name?

1153
01:09:59,567 --> 01:10:01,903
Uh, Curtis Clark Green.

1154
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:04,972
Out of Spanish Fork, Utah.

1155
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:12,747
You, uh...
You having a party?

1156
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,248
If you'd read any of my texts
for the last six weeks,

1157
01:10:15,282 --> 01:10:17,952
you'd know
I'm moving to New York.

1158
01:10:17,985 --> 01:10:19,219
Surprise!

1159
01:10:24,491 --> 01:10:25,960
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1160
01:10:32,466 --> 01:10:34,401
Okay, that's weird.

1161
01:10:34,434 --> 01:10:37,839
There's a report for his arrest
in Spanish Fork, Utah,

1162
01:10:37,872 --> 01:10:40,942
but, for some reason,
he was never charged.

1163
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,645
Weird-looking dude.

1164
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,981
Shit.

1165
01:10:54,622 --> 01:10:55,923
Shit.

1166
01:10:57,859 --> 01:10:59,961
You know,
Julia warned you about this.

1167
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:01,929
- Fuck!
- We both did.

1168
01:11:17,444 --> 01:11:20,413
"Got a problem in Utah.
Requires violence. Can you help?"

1169
01:11:21,682 --> 01:11:24,719
Yes, we can.

1170
01:11:26,419 --> 01:11:27,755
Uh...

1171
01:11:36,898 --> 01:11:38,666
Hey, Julia.

1172
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:40,635
- Julia, look, just talk to me. Just talk!
- No!

1173
01:11:40,668 --> 01:11:43,538
You're selling assault rifles
on your fucking site, Ross.

1174
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:49,010
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
It's the Second Amendment.

1175
01:11:49,744 --> 01:11:53,380
When you said that you were
gonna change the world, I just...

1176
01:11:54,782 --> 01:11:56,651
I wanted to believe
that it was for the better.

1177
01:11:56,684 --> 01:11:59,020
- That's not fair.
- Okay.

1178
01:11:59,053 --> 01:12:01,488
That's not...
Julia, just listen.

1179
01:12:01,522 --> 01:12:03,591
- Leave me alone, Ross.
- Listen to me.

1180
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:05,560
You heard her, asshole.

1181
01:12:05,593 --> 01:12:06,761
Fuck off.

1182
01:12:11,632 --> 01:12:14,669
That's nice. That's nice.

1183
01:12:19,607 --> 01:12:21,909
Here. Thank you.

1184
01:12:21,943 --> 01:12:23,443
Will you get me a shot?

1185
01:12:23,476 --> 01:12:25,112
- Anything for you.
- Yeah.

1186
01:12:25,146 --> 01:12:27,582
- Hey. You're too good for him anyway.
- Yeah.

1187
01:13:14,494 --> 01:13:18,165
Huh? Huh?

1188
01:13:20,768 --> 01:13:24,205
- Fuck, Bowden, you dumb fuck!
- Ah!

1189
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:26,207
Shit didn't even record.

1190
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,943
I did what you asked me to do.
I transferred the money!

1191
01:13:28,976 --> 01:13:30,912
Why the fuck
are you doing this?

1192
01:13:30,945 --> 01:13:34,115
Because, my friend,
if we pin some bullshit narcotics beef

1193
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:36,217
on your fucking pirate boss,

1194
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:39,687
he's gonna post bail, walk free
and wanna chase up loose ends.

1195
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:42,223
And we know who that is.
On the other hand,

1196
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:45,559
if we get him on a conspiracy
to commit murder and kidnapping,

1197
01:13:45,593 --> 01:13:47,528
well, that's 25 years to life.

1198
01:13:47,561 --> 01:13:50,197
- What? What, murder?
- Nice, dude, here we go.

1199
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:53,734
- Why did you say murder? No!
- That's what I fucking said, dude. Here, come on.

1200
01:13:53,768 --> 01:13:55,069
Get the fuck up.

1201
01:15:09,577 --> 01:15:13,114
Damn, Curtis, your boss just caught a bullet train

1202
01:15:13,147 --> 01:15:14,782
to the fucking pen, dude.

1203
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,250
Look at this.

1204
01:15:16,283 --> 01:15:18,552
"Change the order
from torture to kill."

1205
01:15:20,087 --> 01:15:21,722
Fuck me, dude.

1206
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:25,726
What... what's that for?

1207
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,729
Huh? This is lunch.
You hungry?

1208
01:15:29,597 --> 01:15:31,065
Little piece of advice.

1209
01:15:31,499 --> 01:15:33,267
The asphyxiation victim,

1210
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,136
the bile looks exactly like
chicken noodle soup.

1211
01:15:35,169 --> 01:15:36,604
Open up.

1212
01:15:36,637 --> 01:15:37,838
What, should I just chew it?

1213
01:15:37,872 --> 01:15:39,607
Open up, dude, open up.

1214
01:15:41,042 --> 01:15:44,111
Here we go. You got it.
Keep it in.

1215
01:15:45,246 --> 01:15:47,148
Okay, don't choke on that.
Lie down.

1216
01:15:47,181 --> 01:15:49,884
Play dead.

1217
01:15:50,317 --> 01:15:52,920
Clean that up. I'll get that fucking
shit out of there, there you go.

1218
01:15:53,421 --> 01:15:55,256
Curtis,
just give me a second here.

1219
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:58,159
All right.

1220
01:15:59,693 --> 01:16:01,896
Come on, Curtis,
hold your breath, dude. Fuck!

1221
01:16:02,763 --> 01:16:04,832
Close your eyes. All right.

1222
01:16:04,865 --> 01:16:08,002
Oh, I love that dribbling out, it's nice.

1223
01:16:20,915 --> 01:16:24,218
Hey, you need a ride?
Yeah, you need a ride?

1224
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:26,587
Ross!

1225
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:11,265
Boom, motherfucker.

1226
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:28,983
- Hey.
- FBI cybercrimes has taken over the investigation.

1227
01:17:29,016 --> 01:17:31,385
Good. Hold the fucking phone.
I got the entire case right here.

1228
01:17:31,418 --> 01:17:33,220
Now, whatever it is,
turn it over to Tarbell.

1229
01:17:33,254 --> 01:17:35,022
No, hear me out.
You're gonna wanna see this.

1230
01:17:35,055 --> 01:17:36,290
- Trust me.
- No, I'm not. Not on the desk.

1231
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:37,958
- Not the desk.
- Come on, here.

1232
01:17:37,992 --> 01:17:39,827
- Listen, Rick...
- I got the guy dead to rights.

1233
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,428
- Hang on.
- Rick!

1234
01:17:41,462 --> 01:17:43,464
- It's just... Hang on.
- I don't have the time.

1235
01:17:43,497 --> 01:17:45,199
This department
doesn't have the money, okay,

1236
01:17:45,232 --> 01:17:46,767
to teach you
how law enforcement works

1237
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,068
in the 21st century.

1238
01:17:48,102 --> 01:17:49,403
So take your handwritten notes,

1239
01:17:49,436 --> 01:17:50,771
shove them in your Brownwell

1240
01:17:50,804 --> 01:17:52,173
and hand it over to Tarbell.

1241
01:17:52,206 --> 01:17:53,274
- Okay?
- Just... Come on.

1242
01:17:53,307 --> 01:17:54,742
Trust me. Look at this. Just...

1243
01:17:54,775 --> 01:17:55,809
I'll say it again.

1244
01:17:58,312 --> 01:17:59,780
Out!

1245
01:18:02,249 --> 01:18:05,186
Hey, it's Shields.
In Cybercrimes.

1246
01:18:06,787 --> 01:18:08,055
Yeah, get me Johnson.

1247
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:10,791
All right, well,
then get me Hanson.

1248
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:13,928
Get me anybody here, okay?

1249
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:18,799
<i>This is Seven News.</i>

1250
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:21,001
<i>Tonight, 16-year-old
Preston Bridge</i>

1251
01:18:21,035 --> 01:18:23,037
<i>was celebrating
after his school ball</i>

1252
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:25,873
<i>before he fell
from a second-floor balcony.</i>

1253
01:18:25,906 --> 01:18:28,709
<i>His family
still can't believe he's gone.</i>

1254
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:32,413
I would just actually love to have
seen what he turned out to be.

1255
01:18:33,214 --> 01:18:36,984
<i>The synthetic LSD that
killed Preston was bought online.</i>

1256
01:18:37,017 --> 01:18:39,987
<i>So potent,
it made him think he could fly.</i>

1257
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:43,424
<i>He fell from a balcony and
suffered horrific head injuries.</i>

1258

<i>The federal government...</i>

1259
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:50,264
- Hey.
- Hey.

1260
01:18:51,465 --> 01:18:53,267
- Mom and Dad called.
- Oh, yeah?

1261
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,102
Yeah, they were just
asking how you were.

1262
01:18:55,803 --> 01:18:56,937
What did you say?

1263
01:18:56,971 --> 01:18:58,105
That I love having you here.

1264
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:01,041
It's great to be here.

1265
01:19:03,277 --> 01:19:04,845
Why do you keep
closing your laptop

1266
01:19:04,878 --> 01:19:06,413
every time I walk by?

1267
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:08,382
I don't.

1268
01:19:08,816 --> 01:19:10,451
Yeah, Ross,
you do.

1269
01:19:11,752 --> 01:19:17,124
I guess I don't even notice it. It's just
force of habit, you know, sensitive data.

1270
01:19:17,157 --> 01:19:19,159
Wow, you look like Dad
when you lie.

1271
01:19:22,863 --> 01:19:25,132
Hey, whatever's going on,
you can tell me.

1272
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:32,306
Nothing's going on, Cally.

1273
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,242
All right, fine, you know,
you wanna bullshit me, whatever.

1274
01:19:35,276 --> 01:19:37,579
Just, uh, don't lie
to yourself, Ross,

1275
01:19:37,612 --> 01:19:39,480
'cause that's how you get lost.

1276
01:21:03,063 --> 01:21:04,431
Shh.

1277
01:21:08,168 --> 01:21:10,170
What's the matter?
Is she having a nightmare?

1278
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:13,173
- She didn't get the scholarship.
- What?

1279
01:21:13,207 --> 01:21:15,876
Why not? Didn't you
put the application in?

1280
01:21:16,443 --> 01:21:20,013
I put the application in. You didn't
show up to the fucking interview.

1281
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:23,050
Shit. Fuck.
Fuck, I forgot. Shit.

1282
01:21:24,051 --> 01:21:25,553
I didn't make it.

1283
01:21:25,587 --> 01:21:29,156
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, peanut. Hey.

1284
01:21:30,457 --> 01:21:32,159
Can I go anyway?

1285
01:21:33,961 --> 01:21:35,095
Go to sleep.

1286
01:21:54,982 --> 01:21:57,217
Damn it, homie. What the fuck
are you doing over here?

1287
01:21:57,251 --> 01:21:59,319
Don't get your panties in a twist.
I'm not staying, okay?

1288
01:22:00,655 --> 01:22:05,125
<i>Just... Listen,
how do I change it? Bitcoins.</i>

1289
01:22:05,593 --> 01:22:06,661
How do I...

1290
01:22:08,028 --> 01:22:09,329
Personal
or professional reasons?

1291
01:22:09,363 --> 01:22:10,565
Answer the question.

1292
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:15,703
<i>Yeah, you cross this fucking line,
Bowden, there ain't no going back, yo.</i>

1293
01:22:15,737 --> 01:22:17,971
<i>Look, I got it under
control, all right?</i>

1294
01:22:18,005 --> 01:22:19,641

the fucking money.</i>

<i>They're not gonna notice
when it's gone,</i>

1296
01:22:21,341 --> 01:22:23,977
so, just, please,
answer the question.

1297
01:22:24,612 --> 01:22:25,713
Give me a day.

1298
01:22:25,747 --> 01:22:27,080
For what?

1299
01:22:28,148 --> 01:22:30,652
To make it green,
motherfucker.

1300
01:22:30,685 --> 01:22:32,219
All right.

1301
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:38,992
You sure
about this shit, yo?

1302
01:22:39,026 --> 01:22:40,595
Just change it, okay?

1303
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:06,721
<i>There is a curtain of anonymity
in secrecy that covers everything</i>

1304
01:23:06,754 --> 01:23:09,490

behind the scenes here.</i>

1305
01:23:09,524 --> 01:23:13,728
<i>But I have to stay constantly on
the move to keep ahead of the state.</i>

1308
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:22,770
<i>The way I see it,
we are all players</i>

1309

1315
01:23:41,455 --> 01:23:44,526
<i>So, thanks for listening.</i>

1316
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:50,497
This guy's clearly self-taught.
Even though he fixed it,

1317
01:23:50,532 --> 01:23:53,601
we could read the previous version
underneath. Nice job, Kim. Okay.

1318
01:23:53,635 --> 01:23:55,402
Goddamn it. What, Bowden?

1319
01:23:55,435 --> 01:23:57,371
Uh, I was told
to give you this.

1320
01:23:57,404 --> 01:23:59,373
Just put it somewhere.

1321
01:23:59,406 --> 01:24:04,378
Ladies and gentlemen,
the IP address of the Silk Road server.

1322
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:09,483
- Holy shit.
- All right, get to work.

1323
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:12,854
Kim,
do we have a physical address?

1324
01:24:12,887 --> 01:24:14,789
He's hosted on
a server farm in Iceland.

1325
01:24:14,822 --> 01:24:17,190
Okay, I'll call the AUSA.

1326
01:24:17,224 --> 01:24:19,493
And within 24 hours,
we'll be monitoring this guy in real time.

1327
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:23,598
- Hey, what if it is encrypted chats, too?
- Huh?

1328
01:24:23,631 --> 01:24:26,333
No. But when we bust
him, we'll seize his laptop,

1329
01:24:26,366 --> 01:24:27,735
and then we'll get everything.

1330
01:24:27,769 --> 01:24:29,771
Everyone he ever dealt with.

1331
01:24:31,873 --> 01:24:35,075
...Iceland, you prosecute him right
here and I need to confirm now.

1332
01:24:36,243 --> 01:24:37,712
With a little luck,
we'll do it.

1333
01:24:54,328 --> 01:24:55,830
Hey. I need your help
with something.

1334
01:24:55,863 --> 01:24:57,397
You don't knock?

1335
01:24:57,999 --> 01:25:01,435
Look, it's no secret you and
I don't see eye to eye, okay?

1336
01:25:01,903 --> 01:25:05,740
- No.
- I know that you know that I think you're a...

1337
01:25:06,808 --> 01:25:07,875
Well, you're a dick.

1338
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:10,778
Yeah.

1339
01:25:10,812 --> 01:25:15,382
But Tarbell's a bigger dick,
and I hear he may have found DPR.

1340
01:25:15,415 --> 01:25:17,150
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1341
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,519
- He hasn't said anything to me.
- He wouldn't.

1342
01:25:18,553 --> 01:25:20,454
But I got a source
at the Bureau.

1343
01:25:20,487 --> 01:25:22,189
Says there's a kid
ordering fake passports

1344
01:25:22,222 --> 01:25:23,591
in San Francisco...

1345
01:25:24,424 --> 01:25:26,493
under the name Josh Terrey.

1346
01:25:28,563 --> 01:25:30,163
- Josh Terrey.
- Yeah.

1347
01:25:30,197 --> 01:25:32,366
- In San Francisco.
- Yeah.

1348
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:36,169
Homeland Security's got him
under 24-hour surveillance.

1349
01:25:37,605 --> 01:25:38,940
So, what do you want
from me?

1350
01:25:38,973 --> 01:25:40,642
You got anyone on the ground
out there

1351
01:25:40,675 --> 01:25:42,209
who might be able
to check it out for us?

1352
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,779
Get us in the game?

1353
01:25:44,812 --> 01:25:47,515
But you thought boots on the
ground was a waste of time.

1354
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:49,517
Call it an exception,
right?

1355
01:25:51,919 --> 01:25:53,721
Yeah.

1356
01:25:53,755 --> 01:25:57,324
Well, it's just too bad
that I am a dick.

1357
01:25:58,126 --> 01:26:01,696
Real shame.
Real fucking shame.

1358
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:16,476
Three days
sitting on this prick.

1359
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:19,514
I'm missing
my kid's PONY League playoffs.

1360
01:26:19,547 --> 01:26:21,749
Package is on his doorstep.
It's not like he doesn't know it's there.

1361
01:26:21,783 --> 01:26:22,950
Let's jam him.

1362
01:26:22,984 --> 01:26:24,484
Yes, ma'am.

1363
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:45,606
- Hey.
- Hey.

1364
01:26:46,974 --> 01:26:48,543
- I think you have the wrong address.
- Oh, no.

1365
01:26:49,777 --> 01:26:51,244
I'm Nob.

1366
01:26:52,947 --> 01:26:54,448
Yeah, step aside.

1367
01:26:55,717 --> 01:26:57,417
- How did you find me?
- Close the door.

1368
01:27:03,423 --> 01:27:05,660
- How'd you find me?
- How fucking old are you, dude?

1369
01:27:06,259 --> 01:27:07,762
- Twenty-seven.
- Yeah?

1370
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:10,230
- Yeah.
- You've been shaving long?

1371
01:27:10,865 --> 01:27:11,933
What?

1372
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,570
You have two federal agents in
an unmarked across the street.

1373
01:27:16,037 --> 01:27:18,539
- They're here to arrest you for...
- Wait. What hap...

1374
01:27:18,573 --> 01:27:23,578
Shh... ordering fake passports
off the Silk Road. Yeah.

1375
01:27:23,611 --> 01:27:27,481
When they knock on that door,
this is what you're gonna tell 'em.

1376
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:33,988
Joshua Terrey?

1377
01:27:34,021 --> 01:27:35,656
- Yeah.
- Agent Conroy.

1378
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:37,859
Homeland Security.
This is Agent Ramirez.

1379
01:27:37,892 --> 01:27:38,926
This belong to you?

1380
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:41,896
Contains fake IDs
and passports.

1381
01:27:41,929 --> 01:27:43,664
Do you know anything about that?

1382
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:49,670
Can I see that for a second?

1383
01:27:50,838 --> 01:27:51,906
Yeah.

1384
01:27:52,707 --> 01:27:56,878
Shit. Well, it says right
there, "No signature required."

1385
01:27:56,911 --> 01:27:59,714
Meaning, I haven't
taken possession of it.

1386
01:28:00,347 --> 01:28:02,784
Which is why you knocked
instead of kicked.

1387
01:28:04,986 --> 01:28:10,825
Well, anybody could have ordered that,
you know, off the Silk Road, for instance.

1388
01:28:10,858 --> 01:28:12,527
With your pictures?

1389
01:28:13,661 --> 01:28:18,800
- It's a free country. Now, um...
- if you'll excuse me...

1390
01:28:19,267 --> 01:28:22,837
Sorry I couldn't help you guys
out, but I got some work to do.

1391
01:28:23,503 --> 01:28:24,739
Have a nice day.

1392
01:28:34,749 --> 01:28:36,617
- Holy fucking shit.
- Yeah.

1393
01:28:39,654 --> 01:28:40,822
Now what?

1394
01:28:40,855 --> 01:28:41,889
Now...

1395
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:45,425
you delete
our fucking chat history.

1396
01:28:46,527 --> 01:28:47,562
Yeah.

1397
01:28:47,595 --> 01:28:48,696
- Like, now.
- Yeah.

1398
01:28:48,729 --> 01:28:50,497
- Do it.
- Yeah. Just...

1399
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:57,337
You think
this is a fucking game?

1400
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:02,743
- All of it.
- Yeah. Just give me a second.

1401
01:29:02,777 --> 01:29:04,145
You think I'm
going down 'cause of you?

1402
01:29:04,178 --> 01:29:05,746
I ain't going down
because of you.

1403
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,516
It's gone. It's done.

1404
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:10,450
Fucking better be.

1405
01:29:13,087 --> 01:29:16,791
Next time,
just don't be such a smart ass.

1406
01:29:20,728 --> 01:29:21,996
Yeah.

1407
01:29:39,814 --> 01:29:41,115
Fuck!

1408
01:29:47,755 --> 01:29:48,990
Fuck!

1409
01:30:10,578 --> 01:30:12,747
What you doing back there, Rayford?
You rubbing it out?

1410
01:30:14,749 --> 01:30:17,218
You better not be fucking telling
me you lost my Bitcoin, Ray.

1411
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:25,893
"Don't trip.

1412
01:30:27,028 --> 01:30:28,663
I got your back."

1413
01:30:39,073 --> 01:30:42,810
You motherfucking,
ingrate cocksucker. Fuck.

1414
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,615
The fuck is that?

1415
01:30:47,648 --> 01:30:50,151
- It's 37K, yo.
- Thirty-seven K?

1416
01:30:50,184 --> 01:30:52,753
Dude, I had fucking 200K
in my Bitcoin wallet.

1417
01:30:52,787 --> 01:30:55,488
Well, it's not my fault that Bitcoin
been going up and down and shit.

1418
01:30:55,523 --> 01:30:57,091
It's fucking volatile.

1419
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,493
Won't even
fucking last me a year.

1420
01:31:01,228 --> 01:31:03,597
Tuition's 40 fucking grand.

1421
01:31:04,031 --> 01:31:07,735
- Motherfucker. Unbelievable.
- Forty fucking grand?

1422
01:31:07,768 --> 01:31:10,871
I thought your kid was in
pre-school, yo. Shit.

1423
01:31:11,539 --> 01:31:14,942
I don't care. Gonna see how
much time we got to negotiate.

1424
01:31:17,545 --> 01:31:20,982
- Tarbell.
- Any word from the Icelandic Embassy?

1425
01:31:21,015 --> 01:31:24,151
My guys are heading to Reykjavik in
an hour. When it goes, it goes fast.

1426
01:31:24,185 --> 01:31:26,187
<i>How long
until his servers are mirrored?</i>

1427
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:28,022
Twelve hours from when they
hit the Thor Data Center.

1428
01:31:28,055 --> 01:31:30,825
And it's what,
seven, eight hours' flight?

1429
01:31:30,858 --> 01:31:32,693
What are you, a travel agent?

1430
01:31:32,727 --> 01:31:34,128
<i>No, man. Just seeing
if you need any backup.</i>

1431
01:31:34,161 --> 01:31:36,764
Negative, Bowden.
Fucking guy.

1432
01:31:38,332 --> 01:31:39,900
We got 19 hours.

1433
01:31:39,934 --> 01:31:40,968
Then what?

1434
01:31:43,037 --> 01:31:45,106
Then I take care of my family.

1435
01:31:45,139 --> 01:31:48,142
Set up a new user profile for
me, Friendly Chemist.

1436
01:31:48,175 --> 01:31:50,111
Shit. Bowden,
you know something, huh?

1437
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,579
Hmm.

1438
01:31:52,413 --> 01:31:55,282
He wants to fuck me in the ass,
he can pay for the privilege.

1439
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:11,198
Fucking bullshit.

1440
01:32:17,238 --> 01:32:20,941
- No. No. No.
- Piece of shit.

1441
01:32:20,975 --> 01:32:24,011
Ah. I'm gonna
send you something, okay?

1442
01:32:24,045 --> 01:32:25,880
Send him this.

1443
01:32:27,148 --> 01:32:29,550
Is that
his fucking IP address, yo?

1444
01:32:30,017 --> 01:32:31,285
That'll wake him up.

1445
01:32:39,193 --> 01:32:40,227
Shit.

1446
01:32:57,778 --> 01:32:59,280
What's so funny, dude?

1447
01:32:59,313 --> 01:33:01,749
We're on a fucking stakeout,
you know, right?

1448
01:33:01,782 --> 01:33:03,250
Well, it's more like
a shakedown, remember?

1449
01:33:03,284 --> 01:33:04,318
I guess so.

1450
01:33:09,857 --> 01:33:11,692
Fuck, yeah,
I do international jobs.

1451
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:15,863
Friendly fucking Chemist
from British Columbia.

1452
01:33:15,896 --> 01:33:17,765
I think I might know a biker up there

1453
01:33:17,798 --> 01:33:19,200
who could take care of business.

1454
01:33:21,035 --> 01:33:24,705
I want you to set up another user
profile, RedWhiteAndBlue.

1455
01:33:24,738 --> 01:33:27,241
Fucking Bowden,
a stone-cold criminal.

1456
01:33:27,875 --> 01:33:29,877
When the fuck
you learn how to do that?

1457
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:32,279
<i>Hey, it's Cally. Uh...</i>

1458
01:33:32,313 --> 01:33:35,149
<i>We are here at the restaurant,
and it is beautiful.</i>

1459
01:33:35,182 --> 01:33:37,818
<i>And I have no idea</i>
<i>where you are.</i>

1460
01:33:38,553 --> 01:33:41,956
<i>Dad is getting really hungry.
Please hurry. Okay, love you, bye.</i>

1461
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:43,924
You're a major...

1462
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:46,227
Hey, sorry I'm late.

1463
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:49,196
- Hi, sweetheart. Hi.
- Hey.

1464
01:33:49,864 --> 01:33:52,700
- You look great.
- You look stressed.

1465
01:33:52,733 --> 01:33:54,935
Oh, no.
It's just work stuff, you know?

1466
01:33:56,003 --> 01:33:58,172
How was the flight? Oh.

1467
01:33:58,672 --> 01:34:01,075
I don't know why you wasted
money on business class.

1468
01:34:03,911 --> 01:34:08,249
Uh... Well, reservation's under my name.
Ulbricht.

1469
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,118
Follow me.

1470
01:34:11,152 --> 01:34:12,786
Listen, I'll see you guys
in there.

1471
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:13,921
- Okay?
- Okay.

1472
01:34:14,523 --> 01:34:16,290
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

1473
01:34:17,324 --> 01:34:19,827
- You sure?
- Yeah. No, I'm good.

1474
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,696
Okay.
Don't let me strain it.

1475
01:34:41,782 --> 01:34:43,350
Cold, bitch. Cold.

1476
01:34:43,384 --> 01:34:46,420
- Please.
- Fuck, dude.

1477
01:34:48,189 --> 01:34:50,124
Fucker, hit him back, though.

1478
01:35:04,438 --> 01:35:05,472
We can just order.

1479
01:35:05,507 --> 01:35:07,741
No. Let's wait for him.

1480
01:35:36,804 --> 01:35:38,839
We got him. Let's go.

1481
01:35:40,174 --> 01:35:42,076
Checkmate, motherfucker.

1482
01:35:48,882 --> 01:35:50,384
Here he comes.
We'll wait.

1483
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:51,885
I'm sorry about that.

1484
01:35:53,053 --> 01:35:56,156
Work's been, uh... crazy.

1485
01:35:58,826 --> 01:36:00,227
Hey.

1486
01:36:02,997 --> 01:36:05,366
I'm really proud of you
and how hard you're working.

1487
01:36:08,202 --> 01:36:10,271
I guess you found the thing.

1488
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:14,174
Yeah.

1489
01:37:17,171 --> 01:37:19,541
How the fuck
do you eat that shit, yo?

1490
01:37:19,574 --> 01:37:22,209
- The fuck you got against bear claws, huh?
- Fucking disgusting.

1491
01:37:22,677 --> 01:37:26,447
Don't even got a fucking half-and-half
at this bullshit-ass donut shop.

1492
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,382
The fuck is this?

1493
01:37:28,415 --> 01:37:30,951
You call me out here to watch
you eat a fucking bear claw?

1494
01:37:36,558 --> 01:37:38,459
I want you
to give that to Sandy.

1495
01:37:45,299 --> 01:37:47,501
You could still get out
from under this, right?

1496
01:37:47,935 --> 01:37:49,403
Right.

1497
01:37:51,071 --> 01:37:52,373
Tired, man.

1498
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:55,442
"Tired, man."

1499
01:37:57,177 --> 01:37:59,046
Don't give up, Rick.

1500
01:37:59,079 --> 01:38:01,014
You know, man...

1501
01:38:02,282 --> 01:38:03,618
I was wrong about you.

1502
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:07,087
You are a friend.

1503
01:38:10,625 --> 01:38:12,025
Don't let me down.

1504
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:39,486
He's on the move.
Got his laptop with him.

1505
01:38:39,521 --> 01:38:41,021
<i>Which way is he coming?</i>

1506
01:38:42,657 --> 01:38:44,191
Right at you.

1507
01:38:44,692 --> 01:38:46,059
Fuck.

1508
01:38:51,031 --> 01:38:52,534
How can I help you?

1509
01:38:52,567 --> 01:38:55,102
- Iced tea, please.
- Sure. It'll be three dollars.

1510
01:39:01,175 --> 01:39:03,545
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

1511
01:39:15,289 --> 01:39:16,490
On him.

1512
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:20,093
<i>Blue hoodie, jeans,
flip-flops,</i>

1513
01:39:20,127 --> 01:39:22,162
<i>on foot, westbound
towards target location.</i>

1514
01:39:22,196 --> 01:39:24,431
<i>I'm letting him go,
confirm when you have a visual.</i>

1515
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:31,271
<i>For years,
I was frustrated</i>

1516
01:39:31,305 --> 01:39:33,508
<i>by what seemed to be
the insurmountable barriers</i>

1517
01:39:33,541 --> 01:39:38,145
<i>between the world as it is
and the world I wanted.</i>

1518
01:39:38,178 --> 01:39:43,551
<i>So, I began making a website where people
could buy and sell anything anonymously.</i>

1519
01:39:44,418 --> 01:39:47,755
<i>I built it because I think
the pursuit of freedom</i>

1520
01:39:47,789 --> 01:39:50,324
<i>is the most
noble human endeavor.</i>

1521
01:39:51,091 --> 01:39:53,327
<i>I knew the state might try
to impede it,</i>

1522
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:56,063
<i>but if we never try
for fear of retribution,</i>

1523
01:39:56,096 --> 01:39:57,632
<i>we have already lost,
you know?</i>

1524
01:39:59,166 --> 01:40:01,301
<i>Silk Road is about
something much bigger</i>

1525
01:40:01,335 --> 01:40:03,470
<i>than thumbing your nose
at the man.</i>

1526
01:40:04,806 --> 01:40:08,275
<i>It's about taking back
our liberty.</i>

1527
01:40:08,308 --> 01:40:12,346
<i>And as corny as it sounds,
I just wanna look back at my life</i>

1528
01:40:12,379 --> 01:40:15,382
<i>and know that I did something
that helped people.</i>

1529
01:40:21,421 --> 01:40:24,526
Nobody moves until my go.
He doesn't log in, we abort.

1530
01:40:24,559 --> 01:40:27,261
And I repeat,
if he closes the laptop,

1531
01:40:27,294 --> 01:40:29,162
<i>data's encrypted
and we got shit.</i>

1532
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:31,666
<i>Everybody calm the fuck down.</i>

1533
01:40:31,699 --> 01:40:33,635
Just calm the fuck down.
We got this. Here we go.

1534
01:40:33,668 --> 01:40:35,770
Okay, let's get
the reception on one.

1535
01:40:35,803 --> 01:40:38,238
Uh, I wanna see surveillance
perimeter on three right there.

1536
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:40,575
Uh, yeah, pump that over.
Okay, we're good.

1537
01:40:40,608 --> 01:40:43,578
Let's zoom in there.
Yeah, that's good. Yeah.

1538
01:40:43,611 --> 01:40:45,279
We got him, huh?

1539
01:40:45,312 --> 01:40:47,214
Shit's going down
right now. Shush.

1540
01:40:47,247 --> 01:40:49,249
Everybody, ready? Here we go.
Let's get him.

1541
01:40:50,852 --> 01:40:54,421
Hold, hold.
The mic on Ghost 2 isn't on.

1542
01:40:54,454 --> 01:40:56,456
The fuck are these guys doing?

1543
01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:58,560
What the fuck kind of Mickey
Mouse operation is this shit?

1544
01:40:58,593 --> 01:41:02,129
The fuck, Tarbell!
All right, go down visual.

1545
01:41:04,866 --> 01:41:06,500
<i>Ghost 2, hold your position.</i>

1546
01:41:15,777 --> 01:41:17,579
Hey, who the fuck
is calling him?

1547
01:41:22,249 --> 01:41:23,651
Hello?

1548
01:41:23,685 --> 01:41:25,252
<i>Hey, kid, listen.</i>

1549
01:41:25,954 --> 01:41:28,756
When you hit 50,
and life hasn't turned out

1550
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:30,625
quite the way you thought
it would when you were 28,

1551
01:41:30,658 --> 01:41:32,594
<i>I want you
to remember one thing.</i>

1552
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:36,430
I got to you first,
smart ass.

1553
01:41:48,275 --> 01:41:51,411
Do it, you son of a bitch.
Come on. Log in.

1554
01:42:04,726 --> 01:42:06,259
And...

1555
01:42:11,633 --> 01:42:12,867
Now.

1556
01:42:14,301 --> 01:42:16,336
Low-life cocksucker!

1557
01:42:17,605 --> 01:42:19,306
- Hey.
- Freeze, motherfucker.

1558
01:42:19,339 --> 01:42:20,775
Back away from the table now.

1559
01:42:20,808 --> 01:42:22,409
Put your hands up. Go.

1560
01:42:24,746 --> 01:42:26,848
- Stay right there.
- Turn around and face me.

1561
01:42:30,217 --> 01:42:31,853
- Do not move.
- Head down.

1562
01:42:31,886 --> 01:42:34,488
- I repeat, do not move.
- Head down.

1563
01:42:37,659 --> 01:42:39,259
Stay where you are.
Nobody move.

1564
01:42:40,028 --> 01:42:44,431
Stay right there, sir.
Do not move. Hands up. Head down.

1565
01:42:44,464 --> 01:42:47,802
Head down. Keep moving.
Head down. Turn around.

1566
01:42:47,835 --> 01:42:51,806
Turn around! On your knees.
On your knees, now!

1567
01:42:53,541 --> 01:42:55,175
Let me call you back.

1568
01:42:57,845 --> 01:42:59,346
Just fucking...

1569
01:42:59,881 --> 01:43:03,450
When they come, when they
come, and they will come,

1570
01:43:04,184 --> 01:43:07,387
some millennial asshole who thinks
he can do the job better than you...

1571
01:43:07,989 --> 01:43:10,992
I'm not talking about Shields, I'm not talking
about the DEA. I'm talking about America.

1572
01:43:11,025 --> 01:43:13,493
This whole country is overrun
by these little assholes.

1573
01:43:13,528 --> 01:43:15,630
And everything they know,
they learned off a screen.

1574
01:43:16,363 --> 01:43:18,800
Not staring down
the barrel of a gun.

1575
01:43:21,301 --> 01:43:22,937
Experience matters, Johnny.

1576
01:43:23,437 --> 01:43:25,907
And you, above all people,
should know that.

1577
01:43:26,507 --> 01:43:30,812
You got a whole building full of us old
war horses here. So when they come...

1578
01:43:30,845 --> 01:43:34,281
- Bowden! Bowden!
- ...it's your job to protect them.

1579
01:43:34,816 --> 01:43:37,652
Bowden! Bowden!

1580
01:43:38,586 --> 01:43:40,487
Don't let that cunt cuff me.

1581
01:43:43,891 --> 01:43:45,993
Rick, turn around.
Hands up.

1582
01:43:46,027 --> 01:43:48,228
Hands where I can see 'em.
You're under arrest.

1583
01:43:49,197 --> 01:43:53,034
Ross Ulbricht, you're under
arrest for narcotics trafficking,

1584
01:43:53,067 --> 01:43:55,970
money laundering and conspiracy.

1585
01:43:59,372 --> 01:44:00,742
It's over, son.

1586
01:44:24,532 --> 01:44:25,767
<i>You okay?</i>

1587
01:44:27,367 --> 01:44:29,737
<i>Yeah.</i>

1588
01:44:29,771 --> 01:44:30,805
- <i>You look good.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1589
01:44:30,838 --> 01:44:32,006
You, too.

1590
01:44:32,507 --> 01:44:34,842
- Yeah? You're just saying that?
- No. Mm-hmm.

1591
01:44:38,846 --> 01:44:40,380
Is she here?

1592
01:44:40,915 --> 01:44:43,084
- Yeah. Yeah, she's in there.
- Yeah?

1593
01:44:43,117 --> 01:44:46,921
- I, um, wanted to talk to you first.
- Okay.

1594
01:44:46,954 --> 01:44:48,488
Did you, uh...

1595
01:44:49,991 --> 01:44:51,025
Did you...

1596
01:45:02,103 --> 01:45:03,838
<i>Yeah, we got it.</i>

1597
01:45:11,546 --> 01:45:14,782
Listen, you are always
gonna be Edie's father.

1598
01:45:20,121 --> 01:45:21,622
Well?

1599
01:45:28,763 --> 01:45:32,700
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I don't know.

1600
01:45:46,446 --> 01:45:47,849
- Hey.
- Hey.

1601
01:45:48,649 --> 01:45:49,717
Hey.

1602
01:45:51,586 --> 01:45:54,487
Hey. Oh, peanut.

1603
01:45:54,522 --> 01:45:55,556
Hi, Dada.

1604
01:45:57,024 --> 01:45:58,458
So?

1605
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:06,000
Oh, my gosh. Wow.
Look at that, huh?

1606
01:46:06,033 --> 01:46:09,770
Mom, you're seeing that?
Huh? Is it matching?

1607
01:46:10,338 --> 01:46:12,472
- No?
- I made it my own way.

1608
01:46:14,108 --> 01:46:17,377
Good girl, peanut.
Good girl.

1609
01:46:18,546 --> 01:46:21,782
So, new school, huh?
Excited?

1610
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:26,453
Nervous? Little?
No, you're not nervous, are you?

1611
01:46:26,486 --> 01:46:28,689
No, you're my big tiger,
aren't you?

1612
01:46:28,723 --> 01:46:31,959
There you go. Huh?

1613
01:46:34,095 --> 01:46:36,496
They're probably gonna
tell you some things, peanut.

1614
01:46:37,665 --> 01:46:39,867
They're gonna tell you,
you're gonna hear some things, you know,

1615
01:46:39,901 --> 01:46:41,836
say things like,
you know, life is...

1616
01:46:43,704 --> 01:46:45,573
life is not always
black and white,

1617
01:46:45,606 --> 01:46:48,408
but, you know, things are
more complicated than that.

1618
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:50,912
Okay?

1619
01:46:50,945 --> 01:46:55,650
But here's the truth.
Okay?

1620
01:46:59,553 --> 01:47:02,590
There's good and bad in this world.

1621
01:47:03,591 --> 01:47:07,762
And, uh, sometimes you gotta make a
choice, you gotta pick a side, okay?

1622
01:47:11,198 --> 01:47:13,701
I'll always be there
to tell you this...

1623
01:47:17,104 --> 01:47:18,706
that you are loved.

1624
01:47:23,611 --> 01:47:25,613
I love you, Dada.

1625
01:47:47,201 --> 01:47:49,170
Okay, sweetie.

1626
01:48:07,922 --> 01:48:11,092
<i>Silk Road was supposed to
be about giving people the freedom</i>

1627
01:48:11,125 --> 01:48:15,997
<i>to make their own choices,
to pursue their own happiness.</i>

1628
01:48:17,665 --> 01:48:20,768
<i>But I learned that
when you give people freedom,</i>

1629
01:48:21,569 --> 01:48:23,537
<i>you don't know
what they'll do with it.</i>

1630
01:48:29,043 --> 01:48:33,781
<i>Your Honor, I know you must
take away my middle years,</i>

1632
01:48:38,085 --> 01:48:41,088
<i>Please leave a small light
at the end of the tunnel,</i>

1633
01:48:42,056 --> 01:48:44,759
<i>an excuse to stay healthy,</i>

1634
01:48:44,792 --> 01:48:50,164
