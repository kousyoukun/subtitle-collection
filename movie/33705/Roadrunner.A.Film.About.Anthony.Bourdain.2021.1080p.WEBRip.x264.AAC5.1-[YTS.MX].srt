00:03:55,228 --> 00:03:56,396

Hi. This is Tony at les halles,
411 park Avenue south,

79
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:11,945
for delivery Monday please.

80
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:15,315
I need one Spanish onion,
one loose carrot,

81
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:16,983
two shallot unpeeled,

82
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:21,754
one case frozen fava bean
and one case miel de provence.

83
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:23,756
That'll do it. Thank you.

84
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:31,431
Where is my fucking fish?

85
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:33,333
I would never be late.

86
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:35,734
My cooks would never be late.

87
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:38,438
How can the fish guy be late?

88
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:40,739
It's why all chefs are drunks.

89
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:42,075
It's because we don't understand

90
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:44,945
why the world doesn't work
like our kitchens.

91
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:55,788
<i>- Oh, hold on.
- If you guys are hun...</i>

92
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:56,999
It's just baba ghanoush. It's...

93
00:04:57,023 --> 00:04:58,401
I mean, it's not
a very nice display,

94
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,492
- I know Tony.
- Cool.

95
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:00,859
Thanks, baby.

96
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:03,029
- What would you like?
- Um...

97
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:05,365
- Apple juice.
- Apple juice? Apple juice?

98
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:08,767
Or cranberry. I don't care.
Whatever we have more of.

99
00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:13,306
Happiness is a fresh pack.

100
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:16,909
First thing in the morning.

101
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:18,511
I mean, before I brush my teeth.

102
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:20,256
I mean, I roll out of bed,
light a cigarette,

103
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,781
stumble into this room,
and, uh, I start,

104
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
uh, I start writing immediately.

105
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:30,123
<i>I always use language
to get out of trouble.</i>

106
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:33,026
<i>You know,
I found at an early age,</i>

107
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,228
<i>if I made everybody
in the class laugh,</i>

108
00:05:35,262 --> 00:05:36,262
that was power.

109
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:40,267
<i>I came from a household
with a lot of books.</i>

110
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,078
<i>In fact, the first book
I remember reading was</i>

111
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:44,004
<i>a book called</i>
why Johnny can't read,

112
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:46,273
<i>which I stole from my mother.</i>

113
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:48,174
<i>She was anticipating
that I would have</i>

114
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,310
<i>a difficulty reading
because I was already exhibiting</i>

115
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:52,112
<i>antisocial tendencies.</i>

116
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:55,282
Uh, I pinched the book and,
uh, basically taught myself

117
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:58,151
to read, uh, by kindergarten.

118
00:05:58,184 --> 00:06:00,453
<i>And then, you know,
my early heroes</i>

119
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:04,024
<i>were, uh, musicians
and-and writers.</i>

120
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,826
<i>The idea that you could
have adventures,</i>

121
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,363
<i>no matter how antisocial,
and then make them</i>

122
00:06:10,397 --> 00:06:12,608
<i>somehow legitimate by writing
something beautiful about them,</i>

123
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:15,201
<i>that concept took
an early hold on me.</i>

124
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,105
<i>I wasn't serious enough
about anything</i>

125
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,142
<i>to actually do any writing
until '93.</i>

126
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:24,577
<i>But, you know, when I was given
the opportunity, I did it,</i>

127
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:26,879
<i>and, you know, kept doing it.</i>

128
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:31,117
The whole business
fills me with terror, frankly.

129
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:48,234
Hey.

130
00:06:50,403 --> 00:06:53,073
How are you doing, man?

131
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:55,342
- You guys know each other by now.
- Yes.

132
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,444
Let me see if Rocco's over.

133
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:01,514
<i>What was it about Tony
with big knives?</i>

134
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,250
They were never sharp enough.

135
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:06,619
You know, he's...
He'd just always...

136
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:08,488
<i>When he came over
for Thanksgiving, uh,</i>

137
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:10,499
<i>I was gonna carve the Turkey,
and then he took over.</i>

138
00:07:10,523 --> 00:07:13,159
<i>He was very short with me about</i>

139
00:07:13,193 --> 00:07:15,662
<i>how I wasn't taking care
of my knives.</i>

140
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:18,498
- Hey.
- Tony saw you when you were just born.

141
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:19,966
Remember that?

142
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:23,069
<i>My relationship with Tony</i>

143
00:07:23,103 --> 00:07:25,372
<i>has always been as a writer.</i>

144
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:28,475
He was such a powerful writer
right from the start.

145
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,646
<i>He was on business in Tokyo
for the first time.</i>

146
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,984
<i>And he was writing me
a series of emails.</i>

147
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:40,620
<i>He was back in his room,
and he-he did</i>

148
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:42,288
one of those bursts.

149
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:45,658
<i>"The jet lag
wouldn't let me sleep,</i>

150
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:47,394
<i>"so I crashed late
and Rose early,</i>

151
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:50,397
<i>"plunging blindly down
dark streets at all hours.</i>

152
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,600
<i>"The streets were unbelievably
dense with pedestrians,</i>

153
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:55,301
<i>"people hanging around,

154
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:57,637

<i>for whatever came next."</i>

163
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:23,396
I loved it. I loved it,

164
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,733
<i>and my wife Karen,
who was a book publisher,</i>

165
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:30,703
<i>was in the living room

166
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:32,305
<i>I printed out the email</i>

167
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:35,375
and I went,
"Karen, you have to read this."

00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:37,210
Am I allowed to curse?

169
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:40,380
Does anybody curse
when they talk about this?

170
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:44,451
I read it and I just went,
"that is fucking awesome."

171
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:45,685
I was like, "okay",

172
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:47,420
<i>I'm gonna make him an offer</i>

173
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:51,057
<i>"basically he can't
fucking refuse."</i>

174
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:53,460
He came back
and then we sat down.

175
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:55,261
I said, "so Joel tells me,

176
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,639
you know,
you have a lot of stories."

177
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:58,198
And he goes,
"I have so many stories.

178
00:08:58,231 --> 00:08:59,599
I'm so excited to tell them."

179
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:01,043
He said, "I already have
a title for it."

180
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:02,335
I said, "what's the title?"

181
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:03,646
And he said,
<i>"kitchen confidential."</i>

182
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,271
And I said,
"I love it. Let's do it."

183
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:07,407
What do you think
about Tony bourdain anyway?

184
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,342
Yeah, what do you
think about that guy?

185
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,410
He's cool. Huh?

186
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,418
<i>It was like,
"will you write this book?"</i>

187
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,686
"Yes."

188
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:21,087
"Can you write it
in eight months?"

189
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,355
"You're damn right I will."

190
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:24,023
<i>You know, you should talk</i>

191
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,391
to Tony's agent,

192
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:27,126
<i>Kim Witherspoon.</i>

193
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,596
<i>I don't think
Tony was afraid of failure,</i>

194
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:31,264
<i>and that was hard-wired.</i>

195
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:33,199
He was the kind of person
who thought,

196
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:34,734
"well, you know, what the fuck?

197
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,603
Let's just try it
and see how it turns out."

198
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:38,705
<i>Anthony bourdain,
who has worked as a chef</i>

199
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:41,641
<i>for 28 years, reveals
some surprising and disturbing</i>

200
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:44,777
<i>trade secrets in a new book</i>
<i>called</i> kitchen confidential.

201
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:46,513
<i>Chef Anthony says the truth</i>

202
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:48,114
about bread in a restaurant,

203
00:09:48,147 --> 00:09:49,792
how you should prepare
your meat when you order it,

204
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:51,518
and also the truth about fish

205
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,286
<i>could make you sick.</i>

206
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:55,588
I was in a cranky mood
after my last restaurant closed

207
00:09:55,622 --> 00:09:59,192
and, uh, felt no reason
not to tell the truth about

208
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:02,529
a business I both love and,
uh, have mixed emotions about.

209
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:06,266
Kitchen confidential <i>is a memoir</i>

210
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,669
<i>of Tony's life in the kitchen
and the salty adventures</i>

211
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:11,638
<i>that he had with his cooks.</i>

212
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:13,606
It was kind of lawless.

213
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,543
You know, a lot was broken,
as Tony used to say.

214
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:20,413
<i>Mr. Bourdain is the
executive chef at les halles.</i>

215
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:21,414
<i>He found success</i>

216
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:24,717
and a full-blown heroin habit
at an early age.

217
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:28,288
<i>I had a dope problem,
a cocaine problem,</i>

218
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:31,491
<i>but by '88, I pretty much
cleaned up my act.</i>

219
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:36,829
The dietary supplement
that every chef needs.

220
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:38,798
I take around ten
of these a day.

221
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:41,234
It's an aspirin/tylenol mix.

222
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:47,240
Call 'em crunchies.

223
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:49,309
Let me take you
on a notional joyride

224
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:50,577
through our menu tonight.

225
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,713
We have grilled salmon
with sorrel sauce.

226
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:55,281
Veal kidneys.

227
00:10:55,315 --> 00:10:57,350
These kidneys are
really good, by the way.

228
00:10:57,383 --> 00:11:00,453
Those of you into water sports
will find much to love.

229
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,722
<i>From the first time
I met him, I remember thinking,</i>

230
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:05,725
<i>"oh, wow, you're, like, tall
and handsome and funny.</i>

231
00:11:05,758 --> 00:11:07,727
"But you're kind of a big nerd.

232
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,295
"You're nerding out
on everything,

233
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:10,597
and you're a little awkward,"

234
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,299
<i>and I love that about him.</i>

235
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:16,903
<i>"At les halles,
life goes on as always,</i>

236
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,839
<i>"the same crew showing up

<i>"Eddy,</i>

00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:26,179
<i>"They're still with me,

240
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:28,514
<i>"My bosses, however,
when they read this,</i>

241
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:30,516
<i>"will really prove themselves
patrons of the arts</i>

242
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,585
<i>if they don't can me
right away."</i>

243
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:35,254
<i>So you didn't fire him?</i>

244
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:36,422
<i>I didn't fire him.</i>

245
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:38,524
I didn't know it
was being written.

246
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:40,393
I didn't know
it was going to be published.

247
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:42,328
<i>Uh, one day, I arrived
at the restaurant,</i>

248
00:11:42,362 --> 00:11:44,530
and I just said,
"what happened?"

249
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:47,533
You're fucking kidding me.

250
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:52,372
I was told today that on, I
guess, the 12th of this month,

251
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:54,774
it'll be number seven
on the <i>times</i> best seller list.

252
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:57,644
'Cause it was on 20,
wasn't it? And then, uh...

253
00:11:57,677 --> 00:11:59,379
I mean, I'm getting
congratulatory calls,

254
00:11:59,412 --> 00:12:02,215
and they're telling me
I have a best seller.

255
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:03,816
Uh, really, it's scary.

256
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,785
No, it's exciting.
It's wonderful.

257
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:07,955
Yeah, I just...

258
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:10,189
Anything that happens
beyond that door

259
00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:12,592
I'm suspicious of.

260
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:15,662
<i>He was always

<i>like in a pressure cooker.</i>

264
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:25,805
So when there was this
opportunity, he-he was ready.

<i>"By the time I was 43,</i>

- Thank you.

270
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:50,931
That was cool.

You're giving interviews?

275

fabulous, uh, little snackies
for-for my wife.

283
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:19,792
I would be lying if I told you that.

284
00:13:19,826 --> 00:13:22,462
It's more like,
"honey, call out for Chinese."

- Wow.

Y-You're asking me to, you know,

kick Santa claus in the crotch

309
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:37,370
I mean...

310
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:39,672
My life gets
more and more ridiculous.

311
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:41,550

Yeah, guess what's,
uh, tomorrow.

His book <i>kitchen confidential</i>

317

<i>I was born to cook.</i>

<i>a cook's tour.</i>

adventures in the far east

339

<i>Hey, John, come here.</i>

342
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,901
<i>You know, my 15 minutes of</i>

343
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:17,938
<i>quote, unquote "fame,"
uh, you know, when that's over,</i>

344
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:20,706
uh, I will be perfectly
comfortable with that,

345
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,109
if not relieved.

346
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:23,876
I think even relieved
at this point.

347
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,813
<i>When I met him
for the first time,</i>

348
00:16:27,847 --> 00:16:31,184
he had made a splash with
<i>kitchen confidential.</i>

349
00:16:31,218 --> 00:16:33,886
<i>I had read
that he had a contract</i>

350
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,889
<i>to write a second book</i>
<i>called</i> a cook's tour,

351
00:16:36,923 --> 00:16:38,791
and I called him.

352
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:41,228
- Yes?
- <i>And I said,</i>

353
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:42,996
- <i>"hey, I'm a producer."</i>
- Doing good.

354
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,530
<i>"Would you ever even consider</i>

355
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:47,566
<i>making</i> cook's tour
<i>into a series?"</i>

356
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,202
<i>And he, you know,
he was like, you know,</i>

357
00:16:49,236 --> 00:16:50,938
"yeah, uh, whatever."

358
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:52,638
- <i>You know? "Sure."</i>
- Sure.

359
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:55,675
<i>He was very nonplussed
about the whole idea</i>

360
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,677
<i>of doing anything in television.</i>

361
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,947
<i>It was not what was on his mind.</i>

362
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,447
Bye-bye.

363
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:05,085
<i>A week and a half later,</i>

364
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:06,519
Chris Collins and I

365
00:17:06,552 --> 00:17:09,089
<i>went up to les halles.</i>

366
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:10,890
<i>We found Tony,</i>

367
00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:13,193
<i>shot a demo with him</i>

368
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:14,995
and had a conversation with him.

369
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:19,532
And it became immediately clear
he had never traveled.

370
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:23,103
Lydia and I were
far greater world travelers

371
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:24,237
than Tony bourdain.

372
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:26,706
His travels were in his head.

373
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:28,976
<i>You know, I want
to go to faraway exotic places</i>

374
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:31,711
<i>with palm trees and
where teenagers in army uniforms</i>

375
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:33,579
<i>carry machine guns.</i>

376
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,850
Growing up as a kid, you know,
I watched <i>the crimson pirate.</i>

377
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:40,253
<i>You know,
all pirates and bad guys</i>

378
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:42,655
<i>having great adventures.</i>

379
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:50,896
<i>Tony's view of the world</i>

380
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:54,800
<i>emanated from books
and from films.</i>

381
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:57,270
<i>Almost in an encyclopedic way,</i>

382
00:17:57,304 --> 00:18:00,073
he could grab
all these references.

383
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:02,742
<i>And I think he was excited</i>

384
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:04,910
<i>to go on this journey</i>

385
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:07,747
to see if the reality

386
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,916
actually matched
the imagination.

387
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,295
<i>That moment when we set out</i>

388
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:26,799
<i>in December of 2000,
it's indelible.</i>

389
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,870
Our first journey
was, um, for six weeks.

390
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:34,274
And remember,
we'd only spent one...

391
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:37,177
One day with Tony
leading up to that moment.

392
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,318
<i>The image of Tony,
I mean, it was, I think,</i>

393
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:47,820
<i>a guy who, at that moment,
was very unsure</i>

394
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:50,023
<i>of what was about to happen.</i>

395
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:51,791
This way.

396
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:53,692
<i>You know, I'm looking at</i>

397
00:18:53,726 --> 00:18:56,096
<i>a strange and, uh,
unpredictable future</i>

398
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:58,631
<i>in a tough business with rules</i>

399
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:00,599
that I'm not
com-completely familiar with,

400
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:03,769
and when I become familiar
with them, I...

401
00:19:03,803 --> 00:19:06,973
You know, I don't know
whether I like them that much.

402
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:10,643
<i>We hit the road together,</i>

403
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:12,912
<i>just the three of us.</i>

404
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:16,216
<i>Lydia and I
had just gotten married.</i>

405
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:21,221
<i>And then we had Tony,
a guy who we barely knew.</i>

406
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:23,823
So it was like three idiots

407
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:25,959
trying to figure each other out.

408
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:28,962
<i>The first shoot was Japan.</i>

409
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:30,796
<i>Like, we didn't know
what we were doing.</i>

410
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,731
<i>He definitely didn't know
what he was doing.</i>

411
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:38,838
<i>And Tony immediately became
uncomfortable and awkward.</i>

412
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:42,109
<i>What we would find out
very quickly is.</i>

413
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:45,811
<i>Tony was actually
a very shy human being.</i>

414
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:50,117
<i>And to get him to make
eye contact or to interact,</i>

415
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,619
<i>it wasn't his natural state.</i>

416
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:01,794
You know, life
on the road with Tony bourdain

417
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,363
just isn't
all it's cracked up to be.

418
00:20:03,396 --> 00:20:05,031
You know what I mean?

419
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:09,702
The man can be a royal pain
in the ass sometimes.

420
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:13,706
In fact, I got this cold sore
on my lip now,

421
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:16,709
and it's due to stress,

422
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:21,948
stress over Tony's
lack of communication.

423
00:20:22,815 --> 00:20:24,317
<i>That, compounded by the fact</i>

424
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:27,287
<i>that we were in Japan
being sort of led into scenes</i>

425
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,292
<i>where there was a lot of,
kind of, formality involved,</i>

426
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:34,995
<i>you know, all of those
factored into him being</i>

427
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:36,029
quiet,

428
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:38,965
which was like
the worst possible thing.

429
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:43,203
Mmm. Oh, wow.

430
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:46,705
Spectacular.

431
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:47,974
<i>I mean, Chris and I went</i>

432
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:50,043
back to the hotel and basically

433
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:51,354
looked at each other
and said like...

434
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:53,313
We're fucked.

435
00:20:58,218 --> 00:21:00,920
Chris, can...
Chris, take a picture of

436
00:21:00,954 --> 00:21:03,756
me and Lydia as we come back
with the sun behind her,

437
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:06,026
pointing up the mountain
towards the farmhouse

438
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,396
as we walk up past
the yellow triangular sign.

439
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:11,730
Thank you.

440
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:13,466
Okay. Here we go.

441
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,035
Okay.

442
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:17,103
I mean, to be honest,
I'm not totally alone,

443
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:18,771
'cause clearly somebody is
shooting this.

444
00:21:18,804 --> 00:21:20,349
I always love those,
like, desert scenes,

445
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:22,108
"I'm alone in the desert."

446
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:23,876
Yeah, but who else's footprints
are those?

447
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,080
You know, one of those things.
But-but look.

448
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:30,217
This is pretty cool.

449
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,252
And it does feel pretty cool
to be walking...

450
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:34,230
Well, I'll tell you this:
I'm having a lot more fun

451
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:36,489
walking forward than
the cameraperson is

452
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:38,791
walking backwards, I'm sure.

453
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,062
Was that a groan?

454
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,930
Yes, it was.

455
00:21:43,964 --> 00:21:46,933
<i>We went from Japan to Vietnam.</i>

456
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:54,873
<i>That's when things started
to kick in to a different gear.</i>

457
00:21:59,546 --> 00:22:01,381
My good friend
Phillipe lajaunie,

458
00:22:01,414 --> 00:22:04,817
uh, pulled in, uh,
semi-unexpectedly last night.

459
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,153
We're ready for, uh,
ready for our adventure?

460
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:12,025
<i>I joined them</i>

461
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:15,362
<i>on that first trip in Vietnam,
and he was enjoying himself</i>

462
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:16,396
and being less cynical.

463
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:17,530
Hey.

464
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:19,299
Floating Starbucks over here.

465
00:22:19,332 --> 00:22:23,036
I'll have a double latte,
uh, mochaccino please.

466
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:25,939
Oh, that's great.

467
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:27,806
Kicks the shit out of Starbucks.

468
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:33,146
<i>"I love Vietnam.</i>

469
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,881
<i>"Maybe it's a pheromonic thing,
like when you meet</i>

00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:37,584
<i>"the love of your life

471
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:39,953
<i>"She just, somehow,</i>

472
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:42,956
<i>"inexplicably smells

473
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:46,026
<i>"You sense that, given the
opportunity, this is the woman</i>

474
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:48,395
<i>you want to spend
the rest of your life with."</i>

475
00:22:49,462 --> 00:22:51,965
<i>We had common desire</i>

476
00:22:51,998 --> 00:22:54,467
to spend time in Vietnam,
maybe forever.

477
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:57,870
<i>That was our secret bond.</i>

478
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:01,508
<i>And of course, the movie</i>
apocalypse now

479
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,310
<i>was one of his top</i>

480
00:23:03,343 --> 00:23:04,577
three movies in his life,

481
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:07,347
<i>uh, because it combined
so many things:</i>

482
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,283
Vietnam and the war and-and the
book, the <i>heart of darkness.</i>

483
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:13,586
<i>We just started doing</i>

484
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,888
<i>all of this
self-indulgent film references,</i>

485
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:17,624
<i>and I suddenly realized,
"wait a minute.</i>

486
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:20,193
<i>This-this filmmaking thing
can be fun."</i>

487
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:23,596
♪ Ah! ♪

488
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,333
<i>You know, it's a big crayon box.</i>

489
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:27,967
<i>We can actually enjoy this.</i>

490
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:30,236
Why am I here? Am I insane?

491
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:34,541
<i>You know, he used to say,</i>

492
00:23:34,574 --> 00:23:36,242
<i>"don't ever let me do TV.</i>

493
00:23:36,276 --> 00:23:39,012
Thing is like, if I ever do TV,
shoot me."

494
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:42,015
<i>And, you know,
at first, it was awful.</i>

495
00:23:42,048 --> 00:23:43,483
Where do cooks come from?

496
00:23:43,516 --> 00:23:46,919
<i>The answer to this
and other questions to follow.</i>

497
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:48,355
And then very quickly...

498
00:23:48,388 --> 00:23:50,623
He's such a good student,
he's so freaking smart...

499
00:23:50,657 --> 00:23:52,092
He, like, figured it out.

500
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,361
Chris, Lydia, I love you.

501
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:55,894
You know that, right?

502
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,931
But I got one night
in Bangkok here, okay?

503
00:23:57,964 --> 00:24:00,100
So not even 24 hours
we're laying over here.

504
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:03,002
You want to do a whole
goddamn show in 24 hours?

505
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:04,137
Fine. Okay?

506
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,973
But... forget about
blocking out.

507
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:09,242
No plan and you better be fast.

508
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:12,145
I'm gonna have a good time.
We're gonna roll.

509
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:15,115
And if you don't get it,
you don't get it.

510
00:24:15,148 --> 00:24:18,051
<i>Catch it in editing,
as we like to say.</i>

511
00:24:20,153 --> 00:24:21,654
<i>What started to grow</i>

512
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:24,023
<i>at that moment

513
00:24:24,057 --> 00:24:26,925
<i>"Tony, you don't need
to tell us everything.</i>

514
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,471
"You need to experience this
and ask questions.

515
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:30,597
"That's how we're all
gonna learn from this place.

516
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,166
<i>"It's not
you being a travel guide.</i>

517
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:36,035
<i>It's you being open
to this experience."</i>

518
00:24:37,036 --> 00:24:38,271
Oh, Jesus.

519
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:39,406
Look at this.

520
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:40,940
Look at this thing.

521
00:24:40,974 --> 00:24:42,551
Look at the roe
just popping out everywhere.

522
00:24:42,575 --> 00:24:44,144
Just in... whoa! Whoa.

523
00:24:44,177 --> 00:24:45,712
Come back. Come to papa.

524
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:47,180
If there is any dish

525
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:49,015
that comes closest
to perfection,

526
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:50,517
this is it, you know.

527
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,386
This is bumping up right up
against the walls of heaven.

528
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:57,157
Ah, man.

529
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,426
We've reached the mountaintop.

530
00:25:29,722 --> 00:25:31,458
<i>And trying to think, you know,</i>

531
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:33,092
<i>"what do I want?"</i>

532
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:34,461
<i>It would be nice
to buy something</i>

533
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:37,063
that will fulfill
some hollow part of my soul,

534
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:39,132
but I can't think of,
you know, anything.

535
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:41,968
Maybe a car will do it.
I-I don't know.

536
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:46,072
I mean, shit, my rent is paid.

537
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:48,575
That alone is spectacular.

538
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:52,245
<i>I mean, i-i...</i>

539
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:53,780
I'd like to live
like a normal person.

540
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,524
That was always my thought,
that-that if I get

541
00:25:55,548 --> 00:25:59,018
enough money, I'll be able
to live like a normal person.

542
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:01,654
But I don't even know
what that is anymore.

543
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:06,759
I read <i>kitchen confidential</i>
at that time,

544
00:26:06,793 --> 00:26:08,495
and I call him.

545
00:26:08,528 --> 00:26:11,264
<i>And I invite him
to have lunch with me</i>

546
00:26:11,297 --> 00:26:14,033
<i>because I want to meet the man.</i>

547
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:17,303
And he shows up
with a-a TV crew.

548
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:22,041
<i>I thought this was a jackpot.</i>

549
00:26:22,075 --> 00:26:23,443
<i>This was one of my idols.</i>

550
00:26:23,476 --> 00:26:26,546
<i>I was just absolutely
freaked out.</i>

551
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:30,517
<i>Incredibly sophisticated,
refined,</i>

552
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,119
<i>clean, beautiful,</i>

553
00:26:33,152 --> 00:26:35,455
<i>impeccably presented.</i>

554
00:26:35,488 --> 00:26:37,790
<i>Eric's food is like</i>

555
00:26:37,824 --> 00:26:40,627
the craft
performed at its highest level.

556
00:26:43,162 --> 00:26:44,664
<i>When I meet him,</i>

557
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:47,200
<i>I don't expect him...</i>

558
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:49,636
<i>To be so articulate.</i>

559
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:51,137
<i>And he has amazing</i>

560
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,106
good manners at the table.

561
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:56,309
<i>And I think
at the end of the meal,</i>

562
00:26:56,342 --> 00:26:58,545
<i>we said we should meet again.</i>

563
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:01,047
And, um, and we did.

564
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,525
Served with foie gras
mousse and notes of...

565
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:19,299
<i>I think
what was not a struggle...</i>

566
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:21,167
<i>I don't know if "struggle"
is the right word,</i>

567
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,703
but the challenge
was to be real,

568
00:27:23,736 --> 00:27:25,838
stay real, and at the same time,

569
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:27,840
<i>be the host of a TV show.</i>

570
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:29,709
<i>You have to</i>

571
00:27:29,742 --> 00:27:31,511
exaggerate a little bit.

572
00:27:31,544 --> 00:27:33,580
This is like
driving a Rolls-Royce naked

573
00:27:33,613 --> 00:27:35,481
in mink underpants.

574
00:27:38,217 --> 00:27:42,722
Just so over-the-top luxurious.

575
00:27:42,755 --> 00:27:44,290
<i>I think the person</i>

576
00:27:44,324 --> 00:27:46,326
<i>that people experienced
on camera was</i>

577
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,428
<i>someone who seemingly had
this incredible ability</i>

578
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:51,497
<i>to engage with
anybody he came across.</i>

579
00:27:51,531 --> 00:27:53,733
It's like
the UN-muscled James Bond

580
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:55,735
who could kind of swan
into scenes.

581
00:27:55,768 --> 00:27:59,772
There was that persona
that was created over time.

582
00:27:59,806 --> 00:28:01,808
<i>I am looking for</i>

583
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:04,344
<i>extremes of emotion
and experience.</i>

584
00:28:04,377 --> 00:28:06,746
<i>I'll try anything.
I'll risk everything.</i>

585
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,215
<i>I have nothing to lose.</i>

586
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,284
<i>The story was</i> a cook's tour

587
00:28:11,317 --> 00:28:12,752
was about a guy
who smoke and drank

588
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:14,220
and ate his way
around the world.

589
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:15,655
That was true.

590
00:28:15,688 --> 00:28:17,223
Part of the pitch was,

591
00:28:17,256 --> 00:28:19,659
"and he's gonna eat
really weird shit, too."

592
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,229
Let's-let's do the nasty.

593
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:25,365
They don't seem to have
their mise en place together.

594
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:26,642
I have my mise en place together

595
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,267
when I'm making steak frites.

596
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:29,745
It seems to me, you know,
when you're making live cobra,

597
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:32,238
you know, you should have
your operating stuff laid out.

598
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:34,374
You know, where's the
cutting board, the knife?

599
00:28:35,608 --> 00:28:36,643
Scissors?

600
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:38,344
<i>You know, eating</i>

601
00:28:38,378 --> 00:28:41,214
<i>those kind of things was
for camera, was for network,</i>

602
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:43,182
<i>was for all the reasons
people do that.</i>

603
00:28:43,216 --> 00:28:44,283
<i>It's like, you know,</i>

604
00:28:44,317 --> 00:28:45,585
it's a little salacious,

605
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:47,687
like he's eating
a live, beating cobra heart.

606
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:50,523
Cheers, folks.

607
00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:55,428
Feels strong.

608
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:57,463
It kind of pumps
on its way down, too.

609
00:28:57,497 --> 00:28:59,298
<i>And I think that persona</i>

610
00:28:59,332 --> 00:29:02,468
<i>followed him for a number
of years, but over time,</i>

611
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:05,638
that burned off
and it became Tony.

612
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:17,817
<i>Going back
to the ancestral homeland,</i>

613
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,586
<i>and maybe we'll discover
some things along the way.</i>

614
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,490
So this is my father
and a little friend in France

615
00:29:24,524 --> 00:29:26,426
in a little oyster village
in the gironde.

616
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:28,294
This is one of
my favorite pictures, also.

617
00:29:28,327 --> 00:29:32,231
Uh, my brother and I
in the same spot.

618
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:36,302
<i>We didn't do a lot of travel</i>

619
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:38,404
<i>when we were kids 'cause
my parents were not rich.</i>

620
00:29:38,438 --> 00:29:39,848
We did go to France
a couple of times

621
00:29:39,872 --> 00:29:41,340
because my dad
had relatives there.

622
00:29:44,011 --> 00:29:46,446
I'm nervous.

623
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:48,548
Whoever thought
we'd do something this goofy?

624
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:49,582
This isn't goofy.

625
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,852
<i>Our childhood as American kids,</i>

626
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:54,420
<i>we really got into tintin books,</i>

627
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:56,889
which Americans say "tin-tin."

628
00:29:56,923 --> 00:30:00,393
<i>This was a graphic novel
about this young reporter</i>

629
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:02,662
<i>who travels all around the world</i>

630
00:30:02,695 --> 00:30:05,765
<i>and ends up with all of these
amazing adventures.</i>

631
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:08,343
<i>I think it was actually,
in some ways,</i>

632
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:09,478
an inspiration for Tony's life.

633
00:30:09,502 --> 00:30:11,337
This is an oyster boat

634
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,741
similar to the one
on which I had my first oyster.

635
00:30:14,774 --> 00:30:16,642
<i>"I blame my first oyster</i>

<i>"I was miserable and angry."</i>

639
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:28,064

<i>or being tied to fame,

724
00:34:17,117 --> 00:34:18,651
was like a rebirth for Tony.

725
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:20,553
It was like he died
and-and was reborn.

726
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:22,990
I mean, this was a new person
with a new life.

00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:08,868
That dying glow
in the background is, uh,

734
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,903
I think the fuel depot
from the airport...

735
00:35:10,937 --> 00:35:13,340
<i>There we are
on the balcony in my room,</i>

738
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:23,649

<i>and we shot two scenes,</i>

742
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:35,861
and then shit went south
really fast.

743
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:39,099
<i>There was
a border incident with Israel.</i>

744
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:42,668
<i>Hezbollah had kidnapped
some Israeli soldiers,</i>

745
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:45,838

we got caught up in a war.</i>

746
00:35:48,674 --> 00:35:50,944
Hold on. Let me, uh...

747
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:53,679
Todd, exactly how disgusted
and anxious are you?

748
00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:55,982
We're damn lucky to be here.

749
00:35:56,016 --> 00:35:57,917
We're spending all
this time at the pool,

750
00:35:57,951 --> 00:36:00,653
watching helicopters
come in and out.

751
00:36:00,686 --> 00:36:03,856
<i>It was just
a waiting game for us.</i>

752
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:05,092
We had to go in the basement

753
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,194
because there was
a lot of bombs by us.

754
00:36:07,227 --> 00:36:09,029
They knocked down our house.

755
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,932
You know, look at us
in those scenes.

756
00:36:11,965 --> 00:36:13,376
You know,
we're sitting around the pool,

757
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,235
<i>getting tan,</i>

758
00:36:15,268 --> 00:36:17,770
<i>you know, watching a war.</i>

759
00:36:19,206 --> 00:36:23,043
If there's a single metaphor
in this entire experience,

760
00:36:23,076 --> 00:36:24,777
that...

761
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,013
You know, that's probably it.

762
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:30,050
Not a flattering one.

763
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:43,130
<i>When they arrived back,</i>

764
00:36:43,163 --> 00:36:45,664
<i>the first thing he said was,</i>

765
00:36:45,698 --> 00:36:47,267
"we cannot make a show
out of this.

766
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,037
<i>I refuse to exploit
this experience in that way."</i>

767
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:53,639
Needless to say,
the network saw it differently.

768
00:36:54,874 --> 00:36:57,410
There's just no neat sum-up
to the story.

769
00:36:57,444 --> 00:37:00,880
<i>He stopped doing the...</i>

770
00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:04,683
Rosy sum-up of what we just saw.

771
00:37:04,717 --> 00:37:05,918
He just stopped.

772
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,131
<i>In the few years
since I've started</i>

773
00:37:08,155 --> 00:37:11,757
<i>to travel this world,
I'd found myself changing.</i>

774
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,294
<i>I'd begun to believe
that the dinner table was</i>

775
00:37:14,327 --> 00:37:16,296
<i>the great leveler.</i>

776
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:18,831
<i>Now I'm not so sure.</i>

777
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:21,168
<i>Maybe the world's
not like that at all.</i>

778
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:24,404
<i>Maybe in the real world,
the one without cameras</i>

779
00:37:24,437 --> 00:37:26,006
<i>and happy food and travel shows,</i>

780
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:29,775
<i>everybody, the good
and the bad together,</i>

781
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:33,046
<i>are all crushed
under the same terrible wheel.</i>

782
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,381
<i>I hope...</i>

783
00:37:34,414 --> 00:37:37,150
<i>I really hope
I'm wrong about that.</i>

784
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:42,922
<i>That ambiguity,</i>

785
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:45,091
<i>that's what he embraced.</i>

786
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:48,861
Fucking open-endedness
is where the answers are.

787
00:37:50,497 --> 00:37:52,933
<i>It was
an embittering experience.</i>

788
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:55,502
<i>It got all of us
thinking about, you know,</i>

789
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:57,703
<i>what's important in life.</i>

790
00:38:00,006 --> 00:38:02,075
Oh, it's recording.

791
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:03,343
Oh, my god.

792
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:05,811
You look like an idiot.

793
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:10,217
Come on, say something,
Mr. Anthony bourdain.

794
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,052
This is, uh, our vacation video,

795
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:13,429
and we're gonna show this
to our children.

796
00:38:13,453 --> 00:38:14,820
Welcome to my video.

797
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:17,524
Welcome to my first
independent film.

798
00:38:17,557 --> 00:38:20,093
My spring vacation.

799
00:38:22,128 --> 00:38:23,363
Ow, ow, ow!

800
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:25,098
Come on, I'm driving.

801
00:38:25,131 --> 00:38:27,133
How do you say that in English?

802
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:28,368
Is this a bad thing?

803
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:31,504
<i>Tony was single,</i>

804
00:38:31,538 --> 00:38:33,273
<i>and ottavia worked for me.</i>

805
00:38:33,306 --> 00:38:35,976
Tony called me and he-he said,
"who is this girl, ottavia?"

806
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:37,978
And I said, "well, have fun."

807
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:40,913
<i>You know,
don't take it seriously."</i>

808
00:38:40,947 --> 00:38:43,049
Eric thought, you know,

809
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:46,386
we were the perfect match
for those

810
00:38:46,419 --> 00:38:50,257
occasional,
you know, rendezvous.

811
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,858
You drive like grandma.

812
00:38:52,891 --> 00:38:54,537
What do you mean?
Does grandma drive like this?

813
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:55,996
Oh, here, look, no hands.

814
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:58,098
Oh, yeah.

815
00:38:58,131 --> 00:39:00,000
<i>I thought he was gonna be this</i>

816
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:03,136
<i>bad boy, a little bit arrogant,</i>

817
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:07,240
and not what I was expecting
but endearing nonetheless.

818
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:10,277
Perfetto.

819
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,012
But you know
what the show's about?

820
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:14,080
- No.
- It's about a,

821
00:39:14,114 --> 00:39:16,549
about a existential crossroads
in my life.

822
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:18,118
You look bored already.

823
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:19,852
I am.

824
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:21,288
<i>You saw
they were pretty smitten.</i>

825
00:39:21,321 --> 00:39:22,555
<i>I mean, he always has</i>

826
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:25,959
really appreciated
very strong women.

827
00:39:25,992 --> 00:39:27,893
<i>She would cut him no slack.</i>

828
00:39:27,926 --> 00:39:29,562
This is a load of.

829
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:31,464
What are the chances
this scene is gonna end up

830
00:39:31,498 --> 00:39:33,466
- on the cutting room floor?
- Zero.

831
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,035
Even if we fight.

832
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:37,003
Now, that would be
good television, see?

833
00:39:37,037 --> 00:39:39,072
We should fight.

834
00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:41,041
<i>A couple of months later,</i>

835
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:42,942
<i>we are in a restaurant,
and she's toasting him</i>

836
00:39:42,976 --> 00:39:46,912
at the table,
and I see tears in his eyes.

837
00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:48,381
Real tears.

838
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:51,117
And we're like,
"oh, my god, he's in love."

839
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:54,287
Okay, let's do
some romantic thing.

840
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:55,422
What, like... no.

841
00:39:55,455 --> 00:39:57,324
Get that...

842
00:39:57,357 --> 00:40:00,026
<i>Tony was like the teenagers,</i>

843
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,995
<i>like, falling in love
for the first time.</i>

844
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:04,064
<i>They changed their clothes
and the music</i>

845
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:06,865
<i>that they're listening to, and
pieces of him that you thought</i>

846
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:10,203
you knew were... shifting.

847
00:40:13,006 --> 00:40:15,475
<i>Were you shocked
when Tony had a kid?</i>

848
00:40:15,508 --> 00:40:16,943
<i>I was shocked.</i>

849
00:40:16,976 --> 00:40:18,411
<i>I had asked him</i>

850
00:40:18,445 --> 00:40:20,947
how come he didn't have kids,
and he's like...

851
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:25,851
"It's just not something
I ever see myself doing, ever."

852
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:28,655
<i>For most of my life,</i>

853
00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:30,623
<i>I wouldn't have been
a good father.</i>

854
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:33,626
<i>Too self-involved,
too messed-up on drugs.</i>

855
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,329
<i>And also afraid.</i>

856
00:40:36,363 --> 00:40:38,965
<i>The thought of being

857
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:42,936
<i>you know, I was not
up to that kind of fear.</i>

858
00:40:44,304 --> 00:40:48,108
Any doubts I might have had
kind of dissipated

859
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:53,113
when I realized how happy,
how happy, excited he was

860
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:56,015
that he was gonna
become a father.

861
00:40:57,016 --> 00:41:00,253
- No phone.
- No phone?

862
00:41:02,422 --> 00:41:05,024
Okay. Okay. That's okay.

863
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:07,694
- That's okay?
- That's okay.

864
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:10,663
- Yeah? It's okay, dada?
- Come on. Come on.

865
00:41:10,697 --> 00:41:13,066
- Okay, a little hug?
- Come on.

866
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:16,002
Come on, now. Okay, okay.

- Appa.
- Appa? What about your appa?

870
00:41:28,548 --> 00:41:30,150

- ♪ 'bout the doctor. ♪

873
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:35,688
But what does
the doctor look like?

874
00:41:38,024 --> 00:41:40,126
Well, hello. I'm Dr. Tony.

875
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,494
What seems to be
the problem here?

876
00:41:42,729 --> 00:41:44,731
I'm here to help you
get all better.

877
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:46,366
- Hooray!
- Yeah!

878
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:48,468
We should help all people

879
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:51,171
Hey, that reminds me,
I have to get back.

880
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:54,441
Bye.

to her summer camp.

885
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,383
You know, I have a few minutes
of normal family life,

886
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:05,185
then I, like, take
the elevator downstairs,

887
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:06,619
and there's yet another...

888
00:42:06,653 --> 00:42:08,555
Yo, Anthony!
How you doing, boss?

889
00:42:08,588 --> 00:42:10,323
Hey, what's up, man?

890
00:42:13,393 --> 00:42:15,462
Are you on the job?

891
00:42:15,495 --> 00:42:18,598
Yo, this guy's got
the best show on TV.

892
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:22,702
<i>Tony got really famous.</i>

893
00:42:22,735 --> 00:42:24,771
Like, every two minutes,
it seemed,

894
00:42:24,804 --> 00:42:26,706
someone's going up to him.

895
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:28,208
"Hey."

896
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,776
You know, "Tony, I'm a huge fan."

<i>I'm food bad boy Tony bourdain.</i>

905
00:42:55,134 --> 00:42:57,604
There's nowhere I won't go
and nothing I won't eat,

906
00:42:57,637 --> 00:43:00,273
as long as I'm paid in emeralds
and my hotel room has

907
00:43:00,306 --> 00:43:02,242
a bidet that shoots
warm champagne.

908
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:05,678
Ladies and

00:43:46,452 --> 00:43:49,389
Do you have anything

918
00:43:49,422 --> 00:43:50,390
No.

919
00:43:50,423 --> 00:43:53,426
I'm asking this 'cause
the answer for me is no.

920
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:57,163
I want to say no, 'cause
I just visited my friends.

921
00:43:57,196 --> 00:43:59,799
I haven't seen them
in many years.

922
00:43:59,832 --> 00:44:01,568
- Right.
- And I felt I just...

923
00:44:01,601 --> 00:44:03,136
I couldn't relate.

924
00:44:03,169 --> 00:44:04,580
- I mean, it's like...
- I know, I know.

925
00:44:04,604 --> 00:44:07,473

but-but, but... yeah.

926
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:09,342
I'm a freak.

927
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:11,144
- They only...
- Fucking hell. Jesus.

928
00:44:11,177 --> 00:44:12,712
Oh, is this so interesting?

929
00:44:12,745 --> 00:44:14,447
What are we waiting for?

930
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,848
Is there...

931
00:44:15,882 --> 00:44:17,584
We're always at the ready.

932
00:44:17,617 --> 00:44:20,486
I'm about to give birth
to a big fucking alien baby

933
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,487
at any moment.

934
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:23,189
It's-it's gonna be huge.

935
00:44:23,222 --> 00:44:24,733
All right,
why don't we take five, then.

936
00:44:24,757 --> 00:44:27,760
- Take five.
- Holy crap. Jesus.

937
00:44:27,794 --> 00:44:29,362
And you're...

938
00:44:29,395 --> 00:44:31,798
How many days of
straight shooting you have?

939
00:44:33,633 --> 00:44:35,301
Don't ask me that.

<i>The international

00:45:24,584 --> 00:45:27,253
Tom vitale was arrested
in Amsterdam just recently.

942
00:45:27,286 --> 00:45:29,322
On examination
at the local precinct,

943
00:45:29,355 --> 00:45:30,657
they found he'd swallowed

944
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,559
<i>a record-breaking
90 bolitas of cocaine.</i>

945
00:45:34,962 --> 00:45:38,264
<i>What made it into the shows was,</i>

946
00:45:38,297 --> 00:45:40,800
as far as I was concerned,
the least interesting...

947
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,802
Parts of the trip.

948
00:45:42,835 --> 00:45:46,773
Welcome to another episode
of <i>24-hour fuck-over.</i>

949
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:53,880
<i>He was a control freak
in a lot of ways.</i>

950
00:45:53,913 --> 00:45:56,416
<i>You couldn't win
an argument with him.</i>

951
00:45:56,449 --> 00:45:59,485
Just because there was an idea,
he would challenge it.

952
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:00,920
Do you have any lines for me?

953
00:46:00,954 --> 00:46:02,588
Maybe you can feed me something.

954
00:46:03,556 --> 00:46:05,858
Rome at dusk. There's really
no place like it, is there?

955
00:46:05,892 --> 00:46:08,261
Uh, romance is in the air.

956
00:46:08,294 --> 00:46:09,438
- Who says that?
- We're here for two days.

957
00:46:09,462 --> 00:46:10,998
When?
When at any point in my life

958
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:12,632
have I ever said that?

959
00:46:12,665 --> 00:46:14,935
Occasionally you feel inspired
and you say something

960
00:46:14,968 --> 00:46:17,971
really nice
that makes me tear up.

961
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:20,406
Not today, I guess.

962
00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:24,711
<i>Well, I would say his barometer</i>

963
00:46:24,744 --> 00:46:26,455
<i>for bullshit in general
was extremely sensitive.</i>

964
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:28,414
But if he felt
we were bullshitting,

965
00:46:28,448 --> 00:46:30,717
I mean, that's like kind of
the ultimate sin, right?

966
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,719
You're gonna walk down
along the canal...

967
00:46:32,752 --> 00:46:34,253
<i>You'd have to sort of</i>

968
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:36,289
<i>lead from behind with him.</i>

969
00:46:36,322 --> 00:46:39,258
What kind of
fascist regime is this?

970
00:46:39,292 --> 00:46:41,327
<i>Because when Tony
wanted to leave,</i>

971
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,729
<i>Tony would leave.</i>

972
00:46:42,762 --> 00:46:45,465
<i>I mean, stopping him
had to be physical.</i>

973
00:46:45,498 --> 00:46:49,469
Like putting my body in between
him and the escape route.

974
00:46:49,502 --> 00:46:51,871
Keep him away from me.

975
00:46:51,904 --> 00:46:53,840
No, no, no.

976
00:47:02,315 --> 00:47:03,883
Yeah, I've had enough, man.

977
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:06,352
Too, too fucked-up.

978
00:47:07,453 --> 00:47:09,722
Well, my day's ruined.

979
00:47:13,026 --> 00:47:14,694
- Really?
- No.

980
00:47:14,727 --> 00:47:16,371
- All right. Goodbye.
- I'm gonna burst into tears.

981
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:17,697
Yeah, that's pretty good, huh?

982
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,499
<i>In the beginning, it was just.</i>

983
00:47:19,532 --> 00:47:21,501
<i>Chris and Lydia
shooting with him.</i>

984
00:47:21,534 --> 00:47:24,370
<i>They did that for several years</i>

985
00:47:24,403 --> 00:47:26,639
<i>and then brought in
a whole team of people,</i>

986
00:47:26,672 --> 00:47:29,876
many of them
who stuck around to the end.

987
00:47:29,909 --> 00:47:31,344
This is for you.

988
00:47:31,377 --> 00:47:32,678
Oh!

989
00:47:32,712 --> 00:47:34,982
- You might need this later.
- Oh, I will.

990
00:47:35,015 --> 00:47:37,350
<i>It was pretty much</i>

991
00:47:37,383 --> 00:47:39,819
<i>the most formative years
of my life.</i>

992
00:47:39,852 --> 00:47:42,455
There will be blood.

993
00:47:42,488 --> 00:47:43,957
<i>There were these battling</i>

994
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:45,324
<i>sort of teams on the show.</i>

995
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:46,793
- Hi, Diane.
- Diane.

996
00:47:46,826 --> 00:47:49,029
Hey! Hey!

997
00:47:49,062 --> 00:47:50,797
Zach introduced
a little something

998
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:53,066
called the-the lens change.

999
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,400
<i>I think Tony liked me</i>

1000
00:47:54,433 --> 00:47:55,835
<i>for a couple reasons.</i>

1001
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:57,908
One was that, you know,
I enjoyed fucking with Tony.

1002
00:47:57,938 --> 00:47:59,405
You know? I mean, it was...

1003
00:47:59,438 --> 00:48:01,416
Uh, we all sort of fucked
with him in our own ways.

1004
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,810
<i>You know,
it was very competitive,</i>

1005
00:48:03,843 --> 00:48:04,945
<i>and so the bar got pushed</i>

1006
00:48:04,978 --> 00:48:06,379
every single episode.

1007
00:48:06,412 --> 00:48:07,814
<i>Tony was in on everything.</i>

1008
00:48:07,847 --> 00:48:10,516
<i>Every show was something
that was important.</i>

1009
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:13,086
<i>Every show had his care in it.</i>

1010
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,355
Every show potentially
had his wrath.

1011
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:20,860
<i>I mean, how many emails I got,</i>

1012
00:48:20,893 --> 00:48:23,596
"tell editor to UN-fuck itself."

1013
00:48:24,497 --> 00:48:26,632
And I had to translate that
to the editor.

1014
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:31,370
<i>He would say that
the greatest sin is mediocrity.</i>

1015
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,142
<i>"Aspiring to mediocrity.</i>

00:49:02,902 --> 00:49:04,904
<i>"like hungry ducks.</i>

1029
00:49:05,905 --> 00:49:09,508
As always, best wishes
and respect, Tony."

1030
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:11,477
And this was written to somebody

1031
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:14,413
he truly liked and respected.

1032
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:20,820
<i>It bothered him
if everyone liked the show.</i>

1033
00:49:20,853 --> 00:49:24,091
He was like, "it should
create conversation."

1034
00:49:24,124 --> 00:49:25,524
How old is he?

1035
00:49:25,558 --> 00:49:27,760
D-Does he even
remember the planes?

1036
00:49:27,793 --> 00:49:29,562
He was a child.

1037
00:49:30,796 --> 00:49:32,498
He doesn't remember.

1038
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:34,034
Doesn't remember.
All these years...

1039
00:49:34,067 --> 00:49:36,103
<i>He was a shockingly
countercultural voice.</i>

1040
00:49:36,136 --> 00:49:39,605
<i>I mean, so many of the countries
I worked in with him</i>

1041
00:49:39,639 --> 00:49:41,607
were still dealing with
the fallout

1042
00:49:41,641 --> 00:49:44,610
from whatever america had done.

1043
00:49:44,644 --> 00:49:46,846
<i>For him, it's losing everything,</i>

1044
00:49:46,879 --> 00:49:48,181
<i>uh, because he's the...</i>

1045
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:51,118
<i>The head of the family,
feeding the family.</i>

1046
00:49:51,151 --> 00:49:53,452
<i>Um, so after losing</i>

1047
00:49:53,486 --> 00:49:55,655
his arms and his legs,

1048
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:59,159
uh, it's-it's a great disaster
for his life.

1049
00:50:02,029 --> 00:50:03,863
Uh, he wants to know if you are afraid

1050
00:50:03,896 --> 00:50:06,699
of seeing the-the reality.

1051
00:50:06,732 --> 00:50:09,036
Ah. Afraid?

1052
00:50:09,069 --> 00:50:11,204
Um, uh, no.

1053
00:50:11,238 --> 00:50:14,874
It-it hurts, but I think
that's appropriate.

1054
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:16,909
You know, it should.
I think Americans...

1055
00:50:16,944 --> 00:50:21,547
Every American should see
the results of war.

1056
00:50:22,282 --> 00:50:24,850
I think it's, uh...

1057
00:50:25,953 --> 00:50:31,158
the least I can do is to-to
see the world with open eyes.

1058
00:50:43,703 --> 00:50:45,805
<i>You'll notice that, in general,</i>

1059
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:47,473
<i>I'm not myself.</i>

1060
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:49,842
<i>Where's the snark, the attitude?</i>

1061
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:53,512
<i>Well, what do you say to this?</i>

1062
00:50:56,149 --> 00:50:58,651
<i>I honestly don't know.</i>

1063
00:51:02,222 --> 00:51:04,857
<i>People are not statistics.</i>

1064
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:08,694
<i>Surely there's value in-in
showing the little things.</i>

1065
00:51:10,964 --> 00:51:14,001
How's business for her?
Uh, can you ask her?

1066
00:51:15,168 --> 00:51:16,970
Not re...
Not really good this time.

1067
00:51:17,004 --> 00:51:18,138
- Not good?
- No.

1068
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:19,672
I mean, the country's situation,

1069
00:51:19,705 --> 00:51:21,707
people don't have
any income, any money,

1070
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:23,944
so they can't
buy food in the street.

1071
00:51:23,977 --> 00:51:25,145
So you can imagine that.

1072
00:51:25,178 --> 00:51:27,314
That, see...
That why you see a lot of

1073
00:51:27,347 --> 00:51:28,982
guys here begging, you know.

1074
00:51:29,016 --> 00:51:30,759
"Can you buy me some food?
Can you give me something?"

1075
00:51:30,783 --> 00:51:32,618
<i>The biggest issue</i>

1076
00:51:32,651 --> 00:51:36,223
<i>that we dealt with
was trying to be,</i>

1077
00:51:36,256 --> 00:51:39,658
<i>you know, the fly on the wall
and-and going into a place</i>

1078
00:51:39,692 --> 00:51:41,894
and not having an effect.

1079
00:51:41,927 --> 00:51:46,699
Like, this episode is a prime
example of just trying to help,

1080
00:51:46,732 --> 00:51:49,036
and it rearing its ugly head.

1081
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:52,172
<i>We have all this leftover food.</i>

1082
00:51:52,205 --> 00:51:55,708
<i>Tony's like, "let's just
give it to the people here."</i>

1083
00:51:57,944 --> 00:52:03,050
<i>You know, they're hungry,
and of course mayhem ensued.</i>

1084
00:52:05,718 --> 00:52:07,988
<i>Larger kids were just, like,
throwing younger kids</i>

1085
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:13,360
<i>out of the line,
and it was a very ugly scenario.</i>

1086
00:52:24,904 --> 00:52:27,706
<i>I think Tony ultimately saw that</i>

1087
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,209
<i>it wasn't just food.</i>

1088
00:52:29,242 --> 00:52:30,643
<i>There's suffering in this world,</i>

1089
00:52:30,676 --> 00:52:33,980
<i>and that seems to be
omnipresent.</i>

1090
00:52:34,014 --> 00:52:36,349
How do you spend time
with people

1091
00:52:36,383 --> 00:52:39,352
and-and-and you empathize
with their plight...

1092
00:52:39,386 --> 00:52:41,988
How does that not
change you fundamentally?

1093
00:52:42,022 --> 00:52:45,658
Whee. Whee.

1094
00:52:45,691 --> 00:52:47,160
You going to outer space?

1095
00:52:47,194 --> 00:52:48,861
Yes.

1096
00:52:50,663 --> 00:52:51,897
Going higher.

1097
00:52:51,932 --> 00:52:55,701
<i>He was traveling
250 days a year,</i>

1098
00:52:55,734 --> 00:52:57,080
and, you know,
when you come back home,

1099
00:52:57,104 --> 00:52:59,172
you have to be a husband,
you have to be a father.

1100
00:53:01,774 --> 00:53:03,776
<i>With the little time he had,</i>

1101
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:06,879
<i>he was very attentive.</i>

1102
00:53:08,048 --> 00:53:10,984
Sandcastles on the beach,
all day long.

1103
00:53:18,757 --> 00:53:20,926
<i>I think it was a surprise</i>

1104
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:23,863
<i>and shock for him,
that late in life,</i>

1105
00:53:23,896 --> 00:53:26,399
to experience that kind of love.

1106
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:28,401
Can I use this hand?

1107
00:53:28,435 --> 00:53:30,036
That's okay. Use that hand.

1108
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:31,914
We'll pull that out and use
that hand for the crumbs.

1109
00:53:31,938 --> 00:53:33,006
It's okay.

1110
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,009
<i>It moved him to his core.</i>

1111
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:38,744
<i>And I think
he was constantly aware</i>

1112
00:53:38,777 --> 00:53:41,780
of, like, not wanting
to screw it up.

1113
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:44,893
Are you really in this country
right now, or is this a mirage?

1114
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:47,954
I-I am my stunt double.

1115
00:53:47,988 --> 00:53:49,722
Couldn't you get
someone better-looking?

1116
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:52,025
Yeah. Oh!

1117
00:53:52,058 --> 00:53:54,161
<i>Fans of the show think he had</i>

1118
00:53:54,194 --> 00:53:56,930
<i>the greatest job in the world,
but it was one that</i>

1119
00:53:56,963 --> 00:53:59,099
there was no way
to ever escape from.

1120
00:53:59,132 --> 00:54:01,334
Couldn't really go home
for a day and not be

1121
00:54:01,368 --> 00:54:02,936
Anthony bourdain.

1122
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:04,770
What kind are you making?

1123
00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:06,173
Cookie. What's the best kind?

1124
00:54:06,206 --> 00:54:09,176
I don't know. Uh, are you
observing child labor laws?

1125
00:54:10,776 --> 00:54:12,811
<i>His daughter
used to do this joke</i>

1126
00:54:12,845 --> 00:54:14,323
where she would get up and say,
"I'm Anthony bourdain."

1127
00:54:14,347 --> 00:54:16,016
Hi. My name's Anthony bourdain.

1128
00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:18,451
"You may know me
from such TV shows as..."

1129
00:54:18,485 --> 00:54:21,820
Maybe you know me
from such shows as, uh...

1130
00:54:21,854 --> 00:54:24,324
<i>She knew that her father</i>

1131
00:54:24,357 --> 00:54:28,694
<i>and Anthony bourdain
were very separate entities.</i>

1132
00:54:31,131 --> 00:54:32,898
You're picking that nose

1133
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:34,301
pretty hard there, young lady.

1134
00:54:36,203 --> 00:54:38,771
Oh! God!

1135

00:54:58,992 --> 00:55:02,828

<i>You know, my whole life,</i>

1146
00:55:06,299 --> 00:55:08,501
<i>I was like a kid with my nose

- Can I get a picture of that?

1152
00:55:20,413 --> 00:55:22,048
When I find myself

1153
00:55:22,082 --> 00:55:26,253
doing that, I am, like,
ridiculously, stupid happy.

1154
00:55:26,286 --> 00:55:28,421
Like, I do a lot of
pretty cool shit now.

1155
00:55:28,455 --> 00:55:30,399
I travel all over the world,
I see all these amazing things,

1156
00:55:30,423 --> 00:55:34,294
but I'm never happier than when
I'm standing in-in the backyard

1157
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:38,365

1158

<i>by cooking aggressively.</i>

Oh!

1196
00:57:24,704 --> 00:57:26,039
Oh, yeah.

1197
00:57:26,072 --> 00:57:27,574
That motherfucker
bled out already.

1198
00:57:28,942 --> 00:57:30,377

- Well, cheers to that.
- Cheers.

1204
00:57:43,523 --> 00:57:47,394
I always think of, "yo, ho, ho,
a pirate's life for me."

1205
00:57:47,427 --> 00:57:48,561
That's-that's what I think.

1206
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:50,063
I mean, that's...

1207
00:57:50,096 --> 00:57:51,998
But you've been,
you've been touring for...?

1208
00:57:52,031 --> 00:57:54,134
Since I was 18, yeah.

1209
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:54,968
You know?

1210
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:56,369
You know, but it's weird.

1211
00:57:56,403 --> 00:57:59,105
I-I'm home for... i'm
ridiculously happy for a week,

1212
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:00,483
and then I start getting,
like, crazy,

1213
00:58:00,507 --> 00:58:02,041
like I should be
doing something.

1214
00:58:02,075 --> 00:58:03,676
I call it the bittersweet curse.

1215
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:06,413
Nothing feels better
than going home.

1216
00:58:06,446 --> 00:58:08,581
And nothing feels better
than leaving home.

1217
00:58:10,216 --> 00:58:12,485
- Yeah, you got a point.
- You know?

1218
00:58:21,261 --> 00:58:23,229
<i>I loved watching him
pick up influence</i>

1219
00:58:23,263 --> 00:58:25,465
<i>as he went along through life.</i>

1220
00:58:27,467 --> 00:58:29,702
<i>He's a great
American storyteller,</i>

1221
00:58:29,736 --> 00:58:32,172
<i>and he started off as a voyeur.</i>

1222
00:58:35,308 --> 00:58:39,078
<i>He's watching these
and detailing these great tales</i>

1223
00:58:39,112 --> 00:58:40,613
<i>of what you're seeing.</i>

1224
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:42,982
<i>And then, all of a sudden,
he's starting to live</i>

1225
00:58:43,016 --> 00:58:45,251
<i>those stories that he's telling.</i>

1226
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:47,987
<i>He's starting to look inside.</i>

1227
00:58:59,365 --> 00:59:01,100
<i>"I think I said earlier"</i>

1228
00:59:01,134 --> 00:59:03,703
<i>"that I was gonna
tell you the truth."</i>

00:59:03,736 --> 00:59:05,405

1230
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:11,211

1233
00:59:21,588 --> 00:59:24,123
<i>"Like a lot of travelers,

00:59:36,536 --> 00:59:39,372
<i>I think I now understand
what that means.</i>

1240
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,479
You want to be my pilot?

1241
00:59:46,513 --> 00:59:48,047
Yeah.

1242
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:49,649
I don't see what the problem is.

1243
00:59:49,682 --> 00:59:51,551
Weather looks fine to me.

1244
00:59:53,486 --> 00:59:55,655
I'm sure we'll be fine.

1245
00:59:57,824 --> 01:00:00,226
Wow. Nice.

1246
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:03,563
Security situation good,
weather not so good.

1247
01:00:03,596 --> 01:00:05,431
Are you frightened, by the way?

1248
01:00:05,465 --> 01:00:07,734
Yeah, look at him. Look at him.
He's scared shitless.

1249
01:00:07,767 --> 01:00:09,235
I don't like flying.

1250
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:18,678

<i>without question,</i>

1252
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,150
<i>the most dangerous place
we ever made the show.</i>

1253
01:00:24,183 --> 01:00:26,319
It was something
that couldn't be done.

1254
01:00:26,352 --> 01:00:28,597
That was a big part of it, and
we're always gonna figure out

1255
01:00:28,621 --> 01:00:31,424
a way to do something
that couldn't be done.

1256
01:00:32,492 --> 01:00:35,828
<i>Everyone gets
everything he wants.</i>

1257
01:00:35,862 --> 01:00:38,298
<i>I wanted to see the Congo.</i>

1258
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:41,234
<i>And for my sins, they let me.</i>

1259
01:00:42,368 --> 01:00:45,104
<i>This is a place
I read about as a boy.</i>

1260
01:00:45,138 --> 01:00:48,508
<i>In</i> heart of darkness,
<i>Conrad described it as</i>

1261
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:50,643
<i>a twisting snake with its head
in the Atlantic ocean</i>

1262
01:00:50,677 --> 01:00:54,380
<i>and its tail buried deep
in Africa's heart.</i>

1263
01:00:55,248 --> 01:00:56,683
<i>Congo was a fulfillment</i>

1264
01:00:56,716 --> 01:00:58,451
<i>of an enormous dream.</i>

1265
01:00:58,484 --> 01:01:00,720
In our little fantasy,
we were having

1266
01:01:00,753 --> 01:01:03,089
our <i>apocalypse now</i> moment.

1267
01:01:03,823 --> 01:01:06,326
We've rented a trusty vessel,

1268
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:09,429
and I shall dub thee
the <i>captain Willard.</i>

1269
01:01:12,465 --> 01:01:14,467
<i>Tony was finding ways</i>

1270
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,671
<i>to push himself towards his not
just understanding of the world</i>

1271
01:01:18,705 --> 01:01:20,673
<i>but understanding of himself.</i>

1272
01:01:20,707 --> 01:01:22,809
<i>Are you an assassin?</i>

1273
01:01:22,842 --> 01:01:25,178
<i>I'm a soldier.</i>

1274
01:01:25,211 --> 01:01:27,580
<i>It's like, which character is he</i>

1275
01:01:27,614 --> 01:01:29,182
<i>in that film?</i>

1276
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,818
<i>They say my methods are unsound.</i>

1277
01:01:31,851 --> 01:01:34,420
Are my methods unsound?

1278
01:01:35,321 --> 01:01:36,665
Do you think
my methods are unsound?

1279
01:01:36,689 --> 01:01:39,626
I haven't seen
any method at all, colonel.

1280
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:41,628
<i>In Congo, he got to be someone</i>

1281
01:01:41,661 --> 01:01:45,698
<i>who has pushed himself into
the lunacy of a world</i>

1282
01:01:45,732 --> 01:01:47,233
<i>without law,</i>

1283
01:01:47,266 --> 01:01:48,635
without order,
without structure.

1284
01:01:49,802 --> 01:01:51,771
<i>He got to stand there</i>

1285
01:01:51,804 --> 01:01:53,506
<i>with a three-foot machete</i>

1286
01:01:53,539 --> 01:01:55,742
and direct the assassination
of chickens.

1287
01:02:01,481 --> 01:02:04,684
<i>When you get
really deep into travel,</i>

1288
01:02:04,717 --> 01:02:06,428
<i>I think there's an itch
that you want to scratch</i>

1289
01:02:06,452 --> 01:02:08,956
<i>that is out on the edge
of that envelope,</i>

1290
01:02:08,989 --> 01:02:11,424
<i>where chaos rules.</i>

1291
01:02:12,558 --> 01:02:17,397
<i>Because it strips away all of
the functional artifice of</i>

1292
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:19,465
<i>how we go through our life,</i>

1293
01:02:19,499 --> 01:02:23,903
<i>and it leaves you with
just the sensory experience.</i>

1294
01:02:46,994 --> 01:02:48,561
<i>Anthony bourdain,</i>

1295
01:02:48,594 --> 01:02:50,396
<i>the renowned chef

01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:52,966
<i>has a new program,</i>
parts unknown,

1297
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,867
<i>and it showcases bourdain's gift</i>

1298
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:58,371
<i>for finding the essence
of a country or a culture.</i>

1299
01:02:58,404 --> 01:03:00,907
Is it about the journalism,

1300
01:03:00,941 --> 01:03:02,742
or is it about the tourism?

1301
01:03:02,775 --> 01:03:05,311
Is it about the people?
Is it about the food?

1302
01:03:05,344 --> 01:03:07,014
<i>It's a strange combination of</i>

1303
01:03:07,047 --> 01:03:08,581
<i>food, politics</i>

1304
01:03:08,614 --> 01:03:10,850
<i>and a decisively personal
point of view.</i>

1305
01:03:10,883 --> 01:03:13,753
His reports from Israel,
the Palestinian Territories,

1306
01:03:13,786 --> 01:03:16,622
Mexico and Lyon, France,
were simply superb.

1307

<i>26 times.</i>

1311
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:27,743
Uh, you know, I actually
went to tangier

1312
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:28,969
because you had gone there.

1313
01:03:29,002 --> 01:03:30,737
And you've had
a big impact on me.

1314
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:34,574
<i>Tony was very aware</i>

1315

<i>of his own ability to promote

1316
01:03:39,512 --> 01:03:41,048
<i>But I do think that,</i>

1317
01:03:41,081 --> 01:03:42,515
even though we moved to CNN,

1318
01:03:42,548 --> 01:03:45,752
<i>he won a peabody
and several emmys,</i>

1319
01:03:45,785 --> 01:03:50,523
<i>he began to question who was
benefiting from these shows.</i>

1320
01:04:03,402 --> 01:04:06,372
Okay, so we're just gonna
set up a shot with the TV.

1321
01:04:06,405 --> 01:04:07,975
Me laying on the bed,
watching CNN.

1322
01:04:08,008 --> 01:04:10,810
- Okay.
- Libya news.

1323
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:15,381
This is CNN.

01:04:15,414 --> 01:04:16,916
It is Friday, January the 25th.

<i>I'm not a news fan.</i>

<i>I'm not looking

1330
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:28,828
<i>I don't have a political agenda.</i>

1331
01:04:28,861 --> 01:04:30,696
<i>If anything, I like very much

01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:32,933
<i>thinking one thing

01:04:45,045 --> 01:04:48,848
<i>He was a journalist

1335
01:04:48,881 --> 01:04:50,817
but he was a storyteller.

1336
01:04:51,717 --> 01:04:54,353
<i>And he didn't realize, I think,</i>

1337
01:04:54,387 --> 01:04:56,589
<i>how political he was.</i>

1338
01:04:58,992 --> 01:05:00,827
<i>We tend to see places</i>

1339
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:04,597
<i>in the middle east and Africa
in particular...</i>

1340
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:07,466
<i>We only see them
when bad things happen.</i>

1341
01:05:11,537 --> 01:05:13,873
<i>If you just follow the news,
you'll be reminded about</i>

1342
01:05:13,906 --> 01:05:17,010
<i>kidnappings in Algeria,
unrest in Tunisia,</i>

1343
01:05:17,044 --> 01:05:20,913
<i>terrorist cells to the south,
deadly riots in Egypt,</i>

1344
01:05:20,948 --> 01:05:24,417
<i>and of course islamic extremist
attacks in Benghazi</i>

1345
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,652
<i>that killed the U.S. ambassador.</i>

1346
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,657
<i>All those things
are very real concerns.</i>

1347
01:05:31,691 --> 01:05:33,860
<i>But if you only look
at what's on the news,</i>

1348
01:05:33,893 --> 01:05:36,997
<i>you can miss maybe
what's a bigger picture.</i>

1349
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:55,615
<i>You can literally see it</i>

1350
01:05:55,648 --> 01:05:58,885
<i>as he goes and travels
more and more and more.</i>

1351
01:05:58,918 --> 01:06:01,554
It was almost never
about food, you know?

1352
01:06:01,587 --> 01:06:02,990
I think it was about Tony

1353
01:06:03,023 --> 01:06:05,458
learning how to be
a better person.

1354
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:09,662
You know, I try

1356
01:06:10,964 --> 01:06:12,632
You do?

1357
01:06:12,665 --> 01:06:14,467
Yeah.

1358
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,103
Can't you tell?

1359
01:06:16,136 --> 01:06:17,603
And I mean that in a,

1360
01:06:17,637 --> 01:06:19,048
in a completely
non-disrespectful way.

1361
01:06:19,072 --> 01:06:21,041
No, no, I can imagine.

1362
01:06:21,074 --> 01:06:23,210
I mean, you're trying.

1363
01:06:23,243 --> 01:06:25,444
You are inspiring
so many people with the show.

1364
01:06:25,478 --> 01:06:27,047
You have a good Karma.

1365
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,547
Can't believe you say that.

1366
01:06:28,581 --> 01:06:30,050
- Yeah.
- Good Karma?

1367
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:31,751
I think so.

1368
01:06:32,785 --> 01:06:33,786
Well...

1369
01:06:35,755 --> 01:06:37,924
- Doesn't this concern you...
- This is a good Karma.

1370
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:39,192
As a Buddhist?

1371
01:06:39,226 --> 01:06:41,061
- Look we're sitting here in provence.
- Yeah.

1372
01:06:41,094 --> 01:06:42,595
- So?
- Wait a minute.

1373
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:44,007
- We just had this fantastic meal.
- Yeah.

1374
01:06:44,031 --> 01:06:47,833
We're moving on
to the 2011 after the 2010.

1375
01:06:47,867 --> 01:06:50,636
Life, admittedly for you,
has been pretty sweet.

1376
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:51,437
Yeah.

1377
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:53,974
- Isn't that worrying to you?
- No.

1378
01:06:54,007 --> 01:06:55,884
We're sitting in provence.
It's like a wine label.

1379
01:06:55,908 --> 01:06:58,611
The next life cannot possibly
be better than this.

1380
01:06:58,644 --> 01:07:00,613
It's probably gonna suck.

1381
01:07:00,646 --> 01:07:02,782
Enjoy every minute
of this now, Eric.

1382
01:07:02,815 --> 01:07:03,683
And pray.

1383
01:07:03,716 --> 01:07:05,718
Pray, pray that this is it,

1384
01:07:05,751 --> 01:07:07,687
because if you're right
and there is a next life,

1385
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,689
we are fucked, my friend.

1386
01:07:09,722 --> 01:07:11,791
I may come back
as a sea cucumber,

1387
01:07:11,824 --> 01:07:14,560
but you're coming back
as, like, a yorkie.

1388
01:07:14,593 --> 01:07:15,963
Or, you know, if you're lucky.

1389
01:07:17,297 --> 01:07:19,032
I'll take the yorkie.

1390
01:07:19,066 --> 01:07:22,269
<i>At the end of the day,
Tony's dark as fuck, man.</i>

1391
01:07:22,302 --> 01:07:23,971
<i>Give you an example.</i>

1392
01:07:24,004 --> 01:07:26,572
Like, everyone asked
Tony's fucking favorite music,

1393
01:07:26,605 --> 01:07:28,808
and he would always give
the same bullshit answers,

1394
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:32,645
like, uh, uh, "96 mysterios"
or that fucking song.

1395
01:07:32,678 --> 01:07:34,081
- He loved that song.
- "96 tears."

1396
01:07:34,114 --> 01:07:35,514
"96 tears."

1397
01:07:35,548 --> 01:07:37,683
And he loved, um, "super fly"

1398
01:07:37,717 --> 01:07:40,753
and, um, and Curtis Mayfield's
soundtrack.

1399
01:07:40,786 --> 01:07:43,622
There's no downers
in the fucking bunch.

1400
01:07:44,924 --> 01:07:49,829
This was what Tony told me
was his favorite song.

1401
01:07:59,139 --> 01:08:01,041
He loved this fucking song.

1402
01:08:19,326 --> 01:08:21,128
<i>It's a great song.</i>

1403
01:08:21,161 --> 01:08:23,163
<i>But it's heroin music.</i>

1404
01:08:30,303 --> 01:08:32,039
<i>In the early '70s,</i>

1405
01:08:32,072 --> 01:08:33,606
<i>this is where I lived.</i>

1406
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:36,043
You know, back then,
if you brought us heroin,

1407
01:08:36,076 --> 01:08:37,743
we would've said, "ah, cool.

1408
01:08:37,777 --> 01:08:40,080
I'll totally... I would like
to try some of that."

1409
01:08:40,113 --> 01:08:43,316
It wasn't like I fell into it
or accidentally got addicted

1410
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:44,927
or, you know,
"oh, really, it's addicting?

1411
01:08:44,951 --> 01:08:47,154
Gee, how'd that happen?"
No, I knew.

1412
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:49,822
<i>He never really dealt with</i>

1413
01:08:49,855 --> 01:08:51,757
<i>the insecurity
and all the issues</i>

1414
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:54,727
<i>that put him
down that road to begin with.</i>

1415
01:08:56,296 --> 01:08:57,663
You know, it's a lot easier

1416
01:08:57,696 --> 01:08:59,099
when you talk to choe
about this,

1417
01:08:59,132 --> 01:09:01,334

<i>really shameful about myself.</i>

1429
01:09:23,123 --> 01:09:24,690
The first time I shot up,

1430
01:09:24,723 --> 01:09:26,960
I looked at myself
in the mirror with a big grin.

1431
01:09:26,993 --> 01:09:29,895
<i>You know,
something was missing in me.</i>

1432
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:31,965
Some part of me
wanted to be a dope fiend.

1433
01:09:31,998 --> 01:09:34,700
My whole life was
leading up to that point.

1434
01:09:34,733 --> 01:09:36,103
<i>In my mind,</i>

1435
01:09:36,136 --> 01:09:40,739
<i>it was my first step
towards being an artist.</i>

1436
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:43,776
<i>Do you think a-a certain level
of dissatisfaction</i>

1437
01:09:43,809 --> 01:09:45,278
<i>or unhappiness
is an integral part</i>

1438
01:09:45,312 --> 01:09:46,947
<i>of the creative process?</i>

1439
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:48,848
<i>I think
even great art can be created</i>

1440
01:09:48,881 --> 01:09:52,252
when you're happy, but I think
the best art in the universe

1441
01:09:52,285 --> 01:09:56,389
is created through
intense suffering.

1442
01:09:56,423 --> 01:09:59,359
So then, do you put yourself
in a situation

1443
01:09:59,392 --> 01:10:02,028
where you're constantly in pain?

1444
01:10:03,296 --> 01:10:05,698
And the answer
to that question is yes.

1445
01:10:05,731 --> 01:10:07,700
That's just about
everybody I know.

1446
01:10:07,733 --> 01:10:09,869
I don't know
what this says about me.

1447
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:14,773
<i>I think it was one of</i>

1448
01:10:14,807 --> 01:10:16,219
<i>the first conversations
I ever had with him.</i>

1449
01:10:16,243 --> 01:10:17,954
<i>"I was like," hey, I know
I'm just meeting you,</i>

1450
01:10:17,978 --> 01:10:20,013
<i>"but I-I don't know
one heroin addict</i>

1451
01:10:20,046 --> 01:10:22,815
<i>"that has quit
cold Turkey besides you.</i>

1452
01:10:22,848 --> 01:10:25,051
<i>Tell me how you did it."</i>

1453
01:10:26,286 --> 01:10:29,322
I got through, but,
you know, my case, it was like

1454
01:10:29,356 --> 01:10:32,392
I looked in a mirror and I...

1455
01:10:32,425 --> 01:10:34,894
I saw somebody worth saving, um,

1456
01:10:34,927 --> 01:10:38,198
or that I wanted to at least
try real hard and save.

1457
01:10:38,231 --> 01:10:40,733
Um...

1458
01:10:40,766 --> 01:10:43,303
You know, nobody...

1459
01:10:43,336 --> 01:10:45,272
Nobody saved me.

1460
01:10:46,339 --> 01:10:48,874
And he goes, "you just work."

1461
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:52,312
<i>When he told me that,
I bought into it</i>

1462
01:10:52,345 --> 01:10:53,980
<i>when I first met him.</i>

1463
01:10:54,014 --> 01:10:57,484
<i>And then
as I got to know him more,</i>

1464
01:10:57,517 --> 01:10:59,319
<i>I realized it jumped.</i>

1465
01:10:59,352 --> 01:11:00,353
The addiction jumped.

1466
01:11:08,128 --> 01:11:11,198
<i>When he threw himself
into something,</i>

1467
01:11:11,231 --> 01:11:14,134
<i>he threw himself completely.</i>

1468
01:11:15,268 --> 01:11:16,835
<i>Jujitsu was a good one</i>

1469
01:11:16,869 --> 01:11:18,804
because he got super healthy.

1470
01:11:18,837 --> 01:11:20,507
He looked great.
He stopped smoking.

1471
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:22,209
He felt energized.

1472
01:11:22,242 --> 01:11:23,842
He felt powerful.

1473
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,479
Oh.

1474
01:11:26,513 --> 01:11:28,348
Abort.

1475
01:11:28,381 --> 01:11:30,083
<i>I started at 58.</i>

1476
01:11:30,116 --> 01:11:32,352
<i>My wife is
a fairly high-level competitor</i>

1477
01:11:32,385 --> 01:11:33,786
<i>and, uh, trains every...</i>

1478
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:35,288
<i>Higher level than you are?</i>

1479
01:11:35,322 --> 01:11:36,822
<i>W-way, way beyond</i>

1480
01:11:36,855 --> 01:11:38,358
<i>- where I'll ever be.
- Yeah.</i>

1481
01:11:38,391 --> 01:11:40,227
<i>Ottavia wanted to be able</i>

1482
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:43,330
<i>to kill anyone
who came at their daughter.</i>

1483
01:11:45,898 --> 01:11:48,001
So that's where
the initial jujitsu interest

1484
01:11:48,034 --> 01:11:51,371
<i>in that family came from,
and it was a good thing for Tony</i>

1485
01:11:51,404 --> 01:11:52,939
<i>to be obsessed with for a while.</i>

1486
01:11:54,341 --> 01:11:57,377
<i>There is this aspect
of problem-solving</i>

1487
01:11:57,410 --> 01:12:01,348
<i>under pressure that it was
really appealing to him.</i>

1488
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:03,049
Step over!

1489
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:04,783
<i>But anyone who gets into jujitsu</i>

1490
01:12:04,817 --> 01:12:06,128
<i>becomes, like, impossible
to be around.</i>

1491
01:12:06,152 --> 01:12:09,990
I know because...
From experience.

1492
01:12:10,023 --> 01:12:12,092
<i>At a certain point, you're like,</i>

1493
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:14,860
<i>"dude, come on, stop talking
about fucking jujitsu."</i>

1494
01:12:14,893 --> 01:12:16,829
I don't know anything
about jujitsu.

1495
01:12:16,862 --> 01:12:19,065
Like, I can't have
this conversation,

1496
01:12:19,099 --> 01:12:23,869
<i>and yet I'm on like hour 150
talking to you about jujitsu.</i>

1497
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:27,073
<i>I mean, his attention and focus</i>

1498
01:12:27,107 --> 01:12:31,444
<i>was so strong,
but there was always a timeline.</i>

1499
01:12:32,412 --> 01:12:34,414
I don't think there was
anything that would have

1500
01:12:34,447 --> 01:12:37,017
lasted forever in his world.

1501
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:40,487
No person, place,
thing, interest.

1502
01:12:42,022 --> 01:12:43,856
I have to show you first.

1503
01:12:43,889 --> 01:12:45,891
Can-can I show you once? Okay.

1504
01:12:47,027 --> 01:12:48,561
Then you skip one
and you go down.

1505
01:12:49,928 --> 01:12:51,264
Then you skip one
and you go down.

1506
01:12:52,432 --> 01:12:53,866
Then you come back up and...

1507
01:12:55,935 --> 01:12:59,306
<i>It always seemed like
what he wanted was,</i>

1508
01:12:59,339 --> 01:13:03,842
<i>you know, this, uh, idyllic
picture of, like, you know,</i>

1509
01:13:03,876 --> 01:13:07,113
<i>a family and ordinary life.</i>

1510
01:13:07,147 --> 01:13:09,049
- No.
- Come on, you were doing it...

1511
01:13:09,082 --> 01:13:12,319
But then when he got it,

1512
01:13:12,352 --> 01:13:15,488
I don't know if it was...

1513
01:13:15,522 --> 01:13:16,956
I don't know.

1514
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:18,358
Yeah.

1515
01:13:18,391 --> 01:13:21,261
After a while, maybe
that wasn't enough anymore.

1516
01:13:25,065 --> 01:13:27,233
<i>You devoted your book to family.</i>

1517
01:13:27,267 --> 01:13:28,468
<i>Yep.</i>

1518
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:29,902
<i>The joys of being normal.</i>

1519
01:13:29,936 --> 01:13:31,438
<i>And now you've-you've split.</i>

1520
01:13:31,471 --> 01:13:32,605
- Yep.
- So I just, like...

1521
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:34,474
Are you rethinking about
being normal

1522
01:13:34,507 --> 01:13:36,385
- or where's your...
- Well, I mean, what is normal?

1523
01:13:36,409 --> 01:13:38,911
I think, you know, what does
the American family look like?

1524
01:13:38,945 --> 01:13:41,348
I mean, I travel
250 days a year.

1525
01:13:41,381 --> 01:13:44,384
You know, how normal
could I ever hope to be?

1526
01:13:54,661 --> 01:13:57,896
<i>Tony and I had been pretty much</i>

1527
01:13:57,931 --> 01:14:01,568
living separate
under the same roof for...

1528
01:14:01,601 --> 01:14:03,236
For quite some time.

1529
01:14:06,606 --> 01:14:08,907
<i>You know,
even if we didn't work out</i>

1530
01:14:08,942 --> 01:14:10,643

<i>we're still really good friends
and our focus was ariane.</i>

1532
01:14:17,717 --> 01:14:21,654
<i>That romantic love
kind of dissipated</i>

1533
01:14:21,688 --> 01:14:25,392
after he started
traveling so intensely,

1534
01:14:25,425 --> 01:14:27,293
and then we couldn't follow him.

1535
01:14:34,734 --> 01:14:37,404
<i>It flowers once
every five years.</i>

1536
01:14:37,437 --> 01:14:38,505
That's all.

1537
01:14:40,073 --> 01:14:44,077
I'll be back
before it flowers again.

1538
01:14:45,011 --> 01:14:46,413
Cross my heart.

1539
01:14:52,252 --> 01:14:54,554
<i>He was devastated.</i>

1540
01:14:54,587 --> 01:14:56,423
He was losing his home base.

1541
01:14:56,456 --> 01:15:00,527
<i>And it left him
incredibly vulnerable.</i>

1542
01:15:08,535 --> 01:15:11,337
<i>I think Tony did blame himself.</i>

1543
01:15:11,371 --> 01:15:13,973
<i>And I think
it also left him wondering</i>

1544
01:15:14,007 --> 01:15:16,309
<i>whether or not he was lovable.</i>

1545
01:15:25,618 --> 01:15:27,520
<i>Is it worse
to be some place awful</i>

1546
01:15:27,554 --> 01:15:32,125
<i>when you're by yourself
or some place really nice</i>

1547
01:15:32,158 --> 01:15:34,194
<i>that you can't share
with anyone?</i>

1548
01:15:40,099 --> 01:15:42,035
<i>I mean,
I have an email that he sent me</i>

1549
01:15:42,068 --> 01:15:43,570
that-that haunts me

1550
01:15:43,603 --> 01:15:46,473
that was just straight-up...

1551
01:15:46,506 --> 01:15:48,274
You know, out of the blue.

1552
01:15:49,509 --> 01:15:52,679
<i>"David, this is
a crazy thing to ask..."</i>

1553
01:15:52,712 --> 01:15:54,247
<i>"...but I'm curious</i>

1554
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,250
<i>and my life
is sort of shit now."</i>

1555
01:15:58,418 --> 01:16:02,388
<i>"You are successful
and I am successful.</i>

1556
01:16:02,422 --> 01:16:04,691
<i>"And I'm wondering:</i>

1557
01:16:04,724 --> 01:16:06,693
<i>Are you happy?"</i>

1558
01:16:14,167 --> 01:16:16,736
<i>I know how hard
that must've been for him</i>

1559
01:16:16,769 --> 01:16:18,238
to even write that email.

1560
01:16:18,271 --> 01:16:19,782
To-to reach out to someone
and be like,

1561
01:16:19,806 --> 01:16:21,374
"hey, man, I'm not doing well."

1562
01:16:32,418 --> 01:16:34,821
<i>The era of his life with</i>

1563
01:16:34,854 --> 01:16:37,190
<i>his child and ottavia...</i>

1564
01:16:38,324 --> 01:16:42,095
<i>I think it was sort of an
interruption of his trajectory.</i>

1565
01:16:48,334 --> 01:16:51,170
Did he change course
in the last two years?

1566
01:16:51,204 --> 01:16:52,672
No, he got back on track,

1567
01:16:52,705 --> 01:16:55,141
which was not
the greatest track.

1568
01:16:57,844 --> 01:16:59,812
<i>Hi, Tony. How are you?</i>

1569
01:16:59,846 --> 01:17:01,548
I'm all right. Here?

1570
01:17:01,581 --> 01:17:02,582
Outstanding. Good.

1571
01:17:02,615 --> 01:17:04,250
That's awesome.

1572
01:17:04,284 --> 01:17:06,119
I even brought a note...

1573
01:17:06,152 --> 01:17:07,687
I took notes.

1574
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,689
I was thinking of all my...

1575
01:17:09,722 --> 01:17:12,325
All of my ailments and problems.

1576
01:17:13,626 --> 01:17:15,361
<i>I haven't done this since</i>

1577
01:17:15,395 --> 01:17:17,564
I was, um...

1578
01:17:17,597 --> 01:17:19,799
Uh, I was a teenager.

1579
01:17:19,832 --> 01:17:21,367
My parents caught me with drugs,

1580
01:17:21,401 --> 01:17:26,272
and as part of the deal,
I saw a therapist briefly.

1581
01:17:27,373 --> 01:17:29,709
And what did you feel about it?

1582
01:17:29,742 --> 01:17:30,710
It's-it's exhausting.

1583
01:17:30,743 --> 01:17:32,845
I mean, I do tend to have

1584
01:17:32,879 --> 01:17:35,181
a sort of a manic personality.

1585
01:17:35,214 --> 01:17:37,216
Everything is going
really, really great

1586
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,385
or it's not going great.

1587
01:17:39,419 --> 01:17:41,354
It can happen at any time.
It's a random thing.

1588
01:17:41,387 --> 01:17:44,457
One minute, I'm okay,
everything's going all right,

1589
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:46,492
and then suddenly it's...
One little thing

1590
01:17:46,526 --> 01:17:49,228
just sort of sets me off,
and then I find myself,

1591
01:17:49,262 --> 01:17:52,165
uh, you know,
increasingly, uh, thinking...

1592
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:54,567
I do, I do, I do,
I think about, like,

1593
01:17:54,601 --> 01:17:58,638
momentary fantasies of harming
other people or myself.

1594
01:17:58,671 --> 01:18:00,873
Like I want to kill somebody
or choke them

1595
01:18:00,907 --> 01:18:02,742
or break their arms.

1596
01:18:02,775 --> 01:18:05,612
Uh, I think about that a lot.

1597
01:18:05,645 --> 01:18:07,447
I'd like to be happier.

1598
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,349
I'd like to be able
to be calmer.

1599
01:18:09,382 --> 01:18:11,284
I'd like to be able to relax.

1600
01:18:11,317 --> 01:18:13,753
I'd like to be able to,
you know, look out the window

1601
01:18:13,786 --> 01:18:16,155
and say, "yay, life is good."

1602
01:18:16,189 --> 01:18:18,358
- And you don't?
- No.

1603
01:18:20,526 --> 01:18:22,729
Never?

1604
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:26,799
Uh, maybe a few seconds
here and there.

1605
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:29,235
There is a line

1606
01:18:29,268 --> 01:18:32,905
during your life of loneliness

1607
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,675
or-or feeling like
"I want to kill somebody."

1608
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:39,912
I think that maybe
you should start thinking,

1609
01:18:39,947 --> 01:18:43,549
"do you really want
to change anything?"

1610
01:18:50,356 --> 01:18:52,525
<i>Do you really want to-to change</i>

1611
01:18:52,558 --> 01:18:54,560
<i>the way you feel?</i>

1612
01:18:58,698 --> 01:19:00,700

I'm having car envy.

1618
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:23,690
<i>We were both, like,</i>

1619
01:19:23,723 --> 01:19:26,626
<i>constantly talking about</i>
<i>that movie</i> vanishing point.

1620
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,962

<i>I love fast cars.</i>

1622
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:32,966
And then we became pen
pals really for years

1623
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,501

I don't know if he believed it.

1640
01:20:23,951 --> 01:20:25,518
So, what do you think?

1641
01:20:25,551 --> 01:20:27,854
I mean, in a metaphysical way,

1642
01:20:27,887 --> 01:20:30,456
- when you look back on your life...
- Yeah.

1643
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:31,891
For me, I always feel

1644
01:20:31,924 --> 01:20:33,760
this little unease,
like, you know...

1645
01:20:33,793 --> 01:20:35,695
You feel you haven't
suffered enough yet

1646
01:20:35,728 --> 01:20:37,040
- or you haven't done enough...
- How the fuck did this happen?

1647
01:20:37,064 --> 01:20:38,531
- Or yeah.
- You know?

1648
01:20:38,564 --> 01:20:39,775
- How-how'd this happen, you know?
- No.

1649
01:20:39,799 --> 01:20:40,934
No, I know.

1650
01:20:40,968 --> 01:20:42,335
I'm still curious.

1651
01:20:42,368 --> 01:20:43,803
You seem like a curious person.

1652
01:20:43,836 --> 01:20:45,772
- It's my only virtue.
- You're... there you go.

1653
01:20:45,805 --> 01:20:46,839
All right.

1654
01:20:46,873 --> 01:20:48,307
Curious is a good thing to be.

1655
01:20:49,943 --> 01:20:52,378
Given your life...

1656
01:20:52,411 --> 01:20:53,679
What thrills you?

1657
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:57,416
What just thrills the shit
out of you now?

1658
01:20:57,450 --> 01:21:01,654
Uh, this is very embarrassing,
but... it's really embar...

1659
01:21:01,687 --> 01:21:05,691
Being loved
and actually appreciating

1660
01:21:05,725 --> 01:21:08,361
the people that are
giving that to me.

1661
01:21:18,138 --> 01:21:19,672
Whenever you guys are ready,

1662
01:21:19,705 --> 01:21:20,950
- the cameras are rolling.
- All right.

1663
01:21:20,974 --> 01:21:22,608
We're ready to go.

1664
01:21:24,978 --> 01:21:27,014
All right, you're up?

1665
01:21:27,047 --> 01:21:28,581
So, uh, where are we?

1666
01:21:28,614 --> 01:21:30,126
But don't mention
the name of the place.

1667
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:31,827
- I mean, turning the napkin over...
- No. Why?

1668
01:21:31,851 --> 01:21:33,362
Well, we don't... you don't want
to blow this place up.

1669
01:21:33,386 --> 01:21:34,687
I don't give a shit.

1670
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,065
I mean, you've been
eating here for how long?

1671
01:21:36,089 --> 01:21:37,991
Since I was a,
since I was a kid.

1672
01:21:38,025 --> 01:21:41,094
So you would come in here
and see nothing but Americans?

1673
01:21:41,128 --> 01:21:42,562
Nothing but?

1674
01:21:42,595 --> 01:21:43,830
- Nothing but?
- Well, yeah.

1675
01:21:43,863 --> 01:21:45,464
- I mean, just an army of...
- Well, yes,

1676
01:21:45,498 --> 01:21:47,034
so nobody busts my balls.

1677
01:21:47,067 --> 01:21:48,969
Okay, then. We are at the...

1678
01:21:49,002 --> 01:21:50,503
So, giving up on that.

1679
01:21:50,536 --> 01:21:52,505
Okay. There we go.

1680
01:21:52,538 --> 01:21:55,042
H-How many generations
of filmmakers in your family?

1681
01:21:55,075 --> 01:21:56,977
Mm, a lot.

1682
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:58,511
Cheers.

1683
01:21:58,544 --> 01:22:00,613
<i>When Tony met Asia, he's like,</i>

1684
01:22:00,646 --> 01:22:02,715
"she's the best.
Oh, my god, she's so great."

1685

You know,
I'm happiest when life is

1688
01:22:09,488 --> 01:22:11,124
kind of like a film.

1689
01:22:11,158 --> 01:22:14,027
So, y-you're happy
in the illusion.

1690
01:22:14,061 --> 01:22:15,928
- 'Cause film is an illusion.
- Yes.

1691
01:22:15,963 --> 01:22:17,496
Yeah, I am.

1692
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:19,899
No, me, too. I-I understand you.

<i>He seemed really happy with her.</i>

1694

he found someone
he wants to be with.

1696
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:31,711
You know, I'm happy for him.

1697
01:22:33,613 --> 01:22:35,882
<i>He told me
that she was very insecure</i>

1698
01:22:35,915 --> 01:22:39,186
<i>about their relationship,
so he just asked me</i>

1699
01:22:39,219 --> 01:22:43,589
<i>to stop posting pictures of us
on social media.</i>

1700
01:22:43,623 --> 01:22:45,625
And-and I think
he really thought

1701
01:22:45,658 --> 01:22:47,760
he was doing the right thing

1702
01:22:47,793 --> 01:22:51,497
<i>to make sure that the person
he loved felt secure.</i>

1703
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:53,833
<i>Is that a normal urge?</i>

1704
01:22:53,866 --> 01:22:55,701
<i>- For humans?
- I want to be normal?</i>

1705
01:22:55,735 --> 01:22:57,503
<i>I want to be
like everybody else?</i>

1706
01:22:57,536 --> 01:22:59,082
I kind of wanted to be
like everybody else

1707
01:22:59,106 --> 01:23:00,640
when I was a kid,
at least for a while.

1708
01:23:00,673 --> 01:23:02,118
I-I didn't understand
why I couldn't be.

1709
01:23:02,142 --> 01:23:04,177
I think people are happier

1710
01:23:04,211 --> 01:23:05,878
when they feel like
they belong somewhere.

1711
01:23:05,912 --> 01:23:08,048
- I just, i-i...
- That's why I'm never happy

1712
01:23:08,081 --> 01:23:10,616
because I feel I never belong.

1713
01:23:15,721 --> 01:23:17,490
<i>I knew who she was,</i>

1714
01:23:17,523 --> 01:23:19,059
<i>but he never would use her name.</i>

1715
01:23:19,092 --> 01:23:23,196
<i>He would say "crazy Italian
actress" in all the emails.</i>

1716
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:25,631
All I know is that
he wrote to me a few times

1717
01:23:25,665 --> 01:23:28,035
and said that it was
gonna end very, very badly,

1718
01:23:28,068 --> 01:23:30,436
and that was way back.

1719
01:23:31,038 --> 01:23:32,605
Um, he knew it.

1720
01:23:32,638 --> 01:23:34,241
Oh!

1721
01:23:38,644 --> 01:23:40,546
I bring you to the best places.

1722
01:23:41,881 --> 01:23:44,117
Fuck michelin.

1723
01:23:44,151 --> 01:23:46,519
Michelin?

1724
01:23:46,552 --> 01:23:48,121
<i>His last relationship,</i>

1725
01:23:48,155 --> 01:23:52,259
<i>I guess when you look at it,
it's not that surprising.</i>

1726
01:23:55,195 --> 01:23:57,596
In many ways,
it feels elliptical

1727
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:00,000
from the-the very beginning.

1728
01:24:02,269 --> 01:24:04,271
Now, some of you might ask,

1729
01:24:04,304 --> 01:24:06,806
"how is this food-related?"
Fuck if I know.

1730
01:24:06,839 --> 01:24:08,808
I guess if I crushed
my skull on a rock,

1731
01:24:08,841 --> 01:24:11,711
parts of me will become
part of the food chain.

1732
01:24:13,879 --> 01:24:15,715
<i>It was one that had,</i>

1733
01:24:15,748 --> 01:24:19,485
at its center, um, extremes.

1734
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:24,992
<i>It's as if he can't feel
in the mid-zone.</i>

1735
01:24:28,761 --> 01:24:30,297
<i>You know, life is about</i>

1736
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:32,498
<i>finding a cliff
worth jumping off.</i>

1737
01:24:33,967 --> 01:24:35,601
<i>I felt he was like,</i>

1738
01:24:35,634 --> 01:24:38,071
<i>"I'm gonna look for something
feral and wild."</i>

1739
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:42,541
Perhaps that is
something to do with age

1740
01:24:42,575 --> 01:24:44,744
and all of a sudden
finding yourself alone.

1741
01:24:51,218 --> 01:24:52,818
<i>This is called, um...</i>

1742
01:24:52,852 --> 01:24:55,621
- Are you guys up?
- Why are you filming me?

1743
01:24:55,654 --> 01:24:56,756
This is called

1744
01:24:56,789 --> 01:24:58,624
"our wolf lady of
the wolf flowers."

1745
01:24:58,657 --> 01:25:00,027
Ah, that's great.

1746
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,928
You know, I have
a-a John lurie over my bed.

1747
01:25:02,963 --> 01:25:04,630
<i>I saw. No, you posted it.</i>

1748
01:25:04,663 --> 01:25:06,166
<i>That was nice
that you posted that.</i>

1749
01:25:06,199 --> 01:25:09,236
<i>No, I love it.
It makes me very, very happy.</i>

1750
01:25:09,269 --> 01:25:11,871
- Does it?
- Yes, it does.

1751
01:25:13,373 --> 01:25:15,908
<i>So he had a dark sense of humor.</i>

1752
01:25:15,942 --> 01:25:18,345
He wasn't Edgar Allan poe.
You know what I mean? He...

1753
01:25:18,378 --> 01:25:19,980
<i>There was
a lot of light around him.</i>

1754
01:25:20,013 --> 01:25:21,014
<i>There really was.</i>

1755
01:25:21,048 --> 01:25:22,648
Bring another one.

1756
01:25:22,681 --> 01:25:24,793
No. I mean, especially, like,
I'm away and I come back

1757
01:25:24,817 --> 01:25:26,762
- and I walk into my room...
- There it is, yeah, yeah.

1758
01:25:26,786 --> 01:25:29,722
I-It feels...
The room vibrates at a frequency

1759
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:32,059
that makes me comfortable
and-and happy.

1760
01:25:32,092 --> 01:25:33,692
That's cool.

1761
01:25:39,665 --> 01:25:41,667
Thank you.
Eggs, the perfect food.

1762
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,669
- Thank you, sir.
- Eat that.

1763
01:25:43,702 --> 01:25:45,805
<i>We were supposed to have lunch.</i>

1764
01:25:45,838 --> 01:25:47,807
<i>And I said,
"I want to go somewhere quiet</i>

1765
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,242
<i>where nobody knows us."</i>

1766
01:25:49,276 --> 01:25:51,344
And he just sort of stopped
in his tracks and said,

1767
01:25:51,378 --> 01:25:53,380
"I'm becoming agoraphobic."

1768
01:25:55,949 --> 01:25:58,952
<i>And then I saw
the pain in his face.</i>

1769
01:26:02,422 --> 01:26:05,724
<i>Maybe he needed some time away
from it all to reflect a minute</i>

1770
01:26:05,758 --> 01:26:07,893
<i>and then start again
kind of thing, you know?</i>

1771
01:26:07,927 --> 01:26:09,096
<i>I don't...</i>

1772
01:26:09,129 --> 01:26:11,998
It seemed like he was about
to go on to something else.

1773
01:26:17,137 --> 01:26:19,805
<i>His life started
to feel smaller and smaller.</i>

1774
01:26:19,839 --> 01:26:21,874
<i>He couldn't go as many places.</i>

1775
01:26:21,907 --> 01:26:24,810
<i>He couldn't be
out in public as much.</i>

1776
01:26:24,844 --> 01:26:27,147
I could see him whittle away.

1777
01:26:29,915 --> 01:26:32,252
<i>So, places like
the empty quarter</i>

1778
01:26:32,285 --> 01:26:36,789
<i>of the arabian desert started
to really resonate for him.</i>

1779
01:26:36,822 --> 01:26:40,659
<i>To just sit on the edge of</i>

1780
01:26:40,693 --> 01:26:46,133
<i>the largest sand desert in the
world and stare out into it...</i>

1781
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,136
<i>feeling like it's something</i>

1782
01:26:49,169 --> 01:26:53,173
<i>that's bigger than him
and not about him.</i>

1783
01:26:55,774 --> 01:26:57,743
<i>He often talked about how,</i>

1784
01:26:57,776 --> 01:26:59,912
in an ideal world,
he wouldn't be in the show.

1785
01:26:59,946 --> 01:27:01,914
<i>Uh, it would be
his point of view,</i>

1786
01:27:01,948 --> 01:27:04,417
<i>like a camera
moving through space,</i>

1787
01:27:04,451 --> 01:27:07,320
<i>without having
to see him at all.</i>

1788
01:27:24,803 --> 01:27:27,307
<i>"Travel isn't always pretty."</i>

1789
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:30,177
<i>"You go away. You learn."</i>

1790
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:33,879
<i>"You get scarred, marked,
changed in the process."</i>

1791
01:27:36,349 --> 01:27:37,917
<i>"It even breaks your heart."</i>

1792
01:28:02,943 --> 01:28:05,011
<i>He was very stressed</i>

1793
01:28:05,045 --> 01:28:07,780
<i>and very weary
and very exhausted.</i>

1794
01:28:09,449 --> 01:28:11,952
He did talk about quitting.

1795
01:28:11,985 --> 01:28:14,120
It happened like
a couple of years ago.

1796
01:28:15,854 --> 01:28:19,925
<i>He asked to see
Chris and I at a bar.</i>

1797
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,894
<i>It was very dramatic.</i>

1798
01:28:21,927 --> 01:28:24,965
He was like, "I can't live
my life like this anymore."

1799
01:28:24,998 --> 01:28:28,368
"I'm done. I'm done with this.
I'm done with you people.

1800
01:28:28,401 --> 01:28:30,103
<i>"Every band comes to an end.</i>

1801
01:28:30,136 --> 01:28:31,981
<i>It's time for us to break up
and go our separate ways."</i>

1802
01:28:32,005 --> 01:28:35,075
<i>"You know,
I've broken one family.</i>

1803
01:28:35,108 --> 01:28:38,378
<i>"I'm in this other relationship
that I care very deeply about</i>

1804
01:28:38,411 --> 01:28:40,813
<i>and I want to make it work."</i>

1805
01:28:40,846 --> 01:28:42,449
<i>And Lydia looked
at Tony and said,</i>

1806
01:28:42,482 --> 01:28:44,517
"then go do it.

1807
01:28:44,551 --> 01:28:46,553
"Go do it.

1808
01:28:46,586 --> 01:28:49,922
"Don't sit here
and talk about it and whine.

1809
01:28:50,889 --> 01:28:53,526
"Get up and go. Leave.

1810
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,228
<i>"Move to Italy, set up.</i>

1811
01:28:55,262 --> 01:28:58,198
<i>We will support you.
We will be your friend. Go."</i>

1812
01:28:58,231 --> 01:29:00,133
<i>"Like, if you're done with this,</i>

1813
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:01,968
it's okay."

1814
01:29:02,002 --> 01:29:04,437
I don't know. Maybe he was
expecting us to, like,

1815
01:29:04,471 --> 01:29:07,407
grab him and say like,
"no, don't go.

1816
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,842
It's not over. What can we do?"

1817
01:29:10,477 --> 01:29:12,878
He couldn't move.

1818
01:29:14,314 --> 01:29:16,316
It's really kind of sad.

1819
01:29:17,284 --> 01:29:19,052
It's like,

1820
01:29:19,085 --> 01:29:22,188
"then sit the fuck down and
let's talk this thing through."

1821
01:29:23,189 --> 01:29:25,824
And we said, "we'll figure out
a way to make this thing work,

1822
01:29:25,858 --> 01:29:28,061
you know, so it's good for you."

1823
01:29:33,466 --> 01:29:36,369
<i>Okay. Here we go.</i>

1824
01:29:36,403 --> 01:29:38,104
<i>"Hong Kong.</i>

1825
01:29:38,138 --> 01:29:39,872
<i>To fall in love with Asia..."</i>

1826
01:29:39,905 --> 01:29:41,941
<i>Oof, Asia.</i>

1827
01:29:41,975 --> 01:29:44,978
<i>"To fall in love with Asia
is one thing.</i>

1828
01:29:45,011 --> 01:29:47,514
<i>"To fall in love in Asia
is another.</i>

1829
01:29:47,547 --> 01:29:49,182
<i>"Both have happened to me.</i>

1830
01:29:49,215 --> 01:29:52,885
<i>"It's a gift, a dream, a curse,</i>

1831
01:29:52,918 --> 01:29:55,155
<i>"the best thing,
the happiest thing,</i>

1832
01:29:55,188 --> 01:29:58,258
<i>"yet also the loneliest thing
in the world.</i>

1833
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:00,859
<i>"I've been to Hong Kong
many times before,</i>

1834
01:30:00,893 --> 01:30:03,063
<i>but not like this."</i>

1835
01:30:03,963 --> 01:30:06,933
If I die before
I'm 40 years old,

1836
01:30:06,966 --> 01:30:08,644
that shoot probably had
something to do with it.

1837
01:30:08,668 --> 01:30:10,937
<i>At the last second,</i>

1838
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,605
<i>the director gets sick.</i>

1839
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,107
I had my gallbladder removed.

1840
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:15,484
Michael's gallbladder,
I swear to god.

1841
01:30:15,508 --> 01:30:18,478
So, obviously I can't go,
and then Tony immediately,

1842
01:30:18,511 --> 01:30:20,613
<i>like, sees an in.</i>

1843
01:30:20,647 --> 01:30:24,951
<i>He gets them to all agree
that Asia should direct this.</i>

1844
01:30:25,518 --> 01:30:27,554
W-Well, like, okay.

1845
01:30:27,587 --> 01:30:30,190
In-in man... in some ways,
on this side,

1846
01:30:30,223 --> 01:30:34,961
this is giving him some kind
of, like, intense resurgence

1847
01:30:34,994 --> 01:30:37,464
of, like, creative energy.

1848
01:30:37,497 --> 01:30:40,100
And so we-we ran with that.

1849
01:30:40,133 --> 01:30:41,468
- Asia?
- I think...

1850
01:30:41,501 --> 01:30:43,036
Back in one sec.

1851
01:30:43,069 --> 01:30:44,604
We're getting too much
good stuff...

1852
01:30:44,637 --> 01:30:45,972
I know, but...

1853
01:30:46,005 --> 01:30:47,283
in too short a period of time.

1854
01:30:47,307 --> 01:30:49,008
Let's mo... let's move
and-and move. Yeah.

1855
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:50,119
And w-we're getting too much.

1856
01:30:50,143 --> 01:30:51,511
It's like, I mean,

1857
01:30:51,544 --> 01:30:53,155
at this point, it's like,
to everybody, I'm thinking,

1858
01:30:53,179 --> 01:30:54,457
"stop saying
so much great stuff."

1859
01:30:54,481 --> 01:30:55,648
- Oh, my god.
- So happy.

1860
01:30:55,682 --> 01:30:57,384
Food's ready.

1861
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:58,985
Asia, the food's ready.

1862
01:31:00,653 --> 01:31:03,189
<i>It seemed like
so many years of us</i>

1863
01:31:03,223 --> 01:31:07,427
<i>shaping and creating this thing,
all of a sudden,</i>

1864
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:09,062
<i>was thrown out the window,</i>

1865
01:31:09,095 --> 01:31:12,465
and it was just, you know,
anything goes.

1866
01:31:12,499 --> 01:31:14,434
So what is your...

1867
01:31:15,635 --> 01:31:17,270
what is your hope?

1868
01:31:17,303 --> 01:31:20,140
What do you hope will happen
to change your situation?

1869
01:31:20,173 --> 01:31:23,309
To-to be honest, um,
I'm not big fan of hope.

1870
01:31:23,343 --> 01:31:25,412
Um, hope is...

1871
01:31:25,445 --> 01:31:26,646
Hold on one second.

1872
01:31:26,679 --> 01:31:28,448
Let me reset.

1873
01:31:28,481 --> 01:31:30,417
<i>In the middle
of this heartfelt scene</i>

1874
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:33,019
<i>with these two asylum seekers,
we're stopping...</i>

1875
01:31:33,052 --> 01:31:35,021
I hold my hand
or h-hold the thought?

1876
01:31:35,054 --> 01:31:36,589
<i>And telling them to hold</i>

1877
01:31:36,623 --> 01:31:38,224
their thought
and to, like, redo it,

1878
01:31:38,258 --> 01:31:39,568
<i>as if we're filming
a movie or something.</i>

1879
01:31:39,592 --> 01:31:41,728
- Uh, add one.
- Three.

1880
01:31:41,761 --> 01:31:44,531
35 milli... uh, centimeters.

1881
01:31:49,369 --> 01:31:52,038
<i>You know, breaking the natural,</i>

1882
01:31:52,071 --> 01:31:53,440
<i>heartfelt conversations</i>

1883
01:31:53,473 --> 01:31:56,109
<i>that are not
easy conversations to have,</i>

1884
01:31:56,142 --> 01:31:59,345
he would have
never, ever done that.

1885
01:32:01,147 --> 01:32:03,082
Let's go. Ready to go.

1886
01:32:03,116 --> 01:32:04,451
I'm sorry, do it again.

1887
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,189
Asia?

1888
01:32:12,392 --> 01:32:14,994
<i>What happened in Hong Kong</i>

1889
01:32:15,028 --> 01:32:16,729
<i>was... listen.</i>

1890
01:32:19,799 --> 01:32:23,703
We-we were trying
to help our friend.

1891
01:32:23,736 --> 01:32:26,606
And if that meant...

1892
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:28,741
Um...

1893
01:32:28,775 --> 01:32:31,177
Doing... yeah.

1894
01:32:37,684 --> 01:32:39,486
<i>Of everything I've done</i>

1895
01:32:39,519 --> 01:32:42,789
<i>in my life, this was probably
the professional highlight.</i>

1896
01:32:42,822 --> 01:32:45,425
<i>Between, uh, Asia argento
as the director</i>

1897
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:48,094
<i>and Christopher Doyle as
the director of photography...</i>

1898
01:32:48,127 --> 01:32:50,497
- You're gonna give me a camera?
- Hell yeah.

1899
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:53,132
<i>We really did something special.</i>

1900
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,403
All right,
proceed to smoke weed.

1901
01:33:02,609 --> 01:33:04,544
I think I'm happy.

1902
01:33:08,114 --> 01:33:10,783
Why? It's so peaceful?

1903
01:33:10,817 --> 01:33:12,652
Yeah.

1904
01:33:13,553 --> 01:33:16,089
This is the best shot
in the movie, by the way.

1905
01:33:16,122 --> 01:33:18,525
Wow, this is fucking beautiful.

1906
01:33:18,558 --> 01:33:20,293
Wait.

1907
01:33:20,326 --> 01:33:22,262
I don't smile a lot
on this show, by the way,

1908
01:33:22,295 --> 01:33:25,031
but I'm smiling now.

1909
01:33:26,132 --> 01:33:28,134
I want to shoot you guys.

1910
01:33:28,167 --> 01:33:32,038
So, tell us about your team.

1911
01:33:32,705 --> 01:33:35,508
Zach, 12-year veteran.

1912
01:33:38,244 --> 01:33:40,346
<i>Zach had made</i> parts unknown

1913
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:42,582
one of the most beautiful shows
on television.

1914
01:33:45,685 --> 01:33:47,787
<i>Tony's admiration for Zach</i>

1915
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:50,523
<i>was just kind of mind-blowing.</i>

1916
01:33:50,557 --> 01:33:52,225
<i>In Hong Kong,</i>

1917
01:33:52,258 --> 01:33:55,595
<i>Zach had
a differing opinion from Asia</i>

1918
01:33:55,628 --> 01:33:57,196
<i>on what they were shooting.</i>

1919
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:59,699
And despite having
a huge history

1920
01:33:59,732 --> 01:34:02,468
and love and friendship,
he was gone.

1921
01:34:03,336 --> 01:34:05,572
<i>When Tony fired Zach,</i>

1922
01:34:05,605 --> 01:34:08,841
<i>it was a huge red flag,
because it was like,</i>

1923
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:11,411
<i>if he's gonna do that
to someone like him,</i>

1924
01:34:11,444 --> 01:34:15,715
I mean, anyone
on the inner circle is

1925
01:34:15,748 --> 01:34:19,152
essentially,
you know, disposable.

1926
01:34:36,502 --> 01:34:38,705
Cheers.

1927
01:34:41,608 --> 01:34:44,410
<i>There was
a very sort of manic nature</i>

1928
01:34:44,444 --> 01:34:46,913
<i>to what was going on
in that last year,</i>

1929
01:34:46,947 --> 01:34:50,216
where the highs
were very, very high.

1930
01:34:50,249 --> 01:34:55,089
And the lows were very ugly.

1931
01:35:00,793 --> 01:35:03,896
<i>He was not the same person.</i>

1932
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:08,434
<i>Something changed
and became really heavy.</i>

1933
01:35:08,468 --> 01:35:12,905
<i>But he started going to therapy
at a certain point,</i>

1934
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:15,174
<i>and I thought,</i>

1935
01:35:15,208 --> 01:35:16,409
"I can take a step back.

1936
01:35:16,442 --> 01:35:18,344
"I don't have to be,
like, you know,

1937
01:35:18,378 --> 01:35:20,647
always so, uh, worried
about him."

1938
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:22,415
And, uh...

1939
01:35:26,486 --> 01:35:29,222
And I feel like that's
something that I will always,

1940
01:35:29,255 --> 01:35:31,724
you know, felt like...

1941
01:35:32,825 --> 01:35:36,796
I should have kept an eye
on him more, you know?

1942
01:36:01,587 --> 01:36:05,324
<i>He came by less and less.</i>

1943
01:36:05,358 --> 01:36:08,795
<i>And we would see him
once a month, if we were lucky.</i>

1944
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:13,499
<i>You know,
he said some shit to me</i>

1945
01:36:13,533 --> 01:36:15,702
<i>that was really...
Fucking pissed me off.</i>

1946
01:36:15,735 --> 01:36:17,603
<i>Um...</i>

1947
01:36:18,604 --> 01:36:19,639
You know, fuck it.

1948
01:36:19,672 --> 01:36:23,476
You know, Tony said
I would never be a good dad.

1949
01:36:30,717 --> 01:36:32,618
That fucking hurt.

1950
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:41,594
And I know he wasn't
trying to be mean, but...

1951
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:45,966
- Was he projecting?
- Yeah.

1952
01:36:45,999 --> 01:36:48,735
Of course he was projecting.

1953
01:36:48,768 --> 01:36:53,406
He did everything
he could to be the... a dad.

1954
01:36:55,641 --> 01:36:58,011
I think it broke his heart
that he couldn't be

1955
01:36:58,045 --> 01:36:59,579
the fucking dad
he thought he could be,

1956
01:36:59,612 --> 01:37:02,448
the romantic version of a dad.

1957
01:37:04,517 --> 01:37:06,619
<i>He was such a romantic
about life,</i>

1958
01:37:06,652 --> 01:37:11,290
<i>about anything, about families,
about life as a whole.</i>

1959
01:37:12,525 --> 01:37:16,329
<i>Life was a romantic idea,
and reality was never gonna</i>

1960
01:37:16,362 --> 01:37:18,865
<i>live up to exactly
how he pictured it.</i>

1961
01:37:21,334 --> 01:37:22,502
He was always gonna sort of

1962
01:37:22,535 --> 01:37:23,855
set himself up
for disappointment.

1963
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:35,448
Wow.

1964
01:37:35,481 --> 01:37:37,050
There's a sense of, um,

1965
01:37:37,084 --> 01:37:41,354
vastness that I'm not used to.

1966
01:37:41,387 --> 01:37:43,790
Does this remind you
of your cowboy movies?

1967
01:37:43,823 --> 01:37:46,359
- Uh, a little bit.
- Yeah.

1968
01:37:46,392 --> 01:37:47,669
Yes, the lone gunman
out for vengeance

1969
01:37:47,693 --> 01:37:49,963
would be riding
in a long shot over there.

1970
01:37:51,597 --> 01:37:53,066
<i>At that point, I think</i>

1971
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:56,569
<i>he thought his relationship
with Asia</i>

1972
01:37:56,602 --> 01:37:58,771
<i>could provide him
with an answer.</i>

1973
01:37:58,805 --> 01:38:01,407
- But anyway...
- You're right, you're right.

1974
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,943
<i>You know? His love for her</i>

1975
01:38:02,976 --> 01:38:06,079
<i>was completely pure and safe</i>

1976
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:08,748
<i>and helpful and supportive.</i>

1977
01:38:08,781 --> 01:38:12,318
Which is essentially what
he was looking for from her.

1978
01:38:13,452 --> 01:38:16,856
<i>And I think
that Tony concluded that</i>

1979
01:38:16,889 --> 01:38:19,692
<i>the way to earn her trust</i>

1980
01:38:19,725 --> 01:38:23,830
<i>was just to go in
with his whole heart.</i>

1981
01:38:23,863 --> 01:38:25,832
Please welcome Anthony bourdain!

1982
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:33,974
<i>One of the more painful and-and.</i>

1983
01:38:34,007 --> 01:38:35,976
I-I would think
interesting journeys

1984
01:38:36,009 --> 01:38:38,411
you've taken on your life
happened just very recently

1985
01:38:38,444 --> 01:38:39,879
with regards to
the me too movement.

1986
01:38:39,912 --> 01:38:42,715
I started speaking about it
out of a sense of real rage.

1987
01:38:42,748 --> 01:38:46,652
I mean, I'd like to say
that I'm... I-I arrived at...

1988
01:38:46,686 --> 01:38:49,056
I was always enlightened
in some way

1989
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:52,025
or that I am an activist
or virtuous.

1990
01:38:52,059 --> 01:38:54,995
But, in fact, uh, you know,
I have to be honest with myself.

1991
01:38:55,028 --> 01:38:57,630
<i>I met one extraordinary woman</i>

1992
01:38:57,663 --> 01:39:00,867
<i>with an extraordinary
and painful story.</i>

1993
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:02,169
Uh, suddenly it was personal.

1994
01:39:02,202 --> 01:39:03,836
I think it surprised
a lot of people.

1995
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:06,173
He had never really
wanted to stick himself

1996
01:39:06,206 --> 01:39:09,508
<i>out there for a cause.</i>

1997
01:39:09,542 --> 01:39:12,478
<i>But Tony was like,
"I'm going to make a stand."</i>

1998
01:39:14,914 --> 01:39:17,017
<i>A nuclear bomb is gonna fall</i>

1999
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:18,818

<i>Everybody's been defending him,</i>

2001
01:39:21,687 --> 01:39:23,756
but now he's going fucking down.

2002
01:39:23,789 --> 01:39:26,626
He's going down
big-fucking-time.

2003
01:39:27,727 --> 01:39:32,765
In 1997, I was raped
by Harvey weinstein

2004
01:39:32,798 --> 01:39:34,567
here at cannes.

2005
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:37,904
And even tonight,
sitting among you,

2006
01:39:37,938 --> 01:39:41,674
there are those who still
have to be held accountable

2007
01:39:41,707 --> 01:39:44,577
for their conduct against women.

2008

<i>looking at

01:40:06,599 --> 01:40:08,201

It was extraordinary.

Everybody takes medusa
as the symbol of the evil woman

with snakes in her head,
but, uh,

2023

she was, uh, a rape victim.

2024
01:40:52,578 --> 01:40:54,948
And she had to protect herself.

2025
01:40:54,982 --> 01:40:57,985
You know, powerful,
inconvenient women who

2026
01:40:58,018 --> 01:41:02,222

caricatured as medusa.

2027
01:41:02,255 --> 01:41:03,991
Yeah.

2029
01:41:05,624 --> 01:41:06,859
I wasn't gonna say it.

2030
01:41:06,892 --> 01:41:09,862
- It's only a matter of time.
- Hmm.

2031
01:41:10,830 --> 01:41:12,631

<i>And it was a good cause.</i>

2038
01:41:22,775 --> 01:41:24,710
<i>But then he became...</i>

2039
01:41:24,744 --> 01:41:26,679
Yeah, he became
obsessed with it.

2040
01:41:26,712 --> 01:41:29,648
You're talking about it in
a way that many people wouldn't.

2041
01:41:29,682 --> 01:41:31,684
<i>To the point where</i>

2042
01:41:31,717 --> 01:41:33,619
<i>if a friend said something</i>

2043
01:41:33,652 --> 01:41:37,290
five years ago
that would maybe...

2044
01:41:37,324 --> 01:41:39,625
Might be offensive
to the me too cause,

2045
01:41:39,658 --> 01:41:43,163
he would just, like,
cut them out of his life.

2046
01:41:43,196 --> 01:41:45,798
I'm pretty much
ming the merciless

2047
01:41:45,831 --> 01:41:47,600
- on this issue right now.
- Right.

2048
01:41:47,633 --> 01:41:49,635
<i>Friends and creative partners...</i>

2049
01:41:49,668 --> 01:41:51,637
<i>He threw them
under the bus without</i>

2050
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:54,740
<i>any sort of consultation
or anything.</i>

2051
01:41:54,774 --> 01:41:56,309
I mean, there was
not much nuance

2052
01:41:56,343 --> 01:41:58,711
when it got to that point
of his life.

2053
01:42:00,679 --> 01:42:02,983
<i>What I saw was him turn</i>

2054
01:42:03,016 --> 01:42:06,186
<i>what was a lifelong
addictive personality</i>

2055
01:42:06,219 --> 01:42:07,686
to another person.

2056
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:11,058
<i>And that was
extremely dangerous.</i>

2057
01:42:15,928 --> 01:42:18,731
<i>He was acting like a kid
who didn't understand</i>

2058
01:42:18,764 --> 01:42:20,800
<i>that you're gonna
drive someone away</i>

2059
01:42:20,833 --> 01:42:22,936
if you just pile on
and pile on and pile on.

2060
01:42:22,969 --> 01:42:24,713
- Yes. But-but what I...
- Really, the top ten

2061
01:42:24,737 --> 01:42:27,941
hottest things you've ever done
is park in Rome.

2062
01:42:27,974 --> 01:42:32,345
What, like... she was like,
"you could park here now,

2063
01:42:32,379 --> 01:42:34,123
- "but in an hour you can't park here."
- Yeah.

2064
01:42:34,147 --> 01:42:35,714
"We can get away with this now."

2065
01:42:35,748 --> 01:42:37,393
I thought, "this is
the fucking coolest thing."

2066
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:39,618
<i>He won't stop
fucking talking about</i>

2067
01:42:39,652 --> 01:42:41,787
<i>her ability to park.</i>

2068
01:42:41,821 --> 01:42:43,232
It's like,
"you're such a good Parker.

2069
01:42:43,256 --> 01:42:44,333
"Y-You park so well.
You park so well.

2070
01:42:44,357 --> 01:42:45,925
You parallel park so well."

2071
01:42:45,959 --> 01:42:47,403
And she's like,
"dude, I don't want to be known

2072
01:42:47,427 --> 01:42:48,928
for my parking skills."

2073
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:51,331
<i>Like, you can see her
pulling back,</i>

2074
01:42:51,364 --> 01:42:53,300
<i>and he just won't stop.</i>

2075
01:42:58,138 --> 01:42:59,839
We're having so much fun.

2076
01:43:00,873 --> 01:43:01,841
Done.

2077
01:43:01,874 --> 01:43:03,376
And it was genius, bro.

2078
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:05,845
I'm telling you,
see you at the oscars, yo.

2079
01:43:05,878 --> 01:43:07,981
<i>Saying goodbye to him</i>

2080
01:43:08,014 --> 01:43:11,851
is the happiest I felt like
I had ever seen him.

2081
01:43:11,884 --> 01:43:13,253
Huge hugs.

2082
01:43:13,286 --> 01:43:14,753
He was like, "I love you."

2083
01:43:14,787 --> 01:43:16,822
"I love working with you.
We got years ahead of us.

2084
01:43:16,856 --> 01:43:19,226
I'm looking forward to it."

2085
01:43:31,737 --> 01:43:33,440
<i>You don't want his legacy</i>

2086
01:43:33,473 --> 01:43:36,675
<i>to come off as, like,
somebody who...</i>

2087
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:40,213
Succumbed to, like, this...

2088
01:43:43,416 --> 01:43:45,684
darkness.

2089
01:43:47,187 --> 01:43:48,888
That wasn't him.

2090
01:43:48,921 --> 01:43:52,058
Like, he created something
that was so important.

2091
01:43:52,092 --> 01:43:55,962
And I want... that really
needs to be, like...

2092
01:43:56,963 --> 01:44:00,000
That is the legacy of his life.

2093
01:44:00,033 --> 01:44:05,138
Not this stupid bullshit act
that he did at the end.

2094
01:44:09,476 --> 01:44:12,811
How do we come to terms with...

2095
01:44:14,114 --> 01:44:15,048
what happened?

2096
01:44:15,081 --> 01:44:18,251
Hmm. That's something
I don't speak about.

2097
01:44:24,991 --> 01:44:27,194
<i>What happened in France.</i>

2098
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:29,262
<i>Um, where to start?</i>

2099
01:44:29,296 --> 01:44:33,400
<i>The kind of scenes that we had
and what kind of shoot it was...</i>

2100
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:35,834
<i>You know, it was, like,
Tony and Eric.</i>

2101
01:44:35,868 --> 01:44:37,304
Lighthearted, funny.

2102
01:44:37,337 --> 01:44:38,972
Um...

2103
01:44:39,005 --> 01:44:41,274
Wow. Wow.

2104
01:44:41,308 --> 01:44:44,044
- Listen, man. Listen.
- And you mocked me.

2105
01:44:44,077 --> 01:44:46,346
<i>We're probably
like four days in.</i>

2106
01:44:46,379 --> 01:44:50,083
<i>Tony arrives, and he is just...</i>

2107
01:44:50,116 --> 01:44:52,851
Palpably sort of like
just angry.

2108
01:44:53,486 --> 01:44:55,121
And...

2109
01:44:55,155 --> 01:44:58,091
The scene sort of...
It takes a dark turn.

2110
01:44:58,124 --> 01:45:00,293
<i>Uh, they're talking about dying,</i>

2111
01:45:00,327 --> 01:45:02,996
<i>choking on a hot dog
or something like that.</i>

2112
01:45:03,029 --> 01:45:06,266
<i>He kind of looks back at me,</i>

2113
01:45:06,299 --> 01:45:08,068
<i>and we kind of make eye contact.</i>

2114
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:12,239
In-in my memory now,
it's very desperate.

2115
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:18,877
<i>I called Helen,</i>

2116
01:45:18,911 --> 01:45:20,380
and this tabloid shit's come out

2117
01:45:20,413 --> 01:45:23,749
<i>about Asia
and this other person.</i>

2118
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:28,854
<i>Tony goes over
to this balcony again,</i>

2119
01:45:28,887 --> 01:45:30,856
<i>looking over this valley,
and he's, like, smoking,</i>

2120
01:45:30,889 --> 01:45:33,426
<i>and he's kind of alone.</i>

2121
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:36,296
<i>I go out there, and I'm like,</i>

2122
01:45:36,329 --> 01:45:38,465
<i>"hey, man, how are you doing?</i>

2123
01:45:38,498 --> 01:45:40,543
"You know, is this just, like...
Are these just tabloid people,

2124
01:45:40,567 --> 01:45:42,002
"like, fucking with you guys?

2125
01:45:42,035 --> 01:45:43,079
Like how, you know...
What's happening?"

2126
01:45:43,103 --> 01:45:44,223
And then, like, he pauses...

2127
01:45:46,006 --> 01:45:50,210
and he just says,
"a little fucking discretion."

2128
01:45:50,243 --> 01:45:53,413
Right? And I was like,
"hey, man, I'm just..."

2129
01:45:53,446 --> 01:45:55,881
He's like, "no, man, not you."

2130
01:45:55,914 --> 01:45:57,916
It's like, "I don't want
to have to fucking deal

2131
01:45:57,951 --> 01:45:59,452
with this... these fucking..."

2132
01:45:59,486 --> 01:46:02,355
You know,
he's talking about Asia.

2133
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:07,093
<i>He didn't even look at me.</i>

2134
01:46:07,127 --> 01:46:09,462
<i>You know, he's just kind of,
like, just, you know, smoking</i>

2135
01:46:09,496 --> 01:46:13,033
<i>and just sort of looking out
and just like, "fuck."</i>

2136
01:46:13,933 --> 01:46:18,338
<i>I wish I had said more
to him in that moment.</i>

2137
01:46:19,939 --> 01:46:22,175
<i>You know,
Tony hasn't been all right</i>

2138
01:46:22,208 --> 01:46:23,909
<i>for a long time.</i>

2139
01:46:23,943 --> 01:46:28,014
The amount that he joked about
the end of his life and...

2140
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:30,016
He's been chasing
that shit forever.

2141
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:32,185
Potato chips are stale.

2142
01:46:32,218 --> 01:46:36,189
So depressed right now,
I feel like killing myself.

2143
01:46:36,222 --> 01:46:37,856
<i>He's a fucking runner.</i>

2144
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:39,326
<i>I mean, he ran for a long time,</i>

2145
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:43,530
<i>but you're not gonna
outsmart pain.</i>

2146
01:46:43,563 --> 01:46:44,964
I'm pretty sure that pole

2147
01:46:44,998 --> 01:46:46,499
will support my body weight.

2148
01:46:46,533 --> 01:46:50,203
- What?
- If I fucking hang myself.

2149
01:46:52,605 --> 01:46:54,307
<i>I think it pops into</i>

2150
01:46:54,341 --> 01:46:56,875
<i>a lot of people's heads,
and it's just like,</i>

2151
01:46:56,909 --> 01:46:59,878
since he knew how to do it...

2152
01:46:59,912 --> 01:47:01,614
I mean, I don't know.

2153
01:47:01,648 --> 01:47:03,950
He's a storyteller
for one thing.

2154
01:47:03,983 --> 01:47:07,287
How does a storyteller check out
without leaving a note?

2155
01:47:08,921 --> 01:47:10,957
<i>But I think, in some regard,</i>

2156
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:15,061
<i>he was gonna write his end,
which is what he did.</i>

2157
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:17,230
<i>If you look at
his last Instagram story,</i>

2158
01:47:17,263 --> 01:47:21,634
<i>he played the title sequence
music from this '70s film</i>

2159
01:47:21,668 --> 01:47:23,636
violent city.

2160
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:24,971
And if you've seen the film,

2161
01:47:25,004 --> 01:47:26,373
<i>you know that the beginning is</i>

2162
01:47:26,406 --> 01:47:30,944
<i>a series of paparazzi photos
of this couple.</i>

2163
01:47:30,977 --> 01:47:32,645
<i>I mean, it's a revenge film.</i>

2164
01:47:32,679 --> 01:47:36,649
<i>It's about this woman
who betrays him</i>

2165
01:47:36,683 --> 01:47:38,485
and him seeking revenge.

2166
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:57,003
I mean, it's-it's all there.

2167
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:01,141
<i>I'm very cautious</i>

2168
01:48:01,174 --> 01:48:03,219
to be like, uh, blame the woman
for, like, you know...

2169
01:48:03,243 --> 01:48:05,678
Or blame the lover
or blame the husband.

2170
01:48:05,712 --> 01:48:09,182
You know, Tony killed himself.

2171
01:48:09,215 --> 01:48:11,184
Tony did it.

2172
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:19,259
<i>My brother committed suicide.</i>

2173
01:48:19,292 --> 01:48:21,294
<i>I think if somebody else
had been in his room,</i>

2174
01:48:21,327 --> 01:48:23,129
<i>it might've been a murder
and not a suicide.</i>

2175
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:24,998
<i>I think he was just
in an explosive anger</i>

2176
01:48:25,031 --> 01:48:27,367
<i>and-and this was
the only way out.</i>

2177
01:48:29,102 --> 01:48:32,405
<i>When you choose
to hang yourself,</i>

2178
01:48:32,439 --> 01:48:33,673
<i>it's a torture.</i>

2179
01:48:33,706 --> 01:48:37,143
<i>Self-imposed torture.</i>

2180
01:48:38,711 --> 01:48:40,346
<i>If he was fucking drunk,</i>

2181
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:42,248
<i>it'd be a lot easier
to understand.</i>

2182
01:48:42,282 --> 01:48:47,187
<i>The toxicology report was
he's clean and sober.</i>

2183
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:50,056
<i>I think it was a clear decision.</i>

2184
01:48:52,091 --> 01:48:53,593
<i>It was a momentary lapse,</i>

2185
01:48:53,626 --> 01:48:56,396
<i>and I don't think
he weighed the pros and cons.</i>

2186
01:48:58,097 --> 01:49:01,067
<i>If he had just made it through
that night, you know?</i>

2187
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:05,205
<i>We're trying
so hard to understand,</i>

2188
01:49:05,238 --> 01:49:07,207
<i>because we think
if we can understand it,</i>

2189
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:08,741
<i>then we'll be okay with it.</i>

2190
01:49:08,775 --> 01:49:11,711
<i>And the fact
of the matter is, no,</i>

2191
01:49:11,744 --> 01:49:13,713
I don't think we get to know.

2192
01:49:13,746 --> 01:49:15,615
We don't get to know.

2193
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:17,584
<i>That's tough.</i>

2194
01:49:24,424 --> 01:49:26,626
<i>Well, I don't know where he is</i>

2195
01:49:26,659 --> 01:49:28,595
right now, but...

2196
01:49:28,628 --> 01:49:30,463
He let me down.

2197
01:49:30,497 --> 01:49:32,465
He...

2198
01:49:36,169 --> 01:49:38,404
<i>I don't think
he was cruel, you know?</i>

2199
01:49:38,438 --> 01:49:41,341
<i>And there's, like,
a cruelty to that.</i>

2200
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:46,813
What the hell is everyone
supposed to do?

2201
01:50:15,475 --> 01:50:18,111
<i>It's been over two years</i>

2202
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:20,547
<i>since he took his own life,</i>

2203
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:23,683
<i>and I still experience
a range of emotions.</i>

2204
01:50:23,716 --> 01:50:25,552
Um...

2205
01:50:28,755 --> 01:50:30,557
God.

2206
01:50:37,497 --> 01:50:39,098
It's like...

2207
01:50:39,132 --> 01:50:40,809
I haven't fucking cut my hair
since he died.

2208
01:50:40,833 --> 01:50:44,437
Like, i-i...

2209
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:46,272
I just miss him.

2210
01:50:47,206 --> 01:50:50,710
<i>I miss a friend, a dear friend.</i>

2211
01:50:50,743 --> 01:50:57,083
<i>I think about a lot of
happy moments we had together.</i>

2212
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:02,855
Mostly, yeah.

2213
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:10,430
<i>I was in Vietnam
on a beautiful day.</i>

2214
01:51:10,463 --> 01:51:14,734
<i>I looked at my phone,
and there was the news.</i>

2215
01:51:14,767 --> 01:51:18,471
And, uh, that's when I decided
to move to Vietnam for good.

2216
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:22,308
That was the...
It was not even a thought.

2217
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:26,346
<i>It was the door opened
and I had to go through it</i>

2218
01:51:26,379 --> 01:51:30,650
<i>and start doing something new.</i>

2219
01:51:32,251 --> 01:51:34,520
<i>I was listening to this record</i>

2220
01:51:34,554 --> 01:51:36,723
<i>that brought me to tears
thinking of him.</i>

2221
01:51:36,756 --> 01:51:39,525
And, um, both my kids

2222
01:51:39,559 --> 01:51:41,894
<i>sort of embraced me.</i>

2223
01:51:41,928 --> 01:51:45,131
<i>My son, he's like,
"how did Tony die?"</i>

2224
01:51:47,266 --> 01:51:49,636
And I was like,
"uh, I... we don't know."

2225
01:51:49,669 --> 01:51:51,671
Right?

2226
01:51:51,704 --> 01:51:55,408
About 20 seconds pass, and
he looked at me and he's like,

2227
01:51:55,441 --> 01:51:57,477
"I really would like to know
how Tony died."

2228
01:51:57,510 --> 01:52:01,648
I have this like hour-long
conversation about

2229
01:52:01,681 --> 01:52:04,217
Tony to my fucking
seven-year-old kid.

2230
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:08,287
<i>And I said,
"I think Tony, at the end,</i>

2231
01:52:08,321 --> 01:52:13,192
<i>"felt alone and felt
he couldn't talk to anybody</i>

2232
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:16,396
<i>about the pain that was
going on inside of him."</i>

2233
01:52:16,429 --> 01:52:20,700
<i>And I said, "you know
you always have someone</i>

2234
01:52:20,733 --> 01:52:23,803
<i>to turn to and talk to."</i>

2235
01:52:23,836 --> 01:52:26,406
<i>That's the lesson in it for me.</i>

2236
01:52:30,476 --> 01:52:33,279
<i>It's plenty
to just say I'm hurt.</i>

2237
01:52:33,981 --> 01:52:36,582
<i>I haven't worked
for two years now.</i>

2238
01:52:36,616 --> 01:52:41,521
<i>Really close to the end,
we talked, and I said,</i>

2239
01:52:41,554 --> 01:52:44,290
"got to take our girls
and lighten the load

2240
01:52:44,323 --> 01:52:46,559
"and show them the world,
show them who we are,

2241
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:48,394
not just when
you come home, but..."

2242
01:52:48,428 --> 01:52:51,597
And-and we were both excited
about this prospect.

2243
01:52:57,938 --> 01:52:59,706
Fuck.

2244
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:01,774
One, two, three.

2245
01:53:04,477 --> 01:53:06,446
<i>When I get angry
is when I think about</i>

2246
01:53:06,479 --> 01:53:10,650
leaving behind a brilliant...

2247
01:53:10,683 --> 01:53:12,819
Daughter.

2248
01:53:14,487 --> 01:53:15,822
You know.

2249
01:53:17,356 --> 01:53:20,961
He would have loved to be
around now, to see her now.

2250
01:53:20,994 --> 01:53:22,729
He'd be so proud of her.

2251
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:31,871
<i>I'm so lucky</i>

2252
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:36,609
<i>'cause she's the best daughter
I-I could hope for.</i>

2253
01:53:36,642 --> 01:53:39,980
And I will always be grateful
that, you know,

2254
01:53:40,013 --> 01:53:42,782
Tony gave her to me, you know?

2255
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,555
<i>I mean, I think this is</i>

2256
01:53:49,589 --> 01:53:52,492
the last time I'll ever
talk publicly about it,

2257
01:53:52,525 --> 01:53:55,996
because I... that's not the way
I want to remember him.

2258
01:53:56,029 --> 01:53:57,830
<i>I want to remember him</i>

2259
01:53:57,864 --> 01:54:01,501
<i>when we were together, all the
amazing things that we'd done</i>

2260
01:54:01,534 --> 01:54:04,270
<i>and the amazing person
that he was.</i>

2261
01:54:08,908 --> 01:54:11,511
<i>After Tony died,</i>

2262
01:54:11,544 --> 01:54:15,414
<i>the restaurant, les halles,
it just became this shrine.</i>

2263
01:54:16,682 --> 01:54:20,988
We didn't realize he meant
so much to so many people.

2264
01:54:21,955 --> 01:54:24,824
<i>"You inspired me
to get out of my comfort zone</i>

2265
01:54:24,857 --> 01:54:28,361
<i>and fearlessly immerse myself
in the richness of life."</i>

2266
01:54:29,529 --> 01:54:30,806
<i>"Advocate for
the working classes,</i>

2267
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:32,032
<i>"the immigrants, the poor.</i>

2268
01:54:32,065 --> 01:54:34,300
<i>This world didn't deserve you."</i>

2269
01:54:38,038 --> 01:54:39,705
And then a few people
left poems.

2270
01:54:39,739 --> 01:54:42,842
<i>"One said," everyone forgets
that icarus also flew.</i>

2271
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:46,579
<i>"I believe icarus
was not failing as he fell</i>

2272
01:54:46,612 --> 01:54:49,682
but just coming to the end
of his triumph."

2273
01:55:10,636 --> 01:55:12,705
You know, I was
an angry young man.

2274
01:55:12,738 --> 01:55:14,407
I-I, uh...

2275
01:55:15,608 --> 01:55:18,979
I forget what I was angry about,
especially looking at this.

2276
01:55:19,012 --> 01:55:20,847
What the hell
was I so angry about?

2277
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:23,382
This was, you know...

2278
01:55:24,985 --> 01:55:26,752
paradise.

2279
01:55:42,602 --> 01:55:44,370
Sorry.

2280
01:55:45,571 --> 01:55:47,740
Can I say something?

2281
01:55:47,773 --> 01:55:49,609
<i>To have him
walking down a beach,</i>

2282
01:55:49,642 --> 01:55:51,144
<i>it resonates, it's sweet.</i>

2283
01:55:51,178 --> 01:55:53,713
And I go, you know,
as-as I was upstairs

2284
01:55:53,746 --> 01:55:56,449
using the restroom,
I was like...

2285
01:55:56,482 --> 01:55:57,884
"He would fucking hate that."

2286
01:56:03,823 --> 01:56:07,927
<i>Going out in a Blaze of glory
was so fucking lame.</i>

2287
01:56:08,996 --> 01:56:12,665
<i>But we live in this society
where every great artist</i>

2288
01:56:12,698 --> 01:56:15,168
<i>who kills themselves
is on murals</i>

2289
01:56:15,202 --> 01:56:17,170
and they're talked about
like gods.

2290
01:56:17,204 --> 01:56:18,771
- Tony's on murals.
- Yeah. That's...

2291
01:56:18,804 --> 01:56:20,806
Around town,
there are a couple of them.

2292
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:22,642
I should go deface them.

2293
01:56:22,675 --> 01:56:24,543
