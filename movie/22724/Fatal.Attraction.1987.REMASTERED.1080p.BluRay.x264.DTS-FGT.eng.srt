1
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,531
There is one thing
I'd like to ask you.

2
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,287
How do they make that slime?

3
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,658
First they take some water.

4
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,954
Then they add some jello powder
and some flour. Sometimes soap.

5
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,622
Then they dump it over me.

6
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,291
- We'd better get going.
- Where from?

7
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,213
I've always wondered that, too.
I just don't know.

8
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,222
Interesting. Is it always green?

9
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,519
It usually is,
but I guess it could be red.

10
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,946
Or it could be blue.

11
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,787
Or yellow.

12
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,959
- Daddy, telephone.
- Thanks, darling.

13
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,555
Hello?

14
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,392
Hildy, I'm fine.
I just stubbed my toe.

15
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,892
Hang on one second.
Honey, it's hildy.

16
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,856
I'll call her back.

17
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:21,365
She's in the bathroom. She wants
to know what you're wearing.

18
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,030
My black suit.

19
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,029
She'll wear a black dress.

20
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,032
It's business.
You know how those things are.

21
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,912
Ellen, don't mess with
my make-up. I'm late.

22
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,790
- Is the red dress ok?
- It's perfect.

23
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:44,047
Did you hear that?
You got it. Ok, see you later.

24
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:48,767
I told you a million times
not to play with my lipstick.

25
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:53,226
So when are you gonna listen to me?
Silly girl.

26
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,686
Honey, where's my blue suit?

27
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,528
On the back of the door.

28
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,321
Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

29
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,161
Shit, shit, shit.

30
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,626
- Hi.
- Hi, Christine.

31
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,169
- How are you doing?
- Good.

32
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,764
- Where's mommy?
- Mom? She's in the bathroom.

33
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:33,183
I got you a present.
You want to see what it is?

34
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,725
Do you like it?

35
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,983
Ok. Come on, let's go find mommy.

36
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:43,439
So then,
she's talking to me about sales.

37
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,331
Chuck. How are you?
Will you make it, Friday?

38
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,372
- I'm there.
- We need you. We're in the cellar.

39
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,123
Is my hair ok?

40
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,459
- You look great.
- I'm serious.

41
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,928
- You're the prettiest woman here.
- You liar.

42
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,766
- Hiya, Bob. How are you?
- Glad you could make it.

43
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,733
Sorry about the meeting tomorrow,
but we've got a crisis.

44
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,101
I understand. My wife Beth.

45
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,978
- Bob drimmer.
- Pleased to meet you.

46
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,360
- I hope you like Sushi.
- I love it.

47
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,155
- How did he hurt his neck?
- Screwing his wife.

48
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,324
- Are you serious?
- You should see his wife.

49
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,823
They took her out on a stretcher.

50
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,743
- You guys are bad.
- Champagne?

51
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,870
Let's go. Champagne for everyone.

52
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,497
- With a twist.
- Four champagnes.

53
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,875
Excuse me. Hi.

54
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,759
How are you keeping?

55
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,673
Excuse me.

56
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,723
Jesus! Thank you. Fuck.

57
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,183
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

58
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,728
What cultural event
are we celebrating?

59
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,611
- Some exercise manual.
- Not another one?

60
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,229
This one's different.

61
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,699
Based on ancient samurai discipline.

62
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:15,371
Look at this guy.
What is that, part of the ritual?

63
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,240
Hey...

64
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,160
Hi, there.

65
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,884
- If looks could kill...
- You haven't lost your touch.

66
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,753
I think she likes me.

67
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,347
I think you're batting zero for two.

68
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:37,310
She was undressing me with her eyes.
She had trouble with the buttons.

69
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,225
A signed copy.

70
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,990
- Here you are, ma'am.
- Thank you.

71
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,079
- Can I get a champagne, please?
- You got it.

72
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,625
I'm not saying anything.
I'm not even gonna look.

73
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,259
Was it that bad?

74
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:14,506
I was glad I wasn't on the receiving
end of that one. Cheers.

75
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,225
I hate it
when guys come on like that.

76
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:22,064
Jimmy's ok. He's just a little
insecure, like the rest of us.

77
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,352
- My name is Dan Gallagher.
- Alex forrest.

78
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,987
Nice to meet you.
What is your connection here?

79
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,983
I'm an editor at Robbins & hart.
And you?

80
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,407
I'm with Miller, Goodman and hurst.
I do your legal work.

81
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,621
I haven't seen you at their office.

82
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,662
I've just been with them
a couple of weeks.

83
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,255
I have to go.

84
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,800
- Is that your wife?
- Yeah.

85
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,468
Better run along.

86
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,216
It was very nice to meet you.

87
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,734
"Obsessed with your body."
What does that mean?

88
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,602
- Give me a break.
- Give you a break?

89
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,695
What does this mean?

90
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,699
How many did you buy?

91
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,285
- Thanks again, Christine.
- Any time.

92
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,162
Goodnight.

93
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,180
Aren't you forgetting something?

94
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,523
Quincy, let's hit it, pal.

95
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,163
You're such a good boy, yes.

96
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:08,169
You did such good business.
You did good business.

97
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,754
You're the best boy.

98
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,544
Goodnight.

99
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,550
It's just for tonight, honey.

100
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,476
When you see the house,
don't show any interest.

101
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,817
- Otherwise we can't negotiate.
- Stop worrying.

102
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:36,156
- Ellen, are you chewing gum?
- Why worry? We can't afford it.

103
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,899
Just up the road from mom and dad.

104
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,244
- Another reason not to buy it.
- I didn't hear that.

105
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,203
We can't afford the goddamn thing.

106
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,917
Come on. Hold on, honey.

107
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,963
Let's not worry about it.
I haven't seen the damn place yet.

108
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,549
I may not even like it.

109
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,919
Ellen? The gum? Thank you.

110
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,923
Come on, Quincy.

111
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,936
Quincy's got to stay with daddy.
Daddy's gonna be all alone.

112
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,680
Sorry, Quincy.
Don't forget to walk him.

113
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:12,435
- I promise.
- I hope you have a good meeting.

114
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,152
- Ok. See you tomorrow night.
- Love you.

115
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,007
The third time up,
he looked like a jellyfish.

116
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,470
- Hi, Bob.
- Sorry to ruin your weekend.

117
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,015
- Give my apologies to your wife.
- David.

118
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,763
Help yourself.

119
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,858
- How are you feeling?
- Don't ask. Henry's away.

120
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,354
I asked Alex forrest to stand in.
Anybody know where she is?

121
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,776
She's on her way.

122
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:04,573
Since we've got some time, tell us
what happened to your neck, Bob.

123
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,411
That's cute. Very cute.

124
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:13,628
- Sorry I'm late.
- Dan, this is Alex forrest.

125
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,584
- We've met before. Hi.
- Hello.

126
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:20,427
- Ok. Can we get started, Dan?
- Here's the story.

127
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,261
You want to publish a novel

128
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,429
about a senator from New Jersey
who's fooling around.

129
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:30,053
A congressman from Ohio claims
the character's based upon him.

130
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,563
He's filed an injunction.

131
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:37,186
The congressman's bald. This guy's
not and he's from a different state.

132
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,688
- Without those books we're screwed.
- Fine.

133
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,029
But to prove that
it's not based on this congressman,

134
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,489
I have to know the truth.

135
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:50,742
Now, strictly between
these walls, all right?

136
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:55,211
Did the author have an affair
with mr Ohio or not?

137
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,793
Yeah, she did.

138
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,088
But she had a lot of affairs
with other politicians.

139
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,723
Any one of them
could make the same claim.

140
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,686
She swears this character's
fictitious. I just phoned her.

141
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,224
And you believe her?

142
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,603
Yeah, I believe her.

143
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,813
Now that's on the table, what can
we do to lift that injunction?

144
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,532
Can we get to the congressman?

145
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:28,661
They take campaign contributions.
Can we buy or frighten them off?

146
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:33,165
Is there something in his past?
We need to use some leverage.

147
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,641
Give me a break, will you?

148
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,142
Come on.

149
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,360
Come on!

150
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,399
Come on.

151
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,708
- Was it made in Taiwan?
- Yeah. These are tough to find.

152
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,327
Wait, wait. Here. We got one.

153
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,626
Come on!

154
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,460
Want to go get a drink
until it stops?

155
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,503
Yeah, I'd love it.

156
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,505
Come on.

157
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,721
The strangest case I ever handled?

158
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:40,521
The truth was,
I never actually handled the case.

159
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,110
But the strangest case
I ever came near to

160
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,525
was when my parents got divorced.

161
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,567
My mother asked me to represent her.

162
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,489
- You're kidding?
- That's what I said.

163
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,658
She said,
"you know what an asshole he is."

164
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,624
"You've been a witness
to this marriage for 29 years."

165
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,666
- This is coming from my mother.
- How did you get out of it?

166
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,710
Well, you can't
turn your mom down.

167
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,710
So, I escaped on a technicality.

168
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,758
- Which was what?
- I didn't practise family law.

169
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,430
It was true, you know.
And she bought it.

170
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,929
- You're making it up.
- Could I make that up?

171
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,607
Waiter?

172
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,780
- I've got a lot of pull here.
- I noticed.

173
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,197
- Coffee?
- I'd love one.

174
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,740
Two coffees, please.

175
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,665
Well, I tell you...

176
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,457
- Do you want one?
- No, thank you.

177
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,628
It's funny being a lawyer.
It's like being a doctor.

178
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,844
Everybody's telling you
their innermost secrets.

179
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,556
- You must have to be discreet.
- God, yeah.

180
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,390
Are you?

181
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,520
Am I what?

182
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,856
Discreet.

183
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,108
Yes, I'm discreet.

184
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,618
Me, too.

185
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,371
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

186
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,963
Why don't you have a date?

187
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,333
- It's Saturday night.
- I did have a date.

188
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,087
I stood him up.
That was the phone call I made.

189
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,930
Does that make you feel good?

190
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,053
It doesn't make me feel bad.

191
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,474
So, where's your wife?

192
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,352
Where's my wife?

193
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:53,445
My wife is in the country with her
parents, visiting for the weekend.

194
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,241
You're here with a strange girl
being a naughty boy.

195
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,660
Having dinner with somebody
isn't a crime.

196
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,206
Not yet.

197
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,294
- Will it be?
- I don't know. What do you think?

198
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,427
I definitely think it's up to you.

199
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,805
I can't say yet.
I haven't made up my mind.

200
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,022
At least you're very honest.

201
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,897
We were attracted to each other
at the party. That was obvious.

202
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,323
You're on your own for the night.
That's also obvious.

203
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,367
We're two adults.

204
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,459
Let's get the check.

205
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:43,320
- That was great.
- Thank god.

206
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,961
Are you feeling energetic?

207
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,207
What do you have in mind?

208
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,601
I live up here.

209
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,016
- In this building?
- Yeah.

210
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,731
Well, where do I get a cab, you know?

211
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,413
Ever done it in an elevator?

212
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,754
- Not recently.
- I bet you haven't.

213
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,579
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

214
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,538
How are you?

215
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,212
Hi. What happened to you?

216
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,758
I tried you earlier.
I guess you're not back yet.

217
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,599
I'm gonna go to bed now,
so call me in the morning. Bye-bye.

218
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,155
Hello? Dan, darling,
we were expecting you.

219
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,824
- I'm sorry. I had work to do.
- That's ok.

220
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,499
- We wanted you to see that house.
- Next time.

221
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,916
You want to speak to Beth?

222
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,758
- Yes, please.
- Hold on a second.

223
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,429
The phone, it's Dan. Here you are.

224
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,385
Hello. What happened to you?

225
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:19,891
Hi.

226
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,898
Nothing. I just had
dinner with bill last night.

227
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,649
How is he?

228
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,235
He's... bill's, you know...
Bill's bill, the same as usual.

229
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,857
Is he still with that girl?

230
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:35,244
Well, he wasn't last night.
I think it's over.

231
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,283
He wouldn't talk about it.

232
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,000
- Are you getting any work done?
- Yeah, I'm working.

233
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,292
There's spaghetti sauce
in the refrigerator.

234
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,881
Great. Ok. How's Ellen?

235
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:53,255
She is having the best time.
I just hope that dad survives it.

236
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,301
I don't know how to tell you this.

237
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:59,427
But... she wants a rabbit.

238
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,303
Beth, no rabbits.

239
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,398
Jesus Christ!
We're turning into Noah's ark.

240
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,189
Please! Give her a kiss, all right?
But no promises.

241
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,605
- All right.
- When are you coming home?

242
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,450
It's complicated.
There's a problem with the house.

243
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,785
They sold it.

244
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:21,328
Very funny. No. We can't see it
until late this afternoon.

245
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,497
I'm not up to fighting the traffic.
I'll come in tomorrow.

246
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,461
What about school?

247
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,048
She's only five.
What will she miss? Trigonometry?

248
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,886
Yeah, ok. I'll see you
when I get home from work.

249
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,130
Ok. See you tomorrow.

250
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,258
Ok, thanks. Have a good time.

251
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,520
Yeah?

252
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:52,192
What happened? I woke up.
You weren't here. I hate that.

253
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:02,198
- You didn't get my note?
- What note?

254
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,246
I left you a note right by your bed.

255
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:19,595
That's nice. I thought we were going
to spend the day together.

256
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,265
Look, I got so much work
to do today. I can't.

257
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,230
Why don't you come over?
I'll cook us lunch.

258
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,016
The poor dog
hasn't been out of the house.

259
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,734
I gotta take him out.

260
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:36,233
Bring the dog. I love animals.
I'm a great cook. Come on.

261
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,950
Listen, I'd love to, but I can't.

262
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:43,948
Do what you have to do, then come
over afterwards. We can eat late.

263
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:51,589
Or you can work here.
I won't disturb you, I promise.

264
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,378
I'll be a good girl.

265
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,591
You don't give up, do you?

266
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,898
Good boy.

267
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,151
Quincy, no!

268
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,205
I got it! I got it!

269
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:29,293
Quincy, cover me. Come on. He fires.

270
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,460
- Ok.
- She's got it. It's back.

271
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,299
Over the head. He's got it.

272
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,646
Dan, can you hear me?

273
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,268
My god!

274
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,031
- You bastard.
- Your face!

275
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,870
Your face!

276
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,537
- That was a shitty thing to do.
- Sorry. I was fooling around.

277
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,457
My father died of a heart attack.

278
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,504
I was seven. It happened
right in front of me.

279
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,970
Honey, I'm sorry.

280
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:26,763
I had no idea. If I had,
I never would have done that.

281
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,394
Wait, he didn't die? He's alive?

282
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,315
He's alive and well
and living in Phoenix.

283
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:45,160
I guess you certainly got me,
didn't you?

284
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,676
Let's hear it.

285
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:11,061
I hope you like spaghetti.
Specialty of the house.

286
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,267
It goes with the opera.

287
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,523
It smells so good.

288
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,162
- Anything else for me to do?
- Just make yourself at home.

289
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,081
- Change the tape if you want.
- No, this is great.

290
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,330
I love madame butterfly.

291
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:41,630
- Really? It's my favourite opera.
- Mine, too.

292
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,923
First opera I ever saw.

293
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:49,091
My father took me to the old met.
I was five years old.

294
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:52,641
- Did it make any sense?
- I got most of it.

295
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:58,234
There was this us sailor setting up
house with this Japanese lady.

296
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,894
That was all fine.

297
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:07,152
But in the final act,
after he left her,

298
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:11,656
my father told me,
"she's gonna kill herself."

299
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,369
And I was terrified.

300
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:17,620
I was...
I climbed right underneath the chair.

301
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,831
It's right here.

302
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,758
This is it.

303
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,396
It's funny.

304
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,226
- What?
- It's one of the only times

305
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:44,822
I remember my father being nice
to me when I was a kid.

306
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,532
Comforting me at madame butterfly.

307
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,021
What?

308
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,441
What are you thinking?

309
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:34,197
I was wondering why all
the interesting guys are married.

310
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:40,286
Maybe you find them interesting
because you can't have them.

311
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,338
How long have you been married?

312
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,046
Nine years.

313
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,139
- Do you have any kids?
- I got a six-year-old girl.

314
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,975
Sounds good.

315
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:04,564
- Yeah, I'm lucky.
- So what are you doing here?

316
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,196
Boy, you know how to ask them.

317
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,291
No, I really want to know.

318
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,625
I had a wonderful time last night.
I'd like to see you again.

319
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,794
Is that so terrible?

320
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,084
No.

321
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,928
I just don't think it's possible.

322
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:40,479
It's really strange.
I feel like I know you already.

323
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,690
I just wanna know where I stand.

324
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,191
I think you're terrific.

325
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,780
But I'm married.

326
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,494
What can I say?

327
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,875
Just my luck.

328
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,362
Shit!

329
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,445
- What are you doing?
- I gotta go.

330
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:41,665
I thought she wasn't coming back
till tomorrow.

331
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:46,127
She's not, but I got things to do.
I gotta go home.

332
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:52,505
- I don't think I like this.
- Like what?

333
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,596
The way you run away
after every time we make love.

334
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:01,055
What difference does it make
when I leave? I gotta go.

335
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,721
- You're not gonna leave now.
- Come on. Stop it.

336
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,516
Come on! Alex!

337
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,362
What's the problem?

338
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,484
I'm sorry.

339
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,864
Jesus Christ, let's be reasonable.

340
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,618
Be reasonable? What?

341
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,120
Goodbye.
Don't call me, I'll call you.

342
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:32,545
You knew about me.
I didn't hide anything.

343
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,588
- I thought it was understood.
- What?

344
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,508
The opportunity was there,
and we took it.

345
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:41,429
- We're adults, aren't we?
- What's that supposed to mean?

346
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,093
I thought we'd have a good time.

347
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,642
You thought you'd have a good time.

348
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,765
You didn't stop to think about me.

349
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,358
That's crazy. You knew the rules.

350
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:56,198
- What rules?
- Look, Alex. I like you.

351
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,659
If I wasn't with somebody else,
maybe I'd be with you. But I am.

352
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:04,072
Please don't justify yourself.
It's pathetic.

353
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,292
If you'd tell me to fuck off,
I'd have more respect for you.

354
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,959
All right then, fuck off.

355
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,043
And you, get out!

356
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,231
I'm going.

357
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:41,531
Why don't you come over here
and say goodbye nicely?

358
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,654
Let's be friends.

359
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,667
Baby, no.

360
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:02,305
It's ok.

361
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:06,848
- Sorry if I upset you.
- It's ok, really.

362
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,026
It's ok. All right. That's ok.

363
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,651
Your hands are all wet.

364
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,199
Jesus!

365
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:30,122
Jesus Christ! Come here,
come here, come here.

366
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,291
Hold on. Hold on.

367
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,635
Nice and tight.

368
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:59,214
Hi. Did you just call me?

369
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,459
I was in the shower.
I heard the phone.

370
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,587
I thought it was you.

371
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,302
How are you? Did you have a good day?

372
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,344
Yeah, yeah.

373
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:18,567
Really? That's terrific.
That's really terrific.

374
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,232
You sound excited.

375
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,239
Yeah.

376
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,697
No, I'm not against the idea.

377
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,823
Don't get me wrong.
It's just the money.

378
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,785
Yeah.

379
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,083
Yeah.

380
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,882
Ok, darling. I love you.

381
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,222
Bye.

382
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,504
How are you feeling?

383
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,300
Ok.

384
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,471
I gotta go.

385
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:35,142
Will you call me sometime?

386
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,136
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

387
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,639
No, I want to.

388
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:42,688
You promise me
you'll go see the doctor?

389
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,561
Ok.

390
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:57,407
Goodbye.

391
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:03,038
- You take care.
- You, too.

392
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,651
Shit.

393
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,575
Look what I got.
Look what I got for you here.

394
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,450
Spaghetti and meat sauce.

395
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,953
We'll make an Italian
out of you yet. Good boy.

396
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,338
Have a good one, yeah?

397
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,480
What are you doing here? It's 8 A.M.

398
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:10,105
I'm in the shitter. I'm due in court
by two and I'm behind.

399
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,655
Do me a favour, cancel everything.
Tell drimmer we're fine.

400
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,995
- I'll be there by two.
- At two? Ok.

401
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,369
Good morning, Martha.

402
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,587
- Daddy!
- Honey! I missed you.

403
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,381
We had a great time.
I went for a walk with grandpa.

404
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,799
We saw rabbits...

405
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,094
Slow down.
I can't understand a word.

406
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,929
- I want a rabbit.
- I know you do.

407
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:42,304
- Hi, darling. How are you?
- Good.

408
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,725
Good.

409
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,400
God, I missed you.

410
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,404
- Liar.
- I did.

411
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,996
I should go away more often.

412
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,633
- I did this one.
- You did?

413
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:16,004
- Yes. Pick another one.
- I thought it was this one.

414
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,099
- No. It was this one.
- You're in a lot of trouble.

415
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,309
Phooey on Dewey.

416
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,245
- Ok.
- Now, pick a card, dad.

417
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,990
Any card at all?

418
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,913
Yes? Where'd she learn this?

419
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,036
Grandpa showed me.

420
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,130
Surprise.

421
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,927
So how was it?

422
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,971
Come on, I'm a big boy.
I can take it.

423
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,268
It had a place for rabbits.

424
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,985
No! She said it.
She said the r-word. No!

425
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,734
Not rabbits? Rabbits?

426
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,153
Rabbits!

427
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:19,526
- Rabbits!
- Not rabbits?

428
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,072
Rabbits!

429
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,571
What can I tell you?
It's absolutely perfect.

430
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,075
- In this row?
- No.

431
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,329
So, when are you gonna come up
and take a look at it?

432
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,707
Just for the hell of it?

433
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,002
How about tomorrow morning?

434
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,592
- Daddy, which row?
- You mean it?

435
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,390
If you get me back to the office
by one, yeah.

436
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,722
Which row, dad?

437
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,604
It's in this row, sweetheart.

438
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,122
Dan?

439
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:18,919
Honey? Honey, come here.
I want you to see this.

440
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,183
Well?

441
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,725
It's... it's ok.

442
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,937
- It's fantastic!
- It's great.

443
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,688
Think of all the money we'll save
not living in New York.

444
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,732
The high school is excellent.
My own children went there.

445
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:44,031
- You see?
- It's a terrific area for kids.

446
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,994
I'm sure. Is it ok if I... 7?

447
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,905
Go ahead. I'll wait here.

448
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,873
Thank you.

449
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,291
We still got to decorate.

450
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,956
We can fix it up.
We can have painting parties.

451
00:43:57,093 --> 00:44:00,301
Painting parties?
You're making me very nervous.

452
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,973
Now, look at this.
This is fantastic.

453
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,807
This would make a terrific playroom.

454
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:17,856
What are you talking about, playroom?
This is my den!

455
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,526
I knew you were gonna like it.

456
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,991
I like it.

457
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,169
I'll be in court. How you doing?

458
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:44,046
- Eunice, is Martha back from lunch?
- She just returned.

459
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,554
Hi.

460
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,682
Hello.

461
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,855
This isn't a bad time, is it?
I was in the area.

462
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:03,197
No, no.
You want to come into my office?

463
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,410
This is his account?

464
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:20,415
Danny, will you be
in your office later?

465
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,338
- Have we met somewhere?
- I don't think so.

466
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,262
She looked at me first.

467
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,887
Sit down.

468
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,445
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

469
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,741
I was going to call you today.

470
00:45:54,835 --> 00:46:00,000
L...
This is terribly embarrassing.

471
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:04,717
I just wanted to say sorry
for what happened.

472
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,336
I had no right
to put you through all that.

473
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,304
Nothing happened, ok?

474
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,552
I was going through a bad time.

475
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:17,226
Everything was coming to a crisis.

476
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,188
But I'm fine. I'm really all right.
And thank you.

477
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,653
- You don't have to thank me.
- Yeah, I do.

478
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:28,195
A lot of guys
would have just run away.

479
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,486
I don't know what I would have done
if you hadn't been there.

480
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:38,452
Well, you look good.
As a matter of fact, you look great.

481
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,794
Thanks.

482
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,424
So that's past?

483
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,214
Yeah.

484
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:54,100
- May I ask you one more favour?
- What's that?

485
00:46:54,228 --> 00:47:00,724
I've got two tickets to madame
butterfly, two weeks from Thursday.

486
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,396
I'd love it if you'd come with me,

487
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,894
kind of as a peace offering.

488
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:12,661
Well, that's very nice of you.
But I don't think it's a good idea.

489
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,536
No strings attached.

490
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,742
You don't have to explain.
I just thought I'd ask.

491
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:23,792
So...

492
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:30,799
I'll see you around sometime.

493
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,427
Ok.

494
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,062
Come here.

495
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,870
- Take care.
- Yeah. Goodbye.

496
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,489
Goodbye.

497
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,978
All right. Come on, let's go, pal.

498
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,982
We're on a roll.

499
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,946
- Let's see that action.
- Down the middle.

500
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,374
I like it. Very nice.

501
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,020
That is no good. I'm depressed.

502
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:34,089
What about Rodgers
versus whatchamacallit?

503
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,552
- Winitsky.
- Right.

504
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,263
I got your memo. You're going
for summary judgement?

505
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:41,050
Why not?
The facts are not in dispute.

506
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:45,977
Rodgers admits reading winitsky's
article, but did he plagiarise it?

507
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:49,350
You can't copyright an idea,
only the expression.

508
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:53,112
Rodgers didn't use
any of the words in the book.

509
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,105
- Let me think about it.
- Ok.

510
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,733
You're about to become a suburbanite.

511
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,656
We're gonna take the plunge.

512
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,245
- Got a buyer for the apartment?
- No.

513
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,411
- Got cold sweats about your escrow?
- Yeah.

514
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,956
But not about
Rodgers versus winitsky?

515
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,295
- No, sir.
- Good.

516
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,424
He's still in a meeting.

517
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:18,342
Yes, I know. I did expect him
to be through by now.

518
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,225
Have lunch with me on Tuesday.

519
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,891
That'd be great. I'll check my diary.

520
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,231
You are on his list of calls.
It's Alex forrest.

521
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:32,814
Again? I thought you told her
I'd call her back.

522
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,983
- I did.
- Put her on hold.

523
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,855
Would you mind holding?

524
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,573
Tuesday would be great.

525
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,614
- I look forward to it.
- Thank you. I will, too.

526
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,498
Put her through.

527
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,624
Hello?

528
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:58,795
Look, Alex, I thought we agreed
this was not a good idea.

529
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,840
Why?

530
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,762
I thought you understood.

531
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,936
If I misled you in some way,
I apologise.

532
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,357
But it's not a good idea
if we talk to each other any more.

533
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,192
Ok?

534
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,028
Goodbye.

535
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:30,159
Yeah, if she calls again,
tell her I'm not here.

536
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,630
Wait, let me just...

537
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,837
Let me just look at you.

538
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,759
You're so beautiful.

539
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:27,178
Just so beautiful.

540
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:42,523
- Wouldn't you know?
- I know.

541
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:51,165
Go on, open it.

542
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,625
I wouldn't do it to my wife.

543
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:54,994
It's ok.

544
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,123
- Know how many injuries happen?
- Don't terrorise them!

545
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:03,761
I'm a lawyer, I'm insured.
It's excited.

546
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,754
Don't forget who gave you this.

547
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,678
My cold sores are almost gone.

548
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:11,052
Ladies first.
I use that term advisedly.

549
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,388
You're the best, sweetie.

550
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:19,019
That's my wife!
A little attention, please, ladies.

551
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:24,361
Gentlemen, my wife, ball and chain.

552
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,150
Mother of some of my children.

553
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,651
Don't be too confident.

554
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:33,166
Here is to Miller, Goodman,
hurst and Gallagher!

555
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,330
- And to mrs Gallagher.
- Give me a break.

556
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,249
He just asked me to lunch.

557
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,044
You're moving to your estate.
You'll forget us plebs.

558
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,918
Wait a minute.
I read a self-help book.

559
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:50,721
- Published by Robbins & hart.
- Of course. Samurai self-help.

560
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:57,724
In it, it tells you how deal with
the anxieties of your friends

561
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:02,315
as you move up the corporate ladder
and they stay put.

562
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:06,817
In this book, it says not to coddle
your friends' anxieties.

563
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,989
I'm not gonna make
any false reassurances.

564
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,997
I won't say you can go to the house
every weekend.

565
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:17,456
Things have changed.
This is not a classless society.

566
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,290
In fact, this is it. Goodbye.

567
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:22,540
- Goodbye.
- I knew he was gonna say that!

568
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:26,589
- He's running true to form.
- We gotta make a clean break.

569
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:30,882
- We gotta travel light.
- Thanks for the time you gave us.

570
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:42,109
Drink. I want you with a lampshade
on your head by ten.

571
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,274
Why should today be any different?

572
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:51,027
Hello? Hello?

573
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,700
Here's to you.

574
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,786
Cheers.

575
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,036
Hello?

576
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,752
Hello!

577
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,959
Yeah?

578
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:52,634
Yeah, Richards.
It's kinda late, isn't it?

579
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:59,599
If you won't take my calls
at the office, I have no choice.

580
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:04,521
It's two o'clock in the morning.
Can't this wait till tomorrow?

581
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,435
Is it awkward for you to talk?

582
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,860
You could say that.

583
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,525
I've got to see you.

584
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:18,490
I don't have the... documentation
to answer that question now.

585
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:20,328
But I'll call you from the office.

586
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:26,248
No. Meet me in front of the Robbins
& hart building tomorrow at six.

587
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:30,422
Don't disappoint me. Be there.

588
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,091
Ok.

589
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,721
This has got to stop.

590
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,810
You should have agreed to see me.

591
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,430
It's over.
There is nothing between us.

592
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:47,025
You've had your fun,
now you just want a quiet life?

593
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,527
Why are you doing this?
You need help.

594
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,864
- Don't tell me what I need.
- You need a shrink.

595
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,984
I'm not your enemy.

596
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:58,780
- Why are you trying to hurt me?
- I'm not. I love you.

597
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,749
- You what?
- I love you.

598
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,452
- You don't know me.
- How can you say that?

599
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,371
We spent a weekend together.

600
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,623
You spent a second night.
You must like me.

601
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,925
I was concerned about you.
You read too much into everything.

602
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,305
I have a whole relationship
with someone else.

603
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,892
- I am very happy.
- Whole means complete.

604
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,224
If your life's complete,
why were you with me?

605
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,684
You want to talk about
our imaginary affair?

606
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,353
I'm pregnant.

607
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,652
I saw my gynaecologist on Monday.

608
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,741
Here's his card. You can call him.

609
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:45,284
You don't...?

610
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:52,132
Use anything? No.
I had a bad miscarriage last year.

611
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,251
I didn't think I could get pregnant.

612
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:57,925
How do you know it's mine?

613
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:04,053
Because I don't sleep around.

614
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:17,066
I apologise.

615
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,077
I'm sorry.

616
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,822
Don't worry.
You won't have to handle this alone.

617
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,083
Handle what?

618
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,544
The abortion. I'll take care of it.
I'll pay for it.

619
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,589
What makes you think
I want an abortion?

620
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:41,181
- You're not gonna have the baby?
- Why not?

621
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,595
There are plenty of
one-parent families.

622
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:47,347
- They don't end in divorce.
- I don't have a say in this?

623
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:52,476
I want this child.
It has nothing to do with you.

624
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,318
I want it whether you're
part of it or not.

625
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:58,316
Then why are you telling me?
Why not just go ahead and do it?

626
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,953
I was hoping that you
would want to be part of it.

627
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:08,451
This... this is totally insane.

628
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:13,790
I'm 36. It may be
my last chance to have a child.

629
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:19,215
Just think what you're saying.

630
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,759
Just think about it.

631
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:26,431
We are gonna live with this
for the rest of our lives.

632
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:31,603
I know that. I've thought of that.
I know how you feel.

633
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:35,853
It's a big thing.
But it doesn't have to be a problem.

634
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,022
Really, it doesn't.

635
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,159
You play fair with me,
I'll play fair with you.

636
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,251
"He led Agnes and Nellie
into the closet."

637
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,621
"Agnes, Nellie and oink
giggled in the dark."

638
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,588
"Pearl listened outside the door.
'It works, ' cried Nellie."

639
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,090
"Of course, ' said oink. 'Look at
the flying dog!' Yelled Agnes."

640
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:07,559
"Pearl frowned. 'Who cares about
flying dogs?' She said."

641
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,515
"Nobody heard her."

642
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,684
"Look out for the worms!'
Squealed Agnes."

643
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:14,650
"Eek!" yelled Nellie and Agnes."

644
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:20,648
"Look at the monster cockroach!
Yelled oink. 'Help!™

645
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:05,445
You know what I did?
I called the doctor.

646
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,939
Know what he says? "Congratulations!"

647
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:11,159
I can't even imagine
what she told him.

648
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,867
Anyway, that's not the end of it.

649
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,662
So, after I talked to the doctor,

650
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,831
this morning,
I broke into her apartment.

651
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:24,127
I know. Me, a lawyer,
breaking and entering.

652
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:28,010
I wanted to get a handle
on what I'm dealing with.

653
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,255
I wanted to find out if she was
sleeping with somebody else.

654
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,928
I didn't find anything.

655
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:42,600
Anyway, I didn't find anything.

656
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:45,853
I don't know anything
about family law.

657
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:49,023
You've got to help me.
What case does she really have?

658
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:55,742
Well, it ain't good.

659
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:00,659
She keeps calling the apartment.

660
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:04,128
Every time Beth answers the phone,
she hangs up.

661
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:11,879
I'm scared, Jimmy. I...
I don't want to lose my family.

662
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:22,563
The facts as alleged are horrendous.

663
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:26,693
The instrument allegedly used
was an electronic-shock device...

664
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:51,635
- Operator, may I help you?
- I'm trying to get 555-8129-212.

665
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,841
The recording says it's disconnected.

666
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,464
Just a moment, please.

667
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,512
It's been changed to unlisted.

668
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:01,512
It's a real emergency.
I need that number.

669
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,684
We can't give out that information.

670
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:48,021
- I like it. I like it a lot.
- We've been very happy here.

671
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,231
I'd definitely like
to think about it if I could.

672
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,781
- It's very clean.
- Yes.

673
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:58,447
We have a cleaning lady who comes
in a few times a week.

674
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,822
- I can give you her name as well.
- I'd love that.

675
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,538
There's babysitters galore.
The whole works.

676
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:16,219
Hi, darling. This is Alex.
I've forgotten your last name.

677
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:20,340
- Alex forrest.
- This is my husband Dan.

678
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,226
Hi. Glad to meet you.

679
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,849
Nice to meet you.

680
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:32,857
- Haven't we met somewhere?
- I don't think so.

681
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:42,321
No, we have. Weren't you
at that party at the Japanese place?

682
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:44,823
Honey, the exercise book.

683
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,495
Yeah.

684
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:50,246
You're a lawyer.
And you work for the firm...

685
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:53,339
What's the name? Anyway...

686
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:55,834
We've definitely met.

687
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:59,929
- You have a good memory.
- I never forget a face.

688
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:04,263
- It's a small world.
- It certainly is.

689
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:09,848
I gather you're going to the country?

690
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:12,851
- Moving to the country?
- Yes.

691
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,314
Have you found a place?

692
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:17,029
We found a place in bedford.
Do you know it?

693
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,191
- It's beautiful.
- Yes.

694
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:21,989
You'll move of here
almost immediately?

695
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:25,496
Actually, we wanted to do
some remodelling first.

696
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,158
I guess looking for a place
right now?

697
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,410
Yeah. I'd like to settle in.

698
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,833
Alex is expecting a baby.

699
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:38,047
That's...

700
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:41,171
Will you excuse me?
I have some work to do.

701
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:44,974
I better run, too.

702
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:48,311
Thank you for the tea
and showing me the apartment.

703
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:52,227
- You're very welcome.
- I like it. I really like it.

704
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,978
- We've been happy here.
- I'd like to think about it.

705
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:58,856
I'll give you our number
so you can call us direct.

706
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,653
Thank you.

707
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,756
- I'll keep in touch.
- Great.

708
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,921
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

709
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:30,520
She seemed really interested.

710
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:35,517
She didn't mention a husband.
I get the feeling she's on her own.

711
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:39,362
- What is it? You seem down.
- No, no. I'm just tired.

712
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,587
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

713
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:02,969
Who?

714
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:06,760
You know damn well!
Come on, let me in. I want to talk.

715
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:09,721
So now you want to talk?

716
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,323
What can I get you?

717
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:31,114
I've got scotch, vodka,
a nice chablis...

718
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:35,118
Cut the shit, will you? Just cut it!

719
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:42,918
I don't know what you're up to,
but it's gonna stop right now.

720
01:09:43,054 --> 01:09:46,717
No. It's going to go on,
until you face your responsibilities.

721
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,555
What responsibilities?

722
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:51,142
I'm pregnant.
I'm gonna have our child.

723
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:55,263
That's your choice, honey.
It has nothing to do with me.

724
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,015
I want to be a part of your life.

725
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:59,733
So you do it by showing up
at my apartment?

726
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,400
You won't answer my calls.
You changed your number.

727
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:06,445
I'm not gonna be ignored.

728
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,905
You don't get it.
You just don't get it.

729
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:19,292
Don't you remember our weekend?
Wasn't that wonderful?

730
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:26,754
I know you feel it, too.
What are you so afraid of?

731
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,676
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

732
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:32,596
Hit me. If you can't fuck me,
why don't you hit me?

733
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:35,892
You're so sad. You know that?
Lonely and very sad.

734
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,681
Don't you ever pity me,
you smug bastard.

735
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:41,355
I'll pity you because you're sick.

736
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:44,854
Why? Because I won't allow you
to treat me like a slut

737
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:48,240
you can bang a few times
and throw in the garbage?

738
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,781
I'm gonna be the mother
of your child.

739
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,908
I want a little respect.

740
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:02,581
You want respect?

741
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,377
- Respect!
- What are you doing?

742
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:10,380
Please don't go.
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

743
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,931
I'll tell your wife.

744
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:18,263
You tell my wife, I'll kill you.

745
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,729
It only takes a phone call!

746
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:32,239
Hello? Hello?

747
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,453
Got it.

748
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:47,046
Guys, that's on the second door
to the left, over here.

749
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:49,214
You could've stayed
in the apartment.

750
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:54,512
Dan was in such a hurry to get out
of New York. Momma, that's you.

751
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,635
Lord, put it away.

752
01:11:56,771 --> 01:12:01,891
All right, easy on the door-frame.
Good. Nice. Just like that.

753
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,242
I got it. Sorry. I got it.

754
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:28,424
Hello?

755
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:30,880
Martha.

756
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:38,264
Martha. It's Martha.

757
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,448
Hello?

758
01:12:57,582 --> 01:13:00,289
Hi, honey. Did the plumber come yet?

759
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:04,118
Did he ever.

760
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,754
I don't really want to know about it.

761
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:09,215
Hey, guess what I'm looking at.

762
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:12,426
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it right here.

763
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,921
Or I should say, I got her.

764
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:16,923
What's she like?

765
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:19,888
She's cute. She looks like a rabbit.

766
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,683
She's white, she's got long ears,
little pink eyes.

767
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:26,228
- Soft.
- She sounds cute.

768
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,692
Ellen doesn't know about it?

769
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:32,234
No. She doesn't think
she's gonna get one.

770
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,482
See what happens
if you work here too long?

771
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,026
- Isn't it cute?
- Thank you.

772
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:40,071
I forgot. This arrived for you.

773
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:41,617
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

774
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:58,093
Hey, Joaquin!

775
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:48,582
Jesus fucking Christ!

776
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:52,499
Fucking bitch! Jesus Christ!

777
01:15:57,303 --> 01:16:00,386
No. I said it was
the electrical system.

778
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:03,551
The whole goddamn thing blew up.

779
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:06,175
All right, honey.
I'll see you in a little while.

780
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,153
Mr Gallagher?

781
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:29,119
- You forgot your contract.
- Thanks.

782
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:39,026
Hello, Dan. Are you surprised?

783
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:41,862
This is what you've reduced me to.

784
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:47,861
I guess you thought you'd get away
with it. Well, you can't.

785
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:52,991
Because part of you is growing
inside of me, and that's a fact.

786
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:56,711
You'd better start
learning how to deal with it.

787
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:03,843
Because, you know, I feel you.

788
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:06,508
I taste you.

789
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,551
I think you.

790
01:18:08,726 --> 01:18:10,557
I touch you.

791
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:23,688
I'm just asking you to acknowledge
your responsibilities.

792
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:27,191
I mean, is that so bad?

793
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:32,072
I don't think so.
I don't think it's unreasonable.

794
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,494
And you know, another thing is,

795
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:39,997
that you thought that you could
just walk into my life

796
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:45,593
and turn it upside down, without
a thought for anyone but yourself.

797
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:11,027
You know what you are?

798
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:14,155
You're a cock-sucking son of a bitch.

799
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:19,373
I hate you. I bet
you don't even like girls, do you?

800
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:22,167
You flaming fucking faggot!

801
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,551
Daddy! Thank you.

802
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:21,143
You're welcome, honey. You like her?

803
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:25,272
You like it?

804
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:25,252
You thought you could just walk
into my life and turn it upside down

805
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,623
without a thought
for anyone but yourself.

806
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:30,715
You know what you are?

807
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:36,009
You're a cock-sucking son of a bitch.

808
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:41,636
You are. I bet
you don't even like girls, do you?

809
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:47,108
They probably scare you.
I know I do.

810
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:49,568
You're scared of me, aren't you?

811
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:54,030
You're fucking frightened of me.
You're afraid.

812
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:57,489
You gutless, heartless, spineless
fucking son of a bitch.

813
01:21:57,663 --> 01:22:00,996
I hate you.
You deserve everything you get.

814
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,621
- Jesus Christ!
- Sorry.

815
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:09,414
I was wondering why you were
up so late. I'm sorry.

816
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,758
It's ok. I was listening
to a deposition.

817
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:14,342
I couldn't sleep.

818
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:17,133
Come on.
I'm gonna give you a back rub.

819
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,383
- Back rub?
- Brandy, a back rub.

820
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:24,804
- You won't know what hit you.
- Sounds good.

821
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:32,733
My client wants it stopped.

822
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:35,026
He wants an end to the harassment.

823
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:37,992
He's positive it was this woman
who trashed the car?

824
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,906
Yes, of course.

825
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,280
- Any witnesses?
- No.

826
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,417
He can file a complaint
if it'd make him feel better.

827
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:50,413
There's not a lot we can do
without proof.

828
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:55,339
This woman is completely irrational.
There's no telling what she could do.

829
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:58,178
We can't arrest people
for what they might do.

830
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:03,051
I'm not asking you to arrest her.
I... he simply...

831
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:09,644
He wants her warned.

832
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:15,063
We could talk to her.
It may make things public.

833
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,484
He's not gonna like that.

834
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:19,149
It may even aggravate the situation.

835
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:21,026
How's that?

836
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:23,154
Whatever resentment she's feeling,

837
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,448
she's probably got it
out of her system.

838
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:28,538
Any action we take could provoke her.

839
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:34,081
What if she
didn't get it out of her system?

840
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:37,710
Catch her in the act.
Then we can bring charges.

841
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,337
He just has to sit there and take it?

842
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:44,137
It's his bed. I'm afraid
he's gonna have to lie in it.

843
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:04,578
Come on, come on.

844
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,787
Come on, Ellen,
we're going to grandma's.

845
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:20,715
Come on, Quincy. Come on, hurry up.

846
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:23,259
Come on, get on in. Hurry up.

847
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:26,429
Watch his tail, sweetie.
Make him sit down.

848
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:44,651
- You didn't get your car back?
- No, it's a write-off.

849
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:49,324
- The electrical system's shot.
- Extraordinary, those foreign cars.

850
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:51,450
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

851
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:54,620
- Want to try again, sweetie?
- Ok.

852
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:56,371
Ok.

853
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,123
So?

854
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:04,176
Dear Priscilla, miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

855
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:05,798
Very good.

856
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:09,768
Do it one more time.
Do it with your hat and do the bow,

857
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:12,603
so that when you do it,
you know what you're doing.

858
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:14,940
Let me see your bow.

859
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:19,360
And what do you say?

860
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:24,275
Dear Priscilla, miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

861
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:27,323
- Very good. You got that.
- Ellen.

862
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:28,987
Come here.

863
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:34,292
- That was good.
- Thank you.

864
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:39,378
That was really good.
That was so good.

865
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:44,253
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

866
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,425
Thank you, darling.

867
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:12,330
Come on, Quincy.

868
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:37,449
- Daday!
- What?

869
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:46,587
Whitey's gone!

870
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:11,283
It's all right, darling.
It's going to be ok, sweetie.

871
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:14,744
You should try and get some sleep.

872
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,972
- Is she ok?
- She's asleep.

873
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:46,359
Did you call the police?

874
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:49,195
- Not yet, no.
- Why not?

875
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:54,693
Honey, we gotta talk.

876
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:05,082
What is it?

877
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,423
I know who did this.

878
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:13,716
You do? Who?

879
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:18,559
Remember the girl
who came to the apartment?

880
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:21,595
The one I met
in the Japanese restaurant?

881
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:26,224
The one with the blonde hair.

882
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:35,358
You're scaring me.

883
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:43,743
What is it?

884
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:46,120
Did you have an affair with her?

885
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:47,871
Yes.

886
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,678
Beth?

887
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:12,737
Beth, I am so sorry.

888
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:18,281
The last thing I ever wanted to do
was to hurt you.

889
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:28,787
Are you in love with her?

890
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:33,088
No. It was one night.
It didn't mean anything.

891
01:30:44,314 --> 01:30:49,104
What has it got to do
with what's happened?

892
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:54,730
She's pregnant.

893
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:59,405
She's...

894
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:00,993
It's yours?

895
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:05,115
I don't know. That's what she says.
Listen, Beth, please.

896
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:10,378
Get off!
I want you out of this house!

897
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,168
How could you do that? I hate you!

898
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:17,090
- Understand what I'm saying...
- I don't want to hear it!

899
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:20,339
Please, just listen to me, will you?

900
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,057
What is the matter with you?

901
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:35,747
Dan, what a pleasant surprise.

902
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:41,174
It's over. It's finished.
I told Beth. She knows all about it.

903
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:46,599
Sure. You haven't got the balls.

904
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:49,845
Why don't you speak to her?

905
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:53,227
Why would I want to talk to her?

906
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:07,446
This is Beth Gallagher.

907
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:12,121
If you come near my family again,
I'll kill you, you understand?

908
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:42,026
That's the last one, Ellen.
I mean it.

909
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:02,300
Hello? Hi, daddy.

910
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,547
When are you coming home?

911
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:14,847
Honey, I don't know.
How are you doing?

912
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:17,974
Good.

913
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:27,567
Grandpa taught me a new card trick.

914
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:30,491
Did he? The one with the Jacks.

915
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:33,247
No, the one with the kings.

916
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:36,793
Good.

917
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:41,627
I won't.

918
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:46,002
Good.

919
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:51,966
How's mommy?

920
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:53,968
Send her my love.

921
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:56,938
Ok. Goodbye.

922
01:34:57,066 --> 01:34:59,853
Daddy?

923
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:01,939
Call me tomorrow.

924
01:35:02,071 --> 01:35:06,781
I will. I promise.
You be sure you tell mommy I called.

925
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,321
I will.

926
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:12,783
Love you a lot, too. Bye-bye.

927
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:18,743
Bye-bye.

928
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:03,455
Mrs Gallagher,
did you forget something?

929
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:09,052
- I came to get Ellen.
- I thought you'd picked her up.

930
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,761
I'm sure she's left already.

931
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:14,181
Betty? Is Ellen in here with you?

932
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,141
- She's gone home.
- Sure?

933
01:36:16,271 --> 01:36:19,013
Positive. She's not inside
or in the playground.

934
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:22,481
- I thought you picked her up.
- Who did pick her up?

935
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:24,475
She can't have gone far.

936
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:27,820
- You don't understand.
- I'll check her locker.

937
01:36:33,246 --> 01:36:36,534
- Alicia, where's Ellen?
- She's gone.

938
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:40,708
Call the police.

939
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,749
Ellen.

940
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:51,295
Please let her be all right!

941
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:56,883
Christ.

942
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:00,557
Where are you?

943
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:05,952
Look out!

944
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:26,180
Where are you?

945
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,501
- Bye-bye, Ellen.
- Bye.

946
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:58,805
Ellen, can I have a kiss?

947
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:04,056
Bye.

948
01:39:14,115 --> 01:39:17,983
I'm looking for a patient
named Gallagher. I'm her husband.

949
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:20,610
Room 22 at the end of the corridor.

950
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:23,579
- Is she gonna be ok?
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

951
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:27,041
She was very lucky.
It might have been a lot worse.

952
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:30,537
- Daddy!
- Hi, babes. God, I missed you.

953
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:32,459
I missed you, honey.

954
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:35,459
Are you ok?
Have you seen mommy yet?

955
01:39:35,595 --> 01:39:37,631
Yeah.

956
01:39:37,763 --> 01:39:41,347
Now, you stay here with granny.
I'll go and see mommy.

957
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:54,060
Howard.

958
01:40:09,128 --> 01:40:11,335
You're gonna be ok.

959
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:11,600
- Want to go to Ziggy's first?
- Hot places.

960
01:45:05,174 --> 01:45:08,837
I tried to explain the situation,
but you wouldn't listen.

961
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:13,087
The woman took my kid.
That's kidnapping. Am I right?

962
01:45:13,224 --> 01:45:16,387
My wife could've been killed.
If you won't do anything...

963
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,518
Take it easy.
You don't have to shout.

964
01:45:20,689 --> 01:45:23,351
Ok.

965
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:24,982
What are you gonna do?

966
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:30,024
We'll tell New York to pick her up
and bring her in for questioning.

967
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:34,408
Ok.

968
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:40,282
Ok. I'm gonna go
to the hospital tomorrow

969
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:43,284
to pick my wife up.

970
01:45:43,462 --> 01:45:47,751
Hopefully, I'll be home
for the weekend

971
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:49,748
if you need to talk to me.

972
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:59,053
Thank you, lieutenant.

973
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:03,391
You're welcome.

974
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:27,041
How's that feel? You warm? Good.

975
01:46:28,757 --> 01:46:30,463
Are you all cosy?

976
01:46:30,593 --> 01:46:32,629
Is mommy gonna be all right?

977
01:46:33,512 --> 01:46:38,131
Mommy's gonna be fine, honey.
She's gonna be fine.

978
01:46:38,267 --> 01:46:40,883
Are you going to stay with us?

979
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:46,139
I'm gonna stay with you.

980
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:51,606
Now, go to sleep, ok?

981
01:46:54,992 --> 01:46:56,857
Goodnight, doll.

982
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:00,615
Forever?

983
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:04,452
I promise, honey.

984
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:29,474
You mean the detectives in Manhattan
have no idea where she's gone?

985
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:32,352
They don't know where she is?

986
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:37,822
Yeah.

987
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:46,999
No, I see.

988
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:49,869
If you get any more information,
you'll let me know, lieutenant?

989
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:52,337
Thank you very much.

990
01:48:09,066 --> 01:48:11,523
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

991
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:14,192
How does the arm feel?

992
01:48:14,363 --> 01:48:16,604
It hurts.

993
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:18,856
Can I get you some more painkillers?

994
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:22,947
Ok.

995
01:48:25,874 --> 01:48:29,162
Welcome back.
Our contestants have to decide...

996
01:48:43,726 --> 01:48:45,057
Thank you.

997
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:47,221
Holler if you need anything else.

998
01:48:47,396 --> 01:48:49,728
I'd love a cup of tea.

999
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:52,431
You got it.

1000
01:50:32,584 --> 01:50:34,950
What are you doing here?

1001
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:42,462
Why are you here?

1002
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:52,602
He tried... to say goodbye to me
last night.

1003
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:54,936
But he couldn't,

1004
01:50:55,065 --> 01:51:00,981
because he and I feel the same way
about each other.

1005
01:51:01,864 --> 01:51:06,403
Do you know how it is when you meet
somebody for the first time...

1006
01:51:08,912 --> 01:51:11,870
And you get
this instant attraction?

1007
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:23,249
I understand what you're doing.

1008
01:51:23,385 --> 01:51:26,468
You're trying to move him
into the country.

1009
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:29,555
And you're keeping him away from me.

1010
01:51:30,767 --> 01:51:34,225
And you're playing happy family.

1011
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:41,977
But you... wouldn't understand that,
because you're so selfish.

1012
01:51:44,364 --> 01:51:47,982
He told me about you.
He told me about you.

1013
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:50,321
He was very honest.

1014
01:52:03,217 --> 01:52:05,082
If you weren't so stupid,
you'd know that.

1015
01:52:05,219 --> 01:52:11,135
But you're a stupid, selfish bitch!
You're a stupid, selfish bitch!

1016
01:52:28,283 --> 01:52:30,148
Dan!

1017
01:52:34,498 --> 01:52:36,580
Dan!
