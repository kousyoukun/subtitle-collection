1
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,287
Mom, there is one thing
I'd like to ask you.

2
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,540
-Sure.
-How do they make that slime

3
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,834
-they're always dumping on you?
-Oh, well.

4
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,712
First they take some water.
Some liquid.

5
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,632
And then they add some
JELL-O powder and some flour.

6
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,758
Sometimes some soap.

7
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,510
Then they dump it all over me.

8
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,969
You gotta get going, kiddo.
We're going to be late.

9
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,513
Where do they dump it from?

10
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:22,016
Actually, Vanessa, I've always
wondered that, too. I just don't know.

11
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,106
Very interesting. Is it always green?

12
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,443
Well, yeah, it usually is,
but I guess it could be red.

13
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,450
Or it could be blue.

14
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,420
Or yellow.

15
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,342
-Daddy, telephone.
-Thanks, darling.

16
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,689
Hello?

17
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,192
Hi. No, I'm fine. I just stubbed my toe.

18
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,113
Hang on one second, will you?
Honey, it's Hildy.

19
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,031
I'll call her back.

20
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,200
She's in the bathroom.

21
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,036
She wants to know what you're wearing.

22
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,705
My black suit.

23
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,624
She's gonna wear her black dress.

24
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,670
Well, it's gonna be business.
You know how those things are.

25
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,716
Ellen, I don't want you messing with
my make-up now, honey, okay? I'm late.

26
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,802
-Is her red dress okay?
-It's perfect.

27
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:44,056
Did you hear that? You got it.
Okay, darling, see you later. Bye.

28
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,725
Oh, man.

29
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,479
I told you a million times
not to play with my lipstick, right?

30
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,734
So when are you gonna
listen to me, huh? Silly girl.

31
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,406
Honey, where's my blue suit?

32
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,241
It's on the back of the door.

33
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,914
Oh, shit!

34
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,208
Shit, shit, shit!

35
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,586
Shit, shit, shit.

36
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,255
Shit, shit, shit.

37
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,430
-Hi, Ellen.
-Hi, Christine.

38
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,932
-How are you doing?
-Good.

39
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,518
-Where's Mommy?
-Mom? She's in the bathroom.

40
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,270
Ellen, I got you a present.

41
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:34,273
-You want to see what it is?
-Yeah, yeah.

42
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,525
Do you like it?

43
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,236
Okay. Come on, let's go find Mommy.

44
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,949
So then she's taking me to have...

45
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,284
She's pregnant,
she's going to give birth.

46
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,172
Hiya, Chuck. How are you? Good to
see you. You gonna make it Friday?

47
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,257
-Friday, I'm there.
-We need you, pal. We're in the cellar.

48
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,676
-You know that. Okay.
-Okay.

49
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,969
Dan, is my hair okay?

50
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,179
-You look great.
-I'm serious.

51
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,515
You're the prettiest woman
in the room, sweetheart.

52
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,724
You liar.

53
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,851
Dan! Danny!

54
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,483
-Hiya, Bob. How are you?
-Glad you could make it, Dan.

55
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,985
Listen, I'm sorry
about the meeting tomorrow.

56
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,487
I know it's a Saturday,
but we've got a real crisis here.

57
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,447
Oh, no, I understand.
You know my wife Beth? Bob Drimmer.

58
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,324
-Pleased to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

59
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,077
-I hope you like sushi.
-Thank you. I love it, Bob. Love it.

60
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,871
-What did he do to his neck?
-He was screwing his wife.

61
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,373
-Are you serious?
-Am I serious?

62
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,418
Absolutely, you should see his wife.
They had to take her out on a stretcher.

63
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,962
-Hi, darling.
-You guys are bad.

64
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,297
Who wants champagne? Champagne?
Let's go.

65
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,299
-Champagne for everyone.
-Hemlock! With a twist.

66
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,428
Four champagnes over here.
Excuse me. Hi.

67
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,266
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

68
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,810
-Thank you very much.
-Excuse me.

69
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,856
Jesus! Thank you. Fuck.

70
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,151
-Thank you.
-No, thank you.

71
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,737
So, what great cultural event
are we here to celebrate tonight?

72
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,823
-Some exercise manual.
-Not another one?

73
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,867
This one's different.

74
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,578
Based on ancient samurai discipline.

75
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:17,334
Danny, look at this guy nod.
What is that, part of the ritual?

76
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,586
Hey...

77
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,048
Hi, there.

78
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,597
-Jesus, if looks could kill...
-Glad to see you haven't lost your touch.

79
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,098
-I think she likes me.
-You do, huh?

80
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,100
-I think she wants me.
-I think you're batting zero for two,

81
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,268
and I don't want to know you.

82
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,771
-She was undressing me with her eyes.
-You think so? Good luck, pal.

83
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,939
She had trouble with the buttons.

84
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,610
A signed copy.

85
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,748
-Here you are, ma'am.
-Oh, thank you, dear.

86
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,420
-Can I get a champagne, please?
-You got it.

87
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,387
I'm not saying anything.
I'm not even gonna look.

88
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,889
Was it that bad?

89
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,558
Let's just say I was glad I wasn't
on the receiving end of that one.

90
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:15,935
Cheers.

91
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,813
Just gotta hate it when guys think
they can come on like that.

92
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,025
Jimmy's okay. He's just a little
insecure, like the rest of us.

93
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,323
-My name is Dan Gallagher.
-Alex Forrest.

94
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,742
Nice to meet you.
What is your connection here?

95
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,620
I'm an editor at Robbins & Hart.
And you?

96
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,165
I'm with Miller, Goodman and Hurst.
I do all your legal work.

97
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,376
I haven't seen you
around their office, though.

98
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,462
I've just been with them
a couple of weeks.

99
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,805
I have to go.

100
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,015
-Is that your wife?
-Yeah.

101
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,268
Better run along.

102
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,645
It was very nice to meet you.

103
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,111
"Make concessions with your body."

104
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,280
What does this mean,
"make concessions"?

105
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,990
-Oh, give me a break.
-Give you a break?

106
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,908
What does this mean?

107
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,411
How many did you buy?

108
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,006
-Well, thanks again, Christine.
-Any time, Mrs. Gallagher.

109
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,507
Good night.

110
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,768
Aren't you forgetting something?

111
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,032
Quincy, let's hit it, pal.

112
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,375
You're such a good boy, yes.

113
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,840
You did such good business.
You did good business.

114
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,800
You're the best boy.

115
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,344
Good night.

116
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,896
It's just for tonight, honey.

117
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,360
When you first see the house,
don't show any interest at all,

118
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,613
-otherwise we can't negotiate.
-Will you stop worrying about it?

119
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,573
-Ellen, are you chewing gum again?
-What's to worry, though?

120
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,993
-We can't afford it anymore.
-Daddy, is Granny going to be there?

121
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,620
-Just up the road from Mom and Dad.
-Yes.

122
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,790
-Which is another reason not to buy it.
-I didn't hear that.

123
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,959
What's to worry about?
Can't afford the goddamn thing, anyway.

124
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,795
Oh, come on. Hold on to him, honey.

125
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,801
Let's just not worry about it, okay?
I haven't even seen the damn place yet.

126
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,886
I may not even like it.

127
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,431
Ellen? The gum? Thank you.

128
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,019
Come on, Quincy. Come on, boy.

129
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,856
No, honey. Quincy's got to stay here
with Daddy. Daddy's gonna be all alone.

130
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,442
Sorry, Quincy. Now, you're not gonna
forget to walk him, are you?

131
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,986
-I promise.
-You promise.

132
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,280
Okay. You have a good meeting.

133
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,074
-Okay. See you tomorrow night.
-Love you.

134
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:42,599
Two times down, third time up,
he looked like a jellyfish.

135
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,313
-Hi, Bob.
-Hi, Dan. Sorry to ruin your weekend.

136
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,106
Please, give my apologies
to your lovely wife.

137
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,358
-David, hi.
-Help yourself.

138
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,820
-So, how are you feeling?
-Don't ask.

139
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,324
Henry's out of town, so I asked
Alex Forrest to stand in for him.

140
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,535
-Anybody know where she is?
-She's on her way.

141
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,370
Well, since we've got a little time,

142
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,499
maybe you can tell us exactly
what happened to your neck, Bob.

143
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,961
That's cute. Very cute.

144
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,172
Sorry I'm late. I was getting the file.

145
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,507
Dan, this is Alex Forrest,
our new associate editor.

146
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,426
-We've met before. Hi.
-Yeah, hello.

147
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,347
-Okay. Can we get started, Dan?
-Okay, here's the story.

148
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,975
You want to publish a novel
in which one of the characters

149
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,312
is a senator from New Jersey
who's fooling around.

150
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,189
Now, there's a certain congressman
from Ohio

151
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,940
who claims
the character's based upon him,

152
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,401
and he's filed an injunction
against the publication.

153
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,196
Look, the congressman's bald.
This guy has hair.

154
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,073
They're from different states,
for Christ's sake.

155
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,699
Look, if we don't sell those books,
we're screwed.

156
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,993
Well, that's all fine, but if I'm
gonna go to court to prove

157
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,787
the senator's not based upon
this congressman,

158
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,331
then I have to know the truth.

159
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:52,044
Now... Well, strictly between
these walls, all right?

160
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,048
Did the author have an affair
with Mr. Ohio or not?

161
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,013
Yeah, she did.

162
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,975
But she also had a lot of affairs
with other politicians.

163
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,478
Any one of them could
make the same claim.

164
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,565
She swears this character's fictitious.
I just got off the phone with her.

165
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,150
And you believe her?

166
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,404
Yeah, I believe her.

167
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,323
Okay, now that we've got that
on the table,

168
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,158
what can we do to lift that injunction?

169
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,412
If we believe the girl, is there some way
we can get to the congressman?

170
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,247
They take campaign contributions.

171
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,499
Can we buy him off?
Can we frighten him off?

172
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,252
Is there something in his past
that we can find out about?

173
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,754
I mean, we need to use some leverage.
I got 25...

174
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,271
Give me a break, will you?

175
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,733
Come on.

176
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,530
Come on!

177
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,615
Come on.

178
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,378
-Was it made in Taiwan?
-Yeah. These are tough to find.

179
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,797
Wait, wait. Here. We got one.

180
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,426
Come on!

181
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,222
What do you say, you want to
go get a drink till it stops?

182
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,475
-Yeah, I'd love it.
-Okay.

183
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,059
Come on.

184
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,484
The strangest case I ever handled?

185
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,404
Well, the truth was,
I never actually handled a case.

186
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,907
The strangest case I ever came near to

187
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,326
was when my parents got divorced.

188
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,078
And my mother asked me
to represent her.

189
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,748
-You're kidding?
-That's what I said.

190
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,584
"What do you mean?" she told me.
"You know what an asshole the guy is."

191
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,420
"You've been a witness to this marriage
for the past 29 years."

192
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,005
Can you believe this?
This is coming from my mother.

193
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,466
No. How did you get out of it?

194
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,344
Well, you can't exactly
turn your mother down.

195
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,680
So, I escaped on a technicality.

196
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,975
-Which was what?
-I didn't practice family law.

197
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,188
And it was true, you know.
And she bought it.

198
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:20,108
-You're making this up.
-Could I make something up like that?

199
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,111
Waiter?

200
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,450
I've got a lot of pull here, you know.
My favorite restaurant.

201
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:32,037
-Yeah, I noticed.
-They know me well. Miss?

202
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,956
-You want coffee?
-I'd love one.

203
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,458
Can we have two coffees, please?

204
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,462
Well, I tell you, it's a...

205
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,006
-Do you want one?
-No, thank you.

206
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,302
It's funny being a lawyer, you know.
It's like being a doctor.

207
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,471
Everybody's telling you
their innermost secrets.

208
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,889
Oh, God.

209
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,726
-You must have to be discreet.
-Oh, God, yeah.

210
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,853
Are you?

211
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,483
Am I what?

212
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,069
Discreet.

213
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,328
Yes, I'm discreet.

214
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,164
Me, too.

215
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,424
-Can I ask you something?
-What?

216
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,510
Why don't you have a date tonight?
It's Saturday night.

217
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,178
I did have a date.

218
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,432
I stood him up.
That was the phone call I made.

219
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,562
Does that make you feel good?

220
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,940
It doesn't make me feel bad.

221
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,902
So, where's your wife?

222
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,447
Where's my wife?

223
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,454
My wife is in the country with her
parents, visiting them for the weekend.

224
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,708
And you're here with a strange girl,
being a naughty boy.

225
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,253
I don't think having dinner
with anybody is a crime.

226
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,755
Not yet.

227
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,969
-Will it be?
-I don't know. What do you think?

228
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,264
I definitely think
it's going to be up to you.

229
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,104
I can't say yet.
I haven't made up my mind.

230
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,986
At least you're very honest.

231
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:34,493
We were attracted to each other
at the party. That was obvious.

232
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,581
You're on your own for the night.
That's also obvious.

233
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,921
We're two adults.

234
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,055
Let's get the check.

235
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:44,998
-Oh, that was great.
-Oh, thank God. Thank God.

236
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,298
Are you feeling energetic?

237
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,677
What do you have in mind?

238
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,814
-How you getting home?
-I don't know, I live upstairs.

239
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,692
-This is the building?
-Yeah.

240
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,492
Well, where do I get a cab, you know?

241
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,171
Have you ever done it in an elevator?

242
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,008
-Not recently, no.
-I bet you haven't.

243
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,165
Oh, I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

244
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,876
How are you?

245
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,221
Hi. What happened to you?

246
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,349
I tried you earlier. I'm gonna go...
I guess you're not back yet.

247
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:35,687
Well, I'm gonna go to bed now,
so call me in the morning. Bye-bye.

248
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,917
Hello? Oh, Dan, darling,
we were expecting you.

249
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,462
-I'm sorry. I had work to do.
-That's a pity.

250
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,589
We really wanted you to see that house.

251
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,466
-Well, I'll see it next time.
-Yes, of course.

252
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,633
You want to speak to Beth?

253
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,303
-Yes, please.
-Yes, all right.

254
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,309
The phone, it's Dan. Here you are.

255
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,147
Well, hello. What happened to you?

256
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,691
Hi...

257
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,778
Nothing. I just went out
and had dinner with Bill last night.

258
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,237
How is he?

259
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:32,077
He's... Bill's, you know...
Bill's Bill, the same as usual.

260
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,661
Is he still with that girl?

261
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,956
Well, he wasn't last night.
I think it's over.

262
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,918
He really didn't seem like
he wanted to talk about it.

263
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,546
-So, are you getting any work done?
-Yeah, I'm working.

264
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,091
Oh, listen, there's some of the spaghetti
sauce in the refrigerator,

265
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,592
if you get hungry.

266
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,095
Great. Okay. How's Ellen doing?

267
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:54,349
She is having the best time.
I just hope that Dad survives it.

268
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,060
Honey, I don't know how to tell you this.

269
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,939
But... She wants a rabbit.

270
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,982
Beth, no rabbits.

271
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,236
Jesus Christ! This goddamn family's
turning into Noah's Ark.

272
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,989
I mean, please! Give her a kiss,
all right? But no promises.

273
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,367
-All right.
-When are you coming home?

274
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,327
-Well, it's getting complicated.
-Why's that?

275
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,496
There's a problem with the house.

276
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,123
They sold it.

277
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:23,086
Very funny. No. We can't get in to see it
until late this afternoon.

278
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,756
I'm not up to fighting the traffic.
I thought I would come in tomorrow.

279
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,216
What about school?

280
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,970
She's only 5 years old.
What's she gonna miss? Trigonometry?

281
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,388
Yeah, okay. All right.

282
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,640
Well, then I'll see you
when I get home from work.

283
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,934
Okay. See you tomorrow.

284
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,562
Okay, thanks. Have a good time.

285
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,696
Yeah?

286
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:53,491
What happened? I woke up.
You weren't here. I hate that.

287
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,001
-You didn't get my note?
-What note?

288
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,671
I left you a note right by your bed.

289
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,426
Oh.

290
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:21,227
That's nice. I thought we were going
to spend the day together.

291
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,939
Alex, look, I've got so much work
to do today. I can't.

292
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,984
Why don't you just come over?
I'll cook us lunch.

293
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,194
I got to take the dog for a walk.

294
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,112
The poor dog has not
been out of this house all day.

295
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,405
I got to take him out.

296
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:36,576
Well, bring the dog. I love animals.
I'm a great cook. Come on.

297
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,580
Listen, I'd love to, but I can't.
All right? I really can't.

298
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,249
Do what you have to do,
then come over afterwards.

299
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,376
We can always eat late.

300
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:52,425
Or you can work here.
I won't disturb you, I promise.

301
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,886
I'll be a good girl.

302
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,267
Yeah, you don't give up, do you?
You just don't give up.

303
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,442
Come on!

304
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,076
Come on!

305
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,997
Quincy, no! Quincy!

306
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,918
I got it! I got it! He's free!

307
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:31,756
Quincy, cover me. I'm on it.
Go deep. He fires. Throws...

308
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:35,176
-Okay.
-She's got it. Yes. It's back.

309
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,845
Over the head. He's got it.

310
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,855
Dan? Dan!

311
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,778
Dan? Dan, can you hear me?

312
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,114
Oh, my God!

313
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,873
-You bastard.
-Your face!

314
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,458
Your face!

315
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:11,337
-That was a shitty thing to do.
-I'm sorry. I was just fooling around.

316
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,965
My father died of a heart attack.

317
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:19,470
I was 7 years old.
It happened right in front of me.

318
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,641
Honey, I'm sorry.

319
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:28,563
Really, I had no idea. If I did, I never
would have done anything like that.

320
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,236
Wait, he didn't die? He's alive?

321
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,240
Yeah, he's alive and well
and living in Phoenix.

322
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:45,496
I guess you certainly got me, didn't you?

323
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,225
Let's hear it.

324
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,398
I hope you like spaghetti.
Specialty of the house.

325
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,859
It goes with the opera.

326
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,951
It smells so good.

327
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,543
-Anything else for me to do?
-No, nothing.

328
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,795
Just make yourself at home.

329
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,714
-You can change the tape if you want to.
-No, this is great.

330
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,133
I love Madame Butterfly.

331
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,887
-Really? It's my favorite opera.
-Mine, too.

332
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,807
It's the first opera I ever saw.

333
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,603
My father, he took me to the old Met.
I was 5 years old.

334
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,231
-Did it make any sense?
-I got most of it.

335
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:58,319
There was this US sailor setting up
house with this Japanese lady.

336
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,615
That was all fine.

337
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,077
But in the final act, after he left her,

338
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,166
my father told me,
"She's gonna kill herself."

339
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,044
And I was terrified.

340
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:18,297
I was...
I climbed right underneath the chair.

341
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,427
It's right here.

342
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,763
This is it. It's right...

343
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,984
It's funny.

344
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,988
-What?
-It's one of the only times

345
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,783
I remember my father being nice
to me when I was a kid.

346
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,120
Comforting me at Madame Butterfly.

347
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,990
What?

348
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,328
What are you thinking?

349
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:37,084
I was wondering why is it that all
the interesting guys are always married.

350
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,086
Well, maybe that's why
you find them interesting,

351
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,506
the fact you can't have them.

352
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,051
How long have you been married?

353
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,429
Nine years.

354
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:53,017
-Do you have any kids?
-I got a 6-year-old girl.

355
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,355
Sounds good.

356
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,902
Yeah, I'm lucky.

357
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,281
So what are you doing here?

358
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,960
Boy, you know how to
ask the wrong thing.

359
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,046
No, I really want to know.

360
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,883
I had a wonderful time last night.
I'd like to see you again.

361
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,802
Is that so terrible?

362
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:29,720
No.

363
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,766
I just don't think it's possible, now.

364
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,982
It's really strange.
I feel like I know you already.

365
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,902
I just want to know where I stand.

366
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,783
I think you're terrific.

367
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,163
But I'm married.

368
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,751
What can I say? I...

369
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,091
Just my luck.

370
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,620
Shit!

371
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,499
-What are you doing?
-I gotta go.

372
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,419
I thought you said she wasn't
coming back till tomorrow.

373
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:47,590
She's not, but I got things to do, honey.
I got to go home.

374
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,971
-You know, I don't think I like this.
-Like what?

375
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:58,309
The way you run away
after every time we make love.

376
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,854
Well, Alex, what difference does it make
whether I leave now or in the morning?

377
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,022
The fact is, I gotta go.

378
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,359
-Well, you're not gonna leave now.
-Oh, come on. Will you stop it?

379
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,320
-I mean it.
-Come on! Hey, Alex! Come on!

380
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,117
What's the problem?

381
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,162
I'm sorry.

382
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,709
Jesus Christ, I mean,
let's be reasonable.

383
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:26,462
Be reasonable? What?

384
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,882
"Thank you, goodbye.
Don't call me, I'll call you."

385
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,803
Look, you knew about me, all right?
I didn't hide anything.

386
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,389
-I thought it was understood.
-What was understood?

387
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:39,392
The opportunity was there,
and we took it.

388
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:43,270
-Come on now, we're adults, aren't we?
-What's that supposed to mean?

389
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,273
-I thought we could have a good time.
-No, you didn't.

390
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,566
You thought you'd have a good time.

391
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,485
You didn't stop for a second
to think about me.

392
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,113
That's crazy. You knew the rules, Alex.

393
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,614
What rules?

394
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,785
Look, Alex. I like you.

395
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,539
And if I wasn't with somebody else,
maybe I'd be with you. But I am.

396
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,792
Please, don't justify yourself.
It's pathetic.

397
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,588
If you'd tell me to fuck off,
I'd have more respect for you.

398
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,135
All right then, fuck off.

399
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,763
And you get out!

400
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:38,951
I'm going.

401
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:42,538
Why don't you come over here
and say goodbye nicely?

402
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,332
Let's be friends.

403
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,388
Baby, no.

404
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,849
It's okay.

405
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,185
It's okay.

406
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:08,063
-Sorry if I upset you.
-It's okay, it's okay, really.

407
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,117
It's okay. All right. That's okay.

408
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,038
Your hands are all wet.

409
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:26,874
Jesus!

410
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,419
Jesus Christ!
Come here, come here, come here.

411
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,341
Hold on. Hold on.

412
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,227
Nice and tight.

413
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,217
Hi. Did you just call me?

414
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,971
I was in the shower. I heard the phone.

415
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,931
I thought it was you.

416
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:10,227
So, how are you?
Did you have a good day?

417
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,188
Yeah, yeah.

418
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:20,237
Really? That's terrific.
That's really terrific.

419
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,114
You sound excited.

420
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,243
Yeah.

421
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,289
No, I'm not against the idea, I mean...

422
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,751
Don't get me wrong. It's just the money.

423
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,130
Yeah.

424
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,511
Yeah.

425
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,307
Okay, darling. I love you.

426
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,560
Bye.

427
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,790
Alex?

428
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,716
How are you feeling?

429
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,804
Okay.

430
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,725
I gotta go.

431
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,521
Will you call me sometime?

432
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,941
You don't have to, if you don't want to.

433
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,609
No, I want to.

434
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,238
You promise me you're gonna go
see the doctor?

435
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,698
Okay.

436
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,458
Goodbye.

437
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,460
Goodbye.

438
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,716
-You take care.
-You, too.

439
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:34,747
Shit.

440
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,250
Look what I got.
Look what I got for you here.

441
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,086
A little spaghetti and meat sauce.
That's it, buddy.

442
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:44,757
We'll make an Italian out of you yet.
That's a good boy. Good dog.

443
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,800
Have a good one, yeah.

444
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,489
What are you doing here? It's 8:00 a.m.

445
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,950
I'm in the shitter, Martha. Got to be
in court by 2:00 and I'm really behind.

446
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,952
Will you do me a favor?
Cancel everything.

447
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,538
Then call Drimmer, tell him we're fine.

448
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,374
-I'll be there by 2:00.
-At 2:00? Okay.

449
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,503
Good morning, Martha.

450
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,637
-Daddy!
-Hey! Honey! Oh, God, I missed you.

451
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:32,888
-We had a great time!
-Yeah?

452
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,556
-I went for a walk with Grandpa...
-You did?

453
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,016
...and we saw rabbits
and chased them...

454
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,226
Well, good. Why don't you slow down?

455
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,644
I can't understand
one word you're saying.

456
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,938
-Daddy, I want a rabbit.
-I know you do, honey.

457
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,440
-Hi, darling. How are you?
-Good.

458
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,442
Good.

459
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,659
God, I missed you.

460
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,578
-Liar.
-I did.

461
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,583
Well, I should go away more often.

462
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,304
-I did this one.
-You did?

463
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,683
-Yes. Pick another one.
-I thought it was this row you picked.

464
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:21,562
-No. It was this one.
-I think you're in a lot of trouble.

465
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,000
-Okay.
-Now, pick a card, Dad.

466
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,169
Any card at all?

467
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,671
-Yeah? Where'd you learn this?
-Of course.

468
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,756
-Grandpa showed me.
-Oh.

469
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,594
Surprise.

470
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,350
So how was it?

471
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,022
Oh, come on, I'm a big boy. I can take it.

472
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,692
It had a place for rabbits.

473
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:12,988
Oh, no! She said it.
She said the R-word. Oh, no!

474
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,326
Not rabbits? Rabbits?

475
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,744
Rabbits!

476
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,246
-Rabbits!
-Not rabbits?

477
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,664
Rabbits!

478
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,250
Well, what can I tell you?
It's absolutely perfect.

479
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:28,462
-In this row?
-No.

480
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:32,591
So, when are you gonna come up
and take a look at it?

481
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,969
-Just for the hell of it?
-In this row?

482
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,847
How about tomorrow morning?

483
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,142
-Daddy, which row?
-You mean it?

484
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,312
If you get me back to the office
by 1:00, yeah.

485
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,147
Which row, Dad?

486
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:50,275
It's in this row, sweetheart.

487
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,257
Oh, I love this.

488
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:15,634
Dan?

489
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:20,222
Honey? Honey, come here.
I want you to see this.

490
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,437
Well?

491
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,691
It's... It's okay. It's okay.

492
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,654
-Come on, it's fantastic!
-It's great. It's great.

493
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,366
Just think of all the money we're gonna
save, not living in New York.

494
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,494
The local high school is excellent.
My own children went there.

495
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,622
-You see?
-This is a terrific area for kids.

496
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.
Is it okay if I go upstairs?

497
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,835
Please, go right ahead.
I'll wait for you down here.

498
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,295
Thank you.

499
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,966
You know, we still got to decorate.

500
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,760
We can fix up anything.
We can have painting parties.

501
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,722
Painting parties?
Beth, you're making me very nervous.

502
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,398
Well, now, look at this. This is fantastic.

503
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,527
This would make a terrific playroom.

504
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,529
What are you talking about, playroom?
This is my den!

505
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,072
It's a den!

506
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,867
I knew you were going to like it.

507
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,495
I like it.

508
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,802
I'll be in court. How you doing, Dan?

509
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,180
-Hi, Eunice. Martha back from lunch?
-Good afternoon, Mr. Gallagher.

510
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,640
-She just returned.
-Thank you.

511
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,108
Hi.

512
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,818
Hello.

513
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:00,530
This isn't a bad time, is it?
I was in the area. I figured that...

514
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,950
No, no.
You want to come into my office?

515
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,588
This is his account?

516
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:21,176
Hey, Danny. Danny, you gonna be
in your office a little later this...

517
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,429
-Excuse me? Have we met somewhere?
-I don't think so.

518
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,599
She looked at me first.

519
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,562
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

520
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,787
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

521
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,915
I was going to call you today.

522
00:45:56,546 --> 00:46:01,091
I... This is terribly embarrassing.

523
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:05,804
I just wanted to say sorry
for what happened.

524
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,057
I had no right to put you through all that.

525
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,979
Nothing happened, okay?

526
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,148
I was going through a bad time.

527
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:19,025
And everything was coming
to a crisis, and...

528
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,571
But I'm fine. I'm really all right.
And thank you.

529
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,575
-You don't have to thank me.
-Oh, yeah, I do.

530
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,619
A lot of guys would have just run away.

531
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:33,957
I don't know what I would have done
if you hadn't been there.

532
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:39,421
Well, you look good.
As a matter of fact, you look great.

533
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,090
Thanks.

534
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,553
So that's past?

535
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,430
Yeah.

536
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:54,227
-May I ask you one more favor?
-What's that?

537
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,859
I've got two tickets to Madame Butterfly,
two weeks from Thursday.

538
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:06,948
I'd really love it if you'd come with me,
kind of as a peace offering.

539
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:10,327
Well, that's very nice of you.

540
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,623
But I don't think it's a good idea.

541
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,209
-No strings attached.
-Alex.

542
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:21,254
I know, you don't have to explain.
I just thought I'd ask.

543
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,091
So...

544
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,723
I'll see you around sometime.

545
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,518
Okay.

546
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:49,908
Come here.

547
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,749
-Take care.
-Yeah. Goodbye.

548
00:47:58,668 --> 00:47:59,960
Goodbye.

549
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,574
All right. Come on, let's go, pal.

550
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:33,660
We're on a roll. We're on a roll.

551
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,291
-Let's see that action.
-Down the middle.

552
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,962
I like it. Very nice.

553
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:04,941
That is no good. I'm depressed.

554
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:35,805
What about
Rodgers v. whatchamacallit?

555
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,265
-Winitsky.
-Right.

556
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,393
I got your memo. You're going to
go for summary judgment?

557
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,771
Why not, Arthur?
I mean, the facts are not in dispute.

558
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,939
Rodgers admits
reading Winitsky's article.

559
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,651
The question is whether
he plagiarized it in his book.

560
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,444
As you know,
you can't copyright an idea,

561
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,154
only the expression of the idea,

562
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,824
and Rodgers sure as hell didn't use
any of the words in the book.

563
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,910
-Let me think about it.
-Okay.

564
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,037
So I hear you're about to
become a suburbanite.

565
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,206
Yeah, we're gonna take the big plunge.

566
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,917
-Got a buyer for the apartment?
-No.

567
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,920
-Got cold sweats about your escrow?
-Yeah.

568
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,714
But not about Rodgers vs. Winitsky?

569
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,466
-No, sir.
-Good.

570
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,302
He's still in a meeting.

571
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:18,848
Yes, I know.
I did expect him to be through by now.

572
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:25,021
I'd like you to have lunch with me
on Tuesday, if you're around.

573
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:27,649
Well, thank you, Arthur, that'd be great.
Let me just check my diary.

574
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,985
You are on his list of calls.
It's Alex Forrest.

575
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,447
Again? I thought you told her
I'd call her back.

576
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,741
-I did.
-All right. Put her on hold.

577
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:38,576
Would you mind holding?
He'll be free in a moment.

578
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,370
Tuesday would be great, Arthur.

579
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,623
-I look forward to it.
-Thank you. I will, too.

580
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,627
Put her through.

581
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,510
Hello?

582
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,140
Look, Alex, I thought we agreed
this was not a good idea.

583
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,394
Why?

584
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,483
Look, I'm sorry.
I thought you understood.

585
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:13,695
If I've misled you in some way,
I apologize.

586
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:17,031
But I don't think it's a good idea
if we talk to each other anymore.

587
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,366
Okay?

588
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,411
Goodbye.

589
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:31,755
Yeah, if she calls again,
tell her I'm not here. Thank you.

590
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,385
Wait, let me just...

591
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,513
Let me just look at you.

592
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,558
You're so beautiful.

593
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,269
Just so beautiful.

594
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,952
-Wouldn't you know?
-I know.

595
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:52,544
Open it, will you? That's my wife!

596
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:55,088
I wouldn't do it to my wife.

597
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:56,631
You know what? It's okay.

598
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,008
You don't know how many
injuries can happen?

599
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,177
-It's my wife he's doing it...
-Jimmy, don't terrorize them!

600
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:04,889
I'm a lawyer, I'm insured.
Oh, it's excited.

601
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,308
Now, don't forget who gave you this,
all right?

602
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:10,144
My cold sores are almost gone.
This is for you.

603
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:13,189
Ladies first. I use that term advisedly.

604
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,109
You're the best.

605
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:20,822
That's my wife! All right, ladies...
A little attention, please, ladies.

606
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:25,201
Gentlemen, my wife, ball and chain.

607
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,704
Mother of some of my children.

608
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,330
-I wouldn't be that confident about it.
-Absolutely.

609
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:35,003
Here is to Miller, Goodman,
Hurst and Gallagher!

610
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,964
-And to Mrs. Gallagher.
-Give me a break, will you, guys?

611
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,465
All he did is ask me to lunch, you know?

612
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,426
Yeah, and you're moving
to your country estate.

613
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,760
You'll forget you never knew us plebs.

614
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:45,680
Oh, no, wait a minute.
I read one of those self-help books.

615
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,432
Published by Robbins & Hart, of course.

616
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:50,351
Of course. Samurai Self-Help.

617
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:59,485
In it, it tells you how to deal
with the anxieties of your friends

618
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,905
as you move up the corporate ladder

619
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,990
and they stay put,
or God forbid, go down.

620
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:08,411
And in this book, it tells you not to
coddle your friends' anxieties.

621
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,706
So, I'm not gonna make
any false reassurances, guys.

622
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,000
I'm not gonna tell you you're gonna
be at the house every weekend.

623
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,835
I mean, let's face it.
Things have changed.

624
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,338
This is not a classless society.

625
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:22,091
As a matter of fact, this is it, guys.
Goodbye. Goodbye.

626
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,218
I knew he was gonna say that!

627
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,637
At least the man is running true to form.

628
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,513
Honey, I think we got to
make a clean break.

629
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,391
I mean, we're on a roll. We got to travel
light. You know, let's face it.

630
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,684
-Travel light. Exactly.
-Absolutely.

631
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:35,104
Thanks for the time
you've given us in your lives.

632
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:41,945
Here you, drink.

633
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,863
I want you with a lampshade
on your head by 10:00.

634
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:47,241
Why should today be any different,
you know what I mean?

635
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:51,287
Hello? Hello?

636
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,249
Here's to you.

637
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:57,877
Cheers.

638
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,298
Hello?

639
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,885
Hello!

640
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,259
Yeah?

641
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:54,267
Yeah, Richards. It's kind of late, isn't it?

642
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:01,858
If you refuse to take my phone calls
at the office, you leave me no choice.

643
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:06,279
It's 2:00 in the morning here.
Can't this wait till tomorrow morning?

644
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,865
Oh, is it awkward for you to talk?

645
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,285
You could say that, yeah.

646
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,538
I've got to see you.

647
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:20,209
I don't have the documentation
to answer that question right now,

648
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,795
but I'll call you from the office.

649
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,175
No. Meet me in front of the
Robbins & Hart building tomorrow. 6:00.

650
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:31,220
Don't disappoint me. Be there.

651
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,223
Okay.

652
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:40,229
This has got to stop.

653
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,482
Dan, if you'd agreed to see me,
I wouldn't have called you.

654
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:45,151
Do you get it, all right? It's over.
There is nothing between us.

655
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,738
You've mean you've had your fun,
now you just want a quiet life.

656
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,239
-Why are you doing this?
-Doing what?

657
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,407
You need help.

658
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,494
-Don't tell me what I need.
-You need a shrink.

659
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,662
Why are you so hostile?
I'm not your enemy.

660
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,081
Yeah, then why are you
trying to hurt me?

661
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,416
I'm not trying to hurt you, Dan.
I love you.

662
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:02,418
-You what?
-I love you.

663
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:06,756
-You don't even know me.
-Oh, how can you say that?

664
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,758
Alex, we spent a weekend
together, that's all.

665
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,344
You spent that second night.
You must like me a little.

666
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,513
Because I was concerned about you.
Jesus Christ!

667
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:15,014
Why do you read so much
into everything?

668
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:16,599
I mean, can't you understand?

669
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,935
I have a whole relationship
with someone else.

670
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:22,105
-I am very happy.
-Whole means complete.

671
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:24,941
If your life's so damn complete,
what were you doing with me?

672
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,443
Is this what you want to talk about,
our imaginary love affair?

673
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,112
I'm pregnant.

674
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,035
I saw my gynecologist on Monday.

675
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,955
Here's his card. You can call him.

676
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,213
You don't...

677
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:51,050
Use anything? No.

678
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:56,931
I had a very bad miscarriage last year.
I didn't think I could get pregnant.

679
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,309
And how do you know it's mine?

680
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,106
Because I don't sleep around.

681
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:18,119
I apologize.

682
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,748
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

683
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:25,418
Don't worry, all right? You're not going
to have to handle this alone.

684
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,003
Handle what?

685
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,340
The abortion. I'll take care of it.
I'll pay for it.

686
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:35,011
What makes you think
I want an abortion?

687
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,976
-You're not going to have the baby?
-Why not?

688
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,354
There are plenty of one-parent families.

689
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:49,108
-At least they don't end in divorce.
-I don't have a say in this?

690
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:53,112
I want this child.
It has nothing to do with you.

691
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:56,282
I want it whether you're going to
be a part of it or not.

692
00:58:56,366 --> 00:59:00,369
Then why are you telling me? Why?
Why not just go ahead and do it?

693
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:06,000
I was hoping that you would
want to be a part of it.

694
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,545
This is crazy. This is totally insane.

695
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,716
I'm 36 years old. It may be
my last chance to have a child.

696
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,051
Alex...

697
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:20,014
Just think what you're saying.

698
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,892
Just think about it.

699
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:27,563
We are going to live with this
for the rest of our lives.

700
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,233
I know that.

701
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:35,404
I've thought of that. I know how you feel.
It's a big thing.

702
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:39,450
But it doesn't have to be a problem.
Really, it doesn't.

703
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:43,120
You play fair with me,
I'll play fair with you.

704
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,797
"He led Agnes and Nellie
into the hall closet and shut the door.

705
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:56,384
"Agnes and Nellie and Oink
giggled and laughed in the dark.

706
00:59:56,468 --> 01:00:00,388
"Pearl listened outside the door.
'Oh, it works,' cried Nellie.

707
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:03,933
"'Of course,' said Oink.
'Look at the flying dog!' yelled Agnes.

708
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,768
"'Wow,' cried Nellie.

709
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:09,313
"Pearl frowned. 'Who cares
about flying dogs?' she said.

710
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:11,107
"Nobody heard her.

711
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,484
"'Look out for the worms!'
squealed Agnes.

712
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:16,279
"'Eek!' yelled Nellie and Agnes together.

713
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:21,575
"'Look at the monster cockroach!'
yelled Oink. 'Ick! Help!"'

714
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,823
So, you know what I did? Right.

715
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,074
I call the doctor.

716
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:09,452
And you know what he says?
"Congratulations!"

717
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,872
I can't even imagine what she told him.

718
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:15,958
Anyway, that's not the end of it.

719
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,878
So, after I talked to the doctor,

720
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:22,339
this morning, I broke into her apartment.

721
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,718
I know.
Me, a lawyer, breaking and entering.

722
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:26,844
I don't know, I'm looking for something,

723
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,721
anything to get a handle on
what I'm dealing with here.

724
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:33,100
I thought maybe if I can find out she was
sleeping with somebody else, you know.

725
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:35,186
I didn't find anything.

726
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:42,234
Anyway, I didn't find anything.

727
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:47,156
Jimmy, I don't know. I don't know
anything about family law, okay?

728
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,866
So you gotta help me now.

729
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:51,702
What kind of case
does she really have?

730
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:56,165
Well, it ain't good.

731
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,378
She keeps calling the apartment.

732
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:05,841
Every time Beth answers the phone,
she hangs up.

733
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,720
I'm scared, Jimmy. I...

734
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:13,516
I don't want to lose my family.

735
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,859
The facts as alleged are horrendous.

736
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,029
The instrument allegedly used
in all three cases

737
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:28,781
was an electronic shock device,

738
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:32,660
or stun gun, now standard
issue for New York City police.

739
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:35,621
The stun guns, which jolt
and incapacitate the body

740
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,666
by interrupting electrical waves
to the muscles,

741
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:42,419
are being used or experimented
with by 500 police agencies

742
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:43,587
across the country,

743
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,924
marketed as an alternative
to the nightsticks.

744
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:48,842
Operator, may I help you?

745
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:53,514
Operator, I've been trying to
get 555-812-9212.

746
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:55,474
The recording says
it's been disconnected.

747
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,560
Just a moment, please.

748
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,229
I'm sorry. The number's been changed
to an unlisted number.

749
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:01,647
Operator, this is a real emergency.

750
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,107
Please, you need to
give me that number.

751
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,276
I'm sorry, we're not allowed to
give out that information.

752
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:08,195
-Well, fuck you!
-Oh, my place or yours?

753
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:49,528
-I like it. I like it a lot.
-Well, we've been very happy here.

754
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:52,948
I'd definitely like to
think about it if I could.

755
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,327
-...to clean and all?
-Yes.

756
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:57,661
I have a lady that comes in

757
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,080
a couple times a week,
as a matter of fact.

758
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,207
And I can certainly give you her name
as well.

759
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,417
Oh, I'd love that.

760
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,211
And I have babysitters galore.
The whole works.

761
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,964
Whatever information you would need.

762
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:17,765
Hi, darling. Darling, this is Alex.
I'm sorry, I've forgotten your last name.

763
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:21,352
-Alex Forrest.
-Alex Forrest, this is my husband Dan.

764
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,356
Hi. Glad to meet you.

765
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,443
Nice to meet you.

766
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:34,823
-Haven't we met somewhere before?
-I don't think so. No.

767
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:42,206
No, we have. Weren't you at that party

768
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,458
at the Japanese place,
a few weeks ago?

769
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,543
Honey, the exercise book.

770
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,170
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

771
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:49,755
You're a lawyer?

772
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,966
And you work for the firm of...
What's the name?

773
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,677
Well, anyway...

774
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,970
We've definitely met.

775
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:01,809
-Well, you have a good memory.
-I never forget a face.

776
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:04,812
-It's a small world.
-It certainly is.

777
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:11,402
So, I gather you're going to the country?

778
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,862
-Moving to the country?
-Yes.

779
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:15,948
Have you found a place yet?

780
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,492
Actually, we found a place in Bedford.
Do you know it up there?

781
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,703
-Oh, it's beautiful.
-Yes.

782
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,872
So I guess you'll be moving out of here
almost immediately?

783
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:27,042
Actually, we wanted to do
some remodeling first.

784
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,670
I guess you're looking for a place
right away, aren't you?

785
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:32,673
Well, yeah. I'd kind of like to settle in.

786
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,883
Alex is expecting a baby.

787
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,762
Oh, that's...

788
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:43,267
Will you excuse me?
I have some work I've got to do.

789
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,770
Oh, I better run, too.

790
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,898
Thank you for the tea
and showing me the apartment.

791
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:53,569
-You're very welcome.
-I like it. I really like it.

792
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:57,656
-We've been very happy here.
-I'd like to think about it if I could.

793
01:07:57,741 --> 01:08:00,576
Let me give you our number
so you can call us direct.

794
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,077
Thank you.

795
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,930
-I'll keep in touch.
-Great.

796
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,266
-Bye-bye.
-Goodbye.

797
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,565
She seemed really interested.

798
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:37,112
It's funny, she didn't mention a husband.
I get the feeling that she's on her own.

799
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:40,699
-What is it? You seem down.
-No, no. I'm just tired.

800
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,637
-Hello?
-Yeah, hi, it's me.

801
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,639
Who?

802
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:08,310
You know damn well who it is, okay?
Now, come on. Let me in. I want to talk.

803
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,771
Oh, so now you want to talk?

804
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,998
So, what can I get you?

805
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:32,835
I've got Scotch, I've got vodka,
there's a nice Chablis...

806
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,963
Cut the shit, will you? Just cut it!

807
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,511
I don't know what you're up to,

808
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,596
but I'm going to tell you
it's going to stop right now.

809
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,849
No, it's not going to stop.
It's going to go on and on,

810
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,433
until you face up to your responsibilities.

811
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,269
What responsibilities?

812
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,771
I'm pregnant.
I'm going to have our child.

813
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:56,942
Alex, that's your choice, honey,
that has nothing to do with me.

814
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,694
I just want to be a part of your life.

815
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:01,363
Oh, this is the way you do it, huh?
Showing up at my apartment?

816
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:03,699
Well, what am I supposed to do?
You won't answer my calls.

817
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,117
You change your number. I mean...

818
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,703
I'm not going to be ignored, Dan.

819
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:14,543
You don't get it.
You just... You don't get it.

820
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,880
Don't you remember our weekend?

821
01:10:18,006 --> 01:10:20,007
Wasn't that wonderful?

822
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,886
Why can't we just be like that again?

823
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:28,640
I know you feel it, too.
I mean, what are you so afraid of?

824
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:31,310
Hey, just don't flatter yourself, Alex.

825
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:34,229
Go ahead, hit me. If you can't fuck me,
why don't you just hit me?

826
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:37,733
You're so sad. You know that, Alex?
Lonely and very sad.

827
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:40,235
Don't you ever pity me,
you smug bastard.

828
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,988
I'll pity you.
I'll pity you because you're sick.

829
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,658
Why? Because I won't allow you
to treat me like some slut

830
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:51,079
you can just bang a couple of times
and throw in the garbage?

831
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:56,376
I'm going to be the mother of your child.

832
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,587
I want a little respect.

833
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:03,926
You want respect?

834
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:09,097
-Respect.
-What are you doing?

835
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:12,601
Please, Dan. Please don't go.
I didn't mean it. Please, I'm sorry.

836
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,603
I'll tell your wife.

837
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,191
You tell my wife, I'll kill you.

838
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:24,613
It only takes a phone call!

839
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:33,455
Hello? Hello?

840
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:42,881
Got it.

841
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:46,969
Guys, that's on the second door
on the left of the landing.

842
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,428
Thank you.

843
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,973
Honey, you could've stayed
in the apartment.

844
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,308
Dan was in such a hurry to
get out of New York.

845
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:56,103
Momma, that's you, isn't it? Look.

846
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:58,230
Oh, Lord, put it away.

847
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:03,402
All right, easy on that door frame.
Good. Right. Nice. Just like a glove.

848
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:21,795
I got it. Sorry. I got it.

849
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:29,886
Hello?

850
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:32,597
Martha.

851
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:39,354
Martha. It's Martha.

852
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,249
Hello?

853
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:02,127
Hi, honey. How you doing?
Did the plumber come yet?

854
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,881
Oh, did he ever.

855
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:08,383
Well, I don't really want to
know about it, all right?

856
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:10,761
Hey, guess what I'm looking at.

857
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:13,889
-You got it?
-Yeah, yeah, I got it right here.

858
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:16,224
Or, I should say, I got her.

859
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,477
What's she like?

860
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,896
Well, she's cute. She looks like a rabbit.

861
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:24,191
I mean, she's white, she's got long ears,
little pink eyes.

862
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:27,235
-Soft.
-She sounds cute.

863
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,572
Yeah. Ellen doesn't know
anything about it?

864
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,784
No. She doesn't think
she's going to get one.

865
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,286
See what happens if you work here
too long, Eunice?

866
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,497
-Isn't he cute?
-Thank you.

867
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,291
Oh, I forgot. This arrived for you.

868
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:44,169
-Good night, Eunice.
-Good night, Mr. Gallagher.

869
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:48,298
And it's an inbound to Ewing on top.
Patrick gives it back to Gerald.

870
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:49,966
Gerald on the right to Sparrow.

871
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:51,718
Goes base line,
comes to the reverse side,

872
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:53,011
gives it off to Ewing.

873
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:56,640
He spins, knocks the man away,
throws the ball. Shot is good.

874
01:13:57,934 --> 01:13:59,434
Hey, Joaquin!

875
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,854
Holton on the outside.

876
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:06,233
Holding down a left-handed dribble
against Sparrow.

877
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:09,528
Now looking inside, looking in.
Finds no one...

878
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,502
Jesus fucking Christ!

879
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:53,673
Fucking bitch! Jesus Christ!

880
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:02,015
No. No. It had something to do
with the electrical system.

881
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:05,143
The whole goddamn thing blew up.
It was smoking.

882
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:07,229
All right, honey.
I'll see you in a little while.

883
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:28,500
Mr. Gallagher?
You forgot your contract.

884
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,751
Thanks.

885
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:39,529
Hello, Dan. Are you surprised?

886
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:43,283
This is what you've reduced me to.

887
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:47,620
I guess you thought you'd get away
with it. Well, you can't.

888
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:54,502
Because part of you is growing
inside of me, and that's a fact, Dan,

889
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:58,340
and you'd better start
learning how to deal with it.

890
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:04,179
Because, you know, I feel you.

891
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:07,057
I taste you.

892
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:09,100
I think you.

893
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:11,811
I touch you.

894
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:16,733
Can you understand? Can you?

895
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:24,366
I'm just asking you to
acknowledge your responsibilities.

896
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,744
I mean, is that so bad?

897
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:33,041
I don't think so.
I don't think it's unreasonable.

898
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,919
And, you know, another thing is

899
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:40,673
that you thought
that you could just walk into my life

900
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:46,304
and turn it upside down, without
a thought for anyone but yourself.

901
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,705
You know what you are, Dan?

902
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:15,750
You're a cock-sucking son of a bitch.

903
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:19,838
I hate you.
I bet you don't even like girls, do you?

904
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,133
You flaming fucking faggot!

905
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,688
Daddy! Thank you.

906
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:21,483
You're welcome, honey.
Do you like her?

907
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:22,901
A bunny!

908
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,821
You like it?

909
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:26,881
You thought you could just walk
into my life and turn it upside down,

910
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:29,926
without a thought
for anyone but yourself.

911
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,345
You know what you are, Dan?

912
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:35,807
You're a cock-sucking son of a bitch.

913
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:42,480
You are.
I bet you don't even like girls, do you?

914
01:21:43,274 --> 01:21:47,235
They probably scare you. I know I do.

915
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,155
So you're scared of me, aren't you?

916
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,534
You're fucking frightened of me.
You're afraid.

917
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:55,660
You're afraid, aren't you?

918
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:59,163
You gutless, heartless, spineless,
fucking son of a bitch.

919
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:02,458
I hate you.
You deserve everything you get.

920
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:06,087
-Jesus Christ!
-Sorry.

921
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,257
I was wondering what you were
doing up so late.

922
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,883
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

923
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:14,304
No, it's okay.
I was listening to a deposition.

924
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,014
I couldn't sleep.

925
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:18,725
Come on.
I'm going to give you a back rub.

926
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:21,894
-Back rub?
-Brandy, a back rub.

927
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:25,523
-You won't know what hit you.
-Sounds good.

928
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:32,989
My client wants it stopped.

929
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,659
He just wants an end
to the harassment.

930
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,954
He's positive it was this woman
who trashed the car?

931
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,664
Yes. Yes, of course.

932
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,584
-Any witnesses?
-No.

933
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,255
Welcome to file a complaint
if it'd make him feel better.

934
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,091
I mean, there's not a lot
you can do without proof.

935
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:55,595
Look, Lieutenant,
this woman is completely irrational.

936
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,138
There's no telling what she could do.

937
01:22:57,264 --> 01:22:59,974
We can't go around arresting people
for what they might do. You know that.

938
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,478
I'm not asking you to arrest her.
I... He simply...

939
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,318
He wants her warned.

940
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,783
Well, we could talk to her.
It may make things public.

941
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:18,242
He's not going to like that.

942
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,745
It may even aggravate the situation
with the girl.

943
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:21,954
How's that?

944
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:24,874
Well, whatever resentment
she's feeling,

945
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:27,210
she's probably got it out of her system.

946
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:30,213
And any action we take
could provoke her.

947
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:35,468
What if she didn't get it out
of her system? What then?

948
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:39,847
You have to catch her in the act.
Then we can bring charges.

949
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:42,475
Well, you say he just has to
sit there and take it?

950
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:46,354
It's his bed.
I'm afraid he's going to have to lie in it.

951
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,581
Come on. Come on in, come on in.

952
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:14,090
Come on, Ellen,
we're going to Grandma's.

953
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:16,592
Grandma's? Let's go.

954
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:21,556
Come on, Quince.
Quincy, come on, hurry up.

955
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:24,726
Come on, get on in. Hurry up.

956
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:27,770
Watch his tail, sweetie.
Make him sit down.

957
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:46,330
-See you didn't get your car back.
-No, it's a total write-off.

958
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:50,877
-The electrical system's just shot.
-Extraordinary, those foreign cars.

959
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:53,171
-There you are, dear.
-Thank you.

960
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,174
-Want to try it again, sweetie?
-Okay.

961
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:57,550
Okay.

962
01:24:58,051 --> 01:24:59,218
So?

963
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:05,933
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

964
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:07,769
Very good.

965
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:09,645
-You want to do it one more time.
-Okay.

966
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:11,397
Do it with your hat and do the bow,

967
01:25:11,482 --> 01:25:14,567
so when you actually do it,
you know what you're doing.

968
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,903
-Let me see your bow.
-Okay.

969
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:20,907
And, what do you say?

970
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:25,787
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

971
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:29,123
-Very good. You got that.
-Ellen. Ellen.

972
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:30,625
Come here.

973
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,880
-That was good.
-Thank you.

974
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:40,092
That was really good.
That was so good.

975
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:45,848
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

976
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:47,975
Thank you, darling.

977
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,835
Come on, Quincy.

978
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:39,086
-Daddy!
-What?

979
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:45,176
Whitey's gone!

980
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:46,594
Dan!

981
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:48,179
Whitey's gone!

982
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:12,286
It's all right, darling.
It's going to be okay, sweetie.

983
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:15,623
You should try and get some sleep.

984
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:43,067
-Is she okay?
-She's asleep.

985
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:49,657
-Did you call the police?
-Not yet, no.

986
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:51,117
Why not?

987
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:56,497
Honey, we've got to talk.

988
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,173
What is it?

989
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:10,011
I know who did this.

990
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:14,640
You do? Who?

991
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:18,811
Remember the girl
who came to the apartment?

992
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:23,315
The one I met
in the Japanese restaurant?

993
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:27,653
The one with the blonde hair.

994
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:37,204
You're scaring me.

995
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:44,045
What is it?

996
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:47,882
Did you have an affair with her?

997
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:49,341
Yes.

998
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:05,066
Beth?

999
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:12,948
Beth, I am so sorry.

1000
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:19,288
The last thing I ever wanted to do
was to hurt you.

1001
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,668
Are you...

1002
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:28,881
Are you in love with her?

1003
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:34,845
No, no. It was one night.
It didn't mean anything.

1004
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:50,486
What has it got to do
with what's happened?

1005
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:56,700
She's pregnant.

1006
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:00,204
She's...

1007
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:02,957
It's yours?

1008
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:07,128
I don't know. That's what she says.
Honey, listen to me. Beth, please.

1009
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:10,506
Get out! I want you out of here.
I want you out of this house!

1010
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:13,759
And I want you out now.
How could you do that? I hate you!

1011
01:31:13,844 --> 01:31:16,011
Understand what I'm saying, honey.

1012
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,806
I don't want to hear it!
I don't want to hear any of it!

1013
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:21,934
Please, just listen to me, will you, Beth?
Please. Listen to me.

1014
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:24,270
What is the matter with you?

1015
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:37,176
Dan, what a pleasant surprise.

1016
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:43,557
It's over, Alex. It's all finished.
I told Beth, she knows all about it.

1017
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:47,019
Sure. You haven't got the balls.

1018
01:32:48,438 --> 01:32:50,606
Why don't you speak to her?

1019
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:54,944
Why would I want to talk to her?

1020
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:09,250
This is Beth Gallagher.

1021
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:13,629
If you ever come near my family again,
I'll kill you, you understand?

1022
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:42,908
That's the last one, Ellen. I mean it.

1023
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:03,470
Hello? Hi, Daddy.

1024
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,976
When are you coming home?

1025
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:15,983
Honey, I don't know.
How are you doing?

1026
01:34:17,944 --> 01:34:19,111
Good.

1027
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:22,323
Okay.

1028
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:26,910
Yeah.

1029
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:29,621
Grandpa taught me a new card trick.

1030
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:32,207
Oh, did he?
What, the one with the jacks?

1031
01:34:32,334 --> 01:34:34,501
No, the one with the kings.

1032
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:37,671
Good.

1033
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:42,968
I won't.

1034
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,722
Good.

1035
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:52,811
How's Mommy?

1036
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:55,564
Send her my love.

1037
01:34:55,982 --> 01:34:57,983
Okay. Goodbye.

1038
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,319
Daddy?

1039
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:03,489
Call me tomorrow.

1040
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:08,369
I will. I promise.
You be sure you tell Mommy I called.

1041
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:10,329
I will.

1042
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:13,665
Love you a lot, too. Bye-bye.

1043
01:35:18,588 --> 01:35:20,047
Bye-bye.

1044
01:36:02,382 --> 01:36:05,134
Hi, Mrs. Gallagher.
Did you forget something?

1045
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:06,468
I came to get Ellen.

1046
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:09,930
Ellen? Why, I thought you picked her
up already.

1047
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:13,142
Well, I'm sure she's left already.

1048
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:15,936
Betty? Is Ellen in here with you?

1049
01:36:16,062 --> 01:36:17,855
-She's gone home already.
-Are you sure?

1050
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:20,774
I'm positive. She's not inside
and she's not in the playground.

1051
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:24,153
-I thought you picked her up.
-Who did pick her up?

1052
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:26,905
Well, don't worry.
She can't have gone far.

1053
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:30,117
-You don't understand.
-I'll check her locker.

1054
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:37,916
-Alicia, where's Ellen?
-She's gone.

1055
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,337
Call the police.

1056
01:36:47,469 --> 01:36:48,844
Ellen.

1057
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:52,473
Please, let her be all right.

1058
01:36:56,102 --> 01:36:57,436
Christ.

1059
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:02,149
Where are you?

1060
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:11,325
Ellen! Ellen!

1061
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:19,833
Ellen!

1062
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:22,085
Ellen!

1063
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,714
Look out!

1064
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,234
Where are you?

1065
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:55,846
-Bye-bye, Ellen.
-Bye.

1066
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:59,766
Ellen, can I have a kiss?

1067
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:05,272
-Bye.
-Bye.

1068
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:19,286
Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient
named Gallagher. I'm her husband.

1069
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:21,955
Room 22 at the end of the corridor.

1070
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:25,292
-Is she going to be okay?
-Yeah, she'll be fine.

1071
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:28,545
She was very lucky. It might have been
a lot worse. A lot worse.

1072
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:32,215
-Daddy!
-Hi, baby. Oh, God, I missed you.

1073
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:33,967
I missed you, honey.

1074
01:39:34,052 --> 01:39:36,970
Are you okay?
Have you seen Mommy yet?

1075
01:39:37,055 --> 01:39:38,305
Yeah.

1076
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:42,559
Okay, you stay here with Granny.
I'm going to go see Mommy.

1077
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:55,155
Howard.

1078
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:12,756
You'll be okay.

1079
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:11,064
-You guys want to go to Ziggy's first?
-Yeah!

1080
01:41:11,149 --> 01:41:12,566
-It's a hot place.
-That's a good idea.

1081
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:14,568
All right! You know...

1082
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:08,051
I came in here before.

1083
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:09,135
I tried to explain the situation to you,

1084
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:10,303
you didn't want to listen to me.

1085
01:45:10,429 --> 01:45:14,724
Now, the woman took my kid
and that's kidnapping, right? Am I right?

1086
01:45:14,809 --> 01:45:15,976
My wife's in the hospital.

1087
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,143
She could've been killed!

1088
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:18,228
If you're not going to
do something about...

1089
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:21,314
Take it easy, okay.
You don't have to shout.

1090
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:23,483
Okay.

1091
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:26,653
Okay. What are you going to do?

1092
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:32,409
We'll tell New York to pick her up
and bring her in for questioning, okay?

1093
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:35,328
Okay.

1094
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:38,081
Okay, then I'm...

1095
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:42,085
I'm going to go to the hospital tomorrow,

1096
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:43,795
pick my wife up

1097
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:48,133
and hopefully,
I'll be home for the weekend

1098
01:45:49,593 --> 01:45:51,803
if you need to talk to me.

1099
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:00,854
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1100
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:05,316
You're welcome.

1101
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:27,797
How's that feel?
Good and warm? Good.

1102
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:31,968
Are you all cozy?

1103
01:46:32,053 --> 01:46:34,220
Is Mommy going to be all right?

1104
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:38,975
Mommy's going to be fine, honey.
She's going to be fine.

1105
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:42,228
Are you going to stay with us?

1106
01:46:45,691 --> 01:46:48,234
I'm going to stay with you, honey.

1107
01:46:51,155 --> 01:46:53,323
Now, you go to sleep, okay?

1108
01:46:56,494 --> 01:46:58,244
Good night, doll.

1109
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:02,415
Forever?

1110
01:47:04,502 --> 01:47:06,211
I promise, honey.

1111
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:31,027
You mean the detectives in Manhattan
have no idea where she's gone?

1112
01:47:31,112 --> 01:47:33,530
They don't know where she is?

1113
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:39,077
Yeah.

1114
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,253
No, I see. I see.

1115
01:47:48,754 --> 01:47:50,130
All right.
If you get any more information,

1116
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:51,714
you'll be sure and let me know,
won't you, Lieutenant?

1117
01:47:51,799 --> 01:47:53,925
Thank you very much. Good night.

1118
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:56,970
I think we just found out
where the beef is.

1119
01:47:57,096 --> 01:48:00,390
Okay. Cathy and Charlie, who do you
think held out for the most money?

1120
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,892
The one who has to try out
the mysterious new shampoo,

1121
01:48:02,977 --> 01:48:04,894
or the man who has to try
on the sundress.

1122
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:07,814
And remember,
it's possible that one of them...

1123
01:48:10,776 --> 01:48:12,652
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

1124
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,322
How does the arm feel?

1125
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:17,824
It hurts.

1126
01:48:18,659 --> 01:48:21,286
Get you some more painkillers.

1127
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:23,955
Okay.

1128
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:30,670
Welcome back. Our contestants
have been asked to decide...

1129
01:48:45,186 --> 01:48:46,436
Thanks.

1130
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:49,689
Now, you just holler
if you need anything else, all right?

1131
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:51,691
I'd love a cup of tea.

1132
01:48:52,193 --> 01:48:53,651
You got it.

1133
01:50:34,295 --> 01:50:36,379
What are you doing here?

1134
01:50:42,136 --> 01:50:43,886
Why are you here?

1135
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:53,646
He tried to say goodbye to me last night.

1136
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:56,482
But he couldn't,

1137
01:50:56,650 --> 01:51:00,570
because he and I feel the same way
about each other.

1138
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:07,660
Do you know how it is when you meet
somebody for the first time

1139
01:51:10,414 --> 01:51:13,124
and you get this instant attraction?

1140
01:51:22,926 --> 01:51:25,178
And don't you think I understand
what you're doing?

1141
01:51:25,304 --> 01:51:28,264
You're trying to move him
into the country.

1142
01:51:28,432 --> 01:51:31,017
And you're keeping him away from me.

1143
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:35,521
And you're playing happy family.

1144
01:51:36,607 --> 01:51:41,986
But you wouldn't understand that
because you're so selfish.

1145
01:51:45,824 --> 01:51:49,786
And he told me about you.
He told me about you.

1146
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:51,704
He was very honest.

1147
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:07,178
If you weren't so stupid, you'd know that.
But you're so stupid.

1148
01:52:07,262 --> 01:52:10,890
You're just so stupid,
you're a stupid, selfish bitch!

1149
01:52:11,016 --> 01:52:12,600
You're a stupid, selfish bitch!

1150
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:31,244
Dan!

1151
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:38,292
Dan! Dan!

1152
01:52:41,255 --> 01:52:42,422
Dan!

1153
01:52:48,429 --> 01:52:49,595
Dan!

1154
01:52:51,932 --> 01:52:52,932
Dan!

1155
01:52:55,769 --> 01:52:56,936
No!

1156
01:53:00,732 --> 01:53:02,732
Stop!
