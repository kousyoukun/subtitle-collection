3
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,599
There is one thing
I'd like to ask you.

4
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:04,292
How do they make that slime?

5
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:07,670
First they take some water.

6
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:11,966
Then they add some jello powder
and some flour. Sometimes soap.

7
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,635
Then they dump it over me.

8
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,304
- We'd better get going.
- Where from?

9
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:20,224
I've always wondered that, too.
I just don't know.

10
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,231
Interesting. Is it always green?

11
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:30,526
It usually is,
but I guess it could be red.

12
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,950
Or it could be blue.

13
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,796
Or yellow.

14
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:54,967
- Daddy, telephone.
- Thanks, darling.

15
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,564
Hello?

16
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:11,401
Hildy, I'm fine.
I just stubbed my toe.

17
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:14,904
Hang on one second.
Honey, it's Hildy.

18
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,864
I'll call her back.

19
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:21,369
She's in the bathroom. She wants
to know what you're wearing.

20
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,038
My black suit.

21
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:27,041
She'll wear a black dress.

22
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,044
It's business.
You know how those things are.

23
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,924
Ellen, don't mess with
my make-up. I'm late.

24
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,802
- Is the red dress OK?
- It's perfect.

25
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:44,058
Did you hear that?
You got it. OK, see you later.

26
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:48,771
I told you a million times
not to play with my lipstick.

27
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:53,234
So when are you gonna listen to me?
Silly girl.

28
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:58,698
Honey, where's my blue suit?

29
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,533
On the back of the door.

30
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,333
Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

31
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:12,170
Shit, shit, shit.

32
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,638
- Hi.
- Hi, Christine.

33
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,182
- How are you doing?
- Good.

34
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:27,769
- Where's Mommy?
- Mom? She's in the bathroom.

35
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:33,191
I got you a present.
You want to see what it is?

36
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:34,734
Do you like it?

37
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:37,987
OK. Come on, let's go find Mommy.

38
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:43,451
So then,
she's talking to me about sales.

39
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:56,339
Chuck. How are you?
Will you make it, Friday?

40
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:59,383
- I'm there.
- We need you. We're in the cellar.

41
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:01,135
Is my hair OK?

42
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,471
- You look great.
- I'm serious.

43
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:06,933
- You're the prettiest woman here.
- You liar.

44
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,775
- Hiya, Bob. How are you?
- Glad you could make it.

45
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,737
Sorry about the meeting tomorrow,
but we've got a crisis.

46
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,113
I understand. My wife Beth.

47
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,990
- Bob Drimmer.
- Pleased to meet you.

48
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,369
- I hope you like sushi.
- I love it.

49
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:29,163
- How did he hurt his neck?
- Screwing his wife.

50
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,333
- Are you serious?
- You should see his wife.

51
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,836
They took her out on a stretcher.

52
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,755
- You guys are bad.
- Champagne?

53
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,882
Let's go. Champagne for everyone.

54
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,510
- With a twist.
- Four champagnes.

55
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,887
Excuse me. Hi.

56
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,767
How are you keeping?

57
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,686
Excuse me.

58
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:55,731
Jesus! Thank you. Fuck.

59
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,192
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

60
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,736
What cultural event
are we celebrating?

61
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:04,615
- Some exercise manual.
- Not another one?

62
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,242
This one's different.

63
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:09,704
Based on ancient Samurai discipline.

64
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,376
Look at this guy.
What is that, part of the ritual?

65
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,253
Hey...

66
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,172
Hi, there.

67
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:27,889
- If looks could kill...
- You haven't lost your touch.

68
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:29,765
I think she likes me.

69
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,351
I think you're batting zero for two.

70
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:37,315
She was undressing me with her eyes.
She had trouble with the buttons.

71
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,234
A signed copy.

72
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,998
- Here you are, ma'am.
- Thank you.

73
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:00,087
- Can I get a champagne, please?
- You got it.

74
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:08,638
I'm not saying anything.
I'm not even gonna look.

75
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,264
Was it that bad?

76
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,518
I was glad I wasn't on the receiving
end of that one. Cheers.

77
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:17,229
I hate it
when guys come on like that.

78
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:22,068
Jimmy's OK. He's just a little
insecure, like the rest of us.

79
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:27,365
- My name is Dan Gallagher.
- Alex Forrest.

80
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,992
Nice to meet you.
What is your connection here?

81
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,995
I'm an editor at Robbins & Hart.
And you?

82
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,415
I'm with Miller, Goodman and Hurst.
I do your legal work.

83
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,626
I haven't seen you at their office.

84
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,671
I've just been with them
a couple of weeks.

85
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,263
I have to go.

86
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,808
- Is that your wife?
- Yeah.

87
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,476
Better run along.

88
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,229
It was very nice to meet you.

89
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,738
"Obsessed with your body."
What does that mean?

90
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,615
- Give me a break.
- Give you a break?

91
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,701
What does this mean?

92
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,704
How many did you buy?

93
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,297
- Thanks again, Christine.
- Any time.

94
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,174
Goodnight.

95
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,185
Aren't you forgetting something?

96
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:50,531
Quincy, let's hit it, pal.

97
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:02,168
You're such a good boy, yes.

98
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:08,174
You did such good business.
You did good business.

99
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,759
You're the best boy.

100
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,552
Goodnight.

101
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,563
It's just for tonight, honey.

102
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,485
When you see the house,
don't show any interest.

103
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,821
- Otherwise we can't negotiate.
- Stop worrying.

104
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:36,160
- Ellen, are you chewing gum?
- Why worry? We can't afford it.

105
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,912
Just up the road from Mom and Dad.

106
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:41,248
- Another reason not to buy it.
- I didn't hear that.

107
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,209
We can't afford the goddamn thing.

108
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:46,921
Come on. Hold on, honey.

109
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:51,967
Let's not worry about it.
I haven't seen the damn place yet.

110
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,553
I may not even like it.

111
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,932
Ellen? The gum? Thank you.

112
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:01,936
Come on, Quincy.

113
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:05,940
Quincy's got to stay with Daddy.
Daddy's gonna be all alone.

114
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:08,692
Sorry, Quincy.
Don't forget to walk him.

115
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:12,446
- I promise.
- I hope you have a good meeting.

116
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,157
- OK. See you tomorrow night.
- Love you.

117
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,015
The third time up,
he looked like a jellyfish.

118
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:45,479
- Hi, Bob.
- Sorry to ruin your weekend.

119
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,023
- Give my apologies to your wife.
- David.

120
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,775
Help yourself.

121
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,863
- How are you feeling?
- Don't ask. Henry's away.

122
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:57,366
I asked Alex Forrest to stand in.
Anybody know where she is?

123
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,785
She's on her way.

124
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,582
Since we've got some time, tell us
what happened to your neck, Bob.

125
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:09,420
That's cute. Very cute.

126
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:13,632
- Sorry I'm late.
- Dan, this is Alex Forrest.

127
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,593
- We've met before. Hi.
- Hello.

128
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:20,431
- OK. Can we get started, Dan?
- Here's the story.

129
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,266
You want to publish a novel

130
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:26,437
about a Senator from New Jersey
who's fooling around.

131
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:30,065
A Congressman from Ohio claims
the character's based upon him.

132
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,568
He's filed an injunction.

133
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:37,198
The Congressman's bald. This guy's
not and he's from a different state.

134
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:39,700
- Without those books we're screwed.
- Fine.

135
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:43,037
But to prove that
it's not based on this Congressman,

136
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:45,497
I have to know the truth.

137
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:50,753
Now, strictly between
these walls, all right?

138
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:55,216
Did the author have an affair
with Mr Ohio or not?

139
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,805
Yeah, she did.

140
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:05,100
But she had a lot of affairs
with other politicians.

141
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,728
Any one of them
could make the same claim.

142
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:11,690
She swears this character's
fictitious. I just phoned her.

143
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,234
And you believe her?

144
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,612
Yeah, I believe her.

145
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:21,825
Now that's on the table, what can
we do to lift that injunction?

146
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:24,536
Can we get to the Congressman?

147
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,666
They take campaign contributions.
Can we buy or frighten them off?

148
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:33,170
Is there something in his past?
We need to use some leverage.

149
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,646
Give me a break, will you?

150
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,150
Come on.

151
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,364
Come on!

152
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,408
Come on.

153
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,712
- Was it made in Taiwan?
- Yeah. These are tough to find.

154
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,339
Wait, wait. Here. We got one.

155
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,634
Come on!

156
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,472
Want to go get a drink
until it stops?

157
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,516
Yeah, I'd love it.

158
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,518
Come on.

159
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,734
The strangest case I ever handled?

160
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:40,529
The truth was,
I never actually handled the case.

161
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,115
But the strangest case
I ever came near to

162
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,534
was when my parents got divorced.

163
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,579
My mother asked me to represent her.

164
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,497
- You're kidding?
- That's what I said.

165
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,667
She said,
"You know what an asshole he is."

166
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,628
"You've been a witness
to this marriage for 29 years."

167
00:13:56,754 --> 00:14:00,674
- This is coming from my mother.
- How did you get out of it?

168
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,719
Well, you can't
turn your mom down.

169
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,722
So, I escaped on a technicality.

170
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,767
- Which was what?
- I didn't practise family law.

171
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,438
It was true, you know.
And she bought it.

172
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,941
- You're making it up.
- Could I make that up?

173
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,612
Waiter?

174
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,785
- I've got a lot of pull here.
- I noticed.

175
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,371
They know me well. Miss?

176
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,206
- Coffee?
- I'd love one.

177
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:33,749
Two coffees, please.

178
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,670
Well, I tell you...

179
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,465
- Do you want one?
- No, thank you.

180
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:45,636
It's funny being a lawyer.
It's like being a doctor.

181
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:49,848
Everybody's telling you
their innermost secrets.

182
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:53,560
- You must have to be discreet.
- God, yeah.

183
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,396
Are you?

184
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,525
Am I what?

185
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,861
Discreet.

186
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,121
Yes, I'm discreet.

187
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:14,623
Me, too.

188
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,383
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

189
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,968
Why don't you have a date?

190
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,345
- It's Saturday night.
- I did have a date.

191
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,099
I stood him up.
That was the phone call I made.

192
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:37,938
Does that make you feel good?

193
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,065
It doesn't make me feel bad.

194
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,486
So, where's your wife?

195
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,364
Where's my wife?

196
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:53,454
My wife is in the country with her
parents, visiting for the weekend.

197
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,250
You're here with a strange girl
being a naughty boy.

198
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,669
Having dinner with somebody
isn't a crime.

199
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,214
Not yet.

200
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,303
- Will it be?
- I don't know. What do you think?

201
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,431
I definitely think it's up to you.

202
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,813
I can't say yet.
I haven't made up my mind.

203
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,028
At least you're very honest.

204
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,910
We were attracted to each other
at the party. That was obvious.

205
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:37,331
You're on your own for the night.
That's also obvious.

206
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,379
We're two adults.

207
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,471
Let's get the check.

208
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:43,332
- That was great.
- Thank God.

209
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,965
Are you feeling energetic?

210
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,219
What do you have in mind?

211
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,606
I live up here.

212
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:52,025
- In this building?
- Yeah.

213
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:01,743
Well, where do I get a cab, you know?

214
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,422
Ever done it in an elevator?

215
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,758
- Not recently.
- I bet you haven't.

216
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,583
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

217
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,544
How are you?

218
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:26,221
Hi. What happened to you?

219
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,766
I tried you earlier.
I guess you're not back yet.

220
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:33,603
I'm gonna go to bed now,
so call me in the morning. Bye-bye.

221
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:56,167
Hello? Dan, darling,
we were expecting you.

222
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,837
- I'm sorry. I had work to do.
- That's OK.

223
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:02,507
- We wanted you to see that house.
- Next time.

224
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:03,925
You want to speak to Beth?

225
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,762
- Yes, please.
- Hold on a second.

226
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:12,434
The phone, it's Dan. Here you are.

227
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,397
Hello. What happened to you?

228
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:19,900
Hi.

229
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,903
Nothing. I just had
dinner with Bill last night.

230
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,654
How is he?

231
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:30,243
He's... Bill's, you know...
Bill's Bill, the same as usual.

232
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,870
Is he still with that girl?

233
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:35,248
Well, he wasn't last night.
I think it's over.

234
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,292
He wouldn't talk about it.

235
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:42,005
- Are you getting any work done?
- Yeah, I'm working.

236
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,300
There's spaghetti sauce
in the refrigerator.

237
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,886
Great. OK. How's Ellen?

238
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:53,266
She is having the best time.
I just hope that Dad survives it.

239
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,310
I don't know how to tell you this.

240
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:59,439
But... she wants a rabbit.

241
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,316
Beth, no rabbits.

242
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,402
Jesus Christ!
We're turning into Noah's Ark.

243
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,198
Please! Give her a kiss, all right?
But no promises.

244
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,617
- All right.
- When are you coming home?

245
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:14,454
It's complicated.
There's a problem with the house.

246
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:16,790
They sold it.

247
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:21,336
Very funny. No. We can't see it
until late this afternoon.

248
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,506
I'm not up to fighting the traffic.
I'll come in tomorrow.

249
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,466
What about school?

250
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:30,053
She's only five.
What will she miss? Trigonometry?

251
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,890
Yeah, OK. I'll see you
when I get home from work.

252
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,142
OK. See you tomorrow.

253
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:39,270
OK, thanks. Have a good time.

254
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,529
Yeah?

255
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:52,200
What happened? I woke up.
You weren't here. I hate that.

256
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:02,210
- You didn't get my note?
- What note?

257
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:05,255
I left you a note right by your bed.

258
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:19,602
That's nice. I thought we were going
to spend the day together.

259
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:23,273
Look, I got so much work
to do today. I can't.

260
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,234
Why don't you come over?
I'll cook us lunch.

261
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:29,029
The poor dog
hasn't been out of the house.

262
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:30,739
I gotta take him out.

263
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:36,244
Bring the dog. I love animals.
I'm a great cook. Come on.

264
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,955
Listen, I'd love to, but I can't.

265
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,960
Do what you have to do, then come
over afterwards. We can eat late.

266
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:51,593
Or you can work here.
I won't disturb you, I promise.

267
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,386
I'll be a good girl.

268
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:58,600
You don't give up, do you?

269
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,910
Good boy.

270
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,164
Quincy, no!

271
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:25,210
I got it! I got it!

272
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:29,297
Quincy, cover me. Come on. He fires.

273
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:33,468
- OK.
- She's got it. It's back.

274
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,304
Over the head. He's got it.

275
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:52,654
Dan, can you hear me?

276
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,280
My God!

277
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,040
- You bastard.
- Your face!

278
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,875
Your face!

279
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,546
- That was a shitty thing to do.
- Sorry. I was fooling around.

280
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,465
My father died of a heart attack.

281
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:17,512
I was seven. It happened
right in front of me.

282
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:21,975
Honey, I'm sorry.

283
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,771
I had no idea. If I had,
I never would have done that.

284
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,403
Wait, he didn't die? He's alive?

285
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:37,323
He's alive and well
and living in Phoenix.

286
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:45,165
I guess you certainly got me,
didn't you?

287
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,684
Let's hear it.

288
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:11,065
I hope you like spaghetti.
Specialty of the house.

289
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,276
It goes with the opera.

290
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:22,535
It smells so good.

291
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:32,170
- Anything else for me to do?
- Just make yourself at home.

292
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:35,089
- Change the tape if you want.
- No, this is great.

293
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,342
I love Madame Butterfly.

294
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:41,638
- Really? It's my favorite opera.
- Mine, too.

295
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,932
First opera I ever saw.

296
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:49,103
My father took me to the old Met.
I was five years old.

297
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:52,649
- Did it make any sense?
- I got most of it.

298
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:58,238
There was this US sailor setting up
house with this Japanese lady.

299
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,907
That was all fine.

300
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:07,163
But in the final act,
after he left her,

301
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:11,668
my father told me,
"She's gonna kill herself."

302
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,378
And I was terrified.

303
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:17,632
I was...
I climbed right underneath the chair.

304
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,843
It's right here.

305
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:23,763
This is it.

306
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,401
It's funny.

307
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:40,238
- What?
- It's one of the only times

308
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:44,826
I remember my father being nice
to me when I was a kid.

309
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,537
Comforting me at Madame Butterfly.

310
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,033
What?

311
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,453
What are you thinking?

312
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:34,208
I was wondering why all
the interesting guys are married.

313
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:40,298
Maybe you find them interesting
because you can't have them.

314
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,343
How long have you been married?

315
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:47,055
Nine years.

316
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,143
- Do you have any kids?
- I got a six-year-old girl.

317
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,980
Sounds good.

318
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,572
- Yeah, I'm lucky.
- So what are you doing here?

319
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:16,209
Boy, you know how to ask them.

320
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:20,296
No, I really want to know.

321
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:23,633
I had a wonderful time last night.
I'd like to see you again.

322
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,803
Is that so terrible?

323
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,097
No.

324
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:31,933
I just don't think it's possible.

325
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:40,483
It's really strange.
I feel like I know you already.

326
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:43,694
I just wanna know where I stand.

327
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,200
I think you're terrific.

328
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,789
But I'm married.

329
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,502
What can I say?

330
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,883
Just my luck.

331
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:34,370
Shit!

332
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:38,458
- What are you doing?
- I gotta go.

333
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,669
I thought she wasn't coming back
till tomorrow.

334
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:46,132
She's not, but I got things to do.
I gotta go home.

335
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:52,513
- I don't think I like this.
- Like what?

336
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:56,601
The way you run away
after every time we make love.

337
00:32:56,767 --> 00:33:01,063
What difference does it make
when I leave? I gotta go.

338
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,734
- You're not gonna leave now.
- Come on. Stop it.

339
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:07,528
Come on! Alex!

340
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:13,367
What's the problem?

341
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,497
I'm sorry.

342
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,876
Jesus Christ, let's be reasonable.

343
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:25,630
Be reasonable? What?

344
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,132
Goodbye.
Don't call me, I'll call you.

345
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:32,553
You knew about me.
I didn't hide anything.

346
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,597
- I thought it was understood.
- What?

347
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,517
The opportunity was there,
and we took it.

348
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:41,437
- We're adults, aren't we?
- What's that supposed to mean?

349
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,105
I thought we'd have a good time.

350
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,650
You thought you'd have a good time.

351
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,777
You didn't stop to think about me.

352
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:50,363
That's crazy. You knew the rules.

353
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:56,202
- What rules?
- Look, Alex. I like you.

354
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:59,664
If I wasn't with somebody else,
maybe I'd be with you. But I am.

355
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,085
Please don't justify yourself.
It's pathetic.

356
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,296
If you'd tell me to fuck off,
I'd have more respect for you.

357
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:11,968
All right then, fuck off.

358
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:16,055
And you, get out!

359
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:37,243
I'm going.

360
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:41,539
Why don't you come over here
and say goodbye nicely?

361
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:43,666
Let's be friends.

362
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:57,680
Baby, no.

363
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:00,850
It's OK.

364
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,310
It's OK.

365
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:06,856
- Sorry if I upset you.
- It's OK, really.

366
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:19,035
It's OK. All right. That's OK.

367
00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:22,663
Your hands are all wet.

368
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,207
Jesus!

369
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:30,129
Jesus Christ! Come here,
come here, come here.

370
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:33,299
Hold on. Hold on.

371
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,644
Nice and tight.

372
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:59,218
Hi. Did you just call me?

373
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,471
I was in the shower.
I heard the phone.

374
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,599
I thought it was you.

375
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:08,310
How are you? Did you have a good day?

376
00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:12,356
Yeah, yeah.

377
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:18,571
Really? That's terrific.
That's really terrific.

378
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:21,240
You sound excited.

379
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,244
Yeah.

380
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:28,706
No, I'm not against the idea.

381
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:32,835
Don't get me wrong.
It's just the money.

382
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:36,797
Yeah.

383
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:43,095
Yeah.

384
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,891
OK, darling. I love you.

385
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:50,227
Bye.

386
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:21,509
How are you feeling?

387
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:26,305
OK.

388
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,476
I gotta go.

389
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:35,147
Will you call me sometime?

390
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:37,149
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

391
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,652
No, I want to.

392
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:42,696
You promise me
you'll go see the doctor?

393
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:44,573
OK.

394
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:55,292
Goodbye.

395
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,419
Goodbye.

396
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:03,050
- You take care.
- You, too.

397
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,664
Shit.

398
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:36,584
Look what I got.
Look what I got for you here.

399
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:39,461
Spaghetti and meat sauce.

400
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:42,965
We'll make an Italian
out of you yet. Good boy.

401
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:45,342
Have a good one, yeah?

402
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,488
What are you doing here? It's 8 a.m.

403
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:10,117
I'm in the shitter. I'm due in court
by two and I'm behind.

404
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:14,663
Do me a favor, cancel everything.
Tell Drimmer we're fine.

405
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:18,000
- I'll be there by two.
- At two? OK.

406
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,377
Good morning, Martha.

407
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:29,595
- Daddy!
- Honey! I missed you.

408
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,389
We had a great time.
I went for a walk with Grandpa.

409
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,808
We saw rabbits...

410
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:37,102
Slow down.
I can't understand a word.

411
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,938
- I want a rabbit.
- I know you do.

412
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:42,316
- Hi, darling. How are you?
- Good.

413
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:43,734
Good.

414
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,408
God, I missed you.

415
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:55,412
- Liar.
- I did.

416
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:00,000
I should go away more often.

417
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:12,638
- I did this one.
- You did?

418
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:16,016
- Yes. Pick another one.
- I thought it was this one.

419
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:20,104
- No. It was this one.
- You're in a lot of trouble.

420
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,321
Phooey on Dewey.

421
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,250
- OK.
- Now, pick a card, Dad.

422
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:44,003
Any card at all?

423
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:45,921
Yes? Where'd she learn this?

424
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:48,048
Grandpa showed me.

425
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,136
Surprise.

426
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:59,935
So how was it?

427
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,980
Come on, I'm a big boy.
I can take it.

428
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:07,276
It had a place for rabbits.

429
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:11,989
No! She said it.
She said the R-word. No!

430
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:15,743
Not rabbits? Rabbits?

431
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:18,162
Rabbits!

432
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,538
- Rabbits!
- Not rabbits?

433
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,081
Rabbits!

434
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,584
What can I tell you?
It's absolutely perfect.

435
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:27,087
- In this row?
- No.

436
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:31,341
So, when are you gonna come up
and take a look at it?

437
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,719
Just for the hell of it?

438
00:42:34,887 --> 00:42:37,014
How about tomorrow morning?

439
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:40,601
- Daddy, which row?
- You mean it?

440
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:43,481
If you get me back to the office
by one, yeah.

441
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,731
Which row, Dad?

442
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:48,609
It's in this row, sweetheart.

443
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:14,134
Dan?

444
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:18,931
Honey? Honey, come here.
I want you to see this.

445
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,188
Well?

446
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:29,733
It's... It's OK.

447
00:43:30,901 --> 00:43:33,946
- It's fantastic!
- It's great.

448
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:37,699
Think of all the money we'll save
not living in New York.

449
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,744
The high school is excellent.
My own children went there.

450
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:44,039
- You see?
- It's a terrific area for kids.

451
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:45,999
I'm sure. Is it OK if I...?

452
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:47,918
Go ahead. I'll wait here.

453
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,878
Thank you.

454
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:54,299
We still got to decorate.

455
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,969
We can fix it up.
We can have painting parties.

456
00:43:57,094 --> 00:44:00,305
Painting parties?
You're making me very nervous.

457
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:09,982
Now, look at this.
This is fantastic.

458
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:13,819
This would make a terrific playroom.

459
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:17,865
What are you talking about, playroom?
This is my den!

460
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,534
I knew you were gonna like it.

461
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:23,996
I like it.

462
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:39,178
I'll be in court. How you doing?

463
00:44:39,303 --> 00:44:44,057
- Eunice, is Martha back from lunch?
- She just returned.

464
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:53,567
Hi.

465
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:55,694
Hello.

466
00:44:55,819 --> 00:44:58,864
This isn't a bad time, is it?
I was in the area.

467
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:03,202
No, no.
You want to come into my office?

468
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:15,422
This is his account?

469
00:45:16,298 --> 00:45:20,427
Danny, will you be
in your office later?

470
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:23,347
- Have we met somewhere?
- I don't think so.

471
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:26,266
She looked at me first.

472
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:30,896
Sit down.

473
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,454
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

474
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:50,749
I was going to call you today.

475
00:45:54,836 --> 00:46:00,008
I...
This is terribly embarrassing.

476
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:04,721
I just wanted to say sorry
for what happened.

477
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:07,349
I had no right
to put you through all that.

478
00:46:10,394 --> 00:46:12,312
Nothing happened, OK?

479
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,564
I was going through a bad time.

480
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:17,234
Everything was coming to a crisis.

481
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:21,196
But I'm fine. I'm really all right.
And thank you.

482
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:24,658
- You don't have to thank me.
- Yeah, I do.

483
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:28,203
A lot of guys
would have just run away.

484
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:31,498
I don't know what I would have done
if you hadn't been there.

485
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:38,463
Well, you look good.
As a matter of fact, you look great.

486
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:40,799
Thanks.

487
00:46:43,093 --> 00:46:45,429
So that's past?

488
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:47,222
Yeah.

489
00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:54,104
- May I ask you one more favor?
- What's that?

490
00:46:54,229 --> 00:47:00,736
I've got two tickets to Madame
Butterfly, two weeks from Thursday.

491
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:02,407
I'd love it if you'd come with me,

492
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,906
kind of as a peace offering.

493
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:12,664
Well, that's very nice of you.
But I don't think it's a good idea.

494
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:14,541
No strings attached.

495
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:19,755
You don't have to explain.
I just thought I'd ask.

496
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:23,800
So...

497
00:47:27,763 --> 00:47:30,807
I'll see you around sometime.

498
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:33,435
OK.

499
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,075
Come here.

500
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:56,875
- Take care.
- Yeah. Goodbye.

501
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,502
Goodbye.

502
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:28,990
All right. Come on, let's go, pal.

503
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:31,993
We're on a roll.

504
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,958
- Let's see that action.
- Down the middle.

505
00:48:40,669 --> 00:48:42,379
I like it. Very nice.

506
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,024
That is no good. I'm depressed.

507
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:34,097
What about Rodgers
versus whatchamacallit?

508
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:35,557
- Winitsky.
- Right.

509
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:38,268
I got your memo. You're going
for summary judgment?

510
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:41,062
Why not?
The facts are not in dispute.

511
00:49:41,188 --> 00:49:45,984
Rodgers admits reading Winitsky's
article, but did he plagiarize it?

512
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:49,362
You can't copyright an idea,
only the expression.

513
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:53,116
Rodgers didn't use
any of the words in the book.

514
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:55,118
- Let me think about it.
- OK.

515
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:57,746
You're about to become a suburbanite.

516
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,664
We're gonna take the plunge.

517
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:02,250
- Got a buyer for the apartment?
- No.

518
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,420
- Got cold sweats about your escrow?
- Yeah.

519
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:07,964
But not about
Rodgers versus Winitsky?

520
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:10,300
- No, sir.
- Good.

521
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:13,428
He's still in a meeting.

522
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:18,350
Yes, I know. I did expect him
to be through by now.

523
00:50:20,769 --> 00:50:23,230
Have lunch with me on Tuesday.

524
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:25,899
That'd be great. I'll check my diary.

525
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:29,236
You are on his list of calls.
It's Alex Forrest.

526
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:32,822
Again? I thought you told her
I'd call her back.

527
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:34,991
- I did.
- Put her on hold.

528
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:36,868
Would you mind holding?

529
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:38,578
Tuesday would be great.

530
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:41,623
- I look forward to it.
- Thank you. I will, too.

531
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,503
Put her through.

532
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:54,636
Hello?

533
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:58,807
Look, Alex, I thought we agreed
this was not a good idea.

534
00:51:01,351 --> 00:51:02,852
Why?

535
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:08,775
I thought you understood.

536
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,945
If I misled you in some way,
I apologise.

537
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:15,365
But it's not a good idea
if we talk to each other any more.

538
00:51:15,532 --> 00:51:17,200
OK?

539
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,036
Goodbye.

540
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:30,171
Yeah, if she calls again,
tell her I'm not here.

541
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,636
Wait, let me just...

542
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,846
Let me just look at you.

543
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:24,768
You're so beautiful.

544
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:27,187
Just so beautiful.

545
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:42,535
- Wouldn't you know?
- I know.

546
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,169
Go on, open it.

547
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:53,630
I wouldn't do it to my wife.

548
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:55,006
It's OK.

549
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:59,135
- Know how many injuries happen?
- Don't terrorise them!

550
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:03,765
I'm a lawyer, I'm insured.
It's excited.

551
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,767
Don't forget who gave you this.

552
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:08,687
My cold sores are almost gone.

553
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:11,064
Ladies first.
I use that term advisedly.

554
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:14,401
You're the best, sweetie.

555
00:53:14,526 --> 00:53:19,030
That's my wife!
A little attention, please, ladies.

556
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:24,369
Gentlemen, my wife, ball and chain.

557
00:53:24,536 --> 00:53:26,162
Mother of some of my children.

558
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,664
Don't be too confident.

559
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:33,169
Here is to Miller, Goodman,
Hurst and Gallagher!

560
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:36,339
- And to Mrs Gallagher.
- Give me a break.

561
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:38,258
He just asked me to lunch.

562
00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:41,052
You're moving to your estate.
You'll forget us plebs.

563
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:43,930
Wait a minute.
I read a self-help book.

564
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:50,729
- Published by Robbins & Hart.
- Of course. Samurai Self-Help.

565
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:57,736
In it, it tells you how deal with
the anxieties of your friends

566
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:02,323
as you move up the corporate ladder
and they stay put.

567
00:54:02,449 --> 00:54:06,828
In this book, it says not to coddle
your friends' anxieties.

568
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:09,998
I'm not gonna make
any false reassurances.

569
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:13,001
I won't say you can go to the house
every weekend.

570
00:54:13,168 --> 00:54:17,464
Things have changed.
This is not a classless society.

571
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,299
In fact, this is it. Goodbye.

572
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:22,552
- Goodbye.
- I knew he was gonna say that!

573
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:26,598
- He's running true to form.
- We gotta make a clean break.

574
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:30,894
- We gotta travel light.
- Thanks for the time you gave us.

575
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:42,113
Drink. I want you with a lampshade
on your head by ten.

576
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:45,283
Why should today be any different?

577
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:51,039
Hello? Hello?

578
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:53,708
Here's to you.

579
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:56,795
Cheers.

580
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:01,049
Hello?

581
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,761
Hello!

582
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:44,968
Yeah?

583
00:55:49,097 --> 00:55:52,642
Yeah, Richards.
It's kinda late, isn't it?

584
00:55:55,812 --> 00:55:59,607
If you won't take my calls
at the office, I have no choice.

585
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:04,529
It's two o'clock in the morning.
Can't this wait till tomorrow?

586
00:56:04,696 --> 00:56:06,447
Is it awkward for you to talk?

587
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:10,869
You could say that.

588
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,538
I've got to see you.

589
00:56:14,122 --> 00:56:18,501
I don't have the... documentation
to answer that question now.

590
00:56:18,668 --> 00:56:20,336
But I'll call you from the office.

591
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:26,259
No. Meet me in front of the Robbins
& Hart building tomorrow at six.

592
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:30,430
Don't disappoint me. Be there.

593
00:56:31,431 --> 00:56:33,099
OK.

594
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:38,730
This has got to stop.

595
00:56:38,855 --> 00:56:40,815
You should have agreed to see me.

596
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,443
It's over.
There is nothing between us.

597
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:47,030
You've had your fun,
now you just want a quiet life?

598
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:49,532
Why are you doing this?
You need help.

599
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:52,869
- Don't tell me what I need.
- You need a shrink.

600
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:54,996
I'm not your enemy.

601
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:58,791
- Why are you trying to hurt me?
- I'm not. I love you.

602
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:01,753
- You what?
- I love you.

603
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:05,465
- You don't know me.
- How can you say that?

604
00:57:05,632 --> 00:57:07,383
We spent a weekend together.

605
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:09,636
You spent a second night.
You must like me.

606
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:14,933
I was concerned about you.
You read too much into everything.

607
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,310
I have a whole relationship
with someone else.

608
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:20,897
- I am very happy.
- Whole means complete.

609
00:57:21,064 --> 00:57:23,232
If your life's complete,
why were you with me?

610
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,693
You want to talk about
our imaginary affair?

611
00:57:25,818 --> 00:57:27,362
I'm pregnant.

612
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:34,661
I saw my gynecologist on Monday.

613
00:57:34,786 --> 00:57:36,746
Here's his card. You can call him.

614
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,296
You don't...?

615
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:52,136
Use anything? No.
I had a bad miscarriage last year.

616
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:54,263
I didn't think I could get pregnant.

617
00:57:56,516 --> 00:57:57,934
How do you know it's mine?

618
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:04,065
Because I don't sleep around.

619
00:58:15,076 --> 00:58:17,078
I apologise.

620
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,082
I'm sorry.

621
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:23,835
Don't worry.
You won't have to handle this alone.

622
00:58:24,002 --> 00:58:26,087
Handle what?

623
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:29,549
The abortion. I'll take care of it.
I'll pay for it.

624
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:32,593
What makes you think
I want an abortion?

625
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:41,185
- You're not gonna have the baby?
- Why not?

626
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,604
There are plenty of
one-parent families.

627
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:47,358
- They don't end in divorce.
- I don't have a say in this?

628
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:52,488
I want this child.
It has nothing to do with you.

629
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:54,448
I want it whether you're
part of it or not.

630
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:58,327
Then why are you telling me?
Why not just go ahead and do it?

631
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:03,958
I was hoping that you
would want to be part of it.

632
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:08,463
This... This is totally insane.

633
00:59:09,047 --> 00:59:13,801
I'm 36. It may be
my last chance to have a child.

634
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:19,223
Just think what you're saying.

635
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:21,768
Just think about it.

636
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:26,439
We are gonna live with this
for the rest of our lives.

637
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:31,611
I know that. I've thought of that.
I know how you feel.

638
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:35,865
It's a big thing.
But it doesn't have to be a problem.

639
00:59:36,032 --> 00:59:38,034
Really, it doesn't.

640
00:59:38,201 --> 00:59:42,163
You play fair with me,
I'll play fair with you.

641
00:59:47,919 --> 00:59:51,255
"He led Agnes and Nellie
into the closet."

642
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,634
"Agnes, Nellie and Oink
giggled in the dark."

643
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:58,596
"Pearl listened outside the door.
'It works, ' cried Nellie."

644
00:59:58,721 --> 01:00:04,102
"'Of course, ' said Oink. 'Look at
the flying dog!' yelled Agnes."

645
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:07,563
"Pearl frowned. 'Who cares about
flying dogs?' she said."

646
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,524
"Nobody heard her."

647
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:11,692
"'Look out for the worms!'
squealed Agnes."

648
01:00:11,818 --> 01:00:14,654
"'Eek!' yelled Nellie and Agnes."

649
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:20,660
"'Look at the monster cockroach!'
yelled Oink. 'Help!'"

650
01:03:02,113 --> 01:03:05,449
You know what I did?
I called the doctor.

651
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:07,952
Know what he says? "Congratulations!"

652
01:03:08,077 --> 01:03:11,163
I can't even imagine
what she told him.

653
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:14,875
Anyway, that's not the end of it.

654
01:03:15,001 --> 01:03:17,670
So, after I talked to the doctor,

655
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:20,840
this morning,
I broke into her apartment.

656
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:24,135
I know. Me, a lawyer,
breaking and entering.

657
01:03:24,302 --> 01:03:28,014
I wanted to get a handle
on what I'm dealing with.

658
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:31,267
I wanted to find out if she was
sleeping with somebody else.

659
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:33,936
I didn't find anything.

660
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:42,611
Anyway, I didn't find anything.

661
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:45,865
I don't know anything
about family law.

662
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:49,035
You've got to help me.
What case does she really have?

663
01:03:52,455 --> 01:03:55,750
Well, it ain't good.

664
01:03:57,168 --> 01:04:00,671
She keeps calling the apartment.

665
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:04,133
Every time Beth answers the phone,
she hangs up.

666
01:04:06,135 --> 01:04:11,891
I'm scared, Jimmy. I...
I don't want to lose my family.

667
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:22,568
The facts as alleged are horrendous.

668
01:04:22,735 --> 01:04:26,697
The instrument allegedly used
was an electronic-shock device...

669
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:51,639
- Operator, may I help you?
- I'm trying to get 555-8129-212.

670
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:53,849
The recording says it's disconnected.

671
01:04:53,974 --> 01:04:56,477
Just a moment, please.

672
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:58,521
It's been changed to unlisted.

673
01:04:58,646 --> 01:05:01,524
It's a real emergency.
I need that number.

674
01:05:01,649 --> 01:05:03,692
We can't give out that information.

675
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:07,071
- Well, fuck you!
- My place or yours?

676
01:05:43,983 --> 01:05:48,028
- I like it. I like it a lot.
- We've been very happy here.

677
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:51,240
I'd definitely like
to think about it if I could.

678
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,785
- It's very clean.
- Yes.

679
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:58,456
We have a cleaning lady who comes
in a few times a week.

680
01:05:58,581 --> 01:06:01,834
- I can give you her name as well.
- I'd love that.

681
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:05,546
There's babysitters galore.
The whole works.

682
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,223
Hi, darling. This is Alex.
I've forgotten your last name.

683
01:06:16,348 --> 01:06:20,352
- Alex Forrest.
- This is my husband Dan.

684
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:24,231
Hi. Glad to meet you.

685
01:06:26,108 --> 01:06:28,861
Nice to meet you.

686
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:32,865
- Haven't we met somewhere?
- I don't think so.

687
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:42,333
No, we have. Weren't you
at that party at the Japanese place?

688
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:44,835
Honey, the exercise book.

689
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,504
Yeah.

690
01:06:46,629 --> 01:06:50,257
You're a lawyer.
And you work for the firm...

691
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:53,344
What's the name? Anyway...

692
01:06:53,469 --> 01:06:55,846
We've definitely met.

693
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:59,934
- You have a good memory.
- I never forget a face.

694
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:04,271
- It's a small world.
- It certainly is.

695
01:07:06,732 --> 01:07:09,860
I gather you're going to the country?

696
01:07:09,985 --> 01:07:12,863
- Moving to the country?
- Yes.

697
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,323
Have you found a place?

698
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:17,034
We found a place in Bedford.
Do you know it?

699
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:19,203
- It's beautiful.
- Yes.

700
01:07:19,328 --> 01:07:21,997
You'll move of here
almost immediately?

701
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:25,501
Actually, we wanted to do
some remodeling first.

702
01:07:25,668 --> 01:07:28,170
I guess looking for a place
right now?

703
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:30,422
Yeah. I'd like to settle in.

704
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,841
Alex is expecting a baby.

705
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:38,055
That's...

706
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:41,183
Will you excuse me?
I have some work to do.

707
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:44,979
I better run, too.

708
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:48,315
Thank you for the tea
and showing me the apartment.

709
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,236
- You're very welcome.
- I like it. I really like it.

710
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:55,990
- We've been happy here.
- I'd like to think about it.

711
01:07:56,115 --> 01:07:58,867
I'll give you our number
so you can call us direct.

712
01:07:58,993 --> 01:08:00,661
Thank you.

713
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:20,764
- I'll keep in touch.
- Great.

714
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:22,933
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

715
01:08:27,688 --> 01:08:30,524
She seemed really interested.

716
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:35,529
She didn't mention a husband.
I get the feeling she's on her own.

717
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:39,366
- What is it? You seem down.
- No, no. I'm just tired.

718
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:00,596
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

719
01:09:00,763 --> 01:09:02,973
Who?

720
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:06,769
You know damn well!
Come on, let me in. I want to talk.

721
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:09,730
So now you want to talk?

722
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:28,332
What can I get you?

723
01:09:28,499 --> 01:09:31,126
I've got Scotch, vodka,
a nice Chablis...

724
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:35,130
Cut the shit, will you? Just cut it!

725
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:42,930
I don't know what you're up to,
but it's gonna stop right now.

726
01:09:43,055 --> 01:09:46,725
No. It's going to go on,
until you face your responsibilities.

727
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,560
What responsibilities?

728
01:09:48,686 --> 01:09:51,146
I'm pregnant.
I'm gonna have our child.

729
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:55,275
That's your choice, honey.
It has nothing to do with me.

730
01:09:55,401 --> 01:09:57,027
I want to be a part of your life.

731
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:59,738
So you do it by showing up
at my apartment?

732
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:03,409
You won't answer my calls.
You changed your number.

733
01:10:03,534 --> 01:10:06,453
I'm not gonna be ignored.

734
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,917
You don't get it.
You just don't get it.

735
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:19,299
Don't you remember our weekend?
Wasn't that wonderful?

736
01:10:19,425 --> 01:10:23,011
Why can't we just be like that again?

737
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:26,765
I know you feel it, too.
What are you so afraid of?

738
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,685
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

739
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:32,604
Hit me. If you can't fuck me,
why don't you hit me?

740
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:35,899
You're so sad. You know that?
Lonely and very sad.

741
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:38,694
Don't you ever pity me,
you smug bastard.

742
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:41,363
I'll pity you because you're sick.

743
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:44,867
Why? Because I won't allow you
to treat me like a slut

744
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:48,245
you can bang a few times
and throw in the garbage?

745
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:54,793
I'm gonna be the mother
of your child.

746
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,920
I want a little respect.

747
01:11:00,466 --> 01:11:02,593
You want respect?

748
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:07,389
- Respect!
- What are you doing?

749
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:10,392
Please don't go.
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

750
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,936
I'll tell your wife.

751
01:11:14,897 --> 01:11:18,275
You tell my wife, I'll kill you.

752
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:22,738
It only takes a phone call!

753
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:32,247
Hello? Hello?

754
01:11:40,214 --> 01:11:41,465
Got it.

755
01:11:41,632 --> 01:11:47,054
Guys, that's on the second door
to the left, over here.

756
01:11:47,179 --> 01:11:49,223
You could've stayed
in the apartment.

757
01:11:49,348 --> 01:11:54,520
Dan was in such a hurry to get out
of New York. Momma, that's you.

758
01:11:54,645 --> 01:11:56,647
Lord, put it away.

759
01:11:56,772 --> 01:12:01,902
All right, easy on the door-frame.
Good. Nice. Just like that.

760
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:20,254
I got it. Sorry. I got it.

761
01:12:26,969 --> 01:12:28,428
Hello?

762
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:30,889
Martha.

763
01:12:35,102 --> 01:12:38,272
Martha. It's Martha.

764
01:12:56,164 --> 01:12:57,457
Hello?

765
01:12:57,583 --> 01:13:00,294
Hi, honey. Did the plumber come yet?

766
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:04,131
Did he ever.

767
01:13:04,298 --> 01:13:06,758
I don't really want to know about it.

768
01:13:06,884 --> 01:13:09,219
Hey, guess what I'm looking at.

769
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:12,431
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it right here.

770
01:13:12,556 --> 01:13:14,933
Or I should say, I got her.

771
01:13:15,684 --> 01:13:16,935
What's she like?

772
01:13:17,102 --> 01:13:19,897
She's cute. She looks like a rabbit.

773
01:13:20,022 --> 01:13:22,691
She's white, she's got long ears,
little pink eyes.

774
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:26,236
- Soft.
- She sounds cute.

775
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:28,697
Ellen doesn't know about it?

776
01:13:28,822 --> 01:13:32,242
No. She doesn't think
she's gonna get one.

777
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:34,494
See what happens
if you work here too long?

778
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:37,039
- Isn't it cute?
- Thank you.

779
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:40,083
I forgot. This arrived for you.

780
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:41,627
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

781
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:58,101
Hey, Joaquin!

782
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:48,587
Jesus fucking Christ!

783
01:15:48,712 --> 01:15:52,507
Fucking bitch! Jesus Christ!

784
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:00,390
No. I said it was
the electrical system.

785
01:16:00,515 --> 01:16:03,560
The whole goddamn thing blew up.

786
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:06,188
All right, honey.
I'll see you in a little while.

787
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:26,166
Mr Gallagher?

788
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:29,127
- You forgot your contract.
- Thanks.

789
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:39,030
Hello, Dan. Are you surprised?

790
01:17:39,156 --> 01:17:41,867
This is what you've reduced me to.

791
01:17:41,992 --> 01:17:47,873
I guess you thought you'd get away
with it. Well, you can't.

792
01:17:47,998 --> 01:17:53,003
Because part of you is growing
inside of me, and that's a fact.

793
01:17:53,128 --> 01:17:56,715
You'd better start
learning how to deal with it.

794
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:03,847
Because, you know, I feel you.

795
01:18:03,972 --> 01:18:06,516
I taste you.

796
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:08,560
I think you.

797
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:10,562
I touch you.

798
01:18:12,063 --> 01:18:15,567
Can you understand? Can you?

799
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:23,700
I'm just asking you to acknowledge
your responsibilities.

800
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:27,204
I mean, is that so bad?

801
01:18:27,329 --> 01:18:32,083
I don't think so.
I don't think it's unreasonable.

802
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:34,502
And you know, another thing is,

803
01:18:34,628 --> 01:18:40,008
that you thought that you could
just walk into my life

804
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:45,597
and turn it upside down, without
a thought for anyone but yourself.

805
01:19:09,037 --> 01:19:11,039
You know what you are?

806
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:14,167
You're a cock-sucking son of a bitch.

807
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:19,381
I hate you. I bet
you don't even like girls, do you?

808
01:19:19,506 --> 01:19:22,175
You flaming fucking faggot!

809
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:17,564
Daddy! Thank you.

810
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:21,151
You're welcome, honey. You like her?

811
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:25,280
You like it?

812
01:21:20,168 --> 01:21:25,256
You thought you could just walk
into my life and turn it upside down

813
01:21:25,382 --> 01:21:28,635
without a thought
for anyone but yourself.

814
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,720
You know what you are?

815
01:21:30,845 --> 01:21:36,017
You're a cock-sucking son of a bitch.

816
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:41,648
You are. I bet
you don't even like girls, do you?

817
01:21:41,773 --> 01:21:47,112
They probably scare you.
I know I do.

818
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:49,572
You're scared of me, aren't you?

819
01:21:49,697 --> 01:21:54,035
You're fucking frightened of me.
You're afraid.

820
01:21:54,202 --> 01:21:57,497
You gutless, heartless, spineless
fucking son of a bitch.

821
01:21:57,664 --> 01:22:01,000
I hate you.
You deserve everything you get.

822
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,629
- Jesus Christ!
- Sorry.

823
01:22:05,797 --> 01:22:09,426
I was wondering why you were
up so late. I'm sorry.

824
01:22:09,551 --> 01:22:12,762
It's OK. I was listening
to a deposition.

825
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:14,347
I couldn't sleep.

826
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:17,142
Come on.
I'm gonna give you a back rub.

827
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:20,395
- Back rub?
- Brandy, a back rub.

828
01:22:20,562 --> 01:22:24,816
- You won't know what hit you.
- Sounds good.

829
01:22:28,695 --> 01:22:32,740
My client wants it stopped.

830
01:22:32,866 --> 01:22:35,034
He wants an end to the harassment.

831
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,996
He's positive it was this woman
who trashed the car?

832
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:39,914
Yes, of course.

833
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:43,293
- Any witnesses?
- No.

834
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:47,422
He can file a complaint
if it'd make him feel better.

835
01:22:47,547 --> 01:22:50,425
There's not a lot we can do
without proof.

836
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:55,346
This woman is completely irrational.
There's no telling what she could do.

837
01:22:55,472 --> 01:22:58,183
We can't arrest people
for what they might do.

838
01:22:58,308 --> 01:23:03,062
I'm not asking you to arrest her.
I... He simply...

839
01:23:06,608 --> 01:23:09,652
He wants her warned.

840
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:15,074
We could talk to her.
It may make things public.

841
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,493
He's not gonna like that.

842
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:19,162
It may even aggravate the situation.

843
01:23:19,287 --> 01:23:21,039
How's that?

844
01:23:21,164 --> 01:23:23,166
Whatever resentment she's feeling,

845
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:25,460
she's probably got it
out of her system.

846
01:23:25,627 --> 01:23:28,546
Any action we take could provoke her.

847
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:34,093
What if she
didn't get it out of her system?

848
01:23:34,219 --> 01:23:37,722
Catch her in the act.
Then we can bring charges.

849
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:40,350
He just has to sit there and take it?

850
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:44,145
It's his bed. I'm afraid
he's gonna have to lie in it.

851
01:24:00,245 --> 01:24:04,582
Come on, come on.

852
01:24:09,671 --> 01:24:12,799
Come on, Ellen,
we're going to Grandma's.

853
01:24:16,928 --> 01:24:20,723
Come on, Quincy. Come on, hurry up.

854
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:23,268
Come on, get on in. Hurry up.

855
01:24:23,393 --> 01:24:26,437
Watch his tail, sweetie.
Make him sit down.

856
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,664
- You didn't get your car back?
- No, it's a write-off.

857
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:49,335
- The electrical system's shot.
- Extraordinary, those foreign cars.

858
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:51,462
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

859
01:24:51,629 --> 01:24:54,632
- Want to try again, sweetie?
- OK.

860
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:56,384
OK.

861
01:24:56,509 --> 01:24:58,136
So?

862
01:24:58,261 --> 01:25:04,183
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

863
01:25:04,309 --> 01:25:05,810
Very good.

864
01:25:05,935 --> 01:25:09,772
Do it one more time.
Do it with your hat and do the bow,

865
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:12,609
so that when you do it,
you know what you're doing.

866
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:14,944
Let me see your bow.

867
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:19,365
And what do you say?

868
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:24,287
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

869
01:25:24,412 --> 01:25:27,332
- Very good. You got that.
- Ellen.

870
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:29,000
Come here.

871
01:25:32,587 --> 01:25:34,297
- That was good.
- Thank you.

872
01:25:34,464 --> 01:25:39,385
That was really good.
That was so good.

873
01:25:42,013 --> 01:25:44,265
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

874
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:46,434
Thank you, darling.

875
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,335
Come on, Quincy.

876
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:37,462
- Daddy!
- What?

877
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,303
Whitey's gone!

878
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:46,596
Whitey's gone!

879
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:11,287
It's all right, darling.
It's going to be OK, sweetie.

880
01:28:11,412 --> 01:28:14,749
You should try and get some sleep.

881
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:41,984
- Is she OK?
- She's asleep.

882
01:28:45,029 --> 01:28:46,364
Did you call the police?

883
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:49,200
- Not yet, no.
- Why not?

884
01:28:52,829 --> 01:28:54,705
Honey, we gotta talk.

885
01:29:02,922 --> 01:29:05,091
What is it?

886
01:29:06,342 --> 01:29:08,427
I know who did this.

887
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,724
You do? Who?

888
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:18,563
Remember the girl
who came to the apartment?

889
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:21,607
The one I met
in the Japanese restaurant?

890
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:26,237
The one with the blonde hair.

891
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:35,371
You're scaring me.

892
01:29:41,002 --> 01:29:43,754
What is it?

893
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,132
Did you have an affair with her?

894
01:29:46,257 --> 01:29:47,884
Yes.

895
01:30:01,939 --> 01:30:03,691
Beth?

896
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,742
Beth, I am so sorry.

897
01:30:12,867 --> 01:30:18,289
The last thing I ever wanted to do
was to hurt you.

898
01:30:24,545 --> 01:30:28,799
Are you in love with her?

899
01:30:28,925 --> 01:30:33,095
No. It was one night.
It didn't mean anything.

900
01:30:44,315 --> 01:30:49,111
What has it got to do
with what's happened?

901
01:30:53,366 --> 01:30:54,742
She's pregnant.

902
01:30:56,869 --> 01:30:59,413
She's...

903
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:00,998
It's yours?

904
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:05,127
I don't know. That's what she says.
Listen, Beth, please.

905
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:10,383
Get off!
I want you out of this house!

906
01:31:10,508 --> 01:31:12,176
How could you do that? I hate you!

907
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:17,098
- Understand what I'm saying...
- I don't want to hear it!

908
01:31:17,223 --> 01:31:20,351
Please, just listen to me, will you?

909
01:31:20,476 --> 01:31:23,062
What is the matter with you?

910
01:32:33,132 --> 01:32:35,760
Dan, what a pleasant surprise.

911
01:32:37,136 --> 01:32:41,182
It's over. It's finished.
I told Beth. She knows all about it.

912
01:32:42,266 --> 01:32:46,604
Sure. You haven't got the balls.

913
01:32:46,729 --> 01:32:49,857
Why don't you speak to her?

914
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:53,235
Why would I want to talk to her?

915
01:33:05,331 --> 01:33:07,458
This is Beth Gallagher.

916
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:12,129
If you come near my family again,
I'll kill you, you understand?

917
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:42,034
That's the last one, Ellen.
I mean it.

918
01:33:58,592 --> 01:34:02,304
Hello? Hi, Daddy.

919
01:34:05,182 --> 01:34:07,560
When are you coming home?

920
01:34:10,855 --> 01:34:14,859
Honey, I don't know.
How are you doing?

921
01:34:16,235 --> 01:34:17,987
Good.

922
01:34:24,952 --> 01:34:27,580
Grandpa taught me a new card trick.

923
01:34:27,705 --> 01:34:30,499
Did he? The one with the jacks.

924
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:33,252
No, the one with the kings.

925
01:34:34,712 --> 01:34:36,797
Good.

926
01:34:39,842 --> 01:34:41,635
I won't.

927
01:34:43,762 --> 01:34:46,015
Good.

928
01:34:49,351 --> 01:34:51,979
How's Mommy?

929
01:34:52,104 --> 01:34:53,981
Send her my love.

930
01:34:54,106 --> 01:34:56,942
OK. Goodbye.

931
01:34:57,067 --> 01:34:59,862
Daddy?

932
01:35:00,029 --> 01:35:01,947
Call me tomorrow.

933
01:35:02,072 --> 01:35:06,785
I will. I promise.
You be sure you tell Mommy I called.

934
01:35:07,161 --> 01:35:09,330
I will.

935
01:35:09,496 --> 01:35:12,791
Love you a lot, too. Bye-bye.

936
01:35:17,004 --> 01:35:18,756
Bye-bye.

937
01:36:00,589 --> 01:36:03,467
Mrs Gallagher,
did you forget something?

938
01:36:03,592 --> 01:36:09,056
- I came to get Ellen.
- I thought you'd picked her up.

939
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:10,766
I'm sure she's left already.

940
01:36:11,475 --> 01:36:14,186
Betty? Is Ellen in here with you?

941
01:36:14,311 --> 01:36:16,146
- She's gone home.
- Sure?

942
01:36:16,272 --> 01:36:19,024
Positive. She's not inside
or in the playground.

943
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:22,486
- I thought you picked her up.
- Who did pick her up?

944
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:24,488
She can't have gone far.

945
01:36:25,364 --> 01:36:27,825
- You don't understand.
- I'll check her locker.

946
01:36:33,247 --> 01:36:36,542
- Alicia, where's Ellen?
- She's gone.

947
01:36:39,003 --> 01:36:40,713
Call the police.

948
01:36:45,759 --> 01:36:47,761
Ellen.

949
01:36:48,304 --> 01:36:51,307
Please let her be all right!

950
01:36:54,268 --> 01:36:56,895
Christ.

951
01:36:59,273 --> 01:37:00,566
Where are you?

952
01:38:04,463 --> 01:38:05,964
Look out!

953
01:38:23,690 --> 01:38:26,193
Where are you?

954
01:38:52,261 --> 01:38:54,513
- Bye-bye, Ellen.
- Bye.

955
01:38:55,097 --> 01:38:58,809
Ellen, can I have a kiss?

956
01:39:02,396 --> 01:39:04,064
Bye.

957
01:39:14,116 --> 01:39:17,995
I'm looking for a patient
named Gallagher. I'm her husband.

958
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,622
Room 22 at the end of the corridor.

959
01:39:20,747 --> 01:39:23,584
- Is she gonna be OK?
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

960
01:39:23,709 --> 01:39:27,045
She was very lucky.
It might have been a lot worse.

961
01:39:27,171 --> 01:39:30,549
- Daddy!
- Hi, babes. God, I missed you.

962
01:39:30,674 --> 01:39:32,468
I missed you, honey.

963
01:39:32,593 --> 01:39:35,471
Are you OK?
Have you seen Mommy yet?

964
01:39:35,596 --> 01:39:37,639
Yeah.

965
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:41,351
Now, you stay here with Granny.
I'll go and see Mommy.

966
01:39:52,196 --> 01:39:54,072
Howard.

967
01:40:09,129 --> 01:40:11,340
You're gonna be OK.

968
01:41:07,187 --> 01:41:11,608
- Want to go to Ziggy's first?
- Hot places.

969
01:45:05,175 --> 01:45:08,845
I tried to explain the situation,
but you wouldn't listen.

970
01:45:08,970 --> 01:45:13,099
The woman took my kid.
That's kidnapping. Am I right?

971
01:45:13,225 --> 01:45:16,394
My wife could've been killed.
If you won't do anything...

972
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:19,523
Take it easy.
You don't have to shout.

973
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:23,360
OK.

974
01:45:23,527 --> 01:45:24,986
What are you gonna do?

975
01:45:26,112 --> 01:45:30,033
We'll tell New York to pick her up
and bring her in for questioning.

976
01:45:32,327 --> 01:45:34,412
OK.

977
01:45:34,538 --> 01:45:40,293
OK. I'm gonna go
to the hospital tomorrow

978
01:45:40,418 --> 01:45:43,296
to pick my wife up.

979
01:45:43,463 --> 01:45:47,759
Hopefully, I'll be home
for the weekend

980
01:45:47,884 --> 01:45:49,761
if you need to talk to me.

981
01:45:57,018 --> 01:45:59,062
Thank you, Lieutenant.

982
01:46:02,107 --> 01:46:03,400
You're welcome.

983
01:46:23,003 --> 01:46:27,048
How's that feel? You warm? Good.

984
01:46:28,758 --> 01:46:30,468
Are you all cosy?

985
01:46:30,594 --> 01:46:32,637
Is Mommy gonna be all right?

986
01:46:33,513 --> 01:46:38,143
Mommy's gonna be fine, honey.
She's gonna be fine.

987
01:46:38,268 --> 01:46:40,896
Are you going to stay with us?

988
01:46:43,899 --> 01:46:46,151
I'm gonna stay with you.

989
01:46:49,571 --> 01:46:51,615
Now, go to sleep, OK?

990
01:46:54,993 --> 01:46:56,870
Goodnight, doll.

991
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,624
Forever?

992
01:47:03,043 --> 01:47:04,461
I promise, honey.

993
01:47:24,981 --> 01:47:29,486
You mean the detectives in Manhattan
have no idea where she's gone?

994
01:47:29,611 --> 01:47:32,364
They don't know where she is?

995
01:47:36,242 --> 01:47:37,827
Yeah.

996
01:47:44,793 --> 01:47:47,003
No, I see.

997
01:47:47,128 --> 01:47:49,992
If you get any more information,
you'll let me know, Lieutenant?

998
01:47:50,006 --> 01:47:52,342
Thank you very much.

999
01:48:09,067 --> 01:48:11,528
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1000
01:48:12,737 --> 01:48:14,197
How does the arm feel?

1001
01:48:14,364 --> 01:48:16,616
It hurts.

1002
01:48:16,741 --> 01:48:18,868
Can I get you some more painkillers?

1003
01:48:21,162 --> 01:48:22,956
OK.

1004
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:29,170
Welcome back.
Our contestants have to decide...

1005
01:48:43,727 --> 01:48:45,061
Thank you.

1006
01:48:45,186 --> 01:48:47,230
Holler if you need anything else.

1007
01:48:47,397 --> 01:48:49,733
I'd love a cup of tea.

1008
01:48:50,567 --> 01:48:52,444
You got it.

1009
01:50:32,585 --> 01:50:34,963
What are you doing here?

1010
01:50:40,051 --> 01:50:42,470
Why are you here?

1011
01:50:47,142 --> 01:50:52,605
He tried... to say goodbye to me
last night.

1012
01:50:52,730 --> 01:50:54,941
But he couldn't,

1013
01:50:55,066 --> 01:51:00,989
because he and I feel the same way
about each other.

1014
01:51:01,865 --> 01:51:06,411
Do you know how it is when you meet
somebody for the first time...

1015
01:51:08,913 --> 01:51:11,875
...and you get
this instant attraction?

1016
01:51:21,134 --> 01:51:23,261
I understand what you're doing.

1017
01:51:23,386 --> 01:51:26,472
You're trying to move him
into the country.

1018
01:51:26,598 --> 01:51:29,559
And you're keeping him away from me.

1019
01:51:30,768 --> 01:51:34,230
And you're playing happy family.

1020
01:51:34,355 --> 01:51:41,988
But you... wouldn't understand that,
because you're so selfish.

1021
01:51:44,365 --> 01:51:47,994
He told me about you.
He told me about you.

1022
01:51:48,161 --> 01:51:50,330
He was very honest.

1023
01:52:03,218 --> 01:52:05,094
If you weren't so stupid,
you'd know that.

1024
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:11,142
But you're a stupid, selfish bitch!
You're a stupid, selfish bitch!

1025
01:52:28,284 --> 01:52:30,161
Dan!

1026
01:52:34,499 --> 01:52:36,584
Dan!
