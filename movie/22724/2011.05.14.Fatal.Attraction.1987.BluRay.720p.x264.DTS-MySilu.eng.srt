1
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,382
Well, there is one thing...

2
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,418
I'd like to ask you.

3
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,254
How do they make that slime
they're always dumping on you?

4
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,523
Oh, well. First,
they take some liquid.

5
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,861
And then they add some
jell-O powder and some flour...

6
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,526
and sometimes some soap,
then they dump it all over me.

7
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,205
You better get going, kiddo.
We're gonna be late.

8
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,069
Actually, Vanessa, I wondered
that too. I just don't know.

9
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,075
Very interesting.
Is it always green?

10
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:32,346
Yeah, it usually is,
but I guess it could be red.

11
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,720
Or it could be blue.

12
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,268
Daddy, telephone.

13
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,934
Thanks, darling.

14
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,513
Hello.

15
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,216
Hildy, I'm fine.
I just stubbed my toe.

16
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,158
Hang on one second, will you?

17
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,753
Honey, it's Hildy.

18
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,695
I'll call her back.

19
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:23,168
She's in the bathroom. She wants
to know what you're wearing.

20
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,833
My black suit.

21
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,739
She's gonna wear her black dress.

22
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,869
Well, it's gonna be business.
You know how those things are.

23
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:36,715
Ellen, I don't want you
messing with my makeup. I'm late.

24
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,615
- Is her red dress okay?
- It's perfect.

25
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,916
Did you hear that?
You got it.

26
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,219
Okay, darling.
See you later. Bye.

27
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,883
Oh, man.

28
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,692
I told you a million times not
to play with my lipstick, right?

29
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,358
So when are you gonna
listen to me, huh?

30
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,094
Silly girl.

31
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,530
Honey, where's my blue suit?

32
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,370
It's on the back of the door.

33
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,108
Oh, shit.

34
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,116
Shit, shit, shit.

35
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,510
Shit, shit, shit.

36
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,825
- Hi, Ellen.
- Hi, Christine.

37
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,331
- How you doin'?
- Good.

38
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,733
- Where's your mom?
- She's in the bathroom.

39
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,397
I got you a present.
Wanna see what it is?

40
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,675
- Do you like it?
- Uh-huh.

41
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,837
Okay, come on.
Let's go find Mommy.

42
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,325
Hiya, Chuck. How are you? Good to
see you. Can you make it Friday?

43
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,196
- I'm there.
- We need you. We're in the cellar.

44
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,236
Dan, is my hair okay?

45
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,294
- You look great.
- I'm serious.

46
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,636
You're the prettiest woman
in the room, sweetheart.

47
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,697
Liar.

48
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,242
Hiya, Bob. How are you?

49
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,080
Glad you could make it, Dan.
Sorry about the meeting tomorrow.

50
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,552
I know it's a Saturday,
but we got a real crisis.

51
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,954
I understand. Do you know
my wife Beth? Bob Drimmer.

52
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,821
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

53
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,156
- Hope you like sushi.
- Love it, Bob.

54
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:31,220
- What did he do to his neck?
- He was screwin' his wife.

55
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:34,165
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely. You should see his wife.

56
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,600
They had to take her out
on a stretcher.

57
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,401
- You guys are bad!
- Do you want champagne?

58
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,442
- Champagne for everyone.
- With a twist.

59
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,340
Four champagnes over here.

60
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,345
Excuse me. Hi.

61
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,583
Thank you.

62
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,346
Thank you very much.

63
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,151
- Jesus!
- Thank you.

64
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,622
Fuck!

65
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,023
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

66
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,721
So, what great cultural event
are we here to celebrate tonight?

67
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,288
- Some exercise manual.
- Not another one.

68
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,027
This one's different.

69
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,899
It's based on
ancient samurai discipline.

70
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,069
Danny, look at this guy nod.

71
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,167
What is that,
part of the ritual?

72
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,013
Hi there.

73
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,815
- Jesus! If looks could kill.
- Glad you haven't lost your touch.

74
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,858
I think she likes me.
I think she wants me.

75
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,485
I think you're batting zero for two,
and I don't wanna know you.

76
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,155
- She was undressing me with her eyes.
- You think so? Good luck, pal.

77
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,164
She had trouble with the buttons.

78
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,487
- Can I get a champagne, please?
- You got it.

79
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,490
I'm not saying anything.
I'm not even gonna look.

80
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,031
Was it that bad?

81
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:16,058
I was glad I wasn't on the receiving end
of that one. Cheers.

82
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,003
I hate it when guys think
they can come on like that.

83
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,437
Jimmy's okay.

84
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,772
He's just a little insecure
like the rest of us.

85
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:29,278
- My name is Dan Gallagher.
- Alex Forest.

86
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,874
Nice to meet you.
And what is your connection here?

87
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,954
I'm an editor at Robbins and Hart.
And you?

88
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,320
I'm with Miller, Goodman and Hurst.
I do all your legal work.

89
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,656
I haven't seen you around
their office, though.

90
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,491
I've just been with them
a couple of weeks.

91
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,963
- I have to go.
- Is that your wife?

92
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,368
Better run along.

93
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,844
It was very nice to meet you.

94
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,582
- Give me a break.
- Give you a break? What does this mean?

95
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,458
- How many did you buy?
- What does this mean?

96
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,099
- Thanks again, Christine.
- Anytime, Mrs. Gallagher.

97
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,766
Good night.

98
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,418
Aren't you forgetting something?

99
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,322
Quincy, let's hit it, pal.

100
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,669
You're such a good boy, yes.

101
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,585
You did such good business.
You're the best, boy.

102
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,151
Good night.

103
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,126
It's just for tonight, honey.

104
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,597
When you first see a house,
don't show any interest at all.

105
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,763
- Otherwise you can't negotiate.
- Will you stop worrying about it?

106
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:36,206
- Ellen, are you chewing gum again?
- We can't afford it anyway.

107
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:39,712
Look, there's no harm in looking.
It's just up the road from Mom and Dad.

108
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,907
- Just another reason not to buy it.
- I didn't hear that.

109
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,417
Really nothing to worry about.
We can't afford it anyway.

110
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:48,682
Come on.
Hold on a minute, honey.

111
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,722
Let's just not worry about it.
I haven't seen the damn place yet.

112
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,353
I may not even like it.

113
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,454
Ellen, the gum.

114
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,693
Thank you.

115
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:03,730
Come on, Quincy.

116
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,465
No, honey. Quincy's
gotta stay here with Daddy.

117
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,939
- Daddy's gonna be all alone.
- Sorry, Quincy.

118
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,569
- Don't forget to walk him.
- I promise.

119
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,375
You promise? Okay.
You have a good meeting.

120
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,007
- See you tomorrow night.
- I love you.

121
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,869
Two times down. Third time up
he looked like a jellyfish.

122
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:49,273
Sorry to ruin your weekend. Please
give my apologies to your lovely wife.

123
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,873
I will.

124
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,851
- So, how you feeling?
- Don't ask.

125
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,448
Henry's out of town, so I asked
Alex Forest to stand in for him.

126
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,517
- Anybody know where she is?
- She's on her way.

127
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:06,396
Since we got a little time, maybe you
can tell us what happened to your neck.

128
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,233
That's cute. Very cute.

129
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,306
Sorry I'm late.
I was getting the file.

130
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,738
This is Alex Forest,
our new associate editor.

131
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,572
We've met before.

132
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,078
Okay, can we get started?

133
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,877
Okay, here's the story.
You want to publish a novel...

134
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,545
in which one character is a senator
from New Jersey who's foolin' around.

135
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,454
Now, there's a certain congressman
from Ohio...

136
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,357
who claims the character's based on him
and filed an injunction against this.

137
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,191
The congressman's bald.
This guy has hair.

138
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,992
They're from different states.

139
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,999
If we don't sell those books,
we're screwed.

140
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,764
If I go to court to prove this senator's
not based upon this congressman...

141
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,305
then I have to know the truth.

142
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,433
Now...

143
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,670
strictly between these walls,
all right...

144
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:56,113
did the author have an affair
with Mr. Ohio or not?

145
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,614
Yeah, she did.

146
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,921
But she also had a lot of affairs
with other politicians.

147
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,621
Any one of them
could make the same claim.

148
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,994
She swears
this character's fictitious.

149
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,589
I just got off the phone with her.

150
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,032
And you believe her?

151
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,468
Yeah, I believe her.

152
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,636
Now that we got that on the table,
what can we do to lift that injunction?

153
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,372
If we believe the girl, is there some
way we can get to the congressman?

154
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,108
They take campaign contributions.
Can we buy him off?

155
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:33,380
Can we frighten him off? Is there
something in his past we can find?

156
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,047
We need to use some leverage.

157
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,337
Give me a break!

158
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,841
Come on.

159
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,553
- Is it made in Taiwan?
- These are tough to find.

160
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,120
Oh, wait, wait. Here.
We got one.

161
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,391
Come on!

162
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,370
You wanna go get a drink?

163
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,374
Yeah, I'd love it.

164
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,575
The strangest case I ever handled?

165
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,178
Well, the truth was
I never actually handled it...

166
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,815
but the strangest case
I ever came near to...

167
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:49,521
was when my parents got divorced
and my mother asked me to represent her.

168
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,288
- You're kidding.
- That's what I said.

169
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,698
"What do you mean?" she told me.
"You know what an asshole the guy is.

170
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,430
You've been a witness to this marriage
for 29 years."

171
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,006
Can you believe this?
This is coming from my mother.

172
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:05,635
- How did you get out of it?
- You can't turn your mother down.

173
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,510
So, I escaped on a technicality.

174
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,550
- Which was what?
- I didn't practice family law.

175
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,310
And it was true, you know,
and she bought it.

176
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,620
- Are you making this up?
- Could I make something up like that?

177
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,826
Waiter.

178
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,091
I've got a lot of pull here.
My favorite restaurant.

179
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,295
- I noticed.
- They know me well.

180
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:35,568
Miss. You want a coffee?
Can we have two coffees, please?

181
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,739
Well, I'll tell you, it's...

182
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,282
- You want one?
- No, thank you.

183
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,416
It's funny being a lawyer.
It's like being a doctor.

184
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,081
Everybody is telling you
their innermost secrets.

185
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,714
Oh, God.

186
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,918
You must have to be discreet.

187
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,483
Oh, God, yeah.

188
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,154
Are you?

189
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,330
Am I what?

190
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,427
Discreet.

191
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,912
Yes, I'm discreet.

192
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,506
Me too.

193
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:26,124
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

194
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:29,650
- Why don't you have a date tonight?
- I did have a date.

195
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,721
I stood him up.
That was the phone call I made.

196
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,301
Does that make you feel good?

197
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,866
It doesn't make me feel bad.

198
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,308
So, where's your wife?

199
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,313
Where's my wife?

200
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,253
My wife is in the country with
her parents, visiting for the weekend.

201
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:00,051
And you're here with a strange girl
being a naughty boy.

202
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,492
I don't think having dinner
with anybody is a crime.

203
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,021
Not yet.

204
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,392
Will it be?

205
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,265
I don't know.
What do you think?

206
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,931
I definitely think
it's gonna be up to you.

207
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,611
I can't say yet.
I haven't made up my mind.

208
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,781
At least you're very honest.

209
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,948
We were attracted to each other
at the party. That was obvious.

210
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:39,126
You're on your own for the night.
That's also obvious.

211
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,171
We're two adults.

212
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,515
Let's get the check.

213
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,349
- Oh, that was great.
- Thank God.

214
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,764
Are you feeling energetic?

215
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,993
What do you have in mind?

216
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,491
You live in this building?

217
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,433
Well, where can I get a cab?
Do you know?

218
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,344
- Have you ever done it in an elevator?
- Not recently.

219
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,474
I'll bet you haven't.

220
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:15,457
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.

221
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,126
How are you?

222
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,012
Hi. What happened to you?

223
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,538
I tried you earlier. I'm gonna go...
I guess you're not back yet.

224
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:35,087
I'm gonna go to bed now,
so call me in the morning. Bye-bye.

225
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,139
Oh, Dan, darling.
We were expecting you.

226
00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,711
I had work to do.

227
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,714
That's a pity. We really
wanted you to see that house.

228
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:05,685
- I'll see it next time.
- Of course. You wanna speak to Beth?

229
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,445
Yes, please.

230
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,487
Hold on a second.

231
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,915
The phone. It's Dan.
Here you are.

232
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,096
Hello.
What happened to you?

233
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:24,631
Hi. Nothing. I just went out
and had dinner with Bill last night.

234
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:26,365
How is he?

235
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:32,067
He's... Bill's Bill,
the same as usual.

236
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,771
Is he still with that girl?

237
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,440
Well, he wasn't last night.

238
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,983
I think it's over.
He didn't wanna talk about it.

239
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,444
So, you getting any work done?

240
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:43,783
Yeah, I'm working.

241
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:47,053
There's some of the spaghetti sauce
in the refrigerator if you get hungry.

242
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,617
Great. Okay.
How's Ellen doing?

243
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,289
She is having the best time.

244
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:55,129
I just hope that Dad survives it.

245
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:58,602
Honey, I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

246
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,472
she wants a rabbit.

247
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,007
No rabbits!

248
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:06,101
Jesus Christ! This goddamn family's
turning into Noah's ark.

249
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,909
I mean, please, give her a kiss,
all right? But no promises.

250
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,347
- All right.
- When are you coming home?

251
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:14,113
- Well, it's getting complicated.
- Why's that?

252
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,154
There's a problem with the house.

253
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,486
They sold it?

254
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:22,994
Very funny. No, we can't get in
to see it until late this afternoon.

255
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:26,259
I'm not up to fighting the traffic.
I thought I would come in tomorrow.

256
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,163
What about school?

257
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:31,795
She's only five years old.
What's she going to miss, trigonometry?

258
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:35,602
Okay, all right. Then I'll see you
when I get home from work.

259
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,869
Okay. See you tomorrow.

260
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,377
Okay. Thanks.
Have a good time.

261
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:41,879
Bye.

262
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:50,913
What happened?

263
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,958
I woke up, you weren't here.
I hate that.

264
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:02,166
You didn't get my note?

265
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,065
What note?

266
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:06,969
I left you a note
right by your bed.

267
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,183
That's nice.

268
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,276
I thought we were gonna
spend the day together.

269
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:25,153
Alex, I got so much work
to do today. I can't.

270
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:28,022
Why don't you just come over.
I'll cook us lunch.

271
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,721
I got to take the dog for a walk.
The poor dog has not been out all day.

272
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,696
I gotta take him out.

273
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,791
Bring the dog. I love animals.
I'm a great cook.

274
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,961
Come on.

275
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,835
Listen. I'd love to, but I can't.
I really can't.

276
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,397
Do what you have to do,
then come over afterwards.

277
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:45,410
We can always eat late.

278
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:50,671
Or you can work here.

279
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:55,117
I won't disturb you, I promise.
I'll be a good girl.

280
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:01,454
You don't give up, do you?
You just don't give up.

281
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,786
Come on, Quincy.

282
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,208
Help, Quincy.

283
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,045
I got it. I got it.

284
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,551
He's free.
Quincy, cover me.

285
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:31,055
I'm up. Go deep.
He fires.

286
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,249
Throws.

287
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:35,157
She got it.
Yes, it's back.

288
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,354
Over the head.
He's got it.

289
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,412
Dan, can you hear me?

290
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,004
Oh, my God.

291
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:05,717
- You bastard.
- Your face.

292
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:11,392
- That was a shitty thing to do.
- I'm sorry. I was just fooling around.

293
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,863
My father died of a heart attack.

294
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,198
I was seven years old.
It happened right in front of me.

295
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,669
Honey, I'm sorry.

296
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:27,405
Really, I had no idea. If I did,
I never would have done that.

297
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,076
What, he didn't die?
He's alive?

298
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,021
Yeah, he's alive and well
and living in Phoenix.

299
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,855
You certainly got me,
didn't you?

300
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,341
Let's hear it.

301
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:12,554
I hope you like spaghetti.
Specialty of the house.

302
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,889
Goes with the opera.

303
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,035
It smells so good.

304
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,870
- Anything else for me to do?
- No, nothing.

305
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:35,345
Just make yourself at home.
You can change the tape.

306
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:38,679
No, this is great.
I love Madame Butterfly.

307
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,981
Really?
It's my favorite opera.

308
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,351
Mine too.

309
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,686
First opera I ever saw.

310
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:50,921
My father, he took me to the old Met.
I was five years old.

311
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,486
Did it make any sense?

312
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,031
I got most of it.

313
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:58,468
There was this US sailor settin' up
house with this Japanese lady.

314
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,033
That was all fine,
but in the final act...

315
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,374
after he left her...

316
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:13,109
my father told me
she's gonna kill herself...

317
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,186
and I was terrified.

318
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:18,552
I was... I climbed
right underneath the chair.

319
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,318
It's right here.

320
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,421
This is it.

321
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,334
It's funny.

322
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,073
What?

323
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:45,082
One of the only times I recall my father
being nice to me when I was a kid...

324
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:49,248
comforting me at Madame Butterfly.

325
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,582
What?

326
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:30,357
What are you thinking about?

327
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:35,961
I was wondering why is it that all the
interesting guys are always married?

328
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:40,727
Maybe that's why you find them
interesting... you can't have them.

329
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,142
How long have you been married?

330
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,812
Nine years.

331
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,775
Do you have any kids?

332
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,216
I got a six-year-old girl.

333
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:57,719
Sounds good.

334
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,384
I'm lucky.

335
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,394
So what are you doing here?

336
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:17,942
You know how to ask them.

337
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,276
I really wanna know.

338
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,316
I had a wonderful time last night.
I'd like to see you again.

339
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,614
Is that so terrible?

340
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,847
No.

341
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:33,653
I just don't think
it's possible, though.

342
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,532
It's really strange.
I feel like I know you already.

343
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,394
I just wanna know where I stand.

344
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,933
I think you're terrific.

345
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,447
But I'm married.

346
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,947
What can I say?

347
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,216
Just my luck.

348
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,346
Oh, shit.

349
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,150
- What are you doing?
- I gotta go.

350
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:43,554
I thought you said she wasn't
coming back till tomorrow.

351
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:47,895
She's not, but I got things to do.
I gotta go home.

352
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:52,499
I don't think I like this.

353
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,265
Like what?

354
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:58,332
The way you run away
after every time we make love.

355
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,901
What difference does it make
whether I leave now or in the morning?

356
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,539
- The fact is I gotta go.
- You're not gonna leave now.

357
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,447
- Come on. Will you stop it?
- I mean it!

358
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:07,712
Come on. Hey!

359
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,023
What's the problem?

360
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:19,194
I'm sorry.

361
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,567
Jesus Christ.
I mean, let's be reasonable.

362
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,796
Be reasonable?

363
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:27,429
What?

364
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,007
"Thank you. Good-bye.
Don't call me. I'll call you."

365
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,076
Look, you knew about me,
all right.

366
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:34,510
I didn't hide anything.

367
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,547
- I thought it was understood.
- What was understood?

368
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:39,106
The opportunity was there
and we took it.

369
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,379
Come on now.
We are adults, aren't we?

370
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,421
What's that supposed to mean?

371
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,355
- I thought we'd have a good time.
- No, you didn't.

372
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:49,394
You thought you'd have a good time.
You didn't stop to think about me.

373
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,055
That's crazy.
You knew the rules.

374
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,722
What rules?

375
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,860
Look. I like you.

376
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:01,394
And if I wasn't with somebody else,
then maybe I'd be with you, but I am.

377
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,805
Please don't justify yourself.
It's pathetic.

378
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,005
If you told me to fuck off,
I'd have more respect for you.

379
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,644
All right then. Fuck off.

380
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,521
And you get out!

381
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:38,969
I'm going.

382
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:43,275
Why don't you come over here
and say good-bye nicely?

383
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,248
Let's be friends.

384
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,421
Baby, no.

385
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:02,091
It's okay.

386
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,697
Sorry if I upset you.

387
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:08,534
It's okay.
It's okay, really.

388
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,383
It's okay. All right.
It's okay now.

389
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:24,382
Your hands are all wet.

390
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,884
Oh, Jesus!

391
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,086
Jesus Christ!
Come here, come here!

392
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:34,965
Hold on, hold on.

393
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,334
Nice and tight.

394
00:36:57,182 --> 00:37:00,913
Hi. Did you just call me?

395
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:05,286
I was in the shower and I heard
the phone. I thought it was you.

396
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,950
So how are you?
Did you have a good day?

397
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,758
Really?

398
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,361
That's terrific.
That's really terrific.

399
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,406
You sound excited.

400
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:32,377
No, I'm not against the idea.
Don't get me wrong.

401
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,384
It's just the money.

402
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:47,321
Okay, darling.

403
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:48,991
I love you.

404
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,901
Bye.

405
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,733
How are you feeling?

406
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,934
Okay.

407
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,100
I gotta go.

408
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,811
Will you call me sometime?

409
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,042
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

410
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,176
No, I want to.

411
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:44,619
You promise me
you're gonna go see the doctor.

412
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,132
Good-bye.

413
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,097
You take care.

414
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,607
You too.

415
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,268
Shit.

416
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,366
Look what I got.
Look what I got for you here?

417
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:41,276
A little spaghetti and meat sauce.
That's it, buddy.

418
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:44,247
We'll make an Italian out of you yet.
That's a good boy.

419
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:46,784
All right.
Have a good one.

420
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,135
What are you doing here?
It's 8:00 a.m.

421
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:11,972
I'm in the shitter, Martha. I gotta be
in court by 2:00 and I'm really behind.

422
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:16,309
Do me a favor. Cancel everything
and call Drimmer. Tell him we're fine.

423
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:19,646
- I'll be there by 2:00.
- At 2:00? Okay.

424
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:22,286
Good morning, Martha.

425
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:31,719
- Daddy!
- Hey, honey! Oh, God, I missed you.

426
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:36,062
We had a great time. We went for a walk
with Grandpa and saw rabbits.

427
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,830
Well, good. Why don't you slow down.
I can't understand a word you're saying.

428
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,996
- Daddy, I want a rabbit.
- I know you do, honey.

429
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:43,802
- Hi, darling. How are you?
- Good.

430
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,084
Oh, God, I missed you.

431
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,584
Liar.

432
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,245
I did.

433
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,221
I should go away more often.

434
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:14,665
- I did this one.
- You did?

435
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:17,799
- Pick another one.
- I thought it was this row you picked.

436
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:21,004
- It was this one.
- I think you're in a lot of trouble.

437
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:30,812
Phooey. I can't do it.

438
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,959
Now pick a card, Dad.

439
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:45,935
Any card at all?

440
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,596
- Of course.
- Where'd she learn this?

441
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,606
Grandpa showed me.

442
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,835
It's a surprise.

443
00:41:58,283 --> 00:41:59,545
So, how was it?

444
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:04,621
Come on. I'm a big boy.
I can take it.

445
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,916
It had a place for rabbits.

446
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:12,190
Oh, no! She said it.
She said the "R" word.

447
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:17,426
Not rabbits? Rabbits?

448
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:25,405
Well, what can I tell you?
It's absolutely perfect.

449
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:27,502
In this row?

450
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:32,977
So, when are you gonna come up
and take a look at it?

451
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,383
- Just for the hell of it?
- In this row?

452
00:42:36,488 --> 00:42:38,683
How about tomorrow morning?

453
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:42,288
- Daddy, which row?
- You mean it?

454
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,124
If you can get me back
to the office by 1:00, yeah.

455
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:47,460
Which row, Dad?

456
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:49,659
It's in this row, sweetheart.

457
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:18,419
Honey?

458
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:20,589
Honey, come here.
I want you to see this.

459
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,867
Well?

460
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,874
Well, it's... it's okay.

461
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,941
What do you mean?
It's fantastic.

462
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:35,570
It's great.

463
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:39,344
Just think of all the money
we're gonna save not living in New York.

464
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:42,477
The local high school is excellent.
My own children went there.

465
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:45,715
- You see?
- This is a terrific area for kids.

466
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,087
I'm sure it is.
Is it okay if I go upstairs?

467
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,094
- Go ahead. I'll wait for you down here.
- Thank you.

468
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:55,826
You know,
we still gotta decorate.

469
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,801
We can fix up anything.
We can have painting parties.

470
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:02,033
Painting parties?
Beth, you're making me very nervous.

471
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,478
Now look at this.
This is fantastic.

472
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,475
This would make a terrific playroom.

473
00:44:15,587 --> 00:44:19,250
What are you talking about playroom?
This is my den. It's a den.

474
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:21,825
I knew you were gonna like it.

475
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:25,630
I like it.

476
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,803
I'll be in court.
How you doing, Dan?

477
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:43,142
Hi, Eunice.
Did Martha get back from lunch?

478
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:46,115
- She just returned.
- Thank you.

479
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:00,456
This isn't a bad time, is it?
I was in the area.

480
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,261
No. No. You...
Do you wanna come in my office?

481
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:21,982
You gonna be in your office later?
There's a little something... Excuse me.

482
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,886
- Haven't we met somewhere?
- I don't think so.

483
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:27,550
She looked at me first.

484
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:32,287
Sit down.

485
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,076
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

486
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:51,479
I was gonna call you today.

487
00:45:58,623 --> 00:46:01,558
This is terribly embarrassing.

488
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:06,222
I just wanted to say sorry
for what happened.

489
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,891
I had no right
to put you through that.

490
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:13,871
Nothing happened, okay?

491
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:17,839
I was going through a bad time
and everything was coming to a crisis.

492
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:22,777
But I'm fine. I'm really all right.
And thank you.

493
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:26,214
- You don't have to thank me.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

494
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,752
A lot of guys
would have just run away.

495
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,117
I don't know what I would have done
if you hadn't been there.

496
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:37,658
Well, you... you look good.

497
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:40,027
As a matter of fact,
you look great.

498
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,231
Thanks.

499
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,001
So that's past?

500
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,943
- May I ask you one more favor?
- What's that?

501
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:59,380
I've got two tickets
to Madame Butterfly...

502
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,317
two weeks from Thursday.

503
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:06,220
I'd really love it if you'd come
with me, kind of as a peace offering.

504
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:10,859
That's... That's very nice of you...

505
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,221
but I don't think it's a good idea.

506
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,095
No strings attached.

507
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:20,738
You don't have to explain.
I just thought I'd ask.

508
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:25,241
So...

509
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,381
I'll see you around sometime.

510
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:49,660
Come here.

511
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:57,073
Take care.

512
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,836
Good-bye.

513
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,734
Let's go, pal!

514
00:48:30,842 --> 00:48:33,606
We're on a roll.
We're on a roll.

515
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,884
I like it.

516
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:43,921
Very nice.

517
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:04,573
That is no good.

518
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:35,671
How about Rodgers
versus whatchamacallit?

519
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:38,742
- Winitsky.
- Right. I got your memo.

520
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:41,175
- You gonna go for summary judgment?
- Why not, Arthur?

521
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:44,806
The facts are not in dispute. Rodgers
admits reading Winitsky's article.

522
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:47,612
The question is whether
he plagiarized it in his book.

523
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:50,950
You can't copyright an idea,
only the expression of the idea...

524
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:54,549
and Rodgers sure as hell didn't use
any of the words in the book.

525
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,684
Let me think about it.

526
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:59,093
So, I hear you're about
to become a suburbanite.

527
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,188
We're gonna take the big plunge.

528
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:03,790
- Got a buyer for the apartment?
- No.

529
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:06,928
- Got cold sweats about your escrow?
- Yeah.

530
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,529
But not about Rodgers
versus Winitsky?

531
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,904
- No, sir.
- Good.

532
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,273
He's still in a meeting.

533
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:18,443
Yes, I know. I did expect him
to be through by now.

534
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,844
I'd like you to have lunch with me
on Tuesday, if you're around.

535
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:27,482
Thank you, Arthur. That'd be great.
Let me just check my diary.

536
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:30,857
You are on his list of calls.
It's Alex Forest.

537
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:34,489
Again? I thought you told her
I'd call her back.

538
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:36,658
- I did.
- Put her on hold.

539
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,565
Would you mind holding?

540
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:41,161
- Tuesday would be great.
- I look forward to it.

541
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:43,206
Thank you. I will too.

542
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,671
Put her through.

543
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,550
Look, Alex, I thought we agreed
this was not a good idea.

544
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:04,427
Why?

545
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,466
I'm sorry.
I thought you understood.

546
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,560
If I misled you in some way,
I apologize.

547
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:16,970
But I don't think it's a good idea
if we talk to each other anymore.

548
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,507
Okay?

549
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:21,644
Good-bye.

550
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,648
If she calls again,
tell her I'm not here.

551
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,313
Thank you.

552
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,398
Wait. Let me do something.

553
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,563
Let me just look at you.

554
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:26,538
You're so beautiful.

555
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,908
You're just so beautiful.

556
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:43,959
- Wouldn't you know.
- I know.

557
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:58,705
Do you know how many injuries can...

558
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:00,903
- That's my wife!
- Don't terrorize them.

559
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:03,469
I'm a lawyer. I'm insured.

560
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,447
Oh, it's excited.

561
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,450
Now don't forget who gave you this.

562
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,986
My cold sores are almost gone.

563
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:12,750
This is for you. Ladies first.
I use that term advisedly.

564
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:16,050
You bet, sweetie.

565
00:53:16,127 --> 00:53:19,494
That's my wife!
A little attention, please.

566
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:22,191
Ladies. Gentleman.

567
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,767
My wife.
My little ball and chain.

568
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:27,838
- You should have such a ball and chain.
- Mother of some of my children.

569
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:32,433
- Wouldn't be that confident about it.
- Here is to Miller, Goodman...

570
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,910
Hurst and Gallagher.

571
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:37,914
- Here's to Mrs. Gallagher.
- Give me a break, will you, guys?

572
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,848
All he did was ask me to lunch.

573
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:42,852
Your moving to your country estate.
You'll forget you ever knew us.

574
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,650
Wait a minute.
I read one of those self-help books.

575
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:48,055
Published by Robbins and Hart,
of course.

576
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:50,184
Samurai Self-Help.

577
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,368
In it, it tells you how to deal
with the anxieties of your friends...

578
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,769
as you move up the corporate ladder
and they stay put...

579
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,273
or, God forbid, go down.

580
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:08,505
And in this book, it tells you
not to coddle your friends' anxieties.

581
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,548
So I'm not gonna make
any false reassurances, guys.

582
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:14,448
I'm not gonna tell you you're gonna be
up to the house every weekend.

583
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:17,954
Let's face it. Things have changed.
This is not a classless society.

584
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:21,958
As a matter of fact, this is it.
Good-bye. Good-bye.

585
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:25,359
I knew he was gonna say that.
The man is running true to form.

586
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,657
Honey, I think we gotta make
a clean break.

587
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,495
We're on a roll.
We gotta travel light.

588
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:32,536
Thanks for the time you've given us.

589
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:44,110
Here, you, drink. I want you
with a lamp shade on your head by 10:00.

590
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:46,979
Why should today be any different
from any other?

591
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,183
Here's to you.

592
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:54,346
Yeah, Richards.
It's kind of late, isn't it?

593
00:55:57,554 --> 00:56:01,285
If you refuse to take my phone calls
at the office, you leave me no choice.

594
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:06,189
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Can't this wait till tomorrow morning?

595
00:56:06,297 --> 00:56:08,162
Is it awkward for you to talk?

596
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:12,500
You could say that.

597
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:15,229
I've gotta see you.

598
00:56:15,306 --> 00:56:17,069
I don't have the...

599
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:22,006
the documentation to answer that right
now, but I'll call you from the office.

600
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,681
No. Meet me in front of the Robbins
and Hart building tomorrow, 6:00.

601
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,549
Don't disappoint me.

602
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:32,088
Be there.

603
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:42,564
- This has gotta stop.
- If you saw me, I wouldn't call.

604
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:45,261
Do you get it? It's over.
There's nothing between us.

605
00:56:45,336 --> 00:56:48,430
You mean you've had your fun.
Now you just want a quiet life.

606
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,405
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

607
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:52,408
- You need help.
- Don't tell me what I need.

608
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,535
You need a shrink!

609
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,977
Why are you so hostile?
I'm not your enemy.

610
00:56:57,047 --> 00:57:00,505
- Then why are you trying to hurt me?
- I'm not. I love you.

611
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,711
- You what?
- I love you.

612
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:07,149
- You don't even know me.
- How can you say that?

613
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:09,158
We spent a weekend together,
that's all.

614
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:11,353
You stayed that second night.
You must like me a little.

615
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:15,057
Because I was concerned about you.
Why do you read so much into everything?

616
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:19,033
Can't you understand? I have
a whole relationship with someone else.

617
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,536
I am very happy.

618
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,595
Whole means complete.

619
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:25,005
If your life's so damn complete,
what were you doing with me?

620
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:29,034
- Is that what you wanna talk about?
- I'm pregnant.

621
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:36,215
I saw my gynecologist on Monday.

622
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,413
Here's his card.
You can call him.

623
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,028
You don't...

624
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:50,800
Use anything?

625
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:55,937
I had a very bad miscarriage last year.
I didn't think I could get pregnant.

626
00:57:58,175 --> 00:58:00,803
How do you know it's mine?

627
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:05,671
Because I don't sleep around.

628
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,052
I apologize.

629
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:22,792
I'm sorry.

630
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,528
Don't worry. You're not gonna
have to handle this alone.

631
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,968
Handle what?

632
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:31,235
The abortion. I'll take care of it.
I'll pay for it.

633
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,273
What makes you think
I want an abortion?

634
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:40,910
You're not gonna have the baby.

635
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,849
Why not?

636
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,354
There are plenty
of one-parent families.

637
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:49,017
- At least they don't end in divorce.
- I don't have a say in this?

638
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,788
I want this child.

639
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:55,956
It has nothing to do with you. I want it
whether you're a part of it or not.

640
00:58:56,066 --> 00:59:00,002
Then why are you telling me?
Why not just go ahead and do it?

641
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,607
I was hoping that you would want
to be a part of it.

642
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:10,111
This is crazy.
This is totally insane.

643
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:13,377
I'm 36 years old. It may be
my last chance to have a child.

644
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:20,716
Just think what you're saying.

645
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:23,157
Just think about it.

646
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:28,130
We are gonna live with this
for the rest of our lives.

647
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:30,132
I know that.

648
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:33,529
I've thought of that.
I know how you feel.

649
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:37,597
It's a big thing,
but it doesn't have to be a problem.

650
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,767
Really, it doesn't.

651
00:59:39,843 --> 00:59:42,869
You play fair with me,
I'll play fair with you.

652
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:52,878
"He led Agnes and Nellie
into the hall closet and shut the door.

653
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:56,118
Agnes and Nellie and Oink giggled
and laughed in the dark.

654
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:58,354
Pearl listened outside the door.

655
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,293
'Oh, it works,' cried Nellie.

656
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:01,854
'Of course,' said Oink.

657
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,900
'Look at the flying dog,'
yelled Agnes.

658
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,696
'Wow! ' cried Nellie.

659
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:09,068
Pearl frowned. 'Who cares
about flying dogs? ' she said.

660
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:11,130
Nobody heard her.

661
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,540
'Look out for the worms! '
Squealed Agnes.

662
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,976
'Eeek! ' yelled Nellie
and Agnes together.

663
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:19,209
'Look at the monster cockroach! '
Yelled Oink.

664
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,308
'Help!"'

665
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:07,045
So you know what I did?
I called the doctor.

666
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,585
You know what he says?
"Congratulations."

667
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:12,781
I can't even imagine
what she told him.

668
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:15,449
Anyway, that's not the end of it.

669
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,151
After I talk to the doctor...

670
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:22,494
this morning
I broke into her apartment.

671
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:25,831
I know. Me, a lawyer,
breaking and entering.

672
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:28,928
I'm looking for something, anything to
get a handle on what I'm dealing with.

673
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:32,941
I thought maybe I could find out
she was sleeping with somebody else.

674
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,569
Well, I didn't find anything.

675
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:42,748
Anyway, I didn't find anything.

676
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:47,413
Jimmy, I don't know anything
about family law.

677
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:50,687
You gotta help me.
What kind of case does she really have?

678
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:57,424
It ain't good.

679
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,869
She keeps calling the apartment.

680
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:05,166
Every time Beth answers the phone,
she hangs up.

681
01:04:07,811 --> 01:04:10,678
I'm scared, Jimmy. L...

682
01:04:10,747 --> 01:04:12,874
I don't wanna lose my family.

683
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:24,225
The facts, as alleged,
are horrendous.

684
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:27,195
The instrument allegedly used
in all three cases...

685
01:04:27,264 --> 01:04:29,960
was an electronic shock device
or stun gun...

686
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,842
Operator. May I help you?

687
01:04:48,952 --> 01:04:53,753
Operator, I've been trying
to get 555-8129. 212?

688
01:04:53,824 --> 01:04:58,227
- Recording says it's been disconnected.
- Just a moment, please.

689
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:00,320
I'm sorry, the number's been
changed to an unlisted number.

690
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:03,264
Operator, this is a real emergency.
You need to give me that number.

691
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:05,358
I'm sorry. We're not allowed
to give out that information.

692
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:08,700
- Well, fuck you!
- My place or yours?

693
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:49,645
- I like it. I like it a lot.
- Well, we've been very happy here.

694
01:05:49,713 --> 01:05:51,908
I'd definitely like
to think about it, if I could.

695
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,419
- It's so clean.
- Yes.

696
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,955
We have a cleaning lady who comes in
a couple times a week.

697
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:03,457
- I can certainly give you her name.
- I'd love that.

698
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:06,290
And there's baby-sitters galore.
The whole works.

699
01:06:06,363 --> 01:06:09,730
Whatever information you would need.
You know, they have...

700
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:16,572
Hi, darling.
Darling, this is Alex.

701
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,808
- I've forgotten your last name.
- Alex Forest.

702
01:06:18,942 --> 01:06:21,934
This is my husband, Dan.

703
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,780
Hi. Glad to meet you.

704
01:06:27,117 --> 01:06:28,516
Nice to meet you.

705
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:32,955
Haven't we met somewhere before?

706
01:06:33,023 --> 01:06:34,422
I don't think so, no.

707
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:41,893
We have.
Weren't you at that party...

708
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,932
at the Japanese place
a few weeks ago?

709
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,434
Honey, the exercise book.

710
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,198
Oh, yeah.

711
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:52,264
You're a lawyer and you work
for the firm of...

712
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:57,472
What's the name?
Well, anyway, we've definitely met.

713
01:06:57,547 --> 01:06:59,640
Well, you have a good memory.

714
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:01,547
I never forget a face.

715
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,245
It's a small world.

716
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,811
It certainly is.

717
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:10,586
So, I gather
you're going to the country?

718
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:14,588
- Moving to the country?
- Yes.

719
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:17,758
- Have you found a place yet?
- We found a place in Bedford.

720
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,768
- Do you know it up there?
- Oh, it's beautiful, yes.

721
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:23,601
I guess you'll be moving
out of here almost immediately?

722
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:27,234
Actually, we wanted to do
some remodeling first.

723
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,744
I guess you're looking for a place
right away, aren't you?

724
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:31,974
Well, yeah,
I'd kind of like to settle in.

725
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,414
Alex is expecting a baby.

726
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,688
Oh, that's...

727
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:42,748
Will you excuse me?
I have some work I've got to do.

728
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:46,190
I better run too.

729
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:50,028
Thank you for the tea
and showing me the apartment.

730
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:52,601
- You're very welcome.
- I like it.

731
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:55,728
- I really like it.
- We've been very happy here.

732
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:57,773
I'd like to think about it,
if I could.

733
01:07:57,841 --> 01:08:00,571
Let me give you our number
so you can call us direct.

734
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,235
Thank you.

735
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:22,324
- I'll keep in touch.
- Great.

736
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,491
- Bye-bye.
- Good-bye.

737
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:32,172
She seemed really interested.

738
01:08:32,242 --> 01:08:34,176
It's funny.
She didn't mention a husband.

739
01:08:34,244 --> 01:08:37,213
I get the feeling
that she's on her own.

740
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,908
- What is it? You seem down.
- No, I'm just tired.

741
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:02,002
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

742
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:04,632
Who?

743
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:08,404
You know damn well who it is.
Let me in. I wanna talk.

744
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,412
So now you wanna talk?

745
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:31,599
So, what can I get you?
I've got scotch, vodka.

746
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:35,126
- I've got a nice chablis...
- Cut the shit, will you?

747
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:36,796
Just cut it!

748
01:09:40,143 --> 01:09:42,168
I don't know what you're up to...

749
01:09:42,245 --> 01:09:44,179
but I'm gonna tell you
it's gonna stop right now.

750
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:46,272
No, it's not gonna stop.
It's gonna go on and on...

751
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,283
until you face up
to your responsibilities.

752
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,579
What responsibilities?

753
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,712
I'm pregnant.
I'm going to have our child.

754
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:56,589
That's your choice, honey.
That has nothing to do with me.

755
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,593
I just wanna be
a part of your life.

756
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:01,323
This is the way you do it, huh?
Showing up at my apartment?

757
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:03,729
What am I supposed to do?
You won't answer my calls.

758
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:07,667
You change your number.
I'm not going to be ignored!

759
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,539
You don't get it.
You just... You don't get it.

760
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:17,905
Don't you remember our weekend?

761
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,939
I mean, wasn't that wonderful?

762
01:10:21,017 --> 01:10:23,315
Why can't we just
be like that again?

763
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:28,314
I know you feel it too.
I mean, what are you so afraid of?

764
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:30,325
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

765
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:34,453
Go ahead, hit me.
If you can't fuck me, just hit me.

766
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:37,523
You're so sad. Do you know that?
You're lonely and very sad.

767
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:40,296
Don't you ever pity me,
you smug bastard.

768
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,963
I'll pity you,
because you're sick.

769
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,701
Why? Because I won't allow you
to treat me like some slut...

770
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:49,904
you can just bang a couple times
and throw in the garbage?

771
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:56,477
I'm gonna be
the mother of your child.

772
01:10:56,553 --> 01:10:58,544
I want a little respect.

773
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,192
You want respect?

774
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,957
- Respect.
- What are you doing?

775
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:12,000
Please don't go.
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

776
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:14,002
I'll tell your wife.

777
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:19,508
You tell my wife, I'll kill you.

778
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:24,369
It only takes a phone call!

779
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,387
Hello? Hello?

780
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:46,461
Guys, that's on the second door
to the left all the way in the landing.

781
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:48,662
Thank you.

782
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:51,171
You could have stayed
in the apartment.

783
01:11:51,241 --> 01:11:53,402
Dan was in such a hurry
to get out of New York.

784
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:56,240
Mama, that's you, isn't it?

785
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,246
Oh, Lord, put it away.

786
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,248
All right, easy on that door frame.

787
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:03,448
Nice, nice.
Just like a glove.

788
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,803
I got it. Sorry.

789
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:32,442
Hello? Martha.

790
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:39,886
It's Martha.

791
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:01,973
Hi, honey. How you doing?
Did the plumber come yet?

792
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,677
Did he ever.

793
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:10,651
I don't really wanna know about it.
Guess what I'm looking at.

794
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:14,019
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it right here.

795
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,524
Or I should say, I got her.

796
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,522
What's she like?

797
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:21,222
Well, she's cute.
She looks like a rabbit.

798
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:24,300
She's white, long ears,
little pink eyes.

799
01:13:24,434 --> 01:13:27,801
- Soft.
- She sounds cute.

800
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,270
Ellen doesn't know
anything about it?

801
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:33,798
No, she doesn't think
she's gonna get one.

802
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,310
See what happens if
you work here too long, Eunice?

803
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:38,609
- Isn't she cute.
- Thank you.

804
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:41,707
Oh, I forgot.
This arrived for you.

805
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:44,275
- Good night, Eunice.
- Good night, Mr. Gallagher.

806
01:13:57,834 --> 01:13:59,665
Hey, Joaquin!

807
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,201
Jesus fucking Christ!

808
01:15:50,313 --> 01:15:53,840
Fucking bitch!
Jesus Christ.

809
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:02,049
It had something to do
with the electrical system.

810
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:05,184
The whole goddamn thing blew up.
A lot of smoke.

811
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:07,354
All right, honey,
I'll see you in a little while.

812
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:29,076
Mr. Gallagher?
You forgot your contract.

813
01:17:36,452 --> 01:17:39,444
Hello, Dan.
Are you surprised?

814
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:43,454
This is what you've reduced me to.

815
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:45,460
I guess you thought
you'd get away with it.

816
01:17:45,528 --> 01:17:47,462
Well, you can't.

817
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,695
Because part of you
is growing inside of me...

818
01:17:52,802 --> 01:17:55,703
and that's a fact, Dan,
and you'd better start...

819
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:58,137
learning how to deal with it.

820
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:05,474
'Cause, you know, I feel you.

821
01:18:05,548 --> 01:18:09,985
I taste you.
I think you.

822
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:11,644
I touch you.

823
01:18:13,756 --> 01:18:15,781
Can you understand?

824
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:17,450
Can you?

825
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:22,121
I'm just asking you...

826
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:26,157
to acknowledge
your responsibilities.

827
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:28,726
Is that so bad?

828
01:18:28,838 --> 01:18:30,772
I don't think so.

829
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,741
I don't think it's unreasonable.

830
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:36,369
And, you know,
another thing is that...

831
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:41,508
you thought you could just
walk into my life...

832
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:43,916
and turn it upside down...

833
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:46,784
without a thought
for anyone but yourself.

834
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,638
You know what you are, Dan?

835
01:19:12,715 --> 01:19:15,741
You're a cock-sucking
son of a bitch.

836
01:19:15,818 --> 01:19:20,812
I hate you. I bet
you don't even like girls, do you?

837
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:23,688
You flaming, fucking faggot.

838
01:20:16,746 --> 01:20:18,873
Daddy! Thank you!

839
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:26,889
Like it?

840
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,804
You thought you could just
walk into my life...

841
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,939
and turn it upside down...

842
01:21:27,016 --> 01:21:30,179
without a thought
for anyone but yourself.

843
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:32,379
You know what you are, Dan?

844
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:36,550
You're a cock-sucking
son of a bitch.

845
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,260
You are.

846
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:43,162
I bet you don't
even like girls, do you?

847
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:45,757
They probably scare you.

848
01:21:45,835 --> 01:21:47,769
I know I do.

849
01:21:48,871 --> 01:21:51,135
So you're scared of me, aren't you?

850
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,209
You're fucking frightened of me.
You're afraid.

851
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:57,302
You're afraid, aren't you?
You gutless, heartless...

852
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,347
spineless fucking son of a bitch.

853
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:02,543
I hate you.
You deserve everything you get...

854
01:22:05,187 --> 01:22:06,119
Sorry.

855
01:22:06,188 --> 01:22:09,487
I was wondering what you
were doing up so late.

856
01:22:09,558 --> 01:22:11,492
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

857
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:15,758
It's okay. I was just listening
to a deposition and couldn't sleep.

858
01:22:15,831 --> 01:22:18,766
Come on.
I'm gonna give you a back rub.

859
01:22:18,834 --> 01:22:21,962
- A back rub?
- Brandy, a back rub.

860
01:22:22,071 --> 01:22:24,505
You won't know what hit you.

861
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:26,131
Sounds good.

862
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:32,812
My client wants it stopped.

863
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,714
Hejust wants an end
to the harassment.

864
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,515
He's positive it was this woman
who trashed the car?

865
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:41,613
Yes, of course.

866
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,818
- Any witnesses?
- No.

867
01:22:46,595 --> 01:22:49,120
He's welcome to file a complaint,
if it'd make him feel better.

868
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:51,928
There's not a lot you can do
without proof.

869
01:22:52,001 --> 01:22:54,936
Look, Lieutenant, this woman
is completely irrational.

870
01:22:55,004 --> 01:22:56,972
There's no telling
what she could do.

871
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:59,940
We can't go around arresting people
for what they might do. You know that.

872
01:23:00,009 --> 01:23:04,571
I'm not asking you to arrest her.
He simply...

873
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,117
He wants her warned.

874
01:23:12,788 --> 01:23:15,086
Well, we could talk to her.

875
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:18,024
It may make things public.
He's not gonna like that.

876
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:20,926
It may even aggravate
the situation with the girl.

877
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,554
How's that?

878
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:27,068
Whatever resentment she's feeling,
she probably got it out of her system.

879
01:23:27,136 --> 01:23:30,071
And any action we take
could provoke her.

880
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,006
What if she didn't get it
out of her system? What then?

881
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:39,245
You have to catch her in the act.
Then we can bring charges.

882
01:23:39,315 --> 01:23:41,875
Well, you say he just has to
sit there and take it?

883
01:23:41,951 --> 01:23:45,682
It's his bed. Afraid
he's gonna have to lie in it.

884
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,334
Come on.

885
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:14,349
Come on, Ellen.
We're going to Grandma's.

886
01:24:18,454 --> 01:24:22,015
Come on, Quince.
Quincy, come on. Hurry up.

887
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:24,855
Come on. Get on in.
Hurry up.

888
01:24:24,927 --> 01:24:27,452
Watch his tail, sweetie.
Make him sit down.

889
01:24:42,678 --> 01:24:44,703
See you didn't get your car back.

890
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:48,146
No, it's a total write-off.
The electrical system's just shot.

891
01:24:48,217 --> 01:24:50,981
Extraordinary, those foreign cars.

892
01:24:51,053 --> 01:24:53,180
- Here you are, dear.
- Oh, thank you.

893
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,156
- Wanna try again, sweetie?
- Okay.

894
01:24:56,225 --> 01:24:59,717
Okay. So?

895
01:24:59,795 --> 01:25:05,665
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

896
01:25:05,734 --> 01:25:07,292
Very good.

897
01:25:07,369 --> 01:25:11,305
You wanna do it one more time.
Do it with your hat and do the bow.

898
01:25:11,373 --> 01:25:14,103
So when you actually do it,
you know what you're doing.

899
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:16,143
Let me see your bow.

900
01:25:19,548 --> 01:25:20,913
And what do you say?

901
01:25:20,983 --> 01:25:25,784
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

902
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:27,287
Very good.

903
01:25:28,924 --> 01:25:30,516
Come here.

904
01:25:33,662 --> 01:25:35,391
That was good.

905
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:38,262
- Thank you.
- That was really good.

906
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:40,267
That was so good.

907
01:25:43,672 --> 01:25:45,936
- I love you.
- I love you too.

908
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:47,599
Thank you, darling.

909
01:26:12,067 --> 01:26:13,659
Come on, Quincy.

910
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:38,247
Daddy!

911
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,947
What?

912
01:27:43,759 --> 01:27:44,953
Whitey's gone!

913
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:12,552
It's all right, darling.
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

914
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,885
You should try to get some sleep.

915
01:28:40,449 --> 01:28:43,077
- She okay?
- She's asleep.

916
01:28:46,588 --> 01:28:49,352
- Did you call the police?
- Not yet, no.

917
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:50,686
Why not?

918
01:28:54,263 --> 01:28:56,458
Honey, we gotta talk.

919
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:06,498
What is it?

920
01:29:07,876 --> 01:29:09,867
I know who did this.

921
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:13,007
You do?

922
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:15,212
Who?

923
01:29:15,284 --> 01:29:17,479
Remember the girl who...

924
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:20,020
came to the apartment?

925
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:23,057
The one I met
in the Japanese restaurant?

926
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:27,687
The one with the blond hair.

927
01:29:35,137 --> 01:29:36,832
You're scaring me.

928
01:29:42,611 --> 01:29:45,239
What is it?

929
01:29:45,347 --> 01:29:47,577
Did you have an affair with her?

930
01:29:47,649 --> 01:29:49,344
Yes.

931
01:30:10,839 --> 01:30:12,773
I am so sorry.

932
01:30:14,476 --> 01:30:19,778
The last thing I ever wanted to do
was to hurt you.

933
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,918
Are you in love with her?

934
01:30:30,359 --> 01:30:34,625
No, it was one night.
It didn't mean anything.

935
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:50,637
What has it got to do
with what's happened?

936
01:30:54,983 --> 01:30:56,280
She's pregnant.

937
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:02,546
She's... It's yours?

938
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:06,617
I don't know. That's what she says.
Honey, listen to me.

939
01:31:06,695 --> 01:31:09,357
Get out!
I want you out of here!

940
01:31:09,431 --> 01:31:11,661
I want you out of this house,
and I want you out now!

941
01:31:11,733 --> 01:31:13,667
How could you do this?
I hate you!

942
01:31:13,735 --> 01:31:17,227
- Honey, you don't understand.
- I don't wanna hear it!

943
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:20,274
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Please, just listen to me.

944
01:31:20,342 --> 01:31:21,832
Please, please, listen.

945
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:23,878
What is the matter with you?

946
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:37,217
Dan. What a pleasant surprise.

947
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:42,680
It's over, Alex. It's all finished.
I told Beth. She knows all about it.

948
01:32:43,825 --> 01:32:48,125
Sure.
You haven't got the balls.

949
01:32:48,196 --> 01:32:50,357
Why don't you speak to her.

950
01:32:52,267 --> 01:32:54,758
Why would I wanna talk to her?

951
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:08,906
This is Beth Gallagher.

952
01:33:09,017 --> 01:33:12,646
If you ever come near my family again,
I'll kill you. You understand?

953
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:42,682
That's the last one.
I mean it.

954
01:34:00,268 --> 01:34:02,327
Hello?

955
01:34:02,404 --> 01:34:03,996
Hi, Daddy.

956
01:34:06,675 --> 01:34:09,007
When are you coming home?

957
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:16,318
Honey, I don't know.
How are you doing?

958
01:34:17,686 --> 01:34:19,278
Good.

959
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:29,024
Grandpa taught me a new card trick.

960
01:34:29,097 --> 01:34:31,930
Oh, did he?
The one with the jacks?

961
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,434
No, the one with kings.

962
01:34:36,338 --> 01:34:37,930
Good.

963
01:34:41,443 --> 01:34:43,070
I won't.

964
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:46,838
Good.

965
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:55,415
How's Mommy?
Send her my love?

966
01:34:55,490 --> 01:34:58,459
Okay. Good-bye.

967
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,756
Daddy?

968
01:35:00,829 --> 01:35:03,320
Call me tomorrow.

969
01:35:04,265 --> 01:35:06,096
I will. I promise.

970
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:08,158
You be sure
you tell Mommy I called?

971
01:35:08,236 --> 01:35:10,761
I will.

972
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:12,772
Love you a lot too.

973
01:36:02,123 --> 01:36:04,887
Hi, Mrs. Gallagher.
Did you forget something?

974
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:07,086
- I came to get Ellen.
- Ellen?

975
01:36:07,162 --> 01:36:09,096
I thought you picked her up already.

976
01:36:10,231 --> 01:36:12,165
Well, I'm sure
she's left already.

977
01:36:12,967 --> 01:36:15,765
Betty, is Ellen in here with you?

978
01:36:15,837 --> 01:36:17,805
- She's gone home already.
- Are you sure?

979
01:36:17,872 --> 01:36:20,739
I'm positive. She's not inside
and she's not in the playground.

980
01:36:20,809 --> 01:36:23,869
- I thought you picked her up.
- Who did pick her up?

981
01:36:23,978 --> 01:36:25,878
Don't worry.
She can't have gone far.

982
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:29,213
- You don't understand.
- I'll check her locker.

983
01:36:34,422 --> 01:36:36,515
Alicia, where's Ellen?

984
01:36:36,591 --> 01:36:37,990
She's gone.

985
01:36:40,495 --> 01:36:42,224
Call the police!

986
01:36:50,004 --> 01:36:52,734
Please let her be all right.
Please.

987
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:56,474
Oh, Christ.

988
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:02,010
Where are you?

989
01:38:25,033 --> 01:38:27,593
Where are you?

990
01:38:53,661 --> 01:38:55,959
- Bye-bye, Ellen.
- Bye.

991
01:38:58,833 --> 01:39:00,232
Can I have a kiss?

992
01:39:15,583 --> 01:39:17,744
Excuse me. I'm looking
for a patient named Gallagher.

993
01:39:17,819 --> 01:39:19,343
I'm her husband.

994
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:22,082
Room 22 at the end of the corridor.

995
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:25,125
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

996
01:39:25,193 --> 01:39:28,356
She was very lucky.
It might've been a lot worse.

997
01:39:28,429 --> 01:39:30,294
Thank you.
Hi, baby.

998
01:39:30,365 --> 01:39:33,857
Oh, God, I missed you.
I missed you, honey.

999
01:39:33,935 --> 01:39:36,961
Are you okay?
Did you see Mommy yet?

1000
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:39,164
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

1001
01:39:39,274 --> 01:39:41,765
You stay here with Granny.
I'm gonna go see Mommy.

1002
01:40:10,672 --> 01:40:12,640
You're gonna be okay.

1003
01:45:06,701 --> 01:45:09,226
I came in before.
I tried to explain the situation.

1004
01:45:09,303 --> 01:45:11,396
You didn't wanna listen to me.
Now, the woman took my kid.

1005
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:14,532
That's kidnapping, right?
Am I right?

1006
01:45:14,609 --> 01:45:16,804
My wife's in the hospital.
She could've been killed.

1007
01:45:16,877 --> 01:45:20,836
- If you're not gonna do something...
- Take it easy. You don't have to shout.

1008
01:45:24,118 --> 01:45:26,313
Okay, what are you gonna do?

1009
01:45:27,521 --> 01:45:31,389
We'll tell New York to pick her up
and bring her in for questioning.

1010
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:38,724
Okay, then I'm...

1011
01:45:38,799 --> 01:45:43,498
I'm gonna go to the hospital
tomorrow, pick my wife up.

1012
01:45:43,571 --> 01:45:46,472
And hopefully...

1013
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:51,170
I'll be home for the weekend
if you need to talk to me.

1014
01:45:58,486 --> 01:46:00,078
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1015
01:46:03,858 --> 01:46:05,826
You're welcome.

1016
01:46:24,445 --> 01:46:27,073
How's that feel?
Good and warm?

1017
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:34,017
- You all cozy?
- Is Mommy gonna be all right?

1018
01:46:34,989 --> 01:46:37,514
Mommy's gonna be fine, honey.

1019
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:39,559
She's gonna be fine.

1020
01:46:39,627 --> 01:46:42,221
Are you going to stay with us?

1021
01:46:45,466 --> 01:46:47,593
I'm gonna stay with you, honey.

1022
01:46:51,072 --> 01:46:53,006
Now, you go to sleep, okay?

1023
01:46:56,444 --> 01:46:58,002
Good night, doll.

1024
01:47:00,648 --> 01:47:01,979
Forever?

1025
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:05,783
I promise, honey.

1026
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:30,743
You mean the detectives in Manhattan
have no idea where she's gone?

1027
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:32,711
They don't know where she is?

1028
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:48,451
No, I see.

1029
01:47:48,562 --> 01:47:51,292
If you get any more information,
be sure and let me know, Lieutenant.

1030
01:47:51,365 --> 01:47:53,731
Thank you very much, sir.
Good night.

1031
01:48:10,518 --> 01:48:12,887
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1032
01:48:14,088 --> 01:48:17,922
- How does the arm feel?
- It hurts.

1033
01:48:17,992 --> 01:48:20,153
I'll get you some more painkillers.

1034
01:48:44,919 --> 01:48:46,147
Thanks.

1035
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:48,552
Now, you just holler if
you need anything else, all right?

1036
01:48:48,622 --> 01:48:51,090
I'd love a cup of tea.

1037
01:48:51,959 --> 01:48:53,790
You got it.

1038
01:50:34,028 --> 01:50:36,326
What are you doing here?

1039
01:50:41,368 --> 01:50:43,836
Why are you here?

1040
01:50:48,008 --> 01:50:49,600
He tried...

1041
01:50:51,278 --> 01:50:53,940
to say good-bye to me last night.

1042
01:50:54,048 --> 01:50:57,814
But he couldn't because...

1043
01:50:57,885 --> 01:51:00,353
he and I feel
the same way about each other.

1044
01:51:03,824 --> 01:51:07,123
Do you know how it is when you
meet somebody for the first time?

1045
01:51:09,897 --> 01:51:13,196
And you get this instant attraction.

1046
01:51:22,443 --> 01:51:24,604
And don't you think
I understand what you're doing?

1047
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:27,772
You're trying to move him
into the country...

1048
01:51:27,881 --> 01:51:30,349
and you're keeping him
away from me.

1049
01:51:32,086 --> 01:51:35,522
And you're playing happy family.

1050
01:51:35,623 --> 01:51:38,057
Aren't you?

1051
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:43,328
You wouldn't understand that
because you're so selfish.

1052
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:49,363
He told me about you.
He told me about you.

1053
01:51:49,436 --> 01:51:51,700
He was very honest.

1054
01:52:04,485 --> 01:52:06,419
If you weren't so stupid,
you'd know that.

1055
01:52:06,487 --> 01:52:09,456
But you're so stupid.
You're a stupid, selfish bitch!
