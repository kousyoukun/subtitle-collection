1
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:02,308
It's hormonal.

2
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,648
I mean, I don't usually fall
back on.. It's women's issues.

3
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:11,115
But child-proofed how?
Gates and stuff?

4
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:12,510
Dude, she did the drawers.

5
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:14,827
We don't even know if this
whole fertility thing's gonna work..

6
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:17,697
she's screwed in these little jobbies
where you can't even open the drawers.

7
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:18,593
At all?

8
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:21,726
No. They open an inch,
then you gotta dig your finger in.

9
00:01:21,727 --> 00:01:24,055
- It's a nightmare.
-I guess sooner or later..

10
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:26,536
Yeah, a lot later.
She did the upper cabinets.

11
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:30,520
Kid will be 30 before he can
reach them, assuming we have a kid.

12
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,726
It is natural for
her to feel protective.

13
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:37,143
Don't even.. You have women's issues.

14
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:40,025
Please. You of all people.

15
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:41,625
Oh, come on. It's a jinx.

16
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:44,994
It guarantees that
we won't get pregnant.

17
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:48,035
And it takes me about 20
minutes to get a fucking beer.

18
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:49,392
Guys. Guys!

19
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:50,656
Stockholm went south.

20
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:53,776
Seriously?
I thought they were looking good.

21
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:54,880
What cracked?

22
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,995
I haven't seen the footage.
Word's just going around

23
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:00,103
Well, that's never
been a stable scenario.

24
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:02,187
Everyone knows you can't trust Swedes.

25
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,924
That means there's just Japan.
Japan and us.

26
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,690
It's not the first time
it's come down to that.

27
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,535
Japan has a perfect record.

28
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:10,024
We're number two. We try harder.

29
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:11,604
If we fail, then..

30
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:13,359
Please. We haven't
had a glitch since '98.

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,795
We know what we're doing, Lin.

32
00:02:14,796 --> 00:02:17,285
Or we have it written down..
somewhere.

33
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:19,085
You guys better not
be messing around in there.

34
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:22,391
Does this mean you're not in
the betting pool this year? Big money.

35
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,494
I'm just saying, it's a key scenario.

36
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:27,075
No, I hear what you're saying.

37
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:30,291
In '98, it was the chem
department's fault, right?

38
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:33,708
Where do you work, again?
Wait. It's coming back to me, now.

39
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:38,296
It's gonna be a long weekend
if everyone's that puckered up.

40
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:41,130
You wanna come over Monday night?

41
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:44,843
I'm gonna pick up some power drills.
Liberate my cabinets.

42
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,676
Are you even listening to me?

43
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,241
Professor fuckwad.

44
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:38,149
Why haven't you stuck that asshole's
picture on the dartboard yet?

45
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,227
It's not that simple
Oh, my God!

46
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:43,893
Your hair. It's blonde.
- Very fabulous, no?

47
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:46,729
I can't believe you did it.
-But very fabulous, right?

48
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,489
Hurry up with the "very fabulous."
I'm getting insecure about it now.

49
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,234
No, it looks awesome.
Curt's gonna lose it.

50
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:56,193
Curt's gonna thank me.
And so will you..

51
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,155
while we're burning this picture.

52
00:03:58,156 --> 00:03:59,341
Not ready.

53
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:02,164
Seriously, this isn't his fault.

54
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:04,513
What's not his fault?

55
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:07,949
Fucking his student or
breaking up with her by email?

56
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,916
I knew what I was getting into.

57
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:10,627
Oh, please.

58
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:12,443
You know what you're
getting into this weekend?

59
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:15,626
This.

60
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:18,404
And if Holden's as
cute as Curt says he is..

61
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:20,091
possibly getting out of it.

62
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:22,311
That is the last thing that I want.

63
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:24,951
If you treat this like a setup,
I'm gonna have no fun at all.

64
00:04:24,952 --> 00:04:26,096
I'm not pushing..

65
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:28,438
but we're packing this!

66
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:32,432
Which means we definitely
won't have room for..

67
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:34,047
What if I get bored?

68
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:35,432
These will help?

69
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:39,795
Soviet Economic Structures?
Aftermath of the..

70
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:43,877
No! We have a lake and a keg.

71
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:45,657
No more learning!
-Think fast.

72
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:47,274
Faster than that.

73
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:51,601
Sorry. Sorry. Move along.

74
00:04:51,602 --> 00:04:54,415
Nice!
-Is that Holden?

75
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,221
We'll be right down.
He just transferred from State.

76
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:59,927
Best hands on the team.
He's a sweet guy.

77
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:01,439
And he's good with his hands.

78
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,987
I'm kinda seeing this girl..

79
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,408
but you're way blonder than she is.

80
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:10,220
But I was thinking, you know, maybe..
What is this?

81
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:12,501
What.. this?
What are you doing with these?

82
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:13,950
Okay, I get it. I'll leave the books.

83
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:16,208
No, who gave you these?
Who taught you about these?

84
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,080
I learned it from you, okay?

85
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:20,408
I learned it from watching you!

86
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:25,805
Seriously, Professor Bennett, he
covers this whole book in his lectures.

87
00:05:26,737 --> 00:05:29,868
You should read this.

88
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:32,372
Gurovsky. Now this is way
more interesting.

89
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,098
Also, Bennett doesn't
know it by heart..

90
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:35,767
so he'll think you're insightful.

91
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,685
And you have no pants.

92
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:40,930
Oh, shit!

93
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:47,913
- That pretty much it?
-Fucking better be.

94
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,777
You know, Jules,
it's a weekend, not an evacuation.

95
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:54,041
Trust me when I say there
is nothing in those cases..

96
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:55,385
you won't be glad I brought.

97
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:57,318
I'm shutting' right up.

98
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:03,116
Oh, my God.

99
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:08,071
Marty!

100
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:12,669
Fuck is wrong with you, bro?

101
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:20,332
People in this town drive
in a very counterintuitive manner.

102
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,123
That's what I have to say.

103
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:25,528
Do you wanna spend
the weekend in jail?

104
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,872
We'd all like to check
out my cousin's country home.

105
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:29,498
Honey, that's not okay.

106
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:31,101
Statistical fact..

107
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:35,223
Cops will never pull over
a man with a huge bong in his car.

108
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:35,836
Why?

109
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:39,799
They fear this man.
They know he sees further than they..

110
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:44,452
and he will bind them
with ancient logics.

111
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:47,630
Have you gone gray?

112
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:49,979
You're not bringing
that thing in the Rambler.

113
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,281
What?

114
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:54,312
A giant bong in your father's van?

115
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:57,434
What are you, stoned?

116
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:00,301
Hey, man.

117
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:05,333
Dana, you fetching minx!

118
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:06,964
You have any food?

119
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:10,110
Everybody ready?
- Yeah!

120
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:13,385
Yeah?
- Okay, I'm ready!

121
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:15,780
Let's get this show on the road!

122
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:36,475
Nest is empty. We're right on time.

123
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,153
I hope this is the right road.

124
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:43,585
It doesn't even show up on the GPS.

125
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:45,621
It is unworthy of global positioning.

126
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:49,531
That's the whole point.
Get off the grid, right?

127
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:51,875
No cell phone reception..

128
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:54,165
no traffic cameras.

129
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,466
Go someplace for one goddamn
weekend where they can't..

130
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:00,061
globally position my ass, man.

131
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,548
This is the whole issue.

132
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,308
Is society crumbling, Marty?

133
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:06,971
No. Society is binding. Right?

134
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:10,261
It's filling in the
cracks with concrete.

135
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:14,861
Everything's filed or
recorded or blogged, right?

136
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:18,275
Chips in our kids' heads
so they won't get lost.

137
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:20,437
Society needs to crumble.

138
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:23,358
We're all just too
chicken-shit to let it.

139
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:25,048
I've missed your rants.

140
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:28,226
You will come to see things my way.

141
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,155
Identification, please.

142
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:39,508
Mr. Sitterson.

143
00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:42,533
Mr. Hadley.
- Thank you.

144
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,711
What's your name?
- Daniel Truman, sir.

145
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:47,026
This isn't the military.
You can drop the "sir".

146
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,783
But Sitterson does
like to be called "ma'am."

147
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:53,430
Or "honey toes."
- He'll also answer to "honey toes."

148
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:54,700
You clear on what's
gonna be happening here?

149
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,194
I've been prepped. Extensively.

150
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:59,333
Did they tell you that being prepped
is not the same as being prepared?

151
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:01,934
They told me.
I'll hold my post, Mr. Hadley.

152
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:02,684
Good man.

153
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:06,113
Okay. System's online.

154
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:09,895
Acquiring target.
Let's see what we got.

155
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:48,220
I'm thinking this thing
doesn't take credit cards.

156
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:52,056
I don't think it knows about money.

157
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,459
I think it's barter gas.

158
00:10:15,752 --> 00:10:16,984
Hello?

159
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:27,091
Hey, Holden.

160
00:10:28,403 --> 00:10:31,794
Holden!
- I don't think there's gonna be..

161
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:34,111
You come here uninvited?
- Fuck!

162
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:41,699
Sign says "closed."

163
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,409
Yeah, we were looking to buy some gas.

164
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,785
Does this pump work?

165
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:48,388
If you know how to work it.

166
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,812
We also wanted to get directions.

167
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:54,044
We're looking for.. What's it called?

168
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:56,620
Tillerman Road.
Do you know if it's this way?

169
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:03,105
Tillerman Road takes
you up the hill, there.

170
00:11:03,106 --> 00:11:05,148
Dead-ends at the old Buckner place.

171
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:07,181
My cousin bought a house up there.

172
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:09,306
You go through a mountain tunnel,
there's a lake.

173
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:11,613
Would that be the..
- Buckner place.

174
00:11:11,614 --> 00:11:14,776
Always someone looking
to sell that plot.

175
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:16,666
You knew the original owners.

176
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:19,156
Yeah, not the first.

177
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:24,490
I seen plenty come and go.
Hell, I been here since the war.

178
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:27,035
- Which war?
- You know damn well which war!

179
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:32,741
Would that have been with
the blue and some in gray?

180
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:37,143
Brother, perhaps,
fighting against brother in that war?

181
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:38,236
You sassing me, boy?

182
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:39,864
You were rude to my friend.

183
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,557
That whore?

184
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:46,071
What'd you say?
-I think we got enough gas.

185
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,320
You got enough to get you there.

186
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:49,331
Getting back..

187
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,352
that's your concern.

188
00:12:04,452 --> 00:12:07,266
Well, good luck with
your business, sir.

189
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:10,360
I know the railroad's coming
through here any day, now.

190
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,363
That's gonna be big.

191
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,775
Streets paved with actual street.

192
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,885
Fucker.

193
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:34,871
This must be it.

194
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,367
Oh, my God. It's.. beautiful.

195
00:13:51,368 --> 00:13:54,641
One spider and I'm
sleeping in the Rambler.

196
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:56,180
I mean it.

197
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:58,824
Come on. Give me a hand.

198
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:57,465
This is awesome.

199
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:58,986
It is kind of cool.

200
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:01,278
You gonna kill us a raccoon to eat?

201
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,914
I will use its skin to make a cap.

202
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,718
Everybody get your suits on. In
10 minutes, we're heading to the lake.

203
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:09,702
Yeah.

204
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:12,744
I was not informed there
would be calisthenics.

205
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,609
Yeah, I don't think so.

206
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:43,486
Whoa.

207
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,326
No way.

208
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:09,237
Ah, shit.

209
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:15,084
This is happening.

210
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:26,137
Hold up!

211
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:31,134
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

212
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:32,732
That's just creepy.

213
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:35,265
It was pioneer days.

214
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:38,266
People had to make their
own interrogation rooms.

215
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,919
Who did your cousin
buy this place from?

216
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,630
We should check the rest of the rooms,
make sure this is the only one.

217
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:44,986
'Cause you know Marty wants
to watch us pounding away.

218
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:47,826
I didn't even like hearing that.

219
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,944
How about we switch?

220
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,144
Not that I'd..

221
00:16:57,145 --> 00:17:00,380
I mean, I'd put the picture back but you
might feel better if we switched rooms?

222
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:02,830
I really would.

223
00:17:05,637 --> 00:17:08,774
Thanks. For being decent.

224
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:09,840
It's the least I could do..

225
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:12,215
since Curt and Jules
sold you to me for marriage.

226
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:14,761
They're not subtle.

227
00:17:14,762 --> 00:17:17,523
Well, I'll just be flattered
and keep it to myself.

228
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:19,968
Yeah, I'm not looking for..

229
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:22,349
But, I'm still grateful
that you're not a creep.

230
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,018
Hey, let's not jump
to any conclusions there.

231
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:27,646
I had kind of an internal
debate about showing you the mirror.

232
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,495
Shouting on both sides.
Blood was spilled.

233
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:32,447
So, you're bleeding internally?

234
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:33,977
Pretty bad.

235
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:38,403
Well, Jules is pre-med.
You should probably talk to her.

236
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:42,148
Okay.

237
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:10,582
Wow.

238
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:33,596
Yeah, I don't think so.

239
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,607
Places everyone.

240
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:06,126
We are live.

241
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:07,474
Engineering, we got a room change.

242
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:10,134
Polk is now in two, McCrea is in four.

243
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:13,722
Operations, do you copy?
We need a scenario adjustment.

244
00:19:13,723 --> 00:19:14,977
Miss Lin.

245
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:21,180
We've got the blood work
back on Louden. Her levels are good.

246
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:23,477
But we're recommending
a fifty-milligram bump..

247
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:25,382
of Rhohyptase to increase libido.

248
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:28,077
- Sold. - Do we pipe it in,
or do you wanna do it orally?

249
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:30,712
Ask me that again, only slower.

250
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:31,582
You're a pig.

251
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,567
Guess how we're
slowing down cognition.

252
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:35,362
I don't know.

253
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:38,880
The hair dye.

254
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:40,636
Dumb blonde. Very artistic.

255
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:45,039
Works its way into the blood,
through the scalp. Very gradual.

256
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,345
Chem department keeps their end up.

257
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:50,064
I'll see it when I believe it.

258
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,677
Control?
- Yeah, go ahead.

259
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:53,981
I have the harbinger on line two.

260
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:57,375
Oh, Christ. Can you take a message?

261
00:19:57,376 --> 00:20:01,094
I don't think so. He's really pushy.

262
00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:05,016
To be honest,
he's kind of freaking me out.

263
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:06,772
Okay. Put him on.

264
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:10,483
Mordecai, baby, what's happening?
How's the weather up top?

265
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:14,878
The lambs have passed through the gate.
They are come to the killing floor.

266
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:17,159
Well, you're doing
a great job out there.

267
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,428
By the numbers, man.
You got us started off just right.

268
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,149
So, we'll talk to you later, okay?

269
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,589
Their blind eyes see nothing
of the horrors to come.

270
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,657
Their ears are stopped.

271
00:20:27,658 --> 00:20:29,831
They are the gods' fools.

272
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:33,065
Well, that's.. how it works.

273
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:37,015
Cleanse them. Cleanse the
world of their ignorance and sin.

274
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:39,608
Bathe them in the crimson of..

275
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:41,805
Am I on speakerphone?

276
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:45,221
No. Absolutely not.

277
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:47,206
Speakerphone, no.
No, I wouldn't do that.

278
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:49,329
Yes, I am. I can hear the echo.

279
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,895
Oh, my God. You're right.
Hang on one second, I'll take you off.

280
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:55,736
That's rude.
I don't know who's in the room.

281
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:58,723
Fine. There. You're off.

282
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,873
Thank you.

283
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:02,092
Don't take this lightly, boy.

284
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:04,889
It wasn't all by your numbers.

285
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,595
The fool nearly derailed
the invocation with his insolence.

286
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:12,359
The ancient ones see everything.

287
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,873
And they will not be..

288
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:16,573
I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I?

289
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:20,790
Oh, my God. Mordecai.

290
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,552
I can't believe it. I did it again!

291
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:24,799
Mordy?

292
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,560
What happens next?

293
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:36,812
Oh! That's cold!

294
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:41,274
How cold? Is it worth it?

295
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:43,917
Come on, Jules. Life is risk.

296
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:47,159
Yeah, I might just risk
lying out in the sun for a while.

297
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,443
Boo.

298
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:50,523
Hey, what is that?
- What?

299
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:51,960
In the lake, right there.

300
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:53,995
Oh, come on. - No you guys,
I'm serious. Right there.

301
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:56,814
There! There!
God, looks just like my girlfriend!

302
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:00,719
Oh, my God!

303
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,433
There's something else in the lake!

304
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:07,164
It's a gorgeous man!
- I'm gonna kill you!

305
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:09,617
Don't kill the gorgeous man!
We're endangered!

306
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,042
All right. Last chance.

307
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:22,907
It's post time. Dig deep, people.
Betting windows are closing. Okay.

308
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:23,792
Okay, who's still out?

309
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:28,257
Let's see. We got engineering,
we got R & D, and we got electrical.

310
00:22:28,258 --> 00:22:29,807
Did you see who they picked?

311
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,176
They're practically
giving their money away.

312
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:33,218
You should talk, Aquaman.

313
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,476
What do you mean?
- Ah, nothing.

314
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:37,769
Okay, all right.

315
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,152
I'm not even sure
we have one of these.

316
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:41,425
Zoology swears we do.

317
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,507
They'd know. Okay. All right, people.

318
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:45,663
Hey, what do you got?

319
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,933
No, they've already been picked.

320
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,785
What? No. Who took them?

321
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:50,800
Maintenance.

322
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:52,790
Maintenance?
They pick the same thing every year.

323
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:53,856
What do you want from me?

324
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:55,462
If they were creative,
they wouldn't be in maintenance.

325
00:22:55,463 --> 00:22:57,587
You're gonna have to split
this if you win. You wanna switch?

326
00:22:57,588 --> 00:23:02,287
I don't know, I don't know.
What do you think?

327
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:05,279
More than anything,
I just want this moment to end.

328
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:10,889
Not betting?

329
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,191
Not for me. Thanks.

330
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,526
Seems a little harsh, doesn't it?

331
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,053
It's just people letting off steam.

332
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:23,190
This job isn't easy,
however those clowns may behave.

333
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:27,645
Does the director.
Do they know about this downstairs?

334
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:29,019
The director doesn't
care about this stuff.

335
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,799
As long as everything
goes smoothly upstairs..

336
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,744
as long as the kids
do as they're told.

337
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,128
But then it's fixed.

338
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:35,838
No, no, no.

339
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,091
How can you wager on this
when you control the outcome?

340
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:41,862
No, we just get 'em in the cellar.
They take it from there.

341
00:23:41,863 --> 00:23:44,063
No, they have to make the
choice of their own free will.

342
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:45,964
Otherwise the system doesn't work.

343
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:47,925
It's like the harbinger.

344
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:52,628
It's this creepy old fuck, practically
wears a sign, "You will die."

345
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:54,638
Why do we put him there? The system.

346
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:57,158
They have to choose to ignore him..

347
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:59,506
and they have to choose
what happens in the cellar.

348
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:01,514
Yeah, we rig the game
as much as we need to..

349
00:24:01,515 --> 00:24:03,684
but in the end,
they don't transgress..

350
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:04,985
hey can't be punished.

351
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:08,679
So what's it gonna be, Truman?
You in? Window's closing.

352
00:24:11,514 --> 00:24:12,600
I'm fine.

353
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:15,844
Okay.

354
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,339
That's it, gang!

355
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,937
The board is locked!

356
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:21,325
Oh, let's get this party started!

357
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,823
Let's get this party started!

358
00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:36,164
There you go.

359
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:38,189
Okay, my turn.

360
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,343
Jules.

361
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:44,120
Truth or dare?

362
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:45,310
Let's go dare.

363
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:46,634
All right.

364
00:24:46,635 --> 00:24:50,540
I dare you to make out with..

365
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:52,444
Please say "Dana," please say "Dana."

366
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:54,211
That moose, over there.

367
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:57,311
Marty..

368
00:24:57,312 --> 00:25:00,062
have you ever seen a moose before?

369
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,344
Whatever that mysterious beast is.

370
00:25:04,345 --> 00:25:05,915
That's a wolf.

371
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:10,034
I'm living in a womb of reefer,
leave me alone.

372
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,118
Jules..

373
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,005
I dare you to make out with that wolf.

374
00:25:16,158 --> 00:25:17,261
No problem.

375
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:43,527
Who?

376
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:45,499
Me?

377
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:48,191
Well, yes, I am new in town.

378
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:50,212
How did you know?

379
00:25:50,213 --> 00:25:54,466
Oh, my God.
That is so sweet of you to say.

380
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:56,430
I just colored it, in fact.

381
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:57,832
No, no, no.

382
00:25:57,833 --> 00:26:00,229
There's no need to huff and puff.

383
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,427
I'll let you come in.

384
00:26:37,527 --> 00:26:40,043
Thank you.

385
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:44,699
Yeah.

386
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,201
Now,...

387
00:26:53,202 --> 00:26:54,250
Dana.

388
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:55,232
Truth.

389
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:58,082
What's that supposed to mean?

390
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,621
I'm just skipping ahead.

391
00:26:59,622 --> 00:27:01,743
You're gonna say dare.

392
00:27:01,744 --> 00:27:03,495
She's gonna dare you to
do something you don't like..

393
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:07,756
and then you'll puss out and
say that you wanted truth all along.

394
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:09,324
Really?

395
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:12,481
Okay, Jules.

396
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:14,351
Dare.

397
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:16,619
What the hell was that?

398
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:18,669
It's the cellar door.

399
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:21,793
The wind must've blown it open.

400
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:24,735
That makes what kinda sense?

401
00:27:24,736 --> 00:27:26,472
What do you think is down there?

402
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:32,337
Why don't we find out?

403
00:27:34,843 --> 00:27:35,976
Dana.

404
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,727
I dare you.

405
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:57,483
How long do I have to stay down here?

406
00:27:57,484 --> 00:27:59,687
Oh, you know, just 'til morning.

407
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:36,007
Dana.

408
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:39,271
You okay?

409
00:28:39,272 --> 00:28:40,709
Yeah.

410
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,218
Sorry, I just scared myself.

411
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:47,623
Well, you called for help.
That voids the dare.

412
00:28:47,624 --> 00:28:49,360
Take your top off.

413
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:50,830
What?

414
00:28:50,831 --> 00:28:52,658
I don't make up the rules.

415
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:56,129
Oh, my God.

416
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,224
Look at all this.

417
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,393
Guys..

418
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:11,178
I'm not sure it's
awesome to be down here.

419
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:13,171
Guys?

420
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:18,148
Dude, seriously,
your cousin is into some weird shit.

421
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:20,892
I'm pretty sure this ain't his.

422
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:24,821
Maybe it was the people
who put in that mirror thing.

423
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,053
Some of this stuff looks really old.

424
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:33,005
It's beautiful.

425
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,616
Maybe we should go back upstairs.

426
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:46,310
I dare you all to go upstairs.

427
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:41,502
Guys?

428
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:44,708
Guys, listen to this.

429
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,262
"April fourth.

430
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:51,520
"Father was cross with me
and said I lacked the true faith.

431
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:54,482
"I wish I could prove my devotion..

432
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:57,038
"as Judah and Matthew
proved on those travelers."

433
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,017
What is that?

434
00:30:58,018 --> 00:31:04,403
Diary of Anna Patience Buckner, 1903.

435
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,976
"Mama screamed most of the night.

436
00:31:07,977 --> 00:31:10,601
"I prayed that she might find faith..

437
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,521
"but she only stopped
when Papa cut her belly..

438
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:15,019
"and stuffed the coals in.

439
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,428
"Judah told me in my dream..

440
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:21,600
"that Matthew took him to the
black room, so I know he is killed.

441
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:26,753
"I want to understand the
glory of the pain like Matthew..

442
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:33,023
"but cutting the flesh makes
him have a husband's bulge..

443
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,890
"and I do not get like that."

444
00:31:34,891 --> 00:31:37,498
- Jesus. Can we not?
- No. Go on.

445
00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:38,848
- Why?
-I want to know.

446
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:40,466
"I have found it..

447
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:44,984
"in the oldest books,
the way of saving our family.

448
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:47,848
"My good arm is hacked up..

449
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:51,064
"and et,
so I hope this will be readable.

450
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:55,709
"That a believer will come
and speak this to our spirits.

451
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,615
"Then we will be restored
and the great pain will return."

452
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:04,046
And then there's something in Latin.

453
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:07,618
Okay, I'm drawing a line
in the fucking sand, here.

454
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:09,081
Do not read the Latin.

455
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,051
What the fuck?

456
00:32:13,052 --> 00:32:16,154
- Dolor..
- No, no.

457
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:18,487
- Stop being a fucking baby.
- Curt!

458
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:19,398
It's a diary.

459
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:21,410
It doesn't even mean anything.

460
00:32:21,411 --> 00:32:25,227
- Dana!
- "Dolor supervivo caro.

461
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:29,927
"Dolor sublimis caro.

462
00:32:29,928 --> 00:32:34,553
"Dolor ignio annivos."

463
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:06,632
We have a winner!

464
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:09,084
It's the Buckners,
ladies and gentlemen!

465
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:11,659
The Buckners pull a 'W'.

466
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:18,105
All right. That means that
congratulations go to Maintenance!

467
00:33:18,106 --> 00:33:21,912
Who share the pot
with Ronald the intern.

468
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:22,789
Yeah!

469
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,790
That's not fair. I had zombies, too.

470
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,872
Yes, you did. You had zombies.

471
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:30,298
But this is
"Zombie Redneck Torture Family," see?

472
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,233
They're entirely separate species.

473
00:33:32,234 --> 00:33:35,052
Like the difference between
an elephant and an elephant seal.

474
00:33:35,053 --> 00:33:37,741
There's always next year.

475
00:33:38,534 --> 00:33:41,158
They're like something
from a nightmare.

476
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,266
No. They're something
nightmares are from.

477
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:49,465
Everything in our stable
is remnant of the old world..

You get used to it.

482
00:34:00,262 --> 00:34:01,476
Should you?

483
00:34:11,455 --> 00:34:13,149
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

484
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,269
- He had the conch in his hands.
- I know.

485
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,304
A couple more minutes,
who knows what might've happened?

486
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,556
I am never gonna see a merman. Ever.

487
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:21,838
Dude, be thankful.

488
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,426
Those things are terrifying.

489
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:25,898
And the cleanup on
them is a nightmare.

490
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:30,616
So, the Buckners.

491
00:34:30,617 --> 00:34:34,418
Yeah, well, they may be zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots..

492
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:37,933
But they're our zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots.

493
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:40,130
With a hundred percent clearance rate.

494
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:41,855
True. So should we call Japan?

495
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,778
Tell them to take the
rest of the weekend off?

496
00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:47,719
Yeah, right. They're Japanese.
What are they gonna do? Relax?

497
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,239
I'd just like to see them
fall on their asses, for once.

498
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,268
Oh, God, don't even joke.

499
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:53,111
Every other branch has air-balled.

500
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:57,230
We need the Japanese crew to get it
done. There's too much riding on this.

501
00:35:39,244 --> 00:35:40,591
Fuck, yeah, baby.

502
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:42,984
This is so classy.

503
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:45,259
Come on, like you wouldn't
want a piece of that.

504
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,724
Can we not talk about people
in pieces any more tonight?

505
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:52,675
Are you feeling lonely, Marty?

506
00:35:55,004 --> 00:35:58,438
Marty and I were sweeties
in our freshman hall.

507
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:00,729
We made out once.

508
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,765
I never did buy that ring.

509
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:05,662
But we're still..

510
00:36:07,887 --> 00:36:09,296
close.

511
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,411
I have a theory about all this.

512
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:18,338
That's our cue to bail.

513
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:22,177
Tommy Chong here has a theory.
Come on, baby.

514
00:36:22,178 --> 00:36:25,874
Don't worry,
you can tell it to Egghead, here..

515
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:28,057
if he's not too busy
devirginizing Dana.

516
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:31,105
Jules, do you wanna go lie down?

517
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:34,750
That's exactly the point.
Come on. Mush. Mush.

518
00:36:34,751 --> 00:36:35,800
Don't push me around.

519
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:37,213
Not around, baby. Straight line.

520
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:01,836
You seriously believe
nothing weird is going on?

521
00:37:03,148 --> 00:37:04,162
Conspiracy?

522
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:07,088
The way everybody's acting.

523
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:10,447
Why is Jules suddenly a celebu-tard?

524
00:37:10,448 --> 00:37:15,024
And since when does Curt
pull this alpha-male bullshit?

525
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:18,223
I mean, he's a sociology major.

526
00:37:18,224 --> 00:37:20,392
He's on full academic scholarship..

527
00:37:20,393 --> 00:37:23,203
and now he's calling
his friend an egghead?

528
00:37:23,204 --> 00:37:24,969
Curt's just drunk.

529
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,237
I've seen Curt drunk.

530
00:37:28,335 --> 00:37:30,061
Jules, too.

531
00:37:30,062 --> 00:37:32,190
Well, then, maybe it's something else.

532
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,234
You're not seeing
what you don't wanna see.

533
00:37:39,515 --> 00:37:41,368
Puppeteers.

534
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:43,550
Puppeteers?

535
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:44,722
Pop-Tarts?

536
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:46,158
Did you say you have Pop-Tarts?

537
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:49,971
Marty, I love you,
but you're really high.

538
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:55,688
We are not who we are.

539
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,476
I'm gonna go read
a book with pictures.

540
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:06,798
Thank you.
- "The pain outlives the flesh.

541
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:10,949
"The flesh returns.. "
or "has a meeting place."

542
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:12,094
What is that?

543
00:38:12,095 --> 00:38:15,013
The Latin that you
read in the basement.

544
00:38:15,014 --> 00:38:15,772
You speak Latin?

545
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:19,959
Not well. Not since tenth grade.

546
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,442
Weird how it all comes back.

547
00:38:22,443 --> 00:38:25,030
Well, it's a weird kind of night.

548
00:38:26,463 --> 00:38:27,930
I'm sorry about tonight.

549
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,624
Everybody..

550
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:33,579
Do I lose points if I tell
you I'm having a pretty nice time?

551
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,602
No. You can tell me that.

552
00:38:44,483 --> 00:38:46,465
What are you running away for?

553
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:55,214
Don't spill on me!

554
00:38:55,215 --> 00:38:56,741
Did I get a little beer on your shirt?

555
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:01,030
I guess it'll have to come off, huh?

556
00:39:02,545 --> 00:39:04,742
Not here.

557
00:39:06,337 --> 00:39:07,238
Baby, come on.

558
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:09,227
We're all alone.

559
00:39:19,948 --> 00:39:20,886
I'm chilly.

560
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:26,095
Okay, guys. That's it.
Let's go. We've got a job to do.

561
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:29,003
Your basic human needs disgust me.
Get out of here.

562
00:39:29,004 --> 00:39:31,395
- Do we have temperature
control in this sector? - On it.

563
00:39:34,882 --> 00:39:39,311
Engaging pheromone mists.

564
00:40:05,977 --> 00:40:07,554
It's so dark.

565
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:08,979
Take me inside?

566
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,627
Come on. This is why we came here.

567
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:14,352
It's romantic.

568
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,870
Okay, baby. Let's see some boobies.

569
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:37,724
Show us the goods.

570
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:41,524
Does it really matter if we see her..

571
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:42,554
We're not the only ones watching, kid.

572
00:40:42,555 --> 00:40:44,771
Gotta keep the customer satisfied.

573
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,969
You understand what's at stake, here?

574
00:41:32,725 --> 00:41:33,784
Score.

575
00:42:06,575 --> 00:42:07,831
Jules!

576
00:43:24,445 --> 00:43:26,455
This we offer in humility and fear.

577
00:43:27,694 --> 00:43:30,250
For the blessed peace
of your eternal slumber.

578
00:43:30,251 --> 00:43:32,467
As it ever was.

579
00:43:32,468 --> 00:43:33,586
As it ever was.

580
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:28,478
Nemo, man, you gotta wake up.
Your shit is topsy-turvy.

581
00:44:31,661 --> 00:44:33,400
I'm gonna go for a walk.

582
00:44:33,401 --> 00:44:36,876
Okay. I swear to fucking God,
somebody is talking.

583
00:44:42,134 --> 00:44:44,613
Or I'm pretty sure someone is.

584
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:47,605
I'm gonna go for a walk.

585
00:44:47,606 --> 00:44:49,368
Enough!

586
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:51,255
What are you saying?

587
00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:53,686
What do you want?

588
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:58,293
You think I'm a puppet, huh?

589
00:44:58,294 --> 00:45:00,927
You think I'm a puppet.
Gonna do a little..

590
00:45:00,928 --> 00:45:03,632
fucking puppet dance!

591
00:45:03,633 --> 00:45:06,699
I'm the boss of my own brain,
so give it up.

592
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:12,825
I'm gonna go for a walk.

593
00:45:24,243 --> 00:45:25,200
I don't wanna..

594
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:26,823
I mean, I've never..

595
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:30,565
I don't mean "never"..

596
00:45:30,566 --> 00:45:31,461
Hey.

597
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,661
Nothing you don't want.

598
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:40,061
He's got a husband bulge.

599
00:45:58,844 --> 00:46:00,550
I thought there'd be stars.

600
00:46:05,214 --> 00:46:06,861
We are abandoned.

601
00:46:33,616 --> 00:46:35,074
- Fuck!
- Fucking run!

602
00:46:35,075 --> 00:46:36,015
Curt!

603
00:46:37,948 --> 00:46:39,021
Dead bitch!

604
00:46:43,397 --> 00:46:45,152
Jesus, what happened?

605
00:46:45,355 --> 00:46:46,108
The fuck!

606
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:47,535
Curt, what the fuck?

607
00:46:47,536 --> 00:46:48,679
Where are you hurt?

608
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,072
Is all of this from you?

609
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,069
It's okay! Curt, you're okay!

610
00:46:52,284 --> 00:46:53,398
Where's Jules?

611
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:58,088
She's gone.

612
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,787
We've gotta get out of here.

613
00:47:01,788 --> 00:47:04,423
No. No.

614
00:47:04,424 --> 00:47:05,367
Dana, don't open that..

615
00:47:05,368 --> 00:47:06,855
I'm not leaving here without Jules.

616
00:47:06,856 --> 00:47:08,492
That dead girl's out there!

617
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,099
Dana, come on!

618
00:47:37,975 --> 00:47:38,915
What is that thing?

619
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:40,078
Fuck!

620
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,432
I don't know,
but there's more of them.

621
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:42,465
More of them?

622
00:47:42,466 --> 00:47:44,252
I saw a young girl.

623
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:46,023
All zombied like him..

624
00:47:46,024 --> 00:47:48,046
but she was missing an arm.

625
00:47:48,047 --> 00:47:51,740
Oh, my God. Patience.

626
00:47:51,741 --> 00:47:53,648
The diary.

627
00:47:53,649 --> 00:47:56,259
- We gotta lock this place down.
-He's right.

628
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,448
We'll go room by room.
Barricade every window and door.

629
00:47:59,449 --> 00:48:03,317
We gotta play it safe. No matter what
happens, we have to stay together.

630
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:06,071
Fuck!

631
00:48:06,072 --> 00:48:07,060
Calm down.

632
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:09,340
Watch the master work.

633
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,544
This isn't right.

634
00:48:21,545 --> 00:48:23,244
What? What's the matter?

635
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:26,875
This isn't right. We should split up.

636
00:48:26,876 --> 00:48:29,809
We can cover more ground that way.

637
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,294
Yeah.

638
00:48:32,763 --> 00:48:34,267
Yeah. Good idea.

639
00:48:35,264 --> 00:48:36,653
Really?

640
00:48:38,855 --> 00:48:40,296
All right,
you guys, get in your rooms.

641
00:48:44,304 --> 00:48:45,556
Lock them in.

642
00:48:51,755 --> 00:48:54,408
What the fuck?

643
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:08,606
What the..?

644
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,108
What the fuck?

645
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:20,753
That's not good.

646
00:49:20,754 --> 00:49:22,716
Out of the way. Out of the way.
Out of the way.

647
00:49:22,717 --> 00:49:25,860
Chem department,
I need 500 CCs of Thorazine..

648
00:49:25,861 --> 00:49:27,172
pumped into room three.

649
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:28,251
No, no, no.

650
00:49:28,252 --> 00:49:29,351
Stand by, Chem.

651
00:49:29,352 --> 00:49:32,620
Judah Buckner to the rescue.

652
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:37,228
What the fuck?

653
00:49:40,112 --> 00:49:41,993
Fuck! What the fuck?

654
00:49:45,843 --> 00:49:47,799
Oh, my God.

655
00:49:48,242 --> 00:49:51,926
I'm on a reality TV show.

656
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,622
My parents are gonna
think I'm such a burnout.

657
00:50:45,878 --> 00:50:50,065
Help me! Help me!

658
00:51:16,129 --> 00:51:18,131
Must be getting excited downstairs.

659
00:51:18,595 --> 00:51:20,192
Greatest show on Earth.

660
00:51:38,023 --> 00:51:39,055
Somebody help!

661
00:51:41,373 --> 00:51:42,976
Come on!

662
00:51:53,181 --> 00:51:54,717
Use the bed!
- Come on! Come on!

663
00:52:10,073 --> 00:52:12,442
It's empty.
- Go.

664
00:52:15,071 --> 00:52:16,677
Curt?
- Unlock the door.

665
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:18,808
I can't. Get down to the basement.

666
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:38,429
This is the black room.

667
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,116
Nice.

668
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:44,267
From the diary.

669
00:52:46,335 --> 00:52:48,238
This is where he killed them.

670
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:52,254
This is where he kills us.

671
00:52:52,255 --> 00:52:54,313
No way. No.

672
00:52:54,314 --> 00:52:56,010
He's not gonna kill us

673
00:52:56,011 --> 00:52:58,112
We just gotta find a door.

674
00:52:58,113 --> 00:52:59,727
Okay?

675
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:05,063
Let's just check the walls, okay?

676
00:53:06,244 --> 00:53:07,631
Curt?

677
00:53:07,632 --> 00:53:09,535
I mean, there's gotta be..

678
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,853
You like pain?

679
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:33,452
How's that work for you?

680
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:58,913
These fucking zombies.

681
00:53:58,914 --> 00:54:01,435
Remember when you could
just throw a girl in a volcano?

682
00:54:01,436 --> 00:54:02,756
How old do you think I am?

683
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,584
Let's move! Come on! Come on! Go!

684
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:27,435
What about Marty?

685
00:54:27,436 --> 00:54:28,677
They got him.

686
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,599
The devil is defeated.

687
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,100
Now Kiko's spirit will
live in the happy frog!

688
00:55:19,248 --> 00:55:20,373
Fuck you!

689
00:55:20,374 --> 00:55:24,350
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

690
00:55:27,016 --> 00:55:29,240
- You seeing this?
- Perfect record, huh?

691
00:55:29,241 --> 00:55:32,275
The Japan crew should've
had this in the bag. They fucked us.

692
00:55:32,276 --> 00:55:33,519
How hard is it to kill nine-year-olds?

693
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,706
Zero fatality. Total wash.

694
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:39,349
You want good product,
you gotta buy American.

695
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,618
Any word from downstairs?

696
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:44,317
Downstairs doesn't care about Japan.
The director trusts us.

697
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:46,233
You just sweat the chem, Lin.

698
00:55:46,234 --> 00:55:49,093
While these morons are singing
What a Friend We Have in Shinto..

699
00:55:49,094 --> 00:55:51,157
we are bringing the pain.

700
00:55:51,158 --> 00:55:53,479
Yeah, and what the fuck's
up with this guy's pot, anyway?

701
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,408
He's supposed to be drooling
and instead he almost makes us?

702
00:55:56,409 --> 00:55:57,817
We treated the shit out of it.

703
00:55:57,818 --> 00:56:00,033
Okay, we've got the Rambler
heading toward the tunnel.

704
00:56:00,034 --> 00:56:01,905
The fool's toast anyway.

705
00:56:01,906 --> 00:56:04,849
And so are we if you
don't get this under control.

706
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:07,632
Shit.
- What? "Shit" why?

707
00:56:07,633 --> 00:56:08,776
Gotta go. Work to do.

708
00:56:08,777 --> 00:56:11,003
You guys are humanity's last hope.
If the ancients rise..

709
00:56:11,004 --> 00:56:13,824
There's no cave-in.
- What?

710
00:56:13,825 --> 00:56:15,299
The fucking tunnel's open!

711
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,118
Control to Demolition.

712
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:19,145
We're dark on the whole sector.

713
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:20,377
Try to bypass it.

714
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:22,200
- What the fuck do you think I'm doing?
-Open the door.

715
00:56:32,393 --> 00:56:35,032
Look out!
Get out of the way! Make a hole!

716
00:56:39,785 --> 00:56:41,910
What the fuck's going on?
- We don't know.

717
00:56:41,911 --> 00:56:43,500
Electrical said there
was a glitch up top.

718
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:45,718
That tunnel should've blown hours ago.
-We didn't get the order.

719
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:00,283
Hadley, what is going on?

720
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:02,237
Hadley?

721
00:57:02,238 --> 00:57:04,608
Why hasn't the tunnel blown?

722
00:57:55,835 --> 00:57:59,243
No, no. No fucking way!

723
00:58:01,631 --> 00:58:03,479
Can't believe this, man.
This ain't happening.

724
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,276
It's right there.

725
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:09,770
All right.
We got any climbing gear? Ropes?

726
00:58:09,771 --> 00:58:11,976
Yeah. In my fucking dorm room.

727
00:58:11,977 --> 00:58:13,616
We can't go back.

728
00:58:13,617 --> 00:58:15,489
There's no way across.

729
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,098
What're we gonna do? Jump?

730
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:19,134
Dude.

731
00:58:20,338 --> 00:58:21,707
What?

732
00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:29,490
Curt, are you sure about this?

733
00:58:29,491 --> 00:58:30,779
I've done bigger jumps than this.

734
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,195
You've got a smooth run..

735
00:58:32,196 --> 00:58:34,522
and maybe a five foot
differential on the other side.

736
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:36,404
But you've gotta give it everything.

737
00:58:36,405 --> 00:58:38,400
Curt.

738
00:58:41,781 --> 00:58:43,376
Look, you guys,
you stay in the Rambler.

739
00:58:43,377 --> 00:58:44,656
I'll get help.

740
00:58:44,657 --> 00:58:47,908
If I wipe out,
I'll fucking limp for help.

741
00:58:47,909 --> 00:58:50,089
But I'm coming back here.

742
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:53,396
I'm coming back with
cops and choppers..

743
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:56,873
and large fucking guns,
and those things are gonna pay.

744
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,196
For Jules.

745
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:10,645
Don't hold back.

746
00:59:10,646 --> 00:59:13,685
Never do.

747
00:59:38,927 --> 00:59:40,571
No!

748
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:43,609
Curt!

749
00:59:43,915 --> 00:59:44,823
Oh, God!

750
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:55,903
He hit something.
There's nothing. What'd he hit?

751
00:59:58,146 --> 00:59:59,335
Puppeteers.

752
01:00:00,813 --> 01:00:03,285
Marty was right.

753
01:00:03,286 --> 01:00:05,144
Get in the van.

754
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:08,657
Dana.

755
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:16,052
Marty was right.

756
01:00:35,092 --> 01:00:36,345
You're going back.

757
01:00:36,346 --> 01:00:38,064
I'm going through.

758
01:00:38,065 --> 01:00:41,593
And we'll just drive.
There's gotta be another road.

759
01:00:41,594 --> 01:00:43,172
Another way out of here.
-It won't work.

760
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,710
Something will happen.
It will collapse, it will wash away.

761
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:50,605
Then we just leave
the roads altogether.

762
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:55,587
Drive as far as we can into the
forest and we go on foot from there.

763
01:00:57,164 --> 01:00:59,262
You're missing the point.

764
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:03,911
Please, do not go nuts on me,
okay, Dana? You're all I've got, now.

765
01:01:07,641 --> 01:01:09,346
I'm okay.

766
01:01:09,347 --> 01:01:11,227
Good, okay, 'cause I need you calm.

767
01:01:11,228 --> 01:01:12,228
Okay, no matter what happens,
we gotta stay..

768
01:02:12,532 --> 01:02:14,508
Goddamn, that was close!

769
01:02:14,509 --> 01:02:16,310
Yeah, photo-fucking-finish.

770
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:17,593
I don't understand.

771
01:02:17,594 --> 01:02:19,340
You're celebrating?

772
01:02:19,341 --> 01:02:22,299
They're celebrating. I'm drinking.

773
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,090
But she's still alive.

774
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:26,035
How can the ritual be complete?

775
01:02:26,036 --> 01:02:28,566
The virgin's death is optional,
as long as it's last.

776
01:02:28,567 --> 01:02:31,479
Main thing is that she suffers.

777
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,983
That she did.

778
01:02:34,453 --> 01:02:36,502
It's so strange.

779
01:02:37,991 --> 01:02:39,840
I'm actually rooting for this girl.

780
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:42,013
She's got so much heart.

781
01:02:42,014 --> 01:02:45,776
And you think of
all the pain and the..

782
01:02:45,777 --> 01:02:50,505
Tequila is my lady! My lady!

783
01:02:50,506 --> 01:02:53,176
Come on in, guys!
Come on in. You're welcome.

784
01:02:53,177 --> 01:02:56,751
Tequila!
From darkness, there is light!

785
01:04:04,062 --> 01:04:05,900
I wish that I could do what you do.

786
01:04:05,901 --> 01:04:08,139
Oh, my God.
-Yeah, it's masterful.

787
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,621
I don't know.
Tonight was solid. I don't know.

788
01:04:11,622 --> 01:04:14,658
Are you kidding? Classic denouement.
When the van hits the lake..

789
01:04:14,659 --> 01:04:15,529
I screamed.

790
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:18,077
And the water rushing in,
and the zombies..

791
01:04:18,078 --> 01:04:20,570
just think it would've
been cooler with a merman.

792
01:04:20,571 --> 01:04:23,143
Do you know if we get
the overtime bonus on this one?

793
01:04:23,144 --> 01:04:25,648
Accounting's over there. Ask them.

794
01:04:25,649 --> 01:04:28,186
I don't need to.
I already know the answer.

795
01:04:28,187 --> 01:04:29,209
I'm an intern.

796
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:33,888
So I don't qualify for OT.

797
01:04:33,889 --> 01:04:36,111
It's funny that you like the ballet..

798
01:04:36,112 --> 01:04:40,776
because I happen to have
two tickets to your favorite..

799
01:04:42,946 --> 01:04:44,701
You knuckleheads.

800
01:04:44,703 --> 01:04:46,989
You almost gave me a
heart attack with that tunnel.

801
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:49,715
Like I said, it wasn't our fault.
We didn't get the order.

802
01:04:49,716 --> 01:04:51,911
I'm just giving you a hard time.

803
01:04:51,912 --> 01:04:55,122
Come on. Give us a hug.

804
01:04:55,123 --> 01:04:57,294
No, seriously. That wasn't our fault.

805
01:04:57,295 --> 01:05:00,087
There was a glitch.
Power re-route from upstairs.

806
01:05:01,489 --> 01:05:03,697
What do you mean, upstairs?

807
01:05:14,879 --> 01:05:18,173
Turn the fucking music off.

808
01:05:33,044 --> 01:05:34,093
Hello?

809
01:05:34,094 --> 01:05:37,163
That's impossible. Everything
was done within the guidelines.

810
01:05:37,164 --> 01:05:38,816
The virgin's the only one..

811
01:05:38,817 --> 01:05:42,231
No. I am not doubting you.

812
01:05:45,544 --> 01:05:46,573
Which one?

813
01:06:28,713 --> 01:06:30,294
Marty.
-Hi.

814
01:06:36,788 --> 01:06:38,070
Dana, come on.

815
01:07:03,643 --> 01:07:04,994
Marty. Wait.

816
01:07:04,995 --> 01:07:06,401
We're going in the grave?

817
01:07:07,783 --> 01:07:10,819
Dana, come on!

818
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:28,270
What is this place?

819
01:07:31,645 --> 01:07:37,528
Yeah. I had to dismember
that guy with a trowel.

820
01:07:40,616 --> 01:07:42,102
What have you been up to?

821
01:07:46,651 --> 01:07:48,680
Nobody else, huh?

822
01:07:54,961 --> 01:07:56,676
Yeah, I figured.

823
01:07:58,231 --> 01:08:00,316
You figured everything.

824
01:08:00,317 --> 01:08:02,028
Oh, not at all.

825
01:08:02,029 --> 01:08:05,518
But, I do know some stuff.

826
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:07,148
As in..

827
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:14,354
It's an elevator.

828
01:08:14,355 --> 01:08:18,524
Somebody sent those dead
fucks up here to get us.

829
01:08:18,525 --> 01:08:23,815
Now, there's no controls inside, but
there's maintenance overrides in there.

830
01:08:23,816 --> 01:08:26,329
And I think I can get it to go down.

831
01:08:27,591 --> 01:08:29,277
Do we wanna go down?

832
01:08:32,009 --> 01:08:33,794
Where else are we gonna go?

833
01:08:37,184 --> 01:08:41,016
Come on. Get in.

834
01:08:53,758 --> 01:08:54,494
Come on!

835
01:08:54,856 --> 01:08:56,458
Fucking zombie arm.

836
01:08:56,696 --> 01:08:58,218
Oh, shit.

837
01:11:06,999 --> 01:11:09,132
We chose.

838
01:11:09,097 --> 01:11:11,735
What? What?

839
01:11:11,736 --> 01:11:12,593
Fuck!

840
01:11:20,783 --> 01:11:26,425
All that shit we were playing with.

841
01:11:26,426 --> 01:11:28,533
They made us choose.

842
01:11:29,822 --> 01:11:32,755
They made us choose how we die.

843
01:12:11,774 --> 01:12:14,160
We saw them go down the access drop.
They have to be in one of these.

844
01:12:14,161 --> 01:12:15,594
Internal security can..

845
01:12:15,595 --> 01:12:19,068
I don't care if it's not protocol.
Are you fucking high?

846
01:12:19,069 --> 01:12:21,375
It's the fool! Do not touch the girl.

847
01:12:21,376 --> 01:12:23,544
If he outlives her,
this whole thing goes to hell.

848
01:12:23,545 --> 01:12:25,159
Take him out first.

849
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,382
Cleanup says the prep team
missed one of the kid's stashes.

850
01:12:27,383 --> 01:12:30,335
Whatever he's been smoking's
been immunizing him to all our shit.

851
01:12:30,336 --> 01:12:31,927
How does that help us right now? What?

852
01:12:31,928 --> 01:12:35,171
No, if you have a confirmed kill,
take her out, too.

853
01:12:35,172 --> 01:12:36,274
There.

854
01:12:36,275 --> 01:12:38,080
3606.

855
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,604
Gotcha.

856
01:12:40,605 --> 01:12:42,014
Bring 'em down.

857
01:13:00,354 --> 01:13:03,089
Step out of the elevator!
Step out of the elevator!

858
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:06,175
Why are you trying to kill us?
- Step out! Just the girl!

859
01:13:06,176 --> 01:13:07,600
What? -Just me?

860
01:13:07,601 --> 01:13:08,508
Do it!

861
01:13:19,872 --> 01:13:21,212
Good work, zombie arm.

862
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:47,800
You shouldn't be here.

863
01:13:50,499 --> 01:13:52,715
This should've gone differently.

864
01:13:52,716 --> 01:13:54,436
Ended more quickly.

865
01:13:54,437 --> 01:13:58,737
I can only imagine
your pain and confusion.

866
01:13:58,738 --> 01:14:00,485
But know this.

867
01:14:00,486 --> 01:14:04,808
What's happening to you
is part of something bigger.

868
01:14:04,809 --> 01:14:07,288
Something older than anything known.

869
01:14:07,289 --> 01:14:11,509
You've seen horrible things.

870
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:14,346
An army of nightmare creatures.

871
01:14:14,347 --> 01:14:17,693
But they are nothing
compared to what came before.

872
01:14:17,694 --> 01:14:20,036
What lies below.

873
01:14:21,564 --> 01:14:25,516
It's our task to placate
the ancient ones.

874
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:29,717
As it's yours to
be offered up to them.

875
01:14:31,176 --> 01:14:32,511
Forgive us.

876
01:14:32,512 --> 01:14:34,629
And let us get it over with.

877
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:37,965
Come on. Go in that room.

878
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:01,887
Army of nightmares, huh?

879
01:15:11,247 --> 01:15:12,723
Let's get this party started.

880
01:15:14,603 --> 01:15:15,500
Hold fire!

881
01:15:30,189 --> 01:15:31,382
Oh, shit.

882
01:15:46,994 --> 01:15:49,018
Go! Go! Go!

883
01:17:01,681 --> 01:17:03,432
Lead officer Truman
to security command.

884
01:17:03,433 --> 01:17:07,679
Requesting immediate reinforcements.
Code black. I repeat, code black.

885
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,465
Where the fuck are you guys?

886
01:17:09,466 --> 01:17:13,174
Sector 12, down. Sector 8, down.

887
01:17:13,175 --> 01:17:15,801
Sector 3, down. Jesus Christ!

888
01:17:15,802 --> 01:17:18,090
Why aren't the defenses working?
Where's the fucking gas?

889
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:20,536
Something chewed through the
connections in the utility shaft.

890
01:17:20,783 --> 01:17:22,531
Something which?
- Something scary!

891
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:57,602
The north exit is blocked.
You can't go there.

892
01:18:20,745 --> 01:18:22,276
Go, go, go!

893
01:19:14,557 --> 01:19:15,518
Fuck! We're running out of time!

894
01:19:15,776 --> 01:19:16,857
It's on lockdown,
I'm trying to bypass.

895
01:19:30,394 --> 01:19:32,269
Hadley!

896
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:04,660
Oh, come on!

897
01:20:44,909 --> 01:20:46,093
It's you.

898
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:54,543
No, no, no. Please, please.

899
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:00,241
Kill him.

900
01:21:08,773 --> 01:21:09,876
Okay, Dana, come on.

901
01:21:09,877 --> 01:21:11,368
Dana.

902
01:21:14,459 --> 01:21:16,945
Here. It's easier with this.

903
01:22:21,387 --> 01:22:23,161
Look at these.

904
01:22:25,893 --> 01:22:27,996
Five of them.

905
01:22:27,997 --> 01:22:29,862
What are they?

906
01:22:32,741 --> 01:22:34,040
Us.

907
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:36,653
I should have seen it like you did.

908
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:40,911
This is part of a ritual.

909
01:22:40,912 --> 01:22:43,834
A ritual sacrifice?

910
01:22:46,076 --> 01:22:47,219
Great.

911
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:53,304
You tie someone to a stone, get a
fancy dagger and a bunch of robes.

912
01:22:53,305 --> 01:22:55,762
Is that that complicated?
- No.

913
01:22:55,763 --> 01:22:57,116
It's simple.

914
01:22:57,117 --> 01:22:59,831
They don't just want to see us killed.

915
01:23:02,708 --> 01:23:04,569
They want to see us punished.

916
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:07,278
Punished for what?

917
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:09,751
For being young.

918
01:23:15,534 --> 01:23:18,582
It's different in every culture.

919
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:21,015
And it has changed over the years..

920
01:23:21,016 --> 01:23:24,065
but it has always required youth.

921
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:27,394
There must be at least five.

922
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:30,383
The whore.

923
01:23:30,384 --> 01:23:32,116
She's corrupted.

924
01:23:32,117 --> 01:23:33,757
She dies first.

925
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:36,736
The athlete.

926
01:23:36,737 --> 01:23:39,939
The scholar.

927
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:42,897
The fool.

928
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:46,360
All suffer and die at the hands of..

929
01:23:46,361 --> 01:23:48,839
whatever horror they have raised..

930
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:52,693
leaving the last, to live or die..

931
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,111
.. as fate decides.

932
01:23:57,306 --> 01:23:58,874
The virgin.

933
01:24:00,398 --> 01:24:01,915
Me?

934
01:24:01,915 --> 01:24:03,973
Virgin?

935
01:24:03,974 --> 01:24:06,379
We work with what we have.

936
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:09,185
But what if you don't pull it off?

937
01:24:09,186 --> 01:24:10,130
They rise.

938
01:24:10,131 --> 01:24:11,221
Who does?

939
01:24:12,539 --> 01:24:14,590
What's beneath us?

940
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:16,022
The ancient ones.

941
01:24:16,023 --> 01:24:18,556
The gods that used to rule the Earth.

942
01:24:18,557 --> 01:24:22,746
As long as they accept
our sacrifice, they remain below.

943
01:24:22,747 --> 01:24:25,683
But the other rituals have all failed.

944
01:24:29,371 --> 01:24:30,790
The sun is coming up in eight minutes.

945
01:24:30,791 --> 01:24:34,175
If you live to see it,
the world will end.

946
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:36,640
Maybe that's the way it should be.

947
01:24:36,641 --> 01:24:40,042
If you've got to kill all
my friends to survive..

948
01:24:40,043 --> 01:24:42,146
maybe it's time for a change.

949
01:24:42,147 --> 01:24:44,147
We're not talking about change.

950
01:24:44,148 --> 01:24:49,271
We're talking about the agonizing death
of every human soul on the planet.

951
01:24:49,272 --> 01:24:51,018
Including you.

952
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:52,878
You can die with them..

953
01:24:54,767 --> 01:24:57,258
or you can die for them.

954
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:02,451
Gosh, they're both so enticing.

955
01:25:20,656 --> 01:25:23,558
The whole world, Marty.

956
01:25:23,559 --> 01:25:25,731
Is in your hands, Dana.

957
01:25:25,732 --> 01:25:28,444
There is no other way.

958
01:25:28,445 --> 01:25:31,293
You have to be strong.

959
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:33,871
Yeah, Dana..

960
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:37,498
you feeling strong?

961
01:25:39,631 --> 01:25:41,482
I'm sorry.

962
01:25:45,444 --> 01:25:46,518
So am I.

963
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:30,905
Marty..

964
01:26:36,127 --> 01:26:37,526
Marty!

965
01:27:30,729 --> 01:27:32,953
Hey.

966
01:27:36,185 --> 01:27:37,971
You know..

967
01:27:41,704 --> 01:27:43,981
I don't think Curt even has a cousin.

968
01:27:51,414 --> 01:27:53,469
How are you?

969
01:27:57,101 --> 01:27:58,870
Going away.

970
01:28:03,524 --> 01:28:04,972
I'm sorry.

971
01:28:06,903 --> 01:28:09,061
I'm so sorry I almost shot you.

972
01:28:09,062 --> 01:28:12,334
I probably wouldn't have.

973
01:28:12,335 --> 01:28:14,113
Hey, no. No.

974
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:17,901
I totally get it.

975
01:28:30,685 --> 01:28:35,271
I'm sorry I let you get attacked by
a werewolf and then ended the world.

976
01:28:36,817 --> 01:28:37,646
No.

977
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,921
Hey, you were right.

978
01:28:42,481 --> 01:28:44,146
Humanity..

979
01:28:50,905 --> 01:28:54,047
It's time to give
someone else a chance.

980
01:29:06,373 --> 01:29:08,610
Giant evil gods.

981
01:29:13,943 --> 01:29:16,793
I wish I could've seen them.

982
01:29:16,794 --> 01:29:18,251
I know.

983
01:29:20,585 --> 01:29:23,645
That would have been a fun weekend.
