3
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,433
It's hormonal.

4
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:04,553
I mean, I don't usually fall
back on.. It's women's issues.

5
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:07,877
But child-proofed how?
Gates and stuff?

6
00:01:07,878 --> 00:01:09,215
Dude, she did the drawers.

7
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:11,438
We don't even know if this
whole fertility thing's gonna work..

8
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,190
she's screwed in these little jobbies
where you can't even open the drawers.

9
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:15,051
At all?

10
00:01:15,052 --> 00:01:18,055
No. They open an inch,
then you gotta dig your finger in.

11
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:20,289
- It's a nightmare.
- I guess sooner or later..

12
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,668
Yeah, a lot later.
She did the upper cabinets.

13
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:26,488
Kid will be 30 before he can
reach them, assuming we have a kid.

14
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,522
It is natural for
her to feel protective.

15
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,840
Don't even.. You have women's issues.

16
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:35,604
Please. You of all people.

17
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:37,139
Oh, come on. It's a jinx.

18
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,370
It guarantees that
we won't get pregnant.

19
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:43,286
And it takes me about 20
minutes to get a fucking beer.

20
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:44,587
Guys. Guys!

21
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:45,800
Stockholm went south.

22
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:48,792
Seriously?
I thought they were looking good.

23
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:49,851
What cracked?

24
00:01:49,852 --> 00:01:52,839
I haven't seen the footage.
Word's just going around

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,860
Well, that's never
been a stable scenario.

26
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:56,859
Everyone knows you can't trust Swedes.

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,483
That means there's just Japan.
Japan and us.

28
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,178
It's not the first time
it's come down to that.

29
00:02:01,178 --> 00:02:02,946
Japan has a perfect record.

30
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:04,375
We're number two. We try harder.

31
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:05,890
If we fail, then..

32
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:07,573
Please. We haven't
had a glitch since '98.

33
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:08,949
We know what we're doing, Lin.

34
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,339
Or we have it written down..
somewhere.

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,065
You guys better not
be messing around in there.

36
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,234
Does this mean you're not in
the betting pool this year? Big money.

37
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:19,211
I'm just saying, it's a key scenario.

38
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:20,728
No, I hear what you're saying.

39
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:23,811
In '98, it was the chem
department's fault, right?

40
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:27,089
Where do you work, again?
Wait. It's coming back to me, now.

41
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,488
It's gonna be a long weekend
if everyone's that puckered up.

42
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:34,207
You wanna come over Monday night?

43
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:37,767
I'm gonna pick up some power drills.
Liberate my cabinets.

44
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,484
Are you even listening to me?

45
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,101
Professor fuckwad.

46
00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:28,890
Why haven't you stuck that asshole's
picture on the dartboard yet?

47
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:31,841
It's not that simple
Oh, my God!

48
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:34,399
Your hair. It's blonde.
- Very fabulous, no?

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,119
I can't believe you did it.
- But very fabulous, right?

50
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,725
Hurry up with the "very fabulous."
I'm getting insecure about it now.

51
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:43,358
No, it looks awesome.
Curt's gonna lose it.

52
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:46,195
Curt's gonna thank me.
And so will you..

53
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:48,077
while we're burning this picture.

54
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:49,214
Not ready.

55
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:51,922
Seriously, this isn't his fault.

56
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:54,175
What's not his fault?

57
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:57,470
Fucking his student or
breaking up with her by email?

58
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,356
I knew what I was getting into.

59
00:03:59,357 --> 00:04:00,038
Oh, please.

60
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,780
You know what you're
getting into this weekend?

61
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,832
This.

62
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,496
And if Holden's as
cute as Curt says he is..

63
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,115
possibly getting out of it.

64
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,244
That is the last thing that I want.

65
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:13,776
If you treat this like a setup,
I'm gonna have no fun at all.

66
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:14,875
I'm not pushing..

67
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:17,120
but we're packing this!

68
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,951
Which means we definitely
won't have room for..

69
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:22,499
What if I get bored?

70
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,828
These will help?

71
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:28,012
Soviet Economic Structures?
Aftermath of the..

72
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:31,926
No! We have a lake and a keg.

73
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:33,634
No more learning!
- Think fast.

74
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:35,184
Faster than that.

75
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:39,334
Sorry. Sorry. Move along.

76
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:42,033
Nice!
- Is that Holden?

77
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:44,724
We'll be right down.
He just transferred from State.

78
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:47,320
Best hands on the team.
He's a sweet guy.

79
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,770
And he's good with his hands.

80
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:51,212
I'm kinda seeing this girl..

81
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:53,535
but you're way blonder than she is.

82
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:57,192
But I was thinking, you know, maybe..
What is this?

83
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:59,378
What.. this?
What are you doing with these?

84
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,769
Okay, I get it. I'll leave the books.

85
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,933
No, who gave you these?
Who taught you about these?

86
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:04,729
I learned it from you, okay?

87
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,961
I learned it from watching you!

88
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:12,137
Seriously, Professor Bennett, he
covers this whole book in his lectures.

89
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:16,034
You should read this.

90
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:18,435
Gurovsky. Now this is way
more interesting.

91
00:05:18,436 --> 00:05:20,091
Also, Bennett doesn't
know it by heart..

92
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:21,692
so he'll think you're insightful.

93
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:24,491
And you have no pants.

94
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,643
Oh, shit!

95
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:33,340
- That pretty much it?
- Fucking better be.

96
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:36,087
You know, Jules,
it's a weekend, not an evacuation.

97
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:39,217
Trust me when I say there
is nothing in those cases..

98
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:40,506
you won't be glad I brought.

99
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,359
I'm shutting' right up.

100
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,921
Oh, my God.

101
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,672
Marty!

102
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:57,083
Fuck is wrong with you, bro?

103
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:04,431
People in this town drive
in a very counterintuitive manner.

104
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:07,108
That's what I have to say.

105
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:09,414
Do you wanna spend
the weekend in jail?

106
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:11,663
We'd all like to check
out my cousin's country home.

107
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,222
Honey, that's not okay.

108
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:14,760
Statistical fact..

109
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:18,712
Cops will never pull over
a man with a huge bong in his car.

110
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:19,300
Why?

111
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:23,102
They fear this man.
They know he sees further than they..

112
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,564
and he will bind them
with ancient logics.

113
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,612
Have you gone gray?

114
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:32,865
You're not bringing
that thing in the Rambler.

115
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,114
What?

116
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:37,020
A giant bong in your father's van?

117
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:40,013
What are you, stoned?

118
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:42,764
Hey, man.

119
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:47,589
Dana, you fetching minx!

120
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,153
You have any food?

121
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:52,171
Everybody ready?
- Yeah!

122
00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:55,311
Yeah?
- Okay, I'm ready!

123
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:57,609
Let's get this show on the road!

124
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:17,456
Nest is empty. We're right on time.

125
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:21,942
I hope this is the right road.

126
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:24,274
It doesn't even show up on the GPS.

127
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:26,228
It is unworthy of global positioning.

128
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:29,977
That's the whole point.
Get off the grid, right?

129
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:32,226
No cell phone reception..

130
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:34,422
no traffic cameras.

131
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:37,587
Go someplace for one goddamn
weekend where they can't..

132
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:40,076
globally position my ass, man.

133
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:42,461
This is the whole issue.

134
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,148
Is society crumbling, Marty?

135
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:46,703
No. Society is binding. Right?

136
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:49,858
It's filling in the
cracks with concrete.

137
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:54,270
Everything's filed or
recorded or blogged, right?

138
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:57,545
Chips in our kids' heads
so they won't get lost.

139
00:07:57,546 --> 00:07:59,617
Society needs to crumble.

140
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:02,419
We're all just too
chicken-shit to let it.

141
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,040
I've missed your rants.

142
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,087
You will come to see things my way.

143
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,733
Identification, please.

144
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:17,908
Mr. Sitterson.

145
00:08:18,987 --> 00:08:20,809
Mr. Hadley.
- Thank you.

146
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,897
What's your name?
- Daniel Truman, sir.

147
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:25,118
This isn't the military.
You can drop the "sir".

148
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:28,720
But Sitterson does
like to be called "ma'am."

149
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:31,260
Or "honey toes."
- He'll also answer to "honey toes."

150
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,478
You clear on what's
gonna be happening here?

151
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,909
I've been prepped. Extensively.

152
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,921
Did they tell you that being prepped
is not the same as being prepared?

153
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:39,415
They told me.
I'll hold my post, Mr. Hadley.

154
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,134
Good man.

155
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:43,423
Okay. System's online.

156
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:47,050
Acquiring target.
Let's see what we got.

157
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,805
I'm thinking this thing
doesn't take credit cards.

158
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,485
I don't think it knows about money.

159
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:29,789
I think it's barter gas.

160
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,392
Hello?

161
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:01,086
Hey, Holden.

162
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:05,595
Holden!
- I don't think there's gonna be..

163
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,818
You come here uninvited?
- Fuck!

164
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:15,095
Sign says "closed."

165
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:17,693
Yeah, we were looking to buy some gas.

166
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:19,972
Does this pump work?

167
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:21,509
If you know how to work it.

168
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:24,792
We also wanted to get directions.

169
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:26,934
We're looking for.. What's it called?

170
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:29,403
Tillerman Road.
Do you know if it's this way?

171
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:35,623
Tillerman Road takes
you up the hill, there.

172
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:37,582
Dead-ends at the old Buckner place.

173
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,533
My cousin bought a house up there.

174
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:41,570
You go through a mountain tunnel,
there's a lake.

175
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:43,783
Would that be the..
- Buckner place.

176
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:46,816
Always someone looking
to sell that plot.

177
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:48,630
You knew the original owners.

178
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:51,017
Yeah, not the first.

179
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:56,132
I seen plenty come and go.
Hell, I been here since the war.

180
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,573
- Which war?
- You know damn well which war!

181
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:04,045
Would that have been with
the blue and some in gray?

182
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:08,268
Brother, perhaps,
fighting against brother in that war?

183
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:09,316
You sassing me, boy?

184
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:10,877
You were rude to my friend.

185
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,459
That whore?

186
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,830
What'd you say?
- I think we got enough gas.

187
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:18,027
You got enough to get you there.

188
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:19,957
Getting back..

189
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,895
that's your concern.

190
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,156
Well, good luck with
your business, sir.

191
00:11:37,157 --> 00:11:40,124
I know the railroad's coming
through here any day, now.

192
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,086
That's gonna be big.

193
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:44,359
Streets paved with actual street.

194
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,382
Fucker.

195
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:01,174
This must be it.

196
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:16,994
Oh, my God. It's.. beautiful.

197
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:20,134
One spider and I'm
sleeping in the Rambler.

198
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:21,610
I mean it.

199
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:24,147
Come on. Give me a hand.

200
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:20,386
This is awesome.

201
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:21,844
It is kind of cool.

202
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:24,043
You gonna kill us a raccoon to eat?

203
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:25,612
I will use its skin to make a cap.

204
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:31,177
Everybody get your suits on. In
10 minutes, we're heading to the lake.

205
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:32,122
Yeah.

206
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:35,039
I was not informed there
would be calisthenics.

207
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,090
Yeah, I don't think so.

208
00:15:03,132 --> 00:15:04,522
Whoa.

209
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,122
No way.

210
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:29,218
Ah, shit.

211
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:34,826
This is happening.

212
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:45,425
Hold up!

213
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,218
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

214
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:51,751
That's just creepy.

215
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:54,179
It was pioneer days.

216
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,058
People had to make their
own interrogation rooms.

217
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:58,644
Who did your cousin
buy this place from?

218
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:01,245
We should check the rest of the rooms,
make sure this is the only one.

219
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:03,502
'Cause you know Marty wants
to watch us pounding away.

220
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:06,227
I didn't even like hearing that.

221
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:13,054
How about we switch?

222
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:15,163
Not that I'd..

223
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:18,267
I mean, I'd put the picture back but you
might feel better if we switched rooms?

224
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,616
I really would.

225
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:26,317
Thanks. For being decent.

226
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,340
It's the least I could do..

227
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,616
since Curt and Jules
sold you to me for marriage.

228
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:32,059
They're not subtle.

229
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,707
Well, I'll just be flattered
and keep it to myself.

230
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,052
Yeah, I'm not looking for..

231
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:39,336
But, I'm still grateful
that you're not a creep.

232
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:41,895
Hey, let's not jump
to any conclusions there.

233
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:44,416
I had kind of an internal
debate about showing you the mirror.

234
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:47,149
Shouting on both sides.
Blood was spilled.

235
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,020
So, you're bleeding internally?

236
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:50,486
Pretty bad.

237
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:54,733
Well, Jules is pre-med.
You should probably talk to her.

238
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:58,324
Okay.

239
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:25,594
Wow.

240
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:47,665
Yeah, I don't think so.

241
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:16,446
Places everyone.

242
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:18,863
We are live.

243
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,155
Engineering, we got a room change.

244
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:22,706
Polk is now in two, McCrea is in four.

245
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:26,147
Operations, do you copy?
We need a scenario adjustment.

246
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,351
Miss Lin.

247
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:33,301
We've got the blood work
back on Louden. Her levels are good.

248
00:18:33,302 --> 00:18:35,503
But we're recommending
a fifty-milligram bump..

249
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:37,330
of Rhohyptase to increase libido.

250
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:39,915
- Sold. - Do we pipe it in,
or do you wanna do it orally?

251
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,442
Ask me that again, only slower.

252
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:43,276
You're a pig.

253
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:46,138
Guess how we're
slowing down cognition.

254
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:46,901
I don't know.

255
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:50,275
The hair dye.

256
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:51,959
Dumb blonde. Very artistic.

257
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,182
Works its way into the blood,
through the scalp. Very gradual.

258
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:59,353
Chem department keeps their end up.

259
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:01,001
I'll see it when I believe it.

260
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:02,548
Control?
- Yeah, go ahead.

261
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:04,758
I have the harbinger on line two.

262
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:08,013
Oh, Christ. Can you take a message?

263
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:11,580
I don't think so. He's really pushy.

264
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:15,340
To be honest,
he's kind of freaking me out.

265
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:17,025
Okay. Put him on.

266
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:20,583
Mordecai, baby, what's happening?
How's the weather up top?

267
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:24,799
The lambs have passed through the gate.
They are come to the killing floor.

268
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,986
Well, you're doing
a great job out there.

269
00:19:26,987 --> 00:19:30,122
By the numbers, man.
You got us started off just right.

270
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:31,772
So, we'll talk to you later, okay?

271
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:35,071
Their blind eyes see nothing
of the horrors to come.

272
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:37,054
Their ears are stopped.

273
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:39,139
They are the gods' fools.

274
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,242
Well, that's.. how it works.

275
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:46,030
Cleanse them. Cleanse the
world of their ignorance and sin.

276
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:48,515
Bathe them in the crimson of..

277
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,624
Am I on speakerphone?

278
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,900
No. Absolutely not.

279
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,803
Speakerphone, no.
No, I wouldn't do that.

280
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,838
Yes, I am. I can hear the echo.

281
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,258
Oh, my God. You're right.
Hang on one second, I'll take you off.

282
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:03,984
That's rude.
I don't know who's in the room.

283
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:06,848
Fine. There. You're off.

284
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:07,951
Thank you.

285
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:10,080
Don't take this lightly, boy.

286
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:12,761
It wasn't all by your numbers.

287
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:17,275
The fool nearly derailed
the invocation with his insolence.

288
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:19,927
The ancient ones see everything.

289
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,379
And they will not be..

290
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:23,967
I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I?

291
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:28,012
Oh, my God. Mordecai.

292
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:30,660
I can't believe it. I did it again!

293
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:31,856
Mordy?

294
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,505
What happens next?

295
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,378
Oh! That's cold!

296
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,656
How cold? Is it worth it?

297
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:50,192
Come on, Jules. Life is risk.

298
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:53,300
Yeah, I might just risk
lying out in the sun for a while.

299
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:54,532
Boo.

300
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:56,527
Hey, what is that?
- What?

301
00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:57,905
In the lake, right there.

302
00:20:57,906 --> 00:20:59,856
Oh, come on. - No you guys,
I'm serious. Right there.

303
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:02,561
There! There!
God, looks just like my girlfriend!

304
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,306
Oh, my God!

305
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,948
There's something else in the lake!

306
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:12,486
It's a gorgeous man!
- I'm gonna kill you!

307
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:14,839
Don't kill the gorgeous man!
We're endangered!

308
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:22,919
All right. Last chance.

309
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,585
It's post time. Dig deep, people.
Betting windows are closing. Okay.

310
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,434
Okay, who's still out?

311
00:21:28,435 --> 00:21:32,715
Let's see. We got engineering,
we got R & D, and we got electrical.

312
00:21:32,716 --> 00:21:34,202
Did you see who they picked?

313
00:21:34,203 --> 00:21:35,515
They're practically
giving their money away.

314
00:21:35,516 --> 00:21:37,473
You should talk, Aquaman.

315
00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:39,639
What do you mean?
- Ah, nothing.

316
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:41,838
Okay, all right.

317
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,124
I'm not even sure
we have one of these.

318
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,345
Zoology swears we do.

319
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,300
They'd know. Okay. All right, people.

320
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:49,408
Hey, what do you got?

321
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,587
No, they've already been picked.

322
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:53,362
What? No. Who took them?

323
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:54,334
Maintenance.

324
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:56,244
Maintenance?
They pick the same thing every year.

325
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:57,265
What do you want from me?

326
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:58,806
If they were creative,
they wouldn't be in maintenance.

327
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:00,845
You're gonna have to split
this if you win. You wanna switch?

328
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:05,351
I don't know, I don't know.
What do you think?

329
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:08,220
More than anything,
I just want this moment to end.

330
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:13,602
Not betting?

331
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:14,851
Not for me. Thanks.

332
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:18,048
Seems a little harsh, doesn't it?

333
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,471
It's just people letting off steam.

334
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:25,399
This job isn't easy,
however those clowns may behave.

335
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,671
Does the director.
Do they know about this downstairs?

336
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:30,989
The director doesn't
care about this stuff.

337
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,695
As long as everything
goes smoothly upstairs..

338
00:22:32,697 --> 00:22:34,562
as long as the kids
do as they're told.

339
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:35,889
But then it's fixed.

340
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,529
No, no, no.

341
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,648
How can you wager on this
when you control the outcome?

342
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:43,307
No, we just get 'em in the cellar.
They take it from there.

343
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,416
No, they have to make the
choice of their own free will.

344
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:47,240
Otherwise the system doesn't work.

345
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,121
It's like the harbinger.

346
00:22:49,122 --> 00:22:53,632
It's this creepy old fuck, practically
wears a sign, "You will die."

347
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:55,558
Why do we put him there? The system.

348
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,975
They have to choose to ignore him..

349
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,228
and they have to choose
what happens in the cellar.

350
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:02,152
Yeah, we rig the game
as much as we need to..

351
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:04,234
but in the end,
they don't transgress..

352
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:05,482
hey can't be punished.

353
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:09,024
So what's it gonna be, Truman?
You in? Window's closing.

354
00:23:11,744 --> 00:23:12,786
I'm fine.

355
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:15,897
Okay.

356
00:23:15,897 --> 00:23:17,330
That's it, gang!

357
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:18,862
The board is locked!

358
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:21,153
Oh, let's get this party started!

359
00:23:21,154 --> 00:23:23,548
Let's get this party started!

360
00:23:34,617 --> 00:23:35,385
There you go.

361
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:37,326
Okay, my turn.

362
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:38,434
Jules.

363
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,015
Truth or dare?

364
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:44,156
Let's go dare.

365
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,425
All right.

366
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:49,171
I dare you to make out with..

367
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:50,998
Please say "Dana," please say "Dana."

368
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,692
That moose, over there.

369
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:55,665
Marty..

370
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,304
have you ever seen a moose before?

371
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,410
Whatever that mysterious beast is.

372
00:24:02,411 --> 00:24:03,916
That's a wolf.

373
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:07,867
I'm living in a womb of reefer,
leave me alone.

374
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:09,866
Jules..

375
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:12,635
I dare you to make out with that wolf.

376
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,798
No problem.

377
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:39,988
Who?

378
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:41,880
Me?

379
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:44,462
Well, yes, I am new in town.

380
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:46,399
How did you know?

381
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,480
Oh, my God.
That is so sweet of you to say.

382
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,362
I just colored it, in fact.

383
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:53,708
No, no, no.

384
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,006
There's no need to huff and puff.

385
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:59,073
I'll let you come in.

386
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:34,190
Thank you.

387
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:38,655
Yeah.

388
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,808
Now,...

389
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:47,815
Dana.

390
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:48,758
Truth.

391
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:51,490
What's that supposed to mean?

392
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:52,967
I'm just skipping ahead.

393
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,000
You're gonna say dare.

394
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:56,681
She's gonna dare you to
do something you don't like..

395
00:25:56,682 --> 00:26:00,768
and then you'll puss out and
say that you wanted truth all along.

396
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,272
Really?

397
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:05,299
Okay, Jules.

398
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,093
Dare.

399
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:09,268
What the hell was that?

400
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,233
It's the cellar door.

401
00:26:12,234 --> 00:26:14,229
The wind must've blown it open.

402
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,051
That makes what kinda sense?

403
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:18,716
What do you think is down there?

404
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:24,342
Why don't we find out?

405
00:26:26,745 --> 00:26:27,832
Dana.

406
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:30,471
I dare you.

407
00:26:45,662 --> 00:26:48,458
How long do I have to stay down here?

408
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,572
Oh, you know, just 'til morning.

409
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:25,404
Dana.

410
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:28,535
You okay?

411
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:29,914
Yeah.

412
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,238
Sorry, I just scared myself.

413
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:36,544
Well, you called for help.
That voids the dare.

414
00:27:36,545 --> 00:27:38,210
Take your top off.

415
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:39,621
What?

416
00:27:39,622 --> 00:27:41,375
I don't make up the rules.

417
00:27:43,018 --> 00:27:44,701
Oh, my God.

418
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,588
Look at all this.

419
00:27:51,992 --> 00:27:54,545
Guys..

420
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:59,135
I'm not sure it's
awesome to be down here.

421
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,047
Guys?

422
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:05,819
Dude, seriously,
your cousin is into some weird shit.

423
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,451
I'm pretty sure this ain't his.

424
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:12,219
Maybe it was the people
who put in that mirror thing.

425
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:18,196
Some of this stuff looks really old.

426
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,068
It's beautiful.

427
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:26,407
Maybe we should go back upstairs.

428
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,828
I dare you all to go upstairs.

429
00:29:24,945 --> 00:29:25,761
Guys?

430
00:29:27,453 --> 00:29:28,835
Guys, listen to this.

431
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:31,283
"April fourth.

432
00:29:31,284 --> 00:29:35,368
"Father was cross with me
and said I lacked the true faith.

433
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:38,208
"I wish I could prove my devotion..

434
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,659
"as Judah and Matthew
proved on those travelers."

435
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,599
What is that?

436
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,723
Diary of Anna Patience Buckner, 1903.

437
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:51,150
"Mama screamed most of the night.

438
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:53,667
"I prayed that she might find faith..

439
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:56,468
"but she only stopped
when Papa cut her belly..

440
00:29:56,469 --> 00:29:57,904
"and stuffed the coals in.

441
00:29:57,905 --> 00:30:00,214
"Judah told me in my dream..

442
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:04,216
"that Matthew took him to the
black room, so I know he is killed.

443
00:30:04,217 --> 00:30:09,158
"I want to understand the
glory of the pain like Matthew..

444
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:15,171
"but cutting the flesh makes
him have a husband's bulge..

445
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:16,961
"and I do not get like that."

446
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:19,463
- Jesus. Can we not?
- No. Go on.

447
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:20,758
- Why?
- I want to know.

448
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:22,309
"I have found it..

449
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:26,642
"in the oldest books,
the way of saving our family.

450
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:29,388
"My good arm is hacked up..

451
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:32,473
"and et,
so I hope this will be readable.

452
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:36,927
"That a believer will come
and speak this to our spirits.

453
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:40,673
"Then we will be restored
and the great pain will return."

454
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:44,923
And then there's something in Latin.

455
00:30:44,924 --> 00:30:48,349
Okay, I'm drawing a line
in the fucking sand, here.

456
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,752
Do not read the Latin.

457
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:53,560
What the fuck?

458
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:56,535
- Dolor..
- No, no.

459
00:30:56,536 --> 00:30:58,773
- Stop being a fucking baby.
- Curt!

460
00:30:58,774 --> 00:30:59,647
It's a diary.

461
00:30:59,648 --> 00:31:01,577
It doesn't even mean anything.

462
00:31:01,578 --> 00:31:05,237
- Dana!
- "Dolor supervivo caro.

463
00:31:05,237 --> 00:31:09,745
"Dolor sublimis caro.

464
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:14,181
"Dolor ignio annivos."

465
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:44,947
We have a winner!

466
00:31:44,948 --> 00:31:47,298
It's the Buckners,
ladies and gentlemen!

467
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:49,768
The Buckners pull a 'W'.

468
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:55,949
All right. That means that
congratulations go to Maintenance!

469
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,600
Who share the pot
with Ronald the intern.

470
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:00,440
Yeah!

471
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:02,361
That's not fair. I had zombies, too.

472
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:04,357
Yes, you did. You had zombies.

473
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:07,643
But this is
"Zombie Redneck Torture Family," see?

474
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:09,499
They're entirely separate species.

475
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,203
Like the difference between
an elephant and an elephant seal.

476
00:32:12,204 --> 00:32:14,781
There's always next year.

477
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:18,059
They're like something
from a nightmare.

478
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,998
No. They're something
nightmares are from.

479
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:26,026
Everything in our stable
is remnant of the old world..

00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,326
Gods.

483
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,047
You get used to it.

484
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:37,544
Should you?

485
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:48,739
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

486
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,772
- He had the conch in his hands.
- I know.

487
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:52,724
A couple more minutes,
who knows what might've happened?

488
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:55,842
I am never gonna see a merman. Ever.

489
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:57,073
Dude, be thankful.

490
00:32:57,074 --> 00:32:58,596
Those things are terrifying.

491
00:32:58,597 --> 00:33:00,966
And the cleanup on
them is a nightmare.

492
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:05,491
So, the Buckners.

493
00:33:05,492 --> 00:33:09,137
Yeah, well, they may be zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots..

494
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:12,508
But they're our zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots.

495
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:14,614
With a hundred percent clearance rate.

496
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:16,269
True. So should we call Japan?

497
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:19,073
Tell them to take the
rest of the weekend off?

498
00:33:19,074 --> 00:33:21,893
Yeah, right. They're Japanese.
What are they gonna do? Relax?

499
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:24,310
I'd just like to see them
fall on their asses, for once.

500
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:25,297
Oh, God, don't even joke.

501
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:27,065
Every other branch has air-balled.

502
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:31,015
We need the Japanese crew to get it
done. There's too much riding on this.

503
00:34:11,308 --> 00:34:12,600
Fuck, yeah, baby.

504
00:34:13,592 --> 00:34:14,894
This is so classy.

505
00:34:14,895 --> 00:34:17,077
Come on, like you wouldn't
want a piece of that.

506
00:34:17,078 --> 00:34:20,399
Can we not talk about people
in pieces any more tonight?

507
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,188
Are you feeling lonely, Marty?

508
00:34:26,423 --> 00:34:29,716
Marty and I were sweeties
in our freshman hall.

509
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:31,914
We made out once.

510
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,825
I never did buy that ring.

511
00:34:34,826 --> 00:34:36,645
But we're still..

512
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,130
close.

513
00:34:45,006 --> 00:34:46,953
I have a theory about all this.

514
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:48,801
That's our cue to bail.

515
00:34:48,802 --> 00:34:52,483
Tommy Chong here has a theory.
Come on, baby.

516
00:34:52,484 --> 00:34:56,028
Don't worry,
you can tell it to Egghead, here..

517
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:58,122
if he's not too busy
devirginizing Dana.

518
00:34:58,123 --> 00:35:01,045
Jules, do you wanna go lie down?

519
00:35:01,046 --> 00:35:04,541
That's exactly the point.
Come on. Mush. Mush.

520
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:05,548
Don't push me around.

521
00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:06,903
Not around, baby. Straight line.

522
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:30,517
You seriously believe
nothing weird is going on?

523
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:32,749
Conspiracy?

524
00:35:33,786 --> 00:35:35,555
The way everybody's acting.

525
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:38,776
Why is Jules suddenly a celebu-tard?

526
00:35:38,777 --> 00:35:43,165
And since when does Curt
pull this alpha-male bullshit?

527
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:46,234
I mean, he's a sociology major.

528
00:35:46,235 --> 00:35:48,314
He's on full academic scholarship..

529
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:51,010
and now he's calling
his friend an egghead?

530
00:35:51,011 --> 00:35:52,704
Curt's just drunk.

531
00:35:52,705 --> 00:35:54,879
I've seen Curt drunk.

532
00:35:55,931 --> 00:35:57,586
Jules, too.

533
00:35:57,587 --> 00:35:59,629
Well, then, maybe it's something else.

534
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:04,466
You're not seeing
what you don't wanna see.

535
00:36:06,653 --> 00:36:08,430
Puppeteers.

536
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:10,524
Puppeteers?

537
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:11,648
Pop-Tarts?

538
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:13,025
Did you say you have Pop-Tarts?

539
00:36:13,026 --> 00:36:16,682
Marty, I love you,
but you're really high.

540
00:36:18,017 --> 00:36:22,165
We are not who we are.

541
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:28,675
I'm gonna go read
a book with pictures.

542
00:36:28,675 --> 00:36:32,818
Thank you.
- "The pain outlives the flesh.

543
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:36,801
"The flesh returns.."
or "has a meeting place."

544
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:37,898
What is that?

545
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:40,698
The Latin that you
read in the basement.

546
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,425
You speak Latin?

547
00:36:41,426 --> 00:36:45,441
Not well. Not since tenth grade.

548
00:36:45,442 --> 00:36:47,822
Weird how it all comes back.

549
00:36:47,823 --> 00:36:50,304
Well, it's a weird kind of night.

550
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:53,085
I'm sorry about tonight.

551
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,710
Everybody..

552
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:58,503
Do I lose points if I tell
you I'm having a pretty nice time?

553
00:36:58,504 --> 00:37:03,321
No. You can tell me that.

554
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,862
What are you running away for?

555
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:19,252
Don't spill on me!

556
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:20,716
Did I get a little beer on your shirt?

557
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:24,830
I guess it'll have to come off, huh?

558
00:37:26,283 --> 00:37:28,390
Not here.

559
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:30,784
Baby, come on.

560
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:32,691
We're all alone.

561
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:43,873
I'm chilly.

562
00:37:45,215 --> 00:37:48,868
Okay, guys. That's it.
Let's go. We've got a job to do.

563
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:51,658
Your basic human needs disgust me.
Get out of here.

564
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:53,952
- Do we have temperature
control in this sector? - On it.

565
00:37:57,297 --> 00:38:01,543
Engaging pheromone mists.

566
00:38:27,117 --> 00:38:28,630
It's so dark.

567
00:38:28,631 --> 00:38:29,996
Take me inside?

568
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:31,576
Come on. This is why we came here.

569
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:35,150
It's romantic.

570
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:55,787
Okay, baby. Let's see some boobies.

571
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:57,565
Show us the goods.

572
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:01,209
Does it really matter if we see her..

573
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,197
We're not the only ones watching, kid.

574
00:39:02,198 --> 00:39:04,323
Gotta keep the customer satisfied.

575
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,348
You understand what's at stake, here?

576
00:39:50,312 --> 00:39:51,328
Score.

577
00:40:22,777 --> 00:40:23,980
Jules!

578
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:39,386
This we offer in humility and fear.

579
00:41:40,573 --> 00:41:43,025
For the blessed peace
of your eternal slumber.

580
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:45,151
As it ever was.

581
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:46,223
As it ever was.

582
00:42:34,948 --> 00:42:38,868
Nemo, man, you gotta wake up.
Your shit is topsy-turvy.

583
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,588
I'm gonna go for a walk.

584
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:46,922
Okay. I swear to fucking God,
somebody is talking.

585
00:42:51,964 --> 00:42:54,342
Or I'm pretty sure someone is.

586
00:42:54,343 --> 00:42:57,211
I'm gonna go for a walk.

587
00:42:57,212 --> 00:42:58,903
Enough!

588
00:42:58,903 --> 00:43:00,712
What are you saying?

589
00:43:00,713 --> 00:43:03,043
What do you want?

590
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:07,461
You think I'm a puppet, huh?

591
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:09,987
You think I'm a puppet.
Gonna do a little..

592
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:12,581
fucking puppet dance!

593
00:43:12,582 --> 00:43:15,523
I'm the boss of my own brain,
so give it up.

594
00:43:15,524 --> 00:43:21,399
I'm gonna go for a walk.

595
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:33,266
I don't wanna..

596
00:43:33,267 --> 00:43:34,823
I mean, I've never..

597
00:43:34,824 --> 00:43:38,412
I don't mean "never"..

598
00:43:38,412 --> 00:43:39,272
Hey.

599
00:43:39,273 --> 00:43:41,381
Nothing you don't want.

600
00:43:45,544 --> 00:43:47,519
He's got a husband bulge.

601
00:44:05,532 --> 00:44:07,168
I thought there'd be stars.

602
00:44:11,642 --> 00:44:13,222
We are abandoned.

603
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,280
- Fuck!
- Fucking run!

604
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:41,182
Curt!

605
00:44:43,035 --> 00:44:44,064
Dead bitch!

606
00:44:48,261 --> 00:44:49,945
Jesus, what happened?

607
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:50,861
The fuck!

608
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:52,229
Curt, what the fuck?

609
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,327
Where are you hurt?

610
00:44:53,328 --> 00:44:54,663
Is all of this from you?

611
00:44:54,664 --> 00:44:56,578
It's okay! Curt, you're okay!

612
00:44:56,784 --> 00:44:57,852
Where's Jules?

613
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:02,350
She's gone.

614
00:45:03,475 --> 00:45:05,898
We've gotta get out of here.

615
00:45:05,899 --> 00:45:08,426
No. No.

616
00:45:08,427 --> 00:45:09,331
Dana, don't open that..

617
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:10,758
I'm not leaving here without Jules.

618
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:12,329
That dead girl's out there!

619
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:35,928
Dana, come on!

620
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:41,505
What is that thing?

621
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:42,621
Fuck!

622
00:45:42,621 --> 00:45:43,919
I don't know,
but there's more of them.

623
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,911
More of them?

624
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:46,623
I saw a young girl.

625
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:48,323
All zombied like him..

626
00:45:48,324 --> 00:45:50,262
but she was missing an arm.

627
00:45:50,263 --> 00:45:53,805
Oh, my God. Patience.

628
00:45:53,806 --> 00:45:55,636
The diary.

629
00:45:55,637 --> 00:45:58,139
- We gotta lock this place down.
- He's right.

630
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,197
We'll go room by room.
Barricade every window and door.

631
00:46:01,198 --> 00:46:04,908
We gotta play it safe. No matter what
happens, we have to stay together.

632
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:07,549
Fuck!

633
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:08,498
Calm down.

634
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,683
Watch the master work.

635
00:46:21,097 --> 00:46:22,388
This isn't right.

636
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:24,019
What? What's the matter?

637
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,501
This isn't right. We should split up.

638
00:46:27,502 --> 00:46:30,315
We can cover more ground that way.

639
00:46:30,316 --> 00:46:31,739
Yeah.

640
00:46:33,148 --> 00:46:34,590
Yeah. Good idea.

641
00:46:35,547 --> 00:46:36,880
Really?

642
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,372
All right,
you guys, get in your rooms.

643
00:46:44,216 --> 00:46:45,417
Lock them in.

644
00:46:51,362 --> 00:46:53,906
What the fuck?

645
00:47:06,103 --> 00:47:07,522
What the..?

646
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:17,595
What the fuck?

647
00:47:17,596 --> 00:47:19,172
That's not good.

648
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:21,055
Out of the way. Out of the way.
Out of the way.

649
00:47:21,056 --> 00:47:24,071
Chem department,
I need 500 CCs of Thorazine..

650
00:47:24,072 --> 00:47:25,329
pumped into room three.

651
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:26,364
No, no, no.

652
00:47:26,365 --> 00:47:27,419
Stand by, Chem.

653
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,554
Judah Buckner to the rescue.

654
00:47:33,897 --> 00:47:34,974
What the fuck?

655
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:39,543
Fuck! What the fuck?

656
00:47:43,234 --> 00:47:45,111
Oh, my God.

657
00:47:45,536 --> 00:47:49,069
I'm on a reality TV show.

658
00:47:52,054 --> 00:47:55,490
My parents are gonna
think I'm such a burnout.

659
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:44,827
Help me! Help me!

660
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:11,744
Must be getting excited downstairs.

661
00:49:12,188 --> 00:49:13,721
Greatest show on Earth.

662
00:49:30,821 --> 00:49:31,810
Somebody help!

663
00:49:34,034 --> 00:49:35,571
Come on!

664
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,831
Use the bed!
- Come on! Come on!

665
00:50:01,558 --> 00:50:03,830
It's empty.
- Go.

666
00:50:06,352 --> 00:50:07,891
Curt?
- Unlock the door.

667
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:09,935
I can't. Get down to the basement.

668
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:28,752
This is the black room.

669
00:50:28,753 --> 00:50:30,371
Nice.

670
00:50:33,353 --> 00:50:34,352
From the diary.

671
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:38,161
This is where he killed them.

672
00:50:40,728 --> 00:50:42,011
This is where he kills us.

673
00:50:42,012 --> 00:50:43,987
No way. No.

674
00:50:43,988 --> 00:50:45,614
He's not gonna kill us

675
00:50:45,615 --> 00:50:47,630
We just gotta find a door.

676
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:49,179
Okay?

677
00:50:52,623 --> 00:50:54,296
Let's just check the walls, okay?

678
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:56,759
Curt?

679
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,585
I mean, there's gotta be..

680
00:51:14,557 --> 00:51:16,153
You like pain?

681
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:21,522
How's that work for you?

682
00:51:44,204 --> 00:51:45,941
These fucking zombies.

683
00:51:45,942 --> 00:51:48,360
Remember when you could
just throw a girl in a volcano?

684
00:51:48,361 --> 00:51:49,627
How old do you think I am?

685
00:51:58,089 --> 00:52:00,012
Let's move! Come on! Come on! Go!

686
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:13,295
What about Marty?

687
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,486
They got him.

688
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:50,855
The devil is defeated.

689
00:52:50,856 --> 00:52:54,212
Now Kiko's spirit will
live in the happy frog!

690
00:53:02,985 --> 00:53:04,064
Fuck you!

691
00:53:04,065 --> 00:53:07,879
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

692
00:53:10,435 --> 00:53:12,569
- You seeing this?
- Perfect record, huh?

693
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:15,479
The Japan crew should've
had this in the bag. They fucked us.

694
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,672
How hard is it to kill nine-year-olds?

695
00:53:16,673 --> 00:53:18,771
Zero fatality. Total wash.

696
00:53:18,772 --> 00:53:22,263
You want good product,
you gotta buy American.

697
00:53:22,264 --> 00:53:24,439
Any word from downstairs?

698
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,028
Downstairs doesn't care about Japan.
The director trusts us.

699
00:53:27,028 --> 00:53:28,865
You just sweat the chem, Lin.

700
00:53:28,866 --> 00:53:31,609
While these morons are singing
What a Friend We Have in Shinto..

701
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,588
we are bringing the pain.

702
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:35,815
Yeah, and what the fuck's
up with this guy's pot, anyway?

703
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:38,624
He's supposed to be drooling
and instead he almost makes us?

704
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:39,975
We treated the shit out of it.

705
00:53:39,976 --> 00:53:42,101
Okay, we've got the Rambler
heading toward the tunnel.

706
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:43,896
The fool's toast anyway.

707
00:53:43,897 --> 00:53:46,719
And so are we if you
don't get this under control.

708
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,388
Shit.
- What? "Shit" why?

709
00:53:49,389 --> 00:53:50,484
Gotta go. Work to do.

710
00:53:50,485 --> 00:53:52,622
You guys are humanity's last hope.
If the ancients rise..

711
00:53:52,623 --> 00:53:55,327
There's no cave-in.
- What?

712
00:53:55,328 --> 00:53:56,741
The fucking tunnel's open!

713
00:53:56,742 --> 00:53:59,445
Control to Demolition.

714
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:00,430
We're dark on the whole sector.

715
00:54:00,431 --> 00:54:01,610
Try to bypass it.

716
00:54:01,611 --> 00:54:03,359
- What the fuck do you think I'm doing?
- Open the door.

717
00:54:13,134 --> 00:54:15,666
Look out!
Get out of the way! Make a hole!

718
00:54:20,225 --> 00:54:22,262
What the fuck's going on?
- We don't know.

719
00:54:22,263 --> 00:54:23,788
Electrical said there
was a glitch up top.

720
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:25,914
That tunnel should've blown hours ago.
- We didn't get the order.

721
00:54:38,764 --> 00:54:39,882
Hadley, what is going on?

722
00:54:39,883 --> 00:54:41,757
Hadley?

723
00:54:41,758 --> 00:54:44,032
Why hasn't the tunnel blown?

724
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:36,428
No, no. No fucking way!

725
00:55:38,718 --> 00:55:40,491
Can't believe this, man.
This ain't happening.

726
00:55:40,492 --> 00:55:44,132
It's right there.

727
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:46,525
All right.
We got any climbing gear? Ropes?

728
00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:48,640
Yeah. In my fucking dorm room.

729
00:55:48,641 --> 00:55:50,213
We can't go back.

730
00:55:50,214 --> 00:55:52,009
There's no way across.

731
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,552
What're we gonna do? Jump?

732
00:55:53,553 --> 00:55:55,504
Dude.

733
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:57,973
What?

734
00:56:04,255 --> 00:56:05,437
Curt, are you sure about this?

735
00:56:05,438 --> 00:56:06,673
I've done bigger jumps than this.

736
00:56:06,674 --> 00:56:08,030
You've got a smooth run..

737
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,262
and maybe a five foot
differential on the other side.

738
00:56:10,263 --> 00:56:12,067
But you've gotta give it everything.

739
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,982
Curt.

740
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:18,754
Look, you guys,
you stay in the Rambler.

741
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:19,981
I'll get help.

742
00:56:19,982 --> 00:56:23,100
If I wipe out,
I'll fucking limp for help.

743
00:56:23,101 --> 00:56:25,192
But I'm coming back here.

744
00:56:25,193 --> 00:56:28,363
I'm coming back with
cops and choppers..

745
00:56:28,364 --> 00:56:31,698
and large fucking guns,
and those things are gonna pay.

746
00:56:33,212 --> 00:56:34,885
For Jules.

747
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,906
Don't hold back.

748
00:56:44,907 --> 00:56:47,822
Never do.

749
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:13,608
No!

750
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,521
Curt!

751
00:57:16,813 --> 00:57:17,684
Oh, God!

752
00:57:22,793 --> 00:57:28,311
He hit something.
There's nothing. What'd he hit?

753
00:57:30,462 --> 00:57:31,603
Puppeteers.

754
00:57:33,019 --> 00:57:35,390
Marty was right.

755
00:57:35,391 --> 00:57:37,173
Get in the van.

756
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:40,542
Dana.

757
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:47,634
Marty was right.

758
00:58:05,895 --> 00:58:07,097
You're going back.

759
00:58:07,098 --> 00:58:08,745
I'm going through.

760
00:58:08,746 --> 00:58:12,128
And we'll just drive.
There's gotta be another road.

761
00:58:12,129 --> 00:58:13,644
Another way out of here.
- It won't work.

762
00:58:15,301 --> 00:58:18,954
Something will happen.
It will collapse, it will wash away.

763
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:20,772
Then we just leave
the roads altogether.

764
00:58:20,773 --> 00:58:25,551
Drive as far as we can into the
forest and we go on foot from there.

765
00:58:27,063 --> 00:58:29,074
You're missing the point.

766
00:58:29,075 --> 00:58:33,533
Please, do not go nuts on me,
okay, Dana? You're all I've got, now.

767
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,745
I'm okay.

768
00:58:38,746 --> 00:58:40,549
Good, okay, 'cause I need you calm.

769
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:41,510
Okay, no matter what happens,
we gotta stay..

770
00:59:39,345 --> 00:59:41,239
Goddamn, that was close!

771
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,968
Yeah, photo-fucking-finish.

772
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:44,197
I don't understand.

773
00:59:44,198 --> 00:59:45,873
You're celebrating?

774
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:48,711
They're celebrating. I'm drinking.

775
00:59:48,712 --> 00:59:50,429
But she's still alive.

776
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:52,293
How can the ritual be complete?

777
00:59:52,294 --> 00:59:54,721
The virgin's death is optional,
as long as it's last.

778
00:59:54,722 --> 00:59:57,515
Main thing is that she suffers.

779
00:59:57,516 --> 00:59:58,958
That she did.

780
01:00:00,366 --> 01:00:02,331
It's so strange.

781
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,533
I'm actually rooting for this girl.

782
01:00:05,534 --> 01:00:07,617
She's got so much heart.

783
01:00:07,618 --> 01:00:11,227
And you think of
all the pain and the..

784
01:00:11,228 --> 01:00:15,763
Tequila is my lady! My lady!

785
01:00:15,764 --> 01:00:18,323
Come on in, guys!
Come on in. You're welcome.

786
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:21,753
Tequila!
From darkness, there is light!

787
01:01:26,305 --> 01:01:28,069
I wish that I could do what you do.

788
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:30,216
Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it's masterful.

789
01:01:30,217 --> 01:01:33,556
I don't know.
Tonight was solid. I don't know.

790
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:36,469
Are you kidding? Classic denouement.
When the van hits the lake..

791
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:37,303
I screamed.

792
01:01:37,304 --> 01:01:39,747
And the water rushing in,
and the zombies..

793
01:01:39,748 --> 01:01:42,139
just think it would've
been cooler with a merman.

794
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,606
Do you know if we get
the overtime bonus on this one?

795
01:01:44,607 --> 01:01:47,009
Accounting's over there. Ask them.

796
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:49,442
I don't need to.
I already know the answer.

797
01:01:49,443 --> 01:01:50,424
I'm an intern.

798
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:54,911
So I don't qualify for OT.

799
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:57,043
It's funny that you like the ballet..

800
01:01:57,044 --> 01:02:01,516
because I happen to have
two tickets to your favorite..

801
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:05,281
You knuckleheads.

802
01:02:05,282 --> 01:02:07,474
You almost gave me a
heart attack with that tunnel.

803
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:10,090
Like I said, it wasn't our fault.
We didn't get the order.

804
01:02:10,091 --> 01:02:12,196
I'm just giving you a hard time.

805
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:15,276
Come on. Give us a hug.

806
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:17,358
No, seriously. That wasn't our fault.

807
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,037
There was a glitch.
Power re-route from upstairs.

808
01:02:21,381 --> 01:02:23,500
What do you mean, upstairs?

809
01:02:34,223 --> 01:02:37,382
Turn the fucking music off.

810
01:02:51,644 --> 01:02:52,649
Hello?

811
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:55,594
That's impossible. Everything
was done within the guidelines.

812
01:02:55,595 --> 01:02:57,180
The virgin's the only one..

813
01:02:57,181 --> 01:03:00,455
No. I am not doubting you.

814
01:03:03,632 --> 01:03:04,619
Which one?

815
01:03:45,032 --> 01:03:46,550
Marty.
- Hi.

816
01:03:52,777 --> 01:03:54,008
Dana, come on.

817
01:04:18,532 --> 01:04:19,828
Marty. Wait.

818
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:21,178
We're going in the grave?

819
01:04:22,503 --> 01:04:25,414
Dana, come on!

820
01:04:40,974 --> 01:04:42,151
What is this place?

821
01:04:45,388 --> 01:04:51,030
Yeah. I had to dismember
that guy with a trowel.

822
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:55,417
What have you been up to?

823
01:04:59,779 --> 01:05:01,726
Nobody else, huh?

824
01:05:07,749 --> 01:05:09,394
Yeah, I figured.

825
01:05:10,885 --> 01:05:12,885
You figured everything.

826
01:05:12,886 --> 01:05:14,527
Oh, not at all.

827
01:05:14,528 --> 01:05:17,874
But, I do know some stuff.

828
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:19,437
As in..

829
01:05:23,694 --> 01:05:26,348
It's an elevator.

830
01:05:26,349 --> 01:05:30,347
Somebody sent those dead
fucks up here to get us.

831
01:05:30,348 --> 01:05:35,422
Now, there's no controls inside, but
there's maintenance overrides in there.

832
01:05:35,422 --> 01:05:37,832
And I think I can get it to go down.

833
01:05:39,043 --> 01:05:40,659
Do we wanna go down?

834
01:05:43,279 --> 01:05:44,991
Where else are we gonna go?

835
01:05:48,243 --> 01:05:51,917
Come on. Get in.

836
01:06:04,137 --> 01:06:04,844
Come on!

837
01:06:05,191 --> 01:06:06,727
Fucking zombie arm.

838
01:06:06,956 --> 01:06:08,415
Oh, shit.

839
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:13,968
We chose.

840
01:08:13,934 --> 01:08:16,464
What? What?

841
01:08:16,465 --> 01:08:17,288
Fuck!

842
01:08:25,141 --> 01:08:30,553
All that shit we were playing with.

843
01:08:30,554 --> 01:08:32,575
They made us choose.

844
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:36,623
They made us choose how we die.

845
01:09:14,045 --> 01:09:16,332
We saw them go down the access drop.
They have to be in one of these.

846
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:17,708
Internal security can..

847
01:09:17,709 --> 01:09:21,040
I don't care if it's not protocol.
Are you fucking high?

848
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:23,252
It's the fool! Do not touch the girl.

849
01:09:23,253 --> 01:09:25,332
If he outlives her,
this whole thing goes to hell.

850
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:26,882
Take him out first.

851
01:09:26,883 --> 01:09:29,014
Cleanup says the prep team
missed one of the kid's stashes.

852
01:09:29,015 --> 01:09:31,845
Whatever he's been smoking's
been immunizing him to all our shit.

853
01:09:31,846 --> 01:09:33,372
How does that help us right now? What?

854
01:09:33,373 --> 01:09:36,483
No, if you have a confirmed kill,
take her out, too.

855
01:09:36,484 --> 01:09:37,541
There.

856
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:39,272
3606.

857
01:09:40,657 --> 01:09:41,693
Gotcha.

858
01:09:41,694 --> 01:09:43,046
Bring 'em down.

859
01:10:00,634 --> 01:10:03,258
Step out of the elevator!
Step out of the elevator!

860
01:10:03,259 --> 01:10:06,218
Why are you trying to kill us?
- Step out! Just the girl!

861
01:10:06,219 --> 01:10:07,584
What? -Just me?

862
01:10:07,585 --> 01:10:08,455
Do it!

863
01:10:19,352 --> 01:10:20,638
Good work, zombie arm.

864
01:10:44,832 --> 01:10:46,138
You shouldn't be here.

865
01:10:48,726 --> 01:10:50,852
This should've gone differently.

866
01:10:50,853 --> 01:10:52,501
Ended more quickly.

867
01:10:52,502 --> 01:10:56,627
I can only imagine
your pain and confusion.

868
01:10:56,628 --> 01:10:58,303
But know this.

869
01:10:58,304 --> 01:11:02,450
What's happening to you
is part of something bigger.

870
01:11:02,451 --> 01:11:04,828
Something older than anything known.

871
01:11:04,829 --> 01:11:08,876
You've seen horrible things.

872
01:11:08,877 --> 01:11:11,597
An army of nightmare creatures.

873
01:11:11,598 --> 01:11:14,806
But they are nothing
compared to what came before.

874
01:11:14,807 --> 01:11:17,054
What lies below.

875
01:11:18,519 --> 01:11:22,309
It's our task to placate
the ancient ones.

876
01:11:23,703 --> 01:11:26,338
As it's yours to
be offered up to them.

877
01:11:27,737 --> 01:11:29,017
Forgive us.

878
01:11:29,017 --> 01:11:31,049
And let us get it over with.

879
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:34,248
Come on. Go in that room.

880
01:11:55,429 --> 01:11:57,190
Army of nightmares, huh?

881
01:12:06,167 --> 01:12:07,582
Let's get this party started.

882
01:12:09,386 --> 01:12:10,247
Hold fire!

883
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:25,477
Oh, shit.

884
01:12:40,451 --> 01:12:42,391
Go! Go! Go!

885
01:13:52,078 --> 01:13:53,758
Lead officer Truman
to security command.

886
01:13:53,759 --> 01:13:57,830
Requesting immediate reinforcements.
Code black. I repeat, code black.

887
01:13:57,831 --> 01:13:59,544
Where the fuck are you guys?

888
01:13:59,545 --> 01:14:03,101
Sector 12, down. Sector 8, down.

889
01:14:03,102 --> 01:14:05,619
Sector 3, down. Jesus Christ!

890
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,815
Why aren't the defenses working?
Where's the fucking gas?

891
01:14:07,816 --> 01:14:10,162
Something chewed through the
connections in the utility shaft.

892
01:14:10,398 --> 01:14:12,075
Something which?
- Something scary!

893
01:14:44,202 --> 01:14:45,709
The north exit is blocked.
You can't go there.

894
01:15:07,905 --> 01:15:09,373
Go, go, go!

895
01:15:59,512 --> 01:16:00,434
Fuck! We're running out of time!

896
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:01,719
It's on lockdown,
I'm trying to bypass.

897
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,499
Hadley!

898
01:16:45,258 --> 01:16:47,565
Oh, come on!

899
01:17:26,165 --> 01:17:27,299
It's you.

900
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:35,403
No, no, no. Please, please.

901
01:17:39,223 --> 01:17:40,869
Kill him.

902
01:17:49,051 --> 01:17:50,109
Okay, Dana, come on.

903
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:51,539
Dana.

904
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,888
Here. It's easier with this.

905
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:00,392
Look at these.

906
01:19:03,012 --> 01:19:05,030
Five of them.

907
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:06,819
What are they?

908
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,826
Us.

909
01:19:10,827 --> 01:19:13,331
I should have seen it like you did.

910
01:19:15,091 --> 01:19:17,415
This is part of a ritual.

911
01:19:17,416 --> 01:19:20,219
A ritual sacrifice?

912
01:19:22,369 --> 01:19:23,466
Great.

913
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:29,301
You tie someone to a stone, get a
fancy dagger and a bunch of robes.

914
01:19:29,302 --> 01:19:31,659
Is that that complicated?
- No.

915
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:32,957
It's simple.

916
01:19:32,958 --> 01:19:35,560
They don't just want to see us killed.

917
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,104
They want to see us punished.

918
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:42,702
Punished for what?

919
01:19:42,703 --> 01:19:45,075
For being young.

920
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:53,543
It's different in every culture.

921
01:19:53,544 --> 01:19:55,877
And it has changed over the years..

922
01:19:55,878 --> 01:19:58,802
but it has always required youth.

923
01:19:58,802 --> 01:20:01,994
There must be at least five.

924
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,861
The whore.

925
01:20:04,862 --> 01:20:06,523
She's corrupted.

926
01:20:06,524 --> 01:20:08,097
She dies first.

927
01:20:08,098 --> 01:20:10,954
The athlete.

928
01:20:10,955 --> 01:20:14,026
The scholar.

929
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:16,864
The fool.

930
01:20:16,865 --> 01:20:20,183
All suffer and die at the hands of..

931
01:20:20,184 --> 01:20:22,560
whatever horror they have raised..

932
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:26,258
leaving the last, to live or die..

933
01:20:26,259 --> 01:20:28,576
.. as fate decides.

934
01:20:30,682 --> 01:20:32,186
The virgin.

935
01:20:33,648 --> 01:20:35,102
Me?

936
01:20:35,103 --> 01:20:37,075
Virgin?

937
01:20:37,076 --> 01:20:39,383
We work with what we have.

938
01:20:39,384 --> 01:20:42,074
But what if you don't pull it off?

939
01:20:42,075 --> 01:20:42,981
They rise.

940
01:20:42,982 --> 01:20:44,027
Who does?

941
01:20:45,292 --> 01:20:47,258
What's beneath us?

942
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,630
The ancient ones.

943
01:20:48,631 --> 01:20:51,062
The gods that used to rule the Earth.

944
01:20:51,063 --> 01:20:55,079
As long as they accept
our sacrifice, they remain below.

945
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,896
But the other rituals have all failed.

946
01:21:01,433 --> 01:21:02,795
The sun is coming up in eight minutes.

947
01:21:02,796 --> 01:21:06,040
If you live to see it,
the world will end.

948
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:08,404
Maybe that's the way it should be.

949
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:11,668
If you've got to kill all
my friends to survive..

950
01:21:11,669 --> 01:21:13,686
maybe it's time for a change.

951
01:21:13,687 --> 01:21:15,604
We're not talking about change.

952
01:21:15,605 --> 01:21:20,518
We're talking about the agonizing death
of every human soul on the planet.

953
01:21:20,519 --> 01:21:22,193
Including you.

954
01:21:22,194 --> 01:21:23,977
You can die with them..

955
01:21:25,789 --> 01:21:28,178
or you can die for them.

956
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:33,158
Gosh, they're both so enticing.

957
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:53,402
The whole world, Marty.

958
01:21:53,402 --> 01:21:55,485
Is in your hands, Dana.

959
01:21:55,486 --> 01:21:58,087
There is no other way.

960
01:21:58,088 --> 01:22:00,819
You have to be strong.

961
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:03,291
Yeah, Dana..

962
01:22:05,533 --> 01:22:06,770
you feeling strong?

963
01:22:08,816 --> 01:22:10,591
I'm sorry.

964
01:22:14,391 --> 01:22:15,421
So am I.

965
01:22:56,762 --> 01:22:57,990
Marty..

966
01:23:02,999 --> 01:23:04,339
Marty!

967
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:57,497
Hey.

968
01:24:00,597 --> 01:24:02,309
You know..

969
01:24:05,889 --> 01:24:08,074
I don't think Curt even has a cousin.

970
01:24:15,202 --> 01:24:17,173
How are you?

971
01:24:20,656 --> 01:24:22,352
Going away.

972
01:24:26,816 --> 01:24:28,205
I'm sorry.

973
01:24:30,057 --> 01:24:32,127
I'm so sorry I almost shot you.

974
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:35,265
I probably wouldn't have.

975
01:24:35,266 --> 01:24:36,971
Hey, no. No.

976
01:24:39,546 --> 01:24:40,603
I totally get it.

977
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:57,263
I'm sorry I let you get attacked by
a werewolf and then ended the world.

978
01:24:58,745 --> 01:24:59,540
No.

979
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:02,681
Hey, you were right.

980
01:25:04,178 --> 01:25:05,775
Humanity..

981
01:25:12,257 --> 01:25:15,270
It's time to give
someone else a chance.

982
01:25:27,091 --> 01:25:29,236
Giant evil gods.

983
01:25:34,351 --> 01:25:37,084
I wish I could've seen them.

984
01:25:37,085 --> 01:25:38,482
I know.

985
01:25:40,721 --> 01:25:43,655
That would have been a fun weekend.

986
01:25:44,621 --> 01:31:05,000
