1
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,061
Hormones play.

2
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:06,899
Normally I say not fast,
but it is women's issues.

3
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,985
Why "protected?"
With fences and stuff?

4
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,737
She has already secured the load ...

5
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:16,909
... We're not even expecting
and you get the load no longer open.

6
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:17,910
Not at all?

7
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:23,290
Only a crack. Terrible.
-Well, sooner or later ...

8
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,293
Much later, yes. She has only
the top drawers addressed.

9
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:31,048
The child can only be there for as
ie 30 is, as we have a child.

10
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,926
It is, of course, that they are
The kid wants to protect.

11
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,806
You think as a woman.
-Please, that you said something.

12
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:44,770
It is a bad omen. 'S Warranty
So we just do not get child.

13
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,272
And grab a beer now takes centuries.

14
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,275
Guys!
Stockholm is nothing.

15
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,112
Really?
'T It looked good anyway?

16
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,613
What went wrong?

17
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,199
I have not seen anything yet,
but that rumor.

18
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,328
No stable scenario. Everyone knows
Sweden that you can not trust.

19
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,081
That leaves Japan and so us.

20
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,291
Not for the first time.

21
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,419
And Japan is almost always successful.
-Then we better do our best.

22
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,548
Since 1998 we have
no more mistakes made.

23
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:16,301
We know what we do, Lin.
It is somewhere in black and white.

24
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,762
Don't blow it, guys.

25
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,432
Wed not you join us in pooltje
this year? Great effort, though.

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,643
I'm just saying
that "t is important.

27
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:29,273
In '98 went to the Department of Chemistry
the fog, right?

28
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,402
Where do you work again? Wait ...
it reminds me so well remembered.

29
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,866
That is' n long weekend
if everyone is tense.

30
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:44,496
Come Monday you? I'm all
cupboards and drawers repaired again.

31
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,957
Are you listening?

32
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:38,467
That jerk ... why does
his picture is not on your dartboard?

33
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,677
So simple is not it.

34
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,222
Your hair ... it's blonde.
-Beautiful, huh?

35
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,098
That you 't really have done ...

36
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,975
Is not it nice?

37
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,354
Give me right now,
otherwise I get very insecure.

38
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,773
It 's wonderful. Curt Wild is fixed.

39
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,651
Curt will be grateful to me.
And you know me ...

40
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,778
That picture ... if we burn.

41
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,071
Not yet ...

42
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,741
Really, it's not his fault.

43
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,368
What is not?

44
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,412
That he fucks a student
or that he 's e-mail part?

45
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,039
I knew what would happen, though.

46
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:13,543
You know what this weekend
going to happen?

47
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,212
This.

48
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,466
And if Holden indeed handsome,
who knows what else happens.

49
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:24,263
That 's the last thing I am after.
If that 's, I have no sense.

50
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,683
I force you to nothing,
but this is not so bad.

51
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,728
And we
no room for?

52
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,482
And if I'm bored now?
-Helping them?

53
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,153
Soviet economic structures?
Aftermath of the ...

54
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,156
We go for 't and a lot more beer.

55
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:47,160
No textbooks!
-You must be faster.

56
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,665
Sorry ... but by row.

57
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,750
Beautiful!
-Is that Holden?

58
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,210
We're coming.

59
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,670
He's new here.

60
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,506
The most convenient
player 's team. And nice.

61
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,550
And very handy with his hands.

62
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:06,555
I know a certain girl, but
you're much fairer than she is.

63
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,975
But now I'm still wondering ...
What do you need this?

64
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,727
How do you get that?

65
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,437
Good. I do not take books.

66
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,856
How did you get this?
Who taught you that?

67
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,108
You yourself, remember?

68
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,152
I got it just you cheated!

69
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,991
Professor Bennett says just
literally everything in this book.

70
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,202
This must read.

71
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,788
Gurovsky. Much more interesting.

72
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,915
And Bennet does not know this ...

73
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,626
So ... will he heavy
impressed by you.

74
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,211
And you have no pants on.

75
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,596
Is that all?
-I can 't hope.

76
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,390
It's a weekend,
no evacuation.

77
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:55,812
Believe me, with everything that is,
will you be happy.

78
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,022
I will not complain.

79
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,152
My God ...

80
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,408
Marty!

81
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,245
What ails you now?

82
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,962
The locals drive
really careless here.

83
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,006
I just wanted to lose.

84
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,260
Want this weekend in jail? We want
'S cottage, see my cousin.

85
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,887
This really can not.

86
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:35,685
The police never a man to
with 'n hash pipe in his car. And why?

87
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,523
Such a man they fear.
They know that he sees more ...

88
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,611
And ... that he will harass them
with ancient facts.

89
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,408
Have you suddenly gray hair?
-That thing is not in there.

90
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:57,874
Such a huge bong in the RV
your father? Are you stoned or something?

91
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,044
Hey, man.

92
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,090
Dana, good thing!

93
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,758
Did you eat at you?

94
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,137
Everybody ready?

95
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,014
I'm ready!

96
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,558
Go ahead!

97
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,080
Everyone is gone.
Right on time.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,876
I hope we can ride well.

99
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,838
It is not even on the GPS.
So small it is.

100
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:49,301
That was the intention?
To be away from it all?

101
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:54,264
No mobile reception,
no flash cameras.

102
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:59,853
Finally somewhere where they
my position can not fathom.

103
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,730
The point is this ...

104
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:06,485
Does the company set, Marty?
-No, she binds.

105
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,654
Everything is filled with concrete.

106
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:14,367
And everything is recorded,
recorded or blogged, right?

107
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,954
Chips in cobblestones,
so they do not get lost.

108
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:23,084
The society had to be loosened.
But we are just too busy or fearful.

109
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,212
I really missed your rantings.

110
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,590
Someday you 't agree with me.

111
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,555
Legitimacy, please.

112
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,643
Mr. Sitterson.

113
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,062
Mr. Hadley.
-Thank you.

114
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,022
What is your name?
Truman-Daniel, sir.

115
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:50,070
This is the army not. But Sitterson
is like 'madam' named.

116
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,491
Or "honeybun.
-It is also possible. We understand everything here?

117
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,825
I am fully informed.

118
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:59,162
That does not necessarily
that you are prepared.

119
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,707
I leave my post is not, Mr. Hadley.
-Good.

120
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,211
'S system is online.

121
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,549
Enter the target.
Let us see ...

122
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,753
I do not want them
accept credit cards.

123
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:54,926
I think they do accept
no money. They come to barter.

124
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,212
Holden?
-I think no ...

125
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,631
Has anyone invited?

126
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,348
There is still "CLOSED"?

127
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:46,186
We wanted to refuel.
Does that pump?

128
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,188
If you know how to get him to operate.

129
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:53,443
We also wanted to ask for directions.
-We are looking ... what's it?

130
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,488
Tillerman Road.
Is it this way?

131
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:04,954
Tillerman Road goes uphill.
And dead ends at the hut of Buckner.

132
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:09,125
My cousin has it 's house purchased.
There is a mountain tunnel, and a lake.

133
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,211
That hut Buckner.

134
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,923
Which is quite often for sale.

135
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,843
You have known the owners?
-Yes, but not the first.

136
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,973
I have seen many come and go.
I've lived here since the war.

137
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,601
Which war?
-You know very well!

138
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:32,691
Had that sometimes something that Civil War
to make North against South?

139
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,194
Brother vs. brother? That war?

140
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,364
Will you take me the piss, boy?
-You were rude to my girlfriend.

141
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,909
That whore?

142
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,453
Pardon?
-We have enough petrol.

143
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,247
Enough to get there.

144
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,418
How you come back,
is your problem.

145
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:11,146
Good luck with your business.
Soon also stop 'n train here.

146
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:15,024
Maybe you even get asphalt.

147
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,193
Asshole ...

148
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,524
Guys, look.

149
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,480
This should 't be.

150
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,538
My God, it's ... wonderful.

151
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:56,376
A spider and I sleep in the car.
I'm serious.

152
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,086
Help me out here.

153
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,771
Fantastic.
- 'T Do something.

154
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:03,026
Shoot your such a raccoon for supper?
-Then I make a pet of his fur.

155
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,197
Everyone dress; about 1 0
minute we go to the lake.

156
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,784
I did not know we sporty
were doing.

157
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,846
Do not think so ...

158
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,987
That can not ...

159
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,473
This is really happening.

160
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,524
Wait!

161
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,990
You're kidding ...
-Scary ...

162
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:37,620
There were other times, people had
make their own interrogation rooms.

163
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:41,958
From whom did your cousin bought this?
-Let's check the other rooms also.

164
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,003
For Marty sees us like to rant.

165
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,841
I will not even hear.
-Do not be silly, Curt.

166
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,345
Shall we swap rooms?

167
00:16:55,556 --> 00:17:00,727
Not that I'm ... I hang 't painting
come back, but would you rather trade?

168
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,145
Sure, yes.

169
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,942
Thank you so politely.

170
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,779
That 's the least I can do,
Now Curt and Jules us to connect.

171
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,160
Very subtly they are not.
-I'm flattered and I love 't stop.

172
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:21,873
I'm looking for ... oh no,
I'm glad you're not a creep.

173
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:27,211
Do not jump to conclusions,
because I doubted pretty.

174
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,048
Severe doubt, torn
between two opinions.

175
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,760
So you suffer severe pain?
-Pretty.

176
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,930
Jules is studying medicine.
Talk to her.

177
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,945
Do not think so ...

178
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,263
I like my room.

179
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,059
Everyone in position.
The cameras run.

180
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:09,939
There is a change of the room.
Polk is now in 2, McCrea in 4.

181
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,859
Confirm that you are here?
'T scenario has changed.

182
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,735
Miss Lin?

183
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:20,074
We have the results within.
Loudens blood levels are good.

184
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:24,453
We recommend Rhohyptase to 50mg,
her libido.

185
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,373
We do.
-Through the grille, or orally?

186
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,835
Ask that again, but slower.
-Boar.

187
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,131
Guess how her responses slow?
-No idea.

188
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,178
The color rinse.
-The dumb blonde. Very ingenious.

189
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:45,183
Through the blood and hair.
Very gradually.

190
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,312
The Chemistry Department is doing a fine job.
-Seeing is believing.

191
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,355
Central?
-Go ahead.

192
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:57,320
The man 's petrol station on line 2.
-Could you take a message?

193
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:01,365
Well, he insists rather on.
-Absolutely not.

194
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:06,954
I am frankly crazy 'm
-Well, connect on.

195
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,999
Mordecai, how you doin?
What's up with you again?

196
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,170
The lambs are inside.
Ready for slaughter.

197
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,422
You do good work.

198

View by appointment; good work
so far. We still talk to you, okay?

199
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,891
They see the coming horrors not
arrive. They are all deaf.

200
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,185
They are God's fools.

201
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,605
So does it work it is.

202
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,859
Remove them and clean the world
their ignorance and sin.

203
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:41,072
Leave them bathed in the crimson ...
I stand on the speaker?

204
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,118
Absolutely not. On the speaker?
I would never do.

205
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,871
Welwaar, I can hear the echo.

206
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,625
God, you're right.
Wait, I'm getting you off.

207
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,753
That is rude.
I do not know who's listening.

208
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,674
You're off.
-Thank you.

209
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:04,095
Listen to me, boy.
Not everything is according to 't gone booklet.

210
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:09,725
The fool did the spell almost
failure by his impudence.

211
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:13,437
The ancients see everything.
And they will not ...

212
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,357
I am still on the speaker, right?

213
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:23,155
My God ... Mordecai.
Well I do 't again.

214
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,116
Mordy?

215
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,118
And what is gonna happen?

216
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,544
That's cold!

217
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,007
How cold? Is it worth the trouble?

218
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,051
Come on, Jules. You must risk
courage to take.

219
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,637
I'll stay here but
in the sun.

220
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,016
What is that?
-What?

221
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,350
In the lake there.

222
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,769
Oh, stop it.
-I mean it ... over there.

223
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,938
That seems to be my friend!

224
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,486
There is something else 's more!

225
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,699
'N Attractive man!
-I kill you!

226
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,076
No, we are an endangered
species!

Do you say, Aqua Man.

232
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,686
Why?
-Nothing ...

233
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,231
Well then, I wonder
or that there is between.

234
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,942
According to the Department of Zoology is.
-They can not know.

235
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,905
Who are you betting?

236
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,365
They have been forgiven.

237
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,992
Who then?
-Maintenance Department.

238
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,078
They choose the same every year.

239
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:57,625
Pity. If they were creative, did
they do not care. Would you trade?

240
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:04,715
I do not know. What do you think?
-I want this particular call.

241
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,723
Wed're not coming?
-Not me, thank you.

242
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:18,562
This seems rather cruel, right?
Ah, they blow off some steam.

243
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:23,359
This job is no piece of cake,
also how they behave.

244
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,654
Does the director ... what is
going down?

245
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:32,326
So what? As long as everything goes well above
and those kids do what they said.

246
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,786
Then the outcome is fixed.

247
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,541
How can you gamble when you
controlled the outcome?

248
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,043
We bring them to the basement.
Furthermore, 't to them.

249
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:45,840
They make the choice of free will.
Otherwise the system.

250
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:51,929
As our informant: he bears some
'N sign around his neck with "You Are Dead'.

251
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,640
Why is he there?
By the system.

252
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,269
They can ignore him, and they can
choose what happens in the basement.

253
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:03,232
We manipulate a lot, but if they
still make the wrong choice ...

254
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:09,113
Then they are not punished.
What is' t, Truman? You in?

255
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,782
Never mind.

256
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,247
We go for it!
The stakes are closed.

257
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,083
Then the party begin!

258
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,793
'T party begin!

259
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,558
My turn.

260
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,316
Truth or Dare?
- Make it 'Dare'

261
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:51,739
I dare you to kiss with tongue ...
-Tell me Dana.

262
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,657
That ... moose there.

263
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,413
Marty, have you ever
'N moose seen?

264
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:05,252
Whatever that beast is.
-That's a wolf.

265
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,507
I'm popping high,
Leave me alone.

266
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,386
I challenge you to tongue kiss
with the wolf.

267
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,097
No problem.

268
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,831
Who?

269
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,875
I?

270
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,505
I am new to the neighborhood.
How did you know?

271
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:55,553
How sweet of you to say.
I 've just recently painted.

272
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,558
You do not have to blow down.

273
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,352
I leave you so called within.

274
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,636
Thank you.

275
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,650
And now ...

276
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,737
... Dana.
- 'Truth'.

277
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,823
What does that mean?

278
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,659
I skip a step on.
You're called 'dare' to say.

279
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:07,416
Then she challenges you from doing something nasty,
and then scratch your back again.

280
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,417
Really?

281
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,964
Okay, Jules ... 'Dare'

282
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,383
What was that?

283
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,302
The cellar door.

284
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,055
That must have been the wind.

285
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,308
And where it refers to?

286
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,894
What would be down there?

287
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,608
Why study it not?

288
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,486
Dana?

289
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,489
I challenge you.

290
00:27:54,923 --> 00:28:00,010
How long should I stay here?
Until tomorrow morning.

291
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,422
Dana?

292
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,632
Are you okay?

293
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,596
I was shocked.

294
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,892
You called 'help'. So you lose.
Take off your shirt.

295
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,895
What? I'm not making the rules.

296
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,775

297
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,071
Do you see that shit ...

298

299
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:10,873

here below in order to be.

Cousin who loves you, strange
hobbies after.

302
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,258
I do not think this is his.

303
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:25,304
Maybe those same people
such as those of the mirror.

304
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,603
Some things seem to be very old.
-Superb ...

305
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,735
Maybe we should
but go back up.

306
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,658
I challenge you
to go up.

307
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,296
Guys?

308
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,716

00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:21,378
"Judah told him that Matthew
Black Chamber spent. So he's dead. "

316
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,466
"I want the glory of the pain
understand, like Matthew ... "

317
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:34,308
'... But by in' t meat to be cut receives
he has an erection, and I can not. "

318
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,810
Do you want to stop?
-Continue.

319
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,937
Why?
-I want to know.

320
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:44,818
"I will not yet found in the old
books, to protect our family. "

321
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:50,908
"My schrijfarm is maimed and half
eaten, so hopefully this is readable.

322
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:55,037
"So there is a believer
and this read aloud ... "

323
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:59,833
"... So we will be resurrected
and the great pain will return. "

324
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,503
Here is something in Latin.

325
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:08,383
Okay, here I draw the line.
That you should not read Latin.

326
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,218
Read it ...

327
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,931
What was that?
- ... Out loud.

328
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,599
"Dolor ..."

329
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,142
Do not be so childish.

330
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,063
It's only a diary.
-It means nothing.

331
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,399
"Dolor vivo super caro ..."

332
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,738
"... Dolor Sublimis caro."

333
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:34,534
"Dolor ignio annivos ..."

334
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,610
We have a winner!
The Buckner family!

335
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,321
The Buck Fasteners grab the prize.

336
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:17,035
Then our congratulations
to the Maintenance Department.

337
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,998
The pot must share
Ronald, the trainee.

338
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,292
That is unfair.
I also had zombies.

339
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,548
You had indeed zombies, yes. But
This is' Zombie Redneck Family Martel.

340
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:34,386
A sort itself. The same difference
as between a lion and a sea lion.

341
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,889
Better luck next year.

342
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,517
They seem like a nightmare to come.

343
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,938
No. They are the nightmare itself.

344
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:49,234
Everything in our cells are remnants
of the ancient world ...

345
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,571
Thanks ... you know who.

346
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,575
Monsters ... magic ... gods.

347
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,535
You get used to.

348
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,788
Would it have to?

349
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,967
Sorry, man.
-He had the shell in his hands.

350
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,054
Who knows what about a couple
minutes was done?

351
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,973
I will never
'N merman see.

352
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,393
Be happy. Those things are
deterrent.

353
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,354
And clean up their mess
is a nightmare.

354
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,524
Okay, so the Buck Fasteners.

355
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:33,820
They are perhaps a bunch
sadistic, retarded zombies ...

356
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:37,616
But they are ... our sadistic,
retarded zombies.

357
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:42,370
With a guaranteed January 00%. score.
-That is true. Should we call Japan?

358
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,666
That she spent the rest of 't take weekend off?
-What did you think? Japanese who do not work?

359
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:50,754
I want once they see their bill go.
-If that could ...

360
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:56,093
But everyone except the Japanese
fails. There is too much from here.

361
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:44,724
Class, you know.
-Like you would not want this.

362
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,270
Can we're talking about something else?

363
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,940
Do you feel lonely, Marty?

364
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,946
Marty and I went together
as a freshman.

365
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,949
We once kissed.

366
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,451
I have never bought that ring.

367
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,037
But we are still ...

368
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,374
... Close.

369
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,547
I have about a theory.

370
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:20,510
Then we can pack.
Tommy Chong has a theory.

371
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,220
Go ahead, honey.

372
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:28,101
Tell 't that nerd but, if he' s not
too busy with Dana to deflower.

373
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,437
Jules, would not you rather lie down?

374
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:34,941
That is exactly the intention. Come on!
Comma-Deer me that.

375
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,902
That way, baby.

376
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:02,177
Do you really believe there is nothing strange
is going on?

377
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,221
'N Conspiracy?

378
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:09,976
As everyone behaves.
Why does Jules suddenly so stupid?

379
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:14,564
And since when Curt behaves
himself as the alpha male?

380
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,651
He studied sociology.

381
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:22,572
'N Academician,
and he calls his friend a nerd?

382
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,449
Curt's just drunk.

383
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,452
I have seen Curt drunk.

384
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,287
Jules also.

385
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,290
Well, perhaps it 's something else.

386
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,045
You do not see what you do not want to see.

387
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,757
Puppeteers.

388
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,425
Puppeteers?

389
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,053
What? Did you say Pop-Tart pastries?

390
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:50,392
Marty, I love you,
but you're really high.

391
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,313
We are not who we are.

392
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:02,237
I ga 's comic book reading.

393
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,405
Thank you.

394
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,907
"The pain transcends the flesh ..."

395
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:10,245
"The flesh will return '
or a meeting. "

396
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,915
What is that?
- 'T Latin that you read in the basement.

397
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,625
Do you speak Latin?

398
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,963
Not good. Not since
high school.

399
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,715
Funny how everything comes back.

400
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,302
It is also 'n strange evening.

401
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,014
Sorry about tonight. Everyone ...

402
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,726
I lose points if I say
that I was good entertainment?

403
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,981
It's okay to say.

404
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,406
Why are you leaving?

405
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:57,125
Not spill over me!
-Is there now beer on your shirt?

406
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,086
Then you 'm off.

407
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,257
Not here.

408
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,926
Come on, honey.

409
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,137
We're alone.

410
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,065
I'm talking cold.

411
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,528
For example, he is again. Way!
We need to work.

412
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,531
I loathe you low needs.
Get out.

413
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,451
We have temperature control?
Am I doing.

414
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,542
Spread pheromones fog.

415
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,946
It's so dark.
Can we go inside?

416
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,615
Why are we here anyway?

417
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,702
It is romantic.

418
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,473
Let your boobs but me see.

419
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,559
Let the merchandise 's see.

420
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,397
Do we really watch?
-We are not alone.

421
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,024
The customer must be satisfied.

422
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,069
Do you understand what's at stake is?

423
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,573
And touch.

424
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,273
Jules!

425
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:35,760
Curt!

426
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,935
This sacrifice we in humility
and anxiety.

427
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,522
<font color="#FFFF00">GlowGaze.Com</font>
























For the blessed peace
of your eternal slumber.

428
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,026
As it always was.

429
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:27,622
Nemo, wake up.
Everything is upside down.

430
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:33,044
I ga 'n walk ...

431
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:37,340
I swear I hear someone talking.

432
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,347
I know it almost certainly.

433
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,475
I ga 'n walk ...

434
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,435
Enough!

435
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,938
Say what?

436
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,232
What do you want?

437
00:44:55,818 --> 00:45:00,113
You think I'm n puppet, huh?

438
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,449
That I dance n do for you!

439
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:07,120
I am the master of my own brain,
so keep it.

440
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,042
I ga 'n walk.

441
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,804
I do not want?

442
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,140
I've never seen?

443
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,934
I do not mean 'never'?

444
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,771
We do nothing you do not want.

445
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,902
He has an erection ...

446
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,590
I thought there would be stars.

447
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,929
We are left in the lurch.

448
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,166
Run!

449
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,878
Dirty bitch!

450
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,012
What is this?
-Are you hurt?

451
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,138
Is all that blood from you?

452
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,724
You are safe!

453
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,392
Where's Jules?

454
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,730
She is dead.

455
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,900
We must leave.

456
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,904
Dana, do not open ...

457
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,491
I'm not leaving here without Jules.
-That girl is dead there!

458
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,056
Dana, come on!

459
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:37,979
What is that thing?

460
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,649
There are many more.
-Anyone else?

461
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,695
I saw one young girl. All
of those zombies like him ...

462
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,280
An arm ... but she missed.

463
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:51,075
Oh, my God ... Patience.

464
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,286
The diary?

465
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,413
We must close the deal here.
-He's right.

466
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,708
From room to room. We barricade
every window and every door.

467
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:03,087
We take no risks. What is also
happens, we should stick together.

468
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,426
Calm. Look how the master
this approach.

469
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,106
This is not right.
-What is it?

470
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,444
This is not good.
We have split.

471
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,488
Then we can work more efficiently.

472
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,702
Good idea.

473
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:35,912
Really?

474
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,998
Guys, get your room.

475
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,630
Connect them but.

476
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,888
Now what the hell ...

477
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,829
What the what?

478
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,832
This is not good.
-Move!

479
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:26,170
Department of Chemistry. I have 500cc
Thorazine needed in room 3.

480
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,298
Wait a minute.

481
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,343
Judah Bruckner shoot us all to help.

482
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,602
What ... the hell ...

483
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:52,071
My God,
I'm in 's reality TV show.

484
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,160
My parents will me
like a drug user to see.

485
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:49,170
Help me!

486
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:19,116
'T is permanently exciting down there.
-Greatest Show on Earth.

487
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,890
Come on!

488
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,858
Use the bed!

489
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,157
Holden?

490
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,877
It's empty.
-Go ahead.

491
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,006
Curt?
-Close the door of the castle.

492
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,716
Go to the basement!

493
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,403
This is the Black Chamber.

494
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,613
Enjoyed it.

495
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,993
From 's diary.

496
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,164
Here are the people slain.

497
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,917
And he will kill us.

498
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,003
Absolutely not.

499
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,798
He will not murder.
We just have 'n door search.

500
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,138
Check the walls, right?

501
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,474
Curt?

502
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,642
A ...

503
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,203
Do you like pain?

504
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,292
How does that feel?

505
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:00,236
Fucking zombies. Previously it was still just
A girl in 'n volcano throwing.

506
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,321
How old do you think I am?

507
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,498
Come!

508
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,722
Where is Marty?
-They have 'm

509
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,634
The evil is defeated.

510
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:09,722
Now living Kiko's spirit continues
in the happy frog.

511
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,356
Fuck you!

512
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,985
Val all but dead!

513
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,365
See this?
-Perfect score, eh?

514
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,035
That had the Japs have to finish.

515
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:34,663
How difficult is it to 9-year olds to kill?
-Nobody slain. Total failure.

516
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,459
If you want something good,
should you do it American style do.

517
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,297
Heard from below?
Japan-leave them cold. They trust us.

518
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:50,179
Do your work, Lin. While they
celebrate, we store increases.

519
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:55,351
And that weed then? He hears crackling high
, but he had us almost through.

520
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,769
We had to be even more strengthened.

521
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:59,229
The camper is on the way to the tunnel.

522
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:04,610
That jerk is dead. And we also
if we do not control.

523
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,862
Shit ...
-Why?

524
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,946
I have work to do.

525
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:10,783
You are our last hope.
If the ancients awakening ...

526
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,578
There is no blockade.
That cunt tunnel is open!

527
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,415
Checking for demolition.
- We can not reach it.

528
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,084
Try to go around.
-I am busy.

529
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,293
Open the door.

530
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:34,390
Move! Make room!

531
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:42,606
What is happening?
-No idea. There had to be current.

532
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,609
That tunnel had to be inflated.
- 'T Command has never come through.

533
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,406
There!

534
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,499
Hadley, what happens?

535
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,545
Why is the tunnel
not inflated?

536
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,765
That can not fuck!

537
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,854
This may not be true ...

538
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,607
That's it.

539
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:11,528
We climb stuff? Ropes?
-At home, yes.

540
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,490
Return never succeed.

541
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,867
What do we do now? Jumping?

542
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,622
What?

543
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,380
Curt, do you sure?
-I have bigger jumps.

544
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:34,218
With a good run, you may have
1 ½ meter margin on the other side.

545
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,345
But at full speed.

546
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,263
Curt?

547
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:44,645
You stay in the camper.
I should get help.

548
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:50,067
And if I fall, I hop to help.
But I come back here.

549
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,986
I'll be back with police
and helicopters ...

550
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:56,782
And ... big guns, and those things
will pay.

551
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,993
For Jules.

552
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,671
Do you not.

553
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,507
Never.

554
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:40,867
Curt!

555
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,590
He hit something. But what then?

556
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,802
Puppeteers ...

557
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,973
Marty was right.

558
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,183
Ga in the camper.

559
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:08,979
Dana!

560
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:16,111
Marty was right.

561
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,382
You go back.
-I go through it.

562
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:42,429
There's gotta be another way. 'N Way Out.
-Probably not.

563
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:48,101
There must be something happening;
it is undoubtedly wrong.

564
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,937
Then let the road but
behind us.

565
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:55,859
We go into the forest and go
than on foot.

566
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,820
You got it not.

567
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:03,867
Lettuce's not quite through, huh?
You're all I have left.

568
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:08,872
'T Not much.

569
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,041
I want you continues to be governed.

570
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,544
Whatever happens ...

571
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:16,189
Damn, that nothing was wrong.
-That was a photo finish, yes.

572
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:19,109
I do not understand.
Do you have something to celebrate?

573
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,862
They do, I'm drinking.

574
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:25,115
But she's still alive. Then it is ritual
still not complete?

575
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:28,493
The death of the virgin
optional ...

576
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:31,204
... What matters,
is that they must suffer.

577
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,165
And she did.

578
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:42,215
So strange, I almost hope that she gets up.
She has so much perseverance.

579
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:46,303
And you think they all hurt ...

580
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,765
.. Tequila is my mistress!

581
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,392
Come inside.
You are welcome.

582
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,396
Tequila brings light ...
in the darkness!

583
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:08,176
<font color="#FFFF00">GlowGaze.Com</font>
























I wish I could what you can.
It is truly masterful.

584
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,595
Alas, it was nice tonight.

585
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:13,682
What? This was a classic.
When that truck went into the lake ...

586
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,519
I screamed. That flowing in
water, zombies ...

587
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,939
But it was even cooler was
with a merman.

588
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:25,569
We get 'n overtime bonus?
-An acquired accounting questions.

589
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:29,948
I know 't answer al
-I am an intern.

590
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:33,618
I get no overtime anyway.

591
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:40,292
Funny that you love loves ballet,
because I happen to 2 tickets ...

592
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:46,256
Idiots ... I got some
a heart attack of that tunnel.

593
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,676
That was not our fault. We have
never been commissioned.

594
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,721
I am to you but rods.

595
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,348
Come here.

596
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:56,892
That was not our fault.

597
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,645
Technical fault. lets with
'S power failure there.

598
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,149
Why 'up there? "

599
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,329
Put that fucking music.

600
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,306
Can not, everything went
according to 't book.

601
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,558
The virgin is the only one ...

602
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:42,687
No, I do not doubt you.

603
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:45,857
Who?

604
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:29,526
Marty?

605
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,118
Dana, come on.

606
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:06,604
Marty, wait.
Are we in the grave?

607
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,567
Dana, come on!

608
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:27,709
What is this?

609
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:38,136
The guy I had
into pieces.

610
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,097
Zaal What have you been up to?

611
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:48,313
Furthermore, no one, huh?

612
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:57,072
What I thought

613
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,491
You had it much earlier on.

614
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,743
Not at all.

615
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,704
But I just know
certain things.

616
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:07,415
Like, uh ...

617
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,671
That's a lift.

618
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:17,759
Someone has zombies
sent to us.

619
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:26,768
There are no buttons, but
cables. So we can down.

620
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,687
Do we want that?

621
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,067
Where should we go?

622
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,365
Step inside.

623
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:53,586
Come on!

624
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:55,797
Fucking zombie arm ...

625
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,263
We have chosen ...

626
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:10,848
What?

627
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:15,353
Damn!

628
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,068
In the basement.

629
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:28,366
When we sat with that stuff
fooling around, they forced us to choose.

630
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,954
To choose how we would die.

631
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:15,371
We saw them go through the tomb entrance.
The Internal Security can ...

632
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:18,291
Forget the protocol!
Are you crazy?

633
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:24,339
That sucker! Not the girl. When he
remains, all is lost. He first.

634
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:29,719
They seem to show a stock pot to have
missed. That shit made'm stuck immune.

635
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:34,474
Does that help us now? If his death
confirmed, make your hair off.

636
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:35,850
There!

637
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:37,518
Cell 3606.

638
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,188
Gotcha.

639
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,231
Get them on down.

640
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,168
Step off the elevator!

641
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:05,421
Why do you want to kill us?
Step-out! Only the girl.

642
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:08,049
Just me?
-Come on!

643
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:20,686
Nicely done, zombie arm.

644
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:48,131
You're supposed to be here.

645
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:54,887
This was very different to walk.
And last be faster.

646
01:13:55,055 --> 01:14:00,601
I can your pain and confusion
hard to imagine, but realize this:

647
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:04,188
What happens to you ...,
part of something bigger.

648
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:07,692
Parents than anything you can imagine.

649
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:13,948
You've seen horrors.
'S Army of nightmarish creatures.

650
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:20,163
But they are nothing compared to what
preceded it. What lurks underground.

651
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:25,334
It is our job the Ancients
satisfaction.

652
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:29,797
And you serve as a sacrifice,
in their honor.

653
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:34,802
Forgive us.
And now let this be handled expeditiously.

654
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,221
Go inside.

655
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:00,786
Nightmarish creatures, eh?

656
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:13,090
Let the party begin.

657
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:14,842
Cease fire!

658
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:30,733
Oh, shit ...

659
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:47,917
Forward!

660
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:07,246
Commander Truman for High Command:
We need backup. Code Black!

661
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:09,415
Where are you located?

662
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:14,837
Sector 12, no function. Sector 8,
inoperative. And Division 3!

663
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:17,131
Why does not the defense?
Where's the gas?

664
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,759
Slightly, the compound in the shaft
bitten.

665
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:22,094
What then?
-Something horrible!

666
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,627
The north exit
is blocked.

667
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:19,735
Then go!

668
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,664
Our time is running out!
-I try 's system to unlock!

669
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,056
Hadley!

670
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:03,839
No, huh ...

671
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:45,840
You're 't.

672
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:53,097
No, please ...

673
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,646
Kill him.

674
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:09,697
Dana, come on.

675
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:16,829
Skips' t be easier.

676
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:23,062
Look's good.

677
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:29,526
Five pieces.
Who or what are they?

678
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:36,533
That's us.
I 't even have to see.

679
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:43,874
This is part 'n ritual.
- 'N Ritual sacrifice?

680
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:46,627
Enjoyed it.

681
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:52,758
You tie someone 's stone,
up 'n good knife and a bunch of robes.

682
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:57,096
Is that so complicated?
-No, it is simple.

683
01:22:57,263 --> 01:23:00,099
But we can not just death.

684
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,311
They want to see us be punished.

685
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,814
Punished for what?

686
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,983
For your youth.

687
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:19,952
In every culture is different. And the
has changed over the years ...

688
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,163
But the youth was always ...
in the game.

689
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,834
There must be at least five.

690
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:29,586
The whore ...

691
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:33,007
... Depraved.
And dies first.

692
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:35,759
The athlete.

693
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:38,846
The student.

694
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:42,224
The fool.

695
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:48,772
All will suffer and die under the
basis of the sample that they are calling ...

696
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:55,154
Then ... one remains alive
or death, as fate decides.

697
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:58,115
The virgin.

698
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,326
I?

699
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:02,911
Virgin?

700
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:05,622
We make do with what
we have.

701
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:08,292
But if it fails?

702
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:11,503
Then they rise.
-Who?

703
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:13,797
What's under us?

704
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:18,177
The ancients. The gods who once
prevailed over the earth.

705
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:22,473
As long as they accept our sacrifices,
they remain below.

706
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,516
But the other rituals failed.

707
01:24:27,937 --> 01:24:33,317
The sun rises about 8 minutes. As
you still live, the world perishes.

708
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:36,487
Maybe it should be.

709
01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:41,825
If you must kill people to survive,
is it perhaps about time for a change?

710
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:43,911
We have not it
about change.

711
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:48,290
But the painful death
of every human soul.

712
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,626
Including you.

713
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:53,045
You can die with them ...

714
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,757
For them ... or you can die.

715
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:02,596
That sounds both so tempting.

716
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:24,701
The whole world, Marty.
-She is in your hands, Dana.

717
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:31,667
There is no other option.
You must be strong.

718
01:25:32,168 --> 01:25:34,086
Dana ...

719
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:37,673
... You feel strong?

720
01:25:39,592 --> 01:25:41,885
I'm sorry.

721
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:45,597
Me too.

722
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,350
Marty ...

723
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:36,690
Marty!

724
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:37,709
Do you ...

725
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:43,632
I think Curt has ...
not even have a cousin.

726
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,100
How are you?

727
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:58,939
I'm dying.

728
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:03,777
I'm sorry.

729
01:28:05,738 --> 01:28:09,324
I'm sorry that I you
almost shot.

730
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:11,618
I had it fixed not dared.

731
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:17,874
I understand it completely.

732
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:35,392
Sorry that weerwolfje attacked
and therefore, the world will end.

733
01:28:38,604 --> 01:28:41,189
You were right.

734
01:28:42,191 --> 01:28:44,109
Oh, the humanity ...

735
01:28:50,908 --> 01:28:53,702
'T is time for someone else
even have a chance.

736
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:08,675
Giant, evil gods.

737
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:18,602
I had seen them so happy.
-I know.

738
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:23,065
That would be a fun weekend
have been.

739
01:29:40,000 --> 01:49:43,078
