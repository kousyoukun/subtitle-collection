The Polish Film Institute

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,798
present a film by Maciej Pieprzyca

7
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,916
LIFE FEELS GOOD

8
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,638
The film was inspired
by real events.

9
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,155
Good morning.

10
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,000
Go ahead, please.

11
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,830
Mateusz.

12
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,756
Say something about yourself.

13
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,995
Mateusz...

14
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,389
My opinion
is objective and professional.

15
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,754
- The boy is mentally disabled.
- But you said...

16
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,077
You said it may turn out he...

17
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,757
You think
he understands everything?

18
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,795
Give me an example.

19
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,550
He's excited when I prepare lunch.

20
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,115
He salivates, right?

21
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,150
Just like my dog
when its bowI is full.

22
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,789
And it wags its tail.

23
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,398
What is it, sonny?

24
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,277
You'll never communicate.
You can place him in a special home.

25
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,315
- What are you telling me?
- The truth.

26
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,353
It's a vegetable.

27
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,315
I'll help you.

28
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,353
Mum, he doesn't want to.

29
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,630
A bit longer.

30
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,878
Try a bit more, sonny.

31
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,071
The doctor said he'd never walk.

32
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,550
We'll see.

33
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,758
You started walking very late.

34
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,476
A bit more.

35
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,758
You'll repeat the year at school.

36
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,989
- One's dumber than the other.
- Don't say it to Mateusz.

37
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,278
He doesn't get it.

38
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,031
You're ashamed of himself too.

39
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,796
Why don't you take him for a walk?

40
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,356
Ms Talarczyk asks if he's alive.

41
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,038
You promised to repair it.

42
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,196
Hi, sonny.

43
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,754
There you go.

44
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,875
What is it?

45
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,154
You've been drinking.

46
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,672
Shh...

47
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,196
Can I?

48
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,278
It's thirty-three past seven.

49
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,996
PROOF

50
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,436
Mateusz!

51
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,076
Your head is filled with warmth.

52
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,350
Your body is filled with warmth.

53
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,751
I'm giving you the force.

54
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,558
I won't come again.

55
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,798
No point in torturing him.

56
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,189
I'm begging you.
He's been better since last time.

57
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,436
Look...

58
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,278
Money won't help here.

59
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,031
You have to accept it.

60
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,800
That's fine, sonny.

61
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,831
You'd like to say something?

62
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,634
Are you hungry?

63
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,520
Are you thirsty?

64
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,630
You want to say you love me?

65
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,836
If only I could understand you...

66
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,318
Now you know the worst truth.

67
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,038
When you're a vegetable,
no one understands you.

68
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,069
When a real man has had enough
or disagrees...

69
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,838
...he has to hit his fist
on the table. Get it?

70
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,995
Go ahead!

71
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,156
Great!

72
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,636
Once again.

73
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,751
What are you teaching him?

74
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,595
Look at this man!

75
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,159
I was waltlng for the rlght moment
to show them who I was.

76
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,829
I declded to learn
and see what would happen.

77
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,999
Mum, come here, please.

78
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,629
What? Just a sec.

79
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,395
What is it, sonny?

80
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,035
What do you want?

81
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,476
Easy, easy.

82
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,518
Are you trying to stand up?

83
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,195
I'll help you.

84
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,829
Beautiful! Look!

85
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,714
He's so light now.

86
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,509
What did you want?

87
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,756
Nothing.

88
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,509
Darling!

89
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,356
One...

90
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,276
Two...

91
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,876
And now.

92
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,949
Three. Thlrteen spoons a day.
Nlnety-one a week.

93
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,189
Almost four hundred a month.
Mlnus thlrty that I splt.

94
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,478
These were my maths classes.

95
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,991
That man was jjealous of hls wlfe.

96
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,151
When he was away, she met that man.

97
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,877
That couple llved together
but never spoke.

98
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,631
Watchlng nelghbours
was my soclal educatlon course.

99
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,349
Parcels from Germany
were my geography classes.

100
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,474
It will last for a year.

101
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,750
Lovely smell!

102
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,750
Tomek, look!

103
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,719
These are for the boys.

104
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,355
Give him this one.

105
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,790
What is it?

106
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,548
It's for the fridge.

107
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,789
- How do you know?
- For wrapping food.

108
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,753
Our neighbour got it too.

109
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,990
What is it?

110
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,715
Dad taught me
deslgn and technology.

111
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,070
Let it go.

112
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,914
The knife will break.

113
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,430
And never to glve up.

114
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,118
You can take it off now.

115
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,520
My favourlte class was anatomy.

116
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,708
Is Tuesday fine?

117
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,393
Tlts and stars
are two God's greatest Inventlons.

118
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,392
The space travel
is no longer a dream.

119
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,437
Years of tests taught us
how to make use of physics.

120
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,670
We've created reliable spacecrafts
at the cutting-edge of technology.

121
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,998
Rocket science has reached...

122
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,316
I don't know.

123
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,556
Cinema? Fine.

124
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:04,073
- Why did you turn it off?
- You think he understands it?

125
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,560
How do I look?

126
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,956
- You seen my silver brooch?
- No!

127
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,310
Flnally, the rlght moment came.

128
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,472
Mum!

129
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,560
Sonny, what is it?

130
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,638
You may hurt yourself!

131
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,275
Mateusz, stop it!

132
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,760
Can't you help me?

133
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,755
Keep his head!

134
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,790
It's fine.

135
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,878
It's all right now.

136
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,915
It's all right.

137
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,595
It's all right.

138
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,876
WIZARD

139
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,390
Look! There's Jupiter.

140
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,590
The bright one is the Plough.

141
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,916
People think the stars are still.

142
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,878
But it's not true.

143
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,756
They move like mad all the time.

144
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,352
It's just us, dowm below,
we think they are still.

145
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,916
I couldn't declde who Dad was.

146
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,519
[Skipped item nr. 146]

147
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,479
[Skipped item nr. 147]

148
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,916
Then, I thought he was a mechanlc.

149
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,876
Great.

150
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,350
Mum will sit down for a bit.

151
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,676
He's heavier after all.

152
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,470
I'll fix a new one. Don't worry.

153
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,591
I even thought he was a crlmlnal.

154
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,829
He got Interrogated
by our nelghbour, a cop.

155
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,911
He came home exhausted afterwards.

156
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,189
And drank gherkln water
for hls hangover.

157
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,275
Put it there.

158
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,754
Ready? Hop on!

159
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,237
Engines on. Three, two, one.

160
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:12,153
Dad wasn't an astronomer,
a mechanlc or a crlmlnal.

161
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,398
To me, he was a wlzard.

162
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,435
Go, go, go!

163
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,678
Where do you think you're going?

164
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,794
Hold it. It's sticky.

165
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,790
Place it here.

166
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,636
Hold it.

167
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,514
On June 4, the Poles voted
in the first democratic elections...

168
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,758
...since the Second World War.

169
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,633
The campaign was heated.

170
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,115
Sorry!

171
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,758
62% of eligible voters
went to the polls.

172
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,998
Even nuns were allowed to vote.

173
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,437
Some people had never voted before.

174
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,670
Optimists notice the changes
that were unlikely a few months ago.

175
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,034
The next election
will be fully democratic.

176
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,874
See? We've succeeded.

177
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,634
I'll be back soon.

178
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,196
In 1989, Dad brought down Communlsm.

179
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,631
And now thlngs were to be better.

180
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,879
- Where are you going?
- The city's all buzzing.

181
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,636
You promised to fix the lock.

182
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,393
Would you like to see
the stars exploding tonight?

183
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,715
Would you like to?

184
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,956
Deal.

185
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,310
High five.

186
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,909
It's some crap.

187
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,391
See? It can't be fixed.

188
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,918
I need to buy a new one.

189
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,756
But Dad is broke.

190
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,792
- Is that enough?
- Not a chance.

191
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,600
Let me go, sonny.

192
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,474
Everything's fine.

193
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,116
Look after this.
Dad will be back in no time.

194
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,911
I won't even take it.

195
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,870
What kind of father you got?

196
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,753
Come for supper.

197
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,634
Put it away.

198
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,276
What are you doing? Let go!

199
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,150
Stop it! You may hurt yourself.

200
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,031
You'll hurt both of us.

201
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,710
Calm down!

202
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,791
Didn't I promise you?

203
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,038
I wasn't afrald he'd get hurt.

204
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,798
Nothlng can hurt a man
who made the stars explode.

205
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,590
Mum.

206
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,039
We have to go.

207
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,756
I was left wlth what he taught me.

208
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,838
Not to glve up.

209
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,109
And hls catchphrase:
'Everythlng's flne. '

210
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,268
In 1998, I met Anka.

211
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,919
Every nlght,
her mum Invlted a dlfferent man...

212
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,198
...to help her fall asleep.

213
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,236
BOYFRIEND

214
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:02,510
Matylda dreamed of a husband.
She went huntlng every day.

215
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,909
But people don't grow
what they wlsh for.

216
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,236
Hi.

217
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,158
There's no one at home.

218
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,998
I've told you about my brother.

219
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,750
Hi. I'm Gosia.

220
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,478
All right, bro, get out.

221
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,796
They made worse nolses than I dld.

222
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:30,677
My brother made me reallse
I mlssed out on lmportant thlngs.

223
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,319
Rosinski intercepts the ball.

224
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,549
He dribbles Maradona
in the penalty area.

225
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,638
Will Rosinski score a goal?

226
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,876
Yes! Goal!

227
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,830
I'm Anka.

228
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,669
Hi, Anka. I'm Mateusz.
You're a nice girl.

229
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,431
'Where did they draw
the treacle from? '

230
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:46,191
'You can draw water
out of a water - well... '

231
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,917
'... said the Hatter:
So I should think... '

232
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,674
'... you could draw treacle
out of a treacle-well - eh, stupid? '

233
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,430
'But they were in the well... '

234
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,709
I flnally knew who I was:
Someone's boyfrlend.

235
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,309
I saw our future home and klds
crawllng on the floor wlth me.

236
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,353
You know what I mean?

237
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,878
I declded to klll hlm.

238
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,918
Sonny, what happened?

239
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,471
You want to sit by the window?

240
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,629
Look what you've done
to your old mum.

241
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,233
You're a bad boy.

242
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,279
Your mum knows you smoke?

243
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,519
- Not your business.
- Drop it.

244
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,433
Stop smiling!

245
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,113
Drop the fucking cig!

246
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,277
Why are you doing this?

247
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,672
Have I ever hurt you?

248
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,954
Oh, Mike Tyson!

249
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,196
Moron!

250
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,156
Calm down!

251
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,874
What did you do to him?

252
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,997
Nothing.

253
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,749
- Documents!
- No!

254
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,429
- Now!
- Go away.

255
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,109
- Documents!
- Fuck off!

256
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,473
It was a mlracle.

257
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,678
But not the one I expected.

258
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,234
Mateusz? It's me.

259
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,910
We're going to my grandma's.

260
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,919
Mum wants to run away
before he gets out of jail.

261
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,476
EVERYTHING'S FINE

262
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,836
Take aim... and bang!

263
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,754
You get a three-day pass
if you score three tens.

264
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,756
Listen.

265
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,438
To those who are at sea!

266
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,509
- My dear brother-in-law.
- Here's to you.

267
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,877
Eat something or you'll get drunk.

268
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,390
Want a sandwich?

269
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,430
- What do you eat on the ship?
- Tinned food.

270
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,194
Thanks for the beads.

271
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,439
- Yummy.
- Don't butter me up.

272
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,076
We'll change your single bed
for a double one.

273
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,113
We have to be together now.

274
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,359
- And when I get back?
- It will take a while.

275
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,589
- What about Mateusz?
- We'll move him to my room.

276
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,071
To living in harmony!

277
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,196
Here's to you, kids.

278
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,918
You should think about Mateusz.

279
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,430
Meaning?

280
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,033
Who's going to lift him?
You're getting old.

281
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,358
- Shut up.
- Don't argue.

282
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,394
- Stay out of this.
- Take him with you.

283
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,269
- To my ship?
- Who will lift him?

284
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,519
Mum has a sick back.
Adam works all day.

285
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,070
Don't argue. I can manage him.

286
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:25,597
He's the only one
who's ever mattered to you.

287
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,990
I needed adventures and a change.

288
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,393
But I got the opposlte
to what I was hoplng for. As usual.

289
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,276
Let me change your clothes.

290
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,909
You're so heavy.

291
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,669
I told myself:
'Everythlng's flne. '

292
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,272
'Everythlng's flne,
everythlng's flne. '

293
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,471
SMILE

294
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,030
- Take a look.
- Light as a feather.

295
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,237
- You got the signal?
- Very weak.

296
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,994
Maybe a sedative?

297
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,469
I was waltlng for Mum.
I could tell her so much.

298
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,516
The wake-up call was at 6.30.

299
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,997
The bathroom was always occupled
though my slster dldn't llve here.

300
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:04,519
I sometlmes thought
they were at the sports camp.

301
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,873
Or on hollday.

302
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,790
They felt almost llke home.

303
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,949
Almost. Mum sewed for cllents,
but they sewed for nobody.

304
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,558
Yet, love looks the same.

305
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,670
Death comes In the same way.

306
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,475
I dldn't llke It here.

307
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,949
I walted for Mum to leave hospltal
and take me home.

308
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,835
Good morning.

309
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:47,195
You remember our neighbours,
the policeman family?

310
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,790
They send their regards too.

311
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,196
Oh, sorry.

312
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,436
Easy.

313
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,355
My little finger.

314
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,236
Sonny, I have to catch the train.

315
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:19,078
I'll come by on Monday.

316
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,868
I like you.

317
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,234
But I don't llke you.

318
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:56,509
Grant us strength in suffering.
God loves you, Leszek.

319
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:04,029
Grant us strength in suffering.
God loves you, Marek.

320
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,759
Grant us strength in suffering.
God loves you, Mateusz.

321
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,078
Thanks be to God.

322
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,318
What If he hated me?

323
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,599
Why so sad?

324
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,349
It's gonna be a lovely day.
Life feels good.

325
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,598
I dldn't llke that wltch.

326
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,839
She fed me when I was on my back.
I blt my llps then.

327
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,391
She had nelther tlts nor braln.

328
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,352
Hi.

329
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,837
I'm a new volunteer to feed you.

330
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:31,116
Another one who dldn't guess
I should slt up.

331
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,868
I forgave her.

332
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,118
I came up wlth a ten-polnt scale.

333
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:42,349
My slster was the worst: One.
It's better to be a vegetable.

334
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,755
Thls one was flve.

335
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,920
Four. Out of plty.

336
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,316
Elght.

337
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,275
What's up? Are you OK?

338
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,470
Elght and a half.

339
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,511
Tomek's sailing the ocean.

340
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,120
He sent a postcard.

341
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,274
From Borneo.

342
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,993
I think it's an island.

343
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:49,269
'Hi, Bro,
I picked coconuts from a palm.'

344
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,830
'And ate crab meat, Tomek.'

345
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,389
I'm sorry, sonny.

346
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,589
I hated her.

347
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,357
Dad wouldn't have left me
among those morons.

348
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,758
I'll come by on Monday.

349
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,951
That was
how I got Into a boxlng team.

350
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,671
They flnally understood
I hurt my llps.

351
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,551
So they trled to help me.

352
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:51,473
Mirka was to clean it.
But no, she's busy eating cake.

353
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,710
She's like my Aunt Stefa.
Too fat to pick up a banknote.

354
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,958
A spoon can dig you a grave.

355
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,910
Glad to see you. Follow me, please.

356
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,235
Here. See?

357
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:17,199
- It's an aquarium.
- And below?

358
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,478
Don't you see it's dirty?

359
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,719
You can't turn
an old woman into a girl.

360
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,471
The only thing
I have to clean it is water.

361
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,116
Buy chemicals and I'll clean it.

362
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:57,150
Dad sald If a man had had enough,
he had to hlt hls flst on the table.

363
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,876
Fuck!

364
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,158
Mateusz, I'm talking to you!

365
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,671
I smlled for the flrst tlme
for many months.

366
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,869
Everyone wanted to talk to me.
What a great feellng.

367
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:46,280
Everythlng's flne.

368
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:10,629
Leszek - retardation.
Marek - hydrocephalus.

369
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,878
Mateusz - cerebral palsy.

370
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:22,389
Take a deep breath
and you'll be fine. So?

371
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:30,592
75% of new volunteers quit
after I take them here.

372
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,870
It's a test. So?

373
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,278
I thought:
'Maybe tlts aren't that lmportant? '

374
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,917
Have I grown up?

375
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,751
WORDS

376
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,590
A bit more.

377
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,118
Shall we eat together?

378
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,350
Your turn.

379
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:08,116
I play this piece when I'm sad.

380
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,677
I pretend I'm a ballerina.

381
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:40,157
He reacts when I talk to him.
He understands me.

382
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:32,476
Why didn't you shave, man?

383
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,918
You playing the ball?

384
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,790
He reacts.

385
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,435
He reacts.

386
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:02,198
It doesn't mean he understands.

387
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:08,936
You don't need words.
A look in the eye is enough.

388
01:08:08,937 --> 01:08:10,236
Maybe.

389
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,350
Coffee?

390
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,835
Maybe not.

391
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,356
We grew a speclal bond.

392
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:27,716
We no longer spent tlme only In bed.

393
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,276
Chocolate flavour, your favourite.

394
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,798
Tomek sent a postcard.

395
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,234
From Mauritius.

396
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:56,479
'Am sitting under a palm,
drinking a toast to you, Bro.'

397
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,196
Hello.

398
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,396
I'm Magda. I help with Mateusz.

399
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,672
Hi.

400
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,637
Hi.

401
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,316
Today's his twenty-fifth birthday.

402
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,558
Sorry, I don't have a gift.

403
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,358
Will you join us for the cake?

404
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,717
I don't want to bother you.

405
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,514
Happy birthday.

406
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,196
Goodbye.

407
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:13,037
Would you agree that I take him
for a walk outside?

408
01:11:13,038 --> 01:11:14,878
Would you like to, sonny?

409
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,998
I have a gift for you.

410
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,796
Sometlmes you want a moment
to last forever.

411
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,355
It was such a moment.

412
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,909
Ahmed says in Polish:
'I be guide to Mount Sinai.'

413
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,871
'Our group name be Adam Malysz.'

414
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,519
The Russians were 'Putin'.

415
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,796
Good evening.

416
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,995
Hello everyone.

417
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,834
Can we join you?

418
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,516
Certainly.

419
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,516
Thank you.

420
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,557
This is my dad I told you about.

421
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,312
Hello.

422
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,919
And this is...

423
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,876
Wanda.

424
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,196
My stepmother.

425
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,476
This is Mateusz.

426
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,156
My fiance.

427
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,350
Happy birthday.

428
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,036
Thank you.

429
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,155
You remember about
Mum's death anniversary?

430
01:16:24,156 --> 01:16:25,553
He's adult.

431
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,718
Will you try on your own?

432
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,159
Here's to you, Dad.

433
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:10,111
So every ten minutes we hear:
'Adam Malysz, come! '

434
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:16,599
It's the Bedouins who want
to take us to Mount Sinai.

435
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,558
- For 150 dollars?
- 170.

436
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,798
Let's sing for dad, shall we?

437
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,197
Happy birthday to you...

438
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,189
Thank you, baby.

439
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,279
She's always had original ideas.

440
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:53,750
Now you don't approve of cripples?

441
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,799
- It's not that.
- So what is it?

442
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,234
Your name's Mateusz?

443
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,279
I'm sorry for my daughter.

444
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,238
What about your next companion?

445
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:12,958
A homeless guy last year,
him today, who's next?

446
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,396
Stop it.

447
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,593
- Magda?
- Stop it.

448
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,798
- Let's talk...
- Stop it.

449
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,756
Magda!

450
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,109
Wait a second.

451
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,632
What did you do to her?

452
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,118
You puked on her or what?

453
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,120
She quit.

454
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,270
Mateusz?

455
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,836
Happy birthday to you...

456
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,555
Casablanca.

457
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,319
It took it four months to get here.

458
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,551
Where's this Casablanca?

459
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,550
In some Arab country, I guess.

460
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,976
There are Arabic letters
and a flag with a green star.

461
01:22:31,977 --> 01:22:33,873
Matylda will come next time.

462
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:46,616
Her husband left her
so she has to look after her kids.

463
01:22:46,617 --> 01:22:50,514
Ms Talarczyk says hello.
She was at hospital.

464
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,476
She's at home now, recovering.

465
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:02,239
Her son's a policeman,
like his father.

466
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:07,079
Mr Talarczyk lost four kilos.
He was so worried about his wife.

467
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:10,550
Maybe he lost even more.

468
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,278
Everything will be fine.

469
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,755
I know.

470
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:09,116
HUMAN BEING

471
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,274
I like you.

472
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:11,951
Here are the symbols.

473
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:24,556
We will use them to communicate.

474
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:28,150
Bravo! You've blinked once.

475
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:33,219
This is a symbol for 'warm'.
I'll ask you if you are warm.

476
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:37,629
You blink once
and I'll open the window.

477
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:41,278
I'll ask you if you are tired.

478
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:48,195
You blink once and we'll stop.
You blink twice and we'll go on.

479
01:26:48,196 --> 01:26:49,798
'Warm'. Are you warm?

480
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:56,754
What do we say?

481
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,795
You've blinked twice.
Great! You're not warm.

482
01:27:01,796 --> 01:27:03,320
I will not open the window.

483
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,434
'Drink'. You want a drink?

484
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,789
You do? You've blinked once.
I'll give you a drink.

485
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,998
I'm on my way to get a drink.

486
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,238
One day, Ms Jola came to our Centre.

487
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:28,509
I'll give you a drink
because you blinked once.

488
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,111
So you said: 'I want a drink.'

489
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,668
Can you hold it?

490
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,118
Adela, see you soon.

491
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,188
See you soon!

492
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,755
Lie still.

493
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,990
Easy.

494
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,559
What's going on?

495
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,588
Calm down.

496
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:43,039
They'll take care of you.

497
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,395
What is it?

498
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,875
What's up?

499
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,556
Easy!

500
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,430
Hold him!

501
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,710
Silence!

502
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,230
Relax.

503
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,036
Injection!

504
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,039
No, wait!

505
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:15,237
You want to tell me something?

506
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:25,592
- We'll learn...
- But he was tested.

507
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:33,157
Remember? You blink once for yes.

508
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,755
This symbol?

509
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,434
'Sister'. Sister?

510
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,719
Flnally, others wondered who I was.

511
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:47,678
Dad was rlght: Everythlng's flne.

512
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,555
That's the one?

513
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,719
What's in here? 'Brother'?
Great!

514
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:58,792
That's how I became 'our Mateusz'.

515
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:08,078
Professor, this is our Mateusz.

516
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:12,319
He didn't communicate for 26 years.

517
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,470
Please, go ahead.

518
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,916
This symbol?

519
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,039
Mateusz! 'Goodbye'?

520
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,600
This column?

521
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,833
Yes.

522
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,559
This symbol?

523
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,118
'Not'.

524
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,639
- Easy.
- Not too fast?

525
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,393
Yes, this page. Ask him.

526
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,109
This page, sonny?

527
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,195
This column?

528
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,109
This symbol?

529
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,469
This symbol?

530
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,869
It's 'I'.

531
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:17,678
You want to say 'I'?

532
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,151
So we have 'not' and 'I'.

533
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,999
- Let's go on.
- Shall I turn the pages?

534
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,150
Go on.

535
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:34,639
- This one.

536
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:38,076
This column?

537
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,875
This symbol?

538
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,834
'Vegetable'.

539
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,988
Not I...

540
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,839
Not I vegetable?

541
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,909
Ask him.

542
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:08,590
You want to tell me
you're not a vegetable?

543
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:12,830
What did they do to you?

544
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,430
Open your eyes.

545
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,579
- You like it?
- Jola, where shall I put it?

546
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,638
Mateusz?

547
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,439
- Here.
- Mateusz, is it OK?

548
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:38,830
The reporter is here.

549
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:20,629
Hi, I'm Ewa.

550
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:27,039
I'd like to write about your story.

551
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,349
Don't worry.

552
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:33,990
I'll start with photos. May I?

553
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,316
'I may.'

554
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,914
It's simple to use.

555
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:48,475
Everything is here.
You can find what interests you.

556
01:34:48,476 --> 01:34:50,756
One click and you talk to the world.

557
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,678
To someone in the US.

558
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:58,920
Homecomlngs are pecullar.

559
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,498
Objjects look the same.
Yet, somethlng doesn't flt.

560
01:35:11,499 --> 01:35:13,319
You're the one who's changed.

561
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,193
'LIK E A BUTTERFLY'

562
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:21,398
So you've met your uncle.

563
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:33,158
Oh, you have a tattoo.

564
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,869
Take a look!

565
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,758
I'll make you one.

566
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:48,838
It was nlce to come back.

567
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,470
But It wasn't my home any longer.

568
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,316
Hello!

569
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,799
Could we talk?

570
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,359
- Something wrong with Mateusz?
- Let's sit down.

571
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,518
The head office read the article.

572
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:40,879
They say if he's normal,
he shouldn't be here.

573
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,431
This is the Centre
for Intellectually Disabled.

574
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:48,474
He isn't one.

575
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,738
They want to transfer Mateusz
to a different centre.

576
01:36:54,739 --> 01:36:56,878
They will interview him.

577
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:02,430
Take a look. It's a lovely home.

578
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,833
There's a park.

579
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,600
See this avenue?

580
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:18,078
There are no mountains, I know.

581
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:21,673
But look at this lake.

582
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:25,118
I know  It's far away.

583
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:31,073
I'll come and visit you.

584
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:37,475
Good morning.

01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,389

01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,518
Thank you, that's all.

592
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,750
He's a moron.

593
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:29,118
Let's go, that's enough.

594
