1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:02,712
My name is F. Gary Gray.

2
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:04,881
<i>I'm the director of Straight' Outta Compton.</i>

3
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:08,843
And I want to first start off
by thanking my team-

4
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:12,013
my producing partners Ice Cube,

5
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:14,099
Dr. Dre,

6
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:15,850
Scott Bernstein.

7
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:19,938
There's a whole host of other people
that should be involved,

8
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,940
but since we have
a short amount of time,

9
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:25,110
I want to start with those guys
and thank everybody else who's involved.

10
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:28,029
Also want to thank Universal,
Donna Langley

11
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:30,990
and the entire Universal family

12
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:35,453
for really being
the best home for this movie.

13
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:38,998
This movie would not
have been as successful,

14
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:42,544
it wouldn't have been executed
in the way that it's been executed

15
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:46,631
without the Universal family
and without everyone.

16
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:49,426
I'm sure I'm forgetting a ton of people.

17
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:52,804
But I want to thank everybody involved
with making this movie.

18
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:56,725
One of the big themes
in this movie is brotherhood.

19
00:00:56,808 --> 00:01:01,479
We serve the theme with the group
and the brotherhood between the guys.

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,900
I love this because it just shows
how smart Eazy-E is.

21
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:08,903
He pulls up into this drug deal

22
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:13,533
with what we used to call a bucket-
a old, beat-up car.

23
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,994
Basically, he's not showing his hand.

24
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,579
He's playing chess.

25
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:19,998
He has a ton of drugs
that he's selling,

26
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,876
but he's not gonna let anybody know
that he has money.

27
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,088
This is just a way to define quickly
who this guy is.

28
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:29,174
He's very, very smart.

29
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:32,927
That's what you see
when you see the contrast

30
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:37,307
between that really fancy car
and his old, beat-up car.

31
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,311
It's just defining Eazy-E immediately.

32
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:52,989
I love what my production designer did
with this crack house.

33
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:58,495
Because you really, really feel
that you're in Compton

34
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:01,498
and you really feel like
you're in a dangerous situation.

35
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:05,376
You can smell the beer
and the smoke and the drugs.

36
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,755
And the danger is just visceral.

37
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:14,427
My DP, Matty Libatique, did an amazing job
at capturing this entire film.

38
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:17,347
But this scene in particular,
because it's a way

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,644
to show that it's natural,
it's raw, it's dangerous.

40
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:26,231
It's not slick.
It doesn't feel like Hollywood.

41
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:30,443
It just feels raw, not unlike the group
and not unlike their music.

42
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:37,951
This is one of my favorite moments
because it just doesn't feel staged.

43
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,747
The two women you see
are actual models.

44
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,710
Natascha, she's a stuntwoman,
but basically she's a very beautiful woman.

45
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:50,296
She's a model.
And that's Zee James.

46
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,342
She's a model as well,
and I made her take out- cut her hair,

47
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:59,097
take it all out
and play a crack addict.

48
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,475
I do that from time to time
to play the opposites.

49
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,520
I did that with Friday,
with the Felisha character.

50
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:10,525
She was a beautiful comedian
who I turned into a crack addict.

51
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:14,237
I just have fun with casting
in that way.

52
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:19,200
She was a beautiful comedian
who I turned into a crack addict.

53
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:22,912
I just have fun with casting
in that way.

54
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:27,333
This, of course,
is the introduction to Jason Mitchell,

55
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:31,004
who is an amazing young, new actor

56
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:35,091
who carries this film
and does an incredible job.

57
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,677
You'll see, as the movie unfolds,

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,013
that this guy gives
a world-class performance.

59
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,890
It's partly because he studies,

60
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:45,518
but I think it's partly because
he's just real and authentic.

61
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,229
He comes from the streets
of New Orleans.

62
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:52,859
I think he draws on his experiences
from the past

63
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:56,696
to give us one of the best performances,
I think, of the year.

64
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:00,825
Now, this is important because

65
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:06,748
instead of giving you this long,
drawn-out montage

66
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:09,125
of images from the '80s

67
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,713
to show you that you're
in a period piece-

68
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:18,259
following this group circa 1985, 1986-

69
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:21,179
I wanted to do it by showing
what was going on

70
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,598
but also showing the battering ram.

71
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,934
People called it the batterram
back in the day.

72
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:31,439
For those who know,
the batterram really marks the time.

73
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,567
If you were living in Los Angeles
in the 1980s,

74
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,903
people were afraid to get
their houses ripped apart,

75
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:42,617
by this- essentially, by this military tank

76
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,871
that would come and completely
rip the guts out of your house.

77
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,750
This was just a way
to mark the era

78
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,045
without doing some corny montage.

79
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:13,856
Chic Daniel, our police consultant,

80
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,694
did a great job at helping us
do everything technically right with this scene.

81
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:22,448
He used to actually drive
that vehicle in the '80s,

82
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,492
which is kind of a coincidence.

83
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,328
So, finding the vehicle was hard,

84
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:31,040
but finding the original driver
was just as interesting.

85
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:34,210
And to put all these elements together

86
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:39,257
really, I think, gives the audience
a good sense of what was going on.

87
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,344
It completely immerses you
into the time immediately.

88
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,055
That's what I wanted to do.

89
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:56,524
Matty Libatique came up with this great filter
that gives you these sun ﬂares

90
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,319
that is kind of a metaphor
for being in California.

91
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:03,781
It's sunny, and the music is warm.

92
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:08,202
But at the same time,
there's this contrast with the danger

93
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:13,875
and all the stuff that happens outside of
the warm, sunny Southern California days.

94
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:17,253
We wanted to create
some sort of visual signature

95
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,590
<i>to let you know</i> you're <i>in
Straight Outta Compton</i> and <i>nowhere</i> else.

96
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:25,136
This is something that is just
kind of a signature of the movie

97
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,180
that we carry on throughout.

98
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:31,142
Matty Libatique, I think, is a genius
for coming up with that.

99
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,819
I really like this moment
because it's one of those moments

100
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:45,448
where I get the chance
to illustrate my childhood

101
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,075
and some of my childhood inﬂuences.

102
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,411
I love all the music
that he's listening to

103
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,206
because that's the music
I listened to when I grew up

104
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,708
and that my mom passed on to me.

105
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:01,380
When you see Roy Ayers
and Parliament and James Brown,

106
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,634
these are all artists that I grew up to
and my mom grew up to.

107
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,347
Of course, this is Corey Hawkins,

108
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,394
who is an amazing young artist
from the East Coast who plays Dr. Dre.

109
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,271
He was trained at Juilliard.

110
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:20,775
He actually performed on Broadway.

111
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:25,696
He never thought that he
could pull off playing Dr. Dre

112
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,952
because his personality is so opposite
of where Dre is from

113
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:33,663
and how Dre really acts in real life.

114
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:39,085
But this guy is such a talented actor
that he can transform,

115
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,170
and I think that's what he did.

116
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:47,301
I used this time to really set up

117
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:51,138
the relationship
between Dre and his family.

118
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:53,516
Although that was
a hell of a slap right there,

119
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,601
you could really tell
that his mom loves him.

120
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:58,104
She wants to send him
in the right direction.

121
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:02,275
Maybe a questionable approach,
but, definitely, there's love there.

122
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:05,987
Also establishing the love
between Dre and his brother,

123
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,406
which, as the story evolves,

124
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,951
you get a sense
of how much he loves his brother.

125
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:15,913
I just want to make sure
people get the point.

126
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:19,000
Focusing on controversial lyrics

127
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,878
and some of the mistakes
that we all know that these guys made,

128
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:25,548
or we all make
because we're all human,

129
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,508
is not the point.

130
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:33,681
The point is you can start from anywhere
with absolutely nothing

131
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,684
and make a transition
and transform your life.

132
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,853
That's what these guys did.

133
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,731
When you start off in Compton
with the gang violence

134
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:45,359
and all of the shit
that you're surrounded by-

135
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:50,281
and all of the shit
that you're surrounded by-

136
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,658
the drug dealing, the drug abuse,

137
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:59,290
all of the things that really influence
everything that happens around you-

138
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,209
and you have the strength
to turn that around

139
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:07,882
and create
and to raise a healthy family

140
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:12,803
and to create prosperous businesses,

141
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,805
I think that there's something there.

142
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,766
I don't want that point
to be missed on the viewer.

143
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:22,480
Because there's a lot of criticism
that these guys experienced along the way.

144
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,690
I'm sure, when people watch the movie,

145
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:30,237
there are things that people would want to see
that probably they missed.

146
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:36,869
The one thing that's interesting about N.W.A
is they pissed a lot of people off.

147
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:40,748
But in a strange way,
they inspired people as well.

148
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:45,628
You don't hear a lot of the stories
about how they inspired people.

149
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:49,465
When you live in an environment
where you're discouraged,

150
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,258
you're disempowered,

151
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,594
all these things
that work against you,

152
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:58,891
and you still stand up and say,
“You know what? Fuck that.

153
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:03,062
I'm going to be my own man.
I'm not gonna serve polite society.

154
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:05,189
I'm going to speak my mind.

155
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:09,235
I'm going to do things
that feel good to me,

156
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:12,530
and I don't give a shit
if you judge me or not”-

157
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:18,202
There's something inspiring about that
to guys who grew up in my neighborhood.

158
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,459
O'Shea Jackson, Jr., who plays Ice Cube,

159
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:28,003
this guy worked the hardest
to get this role.

160
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:31,882
It took him two years,
a lot of acting coaches

161
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,009
and callbacks and chemistry tests.

162
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:36,512
I think he did an amazing job.

163
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:41,434
So we go from the Valley
of the privileged

164
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:46,230
into South Central LA,
which is not far from Compton.

165
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,860
This is a very, very dangerous place,
as you'll see very soon.

166
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,612
This is what Ice Cube writes about.

167
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,740
He says, “I saw how they lived
on the other side,

168
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,577
and I see how we live,

169
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,745
and this is unfair.

170
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,914
I'm gonna write about it.”

171
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:08,586
That's where you get a little bit
of that anger and a lot of passion

172
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,422
from Ice Cube as an artist.

173
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,758
This is one of my favorite moments
in the movie

174
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:18,929
because it feels so raw
and so real.

175
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:21,765
Growing up in Los Angeles
in the '80s

176
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:25,686
with all of the gang violence
and the dangers,

177
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,315
it's a very specific moment in time.

178
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:34,612
And you feel exactly where you are
immediately

179
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,490
when Michael Taylor-
that's his name-

180
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,618
His street name is Compton Menace.

181
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:45,789
You feel how dangerous Los Angeles is
just in this moment.

182
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,709
That's how it was,
and this guy is very real.

183
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,046
He's from Compton,
and he's had a street life.

184
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,298
That's the reason why I cast him.

185
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:59,803
Because I wanted the audience
to really feel the fear

186
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:04,266
and understand
that, at a moment's notice,

187
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,230
you could be in the sun,
enjoying a trip home on a school bus,

188
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:12,691
and, the next moment,
you could be killed.

189
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:18,697
That's how unpredictable
Los Angeles was at the time.

190
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:22,743
This is another thing
that motivated the lyrics

191
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:28,165
and the songs that N.W.A created.

192
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:33,587
So instead of talking about it,
I wanted the audience to feel it.

193
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:37,383
When you're a 16-year-old kid,

194
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:42,304
and someone pulls a gun to your head,
that's very traumatic.

195
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:46,058
They say that people
in these environments

196
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,520
suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.

197
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:54,525
And when people criticize
gangster rap specifically,

198
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,027
they don't realize where it comes from.

199
00:12:57,111 --> 00:13:02,032
That's one of the moments
that motivates this genre of music.

200
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,538
This is one of my favorite shots
in the movie.

201
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:14,253
My DP, Matty Libatique,
was so gracious in figuring it out.

202
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:19,967
I told him I wanted to do a great 12 o'clock
Boys motorcycle moment in the movie.

203
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:28,225
When you have a set of young guys
who stand up for what they believe in,

204
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,561
whether you agree with it or not,

205
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,480
I think there's a certain strength in that.

206
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,150
And when you grow up
in an environment

207
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,903
where you have all of these antagonistic
elements working against you

208
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:43,407
to disempower you, to discourage you,

209
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,826
I think there's something strong

210
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,246
in standing up and saying,
“I don't care what you think.”

211
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:56,253
I love this moment because
this shows how talented Dre is,

212
00:13:56,337 --> 00:14:00,924
and it shows how you don't have to have
a lot of money or a lot of resources,

213
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,801
but you can just create.

214
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,095
That's what's so cool about this moment.

215
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,266
It's quintessential hip-hop.

216
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,352
But you can just create.

217
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,937
That's what's so cool about this moment.

218
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,732
It's quintessential hip-hop.

219
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,193
It's like, “I am going to create.”

220
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,613
it's just two turntables
on an ironing board.

221
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,324
This guy is making music

222
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:29,244
with instruments they essentially created.

223
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,413
I love that about this moment.

224
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:35,084
It's very, very raw
and very inventive.

225
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,632
This is Jinx's bedroom.
Jinx is played by Cleavon McClendon.

226
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,467
This guy is really funny.

227
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,428
He's kind of comic relief.

228
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,515
I really liked him.
He did a great job in the audition.

229
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,892
He has little moments in the movie,

230
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:55,270
but they're really funny
and really potent.

231
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,113
Another reason why I love this moment
is because this is where it starts.

232
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:05,948
Dre has the music,

233
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,200
Cube has the lyrics.

234
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:13,539
This is where it all starts- in the bedroom
with two turntables on an ironing board.

235
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:17,751
You know, it's funny.
It wasn't called gangster rap back then.

236
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:20,003
The media coined that term.

237
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,297
They called it reality rap.

238
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:25,968
They wanted to talk about the things
that were going on in the neighborhood

239
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,636
and put it to music.

240
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:31,807
That's why Dre is saying,
“Listen, I want the hard-core stuff.

241
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,142
I want to really feel it.”

242
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:36,311
Of course, Cube has that stuff,
and you know why.

243
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,313
You see what motivates him.

244
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,983
One big thing
is what just happened on the bus.

245
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,735
And another little funny moment
is when he said,

246
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,904
“Hey. He gave a motivational speech.”

247
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,865
I thought that was really funny.

248
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,662
This is another moment
that motivates Cube

249
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,622
and his writing.

250
00:15:55,706 --> 00:16:00,210
This is a scene
where he gets harassed by the cops

251
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,004
for no reason whatsoever.

252
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,839
He just walks out of the house.

253
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,384
It's the same thing
with most of these kids out here.

254
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:10,262
They're being harassed.
They didn't do anything.

255
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:15,601
This is something
the LAPD would do constantly.

256
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,103
In the '80s, they would
call it gang sweeps.

257
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:20,939
They would come,
and they would search you

258
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,859
to see if you had any contraband,

259
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:27,070
any weapons,
any drugs or anything on you.

260
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:31,533
They would come sweep the neighborhood
and see who they could pick up and arrest.

261
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:38,916
The fact that his mom
is essentially violated in this scene

262
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,294
and his dad violated and humiliated

263
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:47,382
is another moment
where you really understand

264
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:51,470
what motivates Ice Cube
to write the lyrics that he writes,

265
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:54,473
especially for the song “Fuck tha Police.”

266
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:59,102
When you experience these things
time and time again,

267
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,063
over and over again,

268
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:05,901
you can't help but be inﬂuenced
by these moments.

269
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:10,656
It's sad to say that
it happened a lot back then.

270
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,574
It's happening now.

271
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,743
And it was important to show

272
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:18,705
that this kid didn't just wake up
in the suburbs

273
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,666
and decide to write these lyrics.

274
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:23,377
He was inﬂuenced by the things
that happened on the bus,

275
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,671
the things that happened
in his neighborhood,

276
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,923
and he was really passionate about it.

277
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,175
That's the reason why
people felt the music.

278
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:33,262
Because it was real.
It wasn't just made up.

279
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,098
Because it was real.
It wasn't just made up.

280
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:43,730
This is the introduction of MC Ren,

281
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,899
who's played by Aldis Hodge.

282
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,527
Really, really good actor.

283
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,738
He had the most experience
out of all the guys in the group.

284
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:54,533
Worked on the television show Leverage.

285
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:59,830
This is the friendship between two guys
that we're establishing as well.

286
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:04,084
I think they were associated
with the Crips back in the '80s,

287
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,921
and they're in Doo-To's,
which is a Blood club.

288
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,008
If you don't know anything about gangs,
they're mortal enemies.

289
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:16,179
So, the fact that Eazy-E and MC Ren's
walking into a Blood club

290
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,307
is really crazy.

291
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,643
Here's the introduction of DJ Yella,

292
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,021
who's played by Neil Brown, Jr.

293
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,441
He, again, is so fun to work with.

294
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,611
He's also comic relief
throughout the movie.

295
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,614
You'll see that as the movie unfolds.

296
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:38,744
That's another thing I love
about the structure of the movie

297
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,038
and how we define the characters.

298
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,458
Everyone has
their own different personalities.

299
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,793
Of course, we introduce Lonzo Williams,

300
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,962
who's played by Corey Reynolds.

301
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:52,007
This guy's really, really talented.

302
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,884
He's funny too.

303
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,012
You see the dynamic
between Dre and Lonzo.

304
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,598
There's this beef that's happening
between the two of them.

305
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:03,602
Because Lonzo wants him to do
the World Class Wreckin' Cru group,

306
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,896
which is, you know, the satin jackets

307
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:10,859
and the kind of Prince
and almost kind of Michael Jackson wear,

308
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,070
and Dre's not really with that.

309
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,488
You'll see how that story unfolds
as it unfolds,

310
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,574
You'll see how that story unfolds
as it unfolds,

311
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,786
but there's definitely static
between the two.

312
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,456
This is the do-or-die moment
for Ice Cube.

313
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,502
He's gonna get up on stage
with a hostile crowd,

314
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:31,254
and he's either gonna sink or swim.

315
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:35,092
It's the equivalent
of performing at the Apollo.

316
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:41,139
At first, the crowd is kind of questioning
who he is, where he's from.

317
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,974
What is he talking about?

318
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:46,478
See the guy folds his arms.
He's like, “Who is this dude?”

319
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:49,898
But then, when Cube keeps it real,

320
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,360
he's like, “lf you don't like how I'm livin',
well, fuck you.”

321
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:59,199
Then in a weird, strange way,
he wins the crowd over with his confidence.

322
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,911
And this song is “Gangsta Gangsta.”

323
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:06,957
And the track underneath
is “Weak at the Knees.”

324
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,835
This is the song that Dre sampled.

325
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,170
I love the original song.

326
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,172
I love “Gangsta Gangsta.”

327
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:17,426
I love what O'Shea Jackson, Jr.
did with this moment,

328
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,637
'cause he feels really confident
on stage.

329
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,685
And we established that
what Dre had envisioned actually works.

330
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:31,273
And of course, Eazy-E got a chance
to experience a little bit of that.

331
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,941
DJ Yella the same.

332
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:38,780
We also see that Dre is a hardhead.

333
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:42,284
He's not gonna listen to Lonzo
or anyone else, for that matter.

334
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,330
Now he's about to get his ass chewed out
by Lonzo for that very reason.

335
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:52,669
This is a funny moment because Lonzo's
tending to that Jheri curl of his.

336
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:58,258
And you can't take him serious.

337
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,428
You just can't take him serious.

338
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:05,807
Between the satin jacket and the Jheri curl,
it's a funny moment for me.

339
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,726
I just really liked it.

340
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,145
You see that shirt that he's wearing?

341
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:13,773
Lonzo is just a real caricature
of the real Lonzo.

342
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,151
But it's a fun moment.

343
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,239
With storytelling,
you deal a lot in motivations.

344
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:25,702
This is one of the motivations,
besides being broke.

345
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,079
He's motivated
to get out of this environment.

346
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:33,335
He doesn't want to continue
to do this old school music

347
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:39,424
and in this environment
with Lonzo's pressure.

348
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:44,095
So, you get a sense of why Dre
really wants to start his own thing.

349
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,266
He doesn't have a lot of money.
Of course, he's sleeping on his aunt's couch.

350
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,520
He comes up with this brilliant idea

351
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:54,648
to ask Eazy, “Hey, listen.

352
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:58,360
You're in the streets.
Of course, it's dangerous.

353
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,612
It's not gonna last.

354
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,698
Why don't you consider
getting into this music thing?”

355
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,951
This is where it all comes together,

356
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:10,622
or, at least, this is where you see Dre
pitching his heart out.

357
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:16,461
Because he's really done
with this whole Wreckin' Cru,

358
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:19,005
pink satin jackets

359
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:22,926
and the drama of being under Lonzo.

360
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,973
Dre wants to make changes.

361
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:34,187
And he wants to see if he can
convince Eazy to make changes.

362
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:40,402
Again, that's where we get a sense
of their relationship.

363
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,908
Now he's gotta go back to Lonzo.

364
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,793
This is one of those moments

365
00:22:56,876 --> 00:23:00,630
where I wish I had a little more time
to make it perfect.

366
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,632
We didn't have a lot of time
to shoot this scene,

367
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:06,094
so I didn't get all the shots
that I wanted to get.

368
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:12,017
But again, you get a real sense
of how much Dre loves his brother.

369
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,936
He just came out of nowhere
to defend his brother,

370
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,023
and his brother wasn't necessarily
even doing the right thing.

371
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,693
He was just causing trouble
in the parking lot.

372
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:25,530
Now LAPD shows up,
and they didn't see the punch.

373
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,449
Again, this happens a lot.

374
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:31,369
They walk into this environment
or they drive into this environment

375
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,788
and feel like they're runnin' the show.

376
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:37,042
And Dre is not havin' it.

377
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,044
He's like, “I am at home.

378
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:44,507
You can't just drive up
and basically tell us what to do.”

379
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:48,136
He stands his ground.
Dre's like that to this day.

380
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:54,768
Of course, you get
the relationship with law enforcement,

381
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:58,229
which is the same
as what just happened with Ice Cube.

382
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:01,399
You understand why these guys
feel the way they feel.

383
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,614
Which is the same
as what just happened with Ice Cube.

384
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,867
You understand why these guys
feel the way they feel.

385
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:16,956
Now we establish Eazy-E's '62 Impala.

386
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,294
This is the really expensive car
that he wouldn't drive to a drug deal.

387
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:26,508
He's in Compton
at the Compton courthouse,

388
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:29,469
and this is a really interesting moment

389
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:35,517
because they're right in front
of the Martin Luther King monument

390
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,102
in Compton.

391
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:41,815
It's a very, very popular spot,
very famous spot.

392
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,403
They're in front of the Martin Luther King
monument in Compton.

393
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:51,366
It's a very, very popular spot,
very famous spot.

394
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:55,328
I wanted to really show
that we were in Compton,

395
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:57,706
and this was one of the best ways
to show that.

396
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:05,422
This moment, of course,
is really uncomfortable for Eazy

397
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:09,426
because there are a lot of cops around.

398
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,929
He doesn't want to be there.

399
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,224
But in serving the theme of brotherhood,

400
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:20,729
he's gonna be there for Dre
to pick him up, to bail him out.

401
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,524
Where Lonzo is not there for Dre.

402
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:28,903
Again, the theme of brotherhood
is served.

403
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,489
I wanted to do that

404
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:35,160
so that people could understand
that it's not just about street toughs

405
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:38,329
and people out there
doing dangerous things.

406
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:41,416
This is about love,
and these guys have love for each other.

407
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,502
It pays off a little later on,

408
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:49,340
but I wanted to have a little levity
and a little fun and a little humor,

409
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,551
which I think they handled really well.

410
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,595
I wanted to do it in Compton.

411
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:56,931
Look at that guy.
It's just a great smile.

412
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,851
He has a great smile.
Jason is very-

413
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:04,272
He just has a magnetic personality,
which really works.

414
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,858
Because when you're dealing
with this genre of music

415
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,985
and a dangerous environment,

416
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,489
I really wanted to cast someone
who you could really root for,

417
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:16,367
especially given all the stuff they end up doing
and they're involved with.

418
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:20,371
But Jason is just magnetic,
and you can see that in his smile.

419
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:27,378
This moment's important because this is Dre
being the consummate businessman.

420
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,089
“Let's start a record label.

421
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:31,966
And let's do it on our own.”

422
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:35,720
You know, I think most people realize

423
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:39,140
that that was a great approach for Dre,
because now he's a billionaire.

424
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,267
That's where it all started.

425
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:49,651
The moment between H.B.O.-
Home Boys Only-

426
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:51,319
which is the group from New York.

427
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:55,740
It was a group that Dre wanted
to manage and put out.

428
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:59,327
They were supposed to do
“Boys-N-The-Hood” first.

429
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,247
Ultimately, it didn't work out.

430
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,915
I wonder where those guys are today.

431
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:08,920
I'm wondering if they know
that if they had done the song,

432
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:12,048
maybe they would be
just as famous as N.W.A.

433
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,133
But they decided not to.

434
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:19,806
And this serves as one of
the more funny moments in the movie.

435
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,351
And kinda crazy.

436
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:27,188
They really wanted to put Compton
on the map

437
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:32,360
because most of hip-hop was just about
what was going on in New York.

438
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:36,072
And you can see a little tension
between the guys from New York

439
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,991
and the guys from LA.

440
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,496
And you get a sense of the genesis
of West Coast hip-hop

441
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,417
because it was really
dominated by New York.

442
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,044
And rightfully so,
because it came from New York.

443
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:54,007
But Eazy was really proud of Compton.

444
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,467
And no one had heard of Compton.

445
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:59,637
These guys really wanted to say,
“Listen, we respect New York,

446
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,472
but we are not from New York.

447
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:05,351
We're from Compton,
and we want to put Compton on the map.”

448
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,312
And they stood their ground.

449
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:09,814
That's why most people around the world
know Compton.

450
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,775
It's because of what happened
in this very moment.

451
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,867
Eazy-E wasn't a rapper.

452
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,994
He was a businessman.

453
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,163
He didn't really care about
being an artist.

454
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:29,584
He just wanted to make money,
and I think he wanted to socialize.

455
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,544
You know, just like
any other young guy.

456
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:34,088
And so-

457
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:39,802
This is a funny line about
“I'm the Berry Gordy of the group.”

458
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,721
He just wanted to be the boss.
“I'm the boss.

459
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:45,975
You guys do that creative stuff
and let me know when you're done.”

460
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:51,397
Of course, Dre's genius
is displayed in this scene

461
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:55,568
where he's like, “Listen, we can't use Cube
'cause he's a part of a group.

462
00:28:56,444 --> 00:29:00,823
And you already paid for this studio time,
so why don't you just do it yourself?”

463
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,035
I'm glad he pushed,

464
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:08,665
because we wouldn't have this movie
if Dre didn't push in this very moment.

465
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:18,257
They convince Eazy
to get in the studio.

466
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,553
Now, if you don't understand art

467
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:25,390
or how artists work,

468
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:27,892
this is a huge moment.

469
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:31,229
You have a guy who is
essentially from the streets,

470
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,564
who deals drugs.

471
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:35,984
He's not into all of this type of stuff.

472
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:40,071
And Dre has it in his mind
that he's gonna make the leap

473
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:45,493
from street businessman
to rapper?

474
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:48,079
That's a huge leap.

475
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:52,333
And it's one of the funniest moments
in the movie.

476
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:58,923
You think about the fact that
Eazy just couldn't get it right.

477
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:03,094
And the average person would've-
They would've given up on him and said,

478
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:06,973
“You know what? This is not gonna work.
I'm gonna go find another group.”

479
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:10,643
But Dre is like a dog with a bone.

480
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,646
He just will not let go.
He's like that to this day.

481
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:17,108
If he feels something-
And he's very intuitive.

482
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:21,029
If he feels something,
he's gonna fight for it. And he did.

483
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:26,826
And he did it with every single line
in this song to create this moment.

484
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,662
You talk about motivation.

485
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:34,459
Between what Lonzo did
and having to leave home,

486
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,462
this is a do-or-die moment for Dre.

487
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:41,674
And he's gonna make it work,
come hell or high water.

488
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,342
And he did.

489
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:52,060
This is another moment
where we actually just improvised.

490
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:57,815
I have a lot of these moments where
you just feel like the script is good.

491
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:01,694
Jonathan Herman, who was one of the writers,
did a really good job with the script.

492
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:05,865
And of course Ice Cube and Scott Bernstein,
who's one of our producers-

493
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,825
we all worked a lot on the script.

494
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:12,038
But on the day when we're shooting,

495
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:15,041
I'm always going to look
to elevate the material.

496
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:18,836
And so I would allow
the actors to improvise

497
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,590
to make sure the moment
feels real and organic.

498
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:26,219
This is one of those moments where I just
let them go off and do their thing,

499
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:29,597
and it ended up extremely funny,

500
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,808
very natural.

501
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:37,522
And that's a testament
to the skill level of the artists

502
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:40,024
and the actors that I hired.

503
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:43,736
That's part of the thing.
That's part of what my job is-

504
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,489
to make sure I hire people

505
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:52,245
that not only can rehearse
and memorize their lines,

506
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:55,581
but who could make contributions.

507
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:59,710
And I think they're invested even more

508
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:02,130
when they feel like
they can make a contribution.

509
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,842
Now, this is obviously a famous moment

510
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:09,554
where we get that famous line,

511
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:11,472
“Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4.”

512
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:14,976
Which is quintessential N.W.A,

513
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,687
quintessential Eazy-E.

514
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:20,731
Everybody loves this song

515
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:25,069
and loves that particular track
and the opening of that track.

516
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:28,781
And to capture that on film,
it just felt good.

517
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:32,577
'Cause I remember when I was younger
and I heard it, I remember where I was,

518
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:37,165
and it was just great to be able
to capture that with a little humor

519
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:40,751
and to show that Dre is a genius

520
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:43,588
and Eazy is a risk taker.

521
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,549
And one of my favorite songs of all time,

522
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,468
to be able to capture that on film
was just a lot of fun.

523
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,973
Now we go back to the brotherhood.

524
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:58,603
These guys aren't hurting anyone.
They're just creating.

525
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,606
And you see the smiles
and the laughter

526
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:04,775
and how it's just a bunch of fun.

527
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,653
They are in an old, dusty garage

528
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:10,031
talking about their environment,

529
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:14,285
and you could just feel
the love in the room.

530
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:15,953
These guys just-

531
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,789
it was important for me
to really, really establish

532
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:22,835
that it's not about thuggery,
it's not about danger, all this stuff.

533
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,714
It's about these guys creating
in an environment that's warm,

534
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,050
and there's a connection between them.

535
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,511
Because later on,
you get a sense of what happened.

536
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:36,682
I want the audience to root for these guys
and root for their friendship

537
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,768
and root for the brotherhood

538
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:43,314
so that later on, when they're challenged
and the group disbands,

539
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:48,194
you wish for and hope for the days
that they were together.

540
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:53,074
This is one of those moments
where I subtly lead the audience and say,

541
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:56,953
“Listen, you should like these guys
and like who they are

542
00:33:57,036 --> 00:34:00,706
when they're together
and they're firing on all cylinders.”

543
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:04,085
So when it's not that way,
you feel the loss.

544
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:08,172
And of course Lonzo is hatin'.

545
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,131
That was one of the funniest moments
in the movie,

546
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,886
And of course Lonzo is hatin'.

547
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,055
That was one of the funniest moments
in the movie,

548
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:18,224
where he's like, “No, you got it!”

549
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,810
I remember when he did it,

550
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:24,355
we busted up laughing so loud.

551
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:27,274
Corey Reynolds
has great comedic instincts,

552
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,404
and again, it's just funny moments
and brotherhood.

553
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:36,283
The love in this room
is what you want to protect.

554
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:44,375
But of course,
as the story unfolds,

555
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,253
they run into their challenges.

556
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:53,050
But I love this moment.
This is the guys at their happiest.

557
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:55,094
You know?

558
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:59,682
With Tyree, the younger brother,
with the girls and the fun

559
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,476
and the brotherhood.

560
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,603
We, of course, have to do a montage

561
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:09,775
because we can't squeeze
all of that time into a short movie.

562
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:14,947
So we show that
they press up the album

563
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:18,325
and experience local success
in Los Angeles.

564
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:23,205
We show that Eazy, of course,
is using cash from his street money

565
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,416
to fund this whole thing.

566
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,877
Who's that hack?
Who's that guy?

567
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:31,213
That's my Hitchcock moment.

568
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:34,300
I wish I was a better actor,
but you guys have to suffer through it.

569
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,179
I'll apologize later.

570
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:45,186
This is an important moment
because we introduce Paul Giamatti,

571
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:47,313
who plays Jerry Heller.

572
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:52,359
This is one of the most talented actors
I've ever worked with ever.

573
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:58,532
I was there, I believe, somewhere
in the beginning of his career.

574
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,702
We worked a long time ago

575
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:04,663
on my third motion picture,
The Negotiator,

576
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,415
with Kevin Spacey and Sam Jackson.

577
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:09,043
He played this character, Rudy.

578
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:13,631
He was so talented then.
He's incredibly talented now.

579
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:16,300
I was so lucky to get him because-

580
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:22,723
As a director, you have a person in mind
when you read the script initially.

581
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:25,851
You know, you have your first choice.

582
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:28,604
And you don't always
get your first choice.

583
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:32,483
Sometimes they are busy,

584
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:36,195
you have scheduling conﬂicts
or they didn't respond to the material-

585
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,696
for whatever reason.

586
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,283
But Paul Giamatti was my first choice.

587
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:45,371
And I was lucky enough
to get my first choice.

588
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:50,709
But what was strange about it was
we didn't make the deal with Paul

589
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:55,131
until two days before
we started shooting this scene.

590
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:57,716
This was his first day of shooting.

591
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,471
And we had to put everything
together so quickly

592
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:05,349
with his wardrobe and his wig-

593
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,434
That's a wig, by the way.

594
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:09,311
Andrea Jackson did a pretty good job.

595
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,897
But that was a bad hair day for him.

596
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:14,733
First day, the wig's all over the place.

597
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:20,406
It was kinda funny, but he weathered it
and did a pretty damn good job.

598
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:23,367
But he's- Paul is so good.

599
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,453
There were times where
I would forget I was directing.

600
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:30,416
I would get lost in his performance
and forget to say “Cut.”

601
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:33,419
I'm like, “Okay. Cut, cut. Cut it. My bad.”

602
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:37,256
And I think that Paul,
as an anchor to the movie,

603
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:41,760
really motivated
and helped the younger guys.

604
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:45,306
Because this is a new cast,
with Jason and Shea.

605
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:49,435
Neil worked a little bit,
and of course Aldis had some experience.

606
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:53,939
But when you work with
a veteran like Paul,

607
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:56,108
it only makes you better.

608
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:59,987
And I think that's what he did.
He was the anchor of the cast.

609
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,364
And such a good personality

610
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:05,993
and a good attitude about everything.

611
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:09,955
'Cause the script- We did a lot of changing.
He didn't mind improvising.

612
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,458
And he just did a great job.

613
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:21,342
Now, Kelli Jones-

614
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:25,804
she's our costume designer,
our wardrobe person.

615
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:28,015
She did a great job as well.

616
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:31,518
If you look at that velour suit,
anybody from the '80s knows

617
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:36,065
that that suit, believe it or not,
was popular at one time.

618
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:40,152
Look at the suit,
the way it hangs on him.

619
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:41,737
That's his version of cool.

620
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,865
You'll see later on, when he starts
to make a little money,

621
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:47,618
that it's gonna change a little bit.

622
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:52,081
But right now he's working
in this record shop- Macola Records-

623
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:55,626
and as Cube would put it,

624
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,337
he wasn't doing the greatest.

625
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,591
He was managing groups and things
like that, but basicallyjust hustling.

626
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,178
This is where they meet

627
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:11,267
and he convinces Eazy that,
“You know what? I can make you legit.”

628
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,686
And after watching that first scene,

629
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:17,606
you understand why Eazy's motivated
to want to be legit.

630
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:23,988
And of course a little eye candy.

631
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,365
I want to thank Bone, our consultant,

632
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:31,453
'cause he did a good job at helping us
find authentic people,

633
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:36,125
gave us details of things
that really happened back in the day.

634
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:40,254
He did a really good job
at making things happen for us.

635
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:42,589
I want to definitely give a shout-out to Bone.

636
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:46,552
Skateland USA is in Compton-
or was in Compton.

637
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:48,637
And this is how it was.

638
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:52,182
I get a lot of people from Compton that said,
“You really, really captured that.

639
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:58,022
I was there for that particular concert
with Eazy-E and N.W.A,

640
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,149
and it felt perfect.”

641
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,026
I love to hear that.

642
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:07,072
You get a sense
of where the all-black comes from.

643
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:10,701
The Raiders gear,
the Kings gear.

644
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:14,705
And of course Yella didn't do
what he was supposed to do.

645
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:18,792
And of course Eazy-E's on top of it,
being the leader that he is.

646
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:33,891
This is a moment that's, again,

647
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:38,187
serving the individuality of Eazy-E
as a character.

648
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:42,733
Dre's about the creativity,

649
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:46,028
Cube is about the writing
and kinda the politics

650
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:49,281
because everyone's passed
on this music.

651
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:51,658
No one's really biting.

652
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:56,038
So if you don't really perform now,
this could be the end of it.

653
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,750
And that's not in the theatrical.

654
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:04,797
But I love the fact that he comes in
and just kind of raises the stakes.

655
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:09,968
This is a moment that's, again,

656
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:14,556
serving the individuality of Eazy-E
as a character.

657
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:19,061
Dre's about the creativity,

658
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:23,399
Cube is about the writing
and kinda the politics

659
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:27,236
and Eazy-E is about the money.

660
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:31,115
And you see that when he says,
“Listen, you know what?

661
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,367
Let's show them who we are

662
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,702
and let's go get this money.”

663
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,332
This is a defining moment for him.

664
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,962
“Dopeman” was extremely popular.

665
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:48,924
I remember when I first heard this song,
I was thinking,

666
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,219
“Wow, did they really say that
on a record?”

667
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,681
it's a crazy song,

668
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,975
and it's so cinematic.

669
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:01,478
And that's what I loved
about Cube's writing.

670
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:05,774
You can draw a straight line
from a song like this

671
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:07,734
that feels almost like a movie.

672
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:10,696
You can see everything
that he's saying

673
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:14,366
and you can draw a straight line
to Cube as a filmmaker,

674
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,994
as a writer, as a director,
as a producer.

675
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:19,163
And this is a young guy

676
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:23,542
who visualizes things
and writes about them.

677
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:27,671
So there's a direct connection
to movies.

678
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,715
And you see that.

679
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:34,344
And of course it's a great moment
for O'Shea Jackson, Jr.,

680
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:36,972
because he's rocking the crowd.

681
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,642
He's got full control,
he's very confident,

682
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:42,853
and that's exactly what I wanted.

683
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:45,731
But more important than that,

684
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:50,235
this is the first time
the group performs together

685
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,574
and the first time
the actors performed together onstage.

686
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:59,161
And so, psychologically,
this was a very important moment,

687
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:03,832
not only in the story for the group,
but for my actors.

688
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:08,504
If they got this right, then the rest
of the shoot would go well for us.

689
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:11,924
If they got this right, then the rest
of the shoot would go well for us.

690
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,218
But if they ran into any hiccups

691
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:19,598
or did something wrong
where it challenged their confidence,

692
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:23,435
it could have been disastrous
for the movie.

693
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:28,482
But they jumped out there
with the help of Dub-C William Calhoun,

694
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:30,609
who was a rap consultant.

695
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:36,198
He helped them all through the details
of performing West Coast-style

696
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:39,034
and all the little behavioral cues

697
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:41,620
and physical cues.

698
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:45,958
And DJ Robshot helped Corey
with the deejaying.

699
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,961
And also DJ Yella,
who is Neil Brown, Jr.

700
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:51,838
And so it all came together
in this one moment.

701
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:57,219
And you could see these guys
really rock the crowd.

702
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,012
And it felt real.

703
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:02,182
As a director,

704
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:08,814
you couldn't ask for a better
first performance out of your cast.

705
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:12,818
People have no idea
how challenging that is

706
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:17,072
to have to learn your lines,
wear a wig,

707
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:21,159
pretend like you're in the '80s
and rap for the first time.

708
00:44:21,243 --> 00:44:22,995
This is what a lot of these guys
were doing,

709
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:26,081
And also DJ Yella,
who is Neil Brown, Jr.

710
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,542
And so it all came together
in this one moment.

711
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:35,132
As a director, you couldn't ask
for a better first performance

712
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:37,009
out of your cast.

713
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:40,804
And again, shout-out to Dub-C.

714
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:45,100
He did such a great job at making those guys
feel comfortable on stage.

715
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:50,856
This scene is a moment
where the guys are young

716
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:56,320
and to a certain extent
just celebrating and innocent, you know.

717
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:59,656
The brotherhood theme is served.

718
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,826
And of course we have
the introduction of Suge Knight,

719
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,078
who's played by Marcos Taylor.

720
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:11,710
Now, the story behind Marcos
is that he's not an actor.

721
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:15,088
He's a stuntman,

722
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:18,467
and more than that,
he's actually an MMA fighter.

723
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:23,472
I had such a hard time
finding a Suge Knight character,

724
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:27,017
because everybody
is so familiar with who he is

725
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:31,104
that I had to go
the unconventional route.

726
00:45:31,188 --> 00:45:35,776
And at the last minute-
we call it midnight casting-

727
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:39,780
my stunt coordinator, Lin Oeding,

728
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:43,075
he brought Marcos Taylor
to the table and said,

729
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:46,036
“I have a guy who looks like Suge.
He's not an actor.

730
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,247
But maybe you could work with him.”

731
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:51,708
And when he came to the set,

732
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:55,212
when we were shooting
the battering ram scene,

733
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:58,590
I saw his guy and I'm like,
“Wow, he really does look like him.”

734
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:02,886
He auditioned with a couple other guys
while we were shooting.

735
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:07,724
And I said, “Although he's not an actor-
he's just used to fighting-

736
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:09,684
there may be something there.”

737
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:12,604
And there were some challenges because,
again, you're working with someone

738
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:13,939
there may be something there.”

739
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:21,238
And I think that Marcos
did a great job as well.

740
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:24,908
And there were some challenges because,
again, you're working with someone

741
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:28,537
who's not used
to the rhythm of making movies.

742
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:33,834
But, all in all, this guy stepped up
and really delivered.

743
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:39,005
And, of course, we introduce Bryan Turner,
who is played by Tate Ellington.

744
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:42,509
This is another good moment,
I think, for Dr. Dre,

745
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:44,803
This is another good moment,
I think, for Dr. Dre,

746
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:50,392
because you show that he definitely
needs to make a choice,

747
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:54,146
especially given
the financial situation that he's in.

748
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:55,981
But he's not just gonna settle.

749
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,858
So he challenges Bryan.

750
00:46:57,941 --> 00:47:01,736
He's like, “Hey, listen. Who's on your label?
We never heard of you.”

751
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:06,700
And I'm sure Jerry's thinking,
“What the fuck are you doing?

752
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:09,327
The only guy who's interested
in representing you guys

753
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:11,371
and signing you guys

754
00:47:11,455 --> 00:47:14,791
is about to give you a deal,
and you're questioning that?”

755
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:17,711
That's just Dre.
He wants it to be right.

756
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:22,048
And that's a theme that really
runs with his character,

757
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:26,261
because he's not gonna do it
just to do it- he wants it to be right.

758
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:30,390
This is the first time you see that.

759
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:36,938
So far, the collaboration
between Jerry and Eazy is working.

760
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:38,857
They get a record deal,

761
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,444
and now they move
from Lonzo's dusty garage

762
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:44,446
to Audio Achievements.

763
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:47,282
Now this is really serious for Dr. Dre,

764
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:51,912
and he wanted to let everybody know
this is our lives, this is our creativity,

765
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:55,373
and we'd better do
the best we possibly can.

766
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:57,542
And he makes it clear.

767
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:03,673
In this montage, you get a chance
to listen to the different songs.

768
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:05,258
I love it.

769
00:48:05,342 --> 00:48:07,219
This montage helps a lot,

770
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:11,848
because MC Ren doesn't get
a ton of time in the movie

771
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:16,895
and you really get a chance to see
how talented he is and hear his song.

772
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,814
You also get a chance
to see Dre on the mike,

773
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:22,943
because Dre wasn't really
rapping that much back then.

774
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:26,738
Showing a little bit of “Express Yourself'
really had to help show

775
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:30,617
that each one of these guys
had a very specific talent

776
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,246
and they all contributed to the album
Straight Outta Compton.

777
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:42,170
This montage also showed better times-

778
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:48,260
the brotherhood with the guys
and the fun times and the smiles.

779
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:52,722
It's not about threats
or danger or drama.

780
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:57,435
It's really just about the love
that these guys have for their art,

781
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:00,480
their creativity and for each other.

782
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:04,109
And of course later on
it gets challenging.

783
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:08,280
But these are the good times,
and you really feel that.

784
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:10,615
Our deal with Priority Records is done.

785
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:13,243
This is Jerry doing his job.

786
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:15,996
He gets out there.

787
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,626
He brokers the deal with Bryan Turner
and Priority Records,

788
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:25,380
and this is where you get a sense

789
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:30,176
that Cube is not necessarily happy
with everything that's going on.

790
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,012
It's a funny moment with the straws.

791
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:35,140
But really the definition of the scene is,

792
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:38,518
“Hey, listen, what's going on
with our contracts?”

793
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:42,814
Because Cube, as you'll find out,
never had a contract with N.W.A.

794
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,526
He was part of the group,
he wrote a lot of the songs,

795
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,528
but he did not have a contract.

796
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:51,114
And you got a sense of his doubt.

797
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:55,410
Keep an eye on that hamburger right there.
It pays off in the next scene.

798
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:03,334
This is another thing
that motivates Dr. Dre.

799
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:08,006
His baby's mom is really, really incensed.

800
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:11,217
She hates the fact that
they're sleeping at his aunt's house.

801
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:15,722
She packed up all of his kid's things,
all of her things

802
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:17,432
and moved out of Jinx's house.

803
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,642
She's had it.
She's done with it.

804
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:22,187
She thinks he's out screwing around,

805
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:25,774
just playing around
and not taking care of his responsibility,

806
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:30,028
and she just drives off
with his kid and everything.

807
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:33,740
And this is something that-
You feel a little bad for Dre.

808
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:36,868
You feel like, wow,
this guy is actually trying,

809
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:39,120
and nothing's going right.

810
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:46,169
Now, to add on to this moment
where he essentially loses his woman

811
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:49,380
and close contact with his child,

812
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:51,966
here comes the Torrance police.

813
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:56,513
This actor who plays the black cop,
his name is lnny Clemons.

814
00:50:56,596 --> 00:51:01,726
Very talented actor
who, actually, I hired the night before.

815
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:05,063
What's strange is,
he assisted me on this movie.

816
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:07,565
He's a part of
the midnight casting as well.

817
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:09,400
We wanted to put a black officer in

818
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:13,988
so that the relationship with law enforcement
wouldn't be just racial.

819
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:19,452
It wasn't just white and black.
It was, hey, this is just about abuse of power.

820
00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:21,121
Doesn't matter what color you are.

821
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:23,623
If you have power and you're abusing it,

822
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:27,377
we wanted to really show
that it came from all sides.

823
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,170
And he did a great job.

824
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:34,259
I think it's one of the strongest,
more potent moments in the movie.

825
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:37,137
I always get chills
when I watch this scene

826
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:42,225
because you see the guys on the ground
for absolutely no reason.

827
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,771
And I created a shot

828
00:51:46,855 --> 00:51:51,609
where you really
define the relationship

829
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:57,115
between these particular cops
and N.W.A.

830
00:51:57,198 --> 00:51:59,951
They really treat them like trash.

831
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,370
You see that shot right there?

832
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:07,500
There's boots and garbage
next to their faces.

833
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:12,922
And I just wanted to give the audience
a sense of how the guys felt.

834
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:14,716
They felt like trash.

835
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:20,054
And they're next to the boots
of these officers

836
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:24,100
while they're having
a casual conversation with Jerry

837
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:26,978
about the merits of what's happening.

838
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:30,732
And that's a violation.

839
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:33,860
And you really feel that.

840
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:37,363
It's not something you have
to intellectualize. You feel that.

841
00:52:37,447 --> 00:52:41,326
That's part of the reason why it's one
of the stronger moments in the movie.

842
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:46,414
Because these guys were just artists
doing their thing.

843
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,416
They didn't break the law.

844
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:51,836
But they're being treated like trash.

845
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,089
And as an American citizen-

846
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:58,384
Not to get too preachy,
but that's fucked up.

847
00:52:59,636 --> 00:53:01,221
But let me be clear.

848
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:04,515
This is not an anti-cop movie.

849
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:08,603
This movie is about a music group
that made history.

850
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:12,232
There are a lot of
little sub-story lines,

851
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:15,777
and their relationship with law enforcement
was part of that.

852
00:53:16,778 --> 00:53:18,947
The point is,

853
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:23,451
any form of excessive force
is wrong.

854
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:26,537
And that's what this scene represented.

855
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:31,834
And I think that's what the song
that they're about to sing represents.

856
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:35,797
But I wanna be clear-
there are good cops out there

857
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,050
and there are cops
that overstep their boundaries.

858
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:43,096
And we hope that everyone
gets a sense

859
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,890
of what it feels like to be violated.

860
00:53:45,974 --> 00:53:50,144
And maybe it changes the culture
in which this happens.

861
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:52,939
And that's what we're hoping for.

862
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:58,152
What I liked about the last scene
is Jerry takes up for the guys.

863
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:02,573
You get a good sense of why
he has a relationship with Eazy.

864
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:05,618
He's there,
he's defending the guys,

865
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:08,121
and he even gets a sense

866
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:12,834
of how abusive law enforcement
can be with the guys.

867
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,420
And you really get a sense of
how they all come together-

868
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:18,840
not just the brothers,
but Jerry as well.

869
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:23,594
The song “Fuck tha Police”
is obviously a reaction

870
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:26,222
to all of the moments
that led up to this,

871
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:30,727
<i>but this is part of the montage
of</i> making <i>Straight Outta Compton.</i>

872
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:34,689
And you get a sense
of the guys coming together,

873
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:38,359
how much fun it was
just being in the studio

874
00:54:38,443 --> 00:54:41,195
with no supervision,

875
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:45,700
just everybody
really fully expressing themselves

876
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,453
and just being happy about it.

877
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:50,621
Eazy gets off on the mike.

878
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:52,957
Cube gets off on the mike.
Dre gets off on the mike.

879
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:55,043
Ren gets off on the mike.

880
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:58,212
And you see the fruits of their labor.

881
00:54:59,756 --> 00:55:02,133
They're all happy
that the album was made.

882
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:07,138
They're all happy that not only
did they experience local success,

883
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:12,226
but they experience national success.

884
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:14,395
Now, Crenshaw Boulevard-

885
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:16,647
this is the strip.

886
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:22,487
I remember cruising Crenshaw Boulevard
in the '80s, and that was so much fun.

887
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:26,032
There's a movie called American Grafifi/
where they have a strip

888
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:29,410
where Ron Howard and his friends
kinda hang out,

889
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:32,663
and you get a sense of how much fun
they had with all the custom cars.

890
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:36,626
This is the equivalent of that,
but the black version.

891
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,004
Crenshaw was so much fun.
I loved shooting that scene

892
00:55:40,088 --> 00:55:46,010
because you got a sense of how creative
everyone was in that environment-

893
00:55:46,094 --> 00:55:49,972
In the hood, without a lot of resources,
they're customizing all these cars,

894
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:54,602
with the Suzuki Samurais,
with the El Caminos and the lowriders.

895
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,687
It's just a great moment.

896
00:55:58,523 --> 00:56:01,359
This particular scene didn't make it
in the theatrical cut,

897
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:04,028
but I thought it was really funny.

898
00:56:04,112 --> 00:56:06,614
They actually put it in the trailers,

899
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:10,827
but it didn't make it in the theatrical cut
for time purposes.

900
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,871
But Eazy was always strapped.

901
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:19,627
He was known for having
this semi-automatic or-

902
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,921
I'm not really sure.
It could have been a machine gun.

903
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,006
But it had a big silencer on it.

904
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:27,802
I talked to my prop guy,
Mike Sexton,

905
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:32,432
and I really wanted him to make sure
he got the gun right.

906
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:37,270
And instead of kind of creating
a dangerous moment,

907
00:56:37,353 --> 00:56:40,398
the two times we show that gun,
it's actually really funny,

908
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:42,150
and this is one of them.

909
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,572
And of course, we start the tour.

910
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:52,827
This is the only tour I believe N.W.A.
went on, at least with Ice Cube,

911
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,496
and we start in Houston, Texas.

912
00:56:56,038 --> 00:57:01,794
I went to the Cannes Film Festival
for another film that I produced,

913
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:06,048
and Matthew McConaughey told me
he went to this concert.

914
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:07,592
He had this whole story

915
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:13,473
about how he was the only white guy
with his friend in this concert

916
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:15,141
and he had a blast.

917
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:16,893
That's what I love about N.W.A.

918
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:20,813
No matter who you run into,
they have an N.W.A. story,

919
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:23,774
whether it's something
that they experienced on the tour,

920
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:28,279
or at least they knew where they were
when they first heard the group.

921
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:32,200
That's why I believe this movie
is so universally loved.

922
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:34,827
It's because the group was universally loved.

923
00:57:34,911 --> 00:57:36,412
They had their haters,

924
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:39,790
but there was a lot of people who
loved them because they were honest,

925
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,585
and it touched a lot of people
outside of Los Angeles

926
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,712
and even outside of the States.

927
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:53,513
We shot that in the daytime.
We just digitally effected that.

928
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:56,557
This is a scene that did not make it
in the theatrical release.

929
00:57:56,641 --> 00:57:59,519
I thought it was one of the funnier moments.

930
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:03,272
But again, of course, we can't have
a three-hour theatrical movie,

931
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:05,066
so we had to cut it out.

932
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:10,571
But Neil Brown, Jr. is so matter-of-fact
about watching porn

933
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:14,575
on the bus with these guys.

934
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:16,619
It just shows how funny it is

935
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:20,456
and how they had a lot of fun
with each other,

936
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:24,001
and they're just a bunch of kids.

937
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:25,586
People took them so serious.

938
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:29,048
They were labeled
the world's most dangerous group.

939
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:30,883
But when you watch the movie,

940
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:33,553
you realize they weren't as dangerous
as people said.

941
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:36,556
They were just a bunch of young guys

942
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:38,849
who wanted to have fun
and express themselves.

943
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:40,268
And they made history.

944
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:45,439
But that was just one of the funnier moments.

945
00:58:45,982 --> 00:58:48,359
This is a funny moment as well.

946
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:53,614
But we start this scene off
with Dre talking to his brother,

947
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:56,993
really showing that he's concerned
and really showing that,

948
00:58:57,076 --> 00:59:02,164
“Hey, listen, although I'm in the midst of all
this fun, I love you. How's Mom doing?”

949
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:05,334
And showing that he really cares
about his family.

950
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:08,588
You don't get that with the records.

951
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:13,009
A lot of times, people just associate
negativity with what they're talking about,

952
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:19,223
but the point of the movie is they're
human beings beyond the music

953
00:59:19,307 --> 00:59:21,142
and beyond the genre of music.

954
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:23,060
They have their good days and bad days.

955
00:59:23,144 --> 00:59:29,066
You show how much Dre loves his family,
and it really humanizes these guys.

956
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,569
That's part of the point as well.

957
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:38,618
These two guys are really from the streets.

958
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:41,412
That's why the movie feels so real.

959
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:47,168
I really wanted to cast guys
who you really felt the danger.

960
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:51,672
This one shot was so hard to get

961
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:55,426
because it takes place in two rooms
and a hallway.

962
00:59:58,137 --> 01:00:03,934
Matty Libatique did such a great job
at creating moments like this

963
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:08,689
and helping me create moments like this
that didn't feel like the average coverage.

964
01:00:08,773 --> 01:00:13,486
Everyone had to get everything right
and the timing had to be perfect.

965
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:15,529
This is one of my favorite moments, too,

966
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:20,493
where Jason is like,
“She's just sucking dick.”

967
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:26,290
I'm sorry. it's funny because you see
where his priorities are.

968
01:00:26,374 --> 01:00:29,710
Then he lifts up this bed
and pulls out a shotgun.

969
01:00:29,794 --> 01:00:34,131
It just shows how these young guys
are, one moment, partying

970
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:36,759
and the next moment ready to go to war.

971
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:40,471
Again, you see how
the brothers come together,

972
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:44,725
and there's nothing that can challenge them.

973
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:52,608
I thought this was a really clever line
that Jason came up with.

974
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:57,863
You really, really get a sense
that this group is impenetrable.

975
01:00:58,698 --> 01:01:00,866
That's what I wanted to set up,

976
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:04,412
so you really felt it when things
start to go wrong.

977
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:09,500
You really don't want this group of guys
in this hallway to break up.

978
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,919
You just know they're gonna
be together forever.

979
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:17,133
Now this moment right here with Felicia

980
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:19,969
and the “Bye, Felicia” moment,
that was improvised.

981
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:22,888
Most people think we set that up.
No one could have wrote it.

982
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:25,099
Shea came up with that line,

983
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:29,103
and it's an homage
to my first movie, <i>Friday,</i>

984
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:32,064
which obviously I did with his dad,
Ice Cube.

985
01:01:32,148 --> 01:01:35,484
The audience goes nuts when they see
that “Bye, Felicia” moment.

986
01:01:35,568 --> 01:01:38,028
I still to this day don't know
why it's a phenomenon,

987
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:40,990
but “Bye, Felicia” lives on.

988
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:50,374
“Gangsta Gangsta” has to be
one of my favorite N.W.A. songs.

989
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:54,837
I love the way he captures this,
because he's just into it.

990
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,214
He just really, really gets into it.

991
01:01:57,298 --> 01:02:00,593
It's such a vivid, visual song.

992
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:04,221
Again, it's a testament to Ice Cube
and his talent.

993
01:02:04,305 --> 01:02:05,806
He's just really, really good.

994
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:09,393
You feel like you're in the scene
when you listen to those moments.

995
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:14,482
Now you start to feel the pressure
from outside forces.

996
01:02:15,483 --> 01:02:17,067
It starts with law enforcement

997
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:19,820
and their reaction
to the album Straight <i>Outta</i> Compton.

998
01:02:19,904 --> 01:02:22,406
And more specifically, “Fuck tha Police.”

999
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:25,951
Again, it's a testament to Ice Cube
and his talent.

1000
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:32,416
Now you start to feel the pressure
from outside forces.

1001
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,210
It starts with law enforcement

1002
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:37,087
and their reaction
to the album Straight <i>Outta</i> Compton.

1003
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:39,673
And more specifically, “Fuck tha Police.”

1004
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:46,263
This scene really sets up the fact
that it goes well beyond LAPD.

1005
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:49,475
Now the FBI is getting involved.

1006
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:53,312
And Ice Cube's point,
and the group's point, for that matter,

1007
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:58,943
is why is it
that it's in our Constitution

1008
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:01,779
that we have the right of freedom of speech

1009
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:06,617
but we can't really speak our mind
in our records?

1010
01:03:07,368 --> 01:03:10,329
This is a testament to Eazy's genius,

1011
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:11,789
where he says, “You know what?

1012
01:03:11,872 --> 01:03:15,125
If we're going to be challenged
by the government,

1013
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:17,670
then we're gonna make money off of it.

1014
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:21,423
We're gonna create publicity to surround

1015
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:27,304
what is clearly an illegal push
to silence us and to censor us.”

1016
01:03:27,388 --> 01:03:31,809
For Eazy to be so young
but to be so savvy,

1017
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:36,146
it really shows how street knowledge
really kicks in.

1018
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:41,485
You don't necessarily have to have an MBA
to understand business and to be savvy.

1019
01:03:41,569 --> 01:03:43,654
And Eazy was extremely savvy.

1020
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:46,073
This is one of those moments that really-

1021
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:51,078
it was a pivotal moment.
It changed the course of history,

1022
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,122
especially for the group.

1023
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:55,207
They used it.
They didn't cower,

1024
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:58,627
and they didn't shy away from the challenge.

1025
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:02,506
I don't know how Jerry Heller
felt about it, but-

1026
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:05,509
He seemed to not want
to go down this road.

1027
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:08,721
He seemed a little hesitant, to say the least.

1028
01:04:08,804 --> 01:04:10,639
I can understand why he would,

1029
01:04:10,723 --> 01:04:14,184
but you have a bunch of young guys
that are really passionate.

1030
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:18,188
And Cube always says,
“We didn't really give a shit about the FBI

1031
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:21,150
'cause we didn't know
to what extent they had power.

1032
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:24,528
We just thought it was just a letter.
A letter can't hurt us.

1033
01:04:24,612 --> 01:04:27,406
If it was the LAPD-
which, you know,

1034
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:30,117
we've been at the other end of a billy club-
we'd be worried.

1035
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,621
But this is the FBI.
We just see those guys dressed in suits

1036
01:04:35,331 --> 01:04:37,458
and walking around offices on television.”

1037
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,543
So they weren't really that...

1038
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,004
fazed.

1039
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,089
They just kept going.

1040
01:04:45,466 --> 01:04:48,802
Of course, there was the controversy.

1041
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:51,555
There are people around the nation
that love the guys,

1042
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:54,016
but there are some people
who really did not feel it.

1043
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,518
They felt like some of the lyrics
were misogynistic.

1044
01:04:56,602 --> 01:05:01,982
They felt like the lyrics were really negative.

1045
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:05,736
And we represented that
in that one little moment

1046
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:09,657
where everyone wasn't in love with the group.

1047
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:16,121
You start to see that all the fun
that led up to this moment

1048
01:05:16,205 --> 01:05:18,123
is starting to really change.

1049
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:19,917
This moment is a lot of fun.

1050
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,336
We shot this in 1O minutes.

1051
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:27,424
My production designer wasn't in love with
the fact that we trashed that bus with beer.

1052
01:05:27,508 --> 01:05:29,009
But it's N.W.A.

1053
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:31,470
What do you expect?
They're on tour.

1054
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:35,891
We have a “war on drugs” moment
with Nancy Reagan.

1055
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:38,644
That's something for those
who are a little political

1056
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:40,854
and understand what that means.

1057
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:49,822
Again, a moment where the group
starts to splinter.

1058
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:52,116
More specifically, Ice Cube.

1059
01:05:52,658 --> 01:05:57,871
He brings up the contracts earlier
before the Torrance moment with the cops,

1060
01:05:57,955 --> 01:05:59,665
and now he's bringing it up again.

1061
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:02,042
This time, he's a little angry.

1062
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:07,715
He sees that these guys are having lobster.
They're eating Fatburger.

1063
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:13,387
And there's just this disparity
between how they're living-

1064
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,723
being Eazy and Jerry-

1065
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:17,599
and how the group's living.

1066
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:19,268
And it doesn't feel right.

1067
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:22,312
On top of that,
he's doing all this work,

1068
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:24,732
he's not really getting paid what he deserves,

1069
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:26,775
and he's standing up for himself.

1070
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:33,031
It takes a lot of balls for a young guy
without pretty much any money at all,

1071
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:36,076
who lives at home with his mom and dad,

1072
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,662
to challenge his bosses.

1073
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:42,583
Because that's essentially who they are.
They run the show.

1074
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:46,670
But he has a sense that something's wrong,

1075
01:06:46,754 --> 01:06:48,797
and, at every turn
he's gonna challenge them.

1076
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:50,632
I actually respected that.

1077
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:52,926
I actually respected that.

1078
01:06:56,013 --> 01:07:02,102
Another really good moment
for O'Shea Jackson, Jr.

1079
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:04,813
This guy really showed up

1080
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:08,025
and really performed.

1081
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:11,195
And he's in there with a heavyweight.

1082
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:14,948
Paul Giamatti is really great at what he does

1083
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:17,993
and you really feel the weight of that moment.

1084
01:07:21,997 --> 01:07:24,708
I love how expressive Jerry is, his eyes.

1085
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,919
You always know there's subtext there.

1086
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:29,087
It's one thing for him to say something,

1087
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:32,049
but you always know there's something
else going on behind his eyes,

1088
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:35,219
and that's the brilliance of Paul Giamatti.

1089
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:41,475
Now Cube is really trying to figure out
if everyone has a chance.

1090
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:44,269
More specifically,
does Dre know what's going on.

1091
01:07:44,353 --> 01:07:46,313
Do you see what I see?

1092
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:50,192
Dre is like, “Listen, man,
I have too much going on.

1093
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:52,152
I want this to work.”

1094
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:59,993
This moment is a great moment,

1095
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:04,331
and it really draws on
what Corey Hawkins is good at.

1096
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:09,002
All of that training at Juilliard
and his dramatic training

1097
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:11,547
really pays off in this scene.

1098
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:15,175
Because it's really hard for a young man-

1099
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:19,638
especially a young black man
from DC and from the streets-

1100
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:22,099
to tap into his emotions.

1101
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:24,017
Or at least I've found that,

1102
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:28,188
in dealing with people
who are acting or who attempt to act,

1103
01:08:28,272 --> 01:08:34,236
to really tap into their vulnerable side
or to show any vulnerability at all.

1104
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,572
And the training really helped.

1105
01:08:36,655 --> 01:08:40,117
Because I was always nervous
about shooting scenes like this

1106
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:44,162
because you're so used to not going there

1107
01:08:44,246 --> 01:08:46,707
that when you do, it feels false.

1108
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:50,877
That's been my experience
with younger talent.

1109
01:08:52,713 --> 01:08:54,923
That when you do, it feels false.

1110
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:59,386
That's been my experience
with younger talent.

1111
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:02,556
They just have a hard time going there
and making it feel real.

1112
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,808
But when someone's trained,

1113
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:08,145
you can just press a button
and they'll get there.

1114
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:14,776
This moment between the guys is one
of the most important moments

1115
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:20,949
because the theme of brotherhood
is really captured in this sequence

1116
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:23,827
when Dre's brother dies.

1117
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,412
They all come together.

1118
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:31,168
You normally don't associate a lot of emotion

1119
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:33,837
with this genre of music.

1120
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,589
You just don't.

1121
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,675
Or vulnerability. You just don't.

1122
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:43,680
This is where you see all of these guys
really show another side.

1123
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:49,603
This moment between the guys is one
of the most important moments

1124
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:55,692
because the theme of brotherhood
is really captured in this sequence

1125
01:09:55,776 --> 01:09:58,612
when Dre's brother dies.

1126
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:00,364
They all come together.

1127
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:05,994
You normally don't associate a lot of emotion

1128
01:10:06,078 --> 01:10:08,622
with this genre of music.

1129
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,415
You just don't.

1130
01:10:10,499 --> 01:10:13,460
Or vulnerability. You just don't.

1131
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:18,382
This is where you see all of these guys
really show another side.

1132
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:22,761
And to show that,
“Hey, Dre, you are important to us.

1133
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:24,638
You're important to me.
I love you.

1134
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:27,474
I love you as a brother
and you'll never lose me.

1135
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,143
And we know this is challenging.

1136
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:35,065
It's probably the most challenging time
of your life, and we have your back.”

1137
01:10:37,526 --> 01:10:40,195
Another great moment with Lisa Renee Pitts.

1138
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:46,243
She's just so solid and grounded.

1139
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:50,038
And, you know,

1140
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:59,881
to get this relationship with Dre
and his mom is so important.

1141
01:10:59,965 --> 01:11:06,847
Because the group is always attacked
about their relationship to women

1142
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:10,016
and how they don't care

1143
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,477
and how negative it could be sometimes.

1144
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:13,979
It was important for me to show

1145
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:17,190
that that's not their relationship
in real life with women.

1146
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:20,277
And I love that moment
between Dre and his mom.

1147
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,113
This is one of my favorite shots in the movie

1148
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:25,574
because it's family.

1149
01:11:26,992 --> 01:11:30,579
Now for the Detroit police sequence.

1150
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:34,583
This was a really fun, fun sequence to shoot.

1151
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:36,710
That's Greg Collins, the cop.

1152
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,462
He's a really good actor,

1153
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:43,049
and all of the cops next to him
are actually real.

1154
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:45,802
They're from LAPD.
They're on-duty cops.

1155
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:50,348
They actually had a good attitude
about us shooting this sequence

1156
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:53,518
after hearing the song “Fuck tha Police”
over and over and over again

1157
01:11:53,602 --> 01:11:55,312
over the course of three days.

1158
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:58,356
I think they had
just a good attitude about it.

1159
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:03,904
I like this sequence because,
when you're being bullied,

1160
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,739
sometimes you have to stand up.

1161
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,158
That's what this sequence represents.

1162
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:12,412
Freedom of speech
applies to everyone in this country.

1163
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:16,666
It's a constitutional right, and that's what
these guys are basically saying.

1164
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:18,960
You cannot bully us,
we can say what we want,

1165
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:22,422
we can feel what we want to feel,
and as long as we're not breaking the law,

1166
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:26,009
you have no right to tell us what to do
and/or say.

1167
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:32,432
This is somewhat of a bittersweet moment.

1168
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:34,768
This is one of their best songs.

1169
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:38,730
This is one of the best sequences
in terms of performance

1170
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:41,650
that my actors gave.

1171
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:47,948
But at the same time, it's really heavily
politicized by a lot of Americans

1172
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:51,034
and also by some politicians.

1173
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:55,038
It's bittersweet
because it's such a good moment

1174
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:59,876
where you feel that these characters
are standing up to bullies,

1175
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,337
and you understand why.

1176
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:05,924
But at the same time,

1177
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:09,803
there's death and destruction
that's happening in the streets of America,

1178
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:13,723
and it's wrong on both sides.

1179
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:17,561
We don't advocate violence
against American civilians

1180
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:22,065
and certainly don't advocate violence
against law enforcement.

1181
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:26,319
People have taken this song

1182
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:31,324
and they've taken parts of this movie
and tried to politicize it,

1183
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:32,993
and I think it's unfair.

1184
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:37,747
So it's a bittersweet moment for me
because it's necessary.

1185
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:39,833
But at the same time,

1186
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:43,336
it's specific to the moment in time
when it was performed,

1187
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,046
when it was created,

1188
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:48,883
and I don't want any of these moments
to be taken out of context.

1189
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:56,182
This cable cam shot was very hard
to not only achieve and execute,

1190
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:58,310
but just even the design,
it was crazy.

1191
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:01,521
Because it went from way back there
in the wide shot

1192
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:04,566
all the way to wrap around
a close-up of his finger.

1193
01:14:06,026 --> 01:14:09,029
My line producer, Adam Merims,

1194
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:11,489
did a great job at really making that happen.

1195
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:14,117
That's one of those mountain requests
that you make.

1196
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,036
“L want you to move this mountain.
Make it happen.”

1197
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:17,871
He made it happen.

1198
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:22,334
Now one of my favorite shots happens

1199
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:25,378
right coming up about here.

1200
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:30,216
I just love, like, how all three of them

1201
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,928
just emphatically started the song.

1202
01:14:34,012 --> 01:14:39,267
Because it's just, again,
the synergy with all the guys.

1203
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:41,645
You just knew they were all together,

1204
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:44,564
and there's no one who could challenge them.

1205
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:46,358
It's just a great moment.

1206
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:49,235
It's a great moment in the film.
It's a great moment in music.

1207
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:50,945
It's a great moment in history.

1208
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:54,574
It says, “Listen, you should stand up.
You stand up for what you believe

1209
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:56,910
regardless of who's challenging you.”

1210
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:58,745
And I love it.

1211
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:04,584
I love this performance because
this is the biggest concert scene

1212
01:15:04,668 --> 01:15:07,045
we had to shoot, at the Joe Louis Arena.

1213
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:09,089
Of course, it was the LA Sports Arena.

1214
01:15:09,631 --> 01:15:12,217
I loved what the group delivered.

1215
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,885
I loved what my actors delivered.

1216
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:17,222
They did a great job at performing both songs,

1217
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:20,642
“Straight Outta Compton,”
and more specifically, “Fuck tha Police.”

1218
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:23,395
it's a great song.
It's a great moment in the film.

1219
01:15:23,478 --> 01:15:28,316
But the song is a response
to excessive force,

1220
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,652
and it was necessary,

1221
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:33,363
and that's the end of it.

1222
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:36,950
There should be a change in law enforcement
in terms of the culture.

1223
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,327
On the ﬂip side to that,

1224
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:43,289
we're not advocating violence against police.

1225
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:48,169
Because at the end of the day, we need
law enforcement to protect us as well.

1226
01:15:48,837 --> 01:15:54,467
So we fight against anyone
who feels like it's okay

1227
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:59,806
to violate or hurt
innocent citizens of this country.

1228
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,182
Peﬂod.

1229
01:16:01,266 --> 01:16:04,644
It doesn't matter if you're from the hood
or if you're in law enforcement.

1230
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:07,397
We want to be clear about that.

1231
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:15,029
I love this shot right here.

1232
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,866
And I love this shot right here.

1233
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:21,453
Big shout-out to my camera operator
Colin Hudson.

1234
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:25,165
He was so great at doing what he does.

1235
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:29,627
He's a drummer,
and I liken all art to music,

1236
01:16:29,711 --> 01:16:35,133
or at least I think that all art
is somehow connected to rhythm.

1237
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:39,679
When you have a camera operator
that's a drummer, they just get it.

1238
01:16:39,763 --> 01:16:42,015
It's all rhythm and timing.

1239
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:45,310
And he just did an amazing job.

1240
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:47,687
He, along with Matty Libatique.

1241
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:50,190
You couldn't get any better camera operator.

1242
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:54,444
They knew where to be,
what shot to create in the moment

1243
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,529
because I did a lot of handheld shots.

1244
01:16:56,613 --> 01:17:00,658
And they knew exactly
how to capture the moment

1245
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:03,620
and where to be
and the rhythm of the scene.

1246
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:08,082
I love those guys.
They are A1, top, top-notch.

1247
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:16,341
Now the riot, we shot this in Los Angeles
at the LA Sports Arena,

1248
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:18,760
my old stomping grounds when I was a kid.

1249
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:24,015
And a lot of people showed up
from a radio contest.

1250
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:27,435
A lot of those extras are extras
that showed up in a radio contest

1251
01:17:27,519 --> 01:17:29,646
and they were really fully into it.

1252
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:33,942
I love this moment too. These guys get
arrested and thrown in a paddy wagon,

1253
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:36,069
and they laugh their way through it.

1254
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:39,155
Which, in a strange way,
although they're being arrested,

1255
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:41,407
they're still celebrating like it was a win.

1256
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:45,203
It's like, “You know what?
We defied the cops. We don't give a shit.

1257
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:49,040
We won because we didn't let them
tell us what to do.”

1258
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:51,292
it was just a fun moment for them.

1259
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:53,962
It was a fun moment in the movie as well.

1260
01:17:56,673 --> 01:18:00,343
I want the audience
to really get a sense of the “Why?”

1261
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:03,638
Meaning, why would these young guys
write these lyrics?

1262
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,431
Why would they do these songs?

1263
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:09,936
You hear about a lot of negativity
on the surface, but why would you do it?

1264
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:13,398
We touch a little bit on that in this scene.

1265
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:22,365
When you grow up in an environment
that changes so drastically

1266
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:27,120
when there's this inﬂux of not only cocaine-
crack cocaine-

1267
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:31,875
but military weapons,
it changes the whole environment.

1268
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,255
And the whole gangster lifestyle

1269
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:41,885
is fueled not only by the lack of education,

1270
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:46,347
but the inﬂux of drugs and weapons.

1271
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:49,475
This is what these guys wrote about.

1272
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:53,938
Now, in no stretch of imagination am I
suggesting they were freedom fighters

1273
01:18:54,022 --> 01:18:57,901
or that they live on the level
of Martin Luther King.

1274
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:03,281
But I will say that they just wrote
about what they saw,

1275
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:04,991
what they experienced.

1276
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:09,537
In the last scene,
they talked about the fact that,

1277
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:12,916
“Hey, we don't have passports,

1278
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:18,254
but we have access
to Russian machine guns.

1279
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:20,423
We don't have passports,

1280
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:25,887
but we have metric tons of cocaine

1281
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,306
being shipped into our neighborhoods.

1282
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:32,185
Now who's doing that,
and why?”

1283
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:36,606
So when you start to judge the music,

1284
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:41,235
dig a little deeper and figure out
why the environment's like that.

1285
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:44,238
Because they wouldn't write about it
if it wasn't like that.

1286
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:45,907
But dig a little deeper.

1287
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:52,372
In the last scene, they mention
that this is just a reﬂection of our reality.

1288
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:55,166
You don't necessarily
have to love the music,

1289
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:58,002
you don't even necessarily
have to agree with it,

1290
01:19:58,086 --> 01:20:01,714
but you have to, at the very least,
examine it.

1291
01:20:01,798 --> 01:20:04,217
I like that last scene
because it touches on something

1292
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,552
a little deeper than just music.

1293
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:14,143
On a side note,

1294
01:20:14,227 --> 01:20:18,940
remember that velour sweat suit
that Jerry wore in the first scene?

1295
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,151
This is where he gets a little ﬂy.

1296
01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:25,989
This reminds me of Al Pacino in Scarf ace.

1297
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:28,324
He's got the ﬂy hairstyle,

1298
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:32,620
he's got the Don Johnson, <i>Miami</i> Vice
sports coat on,

1299
01:20:32,704 --> 01:20:35,206
and so you can tell
he's making a little money

1300
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:37,709
and getting a little ﬂy.

1301
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:39,877
Cube notices that too.

1302
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:42,547
But the heart of this scene is really about

1303
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:47,260
the fact that he does not understand
these contracts,

1304
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,262
and he needs to take it to someone else,

1305
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:52,598
and he feels like something's
really fishy here.

1306
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:57,937
I gotta say, when I was that age,
I wouldn't have challenged that.

1307
01:20:58,021 --> 01:21:02,650
If someone held up a check for $75,000
and told me to sign it-

1308
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:06,487
Probably if they held up that check today,
I'd probably sign it.

1309
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:11,117
But definitely as a teenager,
I would have just signed it and went with it.

1310
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,954
But Cube was smart enough
to say, “Listen.

1311
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:19,625
If I can't get this examined,
I do not want to sign it.”

1312
01:21:19,709 --> 01:21:25,423
That should inspire people
to just do their due diligence

1313
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:27,675
and really serve good business.

1314
01:21:40,313 --> 01:21:43,941
That's a pickup shot with the bus
that's filled with beer smells.

1315
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,736
We did that later.

1316
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:51,365
This is Suge Knight and Big Dave.

1317
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,951
Big Dave's actually a real guy.

1318
01:21:54,035 --> 01:21:56,412
We gave him a couple lines in the movie

1319
01:21:56,496 --> 01:21:59,207
because, again,
he just really is an authentic dude.

1320
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:01,375
Really from the streets of Compton.

1321
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:05,630
This scene is really-
it represents the beginning of the end.

1322
01:22:05,713 --> 01:22:09,425
You see how the group was together
for the first half of the movie,

1323
01:22:09,509 --> 01:22:14,055
and now, even visually,
you start to see the group splinter.

1324
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:16,849
D.O.C goes his own way,

1325
01:22:16,933 --> 01:22:20,478
Eazy goes his own way with Jerry,

1326
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:23,564
and as you'll see coming up,

1327
01:22:23,648 --> 01:22:25,650
even Cube goes his own separate way.

1328
01:22:25,733 --> 01:22:30,905
So it seems like what was
a group of brothers-

1329
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:35,493
After the tour, after the drama,

1330
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:39,622
after the losses and the pain
and the contracts,

1331
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:41,415
the group starts to splinter.

1332
01:22:41,499 --> 01:22:47,004
I wanted to show that
not only intellectually.

1333
01:22:47,088 --> 01:22:49,215
I wanted you to see it visually.

1334
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:51,884
Everybody goes their own separate way.

1335
01:22:51,968 --> 01:22:54,512
And it's never the same after this moment.

1336
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,141
We shot this in Leimert Park.

1337
01:22:58,224 --> 01:23:00,643
I went to elementary school in this area.

1338
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,728
So it's a special place,

1339
01:23:02,812 --> 01:23:07,567
'cause I love bringing production
back to places where I grew up.

1340
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:11,571
I moved around quite a bit,
but this is a special place for me.

1341
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:13,906
This is South Central LA,
Leimert Park.

1342
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:15,366
It's a block away from Crenshaw,

1343
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:19,370
and I love this place.

1344
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:22,582
- Take care of yourself, Dre.
- Peace.

1345
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:28,171
This digs into the relationships with women.

1346
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:31,132
More specifically, Dre and his mom.

1347
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:33,718
You show that he really loves his mom.

1348
01:23:33,801 --> 01:23:38,639
Regardless of what happened earlier,
he wants to be there to support her,

1349
01:23:38,723 --> 01:23:42,768
especially after the loss of
his little brother and her son.

1350
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,730
That wasn't in the theatrical release,

1351
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:47,607
but it was something that was
important to me.

1352
01:23:47,815 --> 01:23:53,112
We now introduce
Ice Cube's wife, Kim.

1353
01:23:53,196 --> 01:23:55,114
She's Kim Jackson now, of course.

1354
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:57,992
She's played by Alexandra Shipp,

1355
01:23:58,075 --> 01:24:01,120
and she did a really good job.

1356
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:06,542
I actually think that Shea
was pretty fond of her.

1357
01:24:07,335 --> 01:24:08,836
You can understand that.

1358
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,839
But he was a little distracted sometimes.

1359
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:14,634
But he did a good job in this scene.

1360
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:21,891
He strikes a deal with Bryan Turner
and goes on to make what I consider

1361
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:26,646
<i>one of the best</i> hip-hop <i>albums of all time-
Amer/KKKate Most Wanted.</i>

1362
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:31,984
That album was absolutely crazy.
llovedit

1363
01:24:32,068 --> 01:24:37,323
To this day, it's still one of the top
hip-hop albums, period.

1364
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:45,748
He went to New York and worked
with The Bomb Squad and Chuck D.

1365
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:48,376
We showed Chuck D a little more.

1366
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:51,170
You see the guy with the P hat?
That's Chuck D.

1367
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:54,632
You see some of his inﬂuences in this scene

1368
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:58,636
and how he went from West Coast
and Dr. Dre,

1369
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:02,765
went straight to the East Coast

1370
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:09,897
and had The Bomb Squad
do this crazy, different approach to music

1371
01:25:09,981 --> 01:25:14,110
with a West Coast lyricist
but with an East Coast ﬂavor.

1372
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:16,779
I think that's part of the reason why-

1373
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:20,783
When you bring the two together,
history is made.

1374
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:23,452
I love West Coast music,
and I love East Coast music,

1375
01:25:23,536 --> 01:25:25,246
but when you bring them together, it's crazy.

1376
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,665
That album really represented that.

1377
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:30,793
As you can tell, Dre even loved the album,

1378
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:34,797
even though Cube is not
a part of N.W.A. anymore.

1379
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,675
And by the way, that car is worth $110,000,

1380
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:40,678
'cause there's not a screw
that wasn't touched on it,

1381
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:43,931
and it's a beautiful car.

1382
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:48,352
Now here we are at the Eazy-E
“Wet and Wild” party.

1383
01:25:48,436 --> 01:25:54,275
This is where they had
the most notorious parties

1384
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:56,944
that LA has probably ever seen.

1385
01:25:57,737 --> 01:26:02,324
I love this moment because you see
that everybody is having fun,

1386
01:26:02,408 --> 01:26:04,326
but they're all separate.

1387
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:07,830
You have Yella and Ren over here.

1388
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:11,667
You have Dre over with the women by himself.

1389
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:15,546
Then you see Eazy with Jerry.

1390
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:17,882
So something that's different about this

1391
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:21,927
is ordinarily when they're having fun,
they're together.

1392
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:24,638
But once Cube left the group,

1393
01:26:24,722 --> 01:26:28,893
you start to feel this disconnect
with the guys.

1394
01:26:28,976 --> 01:26:34,190
While on the surface
it feels like they're having a good time,

1395
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:36,400
you start to see that the group is splintering.

1396
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:40,321
I wanted to do that visually
to give you a sense

1397
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:43,115
that while it seems
okay on the surface,

1398
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:47,078
things aren't really
as good as they may seem.

1399
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:48,746
Let's sit down for two seconds.

1400
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:51,707
- Look, we need to keep Dre happy.
- Yeah.

1401
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:55,628
In this scene- besides the fact that
Eazy really wants to participate in the party-

1402
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:59,757
he sees that Dre may be
the next one to go.

1403
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,473
Jerry really wants him to focus on business.

1404
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:11,227
Eazy wants to focus on pussy

1405
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:15,231
and making sure his group
doesn't fall apart.

1406
01:27:15,314 --> 01:27:16,899
You see where his priorities are.

1407
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:20,444
It's kind of interesting,
at least in the movie.

1408
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:27,910
The serious part
about this scene is that

1409
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:34,208
this is where Suge
starts to poach Dr. Dre.

1410
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:38,838
You can see the concern on Jerry's face,

1411
01:27:39,839 --> 01:27:45,469
and the fact that he started
with D.O.C. and was successful.

1412
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:50,015
He's not really sure,
but he looks like he's starting on Dr. Dre.

1413
01:27:50,099 --> 01:27:51,475
You see that look?

1414
01:27:51,559 --> 01:27:55,229
You also quickly see D.O.C.

1415
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:59,483
give that kind of same
suspicious look right there.

1416
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:04,029
Dre tells me all these stories
about what was going on.

1417
01:28:04,113 --> 01:28:08,534
He said that's what would happen,
and it's pretty crazy.

1418
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:12,997
This is a really cool moment,

1419
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:16,333
because I remember
when this actually happened.

1420
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:19,420
I got a phone call from a friend saying,

1421
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:24,675
“Cube just went nuts
and tore up Priority Records.”

1422
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:29,054
And this is the moment that
sets up that moment where he's saying,

1423
01:28:29,138 --> 01:28:32,266
“Listen. I've been through this once before,

1424
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:34,727
and I'm not going through this shit again.”

1425
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:38,898
I remember Priority Records
was on Sunset Boulevard.

1426
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:43,736
The fact that Cube
didn't get arrested

1427
01:28:43,986 --> 01:28:46,322
for tearing up

1428
01:28:47,865 --> 01:28:51,327
an office in Hollywood

1429
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:55,623
with a bunch of his goons
and baseball bats

1430
01:28:55,706 --> 01:28:57,291
is so amazing to me,

1431
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:00,753
especially with their relationship
with the police.

1432
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:04,506
He could have- He could still be in jail
right now for what he did.

1433
01:29:06,926 --> 01:29:09,720
But you see, in this particular cut,

1434
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:14,183
he looks at all of the platinum albums
and the gold albums.

1435
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:19,605
And enough is enough.

1436
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:28,364
We know what's about to happen right now.
You see the baseball bat.

1437
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:32,243
People actually ask me,
“Did that really happen?”

1438
01:29:32,326 --> 01:29:35,412
'Cause it seems like a dramatic moment
that a director would put in a movie

1439
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:37,122
but it really didn't happen.

1440
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:40,918
And it really did happen.

1441
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:44,004
Cube ripped this office apart.

1442
01:29:48,342 --> 01:29:52,763
I wouldn't suggest anyone do this now,
but it actually worked.

1443
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,848
He got his check.

1444
01:29:58,269 --> 01:30:00,271
It probably wouldn't work today,

1445
01:30:00,354 --> 01:30:02,606
but it worked back in the day.

1446
01:30:10,948 --> 01:30:13,242
If you look at this one shot,

1447
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:16,036
you see, just to the left, the ice cube-

1448
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:19,123
where we go from
the last smashing of the table,

1449
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:24,044
and we rack focus to the ice cube
on Bryan Turner's desk,

1450
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:27,381
showing Ice Cube has been here.

1451
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:29,466
He came, he saw and he conquered.

1452
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:36,682
Now we set up that the group
was splintering at the party.

1453
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:43,314
Now all of the fun that we set up
in the earlier recording sessions-

1454
01:30:43,397 --> 01:30:45,607
when they were recording
Straight' <i>Outta</i> Compton-

1455
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:47,109
now it's just not the same.

1456
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:49,403
You see everybody is sitting around,

1457
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:53,449
the energy's low, no one's having any fun,

1458
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:57,411
everyone seems somewhat either distracted-

1459
01:30:57,494 --> 01:31:00,372
it just doesn't seem like the brotherhood

1460
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:03,542
is the same as it was before,
now that Cube left.

1461
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:09,340
I think that's one of the reasons
why it's so important to establish

1462
01:31:09,423 --> 01:31:13,177
how much fun it was
when they were a group.

1463
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,346
Now it just feels like work.

1464
01:31:15,429 --> 01:31:17,556
Even the happiest guy in the group-

1465
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:21,935
DJ Yella's kind of sitting back going,
“This is not fun at all.”

1466
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:31,236
This is also a moment that happened
where Dre gets a call

1467
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:35,074
about D.O.C. being in a car accident.

1468
01:31:35,157 --> 01:31:38,494
This was a big story back in the day
when we all heard

1469
01:31:38,577 --> 01:31:42,206
that one of the best West Coast MCs-

1470
01:31:42,289 --> 01:31:46,210
although he was from Houston,
he was still considered part of the west-

1471
01:31:46,293 --> 01:31:49,254
lost his ability to speak,

1472
01:31:49,338 --> 01:31:52,549
or, at the very least, his ability to rap.

1473
01:31:52,633 --> 01:31:56,970
That was tragic because he was so good.
He had so much potential.

1474
01:31:57,054 --> 01:31:58,972
Where your people?
Where Eazy and Jerry?

1475
01:31:59,056 --> 01:32:01,392
How the fuck should I know?

1476
01:32:01,475 --> 01:32:03,560
And of course,

1477
01:32:03,644 --> 01:32:08,649
this is where Suge,
kind of rightfully so, says,

1478
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:11,735
“Listen, man. This could be you.

1479
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:16,907
Something's going on with your business,

1480
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:19,284
and I want to help you with this.”

1481
01:32:19,368 --> 01:32:21,453
As Dre telIs it,

1482
01:32:22,955 --> 01:32:27,126
this is kind of where
they start to kind of investigate

1483
01:32:27,209 --> 01:32:30,212
what their agreements were with Ruthless.

1484
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:34,591
You could see right here,
Corey Hawkins is doing such a good job

1485
01:32:34,675 --> 01:32:39,721
at splitting his attention
between his friend, who's injured,

1486
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:41,515
and the business at hand.

1487
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:46,353
The seeds of doubt have been planted.

1488
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:54,653
Right now, Suge's getting a foothold
into the Ruthless camp.

1489
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:02,953
This is a moment that did not
make it into the theatrical release.

1490
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:07,875
I hated that it didn't,
because I wanted to show

1491
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:14,256
that Tomica Woods-Wright,
who is Eazy's widow-

1492
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:18,594
really had a relationship with him
beyond the average groupie.

1493
01:33:18,677 --> 01:33:20,971
This scene kind of defines that.

1494
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,933
She's played by Carra Patterson,
who's from New York,

1495
01:33:25,017 --> 01:33:26,894
who did such a great job.

1496
01:33:26,977 --> 01:33:29,521
But it shows Eazy's vulnerable side.

1497
01:33:29,605 --> 01:33:32,816
It shows that in the midst of partying
with all these groupies

1498
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:35,152
and doing all this stuff on tour,

1499
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:37,487
that he's a little vulnerable with her.

1500
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:41,825
You could see in his eyes,
and see that this girl's a little different.

1501
01:33:42,868 --> 01:33:45,704
She works in the record industry.

1502
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:48,957
She's an executive assistant.

1503
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:51,501
So she has a little bit of something
going for her.

1504
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:57,174
You could feel a different connection
between the two.

1505
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:05,599
Now his office has been
completely remodeled

1506
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:09,728
because of the damage
that Ice Cube inflicted.

1507
01:34:12,272 --> 01:34:13,565
And again, to this day,

1508
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:16,401
I don't understand
how he didn't get into any trouble.

1509
01:34:16,485 --> 01:34:20,530
But he stood up for what he thought
was right, and he got his money.

1510
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:24,952
Now the plot thickens.

1511
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:29,831
I remember when this song came out
and was thinking,

1512
01:34:29,915 --> 01:34:31,708
“Whoa. That was pretty harsh.”

1513
01:34:34,544 --> 01:34:36,213
“Benedict Arnold.”

1514
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,382
That was pretty harsh.

1515
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:41,385
But there's nothing more harsh

1516
01:34:42,052 --> 01:34:46,932
than what I consider
one of the best dis tracks

1517
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:49,309
in the history of all of music.

1518
01:34:49,393 --> 01:34:52,896
Not just hip-hop, but all of music.

1519
01:34:53,397 --> 01:34:58,819
“No Vaseline” has to be
one of the most passionate,

1520
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:02,322
venomous dis tracks

1521
01:35:02,406 --> 01:35:05,409
to ever be recorded to this day.

1522
01:35:05,492 --> 01:35:07,661
It wasn't in the original script.

1523
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:10,998
But I called Cube up one day
and said, “Listen.

1524
01:35:11,081 --> 01:35:14,501
You cannot make an N.W.A movie

1525
01:35:14,584 --> 01:35:18,005
without putting 'No Vaseline' in the movie.”

1526
01:35:18,088 --> 01:35:20,549
You just can't do it.
It's not possible.

1527
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:26,054
It's such a popular song
that never had a music video.

1528
01:35:26,138 --> 01:35:27,973
So in a strange way,

1529
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:31,226
<i>obviously it serves the narrative
for Straight Outta Compton.</i>

1530
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:36,565
But it's also, in a strange way,
the music video for “No Vaseline.”

1531
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:42,237
I've never had a response
from a sequence like this

1532
01:35:42,321 --> 01:35:44,239
in the history of my career.

1533
01:35:44,323 --> 01:35:47,617
We dropped a Brink's truck
in the <i>Italian Job.</i>

1534
01:35:48,452 --> 01:35:52,122
<i>We blew people</i> up <i>in LawAb/d/ng Cit/zen.</i>

1535
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:54,708
I've had some pretty good moments
in cinema history,

1536
01:35:54,791 --> 01:36:01,131
but people damn near stood up
and cheered after listening to this song

1537
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:06,511
and experiencing the reaction
of the guys in the group.

1538
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:10,140
It's Ice Cube at his best.

1539
01:36:14,728 --> 01:36:19,775
The young lady right here, Maria Sten,

1540
01:36:19,858 --> 01:36:23,779
is Miss Denmark 2007.

1541
01:36:23,862 --> 01:36:27,366
Very beautiful woman.
Very, very cool. A good actor as well.

1542
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:34,373
Cube said that he was heavily inﬂuenced
by Richard Pryor and Muhammad Ali.

1543
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:36,917
When you listen to “No Vaseline,”

1544
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,880
you could really hear the inﬂuences,

1545
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:43,840
especially Muhammad Ali-

1546
01:36:43,924 --> 01:36:48,553
the rhyming, the humor, the venom.

1547
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:52,140
He just torpedoed the group.

1548
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:55,727
I really don't think the group
was the same after that.

1549
01:37:01,942 --> 01:37:03,568
That shit's kind of funny.

1550
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:05,445
Neil Brown, Jr. is so funny.

1551
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:08,782
Just comic relief when you need it,

1552
01:37:08,865 --> 01:37:11,118
especially with something so harsh

1553
01:37:11,201 --> 01:37:14,079
with the lyrics
and how they responded to the song.

1554
01:37:14,162 --> 01:37:17,624
His comedic timing is just perfect.

1555
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:20,877
Who the fuck does he think he is?
Un-fucking-believable.

1556
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:23,672
That kind of fucking bullshit.
Jew-bashing bullshit.

1557
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:26,341
MC Ren is incensed.

1558
01:37:26,425 --> 01:37:30,679
Paul Giamatti, who plays Jerry Heller,
is super pissed off.

1559
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:32,597
Eazy-E

1560
01:37:34,224 --> 01:37:39,146
is really starting to see
his team fall apart.

1561
01:37:39,229 --> 01:37:40,814
And you can feel that.

1562
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:46,069
I don't think Cube planned
for it to have that type of effect,

1563
01:37:46,153 --> 01:37:49,197
but after talking to the group,

1564
01:37:49,281 --> 01:37:52,993
they really said
nothing was the same after that.

1565
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:56,997
They acknowledged that
Cube won that battle,

1566
01:37:57,080 --> 01:38:00,083
and he clearly did.

1567
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,878
And hip-hop-

1568
01:38:02,961 --> 01:38:05,589
You hear these battles
going back and forth and stuff like that,

1569
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:07,716
but it's not the way it used to be.

1570
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:10,469
These guys really went back and forth,
and it was crazy.

1571
01:38:10,552 --> 01:38:14,890
Cube clearly got the upper hand,
especially with this song.

1572
01:38:18,602 --> 01:38:20,353
If looks could kill-
look at that look.

1573
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:31,531
You got to love Jason.
He's just so on point.

1574
01:38:31,615 --> 01:38:34,159
That felt like a real moment.
Like a really real moment.

1575
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:37,370
He didn't seem like he was acting.
He really looked like he was pissed off.

1576
01:38:37,454 --> 01:38:38,997
I guess that's the goal.

1577
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:43,793
But he just really sank
into this particular character.

1578
01:38:45,462 --> 01:38:47,923
Again, people ask me,
did this really happen?

1579
01:38:48,006 --> 01:38:51,134
There was a New Music Seminar

1580
01:38:51,218 --> 01:38:55,138
where there was a group called
Above the Law,

1581
01:38:55,222 --> 01:38:59,392
and they got into a brawl
with Cube and Da Lench Mob.

1582
01:39:00,685 --> 01:39:04,272
This is what happened.
This kind of goes beyond hip-hop.

1583
01:39:04,356 --> 01:39:07,067
You should keep it on wax
when you have these beefs,

1584
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:11,238
but it got so crazy that it became physical.

1585
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:16,493
Of course, this is the infamous
Rodney King beating.

1586
01:39:16,576 --> 01:39:22,457
And it's juxtaposed to what you would
consider black-on-black crime.

1587
01:39:22,541 --> 01:39:25,126
You have black guys
beating up black guys.

1588
01:39:25,210 --> 01:39:27,462
Now you have white guys
beating up black guys.

1589
01:39:27,546 --> 01:39:32,300
It's just a weird feeling to see
all of this violence.

1590
01:39:34,386 --> 01:39:37,973
I was hoping that people would
watch this moment and say,

1591
01:39:38,932 --> 01:39:41,184
“You know what? This is all silly.”

1592
01:39:41,268 --> 01:39:46,856
it's kind of ridiculous
to actually war with each other,

1593
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:52,153
when clearly, people are warring with us.

1594
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:05,792
And now we're in the studio yet again,
and it's not fun at all.

1595
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:10,755
All <i>those fun moments</i> when <i>they
were recording Straight Outta Compton,</i>

1596
01:40:10,839 --> 01:40:15,427
all the montages where the guys were having
a great time, laughing and smiling-

1597
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:16,845
none of that.

1598
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:22,183
I think that really affected Dre's creativity.

1599
01:40:22,267 --> 01:40:25,270
He was creating under duress.

1600
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:29,065
One of the surprise moments
was this moment

1601
01:40:29,149 --> 01:40:33,028
by an ex-NFL football player,

1602
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:36,364
who went to the Super Bowl
and the Pro Bowl-

1603
01:40:36,448 --> 01:40:38,366
Thomas Jones,

1604
01:40:38,450 --> 01:40:43,913
who really is a superb athlete.

1605
01:40:45,123 --> 01:40:48,043
But he comes off as one of
the hardest thugs

1606
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:51,379
and scariest thugs you've ever seen on film.

1607
01:40:51,463 --> 01:40:53,506
When he says, “Is this your house?”

1608
01:40:54,716 --> 01:40:56,676
I don't think any man alive
wouldn't think twice

1609
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,303
about answering that question.

1610
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:00,430
That look left and right

1611
01:41:00,513 --> 01:41:04,517
was one of the most
awkward moments in the movie.

1612
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:07,771
Because you don't know if
this guy is going to shoot Jerry,

1613
01:41:07,854 --> 01:41:11,149
stab him or skin him alive and scalp him.

1614
01:41:12,275 --> 01:41:17,781
He's so comfortable in this
passive-aggressive threat,

1615
01:41:17,864 --> 01:41:23,536
that it just sends shivers
down the spine of the audience.

1616
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:25,705
I love this moment.

1617
01:41:25,789 --> 01:41:28,124
And he just walks away
like nothing happened.

1618
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:42,931
This scene here is one of the more
pivotal moments in the movie.

1619
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:47,268
We obviously experience
Ice Cube leaving the group.

1620
01:41:47,352 --> 01:41:49,687
But this is a moment

1621
01:41:49,771 --> 01:41:54,150
that's really, really emotional
for Dr. Dre in real life.

1622
01:41:54,234 --> 01:41:57,153
He told me that-

1623
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:02,450
He told me that-

1624
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:09,207
He assumed when he brought
the contracts to Eazy,

1625
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:11,876
that it was a foregone conclusion

1626
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:16,214
that he was going to say, “Okay,
I see that things don't seem right

1627
01:42:16,297 --> 01:42:18,508
or, you know, it doesn't add up.

1628
01:42:18,591 --> 01:42:21,678
So, I'm going to rock with my boy,
and we're good.

1629
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:24,889
We're just going to find
a new path to business.”

1630
01:42:24,973 --> 01:42:30,895
When Eazy decided to actually
go with Jerry versus Dre-

1631
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:33,898
I remember having
my first meeting with him.

1632
01:42:33,982 --> 01:42:37,068
He paused because I think
he still felt a certain way about it.

1633
01:42:37,152 --> 01:42:41,948
It was very painful for him, because
he had such a great relationship-

1634
01:42:42,031 --> 01:42:44,451
or so he thought- with Eazy.

1635
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:47,245
Eazy's not here to speak for himself.

1636
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:50,081
I'm assuming that it was just a mistake.

1637
01:42:50,165 --> 01:42:53,751
But this is something
that Dre took to heart.

1638
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:56,588
He was very surprised.
He was taken aback.

1639
01:42:57,922 --> 01:43:00,383
It was very, very painful for him.

1640
01:43:00,467 --> 01:43:04,429
I think this is one of Corey's
strongest moments as well.

1641
01:43:08,016 --> 01:43:11,227
This is a really interesting moment,

1642
01:43:11,311 --> 01:43:14,022
because Eazy can't even
look him in the eye.

1643
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:15,857
He just can't.

1644
01:43:18,693 --> 01:43:21,571
When you have a movie that deals
with this genre of music,

1645
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:28,036
again, you just don't associate emotion,
this level of emotion or vulnerability

1646
01:43:28,119 --> 01:43:31,831
with this genre of music.

1647
01:43:31,915 --> 01:43:34,876
I think that's part of what
makes these guys special.

1648
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:38,630
Because they're true leading men.
Their performances are top-notch.

1649
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:42,217
Because they're not only capable
of giving you

1650
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:45,887
that masculine, macho,
street-guy thing,

1651
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:49,474
but they're also capable
of being vulnerable.

1652
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:52,894
Which is a great balance.
This is a great, balanced performance.

1653
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:56,648
I always said-
Not to compare them to these guys,

1654
01:43:56,731 --> 01:43:58,983
but if you look at a Humphrey Bogart

1655
01:43:59,067 --> 01:44:03,696
or if you look at a Marlon Brando-

1656
01:44:04,697 --> 01:44:06,407
<i>You look at A Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

1657
01:44:06,491 --> 01:44:10,411
These guys really, really were tough guys.

1658
01:44:10,495 --> 01:44:14,749
<i>Or Casablanca
or anything that Bogart did.</i>

1659
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:19,712
They give you this tough-guy image,
but they're also able to be vulnerable.

1660
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:23,174
That's what makes a classic performance.

1661
01:44:23,258 --> 01:44:26,261
I think these guys really delivered that,

1662
01:44:26,844 --> 01:44:32,892
especially Dre and by Eazy.

1663
01:44:43,111 --> 01:44:45,196
This is the turning point for Dre.

1664
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:48,199
He's now in bed with Suge Knight.

1665
01:44:48,283 --> 01:44:50,535
They started the company Death Row.

1666
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:55,790
“Deep Cover,” which is a crazy track.
I love this song.

1667
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:59,711
Dre's feeling like, “Hey, listen.
I can make good music,

1668
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:01,796
but I'm still under contract.”

1669
01:45:04,007 --> 01:45:07,719
Marcos is very, very comfortable
in playing this role.

1670
01:45:07,802 --> 01:45:09,345
You can tell.

1671
01:45:09,429 --> 01:45:12,390
This is actually a moment
that really was kind of funny.

1672
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:15,602
If you know anything
about the streets of Los Angeles,

1673
01:45:15,685 --> 01:45:19,439
there's a Crip and Blood dynamic
that's very, very interesting.

1674
01:45:19,522 --> 01:45:21,065
It's actually very dangerous.

1675
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:24,569
And so Keith Stanfield,
who plays Snoop,

1676
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:27,947
walks into this room filled with Bloods
and he's a Crip.

1677
01:45:28,031 --> 01:45:32,243
This guy is probably 110 pounds soaking wet.

1678
01:45:32,327 --> 01:45:37,749
He walks into this room with these goons
that are 300 pounds apiece-

1679
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:40,251
all muscle, all murder.

1680
01:45:40,335 --> 01:45:44,505
He doesn't give a fuck about
what they think about where he's from.

1681
01:45:44,589 --> 01:45:47,008
He's like, “I'm from Long Beach.”

1682
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:50,928
He's got a blue rag in his back pocket
in a red room

1683
01:45:51,012 --> 01:45:53,139
with a room full of Bloods.

1684
01:45:53,222 --> 01:45:56,059
He just doesn't give a shit.
Look how he moves his hand.

1685
01:45:56,142 --> 01:45:57,935
He's like, “I'll just listen to the music.”

1686
01:45:58,019 --> 01:46:00,938
This guy can get his neck
broken at any moment.

1687
01:46:01,022 --> 01:46:05,360
He just doesn't care.
It's kind of how Snoop was, you know.

1688
01:46:05,443 --> 01:46:07,487
He was a thin guy,
but he had a lot of heart.

1689
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:11,115
We captured that moment, I think.
Keith was great.

1690
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:13,951
He sounds like Snoop.
He doesn't look like Snoop as much,

1691
01:46:14,035 --> 01:46:18,289
but he definitely captured Snoop's
essence and kind of looked like him.

1692
01:46:18,373 --> 01:46:23,795
It's a funny moment. if you look at that stare
that Suge gave him- it's fucking crazy.

1693
01:46:23,878 --> 01:46:27,131
He looked like he could kill
Snoop and Dre in that moment.

1694
01:46:31,678 --> 01:46:33,721
And back to Rodney King.

1695
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:37,725
I wanted to show this common-

1696
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:42,188
this thread that was
going through the stories.

1697
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:45,650
Just the thread of law enforcement

1698
01:46:45,733 --> 01:46:48,986
but also the hints of black-on-black crime.

1699
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:52,573
These things are running parallel
in the movie.

1700
01:46:52,657 --> 01:46:54,409
It's pretty sad.

1701
01:46:54,909 --> 01:46:57,537
Hopefully when the viewer
watches this movie,

1702
01:46:57,620 --> 01:47:04,168
they can get a sense of how idiotic
it is to be so destructive.

1703
01:47:04,252 --> 01:47:06,671
You see it on the tapes with Rodney King.

1704
01:47:06,754 --> 01:47:09,674
You see it with the scene
that's coming up next,

1705
01:47:09,757 --> 01:47:12,635
where there's this violence that happens.

1706
01:47:13,177 --> 01:47:18,141
I can't judge anyone else,
but I do feel like there are better ways

1707
01:47:18,224 --> 01:47:20,601
and better solutions to solve
some of the problems we deal with today.

1708
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:24,313
And better solutions to solve
some of the problems we deal with today.

1709
01:47:24,397 --> 01:47:27,859
You see the juxtaposition of
law enforcement and gangs,

1710
01:47:27,942 --> 01:47:31,404
and sometimes I don't see the difference.

1711
01:47:31,487 --> 01:47:34,657
Like, who's right and who's wrong?

1712
01:47:36,701 --> 01:47:38,035
You know?

1713
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:43,791
That's a Malinois dog,
and I hope I pronounced it right.

1714
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:46,627
He looks like a German shepherd,
but he's like a turbo German shepherd.

1715
01:47:46,711 --> 01:47:49,338
They're extremely dangerous.

1716
01:47:49,422 --> 01:47:53,676
My understanding is that
Suge used to have a dog

1717
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:58,222
that was from Holland or from Germany,
and he spoke German.

1718
01:47:58,306 --> 01:48:01,476
And the dog was extremely dangerous.

1719
01:48:01,559 --> 01:48:05,480
On command,
this dog would attack anyone.

1720
01:48:06,564 --> 01:48:09,442
I've met the trainer for this dog,

1721
01:48:09,525 --> 01:48:14,614
and he was so on point with these dogs.

1722
01:48:15,323 --> 01:48:17,575
You could give them
a German command,

1723
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:21,746
and they would destroy
anything in front of them.

1724
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:24,373
Then they would just chill out.

1725
01:48:24,457 --> 01:48:29,253
I was told stories about this dog,
and he was kind of infamous.

1726
01:48:29,337 --> 01:48:32,089
Because while you see
all these big guys in the room,

1727
01:48:32,173 --> 01:48:33,966
kind of not afraid of anything,

1728
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:35,760
they were afraid of that damn dog.

1729
01:48:45,102 --> 01:48:46,854
This is another great moment.

1730
01:48:46,938 --> 01:48:50,149
Although Eazy is being
jumped by these guys,

1731
01:48:50,233 --> 01:48:52,193
he still had heart, you know.

1732
01:48:52,276 --> 01:48:56,822
Eazy didn't strike me as a guy
who was fearful or would back down.

1733
01:48:56,906 --> 01:48:59,325
You experienced that moment
in the beginning of the movie

1734
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:02,578
when he was in the dope house
with the Crips in Compton.

1735
01:49:02,662 --> 01:49:05,206
He was like, “Hey, listen.
Do what you got to do.”

1736
01:49:05,289 --> 01:49:07,208
Even now, he doesn't give a shit.

1737
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:11,212
That was the lion heart of Eazy-E,
and I wanted to capture that.

1738
01:49:11,295 --> 01:49:16,634
I think Jason- A part of Jason's
personality is like that too.

1739
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:18,469
This guy is fearless.

1740
01:49:19,637 --> 01:49:21,681
You get a sense of that.
There's no acting there.

1741
01:49:21,764 --> 01:49:25,768
I think that was part of
Eazy's approach to life as well.

1742
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:27,812
The guy was fearless.

1743
01:49:28,813 --> 01:49:30,565
I think that's the reason why you get
such a great performance from Jason.

1744
01:49:30,773 --> 01:49:31,983
This guy is fearless.

1745
01:49:32,066 --> 01:49:35,069
You get a sense of that.
There's no acting there.

1746
01:49:35,152 --> 01:49:38,823
I think that was part of Eazy's
approach to life as well.

1747
01:49:38,906 --> 01:49:40,866
The guy was fearless.

1748
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:45,413
I think that's the reason why you get
such a great performance from Jason.

1749
01:49:45,496 --> 01:49:48,749
This is a moment that I think serves
the brotherhood theme as well.

1750
01:49:48,833 --> 01:49:53,713
And although this dynamic is not
necessarily brother and brother,

1751
01:49:53,796 --> 01:49:58,134
what I wanted to create
was more of a father-son dynamic.

1752
01:49:58,217 --> 01:50:01,012
Because based on my research,

1753
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:05,016
I think that Jerry had more of
a father-son relationship with him,

1754
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:08,102
and that's the reason why Eazy trusted him

1755
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:10,896
and that's the reason
why he confided in him

1756
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:15,109
and they had a deeper relationship
than just business.

1757
01:50:15,192 --> 01:50:17,403
And there was a lot of trust there.

1758
01:50:17,486 --> 01:50:23,451
When Eazy got into this issue,
he went to Jerry to confide in him

1759
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:27,496
and to let him know and warn him,
“Hey, listen, things are about to get thick,

1760
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:30,833
and I'm gonna do what you would
ordinarily do on the street

1761
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:32,626
because it has to happen.”

1762
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:35,796
And Jerry, being this father figure,

1763
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:39,216
basically says, “No, you're not gonna do that.
I care about you.

1764
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:42,845
You have to do this the right way
because it's a zero-sum game.

1765
01:50:42,928 --> 01:50:47,141
If you hit back it's gonna end, and it's not
necessarily end in your favor.”

1766
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:49,643
And what I like about that is

1767
01:50:49,727 --> 01:50:53,356
you really get a sense
of why Eazy would trust Jerry.

1768
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:58,778
Because- There's part of me that feels
like Jerry really did care about this guy.

1769
01:50:58,861 --> 01:51:01,697
Otherwise it probably,
at least in the storytelling,

1770
01:51:01,781 --> 01:51:04,450
would make Eazy look kind of crazy
to just go with a guy

1771
01:51:04,617 --> 01:51:06,660
would make Eazy look kind of crazy
to just go with a guy

1772
01:51:06,744 --> 01:51:08,537
who just comes off as untrustworthy.

1773
01:51:08,621 --> 01:51:10,956
I think they had a great relationship

1774
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,834
and a deeper relationship
than just business,

1775
01:51:13,918 --> 01:51:20,049
and that's the reason why things got
uncomfortable or twisted towards the end.

1776
01:51:26,347 --> 01:51:30,267
This shot did not make it
in the theatrical release because of time,

1777
01:51:30,351 --> 01:51:33,938
but I loved the moment.

1778
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:39,944
Because Eazy really has to figure out
his next move,

1779
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:45,366
and he confides in his woman, Tomica.

1780
01:51:45,449 --> 01:51:48,702
You know, he goes to Jerry first,
which he has this father-son relationship,

1781
01:51:48,786 --> 01:51:50,538
and then he goes to his woman.

1782
01:51:50,621 --> 01:51:55,042
And I wanted to have a little more with
all the relationships with the women.

1783
01:51:55,126 --> 01:51:57,294
I wanted to deepen the relationships.

1784
01:51:57,378 --> 01:52:01,507
And it's unfortunate that the cut was
so long that I had to cut these things out.

1785
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:06,053
But you can see how much
she cares about this guy

1786
01:52:06,137 --> 01:52:11,392
and the pain he's going through because
he can't hit back the way he wants.

1787
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:17,064
And there's something that feels
changed about him and different.

1788
01:52:17,815 --> 01:52:22,069
And Tomica Wright told me,
when this actually happened,

1789
01:52:22,153 --> 01:52:26,240
he came home and it seemed
like he was just never the same

1790
01:52:26,323 --> 01:52:28,576
after that evening.

1791
01:52:28,659 --> 01:52:33,914
And I think Jason did an amazing job and
restrained himself from going over the top,

1792
01:52:33,998 --> 01:52:35,875
but you could see it in his eyes.

1793
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,721
So then when we check in with Dr. Dre,

1794
01:52:48,804 --> 01:52:53,267
he, on the surface, looks cool,
especially to his friends and family,

1795
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:55,853
but he told me he was broke.

1796
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:59,523
He had maybe $20,000, $30,000
in the bank,

1797
01:52:59,607 --> 01:53:03,611
this huge house with absolutely
no furniture,

1798
01:53:03,694 --> 01:53:08,073
and he just didn't have
any real motivation.

1799
01:53:08,157 --> 01:53:11,619
He was distraught,
and that was pretty interesting

1800
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:14,622
because a lot of people felt like,
“You're Dr. Dre. You're doing well.”

1801
01:53:15,789 --> 01:53:20,419
This particular scene did not make it
into the theatrical release.

1802
01:53:20,503 --> 01:53:22,630
And it's kind of interesting

1803
01:53:22,713 --> 01:53:26,050
because everybody knows
about the chronic.

1804
01:53:26,133 --> 01:53:31,764
It's just a funny moment with Snoop
offering him the chronic,

1805
01:53:31,847 --> 01:53:35,976
and then he goes on and embarks
on the chronicjourney.

1806
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:38,103
I don't think that's really
what happened in real life.

1807
01:53:38,187 --> 01:53:39,813
It was someone else
who actually did that,

1808
01:53:39,897 --> 01:53:43,234
but we took a little dramatic license.

1809
01:53:43,317 --> 01:53:48,072
Because everyone knows
Snoop's relationship with marijuana,

1810
01:53:48,155 --> 01:53:53,536
and Dre really didn't smoke a ton
before that time.

1811
01:53:53,619 --> 01:53:56,080
And the rest is history.

1812
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:58,541
The Chronic is a classic album.

1813
01:54:02,002 --> 01:54:06,799
And that's the reason why things got
uncomfortable or twisted towards the end.

1814
01:54:08,133 --> 01:54:11,762
This is one of Dre's best songs,
“G Thang,”

1815
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:14,348
and it's one of my favorite moments
in the movie

1816
01:54:14,431 --> 01:54:19,770
because Keith Stanfield does such
a great job at playing Snoop.

1817
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:21,480
The track is incredible.

1818
01:54:21,564 --> 01:54:26,694
It's quintessential Dr. Dre,
California, LA life.

1819
01:54:26,777 --> 01:54:29,822
And it's also pretty funny
because you have this guy

1820
01:54:29,905 --> 01:54:33,492
making a classic
in a big, empty mansion.

1821
01:54:33,576 --> 01:54:38,289
And it really captures
exactly what was going on

1822
01:54:38,372 --> 01:54:41,083
with the drama and the creativity

1823
01:54:41,166 --> 01:54:45,087
and the rawness of The Chronic album.

1824
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:47,381
And it's just a lot of fun, man,

1825
01:54:47,464 --> 01:54:49,466
and I think Keith did a great job.

1826
01:54:49,550 --> 01:54:51,802
And Corey is really into it.

1827
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:54,888
Harvey Mason Jr.,
who actually set this up for us,

1828
01:54:54,972 --> 01:54:59,059
did a great job
at reverse engineering the song.

1829
01:54:59,143 --> 01:55:02,354
They're in this big
Tony Montana house.

1830
01:55:02,438 --> 01:55:04,189
It's just a fun moment.

1831
01:55:05,524 --> 01:55:07,943
Now you check in with Ice Cube,

1832
01:55:08,027 --> 01:55:11,905
who says that although
he experienced a lot of success

1833
01:55:11,989 --> 01:55:15,451
<i>with Amer/KKKate Most Wanted
and with Death Ce/T/'ficate,</i>

1834
01:55:15,534 --> 01:55:19,622
this is one of the most challenging
moments in his life.

1835
01:55:19,705 --> 01:55:25,336
<i>He got</i> a <i>lot of</i> ﬂack <i>for</i> a <i>lot of things</i>
he <i>said on Death Certificate.</i>

1836
01:55:25,419 --> 01:55:30,007
He had to defend himself,
and this is one of those moments.

1837
01:55:30,883 --> 01:55:35,012
Cube has always been
a pretty clever guy, really funny.

1838
01:55:35,095 --> 01:55:41,018
He told me that he was inspired
by Richard Pryor

1839
01:55:41,101 --> 01:55:43,646
and by Muhammed Ali.

1840
01:55:43,729 --> 01:55:46,357
And you can hear that in his lyrics.

1841
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:49,985
You can also kind of see
a little bit of that in this scene

1842
01:55:50,069 --> 01:55:52,988
where he challenges the reporter

1843
01:55:53,072 --> 01:55:56,158
and tells him about
his point of view on everything.

1844
01:55:56,241 --> 01:55:59,036
And it's not only kind of
a strong approach

1845
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:04,416
to illustrating and letting a person
know what your philosophy is,

1846
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,835
but it's also pretty damn funny.

1847
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:12,216
This is one of the biggest laughs
that we have in the movie,

1848
01:56:12,299 --> 01:56:17,971
and Shea Jr. is absolutely on point

1849
01:56:18,055 --> 01:56:20,182
when he delivers this last line-

1850
01:56:20,265 --> 01:56:23,102
“Eat a dick and get the fuck out of my house.”
This is something-

1851
01:56:24,395 --> 01:56:27,189
that Cube would have said
back in the day.

1852
01:56:27,272 --> 01:56:29,441
It's a really funny moment,

1853
01:56:29,525 --> 01:56:34,446
but it was also one of the more challenging
moments in Cube's career.

1854
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:37,533
I'm glad he let us put that out there

1855
01:56:38,951 --> 01:56:41,036
and kind of show
that it wasn't always easy.

1856
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:53,757
If you think Eazy-E had wild parties
with the “Wet and Wild” parties,

1857
01:56:53,841 --> 01:57:00,097
there was no party like a Dr. Dre
summertime party circa early '90s.

1858
01:57:00,723 --> 01:57:05,144
Trust me. I went to one,
and it was absolutely crazy.

1859
01:57:05,227 --> 01:57:07,563
This shot was one of my favorite shots

1860
01:57:07,646 --> 01:57:09,857
and we had to cut it out
of the theatrical movie,

1861
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:12,359
but it's kind of an homage
to Scorsese.

1862
01:57:12,443 --> 01:57:16,530
I loved it because it starts on
the second floor with the menage a trois

1863
01:57:16,613 --> 01:57:21,368
and we follow the weed and the joint
to the deejay,

1864
01:57:21,452 --> 01:57:24,371
and then we go down
to the first ﬂoor

1865
01:57:24,455 --> 01:57:27,499
and then down even farther
into the pool.

1866
01:57:27,583 --> 01:57:31,378
We pick up Nicole,
who is now Dre's wife,

1867
01:57:31,462 --> 01:57:33,881
but in the movie,
he's never met her before.

1868
01:57:33,964 --> 01:57:37,217
So we have to go through the water,

1869
01:57:37,301 --> 01:57:39,887
follow her- as you can see her
in the left frame-

1870
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:43,348
reveal Dre and, of course,
a little booty,

1871
01:57:43,432 --> 01:57:47,227
and then we see Dre see Nicole,

1872
01:57:47,311 --> 01:57:49,521
and he's awestruck.

1873
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:55,277
I gotta tell you, it took over 2O takes
just to get that one shot.

1874
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,988
It was one of the hardest shots
I'd ever, not only designed,

1875
01:57:58,071 --> 01:57:59,573
but ever had to execute.

1876
01:57:59,656 --> 01:58:03,535
Because between the girls
bumping the camera,

1877
01:58:03,619 --> 01:58:05,412
the beach ball hitting the camera,

1878
01:58:05,496 --> 01:58:07,623
my grips bumping the camera,

1879
01:58:07,706 --> 01:58:10,209
water getting on the camera,

1880
01:58:10,292 --> 01:58:14,254
I can't describe to you the level
of engineering it took

1881
01:58:14,338 --> 01:58:16,381
to actually get that one shot.

1882
01:58:16,465 --> 01:58:19,635
I got to say I was a little disappointed
we couldn't put it in the theatrical.

1883
01:58:19,718 --> 01:58:23,055
But I saved it for you guys,
so I hope you enjoyed it.

1884
01:58:23,138 --> 01:58:26,517
Because it took an entire day
to do that one shot.

1885
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:29,478
And there's nothing wrong
with having a few pretty women around,

1886
01:58:29,561 --> 01:58:33,690
so anybody who wants to complain
about that, e-mail me.

1887
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:40,739
This scene is an interesting scene

1888
01:58:40,823 --> 01:58:43,075
because, while it wasn't written
in the script,

1889
01:58:43,158 --> 01:58:47,412
I always wanted to show
a father-son relationship.

1890
01:58:47,496 --> 01:58:51,542
So you see Jerry
bringing Eazy sandwiches

1891
01:58:51,625 --> 01:58:54,002
and he's serving him food,

1892
01:58:54,086 --> 01:58:58,131
and he's always
somewhat nurturing Eazy.

1893
01:58:58,215 --> 01:59:01,802
And so, again, just psychologically,

1894
01:59:01,885 --> 01:59:06,473
you get a sense that he has a different
relationship with Jerry

1895
01:59:06,557 --> 01:59:08,225
than he does with the guys.

1896
01:59:08,308 --> 01:59:10,978
He has to be a leader,
he has to be a street tough

1897
01:59:11,061 --> 01:59:14,147
and all the things that you would expect
from Eazy-E- he's from the street.

1898
01:59:14,231 --> 01:59:16,483
But, basically,

1899
01:59:16,567 --> 01:59:21,154
you serve the father-son relationship
between the two in the blocking.

1900
01:59:22,114 --> 01:59:24,449
And, of course, this is where
we meet Jimmy lovine,

1901
01:59:24,533 --> 01:59:29,329
who is, to this day,
Dr. Dre's business partner.

1902
01:59:29,413 --> 01:59:31,790
This is the beginning.
This is where it all happens.

1903
01:59:31,874 --> 01:59:35,252
And if you do a little homework,
you'll see that they've gone on

1904
01:59:35,335 --> 01:59:38,839
to not only work with each other with
Death Row Records and lnterscope,

1905
01:59:38,922 --> 01:59:41,008
but with Aftermath and then, of course,

1906
01:59:41,091 --> 01:59:45,304
on to one of their bigger ventures,
which is Beats headphones,

1907
01:59:45,387 --> 01:59:48,181
which they went on to sell to Apple.

1908
01:59:48,265 --> 01:59:51,727
Which was one of the biggest deals
in Apple's history.

1909
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:54,771
Not only that, but one of the biggest deals
to ever happen to a hip-hop artist.

1910
01:59:54,938 --> 01:59:56,898
To not only work with each other with
Death Row Records and lnterscope,

1911
01:59:56,982 --> 01:59:59,234
but with Aftermath and then, of course,

1912
01:59:59,318 --> 02:00:03,238
on to one of their bigger ventures,
which is Beats headphones,

1913
02:00:03,322 --> 02:00:06,366
which they went on to sell to Apple.

1914
02:00:06,450 --> 02:00:10,078
Which was one of the biggest deals
in Apple's history.

1915
02:00:10,162 --> 02:00:15,334
Not only that, but one of the biggest deals
to ever happen to a hip-hop artist.

1916
02:00:15,417 --> 02:00:17,669
And this is where it all begins.

1917
02:00:17,753 --> 02:00:20,756
Mark Sherman plays Jimmy lovine.

1918
02:00:20,839 --> 02:00:23,925
Again, this is one of those cases
of midnight casting.

1919
02:00:24,009 --> 02:00:27,512
This guy walked in.
He had the attitude.

1920
02:00:27,596 --> 02:00:30,891
He knew what he was talking about,
and he held his own.

1921
02:00:30,974 --> 02:00:32,684
I really like what he did.

1922
02:00:36,355 --> 02:00:42,361
This is a moment that Dre explained
to me happened quite a bit.

1923
02:00:43,278 --> 02:00:48,367
There was things that escalated
unnecessarily at Death Row,

1924
02:00:48,450 --> 02:00:55,457
and it started to shift the way he felt
about his decision to leave Ruthless.

1925
02:00:55,540 --> 02:01:00,545
It's like almostjumping
from the frying pan and into the fire.

1926
02:01:05,509 --> 02:01:10,138
We obviously couldn't put all of the things
that happened in Death Row into the movie,

1927
02:01:10,222 --> 02:01:12,849
but this is one of the moments
that we captured

1928
02:01:12,933 --> 02:01:18,355
to show that this was not the place
that he thought it was going to be.

1929
02:01:18,438 --> 02:01:20,774
This was not the company
that he wanted to build,

1930
02:01:20,857 --> 02:01:22,859
and this was just the beginning.

1931
02:01:25,028 --> 02:01:29,324
This moment here was a huge moment
for everybody involved-

1932
02:01:29,408 --> 02:01:32,661
the verdict of the Rodney King trial.

1933
02:01:32,744 --> 02:01:36,915
It surprised everyone,
and the city of Los Angeles burned.

1934
02:01:39,751 --> 02:01:42,003
This was really, really important

1935
02:01:42,087 --> 02:01:44,673
because Cube and the group
really tried to warn everybody.

1936
02:01:44,756 --> 02:01:48,677
“Listen, this is really going on.
And I know you guys don't believe us.”

1937
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:53,724
In a strange way, they felt really sad
that the riots happened in the way that it did,

1938
02:01:53,807 --> 02:01:56,184
but almost vindicated at the same time.

1939
02:01:56,268 --> 02:01:59,646
Which is kind of this strange dichotomy,
because there was a warning.

1940
02:01:59,730 --> 02:02:03,358
“We told you people will rise up
if this continues to happen.”

1941
02:02:03,442 --> 02:02:07,988
And we all experienced
the death, the destruction

1942
02:02:08,071 --> 02:02:11,032
and this reaction-
this emotional reaction to police brutality.

1943
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:16,538
And this reaction-
this emotional reaction to police brutality.

1944
02:02:16,621 --> 02:02:22,085
And it's really sad
that it's still happening to this day.

1945
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:26,798
I thought that this moment
was really important in the film.

1946
02:02:28,175 --> 02:02:34,765
Because this is part of what motivates
some of these artists

1947
02:02:34,848 --> 02:02:36,600
to write what they write.

1948
02:02:36,683 --> 02:02:39,519
And this moment in particular
was important,

1949
02:02:39,603 --> 02:02:44,900
because it's really time for these
young guys to come together

1950
02:02:44,983 --> 02:02:48,737
and do something positive
and stop killing each other.

1951
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:52,783
The red rag and the blue rag
and the senseless violence

1952
02:02:54,117 --> 02:02:56,620
is something that was extremely
important for me to convey.

1953
02:02:56,703 --> 02:03:01,541
And I hope when these young guys
who are involved with gangs see this,

1954
02:03:01,625 --> 02:03:03,335
at least they think twice

1955
02:03:03,418 --> 02:03:07,214
about the senseless violence
that goes on in the streets

1956
02:03:07,297 --> 02:03:11,384
of LA, Chicago, New York, Baltimore,
so on and so forth.

1957
02:03:13,053 --> 02:03:16,556
It goes beyond N.W.A.
It goes beyond the music.

1958
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:18,767
It goes beyond hip-hop.

1959
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:20,393
It's just important.

1960
02:03:20,477 --> 02:03:23,772
It's senseless,
and it needs to change.

1961
02:03:25,106 --> 02:03:28,401
All this weed
is for your Ruthless artists?

1962
02:03:28,485 --> 02:03:34,908
Yeah. Shit, I'm tryin' to take care
of these little money problems.

1963
02:03:34,991 --> 02:03:37,577
They can smoke it, sell it,
throw a party on it.

1964
02:03:37,661 --> 02:03:41,581
Eazy-E is really in a bad way now.

1965
02:03:43,083 --> 02:03:46,586
Dre experienced a certain level
of success with his company.

1966
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:50,298
Cube is going off
to start doing movies.

1967
02:03:51,299 --> 02:03:55,595
And Eazy is really starting
to wonder what's going on.

1968
02:03:55,679 --> 02:03:58,723
He's not where he used to be.

1969
02:03:58,807 --> 02:04:01,309
He's not the artist that he used to be.

1970
02:04:01,393 --> 02:04:03,728
He's having financial troubles

1971
02:04:03,812 --> 02:04:07,232
and he's gotta revert back to things
he did in the beginning of the movie,

1972
02:04:07,315 --> 02:04:09,109
which is sell drugs.

1973
02:04:09,192 --> 02:04:12,821
His journey's almost come full circle.

1974
02:04:13,613 --> 02:04:16,491
I don't know if you noticed that,
but you see in this scene

1975
02:04:16,575 --> 02:04:18,535
that was the first cough.

1976
02:04:18,618 --> 02:04:23,874
And we all know that Eazy-E,
unfortunately, died of AIDS.

1977
02:04:23,957 --> 02:04:26,918
I didn't want to just lay it all out there.

1978
02:04:27,002 --> 02:04:32,215
I wanted to kind of slowly reveal
that this guy was sick,

1979
02:04:32,299 --> 02:04:34,968
and we buried it in this scene.

1980
02:04:35,802 --> 02:04:40,015
And we also showed that this
is really the beginning

1981
02:04:40,098 --> 02:04:42,976
of the downfall of Eazy-E.

1982
02:04:43,059 --> 02:04:47,981
And especially, not only with the group-
or what's left of the group-

1983
02:04:48,064 --> 02:04:51,943
but what's left of his relationship
with Jerry Heller.

1984
02:04:52,027 --> 02:04:53,778
You can see
they're starting to go at it.

1985
02:05:01,953 --> 02:05:05,206
I like this moment 'cause you can really tell
that MC Ren and DJ Yella

1986
02:05:05,290 --> 02:05:08,001
really care about Eazy-E.

1987
02:05:08,918 --> 02:05:11,046
You see his house
being packed up.

1988
02:05:11,129 --> 02:05:15,967
He lived this great life in this big
mansion, almost like Scarf ace,

1989
02:05:16,051 --> 02:05:19,346
and now he needs protection
and he's losing money

1990
02:05:19,429 --> 02:05:21,806
and things are changing.

1991
02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:23,516
Cut to Ice Cube.

1992
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:26,394
He's not only experienced
a lot of success writing music,

1993
02:05:26,478 --> 02:05:29,731
now he's writing
his first motion picture, Friday.

1994
02:05:29,814 --> 02:05:32,233
Which is, coincidentally,
my first movie.

1995
02:05:32,317 --> 02:05:35,403
I should be somewhere on the phone
giving him notes in the movie,

1996
02:05:36,446 --> 02:05:41,493
it's kind of a fun moment because you have
O'Shea Jackson, Jr. playing his dad,

1997
02:05:41,576 --> 02:05:46,873
watching his dad in the first music video
that they made.

1998
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:50,126
It's kind of an interesting moment.

1999
02:06:00,804 --> 02:06:06,142
Cut to Eazy-E, who can't
escape Dr. Dre's success.

2000
02:06:06,226 --> 02:06:11,272
The Chronic went on to be one of
the biggest hip-hop albums of all time,

2001
02:06:11,356 --> 02:06:13,024
a classic,

2002
02:06:13,108 --> 02:06:17,654
and you can tell that he's starting
to realize that he made a mistake.

2003
02:06:18,988 --> 02:06:21,616
That Tower Records building
is actually a digital building.

2004
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:24,577
It used to look like that.

2005
02:06:24,661 --> 02:06:28,456
But, obviously, nowadays
Sunset Boulevard is completely different,

2006
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:31,918
so we had to put
that building in digitally.

2007
02:06:32,001 --> 02:06:34,671
But you could see Eazy
passing Tower Records

2008
02:06:34,754 --> 02:06:39,718
and seeing, “Hey, maybe I made a mistake
with going the route that I took.”

2009
02:06:40,468 --> 02:06:43,430
I like this moment because Tomica Woods,

2010
02:06:43,513 --> 02:06:48,727
she actually told me that this moment
happened quite a bit,

2011
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:52,939
where she would kind of kick back
and smoke a little weed

2012
02:06:53,022 --> 02:06:57,277
and have these very interesting
conversations with Eazy,

2013
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:59,112
kind of heart-to-hearts.

2014
02:06:59,195 --> 02:07:03,241
And it's great to put these type
of moments in a movie,

2015
02:07:03,324 --> 02:07:08,580
especially when you have so much,
I don't know, just tough-guy stuff going on.

2016
02:07:08,663 --> 02:07:10,081
And we've all been there.

2017
02:07:10,165 --> 02:07:12,292
We have our tough exterior,

2018
02:07:12,375 --> 02:07:17,505
and then you end up hanging out
with a girl that you really feel,

2019
02:07:17,589 --> 02:07:19,924
and you turn into another guy.

2020
02:07:20,008 --> 02:07:21,968
He was a tough guy,
but he was actually pretty passionate.

2021
02:07:22,051 --> 02:07:25,805
So I like the fact that Jason
was able to loosen up

2022
02:07:25,889 --> 02:07:28,475
and show that he was vulnerable

2023
02:07:30,101 --> 02:07:34,689
and not just a guy
who can spew controversy.

2024
02:07:39,486 --> 02:07:42,614
This scene right here wasn't
in the theatrical release,

2025
02:07:42,697 --> 02:07:46,326
and I like it because, again,

2026
02:07:46,409 --> 02:07:51,956
you see the father-son dynamic
between Jerry and Eazy.

2027
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:55,460
But you can start to feel that Eazy's
kind of not having it.

2028
02:07:55,543 --> 02:07:59,130
He comes over with this kung pao chicken,
he's fixing him a plate,

2029
02:07:59,214 --> 02:08:02,550
he's got a little iced tea, and he's like,
“Listen, I'm gonna take care of you.”

2030
02:08:02,634 --> 02:08:04,802
And he's like, “Get the fuck
out of here with that.”

2031
02:08:04,886 --> 02:08:06,679
Look at that look.

2032
02:08:06,763 --> 02:08:09,641
If looks could kill.
“Get the fuck out of here.”

2033
02:08:09,724 --> 02:08:13,520
And I love Paul
because Paul's so expressive.

2034
02:08:13,603 --> 02:08:19,150
He's kind of like trying to check to see
if Tomica is a problem

2035
02:08:19,234 --> 02:08:23,905
or, you know, is she just
kind of a groupie.

2036
02:08:23,988 --> 02:08:26,366
And he wants him to sign these checks.

2037
02:08:26,449 --> 02:08:28,743
It's just a really interesting moment.

2038
02:08:30,161 --> 02:08:32,080
He grabs a bite of food,
pacifies him,

2039
02:08:32,163 --> 02:08:34,290
and you can just see the look
on his face.

2040
02:08:34,374 --> 02:08:39,170
He just really realizes that,
“Our relationship is really changing,

2041
02:08:39,254 --> 02:08:41,381
and I'm not really sure
where it's coming from.

2042
02:08:41,464 --> 02:08:43,174
Maybe it's Tomica,
maybe it's someone else,

2043
02:08:43,258 --> 02:08:45,593
but something's just not right.”

2044
02:09:03,069 --> 02:09:07,490
Yet another scene that didn't
make the theatrical release.

2045
02:09:07,574 --> 02:09:11,828
I loved working
with the women in this movie

2046
02:09:11,911 --> 02:09:16,165
because you got a real sense
that these guys,

2047
02:09:16,249 --> 02:09:18,543
as tough as they sound on wax,

2048
02:09:18,626 --> 02:09:20,837
they really love the women
in their lives.

2049
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:23,172
Dre, to this day,
is married to Nicole.

2050
02:09:23,256 --> 02:09:25,174
He's got a great family.

2051
02:09:25,258 --> 02:09:31,931
And he's been married
for 20-something years to this woman.

2052
02:09:32,015 --> 02:09:36,102
So when you get these complaints about
misogyny and all this type of stuff-

2053
02:09:36,185 --> 02:09:40,440
These guys- Even Ice Cube
has been married for over 2O years.

2054
02:09:41,566 --> 02:09:44,694
You gotta be able to really
kind of separate

2055
02:09:44,777 --> 02:09:48,823
the art, and the choices they make in art,
and real life.

2056
02:09:48,906 --> 02:09:50,950
Now, I'm sure they've been through
some tough things

2057
02:09:51,117 --> 02:09:54,871
because you got a real sense
that these guys,

2058
02:09:54,954 --> 02:09:57,206
as tough as they sound on wax,

2059
02:09:57,290 --> 02:09:59,083
they really love the women
in their lives.

2060
02:09:59,167 --> 02:10:01,878
Dre, to this day,
is married to Nicole.

2061
02:10:01,961 --> 02:10:03,838
He's got a great family.

2062
02:10:03,921 --> 02:10:10,678
And he's been married
for 20-something years to this woman.

2063
02:10:10,762 --> 02:10:14,682
So when you get these complaints
about misogyny and all this type of stuff-

2064
02:10:14,766 --> 02:10:19,103
These guys- Even Ice Cube
has been married for over 2O years.

2065
02:10:19,187 --> 02:10:21,731
You gotta be able to really
kind of separate

2066
02:10:21,814 --> 02:10:25,818
the art, and the choices they make in art,
and real life.

2067
02:10:25,902 --> 02:10:28,071
Now, I'm sure they've been through
some tough things

2068
02:10:28,154 --> 02:10:30,865
and the stuff that you would expect,

2069
02:10:30,948 --> 02:10:33,785
but, at the same time,
from what I know of these guys,

2070
02:10:33,868 --> 02:10:35,870
it's really an inspiration.

2071
02:10:35,953 --> 02:10:38,956
If you want to change your life,

2072
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:41,918
and you grow up
in a really dangerous environment,

2073
02:10:42,001 --> 02:10:46,589
this movie should inspire you not to just
go on and make a ton of money

2074
02:10:46,673 --> 02:10:48,549
and do well in business,

2075
02:10:48,633 --> 02:10:54,722
but to inspire you to understand
that you can change your reality

2076
02:10:54,806 --> 02:10:56,557
and create what you want.

2077
02:10:56,641 --> 02:10:58,685
And these guys did that.

2078
02:11:01,062 --> 02:11:04,524
What I like about this scene is
we get a chance to get a sense

2079
02:11:04,607 --> 02:11:07,527
of what Death Row felt like
back in the day.

2080
02:11:07,610 --> 02:11:12,323
But we also get a chance to get
a real small snippet of Tupac,

2081
02:11:12,407 --> 02:11:14,575
who's played by Marco Rose.

2082
02:11:14,659 --> 02:11:17,286
I remember meeting this guy
for the first time,

2083
02:11:17,370 --> 02:11:22,709
and I was ﬂoored
by his likeness to Tupac.

2084
02:11:22,792 --> 02:11:24,502
I worked with Pac before in the '90s.

2085
02:11:24,585 --> 02:11:29,048
I actually directed a music video
with Cube, Dre and Tupac,

2086
02:11:29,132 --> 02:11:35,471
and it was just uncanny,
the resemblance to Tupac.

2087
02:11:35,555 --> 02:11:37,473
It was crazy.

2088
02:11:37,557 --> 02:11:38,975
It was hard for me to even direct him

2089
02:11:39,058 --> 02:11:43,187
because you would just sit there
and stare at this guy and go, “Wow!”

2090
02:11:43,271 --> 02:11:47,817
This guy is really embodying
who this guy is,

2091
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:50,445
and we haven't seen him in a long time.

2092
02:11:50,528 --> 02:11:53,448
And you just almost feel
like you saw a ghost.

2093
02:11:56,784 --> 02:12:00,580
This is one of my favorite collaborations
between Dre and Tupac.

2094
02:12:00,663 --> 02:12:04,000
One of the famous collaborations
in hip-hop, “California Love,”

2095
02:12:04,083 --> 02:12:08,045
and, of course,
it's interrupted by the drama.

2096
02:12:08,129 --> 02:12:10,631
By the way, that's my nephew
in the background, Tyrell,

2097
02:12:10,715 --> 02:12:12,341
who's by that couch.

2098
02:12:16,262 --> 02:12:21,142
Now, he walks into Babylon-
the equivalent of Babylon.

2099
02:12:21,225 --> 02:12:25,313
It's this huge lounge
at Death Row

2100
02:12:25,396 --> 02:12:30,443
where this guy is being essentially
tortured like he's in Guanténamo Bay

2101
02:12:30,526 --> 02:12:34,280
by a guy with a huge bull mastiff.

2102
02:12:34,363 --> 02:12:38,493
And, as Dre would put it,
it's a fuckin' circus.

2103
02:12:38,576 --> 02:12:41,954
This is a place
that doesn't feel like a company.

2104
02:12:42,038 --> 02:12:45,500
It feels more like a prison.

2105
02:12:45,583 --> 02:12:50,129
And this is not what
he had envisioned for himself.

2106
02:12:50,213 --> 02:12:52,632
And you can see the contrast

2107
02:12:52,715 --> 02:12:56,344
between how much fun the guys
had in the beginning of the movie

2108
02:12:56,427 --> 02:12:58,179
when they were recording
“Boyz-N-The-Hood”

2109
02:12:58,262 --> 02:13:00,264
and the smiles and the brotherhood.

2110
02:13:00,348 --> 02:13:05,394
And now it feels like- although
he has a Ferrari and a pretty girl

2111
02:13:05,478 --> 02:13:07,980
and all this money
and he's selling all these albums-

2112
02:13:08,064 --> 02:13:11,651
that all that glitters is not gold.

2113
02:13:11,734 --> 02:13:13,486
And you kind of learn this lesson.

2114
02:13:13,569 --> 02:13:17,031
It's like sometimes
when you gain material success,

2115
02:13:17,114 --> 02:13:20,910
it's not necessarily
the best thing in the world,

2116
02:13:20,993 --> 02:13:25,873
or it doesn't necessarily add up
to success in life.

2117
02:13:25,957 --> 02:13:31,921
This is something that he was really
passionate about putting in the movie.

2118
02:13:32,004 --> 02:13:35,174
And I think it not only helps
with Dre's character,

2119
02:13:35,258 --> 02:13:38,511
but it really helps define
where he is in life,

2120
02:13:38,594 --> 02:13:40,388
even with all this material success,

2121
02:13:40,471 --> 02:13:43,850
but also helps you understand
what motivates him to leave

2122
02:13:43,933 --> 02:13:45,685
a little later on in the movie.

2123
02:13:45,768 --> 02:13:48,729
This my motherfuckin' name
on the wall, man!

2124
02:13:50,857 --> 02:13:53,943
And <i>y'all</i> in here actin' like
<i>y'all</i> on motherfuckin' vacation.

2125
02:13:54,026 --> 02:13:56,946
I got Pac in the next motherfuckin' room.

2126
02:13:57,029 --> 02:13:59,073
Grindin', man. Workin'.

2127
02:14:00,575 --> 02:14:02,410
You see the crown
next to Suge Knight.

2128
02:14:02,493 --> 02:14:05,705
I really wanted to show
that he's ruling his kingdom.

2129
02:14:05,788 --> 02:14:09,417
This is an important moment
where we show the police there,

2130
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:15,923
because now Dr. Dre feels like,
“I can't go anywhere.

2131
02:14:16,007 --> 02:14:20,803
Everyplace I go feels corrupt.

2132
02:14:20,970 --> 02:14:24,056
Everyplace I go feels corrupt.

2133
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:26,684
I can't deal with my friends.

2134
02:14:26,767 --> 02:14:31,105
I can't go to my company.
I'm getting screwed over.

2135
02:14:31,188 --> 02:14:33,816
We've already had a challenging
relationship with the police,

2136
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:37,778
and now they're in
on this criminal activity.

2137
02:14:37,862 --> 02:14:40,781
This is really strange.”

2138
02:14:45,411 --> 02:14:48,581
And so he's gotta get out of here

2139
02:14:48,664 --> 02:14:51,459
because this is-
and I quote-

2140
02:14:51,542 --> 02:14:54,003
“the straw that breaks the camel's back.”

2141
02:14:54,086 --> 02:14:58,674
He jumps into his Testarossa
after having left Babylon,

2142
02:14:58,758 --> 02:15:04,013
and now he gets into this high-speed
car chase with the police.

2143
02:15:04,096 --> 02:15:06,474
He just left Death Row
with the police there,

2144
02:15:06,557 --> 02:15:11,145
so now he's like, “I don't give a shit
about being chased by the cops

2145
02:15:11,228 --> 02:15:13,981
because I don't know who's real,
I don't know who's fake,

2146
02:15:14,065 --> 02:15:15,524
I don't know who's corrupt.”

2147
02:15:15,608 --> 02:15:19,070
And so that's part of the reason
why he just runs.

2148
02:15:19,153 --> 02:15:20,655
He's fed up.

2149
02:15:26,577 --> 02:15:28,996
He has no faith in the system.

2150
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:31,749
He almost just loses faith in humanity.

2151
02:15:31,832 --> 02:15:35,086
And he admits, listen,
along the way, he made mistakes.

2152
02:15:35,169 --> 02:15:36,754
He wasn't an angel.

2153
02:15:36,837 --> 02:15:39,840
But at the same time, this is the moment
that changed his life.

2154
02:15:39,924 --> 02:15:41,759
Because when he was arrested

2155
02:15:41,842 --> 02:15:46,681
and he went to jail for I believe it was
120 days or something like that,

2156
02:15:46,764 --> 02:15:49,392
he had a lot of time to think

2157
02:15:49,475 --> 02:15:51,936
and think about
all the choices he made

2158
02:15:52,019 --> 02:15:54,480
and all the mistakes
that he made,

2159
02:15:54,563 --> 02:15:59,527
and realized that he wasn't really
surrounded by friends.

2160
02:15:59,610 --> 02:16:04,115
He had to change his life, otherwise
something extreme was gonna happen.

2161
02:16:04,991 --> 02:16:07,118
And this is where he gets arrested.

2162
02:16:10,246 --> 02:16:13,666
From that point on,
Dr. Dre's life completely changed.

2163
02:16:17,628 --> 02:16:23,342
Now this takes place in New York
at a club called the Tunnel,

2164
02:16:23,426 --> 02:16:25,720
a famous hip-hop club

2165
02:16:25,803 --> 02:16:29,223
that all of the famous rappers
would go and hang out.

2166
02:16:29,306 --> 02:16:32,935
This is a meeting that Cube
would always describe,

2167
02:16:33,019 --> 02:16:35,896
which is his last meeting with Eazy-E.

2168
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:41,485
I thought it was actually
pretty humble of Eazy

2169
02:16:41,569 --> 02:16:44,947
to walk into what is
essentially Cube's lair.

2170
02:16:45,031 --> 02:16:49,035
Cube is surrounded by Da Lench Mob.
He's got his crew with him.

2171
02:16:49,118 --> 02:16:52,038
You know half those guys are strapped.

2172
02:16:52,121 --> 02:16:56,125
And the last interaction he had with Eazy-

2173
02:16:56,208 --> 02:16:58,085
or at the very least his goons-

2174
02:16:58,169 --> 02:17:00,421
was at the New Music Seminar.

2175
02:17:00,504 --> 02:17:06,886
So at any moment, a brawl, a war
or a gunfight could break out.

2176
02:17:06,969 --> 02:17:09,138
We wanted that tension there.

2177
02:17:10,681 --> 02:17:14,393
But at the end of the day,
when you have love for somebody,

2178
02:17:15,895 --> 02:17:19,940
a lot of times, if you are mature enough,
you get over it.

2179
02:17:20,024 --> 02:17:25,029
That's what this moment is for me,
and I think it was for Cube.

2180
02:17:26,447 --> 02:17:28,574
It does seem a little easy

2181
02:17:28,657 --> 02:17:32,119
that after all the drama
and “No Vaseline” and the big brawl,

2182
02:17:32,203 --> 02:17:35,289
that it may feel a little easy
that they just bury the hatchet.

2183
02:17:35,372 --> 02:17:39,960
But as Cube telIs it, you know what,
he didn't really have a beef with Eazy.

2184
02:17:40,044 --> 02:17:43,547
Eazy is the guy who helped him
start his career.

2185
02:17:43,631 --> 02:17:47,593
He just wanted
to keep the drama on wax.

2186
02:17:47,676 --> 02:17:54,725
He feels like the physicality
and all of the street shit is not hip-hop.

2187
02:17:55,392 --> 02:18:00,397
It's just a great message to everyone
who loves hip-hop.

2188
02:18:00,481 --> 02:18:03,150
If it has to be physical,
it's not really hip-hop.

2189
02:18:03,234 --> 02:18:05,402
If you have skill, put it on wax.

2190
02:18:05,486 --> 02:18:09,156
Anything beyond that, you're just a thug,

2191
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:14,161
and there's nothing really cool
about taking it there.

2192
02:18:15,204 --> 02:18:16,914
I like that message.

2193
02:18:17,873 --> 02:18:24,338
Part of my job is to create an environment
that's comfortable

2194
02:18:24,421 --> 02:18:28,843
so my actors can really get out there
and create.

2195
02:18:28,926 --> 02:18:34,849
And I really have
a really great relationship with-

2196
02:18:34,932 --> 02:18:37,184
I call 'em my team.
This is my team.

2197
02:18:37,268 --> 02:18:39,270
You know. The N.W.A team-

2198
02:18:39,353 --> 02:18:44,233
Shea, Jason, Aldis, Neil and Corey.

2199
02:18:44,942 --> 02:18:46,861
I put 'em through a lot.

2200
02:18:46,944 --> 02:18:50,531
But we're all like family now.

2201
02:18:50,614 --> 02:18:53,033
The movie's been released. it's done well.

2202
02:18:53,117 --> 02:18:54,827
But we talk often

2203
02:18:54,910 --> 02:18:57,496
and we went through a lot
to make this movie.

2204
02:18:57,580 --> 02:19:01,750
I really wanted to create an environment
for them to ﬂourish-

2205
02:19:01,834 --> 02:19:04,879
because a lot of these guys are new at this-
and they did.

2206
02:19:04,962 --> 02:19:10,509
But the love you see there
between these two guys-

2207
02:19:10,593 --> 02:19:13,387
By the end of the shoot-
'Cause this was towards the end.

2208
02:19:13,470 --> 02:19:16,015
A lot of that was real, man.

2209
02:19:16,098 --> 02:19:20,227
A lot of that was real.
That concern was real.

2210
02:19:20,311 --> 02:19:22,354
That's the second cough, by the way.

2211
02:19:23,022 --> 02:19:28,694
You can see that Eazy is slowly
starting to deteriorate.

2212
02:19:28,777 --> 02:19:32,448
His eyes are glassy and red.

2213
02:19:33,574 --> 02:19:38,537
You can start to see that somethings
not right with him physically.

2214
02:19:38,621 --> 02:19:43,209
But they buried it,
and it's water under the bridge.

2215
02:19:43,292 --> 02:19:46,337
Now we want the group
to get back together.

2216
02:19:47,546 --> 02:19:49,423
She is a very talented actress.

2217
02:19:49,506 --> 02:19:51,926
Her name is Carra Patterson,
out of New York.

2218
02:19:52,009 --> 02:19:53,761
She's playing Tomica.

2219
02:19:53,844 --> 02:19:58,599
And for the short amount of screen time-

2220
02:19:58,682 --> 02:20:04,313
I think most all of the women
did a great job, really connecting,

2221
02:20:04,396 --> 02:20:09,985
just to counter all of the testosterone
in this movie and in the music.

2222
02:20:10,069 --> 02:20:14,823
She did a great job
catching Jason's back.

2223
02:20:14,907 --> 02:20:16,784
There was good chemistry there.

2224
02:20:18,244 --> 02:20:20,120
This is the moment where he finds out

2225
02:20:20,204 --> 02:20:23,707
that the counting is a little off,
or a lot off.

2226
02:20:23,791 --> 02:20:28,712
More importantly, he really knows for sure

2227
02:20:28,796 --> 02:20:31,882
that something is just not right.

2228
02:20:35,427 --> 02:20:39,139
If you look really close, you'll see
I made some choices visually.

2229
02:20:39,223 --> 02:20:41,058
I'm not gonna give that up.

2230
02:20:41,141 --> 02:20:43,060
When I see you next,
we can talk about it.

2231
02:20:43,143 --> 02:20:45,062
But there's something I did visually
in this scene

2232
02:20:45,145 --> 02:20:52,111
to really capture
what these guys represent.

2233
02:20:52,736 --> 02:20:54,655
I'll just leave it at that.

2234
02:21:00,286 --> 02:21:03,330
I believe this is one of Jason's
stronger moments as well.

2235
02:21:03,414 --> 02:21:05,499
It should be. it's the end of the movie.

2236
02:21:05,582 --> 02:21:09,545
He's dealing with a heavyweight
in Paul Giamatti.

2237
02:21:13,632 --> 02:21:17,386
In rehearsals, I would tell the guys,
“We are a family.

2238
02:21:17,469 --> 02:21:20,597
It's really important
that we support each other.

2239
02:21:20,681 --> 02:21:22,474
So if you're off-camera

2240
02:21:22,558 --> 02:21:26,228
and you have to do a scene
and you're not on-camera,

2241
02:21:26,312 --> 02:21:28,856
you'd better give it,
you'd better bring it,

2242
02:21:28,939 --> 02:21:33,569
so that the other actor has the ability
to actually perform.”

2243
02:21:33,652 --> 02:21:37,323
But on this day,
I said, “You guys are enemies.”

2244
02:21:37,406 --> 02:21:39,199
I told them that separately.

2245
02:21:39,283 --> 02:21:40,826
More importantly, I told Jason that.

2246
02:21:40,909 --> 02:21:44,204
'Cause I didn't want him to walk into
this loving environment

2247
02:21:44,288 --> 02:21:49,460
and have this father figure
that he's essentially going to fire.

2248
02:21:50,502 --> 02:21:56,175
I think that Jason and Paul
have great chemistry.

2249
02:21:57,634 --> 02:22:01,805
Again, it's not just about a male-female thing.

2250
02:22:01,889 --> 02:22:05,267
When you're an artist-
it's almost like music.

2251
02:22:05,351 --> 02:22:08,145
You have a jam session
and you're working with great artists,

2252
02:22:08,228 --> 02:22:11,523
they all can get into the same rhythm.

2253
02:22:11,607 --> 02:22:15,694
Although these guys are opposing
each other in this scene,

2254
02:22:15,778 --> 02:22:17,363
the chemistry is amazing.

2255
02:22:17,446 --> 02:22:20,491
You can see there that Jerry
really cares about this guy.

2256
02:22:21,742 --> 02:22:25,371
You can also see that Eazy's really in pain.

2257
02:22:26,455 --> 02:22:28,665
But the chemistry is there.

2258
02:22:29,500 --> 02:22:31,919
You can feel it.
It's just magnetic.

2259
02:22:34,797 --> 02:22:38,258
When you have actors
that make these strong choices,

2260
02:22:38,342 --> 02:22:40,135
you don't have to do anything.

2261
02:22:40,219 --> 02:22:45,265
All you have to do is set up the camera
and let them do their thing.

2262
02:22:46,266 --> 02:22:48,644
It's all in the eyes. Just watch.

2263
02:22:48,727 --> 02:22:52,147
Jerry/Paul- watch his eyes.

2264
02:22:53,690 --> 02:22:57,945
Watch Jason and his eyes.

2265
02:22:58,028 --> 02:23:00,197
It's all underneath.

2266
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:03,700
This is one of those scenes where you
don't have to listen to the dialogue.

2267
02:23:03,784 --> 02:23:07,287
You can see everything in their eyes.

2268
02:23:07,371 --> 02:23:12,709
That's really a great sign
of an amazing performer.

2269
02:23:13,877 --> 02:23:17,589
I believe them
and I believe the relationship

2270
02:23:17,673 --> 02:23:19,883
and I believe the pain and the hurt.

2271
02:23:22,594 --> 02:23:24,555
I loved working with these guys, man.

2272
02:23:25,889 --> 02:23:29,059
I know I'm having a moment,
but these guys are amazing.

2273
02:23:29,143 --> 02:23:32,312
But I didn't start this.
I didn't fuck it up.

2274
02:23:32,396 --> 02:23:33,897
You did!

2275
02:23:35,149 --> 02:23:36,567
No.

2276
02:23:38,569 --> 02:23:40,070
You did.

2277
02:23:41,822 --> 02:23:43,365
You fired, Jerry.

2278
02:23:44,241 --> 02:23:48,829
With Jason, it's so interesting,
you can tell that he's really accessing

2279
02:23:48,912 --> 02:23:52,541
something different
than just kind of actory choices.

2280
02:23:52,624 --> 02:23:55,919
He's been through a lot.
He's been on the streets of New Orleans.

2281
02:23:56,628 --> 02:24:00,841
He's accessing real life.
That's the reason why he feels so real.

2282
02:24:00,924 --> 02:24:08,432
And with Paul, he's just, again,
one of the best actors around alive.

2283
02:24:08,932 --> 02:24:12,352
And to really show the chemistry

2284
02:24:12,436 --> 02:24:17,149
between a guy
from the opposite end of the spectrum

2285
02:24:17,232 --> 02:24:19,026
and another guy the same-

2286
02:24:19,109 --> 02:24:23,238
There are days I can't wait to see them
come together and perform

2287
02:24:23,322 --> 02:24:25,199
because you end up
with a scene like that.

2288
02:24:25,282 --> 02:24:27,284
I think they were both great.

2289
02:24:28,243 --> 02:24:32,289
This is another one of those moments
that served the theme of brotherhood.

2290
02:24:32,372 --> 02:24:34,750
You have Eazy who calls Dre.

2291
02:24:34,917 --> 02:24:38,003
You have Eazy who calls Dre.

2292
02:24:39,004 --> 02:24:45,010
This is one of the more vulnerable moments
for a guy from the streets

2293
02:24:45,093 --> 02:24:52,142
who has to basically say,
“Hey, I was wrong. I got love for you.

2294
02:24:52,226 --> 02:24:54,394
I want to do this over again.

2295
02:24:54,478 --> 02:24:56,188
Will you forgive me?”

2296
02:24:59,858 --> 02:25:01,902
I want to do this over again.

2297
02:25:01,985 --> 02:25:03,737
Will you forgive me?”

2298
02:25:03,820 --> 02:25:08,325
And while those aren't necessarily
the words that he used,

2299
02:25:08,408 --> 02:25:10,661
that's the sentiment.

2300
02:25:10,744 --> 02:25:15,999
That's what makes Jason,
who plays Eazy, so endearing.

2301
02:25:16,083 --> 02:25:20,003
You look in his eyes and you could tell-
“Man, I made a mistake.”

2302
02:25:20,087 --> 02:25:24,007
A lot of us sometimes, especially
coming from where we come from,

2303
02:25:24,091 --> 02:25:25,842
we need to get over ourselves.

2304
02:25:25,926 --> 02:25:30,681
There are times where you let your pride
get in the way,

2305
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:35,269
especially in situations where you shouldn't.

2306
02:25:35,352 --> 02:25:38,981
And to be the bigger man,
you gotta make the phone call.

2307
02:25:43,318 --> 02:25:46,863
I love this moment.
You can see Corey, who plays Dre,

2308
02:25:46,947 --> 02:25:49,616
just lighten up and brighten up.

2309
02:25:49,700 --> 02:25:54,955
In the midst of all the street shit
and Death Row and the tough guy stuff,

2310
02:25:55,038 --> 02:25:57,457
these guys are just young dudes
who want to create

2311
02:25:57,541 --> 02:25:59,876
and they want to get back to basics-

2312
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:03,797
the love of creating
and the love of their brothers.

2313
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:07,718
And if you don't take anything
away from this movie,

2314
02:26:07,801 --> 02:26:11,388
you should understand that if you have
people in your life that you love,

2315
02:26:11,471 --> 02:26:13,515
love 'em while they're here, man.

2316
02:26:13,598 --> 02:26:15,976
Because there's just no guarantee
for tomorrow.

2317
02:26:16,059 --> 02:26:17,936
Again, I don't want to be preachy,

2318
02:26:18,020 --> 02:26:21,189
but that's what a lot of this means.

2319
02:26:22,399 --> 02:26:25,235
It's not just about hip-hop.
It's not just about gangster rap.

2320
02:26:25,319 --> 02:26:27,988
It's not just about Los Angeles
and N.W.A.

2321
02:26:28,071 --> 02:26:31,366
This movie is so much bigger
than N.W.A.

2322
02:26:31,450 --> 02:26:34,661
That's a quote from Ice Cube.

2323
02:26:35,954 --> 02:26:40,417
You experience the coughing,
which is worse,

2324
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:45,756
and you're really, really hoping
these guys get back together.

2325
02:26:54,890 --> 02:26:57,267
If you freeze the frame,

2326
02:26:59,102 --> 02:27:01,063
coming up really soon,

2327
02:27:01,146 --> 02:27:03,565
I kind of indicate that the end is near.

2328
02:27:04,691 --> 02:27:11,198
I do that with a freeze frame
of a painting

2329
02:27:11,281 --> 02:27:13,742
right over Eazy's shoulder.

2330
02:27:13,825 --> 02:27:15,494
It happens right about now.

2331
02:27:15,577 --> 02:27:17,954
You see the gun to his head.

2332
02:27:18,038 --> 02:27:20,123
You see the microphone.

2333
02:27:20,207 --> 02:27:24,753
It's almost like
the success of the music business

2334
02:27:24,836 --> 02:27:29,049
is what also led to his demise.

2335
02:27:29,132 --> 02:27:31,968
I can't be sure if that's what happened, but-

2336
02:27:32,052 --> 02:27:36,473
I worked with my art director
and my production designer

2337
02:27:36,556 --> 02:27:38,809
to build in some of these Easter eggs.

2338
02:27:38,892 --> 02:27:42,479
So that for the people
who love movies like this,

2339
02:27:42,562 --> 02:27:48,860
you get a chance to see things
you didn't see the first time around.

2340
02:27:52,072 --> 02:27:54,408
After the collapse and-

2341
02:27:55,617 --> 02:27:57,828
Kind of cutting to Cedars-Sinai.

2342
02:27:59,746 --> 02:28:04,668
This is one of the toughest moments
of our shoot.

2343
02:28:04,751 --> 02:28:08,213
It's not only because,
obviously, it's a challenge

2344
02:28:08,296 --> 02:28:12,592
to shoot Eazy-E in the hospital

2345
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:16,263
and the revelation that he has AIDS,

2346
02:28:16,346 --> 02:28:20,016
but this is the end of our production schedule.

2347
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:26,189
Everyone at this point developed
great and close relationships.

2348
02:28:26,273 --> 02:28:31,361
So when Shea or Aldis

2349
02:28:31,445 --> 02:28:33,196
or Neil or Corey

2350
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:36,533
would show up
and see Jason in the bed,

2351
02:28:36,616 --> 02:28:40,871
they would have a real emotional response

2352
02:28:40,954 --> 02:28:45,292
to seeing their cast-mate sick.

2353
02:28:45,375 --> 02:28:47,377
Although he was acting,

2354
02:28:47,461 --> 02:28:50,922
these guys developed a love
for each other so much so

2355
02:28:51,006 --> 02:28:58,096
that it was really hard for them
to see him in the hospital bed because

2356
02:28:59,306 --> 02:29:03,894
they really developed
a relationship with him.

2357
02:29:04,644 --> 02:29:07,772
Jason did such an amazing job

2358
02:29:07,856 --> 02:29:13,487
capturing not only
the surprise of finding out

2359
02:29:13,570 --> 02:29:17,073
he was essentially
sentenced to death-

2360
02:29:18,575 --> 02:29:21,495
But again, this is another
one of those moments

2361
02:29:21,578 --> 02:29:24,915
where he tapped into something very real.

2362
02:29:25,665 --> 02:29:30,253
I remember when-
I made sure the set was really quiet.

2363
02:29:30,337 --> 02:29:35,592
I wanted him to really, really deliver
in this moment

2364
02:29:35,675 --> 02:29:37,928
and deliver truth in this moment.

2365
02:29:38,011 --> 02:29:42,682
Tears started to roll down his eyes,

2366
02:29:42,766 --> 02:29:47,687
and you started to really understand
that this is not acting.

2367
02:29:47,771 --> 02:29:50,273
There is something that happens

2368
02:29:50,357 --> 02:29:54,528
when you're not allowed to express yourself,

2369
02:29:54,611 --> 02:29:57,030
you're not allowed to cry.

2370
02:29:57,113 --> 02:30:02,994
And this moment right here,
I think, is very personal to Jason.

2371
02:30:03,078 --> 02:30:07,624
All of the moments
that led up to this film-

2372
02:30:08,917 --> 02:30:11,002
living on the streets,

2373
02:30:11,086 --> 02:30:13,338
being from the streets,

2374
02:30:13,421 --> 02:30:16,466
having the pain of having to be
a black man in America-

2375
02:30:16,550 --> 02:30:21,179
I think he tapped into that
and he just let 'em go.

2376
02:30:21,263 --> 02:30:23,098
He let the tears go.

2377
02:30:23,181 --> 02:30:26,059
This is a real moment.

2378
02:30:26,643 --> 02:30:31,648
Our cast, they really had a hard time
seeing him in this position

2379
02:30:31,731 --> 02:30:35,068
because they knew there was
a lot of truth in those tears.

2380
02:30:37,153 --> 02:30:43,493
When you have to express
such a range of emotion in a movie

2381
02:30:44,286 --> 02:30:47,080
and you nail it
in the way that he did it,

2382
02:30:47,747 --> 02:30:49,708
that's world-class.

2383
02:30:55,463 --> 02:31:00,302
This scene wasn't in the theatrical release.

2384
02:31:02,304 --> 02:31:04,556
I hate that it wasn't, honestly,

2385
02:31:04,639 --> 02:31:10,228
because this is where
he decides to marry Tomica.

2386
02:31:10,312 --> 02:31:15,567
There was a lot of controversy
surrounding this moment.

2387
02:31:15,650 --> 02:31:17,694
But what I loved about it

2388
02:31:17,777 --> 02:31:21,781
is this is where Jason goes deeper

2389
02:31:21,865 --> 02:31:24,576
with his level of vulnerability,

2390
02:31:24,659 --> 02:31:29,664
where he really shows that “I care.”

2391
02:31:38,131 --> 02:31:44,262
When you have to express
such a range of emotion in a movie

2392
02:31:45,388 --> 02:31:48,016
and you nail it
in the way that he did it,

2393
02:31:48,933 --> 02:31:51,811
that's world-class.

2394
02:31:51,895 --> 02:31:56,858
You see that in those performances
like De Niro in Raging <i>Bull.</i>

2395
02:31:58,401 --> 02:32:04,157
I can list the performances where an actor
has to really show a full range.

2396
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:07,869
Jason just really naiIs it.

2397
02:32:08,912 --> 02:32:10,997
It was pretty emotional for me as well

2398
02:32:11,081 --> 02:32:14,209
because I felt like these guys
are my little brothers

2399
02:32:14,292 --> 02:32:19,839
and I had to shepherd them along
and teach them some things.

2400
02:32:20,882 --> 02:32:23,760
This moment right here
with Neil Brown, Jr.,

2401
02:32:23,843 --> 02:32:25,929
those tears are real.

2402
02:32:26,012 --> 02:32:28,932
As a matter of fact, when I cut,

2403
02:32:29,015 --> 02:32:32,102
I had to console him

2404
02:32:32,185 --> 02:32:36,231
because it was really hard for him
to see Jason in this condition.

2405
02:32:36,314 --> 02:32:39,359
We all knew Jason tapped into
something very real.

2406
02:32:41,277 --> 02:32:43,363
It's a testament to all these guys

2407
02:32:43,446 --> 02:32:46,241
and not only their ability to perform

2408
02:32:46,324 --> 02:32:51,121
but their ability to open up
and love each other.

2409
02:32:51,204 --> 02:32:53,206
You don't experience that
much on movies.

2410
02:32:54,207 --> 02:32:57,210
As hard as it was to see that,

2411
02:32:57,293 --> 02:32:59,504
I think we all grew personally.

2412
02:33:00,171 --> 02:33:02,799
And you want that, hopefully,

2413
02:33:02,882 --> 02:33:04,884
after the end
of an experience like this

2414
02:33:05,051 --> 02:33:10,306
where you spend a few years of your life
trying to make history

2415
02:33:10,390 --> 02:33:14,185
and put an amazing story like this
on the screen.

2416
02:33:14,894 --> 02:33:18,064
You grow professionally,
but you also grow personally.

2417
02:33:18,148 --> 02:33:19,899
I think we all did.

2418
02:33:31,995 --> 02:33:35,665
Corey kind of reminds me
of Denzel Washington in this scene,

2419
02:33:35,748 --> 02:33:40,295
'cause he has such restraint.

2420
02:33:40,378 --> 02:33:45,508
But the emotion and how he just covers-

2421
02:33:45,592 --> 02:33:47,677
or tries to cover his emotion, but it's-

2422
02:33:48,636 --> 02:33:51,639
He's trying to hold those tears back.

2423
02:33:51,723 --> 02:33:53,892
It's so emotional and so real.

2424
02:33:55,185 --> 02:33:58,271
I love- This is one of my favorite
moments with Corey.

2425
02:34:03,610 --> 02:34:09,491
People are surprised
when they see this level of emotion

2426
02:34:10,783 --> 02:34:12,368
<i>in</i> a movie called <i>Straight' Outta Compton.</i>

2427
02:34:12,452 --> 02:34:14,996
They think they're gonna get
just the thugs

2428
02:34:15,079 --> 02:34:20,627
and the drama and the danger
and the gangster rap, but-

2429
02:34:22,212 --> 02:34:25,131
There's a lot of emotion and pain

2430
02:34:25,215 --> 02:34:28,801
and vulnerable moments
between these guys.

2431
02:34:29,886 --> 02:34:35,141
I think these moments really show
the humanity behind the icons.

2432
02:34:35,850 --> 02:34:39,896
You think about Ice Cube, think about
Dr. Dre and MC Ren and Yella.

2433
02:34:39,979 --> 02:34:42,815
You think about the icons.

2434
02:34:42,899 --> 02:34:47,153
Sometimes you don't take the time
to think about the human beings.

2435
02:34:47,820 --> 02:34:52,242
This whole section of the movie
just shows you that

2436
02:34:53,785 --> 02:34:57,705
they have feelings,
contrary to popular belief.

2437
02:34:58,790 --> 02:35:02,168
And while- We all grow.
We all make mistakes.

2438
02:35:02,252 --> 02:35:07,131
They'll be the first to admit all the stuff
they did wasn't overly positive.

2439
02:35:07,215 --> 02:35:11,386
Some of it was, some of it wasn't,
but they grew up on wax.

2440
02:35:11,469 --> 02:35:12,845
You understand that they're people.

2441
02:35:14,055 --> 02:35:21,020
I think the cast really delivered
just a full range.

2442
02:35:21,604 --> 02:35:25,858
And they offered up something
that I think surprises people.

2443
02:35:25,942 --> 02:35:29,362
Because you feel like,
“I can identify with these guys.”

2444
02:35:30,238 --> 02:35:34,284
A lot of people going
into the theaters felt like,

2445
02:35:34,367 --> 02:35:36,244
“Yeah, I'm gonna watch the N.W.A. movie,

2446
02:35:36,327 --> 02:35:39,289
but I don't know if I can identify
with a gangster rapper.”

2447
02:35:39,372 --> 02:35:43,751
But in a strange way,
based on the reaction,

2448
02:35:43,835 --> 02:35:46,754
a lot of people did
and they do.

2449
02:35:46,838 --> 02:35:50,425
Again, I think
that's a testament to my cast

2450
02:35:50,508 --> 02:35:52,802
and their ability to perform.

2451
02:36:05,940 --> 02:36:11,696
I remember outside of Cedars-Sinai,
there were thousands of people.

2452
02:36:13,364 --> 02:36:17,994
A lot of people loved Eazy-E
and were really surprised when he passed.

2453
02:36:24,542 --> 02:36:28,504
This moment
didn't make it into the theatrical cut.

2454
02:36:29,672 --> 02:36:33,426
But I like it,
'cause there's this closure here.

2455
02:36:33,509 --> 02:36:38,598
You see Cube, who started off
as the teenager in the group.

2456
02:36:38,681 --> 02:36:42,727
Now he's a grown man
with a family.

2457
02:36:42,810 --> 02:36:44,979
The same family to this day.

2458
02:36:45,063 --> 02:36:47,148
His wife and his kids.

2459
02:36:49,233 --> 02:36:55,031
Eazy won't have that opportunity
to live out his life with his family.

2460
02:36:55,114 --> 02:36:56,741
I wanted to touch on that,

2461
02:36:56,824 --> 02:37:01,704
because it's sad
to know that he could have.

2462
02:37:03,998 --> 02:37:05,750
It's just a sad moment.

2463
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:18,513
We wrap up the movie
with the great smile.

2464
02:37:19,847 --> 02:37:22,558
I think this is one of the great images
of Jason, who plays Eazy.

2465
02:37:24,102 --> 02:37:28,731
You get a sense of the man
behind the music

2466
02:37:28,815 --> 02:37:30,942
and the man behind the glasses.

2467
02:37:31,025 --> 02:37:32,944
That smile just says it all.

2468
02:37:39,450 --> 02:37:44,122
Dre going to Death Row,
with the goons.

2469
02:37:44,205 --> 02:37:46,749
And the determination to say,

2470
02:37:46,833 --> 02:37:49,293
“You know what? Enough is enough.”

2471
02:37:50,545 --> 02:37:52,130
I'm out of Death Row.

2472
02:37:52,755 --> 02:37:55,758
I don't know how many people you know

2473
02:37:55,842 --> 02:37:59,595
that would walk away
from a successful company,

2474
02:37:59,679 --> 02:38:02,974
$50 million

2475
02:38:03,057 --> 02:38:06,644
and all of the artists
and all of the hard work.

2476
02:38:06,728 --> 02:38:10,940
But Dre just felt like,

2477
02:38:11,023 --> 02:38:14,902
“You know what?
There's another life for me.”

2478
02:38:14,986 --> 02:38:21,576
He had the courage to walk away
from all the material gain

2479
02:38:22,660 --> 02:38:28,332
and had enough faith in himself
to actually do something different.

2480
02:38:28,583 --> 02:38:32,128
When I talk to him, he says,
“I will always bet on myself.”

2481
02:38:34,172 --> 02:38:39,343
And that's inspiring.
It really is inspiring.

2482
02:38:39,427 --> 02:38:41,429
For a guy who comes from Compton,

2483
02:38:42,722 --> 02:38:44,974
who comes from poverty,

2484
02:38:46,225 --> 02:38:50,062
to make it in a capitalistic society,

2485
02:38:51,355 --> 02:38:55,443
on top of the world, at least financially-

2486
02:38:56,611 --> 02:38:58,362
He just went with his heart.

2487
02:38:59,614 --> 02:39:01,449
Now the guy's a billionaire.

2488
02:39:04,869 --> 02:39:06,704
I think it was a smart move.

2489
02:39:08,289 --> 02:39:11,834
People ask me,
“What do you want people to take away

2490
02:39:13,336 --> 02:39:15,755
from the experience of watching this movie?”

2491
02:39:15,838 --> 02:39:19,759
The truth is, I just want you to be inspired.

2492
02:39:20,843 --> 02:39:24,472
You can always change your reality.

2493
02:39:25,139 --> 02:39:27,600
You can come from nowhere.

2494
02:39:27,683 --> 02:39:30,061
You can come from less than nothing.

2495
02:39:30,144 --> 02:39:32,688
You can always create something better.

2496
02:39:33,773 --> 02:39:36,734
These guys are a living testament to that.

2497
02:39:38,653 --> 02:39:44,367
I want to thank my producers
Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Scott Bernstein,

2498
02:39:44,450 --> 02:39:47,161
Matt Alvarez, Tomica Woods.

2499
02:39:47,245 --> 02:39:51,415
They worked really, really hard on
providing me with what I needed

2500
02:39:51,499 --> 02:39:53,668
in order to make this movie great.

2501
02:39:55,586 --> 02:39:58,422
I want to give a shout-out to Chic Daniel,

2502
02:39:58,506 --> 02:40:02,677
our police consultant
and all-around good guy.

2503
02:40:02,760 --> 02:40:07,056
This guy connected us with the police.

2504
02:40:07,139 --> 02:40:13,271
They really had such great attitude
about helping us make this movie.

2505
02:40:14,438 --> 02:40:20,027
I want to thank DJ Yella, MC Ren,
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube

2506
02:40:20,111 --> 02:40:23,865
for allowing me to tell their story.

2507
02:40:23,948 --> 02:40:27,702
I definitely want to especially thank Eazy-E
and his family

2508
02:40:27,785 --> 02:40:30,079
for allowing us to tell this story.

2509
02:40:32,290 --> 02:40:34,208
I really want to thank my crew.

2510
02:40:34,292 --> 02:40:39,547
It's too many names to list,
but you couldn't ask for a better crew.

2511
02:40:39,630 --> 02:40:41,549
My crew was off the chain,

2512
02:40:41,632 --> 02:40:46,178
and I love you guys for helping me make
what I consider my best film.

2513
02:40:46,262 --> 02:40:48,264
Thank you so much.

2514
02:40:49,223 --> 02:40:50,600
Thanks for listening.
