to bear with me for a minute #

2975
02:42:07,717 --> 02:42:10,886
# While l talk
about the pages of my diary #

2976
02:42:10,971 --> 02:42:13,639
# Yeah
Listen up #

2977
02:42:13,723 --> 02:42:16,642
# Uhh, l remember
when l got started #

2978
02:42:16,726 --> 02:42:18,185
# My intention was to win #

2979
02:42:18,269 --> 02:42:20,062
# But a lot of shit changed
since then #

2980
02:42:20,146 --> 02:42:23,565
# Some more friends became enemies
in the quest of victory #

2981
02:42:23,650 --> 02:42:26,402
# But l made a vow
Never let this shit get to me #

2982
02:42:26,486 --> 02:42:29,989
# l let it pass, so l consider
that part of my history #

2983
02:42:30,073 --> 02:42:32,908
# And l'm strong
financially, physically #

2984
02:42:32,993 --> 02:42:35,661
# Mentally l'm
on a whole nother level #

2985
02:42:35,745 --> 02:42:38,330
# And don't forget
that l came from the ghetto #

2986
02:42:38,415 --> 02:42:40,916
# Sold a new house for my moms
That's special #

2987
02:42:41,001 --> 02:42:43,711
# l let you going shopping
till your feet get tired #

2988
02:42:43,795 --> 02:42:47,089
# Then a new Benz
just for you to ride in #

2989
02:42:47,173 --> 02:42:49,883
- # When l didn't have it, you provided #
- # You provided #

2990
02:42:49,968 --> 02:42:52,511
# Don't be surprised
that l built an enterprise #

2991
02:42:52,595 --> 02:42:56,515
# And my house got a view
of the city like a high-rise #

2992
02:42:56,599 --> 02:43:01,103
# l'm just talking to my diary #

2993
02:43:01,187 --> 02:43:03,897
# When l open up my book
l think about the world later #

2994
02:43:03,982 --> 02:43:06,859
# No ink in the pen
No lines on the paper #

2995
02:43:06,943 --> 02:43:12,531
# l'm just, l'm just
l'm just talking to my diary #

2996
02:43:12,615 --> 02:43:15,242
# Sometimes when l got
a lot of shit on my mind #

2997
02:43:15,326 --> 02:43:18,245
# l'm just starin' at the sky
You probably thinkin' l'm high #

2998
02:43:18,329 --> 02:43:23,959
# l'm just, l'm just
l'm just talking to my diary #

2999
02:43:24,044 --> 02:43:27,212
# Now puff, puff, pass that
A nigga having flashbacks #

3000
02:43:27,297 --> 02:43:29,465
# l remember
how it used to be #

3001
02:43:29,549 --> 02:43:32,760
# Now my money like NASDAQ
My checks you can cash that #

3002
02:43:32,844 --> 02:43:34,803
# l remember
how it used to be #

3003
02:43:34,888 --> 02:43:36,889
# l used to be
a starving artist #

3004
02:43:36,973 --> 02:43:38,766
# So l would never
starve an artist #

3005
02:43:38,850 --> 02:43:41,560
# This is my passion
lt's where my heart is #

3006
02:43:41,644 --> 02:43:44,563
# lt gets the hardest
when l think about the dearly departed #

3007
02:43:44,647 --> 02:43:46,315
# Like the nigga
l started with #

3008
02:43:46,399 --> 02:43:49,818
# l know Eazy can see me now
looking down through the clouds #

3009
02:43:49,903 --> 02:43:52,571
# And regardless,
l know my nigga still proud #

3010
02:43:52,655 --> 02:43:55,324
# lt's been a while since we spoke
but you still my folks #

3011
02:43:55,408 --> 02:43:57,576
# We used to sit back,
laugh and joke #

3012
02:43:57,660 --> 02:44:00,329
# Now, l remember when we
used to do all-nighters #

3013
02:44:00,413 --> 02:44:03,415
# You in the booth and Cube
in the corner writing #

3014
02:44:03,500 --> 02:44:06,126
# Where Ren at?
Shout out to my nigga Yella #

3015
02:44:06,211 --> 02:44:07,795
# Damn, l miss that #

3016
02:44:07,879 --> 02:44:10,422
# Shit, a nigga
having flashbacks #

3017
02:44:10,507 --> 02:44:12,758
# When l open up my book
l think about the world later #
