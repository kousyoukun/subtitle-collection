You should be a model.

326
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:07,413
- (WOMAN LAUGHING)
- Yeah, you look like a model.

Just sayin', you know.

00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,418
I look in your eyes and I see a Capricorn.

329

You're a Capricorn, right?

330
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:18,382
I mean, I can look at a girl
and I know their sign, you know?

331
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:20,676
It's just something I do.

Uh... Mmm-hmm.

333

DJ YELLA: I hope I'm not
disrespecting you, right?

334
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:27,558
- Uh-huh. Not at all.

Don't play none of that

I saw you talking to my lady, man.

346

Keep your motherfuckin' hands to yourself.

DJ YELLA: All right.

348

Man, why you always fuckin'

Why not?

As soon as I turn my back,
you do that shit anyway.

the only reason you up on that stage

I don't have some flashy office

754
00:37:02,673 --> 00:37:04,174
I don't know what I'm talking about?

755
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,803
I worked with Elton John.
I worked with Otis Redding.

756
00:37:07,845 --> 00:37:12,808
Let me see.
I worked with War. I worked with Styx.

757
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:16,979
- I worked with, uh...
- Have you worked with anybody this decade?

(CHUCKLES) Okay.

759
00:37:21,191 --> 00:37:23,861
Let me tell you what I see here, Eric.

760
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:29,700
A lot of raw talent, a lot of braggadocio.

761
00:37:29,992 --> 00:37:31,493
Bravado. Uh...

762
00:37:31,535 --> 00:37:33,662
But if you think anyone's
gonna talk to you,

763
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:36,081
you think anyone
is gonna let you in the building

764
00:37:36,165 --> 00:37:39,293
where somebody might listen to you or talk
to you, you think that's gonna happen?

765
00:37:39,376 --> 00:37:41,962
You're crazy, man. I'm sorry.

766
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:44,548
That is what I can do for you.

767
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:46,842
I can make you legit.

768
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:50,888
I can get you in that building.
And I will protect you.

769
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:54,892
I will block out all the noise
of this crazy fuckin' business

770
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:56,894
and we can build something big.

771
00:37:57,394 --> 00:38:00,856
But you gotta believe in me
the way that I believe in you.

772
00:38:01,398 --> 00:38:03,192
The way that I believe in this,

773
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:05,819
because you have a unique talent, Eric.

774
00:38:05,903 --> 00:38:07,071
Very special.

775
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,864
Don't fuck around.

776
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:12,618
But, you know what?

777
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:15,871
If you can't handle it,

778
00:38:15,913 --> 00:38:19,166
if it's too much fuckin' pressure
for you, then fine.

779
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:21,252

00:45:33,392 --> 00:45:35,269
- one hell of a show.
- (CHEERING)

932
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:37,605
Nice job.

933
00:45:37,688 --> 00:45:39,857
Very, very nice, gentlemen. Outstanding!

934
00:45:40,649 --> 00:45:44,069
You kicked ass, yeah.
You definitely did. You definitely did.

935
00:45:44,528 --> 00:45:48,699
Okay, this is Eazy-E and N.W.A, obviously.

936
00:45:48,908 --> 00:45:50,409
Guys, this is Bryan Turner.

937
00:45:50,993 --> 00:45:52,313
- How you doin', fellas?
- Ice Cube.

938
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:55,331
- Pleasure.
- Bryan runs Priority Records.

939
00:45:56,165 --> 00:45:57,875
And he wants to sign you.

940
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,543
BRYAN: Yeah, immediately.

941
00:46:00,085 --> 00:46:02,588
Fellas, I got to say, I loved the show.
All right?

942
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:06,383
What you did with that crowd out there,
I mean, I've never seen anything like that.

943
00:46:06,592 --> 00:46:09,762
So, I think, honestly,
if y'all wanted to, you guys

944
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:11,847
- would fit perfectly with our label.
- Yes.

945
00:46:11,889 --> 00:46:13,265
That'll work.

946
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:15,017
Nah, nah, nah, nah. No, it won't. Nah.

947
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:17,853
Well, hold on, man.
I mean, Priority Records.

948
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:20,112
I've never heard of it.
I mean, what you got?

949
00:46:20,189 --> 00:46:23,567
Like, is it Def Jam?
Like, the Beastie Boys? You know?

950
00:46:23,776 --> 00:46:26,570
Run DMC? You know what I'm saying?

951
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,073
Or is it more R&B?

952
00:46:29,156 --> 00:46:31,242
You know, Prince, Michael Jackson.

953
00:46:31,283 --> 00:46:33,118
- It's, uh, a little more...
- More that end of the spectrum.

954
00:46:33,202 --> 00:46:35,162
- More R&B as of right now, but...
- Yeah.

955
00:46:35,246 --> 00:46:37,248
Yeah, we represent nothing big,

956
00:46:37,373 --> 00:46:38,582
but mostly R&B.

957
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:39,959
DR. DRE: Who dat?

958
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:41,669
It's, uh, California Raisins.

959
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:43,295
Who?

960
00:46:43,379 --> 00:46:45,047
BRYAN: It's the California Raisins.

961
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,258
The raisins from the commercial singing

962
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:49,101
"I Heard it Through the
Grapevine" and shit?

963
00:46:49,134 --> 00:46:50,928
Yes, Cube, the little-ass raisins.

964
00:46:51,428 --> 00:46:53,138
- BRYAN: That would be the one.
- (ALL LAUGHING)

965
00:46:53,222 --> 00:46:55,307
JERRY: Hear it out.
Don't get ahead of yourselves, okay?

966
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:59,019
I was laughing, too,
I promise, then I started cashing checks.

967
00:46:59,603 --> 00:47:03,774
So, look, I gotta tell ya,
those little fuckers, they went gold last year.

968
00:47:04,441 --> 00:47:06,735
- Gold?
- Almost platinum. Yeah.

969
00:47:07,152 --> 00:47:09,947
What do you say, fellas?
You wanna go make a record?

970
00:47:13,117 --> 00:47:14,618
I mean...

971
00:47:14,702 --> 00:47:16,453
- Yeah!
- ALL: Yeah...

972
00:47:16,537 --> 00:47:17,788
(CLAMORING)

973
00:47:19,707 --> 00:47:21,792
- Thank you. Appreciate it.
- Good?

974
00:47:21,876 --> 00:47:24,295
He seriously dug it. He really dug it.

975
00:47:24,336 --> 00:47:25,921
- We did it, Jerry.
- He did.

976
00:47:25,963 --> 00:47:27,163
- Thank you, man.
- You did it.

977
00:47:31,886 --> 00:47:32,887
(CLAPPING)

978
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:36,891
A'ight, so, look, your rhymes ain't tight,
it ain't makin' the record.

979
00:47:36,974 --> 00:47:39,727
This ain't Lonzo's shit,
this the real deal. Ar'ight?

980
00:47:40,102 --> 00:47:42,146
So your shit better be dope. Who up?

981
00:47:42,563 --> 00:47:43,772
Ren up.

982

983
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,401

984
00:47:47,484 --> 00:47:49,069
All right. Let's see.

985
00:47:49,153 --> 00:47:50,905
Hey, Yella. Play that shit.

<i>Ruthless, plenty of that and much more</i>

<i>That you step and do your dance routine

Yeah, man!

- You feel that shit, right? Hey, check this out.
- (BASS LINE PLAYING)

1008
00:48:53,717 --> 00:48:54,885
Fuck it up.

1009
00:48:56,887 --> 00:48:58,055
Yeah.

1010
00:48:58,097 --> 00:49:00,683
That's what I'm talking about, man.
But you hear the difference, right?

1011
00:49:00,724 --> 00:49:02,726
Yeah, way better than the shit
I came up with.

1012
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:05,062
- I know.
- Fuck you.

1013
00:49:05,896 --> 00:49:08,399
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I thought you'd like to know

1014
00:49:08,732 --> 00:49:10,859
our deal with Priority Records is done.

1015
00:49:11,068 --> 00:49:13,571
- Yes! That's whassup, man!
- Money!

1016
00:49:13,654 --> 00:49:15,614
Contracts right here for you to sign.

1017
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:17,783
- Thank you, my good man.
- Music keep sounding like this,

1018
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:19,660
this album is gonna be incredible.

1019
00:49:19,743 --> 00:49:21,370
Well, you're welcome, Jerry.

1020
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,249
Very strong lyrics too, Cube. Very strong.

1021
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,084
- Appreciate that, Jerry.
- Mmm-hmm.

1022
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:28,836
So what's up with our contracts, though?

1023
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:32,449
They're getting done right now.
Lawyers are drawing 'em up.

1024
00:49:32,506 --> 00:49:34,842
Jerry on top of that,
but did you just switch all the straws?

1025
00:49:34,925 --> 00:49:37,845
Yo, Dre. There's something outside
you need to take care of.

1026
00:49:38,262 --> 00:49:39,972
Right now. Trust me.

1027
00:49:43,225 --> 00:49:45,269
- Serious.
- (MUSIC CONTINUES)

1028
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:47,479
Uh-oh. Really?

1029
00:49:48,272 --> 00:49:51,233
- We can split that.
- Cube. Right there, hush.

1030
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:55,404
- Not this time.
- You know what I got for you.

1031
00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:58,866
So let me get this straight.
You gonna do this right here, right now?

1032
00:49:59,074 --> 00:50:00,618
What am I supposed to do?

1033
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:02,870
We're sleeping in a twin bed
at your auntie's house.

1034
00:50:02,953 --> 00:50:04,663
We have a baby, Andre.

1035
00:50:04,747 --> 00:50:06,457
You expect me to wait
for what you doin' in there?

1036
00:50:06,624 --> 00:50:08,292
And you in the streets fuckin' around?

1037
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,127
- Are you crazy?
- What?

1038
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,670
I'm out here bustin' my fuckin' ass

1039
00:50:11,754 --> 00:50:14,006
day and fuckin' night
tryin' to create something.

1040
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:16,800
You gonna come up in here talkin' about
some fuckin' bitches? Are you crazy?

1041
00:50:16,884 --> 00:50:19,386
- You don't get it.
- No, you don't get it, Lavetta.

1042
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,512
Daddy!

1043
00:50:20,596 --> 00:50:22,014
It's all right, baby.

1044
00:50:22,097 --> 00:50:23,807
Chill out, man.

1045
00:50:27,478 --> 00:50:29,396
Tyra, it's gonna be okay. All right.

1046
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,023

- You cool?
- Fuck no, man. I'm far from cool.

1051
00:50:44,828 --> 00:50:46,997
- What happened, Dre? What she say?
- What'd you do?

1052
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:49,375
- (SIREN BLARING)

Oh, you working?

Yeah, I bet.

1061
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:10,229
- What we do?
- We'll find out in a minute what you did.

1062
00:51:10,312 --> 00:51:12,690
- What's this?
- Shut the fuck up.

1063
00:51:12,773 --> 00:51:15,442
- The fuck?
- Get your ass on the ground now.

1064
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:17,778
Get on the ground!

1065
00:51:18,028 --> 00:51:19,988
On the ground?
What am I supposed to do with this?

1066
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,240
Get on the ground.

1067
00:51:21,323 --> 00:51:23,158
What we do?

1068
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,202
Get down! Get on the ground, now!

1069
00:51:25,536 --> 00:51:27,746
Get your punk ass on the ground. Let's go.

1070
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:28,873
Get the fuck down.

1071
00:51:28,914 --> 00:51:30,791
Hands behind your back.
Interlock your fingers.

1072
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:33,085
- DR. DRE: This is fucked up.
- Interlock 'em!

1073
00:51:33,168 --> 00:51:35,629
The fuck you got us
on the ground like this for, officer?

1074
00:51:35,713 --> 00:51:38,048
For our protection.
There's seven of you and four of us.

1075

So sit tight and let us do our job.

What is going on out here?

1077
00:51:41,677 --> 00:51:43,220
Sir, can you stay right there, please?

1078
00:51:43,262 --> 00:51:45,139
We're trying to check these bangers,
make sure they're clean.

1079
00:51:45,222 --> 00:51:47,391
All right, I'm sorry,
these are not bangers, okay?

1080
00:51:47,725 --> 00:51:49,602
These, um... These are artists.

1081
00:51:50,185 --> 00:51:51,854
- Excuse me. Artists?
- Yeah.

1082
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:53,063
- Seriously?

Sign the contract

1684
01:20:14,807 --> 01:20:16,559
and all this money is yours.

1685
01:20:16,725 --> 01:20:19,186
That's my money anyway, Jerry.
I earned that money.

1686
01:20:19,603 --> 01:20:21,772
- And I wrote a lot of hit songs.
- Mmm-hmm.

1687
01:20:21,897 --> 01:20:23,774
We've been performing
on this tour for months.

1688
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:25,776
Sellin' out shows, sellin' records.

1689
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:28,070
- I know there's plenty of money.

Really? Jesus Christ.

1691
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:32,283
Give me my money, Jerry.

1692
01:20:32,324 --> 01:20:33,826
How the hell do you think this works?

1693
01:20:34,535 --> 01:20:37,621
How the hell do you think
all of this gets paid for?

1694
01:20:38,289 --> 01:20:40,791
The hotel rooms, the tour buses,

1695
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:44,169
security, the parties, all this shit.

1696
01:20:44,253 --> 01:20:46,463
How do you think it gets paid for?
You think it's free?

1697
01:20:46,505 --> 01:20:48,132
Why are you doing this now?

1698
01:20:48,465 --> 01:20:51,302
If we were so good, why didn't you give us
contracts in the beginning?

1699
01:20:51,468 --> 01:20:53,470
Because nothing is a sure thing, Cube.

1700
01:20:54,805 --> 01:20:57,808
Even a great talent can crash and burn.

1701
01:21:00,769 --> 01:21:03,063
Too much ego, too much excess,

1702
01:21:03,606 --> 01:21:05,149
too many expectations.

1703
01:21:07,443 --> 01:21:10,446
It tends to ruin things.
You ought to keep that in mind.

1704
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:20,998
This is Eric's company, right?

1705
01:21:25,294 --> 01:21:26,545
Bye, Jerry.

1706
01:21:27,087 --> 01:21:28,589
I'm out.

01:21:56,367 --> 01:21:57,451
BUS DRIVER: Here you go.

1711

DJ YELLA: Thank you, sir.

EAZY E: Hey, what up with D.O.C. and Suge?

1713
01:22:02,498 --> 01:22:05,584
DJ YELLA: I guess that dude
is gonna be managing him now.

1714
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,379
DJ YELLA: One day
you Bobby Brown's bodyguard,

1715
01:22:08,462 --> 01:22:10,339
and the next day, you reppin' talent.

MC REN: Come on, man.

1717
01:22:12,049 --> 01:22:13,849
I guess everybody
wanna get into the act, huh?

1718
01:22:13,884 --> 01:22:15,052
I guess so.

1719
01:22:15,177 --> 01:22:16,554
All right, man.

1720
01:22:20,599 --> 01:22:22,268
DJ YELLA: I know, right?

1721

JERRY: How you doin'? You good?
BUS DRIVER: Here you go.

1722
01:22:25,354 --> 01:22:27,356
I'm helping you out all I can.
You all right?

1723
01:22:27,815 --> 01:22:29,108
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1724
01:22:29,191 --> 01:22:31,277
- JERRY: What's going on?
- Just happy to be home.

JERRY: You hungry?

1726
01:22:33,153 --> 01:22:34,238
JERRY: Yeah?

1727
01:22:34,321 --> 01:22:35,906
I'll be there in a minute. All right?

1728
01:22:36,282 --> 01:22:37,533
Thanks, man.

1729
01:22:39,118 --> 01:22:40,578
- Thanks for everything, bruh.
- You bet!

1730
01:22:40,661 --> 01:22:42,413
DR. DRE: So, Cube.

1731
01:22:42,913 --> 01:22:44,248
We gonna keep
this momentum going or what?

1732
01:22:44,331 --> 01:22:45,958
Nah, man. Not like this.

1733
01:22:46,917 --> 01:22:49,587
I'd rather be broke than to get fucked.

1734
01:22:49,628 --> 01:22:51,505
I told you not to sign that shit, Dre.

1735
01:22:51,589 --> 01:22:54,174
Nigga, I got bills to pay.
And you know that.

1736
01:22:54,675 --> 01:22:57,678
And I gotta put some money
in my momma's hand after Tyree passed, man.

1737
01:22:58,053 --> 01:22:59,597
- I feel you.
- Right.

1738
01:22:59,847 --> 01:23:01,599
We gotta do what we gotta do.

1739
01:23:02,474 --> 01:23:04,476
They're gonna take care of you.
You their bread and butter.

- I missed you.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

- How you doing?
- I'm good.

1750
01:23:42,848 --> 01:23:44,183
- Good.
- Come on. Let's get home.

1751
01:23:44,266 --> 01:23:45,643
All right.

1752
01:23:46,393 --> 01:23:47,478
So you're leaving the group?

1753
01:23:47,519 --> 01:23:49,772
Yeah, I'm through with the bullshit.

1754
01:23:49,813 --> 01:23:53,192
Eazy put everything on Jerry,
Jerry put everything on Eazy.

1755
01:23:54,026 --> 01:23:55,986
It's a two-man show up there.
There ain't no fuckin' group.

1756
01:23:56,028 --> 01:23:59,406
I get that,
but I just want you to understand

1757
01:23:59,615 --> 01:24:02,576
that you are walking away
from a winning situation.

1758
01:24:03,494 --> 01:24:06,054
Now, how do you feel about this, Kim?
Is he making a big mistake?

1759
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,164
- A mistake?
- BRYAN: Yes.

1760
01:24:07,248 --> 01:24:08,624
I don't think so, okay.

1761
01:24:08,666 --> 01:24:11,168
After hearing all the stuff
that he went through, I would've left too.

1762
01:24:11,418 --> 01:24:14,171
Look, I want you to express yourself, Cube.

1763
01:24:14,255 --> 01:24:16,590
And I am your biggest fan.
I believe in you.

1764
01:24:16,674 --> 01:24:18,759
But I just want you to understand,

1765
01:24:18,842 --> 01:24:20,803
there's not a lot of
money in this solo play.

1766
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:22,346
Okay?

1767
01:24:22,596 --> 01:24:24,181
But if the first record hits,

1768
01:24:24,765 --> 01:24:26,485
I will make it up to you on the second one.

1769

Yeah.

Look at him.

1801
01:26:53,831 --> 01:26:55,751
You think he needs
any more motivation than that?

but that don't mean that he...

Yeah, ar'ight.

1806
01:27:03,674 --> 01:27:05,175
Here, sign some checks.

- Right now, Jerry?
- Yes, right now.

1808
01:27:07,678 --> 01:27:09,054
- You're gonna be out of your mind later.
- Come on.

1809
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:10,347
Do it now.

1810
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:12,683
The fact is,
Ren is as good a writer as Cube.

1811
01:27:12,766 --> 01:27:14,101
Maybe even better.

1812
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:15,519
We got everything covered.

1813
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:17,855
Just the last one. Okay?

1814
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,942
- We finished here, Jerry?
- We're finished.

1815
01:27:22,443 --> 01:27:25,487
Good. 'Cause I'm about to go fuck.

(INAUDIBLE)

1819
01:28:08,656 --> 01:28:10,407
Now I'm only telling you what you told me.

1820
01:28:10,574 --> 01:28:12,284
If <i>AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted</i> blew up,

1821
01:28:12,368 --> 01:28:14,245
you'd pay me the advance for the follow-up.

1822
01:28:14,411 --> 01:28:15,746
Now is that not what the fuck you said?

1823
01:28:15,788 --> 01:28:17,206
That is what I said.

1824
01:28:17,248 --> 01:28:19,166
But it is more complicated than that, Cube.

1825
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:20,251
Right, there are metrics...

1826
01:28:20,292 --> 01:28:21,335
Come on, Bryan!

1827
01:28:21,418 --> 01:28:23,963
I got a baby on the way
and a house I just paid for

1828
01:28:24,046 --> 01:28:25,798
off the strength of what you told me.

1829
01:28:25,965 --> 01:28:27,424
I mean, you gave me your word!

1830
01:28:27,466 --> 01:28:28,926
Cube, would you just calm down?

1831
01:28:29,009 --> 01:28:30,052
Calm down?

1832
01:28:30,094 --> 01:28:31,595
I am just trying to give you what you want.

1833
01:28:31,637 --> 01:28:33,305
You not. I been did the work...

1834
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:36,225
I gave you the product.
Give me my money, Bryan!

1835
01:28:37,142 --> 01:28:39,937
When a man does the job,
he's supposed to get paid,

Jerry, you gotta relax. Ar'ight?

2017

Niggas don't even know what
anti-Semitic means anyway.

01:37:33,929 --> 01:37:34,930
It's just a fucking battle rap.

He calls it political?
This is ignorant shit!

Now the whole world is gonna know.

I'm gonna make sure of that. Okay?

2026
01:37:50,654 --> 01:37:53,407

I don't know about all that.

2033
01:38:13,677 --> 01:38:17,348
Fine, you do that.
You call Dre, and you guys go do that.

2034
01:38:17,514 --> 01:38:18,807
Do something!

I had my people look at your contracts.

2089
01:42:01,363 --> 01:42:05,367
When you talked to me on the phone, man,
you sounded pretty worked up.

2090
01:42:09,246 --> 01:42:11,373
Yeah, I know you don't
like hearing this shit.

2091
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:16,503
It's about Jerry.
We gotta get rid of that motherfucker, E.

2092
01:42:18,047 --> 01:42:20,132
That's really why you came here?

2093
01:42:20,925 --> 01:42:23,510
I thought all this shit
was in the past, Dre.

2094
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:29,600
I found some real shit, man. And the shit's
been happening since the beginning.

2095
01:42:29,934 --> 01:42:32,686
I had some people look into this.
I ain't been gettin' my fair share.

2096
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:34,772
Do you even know why you rich, though?

2097
01:42:35,272 --> 01:42:36,941
Do you know why you got
a big-ass house and you

2098
01:42:37,024 --> 01:42:38,943
ain't sleepin' on your
auntie's couch no more?

2099
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:41,695
Because Jerry made that possible for us.

2100
01:42:41,862 --> 01:42:44,782
He kicked down the door
for that shit to happen. For us!

2101
01:42:44,949 --> 01:42:46,951
And you just gonna turn your back on him?
What, you Cube now?

2102
01:42:47,034 --> 01:42:48,577
Cube was right, fool!

2103
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:53,624

and you'll see what the fuck I'm talking about.

2104
01:42:54,792 --> 01:42:58,170
And forget about Jerry, man!
You keep talking about Jerry this, Jerry that.

2105
01:42:58,254 --> 01:43:01,715
We didn't make it because of Jerry,
we made it because our shit is dope!

2106
01:43:03,717 --> 01:43:05,427
And we can keep going, E.

2107
01:43:05,469 --> 01:43:09,682
We can own the goddamn world,
but we just can't be fucking with him no more.

2108
01:43:11,934 --> 01:43:14,478
Man, we started this N.W.A shit.

2109
01:43:17,314 --> 01:43:18,941
I just want it to be right.

2110
01:43:19,775 --> 01:43:21,652
And this what you think right?

2111
01:43:22,695 --> 01:43:25,364
Turnin' your back on somebody
after all he done for us.

2112
01:43:26,073 --> 01:43:28,033
You mean all he done for you.

2113
01:43:29,326 --> 01:43:30,411
Right?

2114
01:43:32,371 --> 01:43:33,455
Look at me.

2115
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:37,293
Look at me.

2116
01:43:42,006 --> 01:43:43,340
When Tyree died,

2117
01:43:46,093 --> 01:43:48,262
you said we was always gonna be brothers.

2118
01:43:50,306 --> 01:43:52,433
I guess you forgot about that.

2119
01:43:55,519 --> 01:43:57,897
I'mma start my own company
with Suge Knight, E.

2120
01:44:12,036 --> 01:44:14,121
Thought we were brothers, man.

2121
01:44:41,815 --> 01:44:43,025

This shit sound good.

2124
01:44:54,036 --> 01:44:58,541
Yeah. None of it means anything
while I'm under contract with Ruthless.

2125
01:44:59,083 --> 01:45:01,043
I told you about that.

2126
01:45:01,210 --> 01:45:03,671

2137
01:45:26,819 --> 01:45:27,903
Yeah, yeah.

2138
01:45:27,987 --> 01:45:30,447
So, look, I listened to your demo.

2139
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:32,575

01:55:03,687 --> 01:55:04,897
<i>Perfection is perfected...</i>

2293
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:06,607
JOURNALIST: I want to thank you
for having us here.

2294
01:55:06,690 --> 01:55:09,210
- ICE CUBE: Of course.
- Very generous for you to give your time

2295
01:55:09,276 --> 01:55:11,612
with everything that's going on right now.

2296
01:55:11,695 --> 01:55:12,988
Not a problem.

2297
01:55:13,030 --> 01:55:14,573
Now if I may,

2298
01:55:15,866 --> 01:55:17,201
are you anti-Semitic?

2299
01:55:18,911 --> 01:55:20,951
Now, I thought
this was about the Rodney King trial.

2300
01:55:21,205 --> 01:55:23,040
Well, the JDL recently got involved

2301
01:55:23,123 --> 01:55:26,001
citing the lyrics about
your former manager Jerry Heller.

2302
01:55:26,043 --> 01:55:29,588
I'm not anti-Semitic.
I'm anti-Jerry Heller.

2303
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:30,881
Let me ask you something.

2304
01:55:30,965 --> 01:55:34,635
Do the JDL condone Jerry's behavior
when it comes to my situation?

2305
01:55:34,718 --> 01:55:37,471
Him trying to get me to sign a contract
without legal representation?

2306
01:55:38,138 --> 01:55:39,223
I have no idea.

2307
01:55:39,265 --> 01:55:40,724
I didn't think you did.

2308
01:55:40,766 --> 01:55:43,686
But when you got that for me,
we can continue on this topic.

2309
01:55:43,727 --> 01:55:48,899
Until then, I'm here to talk about the
beating of an unarmed motorist, Rodney King.

2310
01:55:48,983 --> 01:55:54,238
And four guilty LAPD officers
who seem to be Daryl Gates' standard issue.

2311
01:55:55,614 --> 01:55:57,741
It's also the LAPD and the FBI

2312
01:55:57,783 --> 01:56:00,828
who feel that your negative portrayal
of police condones violence.

2313
01:56:00,911 --> 01:56:03,831
"Fuck Tha Police" is just a warning,
that's it.

2314
01:56:03,914 --> 01:56:07,251
You can't treat people like that
and expect 'em not to rise up.

2315
01:56:07,585 --> 01:56:09,545
I'm a journalist just like you.

2316
01:56:09,587 --> 01:56:11,505
Reporting what's goin' on in the hood.

2317
01:56:11,589 --> 01:56:14,592
The only thing that's different
is that I'm brutally honest.

2318
01:56:17,052 --> 01:56:19,430
What's your relationship
with the Nation of Islam?

2319
01:56:20,431 --> 01:56:21,932
ICE CUBE: They my brothers.

2320
01:56:21,974 --> 01:56:24,101
You know what?
That question right there proves to me

2321
01:56:24,143 --> 01:56:26,979
what kind of a unprepared
sandbag reporter you are.

2322
01:56:27,438 --> 01:56:29,273
You talkin' to me
like I'm some elected official.

2323
01:56:29,315 --> 01:56:31,400
Like I'm running for office.

2324
01:56:31,442 --> 01:56:33,319
But I get it, that's your job.

2325
01:56:33,402 --> 01:56:35,821
Bigger the story,
the bigger the check in your field of work.

2326
01:56:36,363 --> 01:56:38,963
It's not your fault, I shouldn't blame you.
What's your name, man?

2327
01:56:40,034 --> 01:56:41,118
Brian.

2328
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:44,163
Eat a dick, Brian.
Get the fuck out my house. Y'all done here.

2329
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:46,457
Can we cut, please?

2330
01:57:57,903 --> 01:58:00,197
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

2331
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:01,448
You look like you ready to go.

2332
01:58:01,532 --> 01:58:04,702
Yeah. I'm just waiting on my friend.
I should've drove.

2333
01:58:04,785 --> 01:58:06,036
You're not havin' a good time?

2334
01:58:06,078 --> 01:58:08,289
No! No. I had a really good time,

2335
01:58:08,372 --> 01:58:11,041
but now it's starting to get a little wild.

2336
01:58:11,375 --> 01:58:12,376
Yeah.

2337
01:58:12,459 --> 01:58:14,712
We've been known to get crazy
from time to time.

2338
01:58:14,795 --> 01:58:15,796
(CHUCKLES)

2339
01:58:16,839 --> 01:58:17,840
I'm Andre.

2340
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:19,884
I'm Nicole.

2341
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:23,721
Come on, man. Lighten up.

2342
01:58:25,306 --> 01:58:28,392
We're about to get back in the game.
Big time.

2343
01:58:28,434 --> 01:58:29,852
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2344
01:58:30,603 --> 01:58:31,604
How do you figure?

2345
01:58:32,605 --> 01:58:36,358
Are you trying to piss me off?
Come on. God almighty.

2346
01:58:36,567 --> 01:58:38,736
Did you forget about Ren's new album?

2347
01:58:38,819 --> 01:58:42,573
Or did you forget about the fact
that you are working on something

2348
01:58:42,615 --> 01:58:45,659
I think is gonna be bigger
than anything N.W.A ever did.

2349
01:58:45,743 --> 01:58:47,411
All I know... Mmm!

2350
01:58:49,121 --> 01:58:51,165
Fucking Cube out here,

2351
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:54,793
- doing it big. Making movies and shit.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2352
01:58:54,877 --> 01:58:57,213
Then I keep hearing about
this album Dre about to drop.

2353
01:58:57,254 --> 01:59:00,132
Dre is a fucking producer, Eric.

2354
01:59:00,216 --> 01:59:02,218
Producers don't rap.

2355
01:59:02,259 --> 01:59:05,262
We have him under contract.
He can't do anything.

2356
01:59:05,554 --> 01:59:06,764
Cheer up.

2357
01:59:07,514 --> 01:59:09,516
Eat, drink and be merry.

2358
01:59:09,892 --> 01:59:10,976
- Suge.
- Hey.

2359
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:12,895
- How you doin'?
- All right.

2360
01:59:12,937 --> 01:59:15,397
Jimmy Iovine, Interscope Records.
Nice to meet you.

2361
01:59:15,439 --> 01:59:16,440
You, too.

2362
01:59:16,523 --> 01:59:19,401
JIMMY: So, what do I call you?
Dre? Dr. Dre? Doc?

2363
01:59:19,443 --> 01:59:20,527
(CHUCKLES)

2364
01:59:20,611 --> 01:59:22,488
Nah, Dre is cool. Go ahead, have a seat.

2365
01:59:22,571 --> 01:59:23,572
All right.

2366
01:59:23,614 --> 01:59:24,657
- It's good.
- Yeah.

2367
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:26,075
So what do you got today?

2368
01:59:26,116 --> 01:59:27,117
DR. DRE: Um...

2369
01:59:27,952 --> 01:59:29,411
Well, you know...

2370
01:59:29,453 --> 01:59:33,749
I heard John McClain gave you my album.
What'd you think?

2371
01:59:34,124 --> 01:59:35,334
I think it was great.

2372
01:59:37,545 --> 01:59:40,965
So, you're the artist on the record.
Who produced it?

2373
01:59:42,132 --> 01:59:43,551
I did.

2374
01:59:43,634 --> 01:59:45,553
Okay. And who mixed it?

2375
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:48,180
(CHUCKLES) Come on, man. I did.

2376
01:59:49,515 --> 01:59:50,516
Huh.

2377
01:59:51,809 --> 01:59:52,810
Listen, um...

2378
01:59:53,227 --> 01:59:54,812
I don't know anything about hip-hop,

2379
01:59:54,979 --> 01:59:56,981
but I know that this is special.

2380
01:59:57,648 --> 01:59:58,816
Seriously.

2381
01:59:59,817 --> 02:00:00,818
Thank you.

2382
02:00:01,735 --> 02:00:03,695
SUGE: Hey, look, we'd love
to bring in Interscope,

2383
02:00:04,029 --> 02:00:05,531
but there's a little problem.

2384
02:00:05,906 --> 02:00:06,991
What's the problem?

SUGE: Ruthless, lawsuits,

2386

and contracts.

2387
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:13,831
How about this?

2388
02:00:14,415 --> 02:00:16,417
You give me three weeks
and I don't wanna hear any bullshit

2389
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,419
about you shopping this
anywhere around town.

2390
02:00:18,794 --> 02:00:20,254
If you do that...

2391
02:00:21,672 --> 02:00:24,425
I believe I can solve your problem
with the contract.

You parked in my
motherfuckin' spot or what?

2398
02:00:40,107 --> 02:00:41,734
- I didn't know, man.

And park my car.

02:19:49,298 --> 02:19:50,716
Now you do.

2762
02:19:52,843 --> 02:19:55,512
You know Dre and Cube
tried to warn me about this.

2763
02:19:58,182 --> 02:20:00,684
I've been fuckin' up for a long time.

2764
02:20:05,189 --> 02:20:06,565
Don't. Don't.

2765
02:20:06,649 --> 02:20:08,651
Real long time.

2766
02:20:12,696 --> 02:20:13,864
Shit.

2767
02:20:31,674 --> 02:20:32,883
JERRY: Hey, man.

2768
02:20:36,887 --> 02:20:40,307
Where you been?
I've been calling you all day.

2769
02:20:42,685 --> 02:20:44,770
Sit down, Jerry.

2770
02:20:45,479 --> 02:20:46,480
(SCOFFS)

2771
02:20:48,566 --> 02:20:51,151
What is this all about? The groupie?

2772
02:20:51,735 --> 02:20:53,779
The executive assistant?

2773
02:20:55,239 --> 02:20:57,366
She even go to college?

2774
02:20:57,408 --> 02:21:00,411
Man, you're so much fuckin'
smarter than this.

2775
02:21:00,452 --> 02:21:02,121
Sit down, Jerry.

2776
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:25,269
This ain't about Tomica, Jerry.

2777
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:27,855
It's about you.

2778
02:21:27,938 --> 02:21:30,065
And you can stop acting
like you ain't never done nothing wrong.

2779
02:21:30,107 --> 02:21:33,360
You know what, man?
I know that you're upset. I understand.

2780
02:21:35,112 --> 02:21:39,283
But I'm asking you,
I'm advising you, take a breath, okay?

2781
02:21:39,366 --> 02:21:40,951
I'm gonna look at the paperwork, Eric.

2782
02:21:41,035 --> 02:21:44,538
- You can stop giving me advice as of now.
- It's fucked up.

2783
02:21:46,207 --> 02:21:47,458
Here's what's about to happen.

2784
02:21:47,541 --> 02:21:49,543
I'mma get N.W.A back together,

2785
02:21:50,127 --> 02:21:52,463
and you ain't gonna have
nothing to do with it this time.

2786
02:21:54,590 --> 02:21:56,467
How the fuck can you even say
something like that?

2787
02:21:56,550 --> 02:21:59,011
What the fuck is going on with you, man?

2788
02:21:59,845 --> 02:22:01,513
I know what's good for you,

2789
02:22:01,597 --> 02:22:03,515
I know what's good for Ruthless...

2790
02:22:03,599 --> 02:22:07,436
And we have worked up a trust
after years of hard work,

2791
02:22:07,478 --> 02:22:09,271
and that trust is our foundation, Eric.

2792
02:22:09,313 --> 02:22:10,673
- I don't give a shit.
- (COUGHING)

2793
02:22:11,315 --> 02:22:12,608
Eric?

2794
02:22:15,444 --> 02:22:18,030
You look lousy, man. Are you okay?

2795
02:22:19,531 --> 02:22:20,699
Trust?

2796
02:22:21,825 --> 02:22:23,786
Trust is a motherfucker.

2797
02:22:25,204 --> 02:22:26,914
Is it?

2798
02:22:26,997 --> 02:22:28,624
Let me ask you something.

2799
02:22:29,625 --> 02:22:32,002
Eric, if what I'm doing is so illegal,

2800
02:22:32,086 --> 02:22:33,286
how come I've never been sued?

2801
02:22:34,296 --> 02:22:35,839
If I'm such a fuckin' thief,

2802
02:22:35,881 --> 02:22:38,008
such a liar, such a motherfucker,

2803
02:22:38,050 --> 02:22:40,302
how come nobody's ever come to collect?

2804
02:22:40,344 --> 02:22:44,139
Because this is business
and this is how it works.

2805
02:22:44,181 --> 02:22:46,517
And it's not always pretty. No.

2806
02:22:46,559 --> 02:22:47,893
Do I cover my own ass?

2807
02:22:47,977 --> 02:22:50,229
Do I cover my own end? Absolutely.

2808
02:22:50,312 --> 02:22:52,356
But don't you dare fuckin' tell me

2809
02:22:52,439 --> 02:22:53,816
that I have not taken care of you.

2810
02:22:54,400 --> 02:22:58,988
Don't you fuckin' tell me
that I have not had your back from day one!

2811
02:22:59,029 --> 02:23:00,698
Day one!

2812
02:23:05,286 --> 02:23:07,121
Is this taking care of me?

2813
02:23:07,997 --> 02:23:09,498
Are you fucking kidding me?

2814
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:11,260
It's taking care of the
whole fucking thing.

2815
02:23:11,292 --> 02:23:13,002
It's business!

2816
02:23:13,043 --> 02:23:14,420
And this is how it works.

2817
02:23:14,545 --> 02:23:17,840
Have I covered my end?
Do I cover my ass? Absolutely.

2818
02:23:17,882 --> 02:23:19,800
But don't you dare fuckin' tell me

2819
02:23:19,884 --> 02:23:21,760
that I have not taken care of you.

2820
02:23:24,263 --> 02:23:26,098
This business, too?

2821
02:23:26,181 --> 02:23:27,391
Yes! This is business.

2822
02:23:27,474 --> 02:23:29,226
This is how fucked up it can get.

2823
02:23:29,310 --> 02:23:32,521
But I didn't start this.
I didn't fuck it up.

2824
02:23:32,563 --> 02:23:33,856
You did!

2825
02:23:35,691 --> 02:23:36,775
No.

2826
02:23:38,861 --> 02:23:40,112
You did.

2827
02:23:40,571 --> 02:23:41,572
(SCOFFS)

2828
02:23:42,031 --> 02:23:43,532
You fired, Jerry.

2829
02:23:43,657 --> 02:23:45,075
Oh, for Christ...

2830
02:23:45,159 --> 02:23:46,911
Eric, this is not how we do things.

2831
02:23:46,952 --> 02:23:48,287
This is not you.

2832
02:23:48,370 --> 02:23:49,747
This is not you.

2833
02:23:49,830 --> 02:23:50,831
Eric!

2834
02:23:52,208 --> 02:23:53,751
This is an important company.

2835
02:23:53,834 --> 02:23:56,086
Eric, I'm not gonna let you fuck this up.

2836
02:23:56,754 --> 02:23:57,796
Eric?

2837
02:23:58,881 --> 02:24:00,007
Oh, for Christ's sake!

2838
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:01,508
Eric!

2839
02:24:10,893 --> 02:24:12,436
(LINE RINGING)

2840
02:24:13,270 --> 02:24:14,813
DR. DRE: <i>Yeah, hello?</i>

2841
02:24:14,939 --> 02:24:16,690
Wuddup, Dre?

<i>Just felt like calling.</i>

02:24:21,946 --> 02:24:23,781
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

2846
02:24:25,282 --> 02:24:26,450
What's up?

2847
02:24:26,492 --> 02:24:28,911
<i>I mean, you know me, man. Doing my thing.</i>

2848

Killin' all this pussy.
(CHUCKLES)

2849
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:33,624
How about you?

2850
02:24:33,666 --> 02:24:34,917
<i>You know, man.</i>

2851
02:24:34,959 --> 02:24:37,127
I'm just making tracks. Doing my thing.

2852
02:24:37,169 --> 02:24:40,339
Yeah, that Snoop joint you did was crazy.
That was dope.

2853
02:24:40,422 --> 02:24:43,926
Yeah? Thanks, E. Good looking out, man.

2854
02:24:48,973 --> 02:24:50,641
Look, Dre, I know you be busy,

2855
02:24:52,851 --> 02:24:54,144
but I talked to Cube and we were talking

2856
02:24:54,186 --> 02:24:57,356
about some possibilities.

2857
02:24:58,816 --> 02:25:01,193
Possibilities? Okay.

2858
02:25:01,318 --> 02:25:02,319
<i>Yeah, like,</i>

2859
02:25:02,403 --> 02:25:04,989
without Jerry Heller
type of fucking possibilities.

2860
02:25:05,072 --> 02:25:06,073
<i>Really?</i>

2861
02:25:06,699 --> 02:25:07,783
Well, it's about time.

2862
02:25:07,825 --> 02:25:10,828
Man, I mean, I know shit kinda went crazy.

2863
02:25:12,246 --> 02:25:16,959
You know, the money
kinda had everybody divided, man,

2864
02:25:17,501 --> 02:25:19,378
but I really wish it didn't.

2865
02:25:26,135 --> 02:25:29,680
To be honest, man,
I'm not proud of all the shit I did either.

2866
02:25:35,311 --> 02:25:36,437
So, whatchu think, man?

2867
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:39,356
You think we could get together or what?
Whatchu think?

2868
02:25:43,652 --> 02:25:44,904
Yeah, man.

Yeah, that sound good.

<i>I'mma let you know when we can get back
into the studio, you know?</i>

2872
02:25:54,371 --> 02:25:58,083
Lay down some tracks like the old days.

2873
02:25:59,793 --> 02:26:01,337
Fair enough.

2874

That's what I'm talking about.

You know you don't play no instruments.

2899
02:27:27,381 --> 02:27:29,216
You gonna play it?

Wait... Ain't you gonna say something?

What is it? A respiratory infection?

2914
02:28:21,435 --> 02:28:22,561
Pneumonia? What?

2915
02:28:22,645 --> 02:28:25,189
Yes, well, um, it is those things,

and more, I'm afraid.

I'm sorry, Mr. Wright,
but you've tested positive for HIV.

Get the fuck outta here.

What?

2921
02:28:40,287 --> 02:28:41,705
A normal T-cell count

2922
02:28:41,747 --> 02:28:44,208
is anywhere between 500 and 1,500.

2923
02:28:44,250 --> 02:28:46,293
Right now, your T-cell count is 14.

2924
02:28:51,340 --> 02:28:52,841
But I ain't no faggot.

2925
02:28:52,883 --> 02:28:54,051
DOCTOR: Mr. Wright, actually,

2926
02:28:54,134 --> 02:28:56,679
the virus can be transmitted
in quite a few ways,

2927
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:59,848
including unprotected heterosexual sex.

2928
02:29:05,229 --> 02:29:08,774
That's wrong.
You got to test that over. Test that again!

2929
02:29:08,857 --> 02:29:10,276
We've run the test five times

2930
02:29:10,359 --> 02:29:13,070
with five different samples
and the result remains the same.

EAZY E: Tomica.

2933
02:29:18,909 --> 02:29:21,120
But she's pregnant, Doc. What's this mean?

2934
02:29:21,203 --> 02:29:24,373
It doesn't necessarily mean
that she's contracted the virus,

2935
02:29:24,415 --> 02:29:26,917
but we have to test her to be sure.

2936

What am I supposed to do?

2940
02:29:38,262 --> 02:29:40,764
Mr. Wright, you need to understand

2941
02:29:41,557 --> 02:29:43,100
that you are very, very sick.

2942
02:29:43,142 --> 02:29:46,437

Don't tell me that.

02:39:10,876 --> 02:39:12,711
Aftermath.

3076
02:39:16,257 --> 02:39:17,925
DR. DRE: <i>You are now about to witness</i>

3077
02:39:18,008 --> 02:39:19,843
<i>the strength of street knowledge.</i>

3078
02:39:19,927 --> 02:39:22,012
(MUSIC PLAYING)

3079
02:39:24,723 --> 02:39:27,017
<i>It's just, like,
they try to hide what's goin' on</i>

3080
02:39:27,101 --> 02:39:28,644
<i>and we tell it like it is, you know?</i>

3081
02:39:34,024 --> 02:39:35,526
<i>You know it's gotta be hard,</i>

3082
02:39:35,568 --> 02:39:37,611
<i>'cause if it ain't hard, it's weak.</i>

3083
02:39:43,284 --> 02:39:44,493
<i>MC Ren in the house.</i>

3084
02:39:44,535 --> 02:39:45,578
<i>When you making a record,</i>

3085
02:39:45,661 --> 02:39:46,704
<i>you gotta have some hype lyrics.</i>

3086
02:39:46,745 --> 02:39:48,105
<i>And you got that, it's gonna sell.</i>

3087
02:39:52,585 --> 02:39:55,045
Eazy-E probably was one of the nicest
people you ever would have known.

3088
02:39:55,087 --> 02:39:57,256
<i>Not as Eazy, but as Eric Wright.</i>

3089
02:40:02,386 --> 02:40:04,430
DR. DRE: <i>We make our records based on</i>

3090
02:40:04,513 --> 02:40:07,224
<i>stuff that's happening where we live.</i>

3091
02:40:07,266 --> 02:40:09,852
<i>And if people out there
that don't like it, fuck 'em.</i>

3092
02:40:14,106 --> 02:40:17,151
Dre and Eazy, they had already
been selling it as cassette tapes.

3093
02:40:17,234 --> 02:40:18,319
<i>And they just blew up.</i>

3094
02:40:18,402 --> 02:40:21,238
Eazy and Dr. Dre Wild and Wet Pool Party.

3095
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:23,073
<i>This is what it's all about!</i>

3096
02:40:23,157 --> 02:40:25,075
<i>We wanted to invite you
to the President's luncheon.</i>

3097
02:40:25,117 --> 02:40:27,703
<i>I said if I go down there,
this'll start some shit.</i>

3098
02:40:29,997 --> 02:40:33,083
KENDRICK: <i>When I think of N.W.A,
they weren't really music to me.</i>

3099
02:40:33,167 --> 02:40:35,085
It was more like a real lifestyle.

3100
02:40:35,169 --> 02:40:36,849
<i>Brothers from my neighborhood made it out.</i>

3101
02:40:41,592 --> 02:40:44,178
- You got the dopest album out this year.
- Thanks, man.

3102
02:40:44,261 --> 02:40:45,721
<i>More than happy to get my career</i>

3103
02:40:45,763 --> 02:40:47,264
<i>going like I want it to go.</i>

3104
02:40:47,306 --> 02:40:48,349
BOTH: Damn!

3105
02:40:53,187 --> 02:40:55,439
<i>You do not know
how long I waited to get in his booth</i>

3106
02:40:55,522 --> 02:40:58,025
<i>and to have Dre out there goin',
"You ready?"</i>

3107
02:40:58,108 --> 02:41:00,468
<i>I waited all my life for that,
since</i> Straight Outta Compton.

3108
02:41:01,111 --> 02:41:02,571
Dre's direction was helping me

3109
02:41:02,613 --> 02:41:04,448
become a strong lyricist, which I am now.

3110
02:41:09,787 --> 02:41:10,955
EMINEM: <i>Dre has taught me a lot.</i>

3111
02:41:10,996 --> 02:41:13,249
<i>Not just rap-wise, but business-wise,</i>

3112
02:41:13,290 --> 02:41:14,458
<i>you know what I'm sayin'?</i>

3113
02:41:14,542 --> 02:41:16,710
50 CENT: <i>You'd have to even credit
both Eminem's and my success'</i>

3114
02:41:16,794 --> 02:41:17,878
to Dr. Dre.

3115
02:41:19,880 --> 02:41:21,298
MAN: <i>Apple's purchase of Beats</i>

3116
02:41:21,382 --> 02:41:23,676
<i>will be the biggest deal in its history.</i>

3117
02:41:23,759 --> 02:41:25,261
ICE CUBE: <i>Our music was like our weapon.</i>

3118
02:41:25,302 --> 02:41:26,887
DR. DRE: <i>We let people know that it's okay</i>

3119
02:41:26,971 --> 02:41:28,471
