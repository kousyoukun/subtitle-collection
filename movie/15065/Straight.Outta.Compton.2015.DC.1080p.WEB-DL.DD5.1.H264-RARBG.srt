Do you even care how it makes me look?

86
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,040
Called in favors to get
your thoughtless ass

88
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,088
Look, I'm sorry, Ma. I just...

89
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,383
I got so caught up in this DJ stuff,
I forgot.

90
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,093
You have a child, Andre.

91
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,430
Spinnin' records ain't paying
none of the bills around here.

92
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,557
Whatchu talkin' about? I get paid.

93
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,269
$50. So that makes you rich?

94
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,021
It's a start. Damn!

95
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,397
Why you riding me so hard?

96
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,567
I'm not riding you, baby.
I'm trying to make you understand.

97
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,944
And you know how I run my house.

98
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,198
Now you gonna have to go to school
or you gonna have to go to work.

99
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,200
Now I don't even care if you are a janitor.

100
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,534
I don't care what the hell you do...

101
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,870
Long as I own the company. I know, I know.

102
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,705
But you don't own the company.

103
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,290
- Lonzo does.
- Okay.

104
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,210
You think we're done here?

105
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,337
- Yeah, I mean, you keep...
- You got something to say to me?

106
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,631
You don't care what I'm fightin' for, okay?

107
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,550
I already know what
I want to do with my life

108
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,719
and it definitely ain't
sitting in some cubicle,

109
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,888
taking orders on a bullshit-ass job.

110
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,139
Shut up!

111
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,271
People used to tell me
I was too young when I had you.

112
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,482
Said I wouldn't be shit.

113
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,942
Said you wouldn't be shit.

114
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,570
Now, I worked my ass off to get us here,

115
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,657
and I refuse to let you throw it all away.

116
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,847
Hey, I grabbed some of your stuff.

117
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,266
Good lookin' out, T.

118
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,314
When you comin' back?

119
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,984
Man, I don't even know.

120
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,445
Got a lotta things to figure out.

121
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,281
Can I come with you?

122
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,033
Really?

123
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,035
You've been crying this whole time
about us sharing a room.

124
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,620
And now you wanna come with me.

125
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,663
Man, get out of here.

126
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,248
You know Mom. She just...

127
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,500
She just want the best for you.

128
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,212
Hey, I know that, T.

129
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,798
But check this out,
I want the best for me too.

130
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,383

Don't even worry about it.

135
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,645
For real?

136
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,564
- You gotta get me in Miami.
- Yeah, man.

137
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,400
Don't play, man. Get me somewhere.

138
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,402
Hey, I'll call you later.

139
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,364
For now, stay your little
ass outta trouble.

140
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:34,908
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,743
Hey, nah. For real.

142
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,121

The flyest one you know, nigga.

This nigga. Okay. I'll see you.

149
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,657
I wish
somebody would try me though.

150
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,409
That's all I'm saying. You feel me?

151
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,578

00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,621
What's going on?

166
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,789
Shut the fuck up, blood.

167
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,167
Y'all niggas ready to die today?

168
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,378
Don't get quiet now.

169
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,047
All that shit
y'all was throwin' up out the window?

170
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,466
What's up with it, huh?

171
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,717
You didn't think we saw that, huh?

172
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,344
Let me see how you do that shit again.
Let me see.

173
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,846
I was just playin', man, I swear.
I was only playin', man.

174
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,516
You think niggas out here are playin'? Huh?

175
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,892
Niggas die every day.

176
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,937
I kill Crips for breakfast.

177
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,774
Don't you ever put your motherfucking hands
up on no school bus, nigga.

178
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,067
You understand me?

179
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,360
- Yeah.
- Huh?

180
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,486
Yeah.

181
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,990
Y'all motherfuckers need
to gang bang them books

182
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,410
instead of tryin' to be
somethin' y'all ain't.

183
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,578
Shit, you never know.

184
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,001
'Cause I might be the one
to kill your motherfucking ass.

185
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,462
Remember me.

186
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:38,008
O.G. Two Tone, Crenshaw Mafia, blood.

187
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,881
Yo, Dre and Jinx in there?

188
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,758
Yup, they in there.

189
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,475
- Hey, Auntie.
- Hi, baby.

190
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,893
- How you doin'?
- Just fine.

191
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,562
- Lavetta, where Dre and Jinx at?
- They're in the back.

192
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,105
Excuse me.

193
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,857
Come on. Chill out.

194
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,734
- Hey, little mama.
- Take your nap.

195
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,904
Why didn't you say hi?

196
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,703
- Wuddup, Cube?
- Wuddup?

197
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,665
Ooh.

198
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,168
Whoo!

199
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,673
Do that shit!

200
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,092
Damn, Dre!

201
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:05,929
Whoo!

202
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,265
Damn.

203
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,310
Whoo!

204
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,854
Yeah!

205
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,651
That's right.

206
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,611
Whoo!

207
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,203
Whoo! Fuck that shit up, Dre!

208
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,080
- Yo.
- That shit was dope, homie!

209
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,790
- What's up, Cube?
- Man!

210
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:37,043
I had some crazy shit
happen on the bus today.

211
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,879
I had a Crenshaw Mafia O.G. get on the bus,

212
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,506
pulled a gun out on us,

213
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,342
gave a fucking motivational speech
and then bumped out.

214
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,885
The shit was crazy.

215
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,680
You wanna avoid some more crazy shit,

216
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,141
you better not get up
on that stage and fuck up.

217
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,477
Ain't nobody gonna fuck up, man.

218
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,481
- You must be stayin' a while.
- Yup.

219
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,567
Mama kicked him out 'cause of that mouth.

220
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:02,861
Shut your ass up.

221
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,654
She didn't kick me out. I left.

222
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,947
Whatever.

223
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,742
That's what
they all say, homie. Right?

224
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,826
You got them rhymes?

225
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,829
Man, I stay with the rhymes.

226
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,540
Man, I'm talkin'
about that hard shit.

227
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,543
- All I write is that hard shit, Dre.
- Okay.

228
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,545
So wassup, man? You ready for Doo-to's?

229
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,005
Shit, is Doo-to's ready for me?

230
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,841
You know that's Compton, right?
They got body bags at the door.

231
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,303
Okay.

232
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,679
Your ass better bring it,

233
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,682
'cause if you don't,
you might end up in one for real.

234
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,184
Body bag?

235
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,894
Man, I don't know about that shit.

236
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,063
Ain't nobody
fucking with you, Jinx.

237
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,607
Stupid, man.
Tell your moms to fix this fucking AC.

238
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,068
Man, what are you doing here, homeless?

239
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,863
Get off of me, nigga!

240
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,869
- Fuck you! Get the fuck off me.
- Stay down.

241
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,704
We didn't do shit!

242
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,707
The fuck you holding me for?
Get the fuck off me!

243
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,833
Where the fuck you going?

244
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,170
Hey, man, I'm just trying to get home, man.
I'm not even doin' nothin'.

245
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,881
Put your fucking hands on top of
your head. Interlace your fingers.

246
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,383
Spread your fucking legs.

247
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,051
You need to stay the fuck down.

248
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,552
Man, this hood is fuckin' hot!

249
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,679
Shut the fuck up!

250
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,389
What the hell is going on out here?

251
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,141
Look, these boys,
they all grew up on this block, okay?

252
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,893
- You need to get back in the house.
- That's my son.

253
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,396
- That's my... O'Shea! That's my son.
- You need to get back in the house.

254
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,231
- Lady, I'm telling you...
- Damn.

255
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,982
You get back inside, or I promise you,

256
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,818
I will ruin your fuckin' night!

257
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,028
Man, you ain't got to talk
to my mom's like that.

258
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,739
Shut the fuck up! Motherfuckin' nigger.

259
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:30,865
Oh, I'm a nigger now?

260
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,243
Wait a minute my ass, motherfucker.

261
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,369
Okay.

262
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,830
Officer, can you explain
why you jacking us right now?

263
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,832
Man, I ain't explaining shit to you.

264
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,375
Get the fuck up off the street.

265
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,503
I'm on my property.
I can stand right here. You got that?

266
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,381
Son! We right here.

267
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,425
Where you got the fuckin' rocks, homeboy?

268
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,218
Not everybody's slangin' dope, man.

269
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,178
I don't give a fuck! This LAPD.

270
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,222
- I'm the only gangster out here.
- All right.

271
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,640
They all check out.

272
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,101
Check out? Check what, man?
Y'all are just over here fuckin' with us.

273
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,227
Get up.

274
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,687
We got cards on all of 'em anyway.

275
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,813
Pick your shit up.

276
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,231
Stay out of trouble, man.

277
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,482
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Get your ass up!

278
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,901
Let's go. Head home.

279
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,319
Stay back.

280
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,238
We ain't doin' shit, man!

281
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,073
Get the fuck outta here.

282
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,199
We didn't even fucking do shit!

283
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,076
Start fuckin' walking.

284
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,079
Hey. Hey. Head home!

285
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,998
O'Shea.

286
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,293
Fuck the police, homie!

287
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,546
Get the fuck out of here!

288
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,590
Yo, this is bullshit!

289
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,642
You really want to be here?

290
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,146
This club full of Pirus.

291
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,814
We straight.

292
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,858
Yeah, thanks for the tip, homie.

293
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,318
These niggas.

294
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,460
I just wanna say this.
You should be a model.

295
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,213
Yeah, you look like a model.

296
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,173
Just sayin', you know.

297
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,218
I look in your eyes and I see a Capricorn.

298
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,844
You're a Capricorn, right?

299
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:19,182
I mean, I can look at a girl
and I know their sign, you know?

300
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,476
It's just something I do.

301
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,269
Uh... Mmm-hmm.

302
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,690
I hope I'm not
disrespecting you, right?

303
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,358
- Uh-huh. Not at all.
- Good.

304
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,567
- Yella!
- Good.

305
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,528
Lonzo coming, man.

306
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,371
- Nah, nah. <i>Weak at the Knees.
</i>-Huh?

307
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,206
<i>Weak at the Knees.</i>

308
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,541
- Hey.
- Wassup?

309
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,002
I'mma go outside and make sure
nothing's poppin' off, all right?

310
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,795
I want you to keep these fat asses shakin'.

311
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,047
Don't play none of that
street-ass rap shit, ar'ight?

312
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,883
I want these motherfuckers
to think about pussy, not pistols.

313
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:55,927
- Yella!
- Huh?

314
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,470
I saw you talking to my lady, man.

315
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,098
Keep your motherfuckin' hands to yourself.

316
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,599
All right.

317
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,896
Man, why you always fuckin'
with Lonzo's girl, man?

318
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,398
Why not?

319
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,234
I can't be afraid
of a grown man in high heels, Dre.

320
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,488
Cube, you up.

321
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:18,992
<i>Hey, yo, Compton!</i>

322
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,452
<i>I got my little homie.</i>

323
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,412
<i>He 'bout to come
and bust a little rhyme for y'all.</i>

324
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,538
<i>I want y'all to give it up</i>

325
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,375
<i>for Ice-motherfuckin'-Cube!</i>

326
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,657
<i>Here's a little
somethin' 'bout a nigga like me</i>

327
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,422
<i>Never shoulda been let out the penitentiary</i>

328
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,090
<i>Ice Cube would like to say</i>

329
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,926
<i>That I'm a crazy mutherfucka
from around the way</i>

330
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,679
<i>Since I was a youth I smoked weed out</i>

331
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,806
<i>Now I'm the mutherfucka that you read about</i>

332
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,099
<i>Takin' a life or two</i>

333
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,434
<i>That's what the hell I do</i>

334
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,811
<i>You don't like how I'm
livin' well, fuck you!</i>

335
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,064
<i>This is a gang and I'm in it</i>

336
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,149
<i>My man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute</i>

337
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,317
<i>With a right left</i>

338
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,027
<i>Right, left you're toothless</i>

339
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,488
<i>And then you say goddamn they ruthless</i>

340
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,823
<i>Everywhere we go they say damn!</i>

341
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,242
<i>Ice Cube's fuckin' up the program</i>

342
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,287
<i>And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no</i>

343
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,122
<i>We too busy sayin' yeah!</i>

344
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,541
<i>About drinkin' straight
out the eight bottle</i>

345
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,044
<i>Do I look like a motherfuckin' role model?</i>

346
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,129
<i>To a kid lookin' up to me</i>

347
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,465
<i>Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money</i>

348
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,801
<i>'Cause I'm tha type of
nigga that's built to last</i>

349
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,595
<i>If you fuck with me
I'll put my foot in your ass</i>

350
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,390
<i>I don't give a fuck 'cause I keep bailin'</i>

351
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,517
<i>Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?</i>

352
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,066
- Fucking right! I told you. I told you.
- Yes, you did.

353
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,657
That's what I'm talking about, man.

354
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,535
Now, see, I'm this close
to firing your monkey ass.

355
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,787
What, you trying to start
a riot up in here?

356
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:49,332
I told you. Didn't I tell you I don't want
that hardcore shit played in my club?

357
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,459
As soon as I turn my back,
you do that shit anyway.

358
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,712
I'm just trying to help
your business out, Lonzo.

359
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,338
You saw they went crazy for that shit.

360
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,673
Don't worry about my business, ar'ight?

361
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,426
You just remember,
the only reason you up on that stage

362
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,845
is 'cause I put you up
on that motherfuckin' stage.

363
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,223
Now, you a badass DJ, I'll give you that,
but you don't like to listen, Dre.

364
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,183
And I get tired of arguing all the time.

365
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,019
'Cause you know,
there's a lot of cats that'll come in here

366
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,895
and they'll play exactly
what I want 'em to play.

367
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,272
Like that shit right there.

368
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:16,276
Cats that understand that you don't
bite the hand that feeds you.

369
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,361
Now you take a backseat
to that shit, nigga.

370
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,363
These fucking marching jackets and shit.

371
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,927
Marching my ass. You march
your ass and do what the fuck I say.

372
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,784
Hey, Dre.

373
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:28,371
Don't even trip on him, homie.

374
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,583
Nigga ain't got no fucking vision, man.

375
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,210
That's why I'mma fuck his bitch.
After he leave.

376
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,379
Not with that shit on.

377
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,467
How you liking this little spot? Hey!

378
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,261
Dr. Dre.

379
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,013
Wassup, E?

380
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,890
It's been a minute, man.

381
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,559
I love your jacket, by the way.

382
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,519
You baggin' on me.

383
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,897
You know I don't like wearing this shit.

384
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,733
That's Lonzo's shit, man.
You know it's part of the gig.

385
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:59,402
Yeah. You remember
the homie Ren from Kelly Park, right?

386
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,071
- Wassup?
- Wuddup, Dre?

387
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,155
- Wuddup?
- Wassup, man?

388
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,157
Look, I heard you been, um,

389
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,576
spending some time at your auntie's house.

390
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,620
How's the couch life?

391
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:11,748
It's fucked up.

392
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,249
I'm too tall for that shit.

393
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,211
Plus I got my woman and baby livin' there.
It's hard, man.

394
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,921
But you know,
everybody can't do what you do.

395
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,382
Yeah, Dre. Well, what I do
gettin' played out quick, man.

396
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,184
Motherfuckers just getting locked up
and laid down out here, you know?

397
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:25,011
- Mmm-hmm.
- I gotta make some changes.

398
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,763
Changes ain't bad.

399
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,182
I'm thinking about
making a few changes myself.

400
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,767
Whatcha mean?

401
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,772
Whatchu think about
dumping some money into this music shit?

402
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,899
Look, I got some ideas.

403
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,192
<i>Let's give it up for Dr. Dre.</i>

404
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,569
Fuck! I gotta get back up there.

405
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,655
That's your calling, man.

406
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:46,032
Tell Lonzo I said, "Fuck him." Ar'ight.

407
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,201
Hey, E.

408
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,412
Think about it.

409
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,913
Ar'ight.

410
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:55,875
Wassup? Do I know you?

411
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,085
What?

412
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,087
- Get 'em up.
- Hell no!

413
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,423
Hey, don't be fuckin'
with my little brother, nigga!

414
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:02,966
What the fuck did he do?

415
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,468
Nigga lookin' at me
like he know me or somethin'.

416
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,637
Man, I told you about this shit!

417
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,223
<i>- Clear the parking lot.
</i>-I told you to go the fuck home.

418
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,641
The fuck wrong with you, man?

419
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,685
You better chill the fuck out.

420
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,395
One time.

421
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,817
Hey! We told everybody
to clear this parking lot!

422
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:22,902
We just standing here.

423
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:23,987
Get outta here!

424
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,030
What's going on?

425
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,322
Hey! Head home.

426
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,824
I fell.

427
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,410
You fell? He fell?

428
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,746
That's what he said.

429
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,831
I didn't ask you what he said.

430
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,624
Get the fuck home!

431
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,170
I am home.

432
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,714
Head home. Go!

433
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,261
If you don't start walking...

434
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,723
Or what?

435
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,975
Turn around. Hands on your head.

436
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:55,894
Come here.

437
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:02,359
You have the right to remain silent.

438
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,861
Stop resisting, boy.

439
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,199
You already know what it is.

440
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,845
- What up, sucker-punch?
- You already know what it is.

441
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,473
Sucker punched that dude, man.

442
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,600
Hey, man, nah, nah, nah. That was Tyree.

443
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:37,227
You know he got that temper and shit.

444
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,312
Always getting me into
fucking trouble, man.

445
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,064
So what they lock you up for?

446
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:45,235
I was literally just standing there, man.
That's it.

447
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:47,570
As far as they was concerned.

448
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,572
That's the gangsterist
shit I heard all week.

449
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,658
Man, it's stupid.

450
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:55,078
But I was thinking about what you
was saying last night, though, man.

451
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:58,581
Oh, yeah? And?

452
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:00,917
It's interesting.

453
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,127
How long?

454
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,338
Really, like, how long do you think that shit
you doing out there gonna last?

455
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,882
'Cause it ain't no happy endings
in that game, man.

456
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,551
You saying a lot for a nigga

457
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,553
who just got bailed outta jail.

458
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,264
I'm just saying, if you can slang dope...

459
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,807
- Nigga!
- What, man?

460
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:17,899
Just tell the whole fuckin'
world I sell dope.

461
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:21,646
Yo, yo. You can slang dope,
you can slang records, man. It's easy.

462
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,024
You got a mind for that shit, E.

463
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,609
So whatchu talking about doing?
Lil' homie from last night?

464
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:28,611
Nah, man. He in a group.

465
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,572
You know, they a trip, but...

466
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:35,744
But that shit, the reality raps,
that's what I'm talking about, man.

467
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:36,995
That's it.

468
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,414
My boy, D.O.C.,
he coming in from Dallas, dope.

469
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,709
My little homie, Ren, rap too.

470
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:43,793
Oh, yeah?

471
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:47,756
Hey, look, I got these cats,
H.B.O., Home Boys Only

472
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:50,967
from New York, dope voices, man.

473
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:52,761
Some whack-ass lyrics, though.

474
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:58,641
I'm saying, Cube,
he wrote this shit for 'em, it's crazy.

475
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,644
Shit, we could probably
do something with that.

476
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:05,148
That's what I'm saying, man.
Start a label or something, man.

477
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:06,649
A label?

478
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,735
That's kinda fucking far-fetched, Dre.

479
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,653
Yeah, but check this out,

480
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,989
what would you call a
record label like that?

481
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,331
Ruthless.

482
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,041
Ruthless?

483
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,380
- Just like these fucking police, nigga.
- Ruthless.

484
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:31,299
Let's get the fuck from around here.
Trying to get me sent to jail.

485
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,134
Get your simple ass in the car.

486
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:42,352
<i>What the fuck is "gankin"?
And what's a "6-4"?</i>

487
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,730
<i>- Yeah.
</i>-It's a car. A 6-4 Impala.

488
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:48,525
"Ganking" is when you jack somebody, man.

489
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,694
It's not a big deal.
The shit just sound better.

490
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,655
<i>Yo, man, it's too much
cursing for radio play.</i>

491
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:56,282
I mean, besides, who gives a fuck
about Compton anyway? Right?

492
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,618
Hold the fuck up. Hey. Hold up, man.

493
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,747
Hey, y'all got something
to say about Compton?

494
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:04,874
'Cause we might have a problem
up in this bitch.

495
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:08,837
Huh!

496
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,673
<i>No? Then do the lyrics,</i>

497
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:14,259
<i>'cause I'm really losing my patience,
ar'ight?</i>

498
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,969
Stop fucking embarrassing me, man.

499
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,345
<i>Hey, man. I ain't with this shit.</i>

500
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:18,430
Yeah, man. Fuck this shit.

501
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:20,807
- Fuck this Jheri curl rap bullshit, man.
- Where y'all going?

502
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,935
Fuck you! Wearing a Kangol
don't make you LL Cool J, nigga.

503
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,396
What the fuck you gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do, mark-ass nigga?

504
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,480
Hey.

505
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,663
Let's roll, B.

506
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,418
B-street-looking motherfucker.

507
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,753
Fucking Jheri curl ass.

508
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:52,464
Keep talkin' that bullshit
on your way out the door, nigga.

509
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,390
Well, there goes the talent, Dre.

510
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,600
Shut the fuck up, E.

511
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,770
- I'm saying...
- Come on, man.

512
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,773
How the fuck we suppose
to make a record label and hit records

513
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,524
and we ain't got no talent?

514
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:16,071
I mean, you said, hold up my side of the deal.
You said, put some money up.

515
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,823
So, it's time for you to deliver.

516
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:26,331
Why don't you do this shit, E?

517
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,875
Nah, for real.
Get in there on the mic.

518
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:32,629
You ain't got shit to lose.
It's your money. You paying for it.

519
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:36,341
No, I can't. 'Cause I'm not a rapper.
There's your rapper.

520
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:37,717
I'm in a group already, man.

521
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,928
Jinx and them
would trip on me if I do anything.

522
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,472
Look, I understand
that you wanna keep throwing your life away

523
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,683
with Jinx and the backyard
boogie band or whatever...

524
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,976
But I'm the Berry Gordy of this shit.

525
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,896
So, whenever y'all figure out
what y'all wanna do,

526
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,106
just let me know.

527
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,984
Come on, man.
Look, the song is about you, E.

528
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:57,987
Eazy-motherfuckin'-E. I'm telling you.

529
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,198
Come on, man.

530
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,783
You the only muthafucka with a 6-4.

531
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,827
- You got a 6-4?
- I don't have a car.

532
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,994
You got a 6-4?

533
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:06,037
I got a po' Porsche, man.

534
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:07,706
Nigga, come on, man.

535
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,375
You ain't doing nothing.

536
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:15,505
But you the business man,
so, you know.

537
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:17,007
It's on you.

538
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,759
We got a cool-ass song, though.

539
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,679
I think you could hit that shit.

540
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:27,142
I'm not sold, Dre.

541
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,602
Whatchu mean, you not sold?
You just gonna sit there?

542
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,480
You're kinda being a ho right now, Eric.

543
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,819
Fuck y'all, niggas.

544
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,529
Berry Gordy to save the day.

545
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:40,572
I ain't scared.

546
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,240
- You ain't scared?
- What's up then?

547
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,325
<i>What are you doing?</i>

548
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:47,078
E, let me produce. Man.

549
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:49,998
<i>Feel like it's getting weird.</i>

550
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,875
Man, shut up and get comfortable.

551
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,543
Let's go.

552
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:59,049
<i>Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4</i>

553
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,842
Shit.

554
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,052
The fuck?

555
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:07,432
<i>What the fuck is so funny?</i>

556
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,517
<i>Nothing. Oh, E, can you hear me?</i>

557
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,562
Yeah, I can hear you
and how much y'all fucking laughing.

558
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:16,149
<i>Hey, E, you good.
Just hit that first beat hard, man.</i>

559
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:18,026
You gotta come in on beat.

560
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:19,569
<i>Cruisin' down the street</i>

561
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,279
You cruisin'.

562
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,073
- You good, Eric.
- All right?

563
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:24,866
No, no, no, no. You good, you good.

564
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,911
It's dope. But on beat.

565
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:30,246
Again. All right? Let's go.

566
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,332
You cruising. All right?

567
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:41,299
<i>Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4</i>

568
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,510
<i>- Shit.
- That ain't it.</i>

569
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,303
<i>- It really ain't.
</i>-Hey, hey, Dre.

570
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,847
He gotta go if we're gonna do this.
Cube, you gotta go.

571
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,171
<i>Get the fuck outta here, Yella.</i>

572
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:50,642
<i>- He not talkin' to me.
</i>-Nah, nigga, both of y'all.

573
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:51,768
<i>You talking to me?</i>

574
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,144
<i>- Bye.
</i>-Go, Cube.

575
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,604
- And Yella, get the fuck outta here, man.
- Me too?

576
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:55,772
Yeah, so we can get this shit done.

577
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,692
Write the song, Cube.
Shut the fuck up, Cube.

578
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,819
<i>- Take these with you, Cube.
</i>-What'd I do?

579
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,987
- For real?
- Yes, man. Come on.

580
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,323
You know what? Whatever. Whatever.

581
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,118
You motherfucker.

582
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,494
<i>- Come on, E.
</i>-You finished, Dre?

583
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,455
<i>You wanna laugh too?
I stay in this bitch by myself.</i>

584
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:13,665
Hey, just say the words, ar'ight?

585
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:14,791
What does that even mean?

586
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,335
<i>Man, just say the shit with me.
Ar'ight? Cruisin'.</i>

587
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:18,420
<i>Cruisin'.</i>

588
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,422
<i>Yeah, "Cruisin'". Let's go.</i>

589
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:28,847
<i>Dre, you know this shit
ain't gonna never work</i>

590
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,683
A'ight. You trying to be funny.

591
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:34,019
But, you see how you said that shit, right?
Like you believe it.

592
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:35,228
<i>Yeah, I believe that shit.</i>

593
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,188
Then say this shit like
you believe it, man.

594
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:38,982
<i>Like it's a motherfuckin' Sunday</i>

595
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,901
and you cruisin' down Crenshaw
in a motherfuckin' 6-4.

596
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:44,821
<i>Come on. Say that shit like you believe it,
man, like it's your words.</i>

597
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:45,989
<i>Feel that shit.</i>

598
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,824
<i>Stop playing around. Loosen the fuck up.</i>

599
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:48,992
<i>There you go.</i>

600
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:57,876
<i>Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4</i>

601
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:01,338
<i>Oh, shit. Hey, that was dope, E.</i>

602
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:04,299
That shit was dope, man. Yeah.

603
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:06,760
<i>That's what I'm talking about, man.</i>

604
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,720
<i>You feelin' that shit, right?</i>

605
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:12,265
Now we only got 59 more lines
to punch in, but it's all good.

606
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,976
<i>We gonna get through it.
Let's go on to the next one.</i>

607
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,285
<i>My man didn't budge</i>

608
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:34,829
<i>Bailiff came over to turn him in</i>

609
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:37,916
<i>Kilo G looked up and gave a grin</i>

610
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,460
<i>He yelled out "fire!" then came Suzy</i>

611
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:43,213
<i>The bitch came in with a submachine Uzi</i>

612
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:46,049
<i>Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her</i>

613
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,468
<i>Both upstate for attempted murder</i>

614
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:51,221
<i>'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard</i>

615
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:53,807
<i>You come talking that trash
we'll pull your card</i>

616
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,559
<i>Knowing nothing in life but to be legit</i>

617
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:59,437
<i>Don't quote me,
boy 'cause I ain't said shit</i>

618
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:04,693
Yes.

619
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:05,902
All right, Eazy.

620
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,445
Hell yes, Dre!

621
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:08,905
- Yeah?
- Yes.

622
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:10,407
Hey, D.O.C.

623
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:12,826
Whatchu think, man?

624
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:14,577
You think they gonna feel

625
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:17,455
Man, to be honest, man,
that shit is super dope, nigga.

626
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,374
- Hell yeah!
- For real, nigga.

627
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,419
Hey, Lonzo. Whatchu think?

628
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:26,256
Sound like some waste-of-time shit to me.

629
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:28,883
Look, trust me, this shit
ain't gonna work, ar'ight?

630
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,802
You ain't gonna get no radio play
with that shit right there.

631
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,679
- Oh, for real?
- Oh, for very real.

632
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:34,097
Y'all need to wrap this shit up too

633
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,516
'cause I need you to get back
on that slow jam that we talked about.

634
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:39,352
This whole reality of rap
shit y'all tryin' to do.

635
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:41,938
Talkin' about low-riders and jail,
nobody wanna hear that shit.

636
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:45,025
Now you need to get back in there
and work on that slow jam that we worked on.

637
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,109
And I'm serious

638
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:49,320
about all you motherfuckers taking up
my time and that's coming outta your pay.

639
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:51,448
No disrespect, Eazy,
'cause I know you real.

640
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:53,700
But you, motherfucker,
I ain't gonna take that shit from you.

641
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:55,744
20 years from now,
you gonna fucking thank me. Watch.

642
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:57,505
Nigga, 20 years
from now, you still gonna be

643
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:59,914
recording love songs
in this dusty-ass garage.

644
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:02,167
Fuck outta here.

645
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:04,669
Wrap this shit up.

646
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:07,464
Yeah. Okay. You got it.

647
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:08,965
No, you got it!

648
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,637
- Yes!
- I told you. Didn't I tell you?

649
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,306
You told me, man. I should've believed you.

650
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,269
What the fuck did you all get from that
that you're high-fiving and shit?

651
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:21,978
Cube. Man, if Lonzo think
it ain't gonna be shit,

652
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,688
we know we got a motherfucking hit!

653
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,148
- Exactly.
- For real.

654
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,191
'Cause he don't know shit about music.

655
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:28,356
He don't know good music
when he hears it.

656
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,736
Play that shit again!

657
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:30,862
Dre...

658
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:33,990
You a fucking genius. You a fucking genius.

659
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:35,867

670
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:23,289
These phones are burning up.

This is 1580 KDAY.

This is Greg Mack with the Mack Attack,

673
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:29,796
and I gotta give it up to my boy, Dr. Dre,

674
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:33,258
who is coming

679
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,396
Excuse me.

680
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:48,732
- Yeah?
- I heard your record.

681
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:51,401
I'm Jerry Heller.

682
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,986
Eric Wright.

683
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,238
Real pleasure to meet you, man.

684
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,448
Same here.

685
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:57,699
Uh, would it...

686
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,703
Here, let me get those for you.
Let me get those for you.

687
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:05,582
Would it be possible
to have a word with you for a second, Eric?

688
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:06,916
About what?

689
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:09,044
About music.

690
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,297
After you.

691
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,257
All right. Come on.

692
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:22,932
So, I thought your album was good, man.

693
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:24,100
Just good?

694
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:25,393
Mmm.

695
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:30,148
Hey, hey, hey, hey! No.

696
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:31,858
I thought it was exceptional.

697
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:33,610
- Exceptional?
- Yes.

698
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:36,279
Fantastic.
Please, just sit down, all right?

699
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:38,698
We'll start this again. Come on.

700
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:44,371
All right. I'm gonna try this again. Okay?

701
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:45,789
All right.

702
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:51,127
As a music manager,
let me tell you what I can do for you, Eric.

703
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,672
I will make you legit.

704
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:57,592
It seems as if I could
do something for you.

705
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:03,431
I see. You think because
I don't have some flashy office

706
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:04,974
I don't know what I'm talking about?

707
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,603
I worked with Elton John.
I worked with Otis Redding.

708
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:13,608
Let me see.
I worked with War. I worked with Styx.

709
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:17,779
- I worked with, uh...
- Have you worked with anybody this decade?

710
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,032
Okay.

711
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:24,661
Let me tell you what I see here, Eric.

712
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:30,500
A lot of raw talent, a lot of braggadocio.

713
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,293
Bravado. Uh...

714
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,462
But if you think anyone's
gonna talk to you,

715
00:37:34,504 --> 00:37:36,881
you think anyone
is gonna let you in the building

716
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:40,093
where somebody might listen to you or talk
to you, you think that's gonna happen?

717
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:42,762
You're crazy, man. I'm sorry.

718
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,348
That is what I can do for you.

719
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:47,642
I can make you legit.

720
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:51,688
I can get you in that building.
And I will protect you.

721
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:55,692
I will block out all the noise
of this crazy fuckin' business

722
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,694
and we can build something big.

723
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:01,656
But you gotta believe in me
the way that I believe in you.

724
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:03,992
The way that I believe in this,

725
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:06,619
because you have a unique talent, Eric.

726
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:07,871
Very special.

727
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:09,664
Don't fuck around.

728
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,418
But, you know what?

729
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,671
If you can't handle it,

730
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:19,966
if it's too much fuckin' pressure
for you, then fine.

731
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:22,052
Get outta here.

732
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:25,430
Wait. I'm listening.

733
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:32,520
You got more music for me?

734
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:37,192
- Absolutely.
- Good.

735
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:42,530
'Cause you are gonna
have to follow this up, quick. All right?

736
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,742
Now, what does N.W.A stand for, huh?

737
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:49,579
No Whites Allowed? Something like that?

738
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:50,872
Nah.

739
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,500
Niggas With Attitudes.

740
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,297
You're fucking kidding me.

741
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:06,054
All right. We can work with that.

742
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,725
- Good. I like that. I like that a lot.
- You better.

743
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:15,605
Fantastic.

744
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:17,774
Fantastic.

745
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:43,717
What up, what up? What's up, fam?

746
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:49,931
- Hey.
- What's up, baby?

747
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:51,474
Dre.

748
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,815
Hey, fellas, y'all got any idea

749
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,817
why I asked y'all to
wear all black tonight?

750
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:02,360
'Cause we a all-star group.

751
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:04,154
And to be a all-star group

752
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:05,655
we gotta look like it,

753
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:08,658
sound like it, dress like it.

754
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,036
You mind tellin' me
what the fuck happened in your situation?

755
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,496
Man, kiss my ass.
This the only clean shit I had left.

756
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,100
That's saying a lot
about how you live.

757
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:16,685
Are we getting paid to wear all black?

758
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:22,005
Look, I ain't lookin' out for your ass
no more, man. Put this on.

759
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:25,383
Oh, shit, there go Mr. Drummond.

760
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,260
Nah, nah. That's Mr. Furley

761
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:28,636
from <i>Three's Company.</i>

762
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:30,305
Hey, that's good, Ren.

763
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,976
Y'all finished?

764
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:38,063
This man been out there
shopping our stuff around

765
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:39,898
trying to get money for Ruthless.

766
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:41,524
He tryin' to get us distribution.

767
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:42,901
He tryin' to get us on tour.

768
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:43,985
He could probably bring some real money

769
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,028
- to the table...
- Okay.

770
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,112
- So let's take this shit serious.
- Okay.

771
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,197
And then what, E?

772
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,534
All he do is take 20 off the top.
We cut 80, but that's how managers work.

773
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:54,954
Fellas, all right. I'm sorry I'm late.
How's everybody doing?

774
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:58,667
I'm gonna be honest with you.
We've had a lot of passes.

775
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:01,878
Uh, people are scared of you guys.
Big time.

776
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,838
They think that you're dangerous.

777
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:06,383
Uh, I happen to think
that that's a good thing.

778
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:08,760
These fucking guys,
they need some more convincing.

779
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:12,514
They're so fucking timid.
So I invited them here to the show.

780
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:15,934
So you've got to kick ass tonight.

781
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:17,894
- Can you do that?
- Hell yeah.

782
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:20,230
They're gonna be here.
Scare the shit out of them.

783
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:23,400
Blow the fucking roof off, all right?

784
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:24,526
Have a good show.

785
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:25,944
Hey, can this motherfucker

786
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:27,862
Jerry Heller bring in more pussy?

787
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:29,344
'Cause that shit's worth 20 percent.

Jerry, you're my friend,

843
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:11,401
but Compton? I don't think so.
Queens, maybe.

844
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:15,155
Listen, if you find
the next Bon Jovi, call me, okay?

845
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:16,518
- Good luck.

You wrecked
these motherfuckers tonight, boy.

00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:45,185
The stage was shaking so much I thought
my needle's about to jump off the record!

856
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:50,940
Yo, I was trippin' off them knowing the words,
though. That shit was crazy.

857
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:54,235
Hey, y'all, I'm telling you,
Compton is definitely on the map, yo.

858
00:44:54,277 --> 00:44:56,905
- Damn right.
- That's for damn sure.

859
00:44:56,946 --> 00:45:00,283
Man, I figured you were gonna represent
tonight. Good shit, my nigga.

Wuddup? Whatchu been up to?
You still out there in Vegas?

862
00:45:05,038 --> 00:45:08,291
Man, I just been back and forth, man.
Doing some security bodyguard work.

863
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:10,877
If y'all need my services, let me know.

864
00:45:11,836 --> 00:45:13,004
Security?

865
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:14,839
I don't think we gonna need
no bodyguards, man.

866
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,466
We might got that covered.

867
00:45:19,135 --> 00:45:21,137
But you never know
what you need until you need it.

868
00:45:24,974 --> 00:45:27,977
Look, I just came here to give y'all props.
I got people waiting on me.

869
00:45:29,312 --> 00:45:31,356
Excuse me.

870
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,233
Uh, okay. That was

871
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:36,069
one hell of a show.

872
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:38,405
Nice job.

873
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:40,657
Very, very nice, gentlemen. Outstanding!

874
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:44,869
You kicked ass, yeah.
You definitely did. You definitely did.

875
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:49,499
Okay, this is Eazy-E and N.W.A, obviously.

876
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,209
Guys, this is Bryan Turner.

877
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:53,113
- How you doin', fellas?
- Ice Cube.

878

879
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:58,675
And he wants to sign you.

880
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,343
Yeah, immediately.

881
00:46:00,885 --> 00:46:03,388
Fellas, I got to say, I loved the show.
All right?

882
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:07,183
What you did with that crowd out there,
I mean, I've never seen anything like that.

883
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:10,562
So, I think, honestly,
if y'all wanted to, you guys

884
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:12,647
- would fit perfectly with our label.
- Yes.

885
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:14,065
That'll work.

886
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:15,817
Nah, nah, nah, nah. No, it won't. Nah.

887
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:18,653
Well, hold on, man.
I mean, Priority Records.

888
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:20,912
I've never heard of it.
I mean, what you got?

889
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:24,367
Like, is it Def Jam?
Like, the Beastie Boys? You know?

890
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:27,370
Run DMC? You know what I'm saying?

891
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,873
Or is it more R&B?

892
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:32,042
You know, Prince, Michael Jackson.

893
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,918
- It's, uh, a little more...
- More that end of the spectrum.

894
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:35,962
- More R&B as of right now, but...
- Yeah.

895
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:38,048
Yeah, we represent nothing big,

896
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:39,382
but mostly R&B.

897
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:40,759
Who dat?

898
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:42,469
It's, uh, California Raisins.

899
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:44,095
Who?

900
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:45,847
It's the California Raisins.

901
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,058
The raisins from the commercial singing

902
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,901
"I Heard it Through the
Grapevine" and shit?

903
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:51,728
Yes, Cube, the little-ass raisins.

904
00:46:52,228 --> 00:46:53,938
That would be the one.

905
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:56,107
Hear it out.
Don't get ahead of yourselves, okay?

906
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:59,819
I was laughing, too,
I promise, then I started cashing checks.

907
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:04,574
So, look, I gotta tell ya,
those little fuckers, they went gold last year.

908
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:07,535
- Gold?
- Almost platinum. Yeah.

909
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:10,747
What do you say, fellas?
You wanna go make a record?

910
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:15,418
I mean...

911
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:17,253
- Yeah!
- Yeah...

912
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,592
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

913
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:25,095
He seriously dug it. He really dug it.

914
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:26,721

- He did.

915
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:27,963
- Thank you, man.
- You did it.

916
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,691
A'ight, so, look, your rhymes ain't tight,
it ain't makin' the record.

917
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:40,527
This ain't Lonzo's shit,
this the real deal. Ar'ight?

918
00:47:40,902 --> 00:47:42,946
So your shit better be dope. Who up?

919
00:47:43,363 --> 00:47:44,572

00:47:48,284 --> 00:47:49,869
All right. Let's see.

00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:51,705
Hey, Yella. Play that shit.

<i>Ruthless, plenty of that and much more</i>

00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:01,131
<i>That you step and do your dance routine
It ain't a dream, my man</i>

<i>And for this reason I'm a walkin' threat</i>

933
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:14,853

<i>And now I'm livin' in
correctional facilities</i>

938
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:31,202
<i>'Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight meditate like a Buddhist</i>

939
00:48:31,327 --> 00:48:33,079
<i>Express yourself</i>

940
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,459
<i>Express yourself</i>

941
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:42,172
<i>N.W.A take two</i>

942
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:48,136
Yeah!

943
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:49,888
Hell yeah, Dre.

944
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:51,848
Yeah, man!

945
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:54,351
You feel that shit, right? Hey, check this out.

946
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:55,685
Fuck it up.

947
00:48:57,687 --> 00:48:58,855
Yeah.

948
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:01,483
That's what I'm talking about, man.
But you hear the difference, right?

949
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:03,526
Yeah, way better than the shit
I came up with.

950
00:49:03,568 --> 00:49:05,862
- I know.
- Fuck you.

951
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:09,199
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I thought you'd like to know

952
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:11,659
our deal with Priority Records is done.

953
00:49:11,868 --> 00:49:14,371
- Yes! That's whassup, man!
- Money!

954
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:16,414
Contracts right here for you to sign.

955
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:18,583
- Thank you, my good man.
- Music keep sounding like this,

956
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:20,460
this album is gonna be incredible.

957
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:22,170
Well, you're welcome, Jerry.

958
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,049
Very strong lyrics too, Cube. Very strong.

959
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:27,884
- Appreciate that, Jerry.
- Mmm-hmm.

960
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:29,636
So what's up with our contracts, though?

961
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:33,249
They're getting done right now.
Lawyers are drawing 'em up.

962
00:49:33,306 --> 00:49:35,642
Jerry on top of that,
but did you just switch all the straws?

963
00:49:35,725 --> 00:49:38,645
Yo, Dre. There's something outside
you need to take care of.

964
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:40,772
Right now. Trust me.

965
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:46,069
Serious.

966
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:48,279
Uh-oh. Really?

967
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:52,033
- We can split that.
- Cube. Right there, hush.

968
00:49:52,992 --> 00:49:56,204
- Not this time.
- You know what I got for you.

969
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:59,666
So let me get this straight.
You gonna do this right here, right now?

970
00:49:59,874 --> 00:50:01,418
What am I supposed to do?

971
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:03,670
We're sleeping in a twin bed
at your auntie's house.

972
00:50:03,753 --> 00:50:05,463
We have a baby, Andre.

973
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:07,257
You expect me to wait
for what you doin' in there?

974
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:09,092
And you in the streets fuckin' around?

975
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:10,927
- Are you crazy?
- What?

976
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:12,470
I'm out here bustin' my fuckin' ass

977
00:50:12,554 --> 00:50:14,806
day and fuckin' night
tryin' to create something.

978
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:17,600
You gonna come up in here talkin' about
some fuckin' bitches? Are you crazy?

979
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:20,186
- You don't get it.
- No, you don't get it, Lavetta.

980
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,312
Daddy!

981
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:22,814
It's all right, baby.

982
00:50:22,897 --> 00:50:24,607
Chill out, man.

983
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:30,196
Tyra, it's gonna be okay. All right.

984
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,823
- All right, baby?
- Bye, Dre.

985
00:50:31,906 --> 00:50:33,450
Daddy love you.

986
00:50:43,084 --> 00:50:45,545
- You cool?
- Fuck no, man. I'm far from cool.

987
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:47,797
- What happened, Dre? What she say?
- What'd you do?

988
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:50,175
Shit! Here we go again.

989
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:52,260
Shit. One time, one time.

990
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:56,056
We cool. We ain't even doin' shit.
We not doin' shit.

991
00:50:56,681 --> 00:50:58,600
You guys lost?

992
00:50:58,850 --> 00:50:59,893
Nah.

993
00:50:59,976 --> 00:51:01,853
You niggas supposed to be somewhere?

994
00:51:02,562 --> 00:51:04,898
Yeah! Here. We working.

995
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:06,441
Oh, you working?

996
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:08,276
Yeah, I bet.

997
00:51:08,401 --> 00:51:11,029
- What we do?
- We'll find out in a minute what you did.

998
00:51:11,112 --> 00:51:13,490
- What's this?
- Shut the fuck up.

999
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:16,242
- The fuck?
- Get your ass on the ground now.

1000
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:18,578
Get on the ground!

1001
00:51:18,828 --> 00:51:20,788
On the ground?
What am I supposed to do with this?

1002
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,040
Get on the ground.

1003
00:51:22,123 --> 00:51:23,958
What we do?

1004
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,002
Get down! Get on the ground, now!

1005
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:28,546
Get your punk ass on the ground. Let's go.

1006
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,673
Get the fuck down.

1007
00:51:29,714 --> 00:51:31,591
Hands behind your back.
Interlock your fingers.

1008
00:51:31,716 --> 00:51:33,885
- This is fucked up.
- Interlock 'em!

1009
00:51:33,968 --> 00:51:36,429
The fuck you got us
on the ground like this for, officer?

1010
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:38,848
For our protection.
There's seven of you and four of us.

1011
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,392
So sit tight and let us do our job.

1012
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:42,394
Hey, officer, I'm sorry.
What is going on out here?

1013
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:44,020
Sir, can you stay right there, please?

1014
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:45,939
We're trying to check these bangers,
make sure they're clean.

1015
00:51:46,022 --> 00:51:48,191
All right, I'm sorry,
these are not bangers, okay?

1016
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:50,402
These, um... These are artists.

1017
00:51:50,985 --> 00:51:52,654
- Excuse me. Artists?
- Yeah.

1018
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:53,863
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1019
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:55,323
- What kind of artists?
- Rappers.

1020
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:57,534
And they're working with me
in the studio right now.

1021
00:51:57,575 --> 00:52:00,412
Well, see, rap is not an art.
And I'm sorry, who are you?

1022
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:01,871
I'm the manager.

1023
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:04,457
Well, you're wasting your time,
Mr. Manager.

1024
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,418
- You gotta be kidding me.
- You're wasting your time.

1025
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:08,086
- Really?
- These clients of yours, these rappers...

1026
00:52:08,169 --> 00:52:10,046
- Yeah.
- They look like gang members.

1027
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:14,134
You can't come down here and arrest people
just because of what they look like.

1028
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:16,928
What, are you crazy?
But, that's police harassment.

1029
00:52:17,053 --> 00:52:18,388
- You said you're a manager, right?
- Yeah.

1030
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:21,016
- Not a fuckin' lawyer.
- Does that matter?

1031
00:52:21,224 --> 00:52:24,144
You cannot come down here
and harass these guys

1032
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:26,354
- because they're black! People have rights!
- Calm down.

1033
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:27,939
Step back! Step back!

1034
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:30,316
I'll step back, you let them up.
Get up, guys.

1035
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,068
Come on. Eric!

1036
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,154
- You don't tell them to get up.
- Get up.

1037
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:35,572
- I'm stepping back.
- We will decide that.

1038
00:52:35,613 --> 00:52:38,374
You have no idea the people I know.
I'm gonna call the Mayor's office.

1039
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:39,826
Step back.

1040
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:56,468
Now get up.

1041
00:52:59,095 --> 00:53:00,972
Get up, now!

1042
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:03,933
Okay. Come on, guys.

1043
00:53:03,975 --> 00:53:05,435
And you keep your people in line,
you understand?

1044
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:07,437
And the fuck out of Torrance.

1045
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:09,731
- Good. Come on, guys.
- You got a problem?

1046
00:53:09,814 --> 00:53:10,815
It's my jersey.

1047
00:53:11,107 --> 00:53:12,942
You ain't tough now, huh?

1048
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:14,778
Eric, come on. Let's go.

1049
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:16,780
- You got a problem?
- Yella.

1050
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:21,576
- I didn't hear you.
- Let's go.

1051
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:23,912
- Yous a fuckin' sellout.
- Shut up.

1052
00:53:25,747 --> 00:53:28,625
- Everything's fine. Okay?
- Yeah.

1053
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:31,086
- You got something to say?
- Cube.

1054
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:32,671
You got something to say, boy?

1055
00:53:32,754 --> 00:53:35,090
Cube. Get inside. Let's get back to work.

1056
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:37,759
You heard what your master said.
Get inside, boy.

1057
00:53:38,176 --> 00:53:39,803
You shut the fuck up!

1058
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:42,430
Hey. Get the fuck back inside.

1059
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,308
Get inside, Cube.

1060
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,895
We're gonna go back and work. Okay?

1061
00:53:48,978 --> 00:53:51,022
Leave us alone. You know, leave us alone.

1062
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:52,816
Fuckin' rap music.

1063

Fuckin' disgraceful.

1064
00:53:58,321 --> 00:54:00,073
I got something for this beat.

1065
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:03,660
Hey, yo, Yella, cut it.

1066
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:06,746
What is it lookin' like, Dre? It's hard?

1067
00:54:06,871 --> 00:54:08,540
Yo.

1068
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:14,754
- Hell yeah, Cube.
- Yeah.

1069
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:17,674
This gonna start some shit,
but this what we need. Hell yeah!

Are you going
out there with them or not?

1098
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:44,260
No. I had enough of that shit in the '70s.

1099
00:55:44,344 --> 00:55:47,597
But I'm gonna fly out there a bunch of times,
and I'm gonna check on them.

1100
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:49,516
Can you just make sure
that everything goes smooth, please?

1101
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:50,600
Of course.

00:56:05,156 --> 00:56:06,449
Are you fucking nuts?

1110
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:08,451
Jesus, Eric. Are you out of your mind?

- What?
- You can't take that on the bus.

1112
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,789
How am I supposed to protect myself

everything else good.

00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:30,223
A'ight, look... Otis, get the bags.
Put them on the van.

1120
00:56:30,306 --> 00:56:33,768
You feel better? We're not even riding
with them no more, Jerry.

1121
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:36,354
- Unbelievable. Jesus Christ.
- No, no, no, do not put those on the...

Get off the phone.

Hey, hey. Hold on, T. Somebody at the door.

Ain't no Felicia in here, nigga.

Mind if I take a look?

1202
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:46,419
Get the fuck outta my room, man.

1203
00:59:48,254 --> 00:59:50,340
This nigga just came
to my motherfuckin' door strapped, man.

I'll show that nigga strapped.

1206
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:54,719
Hey, where Felicia at?

00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:56,403
- Where Felicia?
- Where's your homegirl.

1208
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:57,681
You Felicia?

1209
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:59,307
Hey, Felicia. You Felicia?

1210
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:01,101
Felicia? Her dude here.

1211
01:00:01,184 --> 01:00:04,771
All right.
So none of y'all are named Felicia now. Okay.

1212
01:00:04,854 --> 01:00:07,357
Yella! Hey, Yella!

1213
01:00:07,982 --> 01:00:09,401
Your name Felicia?

1214
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:11,945

1215
01:00:12,987 --> 01:00:14,587
- Valerie. Your name Valerie.
- Whatever.

1216
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:17,283
Felicia! Girl, your nigga's out there.

1217
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:18,702
She's suckin' dick, though.

1218
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:20,286
He got guns, girl. Come on!

1219
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:21,621
The nigga is strapped.

1220
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:23,623
I'll show this nigga right now.
Talkin' about gettin' strapped.

01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:25,583
Hey, Ren.

Hey. Y'all looking for Felicia?

1228
01:00:43,935 --> 01:00:45,353
She in there or what?

1229
01:00:46,604 --> 01:00:49,566
She kinda preoccupied

1230
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:51,192
The fuck you say, little nigga?

1231
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:54,320
I said, she got
a motherfuckin' dick in her mouth, nigga.

1232
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:56,114
That ain't fun no more?

1233
01:00:56,197 --> 01:00:57,282
The fuck y'all going?

1234
01:00:57,365 --> 01:00:59,085
Nigga, she's trying to compensate.

1235
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:02,120
Wow!

1236

Fat niggas was bullshit!

1237

Punk-ass niggas, man.

Nigga runnin' so fast, that shit was crazy.

Don't let that shit bother you.

1242
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:15,175
- Tryin' to get me killed?
- Whatever.

1243
01:01:15,258 --> 01:01:17,469
Nigga, ain't tryin'
to take no bullet for no bitch,

1244
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:19,012
I guarantee you that.

1245
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:20,597

You're flying up
the <i>Billboard</i> 200 albums chart.

1255
01:01:57,133 --> 01:01:58,635
R&B and hip-hop charts too.

1256
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:01,471
You have any idea
how many records we're selling?

1257
01:02:01,554 --> 01:02:04,641
Ruthless has arrived, Eric.
We're fucking huge.

1258
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:08,144
That is dope, Jerry. That's dope.

15 on that.

1264
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:23,243
Man, fuck, man!

01:02:23,451 --> 01:02:25,211
Hey. Come on, man. Put that shit up.

1266
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,207
Excuse me. Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

1267
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:31,334
I don't mean to be the bearer of bad news.

1268
01:02:31,459 --> 01:02:32,669
What you got?

1269
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:35,005
Oh, shit.

1270
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:36,339
What's that?

1271
01:02:37,298 --> 01:02:38,925
Motherfuckin' FBI.

1272
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:42,804
What the fuck?
I'm supposed to not care about this?

1273
01:02:42,887 --> 01:02:45,432
Wait, the FBI? They comin' after us, too?

1274
01:02:45,515 --> 01:02:46,516
Kind of.

1275
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:48,101
I mean, what the letter say, Jerry?

1276
01:02:48,184 --> 01:02:50,103
Uh, basically, uh...

1277
01:02:50,645 --> 01:02:52,856
"A song recorded by the rap group N.W.A

1278
01:02:52,897 --> 01:02:55,358
"on their album <i>Straight Out Of Compton</i>

1279
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:57,861
"encourages violence
against law enforcement.

1280
01:02:57,944 --> 01:03:00,071
"Advocating violence and assault is wrong,

1281
01:03:00,238 --> 01:03:04,117
"and we in the law enforcement community
take exception to such action."

1282
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,368
- Fuck that.
- Fuck that.

1283
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:08,121
Fuck the law enforcement community.
We got freedom of speech, man.

1284
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:10,248
- What the fuck can they do to us?
- Right.

1285
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,583
You wanna provoke 'em and find out?

1286
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,251
Because this is a warning, Cube.

1287
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:16,504
And it's about <i>Fuck Tha Police,
</i>in particular, so...

1288
01:03:17,672 --> 01:03:21,051
I think maybe we should not
play that song right now.

1289
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:23,845
Not play what? Fuck that, Jerry.
That's what the song is about.

1290
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,638
Relax, relax.
We're not giving in to anything.

1291
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:26,765
No. No.

1292
01:03:26,848 --> 01:03:29,100
I just say we retire it for now, okay?

1293
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:31,102
It is a reasonably worded threat.

1294
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:35,398
This isn't street bullshit.
This isn't the Crips and Bloods and crap.

1295
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,691
This is the federal government.

1296
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:39,402
These guys can come after us
a million different ways.

1297
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,571
I don't even want to think about it.
Why provoke them?

1298
01:03:41,613 --> 01:03:42,739
The fuck does that mean?

1299
01:03:42,822 --> 01:03:44,741
If it was the LAPD,
maybe I'd be a little worried,

1300
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:46,409
but we can't let them censor us, Jerry.

1301
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:48,453
- I'm not advocating for censorship, Cube.
- Wait. Wait.

1302
01:03:48,536 --> 01:03:52,582
Maybe none of us should be worried.
Maybe we should be happy.

1303
01:03:53,541 --> 01:03:55,101
- What you mean, E?
- Dunno about happy.

1304
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:57,003
'Cause you see,
this right here is a gift.

1305
01:03:57,128 --> 01:03:58,421
It's the FBI, E. Whatchu talking about?

1306
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:02,926
This is free publicity for N.W.A.

1307
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,512
We take this to the press and we show them

1308
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:09,391
what type of intimidation,
discrimination, and harassment

1309
01:04:09,432 --> 01:04:10,975
that we dealing with from our government.

1310
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:12,602
- I like that shit.
- I'm with that.

1311
01:04:12,727 --> 01:04:14,927
- That's a different thing.
- My nigga, I feel you.

1312
01:04:14,979 --> 01:04:17,699
- If that's what you wanna do, then we can...
- That's what I wanna do.

1313
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:20,735
That's what we wanna do, Jerry. That's it.

1314
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:23,613
That's what we wanna do.

1315
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:24,781
Okay.

1316
01:04:24,906 --> 01:04:26,950
- Yeah?
- You good?

1317
01:04:26,991 --> 01:04:28,284
I mean...

1318
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:30,870
- Hate to be the bearer of bad news...
- Mmm-hmm.

1319
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:33,039
- But 20!
- 20, man!

1320
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:35,000
Wait a minute, that ain't 20.

1321
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:37,460
- Hey, hey, hey. Shhh.
- What's up?

1322
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:39,629
Let's not get thrown out
of another fuckin' hotel.

1323
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:40,964
Goodnight, Jerry.

1324
01:04:41,297 --> 01:04:43,133
Compton's crap!

1325
01:04:43,508 --> 01:04:45,135
Go back to Compton!

1327

1328
01:04:50,598 --> 01:04:52,058
This is not music!

1329
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:55,478
Shit, the truth is,
they can do whatever they want with 'em.

1330
01:04:56,855 --> 01:04:58,148

You're gonna have to take care of 'em.
It's fine.

I'll help you take care of 'em.

1353

- Hey, Cube.
- Sorry to interrupt y'all lobster brunch.

1354
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:01,211
But what's up, E? Where the contracts at,
man? You forgot about me?

1355
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:02,814
Didn't I tell you to... You know what?

1356
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:04,547
Jerry, you want to deal with this?

1357
01:06:04,589 --> 01:06:06,091
I'm not talking to Jerry,
I'm talking to you.

1358
01:06:06,174 --> 01:06:07,384
That's Jerry's job.

1359
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:10,070
It's my department.
You're absolutely right to ask, Cube.

1360
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:12,764
The contracts are being
finalized as we speak.

1361
01:06:13,306 --> 01:06:15,975
The thing is,
with these attorneys, they'll take forever.

1362
01:06:16,142 --> 01:06:19,562
Pouring over it, they'll bleed us dry.
But, they're gonna get done.

1363
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:22,232
I wish I got paid by the hour the way they do.
You know?

1364
01:06:22,607 --> 01:06:24,192
Me, too.

1365
01:06:24,317 --> 01:06:28,613
I just want to know what's goin' on
since I did write a lot of lyrics on this record.

1366
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:32,283
Everybody knows
how important you are, Cube.

1367
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:34,494
They do?

1368
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:37,455
That's what's goin' on.

1369
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:39,791
We just need some time, that's all.

1370
01:06:43,336 --> 01:06:45,547
Everything probably all right.

1371
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:47,924
I must be trippin'.

1372
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:55,849
Shit tastes pretty good.

1373
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:58,309
Someday, right?

1374
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:02,188
Y'all enjoy your meal.

1375
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:03,273
Okay.

1376
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:12,615
I'm telling you, that guy wants
to be you very frickin' badly.

1377
01:07:12,657 --> 01:07:14,659
As if I ain't got enough fucking problems.

1378
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:16,578
Excuse me. Can I get a refill?

1379
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:18,621
At some point,
you just gotta trust somebody.

1380
01:07:19,789 --> 01:07:21,041
You know?

1381
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:24,419
You gotta trust somebody.

1382
01:07:26,629 --> 01:07:28,549
Nah, I just think
you overreacting, man.

1383
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:31,885
Eazy one of us, Cube.
What you thinkin' don't even make sense.

1384
01:07:31,968 --> 01:07:33,136
No, what don't make sense is

1385
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:37,390
Eazy and Jerry eating steak and lobster
and we eating Fatburger.

1386
01:07:37,474 --> 01:07:38,725
Shit don't make no sense.

1387
01:07:38,808 --> 01:07:42,896
Look, I hear you,
but I think we need to ride this wave.

1388
01:07:43,313 --> 01:07:44,773
For real.

1389
01:07:44,814 --> 01:07:47,014
Don't be jumping to conclusions
until you know for sure.

1390
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:49,277
You know?

1391
01:07:55,075 --> 01:07:56,910
It's my moms, man.

1392
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,472
Yo, Dre,

1393
01:08:17,847 --> 01:08:19,224
what's going on?

1394
01:08:22,686 --> 01:08:24,604
Moms just called, man.

1395
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:29,943
It's Tyree.

1396
01:08:30,985 --> 01:08:32,445
He's dead.

1397
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:34,698
What? No.

1398
01:08:36,032 --> 01:08:39,119
He got into a fight,
some motherfucker broke his neck.

1399
01:08:42,497 --> 01:08:44,541
It's my little brother, man.

1400
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:50,505
It's my little baby bro.

1401
01:09:09,774 --> 01:09:11,735
I never told y'all this.

1402
01:09:12,652 --> 01:09:15,405
But when I was 12, my sister got killed.

1403
01:09:16,573 --> 01:09:19,784
Her own husband killed her,
then killed himself.

1404
01:09:31,087 --> 01:09:33,465
This dope gang took my cousin too.

1405
01:09:37,594 --> 01:09:39,679
Shot him in the trunk of a car.

1406
01:09:42,432 --> 01:09:44,100
Fucking Compton, man.

1407
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:46,436
Come on, man, like...

1408
01:09:47,812 --> 01:09:49,314
It's my fault, man.

1409
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:51,274
Don't talk like that.

1410
01:09:51,316 --> 01:09:53,234
This never would've happened
if I had him out here, man.

1411
01:09:53,276 --> 01:09:54,361
Come on, Dre.

1412
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:55,987
It's my fuckin' fault.

1413
01:09:56,112 --> 01:09:57,947
It could've happened in another way.

1414
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:01,451
- You can't blame yourself for that, Dre.
- No.

1415
01:10:01,826 --> 01:10:04,496
Tyree gonna always be with you.
No matter what.

1416
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:07,374
- That's right.
- Yeah, for real, man.

1417
01:10:07,582 --> 01:10:09,459
And we always gonna be with you.

1418
01:10:09,626 --> 01:10:11,127
Hell yeah.

1419
01:10:11,169 --> 01:10:12,629
We always gonna be brothers.

1420
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:15,173
Fuck.

1421
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,927
We here, a'ight.

1422
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:20,470
I'm sorry, man.

1423
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:21,805
You good, Dre.

1424
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:28,978
<i>This is not on you, Andre.</i>

1425
01:10:30,647 --> 01:10:33,983
If I had just brought him on tour with me.
Like he wanted.

1426
01:10:34,025 --> 01:10:35,985
Stop this nonsense now. Stop it.

1427
01:10:37,153 --> 01:10:39,406
Your brother looked up to you,

1428
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:42,200
and you took great care of him,
we both did.

1429
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:47,038
It's time to let someone else
take care of him now.

1430
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:01,803
I'm proud of you.

1431
01:11:27,203 --> 01:11:31,249
No person shall disturb the peace
by participating or abetting

1432
01:11:31,332 --> 01:11:34,794
in any rude, indecent, drunken,

1433
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:36,838
riotous or violent conduct.

1434
01:11:37,172 --> 01:11:39,466
Or the use of any vulgar, obscene

1435
01:11:39,549 --> 01:11:41,760
or abusive language in a public place.

1436
01:11:42,218 --> 01:11:44,763
Note also, the performance of the song

1437
01:11:44,846 --> 01:11:48,808
"F the Police", will not be permitted.

1438
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:52,145
Refusal to abide
by all the Detroit City Ordinances

1439
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:55,774
will result in immediate
arrest and forfeiture.

1440
01:11:57,567 --> 01:12:00,153
Are we finished here? We got a show to do.

1441
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:06,242
Just watch yourself.

1442
01:12:09,454 --> 01:12:11,081
Eat a dick.

1443
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:13,625
It's "Fuck tha Police."

1444
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,293
<i>Straight outta Compton</i>

1449
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,929
<i>So what about the bitch
who got shot? Fuck her!</i>

1450
01:12:26,012 --> 01:12:28,348
<i>You think I give a damn
about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!</i>

1451
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:31,226
<i>This is an autobiography of the E</i>

1452
01:12:31,267 --> 01:12:32,644
<i>And if you ever fuck with me</i>

1453
01:12:32,727 --> 01:12:33,937
<i>You'll get taken</i>

1454
01:12:33,978 --> 01:12:35,897
<i>by a stupid dope brother who will smother</i>

1455
01:12:36,022 --> 01:12:38,900
<i>Word to the motherfucker

1456
01:12:42,737 --> 01:12:45,323
Eazy! Eazy!

1457
01:12:54,165 --> 01:12:56,584
<i>Damn, that shit was dope!</i>

1458
01:13:10,849 --> 01:13:12,267
What's up?

1459
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:13,810
Let's do this shit.

1460
01:13:13,893 --> 01:13:15,395
- What's up?
- Let's do this shit.

1461
01:13:16,396 --> 01:13:18,148
- Wassup? Let's go.
- What's up?

1462
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:24,487
<i>Hey, hold up, hold up.</i>

1463
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,073
<i>Y'all know
what the motherfuckin' police</i>

1464
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:28,450
<i>tried to tell us backstage?</i>

1465
01:13:28,616 --> 01:13:29,951
What?

1466
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:33,705
<i>They tried to tell us
what the fuck we can't play.</i>

1467
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:38,543
<i>Motherfuckers tried to tell us</i>

1468
01:13:39,336 --> 01:13:41,504
<i>what the fuck we can't say.</i>

1469

1472
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:57,354
<i>So, everybody,</i>

01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,856
<i>put the middle fingers high in the sky.</i>

1474
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:05,195
<i>And to the punk-ass cop backstage...</i>

1475
01:14:19,876 --> 01:14:21,044
<i>Yo, Dre.</i>

1476
01:14:21,169 --> 01:14:23,546
<i>- What up?
- I got something to say.</i>

1477
01:14:26,049 --> 01:14:27,092
<i>Fuck the police</i>

1478
01:14:27,175 --> 01:14:28,927
<i>Comin' straight from the underground</i>

1479

<i>A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown</i>

1480
01:14:31,096 --> 01:14:33,056
<i>And not the other color so police think</i>

1481
01:14:33,306 --> 01:14:35,809
<i>they have the authority to kill a minority</i>

1482

<i>Fuck that shit 'cause I ain't the one</i>

1483
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:40,397
<i>For a punk motherfucker

1484
01:14:40,438 --> 01:14:42,899
<i>to be beaten on and thrown in jail</i>

1485
01:14:43,024 --> 01:14:45,527
<i>We can go toe to toe in
the middle of a cell</i>

1486
01:14:45,568 --> 01:14:48,071
<i>Fucking with me 'cause I'm a teenager</i>

1487

<i>With a little bit of gold and a pager</i>

1488
01:14:50,407 --> 01:14:52,867
<i>Searching my car looking for the product</i>

1489
01:14:52,909 --> 01:14:55,370
<i>Thinking every nigga is selling narcotics</i>

<i>Beat a police out of shape</i>

1493
01:15:02,419 --> 01:15:03,586
<i>Then when I'm finished</i>

1494
01:15:03,628 --> 01:15:04,796
<i>Bring the yellow tape</i>

1495
01:15:05,046 --> 01:15:07,424
<i>To tape off the scene of the slaughter</i>

1496
01:15:07,465 --> 01:15:10,176
<i>Still getting swoll off bread and water</i>

1497

<i>I don't know if they fags or what</i>

1498
01:15:12,303 --> 01:15:14,431
<i>Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts</i>

1499
01:15:14,514 --> 01:15:17,392
<i>And on the other hand,
without a gun they can't get none</i>

1500
01:15:17,434 --> 01:15:19,769
<i>But don't let it be a black and a white one</i>

1501
01:15:19,853 --> 01:15:22,105
<i>'Cause they'll slam ya

<i>Just 'cause I'm from the CPT</i>

1506
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:34,451
<i>Punk police are afraid of me, huh</i>

1507
01:15:34,492 --> 01:15:36,327
<i>A young nigga on the warpath</i>

1508
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:39,247
<i>And when I'm finished,
it's gonna be a bloodbath</i>

1509
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:41,708
<i>Of cops, dyin' in LA</i>

Huh? Fuck!

Come on, nigga.

Hell no! They shootin'! Let's go!

1519
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:03,897
Go, go! All units, move in.

Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, man!

Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!

1524
01:16:18,953 --> 01:16:20,553

Shit, shit, shit, shit!

1529
01:16:28,421 --> 01:16:29,673
Get off me!

1530

Get the fuck off me!

Man, get off me, man!

Away from the ledge.

1533
01:16:40,558 --> 01:16:42,769
Backup!
We need backup in the loading area!

1534

Fuck y'all.

1538
01:16:54,322 --> 01:16:57,367
This is completely fucking illegal!
You realize that?

1539
01:16:58,201 --> 01:17:00,537
Let us go! Let me go! Come on, man.

1540
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:02,997

Fuck you! Fuck you!

Get in there!
You gotta get in there.

01:17:06,918 --> 01:17:09,337
Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police!

Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police!

1545
01:17:11,756 --> 01:17:15,552
Fuck your mama,
fuck your daddy, fuck your grandma!

1546
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:19,055
Fucking...

1547

These motherfuckers.

1548
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:28,064
Fuck y'all!

1549
01:17:43,955 --> 01:17:45,790
How do you explain
inciting a riot in Detroit?

1550
01:17:45,957 --> 01:17:47,250
What do you have to say about that?

1551
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:50,086
I have to say that we
didn't incite that shit.

1552
01:17:50,587 --> 01:17:53,840
Right. Like, y'all just got a snapshot
of how Americans really feel.

1553
01:17:53,923 --> 01:17:56,134
We gave the people a voice.

1554
01:17:56,676 --> 01:17:58,762
We gave the people truth.

1555
01:17:59,262 --> 01:18:03,600
Yeah, but your songs, they glamorize
the lifestyle of gangs, guns, drugs.

1556
01:18:03,767 --> 01:18:05,977
Our art is a reflection of our reality.

1557
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:08,438
What you see
when you go outside your door?

1558
01:18:08,855 --> 01:18:09,898
I know what I see.

1559
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:11,066
And it ain't glamorous.

1560
01:18:11,232 --> 01:18:14,110
We get AKs from Russia
and cocaine from Columbia.

1561
01:18:14,652 --> 01:18:17,030
And ain't none of us got a passport, so...

1562
01:18:18,323 --> 01:18:19,824
...might wanna check the source.

1563
01:18:20,283 --> 01:18:21,284
Next question.

1564
01:18:21,326 --> 01:18:23,686
Will you be more careful
about what you say, how you say it?

1565
01:18:23,787 --> 01:18:25,372
- No!
- Probably not. Nah.

1566
01:18:25,997 --> 01:18:28,583
Freedom of speech
includes rap music, right?

1567
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:32,295
Well, we exercising our first amendment
as far as I'm concerned.

1568
01:18:32,379 --> 01:18:34,297
And the government wrote that.

1569
01:18:35,256 --> 01:18:37,217
So, Cube, what's a guy from Compton

1570
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:39,552
do when he starts making
real money like this?

1571
01:18:45,892 --> 01:18:47,143
Cube?

1572
01:18:48,144 --> 01:18:50,146
Buy Raider gear.

1573
01:18:50,563 --> 01:18:52,607
And curl activator.

1574
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:55,193
Next question.

1575
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:12,335
Good to see you, Cube.

1576
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:14,504
I can barely see you, Jerry.

1577
01:19:15,088 --> 01:19:16,881
What's with all the <i>Godfather</i> shit?

1578
01:19:18,842 --> 01:19:20,093
Okay.

1579
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:23,263
I know that you've been very eager to sign

1580
01:19:23,346 --> 01:19:26,349
a contract with Eric's company,
Ruthless Records.

1581
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:28,351
Eric's company? Ain't it your company, too?

1582
01:19:28,601 --> 01:19:32,272
That's incorrect.
It's not my company. I work for you.

1583
01:19:32,397 --> 01:19:33,815
- You work for me?
- Uh-huh.

1584
01:19:34,024 --> 01:19:35,775
I've made that clear from the beginning.

1585
01:19:36,026 --> 01:19:37,861
All right, cool.
So, I could take this to a lawyer

1586
01:19:37,944 --> 01:19:38,987
or somebody, right?

1587
01:19:39,029 --> 01:19:41,364
Cube, those guys are paid to make trouble.

1588
01:19:41,531 --> 01:19:44,200
They're gonna create problems
where no problems exist.

1589
01:19:44,409 --> 01:19:47,120
Jerry, you know I don't know
what none of this legal shit mean.

1590
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,080
All right? None of us do.

1591
01:19:49,456 --> 01:19:51,291
So we're gonna need a lawyer
before we sign anything.

1592
01:19:51,374 --> 01:19:53,168
Everybody else has already signed.

1593
01:19:55,045 --> 01:19:56,838
I thought you knew this.

1594
01:19:57,172 --> 01:19:58,798
You're the only one who hasn't.

1595
01:20:04,387 --> 01:20:06,139
There's also this.

1596
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:08,558
$75,000.

1597
01:20:12,937 --> 01:20:14,064
Shit!

1598
01:20:14,189 --> 01:20:15,523
Sign the contract

1599
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:17,359
and all this money is yours.

1600
01:20:17,525 --> 01:20:19,986
That's my money anyway, Jerry.
I earned that money.

1601
01:20:20,403 --> 01:20:22,572
- And I wrote a lot of hit songs.
- Mmm-hmm.

1602
01:20:22,697 --> 01:20:24,574
We've been performing
on this tour for months.

1603
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:26,576
Sellin' out shows, sellin' records.

1604
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:28,870
I know there's plenty of money.

1605
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:31,247
Really? Jesus Christ.

1606
01:20:31,998 --> 01:20:33,083
Give me my money, Jerry.

1607
01:20:33,124 --> 01:20:34,626
How the hell do you think this works?

1608
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:38,421
How the hell do you think
all of this gets paid for?

1609
01:20:39,089 --> 01:20:41,591
The hotel rooms, the tour buses,

1610
01:20:41,841 --> 01:20:44,969
security, the parties, all this shit.

1611
01:20:45,053 --> 01:20:47,263
How do you think it gets paid for?
You think it's free?

1612
01:20:47,305 --> 01:20:48,932
Why are you doing this now?

1613
01:20:49,265 --> 01:20:52,102
If we were so good, why didn't you give us
contracts in the beginning?

1614
01:20:52,268 --> 01:20:54,270
Because nothing is a sure thing, Cube.

1615
01:20:55,605 --> 01:20:58,608
Even a great talent can crash and burn.

1616
01:21:01,569 --> 01:21:03,863
Too much ego, too much excess,

1617
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:05,949
too many expectations.

1618
01:21:08,243 --> 01:21:11,246
It tends to ruin things.
You ought to keep that in mind.

1619
01:21:19,921 --> 01:21:21,798
This is Eric's company, right?

1620
01:21:26,094 --> 01:21:27,345
Bye, Jerry.

1621
01:21:27,887 --> 01:21:29,389
I'm out.

1622
01:21:55,123 --> 01:21:56,583
What up, big Suge?

1623
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:58,251
Here you go.

1624
01:21:58,335 --> 01:21:59,502
Thank you, sir.

1625
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:02,797
Hey, what up with D.O.C. and Suge?

1626
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:06,384
I guess that dude
is gonna be managing him now.

1627
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,179
One day
you Bobby Brown's bodyguard,

1628
01:22:09,262 --> 01:22:11,139
and the next day, you reppin' talent.

1629
01:22:11,473 --> 01:22:12,724
Come on, man.

1630
01:22:12,849 --> 01:22:14,649
I guess everybody
wanna get into the act, huh?

1631
01:22:14,684 --> 01:22:15,852
I guess so.

1632
01:22:15,977 --> 01:22:17,354
All right, man.

1633
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:23,068
I know, right?

1634
01:22:23,693 --> 01:22:26,071
- How you doin'? You good?
- Here you go.

1635
01:22:26,154 --> 01:22:28,156
I'm helping you out all I can.
You all right?

1636
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:29,908
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1637
01:22:29,991 --> 01:22:32,077
- What's going on?
- Just happy to be home.

1638
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,453
You hungry?

1639
01:22:33,953 --> 01:22:35,038
Yeah?

1640
01:22:35,121 --> 01:22:36,706
I'll be there in a minute. All right?

1641
01:22:37,082 --> 01:22:38,333
Thanks, man.

1642
01:22:39,918 --> 01:22:41,378
- Thanks for everything, bruh.
- You bet!

1643
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:43,213
So, Cube.

1644
01:22:43,713 --> 01:22:45,048
We gonna keep
this momentum going or what?

1645
01:22:45,131 --> 01:22:46,758
Nah, man. Not like this.

1646
01:22:47,717 --> 01:22:50,387
I'd rather be broke than to get fucked.

1647
01:22:50,428 --> 01:22:52,305
I told you not to sign that shit, Dre.

1648
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:54,974
Nigga, I got bills to pay.
And you know that.

1649
01:22:55,475 --> 01:22:58,478
And I gotta put some money
in my momma's hand after Tyree passed, man.

1650
01:22:58,853 --> 01:23:00,397
- I feel you.
- Right.

1651
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:02,399
We gotta do what we gotta do.

1652
01:23:03,274 --> 01:23:05,276
They're gonna take care of you.
You their bread and butter.

1653
01:23:05,402 --> 01:23:07,112
Cube, we Ruthless.

1654
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:10,573
We N.W.A. They Ruthless.

1655
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:16,413
Cube, you comin'?

1656
01:23:17,997 --> 01:23:19,708
I'm about to get out of here.

1657
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:22,502
Take care of yourself, Dre.

1658
01:23:22,585 --> 01:23:23,753
Peace.

1659
01:23:35,765 --> 01:23:38,268
- Mom.
- I missed you.

1660
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:43,606
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

1661
01:23:43,648 --> 01:23:44,983
- Good.
- Come on. Let's get home.

1662
01:23:45,066 --> 01:23:46,443
All right.

1663
01:23:47,193 --> 01:23:48,278
So you're leaving the group?

1664
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:50,572
Yeah, I'm through with the bullshit.

1665
01:23:50,613 --> 01:23:53,992
Eazy put everything on Jerry,
Jerry put everything on Eazy.

1666
01:23:54,826 --> 01:23:56,786
It's a two-man show up there.
There ain't no fuckin' group.

1667
01:23:56,828 --> 01:24:00,206
I get that,
but I just want you to understand

1668
01:24:00,415 --> 01:24:03,376
that you are walking away
from a winning situation.

1669
01:24:04,294 --> 01:24:06,854
Now, how do you feel about this, Kim?
Is he making a big mistake?

1670
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,964
- A mistake?
- Yes.

1671
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:09,424
I don't think so, okay.

1672
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:11,968
After hearing all the stuff
that he went through, I would've left too.

1673
01:24:12,218 --> 01:24:14,971
Look, I want you to express yourself, Cube.

1674
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:17,390
And I am your biggest fan.
I believe in you.

1675
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:19,559
But I just want you to understand,

1676
01:24:19,642 --> 01:24:21,603
there's not a lot of
money in this solo play.

1677
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,146
Okay?

1678
01:24:23,396 --> 01:24:24,981
But if the first record hits,

1679
01:24:25,565 --> 01:24:27,285
I will make it up to you on the second one.

1680
01:24:35,825 --> 01:24:37,535
Be ready, Bryan.

1681
01:24:37,744 --> 01:24:39,496
These records is comin' in fast.

1682
01:24:39,662 --> 01:24:41,956
<i>I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga</i>

1683
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:45,377
<i>That's why I'm sick
of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild</i>

1684
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:46,795
<i>Fuck a punk 'cause I ain't him</i>

1685
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:49,047
<i>You gotta deal with the nine-double-M</i>

1686
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:50,799
<i>The damn scum that you all hate</i>

1687
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:53,426
<i>just think if niggas decide to retaliate</i>

1688
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:55,095
<i>They try to keep me from running up</i>

1689
01:24:55,178 --> 01:24:57,931
<i>I never tell you to get down,
it's all about coming up</i>

1690
01:24:58,014 --> 01:24:59,933
<i>So what they do, go and ban the AK?</i>

1691
01:25:00,016 --> 01:25:02,352
<i>My shit wasn't registered any fucking way</i>

1692
01:25:02,435 --> 01:25:04,521
<i>So you better duck away, run and hide out</i>

1693
01:25:04,604 --> 01:25:06,815
<i>When I'm rolling real
slow and the lights out</i>

1694
01:25:06,856 --> 01:25:09,025
<i>'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program</i>

1695
01:25:09,067 --> 01:25:11,277
<i>Shooting out the window
of a drop-top Brougham</i>

1696
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:13,363
<i>When I'm shooting let's see who drop</i>

1697
01:25:13,446 --> 01:25:15,699
<i>The police, the media,
suckers that went pop</i>

1698
01:25:15,782 --> 01:25:17,867
<i>And motherfuckers that say they too black</i>

1699
01:25:17,909 --> 01:25:20,161
<i>Put 'em overseas
they'll be begging to come back</i>

1700
01:25:20,203 --> 01:25:22,247
<i>They say he promote gangs and drugs</i>

1701
01:26:29,356 --> 01:26:32,484
You know Cube's record
is in the Top 20 <i>Billboard,</i> right now?

1702
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:36,112
Our shit never been up there.
He blowin' the fuck up, Jerry.

1703
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:37,405
It's gonna be fine, Eric.

1704
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:39,783
It's not just N.W.A anymore,

1705
01:26:40,033 --> 01:26:41,576
it's our whole Ruthless roster.

1706
01:26:41,659 --> 01:26:45,163
We got D.O.C.,
we got Michel'le, we got Above the Law.

1707
01:26:45,455 --> 01:26:47,624
We're moving up to the next level.

1708
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:49,683
You know what? Sit down for two seconds.

1709
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:51,211
Look, we need to keep Dre happy.

1710
01:26:51,294 --> 01:26:52,712
Yeah.

1711
01:26:53,463 --> 01:26:54,547
Look at him.

1712
01:26:54,631 --> 01:26:56,551
You think he needs
any more motivation than that?

1713
01:26:56,591 --> 01:26:57,634
I mean, I get it, Jerry.

1714
01:26:57,717 --> 01:26:59,928
He drownin' in pussy and shit,
but that don't mean that he...

1715
01:26:59,969 --> 01:27:02,972
Now, you worry too much. Stop, okay?

1716
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:04,432
Yeah, ar'ight.

1717
01:27:04,474 --> 01:27:05,975
Here, sign some checks.

1718
01:27:06,851 --> 01:27:08,395
- Right now, Jerry?
- Yes, right now.

1719
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:09,854
- You're gonna be out of your mind later.
- Come on.

1720
01:27:09,979 --> 01:27:11,147
Do it now.

1721
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:13,483
The fact is,
Ren is as good a writer as Cube.

1722
01:27:13,566 --> 01:27:14,901
Maybe even better.

1723
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:16,319
We got everything covered.

1724
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:18,655
Just the last one. Okay?

1725
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,742
- We finished here, Jerry?
- We're finished.

1726
01:27:23,243 --> 01:27:26,287
Good. 'Cause I'm about to go fuck.

1727
01:27:28,164 --> 01:27:29,791
- Ar'ight.
- Yeah.

1728
01:28:09,456 --> 01:28:11,207
Now I'm only telling you what you told me.

1729
01:28:11,374 --> 01:28:13,084
If <i>AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted</i> blew up,

1730
01:28:13,168 --> 01:28:15,045
you'd pay me the advance for the follow-up.

1731
01:28:15,211 --> 01:28:16,546
Now is that not what the fuck you said?

1732
01:28:16,588 --> 01:28:18,006
That is what I said.

1733
01:28:18,048 --> 01:28:19,966
But it is more complicated than that, Cube.

1734
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:21,051
Right, there are metrics...

1735
01:28:21,092 --> 01:28:22,135
Come on, Bryan!

1736
01:28:22,218 --> 01:28:24,763
I got a baby on the way
and a house I just paid for

1737
01:28:24,846 --> 01:28:26,598
off the strength of what you told me.

1738
01:28:26,765 --> 01:28:28,224
I mean, you gave me your word!

1739
01:28:28,266 --> 01:28:29,726
Cube, would you just calm down?

1740
01:28:29,809 --> 01:28:30,852
Calm down?

1741
01:28:30,894 --> 01:28:32,395
I am just trying to give you what you want.

1742
01:28:32,437 --> 01:28:34,105
You not. I been did the work...

1743
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:37,025
I gave you the product.
Give me my money, Bryan!

1744
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:40,737
When a man does the job,
he's supposed to get paid,

1745
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:43,990
and you making it seem like I'm beggin'
for some shit that's technically mine.

1746
01:28:44,074 --> 01:28:46,659
Of course you are not begging.

1747
01:28:46,743 --> 01:28:50,163
And I am not trying to be difficult, man.
I promise you.

1748
01:28:52,957 --> 01:28:54,793
But you can't help me, right?

1749
01:28:56,086 --> 01:28:58,254
That's what you telling me?

1750
01:28:59,631 --> 01:29:01,257
My hands are tied, man.

1751
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:31,538
Hey!

1752
01:29:32,997 --> 01:29:35,041
Shoulda kept your word, Bryan.

1753
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:38,169
Jesus Christ, man!

1754
01:29:38,586 --> 01:29:40,755
What the fuck are you doing, Cube?

1755
01:29:40,922 --> 01:29:41,923
Goddamn!

1756
01:29:43,258 --> 01:29:45,885
I will get you your money, man.
Just... God damn it!

1757
01:29:45,969 --> 01:29:47,846
You think I give a fuck
about these fucking records?

1758
01:29:47,929 --> 01:29:50,306
I put up these fuckin' records!
This my shit!

1759
01:29:50,473 --> 01:29:53,059
I know that, Cube!
I will get you your money!

1760
01:29:53,143 --> 01:29:54,811
God damn it! I'm sorry.

1761
01:29:54,894 --> 01:29:56,146
Now I'm gonna fuck up your shit.

1762
01:29:56,187 --> 01:29:57,313
Look, do not...

1763
01:29:58,982 --> 01:30:00,191
God damn it!

1764
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,572
Just, fine.

1765
01:30:07,282 --> 01:30:09,409
Take it out what you owe me.

1766
01:30:09,659 --> 01:30:11,494
Just...

1767
01:30:21,463 --> 01:30:22,881
<i>Prisoner like a hostage</i>

1768
01:30:23,048 --> 01:30:25,717
<i>Yo, you shoulda covered
your muthafucking head like an ostrich</i>

1769
01:30:25,925 --> 01:30:27,761
<i>Deep in the dirt 'cause you's a sucker</i>

1770
01:30:27,927 --> 01:30:30,263
<i>And your ass up high
so I can kick the muthafucker</i>

1771
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:32,265
<i>Don't try to hang your best abroad</i>

1772
01:30:32,432 --> 01:30:34,992
<i>'Cause my foot will be so
far up your ass, you'll get hemorrhoids</i>

1773
01:30:35,101 --> 01:30:36,561
<i>Before you try to fuck wit Ren</i>

1774
01:30:36,978 --> 01:30:38,897
See that shit right there?
That's what I'm talking about.

1775
01:30:39,064 --> 01:30:40,815
Fuck that nigga Cube, man.
That nigga ain't shit.

1776
01:30:40,982 --> 01:30:43,651
How you figure, man?
His record the hottest shit out right now, E.

1777
01:30:43,818 --> 01:30:46,112
Yeah, man, for real. Cube killed that shit.

1778
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:48,656
So we supposed to
just sit there and not say nothin',

1779
01:30:48,698 --> 01:30:50,033
and look like bitches and just take it?

1780
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,701
Take what?

1781
01:30:51,868 --> 01:30:55,288
I don't know what the fuck you talkin' about.
I like that shit.

1782
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,083
Clown-ass.

1783
01:30:58,166 --> 01:30:59,876
Why you drunk all the goddamn time?

1784
01:30:59,959 --> 01:31:02,212
You need to get your shit together.
You's a motherfucking' artist,

1785
01:31:02,253 --> 01:31:03,672
if you ain't noticed.

1786
01:31:04,589 --> 01:31:06,925
How about you get
your shit together, little nigga.

1787
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:08,051
Come on.

1788
01:31:08,176 --> 01:31:10,220
How about you get
your country-ass homeboy.

1789
01:31:10,387 --> 01:31:13,306
<i>'Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs

<i>They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggaz pick up your record</i>

1791
01:31:16,434 --> 01:31:18,186

1792
01:31:30,323 --> 01:31:31,408
Hello.

1793
01:31:31,449 --> 01:31:33,535
<i>Yo, Dre. D.O.C. was in an accident.</i>

1794
01:31:33,702 --> 01:31:36,121
What? An accident?

1795
01:31:45,213 --> 01:31:46,589
D.O.C. shouldn't even be alive.

1796
01:31:46,756 --> 01:31:48,633
Got thrown out a car, hit a tree.

1797
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,176
Is he paralyzed?

1798
01:31:50,343 --> 01:31:53,471
<i>No. But his throat got crushed.</i>

1799
01:31:53,638 --> 01:31:55,765
He could lose his career over this.

1800
01:31:57,934 --> 01:31:59,894
Where your people? Where Eazy and Jerry?

1801
01:32:00,061 --> 01:32:02,313
How the fuck should I know?

1802
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,732
Come here.

1803
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,194
Whatchu know about Jerry?
Whatchu think about him?

1804
01:32:08,361 --> 01:32:10,947
He a'ight. I guess.

1805
01:32:11,114 --> 01:32:13,825
What about your paperwork?
You cool with that?

1806
01:32:16,077 --> 01:32:17,078
I think.

1807
01:32:17,245 --> 01:32:18,288
You think?

1808
01:32:18,329 --> 01:32:20,331
Look, I just focus on the music, Suge.

1809
01:32:20,915 --> 01:32:22,459
That's it.

1810
01:32:22,959 --> 01:32:25,503
You see that motherfucker in there?

1811
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:29,424
Gotta make sure it don't
happen to you, man.

1812
01:32:32,177 --> 01:32:33,678
Hey, uh...

1813
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:38,683
Maybe some of your people
can look into my paperwork, too.

1814
01:32:41,102 --> 01:32:42,562
Most definitely.

1815
01:32:42,729 --> 01:32:44,481
I'll arrange.

1816
01:32:44,647 --> 01:32:46,191
Go see your boy.

1817
01:32:56,242 --> 01:32:57,994
This place is nice.

1818
01:32:58,036 --> 01:33:01,998
You're nice.
I figured I'd take you to a nice place,

1819
01:33:02,082 --> 01:33:04,209
- Ms. Record Executive.
- Mmm.

1820
01:33:04,292 --> 01:33:06,753
Um, record executive assistant.

1821
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:08,463
But, damn.

1822
01:33:09,172 --> 01:33:12,801
I didn't realize we was going on
like a "date" date.

1823
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:14,844
I don't even know how to take that.

1824
01:33:14,928 --> 01:33:18,181
I got my collared shirt on.
I brought you to this nice restaurant. Really?

1825
01:33:18,264 --> 01:33:21,017
Okay. That is not the
kind of collared shirt

1826
01:33:21,142 --> 01:33:22,560
they was talking about.

1827
01:33:22,644 --> 01:33:23,853
It's cute, though.

1828
01:33:23,937 --> 01:33:26,648
And you didn't take off
your hat like they asked you to.

1829
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:28,024
And I'm not.

1830
01:33:28,108 --> 01:33:30,652
- Oh, really?
- I ain't taking off my hat for nobody.

1831
01:33:30,694 --> 01:33:32,737
I think they know that.

1832
01:33:32,821 --> 01:33:33,822
So what?

1833
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:37,492
You bring all your little
females here, don't you?

1834
01:33:37,784 --> 01:33:39,202
The special ones.

1835
01:33:41,705 --> 01:33:42,706
Okay.

1836
01:33:44,207 --> 01:33:47,961
I'm playing. I'm playing.
There you go getting sensitive.

1837
01:33:48,294 --> 01:33:49,921
You don't have to try to impress me.

1838
01:33:50,422 --> 01:33:52,590
We could've went to Fatburger.

1839
01:33:53,049 --> 01:33:55,051
Go to Fatburger?

1840
01:33:55,552 --> 01:33:58,555
Hey! You got a haircut. I love it.

1841
01:33:59,556 --> 01:34:00,724
How's that new house treating you?

1842
01:34:00,807 --> 01:34:02,392
It's great. Thanks for asking.

1843
01:34:03,143 --> 01:34:06,146
So, how you liking your new decor?

1844
01:34:06,312 --> 01:34:07,313
Great.

1845
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,399
Yeah, I never did like
the old design anyway, you know?

1846
01:34:09,566 --> 01:34:10,859
What you got for me, Bryan?

1847
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,620
I know you called me up here for somethin'.

1848
01:34:14,070 --> 01:34:15,196
Yeah.

1849
01:34:15,572 --> 01:34:16,740
Uh...

1850
01:34:18,408 --> 01:34:19,993
It's N.W.A's new record.

1851
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,955
I wanted to play it for you first,
before you hear it anywhere else.

1852
01:34:25,248 --> 01:34:27,542
<i>Break me, take me
But watch me pull the trigger</i>

1853
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,836
<i>Dre is just a nigga with
heart a nigga that's smart</i>

1854
01:34:29,919 --> 01:34:32,589
<i>A nigga that's paid to say
what others are scared to play</i>

1855
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:36,134
<i>We started out with too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold</i>

1856
01:34:36,259 --> 01:34:37,385
<i>Yo, N.W...</i>

1857
01:34:37,594 --> 01:34:38,762
Benedict Arnold?

1858
01:34:40,597 --> 01:34:42,557
Are they trying to say
that you're like a traitor?

I don't know about all that.

01:38:14,477 --> 01:38:18,148
Fine, you do that.
You call Dre, and you guys go do that.

1940
01:38:18,314 --> 01:38:19,607

So, wassup?

1993
01:42:02,163 --> 01:42:06,167
When you talked to me on the phone, man,
you sounded pretty worked up.

Yeah, I know you don't

It's about Jerry.
We gotta get rid of that motherfucker, E.

1996
01:42:18,847 --> 01:42:20,932
That's really why you came here?

1997
01:42:21,725 --> 01:42:24,310
I thought all this shit
was in the past, Dre.

1998
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:30,400
I found some real shit, man. And the shit's
been happening since the beginning.

1999

Do you even know why you rich, though?

2001

ain't sleepin' on your
auntie's couch no more?

2003
01:42:39,909 --> 01:42:42,495
Because Jerry made that possible for us.

2004
01:42:42,662 --> 01:42:45,582
He kicked down the door
for that shit to happen. For us!

2005
01:42:45,749 --> 01:42:47,751
And you just gonna turn your back on him?
What, you Cube now?

2006
01:42:47,834 --> 01:42:49,377
Cube was right, fool!

2007
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:54,424
E, look at the papers, man,
and you'll see what the fuck I'm talking about.

01:42:55,592 --> 01:42:58,970
And forget about Jerry, man!
You keep talking about Jerry this, Jerry that.

2009
01:42:59,054 --> 01:43:02,515
We didn't make it because of Jerry,
we made it because our shit is dope!

2010
01:43:04,517 --> 01:43:06,227
And we can keep going, E.

2011
01:43:06,269 --> 01:43:10,482
We can own the goddamn world,
but we just can't be fucking with him no more.

2012
01:43:12,734 --> 01:43:15,278
Man, we started this N.W.A shit.

2013
01:43:18,114 --> 01:43:19,741
I just want it to be right.

2014
01:43:20,575 --> 01:43:22,452
And this what you think right?

2015
01:43:23,495 --> 01:43:26,164
Turnin' your back on somebody
after all he done for us.

2016
01:43:26,873 --> 01:43:28,833
You mean all he done for you.

2017
01:43:30,126 --> 01:43:31,211
Right?

2018
01:43:33,171 --> 01:43:34,255
Look at me.

2019
01:43:36,966 --> 01:43:38,093
Look at me.

2020
01:43:42,806 --> 01:43:44,140
When Tyree died,

2021
01:43:46,893 --> 01:43:49,062
you said we was always gonna be brothers.

2022
01:43:51,106 --> 01:43:53,233
I guess you forgot about that.

2023
01:43:56,319 --> 01:43:58,697
I'mma start my own company
with Suge Knight, E.

2024
01:44:12,836 --> 01:44:14,921
Thought we were brothers, man.

2025
01:44:42,615 --> 01:44:43,825
What up, Dre?

2026
01:44:43,867 --> 01:44:45,994
This Death Row. We about to do this shit.

2027
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:54,210
This shit sound good.

2028
01:44:54,836 --> 01:44:59,341
Yeah. None of it means anything
while I'm under contract with Ruthless.

2029
01:44:59,883 --> 01:45:01,843
I told you about that.

2030
01:45:02,010 --> 01:45:04,471
I'mma get you outta your contracts,
I promise you.

2031
01:45:05,889 --> 01:45:07,307
Yeah, ar'ight.

2032
01:45:13,521 --> 01:45:14,981
What up with you, cuz?

2033
01:45:15,148 --> 01:45:16,566
Wuddup?

2034
01:45:16,733 --> 01:45:17,817
What up, Lo?

2035
01:45:17,901 --> 01:45:19,110
Wuddup, Dre?

2036
01:45:19,235 --> 01:45:21,321
- Wassup, Warren?
- Chilin' man.

2037
01:45:21,488 --> 01:45:22,808
- You good?
- I'm great. You good?

2038
01:45:22,906 --> 01:45:24,407
- All right.
- Dr. Dre.

2039
01:45:24,574 --> 01:45:26,242
- 'Sup?
- Wuddup with you?

2040
01:45:26,326 --> 01:45:27,410
What's goin' on, man?

2041
01:45:27,619 --> 01:45:28,703
Yeah, yeah.

2042
01:45:28,787 --> 01:45:31,247
So, look, I listened to your demo.

2043
01:45:31,998 --> 01:45:33,375
It was tight.

2044
01:45:34,709 --> 01:45:37,087
You see that little look he gave me?

2045
01:45:37,253 --> 01:45:40,590
Yo, yo, yo, hold up.
Who the fuck is this guy?

2046
01:45:40,757 --> 01:45:43,009
My bad, Suge. This the homie, Snoop.

2047
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:46,096
Snoop D-O-double-G, cuz. Who you?

2048
01:45:46,262 --> 01:45:47,555
What? What up?

2049
01:45:47,722 --> 01:45:49,099
What the fuck you say, Blood?

2050
01:45:49,265 --> 01:45:52,394
Hold on! Hold on, hold on.
He with me. He with me.

2051
01:45:53,353 --> 01:45:54,437
He ain't with me.

2052
01:45:54,521 --> 01:45:57,941
Nah! He here to work, ar'ight?
This is business, Suge. Come on, man.

2053
01:45:58,108 --> 01:46:00,944
Anyway, what's this
you workin' on, cuz, I like this.

2054
01:46:01,111 --> 01:46:02,737
So look, you know...

2055
01:46:02,779 --> 01:46:05,407
It's a new track for this new movie.
It's called <i>Deep Cover.</i>

2056
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:07,867
- Woo-wee.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

2057
01:46:08,034 --> 01:46:09,786
- For a movie, huh?
- Yeah, a movie.

2058
01:46:09,953 --> 01:46:12,288
Dre doing big shit. Okay, okay, okay.

2059
01:46:12,455 --> 01:46:14,499
You think you can get down on it?

2060
01:46:14,582 --> 01:46:17,961
Oh, most definitely.
Throw me in the booth one time.

2061
01:46:18,628 --> 01:46:19,796
All right.

2062
01:46:24,968 --> 01:46:28,304
<i>It's perhaps the most notorious
police brutality case in recent memory.</i>

2063
01:46:28,471 --> 01:46:32,308
<i>Those blows from
Officer Powell and Officer Wind's batons</i>

2064
01:46:32,475 --> 01:46:38,231
<i>continued and continued for no just reason.</i>

2065
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:40,692
They just let them people do
whatever the hell they want.

2066
01:46:42,068 --> 01:46:44,446
<i>Rodney King's leg
and facial bones were broken.</i>

2067
01:46:44,487 --> 01:46:48,742
<i>Three of the four accused officers took
the stand and admitted that it was brutal,</i>

2068
01:46:48,908 --> 01:46:51,828
<i>but said, "Police work is brutal."
And that the video tape only showed that.</i>

2069
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:53,038
Here.

2070
01:46:53,121 --> 01:46:54,956
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

2071
01:46:55,123 --> 01:46:56,499
You watchin' this shit upstairs?

2072
01:46:56,666 --> 01:46:57,667
Hello?

2073
01:46:57,751 --> 01:46:58,835
<i>Yo, it's Suge.</i>

2074
01:46:58,877 --> 01:47:00,317
<i>We gotta talk about these contracts.</i>

2075
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:02,589
Why you don't talk to
Jerry about that shit?

2076
01:47:02,756 --> 01:47:06,801
<i>I don't wanna talk to Jerry.
It's your company. You the man.</i>

2077
01:47:07,344 --> 01:47:11,890
Ar'ight. Whatever, man.
I'll be through there.

2078
01:47:15,518 --> 01:47:17,437
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

2079
01:47:17,604 --> 01:47:19,244
<i>...right across the top of the cheekbone,</i>

2080
01:47:19,314 --> 01:47:21,608
<i>splitting his face
from the top of his ear to his chin.</i>

2081
01:47:29,532 --> 01:47:30,533
Where Dre at?

2082
01:47:31,534 --> 01:47:32,869
You said he was gonna be here.

2083
01:47:33,036 --> 01:47:35,455
I'll get with you outside.

2084
01:47:35,622 --> 01:47:37,582
Don't worry about Dre.

2085
01:47:37,749 --> 01:47:41,044
Truth be told,
he got nothing to do with this.

2086
01:47:47,133 --> 01:47:48,885
This what's gonna happen.

2087
01:47:50,387 --> 01:47:54,641
You gonna sign these,
releasing Dre and D.O.C. from Ruthless.

2088
01:47:59,437 --> 01:48:00,897
Whatever, homie.

2089
01:48:04,401 --> 01:48:07,278
Think I'm signing that?
You crazier than I thought you was.

2090
01:48:07,445 --> 01:48:08,655
I'm out.

2091
01:48:12,909 --> 01:48:15,078
Get your ass up.

2092
01:48:15,245 --> 01:48:18,581
Nah. I think you're gonna
stay here for a while.

2093
01:48:18,748 --> 01:48:22,293
Fuck you, Suge!
Y'all niggas don't scare me.

2094
01:48:22,377 --> 01:48:26,756
You can talk tough all you want,
but this ain't no record.

2095
01:48:27,632 --> 01:48:29,300
Don't make me change you, Eric.

2096
01:48:29,467 --> 01:48:30,969
Fuck that's supposed to mean?

2097
01:48:31,136 --> 01:48:33,430
Keep talkin',
you're gonna fuck around and get smoked.

2098
01:48:33,596 --> 01:48:36,599
Nah, nah.
But you better choose right.

2099
01:48:36,766 --> 01:48:40,603
You know where the fuck I'm from.
This Bompton, nigga.

2100
01:49:07,797 --> 01:49:09,632
Oh, my fucking God.

2101
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:11,426
Eric.

2102
01:49:11,968 --> 01:49:13,720
Jesus Christ.

2103
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:18,600
What the hell are you doing here?
You can't sneak in here like that.

2104
01:49:18,808 --> 01:49:20,643
I thought you were...

2105
01:49:22,145 --> 01:49:25,315
Oh, my God. What's going on, man?
Are you okay?

2106
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:28,610
What happened to your face?

2107
01:49:28,651 --> 01:49:31,363
I gotta kill this motherfucker,
Suge Knight.

2108
01:49:33,156 --> 01:49:35,950
I just came here to let you know,

2109
01:49:35,992 --> 01:49:39,621
'cause shit might get a little thick.
I need to stay protected.

2110
01:49:40,497 --> 01:49:43,792
No, you're not gonna do that. No.

2111
01:49:43,833 --> 01:49:46,127
I didn't come here to ask for permission.

2112
01:49:46,419 --> 01:49:48,588
I came here to let you know.

2113
01:49:49,172 --> 01:49:51,383
You wanted to be involved
with this gangster shit?

2114
01:49:51,841 --> 01:49:52,884
Here we go.

2115
01:49:52,967 --> 01:49:56,179
You do that and you're gonna ruin
everything we've worked for.

2116
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:01,184
You really think I got a fucking choice?

2117
01:50:01,267 --> 01:50:02,852
Look at my face!

2118
01:50:04,979 --> 01:50:07,524
This the streets. Motherfuckers came at me!

2119
01:50:07,565 --> 01:50:09,901
Came at us!

2120
01:50:09,984 --> 01:50:11,861
If I don't hit back, we finished.
It's over.

2121
01:50:11,903 --> 01:50:13,822
I'm not saying that we're
not gonna hit back.

2122
01:50:13,863 --> 01:50:15,865
But this is not Compton,

2123
01:50:17,075 --> 01:50:18,576
if you haven't looked around.

2124
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:20,912
Drop that shit, okay?

2125
01:50:21,538 --> 01:50:24,541
We don't hit back with bullets,
we hit back with lawyers.

2126
01:50:24,582 --> 01:50:25,959
We drain these assholes.

2127
01:50:26,042 --> 01:50:28,253
That really takes 'em down.

2128
01:50:28,336 --> 01:50:30,171
It ain't about the money, Jerry!

2129
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,174
I don't care about no money.

2130
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:36,052
Of course it is. And you should
fucking care about the money.

2131
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:40,223
You're so much smarter
than these fuckin' thugs.

2132
01:50:40,265 --> 01:50:41,766
You wanna kill somebody?

2133
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:43,601
You're gonna go to jail forever.

2134
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:49,357
No more family,
no more Ruthless, no more anything.

2135
01:50:49,399 --> 01:50:51,568
If you kill this man,
his problems will be over

2136
01:50:51,609 --> 01:50:54,112
and yours will just be beginning.

2137
01:50:54,195 --> 01:50:56,114
Don't be a fuckin' fool.

2138
01:50:57,032 --> 01:50:58,033
Hey.

2139
01:50:59,576 --> 01:51:02,454
Why the fuck I gotta be the bigger man?

2140
01:51:03,413 --> 01:51:05,248
'Cause it's better than
you being a dead man.

2141
01:51:05,707 --> 01:51:08,043
I don't want you fuckin' dead.

2142
01:51:46,039 --> 01:51:47,374
You okay?

2143
01:51:53,463 --> 01:51:55,048
Baby. Let me see.

2144
01:53:05,785 --> 01:53:08,204
- Why you so tense, Dre?
- No, I'm cool.

2145
01:53:09,205 --> 01:53:10,582
Man. No, you're not, man.

2146
01:53:10,665 --> 01:53:12,500
You've been in that house, what?
A month now?

2147
01:53:12,542 --> 01:53:15,045
Nigga, and not one track?
I mean, what's up?

2148
01:53:15,670 --> 01:53:17,547
There's too much interference.

2149
01:53:17,589 --> 01:53:20,050
Man, you know how they
tryin' to starve me out.

2150
01:53:20,425 --> 01:53:22,344
Playin' games with
my motherfuckin' money, man.

2151
01:53:22,385 --> 01:53:24,929
That's why the house
was so goddamned empty.

2152
01:53:26,056 --> 01:53:29,142
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'm fucking with you, cuz. Hit this.

2153
01:53:29,934 --> 01:53:31,978
- All right, man, give me that shit.
- Here.

2154
01:53:32,062 --> 01:53:33,897
Fuck I'm taking about.

2155
01:53:35,106 --> 01:53:37,567
Have you feeling righteously together.

2156
01:53:40,236 --> 01:53:41,237
- Holy shit.
- Oh, hell no. Give me that.

2157
01:53:41,321 --> 01:53:45,367
Goddamn, man!
What the fuck is in this shit, Snoops?

2158
01:53:45,825 --> 01:53:48,912
- That right there, that's that chronic, cuz.
- Yeah.

2159
01:53:50,121 --> 01:53:52,123
- Chronic.
- Yes, sir.

2160
01:53:52,207 --> 01:53:54,125
- Let me hit that once.
- Yeah.

2161
01:53:54,209 --> 01:53:56,795
- Look it.
- Wow, man.

2162
01:53:58,004 --> 01:54:00,965
- All right. Let's head back to the studio.
- Let's go.

2163
01:54:01,049 --> 01:54:02,342
I got something for this.

2164
01:54:23,988 --> 01:54:26,991
Damn, Dre.
What the fuck is that? Feeling that shit.

2165
01:54:27,075 --> 01:54:28,451
- Yeah. You feelin' it?
- Yeah!

2166
01:54:28,493 --> 01:54:30,662
Hey, hey, look,
I'mma spit a little something.

2167
01:54:30,745 --> 01:54:31,746
You feel me? You say whatever...

2168
01:54:31,788 --> 01:54:33,123
You just jump in, nigga, and just...

2169
01:54:33,164 --> 01:54:34,884
Hold on, look, I got something. Here we go.

2170
01:54:36,418 --> 01:54:38,962
<i>One, two, three and to the four</i>

2171
01:54:39,004 --> 01:54:41,506
<i>Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door</i>

2172
01:54:41,589 --> 01:54:43,883
<i>Ready to make an entrance so back on up</i>

2173
01:54:43,967 --> 01:54:45,802
<i>'Cause you know we about to rip shit up</i>

2174
01:54:45,844 --> 01:54:46,970
<i>Give me the microphone first</i>

2175
01:54:47,012 --> 01:54:48,638
<i>so I could bust like a bubble</i>

2176
01:54:48,722 --> 01:54:50,306
<i>Compton and Long Beach together</i>

2177
01:54:50,348 --> 01:54:51,558
<i>now you know you in trouble</i>

2178
01:54:51,641 --> 01:54:54,144
<i>Ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby</i>

2179
01:54:54,227 --> 01:54:56,646
<i>Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy</i>

2180
01:54:56,730 --> 01:54:59,441
<i>Death Row is the label that pays me</i>

2181
01:54:59,482 --> 01:55:01,901
<i>Un-fadable so please
don't try and fade this</i>

2182
01:55:01,985 --> 01:55:04,404
<i>But back to the lecture at hand</i>

2183
01:55:04,487 --> 01:55:05,697
<i>Perfection is perfected...</i>

2184
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:07,407
I want to thank you
for having us here.

2185
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:10,010
- Of course.
- Very generous for you to give your time

2186
01:55:10,076 --> 01:55:12,412
with everything that's going on right now.

2187
01:55:12,495 --> 01:55:13,788
Not a problem.

2188
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:15,373
Now if I may,

2189
01:55:16,666 --> 01:55:18,001
are you anti-Semitic?

2190
01:55:19,711 --> 01:55:21,751
Now, I thought
this was about the Rodney King trial.

2191
01:55:22,005 --> 01:55:23,840
Well, the JDL recently got involved

2192
01:55:23,923 --> 01:55:26,801
citing the lyrics about
your former manager Jerry Heller.

2193
01:55:26,843 --> 01:55:30,388
I'm not anti-Semitic.
I'm anti-Jerry Heller.

2194
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:31,681
Let me ask you something.

2195
01:55:31,765 --> 01:55:35,435
Do the JDL condone Jerry's behavior
when it comes to my situation?

2196
01:55:35,518 --> 01:55:38,271
Him trying to get me to sign a contract
without legal representation?

2197
01:55:38,938 --> 01:55:40,023
I have no idea.

2198
01:55:40,065 --> 01:55:41,524
I didn't think you did.

2199
01:55:41,566 --> 01:55:44,486
But when you got that for me,
we can continue on this topic.

2200
01:55:44,527 --> 01:55:49,699
Until then, I'm here to talk about the
beating of an unarmed motorist, Rodney King.

2201
01:55:49,783 --> 01:55:55,038
And four guilty LAPD officers
who seem to be Daryl Gates' standard issue.

2202
01:55:56,414 --> 01:55:58,541
It's also the LAPD and the FBI

2203
01:55:58,583 --> 01:56:01,628
who feel that your negative portrayal
of police condones violence.

2204
01:56:01,711 --> 01:56:04,631
"Fuck Tha Police" is just a warning,
that's it.

2205
01:56:04,714 --> 01:56:08,051
You can't treat people like that
and expect 'em not to rise up.

2206
01:56:08,385 --> 01:56:10,345
I'm a journalist just like you.

2207
01:56:10,387 --> 01:56:12,305
Reporting what's goin' on in the hood.

2208
01:56:12,389 --> 01:56:15,392
The only thing that's different
is that I'm brutally honest.

2209
01:56:17,852 --> 01:56:20,230
What's your relationship
with the Nation of Islam?

2210
01:56:21,231 --> 01:56:22,732
They my brothers.

2211
01:56:22,774 --> 01:56:24,901
You know what?
That question right there proves to me

2212
01:56:24,943 --> 01:56:27,779
what kind of a unprepared
sandbag reporter you are.

2213
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:30,073
You talkin' to me
like I'm some elected official.

2214
01:56:30,115 --> 01:56:32,200
Like I'm running for office.

2215
01:56:32,242 --> 01:56:34,119
But I get it, that's your job.

2216
01:56:34,202 --> 01:56:36,621
Bigger the story,
the bigger the check in your field of work.

2217
01:56:37,163 --> 01:56:39,763
It's not your fault, I shouldn't blame you.
What's your name, man?

2218
01:56:40,834 --> 01:56:41,918
Brian.

2219
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:44,963
Eat a dick, Brian.
Get the fuck out my house. Y'all done here.

2220
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:47,257
Can we cut, please?

2221
01:57:58,703 --> 01:58:00,997
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

2222
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:02,248
You look like you ready to go.

2223
01:58:02,332 --> 01:58:05,502
Yeah. I'm just waiting on my friend.
I should've drove.

2224
01:58:05,585 --> 01:58:06,836
You're not havin' a good time?

2225
01:58:06,878 --> 01:58:09,089
No! No. I had a really good time,

2226
01:58:09,172 --> 01:58:11,841
but now it's starting to get a little wild.

2227
01:58:12,175 --> 01:58:13,176
Yeah.

2228
01:58:13,259 --> 01:58:15,512
We've been known to get crazy
from time to time.

2229
01:58:17,639 --> 01:58:18,640
I'm Andre.

2230
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:20,684
I'm Nicole.

2231
01:58:22,394 --> 01:58:24,521
Come on, man. Lighten up.

2232
01:58:26,106 --> 01:58:29,192
We're about to get back in the game.
Big time.

2233
01:58:29,234 --> 01:58:30,652
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2234
01:58:31,403 --> 01:58:32,404
How do you figure?

2235
01:58:33,405 --> 01:58:37,158
Are you trying to piss me off?
Come on. God almighty.

2236
01:58:37,367 --> 01:58:39,536
Did you forget about Ren's new album?

2237
01:58:39,619 --> 01:58:43,373
Or did you forget about the fact
that you are working on something

2238
01:58:43,415 --> 01:58:46,459
I think is gonna be bigger
than anything N.W.A ever did.

2239
01:58:46,543 --> 01:58:48,211
All I know... Mmm!

2240
01:58:49,921 --> 01:58:51,965
Fucking Cube out here,

2241
01:58:52,590 --> 01:58:55,593
- doing it big. Making movies and shit.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2242
01:58:55,677 --> 01:58:58,013
Then I keep hearing about
this album Dre about to drop.

2243
01:58:58,054 --> 01:59:00,932
Dre is a fucking producer, Eric.

2244
01:59:01,016 --> 01:59:03,018
Producers don't rap.

2245
01:59:03,059 --> 01:59:06,062
We have him under contract.
He can't do anything.

2246
01:59:06,354 --> 01:59:07,564
Cheer up.

2247
01:59:08,314 --> 01:59:10,316
Eat, drink and be merry.

2248
01:59:10,692 --> 01:59:11,776
- Suge.
- Hey.

2249
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:13,695
- How you doin'?
- All right.

2250
01:59:13,737 --> 01:59:16,197
Jimmy Iovine, Interscope Records.
Nice to meet you.

2251
01:59:16,239 --> 01:59:17,240
You, too.

2252
01:59:17,323 --> 01:59:20,201
So, what do I call you?
Dre? Dr. Dre? Doc?

2253
01:59:21,411 --> 01:59:23,288
Nah, Dre is cool. Go ahead, have a seat.

2254
01:59:23,371 --> 01:59:24,372
All right.

2255
01:59:24,414 --> 01:59:25,457
- It's good.
- Yeah.

2256
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:26,875
So what do you got today?

2257
01:59:26,916 --> 01:59:27,917
Um...

2258
01:59:28,752 --> 01:59:30,211
Well, you know...

2259
01:59:30,253 --> 01:59:34,549
I heard John McClain gave you my album.
What'd you think?

2260
01:59:34,924 --> 01:59:36,134
I think it was great.

2261
01:59:38,345 --> 01:59:41,765
So, you're the artist on the record.
Who produced it?

2262
01:59:42,932 --> 01:59:44,351
I did.

2263
01:59:44,434 --> 01:59:46,353
Okay. And who mixed it?

2264
01:59:46,561 --> 01:59:48,980
Come on, man. I did.

2265
01:59:50,315 --> 01:59:51,316
Huh.

2266
01:59:52,609 --> 01:59:53,610
Listen, um...

2267
01:59:54,027 --> 01:59:55,612
I don't know anything about hip-hop,

2268
01:59:55,779 --> 01:59:57,781
but I know that this is special.

2269
01:59:58,448 --> 01:59:59,616
Seriously.

2270
02:00:00,617 --> 02:00:01,618
Thank you.

2271
02:00:02,535 --> 02:00:04,495
Hey, look, we'd love
to bring in Interscope,

2272
02:00:04,829 --> 02:00:06,331
but there's a little problem.

2273
02:00:06,706 --> 02:00:07,791
What's the problem?

2274
02:00:07,874 --> 02:00:10,460
Ruthless, lawsuits,

2275
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:12,253
and contracts.

2276
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:14,631
How about this?

2277
02:00:15,215 --> 02:00:17,217
You give me three weeks
and I don't wanna hear any bullshit

2278
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:19,219
about you shopping this
anywhere around town.

2279
02:00:19,594 --> 02:00:21,054
If you do that...

2280
02:00:22,472 --> 02:00:25,225
I believe I can solve your problem
with the contract.

2281
02:00:29,938 --> 02:00:31,481
Lil' nigga, you in my spot.

2282
02:00:32,774 --> 02:00:34,693
- Yo.
- Hey, Suge.

2283
02:00:35,402 --> 02:00:36,695
Suge. Easy, man. Yo.

2284
02:00:36,778 --> 02:00:37,779
Hey, Suge, what the...

2285
02:00:37,904 --> 02:00:39,280
Hey. Suge.

2286
02:00:39,322 --> 02:00:40,824
You parked in my
motherfuckin' spot or what?

2287
02:00:40,907 --> 02:00:42,534
- I didn't know, man.
- It's cool, man.

2288
02:00:43,410 --> 02:00:45,412
What the fuck? Suge!

2289
02:00:47,914 --> 02:00:49,374
Suge, it's just a parking spot.

2290
02:00:49,457 --> 02:00:51,084
Fuck off. Fuck out of my...

2291
02:00:55,338 --> 02:00:56,538
Move this piece of shit.

2292
02:00:59,092 --> 02:01:00,385
And park my car.

2293
02:01:01,594 --> 02:01:03,972
And I better not see
one drop of blood on that motherfucker.

2294
02:01:04,014 --> 02:01:05,640
Suge, let's go, man.

2295
02:01:08,143 --> 02:01:09,144
What?

2296
02:01:12,022 --> 02:01:15,066
<i>The jury in the Rodney King case
has delivered its verdict,</i>

2297
02:01:15,150 --> 02:01:17,902
<i>and not one of the four police officers</i>

2298
02:01:17,986 --> 02:01:20,697
<i>seen on video tape
beating Mr. King a year ago</i>

2299

2300
02:01:22,449 --> 02:01:24,367
<i>They've all been found not guilty.</i>

2301
02:01:24,409 --> 02:01:27,203
For Christ's sake. Oh, my God.

2302
02:01:27,245 --> 02:01:28,329
<i>Judy, the details.</i>

2303
02:01:28,371 --> 02:01:30,582
<i>Peter, it was a clean sweep
for the defendants.</i>

2304
02:01:30,665 --> 02:01:32,500
<i>Not guilty, the verdict for all of them.</i>

2305
02:01:32,667 --> 02:01:33,752
<i>Only on one count against
Lawrence Powell...</i>

2306
02:01:33,835 --> 02:01:34,836
I'm sorry.

2307
02:01:34,878 --> 02:01:36,998
<i>...on excessive use of force
under color of authority.</i>

2308
02:01:41,426 --> 02:01:42,844
<i>It's probably the worst case</i>

2309
02:01:42,886 --> 02:01:44,971
<i>of police misconduct that I've ever seen.</i>

2310
02:01:46,723 --> 02:01:48,933
<i>I think it was devastating
to the image of this city</i>

2311
02:01:49,017 --> 02:01:50,617
<i>and especially to our police department.</i>

2312
02:01:52,228 --> 02:01:54,428
<i>It looks
kind of like we're in a war zone though.</i>

2313

<i>We've got some courageous

a statement of political dissatisfaction.</i>

2315
02:02:02,697 --> 02:02:04,577
<i>Police officers
are still back down,</i>

2316
02:02:04,741 --> 02:02:07,202
<i>guarding the area
down there with the Ralph's...</i>

2317
02:02:07,243 --> 02:02:09,079
<i>The police
are using eerily reminiscent</i>

2318
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:11,206
<i>of military-style assault weapons.</i>

2319
02:02:11,247 --> 02:02:13,625
<i>You can hear
random gunshots as rioters...</i>

2320
02:02:13,708 --> 02:02:15,085
<i>The cars
have been left abandoned</i>

2321
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:17,754
<i>because their drivers came under attack...</i>

2322
02:02:20,924 --> 02:02:22,842
<i>...our city.
We have fires burning.</i>

2323
02:02:24,761 --> 02:02:26,846
<i>Olympic, Pico, Wilshire.</i>

2324
02:02:29,182 --> 02:02:30,600
<i>More than 100 injured,</i>

2325
02:02:30,642 --> 02:02:33,311
<i>mostly in the South-Central
section of Los Angeles.</i>

2326
02:03:07,012 --> 02:03:10,140
You know, If we bag all this shit up in ounces,
we should probably be straight.

2327
02:03:10,223 --> 02:03:11,975
I think we got enough.

2328
02:03:14,144 --> 02:03:16,396
No, turn it down. Turn it down.

2329
02:03:21,192 --> 02:03:23,903
Baby. Can you smoke that shit out there?

2330
02:03:26,322 --> 02:03:29,200
So, all this weed is for
your Ruthless artists?

2331
02:03:29,451 --> 02:03:31,286
Yeah, I mean, shit.

2332
02:03:32,495 --> 02:03:34,497
I'm tryin' to take care
of these little money problems, man.

2333
02:03:34,539 --> 02:03:36,958
So, they can smoke it, sell it.

2334
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,626
Fuck, throw a party on it,
for all I give a fuck.

2335
02:03:38,668 --> 02:03:40,003
As long as I just...

2336
02:03:42,922 --> 02:03:44,122
Yo, man, you straight?

2337
02:03:44,924 --> 02:03:46,843
- E, you straight?
- Yeah, I'm good.

2338
02:03:46,926 --> 02:03:48,926
- No, for real, man. You straight?
- Man, I'm good!

2339
02:03:49,971 --> 02:03:51,222
I'm just fucking tired, man.

2340
02:03:51,306 --> 02:03:54,017
I'm fucking downgrading houses.
How would you feel?

2341
02:03:54,309 --> 02:03:55,602
Answer me that!

2342
02:03:55,685 --> 02:03:57,812
Dre rolled out. Ruthless money low.

2343
02:03:57,854 --> 02:04:00,231
Tomica asking me all kind of questions
about the house.

2344
02:04:00,857 --> 02:04:03,610
Answer me this, would you be all right?

2345
02:04:03,985 --> 02:04:06,321
Would you be all right
moving out your fucking house?

2346
02:04:06,363 --> 02:04:07,530
You all right with it?

2347
02:04:07,614 --> 02:04:10,825
E, I'm your boy. I'm in this shit with you.

2348
02:04:10,867 --> 02:04:12,494
I'm just trying to make
sure you're good, bro.

2349
02:04:12,535 --> 02:04:14,371
I'm good! You good?

2350
02:04:14,454 --> 02:04:15,774
- You good?
- Yeah, man.

2351
02:04:16,164 --> 02:04:17,290
Eric.

2352
02:04:17,374 --> 02:04:18,416
What, Jerry?

2353
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:19,751
Take it easy.

2354
02:04:19,834 --> 02:04:21,795
You know what?
Let's get you outta the house.

2355
02:04:21,878 --> 02:04:23,922
I have stuff needs your autograph, okay?

2356
02:04:25,173 --> 02:04:26,758
I'll come when I have time, Jerry.

2357
02:04:26,841 --> 02:04:28,551
Eric, come on.

2358
02:04:31,012 --> 02:04:32,389
We still got a business to run.

2359
02:04:32,472 --> 02:04:34,099
Don't it look like
I'm running business right now?

2360
02:04:34,182 --> 02:04:35,892
No. It looks like
you're fucking cutting up weed.

2361
02:04:35,934 --> 02:04:39,396
I thought that was a job
for fucking jackasses.

2362
02:04:41,690 --> 02:04:43,316
You know what, Jerry?

2363
02:04:44,859 --> 02:04:48,571
You right. You absolutely fuckin' right.

2364
02:04:49,531 --> 02:04:51,658
We got business to take care of.

2365
02:04:52,701 --> 02:04:54,744
I'll see you in a minute.

2366
02:05:04,045 --> 02:05:05,672
You all right, E?

2367
02:05:06,589 --> 02:05:08,091
E, are you cool?

2368
02:05:10,593 --> 02:05:12,345
Eric.

2369
02:05:18,935 --> 02:05:23,148
"You got knocked the fuck out."

2370
02:05:26,276 --> 02:05:27,694
That shit's funny.

2371
02:05:27,777 --> 02:05:29,070
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

2372
02:05:29,112 --> 02:05:30,697
How's <i>Friday</i> coming?

2373
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:34,117
This shit is funny. I'm feeling it, though.

2374
02:05:35,076 --> 02:05:36,286
What page are you on?

2375
02:05:36,453 --> 02:05:39,789
100. I'm not going too much longer, though.

2376
02:05:39,873 --> 02:05:41,207
Baby, come here. Look!

2377
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:45,962
Look how young y'all are.

2378
02:05:49,466 --> 02:05:50,467
Shit.

2379
02:05:52,844 --> 02:05:54,179
Dang!

2380
02:05:54,637 --> 02:05:55,889
What?

2381
02:05:56,639 --> 02:05:59,059
We left a lot of good records on the table.

2382
02:06:35,053 --> 02:06:37,764
<i>It's like
I don't even know what I'm doing no more.</i>

2383
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:40,517
I don't know where the money going.

2384
02:06:40,725 --> 02:06:42,352
Why you stressin'?

2385
02:06:42,435 --> 02:06:44,354
You know I know the business.

2386
02:06:44,979 --> 02:06:46,690
Just... Shit.

2387
02:06:46,773 --> 02:06:49,484
Lay out all the files,
contracts, whatever it is,

2388
02:06:49,526 --> 02:06:51,403
and I'll look into it.

2389
02:06:51,986 --> 02:06:54,197
For real. Come here.

2390
02:06:56,366 --> 02:06:58,034
Come here.

2391
02:07:04,708 --> 02:07:07,252
You just go to New York,

2392
02:07:07,335 --> 02:07:12,132
you take care of this
big ol' distribution deal with Sony.

2393
02:07:12,215 --> 02:07:14,175
Bring that shit on in.

2394
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:18,888
All right?
And I'll check into everything else.

2395
02:07:23,393 --> 02:07:24,561
I love you.

2396
02:07:24,602 --> 02:07:25,603
You what?

2397
02:07:26,062 --> 02:07:27,230
I love you.

2398
02:07:27,272 --> 02:07:29,899
You what? I can't hear you.

2399
02:07:32,861 --> 02:07:35,071
So how's your home life, man?

2400
02:07:35,989 --> 02:07:38,616
What? That small-ass house
I just moved into in Norwalk?

2401
02:07:38,700 --> 02:07:39,993
Fuckin' hate it.

2402
02:07:40,076 --> 02:07:42,537
No, come on. You know what I mean.

2403
02:07:42,579 --> 02:07:45,498
I mean your love life, Eric. Hmm?

2404
02:07:46,666 --> 02:07:49,336
You seem pretty serious about this girl.

2405
02:07:49,419 --> 02:07:53,214
- I ain't in love.
- Oh? You had me scared there for a minute.

2406
02:07:53,256 --> 02:07:55,342
You're too young to settle down.

2407
02:07:55,425 --> 02:07:57,010
Well, you don't have to be scared of that.

2408
02:07:57,093 --> 02:07:59,262
Oh, man. Wait till you taste this.

2409
02:07:59,346 --> 02:08:01,598
Kung Pao chicken.

2410
02:08:01,639 --> 02:08:03,099
Fantastic.

2411
02:08:03,183 --> 02:08:05,602
And it is better the second day.

2412
02:08:06,061 --> 02:08:07,604
There you go.

2413
02:08:08,021 --> 02:08:09,022
Dig in.

2414
02:08:12,317 --> 02:08:15,111
So, where is this girl from again?

2415
02:08:17,572 --> 02:08:19,449
Look, Jerry.

2416
02:08:19,491 --> 02:08:21,284
I actually ate right before I came.

2417
02:08:21,326 --> 02:08:23,912
So I'm just gonna take this and go.

2418
02:08:24,037 --> 02:08:26,790
Hold on. Hold on. Where are you going?

2419
02:08:26,831 --> 02:08:28,625
I just came to get this.

2420
02:08:29,042 --> 02:08:30,585
These are my bills, my checks.

2421
02:08:30,627 --> 02:08:33,296
Look, I'm gonna have a bite of your food.

2422
02:08:34,881 --> 02:08:36,841
I'm gonna say farewell.

2423
02:08:39,886 --> 02:08:42,514
I'll talk to you later.

2424
02:08:52,023 --> 02:08:54,484
Your neighbors,
they've been complaining a lot.

2425
02:08:54,567 --> 02:08:55,610
The noise.

2426
02:08:55,652 --> 02:08:57,487
Stop.

2427
02:08:58,154 --> 02:09:00,490
I just think a little
privacy would be better.

2428
02:09:02,158 --> 02:09:04,244
So what? You want me to move?

2429
02:09:05,161 --> 02:09:06,162
Yeah.

2430
02:09:07,163 --> 02:09:10,041
And I...
You know, I happen to know of a place.

2431
02:09:10,125 --> 02:09:12,669
There's plenty of room,
and I know the owner.

2432
02:09:14,587 --> 02:09:16,673
Are you sure you're ready for that, Andre?

2433
02:09:16,715 --> 02:09:18,133
Yeah, I am.

2434
02:09:19,009 --> 02:09:21,720
'Cause I'm really feeling you like that.

2435
02:09:23,888 --> 02:09:26,349
I'm really feeling you too.

2436
02:09:27,517 --> 02:09:28,685
But...

2437
02:09:34,899 --> 02:09:38,528
Hey, don't even worry about it.
It was just a thought.

2438
02:09:42,699 --> 02:09:43,783
What's up?

2439
02:09:44,367 --> 02:09:47,495
All right. Good night.

2440
02:09:47,537 --> 02:09:50,290
Oh, whoa, whoa! Really? Good night?

2441
02:09:50,874 --> 02:09:51,958
You okay to drive?

2442
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:55,628
No. Look at you.

2443
02:09:56,796 --> 02:09:57,881
Good night, Andre.

2444
02:09:57,964 --> 02:09:59,466
Nah. See...

2445
02:10:00,133 --> 02:10:01,259
See, I can't help thinking,

2446
02:10:01,343 --> 02:10:03,845
maybe you want me to come inside.

2447
02:10:03,887 --> 02:10:05,180
Of course I do.

2448
02:10:05,221 --> 02:10:06,639
So, what's different now?

2449
02:10:08,016 --> 02:10:10,560
I got a lot to think about.

2450
02:10:10,643 --> 02:10:12,771
You're asking me to move in with you.

2451
02:10:12,854 --> 02:10:14,564
That is a huge step!

2452
02:10:15,482 --> 02:10:16,483
I like you, Andre,

2453
02:10:16,566 --> 02:10:19,069
but there's a lot going on around you.

2454
02:10:19,986 --> 02:10:21,571
Whatchu mean?

2455
02:10:22,405 --> 02:10:25,450
I know about the whole Death Row business,

2456
02:10:25,533 --> 02:10:26,701
the assault charges,

2457
02:10:26,743 --> 02:10:28,328
the shooting.

2458
02:10:28,411 --> 02:10:30,747
Just seems dangerous.

2459
02:10:30,830 --> 02:10:33,500
My son is my world.

2460
02:10:37,420 --> 02:10:39,089
I hear you.

2461
02:10:45,428 --> 02:10:46,846
Good night.

2462
02:11:04,906 --> 02:11:07,450
<i>Hail Mary, run quick see</i>

2463
02:11:07,492 --> 02:11:09,953
<i>What do we have here now?</i>

2464
02:11:09,994 --> 02:11:11,830
<i>Do you wanna ride or die?</i>

2465
02:11:14,791 --> 02:11:16,835
<i>I ain't a killer but don't push me</i>

2466
02:11:16,918 --> 02:11:19,629
<i>Revenge is like
the sweetest joy next to getting pussy</i>

2467
02:11:19,671 --> 02:11:23,133
<i>Picture paragraphs unloaded
Wise words being quoted</i>

2468
02:11:23,174 --> 02:11:25,427
<i>Peeped the weakness
in the rap game and sewed it</i>

2469
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:28,471
<i>Bow down, pray to God
Hoping that he's listening</i>

2470
02:11:28,555 --> 02:11:30,974
<i>Seeing niggas coming for me
and my diamonds...</i>

2471
02:11:32,642 --> 02:11:33,842
What up, Dre?

2472
02:11:34,227 --> 02:11:35,228
What up, Pac?

2473
02:11:35,395 --> 02:11:37,480
I'm about to bust niggas in the mouth
with this new album.

2474
02:11:37,564 --> 02:11:39,315
Okay, I feel that.

2475
02:11:39,441 --> 02:11:41,818
- Suge said you got some heat for a nigga.
- Hell yeah!

2476
02:11:41,901 --> 02:11:43,570
- Play that for him.
- Okay.

2477
02:11:44,487 --> 02:11:46,614
<i>California Love</i>

2478
02:11:52,829 --> 02:11:54,414
Yeah. You feel that?

2479
02:11:55,248 --> 02:11:56,541
Yeah. Fuck with me.

2480
02:11:56,624 --> 02:11:57,625
<i>California...</i>

2481
02:11:57,667 --> 02:11:59,419
<i>- "California Love."</i>
- Yeah.

2482
02:11:59,502 --> 02:12:01,963
<i>...knows how to party</i>

2483
02:12:02,005 --> 02:12:03,173
<i>California...</i>

2484
02:12:04,466 --> 02:12:06,468
<i>...knows how to party</i>

2485
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:09,346
What the hell was that?

2486
02:12:09,429 --> 02:12:10,430
Hold on, Pac.

2487
02:12:11,014 --> 02:12:12,682
Stay right there, man.

2488
02:12:15,602 --> 02:12:17,187
Yo. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

2489
02:12:19,147 --> 02:12:21,274
- Come on.
- Come on, man.

2490
02:12:21,358 --> 02:12:24,319
Shut the fuck up
and put your glasses down.

2491
02:12:25,695 --> 02:12:27,155
Stop, man! Stop.

2492
02:12:28,865 --> 02:12:30,033
Chop, chop.

2493
02:12:30,617 --> 02:12:31,618
Get him. Get hype.

2494
02:12:31,951 --> 02:12:32,952
Get hype.

2495
02:12:33,870 --> 02:12:34,871
Yo!

2496
02:12:36,706 --> 02:12:38,667
What the fuck are y'all doing?

2497
02:12:39,834 --> 02:12:40,835
Check this out.

2498
02:12:41,252 --> 02:12:43,463
Get him. Time to eat. Who's hungry?

2499
02:12:43,546 --> 02:12:44,964
You hungry, nigga? Yeah!

2500
02:12:45,048 --> 02:12:46,466
- Get up.
- Come on!

2501
02:12:48,218 --> 02:12:49,978
Bring your bitch-ass up.

2502
02:12:51,054 --> 02:12:52,494
Tight-whitey ass nigga.

2503
02:12:54,391 --> 02:12:55,892
You know what to do.

2504
02:13:00,563 --> 02:13:01,690
I'd like to make a toast.

2505
02:13:02,065 --> 02:13:03,066
To what?

2506
02:13:03,233 --> 02:13:04,401
To Death Row Records...

2507
02:13:04,984 --> 02:13:06,069
Death Row!

2508
02:13:06,152 --> 02:13:07,404
...and Suge

2509
02:13:07,654 --> 02:13:09,197
for making all this happen.

2510
02:13:11,991 --> 02:13:14,494
And may the West Coast reign forever.

2511
02:13:15,245 --> 02:13:16,579
Come on. Come on.

2512
02:13:18,164 --> 02:13:20,250
And may the West Coast reign forever.

2513
02:13:21,042 --> 02:13:22,877
Now toast to Dr. Dre.

2514
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:24,754
Put your glass down.

2515
02:13:26,589 --> 02:13:28,508
I said, put the fucking glasses down!

2516
02:13:28,591 --> 02:13:29,884
Hey, yo, slow your roll, Dre.

2517
02:13:30,051 --> 02:13:31,177
Come on.

2518
02:13:31,261 --> 02:13:32,512
This why we got money?

2519
02:13:33,596 --> 02:13:35,390
To act like we ain't got no goddamn sense?

2520
02:13:35,432 --> 02:13:36,891
We coulda did all this dumb shit

2521
02:13:36,933 --> 02:13:38,268
back in Compton!

2522
02:13:38,935 --> 02:13:41,187
But this what the fuck y'all turned into.

2523
02:13:41,271 --> 02:13:42,772
You sittin' up here eatin' fuckin' crab.

2524
02:13:42,856 --> 02:13:44,858
Who the fuck are you? Huh?

2525
02:13:46,693 --> 02:13:50,113
This my motherfucking name
on the wall, man!

2526
02:13:51,614 --> 02:13:54,784
And y'all in here acting like
y'all on motherfucking vacation.

2527
02:13:54,868 --> 02:13:57,746
I got Pac in the next motherfucking room.

2528
02:13:57,787 --> 02:14:00,040
Grindin', man! Workin'!

2529
02:14:00,915 --> 02:14:03,418
And y'all niggas in here partyin'?

2530
02:14:05,045 --> 02:14:06,629
One time?

2531
02:14:13,178 --> 02:14:14,658
- You trippin'.
- That's right.

2532
02:14:15,347 --> 02:14:16,890
We can do anything we wanna do.

2533
02:14:17,474 --> 02:14:19,517
We started this thing. This is us.

2534
02:14:19,601 --> 02:14:21,644
Nah, nigga. Death Row, that's us.

2535
02:14:23,229 --> 02:14:25,565
I don't know what the fuck this shit is.

2536
02:14:26,566 --> 02:14:28,526
Better watch your mouth, Blood.

2537
02:14:28,610 --> 02:14:30,612
And who the fuck you talking to, huh?

2538
02:14:30,779 --> 02:14:32,113
Nigga, you ain't nothing but a producer.

2539
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:33,865
Get the fuck out my face!

2540
02:14:43,166 --> 02:14:44,292
Shit!

2541
02:14:45,585 --> 02:14:46,586
Dre.

2542
02:14:48,713 --> 02:14:50,507
This is bullshit.

2543
02:14:50,590 --> 02:14:51,591
Dre!

2544
02:15:08,525 --> 02:15:11,027
Always fucking with me!

2545
02:15:37,012 --> 02:15:38,763
<i>Stop the vehicle now.</i>

2546
02:15:43,059 --> 02:15:45,186
Driver, hold it right there.

2547
02:15:45,854 --> 02:15:47,897
<i>Turn your vehicle off.</i>

2548
02:15:47,939 --> 02:15:50,066
<i>Drop the keys out of the window!</i>

2549
02:15:50,775 --> 02:15:51,818
<i>Open the door.</i>

2550
02:15:53,862 --> 02:15:57,407
<i>Step out of the vehicle. Hands in the air.</i>

2551
02:15:58,366 --> 02:16:00,493
<i>Keep them up! Hold it there.</i>

2552
02:16:02,579 --> 02:16:04,539
<i>Turn around.</i>

2553
02:16:04,581 --> 02:16:06,958
<i>Turn around. Fingers behind your head.</i>

2554
02:16:07,167 --> 02:16:08,407
Hold it right there.

2555
02:16:17,969 --> 02:16:19,220
Hey, that's Eazy.

2556
02:16:21,431 --> 02:16:24,100
Wazzup, E! I didn't know that was you.

2557
02:16:25,393 --> 02:16:27,633
- Hey, wassup? Wassup, homie?
- Hey. Yo, wuddup?

2558
02:16:30,148 --> 02:16:31,274
Nah. Hold up.

2559
02:16:31,358 --> 02:16:33,943
Hey, hey. Hold up. Relax, homie.
We in a club.

2560
02:16:35,111 --> 02:16:37,072
Cube, I just heard you was over here.

2561
02:16:47,832 --> 02:16:50,543
Yeah, I'm here. Whatchu need?

2562
02:16:53,171 --> 02:16:56,299
Everybody to calm the fuck down
from the looks of it.

2563
02:16:57,300 --> 02:16:58,927
I mean, I was just in
the neighborhood, man.

2564
02:16:58,968 --> 02:17:00,303
I came here with Bone Thugs.

2565
02:17:00,345 --> 02:17:02,222
I was just coming to say wassup.

2566
02:17:03,181 --> 02:17:04,182
Wassup?

2567
02:17:05,517 --> 02:17:08,603
I saw <i>Boyz in the Hood.</i> It was good.

2568
02:17:10,063 --> 02:17:12,774
You ain't called that shit
a after school special?

2569
02:17:15,527 --> 02:17:18,988
I like after school specials, Cube.
You know that.

2570
02:17:26,579 --> 02:17:28,164
What's up, man?

2571
02:17:28,248 --> 02:17:30,458
How you feel? You good?

2572
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:32,335
Hell yeah, nigga, I'm good.

2573
02:17:32,377 --> 02:17:34,129
It's good to see you.

2574
02:17:34,170 --> 02:17:35,672
It's good to see you right now.

2575
02:17:35,755 --> 02:17:37,507
Look at you!

2576
02:17:37,549 --> 02:17:39,009
Pull your fuckin' homies off me then

2577
02:17:39,050 --> 02:17:40,176
if it's good to see me.

2578
02:17:40,218 --> 02:17:41,803
You had niggas jump us.

2579
02:17:41,970 --> 02:17:43,138
God damn!

2580
02:17:44,597 --> 02:17:46,437
How you go from selling rocks
in the dope house

2581
02:17:46,516 --> 02:17:49,686
to having dinner
in the White House with the President?

2582
02:17:49,728 --> 02:17:53,148
They still trying to figure that shit out.

2583
02:17:53,189 --> 02:17:55,692
But, hey, all publicity...

2584
02:17:55,734 --> 02:17:57,360
...is good publicity.

2585
02:17:57,444 --> 02:17:58,820
You know it.

2586
02:17:58,862 --> 02:17:59,946
You know that's right.

2587
02:18:00,030 --> 02:18:01,322
Man.

2588
02:18:01,865 --> 02:18:04,909
Look, man, I wish that dumb shit

2589
02:18:04,993 --> 02:18:06,713
really would've never
popped off between us.

2590
02:18:06,745 --> 02:18:08,997
We shouldn't have
dissed each other in the first place.

2591
02:18:09,039 --> 02:18:11,166
Making the fans choose between us?

2592
02:18:11,207 --> 02:18:12,375
That wasn't cool.

2593
02:18:13,335 --> 02:18:14,461
You right.

2594
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:18,715
You ever think we'd be that big, though?

2595
02:18:18,798 --> 02:18:20,050
Hell, no.

2596
02:18:20,133 --> 02:18:22,010
I was just talking to my wife about that.

2597
02:18:22,052 --> 02:18:23,887
How it was in the beginning.

2598
02:18:23,928 --> 02:18:26,431
Shit, we just wanted to do music
for the neighborhood.

2599
02:18:26,514 --> 02:18:27,974
Be ghetto stars.

2600
02:18:28,683 --> 02:18:30,727
But what if we had the chance

2601
02:18:30,769 --> 02:18:34,022
to find out how big we can really be?

2602
02:18:34,064 --> 02:18:36,399
Come on, man. You got my mind workin'.

2603
02:18:36,441 --> 02:18:38,985
I've been thinking
about that shit all the time.

2604
02:18:39,069 --> 02:18:41,988
If we could just take that shit back to '89.
We changed the world!

2605
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:44,949
I hear you.
It was a simpler time, you know?

2606
02:18:45,033 --> 02:18:46,743
It was hard then.

2607
02:18:46,826 --> 02:18:47,869
But I've had days

2608
02:18:47,911 --> 02:18:50,747
where I almost wish
we was gettin' arrested in Detroit again.

2609
02:18:50,789 --> 02:18:52,415
Shit. You know?

2610
02:18:52,624 --> 02:18:54,250
Shit ain't gotta stop there.

2611
02:18:54,876 --> 02:18:56,461
But if we go do this,

2612
02:18:57,629 --> 02:18:59,339
we gotta do it right.

2613
02:18:59,422 --> 02:19:01,675
And if Dre with it, I'm with it.

2614
02:19:01,925 --> 02:19:04,386
But I don't know your
relationship with dude.

2615
02:19:05,345 --> 02:19:08,264
But if you want me, Eric,
Jerry can't be there.

2616
02:19:12,977 --> 02:19:14,020
All right.

2617
02:19:16,022 --> 02:19:17,023
Hey, man.

2618
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:19,401
Shit!

2619
02:19:19,693 --> 02:19:21,319
It's 'cause you
ain't got them damn gloves on.

2620
02:19:21,403 --> 02:19:22,612
Man, whatever.

2621
02:19:24,197 --> 02:19:25,907
But I hear you.

2622
02:19:26,366 --> 02:19:27,409
Yeah?

2623
02:19:28,284 --> 02:19:30,620
Shit. Ar'ight.

2624
02:19:31,830 --> 02:19:34,374
These invoices haven't been paid.

2625
02:19:34,457 --> 02:19:36,835
They're two or three years outdated.

2626
02:19:36,918 --> 02:19:39,629
These are cancelled checks.
They all bounced.

2627
02:19:39,713 --> 02:19:41,923
And these are past due.

2628
02:19:41,965 --> 02:19:43,925
Jerry took advantage of you.

2629
02:19:45,593 --> 02:19:47,220
I know it's a lot,

2630
02:19:47,303 --> 02:19:50,015
but you had to know the truth sometime.

2631
02:19:50,098 --> 02:19:51,516
Now you do.

2632
02:19:53,643 --> 02:19:56,312
You know Dre and Cube
tried to warn me about this.

2633
02:19:58,982 --> 02:20:01,484
I've been fuckin' up for a long time.

2634
02:20:05,989 --> 02:20:07,365
Don't. Don't.

2635
02:20:07,449 --> 02:20:09,451
Real long time.

2636
02:20:13,496 --> 02:20:14,664
Shit.

2637
02:20:32,474 --> 02:20:33,683
Hey, man.

2638
02:20:37,687 --> 02:20:41,107
Where you been?
I've been calling you all day.

2639
02:20:43,485 --> 02:20:45,570
Sit down, Jerry.

2640
02:20:49,366 --> 02:20:51,951
What is this all about? The groupie?

2641
02:20:52,535 --> 02:20:54,579
The executive assistant?

2642
02:20:56,039 --> 02:20:58,166
She even go to college?

2643
02:20:58,208 --> 02:21:01,211
Man, you're so much fuckin'
smarter than this.

2644
02:21:01,252 --> 02:21:02,921
Sit down, Jerry.

2645
02:21:24,150 --> 02:21:26,069
This ain't about Tomica, Jerry.

2646
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:28,655
It's about you.

2647
02:21:28,738 --> 02:21:30,865
And you can stop acting
like you ain't never done nothing wrong.

2648
02:21:30,907 --> 02:21:34,160
You know what, man?
I know that you're upset. I understand.

2649
02:21:35,912 --> 02:21:40,083
But I'm asking you,
I'm advising you, take a breath, okay?

2650
02:21:40,166 --> 02:21:41,751
I'm gonna look at the paperwork, Eric.

2651
02:21:41,835 --> 02:21:45,338
- You can stop giving me advice as of now.
- It's fucked up.

2652
02:21:47,007 --> 02:21:48,258
Here's what's about to happen.

2653
02:21:48,341 --> 02:21:50,343
I'mma get N.W.A back together,

2654
02:21:50,927 --> 02:21:53,263
and you ain't gonna have
nothing to do with it this time.

2655
02:21:55,390 --> 02:21:57,267
How the fuck can you even say
something like that?

2656
02:21:57,350 --> 02:21:59,811
What the fuck is going on with you, man?

2657
02:22:00,645 --> 02:22:02,313
I know what's good for you,

2658
02:22:02,397 --> 02:22:04,315
I know what's good for Ruthless...

2659
02:22:04,399 --> 02:22:08,236
And we have worked up a trust
after years of hard work,

2660
02:22:08,278 --> 02:22:10,071
and that trust is our foundation, Eric.

2661
02:22:10,113 --> 02:22:11,473
I don't give a shit.

2662
02:22:12,115 --> 02:22:13,408
Eric?

2663
02:22:16,244 --> 02:22:18,830
You look lousy, man. Are you okay?

2664
02:22:20,331 --> 02:22:21,499
Trust?

2665
02:22:22,625 --> 02:22:24,586
Trust is a motherfucker.

2666
02:22:26,004 --> 02:22:27,714
Is it?

2667
02:22:27,797 --> 02:22:29,424
Let me ask you something.

2668
02:22:30,425 --> 02:22:32,802
Eric, if what I'm doing is so illegal,

2669
02:22:32,886 --> 02:22:34,086
how come I've never been sued?

2670
02:22:35,096 --> 02:22:36,639
If I'm such a fuckin' thief,

2671
02:22:36,681 --> 02:22:38,808
such a liar, such a motherfucker,

2672
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:41,102
how come nobody's ever come to collect?

2673
02:22:41,144 --> 02:22:44,939
Because this is business
and this is how it works.

2674
02:22:44,981 --> 02:22:47,317
And it's not always pretty. No.

2675
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:48,693
Do I cover my own ass?

2676
02:22:48,777 --> 02:22:51,029
Do I cover my own end? Absolutely.

2677
02:22:51,112 --> 02:22:53,156
But don't you dare fuckin' tell me

2678
02:22:53,239 --> 02:22:54,616
that I have not taken care of you.

2679
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:59,788
Don't you fuckin' tell me
that I have not had your back from day one!

2680
02:22:59,829 --> 02:23:01,498
Day one!

2681
02:23:06,086 --> 02:23:07,921
Is this taking care of me?

2682
02:23:08,797 --> 02:23:10,298
Are you fucking kidding me?

2683
02:23:10,340 --> 02:23:12,060
It's taking care of the
whole fucking thing.

2684
02:23:12,092 --> 02:23:13,802
It's business!

2685
02:23:13,843 --> 02:23:15,220
And this is how it works.

2686
02:23:15,345 --> 02:23:18,640
Have I covered my end?
Do I cover my ass? Absolutely.

2687
02:23:18,682 --> 02:23:20,600
But don't you dare fuckin' tell me

2688
02:23:20,684 --> 02:23:22,560
that I have not taken care of you.

2689
02:23:25,063 --> 02:23:26,898
This business, too?

2690
02:23:26,981 --> 02:23:28,191
Yes! This is business.

2691
02:23:28,274 --> 02:23:30,026
This is how fucked up it can get.

2692
02:23:30,110 --> 02:23:33,321
But I didn't start this.
I didn't fuck it up.

2693
02:23:33,363 --> 02:23:34,656
You did!

2694
02:23:36,491 --> 02:23:37,575
No.

2695
02:23:39,661 --> 02:23:40,912
You did.

2696
02:23:42,831 --> 02:23:44,332
You fired, Jerry.

2697
02:23:44,457 --> 02:23:45,875
Oh, for Christ...

2698
02:23:45,959 --> 02:23:47,711
Eric, this is not how we do things.

2699
02:23:47,752 --> 02:23:49,087
This is not you.

2700
02:23:49,170 --> 02:23:50,547
This is not you.

2701
02:23:50,630 --> 02:23:51,631
Eric!

2702
02:23:53,008 --> 02:23:54,551
This is an important company.

2703
02:23:54,634 --> 02:23:56,886
Eric, I'm not gonna let you fuck this up.

2704
02:23:57,554 --> 02:23:58,596
Eric?

2705
02:23:59,681 --> 02:24:00,807
Oh, for Christ's sake!

2706
02:24:00,890 --> 02:24:02,308
Eric!

2707
02:24:14,070 --> 02:24:15,613
<i>Yeah, hello?</i>

2708
02:24:15,739 --> 02:24:17,490
Wuddup, Dre?

2709
02:24:17,574 --> 02:24:19,451
<i>- Who this?
</i>-Eric.

2710
02:24:19,743 --> 02:24:20,994
E?

2711
02:24:21,244 --> 02:24:22,245
<i>Just felt like calling.</i>

2712
02:24:22,746 --> 02:24:24,581
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

2713
02:24:26,082 --> 02:24:27,250
What's up?

2714
02:24:27,292 --> 02:24:29,711
<i>I mean, you know me, man. Doing my thing.</i>

2715
02:24:30,253 --> 02:24:32,088
Killin' all this pussy.

2716
02:24:33,340 --> 02:24:34,424
How about you?

2717
02:24:34,466 --> 02:24:35,717
<i>You know, man.</i>

2718
02:24:35,759 --> 02:24:37,927
I'm just making tracks. Doing my thing.

2719
02:24:37,969 --> 02:24:41,139
Yeah, that Snoop joint you did was crazy.
That was dope.

2720
02:24:41,222 --> 02:24:44,726
Yeah? Thanks, E. Good looking out, man.

2721
02:24:49,773 --> 02:24:51,441
Look, Dre, I know you be busy,

2722
02:24:53,651 --> 02:24:54,944
but I talked to Cube and we were talking

2723
02:24:54,986 --> 02:24:58,156
about some possibilities.

2724
02:24:59,616 --> 02:25:01,993
Possibilities? Okay.

2725
02:25:02,118 --> 02:25:03,119
<i>Yeah, like,</i>

2726
02:25:03,203 --> 02:25:05,789
without Jerry Heller
type of fucking possibilities.

2727
02:25:05,872 --> 02:25:06,873
<i>Really?</i>

2728
02:25:07,499 --> 02:25:08,583
Well, it's about time.

2729
02:25:08,625 --> 02:25:11,628
Man, I mean, I know shit kinda went crazy.

2730
02:25:13,046 --> 02:25:17,759
You know, the money
kinda had everybody divided, man,

2731
02:25:18,301 --> 02:25:20,178
but I really wish it didn't.

2732
02:25:26,935 --> 02:25:30,480
To be honest, man,
I'm not proud of all the shit I did either.

2733
02:25:36,111 --> 02:25:37,237
So, whatchu think, man?

2734
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:40,156
You think we could get together or what?
Whatchu think?

2735
02:25:44,452 --> 02:25:45,704
Yeah, man.

2736
02:25:46,871 --> 02:25:48,998
Yeah, that sound good.

2737
02:25:49,958 --> 02:25:52,002
Let's do it, E. Let's do it.

2738
02:25:52,293 --> 02:25:55,130
<i>I'mma let you know when we can get back
into the studio, you know?</i>

2739
02:25:55,171 --> 02:25:58,883
Lay down some tracks like the old days.

2740
02:26:00,593 --> 02:26:02,137
Fair enough.

2741
02:26:02,178 --> 02:26:03,179
<i>A'ight.</i>

2742
02:26:03,805 --> 02:26:05,473
It's good to hear from you, man.

2743
02:26:07,892 --> 02:26:09,144
A'ight.

2744
02:26:40,133 --> 02:26:42,510
Man, y'all niggas
ain't making no music in here.

2745
02:26:42,552 --> 02:26:43,720
Hey!

2746
02:26:43,762 --> 02:26:44,888
'Sup, E?

2747
02:26:44,929 --> 02:26:46,389
What up? What up? What up?

2748
02:26:46,431 --> 02:26:49,559
Yo, hey, when are Dre and Cube
gonna roll up in here, man?

2749
02:26:49,601 --> 02:26:50,894
- Yeah, man.
- I'm ready!

2750
02:26:50,935 --> 02:26:52,395
'Cause I'm ready
to get this new shit going.

2751
02:26:52,437 --> 02:26:53,605
I'm ready, too.

2752
02:26:53,688 --> 02:26:54,898
But long as we stay ready,

2753
02:26:54,981 --> 02:26:56,566
we gonna know we go beyond, man.

2754
02:26:56,649 --> 02:26:59,569
You already know
this new N.W.A shit about to be crazy.

2755
02:26:59,611 --> 02:27:00,862
Here ya go, baby.

2756
02:27:00,904 --> 02:27:03,531
E, I got books of new shit.
I got libraries of new shit.

2757
02:27:03,573 --> 02:27:04,699
That's what I'm talking about, Ren.

2758
02:27:04,741 --> 02:27:05,941
That's what I'm talking about.

2759
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:10,413
I got the tracks. You like that?

2760
02:27:11,664 --> 02:27:15,669
Hell yeah.
'Chu think you Dre now?

2761
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:17,545
I'm trying to murder Dre.

2762
02:27:17,587 --> 02:27:20,548
I'm about to murder both of y'all
on the track, though. Check me out.

2763
02:27:20,590 --> 02:27:21,758
Check me out.

2764
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:24,803
What you doing, E?
You know you don't play no instruments.

2765
02:27:28,181 --> 02:27:30,016
You gonna play it?

2766
02:27:32,310 --> 02:27:33,603
E, you all right?

2767
02:27:34,813 --> 02:27:35,980
Eric.

2768
02:27:37,273 --> 02:27:38,775
Baby, you good?

2769
02:27:40,068 --> 02:27:42,904
Yeah. I'm all right.

2770
02:27:47,617 --> 02:27:49,744
- Eric! Eric!
- Call 911.

2771
02:27:49,786 --> 02:27:51,329
- Eric! Baby?
- Eric. Get up, man.

2772
02:27:51,413 --> 02:27:53,915
- Get him up.
- Yo, call 911. Call 911.

2773
02:27:53,957 --> 02:27:56,334
- You all right, E?
- Baby? Eric?

2774
02:27:56,501 --> 02:27:58,670
- Eazy, wake up.
- Eric! Baby.

2775
02:27:58,753 --> 02:27:59,963
Open your eyes.

2776
02:28:00,046 --> 02:28:01,486
Yes, we need an ambulance.

2777
02:28:16,479 --> 02:28:19,315
Wait... Ain't you gonna say something?

2778
02:28:20,025 --> 02:28:22,152
What is it? A respiratory infection?

2779
02:28:22,235 --> 02:28:23,361
Pneumonia? What?

2780
02:28:23,445 --> 02:28:25,989
Yes, well, um, it is those things,

2781
02:28:26,031 --> 02:28:27,657
and more, I'm afraid.

2782
02:28:27,699 --> 02:28:30,577
We ran a full blood battery, and, uh...

2783
02:28:32,370 --> 02:28:36,666
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright,
but you've tested positive for HIV.

2784
02:28:38,585 --> 02:28:39,878
Get the fuck outta here.

2785
02:28:39,961 --> 02:28:41,004
What?

2786
02:28:41,087 --> 02:28:42,505
A normal T-cell count

2787
02:28:42,547 --> 02:28:45,008
is anywhere between 500 and 1,500.

2788
02:28:45,050 --> 02:28:47,093
Right now, your T-cell count is 14.

2789
02:28:52,140 --> 02:28:53,641
But I ain't no faggot.

2790
02:28:53,683 --> 02:28:54,851
Mr. Wright, actually,

2791
02:28:54,934 --> 02:28:57,479
the virus can be transmitted
in quite a few ways,

2792
02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:00,648
including unprotected heterosexual sex.

2793
02:29:06,029 --> 02:29:09,574
That's wrong.
You got to test that over. Test that again!

2794
02:29:09,657 --> 02:29:11,076
We've run the test five times

2795
02:29:11,159 --> 02:29:13,870
with five different samples
and the result remains the same.

2796
02:29:13,912 --> 02:29:15,205
- Shit!
- Tomica.

2797
02:29:17,457 --> 02:29:18,917
Tomica.

2798
02:29:19,709 --> 02:29:21,920
But she's pregnant, Doc. What's this mean?

2799
02:29:22,003 --> 02:29:25,173
It doesn't necessarily mean
that she's contracted the virus,

2800
02:29:25,215 --> 02:29:27,717
but we have to test her to be sure.

2801
02:29:28,218 --> 02:29:30,887
What do we do? When we start the treatment?

2802
02:29:30,929 --> 02:29:33,556
I mean, what... I gotta get healthy.

2803
02:29:33,598 --> 02:29:35,850
I got things to do. I got...

2804
02:29:37,477 --> 02:29:39,020
What am I supposed to do?

2805
02:29:39,062 --> 02:29:41,564
Mr. Wright, you need to understand

2806
02:29:42,357 --> 02:29:43,900
that you are very, very sick.

2807
02:29:43,942 --> 02:29:47,237
But I don't even feel that bad, Doc.
Don't tell me that.

2808
02:29:47,320 --> 02:29:49,322
With care and palliative care,

2809
02:29:49,489 --> 02:29:51,157
we can probably keep you comfortable

2810
02:29:51,241 --> 02:29:54,035
for maybe six months, at the very most.

2811
02:29:54,077 --> 02:29:55,412
Comfortable?

2812
02:29:55,495 --> 02:29:57,956
What do you mean, comfortable?

2813
02:30:01,543 --> 02:30:03,211
It's just a matter of time.

2814
02:30:05,422 --> 02:30:09,759
I am truly, truly sorry, Mr. Wright.

2815
02:30:10,427 --> 02:30:14,264
I'll leave you time to process this.

2816
02:30:16,725 --> 02:30:18,560
Doc. Come on, Doc. No.

2817
02:30:19,102 --> 02:30:20,103
Doc.

2818
02:30:32,157 --> 02:30:33,491
Come on!

2819

Shh.

2826
02:30:58,808 --> 02:31:00,977
Just let me make this right.

2827
02:31:01,770 --> 02:31:03,021
Please.

02:31:03,813 --> 02:31:05,815
'Cause you healthy, hmm?

2829
02:31:09,194 --> 02:31:12,322
- And the baby healthy.
- Yeah. We're healthy.

- Okay.

I just want you to be...

- Yeah.

Nah, man. He in a fuckin' coma.

02:40:14,906 --> 02:40:17,951
Dre and Eazy, they had already
been selling it as cassette tapes.

2950
02:40:18,034 --> 02:40:19,119
<i>And they just blew up.</i>

2951
02:40:19,202 --> 02:40:22,038
Eazy and Dr. Dre Wild and Wet Pool Party.

2952
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:23,873
<i>This is what it's all about!</i>

2953
02:40:23,957 --> 02:40:25,875
<i>We wanted to invite you
to the President's luncheon.</i>

2954
02:40:25,917 --> 02:40:28,503
<i>I said if I go down there,
this'll start some shit.</i>

2955
02:40:30,797 --> 02:40:33,883
<i>When I think of N.W.A,
they weren't really music to me.</i>

2956
02:40:33,967 --> 02:40:35,885
It was more like a real lifestyle.

2957
02:40:35,969 --> 02:40:37,649
<i>Brothers from my neighborhood made it out.</i>

2958
02:40:42,392 --> 02:40:44,978
- You got the dopest album out this year.

2959
02:40:45,061 --> 02:40:46,521

<i>going like I want it to go.</i>

2961
02:40:48,106 --> 02:40:49,149
Damn!

2962
02:40:53,987 --> 02:40:56,239
<i>You do not know
how long I waited to get in his booth</i>

2963
02:40:56,322 --> 02:40:58,825
<i>and to have Dre out there goin',
"You ready?"</i>

2964
02:40:58,908 --> 02:41:01,268
<i>I waited all my life for that,
since</i> Straight Outta Compton.

2965
02:41:01,911 --> 02:41:03,371
Dre's direction was helping me

2966
02:41:03,413 --> 02:41:05,248
become a strong lyricist, which I am now.

2967
02:41:10,587 --> 02:41:11,755
<i>Dre has taught me a lot.</i>

2968
02:41:11,796 --> 02:41:14,049

<i>You'd have to even credit
both Eminem's and my success'</i>

2971
02:41:17,594 --> 02:41:18,678
to Dr. Dre.

2972
02:41:20,680 --> 02:41:22,098
<i>Apple's purchase of Beats</i>

2973
02:41:22,182 --> 02:41:24,476
<i>will be the biggest deal in its history.</i>

2974
02:41:24,559 --> 02:41:26,061
<i>Our music was like our weapon.</i>

2975
02:41:26,102 --> 02:41:27,687
