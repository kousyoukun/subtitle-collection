Rosebud.

4
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,540
News on the March.

5
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:22,218
<i>Legendary was the Xanadu...</i>

6
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:25,738
<i>...where Kubla Khan decreed
his stately pleasure dome.</i>

7
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:29,217
<i>Today almost as legendary
as Florida's Xanadu...</i>

8
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:31,497
<i>...the world's largest
private pleasure ground.</i>

9
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:37,296
<i>Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast,
a private mountain...</i>

10
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:39,296
<i>...was commissioned and successfully built.</i>

11
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:42,776
<i>One hundred thousand trees,
twenty thousand tons of marble...</i>

12
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:45,336
<i>...are the ingredients
of Xanadu's mountain.</i>

13
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,695
<i>Contents of Xanadu痴 palace:</i>

14
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:52,775
<i>Paintings, pictures, statues,
various stones of other palaces.</i>

15
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:54,935
<i>A collection of everything.</i>

16
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:58,134
<i>So big it can never
be catalogued or appraised.</i>

17
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:01,894
<i>Enough for 10 museums,
the loot of the world.</i>

18
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:07,213
<i>Xanadu's livestock...</i>

19
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:13,533
<i>...the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea,
the beast of the field and jungle...</i>

20
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:17,932
<i>...two of each,
the biggest private zoo since Noah.</i>

21
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:20,292
<i>Like the Pharaohs...</i>

22
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:24,252
<i>...Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones
to mark his grave.</i>

23
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,211
<i>Since the Pyramids...</i>

24
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:30,091
<i>...Xanadu is the costliest monument...</i>

25
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:32,451
<i>...a man has built to himself.</i>

26
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,489
<i>Here in Xanadu last week...</i>

27
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:50,609
<i>...Xanadu's landlord was laid to rest.</i>

28
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:53,569
<i>A potent figure of our century...</i>

29
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:55,729
<i>...America's Kubla Khan:</i>

30
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:57,928
<i>Charles Foster Kane.</i>

31
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:29,085
<i>Its humble beginnings,
in this ramshackle building, a dying daily.</i>

32
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,685
<i>Kane's empire, in its glory...</i>

33
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:35,645
<i>...held dominion over 37 newspapers,
two syndicates...</i>

34
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:40,244
<i>...a radio network,
an empire upon an empire.</i>

35
00:05:40,564 --> 00:05:44,284
<i>The first of grocery stores, paper mills...</i>

36
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:49,843
<i>...apartment buildings,
factories, forests, ocean liners.</i>

37
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:53,123
<i>An empire through which for 50 years...</i>

38
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:55,523
<i>...flowed in an unending stream...</i>

39
00:05:55,803 --> 00:05:58,882
<i>...the wealth of the Earth's
third richest gold mine.</i>

40
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:03,282
<i>Famed in American legend
is the origin of the Kane fortune.</i>

41
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:08,721
<i>How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane,
by a defaulting boarder, in 1868...</i>

42
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:12,481
<i>...was left the supposedly worthless deed
to an abandoned mineshaft:</i>

43
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:15,561
<i>The Colorado Lode.</i>

44
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:19,640
<i>Fifty-seven years later,
before a congressional investigation...</i>

45
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,000
<i>... Walter P. Thatcher,
grand old man of Wall Street...</i>

46
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,680
<i>...for years chief target
of Kane papers' attacks on trusts...</i>

47
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,039
<i>...recalls a journey he made as a youth.</i>

48
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,399
My firm had been appointed trustee
by Mrs. Kane...

49
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,679
...for a large fortune she recently acquired.

50
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:38,678
It was her wish that I take charge
of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.

51
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:43,318
Chief, is it not, that on this occasion,
Charles Foster Kane...

52
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:48,077
...personally attacked you after striking you
in the stomach with a sled?

53
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:51,397
I shall read to the committee
a prepared statement...

54
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:56,677
...which I have brought with me,
and then refuse to answer questions.

55
00:06:57,156 --> 00:07:00,396
Mr. Charles Foster Kane,
in every essence of his social beliefs...

56
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:03,276
...and by the dangerous manner
he has persistently attacked...

57
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,556
...American traditions of private property...

58
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:07,915
...initiative and opportunity
for advancement...

59
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:11,675
...is, in fact, nothing more or less
than a communist.

60
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:14,155
<i>That same month in Union Square....</i>

61
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:16,835
<i>The words "Charles Foster Kane"...</i>

62
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:20,274
<i>...are a menace
to every workingman in this land.</i>

63
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:25,754
<i>He is today what he has always been
and always will be: a fascist.</i>

64
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:27,993
<i>And still another opinion....</i>

65
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:47,591
<i>Kane urged his country's entry
into one war...</i>

66
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:50,311
<i>...opposed participation in another.</i>

67
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:54,191
<i>Won the election
to one American president at least.</i>

68
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:56,911
<i>Spoke for millions of Americans.</i>

69
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,350
<i>Was hated by as many more.</i>

70
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,070
<i>For 40 years appeared in Kane newsprint...</i>

71
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,469
<i>...no public issue
on which Kane papers took no stand.</i>

72
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:14,029
<i>No public man whom Kane himself
did not support or denounce.</i>

73
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:17,948
<i>Often support, then denounce.</i>

74
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:29,187
<i>Twice married, twice divorced.</i>

75
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:31,707
<i>First to a president's niece...</i>

76
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:34,747
<i>...Emily Norton, who left him in 1916.</i>

77
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:38,746
<i>Died 1918 in a motor accident
with their son.</i>

78
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:43,346
<i>Sixteen years after his first marriage...</i>

79
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:45,626
<i>...two weeks after his first divorce...</i>

80
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,905
<i>...Kane married Susan Alexander...</i>

81
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:51,105
<i>...singer, at the Town Hall
in Trenton, New Jersey.</i>

82
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:56,905
<i>For wife two,
one-time opera-singing Susan Alexander...</i>

83
00:08:57,105 --> 00:09:00,264
<i>...Kane built
Chicago's Municipal Opera House.</i>

84
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:02,624
<i>Cost: $3 million.</i>

85
00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:08,663
<i>Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane,
half-finished before she divorced him...</i>

86
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:10,663
<i>...the still unfinished...</i>

87
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:12,143
<i>...Xanadu.</i>

88
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:15,343
<i>Cost: No man can say.</i>

89
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:21,702
<i>Kane, molder of mass opinion
though he was...</i>

90
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:24,422
<i>...in all his life
was never granted elective office...</i>

91
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:26,142
<i>...by the voters of his country.</i>

92
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:28,821
<i>But Kane papers were once strong indeed...</i>

93
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:31,341
<i>...and once the prize seemed almost his.</i>

94
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:34,981
<i>In 1916, as independent candidate
for governor...</i>

95
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:37,381
<i>...the best elements of the state
behind him...</i>

96
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:42,060
<i>...the White House seemingly the next
easy step in a lightning political career...</i>

97
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,900
<i>...then suddenly, less than one week
before election...</i>

98
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,779
<i>...defeat.</i>

99
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,979
<i>Shameful, ignominious.</i>

100
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:54,059
<i>Defeat that set back for 20 years
the cause of reform in the U.S...</i>

101
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:57,698
<i>...forever cancelled political chances
for Charles Foster Kane.</i>

102
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:03,618
<i>Then, in the first year
of the Great Depression...</i>

103
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:06,298
<i>...a Kane paper closes.</i>

104
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:09,937
<i>For Kane, in four short years, collapse.</i>

105
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:15,297
<i>Eleven Kane papers merged,
more sold, scrapped.</i>

106
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:25,656
Is that correct?

107
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:27,975
Don't believe everything you hear
on the radio.

108
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:31,775
<i>-Read the Inquirer.
-How were business conditions in Europe?</i>

109
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:35,655
How did I find business conditions
in Europe, Mr. Bones?

110
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:37,375
With great difficulty.

111
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:41,414
Are you glad to be back?

112
00:10:41,494 --> 00:10:43,894
I'm always glad to be back.
I'm an American.

113
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:47,214
Always been an American. Anything else?

114
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:50,253
When I was a reporter,
we asked them quicker than that.

115
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,733
What do you think
of the chances for war in Europe?

116
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:56,933
I talked with the responsible leaders
of England, France, Germany and Italy.

117
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:59,412
They're too intelligent
to embark on a project...

118
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:01,852
...that would mean the end of civilization.

119
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:05,412
You can take my word for it,
there will be no war.

120
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:12,171
<i>Kane helped to change the world...</i>

<i>...but Kane's world now is history...</i>

122

<i>...and the great yellow journalist himself

<i>...aloof, seldom visited,
never photographed...</i>

News on the March.

133
00:11:58,366 --> 00:11:59,526
That's it.

134
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:03,006
Stand by.
I'll tell you if we want to run it again.

135
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:05,646
-How about it, Mr. Rawlston?
-How do you like it, boys?

136
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:09,445
-Seventy years in a man's life.
-That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.

137
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,885
It's a good short,
but what it needs is an angle.

138
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:15,125
All we saw on that screen
was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.

139
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:17,205
I know that. I read the papers.

140
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:19,644
It isn't enough to tell us what a man did...

141
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:23,004
...you've got to tell us who he was.

142
00:12:23,044 --> 00:12:26,204
Wait a minute.
What were Kane's last words?

143
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:28,163
Do you remember, boys?

144
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:30,603
What were the last words
he said on Earth?

145
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,683
Maybe he told us about himself
on his deathbed.

146
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:35,683
-Maybe he didn't.
-All we saw was a big American.

147
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:38,682
How did he differ from Ford,
Hearst or John Doe?

148
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:41,242
I tell you, a man's dying words--

149
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,242
What were they?
You don't read the papers.

150
00:12:43,322 --> 00:12:45,682
When Charles Foster Kane died,
he said one word:

151
00:12:45,762 --> 00:12:46,722
"Rosebud."

152
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:48,521
That's all he said? Tough guy.

153
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,801
Yes, "Rosebud." Just that one word.

154
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:52,761
-But who is she?
-What was it?

155
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:54,881
Here's a man
who could've been president...

156
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:57,161
...who was as loved,
hated and talked about...

157
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:59,680
...as any man in our time,
but when he dies...

158
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,920
...something is on his mind called Rosebud.

159
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,320
-What does that mean?
-A racehorse he bet on once.

160
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,640
-That didn't come in.
-But what was the race?

161
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,840
Rosebud.

162
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,759
-Thompson.
-Yes.

163
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,679
Hold this up a week, two if you must.

164
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,439
Don't you think right after he's dead--

165
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,479
Find out about Rosebud. Get in touch
with anybody who knew him...

166
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,039
...or knew him well.

167
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,878
That manager of his....

168
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,358
Bernstein. His second wife.
She's still living.

169
00:13:21,438 --> 00:13:22,678
Susan Alexander Kane.

170
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,438
-She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.
-That's right.

171
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:28,797
See them all. Get in touch with everybody
that ever worked for him...

172
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:31,677
...whoever loved him,
whoever hated his guts.

173
00:13:31,957 --> 00:13:34,877
I don't mean go through
the city directory of course.

174
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:36,437
I'll get on it right away.

175
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:39,156
Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.

176
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:42,436
It will probably turn out to be
a very simple thing.

177
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:21,712
Miss Alexander.

178
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:25,032
This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.

179
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:27,352
I want another drink, John.

180
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:33,031
Right away.
Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?

181
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:36,471
-I'll have a highball, please.
-Who told you you could sit down?

182
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:40,110
I thought maybe we could have a talk.

183
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,590
Think again.

184
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,990
Can't you people leave me alone?

185
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,230
I'm minding my own business,
you mind yours.

186
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,149
If I could just have a talk with you,
Miss Alexander. I'd--

187
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,629
Get out of here.

188
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:54,589
Get out!

189
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,349
-Sorry.
-Get out.

190
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:59,988
-Maybe some other time.
-Get out.

191
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:11,627
Gino.

192
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,147
Get her another highball.

193
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:18,027
She just won't talk to nobody,
Mr. Thompson.

194
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:19,146
Okay.

195
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,786
-Another double?
-Yeah.

196
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,386
Hello, I want New York City.

197
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:30,785
Courtland 79970.
This is Atlantic City 46827. All right.

198
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:35,265
She's....

199
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:37,505
She'll snap out of it.

200
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:40,824
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon
talk about Mr. Kane as any--

201
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:42,224
-Hello.
-Sooner.

202
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:44,864
This is Thompson. Let me talk to the chief.

203
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:48,504
Mr. Rawlston? She won't talk.

204
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:51,463
The second Mrs. Kane.
About Rosebud or anything else.

205
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:53,223
I'm calling from Atlantic City.

206
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:56,783
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia,
to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.

207
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,183
They're expecting me.

208
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:01,622
Then I've a meeting with his
general manager in New York. Bernstein.

209
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,142
Then I'm coming back here.

210
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:06,022
Yeah, I'll see everybody that's still alive.
Goodbye.

211
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:08,861
-Hey....
-John.

212
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:10,701
You just might be able to help me.

213
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:14,341
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane,
did she ever mention Rosebud?

214
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:16,141
"Rosebud"?

215
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:18,461
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.

216
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,780
As a matter of fact, just the other day,
when the papers were full of it...

217
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,220
...l asked her.

218
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,779
She never heard of Rosebud.

219
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:44,858
The directors of the Thatcher Memorial
Library have asked me to remind you...

220
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:47,578
...about the conditions
under which you may...

221
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:50,657
...inspect certain portions
of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.

222
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:53,297
-l remember them.
-Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.

223
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:55,777
-All I want is an hour--
-Under no circumstances...

224
00:16:55,857 --> 00:16:59,456
...are direct quotes from his manuscript
to be used by you. You may follow me.

225
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:01,656
That's all right. I'm just looking for--

226
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:15,415
Jennings.

227
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:21,654
Thank you, Jennings.

228
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:25,374
You will be required to leave this room
at 4:30 promptly.

229
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:28,134
You will confine yourself,
it is our understanding...

230
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,573
...to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's
manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.

231
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:33,453
That's all I'm interested in.

232
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,653
Thank you.

233
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:39,732
Pages 83 to 142.

234
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:18,329
Come on, boys.

235
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:19,728
Be careful, Charles.

236
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:20,688
Mrs. Kane.

237
00:18:20,728 --> 00:18:22,848
Pull your muffler around your neck,
Charles.

238
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:25,088
Mrs. Kane,
I think we'll have to tell him now.

239
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:28,528
Yes, I'll sign those papers now,
Mr. Thatcher.

240
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:31,847
You people seem to forget
that I'm the boy's father.

241
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:34,727
It's going to be done
exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.

242
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,367
There's nothing wrong with Colorado.
I don't see why we can't raise our son...

243
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:40,166
...just 'cause we came into money.

244
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:43,086
If I want to, I can go to court.
A father has a right to.

245
00:18:43,126 --> 00:18:46,326
A boarder that beats his bill
and leaves worthless stock behind....

246
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:49,245
That property is as much my property
as anybody's...

247
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:52,085
...now that it's valuable.
And if Fred Graves had any idea...

248
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,565
...this would happen, he'd have made out
the certificates in both our names.

249
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:58,965
-But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.
-He owed the money to both of us.

250
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:03,724
-"The bank's decision in all matters--"
-l don't hold with giving Charles to a bank--

251
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:05,964
-Stop this nonsense.
-We're a bit uneducated--

252
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:08,084
"The bank's decision
concerning his education...

253
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:10,483
"...his places of residence, is to be final."

254
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:13,963
-The idea of a bank being the guardian--
-Stop this nonsense, Jim.

255
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:16,883
"We will assume full management
of the Colorado Lode"...

256
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,442
...which I repeat, Mrs. Kane,
you are the sole owner.

257
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:21,602
-Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
-Right here.

258
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:24,002
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.

259
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:27,122
You'd think I hadn't been
a good husband or father--

260
00:19:27,202 --> 00:19:28,682
The sum of $50,000 a year...

261
00:19:28,762 --> 00:19:31,841
...is to be paid to you
and Mr. Kane as long as you both live...

262
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,961
...and thereafter to the survivor.

263
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:37,321
-Let's hope it's all for the best.
-It is.

264
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,440
Why I can't raise my own boy
is more than I can understand.

265
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,280
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

266
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,399
Everything else, the principal,
as well as all monies earned...

267
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:54,399
...is to be administered by the bank in trust
for your son, Charles Foster Kane...

268
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:57,079
...until he reaches his 25th birthday,
at which time...

269
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:59,318
...he is to come into complete possession.

270
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,638
Charles!

271
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:04,158
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

272
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:08,758
It's almost 5:00.
Don't you think I'd better meet the boy?

273
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:11,397
I've got his trunk all packed.

274
00:20:12,517 --> 00:20:14,597
I've had it packed for a week now.

275
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:19,436
I've arranged for a tutor
to meet us in Chicago.

276
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:21,716
I'd have brought him here with me, but....

277
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:24,076
-Charles.
-Look, Mom.

278
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:25,636
You'd better come inside.

279
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:28,596
-That's quite a snowman.
-l took the pipe out of his mouth.

280
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:30,075
Did you make it yourself?.

281
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:32,595
Maybe I'll make some teeth and whiskers.

282
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,835
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

283
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,235
-Hello.
-How do you do, Charles?

284
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:38,835
He comes from the East.

285
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,314
-Pa.
-Hello, Charlie.

286
00:20:40,394 --> 00:20:41,554
Charles.

287
00:20:42,314 --> 00:20:43,594
Yes, Mommy.

288
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:48,034
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you
on a trip with him tonight.

289
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,833
You'll be leaving on number 10.

290
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,993
That's the train with all the lights on it.

291
00:20:52,073 --> 00:20:53,033
You going, Mom?

292
00:20:53,113 --> 00:20:56,233
No. Your mother won't be going
right away, but she'll....

293
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:58,553
Where am I going?

294
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:02,232
You're going to see Chicago and New York
and Washington, maybe. Ain't he?

295
00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:03,392
He certainly is.

296
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:06,752
I wish I were a boy going on a trip
like that for the first time.

297
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:09,951
-Why aren't you coming with us, Mom?
-We have to stay here, Charles.

298
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:12,831
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher
from now on, Charlie.

299
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:16,191
You're gonna be rich. Your ma figures,
well, that is...

300
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:19,471
...me and her decided this ain't the place
for you to grow up in.

301
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,830
You'll probably be
the richest man someday...

302
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,230
-...and you ought to get--
-You won't be lonely.

303
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,630
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have
fine times together, we are.

304
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,509
Let's shake hands. Come.
I'm not that frightening, am l?

305
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,069
-What do you say? Let's shake.
-Why, Charles.

306
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:34,829
-Why, you almost hurt me.
-Charlie!

307
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:37,309
Sleds aren't to hit people,
but to sleigh with.

308
00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:38,309
Mom!

309
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:40,588
-You got to go.
-Jim!

310
00:21:41,228 --> 00:21:42,668
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.

311
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:44,468
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.

312
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:46,308
-That's what you think, is it?
-Yes.

313
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,547
That's why he's going to be brought up
where you can't get at him.

314
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:11,705
Well, Charles...

315
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:16,105
-...Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

316
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:18,585
And a happy New Year.

317
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:19,904
In closing...

318
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:23,704
...may I remind you your 25th birthday,

319

from the firm...

320
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:29,823
...of Thatcher & Company,
as well as acquiring the full responsibility...

321
00:22:29,903 --> 00:22:32,263
...for the world's sixth largest
private fortune.

322
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:35,263
-Got that?
-"The world's sixth largest private fortune."

323
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:39,383
I don't think you realize the full importance
of the position you are to occupy.

324
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:41,582
I am therefore enclosing
for your consideration...

325
00:22:41,622 --> 00:22:44,222
...a list of your holdings,
extensively cross-indexed.

326
00:22:44,302 --> 00:22:46,422

-It's from Mr. Kane.

-Go on.
-"Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...

I don't know how to run a newspaper.

Can you prove it isn't?

348
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:56,815
Mr. Bernstein,
I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.

349
00:23:57,535 --> 00:23:58,655
-Mr. Leland.
-Hello.

350
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:00,334
Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.

351
00:24:00,374 --> 00:24:05,414
We have no secrets from our readers.
Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.

352
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:09,174
<i>He knows what's wrong with every copy
of the Inquirer since I took over. Read.</i>

Signed "Wheeler." Any answer?

356
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:23,092
Yes. Dear Wheeler: You provide
the prose poems, I'll provide the war.

357
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,812
-That's fine.
-l like it myself. Send it right away.

358
00:24:25,852 --> 00:24:28,132
I came to see you
about this campaign of yours.

359
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:30,971
<i>The Inquirer's campaign against
the Public Transit Company.</i>

360
00:24:31,051 --> 00:24:33,211
Do you know anything
we can use against them?

361
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:34,731
You're still the college boy, eh?

362
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:38,411
I was expelled from college, a lot
of colleges, you remember? I remember.

363
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:42,170
I think I should remind you of a fact
you have forgotten.

364
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,930
You're one of the largest stockholders
in the Public Transit Company.

365
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,890
The trouble is, you don't realize
you're talking to two people.

366
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,049
As Charles Foster Kane
who owns 82,364 shares...

367
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:55,729
...of Public Transit Preferred. See,
I do have a general idea of my holdings.

368
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:58,209
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel...

369
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:01,488
...his paper should be closed,
a committee formed to boycott him.

370
00:25:01,528 --> 00:25:05,208
If you can form such a committee,
put me down for a contribution of $1,000.

371
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:08,008
<i>On the other hand,
I am the publisher of the Inquirer.</i>

372
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:12,007
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in
on a little secret. It is also my pleasure...

373
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:16,207
...to see that the working people of this
community aren't robbed by a pack...

374
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:18,687
...of money-mad pirates, just because...

375
00:25:19,127 --> 00:25:22,126
...they have no one
to look after their interests.

376
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:25,406
I'll let you in on another little secret,
Mr. Thatcher:

377
00:25:25,486 --> 00:25:29,206
I think I'm the man to do it.
You see, I have money and property.

378
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:33,085
If I don't look after the interests
of the underprivileged, somebody else will.

379
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,165
Maybe somebody
without money or property.

380
00:25:35,245 --> 00:25:36,485
That would be too bad.

381
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:38,565
I saw your financial statement today.

382
00:25:38,645 --> 00:25:41,524
-Oh, did you?
-Tell me, honestly...

383
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:45,844
...don't you think it's rather unwise
to continue this philanthropic enterprise...

384
00:25:45,884 --> 00:25:48,844
<i>...this Inquirer, that is costing you
$1 million a year?</i>

385
00:25:48,884 --> 00:25:53,523
Yes. I did lose $1 million last year.
I expect to lose $1 million this year.

386
00:25:53,603 --> 00:25:56,203
I expect to lose $1 million next year.

387
00:25:56,243 --> 00:25:58,403
At the rate of $1 million a year...

388
00:25:58,443 --> 00:26:01,882
...I値l have to close this place in 60 years.

389
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:13,601
"With respect to the said newspapers...

390
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:16,041
"...the said Charles Foster Kane...

391
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:19,521
"...hereby relinquishes all control thereof...

00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:22,640
"...and of the syndicates

393
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:28,480
"...and any and all other newspaper, press

394
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,239
"...and agrees to abandon
all claim thereto--"

395
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,519
-Which means we're bust all right.
-Well, out of cash.

396
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,039
All right, Mr. Bernstein.

397
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:40,478
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher,
just let me sign it and go home.

398
00:26:40,518 --> 00:26:43,758
You're too old
to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

399
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:46,798
You're too old to be called anything else.

400
00:26:46,878 --> 00:26:48,998
You were always too old.

401
00:26:49,598 --> 00:26:53,157
"In consideration thereof,
Thatcher & Company agrees...

402
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:55,917
"...to pay to Charles Foster Kane,
as long as he lives--"

403
00:26:55,957 --> 00:26:57,557
My allowance.

404
00:26:57,637 --> 00:27:01,356
"You will continue to maintain
over your newspapers a large...

405

"...measure of control.
Measure of control."

406
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:09,556
And we shall seek your advice.

407
00:27:12,035 --> 00:27:15,755
This depression is temporary.

408
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:20,554
There's always the chance
that you'll die richer than I will.

409
00:27:20,754 --> 00:27:23,114
It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.

410
00:27:23,194 --> 00:27:25,554
We never lost as much as we made.

411
00:27:25,634 --> 00:27:29,954
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles...

412
00:27:30,034 --> 00:27:35,073
...you never made a single investment.
You always used money to....

413
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:37,673
To buy things.

414
00:27:40,752 --> 00:27:42,952
To buy things.

415
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:47,672
My mother should have chosen
a less reliable banker.

416
00:27:54,231 --> 00:27:57,831
I always gagged on that silver spoon.

417
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:01,670
You know, Mr. Bernstein...

418
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,870
...if I hadn't been very rich...

419
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,670
...l might have been a really great man.

420
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,829
Don't you think you are?

421
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:15,829
I think I did pretty well
under the circumstances.

422
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:19,909
What would you like to have been?

423
00:28:22,588 --> 00:28:24,828
Everything you hate.

424
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:36,027
I beg your pardon, sir? What did you say?

425
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:39,747
-It痴 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings?
-Yes, ma'am.

426
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:42,306
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege,
young man.

427
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:45,306
-Did you find what you were looking for?
-No.

428
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:49,626
-You're not Rosebud, are you?
-What?

429
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:52,545
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings,
isn't it?

430
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:56,945
Goodbye, everybody.
Thanks for the use of the hall.

431
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:01,064
Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.

432
00:29:01,144 --> 00:29:03,464
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know?

433
00:29:03,544 --> 00:29:07,544
We thought maybe.... If we could
find out what he meant by his last words...

434
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:10,104
-...as he was dying.
-That "Rosebud"?

435
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:12,543
Maybe some girl?

436
00:29:12,623 --> 00:29:14,783
There were a lot of them in the early days.

437
00:29:14,823 --> 00:29:17,943
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane
could have met someone casually...

438
00:29:17,983 --> 00:29:20,183
...and then 50 years later, on his deathbed--

439
00:29:20,223 --> 00:29:24,862
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.

440
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:28,502
A fellow will remember a lot of things
you wouldn't think he'd remember.

441
00:29:28,622 --> 00:29:30,262
You take me.

442
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:35,181
One day, back in 1896,
I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry...

443
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:38,461
...and as we pulled out,
there was another ferry pulling in...

444
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:41,180
...and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off.

445
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,700
A white dress she had on.

446
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,140
She was carrying a white parasol.

447
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,820
I only saw her for one second.

448
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:54,139
She didn't see me at all,
but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since...

449
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:57,459
...that I haven't thought of that girl.

450
00:29:57,939 --> 00:30:01,978
-Who else have you been to see?
-Well, I went down to Atlantic City.

451
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:03,938
Susie?

452
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:05,298
Thank you.

453
00:30:05,818 --> 00:30:08,578
I called her myself the day after he died.

454
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:11,217
I thought maybe somebody ought to.

455
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:16,577
-She couldn't even come to the phone.
-I値l be seeing her again in a couple of days.

456
00:30:16,657 --> 00:30:18,577
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.

457
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:22,256
If you'd talk about anything connected
with Mr. Kane that you can remember.

458
00:30:22,336 --> 00:30:24,216
You were with him from the beginning.

459
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:29,456
From before the beginning, young fellow.
And now it's after the end.

460
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,735
Have you tried to see anybody
except Susie?

461
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:36,935
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've
been through Walter Thatcher's journal.

462
00:30:37,015 --> 00:30:41,294
-That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
-He made an awful lot of money.

463
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:44,054
Well, it's no trick to make a lot of money...

464
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:49,574
...if all you want is to make a lot of money.

465
00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:57,173
You take Mr. Kane.
It wasn't money he wanted.

466
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:03,332
Thatcher never did figure him out.
Sometimes even I couldn't.

467
00:31:03,492 --> 00:31:06,772
You know who you ought to see?
Mr. Leland.

468
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:09,892
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend.
They went to school together.

469
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:11,092
Harvard?

470
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:14,731
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Cornell, Switzerland.

471
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:17,291
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.

472
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:20,011
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.

473
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:23,210
One of those families
where the father is worth $10 million...

474
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,410
...then one day he shoots himself,
and it turns out there's nothing but debts.

475
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,210
He was with Mr. Kane and me...

476
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:34,929
<i>...the first day Mr. Kane took over
the Inquirer.</i>

477
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:44,688
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.

478
00:31:44,928 --> 00:31:48,648
It's going to look a lot different
one of these days. Come on.

479
00:31:57,047 --> 00:32:00,207
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint.
That's a newspaper building.

480
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:04,886
You're getting paid, mister,
for opinions or for hauling?

481
00:32:07,566 --> 00:32:10,366
-Jedediah.
-After you, Mr. Kane.

482
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:24,244
Excuse me, sir, but l....

483
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:29,324
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

484
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,963
<i>Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.</i>

485
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:36,203
I am Herbert Carter, the editor-in-chief.

486
00:32:36,283 --> 00:32:40,043
-Thank you, Mr. Carter. This is Mr. Leland--
-How do you do, Mr. Leland?

487
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,922
Our new dramatic critic.
I hope I haven't made a mistake.

488
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,122
-It is dramatic critic, right?
-That's right.

489
00:32:45,202 --> 00:32:48,682
-Are they standing for me?
-You? Oh, Mr. Kane.

490
00:32:49,122 --> 00:32:49,962
Standing?

491
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:51,561
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

492
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:53,921
I thought it would be a nice little gesture.

493
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:56,961
-Ask them to sit down, will you, please.
-The new publisher.

494
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:01,241
-You may resume your duties, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

495
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:04,520
-l didn't know your plans.
-l don't know my plans myself.

496
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,080
-Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans.
-No?

497
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,040
Except to get out a newspaper.

498
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,399
-Mr. Bernstein.
-Yes, Mr. Kane.

499
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:18,719
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.

500
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,598
-Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
-How do you do, Mr. Carter?

501
00:33:23,678 --> 00:33:25,478
-Mr. Carter.
-How do you do?

502
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,678
-Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
-Stein.

503
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:32,277
-Kane.
-Mr. Carter, is this your office?

504
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:36,317
My little private sanctum
is at your disposal.

505
00:33:36,397 --> 00:33:39,677
-Excuse me.
-But I don't think I understand.

506
00:33:40,037 --> 00:33:43,916
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here
in your office as long as I have to.

507
00:33:44,996 --> 00:33:46,836
Live here? Yes?

508
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:49,756
-Excuse me.
-But a morning newspaper, after all--

509
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:50,676
Excuse me.

510
00:33:50,716 --> 00:33:54,435
We're practically closed for 12 hours a day.

511
00:33:54,755 --> 00:33:57,715
That's one of the things
that's going to have to be changed here.

512
00:33:57,795 --> 00:34:01,195
-The news goes on for 24 hours a day.
-24?

513
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:04,514
-That's right.
-Excuse me.

514
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:06,234
It's impossible....

515
00:34:06,274 --> 00:34:11,114
I've drawn that cartoon.
I'm no good as a cartoonist.

516
00:34:11,194 --> 00:34:12,753
You certainly aren't.

517
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:14,553
You're the dramatic critic, Leland.

518
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:16,513
-You still eating?
-I知 still hungry.

519
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:18,953
<i>Here's a front-page story in the Chronicle...</i>

520
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:22,032
...about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone
in Brooklyn who's missing.

521
00:34:22,112 --> 00:34:26,552
<i>She's probably murdered. Why isn't
there something about it in the Inquirer?</i>

522
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:28,352
We're running a newspaper...

523
00:34:28,392 --> 00:34:31,272
-I知 absolutely starving to death.
-...not a scandal sheet.

524
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:33,271
That's all right.

525
00:34:33,311 --> 00:34:37,151
<i>Mr. Carter, here is a three-column headline
in the Chronicle.</i>

526
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:39,671
<i>Why hasn't the Inquirer
a three-column headline?</i>

527
00:34:39,751 --> 00:34:41,191
The news wasn't big enough.

528
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:45,830
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough,
it makes the news big enough.

529
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,350
-That's right!
-The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone--

530
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,550
There's no proof
that she was murdered, or dead.

531
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,389
It says she's missing.
The neighbors are getting suspicious.

532
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:56,189
It's not our function
to report the gossip of housewives.

533
00:34:56,269 --> 00:35:00,349
If we were interested in that kind of thing,
we could fill the paper twice over, daily.

534
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,668
That's the kind of thing we are going to be
interested in from now on.

535
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:06,588
I want you to send your best man
to see Mr. Silverstone.

536
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:10,348
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't
produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone...

537
00:35:10,428 --> 00:35:12,467
<i>...the Inquirer will have him arrested.</i>

538
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:14,867
Tell Mr. Silverstone
he's a detective from....

539
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,307
-Central Office.
-The Central Office.

540
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:21,946
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious
and asks to see your man's badge...

541
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:25,746
...your man is to get indignant
and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.

542
00:35:25,946 --> 00:35:29,066
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear.
You ready for dinner, Jedediah?

543
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:32,265
I can't see that the function
of a respectable newspaper--

544
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:35,385
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter. Goodbye.

545
00:35:35,905 --> 00:35:37,105
Goodbye.

546
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:40,505
Paper! Read all about it!

547
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:43,544
<i>Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.</i>

548
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:45,984
The mystery of the lady
that vanished in Brooklyn.

549
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:49,784
<i>Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.</i>

550
00:36:02,902 --> 00:36:06,382
We'll be on the street soon,
Charlie, another 10 minutes.

551
00:36:06,502 --> 00:36:09,062
Three hours and 50 minutes late,
but we did it.

552
00:36:09,142 --> 00:36:10,662
-Tired?
-A tough day.

553
00:36:10,742 --> 00:36:12,261
-A wasted day.
-Wasted?

554
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:15,181
You only made the paper over
four times tonight, that's all.

555
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:18,741
I've changed the front page a little,
Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough.

556
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:22,860
There's something I've got to get into
this paper besides pictures and print.

557
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,420
<i>I've got to make the New York Inquirer
as important to New York...</i>

558
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,300
...as the gas in that light.

559
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,620
What are you going to do, Charlie?

560
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,659
My Declaration of Principles.
Don't smile, Jedediah.

561
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:37,459
I've got it all written out here.

562
00:36:37,939 --> 00:36:40,899
You don't want to make any promises
you don't want to keep.

563
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:42,538
These'll be kept.

564
00:36:43,378 --> 00:36:45,778
"I値l provide the people of this city...

565
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:49,578
"...with a daily paper
that will tell all the news honestly.

566
00:36:50,778 --> 00:36:53,977
-"l will also provide--"
-That's two sentences starting with "l."

567
00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:56,497
People will know who's responsible...

568
00:36:56,577 --> 00:37:00,497
<i>...and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer,
quickly, simply and entertainingly.</i>

569
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:03,816
No special interests will be allowed
to interfere with that truth.

570
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:07,576
"l will also provide them with a fighting
and tireless champion of their rights...

571
00:37:07,656 --> 00:37:10,176
"...as citizens and as human beings."

572
00:37:10,816 --> 00:37:12,056
Signed:

573
00:37:12,415 --> 00:37:14,935
"Charles Foster Kane."

574
00:37:16,775 --> 00:37:19,375
-Can I have that, Charlie?
-I知 going to print it.

575
00:37:19,455 --> 00:37:20,815
Solly!

576
00:37:21,815 --> 00:37:22,854
Yes, Mr. Kane?

577
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:25,614
I want you to run this editorial
in a box on the front page.

578
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:27,174
This morning's front page?

579
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:30,174
That's right, Solly,
that means we'll have to remake again.

580
00:37:30,254 --> 00:37:31,974
-Yes.
-Go down and tell them.

581
00:37:32,014 --> 00:37:33,293
All right.

582
00:37:33,613 --> 00:37:37,133
When you're through with that,
I'd like to have it back.

583
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:41,933
I'd like to keep that particular
piece of paper myself.

584
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:45,932
I have a hunch it might turn out
to be something pretty important.

585
00:37:46,172 --> 00:37:48,292
-A document...
-Sure.

586
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:51,652
...like the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution...

587
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:54,851
...and my first report card at school.

588
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:25,128
I know you're tired, gentlemen,
but I brought you here for a reason.

589
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:28,728
<i>-This little pilgrimage will do us good.
-The Chronicle's a good newspaper.</i>

590
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:31,728
<i>Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper.
Notice the circulation.</i>

591
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:36,527
<i>495,000.
But look who's working for the Chronicle.</i>

592
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:39,647
-With them, it's no trick to get circulation.
-You're right.

593
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:43,046
<i>You know how long it took the Chronicle
to get that staff together?</i>

594
00:38:43,086 --> 00:38:45,766
-Twenty years.
-Twenty years?

595
00:38:46,246 --> 00:38:51,166
Six years ago, I looked at a picture
of the world's greatest newspaper men.

596
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,365
I felt like a kid in front of a candy store.

597
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:57,245
Tonight, six years later,
I got my candy, all of it.

598
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:59,685
<i>Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.</i>

599
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:02,684
<i>Make an extra copy of that picture
and mail it to the Chronicle.</i>

600
00:39:04,284 --> 00:39:07,524
It'll make you all happy to learn
that our circulation this morning...

601
00:39:07,564 --> 00:39:10,244
...was the greatest in New York: 684,000.

602
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,603
684,132.

603
00:39:14,803 --> 00:39:15,923
Right.

604
00:39:16,483 --> 00:39:20,003
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness
in taking leave of you.

605
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,443
I'm going abroad next week for a vacation.

606
00:39:22,483 --> 00:39:25,882
I've promised my doctor for sometime
that I would leave when I could.

607
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:27,882
I now realize I can't.

608
00:39:28,402 --> 00:39:30,922
Say, Mr. Kane,
as long as you're promising...

609
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:34,721
...there's a lot of pictures and statues
in Europe you ain't bought yet.

610
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:36,761
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.

611
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:39,721
They've been making statues
for 2,000 years.

612
00:39:39,801 --> 00:39:41,801
And I've only been buying for five.

613
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:44,320
-Promise me, Mr. Kane.
-l promise, Mr. Bernstein.

614
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,120
-Thank you.
-Mr. Bernstein?

615
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,280
You don't expect me to keep
any of those promises, do you?

616
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,079
And now, gentlemen!

617
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:57,239
Your complete attention, if you please.

618
00:40:02,918 --> 00:40:05,878
Are we going to declare war on Spain?

619
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:16,757
Oh, mama, here they come.
Shoot me while I'm happy.

620
00:40:24,636 --> 00:40:29,716
I said, "Are we going to declare
war on Spain, or are we not?"

621
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:31,556
<i>The Inquirer already has.</i>

622
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:35,515
You long-faced, overdressed anarchist.

623
00:40:35,755 --> 00:40:37,475
I'm not overdressed.

624
00:40:37,595 --> 00:40:40,635
You are, too.
Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.

625
00:40:40,715 --> 00:40:42,794
Let's have the song about Charlie.

626
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:46,114
-Is there a song about Charlie?
-Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?

627
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:50,354
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town,
you get a song written about you.

628
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:01,993
I've seen that fellow. He's good.

629
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:03,552
Good evening, Mr. Kane.

630
00:41:03,632 --> 00:41:06,432
"There is a man, a certain man

631
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,832

that he'll do all he can

00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:38,629
"It痴 Charlie Kane, it's Mister Kane!

640
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:42,389
"He doesn't like that Mister
He likes good old Charlie Kane"

641
00:41:57,387 --> 00:42:00,307
-isn稚 it wonderful? Such a party.
-Yes.

642
00:42:00,347 --> 00:42:02,067
What's the matter?

643
00:42:02,227 --> 00:42:05,386

648
00:42:18,225 --> 00:42:20,825

650
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,144
Oh, mama, please.

651
00:42:25,264 --> 00:42:26,704
-Give me that.
-What? The blonde?

652
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:30,264
-No, the brunette.
-Where did you learn that, Charlie?

653
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:34,543
<i>Bernstein, these men
who were with the Chronicle...</i>

654
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,583
<i>...weren't they just as devoted
to the Chronicle policy...</i>

655
00:42:37,703 --> 00:42:39,823
...as they are now to our policies?

656
00:42:39,903 --> 00:42:42,543
Sure, they're just like anybody else.

657
00:42:42,743 --> 00:42:44,742
They got work to do, they do it.

658
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:47,862
Only they happen to be
the best men in the business.

659

<i>Do we stand for the same things
the Chronicle stands for?</i>

660
00:43:00,181 --> 00:43:01,901
Certainly not.

661
00:43:02,861 --> 00:43:07,700
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed
to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

662
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,540
There's always a chance, of course,
that they'll change Mr. Kane.

663
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,579
Without his knowing it.

664
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:20,299
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane!

665
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:25,218
-l got a cable here from Mr. Kane.
-What?

666
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:27,138
-From Paris, France.
-What?

667
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:30,098
-From Paris, France.
-Come on in.

668
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:35,697
"Who by his action
has the traction magnates on the run"

669
00:43:36,017 --> 00:43:40,937
It's a good thing he promised
not to send back any more statues.

670
00:43:42,217 --> 00:43:44,816
Look, he wants to buy
the world's biggest diamond.

671
00:43:44,896 --> 00:43:48,296
Why didn't you go to Europe with him?
He wanted you to.

672
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,016
I wanted Charlie to have fun,
with me along....

673
00:43:51,176 --> 00:43:53,256
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?

674
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:57,855
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?
Am I a New England schoolmarm?

675
00:43:58,575 --> 00:43:59,855
Yes.

676
00:44:01,095 --> 00:44:05,414
If you thought I'd answer you different
from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.

677
00:44:05,534 --> 00:44:06,894
"World's biggest diamond."

678
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:09,214
I didn't know Charlie
was collecting diamonds.

679
00:44:09,294 --> 00:44:10,734
He ain't.

680
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,893
He's collecting somebody
that's collecting diamonds.

681
00:44:14,373 --> 00:44:17,293
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.

682
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:21,293
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane...

683

685
00:44:30,412 --> 00:44:32,132
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

686
00:44:32,892 --> 00:44:34,651
-l know I've a moustache.
-It looks awful.

687
00:44:34,731 --> 00:44:38,171
Have we got a society editor?

688
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:41,051
-Right here, Mr. Kane.
-Miss Townsend is the society editor.

689
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:43,690
Miss Townsend,
this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane.

690
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:48,770
Miss Townsend, I've been away so long.
I don't know your routine.

691
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:52,890
I got a little social announcement.

692
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:56,769
I wish you wouldn't treat this
any differently than you would any other...

693
00:44:56,969 --> 00:44:58,569
...social announcement.

694
00:44:59,169 --> 00:45:02,089
<i>Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees
of the Inquirer--</i>

695
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:05,568
Mr. Bernstein,
thank you very much, everybody, l....

696
00:45:06,408 --> 00:45:10,368
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.

697
00:45:10,528 --> 00:45:11,928
Goodbye.

698
00:45:12,568 --> 00:45:14,687
Say, he was in an awful hurry.

699
00:45:15,607 --> 00:45:17,647
Hey, everybody, look out here.

700
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:19,647
Let's go to the window.

701
00:45:19,847 --> 00:45:22,647
-Mr. Leland! Mr. Bernstein!
-Yes, Ms. Townsend?

702
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:25,446
This announcement:
"Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton...

703
00:45:25,526 --> 00:45:28,926
"...announce the engagement
of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...

704
00:45:29,006 --> 00:45:30,726
"...to Mr. Charles Foster Kane."

705
00:45:30,766 --> 00:45:32,246
Come on.

706
00:45:34,645 --> 00:45:39,325
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece
of the President of the United States.

707
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:41,325
President's niece?

708
00:45:41,645 --> 00:45:44,804
Before he's through,
she'll be a president's wife.

709
00:45:52,804 --> 00:45:56,123
The way things turned out,
I don't need to tell you.

710
00:45:56,163 --> 00:45:58,763
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.

711
00:45:58,883 --> 00:46:00,883
It didn't end very well, did it?

712
00:46:01,283 --> 00:46:02,563
It ended.

713
00:46:03,563 --> 00:46:06,962
Then there was Susie. That ended, too.

714
00:46:09,162 --> 00:46:11,642
You know, Mr. Thompson, I was thinking...

715
00:46:12,442 --> 00:46:15,241
...this Rosebud
you're trying to find out about....

716
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:17,721
Yes?

717
00:46:21,921 --> 00:46:24,240
Maybe that was something he lost.

718
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,280
Mr. Kane was a man who lost
almost everything he had.

719
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,080
You ought to see Jed Leland.

720
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,199
Of course, he and Mr. Kane
didn't exactly see eye to eye.

721
00:46:34,279 --> 00:46:36,199
You take the Spanish-American war.

722
00:46:36,279 --> 00:46:39,519
I guess Mr. Leland was right.
That was Mr. Kane's war.

723
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:42,479
We didn't really have anything
to fight about.

724
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,638
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war
of Mr. Kane's...

725
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:49,558
...we'd have the Panama Canal?

726
00:46:50,238 --> 00:46:52,598
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.

727
00:46:53,158 --> 00:46:56,197
A lot of the time now
they don't tell me these things.

728
00:46:57,437 --> 00:46:59,197
Maybe even he's dead.

729
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,957
In case you'd like to know...

730
00:47:01,037 --> 00:47:03,876
...he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital
on 180th Street.

731
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:05,396
You don't say. I had--

732
00:47:05,436 --> 00:47:08,236
Nothing particular the matter with him,
they tell me, just....

733
00:47:08,316 --> 00:47:10,796
Just old age.

734
00:47:12,036 --> 00:47:16,795
It's the only disease that you don't
look forward to being cured of.

735
00:47:28,354 --> 00:47:31,154
I can remember absolutely everything,
young man.

736
00:47:31,234 --> 00:47:32,434
That's my curse.

737
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:36,873
That's one of the greatest curses
ever inflicted on the human race: memory.

738
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:42,433
I was his oldest friend, and as far as
I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.

739
00:47:42,673 --> 00:47:46,632
Not that Charlie was ever brutal.
He just did brutal things.

740
00:47:47,352 --> 00:47:51,432
Maybe I wasn't his friend,
but if I wasn't, he never had one.

741
00:47:51,672 --> 00:47:55,191
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

742
00:47:55,231 --> 00:47:57,511
You were about to say something
about Rosebud.

743
00:47:57,591 --> 00:47:59,711
Do you happen to have a good cigar?

744
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:03,471
I've got a young physician here
who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.

745
00:48:03,511 --> 00:48:05,750
No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sorry.

746
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,710
I changed the subject, didn't l?

747
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,110
What a disagreeable old man
I have become.

748
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:15,669
You're a reporter and you want to know
what I think about Charlie Kane.

749
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:21,389
I suppose he had some private sort
of greatness.

750
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:23,149
But he kept it to himself.

751
00:48:23,229 --> 00:48:26,028
He never gave himself away.
He never gave anything away.

752
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:28,948
He just left you a tip.

753
00:48:30,388 --> 00:48:31,748
He had a generous mind.

754
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:34,827
I don't suppose anybody
ever had so many opinions.

755
00:48:35,147 --> 00:48:37,707
But he never believed in anything
except Charlie Kane.

756
00:48:37,787 --> 00:48:41,267
He never had a conviction
except Charlie Kane in his life.

757
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:43,667
I suppose he died without one.

758
00:48:43,867 --> 00:48:46,346
That must have been pretty unpleasant.

759
00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:51,106
Of course, a lot of us check out without
having any special convictions about death.

760
00:48:51,186 --> 00:48:54,305
But we do know what we're leaving.
We do believe in something.

761
00:48:54,985 --> 00:48:57,865
Are you absolutely sure
you haven't got a cigar?

762
00:48:58,025 --> 00:48:59,945
-Sorry, Mr. Leland.
-Never mind.

763
00:48:59,985 --> 00:49:03,465
-What do you know about Rosebud?
-"Rosebud"?

764
00:49:04,424 --> 00:49:07,504
His dying words: "Rosebud."

765
00:49:07,824 --> 00:49:09,864
<i>I saw that in the Inquirer.</i>

766
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:13,744
<i>I never believed anything
I saw in the Inquirer.</i>

767
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,183
Anything else?

768
00:49:15,183 --> 00:49:18,743
I can tell you about Emily.
I went to dancing school with Emily.

769
00:49:19,183 --> 00:49:20,823
I was very graceful.

770
00:49:21,783 --> 00:49:25,022
-We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane.
-What was she like?

771
00:49:25,102 --> 00:49:27,462
She was like all the girls I knew
in dancing school.

772
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:30,502
Very nice girl. Emily was a little nicer.

773
00:49:31,862 --> 00:49:33,902
After the first couple of months...

774
00:49:33,942 --> 00:49:38,101
...she and Charlie didn't see much
of each other except at breakfast.

775
00:49:38,701 --> 00:49:41,261
It was a marriage
just like any other marriage.

776
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,700
-You're beautiful.
-l can't be.

777
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,419
Yes, you are. You're very beautiful.

778
00:49:54,539 --> 00:49:56,979
I've never been to six parties
in one night before.

779
00:49:57,179 --> 00:49:59,819
-I've never been up this late.
-It痴 a matter of habit.

780
00:49:59,899 --> 00:50:02,739
-What will the servants think?
-That we enjoyed ourselves.

781
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:05,218
Why do you have to go straight off
to the newspaper?

782
00:50:05,298 --> 00:50:08,898
You never should've married a
newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.

783
00:50:09,738 --> 00:50:11,578
I absolutely adore you.

784
00:50:12,418 --> 00:50:15,177
Charles, even newspapermen
have to sleep.

785
00:50:16,657 --> 00:50:19,937
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him
put off my appointments till noon.

786
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:22,257
What time is it?

787
00:50:22,857 --> 00:50:24,456
I don't know. It's late.

788
00:50:26,736 --> 00:50:28,576
It's early.

789
00:50:28,656 --> 00:50:30,336
Charles....

790
00:50:30,856 --> 00:50:33,736
Do you know how long
you kept me waiting last night...

791
00:50:33,776 --> 00:50:36,535
...when you went to the newspaper
for 10 minutes?

792
00:50:36,775 --> 00:50:39,815
What do you do in a newspaper
in the middle of the night?

793
00:50:39,975 --> 00:50:44,774
<i>My dear, your only correspondent
is the Inquirer.</i>

794
00:50:44,774 --> 00:50:47,534
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival
of flesh and blood.

795
00:50:47,574 --> 00:50:50,054
I don't spend that much time
on the newspaper.

796
00:50:50,094 --> 00:50:54,014
It isn't just the time.
It's what you print, attacking the President.

797
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:57,173
-You mean Uncle John.
-l mean the President of the United States.

798
00:50:57,253 --> 00:50:59,653
He's still Uncle John
and a well-meaning fathead...

799
00:50:59,693 --> 00:51:02,973
...who's letting a pack of high-pressure
crooks run his administration.

800
00:51:03,053 --> 00:51:06,692
-This whole oil scandal--
-He happens to be the President, not you.

801
00:51:06,732 --> 00:51:09,412
That's a mistake that will be corrected
one of these days.

802
00:51:09,492 --> 00:51:14,571
Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior
the most incredible atrocity yesterday.

803
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:18,051
I simply can't have it in the nursery.

804
00:51:20,131 --> 00:51:23,291
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit
to the nursery now and then.

805
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,850
Does he have to?

806
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:26,850
Yes.

807
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:31,210
-Really, Charles, people will think--
-What I tell them to think.

808
00:51:49,248 --> 00:51:51,208
Wasn't he ever in love with her?

809
00:51:51,368 --> 00:51:53,088
He married for love.

810
00:51:53,968 --> 00:51:55,287
Love.

811
00:51:55,887 --> 00:51:57,567
That is why he did everything.

812
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:00,487
That's why he went into politics.
It seems we weren't enough.

813
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:03,447
He wanted all the voters to love him, too.

814
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:06,566
All he wanted out of life was love.

815
00:52:07,366 --> 00:52:10,446
That's Charlie's story. How he lost it.

816
00:52:10,646 --> 00:52:13,726
You see, he just didn't have any to give.

817
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:17,365
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.

818
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,285
Very dearly.

819
00:52:19,965 --> 00:52:22,085
And his mother,
I guess he always loved her.

820
00:52:22,165 --> 00:52:25,124
-How about his second wife?
-Susan Alexander?

821
00:52:25,884 --> 00:52:27,964
You know what Charlie called her?

822
00:52:28,164 --> 00:52:30,804
The day after he'd met her,
he told me about her.

823
00:52:30,924 --> 00:52:35,643
He said she was
"a cross-section of the American public."

824
00:52:37,763 --> 00:52:41,283
I guess he couldn't help it.
She must have had something for him.

825
00:52:41,443 --> 00:52:44,083
That first night, according to Charlie...

826
00:52:45,122 --> 00:52:47,362
...all she had was a toothache.

827
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,559
What are you laughing at, young lady?

828
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,999
-What's the matter with you?
-Toothache.

829
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:25,758
-What?
-Toothache.

830
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:27,118
Toothache?

831
00:53:30,398 --> 00:53:32,358
You mean you've got a toothache.

832
00:53:33,238 --> 00:53:35,997
-What's funny about that?
-You're funny, mister.

833
00:53:36,077 --> 00:53:38,517
-You've got dirt on your face.
-Not dirt, it's mud.

834
00:53:38,597 --> 00:53:40,797
Do you want some hot water?
I live right here.

835
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,797
What's that, young lady?

836
00:53:43,957 --> 00:53:46,316
I said, if you wanted some hot water...

837
00:53:46,636 --> 00:53:50,596
...l could get you some...hot water.

838
00:53:54,036 --> 00:53:56,275
All right, thank you very much.

839
00:54:10,074 --> 00:54:11,954
Do I look any better now?

840
00:54:11,994 --> 00:54:16,553
-This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
-What you need is to get your mind off it.

841
00:54:21,513 --> 00:54:24,513
Excuse me, but my landlady
prefers me to keep this door open...

842
00:54:24,753 --> 00:54:27,632
-...when I have a gentleman caller.
-All right.

843
00:54:27,672 --> 00:54:29,712
You have got a toothache, haven't you?

844
00:54:29,752 --> 00:54:32,672
-l surely have.
-Why don't you try laughing at me again?

845
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:34,672
-What?
-I知 still pretty funny.

846
00:54:34,712 --> 00:54:37,231
I know, but you don't want me
to laugh at you.

847
00:54:37,271 --> 00:54:39,231
I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.

848
00:54:39,311 --> 00:54:40,591
Look at me.

849
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:42,071
See that?

850
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:43,431
What are you doing?

851
00:54:43,511 --> 00:54:45,830
I'm wiggling both my ears
at the same time.

852
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,710
That's it, smile.

853
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,909
It took me two solid years at the best
boys' school in the world to learn that.

854
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:59,069
The fellow who taught me
is now president of Venezuela.

855
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:02,309
That's it!

856
00:55:05,948 --> 00:55:08,428
-Is it a giraffe?
-No, not a giraffe.

857
00:55:08,508 --> 00:55:11,268
-l bet it is.
-What?

858
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,388
Well, then it's an elephant.

859
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:17,147
-It痴 supposed to be a rooster.
-A rooster!

860
00:55:17,627 --> 00:55:21,267
You know an awful lot of tricks.
Are you a professional magician?

861
00:55:21,387 --> 00:55:23,867
-No, I'm not a magician.
-l was just joking.

862
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:25,546
You really don't know who I am?

863
00:55:25,586 --> 00:55:28,586
You told me your name, Mr. Kane,
but I'm awfully ignorant.

864
00:55:28,626 --> 00:55:32,946
I guess you caught on to that.
I bet I've heard your name a million times.

865
00:55:33,106 --> 00:55:36,105
You really like me, though,
even though you don't know who I am?

866
00:55:36,145 --> 00:55:39,465
I surely do. You've been wonderful.

867
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:43,145
Without you I don't know
what I would have done.

868
00:55:43,185 --> 00:55:46,384
I had a toothache,
and I don't know many people.

869
00:55:46,664 --> 00:55:48,504
I know too many people.

870
00:55:48,904 --> 00:55:50,864
I guess we're both lonely.

871
00:55:51,144 --> 00:55:54,984
Want to know what I was going to do
before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?

872
00:55:55,024 --> 00:55:58,183
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.
You probably have more.

873
00:55:58,223 --> 00:55:59,383
I was just joking.

874
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:04,823
I was on my way
to the Western Manhattan Warehouse...

875
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,822
...in search of my youth.

876
00:56:07,862 --> 00:56:12,302
You see, my mother died a long time ago.
Her things were put in storage out West.

877
00:56:12,382 --> 00:56:14,742
There wasn't any other place to put them.

878
00:56:14,822 --> 00:56:18,701
I thought I'd send for them now.
Tonight I was going to take a look at them.

879
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:20,901
A sort of sentimental journey.

880
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:26,580
I run a couple of newspapers.
What do you do?

881
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:27,620
Me?

882
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,020
-How old did you say you were?
-l didn't say.

883
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,700
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.

884
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:33,980
-How old?
-Pretty old.

885
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,059
-How old?
-Twenty-two in August.

886
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:38,059
That's a ripe old age. What do you do?

887
00:56:38,139 --> 00:56:41,459
I work at Seligman's.
I'm in charge of the sheet music.

888
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:46,138
-Is that what you want to do?
-No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.

889
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:50,298
-That is, I didn't. My mother did for me.
-What happened to the singing?

890
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:54,218
Mother always thought, she always talked
about grand opera for me.

891
00:56:54,298 --> 00:56:55,458
Imagine.

892
00:56:55,737 --> 00:56:59,777
But my voice isn't that kind.
It's just, you know what mothers are like.

893
00:57:01,497 --> 00:57:02,657
Yes.

894
00:57:04,617 --> 00:57:07,296
-Have you got a piano?
-A piano?

895
00:57:08,256 --> 00:57:09,976
Yes, there's one in the parlor.

896
00:57:10,056 --> 00:57:12,976
-Would you sing for me?
-You wouldn't want to hear me sing.

897
00:57:13,056 --> 00:57:14,376
Yes, I would.

898
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:18,255
Don't tell me
your toothache is bothering you.

899
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,975
No, that's all gone.

900
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:23,535
All right.

901
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:26,214
Let's go to the parlor.

902
00:57:26,214 --> 00:57:31,814
"Yes, Lindor shall be mine

903
00:57:33,134 --> 00:57:36,533
"l have sworn it

904
00:57:37,373 --> 00:57:40,093
"For weal or woe

905
00:57:42,093 --> 00:57:44,733
"Yes, Lindor

906
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:54,372
<i>"Lo giurai</i>

907
00:57:55,731 --> 00:57:59,491
<i>"La vincer"</i>

908
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:09,570
There is only one man
who can rid the politics...

909
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:12,770
...of this state of the evil domination
of Boss Jim Gettys.

910
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:16,609
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane,
the fighting liberal...

911
00:58:16,649 --> 00:58:20,089
...the friend of the workingman,
the next governor of this state...

912
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,329
...who entered upon this campaign....

913
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:24,289
<i>...with one purpose only:</i>

914
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:28,528
<i>To point out
and make public the dishonesty...</i>

915
00:58:28,768 --> 00:58:33,368
<i>...the downright villainy
of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine...</i>

916
00:58:33,688 --> 00:58:37,807
<i>...now in complete control
of the government of this state.</i>

917
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,847
<i>I made no campaign promises...</i>

918
00:58:42,367 --> 00:58:46,806
<i>...because, until a few weeks ago,
I had no hope of being elected.</i>

919
00:58:48,326 --> 00:58:52,366
<i>Now, however, l have something more
than a hope.</i>

920
00:58:55,446 --> 00:58:57,885
<i>Jim Gettys has something less
than a chance.</i>

921
00:59:02,085 --> 00:59:03,925
<i>Every straw vote...</i>

922
00:59:04,085 --> 00:59:08,724
<i>...every independent poll shows
that l will be elected.</i>

923
00:59:09,124 --> 00:59:10,764
<i>Very well.</i>

924
00:59:10,924 --> 00:59:13,564
<i>Now l can afford to make some promises.</i>

925
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:25,563
<i>The workingman and the slum child...</i>

926
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:30,522
<i>...know they can expect
my best efforts in their interests.</i>

927
00:59:30,602 --> 00:59:34,962
<i>The decent, ordinary citizens know
that I値l do everything in my power...</i>

928
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:40,041
<i>...to protect the underprivileged,
the underpaid, and the underfed.</i>

929
00:59:43,801 --> 00:59:48,000
-Mother, is Pop governor yet?
-Not yet, Junior.

930
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,960
<i>I'd make my promises now...</i>

931
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,599
<i>...if I weren't too busy
arranging to keep them.</i>

932
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:05,839
<i>But here's one promise I値l make...</i>

933
01:00:05,919 --> 01:00:08,838
<i>...and Boss Jim Gettys knows I値l keep it.</i>

934
01:00:10,078 --> 01:00:12,798
<i>My first official act
as governor of this state...</i>

935
01:00:13,198 --> 01:00:17,877
<i>...will be to appoint a special district
attorney to arrange for the indictment...</i>

936
01:00:18,077 --> 01:00:23,557
<i>...prosecution and conviction
of Boss Jim W. Gettys.</i>

937
01:00:48,714 --> 01:00:51,834
If the election were held today,
you'd be in by 100,000 votes.

938
01:00:51,874 --> 01:00:53,634
-Gettys isn't even pretending.
-Pop.

939
01:00:53,714 --> 01:00:55,754
-Hello, son.
-He isn't just scared, he's sick.

940
01:00:55,834 --> 01:00:58,553
It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys
I mean what I say.

941
01:00:58,633 --> 01:01:01,873
-Did you like your old man's speech?
-l could hear every word.

942
01:01:01,913 --> 01:01:03,513
-Hello, Emily.
-Hold it.

943
01:01:04,073 --> 01:01:06,632
-Great speech, Mr. Kane.
-Wonderful.

944
01:01:06,672 --> 01:01:08,912
Will you get us a taxi?

945
01:01:10,232 --> 01:01:13,032
I'm sending Junior home
in the car with Oliver.

946
01:01:13,392 --> 01:01:14,992
Good night, Father.

947
01:01:16,232 --> 01:01:18,071
Goodbye, son.

948
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:31,630
Why did you send Junior home in the car?
What are you doing in a taxi?

949
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:33,790
There's a call I want you to make with me.

950
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:35,670
-It can wait.
-No, it can't.

951
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:37,349
What's this all about, Emily?

952
01:01:37,429 --> 01:01:40,549
It may not be about anything at all.
I intend to find out.

953
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:44,549
-Where are you going?
-I知 going to "185 West 74th Street."

954
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,828
If you wish, you may come with me.

955
01:01:52,828 --> 01:01:54,308
I'll come with you.

956
01:01:59,307 --> 01:02:02,627
I had no idea you had this flair
for melodrama, Emily.

957
01:02:04,107 --> 01:02:06,027
Come right in, Mr. Kane.

958
01:02:16,146 --> 01:02:17,465
Charlie.

959
01:02:23,905 --> 01:02:26,904
He forced me to send your wife that letter.
I didn't want to.

960
01:02:26,984 --> 01:02:29,624
He's been saying the most terrible....

961
01:02:33,744 --> 01:02:35,384
Mrs. Kane.

962
01:02:37,263 --> 01:02:39,663
I don't suppose
anybody would introduce us.

963
01:02:41,103 --> 01:02:42,583
I'm Jim Gettys.

964
01:02:43,183 --> 01:02:44,303
Yes?

965
01:02:46,882 --> 01:02:50,522
I made Miss Alexander send you the note,
Mrs. Kane.

966
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:52,762
She didn't want to at first. But she did it.

967
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:55,482
Charlie, the things he said to me....
He threatened to--

968
01:02:56,561 --> 01:03:00,281
I won't wait until I'm elected.
To start with, I think I'll break your neck.

969
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:03,001
Maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't.

970
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:07,960
Your breaking this man's neck
would scarcely explain this note:

971
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,600
"Serious consequences for Mr. Kane,
for yourself and for your son."

972
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,560
-He wanted to get her to come here--
-What does this note mean?

973
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,159
I'm Susan Alexander.
I know what you're thinking--

974
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:20,879
-What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander?
-She don't know.

975
01:03:20,959 --> 01:03:23,719
She sent it because I told her
it wouldn't be smart not to.

976
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:26,958
-Emily, this gentleman--
-I知 not a gentleman.

977
01:03:27,158 --> 01:03:29,878
Your husband is only trying to be funny
calling me one.

978
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:32,478
I don't even know what a gentleman is.

979
01:03:33,478 --> 01:03:36,558
You see, my idea of a gentleman....

980
01:03:39,597 --> 01:03:42,917
If I owned a paper and didn't like
the way somebody was doing things...

981
01:03:42,957 --> 01:03:45,317
...some politician,
I'd fight him with all I had.

982
01:03:45,357 --> 01:03:47,156
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit...

983
01:03:47,236 --> 01:03:49,476
...so his family could see his picture
in the paper.

984
01:03:49,516 --> 01:03:53,356
-You're a cheap, crooked grafter--
-We're talking now about what you are.

985
01:03:54,196 --> 01:03:56,955
I'm fighting for my life,
not just my political life.

986
01:03:57,035 --> 01:03:59,115
-He said unless you--
-That's what I said.

987
01:03:59,195 --> 01:04:02,995
Here's the chance I'm willing to give him.
It's more of a chance than he'd give me.

988
01:04:03,075 --> 01:04:07,674
Unless he decides by tomorrow that
he's so sick he has to go away for a year...

989
01:04:07,754 --> 01:04:11,834
...Monday morning, all papers in the state,
except his, will carry the story I'll give.

990
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,274
What story?

991
01:04:13,994 --> 01:04:17,073
-The story about him and Ms. Alexander.
-There isn't any story!

992
01:04:17,113 --> 01:04:18,273
Shut up.

993
01:04:18,633 --> 01:04:21,393
We've got evidence that would look bad
in the headlines.

994
01:04:21,433 --> 01:04:23,953
Do you want me to give you the evidence?

995
01:04:25,993 --> 01:04:28,752
I'd rather he withdrew
without having the story published.

996
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:31,712
Not that I care about him,
but I'd be better off that way.

997
01:04:34,552 --> 01:04:36,552
So would you, Mrs. Kane.

998
01:04:36,951 --> 01:04:38,951
What about me?

999
01:04:40,871 --> 01:04:44,551
He said my name would be dragged
through the mud. That everywhere I went--

1000
01:04:44,591 --> 01:04:47,310
There seems to be only one decision
you can make, Charles.

1001
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,030
I'd say that it'd been made for you.

1002
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,590
You can't tell me the voters of this state--

1003
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:56,550
I'm not interested in the voters
of this state right now.

1004
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:57,989
I am interested in our son.

1005
01:04:58,029 --> 01:05:01,109
-Charlie, if they publish this story--
-They won't.

1006
01:05:02,349 --> 01:05:04,389
Good night, Mr. Gettys.

1007
01:05:12,948 --> 01:05:14,908
Are you coming, Charles?

1008
01:05:17,067 --> 01:05:18,387
No.

1009
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,227
I'm staying here.

1010
01:05:26,227 --> 01:05:28,186
I can fight this all alone.

1011
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,826
If you don't listen to reason,
it may be too late.

1012
01:05:31,906 --> 01:05:35,666
Too late? For what?

1013
01:05:37,705 --> 01:05:40,865
For you and this public thief...

1014
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:43,385
...to take the love of the people
away from me?

1015
01:05:43,425 --> 01:05:46,145
You got other things to think about.
Your little boy.

1016
01:05:46,265 --> 01:05:48,624
You don't want him to read about you
in the papers.

1017
01:05:48,704 --> 01:05:53,024
There's only one person in the world
to decide what I'll do. And that's me.

1018
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:59,143
You decided what you were going to do,
Charles, some time ago.

1019
01:06:06,143 --> 01:06:08,702
You're making a bigger fool of yourself
than I thought.

1020
01:06:08,742 --> 01:06:10,982
-I致e got nothing to say to you.
-You're licked--

1021
01:06:11,062 --> 01:06:14,302
Get out. If you want to see me,
have the warden write me a letter.

1022
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:19,021
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going
to happen to you would be a lesson to you.

1023
01:06:19,301 --> 01:06:21,901
Only you're going to need
more than one lesson.

1024
01:06:22,701 --> 01:06:26,541
-And you'll get more than one lesson.
-Don't worry about me, Gettys.

1025
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:30,140
Don't worry about me!

1026
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,500
I'm Charles Foster Kane!

1027
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:38,179
I'm no cheap, crooked politician
trying to save himself...

1028
01:06:38,219 --> 01:06:41,099
...from the consequences of his crimes!

1029
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:45,979
Gettys! I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.

1030
01:06:46,179 --> 01:06:48,218
Sing Sing, Gettys.

1031
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:54,218
-Have you a car, Mrs. Kane?
-Yes, thank you.

1032
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:57,417
-Good night.
-Good night.

1033
01:07:07,776 --> 01:07:11,576
<i>Paper. Read all about it. Extra, extra.</i>

1034
01:07:15,936 --> 01:07:17,935
-Paper?
-No, thanks.

1035
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,934
With a million majority
already against him...

1036
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:38,333
...and the church counties
still to be heard from...

1037
01:07:38,533 --> 01:07:40,893
...I知 afraid we got no choice.

1038
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:42,333
This one?

1039
01:07:45,653 --> 01:07:47,293
That one.

1040
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:11,450
Good night again.

1041
01:08:22,169 --> 01:08:25,489
-Is there anything I can--
-No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.

1042
01:08:27,049 --> 01:08:29,248
You better go home and get some sleep.

1043
01:08:30,288 --> 01:08:31,728
You, too.

1044
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:35,768
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1045
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:02,325
-Hello, Jedediah.
-I知 drunk.

1046
01:09:05,845 --> 01:09:10,764
If you've got drunk to talk to me about...

1047
01:09:13,204 --> 01:09:15,644
...Ms. Alexander, don't bother.

1048
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,123
I'm not interested.

1049
01:09:23,163 --> 01:09:26,883
I've set back the sacred cause of reform,
is that it?

1050
01:09:28,282 --> 01:09:29,642
All right.

1051
01:09:31,322 --> 01:09:34,442
If that's the way they want it,
the people have made their choice.

1052
01:09:34,562 --> 01:09:37,242
It's obvious the people prefer
Jim Gettys to me.

1053
01:09:37,322 --> 01:09:40,841
You talk about the people
as though you owned them.

1054
01:09:40,921 --> 01:09:43,121
As though they belong to you. Goodness.

1055
01:09:43,841 --> 01:09:48,440
As long as I can remember, you've talked
about giving the people their rights...

1056
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,720
...as if you could make them
a present of liberty...

1057
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,280
...as a reward for services rendered.

1058
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,640
-Jed.
-You remember the workingman?

1059
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,879
I'll get drunk, too, Jedediah...

1060
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:02,519
...if it'll do any good.

1061
01:10:02,599 --> 01:10:05,879
It won't do any good.
Besides you never get drunk.

1062
01:10:05,999 --> 01:10:08,718
You used to write an awful lot
about the workingman--

1063
01:10:08,718 --> 01:10:09,638
Go on home.

1064
01:10:09,678 --> 01:10:12,438
He's turning into something called
"organized labor."

1065
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:17,358
You won't like that one little bit
when you find out...

1066
01:10:17,438 --> 01:10:22,357
...it means your workingman expects
something as his right, and not your gift.

1067
01:10:24,357 --> 01:10:28,676
When your precious underprivileged
really get together....

1068
01:10:29,236 --> 01:10:30,996
Oh, boy....

1069
01:10:31,756 --> 01:10:34,596
That'll add up to something
bigger than your privilege...

1070
01:10:34,676 --> 01:10:37,516
...then I don't know what you'll do.

1071
01:10:37,556 --> 01:10:42,635
Sail away to a desert island probably
and lord it over the monkeys.

1072
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:45,955
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

1073
01:10:46,355 --> 01:10:50,994
There'll probably be a few of them there
to tell me when I do something wrong.

1074
01:10:51,194 --> 01:10:53,194
You may not always be so lucky.

1075
01:10:53,994 --> 01:10:55,394
You're not very drunk.

1076
01:10:55,434 --> 01:10:57,434
Drunk, what do you care?

1077
01:10:57,794 --> 01:11:00,553
You don't care about anything except you.

1078
01:11:01,513 --> 01:11:07,113
You persuade people that you love them
so much that they ought to love you back.

1079
01:11:07,433 --> 01:11:09,952
Only you want love on your own terms.

1080
01:11:11,592 --> 01:11:14,912
It's something to be played your way,
according to your rules.

1081
01:11:21,271 --> 01:11:24,351
-Let me work on the Chicago paper.
-What?

1082
01:11:24,631 --> 01:11:29,230
You said you were looking for someone
to do dramatic "crimitism," criticism.

1083
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:31,110
I am drunk.

1084
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,470
I want to go to Chicago.

1085
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,389
You're too valuable here.

1086
01:11:40,549 --> 01:11:44,349
-There's nothing left for me to do--
-All right, you can go to Chicago.

1087
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:45,629
Thank you.

1088
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:49,108
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.

1089
01:11:50,748 --> 01:11:53,148
I warn you, Jedediah,
you won't like Chicago.

1090
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:57,628
The wind comes off the lake, and they've
probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.

1091
01:11:57,708 --> 01:11:59,827
Will Saturday after next be all right?

1092
01:11:59,907 --> 01:12:01,787
-Anytime you say.
-Thank you.

1093
01:12:07,267 --> 01:12:12,026
A toast to love on my terms.
Those are the only terms anybody knows:

1094
01:12:13,626 --> 01:12:14,786
His own.

1095
01:12:27,145 --> 01:12:29,584
<i>Mr. Kane, I'm from the Inquirer.</i>

1096
01:12:38,463 --> 01:12:41,303
-What's that, young man?
-Are you through with politics?

1097
01:12:41,383 --> 01:12:43,943
Am I through with politics?
I would say vice versa.

1098
01:12:45,263 --> 01:12:46,903
We're going to be an opera star.

1099
01:12:46,943 --> 01:12:48,742
Are you singing at the Metropolitan?

1100
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,182
We certainly are.

1101
01:12:50,302 --> 01:12:53,062
Charlie said if I didn't,
he'd build me an opera house.

1102
01:12:53,142 --> 01:12:54,622
That won't be necessary.

1103
01:12:59,261 --> 01:13:02,421
No, no, no!

1104
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:36,058
Places, please!

1105
01:14:23,133 --> 01:14:25,813
Mr. Leland is writing it
from the dramatic angle?

1106
01:14:25,893 --> 01:14:29,212
-And we've covered it from the news end.
-And the social.

1107
01:14:30,052 --> 01:14:32,172
How about the music notice?

1108
01:14:32,212 --> 01:14:34,172
Yes, it's already made up.

1109
01:14:34,212 --> 01:14:36,772
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.

1110
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:42,251
-Enthusiastic?
-Yes, sir.

1111
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:44,931
Mr. Kane. This is a surprise.

1112
01:14:47,411 --> 01:14:49,330
We've got two spreads of pictures.

1113
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:51,130
The music notice on the front page?

1114
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:54,730
But there's still one notice to come.
The dramatic.

1115
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:57,330
The dramatic notice.

1116
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:02,809
-Mr. Bernstein, that's Mr. Leland, isn't it?
-Yes, we're waiting for it.

1117
01:15:06,489 --> 01:15:09,488
-Where is he?
-Right in there, Mr. Kane.

1118
01:15:17,048 --> 01:15:18,448
Mr. Kane.

1119
01:15:32,686 --> 01:15:35,206
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane...

1120
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:39,405
...haven't spoken together for years.

1121
01:15:41,925 --> 01:15:44,485
-You don't suppose--
-There's nothing to suppose.

1122
01:15:48,685 --> 01:15:49,924
Excuse me.

1123
01:16:06,283 --> 01:16:07,763
Close the door.

1124
01:16:10,922 --> 01:16:13,402
He ain't been drinking before.

1125
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:16,202
Never. We would have heard.

1126
01:16:16,562 --> 01:16:18,402
What does it say there?

1127
01:16:18,921 --> 01:16:21,441
The notice, what's he written?

1128
01:16:23,081 --> 01:16:27,881
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty
but hopelessly incompetent amateur...

1129
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,920
"...last night opened
the new Chicago Opera House...

1130
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:36,920
"...in a performance of...."

1131
01:16:39,919 --> 01:16:43,319
I still can't pronounce that name.

1132
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:50,438
"Her singing, happily,
is no concern of this department.

1133
01:16:50,878 --> 01:16:54,598
"Of her acting,
it is absolutely impossible to...."

1134
01:16:56,238 --> 01:16:57,358
Go on.

1135
01:16:59,757 --> 01:17:01,637
That's all there is.

1136
01:17:14,236 --> 01:17:17,636
Of her acting it is absolutely
impossible to say anything except...

1137
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:21,115
...that, in the opinion of this reviewer,
it represents a new low.

1138
01:17:21,315 --> 01:17:24,155
-In the opinion of this reviewer.
-l didn't see that.

1139
01:17:24,235 --> 01:17:26,475
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein, I'm dictating it.

1140
01:17:26,555 --> 01:17:29,314
-Mr. Kane, l--
-Get me a typewriter.

1141
01:17:30,754 --> 01:17:33,034
I'm going to finish Mr. Leland's notice.

1142
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:51,232
Hello, Bernstein.

1143
01:17:56,192 --> 01:17:59,391
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Leland.

1144
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,591
Where's my notice, Bernstein?
I've got to finish my notice.

1145
01:18:05,671 --> 01:18:08,791
-Mr. Kane is finishing it for you.
-Charlie?

1146
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:16,790
Charlie out there?

1147
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:20,869
I guess he's fixing it up.

1148
01:18:23,149 --> 01:18:25,469
I knew I'd never get that through.

1149
01:18:26,309 --> 01:18:30,108
Mr. Kane's finishing your review
just the way you started it.

1150
01:18:30,548 --> 01:18:34,108
He's writing a bad notice
like you wanted it to be.

1151
01:18:36,468 --> 01:18:38,428
I guess that'll show you.

1152
01:19:02,305 --> 01:19:04,105
Hello, Jedediah.

1153
01:19:07,265 --> 01:19:08,625
Hello, Charlie.

1154
01:19:10,184 --> 01:19:12,864
I didn't know we were speaking.

1155
01:19:13,184 --> 01:19:15,344
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.

1156
01:19:17,304 --> 01:19:19,423
You're fired.

1157
01:19:31,222 --> 01:19:35,582
<i>Everybody knows that story, Mr. Leland,
but why did he do it?</i>

1158
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:40,061
-How could a man write a notice--
-You just don't know Charlie.

1159
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:43,861
He thought that by finishing that notice
he'd show me he was an honest man.

1160
01:19:43,941 --> 01:19:46,101
He was always trying to prove something.

1161
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:49,221
That whole thing about Susie
being an opera singer.

1162
01:19:49,301 --> 01:19:51,460
That was trying to prove something.

1163
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:55,420
You know what the headline was
the day before the election?

1164
01:19:55,780 --> 01:20:01,499
<i>"Candidate Kane found
in love nest with 'singer."'</i>

1165
01:20:01,579 --> 01:20:03,659
He was going to take
the quotes off the singer.

1166
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:04,779
Hey, nurse!

1167
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:08,739
Five years ago he wrote
from that place down there in the South.

1168
01:20:08,819 --> 01:20:16,138
What's it called, Shangri-la? EI Dorado?
Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?

1169
01:20:17,338 --> 01:20:21,457
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.

1170
01:20:21,537 --> 01:20:25,537
You caught on, didn't you?
I'm not that hard to see through.

1171
01:20:25,897 --> 01:20:28,177
Well, I never even answered his letter.

1172
01:20:28,977 --> 01:20:30,256
Maybe I should have.

1173
01:20:30,336 --> 01:20:34,256
I guess he was pretty lonely down there
in that coliseum all those years.

1174
01:20:34,656 --> 01:20:37,656
He hadn't finished it when she left him.
He never finished it.

1175
01:20:37,736 --> 01:20:40,815
He never finished anything
except my notice.

1176
01:20:41,175 --> 01:20:44,215
-Of course, he built the joint for her.
-That must have been love.

1177
01:20:44,295 --> 01:20:45,215
I don't know.

1178
01:20:45,455 --> 01:20:49,774
He was disappointed in the world
so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.

1179
01:20:50,454 --> 01:20:52,934
It was something bigger
than an opera house anyway.

1180
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:54,334
-Nurse.
-Yes, Mr. Leland.

1181
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:55,694
I'm coming.

1182
01:20:57,214 --> 01:21:00,573
-There's one thing you can do for me.
-Sure.

1183
01:21:00,693 --> 01:21:05,133
Stop at the cigar store on your way out,
and get me a couple of good cigars.

1184
01:21:05,213 --> 01:21:07,213
-Be glad to.
-Thank you.

1185
01:21:07,693 --> 01:21:09,013
One is enough.

1186
01:21:09,413 --> 01:21:13,652
When I was a young man, there was
an impression that nurses were pretty.

1187
01:21:13,692 --> 01:21:15,652
Well, it was no truer then than it is today.

1188
01:21:15,732 --> 01:21:17,772
-I値l take your arm.
-All right.

1189
01:21:17,852 --> 01:21:20,491
-You won't forget about those cigars?
-l won't.

1190
01:21:20,691 --> 01:21:25,451
Have them wrapped like toothpaste,
or they'll stop them at the desk.

1191
01:21:25,491 --> 01:21:28,291
You know that young doctor
I was telling you about, well...

1192
01:21:28,371 --> 01:21:32,090
...he's got an idea
he wants to keep me alive.

1193
01:22:00,167 --> 01:22:04,007
I'd rather you'd just talk.
Anything that comes into your mind...

1194
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:06,807
...about yourself and Mr. Kane.

1195
01:22:07,007 --> 01:22:12,086
You don't want to hear what comes into
my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.

1196
01:22:13,606 --> 01:22:18,206
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung
for Charlie that first time I met him.

1197
01:22:19,406 --> 01:22:22,205
But I did an awful lot of singing after that.

1198
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:27,725
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.

1199
01:22:27,765 --> 01:22:30,244
-The teachers got that, I didn't.
-What did you get?

1200
01:22:30,324 --> 01:22:33,764
I didn't get a thing, except music lessons.
That's all there was in it.

1201
01:22:33,804 --> 01:22:35,204
He married you, didn't he?

1202
01:22:35,244 --> 01:22:38,564
He didn't mention anything about marriage
until after it was over and...

1203
01:22:38,684 --> 01:22:40,923
...until it got in the papers about us...

1204
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:45,683
...and he lost the election,
and that Norton woman divorced him.

1205
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:47,963
He was really interested in my voice.

1206
01:22:48,043 --> 01:22:49,563
Why did he build that opera house?

1207
01:22:49,603 --> 01:22:53,322
I didn't want it. I didn't want a thing.
It was his idea.

1208
01:22:54,642 --> 01:22:56,642
Everything was his idea...

1209
01:22:59,482 --> 01:23:01,401
...except my leaving him.

1210
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:13,520
"Don't forget"

1211
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,000
Don't get nervous.

1212
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,720
Please. Let's come back.

1213
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:22,319
Look at me, Mrs. Kane, darling.

1214
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:30,998
"Get the voice out of the throat
Place the tone right in the mask

1215
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:38,238
"Diaphragm"

1216
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,637
You're out of pitch.

1217
01:23:51,236 --> 01:23:54,196
Some people can sing. Some can't.

1218
01:23:54,356 --> 01:23:55,836
Impossible.

1219
01:23:56,716 --> 01:23:59,676
It's not your job to give your opinion
of Mrs. Kane's talents.

1220
01:24:01,515 --> 01:24:04,955
<i>You're supposed to train her voice,
Signor Matiste. Nothing more.</i>

1221
01:24:05,635 --> 01:24:07,355
Please continue with the lesson.

1222
01:24:07,395 --> 01:24:09,755
-But, Mr. Kane.
-Please.

1223
01:24:10,714 --> 01:24:14,434
I'll be the laughingstock
of the musical world. People will think--

1224
01:24:14,474 --> 01:24:17,314
You're concerned what people will think?

1225
01:24:17,354 --> 01:24:21,753
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit.
I'm an authority on what people will think.

1226
01:24:22,473 --> 01:24:24,153
The newspapers for example.

1227
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:27,033
I run several newspapers
between here and San Francisco.

1228
01:24:27,073 --> 01:24:28,473
It's all right, darling.

1229
01:24:28,673 --> 01:24:30,832
<i>Signor Matiste is going to listen to reason.</i>

1230
01:24:31,712 --> 01:24:34,352
-How can I persuade you--
-You can't.

1231
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:01,549
It's all right, darling, go ahead.

1232
01:25:12,828 --> 01:25:15,508
I thought you'd see it my way.

1233
01:25:24,307 --> 01:25:28,067
No, no, no.

A friend don't write that kind of review.

1258
01:28:51,486 --> 01:28:54,766
All these other papers panning me,
I could expect that.

1259
01:28:54,846 --> 01:28:58,486
<i>But for the Inquirer to run a thing like that,
spoiling my whole debut.</i>

1260
01:28:58,526 --> 01:28:59,286
Come in.

1261
01:28:59,326 --> 01:29:00,246
I'll get it.

1262
01:29:00,326 --> 01:29:03,085
Friend. Not the kind of friends I know...

1263
01:29:03,365 --> 01:29:05,245
...but I'm not high class like you.

1264
01:29:05,525 --> 01:29:07,445
And I never went to any swell schools.

1265
01:29:07,565 --> 01:29:08,965
That'll be enough, Susan.

1266
01:29:09,005 --> 01:29:10,165
From Mr. Leland, sir.

1267
01:29:10,685 --> 01:29:13,684
He wanted me to make sure
you got this personally.

1268
01:29:13,964 --> 01:29:16,524
Is that something from him?

1269
01:29:17,884 --> 01:29:19,044
Charlie!

1270
01:29:19,844 --> 01:29:23,483
As for you,
you ought to have your head examined.

1271
01:29:23,683 --> 01:29:26,163
Sending him a letter telling him he's fired...

1272
01:29:26,203 --> 01:29:28,643
...with a $25,000 check in it.

1273
01:29:28,723 --> 01:29:31,122
What kind of firing do you call that?

1274
01:29:31,762 --> 01:29:35,842
You did send him a check for $25,000,
didn't you?

1275
01:29:37,082 --> 01:29:38,042
Yes.

1276
01:29:40,442 --> 01:29:43,521
I sent him a check for $25,000.

1277
01:29:46,041 --> 01:29:47,481
What's that?

1278
01:29:48,641 --> 01:29:50,041
Declaration of Principles.

1279
01:29:50,121 --> 01:29:51,160
What?

1280
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:52,920
What is it?

1281
01:29:58,520 --> 01:29:59,480
An antique.

1282
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,159
You're awful funny, aren't you?

1283
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:07,359
I'll tell you one thing you're not going
to be funny about, and that's my singing.

1284
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:08,519
I'm through.

1285
01:30:08,599 --> 01:30:10,959
I never wanted to do it in the first place.

1286
01:30:11,478 --> 01:30:13,918
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.

1287
01:30:14,078 --> 01:30:16,718
I don't propose
to have myself made ridiculous.

1288
01:30:16,758 --> 01:30:19,918
You don't propose
to have yourself made ridiculous!

1289
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:23,197
What about me?
I'm the one that has to sing.

1290
01:30:23,277 --> 01:30:25,197
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.

1291
01:30:25,277 --> 01:30:27,037
Why don't you leave me alone?

1292
01:30:27,117 --> 01:30:28,717
My reasons satisfy me, Susan.

1293
01:30:28,797 --> 01:30:30,837
You seem unable to understand them.

1294
01:30:31,716 --> 01:30:33,876
I will not tell them to you again.

1295
01:30:37,396 --> 01:30:39,476
You'll continue with your singing.

1296
01:32:08,147 --> 01:32:09,907
Get Dr. Corey.

1297
01:32:14,106 --> 01:32:15,146
Susan.

1298
01:32:15,986 --> 01:32:19,466
She'll be perfectly all right
in a day or two, Mr. Kane.

1299
01:32:21,426 --> 01:32:25,305
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane
came to make such a foolish mistake.

1300
01:32:25,785 --> 01:32:30,185
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her
was in a somewhat larger bottle.

1301
01:32:30,505 --> 01:32:34,784
The strain of preparing for the new opera
has excited and confused her.

1302
01:32:34,864 --> 01:32:37,024
Yes, I'm sure that was it.

1303
01:32:37,824 --> 01:32:40,424
No objections to my staying
with her are there?

1304
01:32:40,584 --> 01:32:44,543
No, not at all.
I'd like the nurse to be here, too.

1305
01:32:45,303 --> 01:32:47,343
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1306
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:22,979
Charlie.

1307
01:33:25,579 --> 01:33:28,139
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.

1308
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:32,658
But I couldn't go through
with the singing again.

1309
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:37,578
You don't know what it means
to know that people....

1310
01:33:38,978 --> 01:33:41,698
That the whole audience doesn't want you.

1311
01:33:45,177 --> 01:33:47,177
That's when you got to fight them.

1312
01:33:55,256 --> 01:33:56,696
All right.

1313
01:33:58,616 --> 01:34:00,936
You won't have to fight them anymore.

1314
01:34:04,095 --> 01:34:06,135
It's their loss.

1315
01:34:21,094 --> 01:34:22,813
What are you doing?

1316
01:34:27,093 --> 01:34:29,013
Jigsaw puzzles?

1317
01:34:33,932 --> 01:34:35,852
Charlie, what time is it?

1318
01:34:36,372 --> 01:34:37,852
11:30.

1319
01:34:38,012 --> 01:34:39,372
In New York?

1320
01:34:42,171 --> 01:34:44,891
I said what time is it in New York?

1321
01:34:45,691 --> 01:34:48,651
- 11 :30.
- Night?

1322
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:53,890
<i>The Bulldog's just gone to press.</i>

1323
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:57,050
<i>Well, hurray for the Bulldog.</i>

1324
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:02,449
Gee, 11:30. Shows are just getting up.

1325
01:35:02,569 --> 01:35:05,169
People are going to nightclubs
and restaurants.

1326
01:35:05,849 --> 01:35:09,089
Of course, we're different
because we live in a palace.

1327
01:35:09,169 --> 01:35:11,689
You always said you wanted
to live in a palace.

1328
01:35:11,729 --> 01:35:14,008
A person could go crazy in this dump.

1329
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:17,888
Nobody to talk to,
nobody to have any fun with.

1330
01:35:18,608 --> 01:35:22,327
49,000 acres of nothing
but scenery and statues.

1331
01:35:22,527 --> 01:35:23,927
I'm lonesome.

1332
01:35:23,967 --> 01:35:27,807
Until yesterday, we've had no less
than 50 of your friends at any one time.

1333
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:30,487
I think if you look in the west wing...

1334
01:35:30,527 --> 01:35:33,526
...you'll probably find a dozen vacationists
still in residence.

1335
01:35:33,566 --> 01:35:36,046
You make a joke out of everything.

1336
01:35:36,566 --> 01:35:41,006
Charlie, I want to go to New York.
I'm tired of being a hostess.

1337
01:35:41,086 --> 01:35:44,765
I want to have fun. Please, Charlie.

1338
01:35:46,405 --> 01:35:49,125
Charlie, please.

1339
01:35:50,045 --> 01:35:52,564
Our home is here, Susan.

1340
01:35:58,084 --> 01:36:00,244
I don't care to visit New York.

1341
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:37,360
What are you doing?

1342
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,359
One thing I can never understand:

1343
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:45,519
How do you know
you haven't done it before?

1344
01:36:45,599 --> 01:36:49,439
It makes a whole lot more sense
than collecting statues.

1345
01:36:50,999 --> 01:36:52,518
You may be right.

1346
01:36:52,918 --> 01:36:54,918
I sometimes wonder...

1347
01:36:55,278 --> 01:36:57,598
...but you get into the habit.

1348
01:36:57,678 --> 01:37:00,438
It's not a habit, I do it because I like it.

1349
01:37:00,838 --> 01:37:03,317
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1350
01:37:05,597 --> 01:37:08,517
Invite everybody to spend the night
at the Everglades.

1351
01:37:08,757 --> 01:37:12,956
Invite everybody. Order everybody,
you mean, and make them sleep in tents.

1352
01:37:13,036 --> 01:37:15,916
Who wants to sleep in tents
when they've got their own room...

1353
01:37:15,956 --> 01:37:18,476
...with a bath, where they know
where everything is?

1354
01:37:18,556 --> 01:37:21,836
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1355
01:37:25,035 --> 01:37:29,195
You never give me anything
I really care about.

1356
01:37:37,394 --> 01:37:39,194
"It can't be love

1357
01:37:41,594 --> 01:37:46,033
"For there is no true love

1358
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:48,753
"l know I've played at the game

1359
01:37:48,873 --> 01:37:51,633
"Like a moth in a blue flame

1360
01:37:51,673 --> 01:37:55,352
"Lost in the end, just the same

1361
01:37:55,432 --> 01:37:57,832
"All these years

1362
01:37:57,992 --> 01:38:02,671
"My heart's been floating around
in a puddle of tears

1363
01:38:04,991 --> 01:38:06,871
"l wonder what it is"

1364
01:38:06,951 --> 01:38:10,831
Sure, you give me things,
but that don't mean anything to you.

1365
01:38:13,150 --> 01:38:16,110
You're in a tent, darling,
you're not at home.

1366
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:19,430
I can hear you very well
if you speak in a normal tone of voice.

1367
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:23,269
What's the difference between giving me
a bracelet or giving someone $100,000...

1368
01:38:23,309 --> 01:38:26,229
...for a statue you'll keep crated up
and never look at?

1369
01:38:26,349 --> 01:38:28,589
It's just money. It doesn't mean anything.

1370
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:31,749
You never really gave me anything
that you care about.

1371
01:38:31,869 --> 01:38:33,548
I want you to stop this.

1372
01:38:33,628 --> 01:38:34,988
I'm not going to stop it.

1373
01:38:35,068 --> 01:38:37,268
You never gave me anything in your life.

1374
01:38:37,388 --> 01:38:40,508
You just tried to buy me
into giving you something.

1375
01:38:43,147 --> 01:38:46,907
"It can't be love"

1376
01:38:59,226 --> 01:39:01,746
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.

1377
01:39:01,786 --> 01:39:03,665
You don't love me.

1378
01:39:03,785 --> 01:39:05,665
You want me to love you.

1379
01:39:05,705 --> 01:39:08,545
Sure. "I知 Charles Foster Kane.

1380
01:39:08,585 --> 01:39:11,105
"Whatever you want,
just name it and it's yours.

1381
01:39:11,185 --> 01:39:13,344
"But you gotta love me."

1382
01:39:17,624 --> 01:39:20,224
Don't tell me you're sorry.

1383
01:39:22,104 --> 01:39:23,823
I'm not sorry.

1384
01:39:35,142 --> 01:39:36,662
Mr. Kane?

1385
01:39:37,102 --> 01:39:39,702
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.

1386
01:39:42,462 --> 01:39:45,501
Marie has been packing for her
since morning.

1387
01:39:51,381 --> 01:39:54,900
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.
Tell him he can get the bags.

1388
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:56,620
Yes, madame.

1389
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:00,820
Have you gone completely crazy?

1390
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:04,019
Don't you know that our guests,
that everyone will know about this?

1391
01:40:04,099 --> 01:40:05,899
Packed your bag, sent for the car--

1392
01:40:05,939 --> 01:40:06,979
And left you?

1393
01:40:07,219 --> 01:40:09,099
Of course they'll hear.

1394
01:40:10,019 --> 01:40:12,579
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you.

1395
01:40:12,779 --> 01:40:15,498
But I never imagined
people wouldn't know.

1396
01:40:17,898 --> 01:40:19,658
I won't let you go.

1397
01:40:26,737 --> 01:40:28,257
Goodbye, Charlie.

1398
01:40:31,697 --> 01:40:33,056
Susan.

1399
01:40:42,816 --> 01:40:44,415
Please don't go.

1400
01:40:49,775 --> 01:40:51,495
Please, Susan.

1401
01:40:54,574 --> 01:40:57,894
From now on, everything will be
exactly the way you want it to be.

1402
01:40:57,974 --> 01:41:00,054
Not the way I think you want it, but...

1403
01:41:01,614 --> 01:41:03,053
...your way.

1404
01:41:09,293 --> 01:41:10,573
You mustn't go.

1405
01:41:13,692 --> 01:41:15,732
You can't do this to me.

1406
01:41:17,372 --> 01:41:18,972
I see.

1407
01:41:19,892 --> 01:41:22,292
It's you that this is being done to.

1408
01:41:22,612 --> 01:41:24,371
It's not me at all.

1409
01:41:24,571 --> 01:41:26,451
Not what it means to me.

1410
01:41:28,491 --> 01:41:30,571
I can't do this to you?

1411
01:41:32,011 --> 01:41:33,850
Oh, yes, I can.

1412
01:41:52,209 --> 01:41:55,248
In case you haven't heard,
I lost all my money and it was plenty.

1413
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:57,528
The last 10 years
have been difficult for many.

1414
01:41:57,608 --> 01:42:00,408
They haven't been tough on me.
I just lost all my money.

1415
01:42:01,008 --> 01:42:04,087
-You're going down to Xanadu?
-Monday, with boys from the office.

1416
01:42:04,127 --> 01:42:06,767
Mr. Rawlston wants
the whole place photographed.

1417
01:42:06,807 --> 01:42:08,407
We run a picture magazine.

1418
01:42:08,447 --> 01:42:12,007
If you're smart, you'll get in touch
with Raymond. He's the butler.

1419
01:42:12,087 --> 01:42:14,006
You'll learn a lot from him.

1420
01:42:14,086 --> 01:42:16,446
He knows where all the bodies are buried.

1421
01:42:16,606 --> 01:42:19,726
You know, all the same,
I feel kind of sorry for Mr. Kane.

1422
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:23,445
Don't you think I do?

1423
01:42:27,845 --> 01:42:30,725
What do you know, it's morning already.

1424
01:42:34,044 --> 01:42:37,484
Come around and tell me the story
of your life sometime.

1425
01:42:44,203 --> 01:42:45,723
Rosebud?

1426
01:42:48,283 --> 01:42:50,283
I'll tell you about Rosebud.

1427
01:42:50,723 --> 01:42:52,603
How much is it worth to you?

1428
01:42:53,123 --> 01:42:54,882
$1,000?

1429
01:43:03,801 --> 01:43:06,361
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.

1430
01:43:07,081 --> 01:43:10,361
-He acted funny sometimes, you know?
-No, I didn't.

1431
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:12,881
Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.

1432
01:43:13,201 --> 01:43:15,520
I've been working for him 11 years now...

1433
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:19,280
...in charge of the whole place,
so I ought to know.

1434
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:20,840
-Rosebud.
-Yes.

1435
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:25,719
Like I tell you, the old man
acted kind of funny sometimes...

1436
01:43:25,799 --> 01:43:29,359
-...but I knew how to handle him--
-Need a lot of service?

1437
01:43:29,399 --> 01:43:32,359
But I knew how to handle him.

1438
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:34,078
Like that time his wife left.

1439
01:45:44,265 --> 01:45:45,425
Rosebud.

1440
01:46:50,699 --> 01:46:52,219
I see.

1441
01:46:52,859 --> 01:46:55,178
And that's what you know about Rosebud?

1442
01:46:56,698 --> 01:46:58,978
I heard him say it that other time, too.

1443
01:46:59,578 --> 01:47:01,458
He just said:

1444
01:47:01,778 --> 01:47:03,578
"Rosebud."

1445
01:47:03,618 --> 01:47:06,777
Then he dropped the glass ball
and it broke on the floor.

1446
01:47:07,417 --> 01:47:11,497
He didn't say anything after that,
and I knew he was dead.

1447
01:47:12,217 --> 01:47:14,816
He said all kinds of things
that didn't mean anything.

1448
01:47:14,896 --> 01:47:16,816
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1449
01:47:17,856 --> 01:47:20,416
-Yes and no.
-That isn't worth $1,000.

1450
01:47:20,496 --> 01:47:23,376
You can keep on asking questions
if you want to.

1451
01:47:23,616 --> 01:47:25,175
We're leaving tonight...

1452
01:47:25,975 --> 01:47:27,855
...when we're through taking pictures.

1453
01:47:27,935 --> 01:47:29,815
Allow yourself plenty of time.

1454
01:47:29,855 --> 01:47:33,575
The train stops at the junction on signal,
but they don't like to wait.

1455
01:47:34,574 --> 01:47:37,374
I can remember when they'd wait all day...

1456
01:47:37,734 --> 01:47:39,334
...if Mr. Kane said so.

1457
01:47:40,734 --> 01:47:43,214
Better get going.

1458
01:47:46,053 --> 01:47:49,853
-Can we come down?
-Yes, hurry up. We're leaving.

1459
01:47:51,973 --> 01:47:55,292
How much do you think
this is all worth, Mr. Thompson?

1460
01:47:55,492 --> 01:47:56,972
Millions.

1461
01:47:58,332 --> 01:47:59,532
If anybody wants it.

1462
01:47:59,612 --> 01:48:02,172
Well, at least he brought all this stuff
to America.

1463
01:48:02,252 --> 01:48:03,892
-What's that?
-Another Venus.

1464
01:48:04,012 --> 01:48:05,291
$25,000.

1465
01:48:05,371 --> 01:48:07,851
A lot of money to pay
for a dame without a head.

1466
01:48:07,931 --> 01:48:10,011
The banks are out of luck?

1467
01:48:11,411 --> 01:48:14,091
-They'll clear all right.
-He never threw anything away.

1468
01:48:14,171 --> 01:48:19,130
<i>"Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467
employees of the New York Inquirer."</i>

1469
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:24,369
"One stove from the estate of Mary Kane,
Little Salem, Colorado. Value: $2."

1470
01:48:24,409 --> 01:48:26,809
We're supposed to get everything,
junk as well as art.

1471
01:48:26,849 --> 01:48:28,529
He sure liked to collect things.

1472
01:48:28,569 --> 01:48:29,929
Anything and everything.

1473
01:48:30,009 --> 01:48:31,649
A regular crow, eh?

1474
01:48:31,729 --> 01:48:34,328
-Hey, look, a jigsaw puzzle.
-We got a lot of those.

1475
01:48:34,408 --> 01:48:37,328
A Burmese temple and three
Spanish ceilings down the hall.

1476
01:48:37,808 --> 01:48:39,168
Part of a Scotch castle...

1477
01:48:39,288 --> 01:48:41,008
...that needs to be unwrapped.

1478
01:48:41,328 --> 01:48:42,768
Put all this stuff together:

1479
01:48:42,848 --> 01:48:45,807
The palaces and the paintings,
and the toys and everything.

1480
01:48:45,927 --> 01:48:47,847
What would it spell?

1481
01:48:49,167 --> 01:48:51,887
-Charles Foster Kane?
-Or Rosebud.

1482
01:48:52,127 --> 01:48:55,246
-How about it, Jerry?
-What's Rosebud?

1483
01:48:55,326 --> 01:48:57,486
That's what he said when he died.

1484
01:48:58,126 --> 01:49:00,166
Did you ever find out what it means?

1485
01:49:00,246 --> 01:49:02,366
-No, I didn't.
-What did you find out about him?

1486
01:49:02,486 --> 01:49:03,886
Not much, really.

1487
01:49:06,845 --> 01:49:08,525
We'd better get started.

1488
01:49:10,365 --> 01:49:12,685
What have you been doing all this time?

1489
01:49:13,685 --> 01:49:15,244
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle.

1490
01:49:15,284 --> 01:49:18,884
If you'd discovered what Rosebud meant,
I bet it would've explained everything.

1491
01:49:18,924 --> 01:49:20,484
No, I don't think so.

1492
01:49:21,044 --> 01:49:22,444
No.

1493
01:49:22,564 --> 01:49:25,963
He was a man who got
everything he wanted, and then lost it.

1494
01:49:26,083 --> 01:49:29,643
Maybe Rosebud was something
he couldn't get or something he lost.

1495
01:49:29,683 --> 01:49:31,883
It wouldn't have explained anything.

1496
01:49:32,723 --> 01:49:35,722
I don't think any word
can explain a man's life.

1497
01:49:36,602 --> 01:49:40,682
No. I guess Rosebud is just a piece
in a jigsaw puzzle.

1498
01:49:41,802 --> 01:49:43,442
A missing piece.

1499
01:49:49,041 --> 01:49:51,121
Come on, everybody...

1500
01:49:52,881 --> 01:49:55,040
...we'll miss the train.

1501
01:50:57,074 --> 01:50:59,234
Throw that junk in.

1502
01:52:28,365 --> 01:52:32,205
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

1503
01:52:32,805 --> 01:52:34,725
Everything was his idea...

1504
01:52:36,644 --> 01:52:38,524
...except my leaving him.

1505
01:52:39,404 --> 01:52:41,324
I've got his trunk all packed.

1506
01:52:42,564 --> 01:52:44,644
I've had it packed for a week now.

1507
01:52:44,884 --> 01:52:48,203
Sometimes I think I'd prefer
arrival of flesh and blood.

1508
01:52:49,883 --> 01:52:52,243
You're gonna need more than one lesson.

1509
01:52:53,363 --> 01:52:55,722
And you'll get more than one lesson.

1510
01:53:00,842 --> 01:53:02,242
Who's a busy man, me?
