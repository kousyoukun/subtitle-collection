1
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,002
Rosebud.

2
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:13,969
News on the March.

3
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,565
Legendary was the Xanadu...

4
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:39,236
...where Kubla Khan decreed
his stately pleasure dome.

5
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:42,806
Today almost as legendary
as Florida's Xanadu...

6
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:46,816
...the world's largest
private pleasure ground.

7
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,281
Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast.
A private mountain...

8
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,350
...was commissioned
and successfully built.

9
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,987
One hundred thousand trees.
Twenty thousand tons of marble...

10
00:03:57,087 --> 00:04:00,657
...are the ingredients of Xanadu's mountain.

11
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:03,191
Contents of Xanadu's palace:

12
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:07,697
Paintings. Pictures. Statues.
Various stones of other palaces.

13
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,666
A collection of everything.

14
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:13,003
So big it can never
be catalogued or appraised.

15
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:16,937
Enough for 10 museums.
The loot of the world.

16
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:22,543
Xanadu's livestock...

17
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,286
...the fowl of the air. The fish of the sea.
The beast of the field and jungle...

18
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:33,652
...two of each.
The biggest private zoo since Noah.

19
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:36,324
Like the Pharaohs...

20
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:41,171
...Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones
to mark his grave.

21
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:43,500
Since the Pyramids...

22
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,269
...Xanadu is the costliest monument...

23
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,919
...a man has built to himself.

24
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:04,513
Here in Xanadu last week...

25
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:07,958
...Xanadu's landlord was laid to rest.

26
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,863
A potent figure of our century...

27
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,055
...America's Kubla Khan:

28
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,563
Charles Foster Kane.

29
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:47,864
Its humble beginnings.
In this ramshackle building. A dying daily.

30
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:50,592
Kane's empire. In its glory...

31
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,838
...held dominion over 37 newspapers.
Two syndicates...

32
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:59,500
...a radio network.
An empire upon an empire.

33
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:03,711
The first of grocery stores. Paper mills...

34
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:09,513
...apartment buildings.
Factories. Forests. Ocean liners.

35
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:12,919
An empire through which for 50 years...

36
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,625
...flowed in an unending stream...

37
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:20,145
...the wealth of the Earth's
third richest gold mine.

38
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,500
Famed in American legend
is the origin of the Kane fortune.

39
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,172
How. To boarding housekeeper Mary Kane.
By a defaulting boarder. In 1868...

40
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:33,109
...was left the supposedly worthless deed
to an abandoned mineshaft:

41
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:36,337
The Colorado Lode.

42
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:40,550
Fifty-seven years later.
Before a congressional investigation...

43
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,054
...Walter P. Thatcher.
Grand old man of Wall Street...

44
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,857
...for years chief target
of Kane papers' attacks on trusts...

45
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,360
...recalls a journey he made as a youth.

46
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,830
My firm had been appointed trustee
by Mrs. Kane...

47
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,266
...for a large fortune she recently acquired.

48
00:06:56,366 --> 00:07:00,437
It was her wish that I take charge
of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.

49
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:05,275
Chief, is it not, that on this occasion,
Charles Foster Kane...

50
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:10,647
...personally attacked you after striking you
in the stomach with a sled?

51
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:13,650
I shall read to the committee
a prepared statement...

52
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,530
...which I have brought with me,
and then refuse to answer questions.

53
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,992
Mr. Charles Foster Kane,
in every essence of his social beliefs...

54
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:26,062
...and by the dangerous manner
he has persistently attacked...

55
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:28,431
...American traditions of private property...

56
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,834
...initiative and opportunity
for advancement...

57
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:34,838
...is, in fact, nothing more or less
than a communist.

58
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:37,440
That same month in Union Square...

59
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,176
The words 'Charles Foster Kane'...

60
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:43,980
...are a menace
to every workingman in this land.

61
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,605
He is today what he has always been
and always will be: A fascist.

62
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,266
And still another opinion...

63
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:12,442
Kane urged his country's entry
into one war...

64
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:15,311
...opposed participation in another.

65
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,315
Won the election
to one American president at least.

66
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,135
Spoke for millions of Americans.

67
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:25,614
Was hated by as many more.

68
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,517
For 40 years appeared in Kane newsprint...

69
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,264
...no public issue
on which Kane papers took no stand.

70
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:39,833
No public man whom Kane himself
did not support or denounce.

71
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:43,929
Often support. Then denounce.

72
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:55,684
Twice married. Twice divorced.

73
00:08:55,985 --> 00:08:58,288
First to a president's niece...

74
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:01,618
...Emily Norton. Who left him in 1916.

75
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:05,765
Died 1918 in a motor accident
with their son.

76
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:10,400
Sixteen years after his first marriage...

77
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,902
...two weeks after his first divorce...

78
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:15,138
...Kane married Susan Alexander...

79
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:19,209
...singer. At the Town Hall
in Trenton. New Jersey.

80
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:24,611
For wife two.
One-time opera-singing Susan Alexander...

81
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:28,051
...Kane built
Chicago's Municipal Opera House.

82
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,551
Cost: $3 million.

83
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:36,759
Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane.
Half-finished before she divorced him...

84
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,962
...the still unfinished...

85
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,463
...Xanadu.

86
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:43,760
Cost: No man can say.

87
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,506
Kane. Molder of mass opinion
though he was...

88
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,209
...in all his life
was never granted elective office...

89
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:54,978
...by the voters of his country.

90
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:57,880
But Kane papers were once strong indeed...

91
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,683
...and once the prize seemed almost his.

92
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:04,187
In 1916. as independent candidate
for governor...

93
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,689
...the best elements of the state
behind him...

94
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:11,661
...the White House seemingly the next
easy step in a lightning political career...

95
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:16,065
...then suddenly. Less than one week
before election...

96
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:17,634
...defeat.

97
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:19,895
Shameful. Ignominious.

98
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:24,107
Defeat that set back for 20 years
the cause of reform in the U. S...

99
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:29,477
...forever cancelled political chances
for Charles Foster Kane.

100
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,651
Then. In the first year
of the Great Depression...

101
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,878
...a Kane paper closes.

102
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,750
For Kane. In four short years. Collapse.

103
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:46,323
Eleven Kane papers merged.
More sold. Scrapped.

104
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:57,040
Is that correct?

105
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,475
Don't believe everything you hear
on the radio.

106
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:03,479
Read the Inquirer.
- How were business conditions in Europe?

107
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,550
How did I find business conditions
in Europe, Mr. Bones?

108
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,650
With great difficulty.

109
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:13,523
Are you glad to be back?

110
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:16,926
I'm always glad to be back.
I'm an American.

111
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:19,562
Always been an American. Anything else?

112
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:22,699
When I was a reporter,
we asked them quicker than that.

113
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,301
What do you think
of the chances for war in Europe?

114
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:29,772
I talked with the responsible leaders
of England, France, Germany and Italy.

115
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:32,275
They're too intelligent
to embark on a project...

116
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,944
...that would mean the end of civilization.

117
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:39,209
You can take my word for it,
there will be no war.

118
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,655
Kane helped to change the world...

119
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:48,358
...but Kane's world now is history...

120
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,861
...and the great yellow journalist himself
lived to be history...

121
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,766
...outlived his power to make it.

122
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:59,335
Alone in his never-finished.
Already decaying pleasure palace...

123
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:03,039
...aloof. Seldom visited.
Never photographed...

124
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,677
...an emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing empire.

125
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:10,813
Vainly attempted to sway. As he once did...

126
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:14,283
...the destinies of a nation
that had ceased to listen to him...

127
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:16,383
...ceased to trust him.

128
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:22,215
Then last week. As it must to all men...

129
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,304
...death came to Charles Foster Kane.

130
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:28,729
News on the March.

131
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:35,605
That's it.

132
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:38,608
Stand by.
I'll tell you if we want to run it again.

133
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,310
How about it, Mr. Rawlston?
- How do you like it, boys?

134
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,281
Seventy years in a man's life.
- That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.

135
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,817
It's a good short,
but what it needs is an angle.

136
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:51,187
All we saw on that screen
was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.

137
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,356
I know that. I read the papers.

138
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:56,159
It isn't enough to tell us what a man did...

139
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:59,422
...you've got to tell us who he was.

140
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:02,765
Wait a minute.
What were Kane's last words?

141
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,865
Do you remember, boys?

142
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:07,336
What were the last words he said on Earth?

143
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:09,539
Maybe he told us about himself
on his deathbed.

144
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,675
Maybe he didn't.
- All we saw was a big American.

145
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:16,179
How did he differ from Ford,
Hearst or John Doe?

146
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,548
I tell you, a man's dying words...

147
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,550
What were they?
You don't read the papers.

148
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,119
When Charles Foster Kane died,
he said one word:

149
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,187
'Rosebud.'

150
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:26,022
That's all he said? Tough guy.

151
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:28,691
Yes, 'Rosebud.' Just that one word.

152
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,426
But who is she?
- What was it?

153
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:32,695
Here's a man
who could've been president...

154
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,031
...who was as loved,
hated and talked about...

155
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:37,667
...as any man in our time,
but when he dies...

156
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:40,002
...something is on his mind called Rosebud.

157
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:42,572
What does that mean?
- A racehorse he bet on once.

158
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:44,974
That didn't come in.
- But what was the race?

159
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,209
Rosebud.

160
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:47,109
Thompson.
- Yes.

161
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,111
Hold this up a week, two if you must.

162
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:50,980
Don't you think right after he's dead...

163
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,183
Find out about Rosebud. Get in touch
with anybody who knew him...

164
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:56,018
...or knew him well.

165
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:57,720
That manager of his...

166
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,289
Bernstein. His second wife.
She's still living.

167
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:01,657
Susan Alexander Kane.

168
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,594
She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.
- That's right.

169
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:08,064
See them all. Get in touch with everybody
that ever worked for him...

170
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:11,300
...whoever loved him,
whoever hated his guts.

171
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,370
I don't mean go through
the city directory of course.

172
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,038
I'll get on it right away.

173
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,868
Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.

174
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:24,044
It will probably turn out to be
a very simple thing.

175
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:03,751
Miss Alexander.

176
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:06,756
This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.

177
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:09,154
I want another drink, John.

178
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:14,997
Right away.
Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?

179
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:20,452
I'll have a highball, please.
- Who told you you could sit down?

180
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,405
I thought maybe we could have a talk.

181
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,505
Think again.

182
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:27,543
Can't you people leave me alone?

183
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:29,845
I'm minding my own business,
you mind yours.

184
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,848
If I could just have a talk with you,
Miss Alexander. I'd...

185
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:34,948
Get out of here.

186
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:38,285
Get out.

187
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,590
Sorry.
- Get out.

188
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,410
Maybe some other time.
- Get out.

189
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,170
Gino.

190
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,331
Get her another highball.

191
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:01,978
She just won't talk to nobody,
Mr. Thompson.

192
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:04,078
Okay.

193
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,977
Another double?
- Yeah.

194
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:10,653
Hello, I want New York City.

195
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:15,428
Courtland 79970.
This is Atlantic City 46827. All right.

196
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:20,427
She's...

197
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:22,365
She'll snap out of it.

198
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:25,735
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon
talk about Mr. Kane as any...

199
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:27,269
Hello.
- Sooner.

200
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:31,024
This is Thompson. Let me talk to the chief.

201
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,909
Mr. Rawlston? She won't talk.

202
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:36,846
The second Mrs. Kane.
About Rosebud or anything else.

203
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,681
I'm calling from Atlantic City.

204
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:42,385
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia,
to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.

205
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:43,819
They're expecting me.

206
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,456
Then I've a meeting with his
general manager in New York. Bernstein.

207
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:48,991
Then I'm coming back here.

208
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:53,511
Yeah, I'll see everybody that's still alive.
Goodbye.

209
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:54,997
Hey...
- John.

210
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,899
You just might be able to help me.

211
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:01,170
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane,
did she ever mention Rosebud?

212
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,872
'Rosebud'?

213
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:05,408
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.

214
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:10,880
As a matter of fact, just the other day,
when the papers were full of it...

215
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,107
...I asked her.

216
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,944
She never heard of Rosebud.

217
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:32,601
The directors of the Thatcher Memorial
Library have asked me to remind you...

218
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:35,337
...about the conditions
under which you may...

219
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:38,574
...inspect certain portions
of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.

220
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:41,277
I remember them.
- Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.

221
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:43,913
All I want is an hour...
- Under no circumstances...

222
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:47,717
...are direct quotes from his manuscript
to be used by you. You may follow me.

223
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,302
That's all right. I'm just looking for...

224
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:04,798
Jennings.

225
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:11,438
Thank you, Jennings.

226
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:15,010
You will be required to leave this room
at 4:30 promptly.

227
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,646
You will confine yourself,
it is our understanding...

228
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:21,217
...to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's
manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.

229
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,782
That's all I'm interested in.

230
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,119
Thank you.

231
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,758
Pages 83 to 142.

232
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:10,032
Come on, boys.

233
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:11,534
Be careful, Charles.

234
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:12,434
Mrs. Kane.

235
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,670
Pull your muffler around your neck,
Charles.

236
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,039
Mrs. Kane,
I think we'll have to tell him now.

237
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:20,964
Yes, I'll sign those papers now,
Mr. Thatcher.

238
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:24,079
You people seem to forget
that I'm the boy's father.

239
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,082
It's going to be done
exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.

240
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:30,886
There's nothing wrong with Colorado.
I don't see why we can't raise our son...

241
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:32,721
...just 'cause we came into money.

242
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:35,758
If I want to, I can go to court.
A father has a right to.

243
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:39,161
A boarder that beats his bill
and leaves worthless stock behind...

244
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,164
That property is as much my property
as anybody's...

245
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,167
...now that it's valuable.
And if Fred Graves had any idea...

246
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,804
...this would happen, he'd have made out
the certificates in both our names.

247
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:52,374
But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.
- He owed the money to both of us.

248
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:54,655
'The bank's decision in all matters...'

249
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:57,279
I don't hold with giving Charles to a bank...

250
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:59,615
Stop this nonsense.
- We're a bit uneducated...

251
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,784
'The bank's decision
concerning his education...

252
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:04,386
'... his places of residence, is to be final.'

253
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:08,023
The idea of a bank being the guardian...
- Stop this nonsense, Jim.

254
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,993
'We will assume full management
of the Colorado Lode'...

255
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:13,696
...which I repeat, Mrs. Kane,
you are the sole owner.

256
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,965
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
- Right here.

257
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:18,968
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.

258
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:21,704
You'd think I hadn't been
a good husband or father...

259
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,372
The sum of $50,000 a year...

260
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,642
...is to be paid to you
and Mr. Kane as long as you both live...

261
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:29,378
...and thereafter to the survivor.

262
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,963
Let's hope it's all for the best.
- It is.

263
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,789
Why I can't raise my own boy
is more than I can understand.

264
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,758
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

265
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:45,995
Everything else, the principal,
as well as all monies earned...

266
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:50,132
...is to be administered by the bank in trust
for your son, Charles Foster Kane...

267
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:52,968
...until he reaches his 25th birthday,
at which time...

268
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:55,304
...he is to come into complete possession.

269
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:57,404
Charles.

270
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:00,774
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

271
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,848
It's almost 5:00.
Don't you think I'd better meet the boy?

272
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:08,498
I've got his trunk all packed.

273
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:11,974
I've had it packed for a week now.

274
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:16,258
I've arranged for a tutor
to meet us in Chicago.

275
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,328
I'd have brought him here with me, but...

276
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:21,230
Charles.
- Look, Mom.

277
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,698
You'd better come inside.

278
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,734
That's quite a snowman.
- I took the pipe out of his mouth.

279
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:27,369
Did you make it yourself?

280
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:30,239
Maybe I'll make some teeth and whiskers.

281
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:32,675
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

282
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:34,810
Hello.
- How do you do, Charles?

283
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,478
He comes from the East.

284
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:38,047
Pa.
- Hello, Charlie.

285
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:40,147
Charles.

286
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:42,149
Yes, Mommy.

287
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,121
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you
on a trip with him tonight.

288
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,890
You'll be leaving on number 10.

289
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,192
That's the train with all the lights on it.

290
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,293
You going, Mom?

291
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,230
No. Your mother won't be going
right away, but she'll...

292
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,032
Where am I going?

293
00:21:57,132 --> 00:22:00,869
You're going to see Chicago and New York
and Washington, maybe. Ain't he?

294
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:02,137
He certainly is.

295
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,607
I wish I were a boy going on a trip
like that for the first time.

296
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:08,911
Why aren't you coming with us, Mom?
- We have to stay here, Charles.

297
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,880
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher
from now on, Charlie.

298
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,584
You're gonna be rich. Your ma figures,
well, that is...

299
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:18,787
...me and her decided this ain't the place
for you to grow up in.

300
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:21,290
You'll probably be
the richest man someday...

301
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,826
...and you ought to get...
- You won't be lonely.

302
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:27,396
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have
fine times together, we are.

303
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:30,566
Let's shake hands. Come.
I'm not that frightening, am I?

304
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,968
What do you say? Let's shake.
- Why, Charles.

305
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:34,837
Why, you almost hurt me.
- Charlie.

306
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,439
Sleds aren't to hit people,
but to sleigh with.

307
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:38,607
Mom.

308
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:40,868
You got to go.
- Jim.

309
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,012
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.

310
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,913
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.

311
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:46,849
That's what you think, is it?
- Yes.

312
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:52,474
That's why he's going to be brought up
where you can't get at him.

313
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:13,338
Well, Charles...

314
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,980
...Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

315
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,548
And a happy New Year.

316
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:21,884
In closing...

317
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:25,788
...may I remind you your 25th birthday,
which is now approaching...

318
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:28,624
...marks your complete independence
from the firm...

319
00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:32,261
...of Thatcher & Company,
as well as acquiring the full responsibility...

320
00:23:32,361 --> 00:23:34,730
...for the world's sixth largest
private fortune.

321
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,966
Got that?
- 'The world's sixth largest private fortune.'

322
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:42,171
I don't think you realize the full importance
of the position you are to occupy.

323
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:44,473
I am therefore enclosing
for your consideration...

324
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:47,276
...a list of your holdings,
extensively cross-indexed.

325
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:49,545
'Dear Mr. Thatcher.'
- It's from Mr. Kane.

326
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:51,980
Go on.
- 'Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...

327
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,249
'... oil wells, shipping or real estate.'

328
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,476
Not interested?

329
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:59,988
'One item on your list intrigues me:
The New York Inquirer.

330
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:02,958
'A little newspaper we acquired
in a foreclosure proceeding.

331
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:05,461
'Don't sell it.
I am coming back to take charge.

332
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:07,963
'I think it would be fun to run a newspaper.

333
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:12,193
'I think it would be fun to run a newspaper.'

334
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:22,169
'Traction Trust exposed.'

335
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:24,880
'Traction Trust bleeds public white.'

336
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,347
'Traction Trust smashed by Inquirer.'

337
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:31,853
'Landlords refuse to clear slums.'

338
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:35,884
'Inquirer wins slum fight.'

339
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:41,162
'Wall Street backs copper swindle.'

340
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,440
'Copper robbers indicted.'

341
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:46,368
'Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast.'

342
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:49,037
Is that really your idea
of how to run a newspaper?

343
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:52,541
I don't know how to run a newspaper.
I try everything I can think of.

344
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:55,577
You know there's not
the slightest proof this...

345
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:58,580
...Armada's off the Jersey Coast.
- Hello, Mr. Bernstein.

346
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,082
Can you prove it isn't?

347
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:03,619
Mr. Bernstein,
I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.

348
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:04,820
Mr. Leland.
- Hello.

349
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,622
Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.

350
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:11,894
We have no secrets from our readers.
Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.

351
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:15,797
He knows what's wrong with every copy
of the Inquirer since I took over. Read.

352
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:18,934
'Girls delightful in Cuba. Stop.
Could send you prose poems...

353
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:22,804
'... about scenery but don't feel right
spending your money. Stop.

354
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:25,707
'There is no war in Cuba.'
Signed 'Wheeler.' Any answer?

355
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:30,379
Yes. Dear Wheeler: You provide
the prose poems, I'll provide the war.

356
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:33,148
That's fine.
- I like it myself. Send it right away.

357
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:35,617
I came to see you
about this campaign of yours.

358
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:38,554
The Inquirer's campaign against
the Public Transit Company.

359
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:40,822
Do you know anything
we can use against them?

360
00:25:40,922 --> 00:25:42,524
You're still the college boy, eh?

361
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:47,329
I was expelled from college, a lot
of colleges, you remember? I remember.

362
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:50,165
I think I should remind you of a fact
you have forgotten.

363
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:54,102
You're one of the largest stockholders
in the Public Transit Company.

364
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:57,272
The trouble is, you don't realize
you're talking to two people.

365
00:25:57,372 --> 00:26:00,509
As Charles Foster Kane
who owns 82,364 shares...

366
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:04,379
...of Public Transit Preferred. See,
I do have a general idea of my holdings.

367
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,115
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel...

368
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:10,352
...his paper should be closed,
a committee formed to boycott him.

369
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:14,189
If you can form such a committee,
put me down for a contribution of $1,000.

370
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:17,125
On the other hand,
I am the publisher of the Inquirer.

371
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:21,430
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in
on a little secret. It is also my pleasure...

372
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,667
...to see that the working people of this
community aren't robbed by a pack...

373
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:28,670
...of money-mad pirates, just because...

374
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,241
...they have no one
to look after their interests.

375
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,344
I'll let you in on another little secret,
Mr. Thatcher:

376
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:39,248
I think I'm the man to do it.
You see, I have money and property.

377
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:43,352
If I don't look after the interests
of the underprivileged, somebody else will.

378
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:45,487
Maybe somebody
without money or property.

379
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:46,855
That would be too bad.

380
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:49,057
I saw your financial statement today.

381
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:52,126
Oh, did you?
- Tell me, honestly...

382
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:56,598
...don't you think it's rather unwise
to continue this philanthropic enterprise...

383
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,701
...this Inquirer, that is costing you
$1 million a year?

384
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:04,640
Yes. I did lose $1 million last year.
I expect to lose $1 million this year.

385
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,409
I expect to lose $1 million next year.

386
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:09,678
At the rate of $1 million a year...

387
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:13,603
...I'll have to close this place in 60 years.

388
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:25,560
'With respect to the said newspapers...

389
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,096
'... the said Charles Foster Kane...

390
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:32,191
'... hereby relinquishes all control thereof...

391
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,936
'... and of the syndicates
pertaining thereto...

392
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:41,510
'... and any and all other newspaper, press
and publishing properties of any kind...

393
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,912
'... and agrees to abandon
all claim thereto...'

394
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:47,382
Which means we're bust all right.
- Well, out of cash.

395
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:48,984
All right, Mr. Bernstein.

396
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:53,622
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher,
just let me sign it and go home.

397
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:57,092
You're too old
to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

398
00:27:57,192 --> 00:28:00,162
You're too old to be called anything else.

399
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,457
You were always too old.

400
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,768
'In consideration thereof,
Thatcher & Company agrees...

401
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:09,671
'... to pay to Charles Foster Kane,
as long as he lives...'

402
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,406
My allowance.

403
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:15,344
'You will continue to maintain
over your newspapers a large...

404
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:20,177
'... measure of control.
Measure of control.'

405
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:23,912
And we shall seek your advice.

406
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:30,355
This depression is temporary.

407
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:35,530
There's always the chance
that you'll die richer than I will.

408
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,033
It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.

409
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,602
We never lost as much as we made.

410
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:45,196
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles...

411
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:50,798
...you never made a single investment.
You always used money to...

412
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:53,238
To buy things.

413
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:58,783
To buy things.

414
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:04,056
My mother should have chosen
a less reliable banker.

415
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:14,265
I always gagged on that silver spoon.

416
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,238
You know, Mr. Bernstein...

417
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:22,671
...if I hadn't been very rich...

418
00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:25,547
...I might have been a really great man.

419
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:27,808
Don't you think you are?

420
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:33,983
I think I did pretty well
under the circumstances.

421
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,661
What would you like to have been?

422
00:29:40,061 --> 00:29:42,393
Everything you hate.

423
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:54,042
I beg your pardon, sir? What did you say?

424
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:57,942
It's 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings?
- Yes, ma'am.

425
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,649
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege,
young man.

426
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:04,489
Did you find what you were looking for?
- No.

427
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,223
You're not Rosebud, are you?
- What?

428
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:11,359
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings,
isn't it?

429
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:15,896
Goodbye, everybody.
Thanks for the use of the hall.

430
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:20,168
Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.

431
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:22,671
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know?

432
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:26,975
We thought maybe... If we could
find out what he meant by his last words...

433
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,611
...as he was dying.
- That 'Rosebud'?

434
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:32,179
Maybe some girl?

435
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,449
There were a lot of them in the early days.

436
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:37,752
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane
could have met someone casually...

437
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:40,088
...and then 50 years later, on his deathbed...

438
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:44,989
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.

439
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:48,797
A fellow will remember a lot of things
you wouldn't think he'd remember.

440
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:50,632
You take me.

441
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:55,871
One day, back in 1896,
I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry...

442
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:59,140
...and as we pulled out,
there was another ferry pulling in...

443
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,744
...and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off.

444
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:04,646
A white dress she had on.

445
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,415
She was carrying a white parasol.

446
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:10,065
I only saw her for one second.

447
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:15,950
She didn't see me at all,
but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since...

448
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:19,394
...that I haven't thought of that girl.

449
00:31:19,494 --> 00:31:23,698
Who else have you been to see?
- Well, I went down to Atlantic City.

450
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,798
Susie?

451
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:27,669
Thank you.

452
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:30,839
I called her myself the day after he died.

453
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:33,829
I thought maybe somebody ought to.

454
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:38,914
She couldn't even come to the phone.
- I'll be seeing her again in a couple of days.

455
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:41,149
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.

456
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:44,853
If you'd talk about anything connected
with Mr. Kane that you can remember.

457
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:46,855
You were with him from the beginning.

458
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:52,650
From before the beginning, young fellow.
And now it's after the end.

459
00:31:53,395 --> 00:31:55,730
Have you tried to see anybody
except Susie?

460
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:00,135
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've
been through Walter Thatcher's journal.

461
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:04,706
That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
- He made an awful lot of money.

462
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:08,009
Well, it's no trick to make a lot of money...

463
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:13,342
...if all you want is to make a lot of money.

464
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:21,253
You take Mr. Kane.
It wasn't money he wanted.

465
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:27,762
Thatcher never did figure him out.
Sometimes even I couldn't.

466
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,347
You know who you ought to see?
Mr. Leland.

467
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:34,502
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend.
They went to school together.

468
00:32:34,602 --> 00:32:35,770
Harvard?

469
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,541
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Cornell, Switzerland.

470
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:42,410
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.

471
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,138
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.

472
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:48,450
One of those families
where the father is worth $10 million...

473
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:54,422
...then one day he shoots himself,
and it turns out there's nothing but debts.

474
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:57,072
He was with Mr. Kane and me...

475
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,839
...the first day Mr. Kane took over
the Inquirer.

476
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:11,006
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.

477
00:33:11,106 --> 00:33:16,291
It's going to look a lot different
one of these days. Come on.

478
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:27,022
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint.
That's a newspaper building.

479
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:31,923
You're getting paid, mister,
for opinions or for hauling?

480
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:37,630
Jedediah.
- After you, Mr. Kane.

481
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:52,074
Excuse me, sir, but I...

482
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:57,382
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

483
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:02,190
Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.

484
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,559
I am Herbert Carter, the editor-in-chief.

485
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:08,530
Thank you, Mr. Carter. This is Mr. Leland...
- How do you do, Mr. Leland?

486
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,533
Our new dramatic critic.
I hope I haven't made a mistake.

487
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,835
It is dramatic critic, right?
- That's right.

488
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:17,760
Are they standing for me?
- You? Oh, Mr. Kane.

489
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:18,873
Standing?

490
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,575
How do you do?
- How do you do?

491
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:23,011
I thought it would be a nice little gesture.

492
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:26,681
Ask them to sit down, will you, please.
- The new publisher.

493
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:30,652
You may resume your duties, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

494
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:34,322
I didn't know your plans.
- I don't know my plans myself.

495
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:36,691
Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans.
- No?

496
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:39,817
Except to get out a newspaper.

497
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:46,434
Mr. Bernstein.
- Yes, Mr. Kane.

498
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:48,903
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.

499
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:53,975
Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
- How do you do, Mr. Carter?

500
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:56,370
Mr. Carter.
- How do you do?

501
00:34:56,978 --> 00:34:59,310
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
- Stein.

502
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,043
Kane.
- Mr. Carter, is this your office?

503
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:07,281
My little private sanctum
is at your disposal.

504
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:11,010
Excuse me.
- But I don't think I understand.

505
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:16,164
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here
in your office as long as I have to.

506
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:18,264
Live here? Yes?

507
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:21,269
Excuse me.
- But a morning newspaper, after all...

508
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,170
Excuse me.

509
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,138
We're practically closed for 12 hours a day.

510
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:29,544
That's one of the things
that's going to have to be changed here.

511
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:33,205
The news goes on for 24 hours a day.
- 24?

512
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:36,681
That's right.
- Excuse me.

513
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,419
It's impossible...

514
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:43,547
I've drawn that cartoon.
I'm no good as a cartoonist.

515
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:45,193
You certainly aren't.

516
00:35:45,293 --> 00:35:47,095
You're the dramatic critic, Leland.

517
00:35:47,195 --> 00:35:49,130
You still eating?
- I'm still hungry.

518
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,666
Here's a front-page story in the Chronicle...

519
00:35:51,766 --> 00:35:54,903
...about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone
in Brooklyn who's missing.

520
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:59,607
She's probably murdered. Why isn't
there something about it in the Inquirer?

521
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:01,476
We're running a newspaper...

522
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:05,313
I'm absolutely starving to death.
...not a scandal sheet.

523
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,614
That's all right.

524
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:10,685
Mr. Carter, here is a three-column headline
in the Chronicle.

525
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:13,321
Why hasn't the Inquirer
a three-column headline?

526
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,823
The news wasn't big enough.

527
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:19,661
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough,
it makes the news big enough.

528
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,363
That's right.
- The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone...

529
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:24,632
There's no proof
that she was murdered, or dead.

530
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:27,569
It says she's missing.
The neighbors are getting suspicious.

531
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:30,538
It's not our function
to report the gossip of housewives.

532
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:34,809
If we were interested in that kind of thing,
we could fill the paper twice over, daily.

533
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:38,279
That's the kind of thing we are going to be
interested in from now on.

534
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:41,349
I want you to send your best man
to see Mr. Silverstone.

535
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,286
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't
produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone...

536
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:47,455
...the Inquirer will have him arrested.

537
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:50,024
Tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from...

538
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,760
Central Office.
- The Central Office.

539
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,398
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious
and asks to see your man's badge...

540
00:36:57,498 --> 00:37:01,469
...your man is to get indignant
and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.

541
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:04,739
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear.
You ready for dinner, Jedediah?

542
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,176
I can't see that the function
of a respectable newspaper...

543
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:11,591
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter. Goodbye.

544
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:13,815
Goodbye.

545
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:16,782
Paper. Read all about it.

546
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,888
Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.

547
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,758
The mystery of the lady
that vanished in Brooklyn.

548
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:27,938
Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.

549
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:43,711
We'll be on the street soon,
Charlie, another 10 minutes.

550
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:46,514
Three hours and 50 minutes late,
but we did it.

551
00:37:46,614 --> 00:37:48,149
Tired?
- A tough day.

552
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:49,851
A wasted day.
- Wasted?

553
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:53,021
You only made the paper over
four times tonight, that's all.

554
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:56,557
I've changed the front page a little,
Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough.

555
00:37:56,657 --> 00:38:01,362
There's something I've got to get into
this paper besides pictures and print.

556
00:38:01,462 --> 00:38:04,565
I've got to make the New York Inquirer
as important to New York...

557
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:07,045
...as the gas in that light.

558
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,937
What are you going to do, Charlie?

559
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:13,372
My Declaration of Principles.
Don't smile, Jedediah.

560
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:16,446
I've got it all written out here.

561
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:19,681
You don't want to make any promises
you don't want to keep.

562
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:21,781
These'll be kept.

563
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,086
'I'll provide the people of this city...

564
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:29,857
'... with a daily paper
that will tell all the news honestly.

565
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:33,328
'I will also provide...'
- That's two sentences starting with 'I.'

566
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:35,964
People will know who's responsible...

567
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:40,134
...and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer,
quickly, simply and entertainingly.

568
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,571
No special interests will be allowed
to interfere with that truth.

569
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:47,542
'I will also provide them with a fighting
and tireless champion of their rights...

570
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:50,872
'... as citizens and as human beings.'

571
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,513
Signed:

572
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:55,207
'Charles Foster Kane.'

573
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:59,787
Can I have that, Charlie?
- I'm going to print it.

574
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:01,887
Solly.

575
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:03,424
Yes, Mr. Kane?

576
00:39:03,524 --> 00:39:06,361
I want you to run this editorial
in a box on the front page.

577
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:07,895
This morning's front page?

578
00:39:07,995 --> 00:39:11,065
That's right, Solly,
that means we'll have to remake again.

579
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:12,934
Yes.
- Go down and tell them.

580
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:14,569
All right.

581
00:39:14,669 --> 00:39:19,344
When you're through with that,
I'd like to have it back.

582
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:23,344
I'd like to keep that particular
piece of paper myself.

583
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:27,682
I have a hunch it might turn out
to be something pretty important.

584
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,943
A document...
- Sure.

585
00:39:30,017 --> 00:39:34,155
...like the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution...

586
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:37,485
...and my first report card at school.

587
00:40:05,086 --> 00:40:08,389
I know you're tired, gentlemen,
but I brought you here for a reason.

588
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:12,126
This little pilgrimage will do us good.
- The Chronicle's a good newspaper.

589
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:15,296
Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper.
Notice the circulation.

590
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:20,299
495,000.
But look who's working for the Chronicle.

591
00:40:20,368 --> 00:40:23,671
With them, it's no trick to get circulation.
- You're right.

592
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:27,008
You know how long it took the Chronicle
to get that staff together?

593
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:29,872
Twenty years.
- Twenty years?

594
00:40:30,444 --> 00:40:35,516
Six years ago, I looked at a picture
of the world's greatest newspaper men.

595
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:37,785
I felt like a kid in front of a candy store.

596
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:42,220
Tonight, six years later,
I got my candy, all of it.

597
00:40:42,456 --> 00:40:44,392
Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.

598
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:49,097
Make an extra copy of that picture
and mail it to the Chronicle.

599
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,567
It'll make you all happy to learn
that our circulation this morning...

600
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:56,152
...was the greatest in New York: 684,000.

601
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:59,963
684,132.

602
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,809
Right.

603
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:05,613
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness
in taking leave of you.

604
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,116
I'm going abroad next week for a vacation.

605
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,752
I've promised my doctor for sometime
that I would leave when I could.

606
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:13,852
I now realize I can't.

607
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,958
Say, Mr. Kane,
as long as you're promising...

608
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:21,062
...there's a lot of pictures and statues
in Europe you ain't bought yet.

609
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:23,397
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.

610
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:26,134
They've been making statues
for 2,000 years.

611
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,336
And I've only been buying for five.

612
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:30,938
Promise me, Mr. Kane.
- I promise, Mr. Bernstein.

613
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:33,871
Thank you.
- Mr. Bernstein?

614
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:38,786
You don't expect me to keep
any of those promises, do you?

615
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:41,106
And now, gentlemen.

616
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:44,497
Your complete attention, if you please.

617
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:53,503
Are we going to declare war on Spain?

618
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:05,519
Oh, mama, here they come.
Shoot me while I'm happy.

619
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,282
I said, 'Are we going to declare
war on Spain, or are we not? '

620
00:42:18,386 --> 00:42:20,511
The Inquirer already has.

621
00:42:20,554 --> 00:42:24,388
You long-faced, overdressed anarchist.

622
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,427
I'm not overdressed.

623
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:29,697
You are, too.
Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.

624
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,899
Let's have the song about Charlie.

625
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:35,403
Is there a song about Charlie?
- Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?

626
00:42:35,503 --> 00:42:41,538
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town,
you get a song written about you.

627
00:42:49,684 --> 00:42:52,086
I've seen that fellow. He's good.

628
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:53,588
Good evening, Mr. Kane.

629
00:42:53,688 --> 00:42:56,657
'There is a man, a certain man...

630
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,194
'And for the poor you may be sure
that he'll do all he can...

631
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:03,752
'Who is this one? This favorite son...

632
00:43:03,798 --> 00:43:06,734
'Just by his action
has the traction magnates on the run...

633
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,133
'Who loves to smoke, enjoys a joke...

634
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:13,474
'Who wouldn't get a bit upset
if he were really broke...

635
00:43:13,574 --> 00:43:16,677
'With wealth and fame he's still the same...

636
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:22,047
'I'll bet you $5 you're not alive
if you don't know his name...

637
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,555
'What is his name?

638
00:43:27,655 --> 00:43:30,124
'It's Charlie Kane, it's Mister Kane.

639
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:35,239
'He doesn't like that Mister
He likes good old Charlie Kane'

640
00:43:49,744 --> 00:43:52,713
Isn't it wonderful? Such a party.
- Yes.

641
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:54,682
What's the matter?

642
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:58,047
'Who says a miss was made to kiss...

643
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:01,389
'And when he meets one
always tries to do exactly this...

644
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:04,525
'Who buys the food, who buys the drinks...

645
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:07,928
'Who thinks that dough was made
to spend and acts the way he thinks...

646
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:10,792
'Now is it, Joe, no, no, no'

647
00:44:11,532 --> 00:44:14,135
Bernstein, these men
who are now with the Inquirer...

648
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,971
...who were with the Chronicle
until yesterday...

649
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,673
Oh, mama, please.

650
00:44:18,773 --> 00:44:20,241
Give me that.
- What? The blonde?

651
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:24,846
No, the brunette.
- Where did you learn that, Charlie?

652
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:28,482
Bernstein, these men
who were with the Chronicle...

653
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,686
...weren't they just as devoted
to the Chronicle policy...

654
00:44:31,786 --> 00:44:33,954
...as they are now to our policies?

655
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:36,924
Sure, they're just like anybody else.

656
00:44:37,024 --> 00:44:39,293
They got work to do, they do it.

657
00:44:39,393 --> 00:44:43,728
Only they happen to be
the best men in the business.

658
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:55,109
Do we stand for the same things
the Chronicle stands for?

659
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:57,209
Certainly not.

660
00:44:57,978 --> 00:45:03,117
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed
to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

661
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:07,655
There's always a chance, of course,
that they'll change Mr. Kane.

662
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:09,755
Without his knowing it.

663
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:16,153
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane.

664
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,268
I got a cable here from Mr. Kane.
- What?

665
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:23,304
From Paris, France.
- What?

666
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:26,373
From Paris, France.
- Come on in.

667
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:32,245
'Who by his action
has the traction magnates on the run'

668
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,935
It's a good thing he promised
not to send back any more statues.

669
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:41,722
Look, he wants to buy
the world's biggest diamond.

670
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,359
Why didn't you go to Europe with him?
He wanted you to.

671
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:48,262
I wanted Charlie to have fun,
with me along...

672
00:45:48,362 --> 00:45:50,564
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?

673
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:55,679
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?
Am I a New England schoolmarm?

674
00:45:56,103 --> 00:45:58,103
Yes.

675
00:45:58,706 --> 00:46:03,210
If you thought I'd answer you different
from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.

676
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:04,712
'World's biggest diamond.'

677
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:07,148
I didn't know Charlie
was collecting diamonds.

678
00:46:07,248 --> 00:46:08,749
He ain't.

679
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,420
He's collecting somebody
that's collecting diamonds.

680
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,005
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.

681
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:19,760
'Welcome home, Mr. Kane...

682
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,631
'... from 467 employees
of the New York Inquirer.'

683
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:25,731
Here he comes.

684
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:31,270
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

685
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,674
I know I've a moustache.
- It looks awful.

686
00:46:33,774 --> 00:46:37,369
Have we got a society editor?

687
00:46:37,444 --> 00:46:40,347
Right here, Mr. Kane.
- Miss Townsend is the society editor.

688
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:44,218
Miss Townsend,
this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane.

689
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:49,523
Miss Townsend, I've been away so long.
I don't know your routine.

690
00:46:49,623 --> 00:46:52,751
I got a little social announcement.

691
00:46:52,793 --> 00:46:56,897
I wish you wouldn't treat this
any differently than you would any other...

692
00:46:56,997 --> 00:46:58,997
...social announcement.

693
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:02,303
Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees
of the Inquirer...

694
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:06,653
Mr. Bernstein,
thank you very much, everybody, I...

695
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,936
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.

696
00:47:11,111 --> 00:47:13,111
Goodbye.

697
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,797
Say, he was in an awful hurry.

698
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,586
Hey, everybody, look out here.

699
00:47:18,686 --> 00:47:20,686
Let's go to the window.

700
00:47:20,854 --> 00:47:23,724
Mr. Leland. Mr. Bernstein.
- Yes, Ms. Townsend?

701
00:47:23,824 --> 00:47:26,694
This announcement:
'Mr. And Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton...

702
00:47:26,794 --> 00:47:30,297
'... announce the engagement
of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...

703
00:47:30,397 --> 00:47:32,132
'... to Mr. Charles Foster Kane.'

704
00:47:32,232 --> 00:47:34,232
Come on.

705
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:41,242
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece
of the President of the United States.

706
00:47:41,342 --> 00:47:43,342
President's niece?

707
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:47,709
Before he's through,
she'll be a president's wife.

708
00:47:55,222 --> 00:47:58,626
The way things turned out,
I don't need to tell you.

709
00:47:58,726 --> 00:48:01,428
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.

710
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:03,964
It didn't end very well, did it?

711
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:06,064
It ended.

712
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:09,925
Then there was Susie. That ended, too.

713
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:15,609
You know, Mr. Thompson, I was thinking...

714
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:19,747
...this Rosebud
you're trying to find out about...

715
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:21,847
Yes?

716
00:48:25,586 --> 00:48:28,391
Maybe that was something he lost.

717
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:32,760
Mr. Kane was a man who lost
almost everything he had.

718
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,095
You ought to see Jed Leland.

719
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:38,365
Of course, he and Mr. Kane
didn't exactly see eye to eye.

720
00:48:38,465 --> 00:48:40,434
You take the Spanish-American war.

721
00:48:40,534 --> 00:48:43,871
I guess Mr. Leland was right.
That was Mr. Kane's war.

722
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:47,675
We didn't really have anything
to fight about.

723
00:48:47,775 --> 00:48:51,545
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war
of Mr. Kane's...

724
00:48:51,645 --> 00:48:54,409
...we'd have the Panama Canal?

725
00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:58,024
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.

726
00:48:58,152 --> 00:49:02,523
A lot of the time now
they don't tell me these things.

727
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:04,458
Maybe even he's dead.

728
00:49:04,558 --> 00:49:06,260
In case you'd like to know...

729
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,296
...he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital
on 180th Street.

730
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:10,864
You don't say. I had...

731
00:49:10,964 --> 00:49:13,834
Nothing particular the matter with him,
they tell me, just...

732
00:49:13,934 --> 00:49:16,528
Just old age.

733
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:23,533
It's the only disease that you don't
look forward to being cured of.

734
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,725
I can remember absolutely everything,
young man.

735
00:49:37,825 --> 00:49:39,093
That's my curse.

736
00:49:39,193 --> 00:49:44,632
That's one of the greatest curses
ever inflicted on the human race: Memory.

737
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:49,703
I was his oldest friend, and as far as
I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.

738
00:49:49,803 --> 00:49:54,575
Not that Charlie was ever brutal.
He just did brutal things.

739
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:59,113
Maybe I wasn't his friend,
but if I wasn't, he never had one.

740
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:02,868
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

741
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:05,219
You were about to say something
about Rosebud.

742
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:07,521
Do you happen to have a good cigar?

743
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:11,458
I've got a young physician here
who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.

744
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:14,094
No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sorry.

745
00:50:14,194 --> 00:50:15,863
I changed the subject, didn't I?

746
00:50:15,963 --> 00:50:19,266
What a disagreeable old man
I have become.

747
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:25,316
You're a reporter and you want to know
what I think about Charlie Kane.

748
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:30,144
I suppose he had some private sort
of greatness.

749
00:50:30,244 --> 00:50:31,945
But he kept it to himself.

750
00:50:32,045 --> 00:50:34,982
He never gave himself away.
He never gave anything away.

751
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:38,074
He just left you a tip.

752
00:50:39,553 --> 00:50:40,921
He had a generous mind.

753
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:44,391
I don't suppose anybody
ever had so many opinions.

754
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:47,194
But he never believed in anything
except Charlie Kane.

755
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:51,098
He never had a conviction
except Charlie Kane in his life.

756
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:53,467
I suppose he died without one.

757
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,403
That must have been pretty unpleasant.

758
00:50:56,503 --> 00:51:01,141
Of course, a lot of us check out without
having any special convictions about death.

759
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:05,079
But we do know what we're leaving.
We do believe in something.

760
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:08,282
Are you absolutely sure
you haven't got a cigar?

761
00:51:08,382 --> 00:51:10,350
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
- Never mind.

762
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:14,105
What do you know about Rosebud?
- 'Rosebud'?

763
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:18,286
His dying words: 'Rosebud.'

764
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:20,920
I saw that in the Inquirer.

765
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:24,698
I never believed anything
I saw in the Inquirer.

766
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:26,200
Anything else?

767
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,304
I can tell you about Emily.
I went to dancing school with Emily.

768
00:51:30,404 --> 00:51:32,404
I was very graceful.

769
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,477
We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane.
- What was she like?

770
00:51:36,577 --> 00:51:39,079
She was like all the girls I knew
in dancing school.

771
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,664
Very nice girl. Emily was a little nicer.

772
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,686
After the first couple of months...

773
00:51:45,786 --> 00:51:50,691
...she and Charlie didn't see much
of each other except at breakfast.

774
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:54,701
It was a marriage
just like any other marriage.

775
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,339
You're beautiful.
- I can't be.

776
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:07,174
Yes, you are. You're very beautiful.

777
00:52:07,274 --> 00:52:09,977
I've never been to six parties
in one night before.

778
00:52:10,077 --> 00:52:12,780
I've never been up this late.
- It's a matter of habit.

779
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,849
What will the servants think?
- That we enjoyed ourselves.

780
00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:18,452
Why do you have to go straight off
to the newspaper?

781
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:23,090
You never should've married a
newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.

782
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:25,190
I absolutely adore you.

783
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:29,293
Charles, even newspapermen
have to sleep.

784
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:35,002
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him
put off my appointments till noon.

785
00:52:35,102 --> 00:52:36,703
What time is it?

786
00:52:36,803 --> 00:52:38,843
I don't know. It's late.

787
00:52:40,807 --> 00:52:42,807
It's early.

788
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:44,876
Charles...

789
00:52:45,212 --> 00:52:48,148
Do you know how long
you kept me waiting last night...

790
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:51,218
...when you went to the newspaper
for 10 minutes?

791
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:54,555
What do you do in a newspaper
in the middle of the night?

792
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:59,649
My dear, your only correspondent
is the Inquirer.

793
00:52:59,726 --> 00:53:02,496
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival
of flesh and blood.

794
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,132
I don't spend that much time
on the newspaper.

795
00:53:05,232 --> 00:53:09,303
It isn't just the time.
It's what you print, attacking the President.

796
00:53:09,403 --> 00:53:12,606
You mean Uncle John.
- I mean the President of the United States.

797
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:15,142
He's still Uncle John
and a well-meaning fathead...

798
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:18,612
...who's letting a pack of high-pressure
crooks run his administration.

799
00:53:18,712 --> 00:53:22,482
This whole oil scandal...
- He happens to be the President, not you.

800
00:53:22,582 --> 00:53:25,385
That's a mistake that will be corrected
one of these days.

801
00:53:25,485 --> 00:53:31,350
Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior
the most incredible atrocity yesterday.

802
00:53:31,725 --> 00:53:34,955
I simply can't have it in the nursery.

803
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,766
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit
to the nursery now and then.

804
00:53:39,866 --> 00:53:41,866
Does he have to?

805
00:53:42,536 --> 00:53:43,604
Yes.

806
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:49,229
Really, Charles, people will think...
- What I tell them to think.

807
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:09,062
Wasn't he ever in love with her?

808
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,162
He married for love.

809
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:13,798
Love.

810
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,569
That is why he did everything.

811
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,605
That's why he went into politics.
It seems we weren't enough.

812
00:54:18,705 --> 00:54:22,275
He wanted all the voters to love him, too.

813
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:25,417
All he wanted out of life was love.

814
00:54:25,779 --> 00:54:29,094
That's Charlie's story. How he lost it.

815
00:54:29,216 --> 00:54:32,701
You see, he just didn't have any to give.

816
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,225
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.

817
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,790
Very dearly.

818
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:41,161
And his mother,
I guess he always loved her.

819
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:45,001
How about his second wife?
- Susan Alexander?

820
00:54:45,098 --> 00:54:47,367
You know what Charlie called her?

821
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:50,304
The day after he'd met her,
he told me about her.

822
00:54:50,404 --> 00:54:55,307
He said she was
'a cross-section of the American public.'

823
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:01,214
I guess he couldn't help it.
She must have had something for him.

824
00:55:01,314 --> 00:55:04,799
That first night, according to Charlie...

825
00:55:05,152 --> 00:55:07,787
...all she had was a toothache.

826
00:55:38,676 --> 00:55:41,821
What are you laughing at, young lady?

827
00:55:43,047 --> 00:55:45,816
What's the matter with you?
- Toothache.

828
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:47,651
What?
- Toothache.

829
00:55:47,751 --> 00:55:49,751
Toothache?

830
00:55:52,523 --> 00:55:55,243
You mean you've got a toothache.

831
00:55:55,459 --> 00:55:58,329
What's funny about that?
- You're funny, mister.

832
00:55:58,429 --> 00:56:00,965
You've got dirt on your face.
- Not dirt, it's mud.

833
00:56:01,065 --> 00:56:03,367
Do you want some hot water?
I live right here.

834
00:56:03,467 --> 00:56:05,507
What's that, young lady?

835
00:56:06,704 --> 00:56:09,340
I said, if you wanted some hot water...

836
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,604
...I could get you some... hot water.

837
00:56:17,181 --> 00:56:19,816
All right, thank you very much.

838
00:56:33,864 --> 00:56:35,799
Do I look any better now?

839
00:56:35,899 --> 00:56:42,869
This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
- What you need is to get your mind off it.

840
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:49,046
Excuse me, but my landlady
prefers me to keep this door open...

841
00:56:49,146 --> 00:56:52,116
...when I have a gentleman caller.
- All right.

842
00:56:52,216 --> 00:56:54,318
You have got a toothache, haven't you?

843
00:56:54,418 --> 00:56:57,454
I surely have.
- Why don't you try laughing at me again?

844
00:56:57,554 --> 00:56:59,490
What?
- I'm still pretty funny.

845
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,126
I know, but you don't want me
to laugh at you.

846
00:57:02,226 --> 00:57:04,295
I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.

847
00:57:04,395 --> 00:57:05,996
Look at me.

848
00:57:06,096 --> 00:57:07,198
See that?

849
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,632
What are you doing?

850
00:57:08,732 --> 00:57:12,387
I'm wiggling both my ears at the same time.

851
00:57:13,404 --> 00:57:15,404
That's it, smile.

852
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:21,679
It took me two solid years at the best
boys' school in the world to learn that.

853
00:57:21,779 --> 00:57:26,369
The fellow who taught me
is now president of Venezuela.

854
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:28,917
That's it.

855
00:57:32,122 --> 00:57:34,725
Is it a giraffe?
- No, not a giraffe.

856
00:57:34,825 --> 00:57:37,726
I bet it is.
- What?

857
00:57:37,795 --> 00:57:39,964
Well, then it's an elephant.

858
00:57:40,064 --> 00:57:43,830
It's supposed to be a rooster.
- A rooster.

859
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:48,105
You know an awful lot of tricks.
Are you a professional magician?

860
00:57:48,205 --> 00:57:50,808
No, I'm not a magician.
- I was just joking.

861
00:57:50,908 --> 00:57:52,543
You really don't know who I am?

862
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:55,713
You told me your name, Mr. Kane,
but I'm awfully ignorant.

863
00:57:55,813 --> 00:58:00,384
I guess you caught on to that.
I bet I've heard your name a million times.

864
00:58:00,484 --> 00:58:03,554
You really like me, though,
even though you don't know who I am?

865
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:07,090
I surely do. You've been wonderful.

866
00:58:08,158 --> 00:58:10,861
Without you I don't know
what I would have done.

867
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:14,531
I had a toothache,
and I don't know many people.

868
00:58:14,631 --> 00:58:16,631
I know too many people.

869
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:19,144
I guess we're both lonely.

870
00:58:19,269 --> 00:58:23,207
Want to know what I was going to do
before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?

871
00:58:23,307 --> 00:58:26,577
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.
You probably have more.

872
00:58:26,677 --> 00:58:28,677
I was just joking.

873
00:58:29,613 --> 00:58:33,517
I was on my way
to the Western Manhattan Warehouse...

874
00:58:33,617 --> 00:58:35,742
...in search of my youth.

875
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,292
You see, my mother died a long time ago.
Her things were put in storage out West.

876
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,827
There wasn't any other place to put them.

877
00:58:43,927 --> 00:58:47,965
I thought I'd send for them now.
Tonight I was going to take a look at them.

878
00:58:48,065 --> 00:58:50,615
A sort of sentimental journey.

879
00:58:53,904 --> 00:58:56,173
I run a couple of newspapers.
What do you do?

880
00:58:56,273 --> 00:58:57,508
Me?

881
00:58:57,608 --> 00:58:59,810
How old did you say you were?
- I didn't say.

882
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,579
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.

883
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:03,881
How old?
- Pretty old.

884
00:59:03,981 --> 00:59:06,050
How old?
- Twenty-two in August.

885
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,152
That's a ripe old age. What do you do?

886
00:59:08,252 --> 00:59:11,889
I work at Seligman's.
I'm in charge of the sheet music.

887
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:17,227
Is that what you want to do?
- No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.

888
00:59:17,327 --> 00:59:20,898
That is, I didn't. My mother did for me.
- What happened to the singing?

889
00:59:20,998 --> 00:59:25,002
Mother always thought, she always talked
about grand opera for me.

890
00:59:25,102 --> 00:59:26,537
Imagine.

891
00:59:26,637 --> 00:59:32,543
But my voice isn't that kind.
It's just, you know what mothers are like.

892
00:59:32,643 --> 00:59:34,643
Yes.

893
00:59:35,913 --> 00:59:38,711
Have you got a piano?
- A piano?

894
00:59:39,683 --> 00:59:41,452
Yes, there's one in the parlor.

895
00:59:41,552 --> 00:59:44,588
Would you sing for me?
- You wouldn't want to hear me sing.

896
00:59:44,688 --> 00:59:46,688
Yes, I would.

897
00:59:47,858 --> 00:59:50,060
Don't tell me
your toothache is bothering you.

898
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,160
No, that's all gone.

899
00:59:53,664 --> 00:59:55,664
All right.

900
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,302
Let's go to the parlor.

901
00:59:58,402 --> 01:00:04,204
'Yes, Lindor shall be mine...

902
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:09,134
'I have sworn it...

903
01:00:10,013 --> 01:00:12,880
'For weal or woe...

904
01:00:14,952 --> 01:00:17,716
'Yes, Lindor...

905
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:27,794
'Lo giurai...

906
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:33,068
'La vincer'

907
01:00:41,111 --> 01:00:43,580
There is only one man
who can rid the politics...

908
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,917
...of this state of the evil domination
of Boss Jim Gettys.

909
01:00:47,017 --> 01:00:50,888
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane,
the fighting liberal...

910
01:00:50,988 --> 01:00:54,558
...the friend of the workingman,
the next governor of this state...

911
01:00:54,658 --> 01:00:56,860
...who entered upon this campaign...

912
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,896
...with one purpose only:

913
01:00:58,996 --> 01:01:03,365
To point out
and make public the dishonesty...

914
01:01:03,634 --> 01:01:08,639
...the downright villainy
of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine...

915
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:13,377
...now in complete control
of the government of this state.

916
01:01:13,477 --> 01:01:17,243
I made no campaign promises...

917
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:23,306
...because. Until a few weeks ago.
I had no hope of being elected.

918
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:28,185
Now. However. I have something more
than a hope.

919
01:01:31,428 --> 01:01:35,083
Jim Gettys has something less
than a chance.

920
01:01:38,368 --> 01:01:40,368
Every straw vote...

921
01:01:40,437 --> 01:01:45,272
...every independent poll shows
that I will be elected.

922
01:01:45,742 --> 01:01:47,478
Very well.

923
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:50,893
Now I can afford to make some promises.

924
01:02:00,657 --> 01:02:02,793
The workingman and the slum child...

925
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:08,024
...know they can expect
my best efforts in their interests.

926
01:02:08,098 --> 01:02:12,669
The decent. Ordinary citizens know
that I'll do everything in my power...

927
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:18,379
...to protect the underprivileged.
The underpaid. And the underfed.

928
01:02:21,912 --> 01:02:26,246
Mother, is Pop governor yet?
- Not yet, Junior.

929
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,487
I'd make my promises now...

930
01:02:33,824 --> 01:02:37,819
...if I weren't too busy
arranging to keep them.

931
01:02:41,865 --> 01:02:44,857
But here's one promise I'll make...

932
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:48,505
...and Boss Jim Gettys knows I'll keep it.

933
01:02:49,272 --> 01:02:52,409
My first official act
as governor of this state...

934
01:02:52,509 --> 01:02:57,514
...will be to appoint a special district
attorney to arrange for the indictment...

935
01:02:57,614 --> 01:03:03,314
...prosecution and conviction
of Boss Jim W. Gettys.

936
01:03:29,546 --> 01:03:32,749
If the election were held today,
you'd be in by 100,000 votes.

937
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:34,685
Gettys isn't even pretending.
- Pop.

938
01:03:34,785 --> 01:03:36,887
Hello, son.
- He isn't just scared, he's sick.

939
01:03:36,987 --> 01:03:39,790
It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys
I mean what I say.

940
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:43,226
Did you like your old man's speech?
- I could hear every word.

941
01:03:43,326 --> 01:03:45,326
Hello, Emily.
- Hold it.

942
01:03:45,562 --> 01:03:48,198
Great speech, Mr. Kane.
- Wonderful.

943
01:03:48,298 --> 01:03:50,630
Will you get us a taxi?

944
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:55,172
I'm sending Junior home
in the car with Oliver.

945
01:03:55,272 --> 01:03:57,272
Good night, Father.

946
01:03:58,241 --> 01:04:00,241
Goodbye, son.

947
01:04:10,821 --> 01:04:14,257
Why did you send Junior home in the car?
What are you doing in a taxi?

948
01:04:14,357 --> 01:04:16,493
There's a call I want you to make with me.

949
01:04:16,593 --> 01:04:18,495
It can wait.
- No, it can't.

950
01:04:18,595 --> 01:04:20,263
What's this all about, Emily?

951
01:04:20,363 --> 01:04:23,600
It may not be about anything at all.
I intend to find out.

952
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:28,630
Where are you going?
- I'm going to '185 West 74th Street.'

953
01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:32,240
If you wish, you may come with me.

954
01:04:36,413 --> 01:04:38,413
I'll come with you.

955
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:47,625
I had no idea you had this flair
for melodrama, Emily.

956
01:04:48,191 --> 01:04:50,231
Come right in, Mr. Kane.

957
01:05:00,737 --> 01:05:02,737
Charlie.

958
01:05:08,845 --> 01:05:11,882
He forced me to send your wife that letter.
I didn't want to.

959
01:05:11,982 --> 01:05:15,127
He's been saying the most terrible...

960
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:21,089
Mrs. Kane.

961
01:05:22,759 --> 01:05:26,329
I don't suppose
anybody would introduce us.

962
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:28,730
I'm Jim Gettys.

963
01:05:28,899 --> 01:05:30,899
Yes?

964
01:05:33,303 --> 01:05:37,007
I made Miss Alexander send you the note,
Mrs. Kane.

965
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:39,342
She didn't want to at first. But she did it.

966
01:05:39,442 --> 01:05:43,280
Charlie, the things he said to me...
He threatened to...

967
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:47,217
I won't wait until I'm elected.
To start with, I think I'll break your neck.

968
01:05:47,317 --> 01:05:50,802
Maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't.

969
01:05:51,154 --> 01:05:56,159
Your breaking this man's neck
would scarcely explain this note:

970
01:05:56,259 --> 01:06:00,097
'Serious consequences for Mr. Kane,
for yourself and for your son.'

971
01:06:00,197 --> 01:06:03,200
He wanted to get her to come here...
- What does this note mean?

972
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,869
I'm Susan Alexander.
I know what you're thinking...

973
01:06:05,969 --> 01:06:08,772
What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander?
- She don't know.

974
01:06:08,872 --> 01:06:11,675
She sent it because I told her
it wouldn't be smart not to.

975
01:06:11,775 --> 01:06:15,212
Emily, this gentleman...
- I'm not a gentleman.

976
01:06:15,312 --> 01:06:18,148
Your husband is only trying to be funny
calling me one.

977
01:06:18,248 --> 01:06:21,478
I don't even know what a gentleman is.

978
01:06:21,885 --> 01:06:25,116
You see, my idea of a gentleman...

979
01:06:28,325 --> 01:06:31,728
If I owned a paper and didn't like
the way somebody was doing things...

980
01:06:31,828 --> 01:06:34,231
...some politician,
I'd fight him with all I had.

981
01:06:34,331 --> 01:06:36,133
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit...

982
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:38,568
...so his family could see his picture
in the paper.

983
01:06:38,668 --> 01:06:43,440
You're a cheap, crooked grafter...
- We're talking now about what you are.

984
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:46,343
I'm fighting for my life,
not just my political life.

985
01:06:46,443 --> 01:06:48,612
He said unless you...
- That's what I said.

986
01:06:48,712 --> 01:06:52,682
Here's the chance I'm willing to give him.
It's more of a chance than he'd give me.

987
01:06:52,782 --> 01:06:57,521
Unless he decides by tomorrow that
he's so sick he has to go away for a year...

988
01:06:57,621 --> 01:07:01,892
...Monday morning, all papers in the state,
except his, will carry the story I'll give.

989
01:07:01,992 --> 01:07:03,992
What story?

990
01:07:04,194 --> 01:07:07,330
The story about him and Ms. Alexander.
- There isn't any story.

991
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:08,932
Shut up.

992
01:07:09,032 --> 01:07:11,802
We've got evidence that would look bad
in the headlines.

993
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:15,302
Do you want me to give you the evidence?

994
01:07:16,673 --> 01:07:19,476
I'd rather he withdrew
without having the story published.

995
01:07:19,576 --> 01:07:24,421
Not that I care about him,
but I'd be better off that way.

996
01:07:25,582 --> 01:07:27,675
So would you, Mrs. Kane.

997
01:07:28,084 --> 01:07:30,143
What about me?

998
01:07:32,155 --> 01:07:35,959
He said my name would be dragged
through the mud. That everywhere I went...

999
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:39,429
There seems to be only one decision
you can make, Charles.

1000
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:42,589
I'd say that it'd been made for you.

1001
01:07:43,366 --> 01:07:45,602
You can't tell me the voters of this state...

1002
01:07:45,702 --> 01:07:48,471
I'm not interested in the voters
of this state right now.

1003
01:07:48,571 --> 01:07:50,006
I am interested in our son.

1004
01:07:50,106 --> 01:07:54,441
Charlie, if they publish this story...
- They won't.

1005
01:07:54,544 --> 01:07:56,705
Good night, Mr. Gettys.

1006
01:08:05,622 --> 01:08:07,715
Are you coming, Charles?

1007
01:08:09,926 --> 01:08:11,926
No.

1008
01:08:14,698 --> 01:08:16,698
I'm staying here.

1009
01:08:19,469 --> 01:08:21,764
I can fight this all alone.

1010
01:08:22,806 --> 01:08:25,275
If you don't listen to reason,
it may be too late.

1011
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:29,334
Too late? For what?

1012
01:08:31,448 --> 01:08:34,713
For you and this public thief...

1013
01:08:35,051 --> 01:08:37,354
...to take the love of the people
away from me?

1014
01:08:37,454 --> 01:08:40,257
You got other things to think about.
Your little boy.

1015
01:08:40,357 --> 01:08:42,792
You don't want him to read about you
in the papers.

1016
01:08:42,892 --> 01:08:49,182
There's only one person in the world
to decide what I'll do. And that's me.

1017
01:08:50,266 --> 01:08:55,451
You decided what you were going to do,
Charles, some time ago.

1018
01:09:01,077 --> 01:09:03,713
You're making a bigger fool of yourself
than I thought.

1019
01:09:03,813 --> 01:09:06,149
I've got nothing to say to you.
- You're licked...

1020
01:09:06,249 --> 01:09:09,786
Get out. If you want to see me,
have the warden write me a letter.

1021
01:09:09,886 --> 01:09:14,724
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going
to happen to you would be a lesson to you.

1022
01:09:14,824 --> 01:09:18,261
Only you're going to need
more than one lesson.

1023
01:09:18,361 --> 01:09:23,934
And you'll get more than one lesson.
- Don't worry about me, Gettys.

1024
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:26,127
Don't worry about me.

1025
01:09:27,003 --> 01:09:29,631
I'm Charles Foster Kane.

1026
01:09:30,206 --> 01:09:34,444
I'm no cheap, crooked politician
trying to save himself...

1027
01:09:34,544 --> 01:09:37,859
...from the consequences of his crimes.

1028
01:09:38,615 --> 01:09:42,642
Gettys. I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.

1029
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:44,912
Sing Sing, Gettys.

1030
01:09:48,191 --> 01:09:51,695
Have you a car, Mrs. Kane?
- Yes, thank you.

1031
01:09:51,795 --> 01:09:54,559
Good night.
- Good night.

1032
01:10:05,341 --> 01:10:09,334
Paper. Read all about it. Extra. Extra.

1033
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:15,909
Paper?
- No, thanks.

1034
01:10:30,834 --> 01:10:33,803
With a million majority
already against him...

1035
01:10:33,903 --> 01:10:37,374
...and the church counties
still to be heard from...

1036
01:10:37,474 --> 01:10:39,843
...I'm afraid we got no choice.

1037
01:10:39,943 --> 01:10:41,943
This one?

1038
01:10:44,848 --> 01:10:46,848
That one.

1039
01:11:09,906 --> 01:11:11,906
Good night again.

1040
01:11:22,919 --> 01:11:27,509
Is there anything I can...
- No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.

1041
01:11:28,024 --> 01:11:31,254
You better go home and get some sleep.

1042
01:11:31,427 --> 01:11:33,427
You, too.

1043
01:11:35,331 --> 01:11:37,331
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1044
01:12:02,258 --> 01:12:04,818
Hello, Jedediah.
- I'm drunk.

1045
01:12:08,464 --> 01:12:13,629
If you've got drunk to talk to me about...

1046
01:12:16,105 --> 01:12:18,740
...Ms. Alexander, don't bother.

1047
01:12:20,543 --> 01:12:22,543
I'm not interested.

1048
01:12:26,549 --> 01:12:30,969
I've set back the sacred cause of reform,
is that it?

1049
01:12:31,888 --> 01:12:33,888
All right.

1050
01:12:35,024 --> 01:12:38,328
If that's the way they want it,
the people have made their choice.

1051
01:12:38,428 --> 01:12:41,197
It's obvious the people prefer
Jim Gettys to me.

1052
01:12:41,297 --> 01:12:44,934
You talk about the people
as though you owned them.

1053
01:12:45,034 --> 01:12:47,971
As though they belong to you. Goodness.

1054
01:12:48,071 --> 01:12:52,942
As long as I can remember, you've talked
about giving the people their rights...

1055
01:12:53,042 --> 01:12:56,346
...as if you could make them
a present of liberty...

1056
01:12:56,446 --> 01:12:58,915
...as a reward for services rendered.

1057
01:12:59,015 --> 01:13:01,905
Jed.
- You remember the workingman?

1058
01:13:02,185 --> 01:13:04,905
I'll get drunk, too, Jedediah...

1059
01:13:06,322 --> 01:13:07,557
...if it'll do any good.

1060
01:13:07,657 --> 01:13:11,060
It won't do any good.
Besides you never get drunk.

1061
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,963
You used to write an awful lot
about the workingman...

1062
01:13:14,063 --> 01:13:14,931
Go on home.

1063
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:19,451
He's turning into something called
'organized labor.'

1064
01:13:19,702 --> 01:13:23,006
You won't like that one little bit
when you find out...

1065
01:13:23,106 --> 01:13:29,651
...it means your workingman expects
something as his right, and not your gift.

1066
01:13:30,346 --> 01:13:35,106
When your precious underprivileged
really get together...

1067
01:13:35,451 --> 01:13:37,451
Oh, boy...

1068
01:13:38,021 --> 01:13:40,990
That'll add up to something
bigger than your privilege...

1069
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:43,993
...then I don't know what you'll do.

1070
01:13:44,093 --> 01:13:49,703
Sail away to a desert island probably
and lord it over the monkeys.

1071
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:53,102
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

1072
01:13:53,202 --> 01:13:58,208
There'll probably be a few of them there
to tell me when I do something wrong.

1073
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:00,943
You may not always be so lucky.

1074
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:02,679
You're not very drunk.

1075
01:14:02,779 --> 01:14:04,819
Drunk, what do you care?

1076
01:14:05,181 --> 01:14:08,666
You don't care about anything except you.

1077
01:14:09,052 --> 01:14:15,158
You persuade people that you love them
so much that they ought to love you back.

1078
01:14:15,258 --> 01:14:18,403
Only you want love on your own terms.

1079
01:14:19,629 --> 01:14:24,814
It's something to be played your way,
according to your rules.

1080
01:14:29,706 --> 01:14:33,106
Let me work on the Chicago paper.
- What?

1081
01:14:33,176 --> 01:14:38,114
You said you were looking for someone
to do dramatic 'crimitism,' criticism.

1082
01:14:38,214 --> 01:14:40,214
I am drunk.

1083
01:14:42,518 --> 01:14:44,558
I want to go to Chicago.

1084
01:14:45,822 --> 01:14:47,947
You're too valuable here.

1085
01:14:49,792 --> 01:14:53,763
There's nothing left for me to do...
- All right, you can go to Chicago.

1086
01:14:53,863 --> 01:14:55,863
Thank you.

1087
01:14:56,165 --> 01:14:59,820
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.

1088
01:15:00,436 --> 01:15:02,872
I warn you, Jedediah,
you won't like Chicago.

1089
01:15:02,972 --> 01:15:07,610
The wind comes off the lake, and they've
probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.

1090
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:09,846
Will Saturday after next be all right?

1091
01:15:09,946 --> 01:15:12,326
Anytime you say.
- Thank you.

1092
01:15:17,653 --> 01:15:23,348
A toast to love on my terms.
Those are the only terms anybody knows:

1093
01:15:24,227 --> 01:15:26,227
His own.

1094
01:15:38,374 --> 01:15:41,094
Mr. Kane, I'm from the Inquirer.

1095
01:15:50,186 --> 01:15:53,056
What's that, young man?
- Are you through with politics?

1096
01:15:53,156 --> 01:15:57,160
Am I through with politics?
I would say vice versa.

1097
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,928
We're going to be an opera star.

1098
01:15:59,028 --> 01:16:00,863
Are you singing at the Metropolitan?

1099
01:16:00,963 --> 01:16:02,465
We certainly are.

1100
01:16:02,565 --> 01:16:05,401
Charlie said if I didn't,
he'd build me an opera house.

1101
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:07,541
That won't be necessary.

1102
01:16:11,874 --> 01:16:15,139
No, no, no.

1103
01:16:48,778 --> 01:16:50,778
Places, please.

1104
01:17:39,328 --> 01:17:42,098
Mr. Leland is writing it
from the dramatic angle?

1105
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:46,436
And we've covered it from the news end.
- And the social.

1106
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:48,831
How about the music notice?

1107
01:17:48,838 --> 01:17:50,807
Yes, it's already made up.

1108
01:17:50,907 --> 01:17:53,542
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.

1109
01:17:55,077 --> 01:17:59,241
Enthusiastic?
- Yes, sir.

1110
01:17:59,382 --> 01:18:02,010
Mr. Kane. This is a surprise.

1111
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,589
We've got two spreads of pictures.

1112
01:18:06,689 --> 01:18:08,524
The music notice on the front page?

1113
01:18:08,624 --> 01:18:12,874
But there's still one notice to come.
The dramatic.

1114
01:18:13,396 --> 01:18:15,396
The dramatic notice.

1115
01:18:16,098 --> 01:18:22,133
Mr. Bernstein, that's Mr. Leland, isn't it?
- Yes, we're waiting for it.

1116
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:27,855
Where is he?
- Right in there, Mr. Kane.

1117
01:18:35,518 --> 01:18:37,518
Mr. Kane.

1118
01:18:51,834 --> 01:18:54,462
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane...

1119
01:18:55,605 --> 01:18:58,904
...haven't spoken together for years.

1120
01:19:01,477 --> 01:19:05,642
You don't suppose...
- There's nothing to suppose.

1121
01:19:08,551 --> 01:19:10,551
Excuse me.

1122
01:19:26,902 --> 01:19:28,902
Close the door.

1123
01:19:31,741 --> 01:19:34,291
He ain't been drinking before.

1124
01:19:35,144 --> 01:19:37,439
Never. We would have heard.

1125
01:19:37,546 --> 01:19:39,546
What does it say there?

1126
01:19:40,016 --> 01:19:42,678
The notice, what's he written?

1127
01:19:44,387 --> 01:19:50,167
'Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty
but hopelessly incompetent amateur...

1128
01:19:52,895 --> 01:19:56,999
'... last night opened
the new Chicago Opera House...

1129
01:19:57,099 --> 01:19:59,479
'... in a performance of...'

1130
01:20:01,937 --> 01:20:05,464
I still can't pronounce that name.

1131
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:13,249
'Her singing, happily,
is no concern of this department.

1132
01:20:13,349 --> 01:20:17,514
'Of her acting,
it is absolutely impossible to...'

1133
01:20:18,988 --> 01:20:20,988
Go on.

1134
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:24,625
That's all there is.

1135
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:41,243
Of her acting it is absolutely
impossible to say anything except...

1136
01:20:41,343 --> 01:20:45,047
...that, in the opinion of this reviewer,
it represents a new low.

1137
01:20:45,147 --> 01:20:48,017
In the opinion of this reviewer.
- I didn't see that.

1138
01:20:48,117 --> 01:20:50,453
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein, I'm dictating it.

1139
01:20:50,553 --> 01:20:53,613
Mr. Kane, I...
- Get me a typewriter.

1140
01:20:54,924 --> 01:20:58,324
I'm going to finish Mr. Leland's notice.

1141
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:16,410
Hello, Bernstein.

1142
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:24,817
Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Leland.

1143
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:31,293
Where's my notice, Bernstein?
I've got to finish my notice.

1144
01:21:31,393 --> 01:21:35,048
Mr. Kane is finishing it for you.
- Charlie?

1145
01:21:40,636 --> 01:21:42,968
Charlie out there?

1146
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:47,174
I guess he's fixing it up.

1147
01:21:49,612 --> 01:21:52,502
I knew I'd never get that through.

1148
01:21:52,882 --> 01:21:57,186
Mr. Kane's finishing your review
just the way you started it.

1149
01:21:57,286 --> 01:22:01,536
He's writing a bad notice
like you wanted it to be.

1150
01:22:03,492 --> 01:22:05,617
I guess that'll show you.

1151
01:22:30,419 --> 01:22:32,419
Hello, Jedediah.

1152
01:22:35,591 --> 01:22:37,591
Hello, Charlie.

1153
01:22:38,627 --> 01:22:41,494
I didn't know we were speaking.

1154
01:22:41,831 --> 01:22:44,381
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.

1155
01:22:46,135 --> 01:22:48,296
You're fired.

1156
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:05,683
Everybody knows that story. Mr. Leland.
But why did he do it?

1157
01:23:06,622 --> 01:23:09,792
How could a man write a notice...
- You just don't know Charlie.

1158
01:23:09,892 --> 01:23:13,796
He thought that by finishing that notice
he'd show me he was an honest man.

1159
01:23:13,896 --> 01:23:16,132
He was always trying to prove something.

1160
01:23:16,232 --> 01:23:19,335
That whole thing about Susie
being an opera singer.

1161
01:23:19,435 --> 01:23:22,410
That was trying to prove something.

1162
01:23:22,471 --> 01:23:26,108
You know what the headline was
the day before the election?

1163
01:23:26,208 --> 01:23:32,204
'Candidate Kane found
in love nest with 'singer.'

1164
01:23:32,281 --> 01:23:34,383
He was going to take
the quotes off the singer.

1165
01:23:34,483 --> 01:23:35,618
Hey, nurse.

1166
01:23:35,718 --> 01:23:39,688
Five years ago he wrote
from that place down there in the South.

1167
01:23:39,788 --> 01:23:47,456
What's it called, Shangri-la? El Dorado?
Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?

1168
01:23:48,697 --> 01:23:53,031
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.

1169
01:23:53,102 --> 01:23:57,540
You caught on, didn't you?
I'm not that hard to see through.

1170
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,709
Well, I never even answered his letter.

1171
01:24:00,809 --> 01:24:02,178
Maybe I should have.

1172
01:24:02,278 --> 01:24:06,682
I guess he was pretty lonely down there
in that coliseum all those years.

1173
01:24:06,782 --> 01:24:09,819
He hadn't finished it when she left him.
He never finished it.

1174
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:13,455
He never finished anything
except my notice.

1175
01:24:13,555 --> 01:24:16,692
Of course, he built the joint for her.
- That must have been love.

1176
01:24:16,792 --> 01:24:17,893
I don't know.

1177
01:24:17,993 --> 01:24:23,132
He was disappointed in the world
so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.

1178
01:24:23,232 --> 01:24:25,768
It was something bigger
than an opera house anyway.

1179
01:24:25,868 --> 01:24:27,236
Nurse.
- Yes, Mr. Leland.

1180
01:24:27,336 --> 01:24:29,336
I'm coming.

1181
01:24:30,272 --> 01:24:33,776
There's one thing you can do for me.
- Sure.

1182
01:24:33,876 --> 01:24:38,514
Stop at the cigar store on your way out,
and get me a couple of good cigars.

1183
01:24:38,614 --> 01:24:40,707
Be glad to.
- Thank you.

1184
01:24:41,183 --> 01:24:42,852
One is enough.

1185
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:47,356
When I was a young man, there was
an impression that nurses were pretty.

1186
01:24:47,456 --> 01:24:49,525
Well, it was no truer then than it is today.

1187
01:24:49,625 --> 01:24:51,727
I'll take your arm.
- All right.

1188
01:24:51,827 --> 01:24:54,663
You won't forget about those cigars?
- I won't.

1189
01:24:54,763 --> 01:24:59,668
Have them wrapped like toothpaste,
or they'll stop them at the desk.

1190
01:24:59,768 --> 01:25:02,638
You know that young doctor
I was telling you about, well...

1191
01:25:02,738 --> 01:25:06,640
...he's got an idea
he wants to keep me alive.

1192
01:25:35,904 --> 01:25:40,542
I'd rather you'd just talk.
Anything that comes into your mind...

1193
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:42,912
...about yourself and Mr. Kane.

1194
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:49,472
You don't want to hear what comes into
my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.

1195
01:25:49,918 --> 01:25:55,858
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung
for Charlie that first time I met him.

1196
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:59,783
But I did an awful lot of singing after that.

1197
01:26:00,763 --> 01:26:04,631
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.

1198
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,269
The teachers got that, I didn't.
- What did you get?

1199
01:26:07,369 --> 01:26:10,873
I didn't get a thing, except music lessons.
That's all there was in it.

1200
01:26:10,973 --> 01:26:12,441
He married you, didn't he?

1201
01:26:12,541 --> 01:26:15,945
He didn't mention anything about marriage
until after it was over and...

1202
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:18,380
...until it got in the papers about us...

1203
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:23,619
...and he lost the election,
and that Norton woman divorced him.

1204
01:26:23,719 --> 01:26:25,721
He was really interested in my voice.

1205
01:26:25,821 --> 01:26:27,389
Why did he build that opera house?

1206
01:26:27,489 --> 01:26:32,249
I didn't want it. I didn't want a thing.
It was his idea.

1207
01:26:32,728 --> 01:26:34,938
Everything was his idea...

1208
01:26:37,766 --> 01:26:39,891
...except my leaving him.

1209
01:26:47,743 --> 01:26:52,407
'Don't forget'

1210
01:26:52,481 --> 01:26:53,983
Don't get nervous.

1211
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:56,779
Please. Let's come back.

1212
01:26:58,353 --> 01:27:01,584
Look at me, Mrs. Kane, darling.

1213
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:10,621
'Get the voice out of the throat
Place the tone right in the mask...

1214
01:27:16,839 --> 01:27:18,839
'Diaphragm'

1215
01:27:25,681 --> 01:27:27,945
You're out of pitch.

1216
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,814
Some people can sing. Some can't.

1217
01:27:34,957 --> 01:27:36,957
Impossible.

1218
01:27:37,459 --> 01:27:42,364
It's not your job to give your opinion
of Mrs. Kane's talents.

1219
01:27:42,464 --> 01:27:46,668
You're supposed to train her voice,
Signor Matiste. Nothing more.

1220
01:27:46,768 --> 01:27:48,504
Please continue with the lesson.

1221
01:27:48,604 --> 01:27:51,004
But, Mr. Kane.
- Please.

1222
01:27:52,007 --> 01:27:55,844
I'll be the laughingstock
of the musical world. People will think...

1223
01:27:55,944 --> 01:27:58,847
You're concerned what people will think?

1224
01:27:58,947 --> 01:28:04,153
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit.
I'm an authority on what people will think.

1225
01:28:04,253 --> 01:28:06,221
The newspapers for example.

1226
01:28:06,321 --> 01:28:08,991
I run several newspapers
between here and San Francisco.

1227
01:28:09,091 --> 01:28:10,692
It's all right, darling.

1228
01:28:10,792 --> 01:28:13,796
Signor Matiste is going to listen to reason.

1229
01:28:13,896 --> 01:28:17,041
How can I persuade you...
- You can't.

1230
01:28:42,891 --> 01:28:45,781
It's all right, darling, go ahead.

1231
01:28:56,838 --> 01:28:59,568
I thought you'd see it my way.

1232
01:29:09,851 --> 01:29:13,753
No, no, no.

1233
01:29:44,019 --> 01:29:47,546
'Ah. Cruel...

1234
01:29:48,857 --> 01:29:52,349
'Tu m'as trop entendue...

1235
01:29:53,495 --> 01:29:56,953
'Les Dieux m'en sont tmoins...

1236
01:29:57,466 --> 01:30:01,869
'Ces Dieux qui dans mon flanc...

1237
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:04,268
'Ont allum...

1238
01:30:04,439 --> 01:30:07,101
'Le feu fatal...

1239
01:30:07,542 --> 01:30:10,602
'A tout mon sang...

1240
01:30:30,599 --> 01:30:35,536
'Dites-moi comment j'expie...

1241
01:30:35,604 --> 01:30:38,835
'Ce pch si fort...

1242
01:30:40,909 --> 01:30:43,901
'Toujours remplie...

1243
01:30:43,945 --> 01:30:48,939
'Je ne peux pas rsister encore...

1244
01:30:52,387 --> 01:30:57,017
'Oh Dieux. Arrachez-moi...

1245
01:30:57,326 --> 01:30:59,794
'Ces feux fatals'

1246
01:30:59,861 --> 01:31:01,430
I think it's dreadful.

1247
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:06,058
'Allument ma mort...

1248
01:31:10,839 --> 01:31:15,538
'Voil mon cur...

1249
01:31:16,078 --> 01:31:20,947
'Voil mon cur...

1250
01:31:21,483 --> 01:31:25,476
'C'est I que ta main doit frapper...

1251
01:31:27,456 --> 01:31:30,425
'Voil mon cur...

1252
01:31:32,494 --> 01:31:34,792
'Frappe...

1253
01:31:35,964 --> 01:31:40,424
'Prte-moi ton pe...

1254
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:43,902
'Frappe'

1255
01:32:40,562 --> 01:32:43,265
Stop telling me he's your friend.

1256
01:32:43,365 --> 01:32:45,767
A friend don't write that kind of review.

1257
01:32:45,867 --> 01:32:49,237
All these other papers panning me,
I could expect that.

1258
01:32:49,337 --> 01:32:53,108
But for the Inquirer to run a thing like that,
spoiling my whole debut.

1259
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:53,942
Come in.

1260
01:32:54,042 --> 01:32:54,976
I'll get it.

1261
01:32:55,076 --> 01:32:58,080
Friend. Not the kind of friends I know...

1262
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:00,349
...but I'm not high class like you.

1263
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:02,517
And I never went to any swell schools.

1264
01:33:02,617 --> 01:33:03,985
That'll be enough, Susan.

1265
01:33:04,085 --> 01:33:05,821
From Mr. Leland, sir.

1266
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:09,191
He wanted me to make sure
you got this personally.

1267
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:11,919
Is that something from him?

1268
01:33:13,395 --> 01:33:15,395
Charlie.

1269
01:33:15,397 --> 01:33:19,334
As for you,
you ought to have your head examined.

1270
01:33:19,434 --> 01:33:21,970
Sending him a letter telling him he's fired...

1271
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:24,620
...with a $25,000 check in it.

1272
01:33:24,673 --> 01:33:27,818
What kind of firing do you call that?

1273
01:33:27,876 --> 01:33:32,108
You did send him a check for $25,000,
didn't you?

1274
01:33:33,415 --> 01:33:35,415
Yes.

1275
01:33:36,918 --> 01:33:40,115
I sent him a check for $25,000.

1276
01:33:42,757 --> 01:33:44,757
What's that?

1277
01:33:45,427 --> 01:33:46,895
Declaration of Principles.

1278
01:33:46,995 --> 01:33:48,730
What?

1279
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:50,830
What is it?

1280
01:33:55,737 --> 01:33:56,738
An antique.

1281
01:33:56,838 --> 01:33:59,602
You're awful funny, aren't you?

1282
01:34:00,675 --> 01:34:04,913
I'll tell you one thing you're not going
to be funny about, and that's my singing.

1283
01:34:05,013 --> 01:34:06,114
I'm through.

1284
01:34:06,214 --> 01:34:09,184
I never wanted to do it in the first place.

1285
01:34:09,284 --> 01:34:11,820
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.

1286
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,723
I don't propose
to have myself made ridiculous.

1287
01:34:14,823 --> 01:34:18,059
You don't propose
to have yourself made ridiculous.

1288
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:21,496
What about me?
I'm the one that has to sing.

1289
01:34:21,596 --> 01:34:23,532
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.

1290
01:34:23,632 --> 01:34:25,434
Why don't you leave me alone?

1291
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:27,235
My reasons satisfy me, Susan.

1292
01:34:27,335 --> 01:34:30,310
You seem unable to understand them.

1293
01:34:30,338 --> 01:34:33,228
I will not tell them to you again.

1294
01:34:36,244 --> 01:34:39,134
You'll continue with your singing.

1295
01:36:10,905 --> 01:36:12,905
Get Dr. Corey.

1296
01:36:17,145 --> 01:36:19,014
Susan.

1297
01:36:19,114 --> 01:36:23,789
She'll be perfectly all right
in a day or two, Mr. Kane.

1298
01:36:24,753 --> 01:36:29,190
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane
came to make such a foolish mistake.

1299
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:34,162
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her
was in a somewhat larger bottle.

1300
01:36:34,262 --> 01:36:38,733
The strain of preparing for the new opera
has excited and confused her.

1301
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:41,043
Yes, I'm sure that was it.

1302
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:44,706
No objections to my staying
with her are there?

1303
01:36:44,806 --> 01:36:49,056
No, not at all.
I'd like the nurse to be here, too.

1304
01:36:49,644 --> 01:36:51,805
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1305
01:37:27,282 --> 01:37:29,282
Charlie.

1306
01:37:31,619 --> 01:37:35,359
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.

1307
01:37:36,257 --> 01:37:40,337
But I couldn't go through
with the singing again.

1308
01:37:40,929 --> 01:37:45,179
You don't know what it means
to know that people...

1309
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:49,152
That the whole audience doesn't want you.

1310
01:37:52,073 --> 01:37:54,963
That's when you got to fight them.

1311
01:38:02,584 --> 01:38:04,584
All right.

1312
01:38:06,087 --> 01:38:09,232
You won't have to fight them anymore.

1313
01:38:11,826 --> 01:38:13,919
It's their loss.

1314
01:38:29,577 --> 01:38:31,577
What are you doing?

1315
01:38:35,784 --> 01:38:37,784
Jigsaw puzzles?

1316
01:38:42,924 --> 01:38:45,049
Charlie, what time is it?

1317
01:38:45,493 --> 01:38:47,062
11:30.

1318
01:38:47,162 --> 01:38:49,162
In New York?

1319
01:38:51,499 --> 01:38:54,474
I said what time is it in New York?

1320
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:58,298
11:30.
- Night?

1321
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:03,712
The Bulldog's just gone to press.

1322
01:39:03,812 --> 01:39:07,009
Well, hurray for the Bulldog.

1323
01:39:08,883 --> 01:39:12,649
Gee, 11:30. Shows are just getting up.

1324
01:39:12,787 --> 01:39:16,091
People are going to nightclubs
and restaurants.

1325
01:39:16,191 --> 01:39:19,594
Of course, we're different
because we live in a palace.

1326
01:39:19,694 --> 01:39:22,297
You always said you wanted
to live in a palace.

1327
01:39:22,397 --> 01:39:24,866
A person could go crazy in this dump.

1328
01:39:24,966 --> 01:39:28,876
Nobody to talk to,
nobody to have any fun with.

1329
01:39:29,537 --> 01:39:33,532
49,000 acres of nothing
but scenery and statues.

1330
01:39:33,641 --> 01:39:35,076
I'm lonesome.

1331
01:39:35,176 --> 01:39:39,080
Until yesterday, we've had no less
than 50 of your friends at any one time.

1332
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:41,883
I think if you look in the west wing...

1333
01:39:41,983 --> 01:39:45,053
...you'll probably find a dozen vacationists
still in residence.

1334
01:39:45,153 --> 01:39:48,043
You make a joke out of everything.

1335
01:39:48,256 --> 01:39:52,861
Charlie, I want to go to New York.
I'm tired of being a hostess.

1336
01:39:52,961 --> 01:39:56,829
I want to have fun. Please, Charlie.

1337
01:39:58,533 --> 01:40:01,366
Charlie, please.

1338
01:40:02,303 --> 01:40:04,965
Our home is here, Susan.

1339
01:40:10,712 --> 01:40:13,347
I don't care to visit New York.

1340
01:40:49,884 --> 01:40:51,884
What are you doing?

1341
01:40:54,622 --> 01:40:57,887
One thing I can never understand:

1342
01:40:57,992 --> 01:41:00,161
How do you know
you haven't done it before?

1343
01:41:00,261 --> 01:41:04,936
It makes a whole lot more sense
than collecting statues.

1344
01:41:05,867 --> 01:41:07,867
You may be right.

1345
01:41:07,869 --> 01:41:09,928
I sometimes wonder...

1346
01:41:10,338 --> 01:41:12,740
...but you get into the habit.

1347
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:16,044
It's not a habit, I do it because I like it.

1348
01:41:16,144 --> 01:41:19,714
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.

1349
01:41:21,115 --> 01:41:24,285
Invite everybody to spend the night
at the Everglades.

1350
01:41:24,385 --> 01:41:28,756
Invite everybody. Order everybody,
you mean, and make them sleep in tents.

1351
01:41:28,856 --> 01:41:31,793
Who wants to sleep in tents
when they've got their own room...

1352
01:41:31,893 --> 01:41:34,529
...with a bath, where they know
where everything is?

1353
01:41:34,629 --> 01:41:38,199
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.

1354
01:41:41,369 --> 01:41:45,703
You never give me anything
I really care about.

1355
01:41:54,248 --> 01:41:56,248
'It can't be love...

1356
01:41:58,653 --> 01:42:03,283
'For there is no true love...

1357
01:42:03,658 --> 01:42:06,127
'I know I've played at the game...

1358
01:42:06,227 --> 01:42:09,094
'Like a moth in a blue flame...

1359
01:42:09,163 --> 01:42:12,963
'Lost in the end, just the same...

1360
01:42:13,067 --> 01:42:15,592
'All these years...

1361
01:42:15,737 --> 01:42:20,640
'My heart's been floating around
in a puddle of tears...

1362
01:42:23,011 --> 01:42:25,011
'I wonder what it is'

1363
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:30,264
Sure, you give me things,
but that don't mean anything to you.

1364
01:42:31,552 --> 01:42:34,622
You're in a tent, darling,
you're not at home.

1365
01:42:34,722 --> 01:42:38,059
I can hear you very well
if you speak in a normal tone of voice.

1366
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:42,063
What's the difference between giving me
a bracelet or giving someone $100,000...

1367
01:42:42,163 --> 01:42:45,166
...for a statue you'll keep crated up
and never look at?

1368
01:42:45,266 --> 01:42:47,635
It's just money. It doesn't mean anything.

1369
01:42:47,735 --> 01:42:50,905
You never really gave me anything
that you care about.

1370
01:42:51,005 --> 01:42:52,807
I want you to stop this.

1371
01:42:52,907 --> 01:42:54,309
I'm not going to stop it.

1372
01:42:54,409 --> 01:42:56,678
You never gave me anything in your life.

1373
01:42:56,778 --> 01:43:01,028
You just tried to buy me
into giving you something.

1374
01:43:02,817 --> 01:43:06,753
'It can't be love'

1375
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,170
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.

1376
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:24,270
You don't love me.

1377
01:43:24,338 --> 01:43:26,274
You want me to love you.

1378
01:43:26,374 --> 01:43:29,309
Sure.'I'm Charles Foster Kane.

1379
01:43:29,377 --> 01:43:31,946
'Whatever you want,
just name it and it's yours.

1380
01:43:32,046 --> 01:43:34,310
'But you gotta love me.'

1381
01:43:38,786 --> 01:43:41,516
Don't tell me you're sorry.

1382
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:45,458
I'm not sorry.

1383
01:43:57,004 --> 01:43:59,004
Mr. Kane?

1384
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:02,185
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.

1385
01:44:04,679 --> 01:44:08,419
Marie has been packing for her
since morning.

1386
01:44:13,921 --> 01:44:18,092
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.
Tell him he can get the bags.

1387
01:44:18,192 --> 01:44:20,192
Yes, madame.

1388
01:44:21,462 --> 01:44:23,798
Have you gone completely crazy?

1389
01:44:23,898 --> 01:44:27,135
Don't you know that our guests,
that everyone will know about this?

1390
01:44:27,235 --> 01:44:29,037
Packed your bag, sent for the car...

1391
01:44:29,137 --> 01:44:30,405
And left you?

1392
01:44:30,505 --> 01:44:32,505
Of course they'll hear.

1393
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:36,210
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you.

1394
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:39,880
But I never imagined people wouldn't know.

1395
01:44:41,582 --> 01:44:43,582
I won't let you go.

1396
01:44:50,825 --> 01:44:52,825
Goodbye, Charlie.

1397
01:44:55,997 --> 01:44:57,997
Susan.

1398
01:45:07,608 --> 01:45:09,608
Please don't go.

1399
01:45:14,882 --> 01:45:16,882
Please, Susan.

1400
01:45:19,887 --> 01:45:23,324
From now on, everything will be
exactly the way you want it to be.

1401
01:45:23,424 --> 01:45:26,739
Not the way I think you want it, but...

1402
01:45:27,195 --> 01:45:29,195
...your way.

1403
01:45:35,203 --> 01:45:37,203
You mustn't go.

1404
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,933
You can't do this to me.

1405
01:45:43,678 --> 01:45:45,678
I see.

1406
01:45:46,214 --> 01:45:48,983
It's you that this is being done to.

1407
01:45:49,083 --> 01:45:51,083
It's not me at all.

1408
01:45:51,152 --> 01:45:53,192
Not what it means to me.

1409
01:45:55,223 --> 01:45:57,418
I can't do this to you?

1410
01:45:58,893 --> 01:46:00,893
Oh, yes, I can.

1411
01:46:19,947 --> 01:46:23,050
In case you haven't heard,
I lost all my money and it was plenty.

1412
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:25,486
The last 10 years
have been difficult for many.

1413
01:46:25,586 --> 01:46:29,023
They haven't been tough on me.
I just lost all my money.

1414
01:46:29,123 --> 01:46:32,293
You're going down to Xanadu?
- Monday, with boys from the office.

1415
01:46:32,393 --> 01:46:35,096
Mr. Rawlston wants
the whole place photographed.

1416
01:46:35,196 --> 01:46:36,797
We run a picture magazine.

1417
01:46:36,897 --> 01:46:40,601
If you're smart, you'll get in touch
with Raymond. He's the butler.

1418
01:46:40,701 --> 01:46:42,670
You'll learn a lot from him.

1419
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:45,339
He knows where all the bodies are buried.

1420
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:50,284
You know, all the same,
I feel kind of sorry for Mr. Kane.

1421
01:46:50,878 --> 01:46:52,878
Don't you think I do?

1422
01:46:57,118 --> 01:47:00,433
What do you know, it's morning already.

1423
01:47:03,591 --> 01:47:08,266
Come around and tell me the story
of your life sometime.

1424
01:47:14,168 --> 01:47:16,168
Rosebud?

1425
01:47:18,439 --> 01:47:20,819
I'll tell you about Rosebud.

1426
01:47:20,975 --> 01:47:23,355
How much is it worth to you?

1427
01:47:23,511 --> 01:47:25,511
$1,000?

1428
01:47:34,588 --> 01:47:37,478
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.

1429
01:47:37,992 --> 01:47:41,596
He acted funny sometimes, you know?
- No, I didn't.

1430
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:44,332
Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.

1431
01:47:44,432 --> 01:47:46,801
I've been working for him 11 years now...

1432
01:47:46,901 --> 01:47:51,005
...in charge of the whole place,
so I ought to know.

1433
01:47:51,105 --> 01:47:52,373
Rosebud.
- Yes.

1434
01:47:52,473 --> 01:47:57,445
Like I tell you, the old man
acted kind of funny sometimes...

1435
01:47:57,545 --> 01:48:01,215
...but I knew how to handle him...
- Need a lot of service?

1436
01:48:01,315 --> 01:48:04,341
But I knew how to handle him.

1437
01:48:04,518 --> 01:48:06,983
Like that time his wife left.

1438
01:50:21,922 --> 01:50:23,922
Rosebud.

1439
01:51:31,225 --> 01:51:33,225
I see.

1440
01:51:33,427 --> 01:51:36,742
And that's what you know about Rosebud?

1441
01:51:37,431 --> 01:51:40,367
I heard him say it that other time, too.

1442
01:51:40,467 --> 01:51:42,467
He just said:

1443
01:51:42,803 --> 01:51:44,605
'Rosebud.'

1444
01:51:44,705 --> 01:51:48,576
Then he dropped the glass ball
and it broke on the floor.

1445
01:51:48,676 --> 01:51:53,521
He didn't say anything after that,
and I knew he was dead.

1446
01:51:53,647 --> 01:51:56,317
He said all kinds of things
that didn't mean anything.

1447
01:51:56,417 --> 01:51:59,052
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1448
01:51:59,486 --> 01:52:02,156
Yes and no.
- That isn't worth $1,000.

1449
01:52:02,256 --> 01:52:05,392
You can keep on asking questions
if you want to.

1450
01:52:05,492 --> 01:52:07,532
We're leaving tonight...

1451
01:52:07,962 --> 01:52:09,897
...when we're through taking pictures.

1452
01:52:09,997 --> 01:52:11,932
Allow yourself plenty of time.

1453
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:16,837
The train stops at the junction on signal,
but they don't like to wait.

1454
01:52:16,937 --> 01:52:20,140
I can remember when they'd wait all day...

1455
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:22,240
...if Mr. Kane said so.

1456
01:52:23,344 --> 01:52:25,938
Better get going.

1457
01:52:28,949 --> 01:52:33,029
Can we come down?
- Yes, hurry up. We're leaving.

1458
01:52:35,089 --> 01:52:38,692
How much do you think
this is all worth, Mr. Thompson?

1459
01:52:38,792 --> 01:52:40,792
Millions.

1460
01:52:41,795 --> 01:52:42,930
If anybody wants it.

1461
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:45,733
Well, at least he brought all this stuff
to America.

1462
01:52:45,833 --> 01:52:47,535
What's that?
- Another Venus.

1463
01:52:47,635 --> 01:52:48,936
$25,000.

1464
01:52:49,036 --> 01:52:51,639
A lot of money to pay
for a dame without a head.

1465
01:52:51,739 --> 01:52:53,949
The banks are out of luck?

1466
01:52:55,409 --> 01:52:58,112
They'll clear all right.
- He never threw anything away.

1467
01:52:58,212 --> 01:53:03,384
'Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467
employees of the New York Inquirer.'

1468
01:53:03,484 --> 01:53:08,822
'One stove from the estate of Mary Kane,
Little Salem, Colorado. Value: $2.'

1469
01:53:08,922 --> 01:53:11,392
We're supposed to get everything,
junk as well as art.

1470
01:53:11,492 --> 01:53:13,160
He sure liked to collect things.

1471
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:14,695
Anything and everything.

1472
01:53:14,795 --> 01:53:16,430
A regular crow, eh?

1473
01:53:16,530 --> 01:53:19,233
Hey, look, a jigsaw puzzle.
- We got a lot of those.

1474
01:53:19,333 --> 01:53:22,803
A Burmese temple and three
Spanish ceilings down the hall.

1475
01:53:22,903 --> 01:53:24,305
Part of a Scotch castle...

1476
01:53:24,405 --> 01:53:26,473
...that needs to be unwrapped.

1477
01:53:26,573 --> 01:53:28,042
Put all this stuff together:

1478
01:53:28,142 --> 01:53:31,245
The palaces and the paintings,
and the toys and everything.

1479
01:53:31,345 --> 01:53:33,345
What would it spell?

1480
01:53:34,815 --> 01:53:37,620
Charles Foster Kane?
- Or Rosebud.

1481
01:53:37,851 --> 01:53:41,082
How about it, Jerry?
- What's Rosebud?

1482
01:53:41,155 --> 01:53:43,960
That's what he said when he died.

1483
01:53:44,058 --> 01:53:46,193
Did you ever find out what it means?

1484
01:53:46,293 --> 01:53:48,495
No, I didn't.
- What did you find out about him?

1485
01:53:48,595 --> 01:53:50,595
Not much, really.

1486
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:55,240
We'd better get started.

1487
01:53:56,870 --> 01:54:00,185
What have you been doing all this time?

1488
01:54:00,307 --> 01:54:01,875
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle.

1489
01:54:01,975 --> 01:54:05,746
If you'd discovered what Rosebud meant,
I bet it would've explained everything.

1490
01:54:05,846 --> 01:54:07,846
No, I don't think so.

1491
01:54:08,015 --> 01:54:09,450
No.

1492
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:13,120
He was a man who got
everything he wanted, and then lost it.

1493
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:16,890
Maybe Rosebud was something
he couldn't get or something he lost.

1494
01:54:16,990 --> 01:54:20,050
It wouldn't have explained anything.

1495
01:54:20,127 --> 01:54:24,122
I don't think any word
can explain a man's life.

1496
01:54:24,231 --> 01:54:28,821
No. I guess Rosebud is just a piece
in a jigsaw puzzle.

1497
01:54:29,603 --> 01:54:31,603
A missing piece.

1498
01:54:37,144 --> 01:54:39,339
Come on, everybody...

1499
01:54:41,148 --> 01:54:43,412
...we'll miss the train.

1500
01:55:48,115 --> 01:55:50,345
Throw that junk in.

1501
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:30,939
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

1502
01:57:31,618 --> 01:57:33,828
Everything was his idea...

1503
01:57:35,589 --> 01:57:37,714
...except my leaving him.

1504
01:57:38,492 --> 01:57:41,042
I've got his trunk all packed.

1505
01:57:41,795 --> 01:57:44,097
I've had it packed for a week now.

1506
01:57:44,197 --> 01:57:48,872
Sometimes I think I'd prefer
a rival of flesh and blood.

1507
01:57:49,403 --> 01:57:52,718
You're gonna need more than one lesson.

1508
01:57:53,073 --> 01:57:56,133
And you'll get more than one lesson.

1509
01:58:00,814 --> 01:58:02,449
Who's a busy man, me?

1510
01:58:02,549 --> 01:58:05,953
I'm chairman of the board.
I got nothing but time.

1511
01:58:06,053 --> 01:58:07,454
What do you want to know?

1512
01:58:07,554 --> 01:58:12,593
We thought... If we could find out what he
meant by his last words as he was dying...

1513
01:58:12,693 --> 01:58:15,328
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1514
01:58:16,229 --> 01:58:17,631
Yes and no.

1515
01:58:17,731 --> 01:58:20,834
'I think it would be fun to run a newspaper.'

1516
01:58:20,934 --> 01:58:24,759
'I think it would be fun to run a newspaper.'
