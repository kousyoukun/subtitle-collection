1
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,900
Rosebud.

2
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,600
News on the March.

3
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,300
{y:i}Legendary was the Xanadu...

4
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,800
{y:i}...where Kubla Khan decreed
{y:i}his stately pleasure dome.

5
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,200
{y:i}Today almost as legendary
{y:i}as Florida's Xanadu...

6
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,500
{y:i}...the world's largest
{y:i}private pleasure ground.

7
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,300
{y:i}Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast,
{y:i}a private mountain...

8
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,300
{y:i}...was commissioned and successfully built.

9
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,800
{y:i}One hundred thousand trees,
{y:i}twenty thousand tons of marble...

10
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,400
{y:i}...are the ingredients
{y:i}of Xanadu's mountain.

11
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,700
{y:i}Contents of Xanadu痴 palace:

12
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,800
{y:i}Paintings, pictures, statues,
{y:i}various stones of other palaces.

13
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
{y:i}A collection of everything.

14
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,200
{y:i}So big it can never
{y:i}be catalogued or appraised.

15
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,900
{y:i}Enough for 10 museums,
{y:i}the loot of the world.

16
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,300
{y:i}Xanadu's livestock...

17
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,600
{y:i}...the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea,
{y:i}the beast of the field and jungle...

18
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,900
{y:i}...two of each,
{y:i}the biggest private zoo since Noah.

19
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,300
{y:i}Like the Pharaohs...

20
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,300
{y:i}...Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones
{y:i}to mark his grave.

21
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,300
{y:i}Since the Pyramids...

22
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,100
{y:i}...Xanadu is the costliest monument...

23
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,500
{y:i}...a man has built to himself.

24
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,500
{y:i}Here in Xanadu last week...

25
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,700
{y:i}...Xanadu's landlord was laid to rest.

26
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,600
{y:i}A potent figure of our century...

27
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,800
{y:i}...America's Kubla Khan:

28
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,000
{y:i}Charles Foster Kane.

29
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,100
{y:i}Its humble beginnings,
{y:i}in this ramshackle building, a dying daily.

30
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,700
{y:i}Kane's empire, in its glory...

31
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,700
{y:i}...held dominion over 37 newspapers,
{y:i}two syndicates...

32
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,300
{y:i}...a radio network,
{y:i}an empire upon an empire.

33
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,300
{y:i}The first of grocery stores, paper mills...

34
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,900
{y:i}...apartment buildings,
{y:i}factories, forests, ocean liners.

35
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,200
{y:i}An empire through which for 50 years...

36
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,600
{y:i}...flowed in an unending stream...

37
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,900
{y:i}...the wealth of the Earth's
{y:i}third richest gold mine.

38
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,300
{y:i}Famed in American legend
{y:i}is the origin of the Kane fortune.

39
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,800
{y:i}How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane,
{y:i}by a defaulting boarder, in 1868...

40
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,500
{y:i}...was left the supposedly worthless deed
{y:i}to an abandoned mineshaft:

41
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,600
{y:i}The Colorado Lode.

42
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,700
{y:i}Fifty-seven years later,
{y:i}before a congressional investigation...

43
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,100
{y:i}... Walter P. Thatcher,
{y:i}grand old man of Wall Street...

44
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,700
{y:i}...for years chief target
{y:i}of Kane papers' attacks on trusts...

45
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,100
{y:i}...recalls a journey he made as a youth.

46
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,500
My firm had been appointed trustee
by Mrs. Kane...

47
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,700
...for a large fortune she recently acquired.

48
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,700
It was her wish that I take charge
of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.

49
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,400
Chief, is it not, that on this occasion,
Charles Foster Kane...

50
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,100
...personally attacked you after striking you
in the stomach with a sled?

51
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,400
I shall read to the committee
a prepared statement...

52
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,700
...which I have brought with me,
and then refuse to answer questions.

53
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,400
Mr. Charles Foster Kane,
in every essence of his social beliefs...

54
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,300
...and by the dangerous manner
he has persistently attacked...

55
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,600
...American traditions of private property...

56
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,900
...initiative and opportunity
for advancement...

57
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,700
...is, in fact, nothing more or less
than a communist.

58
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,200
{y:i}That same month in Union Square....

59
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,900
{y:i}The words "Charles Foster Kane"...

60
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,300
{y:i}...are a menace
{y:i}to every workingman in this land.

61
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,800
{y:i}He is today what he has always been
{y:i}and always will be: a fascist.

62
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,000
{y:i}And still another opinion....

63
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,700
{y:i}Kane urged his country's entry
{y:i}into one war...

64
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,400
{y:i}...opposed participation in another.

65
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,300
{y:i}Won the election
{y:i}to one American president at least.

66
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,000
{y:i}Spoke for millions of Americans.

67
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,400
{y:i}Was hated by as many more.

68
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,100
{y:i}For 40 years appeared in Kane newsprint...

69
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,500
{y:i}...no public issue
{y:i}on which Kane papers took no stand.

70
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,100
{y:i}No public man whom Kane himself
{y:i}did not support or denounce.

71
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,000
{y:i}Often support, then denounce.

72
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,300
{y:i}Twice married, twice divorced.

73
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,800
{y:i}First to a president's niece...

74
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,800
{y:i}...Emily Norton, who left him in 1916.

75
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,800
{y:i}Died 1918 in a motor accident
{y:i}with their son.

76
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,400
{y:i}Sixteen years after his first marriage...

77
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,700
{y:i}...two weeks after his first divorce...

78
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,000
{y:i}...Kane married Susan Alexander...

79
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
{y:i}...singer, at the Town Hall
{y:i}in Trenton, New Jersey.

80
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,000
{y:i}For wife two,
{y:i}one-time opera-singing Susan Alexander...

81
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,300
{y:i}...Kane built
{y:i}Chicago's Municipal Opera House.

82
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,700
{y:i}Cost: $3 million.

83
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,700
{y:i}Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane,
{y:i}half-finished before she divorced him...

84
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,700
{y:i}...the still unfinished...

85
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,200
{y:i}...Xanadu.

86
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,400
{y:i}Cost: No man can say.

87
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,700
{y:i}Kane, molder of mass opinion
{y:i}though he was...

88
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,500
{y:i}...in all his life
{y:i}was never granted elective office...

89
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,200
{y:i}...by the voters of his country.

90
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,900
{y:i}But Kane papers were once strong indeed...

91
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,400
{y:i}...and once the prize seemed almost his.

92
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,000
{y:i}In 1916, as independent candidate
{y:i}for governor...

93
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,400
{y:i}...the best elements of the state
{y:i}behind him...

94
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,100
{y:i}...the White House seemingly the next
{y:i}easy step in a lightning political career...

95
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,900
{y:i}...then suddenly, less than one week
{y:i}before election...

96
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,900
{y:i}...defeat.

97
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,100
{y:i}Shameful, ignominious.

98
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,100
{y:i}Defeat that set back for 20 years
{y:i}the cause of reform in the U.S...

99
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,800
{y:i}...forever cancelled political chances
{y:i}for Charles Foster Kane.

100
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,700
{y:i}Then, in the first year
{y:i}of the Great Depression...

101
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,300
{y:i}...a Kane paper closes.

102
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,000
{y:i}For Kane, in four short years, collapse.

103
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,400
{y:i}Eleven Kane papers merged,
{y:i}more sold, scrapped.

104
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Is that correct?

105
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't believe everything you hear
on the radio.

106
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,900
{y:i}-Read the Inquirer.
-How were business conditions in Europe?

107
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,700
How did I find business conditions
in Europe, Mr. Bones?

108
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,500
With great difficulty.

109
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,500
Are you glad to be back?

110
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm always glad to be back.
I'm an American.

111
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,300
Always been an American. Anything else?

112
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,300
When I was a reporter,
we asked them quicker than that.

113
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,800
What do you think
of the chances for war in Europe?

114
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,000
I talked with the responsible leaders
of England, France, Germany and Italy.

115
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,500
They're too intelligent
to embark on a project...

116
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,900
...that would mean the end of civilization.

117
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,500
You can take my word for it,
there will be no war.

118
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,200
{y:i}Kane helped to change the world...

119
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,900
{y:i}...but Kane's world now is history...

120
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,300
{y:i}...and the great yellow journalist himself
{y:i}lived to be history...

121
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,600
{y:i}...outlived his power to make it.

122
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,300
{y:i}Alone in his never-finished,
{y:i}already decaying pleasure palace...

123
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,800
{y:i}...aloof, seldom visited,
{y:i}never photographed...

124
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,900
{y:i}...an emperor of newsprint
{y:i}continued to direct his failing empire.

125
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,200
{y:i}Vainly attempted to sway, as he once did...

126
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,800
{y:i}...the destinies of a nation
{y:i}that had ceased to listen to him...

127
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,500
{y:i}...ceased to trust him.

128
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,300
{y:i}Then last week, as it must to all men...

129
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,700
{y:i}...death came to Charles Foster Kane.

130
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,500
News on the March.

131
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,600
That's it.

132
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,100
Stand by.
I'll tell you if we want to run it again.

133
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,700
-How about it, Mr. Rawlston?
-How do you like it, boys?

134
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,500
-Seventy years in a man's life.
-That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.

135
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,900
It's a good short,
but what it needs is an angle.

136
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
All we saw on that screen
was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.

137
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,300
I know that. I read the papers.

138
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,700
It isn't enough to tell us what a man did...

139
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,100
...you've got to tell us who he was.

140
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,300
Wait a minute.
What were Kane's last words?

141
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,200
Do you remember, boys?

142
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,700
What were the last words
he said on Earth?

143
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,700
Maybe he told us about himself
on his deathbed.

144
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,800
-Maybe he didn't.
-All we saw was a big American.

145
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,700
How did he differ from Ford,
Hearst or John Doe?

146
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,300
I tell you, a man's dying words--

147
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,300
What were they?
You don't read the papers.

148
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,800
When Charles Foster Kane died,
he said one word:

149
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,800
"Rosebud."

150
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,600
That's all he said? Tough guy.

151
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,900
Yes, "Rosebud." Just that one word.

152
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
-But who is she?
-What was it?

153
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
Here's a man
who could've been president...

154
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,200
...who was as loved,
hated and talked about...

155
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,700
...as any man in our time,
but when he dies...

156
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,000
...something is on his mind called Rosebud.

157
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,400
-What does that mean?
-A racehorse he bet on once.

158
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,700
-That didn't come in.
-But what was the race?

159
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,900
Rosebud.

160
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,800
-Thompson.
-Yes.

161
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,700
Hold this up a week, two if you must.

162
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,500
Don't you think right after he's dead--

163
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Find out about Rosebud. Get in touch
with anybody who knew him...

164
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,100
...or knew him well.

165
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,000
That manager of his....

166
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,400
Bernstein. His second wife.
She's still living.

167
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,700
Susan Alexander Kane.

168
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,500
-She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.
-That's right.

169
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,900
See them all. Get in touch with everybody
that ever worked for him...

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,700
...whoever loved him,
whoever hated his guts.

171
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,900
I don't mean go through
the city directory of course.

172
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,500
I'll get on it right away.

173
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,200
Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.

174
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,500
It will probably turn out to be
a very simple thing.

175
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,800
Miss Alexander.

176
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,100
This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.

177
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,500
I want another drink, John.

178
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,100
Right away.
Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?

179
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,500
-I'll have a highball, please.
-Who told you you could sit down?

180
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,200
I thought maybe we could have a talk.

181
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,700
Think again.

182
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,100
Can't you people leave me alone?

183
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,300
I'm minding my own business,
you mind yours.

184
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,200
If I could just have a talk with you,
Miss Alexander. I'd--

185
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,700
Get out of here.

186
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,700
Get out!

187
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,400
-Sorry.
-Get out.

188
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,100
-Maybe some other time.
-Get out.

189
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,700
Gino.

190
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,200
Get her another highball.

191
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,100
She just won't talk to nobody,
Mr. Thompson.

192
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Okay.

193
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,900
-Another double?
-Yeah.

194
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,500
Hello, I want New York City.

195
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,900
Courtland 79970.
This is Atlantic City 46827. All right.

196
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,300
She's....

197
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,600
She'll snap out of it.

198
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,900
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon
talk about Mr. Kane as any--

199
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,300
-Hello.
-Sooner.

200
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,900
This is Thompson. Let me talk to the chief.

201
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,600
Mr. Rawlston? She won't talk.

202
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,500
The second Mrs. Kane.
About Rosebud or anything else.

203
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,300
I'm calling from Atlantic City.

204
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,900
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia,
to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.

205
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,300
They're expecting me.

206
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,700
Then I've a meeting with his
general manager in New York. Bernstein.

207
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,200
Then I'm coming back here.

208
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,100
Yeah, I'll see everybody that's still alive.
Goodbye.

209
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,900
-Hey....
-John.

210
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,800
You just might be able to help me.

211
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,400
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane,
did she ever mention Rosebud?

212
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,200
"Rosebud"?

213
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,500
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.

214
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,900
As a matter of fact, just the other day,
when the papers were full of it...

215
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
...l asked her.

216
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,900
She never heard of Rosebud.

217
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,900
The directors of the Thatcher Memorial
Library have asked me to remind you...

218
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,700
...about the conditions
under which you may...

219
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,700
...inspect certain portions
of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.

220
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,300
-l remember them.
-Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.

221
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,900
-All I want is an hour--
-Under no circumstances...

222
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,500
...are direct quotes from his manuscript
to be used by you. You may follow me.

223
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,700
That's all right. I'm just looking for--

224
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,500
Jennings.

225
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,700
Thank you, Jennings.

226
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,500
You will be required to leave this room
at 4:30 promptly.

227
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,200
You will confine yourself,
it is our understanding...

228
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,700
...to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's
manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.

229
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,500
That's all I'm interested in.

230
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,700
Thank you.

231
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,800
Pages 83 to 142.

232
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,400
Come on, boys.

233
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,800
Be careful, Charles.

234
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,800
Mrs. Kane.

235
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,900
Pull your muffler around your neck,
Charles.

236
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,200
Mrs. Kane,
I think we'll have to tell him now.

237
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,600
Yes, I'll sign those papers now,
Mr. Thatcher.

238
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,900
You people seem to forget
that I'm the boy's father.

239
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,800
It's going to be done
exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.

240
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,500
There's nothing wrong with Colorado.
I don't see why we can't raise our son...

241
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,300
...just 'cause we came into money.

242
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,200
If I want to, I can go to court.
A father has a right to.

243
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,400
A boarder that beats his bill
and leaves worthless stock behind....

244
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,300
That property is as much my property
as anybody's...

245
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,200
...now that it's valuable.
And if Fred Graves had any idea...

246
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,700
...this would happen, he'd have made out
the certificates in both our names.

247
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,100
-But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.
-He owed the money to both of us.

248
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,800
-"The bank's decision in all matters--"
-l don't hold with giving Charles to a bank--

249
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,000
-Stop this nonsense.
-We're a bit uneducated--

250
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
"The bank's decision
concerning his education...

251
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,600
"...his places of residence, is to be final."

252
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,100
-The idea of a bank being the guardian--
-Stop this nonsense, Jim.

253
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,900
"We will assume full management
of the Colorado Lode"...

254
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,500
...which I repeat, Mrs. Kane,
you are the sole owner.

255
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,700
-Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
-Right here.

256
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,100
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.

257
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,200
You'd think I hadn't been
a good husband or father--

258
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,800
The sum of $50,000 a year...

259
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,900
...is to be paid to you
and Mr. Kane as long as you both live...

260
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,100
...and thereafter to the survivor.

261
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,400
-Let's hope it's all for the best.
-It is.

262
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,500
Why I can't raise my own boy
is more than I can understand.

263
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,400
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

264
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Everything else, the principal,
as well as all monies earned...

265
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,500
...is to be administered by the bank in trust
for your son, Charles Foster Kane...

266
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,200
...until he reaches his 25th birthday,
at which time...

267
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,400
...he is to come into complete possession.

268
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,700
Charles!

269
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,300
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

270
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,800
It's almost 5:00.
Don't you think I'd better meet the boy?

271
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,500
I've got his trunk all packed.

272
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,700
I've had it packed for a week now.

273
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,500
I've arranged for a tutor
to meet us in Chicago.

274
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,800
I'd have brought him here with me, but....

275
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,200
-Charles.
-Look, Mom.

276
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,700
You'd better come inside.

277
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,700
-That's quite a snowman.
-l took the pipe out of his mouth.

278
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,200
Did you make it yourself?.

279
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,700
Maybe I'll make some teeth and whiskers.

280
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,900
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

281
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
-Hello.
-How do you do, Charles?

282
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,900
He comes from the East.

283
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,400
-Pa.
-Hello, Charlie.

284
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,700
Charles.

285
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,700
Yes, Mommy.

286
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,100
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you
on a trip with him tonight.

287
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,900
You'll be leaving on number 10.

288
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,100
That's the train with all the lights on it.

289
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,100
You going, Mom?

290
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,300
No. Your mother won't be going
right away, but she'll....

291
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,600
Where am I going?

292
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,300
You're going to see Chicago and New York
and Washington, maybe. Ain't he?

293
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,500
He certainly is.

294
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,900
I wish I were a boy going on a trip
like that for the first time.

295
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,100
-Why aren't you coming with us, Mom?
-We have to stay here, Charles.

296
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,900
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher
from now on, Charlie.

297
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,300
You're gonna be rich. Your ma figures,
well, that is...

298
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
...me and her decided this ain't the place
for you to grow up in.

299
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,900
You'll probably be
the richest man someday...

300
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,300
-...and you ought to get--
-You won't be lonely.

301
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,700
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have
fine times together, we are.

302
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,600
Let's shake hands. Come.
I'm not that frightening, am l?

303
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,100
-What do you say? Let's shake.
-Why, Charles.

304
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,900
-Why, you almost hurt me.
-Charlie!

305
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,400
Sleds aren't to hit people,
but to sleigh with.

306
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,400
Mom!

307
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,700
-You got to go.
-Jim!

308
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,700
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.

309
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,600
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.

310
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,400
-That's what you think, is it?
-Yes.

311
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,600
That's why he's going to be brought up
where you can't get at him.

312
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,800
Well, Charles...

313
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,200
-...Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

314
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,700
And a happy New Year.

315
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
In closing...

316
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,800
...may I remind you your 25th birthday,
which is now approaching...

317
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,500
...marks your complete independence
from the firm...

318
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,900
...of Thatcher & Company,
as well as acquiring the full responsibility...

319
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,300
...for the world's sixth largest
private fortune.

320
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,400
-Got that?
-"The world's sixth largest private fortune."

321
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,500
I don't think you realize the full importance
of the position you are to occupy.

322
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,700
I am therefore enclosing
for your consideration...

323
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,300
...a list of your holdings,
extensively cross-indexed.

324
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,500
-"Dear Mr. Thatcher."
-It's from Mr. Kane.

325
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,900
-Go on.
-"Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...

326
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,900
"...oil wells, shipping or real estate."

327
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
Not interested?

328
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,600
"One item on your list intrigues me:
{y:i}The New York Inquirer.

329
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,400
"A little newspaper we acquired
in a foreclosure proceeding.

330

to run a newspaper.

332
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,300
"l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."

333

"Traction Trust exposed."

334
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,500

"Wall Street backs copper swindle."

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
"Copper robbers indicted."

340
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,000
"Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast."

341
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,600
Is that really your idea
of how to run a newspaper?

342
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,900
I don't know how to run a newspaper.
I try everything I can think of.

343
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,900
You know there's not
the slightest proof this...

344
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,700
-...Armada's off the Jersey Coast.
-Hello, Mr. Bernstein.

345
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,200
Can you prove it isn't?

346
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,900
Mr. Bernstein,
I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.

347
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,700
-Mr. Leland.
-Hello.

348
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,500
Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.

349
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,500
We have no secrets from our readers.
Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.

350
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,300
He knows what's wrong with every copy
{y:i}of the Inquirer since I took over. Read.

351
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,300
"Girls delightful in Cuba. Stop.
Could send you prose poems...

352
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,000
"...about scenery but don't feel right
spending your money. Stop.

353
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,800
"There is no war in Cuba."
Signed "Wheeler." Any answer?

354
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,200
Yes. Dear Wheeler: You provide
the prose poems, I'll provide the war.

355
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,900
-That's fine.
-l like it myself. Send it right away.

356
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,300
I came to see you
about this campaign of yours.

357
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,100
{y:i}The Inquirer's campaign against
the Public Transit Company.

358
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,300
Do you know anything
we can use against them?

359
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,900
You're still the college boy, eh?

360
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,500
I was expelled from college, a lot
of colleges, you remember? I remember.

361
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,300
I think I should remind you of a fact
you have forgotten.

362
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,000
You're one of the largest stockholders
in the Public Transit Company.

363
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,000
The trouble is, you don't realize
you're talking to two people.

364
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,100
As Charles Foster Kane
who owns 82,364 shares...

365
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,900
...of Public Transit Preferred. See,
I do have a general idea of my holdings.

366
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,300
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel...

367
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,600
...his paper should be closed,
a committee formed to boycott him.

368
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,300
If you can form such a committee,
put me down for a contribution of $1,000.

369
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,100
On the other hand,
{y:i}I am the publisher of the Inquirer.

370
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,100
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in
on a little secret. It is also my pleasure...

371
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,300
...to see that the working people of this
community aren't robbed by a pack...

372
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,800
...of money-mad pirates, just because...

373
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,300
...they have no one
to look after their interests.

374
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,500
I'll let you in on another little secret,
Mr. Thatcher:

375
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,300
I think I'm the man to do it.
You see, I have money and property.

376
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,200
If I don't look after the interests
of the underprivileged, somebody else will.

377
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,300
Maybe somebody
without money or property.

378
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,600
That would be too bad.

379
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,700
I saw your financial statement today.

380
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,600
-Oh, did you?
-Tell me, honestly...

381
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,900
...don't you think it's rather unwise
to continue this philanthropic enterprise...

382
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,900
{y:i}...this Inquirer, that is costing you
$1 million a year?

383
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,600
Yes. I did lose $1 million last year.
I expect to lose $1 million this year.

384
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,300
I expect to lose $1 million next year.

385
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,500
At the rate of $1 million a year...

386
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,000
...I値l have to close this place in 60 years.

387
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,700
"With respect to the said newspapers...

388
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,100
"...the said Charles Foster Kane...

389
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,700
"...hereby relinquishes all control thereof...

390
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,700
"...and of the syndicates
pertaining thereto...

391
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,600
"...and any and all other newspaper, press
and publishing properties of any kind...

392
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,300
"...and agrees to abandon
all claim thereto--"

393
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,600
-Which means we're bust all right.
-Well, out of cash.

394
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,200
All right, Mr. Bernstein.

395
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,600
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher,
just let me sign it and go home.

396
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,900
You're too old
to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

397
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,900
You're too old to be called anything else.

398
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,100
You were always too old.

399
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,300
"In consideration thereof,
Thatcher & Company agrees...

400
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,000
"...to pay to Charles Foster Kane,
as long as he lives--"

401
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,700
My allowance.

402
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,500
"You will continue to maintain
over your newspapers a large...

403
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,100
"...measure of control.
Measure of control."

404
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,700
And we shall seek your advice.

405
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,900
This depression is temporary.

406
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,700
There's always the chance
that you'll die richer than I will.

407
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,200
It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.

408
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,700
We never lost as much as we made.

409
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,100
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles...

410
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:35,200
...you never made a single investment.
You always used money to....

411
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,800
To buy things.

412
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,100
To buy things.

413
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,800
My mother should have chosen
a less reliable banker.

414
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,900
I always gagged on that silver spoon.

415
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,800
You know, Mr. Bernstein...

416
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,000
...if I hadn't been very rich...

417
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,800
...l might have been a really great man.

418
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,900
Don't you think you are?

419
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,900
I think I did pretty well
under the circumstances.

420
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,000
What would you like to have been?

421
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,900
Everything you hate.

422
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,100
I beg your pardon, sir? What did you say?

423
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,900
-It痴 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings?
-Yes, ma'am.

424
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,400
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege,
young man.

425
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,400
-Did you find what you were looking for?
-No.

426
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,700
-You're not Rosebud, are you?
-What?

427
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,700
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings,
isn't it?

428
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,100
Goodbye, everybody.
Thanks for the use of the hall.

429
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,200
Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.

430
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,600
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know?

431
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,700
We thought maybe.... If we could
find out what he meant by his last words...

432
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,200
-...as he was dying.
-That "Rosebud"?

433
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,700
Maybe some girl?

434
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,900
There were a lot of them in the early days.

435
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,100
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane
could have met someone casually...

436
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,300
...and then 50 years later, on his deathbed--

437
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,000
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.

438
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,600
A fellow will remember a lot of things
you wouldn't think he'd remember.

439
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,400
You take me.

440
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,300
One day, back in 1896,
I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry...

441
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,600
...and as we pulled out,
there was another ferry pulling in...

442
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,300
...and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off.

443
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,800
A white dress she had on.

444
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,300
She was carrying a white parasol.

445
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,900
I only saw her for one second.

446
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,300
She didn't see me at all,
but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since...

447
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,600
...that I haven't thought of that girl.

448
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,100
-Who else have you been to see?
-Well, I went down to Atlantic City.

449
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,000
Susie?

450
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,400
Thank you.

451
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,700
I called her myself the day after he died.

452
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,300
I thought maybe somebody ought to.

453
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,700
-She couldn't even come to the phone.
-I値l be seeing her again in a couple of days.

454
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,700
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.

455
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,400
If you'd talk about anything connected
with Mr. Kane that you can remember.

456
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,300
You were with him from the beginning.

457
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,600
From before the beginning, young fellow.
And now it's after the end.

458
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,800
Have you tried to see anybody
except Susie?

459
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,100
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've
been through Walter Thatcher's journal.

460
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,400
-That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
-He made an awful lot of money.

461
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,200
Well, it's no trick to make a lot of money...

462
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,700
...if all you want is to make a lot of money.

463
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,300
You take Mr. Kane.
It wasn't money he wanted.

464
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,500
Thatcher never did figure him out.
Sometimes even I couldn't.

465
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,900
You know who you ought to see?
Mr. Leland.

466
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,000
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend.
They went to school together.

467
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,200
Harvard?

468
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,800
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Cornell, Switzerland.

469
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,400
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.

470
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,100
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.

471
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,300
One of those families
where the father is worth $10 million...

472
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,500
...then one day he shoots himself,
and it turns out there's nothing but debts.

473
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,300
He was with Mr. Kane and me...

474
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,100
...the first day Mr. Kane took over
{y:i}the Inquirer.

475
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,800
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.

476
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,800
It's going to look a lot different
one of these days. Come on.

477
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,300
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint.
That's a newspaper building.

478
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,000
You're getting paid, mister,
for opinions or for hauling?

479
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,500
-Jedediah.
-After you, Mr. Kane.

480
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,300
Excuse me, sir, but l....

481
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,500
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

482
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,100
{y:i}Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.

483
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,300
I am Herbert Carter, the editor-in-chief.

484
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,200
-Thank you, Mr. Carter. This is Mr. Leland--
-How do you do, Mr. Leland?

485
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,100
Our new dramatic critic.
I hope I haven't made a mistake.

486
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,300
-It is dramatic critic, right?
-That's right.

487
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,800
-Are they standing for me?
-You? Oh, Mr. Kane.

488
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,100
Standing?

489
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,700
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

490
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,100
I thought it would be a nice little gesture.

491
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,100
-Ask them to sit down, will you, please.
-The new publisher.

492
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,400
-You may resume your duties, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

493
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,700
-l didn't know your plans.
-l don't know my plans myself.

494
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,200
-Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans.
-No?

495
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,200
Except to get out a newspaper.

496
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,500
-Mr. Bernstein.
-Yes, Mr. Kane.

497
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,900
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.

498
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,700
-Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
-How do you do, Mr. Carter?

499
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,600
-Mr. Carter.
-How do you do?

500
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,800
-Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
-Stein.

501
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,400
-Kane.
-Mr. Carter, is this your office?

502
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,500
My little private sanctum
is at your disposal.

503
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,800
-Excuse me.
-But I don't think I understand.

504
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,000
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here
in your office as long as I have to.

505
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,000
Live here? Yes?

506
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,900
-Excuse me.
-But a morning newspaper, after all--

507
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,800
Excuse me.

508
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,600
We're practically closed for 12 hours a day.

509
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,900
That's one of the things
that's going to have to be changed here.

510
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,300
-The news goes on for 24 hours a day.
-24?

511
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,700
-That's right.
-Excuse me.

512
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,400
It's impossible....

513
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,300
I've drawn that cartoon.
I'm no good as a cartoonist.

514
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,900
You certainly aren't.

515
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,700
You're the dramatic critic, Leland.

516
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,700
-You still eating?
-I知 still hungry.

517
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,100
{y:i}Here's a front-page story in the Chronicle...

518
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,200
...about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone
in Brooklyn who's missing.

519
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,700
She's probably murdered. Why isn't
{y:i}there something about it in the Inquirer?

520
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,500
We're running a newspaper...

521
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,400
-I知 absolutely starving to death.
-...not a scandal sheet.

522
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,400
That's all right.

523
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,300
Mr. Carter, here is a three-column headline
{y:i}in the Chronicle.

524
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,800
{y:i}Why hasn't the Inquirer
a three-column headline?

525
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,300
The news wasn't big enough.

526
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,900
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough,
it makes the news big enough.

527
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,500
-That's right!
-The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone--

528
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,700
There's no proof
that she was murdered, or dead.

529
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,500
It says she's missing.
The neighbors are getting suspicious.

530
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,300
It's not our function
to report the gossip of housewives.

531
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,500
If we were interested in that kind of thing,
we could fill the paper twice over, daily.

532
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,800
That's the kind of thing we are going to be
interested in from now on.

533
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,700
I want you to send your best man
to see Mr. Silverstone.

534
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,500
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't
produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone...

535
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
{y:i}...the Inquirer will have him arrested.

536
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,000
Tell Mr. Silverstone
he's a detective from....

537
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,500
-Central Office.
-The Central Office.

538
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,100
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious
and asks to see your man's badge...

539
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,900
...your man is to get indignant
and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.

540
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,200
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear.
You ready for dinner, Jedediah?

541
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,400
I can't see that the function
of a respectable newspaper--

542
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter. Goodbye.

543
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,300
Goodbye.

544
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,700
Paper! Read all about it!

545
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,700
Read all about it
{y:i}in the early morning Chronicle.

546
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,100
The mystery of the lady
that vanished in Brooklyn.

547
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,900
Read all about it
{y:i}in the early morning Chronicle.

548
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,500
We'll be on the street soon,
Charlie, another 10 minutes.

549
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,200
Three hours and 50 minutes late,
but we did it.

550
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,800
-Tired?
-A tough day.

551
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,400
-A wasted day.
-Wasted?

552
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,300
You only made the paper over
four times tonight, that's all.

553
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,900
I've changed the front page a little,
Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough.

554
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,000
There's something I've got to get into
this paper besides pictures and print.

555
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,500
{y:i}I've got to make the New York Inquirer
as important to New York...

556
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,400
...as the gas in that light.

557
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,700
What are you going to do, Charlie?

558
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,800
My Declaration of Principles.
Don't smile, Jedediah.

559
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,600
I've got it all written out here.

560
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,000
You don't want to make any promises
you don't want to keep.

561
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,700
These'll be kept.

562
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,900
"I値l provide the people of this city...

563
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,700
"...with a daily paper
that will tell all the news honestly.

564
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,100
-"l will also provide--"
-That's two sentences starting with "l."

565
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,700
People will know who's responsible...

566
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,600
{y:i}...and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer,
quickly, simply and entertainingly.

567
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,900
No special interests will be allowed
to interfere with that truth.

568
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,700
"l will also provide them with a fighting
and tireless champion of their rights...

569
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,300
"...as citizens and as human beings."

570
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,200
Signed:

571
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,100
"Charles Foster Kane."

572
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,500
-Can I have that, Charlie?
-I知 going to print it.

573
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,000
Solly!

574
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,000
Yes, Mr. Kane?

575
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,800
I want you to run this editorial
in a box on the front page.

576
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,300
This morning's front page?

577
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,300
That's right, Solly,
that means we'll have to remake again.

578
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,100
-Yes.
-Go down and tell them.

579
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,500
All right.

580
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,300
When you're through with that,
I'd like to have it back.

581
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,100
I'd like to keep that particular
piece of paper myself.

582
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,100
I have a hunch it might turn out
to be something pretty important.

583
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,400
-A document...
-Sure.

584
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,800
...like the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution...

585
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,000
...and my first report card at school.

586
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,300
I know you're tired, gentlemen,
but I brought you here for a reason.

587
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,900
-This little pilgrimage will do us good.
{y:i}-The Chronicle's a good newspaper.

588
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,900
{y:i}Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper.
Notice the circulation.

589
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,700
495,000.
{y:i}But look who's working for the Chronicle.

590
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,800
-With them, it's no trick to get circulation.
-You're right.

591
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
{y:i}You know how long it took the Chronicle
to get that staff together?

592
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,900
-Twenty years.
-Twenty years?

593
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,300
Six years ago, I looked at a picture
of the world's greatest newspaper men.

594
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,500
I felt like a kid in front of a candy store.

595
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,400
Tonight, six years later,
I got my candy, all of it.

596
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,800
{y:i}Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.

597
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,900
Make an extra copy of that picture
{y:i}and mail it to the Chronicle.

598
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,700
It'll make you all happy to learn
that our circulation this morning...

599
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,400
...was the greatest in New York: 684,000.

600
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,700
684,132.

601
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,100
Right.

602
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,100
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness
in taking leave of you.

603
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,600
I'm going abroad next week for a vacation.

604
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,100
I've promised my doctor for sometime
that I would leave when I could.

605
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,000
I now realize I can't.

606
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,100
Say, Mr. Kane,
as long as you're promising...

607
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,900
...there's a lot of pictures and statues
in Europe you ain't bought yet.

608
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,900
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.

609
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,900
They've been making statues
for 2,000 years.

610
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,900
And I've only been buying for five.

611
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,500
-Promise me, Mr. Kane.
-l promise, Mr. Bernstein.

612
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,300
-Thank you.
-Mr. Bernstein?

613
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,500
You don't expect me to keep
any of those promises, do you?

614
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
And now, gentlemen!

615
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,400
Your complete attention, if you please.

616
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,000
Are we going to declare war on Spain?

617
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,900
Oh, mama, here they come.
Shoot me while I'm happy.

618
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,900
I said, "Are we going to declare
war on Spain, or are we not?"

619
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,700
{y:i}The Inquirer already has.

620
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,700
You long-faced, overdressed anarchist.

621
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,600
I'm not overdressed.

622
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,800
You are, too.
Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.

623
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,900
Let's have the song about Charlie.

624
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,300
-Is there a song about Charlie?
-Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?

625
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,500
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town,
you get a song written about you.

626
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,200
I've seen that fellow. He's good.

627
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,700
Good evening, Mr. Kane.

628
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,600
"There is a man, a certain man

629
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,000
"And for the poor you may be sure
that he'll do all he can

630
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,500
"Who is this one? This favorite son

631
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,300
"Just by his action
has the traction magnates on the run

632
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,600
"Who loves to smoke, enjoys a joke

633
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,700
"Who wouldn't get a bit upset
if he were really broke

634
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,900
"With wealth and fame he's still the same

635
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,300
"I値l bet you $5 you're not alive
if you don't know his name

636
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,300
"What is his name?

637
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,800
"It痴 Charlie Kane, it's Mister Kane!

638
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,500
"He doesn't like that Mister
He likes good old Charlie Kane"

639
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,500
-isn稚 it wonderful? Such a party.
-Yes.

640
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,200
What's the matter?

641
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,500
"Who says a miss was made to kiss

642
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,700
"And when he meets one
always tries to do exactly this

643
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,700
"Who buys the food, who buys the drinks

644
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,100
"Who thinks that dough was made
to spend and acts the way he thinks

645
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,700
"Now is it, Joe, no, no, no"

646
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,000
Bernstein, these men
{y:i}who are now with the Inquirer...

647
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,700
{y:i}...who were with the Chronicle
until yesterday--

648
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,300
Oh, mama, please.

649
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,900
-Give me that.
-What? The blonde?

650
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,400
-No, the brunette.
-Where did you learn that, Charlie?

651
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,700
Bernstein, these men
{y:i}who were with the Chronicle...

652
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,700
...weren't they just as devoted
{y:i}to the Chronicle policy...

653
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,000
...as they are now to our policies?

654
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,700
Sure, they're just like anybody else.

655
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,900
They got work to do, they do it.

656
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,000
Only they happen to be
the best men in the business.

657
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,200
Do we stand for the same things
{y:i}the Chronicle stands for?

658
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,100
Certainly not.

659
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,900
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed
to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

660
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,700
There's always a chance, of course,
that they'll change Mr. Kane.

661
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,700
Without his knowing it.

662
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,500
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane!

663
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,400
-l got a cable here from Mr. Kane.
-What?

664
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,300
-From Paris, France.
-What?

665
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,300
-From Paris, France.
-Come on in.

666
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,900
"Who by his action
has the traction magnates on the run"

667
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:41,100
It's a good thing he promised
not to send back any more statues.

668
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,000
Look, he wants to buy
the world's biggest diamond.

669
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,500
Why didn't you go to Europe with him?
He wanted you to.

670
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,200
I wanted Charlie to have fun,
with me along....

671
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,400
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?

672
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,000
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?
Am I a New England schoolmarm?

673
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,000
Yes.

674
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,600
If you thought I'd answer you different
from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.

675
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,100
"World's biggest diamond."

676
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,400
I didn't know Charlie
was collecting diamonds.

677
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,900
He ain't.

678
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,100
He's collecting somebody
that's collecting diamonds.

679
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,500
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.

680
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane...

681
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,100
"...from 467 employees
{y:i}of the New York Inquirer."

682
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,700
Here he comes!

683
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,300
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

684
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,800
-l know I've a moustache.
-It looks awful.

685
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,300
Have we got a society editor?

686
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,200
-Right here, Mr. Kane.
-Miss Townsend is the society editor.

687
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,900
Miss Townsend,
this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane.

688
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,900
Miss Townsend, I've been away so long.
I don't know your routine.

689
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,100
I got a little social announcement.

690
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,900
I wish you wouldn't treat this
any differently than you would any other...

691
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,700
...social announcement.

692
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,300
Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees
{y:i}of the Inquirer--

693
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,700
Mr. Bernstein,
thank you very much, everybody, l....

694
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,500
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.

695
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,100
Goodbye.

696
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,900
Say, he was in an awful hurry.

697
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,800
Hey, everybody, look out here.

698
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,800
Let's go to the window.

699
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,800
-Mr. Leland! Mr. Bernstein!
-Yes, Ms. Townsend?

700
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,600
This announcement:
"Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton...

701
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,100
"...announce the engagement
of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...

702
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,900
"...to Mr. Charles Foster Kane."

703
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,400
Come on.

704
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,500
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece
of the President of the United States.

705
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,500
President's niece?

706
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,000
Before he's through,
she'll be a president's wife.

707
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,300
The way things turned out,
I don't need to tell you.

708
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,900
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.

709
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,100
It didn't end very well, did it?

710
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,700
It ended.

711
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,100
Then there was Susie. That ended, too.

712
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,800
You know, Mr. Thompson, I was thinking...

713
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,400
...this Rosebud
you're trying to find out about....

714
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,900
Yes?

715
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,400
Maybe that was something he lost.

716
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,500
Mr. Kane was a man who lost
almost everything he had.

717
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,300
You ought to see Jed Leland.

718
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,400
Of course, he and Mr. Kane
didn't exactly see eye to eye.

719
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,400
You take the Spanish-American war.

720
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,700
I guess Mr. Leland was right.
That was Mr. Kane's war.

721
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,600
We didn't really have anything
to fight about.

722
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,800
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war
of Mr. Kane's...

723
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,700
...we'd have the Panama Canal?

724
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,800
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.

725
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,400
A lot of the time now
they don't tell me these things.

726
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,400
Maybe even he's dead.

727
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,100
In case you'd like to know...

728
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,100
...he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital
on 180th Street.

729
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,600
You don't say. I had--

730
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,400
Nothing particular the matter with him,
they tell me, just....

731
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,000
Just old age.

732
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,900
It's the only disease that you don't
look forward to being cured of.

733
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,300
I can remember absolutely everything,
young man.

734
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,600
That's my curse.

735
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:37,100
That's one of the greatest curses
ever inflicted on the human race: memory.

736
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,600
I was his oldest friend, and as far as
I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.

737
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,800
Not that Charlie was ever brutal.
He just did brutal things.

738
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,600
Maybe I wasn't his friend,
but if I wasn't, he never had one.

739
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,300
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

740
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,700
You were about to say something
about Rosebud.

741
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,900
Do you happen to have a good cigar?

742
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,700
I've got a young physician here
who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.

743
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,900
No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sorry.

744
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,900
I changed the subject, didn't l?

745
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,300
What a disagreeable old man
I have become.

746
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,900
You're a reporter and you want to know
what I think about Charlie Kane.

747
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,600
I suppose he had some private sort
of greatness.

748
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,300
But he kept it to himself.

749
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,200
He never gave himself away.
He never gave anything away.

750
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,100
He just left you a tip.

751
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,900
He had a generous mind.

752
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I don't suppose anybody
ever had so many opinions.

753
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,900
But he never believed in anything
except Charlie Kane.

754
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,500
He never had a conviction
except Charlie Kane in his life.

755
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,900
I suppose he died without one.

756
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,500
That must have been pretty unpleasant.

757
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,300
Of course, a lot of us check out without
having any special convictions about death.

758
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,500
But we do know what we're leaving.
We do believe in something.

759
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,100
Are you absolutely sure
you haven't got a cigar?

760
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,100
-Sorry, Mr. Leland.
-Never mind.

761
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,700
-What do you know about Rosebud?
-"Rosebud"?

762
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,700
His dying words: "Rosebud."

763
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,100
{y:i}I saw that in the Inquirer.

764
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,900
I never believed anything
{y:i}I saw in the Inquirer.

765
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,300
Anything else?

766
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,900
I can tell you about Emily.
I went to dancing school with Emily.

767
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,000
I was very graceful.

768
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,200
-We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane.
-What was she like?

769
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,700
She was like all the girls I knew
in dancing school.

770
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,700
Very nice girl. Emily was a little nicer.

771
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,100
After the first couple of months...

772
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:38,300
...she and Charlie didn't see much
of each other except at breakfast.

773
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,400
It was a marriage
just like any other marriage.

774
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,900
-You're beautiful.
-l can't be.

775
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,600
Yes, you are. You're very beautiful.

776
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,100
I've never been to six parties
in one night before.

777
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,000
-I've never been up this late.
-It痴 a matter of habit.

778
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,900
-What will the servants think?
-That we enjoyed ourselves.

779
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,400
Why do you have to go straight off
to the newspaper?

780
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,100
You never should've married a
newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.

781
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,800
I absolutely adore you.

782
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,400
Charles, even newspapermen
have to sleep.

783
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,100
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him
put off my appointments till noon.

784
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,400
What time is it?

785
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,600
I don't know. It's late.

786
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,800
It's early.

787
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,500
Charles....

788
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,900
Do you know how long
you kept me waiting last night...

789
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,700
...when you went to the newspaper
for 10 minutes?

790
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,000
What do you do in a newspaper
in the middle of the night?

791
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:44,900
My dear, your only correspondent
{y:i}is the Inquirer.

792
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,700
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival
of flesh and blood.

793
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,200
I don't spend that much time
on the newspaper.

794
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,200
It isn't just the time.
It's what you print, attacking the President.

795
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,400
-You mean Uncle John.
-l mean the President of the United States.

796
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,800
He's still Uncle John
and a well-meaning fathead...

797
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,100
...who's letting a pack of high-pressure
crooks run his administration.

798
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,900
-This whole oil scandal--
-He happens to be the President, not you.

799
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,600
That's a mistake that will be corrected
one of these days.

800
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:14,700
Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior
the most incredible atrocity yesterday.

801
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,300
I simply can't have it in the nursery.

802
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,500
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit
to the nursery now and then.

803
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,100
Does he have to?

804
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,100
Yes.

805
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,400
-Really, Charles, people will think--
-What I tell them to think.

806
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,400
Wasn't he ever in love with her?

807
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,300
He married for love.

808
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,500
Love.

809
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,700
That is why he did everything.

810
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,700
That's why he went into politics.
It seems we weren't enough.

811
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,700
He wanted all the voters to love him, too.

812
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,700
All he wanted out of life was love.

813
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,600
That's Charlie's story. How he lost it.

814
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,900
You see, he just didn't have any to give.

815
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,500
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.

816
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,500
Very dearly.

817
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,300
And his mother,
I guess he always loved her.

818
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,300
-How about his second wife?
-Susan Alexander?

819
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,100
You know what Charlie called her?

820
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,000
The day after he'd met her,
he told me about her.

821
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:35,900
He said she was
"a cross-section of the American public."

822
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,500
I guess he couldn't help it.
She must have had something for him.

823
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,300
That first night, according to Charlie...

824
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,500
...all she had was a toothache.

825
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,700
What are you laughing at, young lady?

826
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,200
-What's the matter with you?
-Toothache.

827
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,900
-What?
-Toothache.

828
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,300
Toothache?

829
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,500
You mean you've got a toothache.

830
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,200
-What's funny about that?
-You're funny, mister.

831
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,700
-You've got dirt on your face.
-Not dirt, it's mud.

832
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,000
Do you want some hot water?
I live right here.

833
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,000
What's that, young lady?

834
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,500
I said, if you wanted some hot water...

835
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,800
...l could get you some...hot water.

836
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,500
All right, thank you very much.

837
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,100
Do I look any better now?

838
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,700
-This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
-What you need is to get your mind off it.

839
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,700
Excuse me, but my landlady
prefers me to keep this door open...

840
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,800
-...when I have a gentleman caller.
-All right.

841
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,900
You have got a toothache, haven't you?

842
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,900
-l surely have.
-Why don't you try laughing at me again?

843
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,900
-What?
-I知 still pretty funny.

844
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,400
I know, but you don't want me
to laugh at you.

845
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,500
I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.

846
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,800
Look at me.

847
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,300
See that?

848
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,600
What are you doing?

849
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,100
I'm wiggling both my ears
at the same time.

850
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,900
That's it, smile.

851
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,100
It took me two solid years at the best
boys' school in the world to learn that.

852
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,300
The fellow who taught me
is now president of Venezuela.

853
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,500
That's it!

854
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,600
-Is it a giraffe?
-No, not a giraffe.

855
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,500
-l bet it is.
-What?

856
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,600
Well, then it's an elephant.

857
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,300
-It痴 supposed to be a rooster.
-A rooster!

858
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,500
You know an awful lot of tricks.
Are you a professional magician?

859
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,100
-No, I'm not a magician.
-l was just joking.

860
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,700
You really don't know who I am?

861
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,800
You told me your name, Mr. Kane,
but I'm awfully ignorant.

862
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,100
I guess you caught on to that.
I bet I've heard your name a million times.

863
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,300
You really like me, though,
even though you don't know who I am?

864
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,700
I surely do. You've been wonderful.

865
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,300
Without you I don't know
what I would have done.

866
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,600
I had a toothache,
and I don't know many people.

867
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,700
I know too many people.

868
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,100
I guess we're both lonely.

869
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,200
Want to know what I was going to do
before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?

870
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,400
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.
You probably have more.

871
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,600
I was just joking.

872
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,000
I was on my way
to the Western Manhattan Warehouse...

873
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,000
...in search of my youth.

874
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,500
You see, my mother died a long time ago.
Her things were put in storage out West.

875
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,900
There wasn't any other place to put them.

876
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,900
I thought I'd send for them now.
Tonight I was going to take a look at them.

877
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,100
A sort of sentimental journey.

878
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,800
I run a couple of newspapers.
What do you do?

879
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,800
Me?

880
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,200
-How old did you say you were?
-l didn't say.

881
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,900
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.

882
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,200
-How old?
-Pretty old.

883
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,300
-How old?
-Twenty-two in August.

884
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,300
That's a ripe old age. What do you do?

885
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,700
I work at Seligman's.
I'm in charge of the sheet music.

886
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,300
-Is that what you want to do?
-No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.

887
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,500
-That is, I didn't. My mother did for me.
-What happened to the singing?

888
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,400
Mother always thought, she always talked
about grand opera for me.

889
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,700
Imagine.

890
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:00,000
But my voice isn't that kind.
It's just, you know what mothers are like.

891
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,900
Yes.

892
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,500
-Have you got a piano?
-A piano?

893
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,200
Yes, there's one in the parlor.

894
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,200
-Would you sing for me?
-You wouldn't want to hear me sing.

895
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,600
Yes, I would.

896
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,500
Don't tell me
your toothache is bothering you.

897
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,200
No, that's all gone.

898
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,700
All right.

899
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,400
Let's go to the parlor.

900
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:32,000
"Yes, Lindor shall be mine

901
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,700
"l have sworn it

902
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,300
"For weal or woe

903
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,900
"Yes, Lindor

904
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,600
{y:i}"Lo giurai

905
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,700
{y:i}"La vincer?

906
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,800
There is only one man
who can rid the politics...

907
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,000
...of this state of the evil domination
of Boss Jim Gettys.

908
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,800
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane,
the fighting liberal...

909
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,300
...the friend of the workingman,
the next governor of this state...

910
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,500
...who entered upon this campaign....

911
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,500
{y:i}...with one purpose only:

912
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,700
{y:i}To point out
{y:i}and make public the dishonesty...

913
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,600
{y:i}...the downright villainy
{y:i}of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine...

914
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,000
{y:i}...now in complete control
{y:i}of the government of this state.

915
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,100
{y:i}I made no campaign promises...

916
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:47,000
{y:i}...because, until a few weeks ago,
{y:i}I had no hope of being elected.

917
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,500
{y:i}Now, however, l have something more
{y:i}than a hope.

918
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,100
{y:i}Jim Gettys has something less
{y:i}than a chance.

919
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,100
{y:i}Every straw vote...

920
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:08,900
{y:i}...every independent poll shows
{y:i}that l will be elected.

921
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,000
{y:i}Very well.

922
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,800
{y:i}Now l can afford to make some promises.

923
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,700
{y:i}The workingman and the slum child...

924
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,700
{y:i}...know they can expect
{y:i}my best efforts in their interests.

925
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,200
{y:i}The decent, ordinary citizens know
{y:i}that I値l do everything in my power...

926
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:40,300
{y:i}...to protect the underprivileged,
{y:i}the underpaid, and the underfed.

927
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,200
-Mother, is Pop governor yet?
-Not yet, Junior.

928
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,200
{y:i}I'd make my promises now...

929
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,800
{y:i}...if I weren't too busy
{y:i}arranging to keep them.

930
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,100
{y:i}But here's one promise I値l make...

931
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,100
{y:i}...and Boss Jim Gettys knows I値l keep it.

932
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,000
{y:i}My first official act
{y:i}as governor of this state...

933
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:18,100
{y:i}...will be to appoint a special district
{y:i}attorney to arrange for the indictment...

934
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:23,800
{y:i}...prosecution and conviction
{y:i}of Boss Jim W. Gettys.

935
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,000
If the election were held today,
you'd be in by 100,000 votes.

936
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,900
-Gettys isn't even pretending.
-Pop.

937
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,000
-Hello, son.
-He isn't just scared, he's sick.

938
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,800
It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys
I mean what I say.

939
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,100
-Did you like your old man's speech?
-l could hear every word.

940
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,700
-Hello, Emily.
-Hold it.

941
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,900
-Great speech, Mr. Kane.
-Wonderful.

942
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,100
Will you get us a taxi?

943
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,300
I'm sending Junior home
in the car with Oliver.

944
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,200
Good night, Father.

945
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,300
Goodbye, son.

946
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,800
Why did you send Junior home in the car?
What are you doing in a taxi?

947
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,000
There's a call I want you to make with me.

948
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,900
-It can wait.
-No, it can't.

949
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,600
What's this all about, Emily?

950
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,800
It may not be about anything at all.
I intend to find out.

951
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,800
-Where are you going?
-I知 going to "185 West 74th Street."

952
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,100
If you wish, you may come with me.

953
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,500
I'll come with you.

954
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,800
I had no idea you had this flair
for melodrama, Emily.

955
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,300
Come right in, Mr. Kane.

956
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,700
Charlie.

957
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:27,100
He forced me to send your wife that letter.
I didn't want to.

958
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,900
He's been saying the most terrible....

959
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,600
Mrs. Kane.

960
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,900
I don't suppose
anybody would introduce us.

961
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,800
I'm Jim Gettys.

962
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,500
Yes?

963
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,200
I made Miss Alexander send you the note,
Mrs. Kane.

964
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,500
She didn't want to at first. But she did it.

965
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,200
Charlie, the things he said to me....
He threatened to--

966
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,000
I won't wait until I'm elected.
To start with, I think I'll break your neck.

967
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,700
Maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't.

968
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,700
Your breaking this man's neck
would scarcely explain this note:

969
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,300
"Serious consequences for Mr. Kane,
for yourself and for your son."

970
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,300
-He wanted to get her to come here--
-What does this note mean?

971
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,900
I'm Susan Alexander.
I know what you're thinking--

972
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,600
-What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander?
-She don't know.

973
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,400
She sent it because I told her
it wouldn't be smart not to.

974
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,700
-Emily, this gentleman--
-I知 not a gentleman.

975
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,600
Your husband is only trying to be funny
calling me one.

976
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,200
I don't even know what a gentleman is.

977
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,300
You see, my idea of a gentleman....

978
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,700
If I owned a paper and didn't like
the way somebody was doing things...

979
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,100
...some politician,
I'd fight him with all I had.

980
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,900
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit...

981
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,200
...so his family could see his picture
in the paper.

982
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:54,100
-You're a cheap, crooked grafter--
-We're talking now about what you are.

983
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,700
I'm fighting for my life,
not just my political life.

984
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,800
-He said unless you--
-That's what I said.

985
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,700
Here's the chance I'm willing to give him.
It's more of a chance than he'd give me.

986
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:08,400
Unless he decides by tomorrow that
he's so sick he has to go away for a year...

987
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,600
...Monday morning, all papers in the state,
except his, will carry the story I'll give.

988
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,000
What story?

989
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,800
-The story about him and Ms. Alexander.
-There isn't any story!

990
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,000
Shut up.

991
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,100
We've got evidence that would look bad
in the headlines.

992
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,700
Do you want me to give you the evidence?

993
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,500
I'd rather he withdrew
without having the story published.

994
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,500
Not that I care about him,
but I'd be better off that way.

995
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,300
So would you, Mrs. Kane.

996
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,700
What about me?

997
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,300
He said my name would be dragged
through the mud. That everywhere I went--

998
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,100
There seems to be only one decision
you can make, Charles.

999
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,700
I'd say that it'd been made for you.

1000
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,300
You can't tell me the voters of this state--

1001
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,300
I'm not interested in the voters
of this state right now.

1002
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,700
I am interested in our son.

1003
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,800
-Charlie, if they publish this story--
-They won't.

1004
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,100
Good night, Mr. Gettys.

1005
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,700
Are you coming, Charles?

1006
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,100
No.

1007
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,900
I'm staying here.

1008
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,900
I can fight this all alone.

1009
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,500
If you don't listen to reason,
it may be too late.

1010
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,400
Too late? For what?

1011
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,600
For you and this public thief...

1012
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,100
...to take the love of the people
away from me?

1013
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,900
You got other things to think about.
Your little boy.

1014
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,300
You don't want him to read about you
in the papers.

1015
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,700
There's only one person in the world
to decide what I'll do. And that's me.

1016
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,900
You decided what you were going to do,
Charles, some time ago.

1017
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,400
You're making a bigger fool of yourself
than I thought.

1018
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,700
-I致e got nothing to say to you.
-You're licked--

1019
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:15,100
Get out. If you want to see me,
have the warden write me a letter.

1020
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:19,800
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going
to happen to you would be a lesson to you.

1021
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,600
Only you're going to need
more than one lesson.

1022
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,300
-And you'll get more than one lesson.
-Don't worry about me, Gettys.

1023
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,900
Don't worry about me!

1024
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,200
I'm Charles Foster Kane!

1025
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,900
I'm no cheap, crooked politician
trying to save himself...

1026
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,900
...from the consequences of his crimes!

1027
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:46,700
Gettys! I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.

1028
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,900
Sing Sing, Gettys.

1029
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
-Have you a car, Mrs. Kane?
-Yes, thank you.

1030
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,100
-Good night.
-Good night.

1031
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:12,300
{y:i}Paper. Read all about it. Extra, extra.

1032
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,700
-Paper?
-No, thanks.

1033
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,700
With a million majority
already against him...

1034
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,100
...and the church counties
still to be heard from...

1035
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,600
...I知 afraid we got no choice.

1036
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,100
This one?

1037
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,100
That one.

1038
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,200
Good night again.

1039
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:26,200
-Is there anything I can--
-No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.

1040
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,000
You better go home and get some sleep.

1041
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,500
You, too.

1042
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,500
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1043
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,100
-Hello, Jedediah.
-I知 drunk.

1044
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:11,500
If you've got drunk to talk to me about...

1045
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,400
...Ms. Alexander, don't bother.

1046
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,900
I'm not interested.

1047
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:27,600
I've set back the sacred cause of reform,
is that it?

1048
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,400
All right.

1049
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,200
If that's the way they want it,
the people have made their choice.

1050
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,000
It's obvious the people prefer
Jim Gettys to me.

1051
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,600
You talk about the people
as though you owned them.

1052
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,900
As though they belong to you. Goodness.

1053
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,200
As long as I can remember, you've talked
about giving the people their rights...

1054
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:52,500
...as if you could make them
a present of liberty...

1055
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,000
...as a reward for services rendered.

1056
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,400
-Jed.
-You remember the workingman?

1057
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,600
I'll get drunk, too, Jedediah...

1058
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,300
...if it'll do any good.

1059
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:06,600
It won't do any good.
Besides you never get drunk.

1060
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,500
You used to write an awful lot
about the workingman--

1061
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,400
Go on home.

1062
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,200
He's turning into something called
"organized labor."

1063
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,100
You won't like that one little bit
when you find out...

1064
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:23,100
...it means your workingman expects
something as his right, and not your gift.

1065
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:29,400
When your precious underprivileged
really get together....

1066
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,700
Oh, boy....

1067
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,300
That'll add up to something
bigger than your privilege...

1068
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,300
...then I don't know what you'll do.

1069
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:43,400
Sail away to a desert island probably
and lord it over the monkeys.

1070
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,700
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

1071
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:51,700
There'll probably be a few of them there
to tell me when I do something wrong.

1072
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,900
You may not always be so lucky.

1073
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,100
You're not very drunk.

1074
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,100
Drunk, what do you care?

1075
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,300
You don't care about anything except you.

1076
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:07,900
You persuade people that you love them
so much that they ought to love you back.

1077
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,700
Only you want love on your own terms.

1078
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,700
It's something to be played your way,
according to your rules.

1079
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,100
-Let me work on the Chicago paper.
-What?

1080
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:30,000
You said you were looking for someone
to do dramatic "crimitism," criticism.

1081
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,900
I am drunk.

1082
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:36,200
I want to go to Chicago.

1083
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,100
You're too valuable here.

1084
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:45,100
-There's nothing left for me to do--
-All right, you can go to Chicago.

1085
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,400
Thank you.

1086
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,900
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.

1087
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,900
I warn you, Jedediah,
you won't like Chicago.

1088
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:58,400
The wind comes off the lake, and they've
probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.

1089
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,600
Will Saturday after next be all right?

1090
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,500
-Anytime you say.
-Thank you.

1091
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,800
A toast to love on my terms.
Those are the only terms anybody knows:

1092
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,500
His own.

1093
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,300
{y:i}Mr. Kane, I'm from the Inquirer.

1094
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,000
-What's that, young man?
-Are you through with politics?

1095
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,700
Am I through with politics?
I would say vice versa.

1096
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,700
We're going to be an opera star.

1097
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,500
Are you singing at the Metropolitan?

1098
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,900
We certainly are.

1099
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,800
Charlie said if I didn't,
he'd build me an opera house.

1100
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,300
That won't be necessary.

1101
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,200
No, no, no!

1102
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,800
Places, please!

1103
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,600
Mr. Leland is writing it
from the dramatic angle?

1104
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:30,000
-And we've covered it from the news end.
-And the social.

1105
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,900
How about the music notice?

1106
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,900
Yes, it's already made up.

1107
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,500
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.

1108
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
-Enthusiastic?
-Yes, sir.

1109
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,700
Mr. Kane. This is a surprise.

1110
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,100
We've got two spreads of pictures.

1111
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,900
The music notice on the front page?

1112
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,500
But there's still one notice to come.
The dramatic.

1113
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,100
The dramatic notice.

1114
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:03,500
-Mr. Bernstein, that's Mr. Leland, isn't it?
-Yes, we're waiting for it.

1115
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,200
-Where is he?
-Right in there, Mr. Kane.

1116
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,200
Mr. Kane.

1117
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,000
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane...

1118
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:40,200
...haven't spoken together for years.

1119
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,300
-You don't suppose--
-There's nothing to suppose.

1120
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,700
Excuse me.

1121
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,500
Close the door.

1122
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,100
He ain't been drinking before.

1123
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Never. We would have heard.

1124
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,200
What does it say there?

1125
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,200
The notice, what's he written?

1126
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:28,600
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty
but hopelessly incompetent amateur...

1127
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,700
"...last night opened
the new Chicago Opera House...

1128
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,700
"...in a performance of...."

1129
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:44,100
I still can't pronounce that name.

1130
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:51,200
"Her singing, happily,
is no concern of this department.

1131
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,400
"Of her acting,
it is absolutely impossible to...."

1132
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,100
Go on.

1133
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,400
That's all there is.

1134
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,400
Of her acting it is absolutely
impossible to say anything except...

1135
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,900
...that, in the opinion of this reviewer,
it represents a new low.

1136
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,900
-In the opinion of this reviewer.
-l didn't see that.

1137
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,200
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein, I'm dictating it.

1138
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:30,100
-Mr. Kane, l--
-Get me a typewriter.

1139
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,800
I'm going to finish Mr. Leland's notice.

1140
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,000
Hello, Bernstein.

1141
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:00,100
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Leland.

1142
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,400
Where's my notice, Bernstein?
I've got to finish my notice.

1143
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,600
-Mr. Kane is finishing it for you.
-Charlie?

1144
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,600
Charlie out there?

1145
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,600
I guess he's fixing it up.

1146
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,300
I knew I'd never get that through.

1147
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:30,900
Mr. Kane's finishing your review
just the way you started it.

1148
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:34,900
He's writing a bad notice
like you wanted it to be.

1149
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:39,200
I guess that'll show you.

1150
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,900
Hello, Jedediah.

1151
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,400
Hello, Charlie.

1152
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:13,700
I didn't know we were speaking.

1153
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,100
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.

1154
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,200
You're fired.

1155
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,300
{y:i}Everybody knows that story, Mr. Leland,
{y:i}but why did he do it?

1156
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,800
-How could a man write a notice--
-You just don't know Charlie.

1157
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:44,700
He thought that by finishing that notice
he'd show me he was an honest man.

1158
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,900
He was always trying to prove something.

1159
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
That whole thing about Susie
being an opera singer.

1160
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,200
That was trying to prove something.

1161
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,200
You know what the headline was
the day before the election?

1162
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:02,300
"Candidate Kane found
{y:i}in love nest with 'singer."'

1163
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,400
He was going to take
the quotes off the singer.

1164
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,600
Hey, nurse!

1165
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:09,500
Five years ago he wrote
from that place down there in the South.

1166
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:16,900
What's it called, Shangri-la? EI Dorado?
Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?

1167
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:22,300
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.

1168
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:26,300
You caught on, didn't you?
I'm not that hard to see through.

1169
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,000
Well, I never even answered his letter.

1170
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,100
Maybe I should have.

1171
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:35,000
I guess he was pretty lonely down there
in that coliseum all those years.

1172
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,400
He hadn't finished it when she left him.
He never finished it.

1173
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,600
He never finished anything
except my notice.

1174
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:45,000
-Of course, he built the joint for her.
-That must have been love.

1175
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,000
I don't know.

1176
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,500
He was disappointed in the world
so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.

1177
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,700
It was something bigger
than an opera house anyway.

1178
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,100
-Nurse.
-Yes, Mr. Leland.

1179
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,500
I'm coming.

1180
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,300
-There's one thing you can do for me.
-Sure.

1181
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,900
Stop at the cigar store on your way out,
and get me a couple of good cigars.

1182
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
-Be glad to.
-Thank you.

1183
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,800
One is enough.

1184
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,400
When I was a young man, there was
an impression that nurses were pretty.

1185
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,500
Well, it was no truer then than it is today.

1186
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,600
-I値l take your arm.
-All right.

1187
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:21,300
-You won't forget about those cigars?
-l won't.

1188
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:26,200
Have them wrapped like toothpaste,
or they'll stop them at the desk.

1189
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,100
You know that young doctor
I was telling you about, well...

1190
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:32,900
...he's got an idea
he wants to keep me alive.

1191
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:04,800
I'd rather you'd just talk.
Anything that comes into your mind...

1192
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,600
...about yourself and Mr. Kane.

1193
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,900
You don't want to hear what comes into
my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.

1194
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:19,000
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung
for Charlie that first time I met him.

1195
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,000
But I did an awful lot of singing after that.

1196
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,500
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.

1197
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,000
-The teachers got that, I didn't.
-What did you get?

1198
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:34,500
I didn't get a thing, except music lessons.
That's all there was in it.

1199
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,000
He married you, didn't he?

1200
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:39,400
He didn't mention anything about marriage
until after it was over and...

1201
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,700
...until it got in the papers about us...

1202
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:46,500
...and he lost the election,
and that Norton woman divorced him.

1203
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,700
He was really interested in my voice.

1204
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,300
Why did he build that opera house?

1205
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:54,100
I didn't want it. I didn't want a thing.
It was his idea.

1206
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,400
Everything was his idea...

1207
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,200
...except my leaving him.

1208
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:14,300
"Don't forget"

1209
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,800
Don't get nervous.

1210
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:18,500
Please. Let's come back.

1211
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,100
Look at me, Mrs. Kane, darling.

1212
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:31,800
"Get the voice out of the throat
Place the tone right in the mask

1213
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,000
"Diaphragm"

1214
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,400
You're out of pitch.

1215
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Some people can sing. Some can't.

1216
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,600
Impossible.

1217
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:00,500
It's not your job to give your opinion
of Mrs. Kane's talents.

1218
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:05,700
You're supposed to train her voice,
{y:i}Signor Matiste. Nothing more.

1219
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,100
Please continue with the lesson.

1220
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,500
-But, Mr. Kane.
-Please.

1221
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:15,200
I'll be the laughingstock
of the musical world. People will think--

1222
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,100
You're concerned what people will think?

1223
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:22,500
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit.
I'm an authority on what people will think.

1224
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,900
The newspapers for example.

1225
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,800
I run several newspapers
between here and San Francisco.

1226
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,300
It's all right, darling.

1227
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,600
{y:i}Signor Matiste is going to listen to reason.

1228
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,100
-How can I persuade you--
-You can't.

1229
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,300
It's all right, darling, go ahead.

1230
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,300
I thought you'd see it my way.

1231
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:29,900
No, no, no.

1232
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:02,300
{y:i}"Ah, cruel

1233
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,900
{y:i}"Tu m'as trop entendue

1234
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,300

1235

1241

01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:01,200

1243
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:08,900
{y:i}"Oh Dieux, arrachez-moi

1244
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,500
{y:i}"Ces feux fatals"

1245
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,700
I think it's dreadful.

1246
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:17,600
{y:i}"Allument ma mort

1247
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:26,700

01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:31,900

01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:36,200

1250
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,900

1251
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:45,100

01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:50,500

1253
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,900
{y:i}"Frappe"

1254
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,500
Stop telling me he's your friend.

1255
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:53,200
A friend don't write that kind of review.

1256
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:56,600
All these other papers panning me,
I could expect that.

1257
01:28:56,700 --> 01:29:00,300
{y:i}But for the Inquirer to run a thing like that,
spoiling my whole debut.

1258
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:01,100
Come in.

1259
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:02,100
I'll get it.

1260
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,900
Friend. Not the kind of friends I know...

1261
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,100
...but I'm not high class like you.

1262
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,300
And I never went to any swell schools.

1263
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,700
That'll be enough, Susan.

1264
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,000
From Mr. Leland, sir.

1265
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:15,500
He wanted me to make sure
you got this personally.

1266
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:18,300
Is that something from him?

1267
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:20,900
Charlie!

1268
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,300
As for you,
you ought to have your head examined.

1269
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,000
Sending him a letter telling him he's fired...

1270
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,400
...with a $25,000 check in it.

1271
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,900
What kind of firing do you call that?

1272
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,700
You did send him a check for $25,000,
didn't you?

1273
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:39,900
Yes.

1274
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:45,300
I sent him a check for $25,000.

1275
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,300
What's that?

1276
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,900
Declaration of Principles.

1277
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,000
What?

1278
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:54,700
What is it?

1279
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:01,300
An antique.

1280
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:04,000
You're awful funny, aren't you?

1281
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,100
I'll tell you one thing you're not going
to be funny about, and that's my singing.

1282
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,300
I'm through.

1283
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,800
I never wanted to do it in the first place.

1284
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:15,700
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.

1285
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:18,500
I don't propose
to have myself made ridiculous.

1286
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,700
You don't propose
to have yourself made ridiculous!

1287
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,000
What about me?
I'm the one that has to sing.

1288
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:27,000
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.

1289
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:28,800
Why don't you leave me alone?

1290
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:30,500
My reasons satisfy me, Susan.

1291
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,700
You seem unable to understand them.

1292
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,700
I will not tell them to you again.

1293
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,300
You'll continue with your singing.

1294
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,700
Get Dr. Corey.

1295
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,000
Susan.

1296
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:21,300
She'll be perfectly all right
in a day or two, Mr. Kane.

1297
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:27,100
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane
came to make such a foolish mistake.

1298
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:32,000
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her
was in a somewhat larger bottle.

1299
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:36,600
The strain of preparing for the new opera
has excited and confused her.

1300
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:38,900
Yes, I'm sure that was it.

1301
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,300
No objections to my staying
with her are there?

1302
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,300
No, not at all.
I'd like the nurse to be here, too.

1303
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,100
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1304
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,800
Charlie.

1305
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,900
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.

1306
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,500
But I couldn't go through
with the singing again.

1307
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:39,400
You don't know what it means
to know that people....

1308
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:43,500
That the whole audience doesn't want you.

1309
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
That's when you got to fight them.

1310
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,500
All right.

1311
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,700
You won't have to fight them anymore.

1312
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,900
It's their loss.

1313
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,600
What are you doing?

1314
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:30,800
Jigsaw puzzles?

1315
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:37,700
Charlie, what time is it?

1316
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,700
11:30.

1317
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,200
In New York?

1318
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,700
I said what time is it in New York?

1319
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:50,500
-1 1 :30.
-Night?

1320
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:55,700
{y:i}The Bulldog's just gone to press.

1321
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:58,900
{y:i}Well, hurray for the Bulldog.

1322
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:04,300
Gee, 11:30. Shows are just getting up.

1323
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,000
People are going to nightclubs
and restaurants.

1324
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:10,900
Of course, we're different
because we live in a palace.

1325
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,500
You always said you wanted
to live in a palace.

1326
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,900
A person could go crazy in this dump.

1327
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,700
Nobody to talk to,
nobody to have any fun with.

1328
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:24,100
49,000 acres of nothing
but scenery and statues.

1329
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:25,800
I'm lonesome.

1330
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:29,600
Until yesterday, we've had no less
than 50 of your friends at any one time.

1331
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:32,300
I think if you look in the west wing...

1332
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:35,300
...you'll probably find a dozen vacationists
still in residence.

1333
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:37,900
You make a joke out of everything.

1334
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:42,800
Charlie, I want to go to New York.
I'm tired of being a hostess.

1335
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:46,600
I want to have fun. Please, Charlie.

1336
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:50,900
Charlie, please.

1337
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,400
Our home is here, Susan.

1338
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:02,100
I don't care to visit New York.

1339
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,200
What are you doing?

1340
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,200
One thing I can never understand:

1341
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,300
How do you know
you haven't done it before?

1342
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:51,300
It makes a whole lot more sense
than collecting statues.

1343
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,300
You may be right.

1344
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:56,700
I sometimes wonder...

1345
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,400
...but you get into the habit.

1346
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:02,300
It's not a habit, I do it because I like it.

1347
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:05,100
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1348
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:10,300
Invite everybody to spend the night
at the Everglades.

1349
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:14,800
Invite everybody. Order everybody,
you mean, and make them sleep in tents.

1350
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,700
Who wants to sleep in tents
when they've got their own room...

1351
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,300
...with a bath, where they know
where everything is?

1352
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,700
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1353
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:31,000
You never give me anything
I really care about.

1354
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,000
"It can't be love

1355
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:47,900
"For there is no true love

1356
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:50,600
"l know I've played at the game

1357
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:53,500
"Like a moth in a blue flame

1358
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:57,200
"Lost in the end, just the same

1359
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:59,700
"All these years

1360
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:04,500
"My heart's been floating around
in a puddle of tears

1361
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,700
"l wonder what it is"

1362
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,700
Sure, you give me things,
but that don't mean anything to you.

1363
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,900
You're in a tent, darling,
you're not at home.

1364
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,300
I can hear you very well
if you speak in a normal tone of voice.

1365
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:25,100
What's the difference between giving me
a bracelet or giving someone $100,000...

1366
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:28,100
...for a statue you'll keep crated up
and never look at?

1367
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:30,400
It's just money. It doesn't mean anything.

1368
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:33,600
You never really gave me anything
that you care about.

1369
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:35,400
I want you to stop this.

1370
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:36,800
I'm not going to stop it.

1371
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:39,100
You never gave me anything in your life.

1372
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:42,300
You just tried to buy me
into giving you something.

1373
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,700
"It can't be love"

1374
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:03,500
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.

1375
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,500
You don't love me.

1376
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,500
You want me to love you.

1377
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:10,400
Sure. "I知 Charles Foster Kane.

1378
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,900
"Whatever you want,
just name it and it's yours.

1379
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,200
"But you gotta love me."

1380
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:22,100
Don't tell me you're sorry.

1381
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:25,600
I'm not sorry.

1382
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,500
Mr. Kane?

1383
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:41,500
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.

1384
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:47,300
Marie has been packing for her
since morning.

1385
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:56,700
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.
Tell him he can get the bags.

1386
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:58,500
Yes, madame.

1387
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,700
Have you gone completely crazy?

1388
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:05,900
Don't you know that our guests,
that everyone will know about this?

1389
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,700
Packed your bag, sent for the car--

1390
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:08,800
And left you?

1391
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:10,900
Of course they'll hear.

1392
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:14,400
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you.

1393
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:17,300
But I never imagined
people wouldn't know.

1394
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:21,500
I won't let you go.

1395
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,100
Goodbye, Charlie.

1396
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,900
Susan.

1397
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:46,200
Please don't go.

1398
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,300
Please, Susan.

1399
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,700
From now on, everything will be
exactly the way you want it to be.

1400
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,900
Not the way I think you want it, but...

1401
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:04,900
...your way.

1402
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,400
You mustn't go.

1403
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,600
You can't do this to me.

1404
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,800
I see.

1405
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:24,100
It's you that this is being done to.

1406
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,200
It's not me at all.

1407
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,300
Not what it means to me.

1408
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:32,400
I can't do this to you?

1409
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,700
Oh, yes, I can.

1410
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:57,100
In case you haven't heard,
I lost all my money and it was plenty.

1411
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:59,300
The last 10 years
have been difficult for many.

1412
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:02,300
They haven't been tough on me.
I just lost all my money.

1413
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:05,900
-You're going down to Xanadu?
-Monday, with boys from the office.

1414
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:08,600
Mr. Rawlston wants
the whole place photographed.

1415
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:10,200
We run a picture magazine.

1416
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:13,900
If you're smart, you'll get in touch
with Raymond. He's the butler.

1417
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,800
You'll learn a lot from him.

1418
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:18,300
He knows where all the bodies are buried.

1419
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:21,500
You know, all the same,
I feel kind of sorry for Mr. Kane.

1420
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:25,300
Don't you think I do?

1421
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:32,500
What do you know, it's morning already.

1422
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:39,300
Come around and tell me the story
of your life sometime.

1423
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:47,600
Rosebud?

1424
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:52,100
I'll tell you about Rosebud.

1425
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,400
How much is it worth to you?

1426
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,700
$1,000?

1427
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,200
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.

1428
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:12,200
-He acted funny sometimes, you know?
-No, I didn't.

1429
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,700
Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.

1430
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,400
I've been working for him 11 years now...

1431
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:21,100
...in charge of the whole place,
so I ought to know.

1432
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,700
-Rosebud.
-Yes.

1433
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:27,500
Like I tell you, the old man
acted kind of funny sometimes...

1434
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:31,200
-...but I knew how to handle him--
-Need a lot of service?

1435
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:34,200
But I knew how to handle him.

1436
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:35,900
Like that time his wife left.

1437
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:47,300
Rosebud.

1438
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:54,100
I see.

1439
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:57,100
And that's what you know about Rosebud?

1440
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,800
I heard him say it that other time, too.

1441
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,300
He just said:

1442
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:05,400
"Rosebud."

1443
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:08,600
Then he dropped the glass ball
and it broke on the floor.

1444
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:13,300
He didn't say anything after that,
and I knew he was dead.

1445
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:16,700
He said all kinds of things
that didn't mean anything.

1446
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:18,700
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1447
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:22,300
-Yes and no.
-That isn't worth $1,000.

1448
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:25,200
You can keep on asking questions
if you want to.

1449
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,100
We're leaving tonight...

1450
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:29,700
...when we're through taking pictures.

1451
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,700
Allow yourself plenty of time.

1452
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:35,400
The train stops at the junction on signal,
but they don't like to wait.

1453
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:39,300
I can remember when they'd wait all day...

1454
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,200
...if Mr. Kane said so.

1455
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,100
Better get going.

1456
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:51,700
-Can we come down?
-Yes, hurry up. We're leaving.

1457
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,100
How much do you think
this is all worth, Mr. Thompson?

1458
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:58,800
Millions.

1459
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:01,400
If anybody wants it.

1460
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:04,000
Well, at least he brought all this stuff
to America.

1461
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:05,800
-What's that?
-Another Venus.

1462
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:07,100
$25,000.

1463
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,700
A lot of money to pay
for a dame without a head.

1464
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,900
The banks are out of luck?

1465
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:15,900
-They'll clear all right.
-He never threw anything away.

1466
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,000
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467
{y:i}employees of the New York Inquirer."

1467
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:26,200
"One stove from the estate of Mary Kane,
Little Salem, Colorado. Value: $2."

1468
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:28,700
We're supposed to get everything,
junk as well as art.

1469
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,400
He sure liked to collect things.

1470
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:31,800
Anything and everything.

1471
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:33,500
A regular crow, eh?

1472
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,200
-Hey, look, a jigsaw puzzle.
-We got a lot of those.

1473
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:39,200
A Burmese temple and three
Spanish ceilings down the hall.

1474
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:41,100
Part of a Scotch castle...

1475
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:42,900
...that needs to be unwrapped.

1476
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:44,600
Put all this stuff together:

1477
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:47,700
The palaces and the paintings,
and the toys and everything.

1478
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:49,700
What would it spell?

1479
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:53,700
-Charles Foster Kane?
-Or Rosebud.

1480
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,100
-How about it, Jerry?
-What's Rosebud?

1481
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:59,300
That's what he said when he died.

1482
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,100
Did you ever find out what it means?

1483
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,300
-No, I didn't.
-What did you find out about him?

1484
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:05,700
Not much, really.

1485
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:10,400
We'd better get started.

1486
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:14,500
What have you been doing all this time?

1487
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,100
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle.

1488
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:20,800
If you'd discovered what Rosebud meant,
I bet it would've explained everything.

1489
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,300
No, I don't think so.

1490
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:24,300
No.

1491
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:27,800
He was a man who got
everything he wanted, and then lost it.

1492
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:31,500
Maybe Rosebud was something
he couldn't get or something he lost.

1493
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,700
It wouldn't have explained anything.

1494
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,600
I don't think any word
can explain a man's life.

1495
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:42,500
No. I guess Rosebud is just a piece
in a jigsaw puzzle.

1496
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:45,300
A missing piece.

1497
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:53,000
Come on, everybody...

1498
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:56,900
...we'll miss the train.

1499
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:01,100
Throw that junk in.

1500
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:37,600
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

1501
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:40,100
Everything was his idea...

1502
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,900
...except my leaving him.

1503
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,700
I've got his trunk all packed.

1504
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:50,000
I've had it packed for a week now.

1505
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:53,600
Sometimes I think I'd prefer
a rival of flesh and blood.

1506
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,600
You're gonna need more than one lesson.

1507
01:52:58,700 --> 01:53:01,100
And you'll get more than one lesson.

1508
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:07,600
Who's a busy man, me?

1509
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:11,000
I'm chairman of the board.
I got nothing but time.

1510
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,600
What do you want to know?

1511
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:17,100
We thought.... If we could find out what he
meant by his last words as he was dying....

1512
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:19,700
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1513
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,100
Yes and no.

1514
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:25,100
"l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."

1515
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:28,900
"l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."
