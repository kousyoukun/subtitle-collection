00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,168
不再信任他
...ceased to trust him.

128
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,215
上周，象所有人都不可避免的一樣
Then last week, as it must to all men...

129
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,761
死亡走向凱恩
...death came to Charles Foster Kane.

130
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,597
--
News on the March.

131
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:34,978
就這麼多
That's it.

132
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:38,607
（打電話）等著，需要重放時，我會通知你的
Stand by. I'll tell you if we want to run it again.

133
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,360
- 嗯？怎麼樣，若爾斯東先生？ - 你們覺得怎麼樣，夥計們？
-How about it, Mr. Rawlston? -How do you like it, boys?

134
00:12:41,443 --> 00:12:45,322
- 一個人的七十年的生活… - 要擺進一部新聞片埵釣レh了…
-Seventy years in a man's life. -That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.

135
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:47,866
是一部很好的短片，湯姆遜 不過需要有一個觀點
It's a good short, but what it needs is an angle.

136
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:51,244
整部影片告訴我們的只是： 凱恩死了
All we saw on that screen was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.

137
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:53,413
這個我知道，我已經讀了報紙了…
I know that. I read the papers.

138
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:55,957
僅僅表現一個人做了什麼是不夠的 還要告訴人們他是誰
It isn't enough to tell us what a man did...

139
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,461
僅僅表現一個人做了什麼是不夠的 還要告訴人們他是誰
...you've got to tell us who he was.

140
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:02,798
等等，凱恩臨死前說了什麼？
Wait a minute. What were Kane's last words?

141
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,841
記得嗎？
Do you remember, boys?

142
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,386
他臨死前說了什麼？
What were the last words he said on Earth?

143
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:09,554
或許他在臨終前告訴了我們一切
Maybe he told us about himself on his deathbed.

144
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:12,724
- 或許他沒有說 - 我們看見的是一個重要的美國人
-Maybe he didn't. -All we saw was a big American.

145
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:15,811
但他和福特有何區別？或者說約翰·杜
How did he differ from Ford, Hearst or John Doe?

146
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,522
我告訴你，一個人的臨終遺言…
I tell you, a man's dying words--

147
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:20,565
- 什麼遺言？ - 你沒看報紙嗎？
What were they? You don't read the papers.

148
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,151
凱恩先生臨終時只留下了四個字
When Charles Foster Kane died, he said one word:

149
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,236
 “玫瑰花蕾”
"Rosebud."

150
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:26,071
- 他就說了這幾個字？
That's all he said? Tough guy.

151
00:13:26,154 --> 00:13:28,448
- 對，“玫瑰花蕾”，就這麼四個字！
Yes, "Rosebud." Just that one word.

152
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:30,492
- 可是她是誰… - 或者是指什麼東西？
-But who is she? -What was it?

153
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:32,703
這個人本有可能成為總統…
Here's a man who could've been president...

154
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:35,080
象我們時代的每個人一樣 招人愛，招人恨，招人議論
...who was as loved, hated and talked about...

155
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:37,708
但是當他死到臨頭時，掛念著的 卻是一個叫做玫瑰花蕾的什麼東西
...as any man in our time, but when he dies...

156
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,043
但是當他死到臨頭時，掛念著的 卻是一個叫做玫瑰花蕾的什麼東西
...something is on his mind called Rosebud.

157
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:42,587
- 這個詞兒意味著什麼？ - 也許是他曾經押過賭注的賽馬
-What does that mean? -A racehorse he bet on once.

158
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:45,007
- 而且沒有中彩 - 好…是哪次賽馬？
-That didn't come in. -But what was the race?

159
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,258
玫瑰花蕾
Rosebud.

160
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:47,175
- 湯姆遜！ - 是的
-Thompson. -Yes.

161
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:49,177
把片子留一兩個星期，如果有必要的話
Hold this up a week, two if you must.

162
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:51,013
您不認為就在他剛死後立即發行 可能更好…
Don't you think right after he's dead--

163
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,224
弄清楚玫瑰花蕾的來歷！ 去找每一個認識他的人…
Find out about Rosebud. Get in touch with anybody who knew him...

164
00:13:54,308 --> 00:13:55,809
…或瞭解他的人
...or knew him well.

165
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:57,769
他的那個經理…
That manager of his....

166
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:00,314
伯恩斯坦，他的第二個老婆 她還活著
Bernstein. His second wife. She's still living.

167
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:01,690
蘇珊·亞歷山大·凱恩
Susan Alexander Kane.

168
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:04,609
- 她在亞特蘭大城開一家夜總會 - 好的！
-She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City. -That's right.

169
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:08,113
把他們全都訪問一遍，所有為他工作的人…
See them all. Get in touch with everybody that ever worked for him...

170
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:11,074
…愛他的人，恨透了他的人
...whoever loved him, whoever hated his guts.

171
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:14,411
我當然不是說要查遍姓名地址錄
I don't mean go through the city directory of course.

172
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,079
我立即出發，若爾斯東先生
I'll get on it right away.

173
00:14:16,163 --> 00:14:18,874
好的！玫瑰花蕾，死活都要！
Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.

174
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,294
也可能是一件很簡單的東西
It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing.

175
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,251
亞歷山大小姐
Miss Alexander.

176
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:06,713
這位是湯姆遜先生，亞歷山大小姐
This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.

177
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,174
再來一杯，約翰
I want another drink, John.

178
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:15,055
馬上就來，您要什麼嗎，湯姆遜先生？
Right away. Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?

179
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:18,642
- 我想要一杯蘇打威士卡 - 誰讓你在這兒坐下來的？
-I'll have a highball, please. -Who told you you could sit down?

180
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,437
我想也許我們可以一起喝一杯
I thought maybe we could have a talk.

181
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,981
再想想！
Think again.

182
00:15:25,273 --> 00:15:27,567
為什麼你們總是纏著我？
Can't you people leave me alone?

183
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,903
我不管別人的閒事，你們也別管我的
I'm minding my own business, you mind yours.

184
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,906
我只想和您簡單地談談 亞歷山大小姐，我只是…
If I could just have a talk with you, Miss Alexander. I'd--

185
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:34,491
滾出去！
Get out of here.

186
00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:37,536
滾！
Get out!

187
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:40,414
- 抱歉 - 滾！
-Sorry. -Get out.

188
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,166
- 能不能另找時間… - 滾！
-Maybe some other time. -Get out.

189
00:15:54,177 --> 00:15:55,304
金諾
Gino.

190
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,974
再給她拿一杯蘇打威士卡
Get her another highball.

191
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:01,977
她就是不願跟任何人說話，湯姆遜先生
She just won't talk to nobody, Mr. Thompson.

192
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,145
沒關係
Okay.

193
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:07,983
- 再要一杯雙料的？ - 對
-Another double? -Yeah.

194
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:10,694
你好，我要紐約市
Hello, I want New York City.

195
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:15,282
考特蘭7-9970 這堿O亞特蘭大城4-6827，好的
Courtland 79970. This is Atlantic City 46827. All right.

196
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,953
她…
She's....

197
00:16:20,662 --> 00:16:22,289
她是借酒澆愁
She'll snap out of it.

198
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:25,751
在凱恩先生去世以前 她隨時都願意談到他…
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as any--

199
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,210
- 哈羅 - 可現在…
-Hello. -Sooner.

200
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:29,963
我是湯姆遜，我要和頭兒說話，好嗎？
This is Thompson. Let me talk to the chief.

201
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,759
若爾斯東先生，她不願談
Mr. Rawlston? She won't talk.

202
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:36,845
第二任凱恩太太 關於玫瑰花蕾或其他任何事！
The second Mrs. Kane. About Rosebud or anything else.

203
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:38,680
我現在從亞特蘭大城打電話給你
I'm calling from Atlantic City.

204
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:42,392
明天早上我就到費城去 到賽切爾的圖書館，看一下他的那本日記
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia, to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.

205
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:43,852
我跟他們約好了
They're expecting me.

206
00:16:43,894 --> 00:16:47,439
然後去紐約和凱恩的總經理見面 名字叫…伯恩斯坦
Then I've a meeting with his general manager in New York. Bernstein.

207
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:49,024
之後我再返回此地
Then I'm coming back here.

208
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:52,027
是的，所有還活著的我都去拜訪 再見，若爾斯東先生
Yeah, I'll see everybody that's still alive. Goodbye.

209
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:54,988
- 嘿…呃… - 約翰
-Hey.... -John.

210
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:56,907
約翰，你可能會幫上我的忙
You just might be able to help me.

211
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,702
她過去談到凱恩的時候 有沒有提到過——玫瑰花蕾？
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane, did she ever mention Rosebud?

212
00:17:01,244 --> 00:17:02,579
“玫瑰花蕾”？
"Rosebud"?

213
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:04,998
謝謝您，湯姆遜先生，謝謝
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.

214
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:09,503
說老實話，就在前幾天 當報紙上報導了這件事的時候…
As a matter of fact, just the other day, when the papers were full of it...

215
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:13,090
…我問過她
...l asked her.

216
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,759
她從來沒有聽說過什麼玫瑰花蕾
She never heard of Rosebud.

217
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:32,526
賽切爾紀念圖書館的負責人 要我再次提醒您…
The directors of the Thatcher Memorial Library have asked me to remind you...

218
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:35,362
…只有在遵守約定的情況下你才能…
...about the conditions under which you may...

219
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:38,573
…閱讀賽切爾先生未發表回憶錄的一部分
...inspect certain portions of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.

220
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,284
- 那沒問題 - 是的，詹尼斯，我現在就帶他進去
-l remember them. -Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.

221
00:17:41,368 --> 00:17:43,912
- 我只需要一個小時… - 決不允許…
-All I want is an hour-- -Under no circumstances...

222
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:47,749
…直接引用他的手稿，跟我來
...are direct quotes from his manuscript to be used by you. You may follow me.

223
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,043
好的，我只想尋找…
That's all right. I'm just looking for--

224
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:04,391
詹尼斯
Jennings.

225
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:10,897
謝謝你，詹尼斯
Thank you, Jennings.

226
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:14,776
你必須在4點30分離開這個房間
You will be required to leave this room at 4:30 promptly.

227
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,654
我們的協議是，你只能閱讀…
You will confine yourself, it is our understanding...

228
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:21,241
…賽切爾手稿中有關凱恩先生的章節
...to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.

229
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:23,201
我感興趣的就是這個
That's all I'm interested in.

230
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,495
謝謝
Thank you.

231
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:29,750
從83頁到142頁
Pages 83 to 142.

232
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,956
快來啊
Come on, boys.

233
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:11,458
小心，查理斯！
Be careful, Charles.

234
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,459
凱恩太太
Mrs. Kane.

235
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:14,711
把圍脖圍好，查理斯
Pull your muffler around your neck, Charles.

236
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:17,047
凱恩太太，我們現在該告訴他了
Mrs. Kane, I think we'll have to tell him now.

237
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,634
我現在就在這些契紙上簽字，賽切爾先生
Yes, I'll sign those papers now, Mr. Thatcher.

238
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:24,096
看來你們這些人忘了我是孩子的父親
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.

239
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,099
一切完全按照我跟賽切爾先生說的辦
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.

240
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:30,894
卡羅拉多沒什麼不好的 我不明白我們為什麼不能自己撫養孩子…
There's nothing wrong with Colorado. I don't see why we can't raise our son...

241
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:32,771
…難道僅僅因為變得有錢？
...just 'cause we came into money.

242
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:35,816
如果我願意的話，我可以告到法院去 當父親的有這樣的權利
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to.

243
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:39,194
一個房客交不起房租 留下了一張毫無價值的股票…
A boarder that beats his bill and leaves worthless stock behind....

244
00:19:39,236 --> 00:19:42,197
如果這張股票值錢了…
That property is as much my property as anybody's...

245
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:45,200
…那它同樣也是我的財產 如果弗萊德·格雷夫料到…
...now that it's valuable. And if Fred Graves had any idea...

246
00:19:45,242 --> 00:19:48,829
…這樣的事，他本會在那些證件上 寫上我們兩人的名字了
...this would happen, he'd have made out the certificates in both our names.

247
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:52,374
- 但是上面寫的是凱恩太太的名字 - 他欠的是我們兩人的膳宿費
-But they're made out to Mrs. Kane. -He owed the money to both of us.

248
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:57,295
-“銀行關於所有事項的決定…” - 我不同意把我的孩子託付給銀行…
-"The bank's decision in all matters--" -l don't hold with giving Charles to a bank--

249
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:59,631
- 我要求你別瞎鬧了，吉姆 - 我們文化程度不高…
-Stop this nonsense. -We're a bit uneducated--

250
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,842
銀行關於教育方面的決定…
"The bank's decision concerning his education...

251
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:04,386
“…比如他的居住地點，是最終的決定”
"...his places of residence, is to be final."

252
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:08,015
- 一想到要讓銀行來當監護人… - 你就別瞎鬧了，吉姆
-The idea of a bank being the guardian-- -Stop this nonsense, Jim.

253
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:11,018
“我們將接管科羅拉多的洛德礦井 的全部經營管理”…
"We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode"...

254
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,729
…我重複一遍，凱恩太太， 您是唯一的產權所有人
...which I repeat, Mrs. Kane, you are the sole owner.

255
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,981
- 簽在哪裡，賽切爾先生？ - 就在這堙A凱恩太太
-Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher? -Right here.

256
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:18,483
瑪麗，我最後一次請求你…
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.

257
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,737
大家都會認為我不是一個好丈夫或者父親
You'd think I hadn't been a good husband or father--

258
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,363
你們兩位都在世的時候…
The sum of $50,000 a year...

259
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:26,658
…每年將付給您和凱恩先生50,000元…
...is to be paid to you and Mr. Kane as long as you both live...

260
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:28,869
…在此之後，則付給健在的人
...and thereafter to the survivor.

261
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:32,372
- 好吧，但願一切如願 - 是這樣的
-Let's hope it's all for the best. -It is.

262
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,839
我無法理解我為什麼不能撫養自己的孩子
Why I can't raise my own boy is more than I can understand.

263
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:42,758
賽切爾先生，說下去
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

264
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:46,011
其他一切東西，資本和全部收益…
Everything else, the principal, as well as all monies earned...

265
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:50,140
…均由銀行代您的兒子 查理斯·福斯特·凱恩管理
...is to be administered by the bank in trust for your son, Charles Foster Kane...

266
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:52,976
…直到他二十五歲生日，屆時…
...until he reaches his 25th birthday, at which time...

267
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,312
…將全都歸他所有
...he is to come into complete possession.

268
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:56,688
查理斯！
Charles!

269
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:00,359
說下去，賽切爾先生
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

270
00:21:01,485 --> 00:21:05,113
快五點了，凱恩太太 你看我是不是該見見孩子？
It's almost 5:00. Don't you think I'd better meet the boy?

271
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:07,908
我已經把他的箱子收拾好了
I've got his trunk all packed.

272
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:11,244
幾個禮拜以前我就把它收拾好了
I've had it packed for a week now.

273
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:16,291
我已經安排好，讓一位教師在芝加哥等我們
I've arranged for a tutor to meet us in Chicago.

274
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,669
我本打算帶他一起來，但是…
I'd have brought him here with me, but....

275
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:21,129
- 查理斯 - 嘿，媽媽
-Charles. -Look, Mom.

276
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:22,756
你最好進屋來
You'd better come inside.

277
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,801
- 雪人做得不錯  - 我把它嘴堛熒炾垣酗U來了
-That's quite a snowman. -l took the pipe out of his mouth.

278
00:21:25,842 --> 00:21:27,386
是你自己做的嗎？
Did you make it yourself?.

279
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:30,013
或許我還可以做幾個牙和鬍鬚
Maybe I'll make some teeth and whiskers.

280
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:32,349
這是賽切爾先生，查理斯
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

281
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:34,851
- 你好 - 你好，查理斯？
-Hello. -How do you do, Charles?

282
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:36,478
他是從東部來的
He comes from the East.

283
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,063
- 爸爸 - 哈羅，查理斯
-Pa. -Hello, Charlie.

284
00:21:38,146 --> 00:21:39,356
查理斯
Charles.

285
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:41,483
什麼事，媽媽
Yes, Mommy.

286
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,113
賽切爾先生今晚要帶你出遠門，查理斯
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight.

287
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:47,948
你要乘10次車走
You'll be leaving on number 10.

288
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,200
就是那全點著燈的火車
That's the train with all the lights on it.

289
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:51,284
你去嗎，媽媽？
You going, Mom?

290
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:54,621
不，你母親不能馬上走，查理斯，但她會…
No. Your mother won't be going right away, but she'll....

291
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,040
我上哪兒去？
Where am I going?

292
00:21:57,124 --> 00:22:00,919
你或許能去看看芝加哥、紐約和華盛頓 對嗎，柴契爾先生？
You're going to see Chicago and New York and Washington, maybe. Ain't he?

293
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:02,129
當然
He certainly is.

294
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:05,632
我真希望自己也是個小孩子 第一次就能做這樣的旅行
I wish I were a boy going on a trip like that for the first time.

295
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:08,969
- 您為什麼不跟我們一塊兒去，媽媽？ - 我們必須呆在這兒，查理斯
-Why aren't you coming with us, Mom? -We have to stay here, Charles.

296
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,930
今後你就和賽切爾先生一塊兒過，查理斯
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie.

297
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:15,434
你會闊起來的，你媽想…我是說…呃…
You're gonna be rich. Your ma figures, well, that is...

298
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:18,854
…她和我都認為，這兒不是你呆的地方
...me and her decided this ain't the place for you to grow up in.

299
00:22:18,895 --> 00:22:21,315
有一天你也許會成為美國最闊的…
You'll probably be the richest man someday...

300
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:23,859
-…你應該得到… - 你不會孤單的，查理斯
-...and you ought to get-- -You won't be lonely.

301
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:27,404
當然不會孤單 我們在一起會很愉快的，真的
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have fine times together, we are.

302
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:30,365
握握手吧，來 我並不是那麼可怕，不對嗎？
Let's shake hands. Come. I'm not that frightening, am l?

303
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:33,035
- 你說怎樣？咱們握握手 - 怎麼了，查理斯
-What do you say? Let's shake. -Why, Charles.

304
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:34,870
- 你差一點兒把打傷我了，查理斯 - 查理斯！
-Why, you almost hurt me. -Charlie!

305
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,456
雪橇不是用來打人的 它是…用來滑雪的
Sleds aren't to hit people, but to sleigh with.

306
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:38,498
媽媽！
Mom!

307
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:40,876
- 你！ - 吉姆！
-You got to go. -Jim!

308
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:43,045
對不起，賽切爾先生！
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.

309
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,963
這個孩子欠揍！
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.

310
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:46,882
- 你是這麼想的嗎，吉姆？ - 是的
-That's what you think, is it? -Yes.

311
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:51,261
所以他必須到你碰不到的地方去受教育
That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him.

312
00:23:11,031 --> 00:23:13,325
你好，查理斯…
Well, Charles...

313
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:17,913
- 聖誕快樂 - 聖誕快樂
-...Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas.

314
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,540
也祝你新年快樂
And a happy New Year.

315
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:21,917
最後…
In closing...

316
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,837
我想提醒一下，你即將到來的25歲生日…
...may I remind you your 25th birthday, which is now approaching...

317
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:28,632
標誌著你可以完全不受…
...marks your complete independence from the firm...

318
00:23:28,715 --> 00:23:32,260
賽切爾公司的制約，並同時獲得…
...of Thatcher & Company, as well as acquiring the full responsibility...

319
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,763
世界第六大私人財產的完全支配權
...for the world's sixth largest private fortune.

320
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,933
- 明白嗎？ -“世界第六大私人財產”
-Got that? -"The world's sixth largest private fortune."

321
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,187
我不認為你能完全明白 你即將赴任的職位的重要性
I don't think you realize the full importance of the position you are to occupy.

322
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,481
為你著想，我隨信寄去了…
I am therefore enclosing for your consideration...

323
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:47,275
…一份你的詳細股權清單
...a list of your holdings, extensively cross-indexed.

324
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,569
-“親愛的賽切爾” - 是凱恩先生的來信
-"Dear Mr. Thatcher." -It's from Mr. Kane.

325
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:52,030
- 繼續 -抱歉，我對金礦不感興趣…
-Go on. -"Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...

326
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:54,157
“…包括油井、船運或其他不動產”
"...oil wells, shipping or real estate."

327
00:23:54,324 --> 00:23:56,451
不感興趣？
Not interested?

328
00:23:56,618 --> 00:24:00,038
你清單上的一個專案吸引了我? 紐約《問事報》
"One item on your list intrigues me: The New York Inquirer.

329
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:03,000
這份小報因為贖回權過期而為我們所有
"A little newspaper we acquired in a foreclosure proceeding.

330
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,460
不要賣掉它，我準備回來接管
"Don't sell it. I am coming back to take charge.

331
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,005
我想經營報社肯定會很有趣
"l think it would be fun to run a newspaper.

332
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:12,217
“經營報社肯定會很有趣”

336
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,862
“地產商拒絕清理貧民區”
"Landlords refuse to clear slums."

337
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:35,907

"Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast."

341
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,087
你確實認為報紙是這樣辦的嗎？
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?

342
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:52,549
我不懂怎樣辦報，賽切爾先生 我只是想到什麼，就試著辦
I don't know how to run a newspaper. I try everything I can think of.

343
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:55,594
你知道，這條消息—— 西班牙戰艦在新澤西海面…
You know there's not the slightest proof this...

344
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:58,597
-…沒有一點兒證據 - 你好，伯恩斯坦先生
-...Armada's off the Jersey Coast. -Hello, Mr. Bernstein.

345
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,140
你能證明不是這樣嗎？
Can you prove it isn't?

346
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:02,934
伯恩斯坦先生，這是賽切爾先生
Mr. Bernstein, I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.

347
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:04,853
- 李蘭先生 - 你好

柴契爾先生是我以前的監護人
Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.

349
00:25:06,688 --> 00:25:11,902
我們對自己的讀者是不保密的 賽切爾先生是我們最忠實的讀者之一
We have no secrets from our readers. Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.

350
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:15,864
自從我接手以來 每期《問事報》的毛病他都知道，讀電報吧
He knows what's wrong with every copy of the Inquirer since I took over. Read.

351
00:25:15,906 --> 00:25:18,992
古巴的菜肴可口，姑娘風騷，句號 風景可以用詩歌描繪…
"Girls delightful in Cuba. Stop. Could send you prose poems...

352
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:22,871
…但我不想浪費錢財，句號
"...about scenery but don't feel right spending your money. Stop.

353
00:25:22,913 --> 00:25:25,749
“古巴沒有戰爭” 簽名“惠勒”，要回電嗎？
"There is no war in Cuba." Signed "Wheeler." Any answer?

354
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:30,337
回電，“親愛的惠勒? 你提供散文詩，我來提供戰爭”
Yes. Dear Wheeler: You provide the prose poems, I'll provide the war.

355
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,215
- 妙極了 - 我自己也挺喜歡這句話，馬上發出去
-That's fine. -l like it myself. Send it right away.

356
00:25:33,256 --> 00:25:35,634
查理斯，我來找你談這個——你的鬥爭
I came to see you about this campaign of yours.

357
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:38,553
《問事報》反對大都會轉運公司的鬥爭
The Inquirer's campaign against the Public Transit Company.

358
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,889
你有什麼理由來反對這場鬥爭？
Do you know anything we can use against them?

359
00:25:40,931 --> 00:25:42,516
你還是個大學生，對嗎？
You're still the college boy, eh?

360
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,311
不，我被大學開除了，好幾家大學 你不記得了嗎？可我記得
I was expelled from college, a lot of colleges, you remember? I remember.

361
00:25:47,396 --> 00:25:50,232
查理斯，我想我應該提醒你一下 你大概忘了一件事
I think I should remind you of a fact you have forgotten.

362
00:25:50,273 --> 00:25:54,152
你本人是大都會轉運公司 最大的個人股東之一
You're one of the largest stockholders in the Public Transit Company.

363
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:57,280
麻煩的是，賽切爾先生 你不瞭解你是在和兩個人談話
The trouble is, you don't realize you're talking to two people.

364
00:25:57,364 --> 00:26:00,534
作為查理斯·福斯特·凱恩 我擁有大都會轉運公司的82,361張股票
As Charles Foster Kane who owns 82,364 shares...

365
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:04,413
你瞧，我對自己的還是心埵頃う
...of Public Transit Preferred. See, I do have a general idea of my holdings.

366
00:26:04,454 --> 00:26:06,957
我很同情您，凱恩確實是個流氓
I sympathize with you. Kane is a scoundrel...

367
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:10,377
應當關閉他的報館 成立一個委員會來抵制他
...his paper should be closed, a committee formed to boycott him.

368
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:14,256
如果您成立了這樣一個委員會 您可以算上我一個，我捐一千元
If you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of $1,000.

369
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:17,175
- 另一方面，我是《問事報》的出版人 - 我的時間寶貴…
On the other hand, I am the publisher of the Inquirer.

370
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:21,346
可以向你透漏一個秘密，我的義務 也是我的心願是：
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in on a little secret. It is also my pleasure...

371
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:25,726
保證本城的正派而勤勞的居民 不致被一群…
...to see that the working people of this community aren't robbed by a pack...

372
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:28,353
貪得無厭的強盜洗劫，僅僅是由於…
...of money-mad pirates, just because...

373
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,940
沒有人關心他們的利益
...they have no one to look after their interests.

374
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,360
我再給您透露一個秘密，賽切爾先生?
I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher:

375
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:39,281
我認為我就是那個人 您知道，我有錢，也有財產
I think I'm the man to do it. You see, I have money and property.

376
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:43,368
如果我不來保護那些無權階層 其他人也會這樣做
If I don't look after the interests of the underprivileged, somebody else will.

377
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:45,495
也許是無錢無產的人
Maybe somebody without money or property.

378
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:46,913
-…那樣更糟 - 是的，是的，今天早上我正巧…
That would be too bad.

379
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:49,082
看見你的財務清單
I saw your financial statement today.

380
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:52,127
- 哦，是嗎？ - 如實告訴我…
-Oh, did you? -Tell me, honestly...

381
00:26:52,336 --> 00:26:56,632
你不覺得繼續辦這個慈善企業有點不明智嗎？
...don't you think it's rather unwise to continue this philanthropic enterprise...

382
00:26:56,673 --> 00:26:59,760
…這份《問事報》每年花掉你一百萬元
...this Inquirer, that is costing you $1 million a year?

383
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:04,640
您說得對，我們去年確實虧一百萬 我們今年也準備要虧一百萬
Yes. I did lose $1 million last year. I expect to lose $1 million this year.

384
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,434
我希望明年也虧一百萬
I expect to lose $1 million next year.

385
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:09,728
按每年一百萬這樣虧下去
At the rate of $1 million a year...

386
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:13,398
這份報紙我還可以維持60年
...I?l have to close this place in 60 years.

387
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:25,577
鑒於上述報紙…
"With respect to the said newspapers...

388
00:27:25,661 --> 00:27:28,121
及查理斯·福斯特·凱恩本人…
"...the said Charles Foster Kane...

389
00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:31,792
特此交出其所有報業集團的控制權…
"...hereby relinquishes all control thereof...

390
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:35,003
以及附屬的…
"...and of the syndicates pertaining thereto...

391
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:41,134
任何其他的報紙、評論和出版工具…
"...and any and all other newspaper, press and publishing properties of any kind...

392
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,971
“並同意放棄附屬的主張權…”
"...and agrees to abandon all claim thereto--"

393
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:47,391
- 這意味著我們立即破產 - 是啊，沒有現金了
-Which means we're bust all right. -Well, out of cash.

394
00:27:47,474 --> 00:27:49,017
好吧，波恩斯坦先生
All right, Mr. Bernstein.

395
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:53,647
我讀過了，賽切爾先生， 讓我簽個字就回家吧
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher, just let me sign it and go home.

396
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:57,067
你年齡大了，不能叫我賽切爾先生，查理斯
You're too old to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

397
00:27:57,192 --> 00:28:00,195
你也太老了，其他的稱呼不合適
You're too old to be called anything else.

398
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,489
你總是太老
You were always too old.

399
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:06,827
多方考慮，柴契爾公司同意…
"In consideration thereof, Thatcher & Company agrees...

400
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:09,705
“在查理斯·福斯特·凱恩 的有生之年給其發放津貼…”
"...to pay to Charles Foster Kane, as long as he lives--"

401
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,415
我的津貼
My allowance.

402
00:28:11,498 --> 00:28:15,377
你可以通過適度控制 繼續經營你的報社…
"You will continue to maintain over your newspapers a large...

403
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,215
“適度控制？” - 適度控制
"...measure of control. Measure of control."

404
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:23,927
我們會徵求你的意見的
And we shall seek your advice.

405
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:30,392
蕭條是暫時的
This depression is temporary.

406
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,397
很可能你死的時候比我富有
There's always the chance that you'll die richer than I will.

407
00:28:35,605 --> 00:28:38,066
我死的時候肯定比我出生的時候富有
It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.

408
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,610
創造的總比失去的多
We never lost as much as we made.

409
00:28:40,694 --> 00:28:45,198
是的，是的，但你的方法 你知道，查理斯…
Yes, yes, but your methods. You know, Charles...

410
00:28:45,282 --> 00:28:50,537
你從未進行過一次投資，你總是用錢來…
...you never made a single investment. You always used money to....

411
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,248
消費
To buy things.

412
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,754
消費
To buy things.

413
00:28:59,713 --> 00:29:03,675
我母親本可能選擇一家更不可靠的銀行
My mother should have chosen a less reliable banker.

414
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:14,269
我過去總是開那份遺產的玩笑
I always gagged on that silver spoon.

415
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:18,273
你知道，波恩斯坦先生…
You know, Mr. Bernstein...

416
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:22,653
如果我本來並不富裕…
...if I hadn't been very rich...

417
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:25,572
我或許能成為一個真正偉大的人
...l might have been a really great man.

418
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:27,824
你認為你現在不是嗎？
Don't you think you are?

419
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:33,038
我想在那種條件下我會做得更好
I think I did pretty well under the circumstances.

420
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,292
你本來想成為什麼人？
What would you like to have been?

421
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:42,422
你所討厭的
Everything you hate.

422
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:54,101
對不起，你說什麼？
I beg your pardon, sir? What did you say?

423
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:57,980
- 到4點30了，是不是，詹尼斯？ - 是的，夫人
-It抯 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings? -Yes, ma'am.

424
00:29:58,105 --> 00:30:00,649
你享受了一個少有的特權，年青人
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege, young man.

425
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,777
- 找到你所要找的東西了嗎？ - 沒有
-Did you find what you were looking for? -No.

426
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,281
- 你不是玫瑰花蕾吧？ - 什麼？
-You're not Rosebud, are you? -What?

427
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:11,326
玫瑰花蕾，你的名字叫詹尼斯，是嗎？
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings, isn't it?

428
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:15,914
各位再見，謝謝讓我使用了這間大廳
Goodbye, everybody. Thanks for the use of the hall.

429
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:20,210
誰是一個忙人？我嗎？我是董事長
Who's a busy man, me? I'm chairman of the board.

430
00:30:20,294 --> 00:30:22,713
除了時間我什麼都沒有 你想打聽什麼？
I got nothing but time. What do you want to know?

431
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:27,009
我們想也許…，如果我們能搞清楚 他最後的話是什麼意思…
We thought maybe.... If we could find out what he meant by his last words...

432
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,636
…他臨終時說的話 - 是那句“玫瑰花蕾”嗎？
-...as he was dying. -That "Rosebud"?

433
00:30:29,678 --> 00:30:32,180
也許是某一個姑娘？
Maybe some girl?

434
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,516
在他早期生活中有不少
There were a lot of them in the early days.

435
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:37,811
不大可能吧 凱恩先生以前和一個姑娘萍水相逢…
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane could have met someone casually...

436
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:40,147
而五十年後，在他臨終時…
...and then 50 years later, on his deathbed--

437
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:45,027
你還太年輕，湯…湯姆遜先生
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.

438
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:48,822
一個人可能記得許多 你認為他不會記得的東西
A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember.

439
00:30:48,905 --> 00:30:50,657
你相信我的話
You take me.

440
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:55,787
有一天，早在1896年 我正乘渡船到澤西去
One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry...

441
00:30:55,996 --> 00:30:59,207
船離開碼頭時，另一條渡船正要靠碼頭
...and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in...

442
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:02,044
船上站著一個姑娘等著下船
...and on it there was a girl waiting to get off.

443
00:31:02,878 --> 00:31:04,671
她穿著一件白色衣裙
A white dress she had on.

444
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:07,215
手堮陬菑@把白陽傘
She was carrying a white parasol.

445
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:10,010
我看她只有一眨眼的工夫
I only saw her for one second.

446
00:31:10,093 --> 00:31:15,557
而她根本沒有看見我 我打賭，從那以後沒有哪一個月…
She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since...

447
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:19,019
我沒有想著她
...that I haven't thought of that girl.

448
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,732
- 你都見到過哪些人？ - 噢，我到過亞特蘭大城
-Who else have you been to see? -Well, I went down to Atlantic City.

449
00:31:23,774 --> 00:31:25,734
蘇珊？
Susie?

450
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:27,194
謝謝
Thank you.

451
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:30,614
他去世的那天，我給她打了個電話
I called her myself the day after he died.

452
00:31:30,947 --> 00:31:33,367
我覺得，總該有人…
I thought maybe somebody ought to.

453
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,955
- 她甚至不能來接電話 - 過兩天我還要再去看她
-She couldn't even come to the phone. -I?l be seeing her again in a couple of days.

454
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,041
關於玫瑰花蕾，伯恩斯坦先生
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.

455
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:44,878
您能否就您記憶所及隨便談談 有關凱恩先生的任何事
If you'd talk about anything connected with Mr. Kane that you can remember.

456
00:31:44,962 --> 00:31:46,922
您一開始就和他在一起的
You were with him from the beginning.

457
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:52,386
在開始之前，年輕人 現在是在他死之後（假惺惺）
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.

458
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:55,764
除了蘇珊之外，你還試著找過別人嗎？
Have you tried to see anybody except Susie?

459
00:31:55,847 --> 00:32:00,185
我尚未見過其他任何人 不過我已去過華爾特·賽切爾紀念館
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've been through Walter Thatcher's journal.

460
00:32:00,268 --> 00:32:04,731
- 賽切爾！那個人是我遇見過的最大的蠢貨 - 可他發了大財
-That man was the biggest fool I ever met. -He made an awful lot of money.

461
00:32:04,815 --> 00:32:07,609
發財不需要什麼本事
Well, it's no trick to make a lot of money...

462
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:13,365
…如果你一心只是想發財
...if all you want is to make a lot of money.

463
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:21,289
就拿凱恩先生來說，他要的就不是錢
You take Mr. Kane. It wasn't money he wanted.

464
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,713
賽切爾先生從來沒能把他捉摸透 有時，甚至連我也辦不到
Thatcher never did figure him out. Sometimes even I couldn't.

465
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:31,300
你知道你該找誰談嗎？ 傑德·李蘭先生
You know who you ought to see? Mr. Leland.

466
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:34,553
他是凱恩先生生前密友 他們一道上學的
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend. They went to school together.

467
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:35,804
哈佛大學嗎？
Harvard?

468
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:39,558
哈佛，耶魯，康奈爾，普林斯頓，瑞士
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Switzerland.

469
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:42,269
他被許多大學除名
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.

470
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:45,105
李蘭先生從來都是一文不名
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.

471
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:48,442
那種老家族，父親稱其有一千萬
One of those families where the father is worth $10 million...

472
00:32:48,525 --> 00:32:52,821
可有朝一日他開槍自殺了 結果查明他除了一身債，什麼也沒有
...then one day he shoots himself, and it turns out there's nothing but debts.

473
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:56,742
凱恩先生第一天接管《問事報》報社時他和我都在場…
He was with Mr. Kane and me...

474
00:32:57,743 --> 00:33:00,662
凱恩先生第一天接管《問事報》報社時他和我都在場…
...the first day Mr. Kane took over the Inquirer.

475
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:10,839
瞧一瞧，傑德
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.

476
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,968
過些日子它將要大大改觀
It's going to look a lot different one of these days. Come on.

477
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:27,022
這座樓堥S有臥室，這是一家報社大樓
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint. That's a newspaper building.

478
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:31,902
雇你來是發表意見的，還是拉東西的？
You're getting paid, mister, for opinions or for hauling?

479
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:37,616
- 傑德 - 你先請，凱恩先生
-Jedediah. -After you, Mr. Kane.

480
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:52,047
對不起，先生，我…
Excuse me, sir, but l....

481
00:33:55,008 --> 00:33:57,386
歡迎，凱恩先生
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

482
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:02,224
歡迎到《問事報》報社來，凱恩先生
Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.

483
00:34:02,265 --> 00:34:04,559
我是赫伯特·卡特，報紙的主編
I am Herbert Carter, the editor-in-chief.

484
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:08,563
- 謝謝你，卡特先生，這位是李蘭先生 - 您好，李蘭先生！
-Thank you, Mr. Carter. This is Mr. Leland-- -How do you do, Mr. Leland?

485
00:34:08,605 --> 00:34:11,566
李蘭先生是新來的戲劇評論家 希望我沒說錯
Our new dramatic critic. I hope I haven't made a mistake.

486
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:13,860
- 戲劇評論家，對嗎？ - 是的
-It is dramatic critic, right? -That's right.

487
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:17,531
- 他們是為我起立的嗎？ - 你？噢，凱恩先生
-Are they standing for me? -You? Oh, Mr. Kane.

488
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:18,907
起立？
Standing?

489
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,575
- 你好 - 你好
-How do you do? -How do you do?

490
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,036
我覺得這是一個善意的表示
I thought it would be a nice little gesture.

491
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:26,206
- 請他們坐下，請坐下 - 對新的辦報人
-Ask them to sit down, will you, please. -The new publisher.

492
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,669
- 你們可以恢復工作了，先生們 - 謝謝
-You may resume your duties, gentlemen. -Thank you.

493
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:34,089
- 我不瞭解您的計畫 - 我也不知道我的計畫
-l didn't know your plans. -l don't know my plans myself.

494
00:34:34,423 --> 00:34:36,758
- 說實在的，我沒有任何計畫 - 沒有？
-Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans. -No?

495
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,845
就是要辦一份報
Except to get out a newspaper.

496
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,435
- 伯恩斯坦先生！ - 是的，凱恩先生
-Mr. Bernstein. -Yes, Mr. Kane.

497
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,895
卡特先生，這是伯恩斯坦先生
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.

498
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:53,984
- 伯恩斯坦先生是我的總經理 - 你好，卡特先生
-Mr. Bernstein is my general manager. -How do you do, Mr. Carter?

499
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:55,944
- 卡特先生 - 你好
-Mr. Carter. -How do you do?

500
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:59,281
- 您好，伯恩斯坦先生！ - Stein
-Yes, Mr. Bernstein. -Stein.

501
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:03,035
- 凱恩 - 卡特先生，這是你的辦公室？
-Kane. -Mr. Carter, is this your office?

502
00:35:03,118 --> 00:35:07,247
我那小小的私室可供閣下使用
My little private sanctum is at your disposal.

503
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:10,751
- 讓一下 - 不過我不明白…
-Excuse me. -But I don't think I understand.

504
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:15,130
卡特先生，我以後就住在這兒 住多久看工作需要再說
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here in your office as long as I have to.

505
00:35:16,256 --> 00:35:18,216
住在這兒？是嗎？
Live here? Yes?

506
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,261
- 讓一下 - 但是一家晨報，畢竟…
-Excuse me. -But a morning newspaper, after all--

507
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:22,179
讓一下
Excuse me.

508
00:35:22,262 --> 00:35:26,141
我們一天有十二個小時是關閉的
We're practically closed for 12 hours a day.

509
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:29,561
這是我認為需要改變的一件事
That's one of the things that's going to have to be changed here.

510
00:35:29,645 --> 00:35:33,190
- 新聞是一天二十四小時都有的 - 二十四小時？
-The news goes on for 24 hours a day. -24?

511
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:36,652
- 是的 - 讓一下
-That's right. -Excuse me.

512
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,445
怎麼可能…
It's impossible....

513
00:35:38,487 --> 00:35:43,533
我畫好了卡通 我對漫畫不在行
I've drawn that cartoon. I'm no good as a cartoonist.

514
00:35:43,617 --> 00:35:45,202
你當然不是
You certainly aren't.

515
00:35:45,285 --> 00:35:47,120
你是戲劇評論家，李蘭
You're the dramatic critic, Leland.

516
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:49,164
- 你還在吃呢？ - 我沒吃飽呢！
-You still eating? -I? still hungry.

517
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:51,708
我不是批評你，卡特先生 《紀實報》上有一個頭版故事
Here's a front-page story in the Chronicle...

518
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:54,920
布魯克林區一位叫西佛爾斯東的婦女失蹤了
...about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone in Brooklyn who's missing.

519
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:59,633
她可能是被謀殺了 為什麼《問事報》今天早上沒有登？
She's probably murdered. Why isn't there something about it in the Inquirer?

520
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:01,510
我們辦的是新聞報…
We're running a newspaper...

521
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:04,513
- 傑德，我都快餓昏了 -…而不是什麼醜聞小報
-I? absolutely starving to death. -...not a scandal sheet.

522
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:06,640
好的
That's all right.

523
00:36:06,682 --> 00:36:10,686
卡特先生，《紀實報》用了三欄標題
Mr. Carter, here is a three-column headline in the Chronicle.

524
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,313
為什麼我們沒有用？
Why hasn't the Inquirer a three-column headline?

525
00:36:13,397 --> 00:36:14,856
這件新聞不夠大
The news wasn't big enough.

526
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,695
卡特先生，只要標題夠大 也就能使新聞夠大
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough, it makes the news big enough.

527
00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:22,364
- 就是！ - 關於西佛爾斯東太太被謀殺…
-That's right! -The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone--

528
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,658
沒有事實證明這個女人是被謀害了 甚至不能證明她已死了
There's no proof that she was murdered, or dead.

529
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,577
《紀實報》說她失蹤了，鄰居們開始懷疑
It says she's missing. The neighbors are getting suspicious.

530
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:30,539
我們的職責不是報導家庭婦女的閒話
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.

531
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:34,876
如果我們對這類事發生興趣 我們的報紙的內容每天可多一倍
If we were interested in that kind of thing, we could fill the paper twice over, daily.

532
00:36:34,918 --> 00:36:38,297
從今天起我們就要對這類東西發生興趣了 卡特先生
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on.

533
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,341
我希望你派一名最精幹的人 去找西佛爾斯東先生
I want you to send your best man to see Mr. Silverstone.

534
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:45,304
讓他跟西佛爾斯東先生說， 如果他不立即交出他的妻子…
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone...

535
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:47,472
…《問事報》就要設法使他進牢房
...the Inquirer will have him arrested.

536
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:50,017
叫他告訴西佛爾斯東 說他是一名偵探…
Tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from....

537
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,561
- 隸屬於中央署 - 中央署
-Central Office. -The Central Office.

538
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:57,399
如果西佛爾斯東先生起了疑心 要看他的證章
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious and asks to see your man's badge...

539
00:36:57,482 --> 00:37:01,320
你的人就裝出憤慨的樣子 把西佛爾斯東先生叫作無政府主義者
...your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.

540
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:04,781
要大聲地喊，讓左右鄰居都能聽到 你想吃飯嗎，傑德？
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear. You ready for dinner, Jedediah?

541
00:37:04,865 --> 00:37:08,118
凱恩先生，我沒法相信 一家受人尊重的報紙的職責…
I can't see that the function of a respectable newspaper--

542
00:37:08,243 --> 00:37:11,371
卡特先生，你是最能領會的，再見
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter. Goodbye.

543
00:37:11,955 --> 00:37:13,206
再見
Goodbye.

544
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:16,752
報紙！快來看！
Paper! Read all about it!

545
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:19,921
快來看今早出版的《紀實報》
Read all about it in the early morning Chronicle.

546
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:22,466
布魯克林女士消失之謎
The mystery of the lady that vanished in Brooklyn.

547
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:26,386
快來看今早出版的《紀實報》
Read all about it in the early morning Chronicle.

548
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:43,695
我們的報紙就要上街了，查利，再過十分鐘
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie, another 10 minutes.

549
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,531
晚了三小時五十分，不過我們已完成了
Three hours and 50 minutes late, but we did it.

550
00:37:46,615 --> 00:37:48,158
- 累了嗎？ - 這一天可真夠瞧的
-Tired? -A tough day.

551
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:49,868
- 浪費掉的一天 - 浪費掉的？
-A wasted day. -Wasted?

552
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:52,871
你今晚改了四次版，就是這麼回事
You only made the paper over four times tonight, that's all.

553
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:56,583
我把頭版稍稍改了一下，伯恩斯坦先生 這不夠
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough.

554
00:37:56,625 --> 00:38:00,879
除了照片和文字以外 我還要給這份報搞點兒什麼東西
There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print.

555
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:04,591
我要讓《問事報》對紐約的重要性就象
I've got to make the New York Inquirer as important to New York...

556
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:06,551
…點燃那個燈的煤氣一樣重要
...as the gas in that light.

557
00:38:07,177 --> 00:38:08,971
那你想怎麼辦呢，查利？
What are you going to do, Charlie?

558
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:13,225
我的原則宣言，別笑，傑德
My Declaration of Principles. Don't smile, Jedediah.

559
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:16,103
我已經把它寫在這
I've got it all written out here.

560
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:19,690
你千萬別作出你不準備履行的諾言
You don't want to make any promises you don't want to keep.

561
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:21,441
這些是要履行的
These'll be kept.

562
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:24,820
我要向本市居民提供一份…
"I?l provide the people of this city...

563
00:38:25,153 --> 00:38:28,740
…日報，它要忠實地報導新聞
"...with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.

564
00:38:29,992 --> 00:38:33,328
-“我還要向他們提供…” - 這是第二句你用“我”來開始的
-"l will also provide--" -That's two sentences starting with "l."

565
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:35,998
人們該知道是誰在負責
People will know who's responsible...

566
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:40,127
“他們會從《問事報》中得到真實的新聞 快速、簡單而又有趣味”
...and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer, quickly, simply and entertainingly.

567
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,588
“不允許有任何特殊利益來乾預這些新聞”
No special interests will be allowed to interfere with that truth.

568
00:38:43,672 --> 00:38:47,551
“我還將向他們提供一個 為市民和人的權利而進行…”
"l will also provide them with a fighting and tireless champion of their rights...

569
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:50,262
“不倦鬥爭的鬥士”
"...as citizens and as human beings."

570
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,222
簽字?
Signed:

571
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:55,183
“查理斯·福斯特·凱恩”
"Charles Foster Kane."

572
00:38:57,144 --> 00:38:59,813
- 能把它給我嗎，查利？ - 我要登出去
-Can I have that, Charlie? -I? going to print it.

573
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:01,356
薩利！
Solly!

574
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:03,442
是的，凱恩先生？
Yes, Mr. Kane?

575
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:06,361
這是一篇編者的話 我要它擺在頭版的花邊新聞
I want you to run this editorial in a box on the front page.

576
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:07,946
今天的頭版嗎，凱恩先生？
This morning's front page?

577
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,074
對的，薩利，我們又要重新排了
That's right, Solly, that means we'll have to remake again.

578
00:39:11,158 --> 00:39:12,993
- 好的 - 下去通知他們
-Yes. -Go down and tell them.

579
00:39:13,035 --> 00:39:14,369
- 好的 - 薩利
All right.

580
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:18,332
你們用完之後，我想把它要回來
When you're through with that, I'd like to have it back.

581
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:23,378
我願意親自保存那張底稿
I'd like to keep that particular piece of paper myself.

582
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,507
我有一種預兆，它會成為十分重要的文獻
I have a hunch it might turn out to be something pretty important.

583
00:39:27,758 --> 00:39:29,968
- 一個文獻… - 真的
-A document... -Sure.

584
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:33,472
就象獨立宣言，象憲法…
...like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution...

585
00:39:34,222 --> 00:39:36,808
象我上學的第一張成績單
...and my first report card at school.

586
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:08,423
先生們，我知道你們累了 但是我帶你們到這堥茯O有緣故的
I know you're tired, gentlemen, but I brought you here for a reason.

587
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:12,135
- 這次小小的巡禮會對我們有好處的 -《紀實報》是一家好報紙
-This little pilgrimage will do us good. -The Chronicle's a good newspaper.

588
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:15,305
他們辦報的思想很好，注意它的發行份數
Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper. Notice the circulation.

589
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:20,268
-495,000份 可是你看看誰在為《紀實報》工作
-495,000. But look who's working for the Chronicle.

590
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:23,563
- 有這樣一些人，贏得發行量可不是怪事 - 你說得對，伯恩斯坦先生
-With them, it's no trick to get circulation. -You're right.

591
00:40:23,772 --> 00:40:27,067
你知道《紀實報》花了多長時間 才湊起這樣一個班子
You know how long it took the Chronicle to get that staff together?

592
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:29,903
- 二十年 - 二十年？
-Twenty years. -Twenty years?

593
00:40:30,445 --> 00:40:35,534
六年前，我看到了一張 世界上最強大的新聞界人士的照片
Six years ago, I looked at a picture of the world's greatest newspaper men.

594
00:40:35,617 --> 00:40:37,828
我感到好象是一個孩子站在糖果店櫥窗前
I felt like a kid in front of a candy store.

595
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:41,915
今晚，六年以後，我得到了我的糖果 所有的糖果
Tonight, six years later, I got my candy, all of it.

596
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:44,418
先生們，歡迎來到《問事報》
Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.

597
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:47,587
加印一份給《紀實報》寄去
Make an extra copy of that picture and mail it to the Chronicle.

598
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:52,592
你們會高興地知道 今早我們的發行份數是…
It'll make you all happy to learn that our circulation this morning...

599
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:55,470
紐約最高的——684,000份
...was the greatest in New York: 684,000.

600
00:40:56,972 --> 00:40:59,975
-684,132份
-684,132.

601
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:01,393
對
Right.

602
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:05,605
希望你們能恕我無禮 就這樣離開你們
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness in taking leave of you.

603
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:08,150
我將於下周出國度假
I'm going abroad next week for a vacation.

604
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:11,778
我早就答應我的醫生 一旦有可能就出國度假
I've promised my doctor for sometime that I would leave when I could.

605
00:41:11,862 --> 00:41:13,822
我現在知道，這是不可能的
I now realize I can't.

606
00:41:14,364 --> 00:41:16,992
我說，凱恩先生，既然你在許願…
Say, Mr. Kane, as long as you're promising...

607
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:20,996
歐洲還有許多雕像有待您去買下來
...there's a lot of pictures and statues in Europe you ain't bought yet.

608
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:23,081
這你不能怪我，伯恩斯坦先生
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.

609
00:41:23,498 --> 00:41:26,168
他們搞了兩千年的雕像
They've been making statues for 2,000 years.

610
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:28,337
可我買雕像只有五年時間啊
And I've only been buying for five.

611
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,964
- 答應我，凱恩先生 - 我向您保證，伯恩斯坦先生
-Promise me, Mr. Kane. -l promise, Mr. Bernstein.

612
00:41:31,048 --> 00:41:33,884
- 謝謝您 - 伯恩斯坦先生？
-Thank you. -Mr. Bernstein?

613
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:37,220
你不至於期待我烙守任何諾言吧？
You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you?

614
00:41:39,014 --> 00:41:41,141
好啦，先生們！
And now, gentlemen!

615
00:41:41,183 --> 00:41:44,436
請大家注意啦！
Your complete attention, if you please.

616
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:53,445
先生們，我們要對西班牙宣戰嗎？
Are we going to declare war on Spain?

617
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:04,831
天啦，她們來了，太開心了！
Oh, mama, here they come. Shoot me while I'm happy.

618
00:42:13,006 --> 00:42:18,303
我剛才說，“我們要不要向西班牙宣戰？”
I said, "Are we going to declare war on Spain, or are we not?"

619
00:42:18,387 --> 00:42:20,222
《問事報》已經宣戰了
The Inquirer already has.

620
00:42:20,555 --> 00:42:24,393
你這個繃著臉、衣著講究的無政府主義者
You long-faced, overdressed anarchist.

621
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:26,395
我沒有過分講究穿著
I'm not overdressed.

622
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,690
你也是，伯恩斯坦先生，瞧你打的領帶
You are, too. Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.

623
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:31,942
我們來聽聽查利的讚歌
Let's have the song about Charlie.

624
00:42:32,025 --> 00:42:35,404
- 有查利的讚歌嗎？ - 凱恩先生，有你的讚歌嗎？
-Is there a song about Charlie? -Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?

625
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:39,825
你在城媔R一袋花生 就有人為你寫首讚歌
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town, you get a song written about you.

626
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,004
我見過那個人，很不錯
I've seen that fellow. He's good.

627
00:42:52,212 --> 00:42:53,588
凱恩先生，晚上好
Good evening, Mr. Kane.

628
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:56,633
這兒有個紳士，真正的紳士
"There is a man, a certain man

629
00:42:56,842 --> 00:43:00,178
對窮人他會竭盡所能
"And for the poor you may be sure that he'll do all he can

630
00:43:00,304 --> 00:43:03,765
他是誰？就是這個幸運兒
"Who is this one? This favorite son

631
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:06,768
略施小計，就讓大人物們手忙腳亂
"Just by his action has the traction magnates on the run

632
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:10,147
他愛吸煙，愛開玩笑
"Who loves to smoke, enjoys a joke

633
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:13,400
即使受到打擊，也不會有絲毫心煩
"Who wouldn't get a bit upset if he were really broke

634
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:16,737
有名有利，卻一如既往
"With wealth and fame he's still the same

635
00:43:16,778 --> 00:43:20,324
我敢打賭，還沒有人不知道他的名字
"I?l bet you $5 you're not alive if you don't know his name

636
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:27,581
他的名字叫什麼
"What is his name?

637
00:43:27,623 --> 00:43:30,167
就是查利·凱恩，凱恩先生
"It抯 Charlie Kane, it's Mister Kane!

638
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:34,087
“他不喜歡做先生 卻喜歡做和藹可親的老凱恩”
"He doesn't like that Mister He likes good old Charlie Kane"

639
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:52,773
- 真熱鬧啊，是嗎？多熱鬧的宴會！ - 是啊
-Isn抰 it wonderful? Such a party. -Yes.

640
00:43:52,814 --> 00:43:54,608
怎麼回事兒？
What's the matter?

641
00:43:54,775 --> 00:43:58,070
他說天生女人獨為吻
"Who says a miss was made to kiss

642
00:43:58,153 --> 00:44:01,406
碰上女士他就想如此
"And when he meets one always tries to do exactly this

643
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,534
他買吃的，他買喝的
"Who buys the food, who buys the drinks

644
00:44:04,618 --> 00:44:07,996
他認為有錢能使鬼推磨
"Who thinks that dough was made to spend and acts the way he thinks

645
00:44:08,038 --> 00:44:10,791
“他在幹什麼，喬伊，不，不”
"Now is it, Joe, no, no, no"

646
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,169
伯恩斯坦，現在到《問事報》來的那些人
Bernstein, these men who are now with the Inquirer...

647
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:16,964
…昨天還是《紀實報》的人
...who were with the Chronicle until yesterday--

648
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:18,674
噢，媽呀，拜託
Oh, mama, please.

649
00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:20,300
- 給我那個 - 什麼？金髮美女？
-Give me that. -What? The blonde?

650
00:44:20,342 --> 00:44:24,012
- 不，是黑美女 - 查理，你從哪學的？
-No, the brunette. -Where did you learn that, Charlie?

651
00:44:25,305 --> 00:44:28,475
伯恩斯坦，難道這些《紀實報》的人…
Bernstein, these men who were with the Chronicle...

652
00:44:28,558 --> 00:44:31,645
不是同樣忠心於《紀實報》
...weren't they just as devoted to the Chronicle policy...

653
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,981
…象忠心於我們一樣？
...as they are now to our policies?

654
00:44:34,064 --> 00:44:36,817
當然，他們也是人
Sure, they're just like anybody else.

655
00:44:37,025 --> 00:44:39,111
給他們什麼工作他們就做什麼工作
They got work to do, they do it.

656
00:44:39,403 --> 00:44:42,364
只不過他們正巧是這行中的好手
Only they happen to be the best men in the business.

657
00:44:50,706 --> 00:44:55,043
我們的主張和《紀實報》的一樣嗎 伯恩斯坦？
Do we stand for the same things the Chronicle stands for?

658
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,004
當然不
Certainly not.

659
00:44:58,005 --> 00:45:03,051
那有什麼關係？凱恩先生會在一周內 把他們變成他想要的那種新聞工作者
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

660
00:45:03,218 --> 00:45:07,055
當然，也有可能他們會改變凱恩先生
There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane.

661
00:45:07,723 --> 00:45:09,141
通過潛移默化的方式
Without his knowing it.

662
00:45:12,602 --> 00:45:16,189
李蘭先生，凱恩先生髮電報來了！
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane!

663
00:45:18,608 --> 00:45:21,320
- 凱恩先生髮電報來了 - 什麼？
-l got a cable here from Mr. Kane. -What?

664
00:45:21,403 --> 00:45:23,322
- 法國巴黎發過來的 - 什麼？
-From Paris, France. -What?

665
00:45:23,405 --> 00:45:26,408
- 法國巴黎發過來的 - 進來
-From Paris, France. -Come on in.

666
00:45:27,326 --> 00:45:32,247
“略施小計，就讓大人物們手忙腳亂”
"Who by his action has the traction magnates on the run"

667
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:37,711
太好了，他答應不再送雕像回來了
It's a good thing he promised not to send back any more statues.

668
00:45:39,046 --> 00:45:41,757
看，他想買世界上最大的鑽石
Look, he wants to buy the world's biggest diamond.

669
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,385
李蘭先生，你為什麼不去歐洲和他在一起？ 他想要你去
Why didn't you go to Europe with him? He wanted you to.

670
00:45:45,469 --> 00:45:48,221
我希望他玩得痛快，有我陪著他…
I wanted Charlie to have fun, with me along....

671
00:45:48,388 --> 00:45:50,557
伯恩斯坦，我是一個擺臭架子的人嗎？
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?

672
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:55,354
我是一個裝模作樣的偽君子嗎？ 我是新英格蘭的假道學先生嗎？
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite? Am I a New England schoolmarm?

673
00:45:56,104 --> 00:45:57,439
是的
Yes.

674
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:03,236
如果你以為我說的會和凱恩先生不同 那麼你就錯了
If you thought I'd answer you different from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.

675
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,780
“世界上最大的鑽石”
"World's biggest diamond."

676
00:46:04,821 --> 00:46:07,199
我還不知道查利在收集鑽石
I didn't know Charlie was collecting diamonds.

677
00:46:07,282 --> 00:46:08,784
他不收集鑽石
He ain't.

678
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:12,079
他是在收集那些收集鑽石的人
He's collecting somebody that's collecting diamonds.

679
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:15,624
不管怎麼說，他不僅僅收藏雕像
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.

680
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:19,795
歡迎凱恩先生歸來
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane...

681
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:23,632
“…紐約《問事報》467名雇員贈”
"...from 467 employees of the New York Inquirer."

682
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:25,258
他來了！
Here he comes!

683
00:46:29,304 --> 00:46:31,098
歡迎，凱恩先生
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

684
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,725
- 我知道我留了小鬍子 - 看起來很糟糕
-l know I've a moustache. -It looks awful.

685
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:37,396
我們有社交編輯了嗎？
Have we got a society editor?

686
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:40,399
- 在這堙A凱恩先生 - 唐珊德小姐就是社交編輯
-Right here, Mr. Kane. -Miss Townsend is the society editor.

687
00:46:40,482 --> 00:46:43,151
唐珊德小姐 這是查理斯·福斯特·凱恩先生！
Miss Townsend, this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane.

688
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:48,448
唐珊德小姐，我離開了很長時間 所以我不瞭解需要什麼手續
Miss Townsend, I've been away so long. I don't know your routine.

689
00:46:49,616 --> 00:46:52,744
這埵酗@個小小的社交啟事
I got a little social announcement.

690
00:46:52,828 --> 00:46:56,790
我希望你按正常程式處理這份啟事
I wish you wouldn't treat this any differently than you would any other...

691
00:46:56,999 --> 00:46:58,625
…不要有任何差別
...social announcement.

692
00:46:59,293 --> 00:47:02,337
凱恩先生，我代表《問事報》的全體雇員…
Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees of the Inquirer--

693
00:47:02,421 --> 00:47:05,966
伯恩斯坦先生，非常感謝你，感謝大家…
Mr. Bernstein, thank you very much, everybody, l....

694
00:47:06,842 --> 00:47:10,971
很抱歉，我現在還不能接受它
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.

695
00:47:11,138 --> 00:47:12,597
再見
Goodbye.

696
00:47:13,265 --> 00:47:15,475
我說，他可真夠急的啊！
Say, he was in an awful hurry.

697
00:47:16,435 --> 00:47:18,562
嗨，大家來！到這兒來看！
Hey, everybody, look out here.

698
00:47:18,687 --> 00:47:20,647
到窗口看看
Let's go to the window.

699
00:47:20,856 --> 00:47:23,775
- 李蘭先生！伯恩斯坦先生！ - 什麼事，唐珊德小姐？
-Mr. Leland! Mr. Bernstein! -Yes, Ms. Townsend?

700
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:26,695
這份啟事? 湯姆斯·蒙羅·諾頓先生和夫人…
This announcement: "Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton...

701
00:47:26,778 --> 00:47:30,324
宣佈他們的女兒愛米麗·蒙羅·諾頓…
"...announce the engagement of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...

702
00:47:30,407 --> 00:47:32,159
“與查理斯·福斯特·凱恩先生的婚約”
"...to Mr. Charles Foster Kane."

703
00:47:32,242 --> 00:47:33,785
快來
Come on.

704
00:47:36,288 --> 00:47:41,168
愛米麗·蒙羅·諾頓，她是美國總統的侄女
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece of the President of the United States.

705
00:47:41,376 --> 00:47:43,253
總統的侄女？
President's niece?

706
00:47:43,545 --> 00:47:46,882
要不了多久，她會成為總統夫人！
Before he's through, she'll be a president's wife.

707
00:47:55,223 --> 00:47:58,644
事情的結局，我無須多說
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you.

708
00:47:58,727 --> 00:48:01,438
愛米麗·諾頓小姐不是玫瑰花蕾！
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.

709
00:48:01,563 --> 00:48:03,649
結局不太好，是嗎？
It didn't end very well, did it?

710
00:48:04,066 --> 00:48:05,359
分手了
It ended.

711
00:48:06,443 --> 00:48:09,946
然後是蘇茜，也分手了
Then there was Susie. That ended, too.

712
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,868
你知道，湯姆遜先生，我在考慮…
You know, Mr. Thompson, I was thinking...

713
00:48:15,702 --> 00:48:18,622
你想查明白那個玫瑰花蕾…
...this Rosebud you're trying to find out about....

714
00:48:19,873 --> 00:48:21,208
怎麼樣？
Yes?

715
00:48:25,587 --> 00:48:28,006
也許那是他失去的什麼東西
Maybe that was something he lost.

716
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,219
凱恩先生這個人，幾乎失去了所有的一切
Mr. Kane was a man who lost almost everything he had.

717
00:48:32,886 --> 00:48:35,138
你該和傑德·李蘭先生談談
You ought to see Jed Leland.

718
00:48:35,222 --> 00:48:38,392
當然，他和凱恩先生並非完全志同道合
Of course, he and Mr. Kane didn't exactly see eye to eye.

719
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:40,477
就拿西美戰爭來說吧
You take the Spanish-American war.

720
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,939
我看李蘭先生是對的，那是凱恩先生的戰爭
I guess Mr. Leland was right. That was Mr. Kane's war.

721
00:48:43,981 --> 00:48:46,984
我們沒有什麼可為之而戰的
We didn't really have anything to fight about.

722
00:48:47,776 --> 00:48:51,363
不過，如果沒有凱恩先生的那場戰爭…
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war of Mr. Kane's...

723
00:48:51,655 --> 00:48:54,408
…你認為我們能得到巴拿馬運河嗎？
...we'd have the Panama Canal?

724
00:48:55,075 --> 00:48:57,577
但願我知道李蘭先生現在的下落
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.

725
00:48:58,161 --> 00:49:01,331
長時間以來他們不再告訴我這類事情
A lot of the time now they don't tell me these things.

726
00:49:02,624 --> 00:49:04,459
也許他已經死了
Maybe even he's dead.

727
00:49:04,584 --> 00:49:06,295
如果你想知道，伯恩斯坦先生
In case you'd like to know...

728
00:49:06,378 --> 00:49:09,339
他現在在第180號街的亨丁頓紀念醫院
...he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.

729
00:49:09,423 --> 00:49:10,924
真的嗎！我還以為…
You don't say. I had--

730
00:49:10,966 --> 00:49:13,885
他們說，他沒有什麼特殊的病，只不過…
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me, just....

731
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:16,555
只不過是上了年紀
Just old age.

732
00:49:17,848 --> 00:49:22,769
湯姆遜先生，這是唯一一種 你沒有指望能治得好的病
It's the only disease that you don't look forward to being cured of.

733
00:49:34,865 --> 00:49:37,743
我什麼都記得，年青人
I can remember absolutely everything, young man.

734
00:49:37,826 --> 00:49:39,119
這是對我的詛咒
That's my curse.

735
00:49:39,161 --> 00:49:43,749
這是人類所遭受的最大的詛咒：記憶
That's one of the greatest curses ever inflicted on the human race: memory.

736
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:49,546
我是他最老的朋友 就他跟我的關係來說，他的表現象豬玀
I was his oldest friend, and as far as I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.

737
00:49:49,796 --> 00:49:53,884
倒不是說查利生性粗暴 但是他做出了粗暴的事情
Not that Charlie was ever brutal. He just did brutal things.

738
00:49:54,676 --> 00:49:58,930
也許我不是他的朋友 如果我不是，那他就一個朋友也沒有
Maybe I wasn't his friend, but if I wasn't, he never had one.

739
00:49:59,181 --> 00:50:02,809
也許我就是你們今天叫作小丑的那種人
Maybe I was what you nowadays call a stooge.

740
00:50:02,851 --> 00:50:05,228
李蘭先生，你對玫瑰花蕾知道些什麼？
You were about to say something about Rosebud.

741
00:50:05,312 --> 00:50:07,522
你是否正巧帶著雪茄？
Do you happen to have a good cigar?

742
00:50:07,606 --> 00:50:11,485
給我看病的那個年輕醫生認為我該戒煙
I've got a young physician here who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.

743
00:50:11,526 --> 00:50:13,862
很抱歉，我沒有
No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sorry.

744
00:50:14,196 --> 00:50:15,864
我改變了話題，是嗎？
I changed the subject, didn't l?

745
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:18,408
我成了一個多麼令人討嫌的老人啊
What a disagreeable old man I have become.

746
00:50:19,368 --> 00:50:24,206
你是記者，想知道我對查利·凱恩的看法
You're a reporter and you want to know what I think about Charlie Kane.

747
00:50:27,626 --> 00:50:30,170
我認為他有自己的偉大之處
I suppose he had some private sort of greatness.

748
00:50:30,212 --> 00:50:31,964
不過，他太自私
But he kept it to himself.

749
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:35,008
他絕不會委屈自己 也不會捨棄任何東西
He never gave himself away. He never gave anything away.

750
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,053
他只是給你點兒甜頭
He just left you a tip.

751
00:50:39,554 --> 00:50:40,931
他思路開闊
He had a generous mind.

752
00:50:41,014 --> 00:50:44,184
我看從來沒有人有他那樣多的主意
I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.

753
00:50:44,476 --> 00:50:47,187
但是他除了查利·凱恩以外誰也不相信
But he never believed in anything except Charlie Kane.

754
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,899
他一生除了查利·凱恩，什麼信仰也沒有
He never had a conviction except Charlie Kane in his life.

755
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:53,402
我猜他到死也沒有
I suppose he died without one.

756
00:50:53,568 --> 00:50:56,154
那一定是很糟糕的
That must have been pretty unpleasant.

757
00:50:56,488 --> 00:51:01,159
當然，不少人離開這個世界時 對於死亡是沒有什麼信仰的
Of course, a lot of us check out without having any special convictions about death.

758
00:51:01,243 --> 00:51:04,496
但是我們知道自己留下了什麼 我們有某種信仰
But we do know what we're leaving. We do believe in something.

759
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:08,208
你肯定身邊沒帶雪茄嗎？
Are you absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?

760
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:10,377
- 很遺憾，李蘭先生 - 沒關係
-Sorry, Mr. Leland. -Never mind.

761
00:51:10,419 --> 00:51:14,047
- 李蘭先生，你對玫瑰花蕾知道些什麼？ -“玫瑰花蕾”？
-What do you know about Rosebud? -"Rosebud"?

762
00:51:15,048 --> 00:51:18,260
他的臨終遺言?“玫瑰花蕾”
His dying words: "Rosebud."

763
00:51:18,593 --> 00:51:20,721
我在《問事報》上看到的
I saw that in the Inquirer.

764
00:51:21,722 --> 00:51:24,725
不過我從來不相信《問事報》上的任何東西
I never believed anything I saw in the Inquirer.

765
00:51:24,766 --> 00:51:26,226
還有別的事嗎？
Anything else?

766
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:29,980
我可以和你談談愛米麗 我曾經和她一起上過舞蹈學校
I can tell you about Emily. I went to dancing school with Emily.

767
00:51:30,397 --> 00:51:32,149
我是文質彬彬的
I was very graceful.

768
00:51:33,108 --> 00:51:36,486
- 我們在談第一位凱恩夫人 - 她怎麼樣？
-We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane. -What was she like?

769
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:39,072
和我在舞蹈學校婸{識的其他姑娘一樣
She was like all the girls I knew in dancing school.

770
00:51:39,156 --> 00:51:42,200
全都是好姑娘，愛米麗更好一點
Very nice girl. Emily was a little nicer.

771
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,746
在結婚兩個月以後…
After the first couple of months...

772
00:51:45,787 --> 00:51:50,125
…她和查利除了吃早餐以外，很少見面
...she and Charlie didn't see much of each other except at breakfast.

773
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:53,420
他們的婚姻和其他人的一樣
It was a marriage just like any other marriage.

774
00:52:03,639 --> 00:52:05,349
- 你真美 - 過獎了
-You're beautiful. -l can't be.

775
00:52:05,432 --> 00:52:07,184
你的確很漂亮
Yes, you are. You're very beautiful.

776
00:52:07,267 --> 00:52:09,811
我過去從來沒有一個晚上參加過六個宴會
I've never been to six parties in one night before.

777
00:52:10,062 --> 00:52:12,814
- 我也從來沒有這樣晚才起床 - 這只是個習慣問題
-I've never been up this late. -It抯 a matter of habit.

778
00:52:12,898 --> 00:52:15,859
- 僕人們會怎麼看？ - 認為我們過得愉快啊，對嗎？
-What will the servants think? -That we enjoyed ourselves.

779
00:52:15,942 --> 00:52:18,445
你為什麼要馬上去報館？
Why do you have to go straight off to the newspaper?

780
00:52:18,528 --> 00:52:22,240
你真不該嫁給一個辦報的人 他們比水手還糟
You never should've married a newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.

781
00:52:23,158 --> 00:52:25,077
我絕對地愛你
I absolutely adore you.

782
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:28,830
查理斯，就是辦報人也得睡覺嘛
Charles, even newspapermen have to sleep.

783
00:52:30,332 --> 00:52:33,752
那我給伯恩斯坦打個電話 讓他把我的約會推遲到中午
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him put off my appointments till noon.

784
00:52:35,087 --> 00:52:36,171
現在幾點鐘啦？
What time is it?

785
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:38,465
不知道，很晚了
I don't know. It's late.

786
00:52:40,842 --> 00:52:42,803
是很早了
It's early.

787
00:52:42,886 --> 00:52:44,596
查理斯…
Charles....

788
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,183
你知道昨晚你讓我等了多久嗎？
Do you know how long you kept me waiting last night...

789
00:52:48,225 --> 00:52:51,061
你說要去報社十分鐘？
...when you went to the newspaper for 10 minutes?

790
00:52:51,311 --> 00:52:54,481
你深更半夜在報社媟F什麼？
What do you do in a newspaper in the middle of the night?

791
00:52:54,648 --> 00:52:59,653
親愛的，你唯一的通訊員就是《問事報》
My dear, your only correspondent is the Inquirer.

792
00:52:59,695 --> 00:53:02,531
有時候我更喜歡血肉之爭
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival of flesh and blood.

793
00:53:02,572 --> 00:53:05,158
在報紙上我可沒花那麼多時間
I don't spend that much time on the newspaper.

794
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,329
不是時間的問題 而是你印刷出來的東西，是在攻擊總統
It isn't just the time. It's what you print, attacking the President.

795
00:53:09,371 --> 00:53:12,624
- 你是指約翰叔叔 - 我是指美國總統
-You mean Uncle John. -l mean the President of the United States.

796
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:15,168
他還是約翰叔叔，一個好心腸的傻子…
He's still Uncle John and a well-meaning fathead...

797
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:18,630
他讓一夥兒不要命的騙子來管理他的政府
...who's letting a pack of high-pressure crooks run his administration.

798
00:53:18,714 --> 00:53:22,509
- 整個石油醜聞… - 恰巧是他當總統，查理斯，而不是你
-This whole oil scandal-- -He happens to be the President, not you.

799
00:53:22,551 --> 00:53:25,387
這個錯誤早晚要糾正過來
That's a mistake that will be corrected one of these days.

800
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:30,726
你的那位伯恩斯坦先生昨天給小凱恩 帶來了極度的不愉快
Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior the most incredible atrocity yesterday.

801
00:53:31,727 --> 00:53:34,396
我絕對不能允許這種情況出現在保育園
I simply can't have it in the nursery.

802
00:53:36,523 --> 00:53:39,818
伯恩斯坦先生只是偶爾去保育園看看
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit to the nursery now and then.

803
00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:41,486
非去不可嗎？
Does he have to?

804
00:53:42,529 --> 00:53:43,572
是的
Yes.

805
00:53:43,697 --> 00:53:48,118
- 真的，查理別人會想… - 那得要看我讓他們怎麼想
-Really, Charles, people will think-- -What I tell them to think.

806
00:54:06,928 --> 00:54:08,972
難道他不曾愛過她嗎？
Wasn't he ever in love with her?

807
00:54:09,139 --> 00:54:10,891
他是為愛情而結婚的
He married for love.

808
00:54:11,808 --> 00:54:13,185
愛情
Love.

809
00:54:13,852 --> 00:54:15,562
所以他什麼事都做了
That is why he did everything.

810
00:54:15,646 --> 00:54:18,607
所以他又去搞政治了 仿佛有了我們這些人還不夠
That's why he went into politics. It seems we weren't enough.

811
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:21,735
他還要所有的選民也都愛他
He wanted all the voters to love him, too.

812
00:54:22,444 --> 00:54:24,946
他真正從生活中所要求的就是愛
All he wanted out of life was love.

813
00:54:25,781 --> 00:54:28,992
查利的故事就是：他怎樣失去了愛
That's Charlie's story. How he lost it.

814
00:54:29,201 --> 00:54:32,412
你知道嗎？他就是不願意付出（愛）
You see, he just didn't have any to give.

815
00:54:33,413 --> 00:54:36,208
當然，他愛查利·凱恩
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.

816
00:54:36,792 --> 00:54:38,210
非常愛
Very dearly.

817
00:54:38,961 --> 00:54:41,171
還有他的母親，我猜他始終愛她的
And his mother, I guess he always loved her.

818
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:44,299
- 那麼他的第二位妻子呢？ - 蘇珊·亞歷山大嗎？
-How about his second wife? -Susan Alexander?

819
00:54:45,092 --> 00:54:47,260
你知道查利把她稱作什麼？
You know what Charlie called her?

820
00:54:47,469 --> 00:54:50,222
他遇見她後的第二天，跟我談到她
The day after he'd met her, he told me about her.

821
00:54:50,389 --> 00:54:55,310
他說她是“美國公眾的橫截面” （指很一般的人）
He said she was "a cross-section of the American public."

822
00:54:57,521 --> 00:55:01,149
我猜他是不由自主了 她準有什麼東西吸引住了他
I guess he couldn't help it. She must have had something for him.

823
00:55:01,316 --> 00:55:04,069
第一次見面的晚上，據查利說…
That first night, according to Charlie...

824
00:55:05,153 --> 00:55:07,489
她就是牙痛
...all she had was a toothache.

825
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,064
有什麼可笑的？
What are you laughing at, young lady?

826
00:55:42,941 --> 00:55:45,694
- 你怎麼回事？ - 牙痛
-What's the matter with you? -Toothache.

827
00:55:45,777 --> 00:55:47,529
- 什麼？ - 牙痛
-What? -Toothache.

828
00:55:47,612 --> 00:55:48,947
牙痛？
Toothache?

829
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:54,411
你是說你牙痛
You mean you've got a toothache.

830
00:55:55,329 --> 00:55:58,206
- 有什麼可笑的？ - 你很好笑，先生
-What's funny about that? -You're funny, mister.

831
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,876
- 你臉上有髒東西 - 不是髒東西，是泥巴
-You've got dirt on your face. -Not dirt, it's mud.

832
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:03,253
你想要點熱水嗎？我就住在這
Do you want some hot water? I live right here.

833
00:56:03,337 --> 00:56:05,297
什麼意思，小姐？
What's that, young lady?

834
00:56:06,548 --> 00:56:09,009
我是說，如果你想進來洗洗臉…
I said, if you wanted some hot water...

835
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:13,472
…我可以給你弄點兒熱水
...l could get you some...hot water.

836
00:56:17,059 --> 00:56:19,394
好的，非常感謝
All right, thank you very much.

837
00:56:33,742 --> 00:56:35,702
現在我看起來好點了嗎？
Do I look any better now?

838
00:56:35,744 --> 00:56:40,499
- 這種藥一點效果都沒有 - 現在你要做的就是不要去想它
-This medicine doesn't do a bit of good. -What you need is to get your mind off it.

839
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:48,799
對不起，我的女房東希望我把房門敞開…
Excuse me, but my landlady prefers me to keep this door open...

840
00:56:49,049 --> 00:56:52,052
-…如果有先生來訪的話 - 好的
-...when I have a gentleman caller. -All right.

841
00:56:52,094 --> 00:56:54,221
牙又痛了嗎？
You have got a toothache, haven't you?

842
00:56:54,262 --> 00:56:57,349
- 是的 - 倒不如繼續笑我啊
-l surely have. -Why don't you try laughing at me again?

843
00:56:57,432 --> 00:56:59,393
- 什麼？ - 我和剛才在街上一樣可笑
-What? -I? still pretty funny.

844
00:56:59,434 --> 00:57:02,062
我知道，不過你不喜歡我笑你
I know, but you don't want me to laugh at you.

845
00:57:02,104 --> 00:57:04,189
可我也不願讓你牙痛
I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.

846
00:57:04,272 --> 00:57:05,565
看著我
Look at me.

847
00:57:05,983 --> 00:57:07,109
看到了嗎？
See that?

848
00:57:07,192 --> 00:57:08,527
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

849
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:11,071
我兩隻耳朵在動
I'm wiggling both my ears at the same time.

850
00:57:13,281 --> 00:57:15,075
就這樣，好笑吧
That's it, smile.

851
00:57:17,744 --> 00:57:21,581
我在全世界最好的男校 念了整整兩年書才學會這個把戲
It took me two solid years at the best boys' school in the world to learn that.

852
00:57:21,623 --> 00:57:24,835
那個教會我的人現在是委內瑞拉的總統
The fellow who taught me is now president of Venezuela.

853
00:57:26,795 --> 00:57:28,213
這就好了
That's it!

854
00:57:32,009 --> 00:57:34,594
- 是長頸鹿？ - 不，不是的
-Is it a giraffe? -No, not a giraffe.

855
00:57:34,678 --> 00:57:37,597
- 我敢說一定是 - 什麼？
-l bet it is. -What?

856
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:39,766
那就是大象
Well, then it's an elephant.

857
00:57:39,975 --> 00:57:43,687
- 是隻公雞 - 公雞！
-It抯 supposed to be a rooster. -A rooster!

858
00:57:44,187 --> 00:57:48,025
你的把戲真不少 你是職業魔術師嗎？
You know an awful lot of tricks. Are you a professional magician?

859
00:57:48,108 --> 00:57:50,694
- 不，我不是魔術師 - 我開玩笑的
-No, I'm not a magician. -l was just joking.

860
00:57:50,777 --> 00:57:52,446
你真的不知道我是誰？
You really don't know who I am?

861
00:57:52,487 --> 00:57:55,616
你說過你的名字，凱恩先生 但我相當的無知
You told me your name, Mr. Kane, but I'm awfully ignorant.

862
00:57:55,657 --> 00:58:00,162
我猜你能理解 我打賭你的名字我聽了不下一百萬次
I guess you caught on to that. I bet I've heard your name a million times.

863
00:58:00,329 --> 00:58:03,457
可是你很喜歡我，是嗎？ 儘管你不知道我是誰
You really like me, though, even though you don't know who I am?

864
00:58:03,498 --> 00:58:06,960
是的，你太有意思了！
I surely do. You've been wonderful.

865
00:58:08,045 --> 00:58:10,797
要不是你，我真的不知道該怎麼辦
Without you I don't know what I would have done.

866
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:14,176
我牙齒痛，認識的人也不多
I had a toothache, and I don't know many people.

867
00:58:14,509 --> 00:58:16,386
可我認識的人太多了
I know too many people.

868
00:58:16,845 --> 00:58:18,847
我猜我們兩人都很孤獨
I guess we're both lonely.

869
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:23,143
想知道我在禮服弄贓之前準備幹什麼嗎？
Want to know what I was going to do before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?

870
00:58:23,185 --> 00:58:26,480
我敢打賭那不是你的禮服 你大概有不少衣服
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes. You probably have more.

871
00:58:26,521 --> 00:58:27,731
我只是跟你開開玩笑！
I was just joking.

872
00:58:29,483 --> 00:58:33,403
我正要去西曼哈頓的倉庫…
I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouse...

873
00:58:33,487 --> 00:58:35,489
去尋找我的童年
...in search of my youth.

874
00:58:36,573 --> 00:58:41,203
你知道嗎，我母親去世已經很久了 她的遺物全都放在西部
You see, my mother died a long time ago. Her things were put in storage out West.

875
00:58:41,286 --> 00:58:43,747
因為那時沒有地方擱這些東西
There wasn't any other place to put them.

876
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:47,876
我本想現在派人去取回來 我今晚本想去看看的
I thought I'd send for them now. Tonight I was going to take a look at them.

877
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,170
這是個傷感的旅行
A sort of sentimental journey.

878
00:58:53,757 --> 00:58:56,093
我辦了幾家報紙，你呢？
I run a couple of newspapers. What do you do?

879
00:58:56,176 --> 00:58:57,177
我？
Me?

880
00:58:57,469 --> 00:58:59,680
- 你說你多大了？ - 我沒說過
-How old did you say you were? -l didn't say.

881
00:58:59,763 --> 00:59:02,474
如果你說過，我就不會問你第二遍了
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.

882
00:59:02,557 --> 00:59:03,809
- 多大啦？ - 不小了
-How old? -Pretty old.

883
00:59:03,892 --> 00:59:05,978
- 多大？ - 到八月就二十二了
-How old? -Twenty-two in August.

884
00:59:06,061 --> 00:59:08,063
成熟的年齡，你幹什麼工作？
That's a ripe old age. What do you do?

885
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:11,608
我在賽利格曼公司工作 負責背景音樂
I work at Seligman's. I'm in charge of the sheet music.

886
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:16,488
- 這就是你想幹的工作嗎？ - 不，我曾想當個歌手
-Is that what you want to do? -No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.

887
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:20,826
- 我是說，我母親想讓我當 - 後來怎麼沒唱呢？
-That is, I didn't. My mother did for me. -What happened to the singing?

888
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:24,913
母親總是認為，她經常談到要我唱歌劇
Mother always thought, she always talked about grand opera for me.

889
00:59:24,997 --> 00:59:26,206
你想想
Imagine.

890
00:59:26,498 --> 00:59:30,711
可是，我的嗓子不是那種類型的 只是…，你知道做媽媽的總是那樣的
But my voice isn't that kind. It's just, you know what mothers are like.

891
00:59:32,504 --> 00:59:33,714
是的
Yes.

892
00:59:35,757 --> 00:59:38,552
- 這埵鹵琴嗎？ - 鋼琴？
-Have you got a piano? -A piano?

893
00:59:39,553 --> 00:59:41,346
有，在客廳
Yes, there's one in the parlor.

894
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:44,474
- 你能唱給我聽嗎？ - 你是不會喜歡聽我唱的
-Would you sing for me? -You wouldn't want to hear me sing.

895
00:59:44,558 --> 00:59:45,934
我會喜歡的
Yes, I would.

896
00:59:47,728 --> 00:59:49,980
別把牙痛當藉口來推脫
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you.

897
00:59:50,063 --> 00:59:51,773
不痛，全好了
No, that's all gone.

898
00:59:53,525 --> 00:59:55,485
那好
All right.

899
00:59:56,445 --> 00:59:58,238
我們去客廳吧
Let's go to the parlor.

900
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:04,119
Yes，Lindor shall be mine
"Yes, Lindor shall be mine

901
01:00:05,495 --> 01:00:09,041
I have sworn it
"l have sworn it

902
01:00:09,916 --> 01:00:12,753
For weal or woe
"For weal or woe

903
01:00:14,838 --> 01:00:17,591
Yes，Lindor
"Yes, Lindor

904
01:00:24,348 --> 01:00:27,643
Lo giurai
"Lo giurai

905
01:00:29,061 --> 01:00:32,981
La vincer？
"La vincer?

906
01:00:40,989 --> 01:00:43,492
只有一個人可以擺脫本州…
There is only one man who can rid the politics...

907
01:00:43,533 --> 01:00:46,828
…吉姆格蒂斯的邪惡政治統治
...of this state of the evil domination of Boss Jim Gettys.

908
01:00:46,912 --> 01:00:50,832
我是查理斯·福斯特·凱恩先生的發言人 他為自由而戰…
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane, the fighting liberal...

909
01:00:50,874 --> 01:00:54,461
是勞動者的朋友，必將成為下一任州長…
...the friend of the workingman, the next governor of this state...

910
01:00:54,503 --> 01:00:56,797
參加這次競選…
...who entered upon this campaign....

911
01:00:56,838 --> 01:00:58,840
只有一個目的?
...with one purpose only:

912
01:00:58,882 --> 01:01:03,261
就是廣泛揭露…
To point out and make public the dishonesty...

913
01:01:03,512 --> 01:01:08,308
吉姆·W·格蒂斯政治機器十足的惡行和欺詐
...the downright villainy of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine...

914
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,938
當前他們完全控制了本州的政權
...now in complete control of the government of this state.

915
01:01:13,355 --> 01:01:17,150
我沒有競選宣言
I made no campaign promises...

916
01:01:17,651 --> 01:01:22,281
因為直到幾周以前，我都沒有當選的希望
...because, until a few weeks ago, I had no hope of being elected.

917
01:01:23,907 --> 01:01:28,078
不過現在我不只是指望而已
Now, however, l have something more than a hope.

918
01:01:31,331 --> 01:01:33,834
吉姆·格蒂斯沒機會了
Jim Gettys has something less than a chance.

919
01:01:38,255 --> 01:01:40,173
每一個投票測驗
Every straw vote...

920
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:45,178
每一個獨立的民意測驗都表明我將會當選
...every independent poll shows that l will be elected.

921
01:01:45,595 --> 01:01:47,306
那麼
Very well.

922
01:01:47,472 --> 01:01:50,225
現在我可以作出一些許諾了
Now l can afford to make some promises.

923
01:02:00,527 --> 01:02:02,696
勞動者和平民區的孩子們知道…
The workingman and the slum child...

924
01:02:02,738 --> 01:02:07,909
他們能指望我為他們的利益竭盡所能
...know they can expect my best efforts in their interests.

925
01:02:07,993 --> 01:02:12,539
正派的公民們知道，我將盡力去…
The decent, ordinary citizens know that I?l do everything in my power...

926
01:02:12,623 --> 01:02:17,836
保護非特權階層、低收入階層和貧困階層
...to protect the underprivileged, the underpaid, and the underfed.

927
01:02:21,757 --> 01:02:26,136
- 媽媽，爸爸是州長嗎？ - 還不是，小寶貝
-Mother, is Pop governor yet? -Not yet, Junior.

928
01:02:30,015 --> 01:02:33,393
我現在承諾
I'd make my promises now...

929
01:02:33,685 --> 01:02:37,147
只要不是太忙我都能兌現（笑）
...if I weren't too busy arranging to keep them.

930
01:02:41,735 --> 01:02:44,738
但是我所許下的其中一個諾言
But here's one promise I?l make...

931
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:47,866
吉姆·格蒂斯知道我會兌現的
...and Boss Jim Gettys knows I?l keep it.

932
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:51,995
作為州長我首先要做的
My first official act as governor of this state...

933
01:02:52,412 --> 01:02:57,292
就是委任一名專門的地方檢查官
...will be to appoint a special district attorney to arrange for the indictment...

934
01:02:57,501 --> 01:03:03,215
對吉姆·格蒂斯提出起訴，控告並定罪
...prosecution and conviction of Boss Jim W. Gettys.

935
01:03:29,449 --> 01:03:32,661
如果今天舉行投票，你一定會以十萬票當選
If the election were held today, you'd be in by 100,000 votes.

936
01:03:32,703 --> 01:03:34,579
- 格蒂斯甚至裝不下去了 - 爸爸
-Gettys isn't even pretending. -Pop.

937
01:03:34,663 --> 01:03:36,790
- 哈羅，小夥計！ - 他不僅是嚇壞了，他病倒了
-Hello, son. -He isn't just scared, he's sick.

938
01:03:36,873 --> 01:03:39,710
我看吉姆·格蒂斯總該悟出，我是說到做到的
It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys I mean what I say.

939
01:03:39,793 --> 01:03:43,171
- 你喜歡你老子的演講嗎？ - 我每個字都聽得清楚
-Did you like your old man's speech? -l could hear every word.

940
01:03:43,213 --> 01:03:44,881
- 哈羅，愛米麗 - 注意！
-Hello, Emily. -Hold it.

941
01:03:45,465 --> 01:03:48,135
- 妙極了，凱恩先生！ - 妙極了
-Great speech, Mr. Kane. -Wonderful.

942
01:03:48,176 --> 01:03:50,512
你要找一輛計程車嗎？
Will you get us a taxi?

943
01:03:51,888 --> 01:03:54,808
我讓奧利弗開車送小凱恩回家
I'm sending Junior home in the car with Oliver.

944
01:03:55,183 --> 01:03:56,810
晚安，爸爸
Good night, Father.

945
01:03:58,145 --> 01:04:00,022
再見，兒子
Goodbye, son.

946
01:04:10,699 --> 01:04:14,161
為什麼用車送小凱恩回家？ 你做計程車幹什麼？
Why did you send Junior home in the car? What are you doing in a taxi?

947
01:04:14,244 --> 01:04:16,413
我要你和我一起去拜訪一家人，查理斯
There's a call I want you to make with me.

948
01:04:16,496 --> 01:04:18,415
- 著什麼急 - 不，不能等
-It can wait. -No, it can't.

949
01:04:18,498 --> 01:04:20,167
這是怎麼回事，愛米麗？
What's this all about, Emily?

950
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:23,503
可能什麼事情也沒有，我只想弄清楚
It may not be about anything at all. I intend to find out.

951
01:04:23,587 --> 01:04:27,674
- 你要去哪裡？ - 我要去“西74街，185號”
-Where are you going? -I? going to "185 West 74th Street."

952
01:04:29,217 --> 01:04:32,137
如果你願意的話，你可以和我一起去
If you wish, you may come with me.

953
01:04:36,308 --> 01:04:37,851
我和你一起去
I'll come with you.

954
01:04:43,023 --> 01:04:46,485
我不知道你還有這種瞎胡鬧的本事，愛米麗
I had no idea you had this flair for melodrama, Emily.

955
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:50,072
進來，凱恩先生
Come right in, Mr. Kane.

956
01:05:00,624 --> 01:05:02,000
查利
Charlie.

957
01:05:08,715 --> 01:05:11,802
他逼著我給你妻子送去那張紙條 我本不想那樣做
He forced me to send your wife that letter. I didn't want to.

958
01:05:11,885 --> 01:05:14,680
他說得非常可怕…
He's been saying the most terrible....

959
01:05:18,976 --> 01:05:20,644
凱恩夫人
Mrs. Kane.

960
01:05:22,646 --> 01:05:25,148
我看不會有人來給我們介紹的
I don't suppose anybody would introduce us.

961
01:05:26,608 --> 01:05:28,193
我是吉姆·格蒂斯
I'm Jim Gettys.

962
01:05:28,777 --> 01:05:29,945
什麼事？
Yes?

963
01:05:33,198 --> 01:05:36,952
是我讓亞歷山大小姐給你這個條子的
I made Miss Alexander send you the note, Mrs. Kane.

964
01:05:36,994 --> 01:05:39,288
她開始有點兒不太願意，不過她還是做了
She didn't want to at first. But she did it.

965
01:05:39,329 --> 01:05:42,165
查利，他對我說的事…，他威脅要…
Charlie, the things he said to me.... He threatened to--

966
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:47,129
我看我用不著等到當選後再對你採取行動 頭一件事，我看我該扭斷你的脖子
I won't wait until I'm elected. To start with, I think I'll break your neck.

967
01:05:47,212 --> 01:05:49,965
也許你能辦得到，也許你辦不到
Maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't.

968
01:05:51,049 --> 01:05:55,178
查理斯！你想要扭斷這個人的脖子 絲毫不能解釋這封信?
Your breaking this man's neck would scarcely explain this note:

969
01:05:56,138 --> 01:05:59,975
“對凱恩先生，對你自己，對你的兒子 將會有嚴重後果”
"Serious consequences for Mr. Kane, for yourself and for your son."

970
01:06:00,058 --> 01:06:03,103
- 他想讓他來這堙K - 這封信是什麼意思？
-He wanted to get her to come here-- -What does this note mean?

971
01:06:03,145 --> 01:06:05,772
我是蘇珊·亞歷山大 我知道你會怎麼想…
I'm Susan Alexander. I know what you're thinking--

972
01:06:05,814 --> 01:06:08,650
- 這封信是什麼意思，亞歷山大小姐？ - 她不知道，凱恩夫人
-What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander? -She don't know.

973
01:06:08,734 --> 01:06:11,570
她只是發出這封信，因為我告訴她 不發出這封信，對她沒有什麼好處
She sent it because I told her it wouldn't be smart not to.

974
01:06:11,653 --> 01:06:14,948
- 愛米麗，這位紳士… - 我不是紳士
-Emily, this gentleman-- -I? not a gentleman.

975
01:06:15,157 --> 01:06:18,035
你丈夫是想取笑我，才叫我紳士
Your husband is only trying to be funny calling me one.

976
01:06:18,118 --> 01:06:20,704
我甚至不知道紳士是什麼
I don't even know what a gentleman is.

977
01:06:21,747 --> 01:06:25,000
你明白嗎？我認為一個紳士…
You see, my idea of a gentleman....

978
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:31,632
凱恩夫人，如果我有一家報紙 而我不同意某人或某位政客的…
If I owned a paper and didn't like the way somebody was doing things...

979
01:06:31,673 --> 01:06:34,134
做事方法，我就用我所掌握的一切 來和他鬥爭
...some politician, I'd fight him with all I had.

980
01:06:34,176 --> 01:06:36,011
但是我不會把對方醜化成一個 穿著條紋號衣的囚犯
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit...

981
01:06:36,094 --> 01:06:38,472
使他的家人可以在報紙上看到那樣的漫畫
...so his family could see his picture in the paper.

982
01:06:38,513 --> 01:06:42,476
- 你是一個卑鄙的貪官污吏… - 現在我們討論你是什麼東西
-You're a cheap, crooked grafter-- -We're talking now about what you are.

983
01:06:43,393 --> 01:06:46,229
凱恩夫人，我是在為我的生命而戰 不僅是我的政治前途，而是生命
I'm fighting for my life, not just my political life.

984
01:06:46,313 --> 01:06:48,482
- 他說除非你… - 我要說的是…
-He said unless you-- -That's what I said.

985
01:06:48,565 --> 01:06:52,569
這是我願意給你的一次機會 比你給我的機會要多
Here's the chance I'm willing to give him. It's more of a chance than he'd give me.

986
01:06:52,653 --> 01:06:57,407
除非他今天晚上承認他病情嚴重 必須修養一二年…
Unless he decides by tomorrow that he's so sick he has to go away for a year...

987
01:06:57,491 --> 01:07:01,787
那麼星期一早上，本州除了你們以外的 所有報紙都將刊登我提供給他們的新聞
...Monday morning, all papers in the state, except his, will carry the story I'll give.

988
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:03,246
什麼新聞？
What story?

989
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:07,209
- 關於他和亞歷山大小姐的新聞 - 我們沒有任何新聞！
-The story about him and Ms. Alexander. -There isn't any story!

990
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:08,502
閉嘴！
Shut up.

991
01:07:08,877 --> 01:07:11,713
- 我們得到的證據可能比頭條新聞更壞 - 凱恩先生只是…
We've got evidence that would look bad in the headlines.

992
01:07:11,755 --> 01:07:14,424
你想要我把證據拿出來嗎？
Do you want me to give you the evidence?

993
01:07:16,551 --> 01:07:19,388
我希望凱恩先生而退出競選 那條新聞就無需發表了
I'd rather he withdrew without having the story published.

994
01:07:19,429 --> 01:07:22,516
不是我關心他，那樣對我好一些
Not that I care about him, but I'd be better off that way.

995
01:07:25,435 --> 01:07:27,521
對你也一樣，凱恩夫人
So would you, Mrs. Kane.

996
01:07:27,938 --> 01:07:30,023
那我怎麼辦？
What about me?

997
01:07:32,025 --> 01:07:35,862
他說我將名譽掃地，不論我到哪裡…
He said my name would be dragged through the mud. That everywhere I went--

998
01:07:35,904 --> 01:07:38,782
我看這是你唯一的選擇，查理斯
There seems to be only one decision you can make, Charles.

999
01:07:39,408 --> 01:07:41,576
我看你只有此路一條
I'd say that it'd been made for you.

1000
01:07:43,245 --> 01:07:45,330
你說說，本州的選民將…
You can't tell me the voters of this state--

1001
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:48,375
目前我對本州的選民不感興趣
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.

1002
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:49,918
我感興趣的是我的兒子
I am interested in our son.

1003
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,130
- 查利！如果他們發表了這個故事… - 他們不會的
-Charlie, if they publish this story-- -They won't.

1004
01:07:54,423 --> 01:07:56,550
晚安，格蒂斯先生
Good night, Mr. Gettys.

1005
01:08:05,475 --> 01:08:07,561
你跟我來嗎，查理斯？
Are you coming, Charles?

1006
01:08:09,813 --> 01:08:11,148
不
No.

1007
01:08:14,568 --> 01:08:16,194
我要留在這
I'm staying here.

1008
01:08:19,323 --> 01:08:21,408
我可以單獨處理這事
I can fight this all alone.

1009
01:08:22,659 --> 01:08:25,162
如果你失去理智，可能會追悔莫及
If you don't listen to reason, it may be too late.

1010
01:08:25,245 --> 01:08:29,207
莫及？對什麼而言？
Too late? For what?

1011
01:08:31,293 --> 01:08:34,588
是對你和這個公賊…
For you and this public thief...

1012
01:08:34,921 --> 01:08:37,257
想奪走選民對我的愛而言的吧？
...to take the love of the people away from me?

1013
01:08:37,299 --> 01:08:40,093
你還要考慮一下其他事情，你的兒子
You got other things to think about. Your little boy.

1014
01:08:40,218 --> 01:08:42,679
你不是不願意他在報紙上讀到你的新聞
You don't want him to read about you in the papers.

1015
01:08:42,763 --> 01:08:47,267
在這世界上只有一個人能決定我該做什麼 那就是我自己
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'll do. And that's me.

1016
01:08:50,145 --> 01:08:53,690
你是決定過你該做什麼，查理斯，那是以前
You decided what you were going to do, Charles, some time ago.

1017
01:09:00,948 --> 01:09:03,617
你比我設想的還要愚蠢，凱恩先生
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought.

1018
01:09:03,659 --> 01:09:06,036
- 我跟你沒話可說 - 你輸了…
-I抳e got nothing to say to you. -You're licked--

1019
01:09:06,119 --> 01:09:09,498
滾出去！如果想要見我，叫典獄長給我寫信
Get out. If you want to see me, have the warden write me a letter.

1020
01:09:09,748 --> 01:09:14,419
如果換個人，我會對他說： 將要發生的事對你是個教訓
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.

1021
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:17,381
不過你需要的不止是一次教訓
Only you're going to need more than one lesson.

1022
01:09:18,215 --> 01:09:22,260
- 而且你肯定要吃夠教訓的 - 用不著為我操心，格蒂斯
-And you'll get more than one lesson. -Don't worry about me, Gettys.

1023
01:09:23,929 --> 01:09:25,973
用不著為我操心！
Don't worry about me!

1024
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:29,476
我是查理斯·福斯特·凱恩！
I'm Charles Foster Kane!

1025
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:34,356
我不是骯髒卑鄙的政客 想要使自己…
I'm no cheap, crooked politician trying to save himself...

1026
01:09:34,398 --> 01:09:37,442
…逃脫法律的嚴懲！
...from the consequences of his crimes!

1027
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:42,489
格蒂斯！我要把你送進新新監獄
Gettys! I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.

1028
01:09:42,698 --> 01:09:44,825
新新監獄，格蒂斯
Sing Sing, Gettys.

1029
01:09:48,036 --> 01:09:51,123
- 要車嗎，凱恩夫人？ - 好的，謝謝你
-Have you a car, Mrs. Kane? -Yes, thank you.

1030
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:54,418
- 晚安 - 晚安
-Good night. -Good night.

1031
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:09,182
快來看，號外！號外！
Paper. Read all about it. Extra, extra.

1032
01:10:13,729 --> 01:10:15,814
- 買報嗎？ - 不，謝謝
-Paper? -No, thanks.

1033
01:10:30,704 --> 01:10:33,540
已經有一百萬張占多數的票反對…
With a million majority already against him...

1034
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:37,127
[號外：凱恩當選] 只有教區的選票還沒有出來…
...and the church counties still to be heard from...

1035
01:10:37,336 --> 01:10:39,755
大概沒有指望了
...I? afraid we got no choice.

1036
01:10:39,838 --> 01:10:41,256
這一張？
This one?

1037
01:10:44,718 --> 01:10:46,470
那一張吧
That one.

1038
01:11:09,785 --> 01:11:11,620
晚安
Good night again.

1039
01:11:22,798 --> 01:11:26,259
- 我能做點什麼嗎？ - 沒有，伯恩斯坦先生
-Is there anything I can-- -No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.

1040
01:11:27,928 --> 01:11:30,222
你最好回家睡覺
You better go home and get some sleep.

1041
01:11:31,306 --> 01:11:32,766
你也是
You, too.

1042
01:11:35,185 --> 01:11:36,979
晚安，凱恩先生
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1043
01:12:02,129 --> 01:12:04,673
- 哈羅，傑德 - 我喝多了
-Hello, Jedediah. -I? drunk.

1044
01:12:08,343 --> 01:12:13,473
如果你喝醉的目的就是要和我談…
If you've got drunk to talk to me about...

1045
01:12:16,018 --> 01:12:18,562
…蘇珊·亞歷山大，就別費心了
...Ms. Alexander, don't bother.

1046
01:12:20,397 --> 01:12:22,190
我不感興趣
I'm not interested.

1047
01:12:26,403 --> 01:12:30,282
我已經使神聖的改革事業倒退了，對嗎？
I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it?

1048
01:12:31,742 --> 01:12:33,160
不錯
All right.

1049
01:12:34,911 --> 01:12:38,206
如果他們自己希望如此 他們已經做出了選擇
If that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice.

1050
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:41,084
顯然，本州的選民喜歡吉姆·格蒂斯 而不是喜歡我
It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me.

1051
01:12:41,168 --> 01:12:44,838
你談到選民，仿佛你擁有他們
You talk about the people as though you owned them.

1052
01:12:44,921 --> 01:12:47,215
仿佛他們是屬於你的，天啦
As though they belong to you. Goodness.

1053
01:12:47,966 --> 01:12:52,763
就我記憶所及，你談過“給予人民權力”…
As long as I can remember, you've talked about giving the people their rights...

1054
01:12:52,929 --> 01:12:56,183
就好像你能把自由作為禮物送給他們…
...as if you could make them a present of liberty...

1055
01:12:56,308 --> 01:12:58,852
作為他們為你服務的報酬
...as a reward for services rendered.

1056
01:12:58,894 --> 01:13:01,313
- 傑德 - 你記得那些勞動者嗎？
-Jed. -You remember the workingman?

1057
01:13:02,064 --> 01:13:04,691
我也要喝醉，傑德
I'll get drunk, too, Jedediah...

1058
01:13:06,193 --> 01:13:07,444
…如果這樣有用的話
...if it'll do any good.

1059
01:13:07,527 --> 01:13:10,948
沒有任何用處，你也從來都沒醉過
It won't do any good. Besides you never get drunk.

1060
01:13:11,073 --> 01:13:13,909
你經常奢談勞動者…
You used to write an awful lot about the workingman--

1061
01:13:13,951 --> 01:13:14,868
回去吧
Go on home.

1062
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:17,788
可是，他們正在變成所謂的 “有組織的勞工”
He's turning into something called "organized labor."

1063
01:13:19,581 --> 01:13:22,918
你一點也不會喜歡的，當你發現…
You won't like that one little bit when you find out...

1064
01:13:23,001 --> 01:13:28,131
那意味著他們認為某種東西是他們的權利 而不是你的恩賜的時候！
...it means your workingman expects something as his right, and not your gift.

1065
01:13:30,217 --> 01:13:34,721
當你所珍視的無特權的人真正聯合起來…
When your precious underprivileged really get together....

1066
01:13:35,305 --> 01:13:37,140
噢，天啦
Oh, boy....

1067
01:13:37,933 --> 01:13:40,894
他們加在一起要比你那特權還要大…
That'll add up to something bigger than your privilege...

1068
01:13:40,978 --> 01:13:43,939
那時我就不知你會怎麼辦了
...then I don't know what you'll do.

1069
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:49,278
也許，你會坐船到一個荒島去當猴王
Sail away to a desert island probably and lord it over the monkeys.

1070
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:52,739
我用不著太操心了
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

1071
01:13:53,115 --> 01:13:57,995
在那堣]不愁沒有糾正我錯誤的人
There'll probably be a few of them there to tell me when I do something wrong.

1072
01:13:58,203 --> 01:14:00,289
你不能總是狗運亨通
You may not always be so lucky.

1073
01:14:01,123 --> 01:14:02,582
你還沒有喝醉
You're not very drunk.

1074
01:14:02,624 --> 01:14:04,668
喝醉？你關心什麼？
Drunk, what do you care?

1075
01:14:05,085 --> 01:14:07,963
除了你自己，你什麼也不關心
You don't care about anything except you.

1076
01:14:08,964 --> 01:14:14,803
你只是想使人們相信你非常熱愛他們 因此他們應當回報你的愛
You persuade people that you love them so much that they ought to love you back.

1077
01:14:15,137 --> 01:14:17,764
你需要的是你自己方式的愛
Only you want love on your own terms.

1078
01:14:19,474 --> 01:14:22,936
那是以你為準，根據你的規則來比賽
It's something to be played your way, according to your rules.

1079
01:14:29,568 --> 01:14:32,779
- 查利，希望你能讓我到芝加哥分社工作 - 什麼？
-Let me work on the Chicago paper. -What?

1080
01:14:33,071 --> 01:14:37,868
- 你不是說過，那婸搨n一個“戲劇…員” -“戲劇評論員”
You said you were looking for someone to do dramatic "crimitism," criticism.

1081
01:14:38,118 --> 01:14:39,828
我喝醉了
I am drunk.

1082
01:14:42,372 --> 01:14:44,374
我想去芝加哥
I want to go to Chicago.

1083
01:14:45,667 --> 01:14:47,419
你在這塈韟野
You're too valuable here.

1084
01:14:49,671 --> 01:14:53,634
- 這堣w沒什麼讓我做的，看來我只能… - 好吧，你可以去芝加哥
-There's nothing left for me to do-- -All right, you can go to Chicago.

1085
01:14:53,717 --> 01:14:54,968
謝謝你
Thank you.

1086
01:14:56,053 --> 01:14:58,597
看來我還是設法喝醉為妙
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.

1087
01:15:00,307 --> 01:15:02,809
不過我警告你，你不會喜歡芝加哥的
I warn you, Jedediah, you won't like Chicago.

1088
01:15:02,851 --> 01:15:07,481
從湖上吹來的風可不小 而且他們很可能從未聽說過山珍海味
The wind comes off the lake, and they've probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.

1089
01:15:07,564 --> 01:15:09,775
下一個星期六，好嗎？
Will Saturday after next be all right?

1090
01:15:09,858 --> 01:15:11,818
- 隨你決定 - 謝謝
-Anytime you say. -Thank you.

1091
01:15:17,532 --> 01:15:22,496
為我的規則幹一杯，任何人都只知道?
A toast to love on my terms. Those are the only terms anybody knows:

1092
01:15:24,122 --> 01:15:25,332
他自己的規則
His own.

1093
01:15:38,261 --> 01:15:40,806
凱恩先生，我是《問事報》的
Mr. Kane, I'm from the Inquirer.

1094
01:15:50,065 --> 01:15:52,985
- 什麼事，年青人？ - 你還會從政嗎？
-What's that, young man? -Are you through with politics?

1095
01:15:53,068 --> 01:15:55,779
我會從政？我要說的剛好相反
Am I through with politics? I would say vice versa.

1096
01:15:57,155 --> 01:15:58,865
我們要做歌劇明星
We're going to be an opera star.

1097
01:15:58,907 --> 01:16:00,784
你將在大都會劇院表演嗎，凱恩太太？
Are you singing at the Metropolitan?

1098
01:16:00,867 --> 01:16:02,244
當然啦
We certainly are.

1099
01:16:02,411 --> 01:16:05,289
查利說，如果我不在那媞t唱 他就為我造一座歌劇院
Charlie said if I didn't, he'd build me an opera house.

1100
01:16:05,372 --> 01:16:06,873
看來並不需要
That won't be necessary.

1101
01:16:11,753 --> 01:16:15,048
不，不！
No, no, no!

1102
01:16:48,624 --> 01:16:50,125
--
Places, please!

1103
01:17:39,216 --> 01:17:42,010
李蘭先生是從戲劇的角度來寫的？
Mr. Leland is writing it from the dramatic angle?

1104
01:17:42,094 --> 01:17:45,555
- 我們還從新聞消息的角度報導了 - 還有社交的角度
-And we've covered it from the news end. -And the social.

1105
01:17:46,431 --> 01:17:48,642
音樂的評論怎樣？送來了嗎？
How about the music notice?

1106
01:17:48,684 --> 01:17:50,686
是的，已經在排版了
Yes, it's already made up.

1107
01:17:50,769 --> 01:17:53,438
墨爾文先生寫了一篇漂亮的評論
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.

1108
01:17:54,982 --> 01:17:59,152
- 熱情洋溢嗎？ - 是的，先生
-Enthusiastic? -Yes, sir.

1109
01:17:59,278 --> 01:18:01,905
- 伯恩斯坦先生 - 凱恩先生，真沒料到您的光臨！
Mr. Kane. This is a surprise.

1110
01:18:04,491 --> 01:18:06,493
我們準備發兩版的劇照
We've got two spreads of pictures.

1111
01:18:06,535 --> 01:18:08,412
音樂的評論是在頭版嗎？
The music notice on the front page?

1112
01:18:08,495 --> 01:18:12,165
但是還有一篇稿子沒到，劇評稿子
But there's still one notice to come. The dramatic.

1113
01:18:13,292 --> 01:18:14,835
劇評稿子
The dramatic notice.

1114
01:18:16,003 --> 01:18:20,549
- 伯恩斯坦先生，是由李蘭寫，對嗎？ - 是的，我們一直在等
-Mr. Bernstein, that's Mr. Leland, isn't it? -Yes, we're waiting for it.

1115
01:18:24,428 --> 01:18:27,514
- 他在哪？ - 就在那邊，凱恩先生
-Where is he? -Right in there, Mr. Kane.

1116
01:18:35,397 --> 01:18:36,898
凱恩先生
Mr. Kane.

1117
01:18:51,705 --> 01:18:54,374
李蘭先生和凱恩先生…
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane...

1118
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,754
已經有多年沒有說話了
...haven't spoken together for years.

1119
01:19:01,381 --> 01:19:04,051
- 你不是認為… - 沒什麼好認為的
-You don't suppose-- -There's nothing to suppose.

1120
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:09,723
我去一下
Excuse me.

1121
01:19:26,782 --> 01:19:28,283
把門關上
Close the door.

1122
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:34,164
他以前從未喝醉過
He ain't been drinking before.

1123
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,125
從來沒有過，否則我們會聽說的
Never. We would have heard.

1124
01:19:37,459 --> 01:19:39,419
上面寫了些什麼？
What does it say there?

1125
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,589
評論上面寫了些什麼？
The notice, what's he written?

1126
01:19:44,299 --> 01:19:49,262
蘇珊·亞歷山大小姐，一位漂亮的 但卻是毫無才華的業餘演員…
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur...

1127
01:19:52,808 --> 01:19:56,645
昨晚在芝加哥新歌劇院的揭幕式上…
"...last night opened the new Chicago Opera House...

1128
01:19:56,979 --> 01:19:58,730
“演出…”
"...in a performance of...."

1129
01:20:01,817 --> 01:20:05,362
我還是讀不出那個劇名，凱恩先生
I still can't pronounce that name.

1130
01:20:08,865 --> 01:20:12,828
值得慶倖的是 她的歌唱不在本文論述範圍之內
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.

1131
01:20:13,245 --> 01:20:17,165
“至於談到她的表演，那簡直無法…”
"Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to...."

1132
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:20,043
念下去！
Go on.

1133
01:20:22,504 --> 01:20:24,506
就這麼多
That's all there is.

1134
01:20:37,602 --> 01:20:41,148
至於談到她的表演，那簡直無法形容
Of her acting it is absolutely impossible to say anything except...

1135
01:20:41,231 --> 01:20:44,818
按照本文作者的意見 他達到了一個新的低點
...that, in the opinion of this reviewer, it represents a new low.

1136
01:20:45,027 --> 01:20:47,946
- 看見沒有，伯恩斯坦？按照本文意見… - 我沒有看見
-In the opinion of this reviewer. -l didn't see that.

1137
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:50,365
上面沒有寫，伯恩斯坦先生，我在口述
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein, I'm dictating it.

1138
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:53,368
- 凱恩先生，我… - 給我拿一台打字機
-Mr. Kane, l-- -Get me a typewriter.

1139
01:20:54,828 --> 01:20:57,205
我來把李蘭的評論寫完
I'm going to finish Mr. Leland's notice.

1140
01:21:14,306 --> 01:21:16,224
哈羅，伯恩斯坦
Hello, Bernstein.

1141
01:21:21,355 --> 01:21:24,691
- 哈羅 - 哈羅，李蘭先生
-Hello. -Hello, Mr. Leland.

1142
01:21:27,986 --> 01:21:31,198
我的評論在哪，伯恩斯坦？ 我得把它寫完
Where's my notice, Bernstein? I've got to finish my notice.

1143
01:21:31,281 --> 01:21:34,534
- 凱恩先生在替你寫 - 查利？
-Mr. Kane is finishing it for you. -Charlie?

1144
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:42,876
查利在那堙H
Charlie out there?

1145
01:21:44,628 --> 01:21:47,089
我猜他是在把它說圓了
I guess he's fixing it up.

1146
01:21:49,508 --> 01:21:51,927
我知道我編不出來
I knew I'd never get that through.

1147
01:21:52,761 --> 01:21:56,765
凱恩先生是按照你開始的觀點 來寫你的文章的
Mr. Kane's finishing your review just the way you started it.

1148
01:21:57,182 --> 01:22:00,894
他是用您用的那種嘲笑的口吻來寫的
He's writing a bad notice like you wanted it to be.

1149
01:22:03,397 --> 01:22:05,399
我想，這總該能向您徵明一點什麼吧
I guess that'll show you.

1150
01:22:30,299 --> 01:22:32,217
你好，傑德
Hello, Jedediah.

1151
01:22:35,470 --> 01:22:36,930
你好，查利
Hello, Charlie.

1152
01:22:38,515 --> 01:22:41,351
我不知道，我們倆該談談
I didn't know we were speaking.

1153
01:22:41,685 --> 01:22:43,937
當然，我們正在談著呢，傑德
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.

1154
01:22:45,981 --> 01:22:48,150
你被解雇了
You're fired.

1155
01:23:00,454 --> 01:23:05,000
每個人都知道這件事，李蘭先生 但他為什麼要這麼做？
Everybody knows that story, Mr. Leland, but why did he do it?

1156
01:23:06,501 --> 01:23:09,671
- 他怎麼會寫一篇… - 你不瞭解查利
-How could a man write a notice-- -You just don't know Charlie.

1157
01:23:09,755 --> 01:23:13,675
他以為寫完了那篇評論 就能向我表明他是個誠實的人
He thought that by finishing that notice he'd show me he was an honest man.

1158
01:23:13,759 --> 01:23:16,011
他一直想證明一些東西
He was always trying to prove something.

1159
01:23:16,094 --> 01:23:19,222
蘇珊成為歌劇演員的所有過程
That whole thing about Susie being an opera singer.

1160
01:23:19,306 --> 01:23:21,558
就是要證明某些東西
That was trying to prove something.

1161
01:23:22,351 --> 01:23:25,687
你知道選舉前一天報紙的頭條是什麼嗎？
You know what the headline was the day before the election?

1162
01:23:26,063 --> 01:23:32,069
“候選人凱恩與‘歌劇演員’共築愛巢”
"Candidate Kane found in love nest with 'singer."'

1163
01:23:32,152 --> 01:23:34,279
他想把“歌劇演員”上的引號去掉
He was going to take the quotes off the singer.

1164
01:23:34,363 --> 01:23:35,489
嘿，護士！
Hey, nurse!

1165
01:23:35,572 --> 01:23:39,576
五年前他從他南方的府邸給我來了封信
Five years ago he wrote from that place down there in the South.

1166
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:47,334
那個地方叫，香格裡拉？愛爾多拉多？ 斯諾比·喬？那個地方叫什麼來著？
What's it called, Shangri-la? EI Dorado? Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?

1167
01:23:48,543 --> 01:23:52,881
對了，上都，我一直是知道的
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.

1168
01:23:52,965 --> 01:23:57,094
你明白我的意思嗎？ 我的話不是很難懂
You caught on, didn't you? I'm not that hard to see through.

1169
01:23:57,511 --> 01:23:59,888
不過，我沒有給他回信
Well, I never even answered his letter.

1170
01:24:00,681 --> 01:24:02,057
也許，我應該回信的
Maybe I should have.

1171
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:06,186
想必這些年他在那個潰敗的莊園 也挺孤單的
I guess he was pretty lonely down there in that coliseum all those years.

1172
01:24:06,645 --> 01:24:09,731
蘇珊離開他時也沒有建成 以後也沒完工
He hadn't finished it when she left him. He never finished it.

1173
01:24:09,815 --> 01:24:13,026
除了完成我的評論，他什麼也沒完成
He never finished anything except my notice.

1174
01:24:13,402 --> 01:24:16,571
- 當然，莊園是為蘇珊建的 - 想必他是愛她的
-Of course, he built the joint for her. -That must have been love.

1175
01:24:16,655 --> 01:24:17,614
不知道
I don't know.

1176
01:24:17,864 --> 01:24:22,369
他在這個世界上絕望了 所以他為自己建立了一個世界，絕對的專制
He was disappointed in the world so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.

1177
01:24:23,078 --> 01:24:25,664
不管怎麼說，這比歌劇院可要大了
It was something bigger than an opera house anyway.

1178
01:24:25,747 --> 01:24:27,124
- 護士 - 來了，李蘭先生
-Nurse. -Yes, Mr. Leland.

1179
01:24:27,207 --> 01:24:28,583
我就來
I'm coming.

1180
01:24:30,127 --> 01:24:33,630
- 年輕人，我能請您幫個忙嗎？ - 當然可以
-There's one thing you can do for me. -Sure.

1181
01:24:33,755 --> 01:24:38,385
出去的時候 能到商店給我買幾支好雪茄來嗎？
Stop at the cigar store on your way out, and get me a couple of good cigars.

1182
01:24:38,468 --> 01:24:40,554
- 願意為您效勞 - 謝謝
-Be glad to. -Thank you.

1183
01:24:41,054 --> 01:24:42,472
就一會兒
One is enough.

1184
01:24:42,848 --> 01:24:47,269
我年輕的時候，總覺得所有的護士都很漂亮
When I was a young man, there was an impression that nurses were pretty.

1185
01:24:47,311 --> 01:24:49,396
可現在卻不這麼認為
Well, it was no truer then than it is today.

1186
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:51,607
- 我輓著您的胳膊吧 - 好的
-I?l take your arm. -All right.

1187
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:54,401
- 你不會忘了買雪茄吧？ - 不會的
-You won't forget about those cigars? -l won't.

1188
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:59,573
把它們包得象牙膏之類的東西 否則他們不會把它轉給我的
Have them wrapped like toothpaste, or they'll stop them at the desk.

1189
01:24:59,615 --> 01:25:02,534
我跟你說過的那個青年醫生…
You know that young doctor I was telling you about, well...

1190
01:25:02,618 --> 01:25:06,496
想要讓我長壽
...he's got an idea he wants to keep me alive.

1191
01:25:35,776 --> 01:25:39,780
你想到什麼就談什麼吧…
I'd rather you'd just talk. Anything that comes into your mind...

1192
01:25:40,489 --> 01:25:42,699
關於你自己和凱恩先生的事
...about yourself and Mr. Kane.

1193
01:25:42,908 --> 01:25:48,246
也許我所想到的關於我和凱恩先生的事 您並不願意聽
You don't want to hear what comes into my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.

1194
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:54,586
也許我第一次遇到查利的時候 就不該給他唱歌
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung for Charlie that first time I met him.

1195
01:25:55,837 --> 01:25:58,757
但從那以後，我唱得太多
But I did an awful lot of singing after that.

1196
01:26:00,634 --> 01:26:04,513
就從我跟聲樂教師學唱歌談起吧 教師每小時能拿到100塊
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.

1197
01:26:04,554 --> 01:26:07,140
- 教師拿到了報酬，我… - 你學到了什麼？
-The teachers got that, I didn't. -What did you get?

1198
01:26:07,224 --> 01:26:10,811
我什麼也沒學到，除了音樂課以外 就只有音樂課了
I didn't get a thing, except music lessons. That's all there was in it.

1199
01:26:10,852 --> 01:26:12,354
他跟您結婚了，是嗎？
He married you, didn't he?

1200
01:26:12,396 --> 01:26:15,857
一開始他沒有提到結婚的事 直到他的婚姻破裂…
He didn't mention anything about marriage until after it was over and...

1201
01:26:15,941 --> 01:26:18,277
直到我們的事還見報…
...until it got in the papers about us...

1202
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:23,240
直到他選舉失敗，那個叫諾爾登的和他離婚 他才和我結婚
...and he lost the election, and that Norton woman divorced him.

1203
01:26:23,573 --> 01:26:25,617
他真的對我的歌喉很感興趣
He was really interested in my voice.

1204
01:26:25,701 --> 01:26:27,286
他為什麼要蓋這座歌劇院呢？
Why did he build that opera house?

1205
01:26:27,369 --> 01:26:31,206
我並不需要，我不想唱，那是他的主意
I didn't want it. I didn't want a thing. It was his idea.

1206
01:26:32,582 --> 01:26:34,668
一切都是他的主意…
Everything was his idea...

1207
01:26:37,629 --> 01:26:39,631
只有一次例外，那就是我離開他
...except my leaving him.

1208
01:26:47,597 --> 01:26:52,269
?
"Don't forget"

1209
01:26:52,352 --> 01:26:53,854
別緊張
Don't get nervous.

1210
01:26:53,979 --> 01:26:56,648
我們再來一遍
Please. Let's come back.

1211
01:26:58,233 --> 01:27:01,445
看著我，凱恩夫人
Look at me, Mrs. Kane, darling.

1212
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:10,495
聲音從喉嚨堨X來，掌握好音調
"Get the voice out of the throat Place the tone right in the mask

1213
01:27:16,710 --> 01:27:18,045
“控制好”
"Diaphragm"

1214
01:27:25,552 --> 01:27:27,846
你走音了
You're out of pitch.

1215
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,686
有些人能唱，有些人不能唱
Some people can sing. Some can't.

1216
01:27:34,853 --> 01:27:36,396
不可能的
Impossible.

1217
01:27:37,314 --> 01:27:40,400
您的任務不是對凱恩夫人的才能發表意見
It's not your job to give your opinion of Mrs. Kane's talents.

1218
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:45,906
您應當教她練嗓子，馬梯斯蒂先生 沒有別的
You're supposed to train her voice, Signor Matiste. Nothing more.

1219
01:27:46,615 --> 01:27:48,408
繼續你的課程吧
Please continue with the lesson.

1220
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:50,911
- 但是，凱恩先生 - 說
-But, Mr. Kane. -Please.

1221
01:27:51,912 --> 01:27:55,791
我會成為整個音樂界的笑柄！人們會認為…
I'll be the laughingstock of the musical world. People will think--

1222
01:27:55,832 --> 01:27:58,794
你擔心人們會怎麼想？
You're concerned what people will think?

1223
01:27:58,835 --> 01:28:03,423
或許我能夠給你點啟發 我可是這方面的權威
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit. I'm an authority on what people will think.

1224
01:28:04,132 --> 01:28:05,926
就拿報紙來說吧
The newspapers for example.

1225
01:28:06,176 --> 01:28:08,929
從這堥鴗T藩市的幾家報紙都是我開的
I run several newspapers between here and San Francisco.

1226
01:28:08,971 --> 01:28:10,430
一切都很好，親愛的
It's all right, darling.

1227
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:12,891
馬梯斯蒂先生會聽從正確意見的
Signor Matiste is going to listen to reason.

1228
01:28:13,809 --> 01:28:16,561
- 我怎樣才能使您相信… - 這您辦不到的
-How can I persuade you-- -You can't.

1229
01:28:42,796 --> 01:28:44,923
一切都很好，親愛的，繼續
It's all right, darling, go ahead.

1230
01:28:56,685 --> 01:28:59,438
你會用我的方式來看問題的
I thought you'd see it my way.

1231
01:29:09,698 --> 01:29:13,619
不，不，不
No, no, no.

1232
01:29:43,899 --> 01:29:47,402
?
"Ah, cruel

1233
01:29:48,737 --> 01:29:52,199
?
"Tu m'as trop entendue

1234
01:29:53,367 --> 01:29:56,870
?
"Les Dieux m'en sont t?oins

1235
01:29:57,329 --> 01:30:01,750
?
"Ces Dieux qui dans mon flanc

1236
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,169
?
"Ont allum?

1237
01:30:04,294 --> 01:30:07,005
?
"Le feu fatal

1238
01:30:07,422 --> 01:30:10,467
?
"A tout mon sang

1239
01:30:30,445 --> 01:30:35,409
?
"Dites-moi comment j'expie

1240
01:30:35,450 --> 01:30:38,704
?
"Ce p閏h?si fort

1241
01:30:40,789 --> 01:30:43,750
?
"Toujours remplie

1242
01:30:43,834 --> 01:30:48,839
?
"Je ne peux pas r閟ister encore

1243
01:30:52,259 --> 01:30:56,930
?
"Oh Dieux, arrachez-moi

1244
01:30:57,222 --> 01:30:59,641
?
"Ces feux fatals"

1245
01:30:59,725 --> 01:31:00,809
太糟糕了
I think it's dreadful.

1246
01:31:01,393 --> 01:31:05,939
?
"Allument ma mort

1247
01:31:10,694 --> 01:31:15,407
?
"Voil?mon coeur

1248
01:31:15,991 --> 01:31:20,829
?
"Voil?mon coeur

1249
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:25,334
?
"C'est l?que ta main doit frapper

1250
01:31:27,336 --> 01:31:30,297
?
"Voil?mon coeur

1251
01:31:32,341 --> 01:31:34,635
?
"Frappe

1252
01:31:35,844 --> 01:31:40,307
?
"Pr?e-moi ton 閜閑

1253
01:31:41,433 --> 01:31:43,810
?
"Frappe"

1254
01:32:40,409 --> 01:32:42,828
別跟我說他是你的朋友
Stop telling me he's your friend.

1255
01:32:43,245 --> 01:32:45,664
朋友就不會寫這樣的文章
A friend don't write that kind of review.

1256
01:32:45,747 --> 01:32:49,167
所有其他的報紙都在抨擊我，我都能理解
All these other papers panning me, I could expect that.

1257
01:32:49,251 --> 01:32:53,046
但《問事報》這樣做，毀了我的首次演出
But for the Inquirer to run a thing like that, spoiling my whole debut.

1258
01:32:53,088 --> 01:32:53,880
進來
Come in.

1259
01:32:53,922 --> 01:32:54,881
我來開門
I'll get it.

1260
01:32:54,965 --> 01:32:57,801
朋友？不是我能理解的那種朋友
Friend. Not the kind of friends I know...

1261
01:32:58,093 --> 01:33:00,095
我不是你那個上流社會的人
...but I'm not high class like you.

1262
01:33:00,345 --> 01:33:02,389
我從沒上過任何貴族學校
And I never went to any swell schools.

1263
01:33:02,472 --> 01:33:03,932
夠了，蘇珊
That'll be enough, Susan.

1264
01:33:03,974 --> 01:33:05,225
李蘭先生給你的
From Mr. Leland, sir.

1265
01:33:05,767 --> 01:33:08,895
他要我送給你本人
He wanted me to make sure you got this personally.

1266
01:33:09,187 --> 01:33:11,815
是他來的信？
Is that something from him?

1267
01:33:13,275 --> 01:33:14,484
查利！
Charlie!

1268
01:33:15,277 --> 01:33:19,114
而你，也應該清醒清醒了！
As for you, you ought to have your head examined.

1269
01:33:19,323 --> 01:33:21,908
你給他解雇通知…
Sending him a letter telling him he's fired...

1270
01:33:21,950 --> 01:33:24,453
卻在信封堳o附去一張25000元的支票！
...with a $25,000 check in it.

1271
01:33:24,536 --> 01:33:27,080
這叫解雇嗎？？
What kind of firing do you call that?

1272
01:33:27,748 --> 01:33:32,002
你真的送了他一張25000元的支票？
You did send him a check for $25,000, didn't you?

1273
01:33:33,295 --> 01:33:34,296
是的
Yes.

1274
01:33:36,798 --> 01:33:40,010
我送了他一張25000元的支票
I sent him a check for $25,000.

1275
01:33:42,638 --> 01:33:44,097
那是什麼？
What's that?

1276
01:33:45,307 --> 01:33:46,808
原則聲明
Declaration of Principles.

1277
01:33:46,892 --> 01:33:47,976
什麼？
What?

1278
01:33:48,685 --> 01:33:49,770
是什麼？
What is it?

1279
01:33:55,609 --> 01:33:56,610
真是少見的事
An antique.

1280
01:33:56,693 --> 01:33:59,446
你真可笑，對嗎？
You're awful funny, aren't you?

1281
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:04,826
我要告訴你一件讓你再也笑不出來的事 就是我唱歌的事
I'll tell you one thing you're not going to be funny about, and that's my singing.

1282
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:06,036
我再也不唱了！
I'm through.

1283
01:34:06,119 --> 01:34:08,622
我從一開始就沒想要唱歌
I never wanted to do it in the first place.

1284
01:34:09,164 --> 01:34:11,667
你要繼續唱，蘇珊
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.

1285
01:34:11,833 --> 01:34:14,628
我不願意讓人家看我的笑話
I don't propose to have myself made ridiculous.

1286
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:17,965
你不願意讓人家看你的笑話
You don't propose to have yourself made ridiculous!

1287
01:34:18,048 --> 01:34:21,385
那我呢？唱還得我來唱啊！
What about me? I'm the one that has to sing.

1288
01:34:21,468 --> 01:34:23,428
就必須是我來讓人家噓嗎！
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.

1289
01:34:23,512 --> 01:34:25,347
為什麼你不能讓我自己決定？
Why don't you leave me alone?

1290
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:27,140
我的理由很充分，蘇珊
My reasons satisfy me, Susan.

1291
01:34:27,224 --> 01:34:29,351
看來你還理解不了
You seem unable to understand them.

1292
01:34:30,227 --> 01:34:32,479
我也不想再重複了
I will not tell them to you again.

1293
01:34:36,149 --> 01:34:38,318
你還得唱下去！
You'll continue with your singing.

1294
01:36:10,786 --> 01:36:12,621
叫凱萊醫生
Get Dr. Corey.

1295
01:36:17,042 --> 01:36:18,126
蘇珊
Susan.

1296
01:36:19,002 --> 01:36:22,631
她過一兩天就會完全康復的，凱恩先生
She'll be perfectly all right in a day or two, Mr. Kane.

1297
01:36:24,633 --> 01:36:28,679
我沒想到凱恩夫人會幹出這種蠢事來
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a foolish mistake.

1298
01:36:29,179 --> 01:36:33,767
華格納醫生給她的鎮定劑 是在一個大瓶子婺佽菄
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her was in a somewhat larger bottle.

1299
01:36:34,142 --> 01:36:38,605
為了準備初次演出，她太緊張，太激動了
The strain of preparing for the new opera has excited and confused her.

1300
01:36:38,689 --> 01:36:40,941
是啊，我相信問題正是這樣
Yes, I'm sure that was it.

1301
01:36:41,733 --> 01:36:44,486
您不反對我留在這兒嗎？
No objections to my staying with her are there?

1302
01:36:44,653 --> 01:36:48,740
沒關係，但我希望護士也留下
No, not at all. I'd like the nurse to be here, too.

1303
01:36:49,533 --> 01:36:51,660
晚安，凱恩先生
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1304
01:37:27,195 --> 01:37:28,822
查利
Charlie.

1305
01:37:31,533 --> 01:37:34,202
我無法使你理解我的感受，查利
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.

1306
01:37:36,163 --> 01:37:38,915
但我不能再繼續唱下去了
But I couldn't go through with the singing again.

1307
01:37:40,834 --> 01:37:44,046
你不瞭解，當我知道所有的觀眾…
You don't know what it means to know that people....

1308
01:37:45,547 --> 01:37:48,342
都不想聽我唱的時候，我是什麼感覺
That the whole audience doesn't want you.

1309
01:37:51,970 --> 01:37:54,056
那你就得去和他們抗爭
That's when you got to fight them.

1310
01:38:02,481 --> 01:38:04,024
好吧
All right.

1311
01:38:05,984 --> 01:38:08,403
你再也不用跟他們抗爭了
You won't have to fight them anymore.

1312
01:38:11,698 --> 01:38:13,825
他們只會有所損失
It's their loss.

1313
01:38:29,466 --> 01:38:31,218
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

1314
01:38:35,681 --> 01:38:37,683
拼圖遊戲？
Jigsaw puzzles?

1315
01:38:42,813 --> 01:38:44,815
查利！幾點了？
Charlie, what time is it?

1316
01:38:45,399 --> 01:38:46,900
-11?30
-11:30.

1317
01:38:47,067 --> 01:38:48,485
紐約呢？
In New York?

1318
01:38:51,405 --> 01:38:54,241
我是問現在紐約幾點了？
I said what time is it in New York?

1319
01:38:55,075 --> 01:38:58,203
-11?30 - 晚上？
-11 :30. -Night?

1320
01:39:01,790 --> 01:39:03,625
報紙剛剛付印
The Bulldog's just gone to press.

1321
01:39:03,709 --> 01:39:06,920
這真該祝賀啊！
Well, hurray for the Bulldog.

1322
01:39:08,755 --> 01:39:12,551
-11?30，演出剛開始
Gee, 11:30. Shows are just getting up.

1323
01:39:12,676 --> 01:39:15,429
人們正在趕往夜總會和賓館
People are going to nightclubs and restaurants.

1324
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:19,474
當然，我們這兒不一樣，我們住在宮殿堙I
Of course, we're different because we live in a palace.

1325
01:39:19,558 --> 01:39:22,185
你不老是說想住在宮殿媔隉H
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.

1326
01:39:22,269 --> 01:39:24,646
在這地方人會瘋掉的
A person could go crazy in this dump.

1327
01:39:24,813 --> 01:39:28,650
沒有人說話，沒有人玩
Nobody to talk to, nobody to have any fun with.

1328
01:39:29,401 --> 01:39:33,280
-49，000英畝，除了雕像和風景 什麼都沒有
-49,000 acres of nothing but scenery and statues.

1329
01:39:33,488 --> 01:39:34,990
我很寂寞
I'm lonesome.

1330
01:39:35,032 --> 01:39:38,994
到昨天為止，每次都有50多個朋友來啊
Until yesterday, we've had no less than 50 of your friends at any one time.

1331
01:39:39,036 --> 01:39:41,788
我覺得如果你看看西翼…
I think if you look in the west wing...

1332
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:44,958
你會發現還有十幾個度假者還在這堸
...you'll probably find a dozen vacationists still in residence.

1333
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,628
不管什麼你都拿來當笑話說
You make a joke out of everything.

1334
01:39:48,128 --> 01:39:52,758
查理，我想去紐約，我厭煩了做女主人
Charlie, I want to go to New York. I'm tired of being a hostess.

1335
01:39:52,841 --> 01:39:56,678
查理，我需要快樂，拜託了
I want to have fun. Please, Charlie.

1336
01:39:58,388 --> 01:40:01,224
查理，求求你了
Charlie, please.

1337
01:40:02,184 --> 01:40:04,811
我們的家在這堙A蘇珊
Our home is here, Susan.

1338
01:40:10,567 --> 01:40:12,819
我不介意去紐約玩玩
I don't care to visit New York.

1339
01:40:49,731 --> 01:40:51,525
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

1340
01:40:54,486 --> 01:40:57,781
有一點我怎麼也不明白?
One thing I can never understand:

1341
01:40:57,864 --> 01:41:00,033
你怎麼知道，哪些圖塊你曾經拼過？
How do you know you haven't done it before?

1342
01:41:00,117 --> 01:41:04,121
這比你收集雕像要有意思得多
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting statues.

1343
01:41:05,747 --> 01:41:07,332
也許你是對的
You may be right.

1344
01:41:07,749 --> 01:41:09,835
有時我也很困惑
I sometimes wonder...

1345
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:12,629
但這已經成為習慣了
...but you get into the habit.

1346
01:41:12,713 --> 01:41:15,590
完全不是習慣，我玩這個是因為我喜歡它
It's not a habit, I do it because I like it.

1347
01:41:16,008 --> 01:41:18,593
我想，明天我們可以去野餐
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.

1348
01:41:20,971 --> 01:41:24,016
把大家都請來，一起到埃佛格雷德去
Invite everybody to spend the night at the Everglades.

1349
01:41:24,266 --> 01:41:28,645
把大家都請來？你是想說，命令他們來 讓他們都睡在帳篷
Invite everybody. Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents.

1350
01:41:28,729 --> 01:41:31,732
誰願意睡帳篷，他們都有自己的房間…
Who wants to sleep in tents when they've got their own room...

1351
01:41:31,773 --> 01:41:34,401
…和浴室，一切都很方便
...with a bath, where they know where everything is?

1352
01:41:34,484 --> 01:41:37,904
我想，明天我們可以去野餐
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.

1353
01:41:41,241 --> 01:41:45,579
我真正關心的事你都視而不見
You never give me anything I really care about.

1354
01:41:54,129 --> 01:41:56,006
這不是愛
"It can't be love

1355
01:41:58,508 --> 01:42:03,138
因為這堥S有真愛
"For there is no true love

1356
01:42:03,513 --> 01:42:06,016
我知道我在玩愛情遊戲
"l know I've played at the game

1357
01:42:06,099 --> 01:42:08,977
就像縈繞在燈光堛滿螂
"Like a moth in a blue flame

1358
01:42:09,019 --> 01:42:12,856
和它一樣，一無所得
"Lost in the end, just the same

1359
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:15,442
這些年
"All these years

1360
01:42:15,609 --> 01:42:20,489
我含著淚水，心無定所
"My heart's been floating around in a puddle of tears

1361
01:42:22,908 --> 01:42:24,868
“我想知道這到底是什麼”
"l wonder what it is"

1362
01:42:24,952 --> 01:42:28,997
是的，你給了我很多東西 但那些東西對你都是毫無意義的
Sure, you give me things, but that don't mean anything to you.

1363
01:42:31,416 --> 01:42:34,503
你不是在家堙A是在帳篷堙A親愛的！
You're in a tent, darling, you're not at home.

1364
01:42:34,586 --> 01:42:37,965
我能聽清楚的，不要用那麼大嗓門
I can hear you very well if you speak in a normal tone of voice.

1365
01:42:38,006 --> 01:42:41,969
這有什麼不同，給我一隻手鐲或者 化100000元…
What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving someone $100,000...

1366
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:45,055
買一尊放在櫃子堭q來都不看的雕像？
...for a statue you'll keep crated up and never look at?

1367
01:42:45,138 --> 01:42:47,516
那隻不過是錢，不代表任何東西
It's just money. It doesn't mean anything.

1368
01:42:47,599 --> 01:42:50,811
你所在意的東西從來沒給過我
You never really gave me anything that you care about.

1369
01:42:50,894 --> 01:42:52,688
不要再說了，蘇珊
I want you to stop this.

1370
01:42:52,771 --> 01:42:54,189
我還要說
I'm not going to stop it.

1371
01:42:54,273 --> 01:42:56,566
你從來也沒有給過我什麼！
You never gave me anything in your life.

1372
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:59,945
你只是買下你來為你作奉獻
You just tried to buy me into giving you something.

1373
01:43:02,698 --> 01:43:06,618
“這不是愛”
"It can't be love"

1374
01:43:19,464 --> 01:43:22,050
無論我做什麼，都是因為我愛你
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.

1375
01:43:22,134 --> 01:43:24,094
你不愛我
You don't love me.

1376
01:43:24,219 --> 01:43:26,179
你要我愛你
You want me to love you.

1377
01:43:26,221 --> 01:43:29,182
當然，我是查理斯·福斯特·凱恩
Sure. "I? Charles Foster Kane.

1378
01:43:29,224 --> 01:43:31,852
無論你要什麼，只要你說一聲好了
"Whatever you want, just name it and it's yours.

1379
01:43:31,935 --> 01:43:34,187
“但是你必須愛我”
"But you gotta love me."

1380
01:43:38,650 --> 01:43:41,361
不要說對不起
Don't tell me you're sorry.

1381
01:43:43,322 --> 01:43:45,073
我不會道歉的
I'm not sorry.

1382
01:43:56,918 --> 01:43:58,503
凱恩先生？
Mr. Kane?

1383
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:01,673
凱恩夫人想見你
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.

1384
01:44:04,551 --> 01:44:07,721
從一早起，梅莉就在收拾夫人的東西
Marie has been packing for her since morning.

1385
01:44:13,810 --> 01:44:17,522
梅莉，告訴阿爾諾德，我準備好了 告訴他可以來搬東西了
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie. Tell him he can get the bags.

1386
01:44:18,065 --> 01:44:19,316
好的，夫人
Yes, madame.

1387
01:44:21,318 --> 01:44:23,695
你真的瘋了嗎？
Have you gone completely crazy?

1388
01:44:23,779 --> 01:44:27,032
難道你不明白 我們的客人，每個人都知道這件事了嗎？
Don't you know that our guests, that everyone will know about this?

1389
01:44:27,115 --> 01:44:28,951
收拾好了東西，叫了汽車…
Packed your bag, sent for the car--

1390
01:44:29,034 --> 01:44:30,077
並且離開你？
And left you?

1391
01:44:30,369 --> 01:44:32,287
他們當然會知道的
Of course they'll hear.

1392
01:44:33,288 --> 01:44:35,958
除了你，我不和別人說再見
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you.

1393
01:44:36,166 --> 01:44:39,002
我認為這件事不可能不讓人知道
But I never imagined people wouldn't know.

1394
01:44:41,463 --> 01:44:43,340
我不讓你走
I won't let you go.

1395
01:44:50,681 --> 01:44:52,307
再見，查利
Goodbye, Charlie.

1396
01:44:55,894 --> 01:44:57,312
蘇珊
Susan.

1397
01:45:07,489 --> 01:45:09,116
別走了
Please don't go.

1398
01:45:14,746 --> 01:45:16,540
求求你，蘇珊
Please, Susan.

1399
01:45:19,751 --> 01:45:23,213
從現在開始，一切都按照你的意思辦
From now on, everything will be exactly the way you want it to be.

1400
01:45:23,297 --> 01:45:25,424
不是我所認為的你的意思，而是…
Not the way I think you want it, but...

1401
01:45:27,092 --> 01:45:28,593
…真正的你的方式
...your way.

1402
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:36,435
你不能走
You mustn't go.

1403
01:45:39,688 --> 01:45:41,815
你不能這樣對我
You can't do this to me.

1404
01:45:43,525 --> 01:45:45,193
我明白了
I see.

1405
01:45:46,111 --> 01:45:48,655
又是只有你！
It's you that this is being done to.

1406
01:45:48,989 --> 01:45:50,782
我不算什麼
It's not me at all.

1407
01:45:51,033 --> 01:45:52,951
對我意味著什麼，也不重要
Not what it means to me.

1408
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:57,289
我不能這樣對待你？
I can't do this to you?

1409
01:45:58,749 --> 01:46:00,709
噢，不，我能這樣
Oh, yes, I can.

1410
01:46:19,853 --> 01:46:22,981
也許您聽說過，我失去了所有的金錢 真的是很多的錢
In case you haven't heard, I lost all my money and it was plenty.

1411
01:46:23,065 --> 01:46:25,359
最近十年，很多人都很困難
The last 10 years have been difficult for many.

1412
01:46:25,442 --> 01:46:28,403
我並不困難，我只不過是喪失了金錢
They haven't been tough on me. I just lost all my money.

1413
01:46:29,029 --> 01:46:32,199
- 您要到上都莊園去嗎？ - 星期一，和編輯部的幾個同事一起去
-You're going down to Xanadu? -Monday, with boys from the office.

1414
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:35,035
若爾斯東先生讓我們把整個莊園都拍下來
Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed.

1415
01:46:35,077 --> 01:46:36,703
我們要出一個新聞片專輯
We run a picture magazine.

1416
01:46:36,745 --> 01:46:40,499
如果你夠聰明，就該去找雷蒙，他是管家
If you're smart, you'll get in touch with Raymond. He's the butler.

1417
01:46:40,582 --> 01:46:42,542
從他那兒您會瞭解很多事
You'll learn a lot from him.

1418
01:46:42,626 --> 01:46:45,128
別人不知道的，他都知道
He knows where all the bodies are buried.

1419
01:46:45,295 --> 01:46:48,507
您知道嗎，我總是為凱恩先生感到惋惜
You know, all the same, I feel kind of sorry for Mr. Kane.

1420
01:46:50,759 --> 01:46:52,427
您以為我就不為他惋惜嗎？
Don't you think I do?

1421
01:46:57,015 --> 01:46:59,977
您從我這瞭解些什麼呢？…已經是早上了
What do you know, it's morning already.

1422
01:47:03,438 --> 01:47:07,067
有空到我這兒來，跟我談談您自己
Come around and tell me the story of your life sometime.

1423
01:47:14,074 --> 01:47:15,659
玫瑰花蕾？
Rosebud?

1424
01:47:18,287 --> 01:47:20,372
要是我告訴您與玫瑰花蕾有關的情況
I'll tell you about Rosebud.

1425
01:47:20,872 --> 01:47:22,791
您給多少錢哪？
How much is it worth to you?

1426
01:47:23,375 --> 01:47:25,168
-1000塊？
$1,000?

1427
01:47:34,469 --> 01:47:37,180
好吧，我告訴你，湯姆森先生
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.

1428
01:47:37,889 --> 01:47:41,310
- 你知道嗎？他有時做事很可笑 - 不，我不知道
-He acted funny sometimes, you know? -No, I didn't.

1429
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:43,979
他有時候很古怪
Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.

1430
01:47:44,313 --> 01:47:46,732
我在他這兒幹了十一年…
I've been working for him 11 years now...

1431
01:47:46,815 --> 01:47:50,611
管理整個莊園，我應該知道
...in charge of the whole place, so I ought to know.

1432
01:47:50,986 --> 01:47:52,279
- 玫瑰花蕾 - 是的
-Rosebud. -Yes.

1433
01:47:52,321 --> 01:47:57,326
正如我說的，他有時候很古怪…
Like I tell you, the old man acted kind of funny sometimes...

1434
01:47:57,409 --> 01:48:01,121
但我知道怎麼和他相處… - 和他在一起很麻煩嗎？
-...but I knew how to handle him-- -Need a lot of service?

1435
01:48:01,204 --> 01:48:04,249
是啊，但我知道怎麼和他相處
But I knew how to handle him.

1436
01:48:04,374 --> 01:48:06,084
比如他妻子離開的時候
Like that time his wife left.

1437
01:50:21,803 --> 01:50:23,055
玫瑰花蕾
Rosebud.

1438
01:51:31,123 --> 01:51:32,666
我知道了
I see.

1439
01:51:33,333 --> 01:51:35,794
這就是你所知道的玫瑰花蕾？
And that's what you know about Rosebud?

1440
01:51:37,337 --> 01:51:39,715
我在別的時候也聽他說過
I heard him say it that other time, too.

1441
01:51:40,382 --> 01:51:42,301
他只是說：
He just said:

1442
01:51:42,676 --> 01:51:44,511
“玫瑰花蕾”
"Rosebud."

1443
01:51:44,553 --> 01:51:47,848
那個玻璃球就從手中掉了下去，摔碎了
Then he dropped the glass ball and it broke on the floor.

1444
01:51:48,557 --> 01:51:52,769
之後凱恩先生就再也不說話了 於是我知道他已經死了
He didn't say anything after that, and I knew he was dead.

1445
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,231
他還說過好多莫名其妙的話
He said all kinds of things that didn't mean anything.

1446
01:51:56,315 --> 01:51:58,317
您就沒有一點傷感嗎？
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1447
01:51:59,401 --> 01:52:02,070
- 也有，也沒有 - 這些不值1000元
-Yes and no. -That isn't worth $1,000.

1448
01:52:02,154 --> 01:52:05,157
如果您願意，可以向我提問題
You can keep on asking questions if you want to.

1449
01:52:05,407 --> 01:52:07,075
今天晚上就走…
We're leaving tonight...

1450
01:52:07,868 --> 01:52:09,828
等他們把宮殿拍完我們就走
...when we're through taking pictures.

1451
01:52:09,911 --> 01:52:11,872
多留點時間給自己
Allow yourself plenty of time.

1452
01:52:11,913 --> 01:52:15,792
火車根據信號停站 但他們不喜歡等人
The train stops at the junction on signal, but they don't like to wait.

1453
01:52:16,835 --> 01:52:19,796
九千一百八十二號
I can remember when they'd wait all day...

1454
01:52:20,130 --> 01:52:21,840
可我記得，他們曾等人等了一天…
...if Mr. Kane said so.

1455
01:52:23,258 --> 01:52:25,844
如果凱恩先生讓他們等
Better get going.

1456
01:52:28,847 --> 01:52:32,768
- 我們可以下來了？ - 是的，快點，我們要走了
-Can we come down? -Yes, hurry up. We're leaving.

1457
01:52:34,978 --> 01:52:38,440
你認為這些東西總共值多少？湯普遜先生
How much do you think this is all worth, Mr. Thompson?

1458
01:52:38,649 --> 01:52:40,192
好幾百萬吧
Millions.

1459
01:52:41,652 --> 01:52:42,861
如果有人需要的話
If anybody wants it.

1460
01:52:42,945 --> 01:52:45,614
至少他把這些東西帶到了美國
Well, at least he brought all this stuff to America.

1461
01:52:45,697 --> 01:52:47,449
- 那是什麼？ - 另一個維納斯
-What's that? -Another Venus.

1462
01:52:47,532 --> 01:52:48,867
價值25000元
$25,000.

1463
01:52:48,951 --> 01:52:51,536
花這麼多錢買一個無頭的東西
A lot of money to pay for a dame without a head.

1464
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:53,789
銀行太倒楣了？
The banks are out of luck?

1465
01:52:55,290 --> 01:52:58,043
- 他們都是即時結清的 - 他從來不扔東西
-They'll clear all right. -He never threw anything away.

1466
01:52:58,126 --> 01:53:03,298
“歡迎凱恩先生歸來 紐約《問事報》467名雇員贈”
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467 employees of the New York Inquirer."

1467
01:53:03,382 --> 01:53:08,762
“鐵爐子一個，卡羅拉多，小薩拉姆 瑪麗·凱恩的財產，價格：2元”
"One stove from the estate of Mary Kane, Little Salem, Colorado. Value: $2."

1468
01:53:08,804 --> 01:53:11,306
這兒真是什麼東西都有 有破爛，也有藝術品
We're supposed to get everything, junk as well as art.

1469
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:13,100
他確實喜歡收藏
He sure liked to collect things.

1470
01:53:13,141 --> 01:53:14,559
任何東西，所有東西
Anything and everything.

1471
01:53:14,643 --> 01:53:16,353
像個烏鴉嗎？
A regular crow, eh?

1472
01:53:16,436 --> 01:53:19,147
- 嘿，看，一個拼圖遊戲 - 那種東西有不少
-Hey, look, a jigsaw puzzle. -We got a lot of those.

1473
01:53:19,231 --> 01:53:22,276
- 大廳媮晹魚q甸廟宇和西班牙閣樓呢！ - 是啊，還都是拼好的呢
A Burmese temple and three Spanish ceilings down the hall.

1474
01:53:22,776 --> 01:53:24,236
那兒還有半個蘇格蘭城堡…
Part of a Scotch castle...

1475
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:26,113
也沒必要去把它拆掉
...that needs to be unwrapped.

1476
01:53:26,488 --> 01:53:27,948
我想知道，所有這一切?
Put all this stuff together:

1477
01:53:28,031 --> 01:53:31,159
宮殿、油畫、玩具以及所有的東西
The palaces and the paintings, and the toys and everything.

1478
01:53:31,243 --> 01:53:33,245
能有什麼含義呢？
What would it spell?

1479
01:53:34,663 --> 01:53:37,457
- 查理斯·福斯特·凱恩？ - 或者玫瑰花蕾
-Charles Foster Kane? -Or Rosebud.

1480
01:53:37,708 --> 01:53:40,961
- 弄清楚了嗎，傑利？ - 玫瑰花蕾是什麼？
-How about it, Jerry? -What's Rosebud?

1481
01:53:41,044 --> 01:53:43,297
那是他的臨終遺言
That's what he said when he died.

1482
01:53:43,964 --> 01:53:46,133
你搞清楚它是什麼意思了嗎？
Did you ever find out what it means?

1483
01:53:46,174 --> 01:53:48,427
- 沒有 - 關於凱恩你又瞭解多少？
-No, I didn't. -What did you find out about him?

1484
01:53:48,510 --> 01:53:49,970
確實不多
Not much, really.

1485
01:53:53,098 --> 01:53:54,808
我們最好是從頭開始
We'd better get started.

1486
01:53:56,727 --> 01:53:59,146
你最近一直在做什麼？
What have you been doing all this time?

1487
01:54:00,188 --> 01:54:01,815
玩拼圖遊戲
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle.

1488
01:54:01,857 --> 01:54:05,652
要是您知道玫瑰花蕾是什麼 我保證，能把這堛漱@切都解釋清楚
If you'd discovered what Rosebud meant, I bet it would've explained everything.

1489
01:54:05,694 --> 01:54:07,279
不，我不這樣認為
No, I don't think so.

1490
01:54:07,904 --> 01:54:09,323
不
No.

1491
01:54:09,448 --> 01:54:12,993
他得到了他想要的一切，接著又都失去了
He was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it.

1492
01:54:13,118 --> 01:54:16,830
也許，玫瑰花蕾是他沒能得到的東西 或者是他失去的東西
Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or something he lost.

1493
01:54:16,872 --> 01:54:19,166
這都不能說明什麼
It wouldn't have explained anything.

1494
01:54:20,042 --> 01:54:23,170
我不認為四個字能解釋一個人的一生
I don't think any word can explain a man's life.

1495
01:54:24,129 --> 01:54:28,342
我猜測玫瑰花蕾只是拼圖遊戲堛 一片紙板
No. I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle.

1496
01:54:29,509 --> 01:54:31,219
缺少的一片
A missing piece.

1497
01:54:37,059 --> 01:54:39,227
大家快點
Come on, everybody...

1498
01:54:41,063 --> 01:54:43,315
不然我們要誤車了
...we'll miss the train.

1499
01:55:48,005 --> 01:55:50,257
把這些沒用的東西也扔進去吧
Throw that junk in.

3
3
01:57:21,853 --> 01:57:25,657
後面自己翻譯的不好，請見諒

1500
01:57:26,853 --> 01:57:30,857
也許我就是現在所稱的配角
Maybe I was what you nowadays call a stooge.

1501
01:57:31,483 --> 01:57:33,485
所有的東西都是他的想像
Everything was his idea...

1502
01:57:35,445 --> 01:57:37,447
除了我會離他而去
...except my leaving him.

1503
01:57:38,365 --> 01:57:40,367
我已經收拾好他的衣箱了
I've got his trunk all packed.

1504
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:43,829
我已經收拾好一周了
I've had it packed for a week now.

1505
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:47,541
有時我想我喜歡一個有血有肉的競爭對手。
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival of flesh and blood.

1506
01:57:49,251 --> 01:57:51,753
你需要再多上一課。
You're gonna need more than one lesson.

1507
01:57:52,921 --> 01:57:55,382
你得到的將多於這一課。
And you'll get more than one lesson.

1508
01:58:00,679 --> 01:58:02,180
誰是忙碌的人，我？
Who's a busy man, me?

1509
01:58:02,431 --> 01:58:05,726
我是董事長，我僅僅有時間。
I'm chairman of the board. I got nothing but time.

1510
01:58:05,934 --> 01:58:07,352
你想知道些什麼？
What do you want to know?

1511
01:58:07,436 --> 01:58:12,065
我們認為，如果我們找到他死前說的四個字的意義...
We thought.... If we could find out what he meant by his last words as he was dying....

1512
01:58:12,566 --> 01:58:14,735
多愁善感的傢夥，不是嗎？
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1513
01:58:16,111 --> 01:58:17,237
對或者錯。
Yes and no.

1514
01:58:17,613 --> 01:58:20,407
我想，這將是一個有趣的新聞。
"l think it would be fun to run a newspaper."

1515
01:58:20,824 --> 01:58:24,328
我想，這將是一個有趣的新聞。
"l think it would be fun to run a newspaper."
