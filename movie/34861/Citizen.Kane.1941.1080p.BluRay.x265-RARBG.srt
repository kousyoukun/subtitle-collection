1
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,903
Rosebud.

2
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,277
News on the March.

3
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,798
Legendary was the Xanadu...

4
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,468
...where Kubla Khan decreed
his stately pleasure dome.

5
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:43,097
Today, almost as legendary,
is Florida's Xanadu...

6
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,225
...the world's largest
private pleasure ground.

7
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,689
Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast,
a private mountain...

8
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,900
...was commissioned
and successfully built.

9
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,236
One hundred thousand trees,
twenty thousand tons of marble...

10
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,989
...are the ingredients
of Xanadu's mountain.

11
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,409
Contents of Xanadu's palace:

12
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,705
Paintings, pictures, statues,
various stones of other palaces.

13
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,916
A collection of everything.

14
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,252
So big it can never
be cataloged or appraised.

15
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,256
Enough for 10 museums,
the loot of the world.

16
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,803
Xanadu's livestock...

17
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:29,352
...the fowl of the air, the fish of the
sea, the beast of the field and jungle...

18
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,940
...two of each,
the biggest private zoo since Noah.

19
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,692
Like the pharaohs...

20
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,821
...Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones
to mark his grave.

21
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,866
Since the pyramids...

22
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,744
...Xanadu is the costliest monument...

23
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,330
...a man has built to himself.

24
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,012
Here in Xanadu last week...

25
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,265
...Xanadu's landlord was laid to rest.

26
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,310
A potent figure of our century...

27
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,604
...America's Kubla Khan:

28
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,898
Charles Foster Kane.

29
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:48,389
Its humble beginnings,
in this ramshackle building, a dying daily.

30
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,975
Kane's empire, in its glory...

31
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:55,271
...held dominion over 37 newspapers,
two syndicates...

32
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,026
...a radio network,
an empire upon an empire.

33
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,946
The first of grocery stores, paper mills...

34
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:09,702
...apartment buildings,
factories, forests, ocean liners.

35
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,122
An empire through which for 50 years...

36
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,708
...flowed in an unending stream...

37
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,211
...the wealth of the Earth's
third richest gold mine.

38
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,716
Famed in American legend
is the origin of the Kane fortune.

39
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:29,388
How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane,
by a defaulting boarder, in 1868...

40
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:33,309
...was left the supposedly worthless deed
to an abandoned mineshaft:

41
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,520
The Colorado Lode.

42
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:40,775
Fifty-seven years later,
before a congressional investigation...

43
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,320
...Walter P. Thatcher,
grand old man of Wall Street...

44
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:48,115
...for years chief target
of Kane papers' attacks on trusts...

45
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,576
...recalls a journey he made as a youth.

46
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,080
My firm had been appointed trustee
by Mrs. Kane...

47
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,499
...for a large fortune
she recently acquired.

48
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,920
It was her wish that I take charge
of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.

49
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:05,508
Chief, is it not, that on this occasion,
Charles Foster Kane...

50
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,637
...personally attacked you after
striking you in the stomach with a sled?

51
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,849
I shall read to the committee
a prepared statement...

52
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:19,480
...which I have brought with me,
and then refuse to answer questions.

53
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,234
Mr. Charles Foster Kane,
in every essence of his social beliefs...

54
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,320
...and by the dangerous manner
he has persistently attacked...

55
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,656
...American traditions
of private property...

56
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,075
...initiative and opportunity
for advancement...

57
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:35,079
...is, in fact, nothing more or less
than a communist.

58
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,665
That same month in Union Square...

59
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,376
The words "Charles Foster Kane"...

60
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:44,046
...are a menace
to every workingman in this land.

61
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:49,718
He is today what he has always been
A fascist.

62
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,595
And still another opinion...

63
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,575
Kane urged his country's entry
into one war...

64
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,411
...opposed participation in another.

65
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,456
Swung the election
to one American president at least.

66
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,918
Spoke for millions of Americans.

67
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,880
Was hated by as many more.

68
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,758
For 40 years
appeared in Kane newsprint...

69
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,346
...no public issue
on which Kane papers took no stand.

70
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:40,060
No public man whom Kane himself
did not support or denounce.

71
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:44,231
Often support, then denounce.

72
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,951
Twice married, twice divorced.

73
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,495
First to a president's niece...

74
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,749
...Emily Norton, who left him in 1916.

75
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,878
Died 1918 in a motor accident
with their son.

76
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,633
Sixteen years after his first marriage...

77
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,093
...two weeks after his first divorce...

78
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,387
...Kane married Susan Alexander...

79
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,807
...singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton,
New Jersey.

80
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:25,064
For wife two, one-time opera-singing
Susan Alexander...

81
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,317
...Kane built
Chicago's Municipal Opera House.

82
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,945
$3 million.

83
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:36,992
Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane,
half-finished before she divorced him...

84
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,161
...the still unfinished...

85
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,663
...Xanadu.

86
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,999
No man can say.

87
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,673
Kane, molder of mass opinion
though he was...

88
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,467
...in all his life
was never granted elective office...

89
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,219
...by the voters of his country.

90
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,097
But Kane papers
were once strong indeed...

91
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,766
...and once the prize seemed almost his.

92
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,436
In 1916, as independent candidate
for governor...

93
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,939
...the best elements of the state
behind him...

94
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:11,860
...the White House seemingly the next easy
step in a lightning political career...

95
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,864
...then suddenly, less than one week
before election...

96
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,703
...defeat.
Shameful, ignominious.

97
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,456
Defeat that set back for 20 years
the cause of reform in the U. S...

98
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,252
...forever canceled political chances
for Charles Foster Kane.

99
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,842
Then, in the first year
of the Great Depression...

100
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,344
...a Kane paper closes.

101
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:41,015
For Kane, in four short years, collapse.

102
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:46,603
Eleven Kane papers merged,
more sold, scrapped.

103
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,281
Is that correct?

104
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,700
Don't believe everything you hear
on the radio.

105
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,704
- Read the Inquirer.
- How were business conditions in Europe?

106
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:07,750
How did I find business conditions
in Europe, Mr. Bones?

107
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,251
With great difficulty.

108
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,756
Are you glad to be back?

109
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,425
I'm always glad to be back.
I'm an American.

110
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,762
Always been an American.
Anything else?

111
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,931
When I was a reporter,
we asked them quicker than that.

112
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,559
What do you think
of the chances for war in Europe?

113
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,980
I talked with the responsible leaders
of England, France, Germany and Italy.

114
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,524
They're too intelligent
to embark on a project...

115
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,152
...which would mean
the end of civilization.

116
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,822
You can take my word for it,
there will be no war.

117
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,829
Kane helped to change the world...

118
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,624
...but Kane's world now is history...

119
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,127
...and the great yellow journalist himself
lived to be history...

120
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,588
...outlived his power to make it.

121
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:59,468
Alone in his never-finished,
already decaying pleasure palace...

122
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,138
...aloof, seldom visited,
never photographed...

123
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:07,935
...an emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing empire.

124
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,813
Vainly attempted to sway,
as he once did...

125
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,525
...the destinies of a nation
that had ceased to listen to him...

126
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,443
...ceased to trust him.

127
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:23,283
Then last week, as it must to all men...

128
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,036
...death came to Charles Foster Kane.

129
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,498
News on the March.

130
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,796
- That's it.
- Hello. Hello.

131
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,841
- Stand by.
- I'll tell you if we want to run it again.

132
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,552
- How about it, Mr. Rawlston?
- How do you like it?

133
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,345
Seventy years in a man's life.

134
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,556
That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.

135
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,058
It's a good short,
but what it needs is an angle.

136
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,437
All we saw on that screen
was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.

137
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,605
I know that. I read the papers.

138
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,400
It isn't enough
to tell us what a man did...

139
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,653
...you've got to tell us who he was.

140
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,031
Wait a minute.
What were Kane's last words?

141
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,033
Do you remember, boys?

142
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,536
What were the last words
he said on Earth?

143
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,830
Maybe he told us about himself
on his deathbed.

144
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,916
- Maybe he didn't.
- All we saw was a big American.

145
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,836
How did he differ from Ford,
Hearst or John Doe?

146
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,672
- Yeah, sure.
- I tell you, a man's dying words...

147
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,799
- What were they?
- You don't read the papers.

148
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,385
When Charles Foster Kane died,
he said one word:

149
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,263
"Rosebud."
That's all he said? Tough guy.

150
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,724
Yes, "Rosebud." Just that one word.

151
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,684
- But who is she?
- What was it?

152
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,895
Here's a man
who could've been president...

153
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,272
...who was as loved, hated
and talked about...

154
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,900
...as any man in our time,
but when he dies...

155
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,235
...something is on his mind
called Rosebud.

156
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,779
- What does that mean?
- A racehorse he bet on once.

157
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,240
- That didn't come in.
- But what was the race?

158
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,450
Rosebud.

159
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:47,701
- Thompson.
- Yes.

160
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,246
- Hold this up a week, two if you must.
- Don't you think right after he's dead...

161
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:56,084
Find out about Rosebud. Get in touch with
anybody who knew him or knew him well.

162
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,961
That manager of his... Uh...

163
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,547
Bernstein. His second wife.
She's still living.

164
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:01,882
Susan Alexander Kane.

165
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,801
- She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.
- That's right.

166
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,305
See them all. Get in touch with everybody
that ever worked for him...

167
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,600
...whoever loved him,
whoever hated his guts.

168
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,436
I don't mean go through
the city directory of course.

169
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,104
I'll get on it right away.

170
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,691
Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.

171
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,444
It will probably turn out to be
a very simple thing.

172
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,527
Miss Alexander.

173
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,989
This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.

174
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,449
I want another drink, John.

175
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,247
Right away.
Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?

176
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,917
- I'll have a highball, please.
- Who told you you could sit down?

177
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,671
I thought maybe we could have a talk.

178
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,256
Think again.

179
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,634
Can't you people leave me alone?

180
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,928
I'm minding my own business,
you mind yours.

181
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,806
If I could just have a talk with you,
Miss Alexander. I'd...

182
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,683
Get out of here.

183
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,811
Get out!

184
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,689
- Sorry.
- Get out.

185
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,442
- Maybe some other time.
- Get out.

186
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,579
Gino.

187
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,207
Get her another highball.

188
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,002
She just won't talk to nobody,
Mr. Thompson.

189
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,420
Okay.

190
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,884
- Another double?
- Yeah.

191
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,886
Hello, I want New York City.

192
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:16,642
Courtland 79970.
This is Atlantic City 46827. All right.

193
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,310
Hey.

194
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,562
- She's, uh...
- Yeah.

195
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,356
She'll snap out of it.

196
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,734
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon
talk about Mr. Kane as any...

197
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,235
- Hello.
- Sooner.

198
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,030
This is Thompson.
Let me talk to the chief.

199
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,825
Mr. Rawlston? She won't talk.

200
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,870
The second Mrs. Kane.
About Rosebud or anything else.

201
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,705
I'm calling from Atlantic City.

202
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:42,417
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia,
to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.

203
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,835
They're expecting me.

204
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,464
Then I've a meeting with his general
manager in New York. Bernstein.

205
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,007
Then I'm coming back here.

206
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,803
Yeah, I'll see everybody
that's still alive. Goodbye.

207
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,013
- Hey... Um...
- John.

208
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,932
You just might be able to help me.

209
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,103
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane,
did she ever mention Rosebud?

210
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,771
"Rosebud"?

211
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,524
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.

212
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:10,445
As a matter of fact, just the other day,
when the papers were full of it...

213
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,156
...I asked her.

214
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,826
She never heard of Rosebud.

215
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,967
The directors of the Thatcher
Memorial Library have asked me...

216
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,345
...to remind you about the conditions
under which you may...

217
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,598
...inspect certain portions
of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.

218
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,309
- I remember them.
- Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.

219
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,937
- All I want is an hour...
- Under no circumstances...

220
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,774
...are direct quotes from his manuscript
to be used by you. You may follow me.

221
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,110
That's all right. I'm just looking for...

222
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,499
Jennings.

223
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,505
Thank you, Jennings.

224
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:15,051
You will be required to leave this room
at 4:30 promptly.

225
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,679
You will confine yourself,
it is our understanding...

226
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,224
...to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's
manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.

227
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,268
That's all I'm interested in.

228
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,562
Thank you.

229
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:30,692
Pages 83 to 142.

230
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,023
Come on, boys.

231
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,442
- Be careful, Charles.
- Mrs. Kane.

232
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,736
Pull your muffler around your neck,
Charles.

233
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,072
Mrs. Kane,
I think we'll have to tell him now.

234
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,201
Yes, I'll sign those papers now,
Mr. Thatcher.

235
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,079
You people seem to forget
that I'm the boy's father.

236
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,082
It's going to be done exactly the way
I've told Mr. Thatcher.

237
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,919
There's nothing wrong with Colorado.
I don't see why we can't raise our son...

238
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,754
...just because we came into money.

239
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,799
If I want to, I can go to court.
A father has a right to.

240
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:39,177
A boarder that beats his bill
and leaves worthless stock behind...

241
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,180
That property is as much my property
as anybody's...

242
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,183
...now that it's valuable.
And if Fred Graves had any idea...

243
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,854
...this would happen, he'd have made out
the certificates in both our names.

244
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,399
- But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.
- He owed the money to both of us.

245
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:57,279
- "The bank's decision in all matters..."
- I don't hold with giving Charles to a bank...

246
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,614
- Stop this nonsense.
- We're a bit uneducated...

247
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,033
"The bank's decision
concerning his education...

248
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,411
...his places of residence,
is to be final."

249
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:08,039
- The idea of a bank being the guardian...
- Stop this nonsense, Jim.

250
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,001
"We will assume full management
of the Colorado Lode"...

251
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,753
...which I repeat, Mrs. Kane,
you are the sole owner.

252
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,964
- Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
- Right here.

253
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,175
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.

254
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,761
You'd think I hadn't been
a good husband or father...

255
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,388
The sum of $50,000 a year...

256
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,641
...is to be paid to you
and Mr. Kane as long as you both live...

257
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,935
...and thereafter to the survivor.

258
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,689
- Let's hope it's all for the best.
- It is.

259
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,066
The union forever!

260
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,697
Why I can't raise my own boy
is more than I can understand.

261
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,782
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

262
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,994
Everything else, the principal,
as well as all monies earned...

263
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:50,165
...is to be administered by the bank in
trust for your son, Charles Foster Kane...

264
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,876
...until he reaches his 25th birthday,
at which time...

265
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,337
...he is to come
into complete possession.

266
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,088
Charles!

267
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,425
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

268
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:05,847
Well, it's almost 5.
Don't you think I'd better meet the boy?

269
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,974
I've got his trunk all packed.

270
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,686
I've had it packed for a week now.

271
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,399
I've arranged for a tutor
to meet us in Chicago.

272
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,735
I'd have brought him
here with me, but...

273
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,196
- Charles.
- Lookie, Mom.

274
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,739
You'd better come inside.

275
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,784
- That's quite a snowman.
- I took the pipe out of his mouth.

276
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,369
Did you make it yourself?

277
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,080
Maybe I'll make some
teeth and whiskers.

278
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,415
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

279
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,876
- Hello.
- How do you do, Charles?

280
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,503
He comes from the East.

281
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,046
- Pa.
- Hello, Charlie.

282
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,422
Charles.

283
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,549
Yes, Mommy?

284
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,137
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you
on a trip with him tonight.

285
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,931
You'll be leaving on number 10.

286
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,100
That's the train with all the lights on it.

287
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,309
You going, Mom?

288
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,688
No. Your mother won't be going
right away, but she'll...

289
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,773
Where am I going?

290
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,902
You're going to see Chicago and New York
and Washington, maybe. Ain't he?

291
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,153
He certainly is.

292
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,615
I wish I were a boy going on a trip
like that for the first time.

293
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,952
- Why aren't you coming with us, Mom?
- We have to stay here, Charles.

294
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,913
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher
from now on, Charlie.

295
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,500
You're gonna be rich.
Your ma figures, well, that is...

296
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,837
...me and her decided this ain't the place
for you to grow up in.

297
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,297
You'll probably be
the richest man someday...

298
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,883
...and you ought to get...
You won't be lonely.

299
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,429
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have
fine times together, we are.

300
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,432
Let's shake hands. Come.
I'm not that frightening, am I?

301
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:33,018
- What do you say? Let's shake.
- Why, Charles.

302
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,894
- Why, you almost hurt me.
- Charlie!

303
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,439
Sleds aren't to hit people,
but to sleigh with.

304
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,606
Mom!

305
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,317
You got to go. Jim!

306
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,946
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.

307
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,906
- That's what you think, is it?
- Yes.

308
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:51,327
That's why he's going to be brought up
where you can't get at him.

309
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,391
Well, Charles...

310
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,229
...Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

311
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,565
And a happy New Year.

312
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,941
In closing...

313
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,820
...may I remind you your 25th birthday,
which is now approaching...

314
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,656
...marks your complete independence
from the firm...

315
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,285
...of Thatcher & Company, as well as
acquiring the full responsibility...

316
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,788
...for the world's sixth largest
private fortune.

317
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,999
- Got that?
- "The world's sixth largest private fortune."

318
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:42,003
I don't think you realize the full importance
of the position you are to occupy.

319
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,506
I am therefore enclosing
for your consideration...

320
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,258
...a list of your holdings,
extensively cross-indexed.

321
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,552
"Dear Mr. Thatcher."
It's from Mr. Kane.

322
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,138
- Go on.
- "Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...

323
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,224
...oil wells, shipping or real estate."

324
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,518
Not interested?

325
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,021
The New York Inquirer.

326
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,024
A little newspaper we acquired
in a foreclosure proceeding.

327
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,485
Don't sell it.
I am coming back to take charge.

328
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,029
"I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."

329
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:12,242
I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper.

330
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,210
"Traction Trust exposed."

331
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,921
"Traction Trust bleeds public white."

332
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:28,341
"Traction Trust smashed by Inquirer."

333
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,928
"Landlords refuse to clear slums."

334
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:36,599
"Inquirerwins slum fight." Oh...

335
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,187
"Wall Street backs copper swindle."

336
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,398
"Copper robbers indicted."

337
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:46,401
"Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast."

338
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:49,070
Is that really your idea
of how to run a newspaper?

339
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,574
I don't know how to run a newspaper.
I try everything I can think of.

340
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,577
You know there's not
the slightest proof this...

341
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,580
...armada's off the Jersey Coast.
Hello, Mr. Bernstein.

342
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,123
Can you prove it isn't?

343
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,001
Mr. Bernstein,
I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.

344
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,878
- Mr. Leland.
- Hello.

345
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,629
Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.

346
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:11,926
We have no secrets from our readers.
Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.

347
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:15,847
He knows what's wrong with every copy
of the Inquirer since I took over. Read.

348
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,975
"Girls delightful in Cuba. Stop.
Could send you prose poems..."

349
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,854
...about scenery but don't feel right
spending your money. Stop.

350
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,773
There is no war in Cuba."
Signed "Wheeler." Any answer?

351
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:30,403
You provide
the prose poems, I'll provide the war.

352
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,198
- That's fine.
- I like it myself. Send it right away.

353
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,617
I came to see you
about this campaign of yours.

354
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,578
The Inquirer's campaign against
the Public Transit Company.

355
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,872
Do you know anything
we can use against them?

356
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,540
Still the college boy, eh?

357
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:46,711
I was expelled from college, a lot
of colleges, you remember? I remember.

358
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,215
Charles, I think I should remind you
of a fact you have forgotten.

359
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,135
You're one of the largest stockholders
in the Public Transit Company.

360
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,305
The trouble is, you don't realize
you're talking to two people.

361
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,516
As Charles Foster Kane
who owns 82,364 shares...

362
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,395
...of Public Transit Preferred. See,
I do have a general idea of my holdings.

363
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,023
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel...

364
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,360
...his paper should be closed,
a committee formed to boycott him.

365
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:14,239
If you can form such a committee,
put me down for a contribution of $1000.

366
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,158
On the other hand,
I am the publisher of the Inquirer.

367
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:21,412
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in on a
little secret. It is also my pleasure...

368
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,708
...to see that the working people of this
community aren't robbed by a pack...

369
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,419
...of money-mad pirates, just because...

370
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,006
...they have no one
to look after their interests.

371
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,343
I'll let you in on another little secret,
Mr. Thatcher:

372
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:39,305
I think I'm the man to do it.
You see, I have money and property.

373
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:43,351
If I don't look after the interests
of the underprivileged, somebody else will.

374
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,520
Maybe somebody
without money or property.

375
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:46,896
That would be too bad.

376
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,107
I saw your financial statement today.

377
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,193
- Oh, did you?
- Tell me, honestly...

378
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:56,614
...don't you think it's rather unwise to
continue this philanthropic enterprise...

379
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,742
...this Inquirer, that is costing you
$1 million a year?

380
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,664
Yes. I did lose $1 million last year.
I expect to lose $1 million this year.

381
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,417
I expect to lose $1 million next year.

382
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,044
At the rate of $1 million a year...

383
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:14,007
...I'll have to close
this place in 60 years.

384
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,560
"With respect to the said newspapers..."

385
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:28,146
...the said Charles Foster Kane...

386
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,858
...hereby relinquishes
all control thereof...

387
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,986
...and of the syndicates
pertaining thereto...

388
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:41,200
...and any and all other newspaper, press
and publishing properties of any kind...

389
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,953
"...and agrees to abandon
all claim thereto..."

390
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:47,415
- Which means we're bust all right.
- Well, out of cash.

391
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,042
All right, Mr. Bernstein.

392
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:53,629
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher,
just let me sign it and go home.

393
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,091
You're too old
to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

394
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:00,219
You're too old to be called
anything else.

395
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,555
You were always too old.

396
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:06,809
"In consideration thereof,
Thatcher & Company agrees...

397
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,729
...to pay to Charles Foster Kane,
as long as he lives..."

398
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,439
My allowance.

399
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:15,401
"You will continue to maintain
over your newspapers a large...

400
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:20,281
...measure of control.
Measure of control."

401
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,993
And we shall seek your advice.

402
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,458
This depression is temporary.

403
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:35,463
There's always the chance
that you'll die richer than I will.

404
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,091
It's a cinch I'll die
richer than I was born.

405
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,635
We never lost as much as we made.

406
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:45,223
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles...

407
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:50,603
...you never made a single investment.
You always used money to...

408
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:55,191
To buy things. Hmm?

409
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,820
To buy things.

410
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,741
My mother should have chosen
a less reliable banker.

411
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,335
I always gagged on that silver spoon.

412
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,339
You know, Mr. Bernstein...

413
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,718
...if I hadn't been very rich...

414
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,555
...I might have been a really great man.

415
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,890
Don't you think you are?

416
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,104
I think I did pretty well
under the circumstances.

417
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,358
What would you like to have been?

418
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,488
Everything you hate.

419
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:54,083
- Oh...
- I beg your pardon, sir? What did you say?

420
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:58,004
- It's 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings?
- Yes, ma'am.

421
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:00,673
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege,
young man.

422
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,843
- Did you find what you were looking for?
- No.

423
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,264
- You're not Rosebud, are you?
- What?

424
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,392
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings,
isn't it?

425
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,980
Goodbye, everybody.
Thanks for the use of the hall.

426
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:20,234
Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.

427
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,737
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know?

428
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:27,033
We thought maybe... If we could
find out what he meant by his last words...

429
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,619
...as he was dying.
That "Rosebud"?

430
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,205
Maybe some girl?

431
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,499
There were a lot of them
in the early days.

432
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,793
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane
could have met someone casually...

433
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,129
...and then 50 years later,
on his deathbed...

434
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:45,092
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.

435
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,846
A fellow will remember a lot of things
you wouldn't think he'd remember.

436
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,640
You take me.

437
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:55,853
One day, back in 1896, I was crossing
over to Jersey on the ferry...

438
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:59,190
...and as we pulled out,
there was another ferry pulling in...

439
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,109
...and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off.

440
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,654
A white dress she had on.

441
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,281
She was carrying a white parasol.

442
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,034
I only saw her for one second.

443
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:15,623
She didn't see me at all, but I'll
bet a month hasn't gone by since...

444
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,085
...that I haven't thought of that girl.

445
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:23,714
- Who else have you been to see?
- Well, I went down to Atlantic City.

446
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,758
Susie?

447
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,260
Thank you.

448
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,680
I called her myself the day after he died.

449
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,432
I thought maybe somebody ought to.

450
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,980
- She couldn't even come to the phone.
- I'll be seeing her again in a couple of days.

451
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,107
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.

452
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,902
If you'd talk about anything connected
with Mr. Kane that you can remember.

453
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,904
You were with him from the beginning.

454
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:52,451
From before the beginning, young fellow.
And now it's after the end.

455
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,788
Have you tried to see anybody
except Susie?

456
00:31:55,956 --> 00:32:00,167
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've
been through Walter Thatcher's journal.

457
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,755
- That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
- He made an awful lot of money.

458
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,675
Well, it's no trick
to make a lot of money...

459
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,386
...if all you want...

460
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,098
...is to make a lot of money.

461
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:18,060
You take Mr. Kane.

462
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,814
It wasn't money he wanted.

463
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:27,778
Thatcher never did figure him out.
Sometimes even I couldn't.

464
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,365
You know who you ought to see?
Mr. Leland.

465
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,535
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend.
They went to school together.

466
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:35,828
Harvard?

467
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:39,540
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Cornell, Switzerland.

468
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,335
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.

469
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:45,212
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.

470
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,466
One of those families
where the father is worth $10 million...

471
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:52,887
...then one day he shoots himself,
and it turns out there's nothing but debts.

472
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,807
He was with Mr. Kane and me...

473
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,728
...the first day Mr. Kane took over
the Inquirer.

474
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,905
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.

475
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:15,034
It's going to look a lot different
one of these days. Come on.

476
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:27,046
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint.
That's a newspaper building.

477
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:30,591
You're getting paid, mister,
for opinions or for hauling?

478
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,801
Ugh.

479
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,682
- Jedediah.
- After you, Mr. Kane.

480
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,113
Excuse me, sir, but I...

481
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:58,869
Welcome, Mr. Kane. Welcome.

482
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,206
Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.

483
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,583
I am Herbert Carter, the editor-in-chief.

484
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:08,546
- Thank you, Mr. Carter. This is Mr. Leland...
- How do you do, Mr. Leland?

485
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,549
Our new dramatic critic.
I hope I haven't made a mistake.

486
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,843
- It is dramatic critic, right?
- That's right.

487
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,596
- Are they standing for me?
- You? Oh, Mr. Kane.

488
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:18,889
Standing?

489
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,599
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

490
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,018
I thought it would be a
nice little gesture.

491
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,313
- Ask them to sit down, will you, please.
- The new publisher.

492
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:30,651
- You may resume your duties, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

493
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:34,155
- I didn't know your plans.
- I don't know my plans myself.

494
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,741
- Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans.
- No?

495
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,284
Except to get out a newspaper.

496
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,082
- Whoops.
- Mr. Bernstein.

497
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,459
Yes, Mr. Kane.

498
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,919
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.

499
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:54,008
- Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
- How do you do, Mr. Carter?

500
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,010
- Mr. Carter.
- How do you do?

501
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,305
- Yes, Mr. Bernstine.
- Stein.

502
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:03,017
- Kane.
- Mr. Carter, is this your office?

503
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:07,271
My little private sanctum
is at your disposal.

504
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,816
- Excuse me.
- But I don't understand.

505
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:15,196
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here
in your office as long as I have to.

506
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,199
Live here? Yes?

507
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,118
- Excuse me.
- But a morning newspaper, after all...

508
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,369
Excuse me.

509
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,207
We're practically closed
for 12 hours a day.

510
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,543
That's one of the things
that's going to have to be changed here.

511
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:33,214
- The news goes on for 24 hours a day.
- Twenty-four?

512
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,675
- That's right.
- Excuse me.

513
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,427
It's impossible...

514
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:43,557
I've drawn that cartoon.
I'm no good as a cartoonist.

515
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,226
You certainly aren't.

516
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,102
You're the dramatic critic, Leland.

517
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,146
- You still eating?
- I'm still hungry.

518
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,732
Here's a front-page story
in the Chronicle...

519
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,902
...about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone
in Brooklyn who's missing.

520
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,615
She's probably murdered. Why isn't
there something about it in the Inquirer?

521
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,492
We're running a newspaper...

522
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,578
I'm absolutely starving to death.
...not a scandal sheet.

523
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,622
That's all right.

524
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,709
Mr. Carter, here is a three-column headline
in the Chronicle.

525
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,295
Why hasn't the Inquirer
a three-column headline?

526
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:14,880
- The news wasn't big enough.
- Mm-hm.

527
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:19,677
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough,
it makes the news big enough.

528
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,388
- That's right!
- The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone...

529
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,640
There's no proof
that she was murdered, or dead.

530
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,601
It says she's missing.
The neighbors are getting suspicious.

531
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,563
It's not our function
to report the gossip of housewives.

532
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,859
If we were interested in that kind of thing,
we could fill the paper twice over, daily.

533
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,279
That's the kind of thing we are going to be
interested in from now on.

534
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,365
I want you to send your best man
to see Mr. Silverstone.

535
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:45,286
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't
produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone...

536
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,454
...the Inquirerwill have him arrested.
Wha...?

537
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,040
Tell Mr. Silverstone
he's a detective from, uh...

538
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,626
- Central Office.
- The Central Office.

539
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:57,423
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious
and asks to see your man's badge...

540
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:01,385
...your man is to get indignant
and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.

541
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,805
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear.
You ready for dinner, Jedediah?

542
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:08,142
I can't see that the function
of a respectable newspaper...

543
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,437
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter.
Goodbye.

544
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,272
Goodbye.

545
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,817
Paper! Read all about it!

546
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,945
Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.

547
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,531
The mystery of the lady
that vanished in Brooklyn.

548
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:27,661
Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.

549
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,719
We'll be on the street soon,
Charlie, another 10 minutes.

550
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,513
Three hours and 50 minutes late,
but we did it.

551
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,182
- Tired?
- A tough day.

552
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,892
- A wasted day.
- Wasted?

553
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,937
You only made the paper over
four times tonight, that's all.

554
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,565
I've changed the front page a little,
Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough.

555
00:37:56,733 --> 00:38:00,945
There's something I've got to get into
this paper besides pictures and print.

556
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,573
I've got to make the New York Inquirer
as important to New York...

557
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,617
...as the gas in that light.

558
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,994
What are you going to do, Charlie?

559
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:13,290
My Declaration of Principles.
Don't smile, Jedediah.

560
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,210
I've got it all written out here.

561
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,713
You don't want to make any promises
you don't want to keep.

562
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,548
These'll be kept.

563
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,885
"I'll provide the people of this city..."

564
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,806
...with a daily paper
that will tell all the news honestly.

565
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:33,352
- I will also provide..."
- That's two sentences starting with "I."

566
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,021
People will know who's responsible...

567
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:40,150
...and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer,
quickly, simply and entertainingly.

568
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,570
No special interests will be allowed
to interfere with that truth.

569
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:47,574
"I will also provide them with a fighting
and tireless champion of their rights...

570
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,327
...as citizens and as human beings."

571
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,287
Signed:

572
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,249
"Charles Foster Kane."

573
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,837
- Can I have that, Charlie?
- I'm going to print it.

574
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,422
Solly!

575
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:03,424
Yes, Mr. Kane?

576
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,385
I want you to run this editorial
in a box on the front page.

577
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,928
This morning's front page?

578
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,098
That's right, Solly,
that means we'll have to remake again.

579
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,975
- Yes.
- Go down and tell them.

580
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,435
- All right.
- Solly.

581
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:18,439
When you're through with that,
I'd like to have it back.

582
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:23,360
I'd like to keep that particular
piece of paper myself.

583
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:27,573
I have a hunch it might turn out
to be something pretty important.

584
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,950
- A document...
- Sure.

585
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:33,537
...Like the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution...

586
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,874
...and my first report card at school.

587
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,405
I know you're tired, gentlemen,
but I brought you here for a reason.

588
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:12,159
- This little pilgrimage will do us good.
- The Chronicle's a good newspaper.

589
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,329
Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper.
Notice the circulation.

590
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:20,292
495,000.
But look who's working for the Chronicle.

591
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,629
- With them, it's no trick to get circulation.
- You're right.

592
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,049
You know how long it took
the Chronicle to get that staff together?

593
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,968
- Twenty years.
- Twenty years?

594
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:35,516
Six years ago, I looked at a picture
of the world's greatest newspaper men.

595
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,851
I felt like a kid in
front of a candy store.

596
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:41,980
Tonight, six years later,
I got my candy, all of it.

597
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,399
Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.

598
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,402
Make an extra copy of that picture
and mail it to the Chronicle.

599
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,533
It'll make you all happy to learn
that our circulation this morning...

600
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,786
684,000.

601
00:40:56,412 --> 00:41:00,040
684,132.

602
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,458
Right.

603
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,629
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness
in taking leave of you.

604
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,173
I'm going abroad next week
for a vacation.

605
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,802
I've promised my doctor for sometime
that I would leave when I could.

606
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,303
I now realize I can't.

607
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,015
Say, Mr. Kane,
as long as you're promising...

608
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:21,061
...there's a lot of pictures and statues
in Europe you ain't bought yet.

609
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,147
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.

610
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:26,191
They've been making statues
for 2000 years.

611
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,360
And I've only been buying for five.

612
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,988
- Promise me, Mr. Kane.
- I promise, Mr. Bernstein.

613
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,907
- Thank you.
- Mr. Bernstein?

614
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,743
You don't expect me to keep
any of those promises, do you?

615
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,123
And now, gentlemen!

616
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:44,501
Your complete attention, if you please.

617
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,510
Are we going to declare war on Spain?

618
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,897
- Oh, mama, here they come.
- Shoot me while I'm happy.

619
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:18,285
I said, "Are we going to declare
war on Spain, or are we not?"

620
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,287
The Inquirer already has.

621
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:24,458
You long-faced, overdressed anarchist.

622
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,418
I am not overdressed.

623
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,880
You are, too.
Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.

624
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,965
Let's have the song about Charlie.

625
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,427
- Is there a song about Charlie?
- Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?

626
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:39,890
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town,
you get a song written about you.

627
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,069
I've seen that fellow. He's good.

628
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,612
Good evening, Mr. Kane.

629
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,155
There is a man There is a man

630
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:56,698
A certain man A certain man

631
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:00,160
And for the poor you may be sure
That he'll do all he can

632
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,954
- Who is this one?
- Who is this one?

633
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,789
- This favorite son
- This favorite son

634
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:06,708
Just by his action
Has the traction magnates on the run

635
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,669
- Who loves to smoke
- Who loves to smoke

636
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,212
- Enjoys a joke
- Ha-ha-ha

637
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,382
Who wouldn't get a bit upset
If he were really broke

638
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,217
- With wealth and fame
- With wealth and fame

639
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:16,718
He's still the same

640
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:20,389
I'll bet you five you're not alive
If you don't know his name

641
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,854
What is his name?

642
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,190
It's Charlie Kane, it's Mister Kane!

643
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,152
He doesn't like that Mister
He likes good old Charlie Kane

644
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,754
- Isn't it wonderful? Such a party.
- Yes.

645
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,673
What's the matter?

646
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:58,051
Who says a miss was made to kiss

647
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:01,221
And when he meets one
Always tries to do exactly this

648
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,558
Who buys the food
Who buys the drinks

649
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:07,978
Who thinks that dough was made to spend
And acts the way he thinks

650
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,856
Now is it, Joe, no, no, no

651
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,192
Bernstein, these men
who are now with the Inquirer...

652
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,987
...who were with the Chronicle
until yesterday...

653
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,572
Oh, mama, please.

654
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,449
- Give me that.
- What? The blond?

655
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:24,077
- No, the brunette.
- Where did you learn that, Charlie?

656
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,498
Bernstein, these men
who were with the Chronicle...

657
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,668
...weren't they just as devoted
to the Chronicle policy...

658
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,004
...as they are now to our policies?

659
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,882
Sure, they're just like anybody else.

660
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,176
They got work to do, they do it.

661
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:42,429
Only they happen to be the best men
in the business.

662
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:55,108
Do we stand for the same things
the Chronicle stands for?

663
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,069
Certainly not.

664
00:44:58,071 --> 00:45:03,116
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed
to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

665
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:07,621
There's always a chance, of course,
that they'll change Mr. Kane.

666
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,164
Without his knowing it.

667
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:16,254
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane!

668
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:21,301
- Mr. Leland! I got a cable from Mr. Kane.
- What?

669
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,345
- From Paris, France.
- What?

670
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:26,473
- From Paris, France.
- Come on in.

671
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:32,312
Who by his action
Has the traction magnates on the run

672
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:37,692
It's a good thing he promised
not to send back any more statues.

673
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,944
Bernstein, Bernstein.

674
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:41,780
Look, he wants to buy
the world's biggest diamond.

675
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:45,409
Why didn't you go to Europe with him?
He wanted you to.

676
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,078
I wanted Charlie to have fun,
with me along...

677
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,372
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?

678
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:55,419
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?
Am I a New England schoolmarm?

679
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,504
Yes.

680
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:03,260
If you thought I'd answer you different
from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.

681
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:04,761
"World's biggest diamond."

682
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,013
I didn't know Charlie
was collecting diamonds.

683
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,348
He ain't.

684
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:12,144
He's collecting somebody
that's collecting diamonds.

685
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,689
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.

686
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,818
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane...

687
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:23,655
...from 467 employees
of the New York Inquirer."

688
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,323
Here he comes!

689
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,163
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

690
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,707
- I know I've a mustache.
- It looks awful.

691
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:37,377
Have we got a society editor?

692
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:40,380
- Right here, Mr. Kane.
- Miss Townsend is the society editor.

693
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:43,216
Miss Townsend,
this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane.

694
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:48,555
Uh... Miss Townsend, I've been away
so long. I don't know your routine.

695
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:52,726
I got a little social announcement.

696
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:56,897
I wish you wouldn't treat it
any differently than you would any other...

697
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,732
...social announcement.

698
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,360
Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees
of the Inquirer...

699
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,031
Mr. Bernstein,
thank you very much, everybody, I...

700
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:11,036
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.

701
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:12,662
Goodbye.

702
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,540
Say, he was in an awful hurry.

703
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,585
Hey, everybody, look out here.

704
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:20,712
Let's go to the window.

705
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:23,757
- Mr. Leland! Mr. Bernstein!
- Yes, Ms. Townsend?

706
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:26,718
"Mr. And Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton..."

707
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:30,347
...announce the engagement
of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...

708
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,182
...to Mr. Charles Foster Kane."
Huh?

709
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,850
Come on.

710
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:41,066
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece
of the President of the United States.

711
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,318
President's niece?

712
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:46,071
Before he's through,
she'll be a president's wife.

713
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:58,291
The way things turned out,
I don't need to tell you.

714
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:01,211
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.

715
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,630
It didn't end very well, did it?

716
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,423
It ended.

717
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:10,011
Then there was Susie. That ended too.

718
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,975
You know, Mr. Thompson,
I was thinking...

719
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,436
...this Rosebud
you're trying to find out about...

720
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:20,981
Yes?

721
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,821
Maybe that was something he lost.

722
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:31,992
Mr. Kane was a man who lost
almost everything he had.

723
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,869
You ought to see Jed Leland.

724
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:38,164
Of course, he and Mr. Kane
didn't exactly see eye to eye.

725
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,208
You take the Spanish-American war.

726
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:43,670
I guess Mr. Leland was right.
That was Mr. Kane's war.

727
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,798
We didn't really have anything
to fight about.

728
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,177
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war
of Mr. Kane's...

729
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,222
...we'd have the Panama Canal?

730
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,350
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.

731
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:01,146
A lot of the time now
they don't tell me these things.

732
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,232
Maybe even he's dead.

733
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,026
In case you'd like to know...

734
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,070
...he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital
on 180th Street.

735
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:10,655
You don't say. I had...

736
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,617
Nothing particular the matter with him,
they tell me, just...

737
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,369
Just old age.

738
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:22,542
It's the only disease that you don't
look forward to being cured of.

739
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,474
I can remember absolutely everything,
young man.

740
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:38,850
That's my curse.

741
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:43,563
That's one of the greatest curses
Memory.

742
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:49,361
I was his oldest friend, and as far as
I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.

743
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:53,698
Not that Charlie was ever brutal.
He just did brutal things.

744
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,745
Maybe I wasn't his friend,
but if I wasn't, he never had one.

745
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:02,540
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

746
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,959
You were about to say
something about Rosebud.

747
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,253
Do you happen to have a good cigar?

748
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:11,216
I've got a young physician here
who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.

749
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,802
- No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sorry.
- Oh, oh. Ha, ha.

750
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,595
I changed the subject, didn't I?

751
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,889
What a disagreeable old man
I have become.

752
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:24,437
You're a reporter and you want to know
what I think about Charlie Kane.

753
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,273
Well... Heh.

754
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,901
I suppose he had some private sort
of greatness.

755
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,695
But he kept it to himself.

756
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,739
He never gave himself away.
He never gave anything away.

757
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:37,867
He just left you a tip.

758
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,662
Hmm? Heh. He had a generous mind.

759
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,998
I don't suppose anybody
ever had so many opinions.

760
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,960
But he never believed in anything
except Charlie Kane.

761
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:50,714
He never had a conviction
except Charlie Kane in his life.

762
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,174
I suppose he died without one.

763
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,969
That must have been pretty unpleasant.

764
00:50:56,303 --> 00:51:00,890
Of course, a lot of us check out without
having any special convictions about death.

765
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,310
But we do know what we're leaving.
We do believe in something.

766
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,981
Are you absolutely sure
you haven't got a cigar?

767
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:10,108
- Sorry, Mr. Leland.
- Never mind.

768
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,653
- What do you know about Rosebud?
- "Rosebud"?

769
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:18,074
"Rosebud."

770
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,493
I saw that in the Inquirer.

771
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,456
I never believed anything
I saw in the Inquirer.

772
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,957
Anything else?

773
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:29,794
I can tell you about Emily.
I went to dancing school with Emily.

774
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,963
I was very graceful.

775
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,217
- We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane.
- What was she like?

776
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,845
She was like all the girls I knew
in dancing school.

777
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,723
Very nice girl. Emily was a little nicer.

778
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,477
After the first couple of months...

779
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:49,898
...she and Charlie didn't see much
of each other except at breakfast.

780
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:53,234
It was a marriage
just like any other marriage.

781
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,079
- You're beautiful.
- I can't be.

782
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,915
Yes, you are. You're very beautiful.

783
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,626
I've never been to six parties
in one night before.

784
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:12,545
- I've never been up this late.
- It's a matter of habit.

785
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,590
- What will the servants think?
- That we enjoyed ourselves.

786
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:18,218
Why do you have to go straight off
to the newspaper?

787
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:22,055
You never should've married a
newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.

788
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,891
I absolutely adore you.

789
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,645
Charles, even newspapermen
have to sleep.

790
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,942
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him
put off my appointments till noon.

791
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,402
What time is it?

792
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,530
I don't know. It's late.

793
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,575
It's early.

794
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,410
Charles...

795
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,914
Do you know how long
you kept me waiting last night...

796
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,875
...when you went to the newspaper
for 10 minutes?

797
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:54,254
What do you do in a newspaper
in the middle of the night?

798
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:59,384
My dear, your only correspondent
is the Inquirer.

799
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:02,262
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival
of flesh and blood.

800
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,889
I don't spend that much time
on the newspaper.

801
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:09,060
It isn't just the time.
It's what you print, attacking the president.

802
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:12,355
- You mean Uncle John.
- I mean the president of the United States.

803
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,899
He's still Uncle John
and a well-meaning fathead...

804
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:18,361
...who's letting a pack of high-pressure
crooks run his administration.

805
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:22,240
- This whole oil scandal...
- He happens to be the president, not you.

806
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:25,118
That's a mistake that will be corrected
one of these days.

807
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:31,207
Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior
the most incredible atrocity yesterday.

808
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:34,210
I simply can't have it in the nursery.

809
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:39,257
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit
to the nursery now and then.

810
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:40,925
Does he have to?

811
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:43,344
Yes.

812
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:48,308
- Really, Charles, people will think...
- What I tell them to think.

813
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,786
Wasn't he ever in love with her?

814
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,705
He married for love.

815
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:12,999
Love.

816
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,335
That is why he did everything.

817
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,338
That's why he went into politics.
It seems we weren't enough.

818
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,549
He wanted all the voters to love him too.

819
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,219
All he wanted out of life was love.

820
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:28,806
That's Charlie's story. How he lost it.

821
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:32,685
You see, he just didn't have any to give.

822
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,396
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.

823
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,024
Very dearly.

824
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:40,902
And his mother,
I guess he always loved her.

825
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,113
- How about his second wife?
- Susan Alexander?

826
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,033
You know what Charlie called her?

827
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,036
The day after he'd met her,
he told me about her.

828
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:54,958
He said she was
"a cross-section of the American public."

829
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:00,922
I guess he couldn't help it.
She must have had something for him.

830
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,883
That first night, according to Charlie...

831
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,595
...all she had was a toothache.

832
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,878
What are you laughing at, young lady?

833
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,588
Ooh.

834
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,425
- What's the matter with you?
- Toothache.

835
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,260
- What?
- Toothache.

836
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:48,761
Toothache?

837
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:52,015
Oh. Oh.

838
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,474
You mean you've got a toothache.

839
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,937
- What's funny about that?
- You're funny, mister.

840
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,606
- You've got dirt on your face.
- Not dirt, it's mud.

841
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,984
Do you want some hot water?
I live right here.

842
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:05,111
What's that, young lady?

843
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,781
I said, if you wanted some hot water...

844
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,117
...I could get you some...

845
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,745
...hot water.

846
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,167
All right, thank you very much.

847
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,433
Do I look any better now?

848
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:40,313
- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
- What you need is to get your mind off it.

849
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,023
Hey.

850
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:48,613
Excuse me, but my landlady
prefers me to keep this door open...

851
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,282
...when I have a gentleman caller.
All right.

852
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,951
- Oh.
- You have got a toothache, haven't you?

853
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:57,080
- I surely have.
- Why don't you try laughing at me again?

854
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,123
- What?
- I'm still pretty funny.

855
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,793
I know, but you don't want me
to laugh at you.

856
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,920
- I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.
- Ooh.

857
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:05,338
Look at me.

858
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:07,924
- See that?
- What are you doing?

859
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:10,885
I'm wiggling both my ears
at the same time.

860
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,263
That's it, smile.

861
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:21,312
It took me two solid years at the best
boys' school in the world to learn that.

862
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,315
The fellow who taught me
is now president of Venezuela.

863
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:27,735
That's it!

864
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:34,450
- Is it a giraffe?
- No, not a giraffe.

865
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:37,328
- I bet it is.
- What?

866
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:39,580
Well, then it's an elephant.

867
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:43,709
- It's supposed to be a rooster.
- A rooster!

868
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:47,755
You know an awful lot of tricks.
Are you a professional magician?

869
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:50,424
- No, I'm not a magician.
- I was just joking.

870
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,176
You really don't know who I am?

871
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:55,346
You told me your name, Mr. Kane,
but I'm awfully ignorant.

872
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:59,976
I guess you caught on to that.
I bet I've heard your name a million times.

873
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:03,187
You really like me though,
even though you don't know who I am?

874
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:06,774
I surely do. You've been wonderful.

875
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,528
Without you I don't know
what I would have done.

876
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:13,990
I had a toothache,
and I don't know many people.

877
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:16,200
I know too many people.

878
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,661
I guess we're both lonely.

879
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:22,874
Want to know what I was going to do
before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?

880
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,210
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.
You probably have more.

881
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,545
I was just joking.

882
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:33,134
I was on my way
to the Western Manhattan Warehouse...

883
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:35,303
...in search of my youth.

884
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:40,933
You see, my mother died a long time ago.
Her things were put in storage out West.

885
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,477
There wasn't any other place
to put them.

886
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:47,607
I thought I'd send for them now.
Tonight I was going to take a look at them.

887
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,525
A sort of sentimental journey.

888
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,698
I run a couple of newspapers.
What do you do?

889
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,200
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

890
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,452
- How old did you say you were?
- I didn't say.

891
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,205
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.

892
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,539
- How old?
- Pretty old.

893
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,708
- How old?
- Twenty-two in August.

894
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,793
That's a ripe old age. What do you do?

895
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,422
I work at Seligman's.
I'm in charge of the sheet music.

896
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:16,802
- Is that what you want to do?
- No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.

897
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,556
- That is, I didn't. My mother did for me.
- What happened to the singing?

898
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:24,644
Mother always thought... She always talked
about grand opera for me.

899
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,020
Imagine.

900
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:30,524
But my voice isn't that kind.
It's just, you know what mothers are like.

901
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,527
Yes, I know.

902
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,782
- Have you got a piano?
- A piano?

903
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:40,952
- Mm-hm.
- Yes, there's one in the parlor.

904
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,205
- Would you sing for me?
- You wouldn't want to hear me sing.

905
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:45,748
Yes, I would.

906
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:49,710
Don't tell me
your toothache is bothering you.

907
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,587
No, that's all gone.

908
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,299
All right.

909
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,969
Let's go to the parlor.

910
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:05,142
Yes, Lindor shall be mine

911
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:09,438
I have sworn it

912
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:14,568
For weal or woe

913
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:21,742
Yes, Lindor

914
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:43,222
There is only one man
who can rid the politics...

915
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:46,559
...of this state of the evil domination
of Boss Jim Gettys.

916
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:50,563
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane,
the fighting liberal...

917
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:54,191
...the friend of the workingman,
the next governor of this state...

918
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,569
...who entered upon this campaign...

919
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:03,075
To point out
and make public the dishonesty...

920
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:08,080
...the downright villainy
of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine...

921
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:12,752
...now in complete control
of the government of this state.

922
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,922
I made no campaign promises...

923
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:22,219
...because, until a few weeks ago,
I had no hope of being elected.

924
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:27,308
Now, however, I have something more
than a hope.

925
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:33,856
Jim Gettys has something less
than a chance.

926
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,945
Every straw vote...

927
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:44,950
...every independent poll shows
that I will be elected.

928
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,119
Very well.

929
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,955
Now I can afford to make some promises.

930
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:03,928
The workingman and the slum child...

931
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:07,640
...know they can expect
my best efforts in their interests.

932
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:12,311
The decent, ordinary citizens know
that I'll do everything in my power...

933
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:17,650
...to protect the underprivileged,
the underpaid, and the underfed.

934
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:25,950
- Mother, is Pop governor yet?
- Not yet, Junior.

935
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:33,165
I'd make my promises now...

936
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,961
...if I weren't too busy
arranging to keep them.

937
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:44,510
But here's one promise I'll make...

938
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:48,097
...and Boss Jim Gettys knows I'll keep it.

939
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:51,809
My first official act
as governor of this state...

940
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:57,064
...will be to appoint a special district
attorney to arrange for the indictment...

941
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:02,611
...prosecution and conviction
of Boss Jim W. Gettys.

942
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,391
If the election were held today,
you'd be in by 100,000 votes.

943
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,268
- Gettys isn't even pretending.
- Pop.

944
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,562
- Hello, son.
- He isn't just scared, he's sick.

945
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,440
It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys
I mean what I say.

946
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:42,902
- Did you like your old man's speech?
- I could hear every word.

947
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,862
- Hello, Emily.
- Hold it.

948
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,448
- Great speech, Mr. Kane.
- Wonderful.

949
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:51,327
- Will you get us a taxi?
- A taxi? Why? I thought...

950
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:54,830
I'm sending Junior home
in the car with Oliver.

951
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,499
Good night, Father.

952
01:03:57,918 --> 01:03:59,418
Goodbye, son.

953
01:04:05,217 --> 01:04:06,634
Emily...

954
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:13,724
Why did you send Junior home in the car?
What are you doing in a taxi?

955
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,851
There's a call I want you to make
with me.

956
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,937
- It can wait.
- No, it can't.

957
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,273
- What's this all about, Emily?
- It may not be about anything at all.

958
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,983
I intend to find out.

959
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:27,446
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to "185 West 74th Street."

960
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,200
If you wish, you may come with me.

961
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,623
I'll come with you.

962
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:46,298
I had no idea you had this flair
for melodrama, Emily.

963
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,843
Come right in, Mr. Kane.

964
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,814
Charlie.

965
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:11,532
He forced me to send your wife that letter.
I didn't want to.

966
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:14,493
He's been saying the most terrible...

967
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:20,207
Mrs. Kane.

968
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:24,712
I don't suppose
anybody would introduce us.

969
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,756
I'm Jim Gettys.

970
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,508
Yes?

971
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:36,432
I made Miss Alexander send you the note,
Mrs. Kane.

972
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,684
She didn't want to at first.
But she did it.

973
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,185
Charlie, the things he said to me.

974
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,646
- He threatened to...
- Gettys.

975
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:46,650
I won't wait until I'm elected.
To start with, I think I'll break your neck.

976
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,445
Maybe you can do it,
and maybe you can't.

977
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:54,742
Charles, your breaking this man's neck
would scarcely explain this note:

978
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:59,496
"Serious consequences for Mr. Kane,
for yourself and for your son."

979
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:02,583
- He wanted to get her to come here...
- What does this note mean?

980
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:05,252
I'm Susan Alexander.
I know what you think...

981
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,172
- What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander?
- She don't know.

982
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:11,050
She sent it because I told her
it wouldn't be smart not to.

983
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:14,511
- Emily, this gentleman...
- I'm not a gentleman.

984
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:17,556
Your husband is only trying to be funny
calling me one.

985
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:20,267
I don't even know what a gentleman is.

986
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,563
You see, my idea of a gentleman... Heh.

987
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:31,111
If I owned a paper and didn't like
the way somebody was doing things...

988
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:33,614
...some politician,
I'd fight him with all I had.

989
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:35,532
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit...

990
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,951
...so his children could see
his picture in the paper.

991
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:42,039
- You're a cheap, crooked grafter...
- We're talking now about what you are.

992
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:45,751
I'm fighting for my life,
not just my political life.

993
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:48,003
- He said unless you...
- That's what I said.

994
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:52,091
Here's the chance I'm willing to give him.
It's more of a chance than he'd give me.

995
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:56,929
Unless he decides by tomorrow that he's
so sick he has to go away for a year...

996
01:06:57,097 --> 01:07:01,266
...Monday morning, all papers in the state,
except his, will carry the story I'll give.

997
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,810
What story?

998
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:06,730
- The story about him and Ms. Alexander.
- There isn't any story!

999
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:08,107
Shut up.

1000
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,193
We've got evidence that would look bad
in the headlines.

1001
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,987
Do you want me
to give you the evidence?

1002
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:18,867
I'd rather he withdrew
without having the story published.

1003
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:22,079
Not that I care about him,
but I'd be better off that way.

1004
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,126
So would you, Mrs. Kane.

1005
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:29,586
What about me?

1006
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:35,342
He said my name would be dragged
through the mud. That everywhere I went...

1007
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:38,721
There seems to be only one decision
you can make, Charles.

1008
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,140
I'd say that it'd been made for you.

1009
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,893
You can't tell me the voters
of this state...

1010
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:47,855
I'm not interested in the voters
of this state right now.

1011
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,398
I am interested in our son.

1012
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:52,693
- Charlie, if they publish this story...
- They won't.

1013
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:56,155
Good night, Mr. Gettys.

1014
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,166
Are you coming, Charles?

1015
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:10,711
No.

1016
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,758
I'm staying here.

1017
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:21,013
I can fight this all alone.

1018
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,683
If you don't listen to reason,
it may be too late.

1019
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,518
Too late?

1020
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:29,813
For what?

1021
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:34,151
For you and this public thief...

1022
01:08:34,486 --> 01:08:36,737
...to take the love of the people
away from me?

1023
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:39,615
You got other things to think about.
Your little boy.

1024
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:42,201
You don't want him to read about you
in the papers.

1025
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:46,872
There's only one person in the world
to decide what I'll do. And that's me.

1026
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:53,712
You decided what you were going to do,
Charles, some time ago.

1027
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:03,096
You're making a bigger fool of yourself
than I thought.

1028
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,557
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- You're licked...

1029
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:09,061
Get out. If you want to see me,
have the warden write me a letter.

1030
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:13,982
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going
to happen to you would be a lesson to you.

1031
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:16,944
Only you're going to need
more than one lesson.

1032
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:21,824
- And you'll get more than one lesson.
- Don't worry about me, Gettys.

1033
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,577
Don't worry about me!

1034
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:29,081
I'm Charles Foster Kane!

1035
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:33,836
I'm no cheap, crooked politician
trying to save himself...

1036
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:37,005
...from the consequences of his crimes!

1037
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:42,094
Gettys! I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.

1038
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:46,306
Sing Sing, Gettys. Sing Sing!

1039
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,686
- Have you a car, Mrs. Kane?
- Yes, thank you.

1040
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:53,981
- Good night.
- Good night.

1041
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:08,787
Paper. Read all about it. Extra, extra.

1042
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:15,377
- Paper?
- No, thanks.

1043
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:33,103
With a million majority
already against him...

1044
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:36,690
...and the church counties
still to be heard from...

1045
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,276
...I'm afraid we got no choice.

1046
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:40,819
This one?

1047
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:46,033
That one.

1048
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:11,183
Good night again.

1049
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:26,406
- Is there anything I can...?
- No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.

1050
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:29,785
You better go home and get some sleep.

1051
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,371
You too.

1052
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:34,581
Uh-huh.

1053
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,833
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1054
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,569
- Hello, Jedediah.
- I'm drunk.

1055
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:13,537
If you've got drunk to talk to me about...

1056
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:18,125
...Ms. Alexander, don't bother.

1057
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:21,753
I'm not interested.

1058
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:30,137
I've set back the sacred cause of reform,
is that it?

1059
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,723
All right.

1060
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:37,728
If that's the way they want it,
the people have made their choice.

1061
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,689
It's obvious the people
prefer Jim Gettys to me.

1062
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:44,359
You talk about the people
as though you owned them.

1063
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:47,320
As though they belong to you.
Goodness.

1064
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:52,325
As long as I can remember, you've talked
about giving the people their rights...

1065
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:55,704
...as if you could make them
a present of liberty...

1066
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,331
...as a reward for services rendered.

1067
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:01,293
- Jed.
- You remember the workingman?

1068
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:04,296
I'll get drunk too, Jedediah...

1069
01:13:05,757 --> 01:13:06,965
...if it'll do any good.

1070
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:10,469
It won't do any good.
Besides you never get drunk.

1071
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:13,221
You used to write an awful lot
about the workingman...

1072
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,514
Go on home.

1073
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,684
He's turning into something called
"organized labor."

1074
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:22,439
You won't like that one little bit
when you find out...

1075
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:27,694
...it means your workingman expects
something as his right, and not your gift.

1076
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:34,659
When your precious underprivileged
really get together...

1077
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,703
Oh, boy...

1078
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:40,415
That'll add up to something bigger
than your privilege...

1079
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,418
...then I don't know what you'll do.

1080
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:48,840
Sail away to a desert island probably
and lord it over the monkeys.

1081
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,302
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

1082
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:57,557
There'll probably be a few of them there
to tell me when I do something wrong.

1083
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:59,851
You may not always be so lucky.

1084
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,062
You're not very drunk.

1085
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:04,231
Drunk, what do you care?

1086
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:07,526
You don't care about anything
except you.

1087
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:14,366
You persuade people that you love them
so much that they ought to love you back.

1088
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,327
Only you want love on your own terms.

1089
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:22,499
It's something to be played your way,
according to your rules.

1090
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:32,551
- Let me work on the Chicago paper.
- What?

1091
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:37,556
You said you were looking for someone
to do dramatic "crimitism," criticism.

1092
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:38,890
I am drunk.

1093
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:44,271
I want to go to Chicago.

1094
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,190
You're too valuable here.

1095
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:53,155
- There's nothing left for me to do...
- All right, you can go to Chicago.

1096
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,865
Thank you.

1097
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:58,160
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.

1098
01:14:59,871 --> 01:15:02,289
I warn you, Jedediah,
you won't like Chicago.

1099
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:07,002
The wind comes off the lake, and they've
probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.

1100
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,254
Will Saturday after next be all right?

1101
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:12,048
- Anytime you say.
- Thank you.

1102
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:22,434
A toast to love on my terms.
Those are the only terms anybody knows:

1103
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,145
His own.

1104
01:15:37,825 --> 01:15:40,035
Mr. Kane, I'm from the Inquirer.

1105
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:52,464
- What's that, young man?
- Are you through with politics?

1106
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:56,218
Am I through with politics?
I should say vice versa.

1107
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,345
We're going to be an opera star.

1108
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,305
Are you singing at the Metropolitan?

1109
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:01,806
We certainly are.

1110
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,809
Charlie said if I didn't,
he'd build me an opera house.

1111
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,853
That won't be necessary.

1112
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:12,651
No, no, no!

1113
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:43,682
Places, everybody!

1114
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,688
Places, please!

1115
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,531
Mr. Leland is writing it
from the dramatic angle?

1116
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:45,577
- We've covered it from the news end.
- And the social.

1117
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:48,121
How about the music notice?

1118
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:50,206
Yes, it's already made up.

1119
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:53,460
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.

1120
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:57,213
- Enthusiastic?
- Yes, sir.

1121
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:58,923
- Naturally.
- Mr. Bernstein.

1122
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,968
- Mr. Kane.
- Mr. Kane. This is a surprise.

1123
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:05,972
We've got two spreads of pictures.

1124
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,932
The music notice on the front page?

1125
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,187
But there's still one notice to come.
The dramatic.

1126
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,647
The dramatic notice.

1127
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:20,653
- Mr. Bernstein, that's Mr. Leland, isn't it?
- Yes, we're waiting for it.

1128
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:27,077
- Where is he?
- Right in there, Mr. Kane.

1129
01:18:35,086 --> 01:18:36,795
Mr. Kane...

1130
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:41,466
Mr. Kane...

1131
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,937
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane...

1132
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:58,691
...haven't spoken together for years.

1133
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:03,988
- You don't suppose...
- There's nothing to suppose.

1134
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,828
Excuse me.

1135
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,846
Close the door.

1136
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:34,102
He ain't been drinking before.

1137
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,938
Never. We would have heard.

1138
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,023
What does it say there?

1139
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:42,277
The notice, what's he written?

1140
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:49,409
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty
but hopelessly incompetent amateur..."

1141
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:56,207
...last night opened
the new Chicago Opera House...

1142
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,543
"...in a performance of..."

1143
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:05,467
I still can't pronounce that name.

1144
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:12,724
"Her singing, happily,
is no concern of this department.

1145
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:17,228
Of her acting,
it is absolutely impossible to..."

1146
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:19,898
Go on.

1147
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:24,068
- Go on.
- That's all there is.

1148
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:40,668
"Of her acting it is absolutely
impossible to say anything except...

1149
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,422
...that, in the opinion of this reviewer,
it represents a new low."

1150
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,425
- In the opinion of this reviewer.
- I didn't see that.

1151
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:49,886
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein,
I'm dictating it.

1152
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:52,931
- Mr. Kane, I...
- Get me a typewriter.

1153
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:57,060
I'm going to finish Mr. Leland's notice.

1154
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,079
Hello, Bernstein.

1155
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:23,336
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Leland.

1156
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:30,718
Where's my notice, Bernstein?
I've got to finish my notice.

1157
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:34,556
- Mr. Kane is finishing it for you.
- Charlie?

1158
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,309
Charlie?

1159
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:42,438
Charlie out there?

1160
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:45,858
I guess he's fixing it up.

1161
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:51,864
I knew I'd never get that through.

1162
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:56,327
Mr. Kane's finishing your review
just the way you started it.

1163
01:21:56,745 --> 01:22:00,957
He's writing a bad notice
like you wanted it to be.

1164
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,336
I guess that'll show you.

1165
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:31,779
Hello, Jedediah.

1166
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:36,868
Hello, Charlie.

1167
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:40,538
I didn't know we were speaking.

1168
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:43,791
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.

1169
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,712
You're fired.

1170
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:05,188
Everybody knows that story,
Mr. Leland, but why did he do it?

1171
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:09,192
- How could a man write a notice...
- You just don't know Charlie.

1172
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,196
He thought that by finishing that notice
he'd show me he was an honest man.

1173
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:15,531
He was always
trying to prove something.

1174
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,743
That whole thing about Susie
being an opera singer.

1175
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:21,120
That was trying to prove something.

1176
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:25,249
You know what the headline was
the day before the election?

1177
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:31,464
"Candidate Kane
found in love nest with 'singer."'

1178
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:33,758
He was going to take
the quotes off the singer.

1179
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:35,009
Hey, nurse!

1180
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:39,222
Five years ago he wrote
from that place down there in the South.

1181
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:46,396
What's it called, Shangri-la? El Dorado?
Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?

1182
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:52,402
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.

1183
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:56,656
You caught on, didn't you?
I'm not that hard to see through.

1184
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:59,450
Well, I never even answered his letter.

1185
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:01,577
Maybe I should have.

1186
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:05,790
I guess he was pretty lonely down there
in that coliseum all those years.

1187
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:09,252
He hadn't finished it when she left him.
He never finished it.

1188
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:12,630
He never finished anything
except my notice.

1189
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:16,092
- Of course, he built the joint for her.
- That must have been love.

1190
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,510
I don't know.

1191
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:21,973
He was disappointed in the world
so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.

1192
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:25,143
It was something bigger
than an opera house anyway.

1193
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,644
- Nurse.
- Yes, Mr. Leland.

1194
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:28,146
I'm coming.

1195
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:33,151
- There's one thing you can do for me.
- Sure.

1196
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:37,697
Stop at the cigar store on your way out,
and get me a couple of good cigars.

1197
01:24:37,865 --> 01:24:40,158
- Be glad to.
- Thank you.

1198
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:42,034
One is enough.

1199
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:46,664
When I was a young man, there was
an impression that nurses were pretty.

1200
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,916
Well, it was no truer
then than it is today.

1201
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,127
- I'll take your arm.
- All right.

1202
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:54,005
- You won't forget about those cigars?
- I won't.

1203
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:59,051
Have them wrapped like toothpaste,
or they'll stop them at the desk.

1204
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:02,013
You know that young doctor
I was telling you about, well...

1205
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:05,057
...he's got an idea
he wants to keep me alive.

1206
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:39,884
I'd rather you'd just talk.
Anything that comes into your mind...

1207
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:42,261
...about yourself and Mr. Kane.

1208
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:47,809
You don't want to hear what comes into
my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.

1209
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:54,148
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung
for Charlie that first time I met him.

1210
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,736
But I did an awful lot of singing
after that.

1211
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:03,991
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.

1212
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,661
- The teachers got that, I didn't.
- What did you get?

1213
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:10,289
I didn't get a thing, except music lessons.
That's all there was in it.

1214
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:11,833
He married you, didn't he?

1215
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,378
He didn't mention anything about marriage
until after it was over and...

1216
01:26:15,546 --> 01:26:17,755
...until it got in the papers about us...

1217
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:22,802
...and he lost the election,
and that Norton woman divorced him.

1218
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:25,012
He was really interested in my voice.

1219
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,764
Why did he build that opera house?

1220
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:30,768
I didn't want it. I didn't want a thing.
It was his idea.

1221
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:34,230
Everything was his idea...

1222
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,193
...except my leaving him.

1223
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,619
Don't forget.

1224
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:51,789
Ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta.

1225
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:53,416
Don't get nervous.

1226
01:26:53,584 --> 01:26:56,210
Please. Let's come back.

1227
01:26:57,796 --> 01:27:00,965
Look at me, Mrs. Kane, darling.

1228
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,175
Get the voice out of the throat

1229
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:10,057
Place the tone right in the mask

1230
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:17,982
Diaphragm.

1231
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:26,741
You're out of pitch.

1232
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:34,248
Some people can sing. Some can't.

1233
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:36,918
Impossible. Impossible!

1234
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:40,546
It's not your job to give your opinion
of Mrs. Kane's talents.

1235
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:45,509
You're supposed to train her voice,
Signor Matiste. Nothing more.

1236
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,887
Please continue with the lesson.

1237
01:27:48,055 --> 01:27:50,473
- But, Mr. Kane.
- Please.

1238
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:55,269
I'll be the laughingstock
of the musical world. People will think...

1239
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:58,272
You're concerned what people will think?

1240
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:02,860
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit.
I'm an authority on what people will think.

1241
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:05,488
Heh. The newspapers for example.

1242
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:08,407
I run several newspapers
between here and San Francisco.

1243
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:09,992
It's all right, darling.

1244
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,703
Signor Matiste is going to listen
to reason.

1245
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:16,123
- How can I persuade you...
- You can't.

1246
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:44,485
It's all right, darling, go ahead.

1247
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:59,000
I thought you'd see it my way.

1248
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,430
No, no, no.

1249
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,525
Places! Places!

1250
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:34,160
Places! Places, everybody!

1251
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:00,704
I think it's dreadful.

1252
01:32:40,222 --> 01:32:45,309
- Stop telling me he's your friend.
- A friend don't write that kind of review.

1253
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,562
All these other papers panning me,
I could expect that.

1254
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:52,524
But for the Inquirerto run a thing
like that, spoiling my whole debut.

1255
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:54,401
- Come in.
- I'll get it.

1256
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,363
Friend. Not the kind of friends I know...

1257
01:32:57,656 --> 01:32:59,907
...but I'm not high class like you.

1258
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:01,909
And I never went to any swell schools.

1259
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,410
That'll be enough, Susan.

1260
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:05,162
- From Mr. Leland, sir.
- Jed Leland?

1261
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:08,457
He wanted me to make sure
you got this personally.

1262
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:11,377
Is that something from him?

1263
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:14,338
Charlie!

1264
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:18,676
As for you,
you ought to have your head examined.

1265
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:21,387
Sending him a letter
telling him he's fired...

1266
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:23,973
...with a $25,000 check in it.

1267
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:27,017
What kind of firing do you call that?

1268
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:31,563
You did send him a check for $25,000,
didn't you?

1269
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,149
Yes.

1270
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:39,571
I sent him a check for $25,000.

1271
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,659
What's that?

1272
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:46,328
Declaration of Principles.

1273
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:48,914
- What? What is it?
- Hmm?

1274
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:59,550
- An antique.
- You're awful funny, aren't you?

1275
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:04,346
I'll tell you one thing you're not going
to be funny about, and that's my singing.

1276
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:08,225
I'm through.
I never wanted to do it in the first place.

1277
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:10,769
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.

1278
01:34:10,937 --> 01:34:13,897
I don't propose
to have myself made ridiculous.

1279
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:17,484
You don't propose
to have yourself made ridiculous!

1280
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:20,904
What about me?
I'm the one that has to sing.

1281
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:24,616
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.
Why don't you leave me alone?

1282
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,577
My reasons satisfy me, Susan.

1283
01:34:26,745 --> 01:34:28,912
You seem unable to understand them.

1284
01:34:29,789 --> 01:34:32,041
I will not tell them to you again.

1285
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:37,921
You'll continue with your singing.

1286
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:12,182
Get Dr. Corey.

1287
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:18,021
Susan.

1288
01:36:18,565 --> 01:36:22,192
She'll be perfectly all right
in a day or two, Mr. Kane.

1289
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:28,240
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane
came to make such a foolish mistake.

1290
01:36:28,741 --> 01:36:33,328
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her
was in a somewhat larger bottle.

1291
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:38,125
The strain of preparing for the new opera
has excited and confused her.

1292
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:40,502
Yes, I'm sure that was it.

1293
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:44,047
No objections to my staying
with her, are there?

1294
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:48,302
No, not at all.
I'd like the nurse to be here too.

1295
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:51,221
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1296
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:28,383
Charlie.

1297
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:34,264
I couldn't make you see
how I felt, Charlie.

1298
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:38,477
But I couldn't go through
with the singing again.

1299
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:43,607
You don't know what it means
to know that people are...

1300
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:47,945
That the whole audience
doesn't want you.

1301
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:53,617
That's when you got to fight them.

1302
01:38:02,043 --> 01:38:03,627
All right.

1303
01:38:05,547 --> 01:38:07,965
You won't have to fight them anymore.

1304
01:38:11,261 --> 01:38:12,803
It's their loss.

1305
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:30,821
What are you doing?

1306
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:37,244
Jigsaw puzzles?

1307
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:44,459
Charlie, what time is it?

1308
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:48,046
- 11:30.
- In New York?

1309
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:53,802
- Hmm?
- I said what time is it in New York?

1310
01:38:54,637 --> 01:38:57,764
- 11:30.
- Night?

1311
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:00,392
Mm-hm.

1312
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:03,145
The Bulldog's just gone to press.

1313
01:39:03,313 --> 01:39:06,481
Well, hurray for the Bulldog.

1314
01:39:08,693 --> 01:39:12,070
Gee, 11:30. Shows are just getting out.

1315
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:14,990
People are going to nightclubs
and restaurants.

1316
01:39:15,658 --> 01:39:18,994
Of course, we're different
because we live in a palace.

1317
01:39:19,162 --> 01:39:21,705
You always said you wanted
to live in a palace.

1318
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:24,207
A person could go crazy in this dump.

1319
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:27,419
Nobody to talk to,
nobody to have any fun with.

1320
01:39:27,587 --> 01:39:28,754
Susan.

1321
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:32,841
49,000 acres of nothing
but scenery and statues.

1322
01:39:33,051 --> 01:39:34,468
I'm lonesome.

1323
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:38,472
Until yesterday, we've had no less
than 50 of your friends at any one time.

1324
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:41,266
I think if you look in the west wing...

1325
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:44,436
...you'll find about a dozen vacationists
still in residence.

1326
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:47,189
You make a joke out of everything.

1327
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:52,235
Charlie, I want to go to New York.
I'm tired of being a hostess.

1328
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:56,239
I want to have fun. Please, Charlie.

1329
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:00,786
Charlie, please.

1330
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:04,623
Our home is here, Susan.

1331
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:12,381
I don't care to visit New York.

1332
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:51,086
What are you doing?

1333
01:40:53,172 --> 01:40:57,300
Oh. One thing I can never understand:

1334
01:40:57,468 --> 01:40:59,553
How do you know
you haven't done it before?

1335
01:40:59,721 --> 01:41:03,306
It makes a whole lot more sense
than collecting statues.

1336
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:06,893
You may be right.

1337
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:09,396
I sometimes wonder...

1338
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:12,149
...but you get into the habit.

1339
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:15,152
It's not a habit, I do
it because I like it.

1340
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:17,279
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1341
01:41:17,447 --> 01:41:18,488
Huh?

1342
01:41:18,656 --> 01:41:20,365
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1343
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:23,577
Invite everybody to spend the night
at the Everglades.

1344
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:28,165
Invite everybody. Order everybody,
you mean, and make them sleep in tents.

1345
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:31,209
Who wants to sleep in tents
when they've got their own room...

1346
01:41:31,377 --> 01:41:33,920
...with a bath, where they know
where everything is?

1347
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:37,466
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1348
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:45,140
You never give me anything
I really care about.

1349
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:57,861
It can't be love

1350
01:41:58,029 --> 01:42:02,616
For there is no true love

1351
01:42:02,784 --> 01:42:05,494
I know I've played at the game

1352
01:42:05,661 --> 01:42:08,121
Like a moth in a blue flame

1353
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:12,209
Lost in the end Just the same

1354
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:15,045
All these years

1355
01:42:15,213 --> 01:42:20,050
My heart's been floating around
In a puddle of tears

1356
01:42:20,218 --> 01:42:24,221
Mm I wonder what it is

1357
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:28,558
Sure, you give me things,
but that don't mean anything to you.

1358
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:34,022
You're in a tent, darling,
you aren't at home.

1359
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:37,442
I can hear you very well
if you speak in a normal tone of voice.

1360
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:41,446
What's the difference between giving me
a bracelet or giving someone $100,000...

1361
01:42:41,614 --> 01:42:44,574
...for a statue you'll keep crated up
and never look at?

1362
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:47,035
It's just money. It doesn't mean anything.

1363
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:50,330
You never really gave me anything
that you care about.

1364
01:42:50,498 --> 01:42:53,041
- I want you to stop this.
- I'm not going to stop it.

1365
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:56,086
- Right now.
- You never gave me anything in your life.

1366
01:42:56,254 --> 01:42:58,588
You just tried to buy me
into giving you something.

1367
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:00,298
Susan!

1368
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:07,430
- It can't be love
- It can't be love

1369
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:10,433
For there is no true love

1370
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:21,570
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.

1371
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:23,613
You don't love me.

1372
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:25,657
You want me to love you.

1373
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:28,660
Sure. "I'm Charles Foster Kane.

1374
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:31,371
Whatever you want,
just name it and it's yours.

1375
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:33,748
"But you gotta love me."

1376
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,964
Don't tell me you're sorry.

1377
01:43:42,884 --> 01:43:44,634
I'm not sorry.

1378
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,064
Mr. Kane?

1379
01:43:58,482 --> 01:44:01,234
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.

1380
01:44:04,113 --> 01:44:07,282
Marie has been packing her
since morning.

1381
01:44:13,372 --> 01:44:17,083
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.
Tell him he can get the bags.

1382
01:44:17,627 --> 01:44:18,877
Yes, madame.

1383
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,173
Have you gone completely crazy?

1384
01:44:23,341 --> 01:44:26,509
Don't you know that our guests,
that everyone will know about this?

1385
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:28,470
Packed your bag, sent for the car...

1386
01:44:28,638 --> 01:44:31,848
And left you? Of course they'll hear.

1387
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:35,518
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you.

1388
01:44:35,728 --> 01:44:38,563
But I never imagined
people wouldn't know.

1389
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:42,901
I won't let you go.

1390
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:51,868
Goodbye, Charlie.

1391
01:44:55,456 --> 01:44:56,873
Susan.

1392
01:45:07,051 --> 01:45:08,677
Please don't go.

1393
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:16,101
Please, Susan.

1394
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:22,732
From now on, everything will be
exactly the way you want it to be.

1395
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,985
Not the way I think you want it...

1396
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:28,154
...but your way.

1397
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:31,616
Hmm?

1398
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:35,996
You mustn't go.

1399
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,418
You can't do this to me.

1400
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:44,754
I see.

1401
01:45:45,673 --> 01:45:48,258
It's you that this is being done to.

1402
01:45:48,551 --> 01:45:50,343
It's not me at all.

1403
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:52,512
Not what it means to me.

1404
01:45:54,682 --> 01:45:56,850
I can't do this to you?

1405
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:00,270
Oh, yes, I can.

1406
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:22,459
In case you haven't heard,
I lost all my money and it was plenty.

1407
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:24,878
The last 10 years
have been difficult for many.

1408
01:46:25,046 --> 01:46:27,964
They haven't been tough on me.
I just lost all my money.

1409
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:31,676
- You're going down to Xanadu?
- Monday, with boys from the office.

1410
01:46:31,844 --> 01:46:34,512
Mr. Rawlston wants
the whole place photographed.

1411
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:36,181
We run a picture magazine.

1412
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:39,976
If you're smart, you'll get in touch
with Raymond. He's the butler.

1413
01:46:40,144 --> 01:46:42,062
You'll learn a lot from him.

1414
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,689
He knows where
all the bodies are buried.

1415
01:46:44,857 --> 01:46:48,068
You know, all the same,
I feel kind of sorry for Mr. Kane.

1416
01:46:50,321 --> 01:46:51,988
Don't you think I do?

1417
01:46:56,577 --> 01:46:59,537
What do you know, it's morning already.

1418
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,628
Come around and tell me the story
of your life sometime.

1419
01:47:13,636 --> 01:47:15,220
Rosebud?

1420
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:19,933
I'll tell you about Rosebud.

1421
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:22,352
How much is it worth to you?

1422
01:47:22,937 --> 01:47:24,729
A thousand dollars?

1423
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:32,237
Okay.

1424
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:36,491
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.

1425
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:40,870
- He acted funny sometimes, you know?
- No, I didn't.

1426
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:43,540
Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.

1427
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:46,209
I've been working for him 11 years now...

1428
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:50,213
...in charge of the whole place,
so I ought to know.

1429
01:47:50,548 --> 01:47:51,756
- Rosebud.
- Yes.

1430
01:47:51,924 --> 01:47:56,845
Like I tell you, the old man
acted kind of funny sometimes...

1431
01:47:57,012 --> 01:48:00,640
...but I knew how to handle him...
Need a lot of service?

1432
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:03,768
Yeah. But I knew how to handle him.

1433
01:48:03,936 --> 01:48:05,478
Like that time his wife left.

1434
01:50:21,365 --> 01:50:22,615
Rosebud.

1435
01:51:30,684 --> 01:51:32,226
I see.

1436
01:51:32,895 --> 01:51:36,272
- And that's what you know about Rosebud?
- Yeah.

1437
01:51:36,899 --> 01:51:39,275
I heard him say it that other time too.

1438
01:51:39,943 --> 01:51:41,861
He just said:

1439
01:51:42,237 --> 01:51:43,988
"Rosebud."

1440
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:47,450
Then he dropped the glass ball
and it broke on the floor.

1441
01:51:48,118 --> 01:51:52,330
He didn't say anything after that,
and I knew he was dead.

1442
01:51:53,082 --> 01:51:55,750
He said all kinds of things
that didn't mean anything.

1443
01:51:55,918 --> 01:51:58,795
- Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
- Hmm...

1444
01:51:58,962 --> 01:52:01,589
- Yes and no.
- That isn't worth $1000.

1445
01:52:01,757 --> 01:52:04,717
You can keep on asking questions
if you want to.

1446
01:52:04,968 --> 01:52:06,636
We're leaving tonight...

1447
01:52:07,429 --> 01:52:09,305
...when we're through taking pictures.

1448
01:52:09,473 --> 01:52:11,349
Allow yourself plenty of time.

1449
01:52:11,517 --> 01:52:15,353
The train stops at the junction on signal,
but they don't like to wait.

1450
01:52:16,397 --> 01:52:19,357
I can remember
when they'd wait all day...

1451
01:52:19,691 --> 01:52:20,983
...if Mr. Kane said so.

1452
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:25,405
Better get going.

1453
01:52:26,782 --> 01:52:28,199
Take a picture of that.

1454
01:52:28,409 --> 01:52:32,328
- Can we come down?
- Yes, hurry up. We're leaving.

1455
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:38,000
How much do you think
all this is worth, Mr. Thompson?

1456
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:39,752
Millions.

1457
01:52:41,213 --> 01:52:42,338
If anybody wants it.

1458
01:52:42,506 --> 01:52:45,133
Well, at least he brought all this stuff
to America.

1459
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,968
- What's that?
- Another Venus.

1460
01:52:47,136 --> 01:52:48,344
25,000 bucks.

1461
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:51,013
A lot of money to pay
for a dame without a head.

1462
01:52:51,181 --> 01:52:54,100
- The banks are out of luck?
- Oh, I don't know.

1463
01:52:54,852 --> 01:52:57,520
- They'll clear all right.
- He never threw anything away.

1464
01:52:57,688 --> 01:53:02,817
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467
employees of the New York Inquirer."

1465
01:53:02,985 --> 01:53:08,239
"One stove from the estate of Mary Kane,
$2."

1466
01:53:08,407 --> 01:53:10,825
We're supposed to get everything,
junk as well as art.

1467
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:12,577
He sure liked to collect things.

1468
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:14,078
Anything and everything.

1469
01:53:14,246 --> 01:53:15,872
A regular crow, eh?

1470
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:18,666
- Hey, look, a jigsaw puzzle.
- We got a lot of those.

1471
01:53:18,834 --> 01:53:21,836
A Burmese temple and three
Spanish ceilings down the hall.

1472
01:53:22,337 --> 01:53:23,713
Part of a Scotch castle...

1473
01:53:23,881 --> 01:53:25,715
...that needs to be unwrapped.

1474
01:53:26,049 --> 01:53:27,467
Put all this stuff together:

1475
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:30,678
The palaces and the paintings,
and the toys and everything.

1476
01:53:30,846 --> 01:53:32,805
What would it spell?

1477
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:37,018
- Charles Foster Kane?
- Or Rosebud.

1478
01:53:37,269 --> 01:53:40,146
- How about it, Jerry?
- What's Rosebud?

1479
01:53:40,314 --> 01:53:42,857
That's what he said when he died.

1480
01:53:43,525 --> 01:53:45,610
Did you ever find out what it means?

1481
01:53:45,777 --> 01:53:47,904
- No, I didn't.
- What did you find out about him?

1482
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:49,572
Not much, really.

1483
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:54,368
We'd better get started.

1484
01:53:56,288 --> 01:53:58,706
What have you been doing all this time?

1485
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:01,292
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle.

1486
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:05,129
If you'd discovered what Rosebud meant,
I bet it would've explained everything.

1487
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:06,839
No, I don't think so.

1488
01:54:07,466 --> 01:54:08,841
No.

1489
01:54:09,009 --> 01:54:12,553
He was a man who got
everything he wanted, and then lost it.

1490
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:16,307
Maybe Rosebud was something
he couldn't get or something he lost.

1491
01:54:16,475 --> 01:54:18,768
It wouldn't have explained anything.

1492
01:54:19,603 --> 01:54:22,730
I don't think any word
can explain a man's life.

1493
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:27,902
No. I guess Rosebud is just a piece
in a jigsaw puzzle.

1494
01:54:29,071 --> 01:54:30,780
A missing piece.

1495
01:54:34,117 --> 01:54:35,743
Well...

1496
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,788
...come on, everybody...

1497
01:54:40,624 --> 01:54:42,875
...we'll miss the train.

1498
01:55:47,566 --> 01:55:49,817
Throw that junk in.

1499
01:57:22,828 --> 01:57:27,581
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge. Huh?

1500
01:57:27,749 --> 01:57:30,042
Everything was his idea...

1501
01:57:31,837 --> 01:57:33,671
...except my leaving him.

1502
01:57:34,548 --> 01:57:36,841
I've got his trunk all packed.

1503
01:57:37,843 --> 01:57:40,219
I've had it packed for a week now.

1504
01:57:40,387 --> 01:57:44,056
Sometimes I think I'd prefer
a rival of flesh and blood.

1505
01:57:45,976 --> 01:57:48,477
You're gonna need more than one lesson.

1506
01:57:49,354 --> 01:57:51,897
And you'll get more than one lesson.

1507
01:57:56,653 --> 01:57:58,863
Who's a busy man, me?

1508
01:57:59,030 --> 01:58:02,032
I'm chairman of the board.
I got nothing but time.

1509
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:03,826
What do you want to know?

1510
01:58:03,994 --> 01:58:08,831
We thought, if we could find out what he
meant by his last words as he was dying...

1511
01:58:09,166 --> 01:58:12,001
- Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
- Hmm...

1512
01:58:12,627 --> 01:58:13,794
Yes and no.

1513
01:58:13,962 --> 01:58:16,881
"I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."

1514
01:58:17,132 --> 01:58:21,051
I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper.
