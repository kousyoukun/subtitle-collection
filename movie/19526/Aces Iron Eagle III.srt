1
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,805
They're off, ladies and gentlemen!
There they go!

2
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:32,750
Classic World War II aircraft.
The Axis versus the Allies!

3
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,515
The Spitfire
Group Captain Nigel Palmer

4
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,615
versus the Messerschmitt
of Major Ernst Leichman.

5
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,094
And Japan's Colonel
Sue Horikoshi in the Zero

6
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:46,588
versus our own Colonel Chappy Sinclair
in the P-38 Lightning!

7
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,660
- Hello.
- Hey!

8
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,763
I wouldn't have thought
she has the power for the snap roll.

9
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,503
Stockman has spruced it up a bit
and added a few other little goodies.

10
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,774
Still not much for the Spit,
I'm afraid.

11
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,575
Her guns have been updated
by Dassault,

12
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,640
and her snout's been
re-engined by Rolls Royce.

13
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,312
Oh, really? Well, don't look now,

14
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,480
but her butt is about to be
reamed by Lockheed.

15
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,519
Regret to end
the contest so soon.

16
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,597
Looky here,
looks like Tokyo's hot to trot.

17
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,772
Appears your shooter
had a case of premature ejection.

18
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,142
Very unusual maneuver.

19
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:35,045
Don't you remember?
Zeroes were famous for it over Midway.

20
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,573
And P-51s used to counter
with this move.

21
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,057
Uh-oh.

22
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,436
Whoo!

23
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,875
Ha-ha.
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.

24
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,774
Another spectacular victory

25
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,808
for Colonel Chappy Sinclair,

26
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:16,379
as Colonel Sue Horikoshi
is acknowledged in defeat.

27
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,153
Let's hear it
for the Red, White and Blue.

28
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,890
(crowd cheering)

29
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,991
And now the Spitfire's Battle
of Britain, Pilot Nigel Palmer,

30
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,595
versus Germany's Ernst Leichman,
flying the Messerschmitt 109.

31
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:35,597
We haven't seen the likes
of a struggle like this since the 1940s.

32
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,169
They're begging for a spectacle,
you bloody Kraut!

33
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,806
- Let's give them one.
- All right, Limey.

34
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,713
Mind your elbows,
mein Herr.

35
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,780
Yeah, by the looks of this
it could be a close one.

36
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,051
Hold on to your hats!

37
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,734
Those boys are gonna give me
a heart attack.

38
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:08,195
Ladies and gentlemen, I swear
I didn't know they were gonna do that.

39
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,478
Walk up for another kill

40
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,177
for Major Ernst Leichman.

41
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:21,618
Tomorrow is our last show of the season,
ladies and gentlemen.

42
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,555
The Axis and the Allies
fly again.

43
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,956
We certainly hope
you all can join us.

44
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,724
We still have a few tickets
for tonight's End of the Season Party.

45
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,630
Your chance to meet the Aces,
so hurry.

46
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,657
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.

47
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,193
Now, don't go committing
hara-kiri, Sue.

48
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,502
- You'll get me next time.
- No. You're too pretty to die.

49
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,471
Excuse me.

50
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,944
- Colonel.
- Yeah.

51
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,413
Ramón Morales
just crashed in the Gulf.

52
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,249
- Is he all right?
- He's dead, Chappy.

53
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,545
Dead?

54
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,183
- When? How?
- I don't know.

55
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,785
All I know is a whole bunch of suits
just flew in from Houston.

56
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,762
General Simms
wants you back on the base.

57
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,457
Now.

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,458
Sue. You tell Stockman
that there's been an accident.

59
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,472
- I'll try and be back tonight.
- Oh.

60
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:23,104
- Enzo!
- Si, mi capitán.

61
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:29,243
I want more trucks, more jeeps,
50 more armed guards.

62
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,191
We move again so soon?

63
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,195
A small incident has transpired.

64
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,719
DEA may become bothersome.

65
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:41,063
So I take the risk. We simply move
higher up into the mountains.

66
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,569
Más fuego aqui, apúrale.

67
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,138
Apúrese, vieja.

68
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,700
- Apúrese.
- Escovez.

69
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,577
Ask the mayor when they'll finish
packaging this consignment.

70
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,639
Quiere saber cuánto tiempo
toma empacar todo.

71
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,445
Como en dos dias.

72
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,714
Y ya he estado trabajando
muy duro para ustedes.

73
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,018
Por favor, senor,
le suplico que suelte a mi hija.

74
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,080
Yeah yeah yeah.

75
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,819
He says very quickly.
Perhaps two days.

76
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:10,056
But he pleads with you
to release his daughter.

77
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:15,225
Tell him unless he gets back
to work quickly,

78
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,101
I will kill his daughter
in front of him.

79
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,367
Dice que si no vuelves
a trabajar enseguida...

80
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,379
Up in the mountains,
good workers are hard to find.

81
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,480
Maybe this time
we should take them with us.

82
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,957
Impossible. They've seen
the markings of the planes.

83
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,860
Though these people
have served this land well, Juanito,

84
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,592
in five days time
we shall bury them in it.

85
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,500
Flight Commander
Finley report to operations.

86
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,806
...that's part of the tail section,
let's put it over here.

87
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,989
Coast Guard
find the body too?

88
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,463
Most of it. The medics
are doing an autopsy.

89
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,989
His personal things are over here.

90
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,142
Do you know
these people, Colonel?

91
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,618
- I didn't catch your name.
- Well, I'm Warren Crawford.

92
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,988
Henry, bring that over here.

93
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,350
It's his family.

94
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,796
Kid brothers, dad, sister.

95
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,626
She went to UCLA
on an athletic scholarship.

96
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,830
This picture was taken
the day she graduated.

97
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,500
He's from a little village
in the Peruvian mountains.

98
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,973
His father's the mayor.

99
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,446
He has an aunt
living here in Brownsville.

100
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,779
That's all in your files.
Anybody's told her?

101
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,216
She's been informed, yeah.

102
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,584
Poor people, aren't they?

103
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,885
Very poor.

104
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,250
They worked their butts off
to make something of themselves.

105
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,163
We think he was shot down
by the Colombian cocaine cartels.

106
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,359
Well they had to get to one of us
sooner or later.

107
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,063
We're out there tracking them
all the time.

108
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,470
Morales was in competition with him.
They don't like that.

109
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,499
What the hell is that
supposed to mean? Who are you?

110
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,979
I'm the station chief,
DEA, Houston.

111
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:46,376
Chappy, I think you better
take a look at his auxiliary fuel tank.

112
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,958
Damn! I don't believe this.

113
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,593
Where is his flight report?
Who was with him?

114
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,730
I was, Colonel. It was just a routine
interdiction mission.

115
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,230
Over Sector Seven he said he had orders
from you to fly a classified pattern.

116
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,540
He would rendezvous
one hour after break-off.

117
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,842
I never gave those orders.

118
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,905
I wouldn't know about that, sir.

119
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,476
He broke off over the Yucatan.
I got his mayday 45 minutes later.

120
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,757
By the time I got there
there was nothing but wreckage, sir.

121
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,421
- GULFSTAT confirm this?
- They were off-line for EV tests.

122
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,522
DEA intends to run
a full investigation on this, Colonel.

123
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,228
We'll want to talk you again soon.

124
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,101
The DEA isn't running
any full investigations on my command,

125
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,630
and it's God damned well not
gonna harass any of my senior officers.

126
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,644
Well, sir, there's no way Morales
was operating alone,

127
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,738
not with a quarter of a billion
worth of cocaine in his tank.

128
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,113
Maybe, maybe not.
But this kind of scandal

129
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,745
makes headlines the Pentagon
doesn't like one damn bit.

130
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,551
Services prefer to clean
their own houses, Mr. Crawford.

131
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,252
I'll lunch my own little look-see
into this matter.

132
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:04,422
Excuse me, sir, but DEA
does have jurisdiction in this case.

133
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,488
You're on a military installation, son.

134
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,262
The only thing
that has jurisdiction around here

135
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,326
is the star on my shoulder.

136
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,104
Take your people back to Houston,
and I'll see you get a full report.

137
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,572
(telephone ringing)

138
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,606
You're late.

139
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:29,212
We're clear, but GULFSTAT
reports that DEA

140
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,156
is tightening surveillance
on fighter aircraft in the entire area.

141
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,093
Your moment of madness could've
place the entire operation in jeopardy.

142
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,153
I had no choice.
Morales was running scared.

143
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,960
He threatened
to go to Colonel Sinclair.

144
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,491
Just as well I have a contingency plan,
isn't it, Captain?

145
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,265
Give me the code numbers.

146
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,167
Lima-Romeo-654.

147
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,199
They have to touch down by 0500.

148
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,677
Escovez.

149
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,991
The Jackhammer flight leaves
for Lethridge at midnight.

150
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,788
We must begin
loading immediately.

151
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,557
Use all available personnel.

152
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:15,124
(En Vogue singing
"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy")

153
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,348
Give me a blazing sun,

154
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,945
occasional clouds for cover,

155
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,082
and I'll shoot the ass
off any aircraft flying.

156
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:43,789
Well maybe next year Arthur'll send you
up against an F-16 or a Mirage.

157
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,821
Call it The Battle
of the Generation Gap.

158
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,028
Agh. Flying computers, Captain.

159
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,936
In our day, it used to be the man,
not the machine.

160
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,736
Technology is no match
for seasoning.

161
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,802
- Damn shame you missed it, chap.
- Don't hold my youth against me.

162
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,608
By the time
I was old enough to join up,

163
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,376
there was nothing but missiles
and Mach speed.

164
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,291
Very fine beer.

165
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,991
May have to import it
for company cafeteria.

166
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,466
I was told you work
for an aerospace firm,

167
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,969
but I didn't fancy you as caterer.

168
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,596
He's chairman of the board.

169
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,706
What do you say, we press
a little flesh, gentlemen?

170
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,075
You know, mix and mingle,
work the crowd!

171
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,878
You know this little party
could line us up to real supporters

172
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,113
- for next year's show.
- Well, count me out.

173
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,588
When I retire, I'm gonna buy myself
a little ranch, and a big hammock,

174
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,147
I want to sit around
all day working on my tan.

175
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:50,822
Ha. Ha. 10'll get you 20,
that'll last about a week.

176
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,797
When this batch is dry, use these people
to help with the packaging.

177
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,498
Five kilos in each pound here?

178
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,011
(struggling)

179
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,961
(Choking)

180
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,530
Este no es mi trabajo.

181
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,835
- A trabajar.
- Yo soy el Mayor de la ciudad.

182
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:42,932
- ? Aqui?
- Si.

183
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,499
- Trabajan todos.
- Mande.

184
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,105
- Muchas gracias.
- Bien, muchacho.

185
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,448
Buenas.

186
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,457
Detente.
Cuidado.

187
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,623
- Rápido, rápido, rápido.
- Vamos.

188
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,964
Mira. Amo, amo.

189
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,562
- A la plataforma.
- Atención.

190
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,799
Más rápido!

191
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,409
Vamos.

192
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,107
Papá.

193
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,515
Papá, voy a Lethridge
a buscar a Ramón.

194
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,319
Siganme.

195
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,691
Vamos, rápido.

196
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,775
Acá.

197
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,000
Come on, move it.

198
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,179
Finish loading and be gone.
Nobody is gonna stop you at the gate.

199
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:02,105
You're Anna Morales,
Ramón's sister.

200
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,700
What the hell happened to you?

201
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,212
I need to find my brother,
where is he?

202
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,512
Anna, I'm Chappy Sinclair,
Ramón's friend.

203
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,313
There's something
I need to tell y...

204
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,445
There's no time to talk,
I need to find my brother.

205
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,546
My whole village
and family is in danger...

206
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,318
- Anna, Ramón is dead.
- I need to find...

207
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,462
He was shot down in the Gulf.
He was carrying cocaine in his tanks.

208
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,526
No es cierto.
Ramón, Ramón.

209
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,433
Ramón.

210
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,435
They told Ramón they would kill us all
if he didn't help them.

211
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,475
Who?
Who told you that?

212
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,315
A German called Kleiss.

213
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,617
He's going to kill everyone
in four days, my family...

214
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,749
- Slow down, slow down.
...everyone.

215
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,455
Now, how did you get here?

216
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,432
I escaped on the plane that brought
the drugs here to your base.

217
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,128
Drugs are being brought
here to this base?

218
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,729
Yes, they're unloading now.
They're in the barrels.

219
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,798
Kleiss called it the Jackhammer
flight to Lethridge.

220
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,646
Give me the key.
You stay right here.

221
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,878
I'll be back as fast as I can.
You keep this door locked.

222
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,681
You don't open this door
for anyone.

223
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,860
Hold it. Hold it!

224
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,976
- Hold it.
- Stop right there.

225
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,380
Let me see your orders.

226
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,480
- What are you bringing in?
- Hydraulic fluid, sir.

227
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,582
A milk run.
Next stop is San Diego.

228
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,094
This plane ain't stopping nowhere
until I see what's in those barrels.

229
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,255
- Get me a crowbar.
- Yes, sir.

230
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,332
Don't stand there, get another crowbar
and open up the rest of those barrels.

231
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,788
What's going on here, Colonel?

232
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,132
I think there's drugs
in this plane, sir.

233
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,799
The DEA was right.
Morales wasn't just a lone eagle.

234
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,676
Offload the rest of this cargo
and have it checked.

235
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,474
Where are you getting
your information, Colonel?

236
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,038
Morales's sister.
She's in his quarters.

237
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,947
She'll lay the whole thing
out for you.

238
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,483
It's all right, Anna.
It's Chappy Sinclair.

239
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,089
Anna?

240
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,434
Anna?

241
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,577
She's gone.

242
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,447
Why don't you take a little water
with your booze, Colonel?

243
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:36,079
I thought... she was here,
General, I swear.

244
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:39,522
This base is going to close
in three weeks.

245
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,688
My base for 12 years.
My men, my planes, my equipment

246
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,425
transferred to other commands,
all over this country.

247
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,831
I wanna go out with honor, Colonel.

248
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:53,133
I don't want a trumped-up scandal
and I don't want gossip and talk.

249
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,162
Have you got that?

250
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,301
Yes, General.
I've got that.

251
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,752
How do I know that you're not
running a line of bullshit

252
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,778
just to save
your own ass, Colonel?

253
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,120
You don't,
until I find the girl.

254
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,751
This guy Kleiss she talked about,
does he mean anything to you?

255
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,822
Gustav Kleiss has been
on the Fed's books for years,

256
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:57,562
dealing arms, heroin,
chemical weapons in the Middle East.

257
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,060
He uses the money to finance
hate groups all over the world.

258
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,199
Can you get
any information from Peru?

259
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,675
That's not such an easy thing
to do, Colonel.

260
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,110
You know how much corruption
there is down there?

261
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,774
These are poor countries
surviving on narco bucks.

262
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,443
They don't want
to hear from DEA.

263
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,079
So, what about
this Jackhammer?

264
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,420
I'll tell you what,

265
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,154
you get her to pinpoint
the location of Kleiss,

266
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,253
and I'll see what I can do.

267
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,193
Well she's got an aunt in Brownsville,
maybe she's there.

268
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,227
Now, that's a rough neighborhood.
You watch your ass, Colonel.

269
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,432
Always do.

270
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:41,376
(Dance music playing)

271
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,278
Want some action?

272
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,983
Oh, come on.

273
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,485
(baby crying)

274
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,314
Excuse me.
315?

275
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,350
Lotto game was last night,
brother.

276
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,511
- Mrs. Del Prado?
- Si.

277
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,275
I'm Colonel Sinclair.

278
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,174
Please, please,
I must speak with Anna.

279
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,707
Váyase. Váyase.

280
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,722
Wait! Anna.
I just wanna talk to you.

281
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,187
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait, hey!

282
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,063
I'm getting too old
for this shit.

283
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,597
Hey, don't...

284
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,067
What kind of shit
are you looking for, lady?

285
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,634
Blow...?

286
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:29,546
Uh-uh!

287
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,783
Put it down.
Now.

288
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,862
See? This homeboy don't dig
any piece carrying by non-members.

289
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:47,531
Now, baby,
wanna leave it to brother?

290
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,437
Or you want to stick around here?

291
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,305
Leave, thanks.

292
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,038
Hey, maybe
you should just say no.

293
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:01,980
I owe you one.

294
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,189
You better start trusting me.

295
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,196
How can I? A soldier came
to arrest me after you left Ramón's.

296
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,492
Abre la puerta,
es Anna.

297
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,465
A soldier?
Did you just see his face?

298
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,559
Just his gun.
I ran off the back and I came here.

299
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,794
My aunt has been waiting
for me to return.

300
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,273
Estoy bien, tia.
No se mortifique.

301
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,299
There's nothing you can do alone.

302
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,436
I've been to the DEA
and they're willing to help.

303
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,880
I need for you to point out the exact
location of Kleiss' set-up.

304
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,713
It has to be accurate.
Do you think you can do that?

305
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,516
I think so.
But I'll need a little time.

306
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,545
All right.
I gotta go fly.

307
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,526
There's something I have to do.
I'll be back soon.

308
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,926
Look, everything
is gonna be okay.

309
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,830
But no more running out.
All right?

310
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,596
No more running out.

311
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,345
Look, boy.

312
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,376
$50.
You keep an eye on the girl.

313
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,411
Deal?

314
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,914
Deal.

315
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:18,554
(Dance music playing)

316
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:46,982
Oye, vato, put that shit
back in the van.

317
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,220
I'm paying the house all day.

318
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,661
You cover my ass.
Comprende?

319
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:54,791
Comprende.

320
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,532
Thank you, Jesus.

321
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,987
Archie, bring them down now.
Chappy's here.

322
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,464
Oh!
Permiso senora.

323
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,669
Oye, digame
if the old lady comes back.

324
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,486
(struggling)

325
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,456
Bitch!

326
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,137
- Now, get your ass in the bedroom.
- No.

327
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,725
(struggling)

328
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,700
- I told you to stay outside, vato.
- You can't do this.

329
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,134
Watch me.

330
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,429
I'm afraid I never miss twice,
Colonel.

331
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,804
Oh my God!

332
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,369
Tower, this is Chappy.

333
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,643
Clear the runway.
I got problems.

334
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,153
(crowd voicing concern)

335
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:46,757
(coughing)

336
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,730
Chappy!

337
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,928
Oh, man.
Thank God you're all right.

338
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,441
Somebody must've
fooled around with the ammo.

339
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,239
I'm damned grateful
you're such a lousy shot.

340
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,152
Who in the hell could've made
a mistake like that?

341
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,213
That was no mistake,
Arthur.

342
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,451
There is some deep shit
going down here.

343
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,258
And if they tried for me, they're damned
sure gonna try for Anna. I need a car.

344
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,230
Thank you for your cooperation.

345
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:23,062
- Who's Anna?
- I'll let you know later.

346
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,069
We go with you.

347
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,664
If you're in serious deep shit,
maybe you need some help.

348
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:31,038
Chappy Sinclair is unhurt.

349
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,269
Let's go.

350
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,744
Let's hear it
for a great piece of flying.

351
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,651
Baby, take us for a ride.

352
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,749
Wife say
travel in America...

353
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,685
...very dangerous.

354
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:40,108
He tried to take her out.
And I don't mean for dinner.

355
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,178
Where's Anna?

356
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,808
Yo, baby, come on in.
The coast is clear.

357
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,585
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

358
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,119
- You know him?
- Oh, yeah.

359
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,155
He's a heavy homeboy
from the hood.

360
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,963
My ass ain't gonna be worth a shit.

361
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:07,562
Nobody's ass is gonna be worth anything
if we don't find her a safe place.

362
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,436
You can take her back to my place.

363
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,465
We could stay with her.

364
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,668
What are you gonna do with him?

365
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,146
Well I'm gonna get some of my brothers
to help me dump his ass.

366
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,086
You can't hang here, brother.

367
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,884
I mean, the police are gonna
be happy that he ain't breathing,

368
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,753
but his homeboys
are gonna come look for him,

369
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,782
like inquiring
minds wanna know.

370
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,187
All right.

371
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:34,559
And how about your aunt?

372
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,567
She's gone
to stay with friends for a few days.

373
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,932
Did you manage to finish that map?

374
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:38,958
- Yes, I did.
- All right.

375
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,629
Here it is.

376
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:45,198
We've got enough time to get to
the DEA office before they close.

377
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,608
Come on, let's go.

378
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,679
No help.

379
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,344
Peruvian justice people say

380
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:57,479
there's nothing in the area except
coffee growers. SATS confirm.

381
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,888
Oh no. Kleiss' set up
is camouflaged.

382
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,724
- You have to come in low with a plane.
- Izquitos airbase is in the same grid.

383
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,389
They'd know if anything was going on
without visual confirmation.

384
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,295
I have to take their word for it.

385
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,358
- That's bullshit.
- I don't make the policy.

386
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:14,235
DEA will get Kleiss.
It may take a while,

387
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,137
but we will bring
the bastard in.

388
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,699
A while?
That's a whole lot of comfort

389
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,177
for those people who are
gonna die in a couple of days.

390
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,806
People die in the drug world
all the time, Chappy.

391
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,282
There's nothing more
that can be done right now.

392
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:29,377
Don't you read
the papers, Sinclair?

393
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,082
Peru's big
on territorial sovereignty.

394
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:35,490
No surveillance, no interdiction,
no nothing without their permission.

395
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:39,826
An F-16 can go so fast, it could aim
from Bogotá and end up over in Lima.

396
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,594
Faster than you can say
"My God, I'm in the wrong airspace."

397
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,658
And get back out,
just as fast.

398
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,431
I don't believe I'm hearing this.

399
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,201
Come here, Chappy.

400
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,472
This is my whole life
here on the wall.

401
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,536
Take a good look,
Korea, Nam, the Philippines.

402
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,707
You're asking me
to put it on the line

403
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,478
by authorizing a low-level
reconnaissance mission?

404
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,147
I wouldn't involve you, sir.

405
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,489
You bet your ass you're not gonna
involve me. You're grounded, Sinclair.

406
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,361
This Morales affair
has screwed all of us.

407
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,560
Whatever your involvement is,
bury it

408
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,966
along with him.

409
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,966
Dismissed.

410
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:26,610
Te suplicamos humildemente
por el alma de tu siervo Ramón,

411
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,636
que has sacado hoy
de este mundo.

412
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,410
No la entregues
en manos del enemigo,

413
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,078
ni la dejes
en perpetuo olvido.

414
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,747
Manda a tus ángeles
que la reciban

415
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,018
y la lleven
a la patria del cielo.

416
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:44,323
Para que pues, ha esperado,
y criado... creido en mi,

417
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,796
no padezca
las penas del Infierno,

418
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,665
sino que es unir las voces
sobre los votos eternos...

419
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:12,382
I tried everything, Anna.
It's important that you understand that.

420
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,448
You're everything
Ramón said you were.

421
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,450
But I've been
depending on you too much.

422
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,656
Now I have to do something myself.

423
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:21,926
Like what?

424
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,434
A few men escaped
to another village.

425
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,062
Maybe we can mount
some kind of attack.

426
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:29,129
With just a few guys?

427
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,300
I have to try.

428
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,503
My family's lives
are at stake.

429
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,877
You have to understand that.

430
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,575
(Country music playing)

431
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:22,150
Hardly a proper attendance
for a wake, Chappy old chap.

432
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,718
- May we join you?
- Be my guest.

433
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,458
Chappy, we come
to say goodbye.

434
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,659
No. Not before
I buy you all a drink.

435
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,607
Where you all going?

436
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,206
Well, Sue
has a business to run.

437
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,740
I have grandchildren
to terrorize.

438
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,117
And I'm sure Leichman here

439
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,714
has Nazi hunters to evade.

440
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:56,488
Bottom line is... there's not
a lot of calls for arthritic pilots.

441
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:01,022
At least we were all pilots,
before they bastardized the bloody word.

442
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,158
With all due respect
to the deceased, of course.

443
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,397
The only thing that was bastardized
is the way this kid went down.

444
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,200
The way they're handling
this damn thing.

445
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,433
He was a good pilot.

446
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,134
Oh, sure he was, Chappy.

447
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:14,042
Look, I don't mean any offense, but you
have to admit that the kids today

448
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,138
do it all with terminals
and the monitors and what have you.

449
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,046
Now, as Ernst
is so fond of saying,

450
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,985
"It used to be about the man,
not the machine."

451
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,078
Yes.

452
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,888
Hey, how would you like
to prove that theory?

453
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:44,701
I would.

454
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,676
What makes you so ready
to go after this Kraut?

455
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,374
All Krauts weren't Nazis,
you know?

456
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:55,351
But this Kleiss
was the worse kind.

457
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:57,684
He even killed his brother,

458
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:01,282
for refusing to shoot down
enemy pilots parachuting to safety.

459
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,730
And then he had the gall to steal
his dead brother's Medal of Honor.

460
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:16,438
Well, why not?
Can't have you Yanks and Jerries

461
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,465
dukin' it out all over
the Peruvian jungles

462
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,307
without a representative
of Queen and country.

463
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,586
I would be honored.

464
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,631
Gentlemen.

465
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:52,067
- To Ramón.
- To Ramón.

466
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,480
These planes
are priceless antiques.

467
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,316
They are not battle gear.

468
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,585
Pound for pound, flown
by the right men, they're lethal.

469
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,922
Hell, you modified them.
You know what they can do.

470
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,722
What about air-to-ground
ordinance?

471
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:11,887
These... these laser units.

472
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,021
How do you think
you're gonna get all that...?

473
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,496
I got a hold card at the base.

474
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,124
They can get us outfitted in a day.

475
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:19,158
Anna leaves 12 hours earlier,
and hooks up with the local resistance.

476
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,228
Oh, that's a real comfort.

477
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,139
All they've got to do is to line up
the lasers with the targets,

478
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,039
and leave the rest to us.

479
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,306
Now,
if they can get in there undetected,

480
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,108
a two-year-old
could operate the unit.

481
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:33,480
- And what if they don't?
- Well, then we abort.

482
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,748
Either way, I'll have these fighters
back in this hangar by Sunday morning.

483
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,778
Yeah, in how many pieces?

484
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,813
Damn, Arthur.

485
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,528
Men like you
helped to build this country.

486
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,031
And men like me
helped to defend it.

487
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:52,502
Now I'm willing to risk my career
and my life for what I believe in.

488
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:55,130
Come on, Arthur,
take a risk.

489
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:58,198
Cocaine is killing
our country, man.

490
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,369
Wouldn't you like to have a nice story
to tell your grandchildren?

491
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,041
Something more than
beating out other wildcatters,

492
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,073
or finaglin' the bond market?

493
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,108
Wouldn't you?

494
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,649
I'm taking Polaroids.

495
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,719
Not a scratch on those paint jobs.
Are you clear on that, Chap?

496
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,821
I'm clear.
I'm clear.

497
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,827
Hi.

498
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,778
So, uh, how are
we gonna pull this off?

499
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,610
If you mean "we,"
as in you and me,

500
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,377
then you got
the wrong definition of the word.

501
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,644
Oh, wait.
Come on, Chappy.

502
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,777
Excuse me.

503
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:47,781
- You can start contacting your people.
- How long to prepare, Chappy?

504
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,020
We're airborne in 36 hours.

505
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,119
Let's go, guys.

506
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:03,636
I can't even tell
if the systems are compatible, Chappy.

507
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,507
Units were designed for jets.
Traveling at Mach I.

508
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:07,976
We're about to find out.

509
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,003
Commencing approach.

510
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,541
You have to hold the unit
really steady

511
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,576
all the way through
target termination.

512
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,450
She's all yours.

513
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,233
We are gonna
need some seeker heads.

514
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:42,711
Fins too. Couple of other things.

515
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,373
Anna has the list.

516
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,349
- You've a list?
- Hmm.

517
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:52,444
- When do you want this stuff?
- Tonight'll be fine.

518
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,287
If you want miracles,
why don't you call the Pope?

519
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:59,084
SATS. Compliments
of Warren Crawford.

520
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,360
Okay, Anna. Let's take
a real good look at this village.

521
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:06,130
Okay. The guns are concealed
here and here.

522
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,331
There are more guns
hidden in the bushes,

523
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,033
and on the water tower, here.

524
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,934
The village is very close by.

525
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,501
- Hmm.
- That's a bit tight.

526
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,106
But with Anna and her men
in place to direct the lasers,

527
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,013
we should be able
to knock out their artillery

528
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,881
without doing any harm
to the villagers.

529
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:25,047
With bedlam going on there,
and Kleiss' pistols concentrating on us,

530
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,717
Anna should be able to get
the villagers out of that factory.

531
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:32,320
Then, on the second time around,
we bomb their dope.

532
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,796
We each line up
on one target, right?

533
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:38,393
- Correct.
- Piece of cake, old boy.

534
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:41,029
Piece of cake?

535
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,062
I don't want to hear
any more of this.

536
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:45,473
Let's get our gear
stowed, Anna.

537
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,909
We're gonna go.
We're gonna be out of here early.

538
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,542
Oh, by the way, I'm gonna put
a super booster on the P-38.

539
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,352
Strike leader could always
use a little extra power.

540
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,085
Much obliged.

541
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:07,221
All right.
We divide into pairs.

542
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,255
Strike and Wingman.
We cover each other's ass.

543
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,164
Who wants to team with whom?

544
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,327
Leichman?

545
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,930
Well, Nigel chose me last time, so...

546
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,874
it would be impolite
not to return the favor.

547
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,900
Fine.

548
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,504
Sue, that leaves you and me.

549
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:26,141
We've been tangoing
pretty good together.

550
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:34,657
Regret to say...

551
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,652
I cannot go with you
on mission.

552
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,100
Why, Sue?
What's wrong?

553
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,930
I have deceived you.

554
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:54,568
- Deception?
- I'm not famous, Ace.

555
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:55,942
That was my brother.

556
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,847
He died 40 years ago.

557
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:04,916
I served only at the end of war.
Never in combat.

558
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,084
Always in his shadow.

559
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:14,225
I would jeopardize
your safety.

560
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,057
Forgive me.

561
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:24,900
I'm...
very dishonorable man.

562
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:49,693
You're not dishonorable.
You told the truth.

563
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,701
That's a damn hard thing to do.

564
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,001
Thank you.

565
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:05,949
Bloody hell.

566
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,008
I was just getting
fond of the idea.

567
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,987
God damn it, Chappy!
Don't you think we can pull this off?

568
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:14,081
- Just the three of us.
- No.

569
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,227
They told them
these were defective.

570
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:24,393
Said I had to hand carry 'em back
to the manufacturer to work...

571
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,068
the bugs out.

572
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,470
Uh-uh.

573
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,390
- Evening, Sir.
- Sir.

574
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,726
I might as well walk here.
It'd be safer than flying this crate.

575
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,663
Christ, it doesn't even
have a HUD!

576
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,222
Sue'll have you
checked out soon.

577
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,729
If there're any other options,
I'd take them.

578
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,762
If I had a suicide pill,
I'd take it.

579
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,671
Sir, you can't go in there.

580
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,608
That's all right, Sergeant,
thank you.

581
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,481
I followed Ames to Avra.
He and Sinclair got something going on

582
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:13,380
with those antiques fighters.

583
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,113
Those old shit buckets.
They can't be that stupid.

584
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,917
Wings are loaded with ordinance.
They're not planning a charity ball.

585
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,719
Where the hell are they getting
that stuff?

586
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:24,158
Ames, he's stripping our storerooms
of everything that isn't nailed down.

587
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,527
I'll fix that bastard.

588
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,054
- Sergeant.
- Sir?

589
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,090
Get the chief of security
in here.

590
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,000
We'll change our plans.

591
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,473
Take our plane down first thing,
turn around and transship immediately.

592
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,600
Contact our people
at the other bases.

593
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,111
Tell them to be prepared
for accelerated delivery.

594
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,805
Yo, ho-ho. Ha-ha.
Santa Claus is here.

595
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,308
Santa went straight to the ghetto.

596
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,743
Check this out, man. I got enough stuff
in here to outfit a whole army.

597
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:16,905
What is all of this?

598
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:20,610
Well, I took a little green out
of the homeboy's sock, right?

599
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,948
So Anna's dudes got something
to kick a little ass with.

600
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,977
Ha-ha.
Check that out, brother.

601
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:30,415
- So am I in now or what?
- We already discussed this.

602
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,928
No, no.
We ain't discussed nothing.

603
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,124
All right? If the shit hits the fan,
I'll be there.

604
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,099
You could get killed
in that place, boy.

605
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:39,398
Hey, I can get killed in my own
neighborhood, man.

606
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:40,994
It ain't nothing new to that.

607
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:45,372
Look, your personality
just doesn't fit my team profile.

608
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,070
So forget it.

609
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:02,424
Captain, I'll need to see
inside the vehicle.

610
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,368
Fourth of July.

611
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,947
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Chappy.

612
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:32,750
I guess we finally understand
each other, don't we?

613
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,780
Yes, we do.

614
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,160
Chappy...

615
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,329
watch your ass.

616
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:49,835
I always do.

617
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,145
Chappy.

618
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:06,212
Ames was gonna check my laser control.
Now, where the hell is he?

619
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,747
We don't have our full complement
of missiles yet, you know?

620
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,089
Chappy.

621
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:15,531
It's Ames on the phone.
He's in trouble.

622
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,721
Muévanse.

623
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,061
Arranquen.

624
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,401
Muévanse!

625
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,977
I'd better get to a radio
and call them back.

626
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,037
We'll never make it with three aircraft
and half of the ordinance untested.

627
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,628
Suggest we leave.

628
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,431
We're half hour
behind schedule.

629
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,372
Sue, are you sure?

630
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,967
I'm sure, but...

631
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,102
the decision is yours.

632
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:39,104
Perhaps, your lives
will depend on me.

633
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:44,314
- We...
- Would be honored.

634
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,822
- Mamá!
- Ahi va, hijito.

635
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,410
So where are your people?

636
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,519
They'll be here.

637
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,756
(clamoring)

638
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,839
Aah... ooh... aah...
ooh... aah.

639
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:39,973
Ah!

640
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:43,878
My legs! My legs. I can't feel
my legs, they're dead.

641
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,643
- What do you think you're doing?
- What am I doing?

642
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:49,117
Yo, baby, that was my best
Eddie Murphy imitation.

643
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:50,278
Hey, how are you doing?

644
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,914
It's show time.
So let's get busy.

645
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,480
He goes back with you.

646
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:57,015
No way, baby.
We're a team now, huh?

647
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,290
We're like Jazzy Jeff
and the Fresh Prince.

648
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,820
I mean, we're like
Milli and Vanilli.

649
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,595
We're like Michael Jackson
and the Elephant Man's bones.

650
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,192
Yo, are they still together?

651
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:09,364
No, they are not together,
and neither are we.

652
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:12,398
- You're history.
- Oh, let's talk history, baby.

653
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:15,206
Now, if I do recall,
I saved your butt twice.

654
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,076
And I'm trying to save yours.

655
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:19,047
Oh, we don't go dissing me baby.

656
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:24,047
My butt is covered. The rest of your
posse will be happy to have me along.

657
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:26,920
- By the way, where are they?
- Behind you.

658
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,593
Qué bien, aqui están.

659
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:35,758
Damn, homeboys around here
got some bad-ass disguise.

660
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,401
Fernando,
? dónde están los demás?

661
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:45,067
- No vinieron.
- Pero tengo todo listo.

662
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,474
Ya sé,
pero lo aceptaron...

663
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,002
- What's happening?
- ? Cómo?

664
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:54,682
Uh?

665
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,310
Usted dig rap?

666
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,217
You know,
like my name is Tee Vee

667
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:03,715
and I am here to say that I am a rapping
brother and I'm here to stay. Huh!

668
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,284
No?

669
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,922
Let's see.
You got MTV around here?

670
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,362
You got an opinion
on 2 Live Crew?

671
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,903
I guess not.

672
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,074
Hey, where is your posse
going off to?

673
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,639
- Back to their homes.
- Oh, hey. Can I get a rewind on that?

674
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:29,049
Kleiss' security has been increased.

675
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,643
They say we don't have a chance.

676
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,281
Well, I make it a point
to never argue with the locals.

677
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,856
- I have got to roll.
- Make that "we."

678
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:43,264
The party's over. Look, you're crazy if
you think you're going in there alone.

679
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,290
It's much too dangerous.

680
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:55,701
Ordinance?

681
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,578
Check.

682
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,353
Check.

683
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,854
- Check.
- That will do it.

684
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,158
We've got three hours till refuel.

685
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,187
Take it easy.

686
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:17,222
It gets uglier from there on in.

687
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,510
Rápido!

688
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,511
...borregos!

689
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:42,116
- You're pulling out?
- As soon as you're airborne.

690
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,991
Cause for celebration
by the local people, I'm sure.

691
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,692
Oh yes. They'll be having
a special mass.

692
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,600
It'd be most uplifting.

693
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,728
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

694
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:57,467
Make sure
everything's ready to go.

695
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:21,753
A little overkill,
don't you think?

696
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:23,925
- Never hurt Stallone.
- Not so fast.

697
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,321
Maybe I better follow you.

698
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,589
The deposits have been made
just as we agreed.

699
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,954
This final shipment
should be worth another 50 million.

700
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,557
Perhaps more.

701
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,058
Dispersed to bases all over the country
along with the Lethridge surplus.

702
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,129
No questions will ever be asked.

703
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,535
And you are a very rich man.

704
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:08,271
Don't you want
to drink to that?

705
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:11,303
I'll drink to paying back
those bastards in the Pentagon.

706
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,508
I gave them 27 years,
God damn it.

707
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,541
And they closed me down.

708
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,642
We're getting close
to the village.

709
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,040
Here.

710
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:59,088
(Horse whinnies)

711
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,360
Let's go.
We don't have much time.

712
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:24,349
Hold this.

713
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,821
Stay here.

714
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:38,500
(Burro haws)

715
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,041
Shh.

716
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,353
(Burro haws)

717
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:11,891
Cayeron en la trampa.

718
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,060
Manuel, allá.

719
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,354
Aah!

720
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,174
- ! Cuidado, cuidado!
- Está minado el camino.

721
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:36,407
Llévatelo al camión.

722
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,818
Agarra la bolsa.

723
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,516
? Trajiste las bolsas?

724
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,758
Aah!

725
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,933
? Qué pasó, condenada?

726
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:05,277
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

727
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,414
Miras...

728
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,948
Buenota, muy buenota.

729
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,621
(Laughs)

730
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,966
Si te mueves te mato,? Huh?
Te mato.

731
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:31,022
Súbelo.

732
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,797
Siéntese.

733
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,043
We're getting close.

734
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:58,085
Panther One?

735
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:01,153
This is Strike Leader.
Do you copy?

736
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:02,323
Dame el radio.

737
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,993
Panther One?
This is Strike Leader. Do...

738
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,833
Panther One.
This is Strike Leader.

739
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:16,868
Do you copy?
Over.

740
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,211
- Maybe we're still out of range.
- Chappy: Lmpossible.

741
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,478
We're only a half hour
from the target.

742
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:23,508
I'll keep trying.

743
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:26,487
It's dangerous to break radio silence
repeatedly at this point,

744
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,183
isn't it, Chappy?

745
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:29,919
We've got no choice.

746
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:32,359
We're flying blind
without the ground unit.

747
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,565
Panther One, this is
Strike Leader. Come in.

748
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:58,111
Yo, man,
watch the threads.

749
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,221
Jesus.

750
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,953
This is a laser interlock unit
from my base.

751
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:09,526
Sinclair!

752
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:11,726
Patrón, Sector Cinco
interceptó la transmisión

753
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:13,530
de cuatro aviones
en esta dirección.

754
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,969
Sector Five has just
picked up the transmission

755
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:18,371
of four aircraft headed this way.

756
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:19,806
Call lzquitos Airbase.

757
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:22,174
I'm getting airborne!
Get him out of here.

758
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:30,018
Atención, atención.
Estamos en estado de alerta.

759
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,868
Apúrate.

760
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:54,137
Más pronto, ya casi
acabamos con la iglesia.

761
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,269
Mete eso alli.
Eso atrás.

762
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,513
Pronto.

763
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:03,516
Muévanse, muévanse.

764
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:15,622
Bogeys, 10:00 and closing.

765
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,359
Shit.

766
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,958
Gustav?

767
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,094
Aircraft in Peruzco Pass.
Identify.

768
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:22,502
Identify?
Shoot them down.

769
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,062
What do I pay you for?

770
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:25,937
That is Kleiss.

771
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,334
He's pretty good
at buying off pilots...

772
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,346
...split up fast
and pull them in close

773
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,348
where we have the advantage.

774
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:59,039
Bank out of there, Nige.
He's gonna get your ass.

775
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,533
Hardly, old boy! Remember
"the man, not the machine"?

776
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:33,135
Whoa!

777
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,511
Mayday,
Chappy!

778
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,915
Mayday!

779
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,147
Mayday, Chappy.

780
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:47,155
Hang on, Nige.
Hang on.

781
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:50,124
What the bloody hell
does it look like I'm doing?

782
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:12,275
Ohh!

783
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:18,309
Well done, old chap.

784
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:26,918
? Qué me traes aqui?

785
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,259
(Laughing)

786
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:48,950
Ahi les traen la comida.

787
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:12,440
Am I glad to see you?

788
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:14,669
You know, I got tired of hanging around
here all by myself.

789
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,304
You know what? I should just
leave you here, you know that?

790
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,708
Cuida la puerta.

791
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:23,281
Los demás,
vamos conmigo!

792
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:35,293
I hope these things still work.

793
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:36,958
Vamos, a prisa.

794
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,192
Looks like your posse
had a change of heart.

795
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:42,463
Ayúdame.

796
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,435
Vamos, ale, ale!

797
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:50,468
Sue, use your counter measures.

798
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:52,571
Deploy your foil
and get out of there.

799
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,870
Rápidamente.

800
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:26,239
A la linea de fuego.
Rápido.

801
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,615
I'm going to the airport.
You got to keep things moving here!

802
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:30,710
Muévanse.

803
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,530
Yo. Strike Leader,
this is Panther One.

804
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:46,762
We're loose, we got the juice, and we're
ready to blow the shit outta this goose.

805
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,667
Tee Vee, is that you?

806
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:51,195
None other, baby. I flew in
for the surprise party.

807
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,334
- Baggage class.
- Where are you?

808
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,742
We're up in the bell-tower
at the church, man. You should stop by.

809
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:59,475
- We got a beautiful view.
- What about the lasers?

810
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:01,312
Anna's setting them up
as we speak.

811
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:05,248
You better jam, man. Kleiss
is pumping some major drugs

812
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:07,482
into the belly
of a big bird on the runway.

813
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:10,959
Well, line up on the artillery.
We're 20 miles out and closing.

814
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,517
Gotcha.

815
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,961
Dame eso.
Ayúdame.

816
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:18,091
Come on, baby. Get some
big dudes on that sucker.

817
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:19,566
This ain't Pee Wee's
Playhouse.

818
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:22,035
Muévelo.
Despacio.

819
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,505
? Lo miras?
Perfecto.

820
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,642
Leichman?
Panther One is in position.

821
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,167
Can you hold out while me
and Palmer go in for target?

822
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,976
I'm good.
Horikoshi, what about you?

823
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,108
Never better.

824
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,286
(Beeping)

825
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:50,695
(Beeping)

826
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,344
(Alarm sounding)

827
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:19,487
- Ernst, are you all right?
- Yeah, he got the message.

828
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:35,666
So much for your
damn air cover!

829
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:37,508
Get those engines
started now!

830
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:40,014
Get those drums loaded!

831
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:41,879
- Lock them in, now.
- Check.

832
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,009
You hear the man?

833
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,882
There he is!
There he is!

834
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,219
Palmer, take
the northwest gun.

835
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,522
- Fire when you get a lock.
- Roger.

836
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,882
Aah!

837
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:30,297
The bloody tracking unit
isn't working!

838
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,323
Guillermo,
no es tu culpa.

839
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:37,631
We better switch positions.
Leichman?

840
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:39,607
Get down here.

841
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,233
Palmer's laser malfunctioned.

842
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:48,344
Afraid mine has too.
It doesn't even light up.

843
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,754
- Sue, do you read me?
- I'm on my way.

844
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,624
Déjalos, déjalos,
como si fuera su vida, muchachos.

845
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:01,561
Muévete.
Yo disparo.

846
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:03,929
Ahh!

847
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:10,996
Recoge eso!

848
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,472
Muévanse!

849
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:18,140
- Get airborne now!
- Where the hell am I gonna go?

850
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,148
Go to Salvador.
I've friends there.

851
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:24,243
You may lose the flags and the military
bands when you retire,

852
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:26,447
but you won't lose the money.

853
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,115
I need gunners.

854
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:31,625
You! You!
Here.

855
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:39,961
Hold on northwest position
and line up on southwest,

856
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:41,663
- you got it?
- We got it.

857
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,373
Palmer,
are you okay?

858
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:52,176
As I said, technology's no match
for seasoning. We're going back down.

859
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:01,588
Smug bastard!

860
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:17,671
So much for seasoning!

861
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,341
Only one bogey left.

862
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,617
And it looks like we lost Palmer.

863
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,520
Damn it!

864
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:51,462
We're all lined up.

865
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:55,443
We're coming in.

866
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:25,503
Ahh!

867
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:33,147
Yeah!
Woo!

868
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:35,438
Cuidado! No!

869
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:41,013
Asesinos, desgraciados!

870
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:50,025
Line up the southwest gun for Sue.
I'm saving my missiles for the factory.

871
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:52,829
Tell Anna to get her people
out of there and into the church.

872
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:54,267
You copy?

873
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:57,867
We copy, Chappy.
We're lining up now.

874
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:14,581
Manda más hombres enseguida.
Necesitamos ayuda,? Me entiendes?

875
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,080
Ayúdenme, por favor!

876
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:20,185
Ayúdenme, por favor!
Rápido, la mesa!

877
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:23,288
Ahi vienen de nuevo!
Atentos!

878
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:45,511
Ahi viene otro!

879
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:51,790
Ahh!

880
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:54,885
You suckers!

881
01:18:57,365 --> 01:18:58,992
Apúrense todos!

882
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,372
Apúrense.

883
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,434
Rápidamente.

884
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:46,572
Rápido!
Apúrense.

885
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:54,718
Anna's people are doing good.

886
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:56,417
But the trucks
are starting to split.

887
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,289
I think they got
Kleiss' equipment on them.

888
01:19:58,326 --> 01:19:59,486
That's my call.

889
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:06,698
- Corre, corre.
- Auxilio, corran!

890
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:13,064
All right, the big bird
has taken off.

891
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:15,336
Shit.

892
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:19,939
- Sue?
- I would be honored.

893
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,419
Corran a la iglesia!

894
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:34,985
Agárrenlo. Sáquenlo.
Sáquenlo, váyanse, agárrenlo.

895
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:44,338
Okay, Anna's getting
her people into the church.

896
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:48,274
That's perfect. When the church blows,
the Americans will be blamed.

897
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,604
Que lo deje ahi, que lo deje ahi.

898
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:53,136
Ya vuélvanse!

899
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:56,116
You're clear. We're going to get
a line on the factory right now.

900
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:57,880
Tell me when you're set.

901
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:01,822
Take this truck out of here
and put the other one in.

902
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,381
Okay, we got to lock.

903
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,763
- Otro!
- Ahi viene.

904
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:25,402
Al suelo!

905
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:36,487
Air force, baby. When it absolutely,
positively has to be.

906
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,685
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Whoa!

907
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,658
Blow the church!

908
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:46,462
Get the men up
into the mountains.

909
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:53,872
Basta!
Basta, tú.

910
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:03,178
Mayday! Mayday! Kleiss is pulling in
two choppers' worth of backup.

911
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:05,209
We're history.
Let's get out of here.

912
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:08,689
Strike Leader,
this is Warren Crawford.

913
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:10,213
Do you copy?

914
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:13,022
Warren?
Those choppers yours?

915
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:15,723
DEA's finest.

916
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,858
ETA five minutes.

917
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:22,059
Panther One,
these choppers are friendly.

918
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:24,264
Stay put until the DEA
can give you help.

919
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:26,604
Aah. We copy that, baby.

920
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:33,281
Apura, apura.

921
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,681
Damn.
I knew this was too easy.

922
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,218
Va a explotar la iglesia,
sálganse de aqui! Rápido, ya!

923
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:51,824
Vámonos de aqui!

924
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:07,142
Vámonos!

925
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:15,545
Ahh!

926
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,489
Tee Vee, come back!

927
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:29,427
Ahh!

928
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:38,374
Ahh!

929
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,005
Ahh!

930
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:03,335
(Church bell ringing)

931
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:17,247
Tee Vee, are you okay?

932
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:18,775
Nice hat!

933
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:31,693
One more pass.

934
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,325
You take care of it.

935
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:35,835
I'm worried about Sue.

936
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:51,915
Ahh!

937
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:57,922
Get him out of here!

938
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,088
Knock that bastard
out of the sky!

939
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:32,691
Hold your fire.
Hold it!

940
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,340
Chappy.
Kleiss is airborne.

941
01:25:56,384 --> 01:25:58,716
Repeat.
Kleiss has escaped.

942
01:25:58,753 --> 01:25:59,981
What's he flying?

943
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:02,512
It's the weirdest damn jet
I've ever seen.

944
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,684
Guns all over the wings.

945
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:07,194
- Which direction?
- North!

946
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,180
Jackhammer,
this is Wolf Seven.

947
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,285
Come on up,
the skies are clear.

948
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,889
Not quite.

949
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:46,901
Two fighters remain.

950
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:49,768
They're flying shit buckets.
Let them take their best shot.

951
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:55,171
Sue. Come in,
this is Chappy.

952
01:26:57,879 --> 01:26:59,642
Sue.
Pull out!

953
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:04,943
Yaa!

954
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:12,415
Sue!

955
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:15,260
Shit!

956
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:26,871
Good God!
It survived!

957
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:29,638
- What?
- Messerschmitt 263.

958
01:27:29,677 --> 01:27:32,840
The plane that was going
to win the war for Germany.

959
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:35,711
Don't take him on alone.

960
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:39,584
Chappy, I didn't fly
all this way to run.

961
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:51,657
Break it off, Leichman.
I'm 10 seconds out.

962
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:54,827
Leichman?
Is that you, Ernst?

963
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:57,064
You've disgraced
our family's name

964
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:59,096
and you've disgraced
our country.

965
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,630
Huh!

966
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:03,576
One last chance for you
to do something for the Fatherland.

967
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:07,241
You've got that just exactly right.

968
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:36,075
Leichman, bail out!

969
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:57,563
Hardly the Aryan ideal, are you?

970
01:28:57,598 --> 01:29:00,590
Afraid I didn't get a chance
to grab my swastika

971
01:29:00,635 --> 01:29:02,626
and get a lobotomy.

972
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,509
You only have seconds to live.

973
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:44,408
I smell the kill.

974
01:29:44,445 --> 01:29:47,744
What you smell is in your pants.
Take a whiff of this.

975
01:30:11,272 --> 01:30:13,069
Kiss my ass.

976
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:31,122
Damn!

977
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:35,390
Bastard never dies.

978
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:39,159
Warren,
this is Strike Leader.

979
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,191
Kleiss has bailed.

980
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:44,132
We spot him.

981
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:46,538
Dispatching a unit now.

982
01:30:47,575 --> 01:30:49,270
I'm coming in!

983
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:21,832
Can't seem to recall your name.

984
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:23,605
Morales.

985
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:26,809
Like my brother Ramón.

986
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:29,612
But more intelligent, perhaps.

987
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:31,641
What do you want for the jeep?

988
01:31:31,686 --> 01:31:34,655
Six figures? Seven?

989
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:38,181
I don't even talk
about a full tank of gas.

990
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:41,685
Very sensible.

991
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:45,195
I have a lot of friends here,

992
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:47,326
and there are
no extradition treaties with the US.

993
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:04,250
! Qué alegria!

994
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:10,046
You know what movie
they're showing on the way home?

995
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:11,456
You all right?

996
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:13,517
- I'm gonna make it.
- I know you will.

997
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:17,456
Confounded Palmer
is going to haunt me

998
01:32:17,498 --> 01:32:19,830
until I'm an octogenarian.

999
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:21,562
You mean
you found the wreckage?

1000
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:23,570
Not the wreckage...

1001
01:32:23,604 --> 01:32:25,299
Palmer!

1002
01:32:25,339 --> 01:32:28,001
The devil's alive!
Ha-ha!

1003
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,909
(Laughing)

1004
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:36,581
I think this calls
for a celebration, Chappy!

1005
01:32:36,617 --> 01:32:40,383
Yeah. I know
just the place for it.

1006
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:43,990
(Country music playing)

1007
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:46,289
Hey, what's with the Stetson?

1008
01:32:46,327 --> 01:32:49,262
Well, let me tell you, partner,

1009
01:32:49,297 --> 01:32:51,891
I'm switching
from urban to suburban.

1010
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:53,764
Kind of like you,
brother.

1011
01:32:53,801 --> 01:32:55,393
You want to put
these steaks on?

1012
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:56,596
All right.

1013
01:32:56,637 --> 01:32:58,502
And don't burn them
like you did those chops.

1014
01:32:58,539 --> 01:32:59,563
Those aren't burned,

1015
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:02,838
- they're extremely well done.
- Oh, shut up.

1016
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:05,175
- Hey!
(Chappy chuckling)

1017
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:07,704
So, where's Dad and the boys?

1018
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:10,080
They wanted to be here
more than anything to thank you,

1019
01:33:10,117 --> 01:33:11,744
but they knew you'd understand.

1020
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:13,686
We'll never forget
all you've done for us.

1021
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:14,779
Aah.

1022
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:19,353
Oh, the DEA, they wanted
sole credit for the bust

1023
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:22,453
and I wanted all of Kleiss' cash
to go to the villagers.

1024
01:33:22,496 --> 01:33:25,397
So we made a compromise.
They did it my way.

1025
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:26,730
(All chuckling)

1026
01:33:28,903 --> 01:33:31,394
I have something
that I think belongs to you.

1027
01:33:37,912 --> 01:33:39,504
Welcome home.

1028
01:33:41,415 --> 01:33:42,609
Thank you, Anna.

1029
01:33:43,651 --> 01:33:46,211
Well, you know,
I didn't come out so bad either.

1030
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:48,551
The Air Force gave me
a nice little fleet

1031
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:50,887
of moth-balled F-86s
to keep my mouth shut.

1032
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:52,415
Uh-huh.

1033
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:55,725
Leichman and Palmer
are gonna fly them for me next year.

1034
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:57,253
Well...

1035
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:01,132
if we can work out
the percentages.

1036
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:04,501
What about a guest shot from you
next season, Chappy?

1037
01:34:09,276 --> 01:34:11,608
Now that you got your own plane,

1038
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:17,340
What are you gonna call her?

1039
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:19,478
Son of a bitch.

1040
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,249
That's not much of a name.

1041
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:27,516
You know,
I think I'm gonna call her...

1042
01:34:28,896 --> 01:34:32,195
"Shadow Warrior,"
named after Sue.

1043
01:34:43,277 --> 01:34:45,472
Yep, better get 'em
while they're hot!

1044
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:50,508
Get what?
What is that?

1045
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:54,749
- You cook?
- I'll fly the plane! How about that?

1046
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,000
