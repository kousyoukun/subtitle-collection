<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
He was shot down in the Gulf.

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}

Who, who told you that?

261
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:50,144

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
The German called kleiss.

262
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:52,146

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
He's going to kill

266

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I escaped on the plane

here to your base.

267

Yes, they're unloading now.

just a lone eagle.

290
00:21:56,288 --> 00:21:58,288

She's in his quarters.

It may take a while,

485
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:17,523

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
but we will bring
the bastard in.

486
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:19,458
<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
A while?

487
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,827

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
That's a whole lot
of comfort for those
people who are gonna die

488
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:23,495

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
in a couple days.

489

all the time, chappy!

490
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:28,098

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
There's nothing more that
can be done right now!

491
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,167

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Don't you read
the papers, sinclair?

492
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:33,769

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Peru's big on
territorial sovereignty.

they can aim for bogotá

496

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
and end up over lima

the wrong airspace."

498
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:46,313

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
And get back out just as fast.

499
00:36:46,315 --> 00:36:48,648

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I don't believe
I'm hearing this.

I wouldn't involve you, sir.

507
00:37:07,798 --> 00:37:09,831

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
You bet your ass
you're not gonna
involve me!

508
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:12,233

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
You're grounded, sinclair.

509
00:37:12,235 --> 00:37:15,236

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
This morales affair
has screwed all of us.

510
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:17,438

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Whatever your involvement is,

511
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,274

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
bury it along with him.

512
00:37:20,276 --> 00:37:23,310

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Dismissed.

513

( Man speaking Spanish )

514
00:38:09,457 --> 00:38:11,757

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I tried everything, Anna.

515
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:14,192

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
It's important
you understand that.

516
00:38:14,194 --> 00:38:16,227

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
You're everything Ramon
said you were.

517
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:19,230

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
But I've depending
on you too much.

518
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:21,699

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Now I have to do
something myself.

519
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:23,600

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Like what?

520
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:26,302

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
A few men escaped
to another village.

521
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,838

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Maybe we can mount
some kind of attack.

522
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,906

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
With just a few guys?

523
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,441

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I have to try.

524
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:35,743

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
My family's lives are at stake.

525
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:38,612

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
You have to understand that.

Be my guest.

Chappy, just come
to say goodbye.

Well, su has a business to run.

542
00:39:47,007 --> 00:39:49,674

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}

( All chuckle )

545
00:39:54,513 --> 00:39:56,045

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Bottom line is,

546
00:39:56,047 --> 00:39:58,380

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
there's not a lot of call
for arthritic pilots.

547
00:39:58,382 --> 00:40:00,682

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
At least we were all pilots.

548
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:02,684

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Before they
bastardized
the bloody word.

00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:04,686

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Mm, all due respect
to the deceased,
of course.

550
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:06,521

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
The only thing
that was bastardized

551
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:08,155

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
was the way that
this kid went down

552
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:09,990

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
and the way they're
handling this damn thing!

553
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:11,524

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
He was a good pilot.

554
00:40:11,526 --> 00:40:12,791

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Oh, sure, he was, chappy.

555
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:14,159

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I don't mean any offense,

556
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,161

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
but you have to admit
that the kids today

557
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,830

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
do it all with terminals and
monitors and what have you.

558
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:20,832

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Now, as Ernst
is so fond of saying,

559
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,667

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
it used to be about the man...

00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:50,959

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
All krauts weren't
Nazis, you know.

569
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:57,164

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
But this kleiss
was the worst kind.

570
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,533

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
He even killed his brother

571
00:40:59,535 --> 00:41:01,167

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}

573
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:06,005

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
And then he had
the gall to steal

574
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:09,174

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
his dead brother's
medal of honor.

575
00:41:13,446 --> 00:41:15,746

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Well, why not?

576
00:41:15,748 --> 00:41:17,948

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Can't have you yanks and Jerrys

without a representative
of queen and country.

579
00:41:37,901 --> 00:41:41,235

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I would be honored.

Hell, you modified them.

587
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,028

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
What about
air-to-ground ordnance?
These laser units.

588
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,696

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
How do you think
you're gonna get...

589
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,197

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I have a card at the base.

590
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,598

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I can get us
outfitted in a day.

591
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,032

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Anna leaves 12 hours earlier

592
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:21,534

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
and hooks up
with the local
resistance.

593
00:42:21,536 --> 00:42:23,002

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
There's a real comfort.

594
00:42:23,004 --> 00:42:25,537

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
All they've got to do
is line up the lasers

595
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:27,805

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
with the targets and
leave the rest to us.

596
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:30,707

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
If they can get in
there undetected,
a 2-year-old

597
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:31,841

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
can operate the unit.

598
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:32,975

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
And what if they don't?

599
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:34,977

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Well, then we abort.

600
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:37,579

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Either way, I'll
have these fighters
back in this hangar

601

603
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,516

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Damn, Arthur!

604
00:42:43,886 --> 00:42:47,220

606
00:42:49,891 --> 00:42:51,891

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I'm willing to risk my career

607
00:42:51,893 --> 00:42:54,193

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
and my life for
what I believe in.

608
00:42:54,195 --> 00:42:56,662

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>Come on, Arthur, take a risk.</i>

609
00:42:56,664 --> 00:42:58,530

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>Cocaine is killing</i>

610
00:42:58,532 --> 00:42:59,964

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
our country, man.

611
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:01,966

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>Wouldn't you like to have</i>

612
00:43:01,968 --> 00:43:04,101

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>a nice story</i>
<i>to tell your</i>
<i>grandchildren?</i>

613
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:06,803

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Something more than
beating out other
wildcatters

614
00:43:06,805 --> 00:43:09,238

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
or finagling the bond market?

615
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,072

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Wouldn't you?

616
00:43:14,077 --> 00:43:16,577

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I'm taking polaroids.

617
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:19,012

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>Not a scratch</i>
<i>on those paint jobs.</i>

618
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,613

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Are you clear on that, chap?

619
00:43:20,615 --> 00:43:22,615

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I'm clear, I'm clear.

620
00:43:26,954 --> 00:43:29,187

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
( Whistles ) Hi.

621
00:43:34,693 --> 00:43:36,926

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>So, how we gonna pull this off?</i>

622
00:43:36,928 --> 00:43:39,094

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
If you mean "we"
as in you and me,

623
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:41,563

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
then you got the wrong
definition of the word.

624
00:43:41,565 --> 00:43:43,131

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Aw, come on, chappy.

625
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:46,868

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Excuse me.

626
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,703

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Start contacting your people.

627
00:43:48,705 --> 00:43:50,204

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
How long to prepare, chappy?

628
00:43:50,206 --> 00:43:52,039

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Airborne, 36 hours.

629
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,274

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Let's go, guys.

630
00:44:02,617 --> 00:44:05,317

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I can't even tell
if these systems
are compatible, chap.

631
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:07,819

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
The units were
designed for jets
traveling at mach 1.

632
00:44:07,821 --> 00:44:09,754

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Sinclair:
<i>Well, we're about</i>
<i>to find out.</i>

633
00:44:09,756 --> 00:44:11,756

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>Commencing approach.</i>

634
00:44:13,726 --> 00:44:16,259

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
You have to hold
the unit really steady

635
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:18,928

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
all the way through
target termination.

636
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,263

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
She's all yours.

637
00:44:27,938 --> 00:44:30,638

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>( Beeping )</i>

638
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,106

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>( Single beep )</i>

639
00:44:39,114 --> 00:44:41,981

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Gonna need some seeker heads.

640
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:45,684

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>Fins too.</i>
<i>Couple of other things.</i>
<i>Anna has the list.</i>

641
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,152

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
You have a list?

642
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:48,686

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Mmm.

643
00:44:50,723 --> 00:44:52,389

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>When do you want this stuff?</i>

644
00:44:52,391 --> 00:44:54,190

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Tonight will be fine.

645
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,026

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Look, you want
miracles, why don't
you call the pope?

646
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:01,030

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Sats, compliments
of Warren Crawford.

647
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,632

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Okay, Anna,
let's take a real good
look at this village.

648
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,101

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Okay, the guns are concealed

649
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,803

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>here and here.</i>

650
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:12,072

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>There are more guns</i>
<i>hidden in the bushes and</i>
<i>on the water tower here.</i>

651
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:14,741

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
The village is very close by.

652
00:45:14,743 --> 00:45:15,808

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Yes.

653
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,409

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
That's a bit tight,

654
00:45:17,411 --> 00:45:19,778

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
but with Anna and her men
in place to direct the lasers,

655
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,346

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
we should be able to
knock out the artillery

656
00:45:21,348 --> 00:45:23,715

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
without doing any harm
to the villagers.

657
00:45:23,717 --> 00:45:26,651

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
With bedlam going on there
and kleiss' pistols
concentrating on us,

658
00:45:26,653 --> 00:45:29,387

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Anna should be able
to get the villagers
out of that factory.

659
00:45:29,389 --> 00:45:31,822

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Then, on the second
time around...

660
00:45:31,824 --> 00:45:34,057

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
( Fist pounds )
We bomb that dope.

661
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:36,392

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
We each line up
on one target, right?

662
00:45:36,394 --> 00:45:37,760

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Correct.

663
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:40,129

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Piece of cake, old boy.

664
00:45:40,131 --> 00:45:42,131

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Piece of cake?

665
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:45,134

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I don't wanna hear
any more of this.

666
00:45:45,136 --> 00:45:47,136

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Let's get our
gear stowed, Anna.

667
00:45:47,138 --> 00:45:49,671

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
If we're gonna go,
I wanna be out
of here early.

668
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:55,676

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Oh, by the way,

669
00:45:55,678 --> 00:45:58,245

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I'm gonna put
a super-booster
in the p-38.

670
00:45:58,247 --> 00:46:00,046

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>Strike leader</i>

671
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,081

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
could always use
a little extra power.

672
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:03,816

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Much obliged.

673
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,386

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>All right,</i>

674
00:46:07,388 --> 00:46:09,755

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
we divide into pairs,
strike and wingman.

675
00:46:09,757 --> 00:46:11,757

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
We cover each other's ass.

676
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:14,059

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Who wants to team
with who, leichman?

677
00:46:14,061 --> 00:46:17,228

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Well, Nigel chose me last time,

678
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,930

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
so it would be impolite not to

679
00:46:19,932 --> 00:46:21,431

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
return the favor.

680
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:22,799

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Fine.

681
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:25,802

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Su, that leaves you and me.

682
00:46:25,804 --> 00:46:28,437

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
We've been tangoing
pretty good together.

683
00:46:34,177 --> 00:46:37,411

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Regret to say...

684
00:46:37,413 --> 00:46:40,847

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I cannot go with you

685
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:42,882

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>on mission.</i>

686
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,718

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Why, su?

687
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,720

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
What's wrong?

688
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,756

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I have deceived you.

689
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:53,725

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Deception?

690
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,727

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I'm not famous ace.

691
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,762

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
That was my brother.

692
00:46:57,764 --> 00:47:01,398

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
He died 40 years ago.

693
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,235

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I served, but only
at the end of war.

694
00:47:05,237 --> 00:47:07,237

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Never in combat.

695
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:10,072

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Always in his shadow.

696
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:16,010

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I would jeopardize your safety.

697
00:47:16,012 --> 00:47:19,179

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Forgive me.

698
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:26,785

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I'm very dishonorable man.

699
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,907

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
You're not dishonorable.

700
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,909

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
You told the truth.

701
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:54,778

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
That's a damn hard thing to do.

702
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,080

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Thank you.

703
00:48:04,822 --> 00:48:06,822

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Palmer:
<i>Bloody hell...</i>

704
00:48:06,824 --> 00:48:09,457

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I was just getting
fond of the idea.

705
00:48:09,459 --> 00:48:11,459

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
God damn it, chappy!

706
00:48:11,461 --> 00:48:13,828

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Don't you think we
can pull this off?

707
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,296

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>Just the three of us.</i>

708
00:48:15,298 --> 00:48:17,164

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Nah.

709
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:21,934

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I told 'em these
were defective.

710
00:48:21,936 --> 00:48:24,903

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Said I had to hand
carry them back to

711
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:26,570

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
the manufacturer to work the...

712
00:48:29,341 --> 00:48:31,574

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
bugs out.

713
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:36,111
<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

714
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,193

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
'Evening, sir.

715
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:53,028

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I might as well walk there.

716
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,629

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
It'd be safer than
flying this crate.

717
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,430

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Christ, it doesn't
even have a hood.

718
00:48:56,432 --> 00:48:58,098

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Su will have you
checked out soon.

719
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,468

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
If there were any other
options, I'd take them.

720
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:04,504

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
If I had a suicide pill,
I'd take it.

721
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:06,072

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Woman:
<i>Sir, you can't</i>
<i>go in there!</i>

722
00:49:06,074 --> 00:49:07,373

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
That's all right, sergeant.

723
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:09,208

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Thank you.

724
00:49:10,411 --> 00:49:12,544

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I followed ames.

725
00:49:12,546 --> 00:49:15,213

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
He and sinclair got
something going on with
those antique fighters.

726
00:49:15,215 --> 00:49:17,949

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Those old shit buckets?
They can't be that stupid.

727
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:19,317

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Wings are loaded with ordnance.

( Imitating John Wayne )

1217
01:32:48,945 --> 01:32:51,278

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
"Well, let me
tell ya, pardner..."

1218
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:53,280

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I'm switching from
urban to suburban.

1219
01:32:53,282 --> 01:32:55,282

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Kind of like you, brother.

1220
01:32:55,284 --> 01:32:57,117

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Well, put these steaks on.

1221
01:32:57,119 --> 01:32:58,785

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
All righty.

1222
01:32:58,787 --> 01:33:00,787

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
And don't burn them
like you did those chops.

1223
01:33:00,789 --> 01:33:02,655

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Those aren't burned, they're...

1224
01:33:02,657 --> 01:33:04,657

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
- Aw, shut up.
- ...Extremely
well done.

1225
01:33:04,659 --> 01:33:06,158

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Hey!

1226
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,826

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
( Laughs )

1227
01:33:07,828 --> 01:33:09,828

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
So, where's dad and the boys?

1228
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:11,863

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
They wanted to
be here more than
anything to thank you,

1229
01:33:11,865 --> 01:33:13,698

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
but they knew you'd understand.

1230
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:15,299

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
We'll never forget
all you've done for us.

1231
01:33:15,301 --> 01:33:16,700

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Sinclair:
<i>Ahh...</i>

1232

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Leichman:
<i>Hmm?</i>

1233
01:33:18,036 --> 01:33:19,568

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Well, the DEA,

1234
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:21,570

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
they wanted sole
credit for the bust

1235
01:33:21,572 --> 01:33:24,039

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
and I wanted all of kleiss'
cash to go to the villagers.

1236
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:27,075

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
So, we made a compromise.
They did it my way.

1237
01:33:27,077 --> 01:33:29,877

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
( All laughing )

1238
01:33:29,879 --> 01:33:33,847

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Anna:
<i>I have something that</i>
<i>I think belongs to you.</i>

1239
01:33:39,654 --> 01:33:41,754

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Welcome home.

1240
01:33:43,657 --> 01:33:45,289

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Thank you, Anna.

1241
01:33:45,291 --> 01:33:47,958

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Well, you know, I didn't
come out so bad either.

1242
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,260

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
The air force gave me
a nice little fleet

1243
01:33:50,262 --> 01:33:52,695

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
of mothballed f-86s
to keep my mouth shut.

1244
01:33:52,697 --> 01:33:54,129

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Ah-ha!

1245
01:33:54,131 --> 01:33:56,631

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Leichman and Palmer are gonna

1246
01:33:56,633 --> 01:33:58,265

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
<i>fly 'em for me next year.</i>

1247
01:33:58,267 --> 01:34:00,267

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Uh, well...

1248
01:34:00,269 --> 01:34:02,869

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
If we can work out
the percentages.

1249
01:34:02,871 --> 01:34:06,138

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Stockman:
<i>What about a guest shot from</i>
<i>you next season, chappy?</i>

1250
01:34:10,877 --> 01:34:13,210

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Now that you got
your own plane.

1251
01:34:17,583 --> 01:34:19,082

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
What are you gonna call her?

1252
01:34:19,084 --> 01:34:21,184

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Son of a bitch.

1253
01:34:21,186 --> 01:34:23,920

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
That's not much of a name.

1254
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:29,224

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
You know, I think
I'm gonna call her

1255
01:34:29,226 --> 01:34:33,861

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
shadow warrior, named after su.

1256

1257
01:34:44,738 --> 01:34:47,738

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
Yep, better get 'em
while they're hot.

1258
01:34:50,743 --> 01:34:53,210

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
( All clamoring and laughing )

1259
01:34:53,212 --> 01:34:54,661

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
You cook?

1260
01:34:54,662 --> 01:34:56,111

<font color=yellow>{\fnArial\fs24}
I'll fly the plane.
How about that?
