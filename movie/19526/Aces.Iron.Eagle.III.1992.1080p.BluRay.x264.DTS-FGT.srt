1
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,006
I want more trucks, more jeeps,

2
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,881
and 50 more armed guards.

3
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,850
We move again so soon?

4
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,686
A small incident has transpired.

5
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,475
The DEA may become bothersome.

6
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,722
So, why take the risk?

7
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,690
We simply move higher up
into the mountains.

8
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,615
Ask the mayor
when we will finish

9
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,614
packaging this consignment.

10
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,546
He says, "very quickly,
perhaps two days."

11
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,760
But he pleads with you
to release

12
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,755
his daughter.

13
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,759
Tell him unless he gets
back to work quickly,

14
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,762
I will kill his daughter
in front of him.

15
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,028
Up in the mountains, good
workers are hard to find.

16
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,531
Maybe this time,
we should take the loss.

17
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,033
Impossible. They've seen the
markings on the planes.

18
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,410
No, these people have served

19
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,412
this land well, Juanito.

20
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:49,007
In five days' time, we
shall bury them in it.

21
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,388
Flight commander findlay,
report to operations.

22
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,069
Coast guard find the body too?

23
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,072
Most of it. The medics
are doing an autopsy.

24
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,075
His personal things
are over here.

25
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,802
Do you know these
people, colonel?

26
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,176
I didn't catch your name.

27
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,143
Oh, I'm Warren Crawford.

28
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,025
That's his family.

29
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,614
Kid brothers, dad, sister.

30
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,824
She went to ucla on

31
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,944
an athletic scholarship.

32
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,661
This picture was taken
the day she graduated.

33
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,747
He's from a little village

34
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,787
in the Peruvian mountains.

35
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,127
His father's the mayor.

36
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,871
He has an aunt living
here in brownsville,

37
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,123
but that's all in your files.

38
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,499
Anybody tell her?

39
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,501
She's been informed.

40
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,003
Uh, poor people, aren't they?

41
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,597
Very poor.

42
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,759
Had to work their butts off

43
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,768
to make something of themselves.

44
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,765
We think he was shot down by
the Colombian cocaine cartels.

45
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,267
They had to get to one
of us sooner or later.

46
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,894
We're out there tracking
them all the time.

47
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,897
Morales was in
competition with them.

48
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,899
They don't like that.

49
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,151
What the hell's that supposed to mean?!
Who are you?

50
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,700
I'm the station chief,
DEA, Houston.

51
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,618
Chappy,

52
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,789
I think you better take a look
at his auxiliary fuel tank.

53
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,132
Damn! I don't believe this.

54
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,885
Where's his flight recorder?
Who was with him?

55
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,227
I was, colonel.

56
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,142
Just a routine
interdiction mission.

57
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,140
Over sector seven,
he said he had orders

58
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,142
from you to fly
a classified pattern.

59
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,144
We would rendezvous
one hour after break-off.

60
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,612
I never gave those orders.

61
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,649
I wouldn't know about that, sir.

62
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,651
He broke off over the Yucatan.

63
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,653
I got his mayday
45 minutes later.

64
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,825
By the time I got there,

65
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,575
there was nothing
but wreckage, sir.

66
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,917
Gulfsat confirm this?

67
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,037
They were all flying
for ev tests.

68
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:36,041
DEA intends to run a full
investigation on this, colonel.

69
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,917
We'll want to talk
to you again, so...

70
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,671
The DEA isn't running any full
investigations on my command!

71
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,799
And it's god damn well not gonna
harass any of my senior officers!

72
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,641
Well, sir, there's no way

73
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,556
morales was operating alone,

74
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,556
not with a quarter of a billion
worth of cocaine in his tank.

75
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,182
Maybe, maybe not,
but this kind of scandal

76
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,684
makes headlines
the Pentagon doesn't like

77
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,687
one damn bit!

78
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,155
The services prefer to clean
their own houses, Mr. Crawford.

79
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,901
I'll launch my own little
look-see into this matter.

80
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,197
Excuse me, sir,
but DEA does have

81
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,036
jurisdiction on this case.

82
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,156
You're on a military
installation, son!

83
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,001
The only thing that has
jurisdiction around here

84
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,995
is the star on my shoulder.

85
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,622
Take your people
back to Houston,

86
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,749
and I'll see you
get a full report.

87
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,217
You're late!

88
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,059
We're clear.

89
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,600
Gulfsat reports that DEA
is tightening surveillance

90
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,815
on fighter aircraft
in the entire area.

91
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,809
Your moment of madness
could have placed

92
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,811
the entire
operation in jeopardy.

93
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,687
I had no choice.
Morales was running scared.

94
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,735
He threatened to go
to colonel sinclair.

95
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,031
Just as well I have a contingency
plan, isn't it, captain?

96
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,994
Give me the code numbers.

97
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,832
Lima-Romeo-654.

98
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,826
They have to touch down by 0500.

99
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,712
Escovez!

100
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,716
The jackhammer flight leaves
for lethridge at midnight.

101
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,718
We must begin
loading immediately.

102
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,186
Use all available personnel.

103
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,397
But then his number came up

104
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,732
and he was gone with the draft

105
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,022
he's in the army now

106
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,316
a-blowin' reveille

107
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,315
he's the boogie woogie

108
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,318
hip-hop boy of company b.

109
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,866
Give me a blazing sun,

110
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,165
the occasional

111
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,163
cloud for cover,

112
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,790
and I'll shoot the ass off
of any aircraft flying.

113
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,669
Well, maybe next year
Arthur will send you up

114
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,796
against an f-16 or a mirage.

115
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,423
Call it the battle of
the generation gap.

116
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,892
Ach! Flying computers, captain.

117
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,854
In our day, it used to be
the man, not the machine.

118
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,098
Technology is no match
for seasoning.

119
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,101
Damn shame you missed it, chap.

120
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,103
Well, don't hold
my youth against me.

121
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,105
By the time I was
old enough to join up,

122
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,152
there was nothing but
missiles and mach speed.

123
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,912
Very fine beer.

124
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,756
May have to import it
for company cafeteria.

125
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,750
I was told you worked
for an aerospace firm,

126
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,753
but I didn't fancy
you were its caterer.

127
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,254
He's chairman of the board.

128
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,384
What do you say we press
a little flesh, gentlemen?

129
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,932
You know, mix and mingle.
Work the crowd.

130
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,396
You know, this little
party could line us up

131
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,062
some real supporters
for next year's show.

132
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,934
Well, count me out.

133
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,561
When I retire,
I'm gonna buy myself

134
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,404
a little ranch
and a big hammock.

135
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,774
I'm gonna sit around
all day working on my tan.

136
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,529
10 will get you 20
that will last about a week.

137
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,918
When this batch is dry, use these
people to help with the packaging.

138
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,537
Five kilos in each barrel, yes?

139
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,089
Ahh!

140
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,659
Come on, move it!

141
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,161
Finish loading and you're gone.

142
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,787
Nobody's gonna
stop you at the gate.

143
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,239
Ohl

144
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,338
Ohl

145
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,095
You're Anna morales.

146
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,181
Ramon's sister.

147
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:07,177
What the hell happened to you?

148
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,850
I need to find my brother.
Where is he?

149
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,732
Anna, I'm chappy sinclair,
Ramon's friend.

150
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,101
There's something
I need to tell you.

151
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,228
There's no time to talk.
I need to find my brother.

152
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,355
My whole village and
family's in danger.

153
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,864
Ramon is dead.

154
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,820
He was shot down in the Gulf.

155
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,243
He was carrying
cocaine in his tanks.

156
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,208
Ramon!

157
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,677
They told Ramon
they'd kill us all

158
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,512
if he didn't help them.

159
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,258
Who, who told you that?

160
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,136
The German called kleiss.

161
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,138
He's going to kill
everyone in four days.

162
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,764
- My family, everyone!
- Slow down.

163
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,767
Slow down, slow down.

164
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,237
Now, how did you get here?

165
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,233
I escaped on the plane that brought
the drugs here to your base.

166
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,532
Drugs are being brought
here to this base?

167
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,871
Yes, they're unloading now.
They're in the barrels.

168
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,411
Kleiss called it the jackhammer
flight to lethridge.

169
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,379
Gimme the key.

170
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,216
You stay right here. I'll
be back as fast as I can.

171
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,584
You keep this door locked.

172
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,426
You don't open this
door for anyone.

173
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,479
Hold it!

174
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,522
Hold it!

175
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,659
Hold it! Stop right there!

176
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,207
Let me see your orders.

177
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,875
What are you bringing in?

178
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,875
Hydraulic fluid, sir. A milk run.
Next stop, San Diego.

179
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,719
This plane ain't stopping nowhere
until I see what's in those barrels.

180
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,713
- Get me a crowbar.
- Yes, sir.

181
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,311
Don't just stand there.

182
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,901
Get another crowbar and open
up the rest of those barrels.

183
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,418
What's going on here, colonel?

184
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,877
I think there's drugs
in this plane, sir.

185
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,507
The DEA was right. Morales
wasn't just a lone eagle.

186
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:54,261
Off-load the rest of this
cargo and have it checked.

187
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,262
Where are you getting your
information, colonel?

188
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,264
Morales' sister.
She's in his quarters.

189
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,482
She'll lay the whole
thing out for you.

190
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,232
It's all right, Anna.

191
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,234
It's chappy sinclair.

192
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,904
Anna?

193
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,915
Anna?

194
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,671
She's gone.

195
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,425
Why don't you take a little
water with your booze,

196
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,891
colonel?

197
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,728
But she was here,
general, I swear.

198
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,723
This base is going to
close in three weeks.

199
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,725
My base for 12 years.

200
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,442
My men, my planes,

201
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,311
my equipment transferred to

202
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,029
other commands
all over this country.

203
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,695
I want to go out
with honor, colonel.

204
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,694
I don't want
a trumped-up scandal

205
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,411
and I don't want

206
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,871
gossip and talk!

207
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,706
Have you got that?!

208
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,917
Yes, general, I've got that.
