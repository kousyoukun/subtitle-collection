3
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,513
They're off, ladies and
gentlemen! There they go!

4
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,357
Classic world war ii aircraft!

5
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,522
The axis vs. The allies!

6
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:38,522
The spitfire of capt. Nigel Palmer vs.
The messerschmitt

7
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,275
of major Ernst leichman!

8
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,198
And Japan's
jiro horikoshi in the zero

9
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,533
vs. Our own colonel
"chappy" sinclair

10
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,827
in the p-38 lightning!

11
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,789
Hello.

12
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,460
Hey, I wouldn't have thought you
had the power for a snap roll.

13
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:59,301
Stockman has goosed it up a bit and
added a few other little goodies.

14
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,386
Still, no match for
the spit, I'm afraid.

15
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,597
Her guns have been
updated by dassault

16
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,559
and her snout's been re-engined
by Rolls-Royce. - Oh, really?

17
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,225
Well, don't look now, but her butt
is about to be reamed by lockheed.

18
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,314
You read and countered so soon.

19
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,563
Ha, looky here. It looks
like Tokyo is hot to trot.

20
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,538
It appears your shooter had
a case of premature ejection.

21
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,876
Very unusual maneuver.

22
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,870
Don't you remember?

23
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,621
Zeros were famous
for it over midway

24
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,249
and p-51s used to counter
with this move.

25
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,527
Whoo! Ha-ha!

26
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,538
Another spectacular victory
for colonel "chappy" sinclair.

27
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:18,004
There's colonel jiro horikoshi
acknowledging defeat.

28
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,500
Let's hear it for
the red, white and blue!

29
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,593
And now the spitfire

30
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,388
battle of britain
pilot Nigel Palmer

31
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,556
vs. Germany's Ernst leichman,
flying the messerschmitt 109!

32
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,555
Reenact the life and death

33
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,399
struggle above england
in the 1940s.

34
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,563
They're begging for a
spectacle, you bloody kraut!

35
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,812
Let's give them one.

36
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,563
All right, limey!

37
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,493
Mind your elbows, mein herr.

38
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,363
By the looks of this,

39
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,205
it could be a close one.
Hold onto your hats!

40
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,879
Those boys are gonna

41
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,424
give me a heart attack!

42
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,921
Ladies and gentlemen, I swear,

43
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,764
I didn't know
they were gonna do that.

44
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,270
Chock up another kill
for major Ernst leichman.

45
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,017
Tomorrow is our

46
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,395
last show of the season,
ladies and gentlemen.

47
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,944
The axis and the allies
fly again.

48
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,943
Really hope y'all can join us.

49
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,993
We still have a few tickets for
tonight's end-of-season party.

50
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,411
Your chance to meet
the aces, so hurry.

51
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,411
Now don't go committing
harakiri, su.

52
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,037
You'll get me next time.

53
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,040
No, you are too pretty to die.

54
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,464
Excuse me.

55
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,961
- Colonel?
- Yep.

56
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,056
Ramon morales just
crashed in the Gulf.

57
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,595
Is he all right?

58
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,888
He's dead, chappy.

59
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,887
Dead?

60
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,310
When, how?

61
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,899
I don't know. All I
know is a whole bunch

62
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,689
of suits just
flew in from Houston.

63
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,484
General Simms wants you
back on the base, now.

64
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:13,863
Su, you tell stockman that
there's been an accident.

65
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,080
I'll try and be back tonight.

66
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,006
I want more trucks, more jeeps,

67
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,881
and 50 more armed guards.

68
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,850
We move again so soon?

69
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,686
A small incident has transpired.

70
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,475
The DEA may become bothersome.

71
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,722
So, why take the risk?

72
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,690
We simply move higher up
into the mountains.

73
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,615
Ask the mayor
when we will finish

74
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,614
packaging this consignment.

75
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,546
He says, "very quickly,
perhaps two days."

76
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,760
But he pleads with you
to release

77
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,755
his daughter.

78
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,759
Tell him unless he gets
back to work quickly,

79
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,762
I will kill his daughter
in front of him.

80
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,028
Up in the mountains, good
workers are hard to find.

81
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,531
Maybe this time,
we should take the loss.

82
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,033
Impossible. They've seen the
markings on the planes.

83
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,410
No, these people have served

84
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,412
this land well, Juanito.

85
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:49,007
In five days' time, we
shall bury them in it.

86
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,388
Flight commander findlay,
report to operations.

87
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,069
Coast guard find the body too?

88
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,072
Most of it. The medics
are doing an autopsy.

89
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,075
His personal things
are over here.

90
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,802
Do you know these
people, colonel?

91
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,176
I didn't catch your name.

92
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,143
Oh, I'm Warren Crawford.

93
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,025
That's his family.

94
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,614
Kid brothers, dad, sister.

95
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,824
She went to ucla on

96
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,944
an athletic scholarship.

97
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,661
This picture was taken
the day she graduated.

98
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,747
He's from a little village

99
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,787
in the Peruvian mountains.

100
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,127
His father's the mayor.

101
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,871
He has an aunt living
here in brownsville,

102
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,123
but that's all in your files.

103
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,499
Anybody tell her?

104
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,501
She's been informed.

105
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,003
Uh, poor people, aren't they?

106
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,597
Very poor.

107
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,759
Had to work their butts off

108
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,768
to make something of themselves.

109
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,765
We think he was shot down by
the Colombian cocaine cartels.

110
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,267
They had to get to one
of us sooner or later.

111
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,894
We're out there tracking
them all the time.

112
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,897
Morales was in
competition with them.

113
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,899
They don't like that.

114
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,151
What the hell's that supposed to mean?!
Who are you?

115
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,700
I'm the station chief,
DEA, Houston.

116
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,618
Chappy,

117
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,789
I think you better take a look
at his auxiliary fuel tank.

118
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,132
Damn! I don't believe this.

119
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,885
Where's his flight recorder?
Who was with him?

120
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,227
I was, colonel.

121
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,142
Just a routine
interdiction mission.

122
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,140
Over sector seven,
he said he had orders

123
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,142
from you to fly
a classified pattern.

124
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,144
We would rendezvous
one hour after break-off.

125
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,612
I never gave those orders.

126
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,649
I wouldn't know about that, sir.

127
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,651
He broke off over the Yucatan.

128
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,653
I got his mayday
45 minutes later.

129
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,825
By the time I got there,

130
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,575
there was nothing
but wreckage, sir.

131
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,917
Gulfsat confirm this?

132
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,037
They were all flying
for ev tests.

133
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:36,041
DEA intends to run a full
investigation on this, colonel.

134
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,917
We'll want to talk
to you again, so...

135
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,671
The DEA isn't running any full
investigations on my command!

136
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,799
And it's god damn well not gonna
harass any of my senior officers!

137
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,641
Well, sir, there's no way

138
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,556
morales was operating alone,

139
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,556
not with a quarter of a billion
worth of cocaine in his tank.

140
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,182
Maybe, maybe not,
but this kind of scandal

141
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,684
makes headlines
the Pentagon doesn't like

142
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,687
one damn bit!

143
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,155
The services prefer to clean
their own houses, Mr. Crawford.

144
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,901
I'll launch my own little
look-see into this matter.

145
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,197
Excuse me, sir,
but DEA does have

146
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,036
jurisdiction on this case.

147
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,156
You're on a military
installation, son!

148
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,001
The only thing that has
jurisdiction around here

149
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,995
is the star on my shoulder.

150
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,622
Take your people
back to Houston,

151
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,749
and I'll see you
get a full report.

152
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,217
You're late!

153
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,059
We're clear.

154
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,600
Gulfsat reports that DEA
is tightening surveillance

155
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,815
on fighter aircraft
in the entire area.

156
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,809
Your moment of madness
could have placed

157
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,811
the entire
operation in jeopardy.

158
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,687
I had no choice.
Morales was running scared.

159
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,735
He threatened to go
to colonel sinclair.

160
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,031
Just as well I have a contingency
plan, isn't it, captain?

161
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,994
Give me the code numbers.

162
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,832
Lima-Romeo-654.

163
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,826
They have to touch down by 0500.

164
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,712
Escovez!

165
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,716
The jackhammer flight leaves
for lethridge at midnight.

166
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,718
We must begin
loading immediately.

167
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,186
Use all available personnel.

168
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,397
But then his number came up

169
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,732
and he was gone with the draft

170
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,022
he's in the army now

171
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,316
a-blowin' reveille

172
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,315
he's the boogie woogie

173
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,318
hip-hop boy of company b.

174
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,866
Give me a blazing sun,

175
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,165
the occasional

176
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,163
cloud for cover,

177
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,790
and I'll shoot the ass off
of any aircraft flying.

178
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,669
Well, maybe next year
Arthur will send you up

179
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,796
against an f-16 or a mirage.

180
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,423
Call it the battle of
the generation gap.

181
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,892
Ach! Flying computers, captain.

182
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,854
In our day, it used to be
the man, not the machine.

183
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,098
Technology is no match
for seasoning.

184
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,101
Damn shame you missed it, chap.

185
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,103
Well, don't hold
my youth against me.

186
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,105
By the time I was
old enough to join up,

187
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,152
there was nothing but
missiles and mach speed.

188
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,912
Very fine beer.

189
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,756
May have to import it
for company cafeteria.

190
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,750
I was told you worked
for an aerospace firm,

191
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,753
but I didn't fancy
you were its caterer.

192
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,254
He's chairman of the board.

193
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,384
What do you say we press
a little flesh, gentlemen?

194
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,932
You know, mix and mingle.
Work the crowd.

195
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,396
You know, this little
party could line us up

196
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,062
some real supporters
for next year's show.

197
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,934
Well, count me out.

198
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,561
When I retire,
I'm gonna buy myself

199
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,404
a little ranch
and a big hammock.

200
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,774
I'm gonna sit around
all day working on my tan.

201
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,529
10 will get you 20
that will last about a week.

202
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,918
When this batch is dry, use these
people to help with the packaging.

203
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,537
Five kilos in each barrel, yes?

204
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,089
Ahh!

205
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,659
Come on, move it!

206
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,161
Finish loading and you're gone.

207
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,787
Nobody's gonna
stop you at the gate.

208
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,239
Ohl

209
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,338
Ohl

210
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,095
You're Anna morales.

211
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,181
Ramon's sister.

212
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:07,177
What the hell happened to you?

213
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,850
I need to find my brother.
Where is he?

214
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,732
Anna, I'm chappy sinclair,
Ramon's friend.

215
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,101
There's something
I need to tell you.

216
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,228
There's no time to talk.
I need to find my brother.

217
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,355
My whole village and
family's in danger.

218
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,864
Ramon is dead.

219
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,820
He was shot down in the Gulf.

220
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,243
He was carrying
cocaine in his tanks.

221
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,208
Ramon!

222
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,677
They told Ramon
they'd kill us all

223
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,512
if he didn't help them.

224
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,258
Who, who told you that?

225
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,136
The German called kleiss.

226
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,138
He's going to kill
everyone in four days.

227
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,764
- My family, everyone!
- Slow down.

228
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,767
Slow down, slow down.

229
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,237
Now, how did you get here?

230
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,233
I escaped on the plane that brought
the drugs here to your base.

231
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,532
Drugs are being brought
here to this base?

232
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,871
Yes, they're unloading now.
They're in the barrels.

233
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,411
Kleiss called it the jackhammer
flight to lethridge.

234
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,379
Gimme the key.

235
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,216
You stay right here. I'll
be back as fast as I can.

236
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,584
You keep this door locked.

237
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,426
You don't open this
door for anyone.

238
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,479
Hold it!

239
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,522
Hold it!

240
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,659
Hold it! Stop right there!

241
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,207
Let me see your orders.

242
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,875
What are you bringing in?

243
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,875
Hydraulic fluid, sir. A milk run.
Next stop, San Diego.

244
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,719
This plane ain't stopping nowhere
until I see what's in those barrels.

245
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,713
- Get me a crowbar.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,311
Don't just stand there.

247
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,901
Get another crowbar and open
up the rest of those barrels.

248
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,418
What's going on here, colonel?

249
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,877
I think there's drugs
in this plane, sir.

250
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,507
The DEA was right. Morales
wasn't just a lone eagle.

251
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:54,261
Off-load the rest of this
cargo and have it checked.

252
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,262
Where are you getting your
information, colonel?

253
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,264
Morales' sister.
She's in his quarters.

254
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,482
She'll lay the whole
thing out for you.

255
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,232
It's all right, Anna.

256
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,234
It's chappy sinclair.

257
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,904
Anna?

258
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,915
Anna?

259
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,671
She's gone.

260
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,425
Why don't you take a little
water with your booze,

261
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,891
colonel?

262
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,728
But she was here,
general, I swear.

263
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,723
This base is going to
close in three weeks.

264
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,725
My base for 12 years.

265
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,442
My men, my planes,

266
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,311
my equipment transferred to

267
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,029
other commands
all over this country.

268
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,695
I want to go out
with honor, colonel.

269
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,694
I don't want
a trumped-up scandal

270
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,411
and I don't want

271
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,871
gossip and talk!

272
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,706
Have you got that?!

273
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,917
Yes, general, I've got that.

274
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,575
How do I know

275
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,578
that you're not running
a line of bullshit

276
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,580
just to save your
own ass, colonel?

277
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,923
You don't, until
I find the girl.

278
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,714
This guy kleiss
she talked about.

279
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,712
Does he mean anything to you?

280
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,556
Gustav kleiss has been on
the feds' books for years,

281
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,551
dealing arms, heroin, chemical
weapons in the middle east.

282
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,052
He uses the money

283
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,851
to finance hate groups
all over the world.

284
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,849
Did he get any
information from Peru?

285
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,397
That's not such an easy
thing to do, colonel.

286
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,816
You know how much corruption
there is down there?

287
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,404
These are poor countries

288
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,739
surviving on narco-bucks.

289
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,028
They don't want
to hear from DEA.

290
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,745
What about this jackhammer?

291
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,739
I'll tell you what.

292
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,412
You get her to pinpoint

293
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:26,003
the location of kleiss and
I'll see what I can do.

294
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,842
Well, she's got an aunt in brownsville.
Maybe she's there.

295
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,585
Now, that's a
rough neighborhood.

296
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,882
You watch your ass, colonel.

297
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,051
Always do.

298
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,111
Want some action?

299
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,606
Aw, come on.

300
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,891
Excuse me, this 3157

301
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,893
lotto game was
last night, brother.

302
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,580
Mrs. del prado?

303
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,078
Si.

304
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,546
I'm colonel sinclair.

305
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,836
Please, please,
I must speak with Anna.

306
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,180
Wait! Annal

307
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,175
I just wanna talk to you!

308
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,852
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey!

309
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,770
I'm getting too old
for this shit!

310
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,518
Hey, don't...

311
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,778
What kind of shit you
looking for, lady... blow?

312
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,496
Ahh!

313
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,124
Ah-ah...

314
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,871
Put it down, now.

315
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,719
See, these homeboys
don't dig any

316
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,718
piece carrying by nonmembers.

317
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,971
Now, baby, you wanna
leave it to brother,

318
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,980
or you wanna stick around here?

319
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,982
Leave, thanks.

320
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,740
Hey, maybe you
should just say no.

321
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,573
I owe you one.

322
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,243
You better start trusting me.

323
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,085
How can I?

324
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,250
A soldier came to arrest
me after you left Ramon's.

325
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,590
A soldier? Did you see his face?

326
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,434
Just his gun. Ran out the
back and I came here.

327
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,926
There's nothing
you can do alone.

328
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,144
I've been to the DEA and
they're willing to help.

329
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,732
I need for you to point out the
exact location of kleiss' setup.

330
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,020
It has to be accurate. Do
you think you can do that?

331
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,359
I think so.

332
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,853
Great.

333
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,105
But I'll need a little time.

334
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,027
All right, I've gotta go fly.

335
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,320
It's something I have to do.
I'll be back soon.

336
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,741
Look, everything is
going to be okay.

337
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,660
But no more running out,
all right?

338
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,284
No more running out.

339
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,642
Hey, boy...

340
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,637
$50, you keep an
eye on the girl.

341
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,309
Deal?

342
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,308
Deal.

343
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,175
Put that shit back in the Van.

344
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,677
I'm paying a house call today.

345
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,680
Cover my ass, comprende?

346
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,682
Comprende.

347
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,146
Thank you, Jesus.

348
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,752
All right, you can bring them down now.
Chappy's here.

349
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,846
Oh...

350
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,859
Let me know if the
old lady comes back.

351
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,923
Uh! Oof!

352
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,123
Bitch!

353
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,867
Ohl

354
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,547
Now get your ass in the bedroom!

355
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,914
I told you to stay outside.

356
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,374
You can't do this.

357
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,040
Watch me.

358
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,890
I'm afraid I never
miss twice, colonel.

359
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,451
Oh, my god!

360
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,240
Tower, this is chappy.

361
00:31:56,248 --> 00:32:00,207
Clear the runway.
I got a problem.

362
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,459
Chappy!

363
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,589
Oh, man! Thank god
you're all right.

364
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,223
Somebody must have fooled
around with the ammo.

365
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,219
I'm damn grateful you're
such a lousy shot.

366
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,982
Who in the hell could've
made a mistake like that?!

367
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,446
That was no mistake, Arthur.

368
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,111
There's some deep shit

369
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,700
going down here, and
if they tried for me,

370
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,990
they're damn sure gonna try for Anna.
I need a car.

371
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,035
Who's Anna?

372
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,453
I'll let you know later.

373
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,497
We go with you.

374
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,291
If it's serious deep shit,

375
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,289
maybe you need some help.

376
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,211
Chappy sinclair is unhurt.

377
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,084
Let's go.

378
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,461
Let's hear it for
a great piece of flying.

379
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,442
Ooh, take us for a ride, man.

380
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:17,302
Wife say travel in
America very dangerous.

381
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,490
He tried to take her out,

382
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,701
and I don't mean for dinner.

383
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,780
Where's Anna?

384
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,160
Yo, baby, come on in.
Coast is clear.

385
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,297
Are you all right?

386
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,461
I'm fine.

387
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,258
You know him?

388
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,474
Oh, yeah, he's a heavy
homeboy from the hood.

389
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,638
My ass ain't gonna
be worth shit.

390
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,308
Nobody's ass is gonna be worth anything
if we don't find her a safe place.

391
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,147
You can take her
back to my place.

392
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,018
We could stay with her.

393
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,315
What are you gonna do with him?

394
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:19,486
I'm gonna get some of my brothers
to help me dump his ass.

395
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,697
He can't hang here, brother.

396
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,196
The police are gonna be happy
that he ain't breathing,

397
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,414
but his homeboys are gonna
come looking for me.

398
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:31,660
You know, like, inquiring
minds wanna know?

399
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,037
All right.

400
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,290
How about your aunt?

401
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,791
She's gone to stay with
friends for a few days.

402
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,167
Did you manage
to finish that map?

403
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,385
- Yes, I did.
- All right.

404
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,176
Here it is.

405
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,674
We've got enough time to get to

406
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,346
the DEA office
before they close.

407
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,060
Come on, let's go.

408
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,312
No help.

409
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,651
Peruvian justice people
say there's nothing

410
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,112
in the area except coffee
growers, that's confirmed.

411
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,276
Oh, no, kleiss'
setup is camouflaged.

412
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,275
You have to come in
low with a plane.

413
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,277
Esquitos air base
is in the same grid.

414
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,495
They'd know if anything was going
on without visual confirmation.

415
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,330
I have to take
their word for it.

416
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,699
That's bullshit!

417
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,666
I don't make the policy!

418
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,332
DEA will get kleiss.

419
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,829
It may take a while,

420
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,501
but we will bring
the bastard in.

421
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,465
A while?

422
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,822
That's a whole lot of comfort for
those people who are gonna die

423
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,461
in a couple days.

424
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,177
People die in the drug war
all the time, chappy!

425
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,095
There's nothing more that
can be done right now!

426
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,140
Don't you read
the papers, sinclair?

427
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,763
Peru's big on
territorial sovereignty.

428
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,606
No surveillance,
no interdiction,

429
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,771
no nothing without
their permission.

430
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,770
An f-16 can go so fast,
they can aim for Bogota

431
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,193
and end up over Lima
faster than you can say,

432
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,316
"my god, I'm in
the wrong airspace."

433
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,318
And get back out just as fast.

434
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,661
I don't believe
I'm hearing this.

435
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,156
Come here, chappy.

436
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,783
This is my whole life
here on the wall.

437
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,748
Take a good look.

438
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,666
Korea, 'nam, the Philippines.

439
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,336
You're asking me to put it
on the line by authorizing

440
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,880
a low-level
reconnaissance mission?

441
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,802
I wouldn't involve you, sir.

442
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,800
You bet your ass you're
not gonna involve Mel

443
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,223
you're grounded, sinclair.

444
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,222
This morales affair
has screwed all of us.

445
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,440
Whatever your involvement is,

446
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:20,277
bury it along with him.

447
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,317
Dismissed.

448
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,740
I tried everything, Anna.

449
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:14,205
It's important
you understand that.

450
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,200
You're everything Ramon
said you were.

451
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:19,203
But I've depending
on you too much.

452
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,705
Now I have to do
something myself.

453
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,581
Like what?

454
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:26,255
A few men escaped
to another village.

455
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,844
Maybe we can mount
some kind of attack.

456
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,884
With just a few guys?

457
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,429
I have to try.

458
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,722
My family's lives are at stake.

459
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,597
You have to understand that.

460
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,840
I'll take you with me

461
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,681
if you just send me

462
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,426
love letters

463
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,428
till I return...

464
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,478
Hardly the proper
attendance for a wake,

465
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,316
chappy, old chap.

466
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,810
May we join you?

467
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,312
Be my guest.

468
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,655
Chappy, just come
to say goodbye.

469
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,321
Not before I buy
you all a drink.

470
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,666
Where you all going?

471
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:47,006
Well, su has a business to run.

472
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,672
I have grandchildren
to terrorize.

473
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,012
I'm sure leichman here has
Nazi hunters to evade.

474
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,053
Bottom line is,

475
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,346
there's not a lot of call
for arthritic pilots.

476
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,686
At least we were all pilots.

477
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,681
Before they bastardized
the bloody word.

478
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,683
Mm, all due respect to
the deceased, of course.

479
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,525
The only thing
that was bastardized

480
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,144
was the way that
this kid went down

481
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,987
and the way they're
handling this damn thing!

482
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,527
He was a good pilot.

483
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,774
Oh, sure, he was, chappy.

484
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,150
I don't mean any offense,

485
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,153
but you have to admit
that the kids today

486
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,826
do it all with terminals and
monitors and what have you.

487
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,824
Now, as Ernst
is so fond of saying,

488
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,666
it used to be about the man...

489
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,752
- Not the machine!
- Not the machine!

490
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,751
Damn right.

491
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,632
Hey...

492
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,632
How would you like
to prove that theory?

493
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,562
I would.

494
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,106
What makes you so Randy

495
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,944
to go after this kraut?

496
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,486
All krauts weren't
Nazis, you know.

497
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:57,156
But this kleiss
was the worst kind.

498
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,529
He even killed his brother

499
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,155
for refusing to shoot down enemy

500
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,000
pilots parachuting to safety.

501
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,994
And then he had
the gall to steal

502
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,168
his dead brother's
medal of honor.

503
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,715
Well, why not?

504
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,926
Can't have you yanks and Jerrys

505
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,175
duking it out all over
the Peruvian jungles

506
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,973
without a representative
of queen and country.

507
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,245
I would be honored.

508
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,075
Gentlemen...

509
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,456
To Ramon.

510
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,459
Ramon.

511
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,222
These planes are
priceless antiques.

512
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,220
They are not battle gear!

513
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,223
Pound for pound, flown by the
right men, they're lethal.

514
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,725
Hell, you modified them.
You know what they can do.

515
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,023
What about air-to-ground ordinance?
These laser units.

516
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,692
How do you think
you're gonna get...

517
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,189
I have a card at the base.

518
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,565
I can get us outfitted in a day.

519
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,033
Anna leaves 12 hours earlier

520
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,494
and hooks up with the
local resistance.

521
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,987
There's a real comfort.

522
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,490
All they've got to do
is line up the lasers

523
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,787
with the targets and
leave the rest to us.

524
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,707
If they can get in there
undetected, a 2-year-old

525
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:31,830
can operate the unit.

526
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:32,956
And what if they don't?

527
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,958
Well, then we abort.

528
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,585
Either way, t'll have these
fighters back in this hangar

529
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:38,962
by Sunday morning.

530
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,634
Yeah, in how many pieces?

531
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,506
Damn, Arthur!

532
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:47,228
Men like you helped
to build this country,

533
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,893
and men like me
helped to defend it.

534
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,892
I'm willing to risk my career

535
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,189
and my life for
what I believe in.

536
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,654
Come on, Arthur, take a risk.

537
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,522
Cocaine is killing

538
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,944
our country, man.

539
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,943
Wouldn't you like to have

540
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,070
a nice story to tell
your grandchildren?

541
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,789
Something more than beating
out other wildcatters

542
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,250
or finagling the bond market?

543
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,084
Wouldn't you?

544
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,549
I'm taking polaroids.

545
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,009
Not a scratch
on those paint jobs.

546
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,594
Are you clear on that, chap?

547
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,589
I'm clear, I'm clear.

548
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,179
Hi.

549
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,902
So, how we gonna pull this off?

550
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,067
If you mean "we"
as in you and me,

551
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,566
then you got the wrong
definition of the word.

552
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,113
Aw, come on, chappy.

553
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:46,864
Excuse me.

554
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,705
Start contacting your people.

555
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,199
How long to prepare, chappy?

556
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,042
Airborne, 36 hours.

557
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,253
Let's go, guys.

558
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,305
I can't even tell if these
systems are compatible, chap.

559
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,800
The units were designed for
jets traveling at mach 1.

560
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,723
Well, we're about to find out.

561
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,728
Commencing approach.

562
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,225
You have to hold
the unit really steady

563
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,895
all the way through
target termination.

564
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,238
She's all yours.

565
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,960
Gonna need some seeker heads.

566
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:45,634
Fins too. Couple of other things.
Anna has the list.

567
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,139
You have a list?

568
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,633
Mmm.

569
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,391
When do you want this stuff?

570
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,184
Tonight will be fine.

571
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,025
Look, you want miracles, why
don't you call the pope?

572
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:01,021
Sats, compliments
of Warren Crawford.

573
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,614
Okay, Anna, let's take a real
good look at this village.

574
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:06,075
Okay, the guns are concealed

575
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,782
here and here.

576
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,077
There are more guns hidden in the
bushes and on the water tower here.

577
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,746
The village is very close by.

578
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:15,789
Yes.

579
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,411
That's a bit tight,

580
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,755
but with Anna and her men
in place to direct the lasers,

581
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,340
we should be able to
knock out the artillery

582
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,676
without doing any harm
to the villagers.

583
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,637
With bedlam going on there and
kleiss' pistols concentrating on us,

584
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,383
Anna should be able to get the
villagers out of that factory.

585
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,805
Then, on the second
time around...

586
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,053
We bomb that dope.

587
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,397
We each line up
on one target, right?

588
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,765
Correct.

589
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:40,109
Piece of cake, old boy.

590
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,103
Piece of cake?

591
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:45,106
I don't wanna hear
any more of this.

592
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,108
Let's get our gear stowed, Anna.

593
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,656
If we're gonna go, I wanna
be out of here early.

594
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,658
Oh, by the way,

595
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,252
I'm gonna put a
super-booster in the p-38.

596
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,042
Strike leader

597
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,085
could always use
a little extra power.

598
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,799
Much obliged.

599
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,386
All right,

600
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,722
we divide into pairs,
strike and wingman.

601
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,716
We cover each other's ass.

602
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,059
Who wants to team
with who, leichman?

603
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:17,226
Well, Nigel chose me last time,

604
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,940
so it would be impolite not to

605
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,434
return the favor.

606
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,776
Fine.

607
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,772
Su, that leaves you and me.

608
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,445
We've been tangoing
pretty good together.

609
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,408
Regret to say...

610
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,833
I cannot go with you

611
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,876
on mission.

612
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,716
Why, su?

613
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,711
What's wrong?

614
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,759
I have deceived you.

615
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,724
Deception?

616
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,719
I'm not famous Ace.

617
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,766
That was my brother.

618
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:01,391
He died 40 years ago.

619
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:05,236
I served, but only
at the end of war.

620
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,230
Never in combat.

621
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,074
Always in his shadow.

622
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:15,989
I would jeopardize your safety.

623
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,163
Forgive me.

624
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:26,750
I'm very dishonorable man.

625
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,898
You're not dishonorable.

626
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,900
You told the truth.

627
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:54,778
That's a damn hard thing to do.

628
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,075
Thank you.

629
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,790
Bloody hell...

630
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,463
I was just getting
fond of the idea.

631
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,461
God damn it, chappy!

632
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,804
Don't you think we
can pull this off?

633
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,298
Just the three of us.

634
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,140
Nah.

635
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,930
I told 'em these were defective.

636
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,853
Said I had to hand
carry them back to

637
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,563
the manufacturer to work the...

638
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,564
Bugs out.

639
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,114
Uh-uh.

640
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,167
'Evening, sir.

641
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,009
I might as well walk there.

642
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,628
It'd be safer than
flying this crate.

643
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,426
Christ, it doesn't
even have a hood.

644
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,095
Su will have you
checked out soon.

645
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,469
If there were any other
options, I'd take them.

646
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,472
If I had a suicide pill,
I'd take it.

647
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,064
Sir, you can't go in there!

648
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,353
That's all right, sergeant.

649
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,192
Thank you.

650
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,522
I followed ames.

651
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,195
He and sinclair got something going
on with those antique fighters.

652
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,909
Those old shit buckets?
They can't be that stupid.

653
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,323
Wings are loaded with ordinance.

654
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,662
They're not planning
a charity ball.

655
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,497
Where the hell are they
getting the stuff?

656
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,991
Ames, he's stripping
our storerooms

657
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,443
of everything that
isn't nailed down!

658
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,330
I'll fix that bastard.

659
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,332
- Sergeant.
- Sir?

660
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,425
Get the chief of
security in here.

661
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,340
We'll change our plans.

662
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,338
Take our plane down first thing,

663
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,340
turn around and transfer
immediately.

664
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,342
Contact our people
at the other bases.

665
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,345
Tell them to be prepared
for accelerated delivery.

666
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:12,294
Yo-ho-ho, ha-ha!
Santa claus is here.

667
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,633
Santa went straight to the ghetto.
Check this out, man.

668
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,174
I got enough stuff in here
to outfit a whole army.

669
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,263
What is all this?

670
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,723
Well, I took a little green out
of the homeboy's sock, right?

671
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,685
So Anna's dudes got something
to kick a little ass with.

672
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,055
Ha, check that out, brother.

673
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,353
So, am I in now, or what?

674
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,192
We already discussed this.

675
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,653
No, no, we ain't
"discussed" nothing.

676
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,989
All right, if shit hits
the fan, I'll be there.

677
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,323
You could get killed
in that place, boy.

678
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,238
Hey, I can get killed

679
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,703
in my own neighborhood, man.
There ain't nothing new to that.

680
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:47,200
Look, your personality just
doesn't fit my team profile.

681
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,372
So forget it.

682
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:04,592
Captain, I'll need to
see inside the vehicle.

683
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:25,162
Fourth of July?

684
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,500
Good luck.

685
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,369
Thanks, chappy.

686
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:34,713
Guess we finally understand
each other, don't we?

687
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,548
Yes, we do.

688
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,051
Chappy,

689
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,178
watch your ass.

690
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,555
I always do.

691
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,360
Chappy.

692
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,657
Ames was gonna check
my laser control.

693
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,530
Now, where the hell is he?

694
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,533
We don't have our full complement
of missiles yet, you know.

695
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,704
Chappy!

696
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:18,086
It's ames on the phone.
He's in trouble.

697
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,546
I better get to a radio

698
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,589
and call him back.

699
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,437
We'll never make it with three aircraft
and half the ordinance untested.

700
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,399
Suggest we leave.

701
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:28,869
We a half hour behind schedule.

702
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,533
Su,

703
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,247
are you sure?

704
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:36,790
I'm sure, but decision is yours.

705
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:41,291
Perhaps your lives
will depend on me.

706
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,713
We would be honored.

707
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,788
So, where are your people?

708
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,461
They'll be here.

709
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,601
Ahh!

710
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,603
My legs, my legs!

711
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,605
I can't feel my legs!
They're dead!

712
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,607
What do you think you're doing?

713
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:50,951
What am I doing? Yo, baby, that was
my best Eddie Murphy imitation.

714
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,615
Hey, how you doing?

715
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,614
It's showtime,
so let's get busy.

716
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,741
He goes back with you.

717
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,743
Oh, wait, baby!
We a team now, huh?

718
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:01,245
We like jazzy Jeff
and the fresh prince.

719
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,463
I mean, we like
milli and vanilli.

720
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,966
We like Michael Jackson
and the elephant man's bones.

721
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,880
Yo, are they still together?

722
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:11,005
No they're not together,
and neither are we.

723
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,677
You're history.

724
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,259
Now, if I do recall,
I saved your butt,

725
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,260
twice.

726
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,762
And I am trying to save yours.

727
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:20,935
Ho, ho, well, don't
go dissin' me, baby.

728
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,476
My butt is covered.

729
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,945
The rest of your posse be happy to have
me along. By the way, where are they?

730
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:28,530
Behind you.

731
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:34,828
Damn!

732
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:38,450
Homeboys around here got
some badass disguises.

733
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,669
What's happenin'?

734
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,672
Como?

735
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,972
Uh, usted dig rap?

736
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,641
You know, like,

737
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,479
my name is tee vee

738
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,474
and I'm here to say that I am

739
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,476
a rapping brother
and I'm here to stay.

740
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,443
Nah?

741
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,654
Let's see, uh, you
got mtv around here?

742
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:12,821
You got an opinion
on 2 live crew?

743
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,785
Guess not.

744
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,332
Hey.

745
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,795
Where's your posse going off to?

746
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,414
Back to their homes.

747
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:29,007
Hey, can I get a rewind on that?

748
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,797
Kleiss' security
has been increased.

749
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,465
They say we don't have a chance.

750
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,965
Well, I make it a point to
never argue with the locals.

751
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:39,639
I have got to roll.

752
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,479
Make that "we."
The party's over.

753
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,565
Look, you're crazy if you think
you're going in there alone.

754
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,026
It's much too dangerous.

755
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,452
Ordinance.

756
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,662
Check.

757
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,797
Check.

758
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,128
Check.

759
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,626
That'll do it.

760
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:15,471
We've got three hours
till refuel.

761
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,925
Take it easy.

762
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,550
Gets uglier from there on in.

763
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:42,494
You're pulling out?

764
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,867
As soon as you're airborne.

765
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,871
Cause for celebration by the
local people, I'm sure.

766
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,498
Oh, yes, they'll be
having a special mass.

767
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,967
It will be most uplifting.

768
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:59,507
Make sure everything
is ready to go.

769
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,530
A little overkill,
don't you think?

770
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,578
- Never hurt Stallone.
- Not so fast.

771
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:50,023
Maybe I better follow you.

772
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:53,690
The deposits have been
made, just as we agreed.

773
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:58,157
This final shipment should
be worth another 50 million,

774
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,821
perhaps more.

775
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,693
Disbursed to bases
all over the country,

776
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,570
along with
the lethridge surplus.

777
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:05,573
No questions will ever be asked.

778
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,916
And you are a very rich man.

779
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,955
Don't you want to drink to that?

780
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:13,171
I'll drink to paying back those
bastards at the Pentagon.

781
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:17,168
I gave them 27 years, god damn
it, and they closed me down.

782
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,527
We're getting close
to the village.

783
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,701
Here.

784
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,970
Let's go.
We don't have much time.

785
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,820
Hold this.

786
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,157
Stay here.

787
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:48,683
Shh.

788
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,534
Ahh!

789
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,064
Ahh!

790
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,754
Ahh!

791
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,185
Ahh!

792
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,221
Ahh!

793
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:54,008
We're getting close.

794
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:00,143
Panther one?

795
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:03,138
This is strike leader.
Do you copy?

796
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,520
This is strike leader. Do...

797
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:17,118
Panther one,
this is strike leader.

798
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:18,987
Do you copy? Over.

799
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,989
Maybe we're still out of range.
Possible.

800
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,124
We're only a half hour
from the target.

801
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:25,244
I'll keep trying.

802
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,997
It's dangerous to break
radio silence repeatedly

803
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,960
at this point, isn't it, chappy?

804
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:34,135
We're flying blind
without the ground unit.

805
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:38,178
Panther one, this is
strike leader. Come in.

806
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:59,699
Yo, man, watch the threads.

807
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,994
Jesus!

808
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:07,620
This is a laser interlock
unit from my base.

809
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,251
Sinclair!

810
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:17,004
Sector five has just picked up

811
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:19,263
the transmission
of four aircraft

812
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:21,474
- headed this way.
- Call esquitos air base.

813
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,309
I'm getting airborne!

814
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,144
Get him out of here.

815
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:15,152
Bogey.

816
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,363
10 o'clock and closing.

817
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,107
Shit!

818
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,983
Gustav.

819
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,610
Aircraft in path, identify.

820
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:24,237
Identify? Shoot them down!

821
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,739
What do I pay you for?!

822
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,615
That is kleiss.

823
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:31,119
He's pretty good
at buying off pilots.

824
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,121
Split up fast and pull them

825
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,043
in close where we
have the advantage.

826
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,189
Bank out of there, Nigel.

827
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,280
He's gonna get your ass.

828
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,650
Hardly, old boy.

829
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,528
Remember, the man,
not the machine?

830
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,686
Ohh...!

831
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:42,152
Ah! Mayday, chappy!

832
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,401
Mayday!

833
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:47,495
Mayday, chappy!

834
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:48,829
Hang on, Nigel, hang on.

835
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,289
What the bloody hell

836
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:52,579
does it look like I'm doing?!

837
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:13,813
Ohh...!

838
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,852
Well done, old chap.

839
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,248
Am I glad to see you.

840
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,584
I got tired of hanging
around here all by myself.

841
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,828
I should just leave you
here, you know that?

842
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:37,396
I hope these things still work.

843
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,817
Looks like your posse
had a change of heart.

844
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,199
Su, use your countermeasures

845
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,412
deploy your foil

846
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:54,906
and get out of there.

847
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:29,486
I'm going to the airport.

848
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,485
You get things moving here!

849
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:45,339
Yo, strike leader,
this is panther one.

850
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:48,506
We're loose, we got the juice, and we're
ready to blow the shit out of this goose.

851
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:49,753
Tee vee, is that you?

852
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,425
None other, baby.

853
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:54,265
I flew in for the surprise
party, baggage class.

854
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,724
Where are you?

855
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,559
We're up at the bell
tower in the church.

856
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,554
You should stop by.
We got a beautiful view.

857
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,271
What about the lasers?

858
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:04,267
Anna's setting them up
as we speak.

859
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,734
You better jam, man.

860
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,478
Kleiss is pumping
some major drugs into

861
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,230
the belly of a big
bird on the runway.

862
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,324
We'll line up on the artillery.

863
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:12,779
We're 20 miles out and closing.

864
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:14,243
Gotcha.

865
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,748
Come on, baby. Get some
big dudes on that sucker.

866
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,494
This ain't
"pee-wee's playhouse."

867
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:28,917
Leichman, panther one
is in position.

868
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,919
Can you hold out while me
and Palmer go in for target?

869
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,670
I'm good.

870
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,673
Horikoshi, what about you?

871
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,675
Never better.

872
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,674
Ernst, are you all right?

873
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:22,019
Yeah, he got the message.

874
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:37,410
So much for your
damned air cover!

875
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,028
Get those engines started now!

876
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:41,659
Get those things moving!

877
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,998
Lock them in now.

878
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:45,493
Check. You hear the man?

879
01:13:48,716 --> 01:13:50,832
Palmer, take the northwest gun.

880
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:53,001
- Fire when you get a lock.
- Roger.

881
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:31,915
The bloody tracking unit
isn't working!

882
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,388
We better switch positions.
Leichman...

883
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,098
Get down here.

884
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:42,763
Palmer's laser malfunctioned.

885
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:49,933
Afraid mine is too.
Doesn't even light up.

886
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:52,852
Su, do you read me?

887
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:54,524
I'm on my way.

888
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,253
Get airborne, now!

889
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,879
Where the hell am I gonna go?!

890
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,881
El Salvador.
I have friends there.

891
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:24,884
You may lose the flags
and the military bands

892
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:28,058
when you retire, but you
won't lose the money.

893
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,640
I need gunners!

894
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:31,857
You!

895
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,648
You! Herel

896
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:39,945
hold the northwest position

897
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,692
and line up on southwest,
you got it?

898
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,240
We got it!

899
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:50,080
Palmer, you okay?

900
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,669
As I said, technology
is no match for seasoning.

901
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:53,879
We're going back down.

902
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,802
Smug bastard.

903
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,064
So much for seasoning.

904
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,042
Only one bogey left.

905
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:35,209
And it looks like
we lost Palmer.

906
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,717
Damn it!

907
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,892
We're all lined up.

908
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:56,642
We're coming in.

909
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,093
Ahh...!

910
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:35,059
Yeah! Whoo!

911
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,828
Line up the southeast
gun for su.

912
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:52,744
I'm saving my missiles
for the factory.

913
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:55,914
Tell Anna to get her people out of there
and into the church. Do you copy?

914
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,834
We copy, chappy!

915
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,877
We're lining up now!

916
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,432
You suckers!

917
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,287
Anna's people are doing good.

918
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:58,032
But the trucks are
starting to split.

919
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:00,034
I think they got kleiss'
equipment on them.

920
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,876
That's my call.

921
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:14,886
All right, the big bird
has taken off.

922
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,884
Shit.

923
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:20,145
Su?

924
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,105
I would be honored.

925
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:46,080
Okay, Anna's getting
her people into the church.

926
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,752
Oh, it's perfect.

927
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:57,549
You're clear. We're gonna get a
line on the factory right now.

928
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:00,553
Tell me when you're set.

929
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:03,055
Get this truck out of here
and move the other one in!

930
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,432
Okay, we got a lock.

931
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,969
Oh, ho! Air force, baby!

932
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,055
When it absolutely,

933
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:38,515
positively has to be!

934
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:40,259
Whoo!

935
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:48,146
Blow the church. Take the
men up into the mountains!

936
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:02,949
Mayday! Mayday!

937
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,952
Kleiss is pulling in two choppers'
worth of backup. We're history.

938
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:07,954
Let's get out of here.

939
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:10,331
Strike leader,
this is Warren Crawford.

940
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,003
Do you copy?

941
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:14,626
Warren, are those
choppers yours?

942
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:17,380
DEA's finest.

943
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:20,508
Eta, five minutes.

944
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:23,886
Panther one, those
choppers are friendly.

945
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,013
Stay put until the DEA
can give you help.

946
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:28,356
We copy that, baby.

947
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:36,482
Damn, I knew this

948
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,154
was too easy.

949
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,033
Ahh!

950
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:27,158
Tee vee, come back!

951
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,037
Ahh!

952
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,381
Ahh!

953
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,556
Ahh!

954
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:18,300
Tee vee, you okay?

955
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,385
Nice hat.

956
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:33,515
One more pass.

957
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:35,188
You take care of it.

958
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:37,436
I'm worried about su.

959
01:24:57,634 --> 01:25:00,501
Get him out of here!

960
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:02,670
Knock that bastard
out of the sky!

961
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:25,734
Ahh!

962
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,455
Hold your fire! Hold it!

963
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,107
Chappy, kleiss is airborne.

964
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,439
Repeat, kleiss has escaped.

965
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:02,483
What's he flying?

966
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:05,107
It's the weirdest damn
jet I've ever seen.

967
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:06,733
Guns all over the wings.

968
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:08,406
Which direction?

969
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,324
North.

970
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:28,847
Ahh!

971
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:38,140
Jackhammer, this is warp seven.

972
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:40,938
Come on up. The skies are clear.

973
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:46,691
Not quite.

974
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,693
Two fighters remain.

975
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:50,569
They're flying shit buckets.

976
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,491
Let 'em take their best shots.

977
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:56,829
Su, come in, this is chappy.

978
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,379
Su, pull out!

979
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:07,340
Ahh...!

980
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:14,513
Sul!

981
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:17,183
Oh, shit!

982
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:27,735
- Good god!
- It survived.

983
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:29,279
What?

984
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:31,402
Messerschmitt 263.

985
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:34,621
The plane that was going to
win the war for Germany.

986
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:37,866
Don't take him on alone.

987
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:41,871
Chappy, I didn't fly
all this way to run.

988
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:52,305
Break it off, leichman.

989
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:53,765
I'm 10 seconds out.

990
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:55,475
Leichman?

991
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:57,720
Is that you, Ernst?

992
01:27:57,731 --> 01:28:00,939
You've disgraced our family's name,
and you disgraced our country.

993
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:03,684
Ha, one last chance for you

994
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:06,402
to do something
for the fatherland.

995
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:08,897
You've got that
just exactly right.

996
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:37,767
Leichman, bail out!

997
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:58,413
Hardly the Aryan ideal,

998
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,414
are you?

999
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,746
I'm afraid I didn't get a
chance to grab my swastika

1000
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,415
and get a lobotomy.

1001
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:44,371
You only have seconds to live.

1002
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,119
I smell the kill.

1003
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:48,122
What you smell is in your pants.

1004
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:49,543
Take a whiff of this.

1005
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:14,773
Kiss my ass!

1006
01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:32,840
Damn!

1007
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,004
Bastard never dies.

1008
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:40,677
Warren, this is strike leader.

1009
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:42,926
Kleiss has failed.

1010
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:45,896
We spot him.

1011
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:49,391
Dispatching a unit now.

1012
01:30:49,402 --> 01:30:50,938
I'm coming in.

1013
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:23,675
Don't seem to recall your name.

1014
01:31:23,687 --> 01:31:25,973
Morales.

1015
01:31:26,022 --> 01:31:28,604
Like my brother Ramon.

1016
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:31,099
But more intelligent, perhaps?

1017
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,443
What do you want for the Jeep?

1018
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:36,483
Six figures, seven?

1019
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:39,866
I don't even talk about
a full tank of gas.

1020
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:43,695
Very sensible.

1021
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:46,949
I have a lot of friends
here, and there are

1022
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,996
no extradition
treaties with the U.S.

1023
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:10,767
You know what movie they're
showing on the way home?

1024
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:12,561
You all right?

1025
01:32:12,569 --> 01:32:13,854
I'm gonna make it.

1026
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:15,193
I know you will.

1027
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:17,858
Confounded Palmer

1028
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:21,609
is going to haunt me till
I'm an octogenarian.

1029
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:23,234
You mean,
you found the wreckage?

1030
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:26,989
Not the wreckage, Palmer!

1031
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,787
The devil's alive!

1032
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:38,508
I think this calls for
a celebration, chappy!

1033
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:42,925
Yeah, I know just
the place for it.

1034
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:47,641
Hey, what's with the stetson?

1035
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:51,270
"Well, let me
tell ya, pardner..."

1036
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,265
I'm switching from
urban to suburban.

1037
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:55,267
Kind of like you, brother.

1038
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:57,109
Well, put these steaks on.

1039
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:58,774
All righty.

1040
01:32:58,782 --> 01:33:00,773
And don't burn them
like you did those chops.

1041
01:33:00,784 --> 01:33:02,649
Those aren't burned, they're...

1042
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,651
- Aw, shut up.
- Extremely well done.

1043
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,152
Hey!

1044
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:09,823
So, where's dad and the boys?

1045
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:11,854
They wanted to be here more
than anything to thank you,

1046
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:13,664
but they knew you'd understand.

1047
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:15,294
We'll never forget
all you've done for us.

1048
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:16,663
Ahh...

1049
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:18,001
Hmm?

1050
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:19,541
Well, the DEA,

1051
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:21,543
they wanted sole
credit for the bust

1052
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:24,011
and I wanted all of kleiss'
cash to go to the villagers.

1053
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:27,052
So, we made a compromise.
They did it my way.

1054
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:33,847
- I have something that
- I think belongs to you.

1055
01:33:39,656 --> 01:33:41,738
Welcome home.

1056
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:45,275
Thank you, Anna.

1057
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,948
Well, you know, I didn't
come out so bad either.

1058
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:50,242
The air force gave me
a nice little fleet

1059
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:52,662
of mothballed f-86s
to keep my mouth shut.

1060
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:54,120
Ah-ha!

1061
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:56,586
Leichman and Palmer are gonna

1062
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,250
fly 'em for me next year.

1063
01:33:58,258 --> 01:34:00,249
Uh, well...

1064
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,842
If we can work out
the percentages.

1065
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:06,134
What about a guest shot from
you next season, chappy?

1066
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:13,186
Now that you got your own plane.

1067
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:19,059
What are you gonna call her?

1068
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:21,186
Son of a bitch.

1069
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:23,904
That's not much of a name.

1070
01:34:25,577 --> 01:34:29,195
You know, I think
