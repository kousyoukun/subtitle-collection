<i>Will this time be the one?</i>

<i>You travel?</i>

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
<i>I did.</i>

19
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,875
<i>And I got you something.</i>

20
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:22,958
<i>What's that?</i>

21
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,958
<i>- Ooh, first edition <i>Don Quixote.
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

22
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,166
<i>- That couldn't have been cheap.
- It wasn't.</i>

23
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,666
<i>So why am I here, Booker?</i>

24
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,250
<i>You remember Surabaya
eight years ago, right?</i>

25
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,250
<i>CIA.</i>

26
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,125
<i>Yeah. The guy who hired us,
James Copley, reached out.</i>

27
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,250
<i>He's freelance now.</i>

28
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,083
<i>He has a hostage situation
in South Sudan.</i>

29
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,333
<i>No, Booker. We don't do repeats.
You know that.</i>

30
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,416
<i>It's too risky.</i>

31
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,416
<i>Andy.</i>

32
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,416
<i>Joe and Nicky?</i>

33
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,291
<i>At the hotel.</i>

34
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,791
<i>Come back again.</i>

35
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,458
<i>Thank you.
Welcome to El Fenn, sir.</i>

36
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,101
<i>Checking in?</i>

37
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,791
What brings you to Marrakesh?
<i>Family.</i>

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,666
<i>Say, "Marrakesh!"</i>

39
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,833
Marrakesh!

40
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,125
<i>Would you like me to take one for you?</i>

41
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,875
<i>Oh, thank you so much.
I just really suck at taking selfies.</i>

42
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,666
<i>There you go.</i>

43
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,250
<i>Thank you!</i>

44
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,666
<i>Mmm!</i>

45
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,333
<i>- You look great.
- You look okay.</i>

46
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,000
<i>Thank you! Thank you!</i>

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,375
<i>And I have something for you.</i>

48
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,541
<i>Nicky!</i>

49
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,291
<i>Mmm!</i>

50
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,250
<i>Baklava.</i>

51
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,666
<i>Five hundred, Booker.</i>

52
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,083
<i>No.</i>

53
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,791
<i>All right.</i>

54
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,309
<i>- All in. Here it is.</i>
- Really?

55
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,041
- All in!
<i>- All in!</i>

56
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,500
<i>Mmm!</i>

57
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,666
<i>Hazelnut, not walnut.</i>

58
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,375
<i>The Black Sea.</i>

59
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,083
<i>Rosewater.</i>

60
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,375
<i>Pomegranate.</i>

61
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,291
<i>Mmm!</i>

62
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,208
<i>Eastern Turkey.</i>

63
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,875
<i>Ow!</i>

64
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,708
No, no, no. Don't worry.

65
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,833
<i>Admit it, boss.
You missed us.</i>

66
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,416
<i>I did.</i>

67
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,208
<i>It's a job, guys.</i>

68
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,958
<i>We can do some good.</i>

69
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,000
<i>Have you been watching
the news lately?</i>

70
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,750
<i>Some good means nothing.</i>

71
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,875
<i>I don't know about this, guys.</i>

72
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,458
<i>We're not helping.</i>

73
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,333
<i>I know you needed a break,
but it's been over a year, boss.</i>

74
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,333
<i>This is what we do, Andy.</i>

75
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,708
<i>I'll hear him out.</i>

76
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,750
<i>Mr. Copley.</i>

77
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,916
<i>Mr. Booker, </i>bonjour.

78
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,934
<i>- It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
- Last time I checked,</i>

79
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,458
<i>you had to be American to be in the CIA.</i>

80
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,541
<i>I was born in Boston.</i>

81
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,625
<i>Moved to London when
I was three.</i>

82
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,333
<i>So why did you leave the agency,
Mr. Copley?</i>

83
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,375
<i>My wife got sick.</i>

84
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,458
<i>ALS.</i>

85
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,458
<i>She died two years ago.</i>

86
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,458
<i>Just haven't found
my way back yet.</i>

87
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,083
<i>- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.</i>

88
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,791
<i>You haven't aged a day, Booker.</i>

89
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,083
<i>- Trust me, I have.</i>
- Yeah.

90
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,375
<i>Yesterday afternoon local,</i>

91
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,375
<i>a school southwest of Juba
was attacked by a militia.</i>

92
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:11,375
<i>They murdered the teachers and abducted
17 of the students at gunpoint.</i>

93
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,916
<i>The youngest was eight...</i>

94
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,041
<i>oldest, 13.</i>

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
<i>South Sudanese asked the US for help,</i>

96
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:25,000
<i>but current administration's policy
is to deny aid to any nonstrategic allies.</i>

97
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,916
<i>Some of my ex-colleagues at the CIA
feel differently.</i>

98
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,541
<i>They reached out to me,
and I'm reaching out to you.</i>

99
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,791
<i>The last overfly confirmed
the personnel on site.</i>

100
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,625
<i>No food or water being brought in.</i>

101
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,791
<i>That means
they're moving them soon.</i>

102
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:50,875
<i>And when they do,</i>

103
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,416
<i>most likely they'll be separated,
and odds are we'll never find them again.</i>

104
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,791
<i>Has to be done quickly...</i>

105
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,041
<i>by the best,
and your team's the best I've ever seen.</i>

106
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,666
<i>You can name your price.</i>

107
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,291
<i>We'll invoice you when it's done.</i>

108
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,583
<i>Peace be with you.</i>

109
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,250
<i>What the...</i>

110
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,208
<i>Are we too late?</i>

111
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,708
<i>Motherfuck...</i>

112
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,541
<i>Room clear!</i>

113
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Shit!</i>

114
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,226
<i>Look out! Reload!</i>

115
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,375
<i>What the hell?</i>

116
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,916
<i>- Everyone still with me?</i>
- Yeah.

117
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,416
<i>Joe?</i>

118
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,416
<i>Very pissed off.</i>

119
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,500
<i>So where are the girls?</i>

120
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,708
<i>There never were any girls.</i>

121
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,833
<i>We've been set up.</i>

122
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,791
<i>Yeah, I got it.</i>

123
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,333
<i>Yeah.</i>

124
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,416
<i>One has to admire
Mr. Copley's attention to detail.</i>

125
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,833
<i>Those shoes were a particularly
grotesque touch.</i>

126
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,375
<i>I knew this was gonna happen.</i>

127
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,166
<i>I said it.</i>

128
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,291
<i>We did it right, Andy.</i>

129
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,250
<i>- For the right reasons.
- And what did it get us, Nicky? What?</i>

130
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,458
<i>Nothing.</i>

131
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,500
<i>We've done nothing.</i>

132
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,166
<i>The world isn't getting any better.</i>

133
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,541
<i>It's getting worse.</i>

134
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,833
<i>I checked him completely, and...</i>

135
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,875
<i>everything seemed legit.</i>

136
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,291
<i>I'm sorry, guys.</i>

137
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,166
<i>They know who we are.
They know what we are.</i>

138
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,916
<i>We have to find Copley.</i>

139
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,500
<i>We have to tie this thing off.</i>

140
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,541
<i>- And then what?
- And then nothing.</i>

141
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,875
<i>The world can burn for all I care.</i>

142
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,250
<i>I'm done.</i>

143
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,750
<i>Hmm?</i>

144
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,125
<i>Freeman, where you at?</i>

145
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,666
<i>Here, Sergeant.</i>

146
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,708
<i>The women are holed up in the house
with the arches.</i>

147
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,208
<i>Take a right at the building
with the red carpet.</i>

148
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,375
<i>- Get me some information.
- Roger that.</i>

149
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,833
<i>Keep it respectful.</i>

150
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,750
<i>Don't we always?</i>

151
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,208
<i>Never hurts to repeat it.</i>

152
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,166
<i>My name is Nile.</i>

153
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,250
<i>I am an American Marine.</i>

154
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,500
<i>We are looking for this man.</i>

155
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,125
<i>He has killed many of our people</i>

156
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,208
<i>and many of yours.</i>

157
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,500
<i>Have any of you seen him?</i>

158
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,500
<i>You do not disrespect your family</i>

159
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,333
<i>by telling us where he is.</i>

160
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,958
<i>There are no men here.</i>

161
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,833
<i>To use women as shields
is to be no man at all.</i>

162
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,666
<i>Thank you for allowing us into your home.</i>

163
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,101
<i>We will leave you in peace.</i>

164
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,250
<i>Breach!</i>

165
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,125
<i>Stop!</i>

166
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,708
<i>- Clear! Covering!
- Clear!</i>

167
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,541
<i>Lima 3, this is India 5.
Contact, over.</i>

168
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,291
<i>Jay, go check on the women.</i>

169
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,375
<i>On it.</i>

170
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,916
<i>Look at all this shit.
It's jackpot.</i>

171
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,333
<i>Not if he bleeds out.
They wanted him alive, remember?</i>

172
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,500
<i>Do not...</i>

173
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,625
<i>Do not touch me.</i>

174
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,625
<i>I'm trying to save you, man.</i>

175
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,208
<i>Dizzy, a little help, please?</i>

176
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,458
<i>No! Medic!</i>

177
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,625
<i>Man down!</i>

178
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,500
<i>No! Jesus! Medic!</i>

179
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,416
<i>Stay with me!</i>

180
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,125
<i>Oh, my...</i>

181
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,583
<i>God! Jesus, no.</i>

182
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,166
<i>Come here. Stay with me.
Look at me.</i>

183
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,375
<i>Look at me.
You're gonna be okay.</i>

184
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,875
<i>Nile! Nile!</i>

185
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,666
<i>You're okay. It's okay.
Stay with me. Just look at me. Look at me.</i>

186
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,250
<i>Okay. Medic's on their way.
Medic's on their way.</i>

187
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,791
<i>No, no. It's okay.
It's okay.</i>

188
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,625
<i>The medic's coming!</i>

189
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,125
<i>What the...</i>

190
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:52,916
<i>No.</i>

191
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,291
<i>No, not another one.</i>

192
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,625
<i>Not now.</i>

193
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:58,750
<i>It was a woman.</i>

194
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:00,708
<i>A black woman.</i>

195
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,041
<i>I saw an older
woman in a hijab.</i>

196
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,375
<i>What did you see?</i>

197
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:09,833
<i>I saw...</i>

198
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,291
<i>I saw part of a name tag.</i>

199
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,708
<i>Uh, yeah.
Free... free something.</i>

200
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,166
<i>- Yeah.
- Dirt floor, clay walls.</i>

201
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,125
<i>And a medevac.</i>

202
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:20,500
<i>Yeah, so maybe a, uh...
a coalition...</i>

203
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,041
<i>medical team.</i>

204
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:25,291
<i>The knife was a pesh-kabz.
Pashtun.</i>

205
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,000
<i>I felt her die.</i>

206
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,083
<i>She's a Marine.</i>

207
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,208
<i>Combat.</i>

208
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,416
<i>Or near-combat duty.</i>

209
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,000
<i>Afghanistan.</i>

210
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,208
<i>It's been over 200 years.</i>

211
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:46,958
<i>Why now?</i>

212
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,333
<i>Everything happens for
a reason, boss.</i>

213
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,208
<i>We have to find her.</i>

214
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,666
<i>No, we stick to the plan.
We find Copley.</i>

215
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,184
<i>- So we just leave her out in the open?
- No, we're in the open.</i>

216
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,291
<i>- We're the ones who are exposed now.
- Not like her.</i>

217
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,291
<i>Nicky...</i>

218
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,375
<i>Not like her.</i>

219
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,125
<i>You can't tell me you don't remember
what it was like.</i>

220
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:11,333
<i>Whoever she is,
she's confused, and she's scared,</i>

221
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,916
<i>and she's more alone
than she has ever been in her entire life.</i>

222
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,666
<i>We all remember what it was like.</i>

223
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,041
<i>She needs us.</i>

224
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:28,875
<i>I'll handle the retrieval.</i>

225
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,125
<i>Hey, boss, come on.</i>

226
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,708
<i>If we're dreaming about her,
she's dreaming about us.</i>

227
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,583
<i>That makes her a beacon straight to us.</i>

228
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,291
<i>- What do we do in the meantime?
- Get to France.</i>

229
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,750
<i>Use the Charlie safe house.</i>

230
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,458
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>

231
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,500
<i>Find Copley.</i>

232
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,666
<i>Jesus.</i>

233
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,708
<i>She's just a baby.</i>

234
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,333
<i>I know I saw her die.</i>

235
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,166
<i>A little blood can look like a lot.</i>

236
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,450
<i>Adrenaline flying,
everyone was seeing shit they didn't.</i>

237
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,666
<i>I was holding her neck together
in my hands.</i>

238
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,541
<i>You'd rather we sent her home
in a body bag?</i>

239
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,291
<i>No, of course not.</i>

240
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,375
<i>So come on.</i>

241
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,583
<i>Hey, look who's up.</i>

242
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:52,208
<i>Nile?</i>

243
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,583
<i>What's up, Jay?</i>

244
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:58,833
<i>What's up, Dizzy?</i>

245
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,333
<i>So let's see the trophy.</i>

246
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,208
<i>Fuck me.</i>

247
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,583
<i>Nile, there's not
even a scratch.</i>

248
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,666
<i>Yeah, they, uh...</i>

249
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,791
<i>They used this new skin graft
or something.</i>

250
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:22,875
<i>That what the doctor said?</i>

251
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,375
<i>Yeah.</i>

252
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,416
<i>That's what they said.</i>

253
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:47,625
Our average lifespan is 78
in developed nations.

254
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,875
<i>Actually, two more years if you're
lucky enough to be born a female.</i>

255
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:53,184
What can I say, ladies?

256
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:56,916
<i>Now, all of this is because
of everyone's favorite love-to-hate...</i>

257
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,375
<i>Big Pharma.</i>

258
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:03,000
<i>At my company,
our research on telomere extension</i>

259
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:06,458
<i>has reversed the chromosomal clock
of human stem cells.</i>

260
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:10,625
<i>Dr. Kozak's manipulation
of the klotho hormone will, in time,</i>

261
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:14,166
<i>completely arrest
common cognitive decline.</i>

262
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,250
<i>Yes, we can all wave
goodbye to dementia.</i>

263
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,041
<i>Now... wait!</i>

264
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:21,041
<i>Our work will add years of life</i>

265
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,875
<i>to the collective world population.</i>

266
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:25,666
<i>Years. Decades.</i>

267
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,583
<i>But it's not cheap.</i>

268
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,291
<i>We need investment.</i>

269
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:34,833
<i>Investment drives my enthusiasm
to take risks.</i>

270
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:38,125
<i>These risks improve countless lives.</i>

271
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,000
<i>My God.</i>

272
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,875
<i>You've seen my research.</i>

273
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,666
<i>Now you know they're for real.</i>

274
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:07,333
<i>What about the hard proof?</i>

275
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,333
<i>Blood, tissue, bone, DNA.</i>

276
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,708
<i>Recovering an uncontaminated sample
of the site proved impossible.</i>

277
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,333
<i>But you promised me hard proof.</i>

278
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,916
<i>There was an unanticipated
amount of carnage.</i>

279
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,184
<i>- But the footage...
- No, no.</i>

280
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,833
<i>The footage is
a two-million-dollar snuff film.</i>

281
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,083
<i>It doesn't give her the how.</i>

282
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,458
<i>I need all of them, Copley.</i>

283
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:36,250
<i>- I think I can get you one.
- No. No, not one. All.</i>

284
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,083
<i>These are extraordinary individuals.</i>

285
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,708
<i>They are extremely resistant to capture.</i>

286
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,911
<i>Well, consult with Keane, make a plan,
make it happen.</i>

287
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:48,000
<i>And quickly,
before my competitors get wind of this.</i>

288
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,500
<i>Corporal Freeman.</i>

289
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:21,625
<i>- Aye, Sergeant.
- Orders just came through.</i>

290
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:24,583
<i>They're sending you to Landstuhl, Germany
for more tests.</i>

291
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:25,958
<i>But I'm fine.</i>

292
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,916
<i>Plane's fueling.
Pack your bags.</i>

293
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,500
<i>- Sergeant...
- We took these off you when it happened.</i>

294
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,083
<i>Didn't think you were coming back.</i>

295
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:11,708
<i>That's her.</i>

296
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,166
<i>♪ I will always love you ♪</i>

297

00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:51,750
<i>♪ Let go of a prayer for you ♪</i>

299

<i>Corporal Freeman.</i>

300
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,208
<i>Been looking for you.</i>

301
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:06,291
<i>Wheels up on your ride.</i>

302
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:14,750
<i>- Who are you?
- Andromache the Scythian.</i>

303
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,000
<i>But you can call me Andy.</i>

304
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:54,375
<i>Why does it have to be so goddamn slow
the first couple of times?</i>

305
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,458
<i>You shot me.</i>

306
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:15,625
<i>I did.
I need you to get back in the car, please.</i>

307
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:19,416
<i>This isn't real.
No, none of this is real.</i>

308
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,333
<i>You haven't figured this out yet?
You can't die.</i>

309
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:23,333
<i>Get up.</i>

310
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:24,958
<i>Argh! Fuck!</i>

311
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,958
<i>Can you please not do that again?</i>

312
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
<i>Who are you?</i>

313
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:44,333
<i>I lead a group of immortals.</i>

314
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,416
<i>An army, I guess.</i>

315
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,833
<i>Soldiers.
Fighters like you.</i>

316
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:49,916
<i>Look...</i>

317
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,375
<i>You've got questions, kid.</i>

318
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:54,458
<i>I get it.</i>

319
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:56,916
<i>You want answers?</i>

320
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,041
<i>Get back in the car.</i>

321
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:01,541
<i>Put those on.</i>

322
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:04,041
<i>- Where are you taking me?
- Paris.</i>

323
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:08,125
<i>- You've got blood in your hair.
- Wonder why?</i>

324
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,625
<i>This guy's a drug runner.</i>

325
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,375
<i>This the shit you into?</i>

326
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:20,750
<i>Well, sometimes you gotta work with people
you don't wanna eat with.</i>

327
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,875
<i>Is this even safe?</i>

328
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:24,416
<i>Does it really matter?</i>

329
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:30,500
Hey, boss.

330
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:31,750
<i>You found Copley?</i>

331
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,625
<i>Nothing but dead ends.</i>

332
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,500
<i>He knows we're hunting him.</i>

333
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,583
<i>Keep looking.</i>

334
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,458
<i>He's doing the same to us.</i>

335
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,166
<i>I have the new one.</i>

336
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:42,583
<i>And?</i>

337
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:46,041
<i>Well, she stabbed me,
so I think she has potential.</i>

338
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:49,583
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

339
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:13,250
<i>So why is this happening to me?</i>

340
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,541
<i>I wish I knew.</i>

341
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,291
<i>You said you had answers.</i>

342
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,250
<i>I didn't say you'd like them.</i>

343
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,541
<i>Are you praying?</i>

344
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,291
<i>God doesn't exist.</i>

345
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:35,166
<i>My God does.</i>

346
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:39,166
<i>You know, there was a time
when I was worshiped as a god.</i>

347
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:47,958
<i>Was that Him?</i>

348
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,291
<i>Don't worry,
I can't do shit like that.</i>

349
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:54,541
<i>None of it means anything anyway.</i>

350
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,625
<i>You said there were others.</i>

351
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,416
<i>How many?</i>

352
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,750
<i>Four.</i>

353
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,416
<i>You're an army of four?</i>

354
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,958
<i>So that's why you took me?</i>

355
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:09,583
<i>So I could join your army?</i>

356
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:10,750
<i>Yeah.</i>

357
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:14,208
<i>No. This is some bullshit.</i>

358
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,625
<i>You must...</i>

359
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,750
<i>Must have hypnotized me, or...</i>

360
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:22,958
<i>or, uh, drugged me or something.</i>

361
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:26,166
<i>And that was a blank
that you shot me with.</i>

362
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,166
<i>And I was the one
who cut your throat.</i>

363
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,333
<i>Right?</i>

364
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:37,791
<i>Listen, kid.</i>

365
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,791
<i>You already believe in...</i>

366
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,708
<i>You should just keep following
that illogic.</i>

367
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:48,208
<i>You're already on board
with the supernatural.</i>

368
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,500
<i>If I were you,
I'd get some sleep.</i>

369
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,833
<i>We're not going to Paris.</i>

370
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,125
<i>Andrei.</i>

371
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:18,916
<i>Come here.</i>

372
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:21,166
<i>Sit your ass down!</i>

373
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:23,833
<i>- Stand up!
- You do not listen to her.</i>

374
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:24,916
<i>You listen to me.</i>

375
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:26,666
<i>Land this plane.</i>

376
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:30,125
<i>Trust me.
She's not gonna shoot you.</i>

377
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:32,541
<i>I am.</i>

378
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,750
<i>Who's gonna fly the plane?</i>

379
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,583
<i>We don't need a pilot.</i>

380
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:45,250
<i>We can jump and survive.</i>

381
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,750
<i>I am not jumping from a plane!</i>

382
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,833
<i>Whoa! Shit!
Maybe we do need a pilot.</i>

383
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,208
<i>I can fly a plane.</i>

384
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,833
<i>You don't speak Russian,
do you?</i>

385
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,291
<i>Why?</i>

386
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,625
<i>Because I told
the pilot to play dead.</i>

387
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,666
<i>You really want to do this, kid?</i>

388
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:40,833
<i>We're done.</i>

389
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:50,083
<i>I said we're done.</i>

390
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:08,666
<i>You're very good.</i>

391
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:17,541
<i>What's your name?</i>

392
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:20,875
<i>Nile.</i>

393
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,875
<i>You see?
You're already healing faster.</i>

394
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,375
<i>Is this real?</i>

395
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:53,250
<i>I got people that love me.</i>

396
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:55,750
<i>People that are gonna worry.</i>

397
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,250
<i>I'm a Marine.</i>

398
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:05,083
<i>- They think I went AWOL.
- You're not a Marine anymore.</i>

399
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,833
<i>They're going to lock you up.</i>

400
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:44,291
<i>I thought you said
we were going to Paris.</i>

401
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,541
<i>We're just outside of Paris.</i>

402
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:47,791
<i>This is Goussainville.</i>

403
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:50,666
<i>This place has been abandoned
for 50 years.</i>

404
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,166
<i>Why?</i>

405
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:17,583
<i>So are you good guys or bad guys?</i>

406
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,625
<i>Depends on the century.</i>

407
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,333
<i>We fight for what we think is right.</i>

408
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,458
<i>How are you all in my dreams?</i>

409
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:35,166
<i>We dream of each other.
They stop when we meet.</i>

410
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,250
<i>Why?</i>

411
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:40,666
<i>I believe it's because we...
we're meant to find each other.</i>

412
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:44,583
<i>It's like destiny.</i>

413
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:47,333
<i>No, more like misery loves company.</i>

414
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,375
<i>What he said.</i>

415
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,916
<i>It used to take years to track a new one.</i>

416
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,208
<i>Booker was the last.</i>

417
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,041
<i>1812.</i>

418
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:02,416
<i>No way.</i>

419
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:06,041
<i>Yeah, I died fighting with Napoleon.</i>

420
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:10,041
<i>So... you're even older than him.</i>

421
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:13,500
<i>Mmm... Nicky and I met in the Crusades.</i>

422
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:14,791
<i>The Crusades?</i>

423
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:18,125
<i>The love of my life was of the people
I've been taught to hate.</i>

424
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,250
<i>We...</i>

425
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:21,541
<i>We killed each other.</i>

426
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,665
<i>- Many times.</i>
- Yeah.

427
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:29,375
<i>You're the oldest.</i>

428
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:33,416
<i>Yeah.</i>

429
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:34,958
<i>So how old are you?</i>

430
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:39,500
<i>- Old.
- How old?</i>

431
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,583
<i>Too old.</i>

432
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:48,166
<i>So we really never die.</i>

433
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:50,791
<i>Nothing that lives lives forever.</i>

434
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,666
<i>But... you said that we were immortal.</i>

435
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,833
<i>I know what I said.</i>

436
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:59,791
<i>And we mostly are,
but we can die.</i>

437
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,375
<i>And one of us did.</i>

438
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:04,833
<i>He...</i>

439
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:07,541
<i>He was a warrior,
just like us.</i>

440
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,416
<i>A long time ago.</i>

441
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:13,500
<i>One day your wounds
just don't heal up anymore, and...</i>

442
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,250
<i>we don't know when or why.</i>

443
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:20,333
<i>So if we can die,</i>

444
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,708
<i>then why would you shoot me?</i>

445
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,958
<i>You could have killed me.</i>

446
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:28,458
<i>You're too new.</i>

447
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,583
<i>It is a lot to understand.</i>

448
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,500
<i>I think you should get some rest.</i>

449
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:41,708
<i>Come with me.</i>

450
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,750
<i>I'll show you.</i>

451
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:53,291
<i>She wants to talk to her family.</i>

452
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,666
<i>That's not gonna help her.</i>

453
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:00,583
<i>You tell her that.</i>

454
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:38,666
<i>What's going on?</i>

455
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:42,541
<i>What happened?</i>

456
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,958
<i>It's just a... a bad dream.</i>

457
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:48,166
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

458
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:55,666
<i>Tell us.</i>

459
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,833
<i>I saw flashes of it before...</i>

460
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:02,000
<i>when I first dreamt of all of you.</i>

461
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:06,208
<i>But now it's clearer.</i>

462
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:12,041
<i>I dreamed about
a woman locked in an iron coffin...</i>

463
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:14,208
<i>under the sea.</i>

464
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:17,291
<i>She kept...</i>

465
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:20,750
<i>drowning and then coming back to life.</i>

466
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:26,333
<i>She was hammering her bloody fists
and knees against the iron.</i>

467
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:30,375
<i>She felt like something insane,
something furious.</i>

468
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:33,041
<i>But she kept fighting...</i>

469
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:35,541
<i>and she kept drowning.</i>

470
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:47,250
<i>Her name was Quynh.</i>

471
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:51,458
She was one of us.

472
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:54,416
<i>The first immortal Andy found.</i>

473
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:02,791
<i>They had been alone so long,
when she found her...</i>

474
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:04,666
<i>Quynh had given up.</i>

475
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,250
<i>Way back,
it was her and Andy.</i>

476
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:13,958
<i>Before me and Nicky,
it was just the two of them.</i>

477
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:19,000
<i>They ran through the world together.
Fought thousands of battles side by side.</i>

478
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,791
<i>She was a pit viper in a fight.</i>

479
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:35,075
<i>They were in England,</i>

480
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:38,833
<i>freeing so-called heretics
from the witch trials.</i>

481
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,458
<i>But then,
Andy and Quynh,</i>

482
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:44,250
<i>they were accused of witchcraft
themselves,</i>

483
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,583
<i>- and they were trapped and caught.</i>
- Killers!

484
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:49,666
<i>Some will rot in hell!</i>

485
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,586
When they didn't die,
it proved their case,

486
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:55,583
<i>and they got sentenced
again and again.</i>

487
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:02,750
<i>I've never been burned
alive before.</i>

488
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:05,208
<i>What do you think
it's gonna be like?</i>

489
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,125
<i>Excruciating.</i>

490
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,125
<i>Just you and me.</i>

491
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:19,916
<i>Until the end.</i>

492
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:36,500
<i>No! No!</i>

493
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:37,583
<i>No, not this.</i>

494
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,750
No!
<i>Where are you taking her?</i>

495
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,375
<i>You are too powerful together.</i>

496
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:44,916
<i>For creatures such as you,
there is no salvation.</i>

497
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,416
<i>Please! No!</i>

498
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,541
<i>Quynh!</i>

499
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:54,500
<i>Quynh!</i>

500
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:03,125
<i>Andromache!</i>

501
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,250
<i>Andromache!</i>

502
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:12,083
<i>No!</i>

503
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:31,458
<i>After Andy escaped,
we spent decades searching for her</i>

504
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:34,958
<i>or anyone on that ship
who could tell us where she was cast off.</i>

505
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:37,833
<i>She's lived
with that guilt ever since,</i>

506
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:40,708
<i>but she blames herself
for Quynh's fate.</i>

507
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,583
<i>Why do you blame yourself?</i>

508
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:49,833
<i>I lost a soldier.</i>

509
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:53,541
<i>I feel her pain.</i>

510
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,750
<i>Her rage.</i>

511
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:58,416
<i>She feels crazy.</i>

512
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:02,833
<i>Over 500 years in a box...</i>

513
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,666
<i>at the bottom of the ocean...</i>

514
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:08,791
<i>would make anyone insane.</i>

515
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:12,208
That's the reason
why we dread capture.

516
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:15,041
<i>Spend eternity in a cage.</i>

517
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:57,291
<i>Nile.</i>

518
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:00,791
<i>I don't want this.</i>

519
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:02,416
<i>I don't want any of it.</i>

520
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,750
<i>I know. I know.</i>

521
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:06,333
<i>There isn't one good thing in any of this.</i>

522
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,041
<i>I know this is hard.</i>

523
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:12,333
<i>It's happening
whether you want it or not.</i>

524
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,500
<i>I know you're scared, Nile.</i>

525
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:28,000
<i>Me and those three men in there
will keep you safe.</i>

526
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:31,041
<i>Like Quynh?</i>

527
00:53:37,416 --> 00:53:38,583
<i>We're all you've got.</i>

528
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:47,833
<i>What's happening?</i>

529
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,250
<i>They found us.</i>

530
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,125
<i>Joe? Nicky?</i>

531
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,208
<i>Shit.</i>

532
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:10,958
<i>Booker.</i>

533
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:14,916
<i>You still with me?</i>

534
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:19,833
<i>Clear the back room.
Find Joe and Nicky.</i>

535
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,500
<i>Hey.</i>

536
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:22,583
<i>Hey.</i>

537
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:24,166
<i>Book.</i>

538
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:27,541
<i>Come on.</i>

539
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,416
<i>Come back to me.</i>

540
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,916
<i>You're still in this shitty
game with me.</i>

541
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:35,333
<i>You hear me?</i>

542
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:38,291
<i>Now wake up.</i>

543
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:44,458
<i>Wake up!</i>

544
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:51,583
<i>They're not here.</i>

545
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,041
<i>Welcome back, asshole.</i>

546
00:54:58,333 --> 00:54:59,625
<i>Thanks for taking your time.</i>

547
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:04,333
<i>It hurts everywhere.</i>

548
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:06,208
<i>How bad is it?</i>

549
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:08,916
<i>It's an improvement.</i>

550
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:12,583
<i>How many?</i>

551
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,333
<i>I don't know.</i>

552
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:16,541
<i>- Where are Nicky and Joe?
- I don't know!</i>

553
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,666
<i>I... I turned on the game.</i>

554
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:23,916
A grenade hit me.

555
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,333
<i>Lost the plot after that.</i>

556
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,559
<i>Two in transport.
No, no. We need the woman.</i>

557
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,541
<i>Wasn't there,
and the other guy's in pieces.</i>

558
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
<i>She's there.</i>

559
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:38,791
<i>- Copley.
- Copley?</i>

560
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:40,958
<i>They're coming back.
They want all of us.</i>

561
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,208
<i>You stay here.</i>

562
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:44,000
<i>Wait for my signal.</i>

563
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:45,625
<i>What signal?</i>

564
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:49,666
<i>What does that even mean?
You'll know it when it comes.</i>

565
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,333
<i>And, by the way,
it's not always like this now.</i>

566
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,916
<i>Big wounds take longer to heal.</i>

567
00:55:58,541 --> 00:55:59,541
<i>Sure.</i>

568
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,375
<i>Bravo Team approaching church.</i>

569
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,125
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

570
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:06,541
<i>Come on!
Move! Move!</i>

571
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:08,916
<i>We've gotta get out there!</i>

572
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,041
<i>We need to help her.</i>

573
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,583
<i>No, that's not the signal.</i>

574
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:29,958
<i>Mr. Keane,</i>

575
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:33,625
<i>I strongly recommend
that we leave right now.</i>

576
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:45,583
<i>Come on!</i>

577
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:47,666
<i>Let's move!</i>

578
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:49,083
<i>Wait for the signal.</i>

579
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:51,041
<i>How the hell can you even tell?</i>

580
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:55,916
<i>- Oh.
- Let's go!</i>

581
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,250
<i>Andy did all this herself?</i>

582
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:15,916
<i>Yeah. That woman has forgotten
more ways to kill</i>

583
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,500
<i>than entire armies will ever learn.</i>

584
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:20,041
<i>Who are they?
How'd they find you?</i>

585
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:21,416
<i>I don't know.
Let's go!</i>

586
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:56,333
<i>Nicolo.</i>

587
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:57,934
<i>- Quiet.
- Nicolo, wake up.</i>

588
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,726
<i>I said...
I know what you said.</i>

589
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,208
<i>What are you gonna do?
Kill me?</i>

590
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:02,666
<i>Wake up.</i>

591
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:03,583
<i>Wake up!</i>

592
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:04,666
<i>I'm here.</i>

593
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,583
<i>I'm here.</i>

594
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:08,791
<i>Wherever here is.</i>

595
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:10,958
<i>In an armored van.</i>

596
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,875
<i>They used gas.</i>

597
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,708
<i>I told you, shut up!</i>

598
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:16,083
<i>I need to know he's okay.</i>

599
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,500
<i>That's sweet.</i>

600
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:19,708
<i>What is he?
Your boyfriend?</i>

601
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:24,375
<i>You're a child.</i>

602
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:26,208
<i>An infant.</i>

603
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:28,458
<i>Your mocking is thus infantile.</i>

604
00:59:28,541 --> 00:59:30,083
<i>He's not my boyfriend.</i>

605
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:33,375
<i>This man is more to me
than you can dream.</i>

606
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:37,958
<i>He's the moon when I'm lost in darkness
and warmth when I shiver in cold.</i>

607
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,500
<i>And his kiss still thrills me,
even after a millennia.</i>

608
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,708
<i>His heart overflows with the kindness
of which this world is not worthy of.</i>

609
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:49,416
<i>I love this man beyond measure and reason.
He's not my boyfriend.</i>

610
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:55,416
<i>He's all and he's more.</i>

611
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:58,541
<i>You're an incurable romantic.</i>

612
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:25,291
<i>I don't suppose it would be possible
to get these chains off of us?</i>

613
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:27,833
<i>Get 'em out! Get 'em out!
Get 'em on the plane now!</i>

614
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,000
<i>I guess not.</i>

615
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,291
<i>We are usually
a better judge of character.</i>

616
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:38,875
<i>I suppose you are taking us
to the person who paid for your betrayal.</i>

617
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:41,666
<i>It's a nice plane.</i>

618
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:44,500
<i>There's a TV, Joe.</i>

619
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:46,083
<i>Champagne?</i>

620
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:05,666
<i>What is this place?</i>

621
01:02:06,416 --> 01:02:07,625
<i>An abandoned mine.</i>

622
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,375
<i>We stumbled on it
during the Baussenque Wars.</i>

623
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:14,291
<i>1150s maybe?</i>

624
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,250
<i>I used to keep my stuff here.</i>

625
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
<i>Here...</i>

626
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:00,625
<i>Is this a Rodin?</i>

627
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:02,750
<i>Yeah.</i>

628
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:05,958
<i>This is an honest-to-God Rodin.</i>

629
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:08,125
<i>Wait.</i>

630
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:09,916
<i>Did you know him?</i>

631
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,500
<i>Probably biblically.</i>

632
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,416
<i>Get to work finding Copley.</i>

633
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,541
<i>He's got Nicky and Joe.</i>

634
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:31,708
<i>It can hardly be unique
if they can make another copy.</i>

635
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,750
<i>I've got to go.</i>

636
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:40,833
<i>Ah! Gentlemen, welcome.</i>

637
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:43,833
<i>I am truly honored to meet you.</i>

638
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:46,000
<i>Together,
we shall do such things.</i>

639
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:47,416
<i>What they are yet,
I know not,</i>

640
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,708
<i>but they shall be
the terrors of the Earth.</i>

641
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:51,541
<i>Or, um, rather the saviors.</i>

642
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,500
<i>Lear...</i>

643
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,291
<i>Shakespeare.</i>

644
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,500
<i>Um, can we take the cuffs off?</i>

645
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:01,291
<i>No, sir.
We can't.</i>

646
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,333
<i>My apologies.
Let's get off on the right foot, shall we?</i>

647
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:08,250
<i>I'm Steven Merrick,
youngest CEO in pharma.</i>

648
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:10,875
<i>Our work here is all about balance.</i>

649
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:15,500
<i>How do we push the scientific frontiers
whilst also turning a little profit?</i>

650
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:18,583
<i>There's your balance, asshole.</i>

651
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:22,625
Mr. Merrick?
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

652
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:23,708
<i>Watch it.</i>

653
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:28,250
<i>Mr. Copley provided me
with footage of your unique talent,</i>

654
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:32,250
<i>but I prefer my evidence
to be indisputable.</i>

655
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:34,250
<i>No!</i>

656
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,125
<i>Mr. Merrick!</i>

657
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:38,583
<i>God damn it! Ugh!</i>

658
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,875
<i>Shit!</i>

659
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:45,541
<i>What do you see?</i>

660
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:48,413
<i>The Nobel Prize.</i>

661
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,458
<i>And a fair few quid to boot.</i>

662
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:57,541
<i>We brought a cancer drug
to the market last quarter.</i>

663
01:04:57,625 --> 01:05:01,208
<i>It's already saved
hundreds of thousands of lives.</i>

664
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:04,625
<i>Yet, in development,
it killed a quarter of a million lab mice.</i>

665
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:08,458
<i>Now, I didn't ask
for their little permissions.</i>

666
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:09,958
<i>I'm not gonna ask for yours.</i>

667
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:12,208
<i>He thinks you're a mouse, Nicky.</i>

668
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:15,125
<i>There's genetic code inside you</i>

669
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:17,375
<i>which could help
every human being on Earth.</i>

670
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:19,833
<i>We're morally obliged to take it.</i>

671
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:20,958
<i>What?</i>

672
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:23,958
- What is that? Wait!
<i>- Hey!</i>

673
01:05:28,666 --> 01:05:29,666
<i>No!</i>

674
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:35,978
<i>I'll keep you informed of my progress.</i>

675
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,000
<i>Yes. Yes, you do that.</i>

676
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:46,708
<i>Mr. Merrick...</i>

677
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,958
<i>this is about science,</i>

678
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:51,666
<i>not profits...</i>

679
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,750
<i>or sadism.</i>

680
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:55,500
<i>You owe me two more.</i>

681
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:06,791
<i>Come on, Book.
You've been working on that for hours.</i>

682
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:08,291
<i>He's a security expert.</i>

683
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:10,750
<i>He leaves no footprints.
It's gonna take time.</i>

684
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,083
<i>You got a satellite link?</i>

685
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
<i>Yeah.</i>

686
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:17,583
<i>Follow the money.</i>

687
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:19,291
<i>Whoever he's working for, maybe?</i>

688
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:22,500
<i>That's how we track militants.</i>

689
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:33,625
<i>I'm sure you already tried that.</i>

690
01:06:33,708 --> 01:06:35,583
<i>Yeah, it won't hurt to try again.</i>

691
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,083
<i>You know how it works, Nile.</i>

692
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:41,833
<i>Get some sleep while you can.</i>

693
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,666
<i>I brought you a change of clothes.</i>

694
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:49,625
<i>I'm going out for a bit.</i>

695
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,125
<i>- Are you all right, boss?</i>
- Yeah.

696
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,541
<i>Just because we keep living
doesn't mean we stop hurting.</i>

697
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:28,833
<i>Why us?</i>

698
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:30,708
<i>Yeah.</i>

699
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:35,333
<i>That way madness lies.</i>

700
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:38,041
<i>I thought you were
the brains of this outfit.</i>

701
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:45,041
<i>Tell you what I do wonder...</i>

702
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:48,583
<i>is why you?</i>

703
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,166
<i>And why now?</i>

704
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:56,416
<i>How old is Andy?</i>

705
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:59,750
<i>Well, she says she...
she doesn't remember.</i>

706
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:03,250
<i>And she may not.
I don't know.</i>

707
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,416
<i>But what I do know
is she was alone for a long time</i>

708
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,916
<i>before she found anyone like her.</i>

709
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:10,500
<i>A very long time.</i>

710
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:13,125
<i>What about you? You have someone?</i>

711
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:17,000
<i>Just my family.</i>

712
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:25,916
<i>I had three sons.</i>

713
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,208
<i>And the youngest one,
Jean-Pierre...</i>

714
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:33,708
<i>was the last one to die.</i>

715
01:08:33,791 --> 01:08:35,250
<i>He was 42 when...</i>

716
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:38,333
<i>cancer took him.</i>

717
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,208
<i>The only way is forward now.</i>

718
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:43,291
<i>What do you mean?</i>

719
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:46,916
<i>You'll always and forever
be the young woman right there...</i>

720
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,625
<i>but everyone around you,</i>

721
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:52,000
<i>everyone you love...</i>

722
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:54,458
<i>is gonna grow old,</i>

723
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:57,375
<i>is gonna...</i>

724
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:59,333
<i>is gonna suffer and is gonna die.</i>

725
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,000
<i>And if you try to...</i>

726
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:10,958
<i>if you try to touch their lives...</i>

727
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:14,041
<i>well, they will get to
learn your secret.</i>

728
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,725
<i>They will beg you to share it with them,
and you won't be able to.</i>

729
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:21,625
<i>And they won't believe you,
of course.</i>

730
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:26,833
<i>And they will tell you...</i>

731
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:30,041
<i>that you don't love them.</i>

732
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,416
<i>That your love is weak...</i>

733
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,166
<i>or selfish.</i>

734
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:39,416
<i>And you will never forget...</i>

735
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:42,666
<i>the hate...</i>

736
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,875
<i>and despair in their eyes.</i>

737
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:52,125
<i>And you will know what it is to lose...</i>

738
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:59,083
<i>everyone you've ever loved.</i>

739
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:01,750
<i>Do you have a bathroom?</i>

740
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:03,916
<i>No.</i>

741
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,208
<i>But we have a storeroom.</i>

742
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:13,833
<i>Do you need help?</i>

743
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:38,583
<i>Stitches would be better, but...</i>

744
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:39,875
<i>this will help.</i>

745
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:42,041
<i>You haven't asked.</i>

746
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:44,375
<i>Your business is yours.</i>

747
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:49,166
<i>You need help.</i>

748
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:51,416
<i>What does it matter why?</i>

749
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:55,791
<i>Today, I put this on your wound.</i>

750
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:56,875
<i>Tomorrow...</i>

751
01:11:58,125 --> 01:11:59,875
<i>you help someone up when they fall.</i>

752
01:12:03,916 --> 01:12:05,333
<i>We're not meant to be alone.</i>

753
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,250
<i>There.</i>

754
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,458
<i>This should do.</i>

755
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:26,166
<i>Thank you.</i>

756
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:00,833
Andromache, help me!

757
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:02,916
<i>Why won't it stop?</i>

758
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:05,500
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

759
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:06,583
<i>Lykon.</i>

760
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:09,583
<i>It's time.</i>

761
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,583
<i>It's impossible.</i>

762
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:14,541
It...

763
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:15,708
<i>It's time.</i>

764
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,041
<i>How long will the testing take?</i>

765
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:38,500
<i>Until we have results we can replicate.</i>

766
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:44,833
<i>Do you feel the wound trying to close?</i>

767
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,333
<i>You don't need them for that.</i>

768
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,333
<i>You've got the samples,
blood, tissue, DNA.</i>

769
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:54,458
<i>Well, you know
the concept of proprietary data,</i>

770
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:56,333
<i>and they're the product.</i>

771
01:13:58,041 --> 01:14:01,083
<i>They go in the vault.
They stay there under lock and key.</i>

772
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,333
<i>For... ever?</i>

773
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:07,125
<i>We can't have them strolling back out
into the world...</i>

774
01:14:07,916 --> 01:14:09,791
<i>into my competitors' laps.</i>

775
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,291
<i>If this takes years,
maybe decades,</i>

776
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,041
<i>what does it matter to them?</i>

777
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:20,041
<i>If we can unlock their genetic code,
the world will be begging us for the key.</i>

778
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:22,666
<i>Remarkable.</i>

779
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:28,125
<i>You will not be able
to give him what he wants.</i>

780
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:30,000
<i>You think I go too far?</i>

781
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:32,458
<i>That I am unethical?</i>

782
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:34,291
<i>I would say immoral.</i>

783
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:38,250
<i>I believe this can change the world.</i>

784
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:40,375
<i>A fine justification.</i>

785
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:43,291
<i>I've heard it so many times before.</i>

786
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:02,000
<i>As much as I like watching you sleep,
I'm glad you're awake.</i>

787
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,291
<i>Bed head?</i>

788
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:09,375
<i>Nicely tousled.</i>

789
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:18,041
<i>Do you know,
I was thinking about Malta.</i>

790
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:20,833
<i>What time in Malta?</i>

791
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:26,500
<i>Oh, that time in Malta.</i>

792
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,980
<i>We should go back there.</i>

793
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:36,208
<i>That would be nice.</i>

794
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:10,318
<i>Your mom and brother?</i>

795
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,000
<i>You have my phone?</i>

796
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:24,916
<i>Where's your father?</i>

797
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,333
<i>Killed in action when I was 11.</i>

798
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:33,833
<i>Here...</i>

799
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:42,708
<i>My mom, she was drowning after he died.</i>

800
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:44,916
<i>South Side of Chicago,</i>

801
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,416
<i>a million different ways
we could have went left.</i>

802
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:50,375
<i>She fought for us.</i>

803
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,583
<i>Never backed down.</i>

804
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:55,416
<i>Never let us back down either.</i>

805
01:16:58,416 --> 01:16:59,750
<i>You come from warriors.</i>

806
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:01,958
<i>Yeah.</i>

807
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
<i>I do.</i>

808
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:09,583
<i>I can't remember
what my mother looked like.</i>

809
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:14,041
<i>Or my sisters.</i>

810
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:18,791
<i>None of them.</i>

811
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:22,166
<i>Time steals it all away,
I guess.</i>

812
01:17:24,041 --> 01:17:25,791
<i>It's not what time steals...</i>

813
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:29,208
<i>it's what it leaves behind.</i>

814
01:17:32,833 --> 01:17:34,041
<i>Things you can't forget.</i>

815
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:38,541
<i>I gave up searching for her.</i>

816
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,666
<i>I made Quynh a promise
and I broke it.</i>

817
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:55,416
<i>I'm getting Joe and Nicky back.</i>

818
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:00,208
<i>Whatever it takes.</i>

819
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:04,708
<i>"Whatever it takes"?</i>

820
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:11,041
<i>Yes.</i>

821
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:13,000
<i>Guys, I found something.</i>

822
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:15,166
<i>An address just outside of London.</i>

823
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:22,958
<i>We gotta go.</i>

824
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:02,375
<i>Go scout the back.</i>

825
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:13,833
<i>I can't do this.</i>

826
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,333
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

827
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:18,000
<i>I mean,
I'm not doing this.</i>

828
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:23,375
<i>You're one of us now.</i>

829
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:25,583
<i>We would do the same for you.</i>

830
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:28,208
<i>- I never even had a choice.
- None of us had a choice.</i>

831
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:30,083
<i>There isn't a choice.</i>

832
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:32,166
<i>The day I died,</i>

833
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:36,083
<i>I killed the guy that killed me.</i>

834
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:40,208
<i>They try to condition us,
you know?</i>

835
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:42,708
<i>Thousands of hours of training.</i>

836
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:44,291
<i>Two shots, quick kill.</i>

837
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:48,791
<i>But they can't teach you how
to live with it.</i>

838
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:50,833
<i>You've gotta feel it, Nile.</i>

839
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:53,166
<i>Every one.</i>

840
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:55,333
<i>I saw what you did
in that church.</i>

841
01:19:57,208 --> 01:19:58,833
<i>All those bodies.</i>

842
01:19:59,916 --> 01:20:01,458
<i>Is that supposed to be me?</i>

843
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,083
<i>Is that what we're supposed to do,
and we don't even know why?</i>

844
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:08,291
<i>You think knowing
is gonna make you sleep better at night?</i>

845
01:20:09,291 --> 01:20:10,541
<i>I can't be that.</i>

846
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:14,875
<i>My family,</i>

847
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:18,375
<i>they're gonna get old and I won't,</i>

848
01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:21,458
<i>but it'll be years
before they realize that.</i>

849
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:25,833
<i>I still have time with them.</i>

850
01:20:29,916 --> 01:20:30,916
<i>Here.</i>

851
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:34,458
<i>Take the car,</i>

852
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:37,333
<i>and when you ditch it, ditch the weapons.</i>

853
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,500
<i>You gonna be okay?</i>

854
01:20:42,916 --> 01:20:43,916
<i>Always.</i>

855
01:20:57,166 --> 01:20:58,166
<i>Where's Nile?</i>

856
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:01,541
<i>You and me, Book.
Now and always.</i>

857
01:21:09,208 --> 01:21:11,088
<i>Guildford station in one mile.</i>

858
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:41,916
<i>Empty?</i>

859
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,250
<i>Shit.</i>

860
01:21:51,875 --> 01:21:52,958
<i>Andy.</i>

861
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:27,250
<i>Where are they?</i>

862
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,416
<i>Andromache the Scythian.</i>

863
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:35,541
<i>The eternal warrior.</i>

864
01:22:37,166 --> 01:22:38,666
<i>- Book?
- I'm right here.</i>

865
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:48,541
<i>Where are Joe and Nicky?</i>

866
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:55,750
<i>What are you doing?</i>

867
01:22:55,833 --> 01:22:56,833
<i>Calm down.</i>

868
01:22:56,875 --> 01:22:58,541
<i>- What are you doing?
- Andy, calm down!</i>

869
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:00,833
<i>No!</i>

870
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:05,458
<i>Shh.</i>

871
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:07,375
<i>You set us up?</i>

872
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:10,708
<i>Please listen.</i>

873
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:13,125
<i>When my wife died,</i>

874
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:15,458
<i>I devoted myself to your work.</i>

875
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:19,166
<i>I learned your secret history,</i>

876
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,541
<i>written in the margins...</i>

877
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:23,375
<i>passed on like legend.</i>

878
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:28,208
<i>What was dismissed as a myth was,
in fact, immortality.</i>

879
01:23:29,166 --> 01:23:32,125
<i>You could help end...
needless suffering.</i>

880
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:44,833
<i>Humanity needs you to share your gifts.</i>

881
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:49,541
<i>Humanity can screw itself.</i>

882
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:55,916
Andy...
<i>Don't, you fucking coward.</i>

883
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:01,666
<i>Why?</i>

884
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:04,083
<i>Why, Book?</i>

885
01:24:04,166 --> 01:24:06,291
<i>- Andy, listen...
- Why?</i>

886
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:11,000
<i>If Merrick can discover
how we keep living,</i>

887
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:13,416
<i>he might find a way how to end it.</i>

888
01:24:18,208 --> 01:24:19,208
<i>Hey.</i>

889
01:24:20,208 --> 01:24:21,375
<i>That's what you wanted.</i>

890
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:24,500
<i>Oh, Book.
What have you done?</i>

891
01:24:28,666 --> 01:24:30,333
<i>Not like this, Book.</i>

892
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:35,892
What's going on?

893
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:37,500
<i>You're still bleeding.</i>

894
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,208
<i>You're still bleeding.</i>

895
01:24:40,833 --> 01:24:42,375
<i>What? Shit.</i>

896
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:43,458
<i>She's not healing.</i>

897
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:45,684
<i>- What?
- Look at this. She's not healing.</i>

898
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:48,291
<i>Go get something.
Go on! Go on!</i>

899
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:52,125
<i>Andy, look at me.</i>

900
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:53,833
<i>Look at me.</i>

901
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,166
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

902
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:02,083
<i>It wouldn't have changed anything.</i>

903
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,541
<i>Hurry up!</i>

904
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:06,541
<i>Come on.</i>

905
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:07,625
<i>Careful.</i>

906
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:10,091
Get her out of here.

907
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:13,166
<i>Secure him.</i>

908
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,541
<i>Nice work, Copley.</i>

909
01:25:17,625 --> 01:25:18,666
<i>Look at you.</i>

910
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:21,041
<i>She's wounded.
Gunshot.</i>

911
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:22,333
<i>Why isn't she healing?</i>

912
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:24,208
<i>I don't know.</i>

913
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:26,833
<i>She's not immortal.</i>

914
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:31,625
<i>- What do you mean, "not immortal?"
- I mean it's gone.</i>

915
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:41,541
<i>You're a bloody mess.</i>

916
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:47,208
<i>Now, how old are you?</i>

917
01:25:50,375 --> 01:25:52,208
<i>Come closer and I'll tell you.</i>

918
01:25:55,708 --> 01:25:57,083
<i>Let's get them home.</i>

919
01:25:58,375 --> 01:26:00,015
- Let her go.
<i>- Cover me.</i>

920
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:02,333
No! No!
Let her go!

921
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:06,000
<i>Get her up.</i>

922
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:09,541
<i>No!</i>

923
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:13,088
<i>I'm sorry, Andy.</i>

924
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,000
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

925
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:18,684
Hold him still.

926
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:24,625
<i>Mr. Merrick, look. If it's true and
she's somehow not immortal anymore,</i>

927
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:26,583
<i>then she might not survive the testing.</i>

928
01:26:26,666 --> 01:26:30,333
<i>- This will be murder.
- As if the CIA never disappeared anyone.</i>

929
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:32,708
<i>As if they never conducted
covert research.</i>

930
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:33,791
<i>No.</i>

931
01:26:34,666 --> 01:26:36,083
<i>No, this is not what we agreed.</i>

932
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:38,625
<i>We don't stop.</i>

933
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:50,041
<i>Andy.</i>

934
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:53,291
<i>What happened?</i>

935
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:55,583
<i>She's not healing.</i>

936
01:26:57,958 --> 01:26:58,958
<i>I killed her.</i>

937
01:27:06,666 --> 01:27:08,833
<i>I need to get a line in her
and stop the bleeding.</i>

938
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:11,125
<i>Keep her alive at all costs.</i>

939
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:15,166
<i>Don't you see? Between Sudan and now,
something's changed.</i>

940
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:18,083
<i>- Find out what.
- This will stabilize her,</i>

941
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:19,791
<i>but I have to stitch her</i>

942
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:22,000
<i>- and give her antibiotics.</i>
- Good.

943
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:23,833
<i>All things die.</i>

944
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:26,750
<i>What was that?</i>

945
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:29,125
<i>Everything has to die, Mr. Merrick.</i>

946
01:27:31,708 --> 01:27:33,291
<i>The only reason we haven't...</i>

947
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:35,750
<i>is that it's not our time yet.</i>

948
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:40,125
<i>If it's now Andromache's,
nothing you can do will stop it.</i>

949
01:27:40,208 --> 01:27:42,833
<i>You'd be surprised by
what my products can do.</i>

950
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:48,750
<i>I will carve slices off you for years
to get what I want.</i>

951
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:51,875
<i>Your time is coming.</i>

952
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:53,375
<i>As is yours.</i>

953
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:00,208
<i>I expect results!</i>

954
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:04,958
<i>Andy.</i>

955
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,875
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

956
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,916
<i>Are you Copley?</i>

957
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,166
<i>- He sent you to finish me off.
- Who?</i>

958
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:24,583
<i>Where's Andy and Booker?</i>

959
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:25,916
<i>Who are you?</i>

960
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:28,791
<i>Ahh!</i>

961
01:28:28,875 --> 01:28:31,083
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

962
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:33,625
<i>You're another one.</i>

963
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:36,416
<i>Yeah. I'm new.</i>

964
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:39,458
<i>- Where are they?
- They're in a lab...</i>

965
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:40,875
<i>being tested.</i>

966
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:43,958
<i>Tortured.</i>

967
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:45,708
<i>Merrick...</i>

968
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:47,916
<i>he only cares about her immortality,</i>

969
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:51,041
<i>not what she's done with it.</i>

970
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:52,791
<i>"What she's done with it"?</i>

971
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:55,833
<i>Montenegro, 1916.</i>

972
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:58,541
<i>She saved a family of refugees
whose daughter would discover</i>

973
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:00,791
<i>the technique
for the early detection of diabetes.</i>

974
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:03,125
<i>This one...</i>

975
01:29:03,208 --> 01:29:07,625
<i>Her grandson would save 317 people
from the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.</i>

976
01:29:08,291 --> 01:29:09,291
<i>This guy...</i>

977
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:12,958
<i>This man prevented
an accidental nuclear exchange in 1978</i>

978
01:29:13,041 --> 01:29:15,458
<i>and likely saved civilization
as a result.</i>

979
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:18,666
<i>The famous...</i>

980
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:21,666
<i>and the unknown names.</i>

981
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:26,875
<i>She saves a life,</i>

982
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:29,916
<i>two, three generations later,
we reap the benefits.</i>

983
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:36,000
<i>She's in it.</i>

984
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,041
<i>She can't see it.</i>

985
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,708
<i>But you could.</i>

986
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,750
<i>You could and you gave them up.</i>

987
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:50,375
<i>I thought it could be
the end of disease.</i>

988
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:54,291
<i>I thought it could be
the end of suffering.</i>

989
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:01,666
<i>She couldn't talk...</i>

990
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:04,333
<i>at the end...</i>

991
01:30:04,916 --> 01:30:05,916
<i>my wife.</i>

992
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:09,916
<i>She couldn't breathe.</i>

993
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:12,666
<i>I couldn't do...</i>

994
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:14,291
<i>anything.</i>

995
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:18,708
<i>It was supposed to be a gift...</i>

996
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:21,541
<i>to the world.</i>

997
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,666
<i>It wasn't your gift to give.</i>

998
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,458
<i>Why would the immortality end?</i>

999
01:30:33,125 --> 01:30:34,125
<i>What?</i>

1000
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,416
<i>She wouldn't stop bleeding.</i>

1001
01:30:39,083 --> 01:30:40,208
<i>Is she alive?</i>

1002
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:42,916
<i>I know where they are.</i>

1003
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:20,250
<i>There's no cameras here.</i>

1004
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:23,053
<i>That's how he gets people
in and out unseen.</i>

1005
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,333
- How many shooters on site?
<i>- At least 30.</i>

1006
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,416
<i>Their boss, Keane, is ex-Special Forces.</i>

1007
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,250
<i>What kind of CEO rolls around
with his own personal army?</i>

1008
01:31:32,666 --> 01:31:34,583
<i>These days?</i>

1009
01:31:35,083 --> 01:31:36,083
<i>Most of them.</i>

1010
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:38,583
<i>- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna make this right.</i>

1011
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:40,250
<i>Your dying won't do that.</i>

1012
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:43,208
<i>But I'm supposed to let you
walk in there by yourself?</i>

1013
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:44,416
<i>Out of the two of us,</i>

1014
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,333
<i>I'm the one
who will walk out of there again,</i>

1016

<i>You got me here.</i>

1017
01:31:59,416 --> 01:32:01,416
<i>There's a private lab on the 15th floor.</i>

<i>It's empty.</i>
