1
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,394
You have very beautiful toes.

2
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:01,896
- Did I ever tell you that?
- Yes, you have.

3
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,150
I'm not even... I'm not even a foot guy.

4
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,777
- They're not even webbed.
- Are you concentrating on the game,

5
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:11,448
or are you just lusting after
the feet of your soon-to-be wife?

6
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,199
I'm concentrating.

7
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,997
Carl, it's Neil. Are you there?

8
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,623
No, we're not.

9
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:24,002
Carl. It's Neil. There's a problem.

10
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:26,546
There's a wedding-related problem.

11
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,465
All right, go. Get it.

12
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,967
Hey.

13
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,179
I hear you whispering
about not answering me.

14
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:37,474
Just remember, when this is all over

15
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,393
it's just you and me.

16
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:46,733
Carl, if you're humping, stop,
'cause I'm coming in.

17
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,110
Dude, it's Dupree.

18
00:01:57,577 --> 00:02:00,121
How the hell did Dupree end up
on the wrong island?

19
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:02,373
Dupree was born on the wrong island.

20
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,589
Gentlemen, move this out of the way,
please! We're coming through.

21
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:10,799
Thank you very much. Right this way, please.

22
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:11,966
Careful with the boxes.

23
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,551
Ten minutes ago
those were supposed to be out.

24
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,512
Where's Mr. Thompson?

25
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,191
Dad, this is incredible.

26
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,943
We really didn't need all this.

27
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:32,111
I know. But I did.

28
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,454
Dupree!

29
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,624
There he is.

30
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:47,001
Did other people land on the wrong island?

31
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:49,712
Guys, I know I'm in the doghouse,
but come on.

32
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:53,633
These islands, Maui, Cowee, Lenowi,
very easy to get mixed up.

33
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,051
Don't worry, you're here. Don't worry.

34
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,928
I got my head turned around. I'm sorry.

35
00:02:57,387 --> 00:03:00,014
- Come here, you big lug.
- All right.

36
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,601
THOMPSON; Thank you.

37
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:06,521
Folks, this is a bittersweet time for me.

38
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:10,525
A day that Molly's mother, rest her soul,
and I used to dream about.

39
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,820
On one hand,
I'm inheriting a new son-in-law,

40
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:17,323
but on the other,

41
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:19,742
Daddy's losing his only little girl.

42
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,372
Now, when Molly told me
that she was gonna marry Carl,

43
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,041
I said, "Who?"

44
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,502
And Molly said, "Daddy, he works for you."

45
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:32,672
I said, "Honey,
I've got 1,200 employees nationwide."

46
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,549
But then I started to worry.

47
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:37,969
Maybe he was some young buck
trying to push me aside,

48
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,346
grab the reins of my company.

49
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:46,728
And then I met Carl, sitting in cubicle 26.

50
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:51,691
And I said, "You know, I like my chances."

51
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,194
So, ladies and gentlemen,
will you raise your glass

52
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:58,323
- to Molly and Carl, to health and happiness.
- He's funny.

53
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,532
Cheers.

54
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,700
Hear! Hear!

55
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:12,211
One! Two! Three! Carl!

56
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,592
Hey, everybody, listen up.

57
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,552
Now, wait. Just wait.

58
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:23,431
In honor of your impending nuptials,

59
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:28,269
I want to perform a feat
that I've used to mark every special occasion

60
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:30,563
in our lives since at least high school.

61
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:33,232
Ladies and gentlemen, birds and bees,

62
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:36,861
I present to you the Flaming Tornado!

63
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,868
- Honey, look who's here!
- Hi!

64
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,704
This is just a safety precaution.

65
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,291
Okay. Little room here. Need to focus.

66
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,878
Barkeep, your finest Kentucky bourbon,
low-grade tequila...

67
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:55,421
I've got a mai tai.

68
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:59,133
- Don't let him start till I get back.
- ...lemon slices, a funnel,

69
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,551
and an open flame.

70
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:02,053
Yeah!

71
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,265
Okay. Funnel.

72
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,394
Tornado! Tornado!

73
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,729
Open flames. Carl will have the honor.

74
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:14,691
Will the groom please light the liquid?

75
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:17,986
Carl, grab this. Carl, you got... Where...

76
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,158
What are you doing? Do the Tornado.

77
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,786
- Maybe later.
- No!

78
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,496
- No.
- What are you doing, man?

79
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,206
No, we'll do it later.

80
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,457
Do it now!

81
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,292
- Carl has to be here.
- Now!

82
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,628
Let Carl come and do it. Dude.

83
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,464
I'm doing the Tornado, bitch!

84
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,717
Do that Tornado!

85
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,555
Neil! Neil! Neil!

86
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,270
Oh, my God!

87
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,738
Yo, Tornado Man.

88
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,199
This one is for you, my brother.

89
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,617
Nice one.

90
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:12,707
Well, I guess this is where
the road ends for you and me.

91
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,876
We had a good run, though, didn't we?

92
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,463
Hey, Dupree, I'm not dying.
I'm just getting married.

93
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:22,258
Yeah, I know. Hey, listen.

94
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:26,888
I feel bad about, you know,
earlier when I was laughing like a hyena

95
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:29,098
when Mr. Thompson
was making all those jokes at your expense.

96
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:31,476
- Well, they weren't really at my expense.
- No, no, no, they were.

97
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,603
- It was a shot across your bow.
- Yeah? You think?

98
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:35,605
It wasn't that funny. I mean, it was,

99
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:38,441
but I shouldn't have been laughing,
'cause I'm your best man,

100
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:41,110
and I don't want this guy
getting in your head, okay?

101
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:42,612
'Cause he's in my head a little bit.

102
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:45,073
It just... It's... I don't know.
I don't want you to forget

103
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,450
that you're bringing something
to the table, too, okay?

104
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,453
You've got that... That Carlness.

105
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,121
That little twinkle in your eye.

106
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:53,414
And you're giving it to me right now.

107
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,958
That little glint that says
they're never gonna beat you.

108
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,377
They can't lay a glove on you.

109
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:01,380
And don't forget that,
because you can't put a price tag on it.

110
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:02,548
End of sermon.

111
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:05,009
Well, thanks, buddy, I appreciate it.

112
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,304
But, you know, I really think
he was kidding around.

113
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,430
Yeah.

114
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,265
Guy's got a kind of a weird sense of humor.

115
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:15,061
Besides, it's not like I'm gonna be
working for him for the rest of my life.

116
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:17,563
You know, I got plans of my own.

117
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:21,359
There it is. There's that Carlness.

118
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,861
They can't lay a glove on you, can they?

119
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:26,823
God, I admire you. I really do.

120
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,783
That's no secret.

121
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,995
Thanks, buddy. Thanks.

122
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:38,709
Oh, I wanted to give you this.

123
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,505
You know, for being my best man.

124
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,303
You got to be shitting me. It's a flask!

125
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:50,805
- You like it?
- I love this.

126
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,014
Good.

127
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,599
Hey, you know, that reminds me
of the groomsmen outfits.

128
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:54,809
I really like them, but I'm wondering,

129
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,270
should mine be a little different
since I'm the best man?

130
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:58,604
What did you have in mind?

131
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:00,398
Just like a little insignia or a patch.

132
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:01,858
I don't want people to be confused.

133
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:03,234
I'm talking something understated,

134
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,777
like a lightning bolt. Nothing big.

135
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,696
- Lightning bolt?
- Something.

136
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,117
- Could be cool.
- Yeah. I like it.

137
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:16,831
Although, it is going to be listed
in the program that you're the best man.

138
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:18,958
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

139
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,669
That's pretty good. Okay.

140
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,297
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That should be enough.

141
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:30,219
Now, is Neil gonna be okay over there?

142
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:33,472
I'm seeing him,
and it looks like the tide's coming up.

143
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:37,018
Neil's gonna be fine.

144
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,366
Bingo!

145
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:30,238
Oh, wow! How many thank-you
notes do you think we have to write?

146
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:32,573
Well, I counted 111.

147
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:35,201
Honey, I'm gonna do half of them.

148
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:38,663
- Oh, come on. Really?
- No, no, no. Really.

149
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,375
Dear whoever gave us this platter, I love it!

150
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,087
Finally a platter. Just what I always wanted
ever since I was a little boy.

151
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,465
And now you've made
my platter dreams come true.

152
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:53,469
That's perfect.
And then you write 55 more just like that,

153
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,304
- and you're done.
- Yeah.

154
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,641
<i>MOLLY.' Hi, this is Carl.</i>

155
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,102
- And this is Molly.
- Molly.

156
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,813
- We can't get to the phone right now.
- You've reached the Petersons.

157
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,023
- So, if you leave a message...
- Wait for the beep.

158
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,858
- ...we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
- All right...

159
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,111
Have a beautiful day.

160
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,990
- All right, let's do it again.
- No. That was really cute.

161
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:16,575
- I called you Carl. It was really funny.
- Molly, it was cheesy.

162
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,744
No, it wasn't cheesy.

163
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:20,663
- Give it to me.
- It's totally cheesy.

164
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,790
- Give me the machine.
- No! It's good cheesy!

165
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,625
- Give me the machine.
- No!

166
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:30,131
- ID?
- Hey, married guy, how you doing?

167
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:31,340
Good morning, Reese.

168
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:33,676
- ID?
- Top of the morning, Paco.

169
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,111
So, we're back from the honeymoon.

170
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,612
Oh, yeah, we...

171
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,865
We had a great time, sir. It was just...

172
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,326
It was really wonderful.

173
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:01,579
So I took a look at your proposal
while you were gone.

174
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:05,708
- The Oaks at Mesa Vista.
- You like it?

175
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,127
Did I like it? I loved it!

176
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,338
It's perfect for lot 208.

177
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:14,550
208? It's huge.

178
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,221
If I may, Mr. Thompson, it...

179
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:25,770
Mesa Vista is really
more of a smaller, 40-unit eco-community.

180
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,981
Not anymore, Carl.
You got to think big, you got to think bold.

181
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:31,942
You're a married man now.
You're married to my little girl.

182
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:34,737
I'm fast-tracking this project. And you, sir,

183
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,655
you're the lead designer on it.

184
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,574
- Excuse me, sir?
- That's right.

185
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,785
You are the lead designer.

186
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,831
Wow, that's... Wow, that's... That's great.

187
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,876
What happened to Harrison?

188
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,586
I had to let him go while you were gone.

189
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,463
I had a little problem with Rancho del Mar.

190
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:56,133
But, Carl, I believe in you.

191
00:11:56,884 --> 00:12:01,555
You've got it. It's here and it's here.

192
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:07,019
- Release it.
- Okay. I'll do that, sir.

193
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,236
Release it.

194
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,870
Wow! I can't believe it.
He made you lead designer.

195
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:27,623
Yeah. Apparently, he just loved my proposal

196
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,626
And it's a little bit bigger
than I initially planned,

197
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,378
but you know, hey,
maybe that's a good thing.

198
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,587
So, what does this mean?

199
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,756
Well, it means I've got my own office.

200
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,300
<i>Which is really great. Oh, and it's got a view.</i>

201
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:42,304
A view of trees and some cars.
It's just terrific, and...

202
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:44,473
Living the dream, honey. Living the dream.

203
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:47,017
<i>Wow. Maybe we can celebrate</i>

204
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:50,020
a little when you get home tonight
from guys' night.

205
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,647
Are you trying to seduce me?

206
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,608
<i>All right, I'll see you tonight.</i>

207
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:02,700
- What's up, guys?
- Carl, you made it!

208
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:07,204
- Intense matches going on.
- Guys' night, man!

209
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,167
Hey, there he is! Guys' night!

210
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,086
Can you feel the fun for the guys' night?

211
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,463
I can just feel it, you know?

212
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,965
Shit balls!

213
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:19,967
What's that?

214
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,512
It's my alarm. My hour's up. That's it for me.

215
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:24,972
- What, are you kidding me?
- Bullshit.

216
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,307
Where are you going?

217
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,142
I've got to go meet my wife

218
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:32,771
<i>and watch
Sisterhood of the Traveling Ya-Ya Pants.</i>

219
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:35,649
I don't... How late do you get to stay out?
I used to have midnight.

220
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,027
Do you get midnight?
'Cause I was late once, and...

221
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,238
I'm a grown man, Neil. I don't have a curfew.

222
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,032
Not yet you don't.

223
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:46,744
But in all seriousness,
you got to tell me something, okay?

224
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,372
- Do I smell like beer?
- Yeah.

225
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:53,083
Good. Because you know what
I don't smell like, then?

226
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:56,879
Cigarettes and weed. That one's free.

227
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:58,923
Yeah!

228
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:04,220
The dream continues! Still undefeated!

229
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,804
Yes! Nice.

230
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,682
Will you look at this guy? Look at you.

231
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,267
Is this what it looks like to be married?

232
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:12,228
- Come here, man.
- It's still early on.

233
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,438
To fidelity, commitment, the whole shebang.

234
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:17,316
Yeah, and I also got a promotion today.

235
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:21,987
Add it to the list.
Forever blessed as the dream continues.

236
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,949
- How are you doing, buddy?
- How am I doing?

237
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,700
Good question.

238
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:29,453
Turns out I got fired
for taking that week off to go to the wedding.

239
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,539
Wait a minute. You got fired?

240
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,290
Apparently, I never had authorization.

241
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:35,709
My boss claims he never received my e-mail.

242
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,795
Then I had a little bit of
a cash flow situation,

243
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,422
so I ended up losing my apartment.

244
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:43,008
You're not living out of your car?

245
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:45,135
Carl, I'm not an animal.

246
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,640
Plus, it was a company car.
So when I lost the job...

247
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,433
It's okay. I picked up a ten-speed.

248
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,602
Dave's letting me crash
at the bar after hours.

249
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:56,939
Dupree, you can't sleep in a bar.
We're not in our 20s anymore.

250
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,774
Sure you can. I got a cot set up in the back.

251
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,067
This is ridiculous.

252
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,319
Look, you're gonna come home
and you're going to stay with us.

253
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:04,780
That's sweet of you to say,
but I can't impose, and I won't.

254
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,157
Dupree will land on his feet as always.

255
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:09,660
Can I have a toast, please? Thank you.

256
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,204
Listen, Dupree,
we've got to get rid of the cot.

257
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:15,165
Some of the regulars
are starting to complain.

258
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:19,378
They don't think it's fair
that you get to sleep here and they don't.

259
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,922
Curly said that, didn't he?

260
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,925
- Curly? Curly!
- What?

261
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:27,052
What? You got a problem
with me sleeping on the cot?

262
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,805
We all have a problem
with you sleeping on the cot.

263
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,391
We took a vote. The ayes have it.

264
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,271
- Dupree? Live with us?
- Not live.

265
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,481
Just stay for a couple of days

266
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:40,941
until he gets back on his feet.

267
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,776
Molly, he's been sleeping in a bar.

268
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,446
- How does that happen?
- Who knows? It's Dupree.

269
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:48,324
I mean, I told you. His mother moved
to Florida with that yoga idiot,

270
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,784
and all of his friends are married,
including myself.

271
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:53,954
He's got nowhere to go. He's like an orphan.

272
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,373
Wait a second.

273
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,835
What's all this?

274
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,338
This is that celebration
we were supposed to have

275
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:05,007
- about your promotion.
- Oh, that's right.

276
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,051
I'm sorry, hon.

277
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,970
Look, Molly, let me go outside

278
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:11,472
and tell Dupree to bring his bags in...

279
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:14,016
What? Dupree's here?

280
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,393
Carl! Carl.

281
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,479
Carl.

282
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,399
Okay, look, you're right.

283
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:26,362
I screwed up.
I did this all wrong, and I'm sorry.

284
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,490
I should have called first.

285
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:34,703
You know what? Maybe I should
just give him some money for a motel.

286
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:36,872
Carl. Carl.

287
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,252
He's your best friend. He's here.

288
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,296
- He can stay.
- That's great, Molly.

289
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,840
Look, it's only gonna be for a couple days.

290
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,884
- Well, a week at the most.
- Okay.

291
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,886
After that, he's out of here.

292
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:54,556
Keep those candles burning.
I'll be right back.

293
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,808
Okay.

294
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,066
Hey, Molly.

295
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:07,111
I want you to know
I really, really appreciate this, okay?

296
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,947
- Yeah. No. It's really no problem, Dupree.
- Thanks.

297
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,699
- Nice moose.
- Oh, yeah.

298
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:14,076
Murphy, say hello to the missus.

299
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,494
Hi, Murphy.

300
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,247
- Come on in, buddy. Make yourself at home.
- Great.

301
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,082
I hope the couch is okay 'cause

302
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,418
- we're working on everything upstairs.
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine anyplace.

303
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,378
- And you know where everything is.
- Thank you.

304
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,171
- Great.
- Thanks.

305
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:29,299
Thank you. And, hey, listen,
just to put your minds at ease,

306
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,468
this is not a permanent situation. Okay?

307
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:34,847
I'm hitting the job trail,
I'm gonna hit it hard tomorrow.

308
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,349
Wheels of change are in motion.

309
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,518
Good. Good. That's a good attitude.

310
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,105
Despite what my ex-boss said,
I'm not unhirable.

311
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,482
Those copiers didn't exactly sell themselves.

312
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,443
And frankly,
I think we had an inferior product,

313
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,570
and I'd tell people that if they asked.

314
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,989
I wasn't going to lie for that son of...

315
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,199
I don't want to get started on him, but...

316
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:57,119
Okay, great. Well, make yourself at home,

317
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,288
and Molly and I are...

318
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,124
Well, we're going to go upstairs
and take care of some stuff.

319
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:06,044
Well, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen, we're all adults here.

320
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,213
You're newlyweds.
Making love's a big part of that.

321
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:10,841
You're supposed to explore each other.
I get it.

322
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,092
Come on.

323
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:13,427
If this situation's gonna work,

324
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,137
we've got to be honest with each other.

325
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,515
Now, go on. Enjoy yourselves.
I'm not gonna listen.

326
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,726
Hump away. Go on, get out of here.
Good night.

327
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,977
Okay.

328
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,939
Good night.

329
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,293
I'm kind of dreading the talk
with his parents.

330
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:50,172
He hasn't really been treating
anybody very nicely at...

331
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,766
- That's not good.
- No. Not for us

332
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,018
or our couch.

333
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,715
Computer skills. Not really.

334
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,119
The Oaks at Mesa Vista.

335
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,164
This is exciting, isn't it?

336
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,501
Stunning. Just stunning.

337
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,297
You know, sir,
if we're not gonna have any trees,

338
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,465
maybe we should consider
changing the name.

339
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,302
No. No, no, I love the name.

340
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,637
Names are important, Carl.

341
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:24,808
Are you gonna answer that phone?

342
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,602
Give me a second.

343
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,479
<i>- What do you want?
- Carl, hey.</i>

344
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,481
Real quick, where do you keep the plungers?

345
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,358
A plunger? What do you need a plunger for?

346
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:37,112
No reason. Just want to stay on top of stuff.

347
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,780
What do you mean "no reason"?
What happened?

348
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:41,825
No reason. I just want to know where
things are in case there's an emergency,

349
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,160
which there probably never will be.

350
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,412
I don't have time for this. I'm...

351
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,206
I don't have time for this. I'm at work.
I got to go.

352
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,043
You better make some time for it
'cause we got a little bit of a situation.

353
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,503
I didn't want to have to say anything, but...

354
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,547
Carl?

355
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,426
Just stopped.

356
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:00,844
Where were we?

357
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:04,723
We were talking about names, Carl.
How important they are.

358
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:09,019
Would you ever consider
letting Molly keep her last name?

359
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:13,190
I mean, I know it's a strange request
coming from a father-in-law,

360
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:17,235
but a man's name is his legacy,

361
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,446
and if Molly takes yours,

362
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:22,824
then the Thompson name dies with me.

363
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,328
Well, there's lots of Thompsons around,
aren't there?

364
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,790
Not in a direct line, Carl.
No, no, not in a direct line.

365
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,210
Well, what about our kids?

366
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:39,383
Children should have
the last name of the father, don't you think?

367
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,593
You're having kids?

368
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:45,180
Well, not right now, but eventually.

369
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,395
You know, in certain Asian cultures, Carl,

370
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,689
the husband takes the wife's name.

371
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,400
Wait a minute.
You just said a man's legacy is his name.

372
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,318
All right. What about a hyphen?

373
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,404
- A hyphen?
- Yeah.

374
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,532
I could ask Molly, but I don't think she...

375
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,160
Wait a minute. You mean me.

376
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,246
You mean I'm supposed to hyphenate.

377
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:13,083
Well, then you can still use your own name,
only you'll be hyphenating it. It's win-win.

378
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,460
With all due respect, not for me it isn't, sir.

379
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:18,463
All right, forget it.
You're obviously upset about it.

380
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:21,466
You know what,
I'm sorry I even brought it up.

381
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,514
Let's keep focused on your project.

382
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,984
Come on! Come on! Toshi, what are you
doing? You gave him a meatball!

383
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,152
Watch the car!

384
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:43,572
Throw it, throw it. We got him.

385
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:45,907
Throw it, throw it!

386
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:49,161
Did he touch the plate? He... Oh, here we go.

387
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,997
The game just turned. Yes!

388
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,833
Carl Peterson,
third team honorable mention.

389
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:58,128
All-district, 1984. We get Carl.

390
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,796
- No, we get him.
- Hey, what's going on?

391
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,798
There he is. Hey, sweet heat.

392
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,467
Time to dust off the old jockstrap.

393
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,136
This kid Dougie's been killing us
all afternoon.

394
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,013
We need your arm out there. Let's go.

395
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:12,017
Dupree, I'd love to, but I can't.
I kind of had a rough day.

396
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,811
And I better go in and see Molly.

397
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:19,775
I like it. Family first. Priorities.

398
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:23,028
Okay, he can't play.
We're gonna have to do it ourselves.

399
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,155
Now listen, I want you to
brush him back here, okay?

400
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,323
What's a brush back?

401
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,617
It's where you throw it really close to him.
Scare him a little bit,

402
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,160
but don't hit him
'cause he's bigger than you.

403
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,120
But, Mr. Dupree, I don't even play baseball.

404
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,288
I'm in the orchestra, remember?

405
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:35,373
First of all, call me Dupree
'cause I'm your team-mate.

406
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:37,626
Second of all, so what
if you're in the orchestra.

407
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,086
So was Catfish Hunter.

408
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:42,047
Let's go. Let's go. Here we go! Here we go!
Hey, batter, batter...

409
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,091
Hi! How was work?

410
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,218
It was fine.

411
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,387
- Good fine? Bad fine?
- Fine, fine.

412
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:54,017
You wouldn't believe the response
I'm getting for my Career Day program.

413
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,394
And I saved a spot for you
on the 15th if you're interested.

414
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,896
Yeah, of course.

415
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:01,483
I'll bring in some blueprints
and maybe even some models.

416
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:02,734
- It'll be fun.
- No. Get away.

417
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:03,944
The kids'll really love it.

418
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,445
You hit me! You hit me on purpose!

419
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:06,780
No more fighting. Thank you, that's it!

420
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,407
Hey! Hey! Come on now! Break it up.
That's it!

421
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,494
<i>Hola, you've reached Dupree.</i>

422
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,079
<i>If this is in regards to employment,</i>

423
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:17,499
<i>please be aware that
my Class Four driver's license has expired,</i>

424
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:20,794
<i>and I am no longer willing
to work with asbestos. I won't do it.</i>

425
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:22,796
Can you believe that? A little chin music

426
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,756
and the whole neighborhood goes crazy.

427
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,217
<i>- It was</i> like...
<i>- Oh, and for Carl and Molly, press two</i>

428
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,886
Oh, I meant to tell you about that.

429
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,806
I changed the answering machine
in case somebody calls about a job.

430
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,975
I'm staying on top of this job thing.

431
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,645
You guys are okay with that, right?

432
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:40,772
We got to put the job first.

433
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:45,026
Well, Carl, are we okay with that?

434
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,697
Molly. Molly, come on.

435
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,492
Nice.

436
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:55,620
<i>HBO. Simply the best.</i>

437
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:58,623
- When did we get HBO?
- Yeah, you saw that.

438
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:01,751
I upgraded us,
and I'm going to go halfsies on it

439
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,837
'cause I love it also.

440
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,256
You get it upstairs, too.

441
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,592
I think you get the Oxygen channel, too.

442
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,805
- What? What are you doing?
- What?

443
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,016
What do you want? Cinemax?

444
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:20,228
<i>What do you hear? What do you say?</i>

445
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:25,150
So, let me get this straight.
I mean, he hijacks our answering machine.

446
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:27,736
"Carl and Molly, press two." Okay?

447
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,487
And then he decides,
"Hey, I'm sleeping on the couch,

448
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,072
"and I'm gonna order HBO."

449
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:34,284
I mean, I don't know, Carl. Am I wrong here?

450
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,204
Carl!

451
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:40,540
Molly, what do you want me to do,
whack the guy?

452
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:46,087
Look, I told Dupree not to change anything
without asking,

453
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:48,256
and I gave him a pair of pajamas.

454
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,008
Dupree's gonna get the hang of this.

455
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:54,262
He's never truly been domesticated.
He's like the ape-man of Borneo.

456
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:57,474
Oh, so we're the lucky ones
who get to housebreak him?

457
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,976
No, you know what I mean, honey.

458
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:01,895
I'm over it.

459
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:05,273
I finished my thank-you notes today.

460
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,152
- Do you need help with your half?
- No, no, no, I...

461
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:15,283
Candlesticks, bread maker, Crock-Pot.
I got them covered.

462
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,327
It's my final offer.

463
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,412
No, I got them covered.

464
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,211
Sorry to interrupt. Oh!

465
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,297
- Damn it, Dupree! What is this?
- This is an emergency.

466
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:31,549
I'm sorry. The downstairs crapper,
it's on the fritz again.

467
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:35,303
- What do you mean, "it's on the fritz"?
- I don't know. It's on the fritz.

468
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:38,723
Please tell me he's joking.

469
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,226
We might need some matches.

470
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,438
Does that answer your question?

471
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,734
Oh, God!

472
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:53,655
Dupree! Oh, my God. I don't...

473
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,909
Carl! Carl!

474
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,454
Dupree! Dupree?

475
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,081
Yo!

476
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:06,626
Dupree, what you did
in our bathroom last night was disgusting.

477
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,336
Molly nearly passed out.

478
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,629
I know, I know.

479
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,173
Believe me.
I'm never eating Buffalo wings again.

480
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,718
I don't care how much I love them.
I'm off them.

481
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:18,388
It's weird. I used to have a stomach
like a billy goat, but not anymore.

482
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,099
Now, I made a little breakfast for...
Molly, great.

483
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,434
- Come here.
- Morning.

484
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:23,893
Good morning.

485
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,604
Right here.
Let me get this chair for you here.

486
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:30,150
- Have a seat. Breakfast is served.
- Yes.

487
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,819
I believe Carl told me you're a fan of

488
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:35,989
the banana pancake and the soy macchiato.

489
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,657
One second.

490
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:39,534
I want this to be perfect.

491
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:41,745
Did you tell him all this?

492
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,705
Here you go.

493
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,540
Soy macchiato.

494
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,793
- Dupree, you really didn't have to do all this.
- Yes, I did have to do this.

495
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,962
Look, I know I got off on the wrong foot,

496
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:54,966
and I just want you both to know
that I really appreciate this.

497
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,177
And I'm grateful.

498
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,596
- I don't know what to say, but...
- Don't say anything.

499
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,474
Just accept my apology and enjoy this feast.

500
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:04,976
I'm off to a very promising job interview

501
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,146
which explains my natty attire.
Wish me luck. Goodbye.

502
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,982
- Good luck. Go get them, tiger!
- I will. Thank you.

503
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,777
Off like a prom dress.

504
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,615
So, why don't you
describe yourself, Mr. Dupree.

505
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:21,701
I'm a people person. Very personable.

506
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:24,496
I absolutely insist on enjoying life.

507
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:29,626
Not so task-oriented. I'm not a workhorse.

508
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:33,505
If you're looking for a Clydesdale,
I'm probably not your man.

509
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,507
Like, I don't live to work.

510
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,384
It's more the other way around. I work to live.

511
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:41,012
Incidentally,
what's your policy on Columbus Day?

512
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:44,015
- Yeah, we work.
- Really?

513
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:46,267
The guy discovered the New World.

514
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:49,896
I'm afraid to even ask
about Victory over Japan Day.

515
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:56,194
<i>Eddie. You have a call waiting on line...</i>

516
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,322
Hey, we tried. Right?

517
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:03,410
Thanks a lot. Yeah.

518
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,789
I'm gonna keep my résumé. Excuse me.

519
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,211
You've got to lean into it and commit to it.

520
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:15,588
That's the way. You get hurt if you're afraid.

521
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:18,174
And if you time it just right, then you both...

522
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:21,302
There he goes. Come down.
You guys got to get a rhythm going.

523
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:22,679
Come on.

524
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:26,099
Here, watch me.
See, I'm just running down the ramp.

525
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,892
It's actually harder than on a skateboard.

526
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:30,854
There we go. Speed's your friend. Hold on.

527
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,814
Yeah, come down. Go.

528
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,233
You see how he's timing it?
And then he pops it up? Go!

529
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,569
Yes! Go! One more time.

530
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,028
So, what's going on over here?

531
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:42,532
Carl, check out this badass skate ramp
I had Aaron's dad build for us.

532
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:46,035
Hey, man, I was just telling these guys
how we used to tear it up back in the day

533
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,246
Yep! Pretty good.

534
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:49,414
Hey, I got an idea.

535
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,458
What do you say
we put on a little show for these guys?

536
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,878
Throw down some one-wheelers.
Make it rain out here.

537
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,212
Come on. For a second.

538
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,422
Yeah, let's see what you got.

539
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:58,965
Yeah, show us something.

540
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:01,301
- Okay, give me a board.
- Yes! Carl!

541
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:02,969
Step aside, guys.

542
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:04,721
Honey, I need some help.

543
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:07,557
Yep, just like back in the day.

544
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,476
Nice!

545
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,977
Let's show them how we used to do it.

546
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,062
Step aside. Step aside.

547
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,903
Well, no one ever said
we were gonna live forever.

548
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,821
Let's go.

549
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:24,240
Carl! Carl, what are you doing?

550
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:27,160
What's it look like he's doing?
He's getting ready to rip it up.

551
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:30,538
Relax, Molly.
This is only gonna take a second.

552
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,082
- Come on, Dupree!
- Say when.

553
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,920
- When!
- Yeah!

554
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,178
Oh, I'm racked!

555
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,429
Carl!

556
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,432
Oh, I racked my little Duprees.

557
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,353
When was the last time
you were even on a skateboard?

558
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,522
- 1987.
- Oh.

559
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:59,442
For a second there we almost had it back.

560
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,069
Yeah.

561
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,076
CARL; What is this?

562
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,578
Are you kidding me?

563
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,122
Are you kidding me?

564
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,792
Is this some kind of a joke?

565
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,628
Carl, Thompson wanted more units.

566
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,798
Thought it would work better
as a wraparound.

567
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,299
Wraparound.

568
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:26,302
Mesa Vista is not a wraparound.

569
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,390
- Hasta mañana, Paco
- Good night, boss.

570
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:35,395
- Look, Mr. Thompson.
- Hey. You see the preliminaries?

571
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:39,315
Yeah, I did, and it's completely different
than my original proposal.

572
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,402
God damn it, Carl.
Will you stop fighting this?

573
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:45,655
People buy homes.
Let the government pay for the parks.

574
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,907
That's why we have taxes.

575
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:57,834
The Oaks at Mesa Vista is a money train.

576
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:01,462
You wanna be on it?

577
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,972
Yeah, I'm on it.

578
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:23,318
Money train. I'll give you a money train.

579
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,120
Right there! Right there!
You gotta throw it now!

580
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,288
Please, please, please!

581
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,956
- No, he didn't go over!
- No! No! Why?

582
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,543
He didn't make it, man. Carl! Welcome home!

583
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,629
Come here, buddy! We got one for you.

584
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,464
- Get a beer for him.
- What are you guys doing?

585
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,633
- We're watching the game.
- Yeah, I can see that.

586
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:49,385
Hey, guys!
Please, shut the hell up for two seconds

587
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,304
'cause it's fourth and inches.
Please, just shut up.

588
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,805
- You shut up!
- It's fourth and inches!

589
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:53,973
Why don't you watch it in your house?

590
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,309
I can't have friends over on weeknights
and you know that.

591
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:57,977
- Grow a sac.
- It's not my problem, Neil.

592
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,896
Take it up with Annie.

593
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:04,525
- Time for the lion tamer.
- Yeah, well, I can't talk to him like this.

594
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:07,487
What's going on? You all right?

595
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,822
Yeah. I'm fine.

596
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:12,659
God, I've been watching you lately, man,

597
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:16,579
and you're really putting in the hours,
but you got to find some balance.

598
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:19,916
Find a little Carl time.
You know what I'm saying? Carl time.

599
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,669
<i>First down, Cougars.
Now Washington State...</i>

600
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,253
You're right.

601
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:26,255
- Carl time.
- Come here.

602
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,591
Molly's got the Back to School thing tonight.

603
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:32,345
We got the house to ourselves for a while.
Let's watch the game.

604
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,180
- Let your hair down.
- Let your hair down. I mean...

605
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,848
You think I've been overdoing it
with the work thing?

606
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:38,101
I know you've been overdoing it.

607
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:42,438
- Yeah. Shake it loose, huh?
- Just live a little, man. Just live a little.

608
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:46,526
Yeah. You know,
maybe I ought to make my nachos.

609
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,528
- Nice!
- Yes!

610
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:51,531
- Carl time!
- Nachos, Carl nachos are in my belly.

611
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:54,033
- Hey, Neil, turn up the volume.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.

612
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:56,119
You know who else loves
Carl's nachos is Eddie.

613
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:57,870
- Give him a call.
- I already did.

614
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,540
Carl, soup them up, man! Make them spicy!

615
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:05,044
Okay, guys. This is it. This is it.

616
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,714
Come on. Just come on. Please. Please, God!

617
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:09,632
Send everybody! Send everybody!

618
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:12,135
Yes! Yes! Yes! Damn!

619
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,554
- No, no.
- No, no.

620
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:15,722
No!

621
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:19,142
- No, no!
- No! No!

622
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,477
- No!
'Yes!

623
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,480
- What did I tell you?
- That's what I'm saying!

624
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:28,568
Congratulations, idiots.
Congratulations, guys. Very good.

625
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:31,571
- Fifty pushups, faggot. Fifty pushups.
- I'm not giving you any pushups.

626
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:34,073
- That was the deal.
- Fine. Okay? Enjoy it.

627
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:36,492
- One, two...
- He has a condition.

628
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:39,579
- Three, four.
- That's right! I have a condition.

629
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,747
- I should not keep doing this.
- Come on!

630
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,582
I have a gamey colon,
and it gets spastic and spasms.

631
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,000
You don't have a condition.

632
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,502
- Carl. Carl! Neil, shut up! Carl.
- I didn't read that.

633
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,838
Mark, what? What is it, Mark?

634
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,631
Molly.

635
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,636
Hi.

636
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,847
Oh, hey, Molly.

637
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,767
- You're home early.
- Really?

638
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,686
I just invited some of the guys over

639
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,355
to watch a little football.

640
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:10,777
Figured it was just a little time to loosen up.
A little Carl time.

641
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:14,822
<i>Me gusta</i> margarita!

642
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,660
Hola, Dupree.

643
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,621
<i>Hola,</i> Molly.

644
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:24,332
- Charlie.
- Brilliant.

645
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:27,710
- Sorry.
- We should go.

646
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,462
- You guys want to go?
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

647
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,130
- That's a good idea.
- Let's go to Larry's.

648
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:32,799
- Let's get out of here.
- Let it go. Let it go.

649
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:34,383
- What'd I do with my tie?
- Let's go.

650
00:35:34,509 --> 00:35:37,136
- Bye.
- Sorry, I ashed on your floor.

651
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,222
Great. Take that tie off your head.

652
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:42,308
I'll bring this back tomorrow.
I'll give it to Carl at the office.

653
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,393
So, don't tell Annie I was here.
And if you do, don't...

654
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,479
- Just don't tell her that I asked you not to...
- Get out, Neil.

655
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:48,481
- Out!
- Okay. I'll just go.

656
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,653
I know what you're thinking, Molly.

657
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:56,906
But we were gonna have
this rug shampooed. I promise you.

658
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:59,534
Oh, and look. Look at that.

659
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:02,912
It's my grandmother's silver cheese platter.

660
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:05,373
You used it to serve nachos.

661
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:08,251
Well, nachos have cheese in them.

662
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:17,176
- Let me just start cleaning up some of...
- Dupree, please stop.

663
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,350
Somebody arriving late for the party.
Don't worry about it.

664
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,435
The party... Game's over!

665
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,604
Go away! The party's over!

666
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:32,900
Party... Molly, for the love of God! Please!

667
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:38,030
We heard there were some bad boys in here.

668
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,618
There were, but they left.

669
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:18,571
You know, Carl, I...

670
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:21,407
I really think I've been pretty cool
about this whole situation,

671
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,993
and I hate
having this conversation with you.

672
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:26,913
But this is not exactly
how I pictured us getting started.

673
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,331
I know.

674
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:30,583
Look, Dupree's got to go.

675
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:33,502
No. It's not about kicking Dupree out.

676
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:37,340
It's just that you said
it was gonna be a couple of days.

677
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:39,926
Look, Molly. He's my best friend.

678
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:42,970
Somehow I feel responsible for him.

679
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:48,184
Then maybe it's time
to start prioritizing your responsibilities.

680
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,520
You're right.

681
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:56,359
- What if he had a girlfriend?
- Good idea.

682
00:37:56,442 --> 00:38:00,446
But how is a guy with no job, no car,
living on somebody's couch

683
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:02,114
gonna find any kind of girlfriend?

684
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,200
Our new librarian.

685
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,952
She seems really nice.

686
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:09,538
You want to fix Dupree up
with a really nice librarian?

687
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,458
Listen, I know the guy for 25 years.

688
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:17,380
I think he's more into the young,
foreign, non-librarian type.

689
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:20,883
- Well, it wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I wouldn't get my hopes up.

690
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:22,551
I'll do it.

691
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:26,806
Oh, that's great.
Do you want to know anything about her?

692
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:30,059
No. Well, does she have a car?

693
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,727
Yeah. She does.

694
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:35,564
Good. See if she can swing by
and get me around 8:00. Or quarter to.

695
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:37,483
- Tonight?
- Please.

696
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,193
- Okay.
- Candy?

697
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:42,571
- Mandy.
- Mandy. That's even better.

698
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,410
Librarian.

699
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:53,040
No. No.

700
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:54,667
I thought you were really brave.

701
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,752
I mean, I have
a whole new respect for you, Carl.

702
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:59,505
Well, the rice was okay,
but just for the record,

703
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,924
octopus does not taste like chicken.

704
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:04,260
But you ate it.

705
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,555
What is that?

706
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:09,932
<i>Funky Cold Medina?</i>

707
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:12,018
It looks like Dupree brought his date home.

708
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:14,895
Honey, what is a tie doing on our door?

709
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:19,525
Molly, I think we ought to
drive around the block a couple times.

710
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:22,028
Wait a minute. No way. Mandy's a Mormon.

711
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:23,529
- She's not the kind of girl...
- A Mormon?

712
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,031
Who would get busy on the first date.

713
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:27,575
You fixed Dupree up with a Mormon librarian.

714
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:30,745
Molly, wait!

715
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:40,129
- Oh, my God.
- What?

716
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:41,964
Let's drive around the block.

717
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,466
Carl!

718
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,135
That butter dish was our wedding gift.

719
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,804
- Guys, guys! Hold it! Let me explain.
- What was he doing with butter?

720
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:51,807
- Dupree, no need to explain.
- It's not what it looks like.

721
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,642
- Dupree, no explanation necessary.
- I know.

722
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:54,894
Go back in the house!

723
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:56,979
Not before I thank Molly
for the best night of my life.

724
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:58,814
Mol, Mol. Thank you.

725
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,400
What happened in there, it was so natural.
So beautiful.

726
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:03,903
- Go back inside. Listen, I've got neighbors.
- I know you do.

727
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:05,154
But listen to me. I'm in love.

728
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,907
Dupree. Dupree,
I'm not going to do this with you tonight!

729
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,785
- Jesus! Molly, call the fire department!
- Oh, my...

730
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:12,995
- Carl!
- Mandy!

731
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,246
Mandy! Mandy!

732
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:18,167
Fire in our house! It's fire!

733
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,127
- My couch!
- Roll!

734
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,436
God, I loved this couch.

735
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:41,607
<i>Rescue 115...</i>

736
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:46,612
You know, when I saw you on fire,
my heart stopped.

737
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:50,199
I had so much adrenaline pumping
through me, I probably could have...

738
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:54,161
Could have picked up this car
and just hurled it 10 blocks.

739
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:58,207
Are you gonna do this,
or am I gonna have to?

740
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:02,128
- I'll take care of it.
- Tonight, Carl.

741
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,214
Go on, get out of here.

742
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:08,217
Or I'm not responsible
for what these hands are gonna do. Go!

743
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,058
Bye.

744
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,564
- You okay?
- Yeah.

745
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:25,192
Yeah, just a little smoke inhalation.

746
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:33,826
Wow. Unbelievable.

747
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:36,412
Mandy was completely unharmed.

748
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:40,249
Fire chief said that the butter
probably saved her life.

749
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:43,919
You talk about a miracle.
You just got to thank the big man.

750
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:45,880
It's all you can...

751
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:51,427
What is wrong with you?
Why did you have to use so many candles?

752
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,929
I was just trying to set a mood.

753
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:56,015
You know how I am, Carl.

754
00:41:56,098 --> 00:41:57,933
Yeah. I do.

755
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:02,688
Look...

756
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:07,443
It's about time you got on the road.

757
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:26,420
- You guys need any help?
- No, we're good. Relax.

758
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:34,220
Well, I had a lovely stay.

759
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:37,389
Thank you both for your generosity.

760
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:42,144
Sorry about last night, and no hard feelings.

761
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,897
I hope. At least, there are none on my part.

762
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,983
Okay. Are you sure you got a place to go?

763
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:50,069
Yeah. I got a place to go.

764
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:51,820
Going to Mandy's.

765
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:53,656
The librarian?

766
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:56,158
Don't you think that's kind of
moving a little quickly, Dupree?

767
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:57,826
Maybe it is, but so what?

768
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:02,081
Something special is happening there.
I'm not gonna fight it.

769
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:04,959
Hey, take care of this big mook for me.

770
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:08,003
Bye. See you guys.

771
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:10,172
Tosh, listen.

772
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:12,841
You got the heart of a damn lion.

773
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:17,596
I respect you. You took a beating,
but you took it like a man.

774
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:20,182
God bless all of you.

775
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:28,774
Goodbye!

776
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:31,610
Off to Mandy's!

777
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:36,198
Oh, my God! Carl.

778
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:44,373
- Okay!
- Sir, are you sure you're okay?

779
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:46,292
My helmet saved me.

780
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:53,382
You see that? He's gonna be fine.

781
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:55,884
- Here's your bag.
- Thank you.

782
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:03,809
Bye!

783
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:06,687
Bye

784
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:10,524
Carl.

785
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,319
Carl?

786
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:17,656
We've been staring at this
for over two hours. Let's go get some dinner.

787
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,827
Or margaritas. Celebrate our emancipation.

788
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:26,749
The insurance adjuster
recommended that we sue Dupree.

789
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:30,878
For a moose head?

790
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,381
Just curious.

791
00:44:41,055 --> 00:44:44,183
It was the margarita that did it, wasn't it?

792
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,937
It was the emancipation that did it.

793
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,940
I like this song.

794
00:44:52,066 --> 00:44:54,777
<i>Smooth ta-ta-ria</i>

795
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:58,947
<i>She makes a smooth margarita</i>

796
00:45:00,074 --> 00:45:03,285
<i>We had some good margaritas</i>

797
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,791
- Oh, my God.
- What?

798
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:19,385
Are you kidding me?
What the hell is he doing?

799
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:21,804
I thought he was going to Mandy's.

800
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:24,473
Honey, I don't think he can see us.

801
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:27,309
Maybe we should just keep going.

802
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:29,395
It's pouring rain outside.

803
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:32,606
- Not that bad.
- Honey, look at him.

804
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:42,241
What?

805
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:44,660
Damn it.

806
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,662
Molly. Molly!

807
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,123
Dupree!

808
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:55,421
Dupree.

809
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:59,133
Dupree, what are you doing?
It's pouring rain outside.

810
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:01,844
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

811
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:05,472
- Yeah, well, what about Mandy?
- Don't ask.

812
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:17,776
Carl, can you get his bike?

813
00:46:19,445 --> 00:46:22,322
Come on. Let's go. Let's go home.

814
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:25,617
Carl, honey, bike.

815
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:36,503
- Carl!
- I'm coming!

816
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:44,052
I really appreciate this, guys.

817
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:49,975
Trust me, no more open flames.
I've learned my lesson.

818
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,728
All right, well, it's been a long night.

819
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:55,022
So, I'm gonna go to bed.

820
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:58,901
Dupree, try not to go to sleep
with that head wet. Okay?

821
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:00,819
Good night, Molly.

822
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:06,867
Dupree. I don't mean to come down on you,

823
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:09,661
but you need to start
getting your life together.

824
00:47:09,745 --> 00:47:11,246
- We're grown-ups now.
- Yeah.

825
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:14,249
- You know what I mean?
- I know. I know. You're right.

826
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:18,003
And if you're going to stay here,
things are gonna be different from now on.

827
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:19,254
No more naked stuff.

828
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:21,924
- Well, it felt natural to be naked. I...
- I don't care!

829
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,926
- Okay.
- I do not care.

830
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:26,845
Clean up after yourself, watch the noise,

831
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:29,598
try to help out around the house, please?

832
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,767
It's not too much to ask.

833
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:33,560
You're right.

834
00:47:36,438 --> 00:47:40,776
Carl? I can be really helpful
when I set my mind to it.

835
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,445
And that's what I'm gonna do.

836
00:47:44,238 --> 00:47:45,614
Oh, and...

837
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:52,663
Another thing.

838
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:56,166
Would you mind writing
some thank-you notes for me?

839
00:47:57,668 --> 00:47:58,919
Okay.

840
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:01,171
Yeah. That'd be great.

841
00:48:02,631 --> 00:48:04,591
Try to get some sleep.

842
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:11,139
Gut-check time, Dupree.

843
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,867
"Dear Aunt Kathy.

844
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:17,539
"Thank you so much for the wine glasses."

845
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:49,821
<i>And this, of course,
is the point of the race</i>

846
00:49:51,198 --> 00:49:52,574
<i>where speed will play a major factor,</i>

847
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:55,702
<i>where long months of training
certainly pay off.</i>

848
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:57,079
Hello?

849
00:49:57,204 --> 00:49:59,414
Yeah, Dupree.
I'm gonna need you to do me a solid.

850
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:00,666
Yeah, no problem. What do you got?

851
00:50:00,749 --> 00:50:05,337
I promised Molly I would give
this Career Day presentation today at 1:00.

852
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,506
But her father just
dropped the big one on me,

853
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:10,926
so I'm gonna need you to step in
and fill in for me.

854
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:12,177
Can you do that?

855
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,428
I don't know, Carl.

856
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:16,014
I don't know the first thing
about the development business.

857
00:50:16,098 --> 00:50:18,767
I really think Mr. Thompson
might find me in over my head.

858
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,687
No, not the development business.
School, Dupree.

859
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,939
<i>I'm gonna need you to fill in for me
at Molly's school.</i>

860
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:25,357
No, no, no. Not this time.

861
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,859
- What?
- No, no, I'm talking to Lance Armstrong.

862
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:30,028
He's trying to break away from the pack.
I got him, though.

863
00:50:30,112 --> 00:50:33,949
Will you quit dicking around
with your little Huffy bike and listen to me?

864
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:50,632
Hey, Molly.

865
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:54,386
- Dupree, what are you doing?
- Carl asked me to fill in.

866
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,888
I guess there was some sort of work conflict.

867
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:59,641
What? Conflict? What kind of conflict?

868
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:01,435
I don't know. I don't ask questions.

869
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:03,603
I just ride to where I'm needed.

870
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:07,315
But don't worry.
I'm sort of a good public speaker.

871
00:51:07,441 --> 00:51:10,694
Oh, no, no. It's a Career Day presentation,
Dupree. You don't even have a job.

872
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:13,572
I understand that.
But here's what I'd love you to do.

873
00:51:13,655 --> 00:51:16,742
Please get Mandy here.
I want her to see this.

874
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:18,702
I think this will win her back.

875
00:51:18,827 --> 00:51:20,787
Now where are these little rug rats?

876
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:22,998
They're in the third door.

877
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,585
Hey, how are you?

878
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:29,921
First of all, thank you
for giving me the opportunity

879
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,923
to come talk to you on Career Day.

880
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:35,135
Now, I am not Mr. Carl Peterson

881
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:37,763
and I don't have a career per se.

882
00:51:37,846 --> 00:51:41,600
I guess you could say
my career is living and loving.

883
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:44,019
And I do that to the utmost.

884
00:51:47,689 --> 00:51:49,149
She coming?

885
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:51,735
Keep going? Okay.

886
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,863
I see all you fresh-faced kidlets,

887
00:51:54,988 --> 00:51:59,201
sitting there in your neat little rows,
and you're all just pods.

888
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:01,703
Pods, waiting for your instructions.

889
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:04,456
Now some of you
are gonna get zapped right away

890
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,792
and be 15-year-old prodigies,

891
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:11,254
little midget Olympic gymnasts
with their pictures on cereal boxes.

892
00:52:11,713 --> 00:52:14,341
Some of you will go on to college,
and you'll find your rhythm there,

893
00:52:14,424 --> 00:52:16,718
and then go chase down
the titans of industry,

894
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:19,304
or maybe straighten out
our problems at the UN.

895
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:20,639
But some of you,

896
00:52:20,722 --> 00:52:24,810
and this is the group that no one ever
comes into Career Day and addresses,

897
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:26,269
and it's criminal,

898
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:29,397
some of you are just gonna float along,

899
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,359
eating spicy foods,

900
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:35,654
humming black people's music into your 30s.

901
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:38,323
Well into your 30s, languishing.

902
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:42,035
This group of pods
is gonna do a lot of languishing.

903
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:45,080
And you're gonna take some heat for it.

904
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,249
Sadly, you will.

905
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:52,254
Europe's a little easier.
They seem to understand a little better.

906
00:52:52,379 --> 00:52:54,589
So does South America.

907
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:56,341
I went to Argentina one time,

908
00:52:56,424 --> 00:53:00,178
and everyone just seemed to be
sitting around. It was beautiful.

909
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:03,390
But that's okay. You stay loose. Stay liquid.

910
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:06,101
Laugh a lot. But be ready.

911
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:08,812
That's what Dupree's doing
with his life's little pod.

912
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:12,649
Staying nimble.
Till I get the call from the mother ship.

913
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:14,776
<i>My raison d'état.</i>

914
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:16,528
Then I'd fight.

915
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:21,616
Then you'll see Dupree coming in here
throwing seven different kinds of smoke.

916
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:36,047
That's fine. The pods
that were supposed to hear this did.

917
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:39,634
It'll kick in when it needs to. I'm done here.

918
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:44,639
I told you.
Now, do you think it went over their head?

919
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:47,517
- No. It was really good.
- They got it. They got it.

920
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:50,061
Now, where's Mandy?
I'm only gonna do this one more time,

921
00:53:50,145 --> 00:53:51,479
but we got to get her here!

922
00:53:51,605 --> 00:53:54,649
Dupree, Mandy has to... She had a...

923
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:57,694
She had a book that was lost.

924
00:54:04,826 --> 00:54:06,786
I'm sorry, Dupree.

925
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,714
Dupree, wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

926
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,468
Dupree, there's something
you need to know about Mandy.

927
00:54:23,053 --> 00:54:27,682
Well, it turns out that she's a total slut
and is sleeping with half the male faculty.

928
00:54:28,725 --> 00:54:31,353
- What? No.
- I'm sorry.

929
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:33,188
- My Mandy?
- Yeah.

930
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:35,857
Sorry, Dupree.
I would have never set you up

931
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:37,609
with her if I would have known.

932
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:40,195
- Even
Okay, kids, back inside.

933
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:42,405
- Let's go.
- Even

934
00:54:52,499 --> 00:54:54,084
With that guy?

935
00:54:54,209 --> 00:54:57,337
Great job today, kids.
Yeah. Good teamwork.

936
00:54:57,671 --> 00:55:00,548
You did good, Billy.
All right, let's go.

937
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:04,344
Yeah.
All right, let's get ready for the next class.

938
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:17,941
Afraid so.

939
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:20,443
He's not even on the faculty.

940
00:55:21,778 --> 00:55:26,074
There really aren't anymore
Audrey Hepburns out there, are there?

941
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:28,243
Oh, what a sucker.

942
00:55:31,413 --> 00:55:34,916
Dupree? Dupree?

943
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:42,048
You talk to Sam about the zoning issues?

944
00:55:42,924 --> 00:55:46,136
Yeah. And to be honest with you, sir,
they're still in flux.

945
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:50,056
Carl, I'm going to the bank in days, all right?
I cannot have things in flux.

946
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:52,559
I realize that, sir. I'll get on it right away.

947
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:55,478
Carl, sit down, please. Please just sit down

948
00:55:57,564 --> 00:55:59,524
You know, there's something you said to me

949
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:02,444
a few days ago
that I just cannot get out of my mind.

950
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:07,282
Something about
you and Molly having children.

951
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:11,286
Oh, right. Yeah, no.
That was... That was hypothetical.

952
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:15,665
That's not something that we're talking
about doing any time soon.

953
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:19,419
You know what I did, Carl,
when I started dating again?

954
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:21,588
- No idea.
- I got a vasectomy.

955
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:23,506
- A vasectomy?
- Yeah.

956
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:26,926
Okay. That's a little extreme, don't you think?

957
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:30,013
Not really. It's a mild outpatient procedure.

958
00:56:30,138 --> 00:56:32,057
A little local anesthesia, snip snip,

959
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,726
sit on a bag of frozen peas for a night. Voilà.

960
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:37,270
I mean, that was it, and it's

961
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:44,152
one hundred percent effective.

962
00:56:44,611 --> 00:56:47,113
Yeah. And 100% permanent.

963
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:51,826
Carl, read the literature. It is reversible.

964
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:56,539
Seventy percent of the time. All right.
See you get your shit together, all right?

965
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:59,834
I want it back on my desk,
this zoning stuff, by 3:00 today.

966
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:02,670
All right? Thank you, Carl.

967
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:11,054
<i>All right?</i>

968
00:57:11,805 --> 00:57:13,348
<i>- Fine. How are you?
- "Fine. How are you?"</i>

969
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:14,808
<i>Oh, fine.</i>

970
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,770
<i>Say, you know,
you were great back there.</i>

971
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:21,189
<i>You weren't so bad yourself.</i>

972
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:39,749
<i>Guess we'd better
get Irving's car and get out of here.</i>

973
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,669
So you really were serious
about Audrey Hepburn, huh?

974
00:57:42,752 --> 00:57:47,006
She had it all. Style, grace, ethereal beauty.

975
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:51,719
Just like I thought Mandy did.

976
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:55,515
I don't know.
I have a hard time imagining Audrey Hepburn

977
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:58,852
<i>getting buttered up to Funky Cold Medina.</i>

978
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:01,688
Really? I don't.

979
00:58:02,355 --> 00:58:06,234
<i>The Mouth of Truth.
The legend is that if you're given to lying</i>

980
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:09,070
<i>and you put your hand in there,
it will be bitten off.</i>

981
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:12,907
I'm still trying to understand
why Carl didn't show up today.

982
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:16,369
I know
he's under a lot of pressure right now,

983
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,705
but just lately
he seems like a different person.

984
00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:22,792
No, he's just working really hard
He gets like that sometimes.

985
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,754
Maybe if he opened up a little bit more.

986
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:30,675
Look, Carl's never gonna be mistaken
for the great communicator.

987
00:58:30,758 --> 00:58:33,928
I mean, just mention the word
"feelings" or "emotion,"

988
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:36,306
and you watch his eyes glaze over. But...

989
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:38,683
I don't know. He just puts up a wall.

990
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:40,351
Well, how do you get past it?

991
00:58:40,435 --> 00:58:43,313
I think you just fight through it. Patience.

992
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:46,441
That's what I did. I ask a lot of questions.

993
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:48,276
I let him know that I care.

994
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:51,654
And I just pray he drops his guard,
'cause when he does,

995
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:53,489
it's so worth it.

996
00:58:59,662 --> 00:59:00,872
<i>Hello.</i>

997
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,458
<i>You beast! It was perfectly awful!</i>

998
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:06,794
That gets me every time,
and I know it's coming.

999
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,100
So, Dupree did a good job?

1000
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:23,561
Did he mention the mother ship?

1001
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:27,148
Actually, in a weird way,
he was really inspiring.

1002
00:59:27,774 --> 00:59:30,610
I didn't know he was so sensitive.
Did you know he writes poetry?

1003
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:32,362
- Poetry?
- Yeah.

1004
00:59:32,487 --> 00:59:34,489
- Man, what a homo.
- Wow.

1005
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:37,951
That is really mature, Carl.

1006
00:59:39,702 --> 00:59:41,788
Look, honey, I'm sorry I didn't make it today.

1007
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:45,333
- What is going on with you lately?
- Oh, nothing. I'm fine.

1008
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,627
You are clearly not fine, Carl.

1009
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,963
So why don't you meet me
halfway here, please.

1010
00:59:50,046 --> 00:59:52,298
All right.
You want to know what's going on?

1011
00:59:52,382 --> 00:59:54,717
I'll tell you what's going on.

1012
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:57,679
- I think your father hates me.
- What?

1013
00:59:58,471 --> 01:00:02,141
Carl. Carl, my father does not hate you.

1014
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:03,810
He gives you this big promotion,

1015
01:00:03,893 --> 01:00:05,228
which you said was a dream come true.

1016
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:06,813
Why would he do that?
Because he hates you?

1017
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:09,732
That's exactly what I'm beginning to think.

1018
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:11,484
For the same reason he's been systematically

1019
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:13,820
trying to emasculate me and sterilize me.

1020
01:00:13,903 --> 01:00:16,239
Slow down.
'Cause now you're not making any sense.

1021
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:17,490
I'm not making any sense?

1022
01:00:17,573 --> 01:00:20,576
Well, here's something
that should make perfect sense to you.

1023
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:23,705
Now, everybody knows that your father,
when he likes somebody,

1024
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,790
he invites them out on a little fishing trip.

1025
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:29,168
Fact. I've never been invited fishing.
Not once.

1026
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:33,089
- You hate fishing.
- He doesn't know that.

1027
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:36,217
I'm telling you, Molly, he hates me.

1028
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:40,680
Look, Carl,
I know how my father gets sometimes. I do.

1029
01:00:41,264 --> 01:00:43,433
He pushes people when he wants results.

1030
01:00:43,558 --> 01:00:45,893
And it's frustrating, I know.

1031
01:00:46,602 --> 01:00:48,688
But he doesn't hate you.

1032
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:51,733
And I know you want to do
a great job on this project,

1033
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:54,235
but it's taking over your life.

1034
01:00:55,111 --> 01:00:57,739
And we're supposed to be having fun.

1035
01:01:00,575 --> 01:01:03,328
Why don't you come home
at a decent hour tomorrow night?

1036
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:05,747
Dupree wants to cook for us.

1037
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:07,999
We'll sit down, we'll have dinner, relax.

1038
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:10,626
Talk about things other than work.

1039
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:14,005
And everything will be okay.

1040
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:16,007
- Yeah.
- You'll see.

1041
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,300
Fine.

1042
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:19,927
Fine.

1043
01:01:30,772 --> 01:01:31,981
Yeah.

1044
01:01:34,817 --> 01:01:35,985
Hey.

1045
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:38,946
- You busy?
- No.

1046
01:01:39,072 --> 01:01:41,741
Just catching up on some back issues.

1047
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:43,993
What's going on?

1048
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,081
I wanted to ask you something.

1049
01:01:48,164 --> 01:01:49,332
Yeah?

1050
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:53,711
Would you be offended
if Thompson asked you to get a vasectomy?

1051
01:01:53,795 --> 01:01:57,048
What?
Why would he want me to get a vasectomy?

1052
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:59,509
- Carl, I barely know the man!
- Wait a minute! Wait! Dupree.

1053
01:01:59,634 --> 01:02:02,595
- Yes, I'd be offended!
- No. Not you.

1054
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:06,099
That's not what I mean.
Just what do you think of vasectomies?

1055
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:08,935
Cutting off my manhood?
I think it's barbaric.

1056
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:12,814
No one's getting near that part of my body.
No one, Carl.

1057
01:02:12,939 --> 01:02:15,108
Unless, of course, it's a woman.

1058
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:17,985
And then she better not have a scalpel.

1059
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:19,779
Of course.

1060
01:02:20,655 --> 01:02:22,824
Why would he want me to get a vasectomy?

1061
01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:24,450
He doesn't want you to get a vasectomy.

1062
01:02:24,534 --> 01:02:26,786
- It was a hypothetical question.
- Okay.

1063
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:28,121
Just forget I asked.

1064
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:29,539
Don't joke with me like that, man

1065
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:31,707
Go back to your reading.

1066
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:41,676
Watch that heat. Slow stirring, Molly.

1067
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:44,053
How are my game hens doing?

1068
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:45,346
- Wow.
- Gorgeous.

1069
01:02:46,305 --> 01:02:48,724
Okay, get started on the salad.
Put some walnuts in.

1070
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:51,561
- I'll take care of this.
- Okay. How'd you learn all this?

1071
01:02:51,686 --> 01:02:55,898
Most of it I picked up
in a six-week series, Treasures of Tuscany.

1072
01:02:56,190 --> 01:03:00,319
The garlic technique, however,
I got from watching Goodfellas.

1073
01:03:00,403 --> 01:03:02,071
I actually make an incredible risotto,

1074
01:03:02,196 --> 01:03:04,824
but I want to keep it
low carb tonight for Carl.

1075
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:08,369
Poor guy has kind of let
the wheels come off a little bit. Okay.

1076
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:10,037
Twenty minutes till the big guy gets here.

1077
01:03:10,163 --> 01:03:11,747
Focus. We got to come together now.

1078
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:14,834
Merlot. I want you to get it out.
Get it breathing.

1079
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:19,380
We're gonna use the 2005,
Napa wine glasses Aunt Kathy gave us.

1080
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:23,676
How did you know Aunt Kathy
gave us those wine glasses?

1081
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:26,012
He would have written these notes.

1082
01:03:26,095 --> 01:03:27,221
Dupree, please!

1083
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:29,098
- Please stop making excuses for him.
- I'm not.

1084
01:03:29,223 --> 01:03:31,184
- But I think that he would have if he...
- No, you are.

1085
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:33,895
And you have to stop doing that now
because your buddy is wrong. Okay?

1086
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:37,940
If he didn't want to write them
he should have just told me.

1087
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:43,029
And, big surprise, he's late again.

1088
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:48,659
Look, you know, forget him.

1089
01:03:48,743 --> 01:03:51,162
- You made this beautiful meal.
- Thank you.

1090
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:53,289
We're gonna sit here
and we're gonna enjoy it.

1091
01:03:53,414 --> 01:03:55,249
We're gonna drink.

1092
01:03:56,459 --> 01:03:59,754
And we're gonna eat.
And we're gonna drink some more.

1093
01:03:59,879 --> 01:04:01,839
Well, it's frustrating for me, too,

1094
01:04:01,923 --> 01:04:05,092
'cause I know he would have loved this meal.

1095
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:17,021
Yeah.

1096
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:21,067
I can't do it...

1097
01:04:21,609 --> 01:04:22,944
Oh, boy

1098
01:04:23,778 --> 01:04:26,531
No. But I used to be able
to touch it to the top of my nose.

1099
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:29,617
- No, really?
- Yeah. Oh, wow. Can you do it?

1100
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:30,868
No.

1101
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:38,626
Hey, guys.

1102
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:45,299
There's a plate for you in the oven.

1103
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:50,054
Okay, look, I'm sorry I'm a little late.

1104
01:04:50,638 --> 01:04:52,557
I got hung up at work.

1105
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:57,144
Would it have killed you
to make a phone call?

1106
01:04:57,395 --> 01:04:59,063
No, Randolph, Randolph, wait!

1107
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:00,648
I'm sorry, Molly, but,

1108
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:04,235
damn it, Carl,
you really press my buttons sometimes!

1109
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:09,949
- Is he kidding?
- No. Now you've upset Randolph.

1110
01:05:12,994 --> 01:05:14,328
Randolph?

1111
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:18,499
Randolph? You got to be kidding me.
I know a Randy Dupree.

1112
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:20,585
- I do not know a Randolph.
- Did it ever occur to you

1113
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:22,420
that maybe he prefers to be called Randolph?

1114
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:24,338
No, Molly, it never occurred to me.

1115
01:05:24,422 --> 01:05:26,424
You know, the guy writes
some bullshit poetry

1116
01:05:26,507 --> 01:05:28,759
and suddenly he's got a brand-new name.

1117
01:05:28,843 --> 01:05:31,429
That's funny.
Turns out that's not the only thing he writes.

1118
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:35,016
Apparently, he is a whiz at thank-you notes!

1119
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:42,356
- He told you about that?
- It just kind of slipped out.

1120
01:05:42,607 --> 01:05:45,359
Oh, I bet it just kind of slipped out.

1121
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:49,947
Guy stabs his best friend in the back.
He's getting drunk with his wife.

1122
01:05:50,031 --> 01:05:53,451
What can I say, Carl?
I'm kind of fun to get drunk with.

1123
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:56,454
Maybe you should try it sometime,
because I'm here every night!

1124
01:05:56,537 --> 01:06:00,124
Molly, I'd be delighted to try it sometime,
but unlike your friend, Dupree,

1125
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:01,876
I've got a job!

1126
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:04,545
And what was with the groomsman shirt?

1127
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:05,963
That was a one-time deal, Molly.

1128
01:06:06,047 --> 01:06:07,632
He was trying to look nice for you.

1129
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:09,467
And why are you coming down on Dupree?

1130
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:12,303
He's the one who went through all this effort
to cook low carb for you.

1131
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:13,638
You didn't even bother to show up.

1132
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:15,222
Low carb? What the hell does that mean?

1133
01:06:15,306 --> 01:06:19,143
You know, he's on the whole health kick
with the bicycling and Lance Armstrong.

1134
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:22,313
- So he's just trying to help you out.
- He's trying to help me out?

1135
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:23,648
That's a laugh, Molly.

1136
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:27,068
I'm the one
who put a goddamn roof over his head!

1137
01:06:27,568 --> 01:06:30,404
One. We put the roof over his head.

1138
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:33,908
And A. I mean, you haven't
really been taking care of yourself.

1139
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:36,577
I can't remember the last time you exercised.

1140
01:06:36,661 --> 01:06:39,538
And how many Twinkies
have you had today?

1141
01:06:40,873 --> 01:06:42,083
What are you talking about?

1142
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:43,751
Oh, Carl, please. There's, like,

1143
01:06:43,876 --> 01:06:46,921
a million Twinkie wrappers
on the floor of your car.

1144
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:49,840
- You're not fooling anybody.
- All right. All right.

1145
01:06:49,924 --> 01:06:52,009
So I admit it, I enjoy one occasionally.

1146
01:06:52,093 --> 01:06:54,512
Is there something so wrong with that?

1147
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:57,598
And, Molly, look,
I am under a great deal of stress.

1148
01:06:57,723 --> 01:06:59,767
What do you want from me?

1149
01:07:04,188 --> 01:07:07,775
Wait a minute.
Is this the kind of thing that turns you on?

1150
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,860
- Oh, Carl!
- Is this what turns you on?

1151
01:07:09,944 --> 01:07:13,447
- Come on, Molly.
- I was reading an article on Oprah.

1152
01:07:14,115 --> 01:07:17,618
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I can't be
one of your boy-band flavor of the weeks.

1153
01:07:17,743 --> 01:07:20,371
With their enhanced frosted tips

1154
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:24,417
and their washboard bellies
and their hairless backs!

1155
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:29,130
What's happening to us, Carl?

1156
01:07:29,255 --> 01:07:34,051
I don't know what's happening to you, Molly,
but apparently I'm getting fat!

1157
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:43,811
Nice. Looks like somebody's tired
of getting sand kicked in their face.

1158
01:07:43,936 --> 01:07:46,564
Good job.
Good to see you living strong, buddy.

1159
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:49,233
Please. Would you listen to yourself?

1160
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:53,154
You get your first ten-speed bike,
and suddenly you're Lance Armstrong.

1161
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:54,655
Let's leave Lance out of this.

1162
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:57,908
Guy's done more with one testicle
than you and I can do with three.

1163
01:07:57,992 --> 01:08:00,745
Now, listen.
I know you're under a lot of pressure at work

1164
01:08:00,828 --> 01:08:02,663
and you and Molly are having some trouble.

1165
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:04,457
Trouble? No.

1166
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:08,252
I wasn't having any trouble
until you arrived, Randolph.

1167
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:10,254
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what it means.

1168
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:11,505
No, I don't.

1169
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,340
You sold me out
with those thank-you notes.

1170
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:16,510
And what's with this
Roman Holiday obsession?

1171
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:19,847
I know you, Dupree.
Your favorite movie's Fletch.

1172
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:23,684
No, sir. No, it's not.
<i>Fletch</i> is in my top five. It's not my favorite.

1173
01:08:23,809 --> 01:08:26,937
What's with the poetry?
I think you're trying to show me up.

1174
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:29,607
Maybe I like poetry.
Did that ever occur to you?

1175
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:32,359
Listen, if I got to be
the lovable fuckup all my life

1176
01:08:32,485 --> 01:08:34,195
to win your best friend prize,

1177
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,363
maybe you should keep your award.

1178
01:08:36,489 --> 01:08:40,534
I've got news for you, Dupree.
You're not that lovable.

1179
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:47,416
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that, Carl.

1180
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,418
Goodbye, Mr. Grumpy.

1181
01:09:10,773 --> 01:09:11,899
Sugar

1182
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:14,235
Top shelf, behind the honey.

1183
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:17,655
- Where?
- Top shelf, behind the honey.

1184
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:18,906
Oh, yeah.

1185
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:20,825
- You got to reach for it.
- Okay.

1186
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:23,285
- Yeah, right there.
- Oh, God.

1187
01:09:23,369 --> 01:09:25,955
- You gotta reach. Right there.
- I'm reaching.

1188
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:27,540
Oh, goodness.

1189
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,168
Right there.

1190
01:09:31,252 --> 01:09:34,797
There's the sugar. Right behind the honey.

1191
01:09:36,507 --> 01:09:38,676
- Right there. You got it?
- I got it.

1192
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:42,471
Why do you do this to me? Got it.

1193
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,062
So good.

1194
01:09:56,861 --> 01:09:58,320
Bye, honey.

1195
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:05,995
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello. Yes. ls Mandy there, please?

1196
01:10:06,787 --> 01:10:08,831
<i>Is this Dupree calling again?</i>

1197
01:10:08,914 --> 01:10:10,499
Yes, this is Dupree again.

1198
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:13,335
<i>Get it through your head.
Mandy does not want to talk to you, okay?</i>

1199
01:10:13,419 --> 01:10:15,713
Okay, yeah, just tell her that I called.

1200
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:17,798
<i>- Good night.
- Thank</i> you.

1201
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:29,226
Looks like
we're going camping again, Murphy.

1202
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:47,912
- Oh, God!
- Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1203
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:51,165
- I didn't know you were down here.
- No, it's my fault.

1204
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:53,584
- What in the hell is going on?
- Nothing, honey. It's fine.

1205
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:55,461
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Are you naked again?

1206
01:10:55,544 --> 01:10:57,463
- No, no, no, it's fine.
- We talked about this!

1207
01:10:57,546 --> 01:10:59,340
I know we did. Yes.

1208
01:10:59,423 --> 01:11:02,134
Everyone's asleep,
and here's lonely old Dupree

1209
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:06,305
- just waling away on himself.
- You weren't waling away on yourself. It...

1210
01:11:06,388 --> 01:11:09,558
God!
An animal wouldn't debase himself thus.

1211
01:11:09,642 --> 01:11:12,186
- What is happening to me?
- Is this one of my tube socks?

1212
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:13,938
- Carl, please.
- Answer the question!

1213
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:15,606
- Oh, my God.
- Mine were dirty.

1214
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:17,566
Carl, stop it! Relax.

1215
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:23,614
Wait a minute.
What are you even doing down here, Molly?

1216
01:11:25,324 --> 01:11:28,160
- Are you serious?
- It's a simple question.

1217
01:11:28,243 --> 01:11:29,995
I couldn't sleep.

1218
01:11:30,955 --> 01:11:32,790
I'm getting a broom.

1219
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,209
This is rock bottom.

1220
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:37,419
I was doing so good.

1221
01:11:37,503 --> 01:11:40,297
Wasn't I doing good, Carl? Huh, buddy?

1222
01:11:40,798 --> 01:11:43,008
But, Dupree, where did you find this?

1223
01:11:43,092 --> 01:11:45,344
Oh.
I got it from that box marked

1224
01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:49,014
"Carl's camping equipment" in the garage.

1225
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:53,102
- You put the box away, didn't you?
- Yes. Yes.

1226
01:11:53,185 --> 01:11:55,980
I'm 99% sure I put it away.

1227
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:07,574
I didn't realize
you were such an outdoorsman, Carl.

1228
01:12:07,658 --> 01:12:09,284
<i>- Asian</i> Assault?
- Molly, let me explain.

1229
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:11,578
That one was in the wrong section
at the video store.

1230
01:12:11,662 --> 01:12:12,788
Oh, you're gonna lie to my face.

1231
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:14,456
I thought it was a kung fu movie
with Bruce Lee.

1232
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,500
<i>- Okay. Pacific Rim Job.
- No idea.</i>

1233
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,419
All right. That one I kind of knew about.

1234
01:12:18,502 --> 01:12:21,005
<i>Oh, Beijing Bang Bang?</i>

1235
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:23,257
Carl! Is this what our marriage has come to?

1236
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:28,345
Lies and all these Chinese fetish videos?

1237
01:12:28,429 --> 01:12:29,680
I'm just curious.

1238
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:33,600
All right. I admit, Molly,
that I was into Asian porn for a little while.

1239
01:12:33,684 --> 01:12:35,644
But it was just a phase.

1240
01:12:35,728 --> 01:12:38,814
Anyway, why am I the one
who's on trial here?

1241
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:41,483
He's in there starching my sock,
and you don't even bat an eyelash.

1242
01:12:41,567 --> 01:12:43,986
Because I'm not married to him!

1243
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:46,405
I am married to you.

1244
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:50,325
Do something with that.

1245
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,795
Is there anything worse

1246
01:13:01,879 --> 01:13:04,548
than having to throw away
your porn collection?

1247
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:06,300
What's going on with you and Molly?

1248
01:13:06,383 --> 01:13:08,135
- What?
- You heard me.

1249
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:10,054
Are you in love with my wife?

1250
01:13:10,137 --> 01:13:12,556
Have you lost your mind?
What are you talking about?

1251
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:14,266
Dupree. Dupree, just answer the question.

1252
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:16,477
Whoa, hold on, Jake LaMotta.
I'm not gonna...

1253
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,937
- That's a sick question.
- How come you can't answer it?

1254
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:21,774
I'm not going to answer
because it doesn't deserve an answer.

1255
01:13:21,857 --> 01:13:24,777
How could you ask me something like that?

1256
01:13:25,736 --> 01:13:27,905
You're very clever, Dupree.

1257
01:13:28,322 --> 01:13:30,157
You're living in my house.

1258
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,285
You're going to town
on yourself in my living room.

1259
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:36,830
- And now you're moving in on my wife.
- What?

1260
01:13:36,914 --> 01:13:38,624
You think you got it all figured out,

1261
01:13:38,707 --> 01:13:40,542
but I'm on to you, and you're out of here!

1262
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:43,087
Oh, no. Hold on.
You're not throwing me out of here.

1263
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:45,380
- I'll leave!
- Good! And while you're at it,

1264
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:47,633
leave the flask and the groomsman's outfit.

1265
01:13:47,716 --> 01:13:49,718
But you gave those to me. Those were gifts.

1266
01:13:49,802 --> 01:13:51,720
- All right! You know, keep those.
- All those were gifts.

1267
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:52,930
But leave the insignia.

1268
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:55,766
Because that was for my best man.

1269
01:14:36,932 --> 01:14:38,934
Hey. It's for the best.

1270
01:14:40,519 --> 01:14:43,689
The guy would have been
living off us forever.

1271
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:52,739
Dinner is at 7:30,
and my father will be here at 7:00, so...

1272
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:56,535
Molly. With all things considered,

1273
01:14:56,618 --> 01:14:58,787
do you think
that maybe tonight isn't the best night

1274
01:14:58,871 --> 01:15:00,455
to have your father over for dinner?

1275
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:03,292
Carl. Carl. Please don't be late.

1276
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:04,626
Please.

1277
01:15:16,096 --> 01:15:20,017
So, I hear the albacore are really biting
this time of year.

1278
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:24,771
It's not albacore season, Carl.

1279
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:28,650
Oh. Really?

1280
01:15:35,991 --> 01:15:37,576
I'll get that.

1281
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:39,828
It's right over here.

1282
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:45,292
Hello.

1283
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:48,921
Hold on.
Hey. Hey, Carl. Carl. It's Neil.

1284
01:15:49,004 --> 01:15:51,840
Did you actually throw away
your porn collection?

1285
01:15:51,924 --> 01:15:54,051
Look, Neil, I'm having a dinner party.

1286
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:55,969
I'm coming to get it.

1287
01:15:56,053 --> 01:15:57,971
Going to Starbucks! Be back!

1288
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:12,569
Carl, I read your new presentation.

1289
01:16:15,072 --> 01:16:18,659
And how would you feel
about Tony taking it from here?

1290
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:20,911
What?

1291
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:23,497
I hope you guys aren't talking business now.

1292
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,873
Let's keep it at the office.

1293
01:16:24,957 --> 01:16:27,376
No, no, no, not at all. No, we were...

1294
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:30,087
Oh, my God. Is that Mom's crab cakes?

1295
01:16:30,337 --> 01:16:32,714
- They sure are.
- Rabbit, come here.

1296
01:16:32,798 --> 01:16:35,133
- Excuse me.
- Come here, rabbit.

1297
01:16:36,093 --> 01:16:39,388
They look exactly like Mom's.
I can't believe it.

1298
01:16:42,683 --> 01:16:45,185
Oh, yeah. Go ahead. Give it to Tony.
Tony. Yeah.

1299
01:16:45,269 --> 01:16:46,645
Yeah. Want to give it to Tony?

1300
01:16:46,728 --> 01:16:49,273
Yeah, I have a pretty goddamn
big problem with that.

1301
01:16:49,356 --> 01:16:51,275
Is that what you're saying?
You'd be demoting me?

1302
01:16:51,358 --> 01:16:53,944
Tony deserves it! Give it to Tony!

1303
01:16:54,278 --> 01:16:56,571
Do you think I care? Go ahead.

1304
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:58,740
- What are you doing?
- Son of a...

1305
01:17:00,409 --> 01:17:02,160
- Huh?
- Your father's got it out for me.

1306
01:17:02,244 --> 01:17:03,495
- Oh, Carl!
- No, no, no!

1307
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:05,414
You know he asked me
to get a vasectomy?

1308
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:06,623
- What?
- He's crazy!

1309
01:17:06,707 --> 01:17:08,709
Carl, first of all,
this is my father you're talking about!

1310
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:10,043
He's irrational.

1311
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:15,882
- Who...
- You want...

1312
01:17:17,509 --> 01:17:19,678
- What was that?
- Oh, my God.

1313
01:17:23,557 --> 01:17:26,351
- You. What the hell?
- Oh, my God. Dupree!

1314
01:17:26,435 --> 01:17:28,228
What did I tell you? Molly, don't.

1315
01:17:28,312 --> 01:17:29,938
I'm okay. I just slipped on the drainpipe.

1316
01:17:30,022 --> 01:17:31,148
Come on. Let's get in the house.

1317
01:17:31,231 --> 01:17:32,399
I didn't want to bother you guys.

1318
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:34,359
- Put him out by the curb!
- Carl.

1319
01:17:34,443 --> 01:17:37,571
- Why am I getting blamed for everything?
- What's going on here, Carl?

1320
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:40,365
Daddy, will you please grab Dupree's things?

1321
01:17:40,449 --> 01:17:43,410
- I was just trying to get my stuff.
- What?

1322
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:53,628
You know, Molly, I don't know that
I really have time for dinner. I might just...

1323
01:17:53,712 --> 01:17:55,672
- You know, I really don't want to impose.
- Here.

1324
01:17:55,756 --> 01:17:57,591
- Maybe I... I know, but I...
- No. You're staying.

1325
01:17:57,674 --> 01:17:59,301
You're gonna eat something.
It's fine. You're eating.

1326
01:17:59,426 --> 01:18:01,595
Here, have some salad. It's good.

1327
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:03,972
I put a little extra balsamic like you like it.

1328
01:18:04,097 --> 01:18:06,350
Thanks. Thanks.

1329
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:08,769
Eat something.

1330
01:18:09,102 --> 01:18:12,272
Well, it does look tasty. Thank you.

1331
01:18:15,942 --> 01:18:17,027
Sir?

1332
01:18:19,446 --> 01:18:23,033
That's a beautiful Schwinn bike
you got out there, Dupree.

1333
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:26,703
Thank you.
Although it's not exactly state-of-the-art.

1334
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,830
It's about 25 years old,

1335
01:18:28,955 --> 01:18:32,376
so sometimes I feel like it's tough
to keep up with the other riders on the road.

1336
01:18:32,459 --> 01:18:34,336
Now, I don't buy that.

1337
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:37,923
<i>Did you read Lance Armstrong's book,
It's Not About the Bike?</i>

1338
01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:40,550
The bike. Touché. And it's true.

1339
01:18:40,634 --> 01:18:42,886
It isn't about the bike. It's about here.

1340
01:18:42,969 --> 01:18:44,930
It's about your heart. And that's the truth.

1341
01:18:45,013 --> 01:18:46,890
And I've said it to Carl. If you...

1342
01:18:48,183 --> 01:18:49,768
Did you see his seventh win?

1343
01:18:49,851 --> 01:18:51,269
- The final one?
- The last one?

1344
01:18:51,353 --> 01:18:53,188
- I watched every stage.
- Carl. Get the phone.

1345
01:18:53,313 --> 01:18:55,857
Me, too.
I've watched every single one of those races.

1346
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:57,984
- Did you ever cry?
- Oh, yeah.

1347
01:18:58,068 --> 01:19:00,654
I defy you to watch that and not cry.

1348
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:02,489
Daddy? Excuse me.
Could you pass the wine, please?

1349
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:03,657
What color was your bike?

1350
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:05,492
- Hello.
- Hey, Carl.

1351
01:19:05,826 --> 01:19:07,202
Hey, hey. It's Neil.

1352
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:09,621
<i>Okay, so is it in, like, the garbage,
or did you recycle it?</i>

1353
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:12,290
Listen, you sleazebag. Get off my property!

1354
01:19:12,374 --> 01:19:16,002
I'm tired of this crap!
Get the hell out of here! Go home!

1355
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:17,504
Jackpot

1356
01:19:29,516 --> 01:19:31,435
It's the wrong number.

1357
01:19:37,607 --> 01:19:39,401
You like to fish, Dupree?

1358
01:19:39,526 --> 01:19:41,736
I'm not the world's greatest fisherman.

1359
01:19:41,862 --> 01:19:44,990
Although I did have
one pretty great adventure.

1360
01:19:45,073 --> 01:19:48,076
True story.
Off the coast of Baja during spring break,

1361
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:51,037
I spent four days reeling in this marlin.

1362
01:19:51,121 --> 01:19:53,874
Great, big, old shitkicker,
and I finally landed him.

1363
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:55,083
Four days?

1364
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:57,043
Well, I hope you mounted that son of a bitch.

1365
01:19:57,127 --> 01:20:01,548
No. I didn't. Catch and release, Bob.
Honor the fish.

1366
01:20:03,467 --> 01:20:05,302
That's really noble.

1367
01:20:06,136 --> 01:20:10,932
Dupree. How would you like to
go fishing with me in my boat?

1368
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:12,267
Really?

1369
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:14,769
Yeah. Just the two of us.

1370
01:20:14,895 --> 01:20:17,314
Chick-a-boom. Chick-a-boom.

1371
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,735
Why not?

1372
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:25,405
Hey, Bob, is it just me,
or are the albacore really jumping?

1373
01:20:26,823 --> 01:20:28,033
You're funny.

1374
01:20:28,116 --> 01:20:31,119
What type of fool thinks
it's albacore season?

1375
01:20:31,286 --> 01:20:34,122
Dupree, from now on, you call me "Dad."

1376
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:38,251
Yeah. Go out there. Maybe bring Molly along.

1377
01:21:07,364 --> 01:21:10,158
Nice, Dupree. Need some of this?

1378
01:21:14,162 --> 01:21:16,248
You sure you're okay with this, Bob?

1379
01:21:16,331 --> 01:21:18,792
As long as it's not Carl,
you can do anything you want with her.

1380
01:21:32,472 --> 01:21:36,685

couch-burning masturbator!

1382
01:21:38,645 --> 01:21:41,356
- You ruined my life! You ruined my life!
- Carl, get off of him! Stop it!

1383
01:21:41,481 --> 01:21:43,483
Get a hold of yourself!

1384
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:46,570
- Oh, my God!
- I will not get a hold of myself!

1385
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:48,863
- This is my house!
- Are you kidding me?

1386
01:21:48,989 --> 01:21:52,367
What are you gonna do,
hit me with that thing?

1387
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:54,244
- You gonna hit me?
- Carl, stop it!

1388
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:55,537
Come on! I dare you!

1389
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:57,914
Dad!

1390
01:21:57,998 --> 01:21:59,499
You dared me.

1391
01:22:03,712 --> 01:22:06,590
Don't tell me you want the porn back,
because you can't have it!

1392
01:22:06,673 --> 01:22:08,341
Why is it all Asian?

1393
01:22:08,425 --> 01:22:10,302
Whoa,
what's with the bag of frozen peas, man?

1394
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:12,012
There was a little bit of
a blow-out at the house.

1395
01:22:12,095 --> 01:22:14,764
My wallet's still there and my car's boxed in.

1396
01:22:14,848 --> 01:22:17,267
It's not a big deal. I need a place to stay.

1397
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:19,561
- I've got nowhere to go.
- You want to stay here?

1398
01:22:19,686 --> 01:22:21,688
- Yeah.
- Yeah. That'll be fun.

1399
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:24,691
That'll be really cool. Let me ask Annie.

1400
01:22:25,859 --> 01:22:27,319
- Yo, Annie.
- What?

1401
01:22:27,402 --> 01:22:29,029
- Carl wants to stay here.
- Carl?

1402
01:22:29,112 --> 01:22:32,032
Oh, really? I just got off the phone
with Molly. He tried to kill Dupree.

1403
01:22:32,115 --> 01:22:33,867
- He cannot stay here.
- He needs somewhere...

1404
01:22:33,992 --> 01:22:35,952
What are we gonna do?
Be afraid in my sleep? No!

1405
01:22:36,036 --> 01:22:39,831
- Tell him to leave! Now! Now!
- Okay. Fine. I said fine!

1406
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:44,294
Look, I don't know what you did,
but she just talked to Molly.

1407
01:22:44,377 --> 01:22:46,046
She's freaked out at you right now, man.

1408
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:48,632
Neil, what are you saying?
I can't come into your house right now?

1409
01:22:48,715 --> 01:22:50,800
You cannot come in here.

1410
01:22:50,884 --> 01:22:52,761
She said so, man. She makes the rules.

1411
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:55,680
You know what? I don't need this, Neil.

1412
01:22:56,348 --> 01:22:59,100
- I don't need this.
- I don't need this!

1413
01:22:59,726 --> 01:23:01,686
- I'm sorry!
- Neil, get back in here!

1414
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:03,772
She controls what I do!

1415
01:23:03,897 --> 01:23:06,900
Guys' night. Thursday. I'll see you there.

Dr. Grayhead to the ER.</i>

1417
01:23:12,739 --> 01:23:15,784
Frankly, Molly,
I'm worried about your safety.

1418
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:17,952
Maybe I should have Paco
come stay at the house.

1419
01:23:18,078 --> 01:23:20,163
Oh, Dad, please. I don't need this right now.

1420
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:23,708
Molly, I love you more than anything,
but you're an idealist.

1421
01:23:23,792 --> 01:23:25,669
You don't see the world the way it is.

1422

1423
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:38,640
The doc says
most of my injuries are emotional.

1424
01:23:39,432 --> 01:23:41,976
Dad. I'm going to ask you something,

1425
01:23:42,102 --> 01:23:45,146
and remember,
you've never lied to me before.

1426
01:23:46,773 --> 01:23:49,818
Do you ever really want
my marriage to work?

1427
01:23:55,573 --> 01:23:58,618
That's a really complicated question, Molly.

1428
01:23:59,786 --> 01:24:02,455
No. Actually, it's not.

1429
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:04,624
Dupree.

1430
01:24:04,749 --> 01:24:06,751
Molly? Molly.

1431
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:15,301
Bob, before I go,
I have my own question for you.

1432
01:24:16,136 --> 01:24:20,140
And remember, you've never lied
to me either, as far as I know.

1433
01:24:21,933 --> 01:24:24,728
Who did you really want to get a vasectomy?

1434
01:24:24,811 --> 01:24:28,440
Me? Or was it, in fact, Carl?

1435
01:24:30,358 --> 01:24:32,819
Take care of your neck, Dupree.

1436
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,656
Okay, Bob.

1437
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:01,366
Carl?

1438
01:26:11,543 --> 01:26:13,920
He didn't come home last night.

1439
01:26:23,096 --> 01:26:24,931
He loves you, Molly.

1440
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:30,311
I know. I know.

1441
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:37,777
Maybe it's just not enough.

1442
01:27:09,893 --> 01:27:14,397
It has to be enough. It is enough.

1443
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:19,903
Dupree, you gotta piece this beautiful thing
back together again.

1444
01:27:19,986 --> 01:27:24,991
By God, it took 36 years, 9 months,
and 23 days for the mother ship to speak.

1445
01:27:25,825 --> 01:27:27,619
Well, guess what?

1446
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:31,497
Dupree hears you.

1447
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:37,253
Okay, gather around! Come on!
Everybody, gather around! Over here!

1448
01:27:37,337 --> 01:27:38,421
What's going on, Dupree?

1449
01:27:38,504 --> 01:27:40,423
I'm gonna tell you what's going on.
We got an emergency.

1450
01:27:40,506 --> 01:27:42,342
That's why I gave you permission
to miss school.

1451
01:27:42,425 --> 01:27:44,260
Now, listen. Carl's missing.

1452
01:27:44,344 --> 01:27:46,095
He ran away from home last night.

1453
01:27:46,179 --> 01:27:48,514
It's up to us to find him. And here's the deal.

1454
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,516
I don't know what he's capable of.

1455
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,603
If he attacks you, go limp. Play dead.

1456
01:27:53,686 --> 01:27:55,605
That's what I did, and I think it saved my life.

1457
01:27:55,688 --> 01:27:58,191
Toshi, pass out these fliers.
Give them to everybody.

1458
01:27:58,274 --> 01:28:01,110
- Okay, Nancy, go to Neil's house.
- Okay, I'm on it.

1459
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:02,612
Go. Go! Cesar, get up here.

1460
01:28:02,695 --> 01:28:04,530
- I want you to hit the grocery store.
- Got it.

1461
01:28:04,656 --> 01:28:07,283
Thompson Land Development.
Danger! Be careful here.

1462
01:28:07,367 --> 01:28:08,701
Go! Go! Fall out!

1463
01:28:08,826 --> 01:28:13,039
And if you see him, call someone.
Do the buddy system. Run!

1464
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:18,795
I'm just looking for this guy,
Carl Peterson, if you see him. Right here.

1465
01:28:18,878 --> 01:28:21,714
I've just lost my friend. Carl Peterson.

1466
01:28:21,798 --> 01:28:24,550
Here you go. Just stand there.
Put your head through this.

1467
01:28:28,805 --> 01:28:30,390
Carl!

1468
01:28:34,686 --> 01:28:37,855
Here you go. There you go.
Looking for a friend. That's all.

1469
01:28:45,488 --> 01:28:49,242
And he took his hat.
That was real. His American Legion hat.

1470
01:28:49,325 --> 01:28:51,244
The colonel. Give us a break.

1471
01:28:55,915 --> 01:28:57,417
Back again, huh?

1472
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,168
Just came in to make a pit stop.

1473
01:28:59,252 --> 01:29:02,547
Well, that's good
'cause your cot's been taken.

1474
01:29:03,881 --> 01:29:05,925
What's he talking about?

1475
01:29:14,892 --> 01:29:17,854
How's Becca doing?
Is she coming in later?

1476
01:29:20,857 --> 01:29:23,026
In case you think I'm still in love with Molly,

1477
01:29:23,109 --> 01:29:25,278
maybe you should take a look at these.

1478
01:29:25,945 --> 01:29:29,782
They're all about Mandy. Love poems.

1479
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:34,871
Sonnets. Little ditties, haikus.

1480
01:29:35,288 --> 01:29:36,789
I loved her.

1481
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:39,876
How come you never told me
you wrote poems?

1482
01:29:40,084 --> 01:29:43,588
I don't know.
I guess I figured you'd call me a homo.

1483
01:29:44,422 --> 01:29:46,632
Well, I guess I might have.

1484
01:29:46,799 --> 01:29:51,888
Listen, if there's one thing I know about,
it's loving and losing.

1485
01:29:51,971 --> 01:29:54,390
But you can't lose unless you stop waiting.
And...

1486
01:29:54,474 --> 01:29:56,392
Look, Dupree.
Listen, I'm really not in the mood

1487
01:29:56,476 --> 01:29:57,643
for one of your soliloquies.

1488
01:29:57,769 --> 01:30:00,063
- My life's in the shitter right now.
- Yes, it is.

1489
01:30:00,146 --> 01:30:02,148
But what are you gonna do? Quit?

1490
01:30:02,231 --> 01:30:05,651
So what if you made some mistakes.
Everybody does.

1491
01:30:05,735 --> 01:30:07,153
So what if her dad hates you.

1492
01:30:07,236 --> 01:30:09,822
You think you're the first guy
to be hated by his father-in-law?

1493
01:30:09,906 --> 01:30:12,408
So what if he beat your ass
with a candlestick.

1494
01:30:12,492 --> 01:30:14,494
That's probably happened before.

1495
01:30:14,577 --> 01:30:18,414
The point is, is somewhere along the road,
you lost your magic.

1496
01:30:18,498 --> 01:30:21,751
They knocked you off your game.
Your Carlness went right out the window.

1497
01:30:21,834 --> 01:30:25,505
What's with this "Carlness"?
It's not even a real word.

1498
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:27,090
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, it is?

1499
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:29,425
It's a verb. It's a conjunction,

1500
01:30:29,509 --> 01:30:32,095
a preposition, it's a philosophy, a way of life.

1501
01:30:32,178 --> 01:30:34,931
It's your name with "ness" attached to it.

1502
01:30:35,014 --> 01:30:38,184
Bullshit. There's never been any Carlness.

1503
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:41,813
There's just Carl.

1504
01:30:47,693 --> 01:30:51,656
Well, I'm glad we got that straightened out.
My mistake.

1505
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:01,541
You know, the truth is,

1506
01:31:01,624 --> 01:31:04,794
I never really thought
you and Molly were right for each other.

1507
01:31:04,877 --> 01:31:07,880
There was something about her
I never bought, right from Jump Street.

1508
01:31:07,964 --> 01:31:10,383
That whole, "Hey, look at me.
I'm a great person.

1509
01:31:10,508 --> 01:31:14,637
"I'm always smiling. I'm pretty. I'm smart.
I work with inner city kids."

1510
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:18,391
Get the hell out of there.
I saw through that sham, and you did, too.

1511
01:31:18,474 --> 01:31:20,726
And if you want to know the truth,
frankly, I'd blame her.

1512
01:31:20,852 --> 01:31:22,436
- Now, wait a minute!
- No, I won't hold it!

1513
01:31:22,562 --> 01:31:24,689
- Hold on a second!
- Your life is going to hell in a hand basket!

1514
01:31:24,772 --> 01:31:27,441
Molly is the best damn thing
that ever happened to me.

1515
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,278
- Leave her out of this.
- Sure she is.

1516
01:31:30,403 --> 01:31:33,114
Did you see what just happened?
When I tricked you?

1517
01:31:33,239 --> 01:31:35,741
All of a sudden you had that instinct to fight,
that Carlness.

1518
01:31:35,867 --> 01:31:39,120
That's what this situation needs.
It's crying out for it.

1519
01:31:39,579 --> 01:31:43,457
You're trying to get it back,
that fight, the will to fight.

1520
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:45,585
You're thinking.

1521
01:31:47,587 --> 01:31:49,630
Come on. What do you got?

1522
01:31:50,339 --> 01:31:53,134
Dupree, get your helmet.

1523
01:31:57,930 --> 01:31:59,182
Shit.

1524
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:02,268
Paco's on duty.

1525
01:32:03,477 --> 01:32:07,106
- Hey, can you get me 10 minutes in there?
- I'll get you 15.

1526
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:10,109
Hold on a second.
He's a lot faster than he looks.

1527
01:32:16,616 --> 01:32:19,744
Hello there.
Have a message I need to deliver.

1528
01:32:19,827 --> 01:32:22,163
- Do you have identification?
- No.

1529
01:32:22,455 --> 01:32:25,333
You kidding me? Just got the old bike here.

1530
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:28,044
Pretty obvious I'm a bike messenger.

1531
01:32:31,172 --> 01:32:32,965
What are you, Samoan?

1532
01:32:33,049 --> 01:32:34,217
What do you think?

1533
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:37,720
Could be Greek. Could be Italian.
Either way, you're a big man.

1534
01:32:37,803 --> 01:32:39,513
It's okay, I specialize in big men.

1535
01:32:39,639 --> 01:32:40,973
Where is your message?

1536
01:32:41,057 --> 01:32:43,017
I keep 'em up here. Saves on the paperwork.

1537
01:32:43,142 --> 01:32:45,686
All right. Have a good day.
Maybe I'll see you around.

1538
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:50,858
Come on.

1539
01:32:51,859 --> 01:32:53,236
Hold it.

1540
01:33:00,368 --> 01:33:02,495
They said you were quick.

1541
01:33:03,829 --> 01:33:07,583
Easy now, big 'un.
I got to tell you, you're catching me on a day

1542
01:33:07,667 --> 01:33:11,254
where I'm throwing
seven different kinds of smoke.

1543
01:33:11,671 --> 01:33:14,382
Yeah? Let's see them.

1544
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:22,682
That's what I thought.

1545
01:33:22,932 --> 01:33:24,684
That's number one.

1546
01:33:25,559 --> 01:33:28,896
Baby wants to play chase? Okay, let's chase.

1547
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:32,024
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

1548
01:33:36,696 --> 01:33:38,447
Up or down? Up or down?

1549
01:33:38,531 --> 01:33:40,032
Down!

1550
01:33:45,371 --> 01:33:47,957
- Gotcha.
- Missed! Number two.

1551
01:33:52,878 --> 01:33:54,755
Mr. Peterson-Thompson?

1552
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,299
Where is he?

1553
01:33:58,426 --> 01:34:00,261
Stop! Stop!

1554
01:34:00,386 --> 01:34:02,471
Catch up!

1555
01:34:15,818 --> 01:34:17,987
Guy in chair. Number three.

1556
01:34:20,823 --> 01:34:23,075
Did you see that? I got him.

1557
01:34:27,913 --> 01:34:30,416
Dispatch, lock down the building.

1558
01:34:31,751 --> 01:34:34,045
That was my number four.

1559
01:34:34,128 --> 01:34:38,090
- What's number five?
- I can't tell you. I don't know myself.

1560
01:34:41,761 --> 01:34:44,847
Nice job, weasel. Now it's on!

1561
01:34:57,026 --> 01:35:00,279
Number five, invisible.

1562
01:35:00,363 --> 01:35:02,114
What is he doing?

1563
01:35:05,868 --> 01:35:09,538
You can manufacture these
for $90 a square foot.

1564
01:35:09,622 --> 01:35:11,999
You sell them at $400 a square foot.

1565
01:35:12,124 --> 01:35:15,252
You got 25 in this whole arena right here.

1566
01:35:15,336 --> 01:35:17,963
I even think you can do the advertisement,

1567
01:35:18,047 --> 01:35:20,299
"Fifty million

1568
01:35:22,968 --> 01:35:24,470
"square feet."

1569
01:35:26,889 --> 01:35:28,724
Come here, weasel!

1570
01:35:31,352 --> 01:35:32,812
Number six.

1571
01:35:34,188 --> 01:35:36,899
- Open the door.
- I need a number seven.

1572
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,318
Oh, shit.

1573
01:35:46,867 --> 01:35:48,828
I need a number seven!

1574
01:35:49,995 --> 01:35:53,124
You want Samoa? I'll give you Samoa!

1575
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:14,395
Hello. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me.

1576
01:36:14,937 --> 01:36:18,357
You know, for the last 14 hours,

1577
01:36:18,941 --> 01:36:21,152
all I've thought about is kicking your ass.

1578
01:36:21,235 --> 01:36:23,863
Don't make me look
for another candlestick, Carl.

1579
01:36:23,946 --> 01:36:27,533
I've taken you down once.
I could do it again.

1580
01:36:28,284 --> 01:36:30,453
Not today, Bob. Not today.

1581
01:36:31,203 --> 01:36:34,957
- I'll go get Paco.
- Yeah. You go get Paco.

1582
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:38,502
You've done everything you can
to undermine me.

1583
01:36:38,586 --> 01:36:42,548
You've tried to intimidate me.
You've tried to humiliate me.

1584
01:36:43,215 --> 01:36:47,470
You bastardized my project
to the point where it's unrecognizable.

1585
01:36:47,553 --> 01:36:50,639
But here's the thing, Bob. I don't care.

1586
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:53,976
I don't care about this job,
and I don't care about you.

1587
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:55,895
I care about Molly.

1588
01:36:57,646 --> 01:37:00,566
She means everything in the world to me.

1589
01:37:02,109 --> 01:37:06,071
And if you're going to stand in the way
of me trying to win her back,

1590
01:37:06,155 --> 01:37:09,241
you'd better bring a pretty big candlestick.

1591
01:37:14,997 --> 01:37:16,248
Carl?

1592
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:19,168
Hey, Carl.

1593
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:26,300
You... Will you all excuse us?

1594
01:37:30,012 --> 01:37:32,598
Can everybody go?

1595
01:37:47,446 --> 01:37:51,158
You know, Carl, I've been thinking

1596
01:37:52,493 --> 01:37:55,204
- maybe I was a little rough on you.
- A little?

1597
01:37:55,287 --> 01:37:59,166
But you got to understand,
you know, I love Molly, too.

1598
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:05,047
And I've been having a really,
really tough time letting go of her.

1599
01:38:06,632 --> 01:38:09,009
You asked me to get a vasectomy.

1600
01:38:10,135 --> 01:38:12,721
Yeah, that was a little excessive.

1601
01:38:15,516 --> 01:38:16,976
I apologize.

1602
01:38:21,564 --> 01:38:24,316
I'm not gonna hyphenate my name, Bob.

1603
01:38:25,693 --> 01:38:26,986
I know.

1604
01:39:25,377 --> 01:39:27,713
Hey. There's Carl and Dupree.

1605
01:39:32,593 --> 01:39:34,386
Dupree found Carl.

1606
01:40:04,917 --> 01:40:06,418
He's on his own now.

1607
01:40:07,086 --> 01:40:08,295
Molly?

1608
01:40:16,762 --> 01:40:17,971
Molly?

1609
01:40:47,668 --> 01:40:48,961
Molly.

1610
01:40:50,295 --> 01:40:51,630
I'm sorry.

1611
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:07,688
Don't ever walk out on me again.

1612
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:10,899
Even

1613
01:41:11,233 --> 01:41:14,153
I know. I lost it.

1614
01:41:17,239 --> 01:41:18,866
I didn't know what I was doing anymore.

1615
01:41:18,949 --> 01:41:21,577
Well, Carl, I don't always know
what I'm doing, either.

1616
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:25,289
But we are in this together,
when it's good, when it's bad.

1617
01:41:25,372 --> 01:41:26,623
Yeah.

1618
01:41:26,707 --> 01:41:29,710
I mean, so you launched yourself
across our dining room table

1619
01:41:29,793 --> 01:41:32,713
at your best friend like a crazy person.

1620
01:41:34,923 --> 01:41:36,300
- I guess I...
- But, Carl,

1621
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:40,596
I know who you are. And I love who you are.

1622
01:41:43,015 --> 01:41:46,226
And that's why we don't walk out
on each other.

1623
01:41:50,689 --> 01:41:52,441
I love you, Molly.

1624
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:59,031
And I promise you, I'm not going anywhere.

1625
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:15,339
Yes! My work is done here.

1626
01:42:27,434 --> 01:42:30,896
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

1627
01:42:33,357 --> 01:42:35,359
Come on! Let's go! Go!

1628
01:42:35,442 --> 01:42:39,071
Who wants some ice cream?
Go down there and you get it. Go!

1629
01:42:46,954 --> 01:42:48,121
Yeah!

1630
01:42:54,628 --> 01:42:56,839
<i>Life may knock you down. Scratch that.</i>

1631
01:42:56,922 --> 01:42:58,131
I'm okay.

1632
01:42:58,215 --> 01:43:00,843
Life will knock you down. Okay?

1633
01:43:00,926 --> 01:43:04,346
It'll kick you in the gut
and knock you to the curb.

1634
01:43:04,429 --> 01:43:07,057
But you can't let it rob you of your "ness."

1635
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:10,686
Now what's "ness"?
It's your name plus "ness."

1636
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:13,856
You, sir, white-haired gentleman,
what's your name?

1637
01:43:13,939 --> 01:43:16,817
- My name's Joe.
- No! It's Joeness.

1638
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:19,027
You follow me? Listen to me.

1639
01:43:19,111 --> 01:43:22,447
Hang on to that, and as long as you do,
you'll always be ready.

1640
01:43:22,531 --> 01:43:26,618
Because when that moment comes,
and trust me, it will come,

1641
01:43:27,369 --> 01:43:29,413
that's when you start throwing

1642
01:43:31,123 --> 01:43:33,417
seven different kinds of smoke!

1643
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:49,349
The mother ship hears you!

1644
01:43:50,017 --> 01:43:52,311
Paco! Kick it!

1645
01:49:09,211 --> 01:49:10,587
Lanceness.

1646
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:13,423
Lance-ness.

1647
01:49:14,591 --> 01:49:16,635
Lance... ness.
