00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,651
Let's go, Thompson!

4
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,070
-Go, Bobby!
-You got it!

5
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,488
-That's it, man!
-Whoa, whoa!

6
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,657
Go, go! Go, get on...

7
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,659
Safe!

8
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,507
This is last call!

9
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,555
-You all good, Paul?
-All good, Hank. All good.

10
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,058
Thanks, Spo.

11
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,435
Hank, you're the best.
Thanks, brother.

12
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,812
Come on, guys.

13
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,487
Your boys are dead.
The Mets own the wild card, man.

14
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,491
I love you, Amtrak,
but with all due respect, fuck off.

15
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,659
Hank! Come on!

16
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,913
Hey! You guys,
you can't dance in here.

17
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,040
-That's bullshit.
-The fuck?

18
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,084
Blame Giuliani. He says it's a crime.

19
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,085
Fuck you.

20
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,630
You motherfucker. Come fucking
dance with me. Come here. Let's bachata.

21
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,882
-Take it easy, buddy.
-Kick some fucking ass, Hank.

22
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,008
I got it.

23
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,512
All right, round of shots on me,
then you gotta go.

24
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,931
-Fuck yeah!
-All right.

25
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,474
I got the good stuff for you.

26
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,767
Fucking teenyboppers.

27
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,269
-Hey, Hank.
-Salud.

28
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,146
You cool closing up,
doing the cash drop?

29
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,233
All right, then.
We shall read some poetry

30
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,278
and watch the sunrise from my rooftop.

31
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,531
-Yes!
-So it was 1975.

32
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,742
And Lou asked me to come see Andy.
But what I didn't know was...

33
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,870
All right, drink 'em if you got 'em!

34
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,999
-Cool up here, Britt?
-Yeah, I got it.

35
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:39,678
Yo!

36
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,433
Not sure I recognise the face,
but they look familiar.

37
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,101
Classy.

38
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,187
You're the one flashing your tits.

39
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,731
I made a save tonight. OD.

40
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,024
That's incredible.

41
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,485
I've got post-shift adrenaline.
I'm not thinking clearly.

42
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,947
Let's go back to your place and you can
take advantage of my poor judgment.

43
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,908
I depend on your poor judgment.

44
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,327
I'll be right out.

45
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,788
The Giants scored 18 runs yesterday.

46
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,916
They couldn't score two runs today.

47
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,085
So how are they gonna
make up three games playing like that?

48
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,130
Nothing you're saying
is even a little bit sexy.

49
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,382
I'm sexy without saying anything.

50
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,093
So then shut the fuck up.

51
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,730
Come on, kids, get a room.

52
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,816
I'm sorry, Miss Kitty.

53
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,571
You all right? Hey.

54
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,782
Oi! What the fuck you doing, geezer?

55
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,284
We've got a fucking comedian in the house.

56
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,870
Is that the best you can do?
You sound like Dick Van Dyke, mate.

57
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,956
All right, Yvonne?
Looking nice.

58
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,874
Little booty call, is it?

59
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,794
-Charming as always, Russ.
-All right. What's up?

60
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,546
Nothing's up.
I need you to mind Bud for me.

61
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,632
Whoa, no, no.
I am not good at taking care of things.

62
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,342
-Who's Bud?
-My flatmate.

63
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,593
His cat.

64
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,678
-I like cats.
-Good.

65
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,514
-He's a biter.
-He never fucking bit you. He loves you.

66
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,890
There's gotta be
someone else.

67
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,684
Hey, listen!
Stop thinking about yourself!

68
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,061
My dad had a stroke, yeah?
I've gotta fly back to London.

69
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,522
So just feed him, give him
a little love and that, right,

70
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,190
and he'll be fucking happy.

71
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,609
Dudes. Kinda late.

72
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,695
-Fuck off, Duane.
-Sorry, Duane.

73
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,948
I like to party
but some of us work in the morning.

74
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,366
-Fuck off, Duane.
-Sure thing, Duane.

75
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,076
It's not like I wanna call the cops
or anything.

76
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:30,163
Hey! Fuck off with your Wall Street job
and your fucking money and all!

77
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,999
-My dad's dying here!
-Russ.

78
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:32,958
You fucking rotten cunt!

79
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,293
You're lucky
I don't skin you alive

80
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,752
and feed you
to the fucking cat!

81
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,963
You know, I'm not
some douchebag finance yuppie.

82
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,298
Yes, you are!

83
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,217
I build websites.

84
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,553
That is very cool, Duane.

85
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,804
Good night, man.

86
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,723
You mean good morning.

87
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,186
"I build websites."

88
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,482
Do you hear that?

89
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:58,817
Cat.

90
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,111
You think Duane'll call the cops on him?

91
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,615
That's sad.
I'm gonna go check on him.

92
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,200
All right, well, hurry back.

93
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,540
Mailbox one.
You have one new message.

94
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,250
Hi. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

95
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,835
Henry, it's Mom.

96
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,254
Jack cut my hours back again.

97
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,633
And our boys?
Eighteen runs yesterday and zip-all today?

98
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:23,634
Exactly.

99
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,260
They're making me crazy.

100
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,305
They'd have the wild card locked
if you were on the team.

101
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,140
Call me. Love you.

102
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,475
Go Giants!

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,185
Love you, Mom.

104
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,270
Ooh! Cat! Cat on the loose!

105
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,232
He's in here.

106
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,776
What's wrong with you?

107
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:41,944
Hey.

108
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,739
Oh, no. Wait a minute. No!

109
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,407
Baby, he's not staying here.

110
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,659
Oh, come on.

111
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,787
-He's gonna get hair all over the bed.
-Look!

112
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,414
He loves you.

113
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,583
I like dogs.

114
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,252
We had dogs growing up.

115
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,795
Of course you did.

116
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,005
You like dogs and baseball.

117
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,217
You call your mom,
send her money when you can.

118
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,261
Such a nice small-town boy.

119
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,015
Small-town boy, huh?

120
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,517
I'm not so nice.

121
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,977
Oh yeah?

122
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,315
Better watch where you point that thing.

123
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,526
You a bad boy?

124
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,777
Try me.

125
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,654
Should I be scared?

126
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,489
You city girls think
you're so tough, huh?

127
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,158
Yeah, we're pretty fast.

128
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,495
How fast?

129
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,955
Faster than you.

130
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:37,916
Oh yeah?

131
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,347
That's a perfectly good beer.

132
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,683
So drink it after.

133
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,243
You OK?

134
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,163
Yeah, I'm fine.

135
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,749
OK.

136
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,309
Breakfast of Champions.

137
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,687
Yep. Better than those
mouldy frozen bagels.

138
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,314
All right.

139
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,277
You gotta go?

140
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,070
Yeah, it's almost 1:00.

141
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:18,785
Sure you're OK?

142
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,412
Yeah. All good.

143
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,250
All right.

144
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,379
You're out of toothpaste.

145
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,133
Call you later?

146
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,676
You got my number.

147
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,979
And the Giants are facing the Buccos.

148
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,524
But they're three games back
with only seven to play.

149
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,610
The Giants are cooked.
Get a fork. Where is my fork?

150
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,155
You want a fork? You want a fork?
I got a fork for you, you f...

151
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:57,950
Hey, Bud.

152
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,409
It's not for you.

153
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:00,744
That's human food.

154
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:02,871
All right?

155
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,081
What?

156
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,959
Oh, you're hungry.

157
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,878
Yeah, all right.
I'll go get you some food.

158
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,975
Hey.

159
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:24,601
Who are you?

160
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,937
Is Russ home?

161
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,981
Who are you?

162
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,984
Big boy.

163
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,861
Mr Baseball.

164
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,072
Take him out with a ball game

165
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,490
Whoa, whoa. hey.

166
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,908
Is Russ in there?

167
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,451
No, he's not here.

168
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:47,541
Liar, liar
Pants on fire

169
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,711
So, where's Russ?

170
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,548
It's none of your business.

171
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:55,841
Let me by.

172
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,092
Watch the bagel, man.

173
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,845
Ah, OK, OK, Mr Baseball.

174
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:01,638
Play ball.

175
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:18,155
-Dude, stop! That's not cool!
-Mind your fucking business!

176
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,489
Call the cops, Duane!

177
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,491
Yeah, stop or I'll call the cops!

178
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,535
No, actually call the cops, Duane!

179
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,912
I'm calling!

180
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,431
Are they gone?

181
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,480
Hey, Bud.

182
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,198
That's not good.

183
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,496
You clock Cindy
with that burnout from Danville?

184
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,622
Yeah.

185
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,958
Melissa said she got with him
to piss you off.

186
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,377
Man, Cindy can do what she wants.

187
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:14,962
Yeah, right.

188
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,631
But for real though.

189
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,466
You see that Dodgers scout in the stands?

190
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,844
Why are you riding me?

191
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,095
What is this today?

192
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,555
He was into you!

193
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,098
Dodgers got the second pick.

194
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,225
-I won't go that high.
-But what if--

195
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,603
No, I'm not getting drafted by the
Dodgers. Fifteenth pick. That's me.

196
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,816
With the 15th pick
of the Major League draft,

197
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,235
the San Francisco Giants select:

198
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,821
Hank Thompson!

199
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,906
That's what I'm talking about.

200
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,412
-You want another one?
-You have to ask?

201
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,956
But if it doesn't bother you, man,

202
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,499
Cindy was looking fine.

203
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,002
Oh shit!

204
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:00,841
Hank!

205
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:04,803
Hey.

206
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:06,889
It's OK.

207
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,557
It's OK.

208
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,642
What...?

209
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,394
Take it easy.

210
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,689
Take it easy. They cut a hole in you.
They took a kidney out.

211
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,275
What? Why'd they do that?

212
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,485
It was ruptured
and it was gonna kill you.

213
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,321
Don't look. Just--

214
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,363
OK.

215
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,116
How long have I--?

216
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,868
You've been in and out of it
for two days.

217
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,787
-Two days?
-Yeah.

218
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,332
Oh shit.

219
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:34,625
What happened?

220
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,877
Oh, my mom.

221
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,795
Is there a phone?
Do you have your phone?

222
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,214
Yeah. Yeah.

223
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:41,465
Can I...?

224
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,135
Two days without a call.

225
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,642
Hey, Mom, it's me.

226
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,938
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
I'm sorry. I just, I was sick.

227
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,441
Yeah, it was just food poisoning.

228
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:03,153
But, hey, I'm OK.
I got a friend with me.

229
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:04,613
No, just a friend.

230
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,741
I was really out of it the last couple
days. What happened with the--?

231
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,245
Really?

232
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,206
Oh, wow, that's great--

233
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,128
Hey, I'm really out of it, so...

234
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,421
can we...?

235
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,049
All right, yeah. I love you.

236
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,175
Go Giants.

237
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,139
Giants are only one game back.

238
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,518
Your priorities fascinate me.

239
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:35,978
I fascinate you.

240
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,396
Not what I said.

241
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,067
Aw, here you are at my bedside.

242
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,485
I just got here.

243
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:48,949
Oh, a cop came by. I didn't know
what to tell her. She left her card.

244
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,660
What the hell happened?

245
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,497
Some guys, they came looking for Russ,
and they got pissed at me for some reason.

246
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,374
Russ. Of course.

247
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,501
I have to get out of here.

248
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,170
You just had surgery.

249
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:05,340
No, I can't afford this. I gotta get out
of here before I rack up a bigger bill.

250
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,136
Yeah, OK, fine.
But there are rules.

251
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,263
Low sodium.

252
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,639
I don't like salt.

253
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:13,807
No smoking.

254
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,184
Smoking is gross.

255
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,518
No caffeine.

256
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,312
Caffeine makes me jittery.

257
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,439
And...

258
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,400
no alcohol.

259
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:25,903
Forever.

260
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:28,989
OK.

261
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,118
Seriously, Hank.
Kidneys process toxins.

262
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,996
Alcohol is a toxin, do you understand?

263
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,372
Yeah.

264
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,375
What, I don't drink that much.

265
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,087
OK.

266
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,298
--gotta scrape the mortgage together
this month.

267
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,051
Anyway, you haven't called me for days.
Are you OK?

268
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,845
Call me.
Love you. Go Giants.

269
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,975
You have to take it easy, tough guy.

270
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,731
I like to be prepared
in case I have to entertain.

271
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,446
I don't like stupid guys, Hank.

272
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,952
Well, if you want a banker or something,
Duane's right down the hall.

273
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:15,993
That's not funny.

274
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,329
He's not a banker.

275
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,624
He builds websites.

276
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:29,716
What is it with you?

277
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,760
What? What do you mean?

278
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,304
Purposely acting stupid
whenever shit gets real.

279
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:36,974
I don't do that.

280
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,852
OK. I do that.

281
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:42,271
But I really don't know what you want.

282
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,857
I wanna know
if I can take this seriously.

283
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,193
You...? You wanna get serious?

284
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:51,446
We're at that place.

285
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,449
Either we go deeper...

286
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,660
or we get out.

287
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,704
OK. So...

288
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,749
What do you need to take us seriously?

289
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,920
I just need to know that you're a guy
that can take care of his shit.

290
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,258
I don't wanna be with someone
who's running away from his life.

291
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:14,595
You run away
from what you're afraid of,

292
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,762
then it owns you.

293
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,821
Call you later?

294
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,239
You got my number.

295
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,451
You got my hat.

296
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,680
What? You don't think I'll do it?

297
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,725
Fuck you.

298
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,033
What's your problem? Shoo.

299
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,578
Not on the bed. Hey, get down!

300
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,456
Bud, come on!

301
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,333
Dude.

302
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,420
There are reasons I like dogs.

303
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,761
Yo, Jason! Still no trash pickup?

304
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,388
Works out OK for me!

305
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,431
Hey, you got any cans in there?

306
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:42,933
Oh, no, man. Just bottles.

307
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,060
Drink a couple tallboys.
Help a brother out.

308
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,645
My bad. Here.

309
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:51,108
Hey, you're all right, Harry.

310
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,570
--and his bodyguards Al and Joseph.

311
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,494
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

312
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,128
Aw, shit.

313
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,757
Off the fuckin' bed!

314
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:53,647
Oh shit.

315
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:55,941
Shit.

316
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:36,523
How many did you see?

317
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:39,026
Three altogether, I think.

318
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:42,112
Detective Roman?
You mind if I use the facilities?

319
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,989
We're not allowed
to crap at a crime scene.

320
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,157
OK.

321
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,284
You have to hold the handle down
or it clogs.

322
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,994
I know how to flush a toilet.

323
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,873
Police work at its most glamorous.

324
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,211
Hey.

325
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,755
Look at that.

326
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,006
Hey, kitty.

327
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,216
He's a biter.

328
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:03,300
I wouldn't--

329
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,888
-Fuckin' man-eater.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

330
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:12,309
So you think you saw three.
Can you describe any of 'em?

331
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:15,979
Well, there were the two Ukrainians
who beat me up the other day, and then--

332
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,606
How do you know they're Ukrainian?

333
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,943
They had accents, and Little Ukraine's
right around the corner.

334
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,736
Yeah, no, they're not Ukrainian.

335
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,572
The mafia took over
that neighbourhood years ago.

336
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:27,950
They didn't sound Italian.

337
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,661
Russian mafia.
More violent than the Italians.

338
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:31,745
Worse food.

339
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:33,372
Well, great.

340
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,083
Hey, you a fan? Or you played?

341
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,835
I played.

342
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,128
College? Semi-pro?

343
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,172
High school.

344
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,967
Oh. Thought maybe you played real ball.

345
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,260
I played real ball.

346
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:53,392
What do you know about
Mr Miner's criminal activities?

347
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,437
Nothing. Russ? He's not a criminal.

348
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:59,690
How long you been here,
Mr Thompson?

349
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:04,194
Well, eleven years in New York
and six, seven years in this place.

350
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,321
Long enough to see all the changes.

351
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,867
Increased policing,
fancy restaurants, gentrification.

352
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:10,868
Yeah.

353
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:12,286
But even with all those changes,

354
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:16,081
you don't get a detective from Narcotics
here on a bullshit assault and robbery.

355
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,624
Narcotics?

356
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,168
I'm here cos Russ Miner,

357
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:22,713
he's a person of interest
in a non-bullshit narcotics investigation.

358
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:24,548
He talk to you about that?

359
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,842
No. He just said he had
to go see his dad in London.

360
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,636
You buy your drugs from Russ?

361
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:31,430
I don't do drugs.

362
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:34,183
-Hardly ever.
-You deal drugs with him?

363
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,559
No, ma'am.

364
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:41,565
When was the last time
you talked to these guys?

365
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:43,400
I don't know.

366
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:46,403
I don't know those guys.

367
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,114
These guys right here?

368
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,991
They're scary monsters.

369
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,160
Whatever you're doing with them,
you should tell me about it

370
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,245
before they decide
you'd look better with your eyes cut out.

371
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:57,831
I'm not doing anything with them.

372
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,542
OK? I...

373
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,343
Are you messing with me?

374
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:12,429
I'm kinda fucking with you.

375
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,807
Never know what'll pop loose.

376
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:19,728
I held it down but it clogged anyway.
I'm done across the hall.

377
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:23,232
You couldn't tell me that
before you ruined this citizen's plumbing?

378
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:24,691
I had to go.

379
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,568
Get the fuck outta here.

380
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,405
All right, I'mma ask you
a direct question.

381
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,448
OK.

382
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:32,908
Are you fucking with me?

383
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:36,203
No. I don't know anything.
I've got nothing to fuck with.

384
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,206
What?

385
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,334
What?

386
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,004
I'm fucking with you again.

387
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,465
Never know what'll pop loose.

388
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:52,135
But experience tells me
you're not telling me something.

389
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:56,014
You think it's something that
doesn't matter. But it might.

390
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:57,516
So one more time:

391
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,810
Is there anything you wanna tell me?

392
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:06,900
I'm really scared.

393
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,195
They don't care about you.

394
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,322
They put me in the hospital.

395
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,324
Collateral damage.

396
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,826
You have nothing to worry about.

397
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,412
Unless the scary monsters come around.

398
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,247
You see them, you call me.

399
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:21,874
All right?

400
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,083
All right.

401
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:25,836
How'd your boys do today?

402
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,630
They beat the Pirates,

403
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:30,549
so one game back.

404
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:32,843
My money's on the Mets.

405
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,345
Good day, Mr Thompson.

406
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,514
OK, fellas, letâ€™s go.

407
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,403
Oh fuck.

408
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,807
What the fuck, Bud?

409
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,809
What did you eat?

410
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:00,597
What's the difference?

411
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,224
And she said they're a little more bitter.

412
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,351
-Well, you know what I say.
-What?

413
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,770
If it quacks.

414
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:08,272
Exactly.

415
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:10,858
That was my point. It's an almond.

416
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:12,776
Russ?

417
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,195
Hello?

418
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:34,756
What are you doing?
I'm double-parked.

419
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:48,145
Detective Roman, NYPD.
Leave a message, call you back.

420
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,688
It's Hank Thompson.

421
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,816
The scary monsters were just here.

422
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:57,237
And I also think I may have found
something important so just call me or...

423
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,741
No. I don't think it's safe here.
I'll call you back.

424
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,372
Hey. Long time no see.

425
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:10,125
You got the licence
of that truck that hit you?

426
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,044
-Screw you, man.
-Hey, man, you OK?

427
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,588
Hey, Paul! Paul! Paul!

428
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:18,467
Oh! Lennox Lewis is in the house, man!
Here, have a drink, champ.

429
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:20,844
No, I can't drink. I need a favour.

430
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,638
Oh, fuck favours! Fuck.

431
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:23,931
No, I can't drink, man.

432
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:25,599
All right, all right, then. OK.

433
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:29,102
Then here's a toast to the Giants.
OK?

434
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:32,439
Giants! Giants! Giants!

435
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:36,860
Don't diss your favourite team, man.
What are you waiting for? Chugalug.

436
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:38,237
All right, just one.

437
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:39,905
Seriously.

438
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:46,245
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother

439
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,330
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint

440
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:51,208
Russ, what the fuck
did you get me into, man?

441
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,710
Scary monsters and super creeps.

442
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:56,129
Hey! Hey, we taking shots?

443
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:58,757
Hey, you call me back
when you get this, man.

444
00:29:58,882 --> 00:29:59,842
Britt!

445
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,095
Hey, barkeep, another brew here.

446
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,263
Fuck off.

447
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,224
Well, all right.

448
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:09,309
Self-service, here we go.

449
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:13,313
-When the Giants come to town
-All right. Go.

450
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:16,149
-Get him the fuck outta here. Jesus.
-You don't wanna get him another drink?

451
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,986
-Hey, we were just having some fun.
-Oh, grow the fuck up, Paul.

452
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:20,362
Watch out!

453
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:23,115
Runner on third, he breaks for home.
It's gonna be close.

454
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,951
He is safe!
And the crowd goes wild!

455
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,494
Out of the fucking way, asshole!

456
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,872
Home base is this way, superstar.

457
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,792
Superstar.

458
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:38,172
Come on, baby. Get out of the street.

459
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:39,840
Let's get you home.

460
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,136
What?

461
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,514
You think that's funny.

462
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:51,935
You want me to face my fears,
but you think that's funny.

463
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,145
What?

464
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:56,023
What is it you're trying to say?

465
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:59,359
I had so much.

466
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,988
It was right here. And then...

467
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:04,114
OK.

468
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:07,409
So you tell me,
how do I face that?

469
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,079
You know, how do I face
when I had so much

470
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:13,582
and now all I have is garbage.

471
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,794
-Garbage. Nice.
-No. Baby.

472
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:19,254
-Taxi!
-I didn't mean you.

473
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:22,341
-Yeah, I'm done babysitting tonight.
-Come on, baby.

474
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:25,802
Hi, Chinatown.

475
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:34,353
Harry, my boy.

476
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:41,276
Oh fuck.

477
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:24,403
Hank!

478
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:55,184
Dale.

479
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:12,951
He's awake.

480
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:19,750
La-Z-Boy.

481
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,460
Dunkin' Donuts.

482
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:24,379
Rise and shine!

483
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:38,977
What'd you do to the cat?

484
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:42,397
I pet the shitty cat.

485
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,775
And it bit me. So...

486
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:47,819
I kicked the shitty cat.

487
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:50,614
No-No-No.
We here to talk to the guy.

488
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,950
OK, OK, OK.

489
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,078
-Put him on a leash.
-Sorry.

490
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:16,681
Let me explain what's happening.

491
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:22,728
These guys, they wanna hit you...

492
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,107
until you tell them things.

493
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:26,567
But I believe

494
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:30,987
that there has to be a better way
to come to an understanding.

495
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,956
Some guys wave a gun around
like it's their...

496
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,208
dick.

497
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:47,920
But I don't need
to wave anything around.

498
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:50,882
Either I get what I want...

499
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,303
or my pistol talk for me.

500
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:55,721
You understand?

501
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:58,348
Russ went to see his dad in London.

502
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:04,646
But first he gave you something, right?

503
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,106
Yeah.

504
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:08,942
Oh yeah. There was a key.

505
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:11,028
Well, he didn't give it to me,

506
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:13,864
but he hid it in the litter box.

507
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:15,908
It's in the bathroom.

508
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,201
All with no hitting.

509
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:19,411
Home run, Mr Baseball.

510
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:21,580
It was in a fake rubber poo...

511
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:24,499
That's where I found it.

512
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:28,128
Look, I got so wasted
I don't remember what happened,

513
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:29,838
but I washed the sheets
and then Jason--

514
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,173
Fake poo.

515
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:33,634
So funny.

516
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:35,385
But no key.

517
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,769
He doesn't understand nice.

518
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,983
-Look what I found.
-Do your thing.

519
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,401
-Stop. Just stop.
-Your turn.

520
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:54,988
Please just stop.
Let me think for a second.

521
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:56,198
I got really dru--

522
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:07,793
No, stop!

523
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:10,879
Where is the key?

524
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:12,756
Wait, just wait, just--

525
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:15,175
Aw fuck!

526
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:19,221
Take him out with a ballgame

527
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:21,473
-What does the key open?
-I don't know!

528
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,141
Take me where there is crowd

529
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:25,060
I don't know!

530
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:29,565
Buy me beer, nuts and crackers, jack

531
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,569
Listen, I got drunk. I blacked out.
I don't remember what I did with the key.

532
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:39,950
Dudes, I can hear whatever
you're doing all the way down the hall.

533
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:41,827
-Who the fuck is that?
-It's the yuppie asshole.

534
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:43,036
Tell him to fuck off.

535
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:44,872
Now.

536
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:46,915
Hey, fuck off, Duane.

537
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:48,333
Dude.

538
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:49,710
Seriously. Fuck off, man!

539
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,422
Hey, dude, how about you fuck off.

540
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,215
Seriously?

541
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,301
Oh, no-no-no-no!

542
00:36:57,426 --> 00:36:59,178
Fuck off, Duane!

543
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:03,473
The fuck are you doin'?!

544
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,144
Lucky guy.

545
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:09,688
control him!

546
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:10,814
Sorry.

547
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,901
The yuppie will call the police.

548
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,527
Come on.

549
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:23,619
We know
that you talked to the lady cop.

550
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:26,413
If you call that bitch again

551
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:28,165
or any cop,

552
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,002
we will kill everyone
you care about in the whole world.

553
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,427
Get the key, call me.
Don't fuck around.

554
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,770
Ball game.

555
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,481
I'm going to Disneyland.

556
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,328
OK, all right. Chill!

557
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:10,832
I couldn't take care of him.

558
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:12,417
Holy shit.

559
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:14,461
-They hurt him.
-Come on.

560
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:19,091
Hey, Buddy.

561
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:21,426
You're on a real fucking roll, Hank.

562
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,887
Seriously, that shit's impressive.

563
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:31,603
Clever.

564
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:34,731
We gotta stop hanging out so much.
Our cycles are syncing up.

565
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:36,733
Cute.

566
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:38,527
All right, let's check this out.

567
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:43,448
All right, not too bad.

568
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:46,410
Just lost a few staples.
Should be OK.

569
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:49,538
-What are you doing?
-I'm calling a bus.

570
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:52,457
-No, you can't call anyone.
-You have to get that closed up.

571
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,001
You do it.

572
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,836
I'm not a doctor.

573
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:58,839
I can't go to the hospital
or anything that might involve cops.

574
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:04,595
Who did this to you?
What's going on?

575
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,013
Stitch it up. I'll be OK.

576
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:08,599
I don't have sutures here.

577
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:10,517
I can't.

578
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:18,150
All right, all right. I have something.
It's gonna leave a nasty scar though.

579
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:26,700
Stop moving. It has to set.

580
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,286
Stay still.

581
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:31,830
OK.

582
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:34,166
Just like they do it on the frontlines.

583
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:37,002
Thank you.

584
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:44,635
Can I...?

585
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,012
Oh, no. You gotta leave that in
for at least a couple days.

586
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:48,931
Very funny.

587
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:54,394
What the fuck, Hank?

588
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,022
I can't remember
what happened last night.

589
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:58,815
Shocker.

590
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,236
Paul said you came in
asking for a favour.

591
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:05,072
started drinking,
were the life of the party,

592
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:07,241
got old and bitter
about baseball, so...

593
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:08,700
The usual.

594
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:11,995
-I have to go.
-What?

595
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:14,748
You still haven't told me
what the fuck is going on.

596
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,917
Something fucked up is happening,
and I gotta deal with it right now.

597
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:20,379
-Let's call the cops.
-No, baby. They said no cops. All right?

598
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:22,422
I can handle it.

599
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:24,091
No. You can't.

600
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:25,759
These people hurt cats.

601
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:26,802
You watch him for me.

602
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:31,932
Yeah, I'll take care of Bud.

603
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:34,017
-You take care of yourself.
-All right.

604
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:35,727
I'll call you later?

605
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:12,055
Paul's Bar. Paul's not here.
And neither is your wife.

606
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,851
Hey, it's Hank. The key I gave you
last night, I need to get it.

607
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:17,811
Can you call me at...?

608
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,152
-Hank!
-Oh shit!

609
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:30,824
Look out!

610
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:35,537
You fucking idiot!

611
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:37,581
Pay attention!
What the fuck are you doing?

612
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:54,014
Sorry!

613
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:09,446
Hank.

614
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:11,114
Why you running?

615
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,449
-For what?
-Relax. Just relax.

616
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:13,742
No, no, no!

617
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:20,249
Hank!

618
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,377
Move! Move!

619
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:48,819
Fuck!

620
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:01,832
Paul's Bar. Paul's not here.
And neither is--

621
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:23,187
Another beer?

622
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:27,733
Yeah, sure.

623
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:36,408
It's Hank Thompson.

624
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,660
Hank. Did you remember something?

625
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:40,078
I know where the key is.

626
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,458
-Don't make me guess.
-I'm gonna go get it now.

627
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,210
I'll go with you.
To keep you company.

628
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:48,337
No, it's with a friend.
I'm not taking you there.

629
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:49,588
Which friend?

630
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:52,799
Ah, the chica in Chinatown.

631
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:54,843
-What?
-"What?"

632
00:43:55,177 --> 00:44:00,307
What? I told you what we'd do
to the people you care about, Hank.

633
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:30,212
Oh no.

634
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:37,928
Oh God! Oh God!

635
00:44:42,516 --> 00:44:44,893
911. What is your emergency?

636
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:47,771
Hello? Can you hear me?

637
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:57,906
When you left a message
and didn't call back,

638
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:00,284
I got curious,
so then I looked you up, Hank.

639
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:02,661
There I was shining you
about playing real ball,

640
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:04,329
and you were an actual phenom.

641
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:08,000
Old man must have
coached you real good.

642
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,501
Eighteen.

643
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:13,046
Set to be a top pick
in the Major League draft.

644
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:15,257
Then you messed it up.

645
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:17,801
Your dad must have been
pretty disappointed.

646
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:27,144
So much for baseball.

647
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:30,147
You think you'd learn from that...

648
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,107
but here we are.

649
00:45:37,154 --> 00:45:38,071
That...

650
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:39,781
is a contact wound.

651
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,700
The gun was like this.

652
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:45,370
Somebody gained entry
into her apartment,

653
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:48,790
waited for her,
then executed her.

654
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:51,668
Whatever you're into got this girl killed,

655
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:54,046
and it's my job to make sure
nobody else gets murdered.

656
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,715
I'mma need some information
so that I can do that.

657
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,175
So either you tell me...

658
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:03,472
You got that?

659
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:15,275
Look, no more looking at those.

660
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:19,947
Let's get you outta here.

661
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:22,783
Come on.
Let's get a coffee.

662
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,326
All right?

663
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,294
What?

664
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:43,220
You gonna tell me what's going on?

665
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,810
I'd like evidence
you possess the power of speech.

666
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:53,981
It was my mom.

667
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:56,066
Your mom what?

668
00:46:56,817 --> 00:46:58,193
Baseball.

669
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:00,028
Mom was my coach.

670
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:03,657
Right on, Mom.

671
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:07,035
So these Russians you're messed up with,
Pavel and Aleksei?

672
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,955
They front a local franchise
for a truly evil fucker

673
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,457
out in Brighton Beach, Igor Dolokhov.

674
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,960
And the redhead,
the Puerto Rican guy, Colorado?

675
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:17,462
He runs a couple nightclubs
over on their turf.

676
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:19,506
He's the one who killed Yvonne.

677
00:47:19,965 --> 00:47:23,886
-He gave you that whole pistola speech?
-Yes. Exactly.

678
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:24,887
It's all a front.

679
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:28,098
Asshole talks big, but he ain't
got the balls to pull the trigger.

680
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:32,769
Now, execution-murder,
that's the Drucker brothers' style.

681
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:35,355
Lipa and Shmully. The Hasids.

682
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:39,568
Wait, but...
she had nothing to do with them.

683
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:42,571
Well, they followed
the Russians to you and you to her.

684
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:45,073
And you ran, and you pissed them off.

685
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:47,117
So they left a message:
Don't fuck with us.

686
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:53,707
Look, this whole clusterfuck
is all about money.

687
00:47:54,374 --> 00:47:56,585
An exotically huge amount of cash.

688
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:59,296
And that key opens
wherever it's hidden.

689
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:01,590
And Russ stole it. Not you.

690
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:03,675
Hank.

691
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:06,345
It's not your fault.

692
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,891
I should have called you.

693
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:14,561
She was right.
Why didn't I listen to her?

694
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:17,523
I'm such a fu--

695
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:26,073
The key is at the bar where I work.

696
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:31,703
I gave it to my boss to hide it,
and then I got drunk and I forgot.

697
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:33,956
OK?

698
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:36,959
OK.

699
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:39,586
Here you go.

700
00:48:40,796 --> 00:48:42,130
OK.

701
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:44,424
This...

702
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:46,885
This is what I came here for.

703
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:52,724
So, what do we do now?

704
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,434
We wait for backup.

705
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:57,437
You ever had a black-and-white?

706
00:48:58,397 --> 00:48:59,982
Come on. Try it.

707
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:02,442
You're missing out.

708
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:06,989
I was a kid,

709
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:10,826
black-and-white, it was
the only thing worth a shit down here.

710
00:49:11,577 --> 00:49:13,954
I'm talking real Alphabet City.

711
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,623
None of that gentrified
chichi bistro bullshit.

712
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:20,460
I grew up in the projects right over there
in Riis Houses off Avenue D.

713
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:23,797
Grew up down here, work down here.

714
00:49:23,922 --> 00:49:26,049
Ain't gonna fucking die down here.

715
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:29,928
When all of this is over,
I'm going to Tulum.

716
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:34,975
Beaches, pool bar that you swim up to...

717
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:40,731
I'mma sit there, listen to the waves,
think about my new life.

718
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:44,943
Only thing I'mma miss is this cookie.

719
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:51,158
Backup has arrived.

720
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,248
Where you going, Hank?

721
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:03,795
Nice hat.

722
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:06,298
All right, here we go.

723
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:16,475
OK. So?

724
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,227
How's it look in there?

725
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:21,396
The owner and some fat guy
are doing coke at the bar.

726
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:25,776
How much longer will the gordo ese
hang out with your boss?

727
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:32,324
What's his problem?

728
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:34,117
He thinks you killed his girl.

729
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:37,496
I told him you don't have the balls
to pull the trigger.

730
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,206
Ha-ha-ha.

731
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:41,458
Let's go in.

732
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,836
No. We don't have to go in.

733
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:46,255
He's gonna bring it to us.

734
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:49,299
OK. Good.

735
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:52,594
You go in and get the key.

736
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:54,930
Fuck you, you motherfucker!

737
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:57,224
Hey! Knock that shit off!

738
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:02,437
Hank, you seem to be missing
the essence of the situation.

739
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:05,649
It doesn't matter who killed your girl.

740
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:09,695
What matters is that you do what you need
to do so that nobody else gets killed.

741
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,197
So, what you're gonna do is
you're gonna go into the bar,

742
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:16,368
you're gonna get the key and you're
gonna bring it to us. And then that's it.

743
00:51:16,702 --> 00:51:18,370
It's over. Nightmare ends.

744
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:21,874
You got one minute, Hank.

745
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:26,837
Or we're comin' in.

746
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:32,593
Nuh-uh. The cat stays here.

747
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:36,096
It's OK, Bud.

748
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:42,311
And then she turns to me
and asks me if I love her.

749
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:45,647
That's a legit question
for a lady to ask her gentleman friend.

750
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:48,984
What, are you helping me
or are you fucking with me?

751
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:52,946
Listen, who the fuck knows more
about romance, you or me? Give me this.

752
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:54,990
-Me, motherfucker.
-Really?

753
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:57,743
Yeah. I'm very in tune with my femininity.

754
00:51:58,744 --> 00:51:59,786
No shit!

755
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:00,996
Let me in.

756
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:03,665
Here comes trouble.

757
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:06,960
-No coke for him.
-No booze either.

758
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:11,256
Hey, top o' the mornin' to you,
my fine friend.

759
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,549
I need my key, man.

760
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:14,635
A key of what?
Are you selling weight?

761
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:16,011
My key. Right now.

762
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:18,847
Where did you lose it?
Maybe it's in the lost and found drawer.

763
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:20,557
I didn't lose it.
The key that I brought you last night.

764
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:24,311
Was that before or after
you fucked up the felt on the pool table?

765
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:26,355
Where is the key that I gave you?

766
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,816
You didn't give me anything.
All you gave me is a pain in the ass.

767
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:32,319
-What?
-Hey, good morning.

768
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:34,530
-Hold on. I just need one more minute.
-Quiet.

769
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:37,658
-Hey, you having a party?
-It's my place.

770
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:40,869
-We're not harming anybody here.
-I don't have to see everything I see.

771
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:43,038
-Hank, what's going on?
-Mr Thompson

772
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:44,915
is helping
with an investigation.

773
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:46,917
-He gave you a key last night?
-Listen, I think--

774
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:49,586
You could tell us where that key is
or we could search your place.

775
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:52,673
-You got a fucking warrant for that?
-This is not your problem, gordo cabrÃ³n.

776
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:54,508
Don't call me fucking gordo cabrÃ³n.

777
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:56,301
Tell your boss you wanna
reclaim your property.

778
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:58,345
Yeah. Yeah, but I...

779
00:52:58,428 --> 00:52:59,763
-No, no, no.
-Hey, cool it, Amtrak.

780
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:03,475
-You flash your fucking gun at me?!
-Hey, Amtrak!

781
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,185
-This guy's no fucking cop.
-Hey, chill!

782
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,646
I know cops,
and that's no fucking cop!

783
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:09,857
Oh fuck!

784
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:14,069
Amtrak. Amtrak!

785
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:15,988
-Where is the key?
-No, come on, man!

786
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:17,573
-You got five seconds.
-No!

787
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:19,032
What are you doing?

788
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:20,742
Getting answers.

789
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:23,495
-I got it handled.
-What the fuck is he talking about?

790
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,997
-Put the gun down.
-Wait, just--

791
00:53:25,122 --> 00:53:26,540
-Stop counting, listen to me.
-Calm down.

792
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:29,543
-Calm down!
-Tell him to put the fucking gun down!

793
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:31,044
Please, man. Please, please.

794
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:35,090
God!

795
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:39,511
Fucking thank you.

796
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:48,604
That supposed to fool anyone?

797
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:50,772
It's just supposed to look like a thing,
all right?

798
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,191
Confuse the issue.

799
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:54,693
It looks like a thing.

800
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:58,030
Hank gave you a key.

801
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,948
I want it.

802
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,034
-Wait, wait--
-It's in the safe.

803
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:04,494
-Paul, I--
-Yeah. Hank.

804
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:07,789
The key is in the safe.
It's where you told me to put it.

805
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:13,629
11-15-64.
It's fussy. You gotta jiggle it.

806
00:54:17,382 --> 00:54:21,887
-Give me the numbers again.
-11...15...64.

807
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:23,347
But I'm telling-- You gotta--

808
00:54:24,056 --> 00:54:27,809
Yeah, it's really tricky. You have
to know how to do it. You can't do it.

809
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:28,936
Oh fuck!

810
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:30,437
Yeah. Fuck.

811
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:33,941
OK.

812
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:36,568
You open it and then come out.

813
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:38,403
All right?

814
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:39,988
Understood.

815
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,371
She's very sensitive here.

816
00:54:48,038 --> 00:54:50,290
Only lets me touch her.

817
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:52,125
There you go, baby.

818
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:55,003
Oh, hey. Hank, it's here.

819
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:58,048
I got it. Oh shit!

820
00:54:58,173 --> 00:54:59,925
-Out.
-Fuckin' knees.

821
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:02,010
Gun!

822
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:08,016
Motherfucker!
Come into my bar!

823
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:10,143
You killed my best friend!

824
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:14,606
What the fuck, Hank?! What's happening,
man?! Who are those guys?

825
00:55:15,148 --> 00:55:16,733
They killed Amtrak.

826
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:18,944
They shot up my bar.
Fuck 'em!

827
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:22,155
Get down!

828
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:29,496
They shot at my fucking lizard!
Let's go!

829
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:31,498
Just wait for the cops!

830
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:33,417
No, Paul! Paul! Don't, don't!

831
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:49,016
-Drop the key through the slot, Hank.
-I don't know where the fucking thing is!

832
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:51,143
OK, it's not the end of the world.

833
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:53,353
Just come out and we can--

834
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:56,064
-I'm not coming out.
-You gotta come out, Hank.

835
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,484
You get arrested now
and all of this is gonna land on you.

836
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,944
I'll make sure of it.

837
00:56:01,862 --> 00:56:02,905
We have to go.

838
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:06,033
I can get you out of this mess, Hank.

839
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:08,327
But I have to have that key.

840
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:11,038
You get arrested, you're fucked.

841
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:12,349
Hey. Hey, Jason. Jason.

842
00:57:12,474 --> 00:57:15,269
-I'll fucking cut you! Back up!
-Hey, hey, it's Hank. Harry.

843
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:17,646
Harry.

844
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:21,775
-Hey, you got my pants, man.
-Oh man, I really like these pants.

845
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,695
I know, but I think
I left something in the pocket.

846
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:29,032
I'm sorry to disturb you, buddy, I just--

847
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,953
You mean this?

848
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,789
Yes, I do. Thank you.
You keep the pants.

849
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:38,750
Aw, man, you're all right, Harry.

850
00:57:58,312 --> 00:58:00,898
You have one new message.

851
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:03,650
Henry! Oh my God,
can you believe our boys?

852
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:07,112
They're streaking, and the Mets and Cubs
are shitting the bed.

853
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:09,656
They're gonna do it,
even without their superstar.

854
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:12,618
I wish I could afford to fly out.
We could watch the game together.

855
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:15,162
Hey, you feeling any better?

856
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:16,705
Call me. Love you.

857
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,081
Go Giants!

858
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:46,068
You fuck! Why'd you hit me
in the fucking head, you twat?!

859
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:48,904
What the fuck did you get me into?
What is this shit?

860
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:50,155
Just hang on!

861
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,156
Dudes.

862
00:58:57,329 --> 00:58:58,956
He's a fucking cunt, 'ey, Hank?

863
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:01,416
You're a cunt.
Why did you stick me with this?

864
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,670
-What, gimme that. Gimme that!
-What does it open?

865
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:07,881
-Where is the money?!
-What money?

866
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,175
They killed Yvonne, Russ.

867
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:15,013
Mate...

868
00:59:20,477 --> 00:59:22,521
Let's go get my wheels, yeah?

869
00:59:25,607 --> 00:59:27,526
-You drive.
-No.

870
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:29,570
-You're driving.
-No, I'm not.

871
00:59:29,695 --> 00:59:31,655
Mate, my vision's fucking blurred.

872
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,365
I don't drive.

873
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:35,993
Every cunt from California drives.

874
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:38,161
-Not me.
-What do you mean not you?

875
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:39,705
Fuck you.

876
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:41,790
Did you never learn?

877
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:44,293
Is that why
they kicked you out of Hollywood?

878
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:45,711
I'm not from Hollywood.

879
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,130
It's a fucking turn of phrase, Hank.

880
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:55,179
What? It's the Idles!

881
00:59:56,471 --> 00:59:58,056
Buckle your seat belt.

882
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:08,025
Reports this morning of a shoot-out
in an East Village bar.

883
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,401
At least three are reported dead.

884
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:11,195
Police are searching
for an employee of the bar

885
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:13,113
who fled police custody
earlier...

886
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:17,910
You fucked up, mate.

887
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:19,286
I fucked up?

888
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:24,416
Fuck you, Russ!
Yvonne was executed like this.

889
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:26,084
And then Colorado killed Amtrak.

890
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:30,214
Then Roman, she shot Colorado in the head
and then they killed Paul.

891
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:32,341
Not Paul.

892
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:34,051
What the fuck are you doing
with these people, man?

893
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:35,552
I will explain.

894
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,014
But only if you promise
to stop banging me in the fucking head.

895
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:41,683
-Yeah?
-Fine.

896
01:00:42,893 --> 01:00:44,019
Look, mate, it's simple.

897
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:49,399
In my younger days I made an acquaintance
with Lipa and Shmully, the Hebrews.

898
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:53,362
I became their token gentile,
as it were, shifting a little gear.

899
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:54,947
What kind of gear?

900
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:57,282
Fucking tennis shoes, Hank. Lollipops.

901
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:59,409
Drugs, mate. That's what I do.

902
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:01,203
I deal out of Colorado's clubs.

903
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:02,162
Fuck off!

904
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:05,832
So now, I lost track
of Lipa and Shmully in the years,

905
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:07,668
but recently they reappeared,

906
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:11,672
having come into possession of an indecent
fuckin' amount of Belgian ecstasy.

907
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,549
The fucking right bollocks, it was.

908
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:16,760
Makes your eyes go fucking that way
and your jaw do that like a pirate ship.

909
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:19,137
But the shame of it was,

910
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:22,057
I happened to be
recently busted by Roman.

911
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:25,853
Owed her a snitch on something
or she'd lock me up.

912
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:28,230
So when I heard about the X...

913
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:29,857
I filled her in.

914
01:01:29,982 --> 01:01:34,069
But, filth that she is,
she's not interested in making an arrest.

915
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:39,575
See, because she's in debt herself to
this evil fucking Russian mob boss Igor.

916
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,161
-Whoa. You all right?
-All right. All right.

917
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:47,416
So Roman brokered the deal to sell the X
through Colorado's clubs on Igor's turf.

918
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:49,084
Everyone gets a cut.

919
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:50,627
But here's the rub.

920
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:53,255
None of these fucks
trust each other with the cash flow.

921
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,174
They wanna do a big split at the end.

922
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:58,302
And for that, my friend,
they need a banker.

923
01:01:58,427 --> 01:02:00,679
And they trusted you
to be their banker?

924
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:03,265
I'm not some fucking wanker.
I do this for a living.

925
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:04,808
I know 'em. I've got history.

926
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:08,854
Plus, also, I'm scared shitless of 'em.
They know I won't fuck 'em over.

927
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:11,398
-Except you did fuck them.
-But not on fucking purpose.

928
01:02:11,523 --> 01:02:13,025
You said your dad had a stroke.

929
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,610
Yeah, he's fucking dead.

930
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:19,948
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.

931
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:23,410
-So you weren't trying to rip 'em off?
-No!

932
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:28,332
I got a call about Dad, I went home.
That whole flight I was mental.

933
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:33,295
I get to London, Dad's in the fucking ICU,
half his face is like a pudding and...

934
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:37,466
Mate, fuck, I'm spinnin'.

935
01:02:40,302 --> 01:02:42,638
And it fucking hits me.
I dodged out without telling anyone.

936
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:44,014
I call the answering service.

937
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:45,933
I've got a thousand messages
saying how dead I am

938
01:02:46,016 --> 01:02:47,851
if I don't produce the money.

939
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:49,603
So where is it?

940
01:02:56,485 --> 01:02:58,195
What you waiting for?

941
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:04,993
Here, hold this.
Make yourself useful.

942
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:14,503
Welcome to fucking Narnia.

943
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:25,556
Supposed to do the big split
the day I left.

944
01:03:27,724 --> 01:03:29,434
How much is there?

945
01:03:30,435 --> 01:03:31,645
Wee bit over...

946
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:33,397
four million.

947
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:36,608
And you put the key in a litter box?

948
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,235
Yeah. I didn't expect
my next-door neighbour

949
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:40,195
to go through the fucking
cat shit, did I?

950
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:44,074
OK. All right. So we call Roman.

951
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:45,701
-We tell her we have it.
-No, we can't trust her.

952
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:47,369
It's more complicated than that.

953
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:51,331
Fuck complicated! I wanna go home.
I wanna see my mom. I--

954
01:03:51,456 --> 01:03:52,541
Oh shit.

955
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:54,209
Mom.

956
01:03:55,252 --> 01:03:56,795
Phone. Phone.

957
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,297
You wanna phone your mum?

958
01:03:58,422 --> 01:03:59,464
Yeah.

959
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:02,342
Just don't use up my minutes.

960
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:05,012
Yeah. And you're welcome, by the way.

961
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:09,016
Fuck you.

962
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:18,567
Hey, Mom. It's me.

963
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:22,696
Yeah, they're doing great.
Hey, listen.

964
01:04:22,821 --> 01:04:28,160
There's going to be news on the TV maybe
or maybe the police will...

965
01:04:29,786 --> 01:04:32,998
Mom, Mom, you gotta listen to me.
It is not true, OK?

966
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:34,917
I didn't do what they say.

967
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:39,087
-Mom, I can't explain right now.
-Get off the phone.

968
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:41,423
-I'm OK. I have to go. I love you.
-Get off the phone.

969
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:42,674
Go Giants.

970
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:46,887
They all think I fucked 'em, Hank.
I'm dead.

971
01:04:47,304 --> 01:04:49,431
Even if I show up with the money.

972
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:51,600
So I'm gonna take it all and run.

973
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:53,560
Catch a flight at LaGuardia.

974
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:55,521
So, what happens to me?

975
01:04:57,022 --> 01:04:59,107
Sorry, mate. You're fucked.

976
01:05:00,943 --> 01:05:02,027
Get in here.

977
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:03,362
Please.

978
01:05:04,488 --> 01:05:05,656
Get in here!

979
01:05:06,698 --> 01:05:09,409
OK. All right, here's your phone.

980
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:36,395
All right.

981
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:42,943
Russ, the fuck have you been?

982
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:45,195
-It's Hank.
-Hank?

983
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,864
Russ came back.

984
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:48,991
-And I have the money.
-Interesting.

985
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:52,286
Now, you said you could
get me out of this. How?

986
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:56,498
It's gonna take a lot of payoffs.
So I need the money.

987
01:05:57,457 --> 01:05:58,917
And one other thing.

988
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,502
I'm listening.

989
01:06:00,669 --> 01:06:02,171
A fall guy.

990
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:05,048
Unless you wanna do 20 to life.

991
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:06,675
Yeah, I got one of those.

992
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:10,345
All right. Here's where
you're gonna bring the money.

993
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,181
No, I'll tell you where.

994
01:06:12,723 --> 01:06:14,808
Fine. What's your plan?

995
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:17,436
First, I want the cat.

996
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:19,188
Where are we goin'?

997
01:06:19,313 --> 01:06:20,189
LaGuardia.

998
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:21,315
Yes!

999
01:06:22,274 --> 01:06:23,317
You drive.

1000
01:06:23,442 --> 01:06:25,027
-I'll tell you where to go.
-No, it...

1001
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:28,363
You're driving.
Put your seat belt on. It'll be fine.

1002
01:06:31,116 --> 01:06:32,034
Watch out!

1003
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:33,452
Oh shit!

1004
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:35,913
Oh yeah. I'm all right.

1005
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:37,414
-All right?
-Pull off, pull off.

1006
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:39,082
Shut up. I'm driving.

1007
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:44,004
All right, stop here.

1008
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:53,639
We're early.

1009
01:06:53,764 --> 01:06:55,599
It's time for 1010 WINS Sports
with baseball.

1010
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:58,060
The Mets are at Shea today
with the Braves. They need to win to--

1011
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:02,272
Mike Piazza takes ball three. Two on.

1012
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:04,024
Fuckin' baseball.

1013
01:07:04,149 --> 01:07:06,026
Giants are fightin' for the wild card.

1014
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:09,071
I'll talk about the Premier League
and see if you give a fuck.

1015
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:13,242
Meanwhile, in Colorado, the Giants
have taken a one-run lead in the first.

1016
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:14,868
Fuck yeah.

1017
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:18,288
Oh! Mr Whippy.

1018
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:22,626
Are we in Flushing Meadows?

1019
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:25,587
We have to pick up Bud
before our flight.

1020
01:07:25,712 --> 01:07:26,630
Buddy?

1021
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:28,048
Where is he?

1022
01:07:28,549 --> 01:07:30,717
Oi. Who'd you give my cat to?

1023
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:36,723
I didn't give him to anyone.

1024
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:43,021
Oh, you fucking cunt!
She'll kill me!

1025
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:44,189
-Shut up.
-No, fuck off.

1026
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:45,649
-She'll kill me.
-It's gonna be OK.

1027
01:07:45,774 --> 01:07:47,818
She'll fucking kill me,
then she'll fucking kill you.

1028
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:49,778
Just... Stop.

1029
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:51,738
You have to trust me, Hank.

1030
01:07:51,864 --> 01:07:53,282
Why would I ever do that?

1031
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:57,494
Mr Baseball!

1032
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:00,831
Fuck!

1033
01:08:00,956 --> 01:08:03,333
-Where's the money?
-I don't have the money.

1034
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:04,251
Don't trust her.

1035
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:06,461
The point was for you
to bring the money.

1036
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:09,673
I brought the key,
and Russ will take you to the money.

1037
01:08:09,798 --> 01:08:10,924
Hank! She killed Yvonne.

1038
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:12,968
No, Hank. You'll take me to it.

1039
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:14,344
-It's not gonna happen.
-She'll murder you!

1040
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:16,180
-Then she'll murder me!
-Both of you get in the car.

1041
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:18,140
No! I'm not going fucking anywhere!

1042
01:08:18,265 --> 01:08:20,350
-Russ. Russ!
-Fuck you! Fuck!

1043
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:21,435
Hey, hey, hey!

1044
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:24,520
Fuck.

1045
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:26,106
Ow!

1046
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:31,653
Yeah, that's right! Fuckers!
That's it, fucktards, back up!

1047
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:33,572
Bud. Bud.

1048
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:37,910
Don't you move! Don't you move!
Yeah, fuck you, stop.

1049
01:08:38,035 --> 01:08:40,453
Get the cat in the car!

1050
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:42,080
Don't! Back off!

1051
01:08:42,206 --> 01:08:43,457
Fuck you!

1052
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:45,709
Fuck! Fuck, fuck.

1053
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:49,046
-Get out of the way!
-Oh fuck, fuck, fuck!

1054
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:50,546
Oh fuck!

1055
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:51,465
Fuck!

1056
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:55,969
What're you doing?!

1057
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:58,346
Fuck you, you fucking horrible cunt!

1058
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,515
Shit!

1059
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:02,600
-Fuck!
-Fuck!

1060
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:05,979
Fuck! Fuck!

1061
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,482
Hank, I think Roman
really did kill Yvonne.

1062
01:09:08,607 --> 01:09:09,649
Stop saying that!

1063
01:09:09,774 --> 01:09:11,484
Listen!
Yvonne was shot in the temple, right?

1064
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:12,736
Stop talking about it!

1065
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:14,904
And Roman shot Colorado
that exact same way, yeah?

1066
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:17,407
Russ, there's no reason
for Roman to do it!

1067
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:20,118
But what if Roman was
at Yvonne's looking for the key.

1068
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:23,412
Yvonne came in and that was that.
Bang! One in the temple.

1069
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:29,545
Fuckin' hell!

1070
01:09:30,754 --> 01:09:32,631
Go faster. Faster, Russ!

1071
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:34,675
Dude, I'm going
as fast as I fucking can!

1072
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:46,937
-Where am I going?
-Go right.

1073
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:48,272
-Go right!
-Got it.

1074
01:09:50,649 --> 01:09:52,401
Whoa! Fuck!

1075
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:53,443
OK!

1076
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:55,028
Oh, shit a brick!

1077
01:09:55,153 --> 01:09:56,947
-Where you going?
-Jesus fucking--

1078
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:01,368
Fuck you!

1079
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:03,537
-Go faster.
-Oh, you motherfuckers!

1080
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:06,206
No! Fuck!

1081
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:07,749
You fucking pig fuck!

1082
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:10,002
You motherfuckers! Oh my God!

1083
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:11,920
Oh, fuck!

1084
01:10:12,838 --> 01:10:14,381
-Brake. Brake!
-Wha--?

1085
01:10:24,099 --> 01:10:25,100
Fuck.

1086
01:10:27,186 --> 01:10:28,353
Fuck.

1087
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:31,523
All right, gas, gas, gas.

1088
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:32,691
Very funny, cunts!

1089
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:34,401
Go-Go-Go. Go-Go-Go.

1090
01:10:36,486 --> 01:10:39,448
There they go. Come on, come on, come on!
Letâ€™s go, letâ€™s go!

1091
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:45,704
Whoa. Mate, I really
don't feel too well now.

1092
01:10:46,246 --> 01:10:47,998
Russ. Russ. Hey!

1093
01:10:48,123 --> 01:10:49,124
Russ.

1094
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:50,876
Russ-Russ-Russ!

1095
01:10:55,297 --> 01:10:59,426
Oh, I really don't think
I should be driving.

1096
01:11:01,595 --> 01:11:03,347
Fucking Shea.

1097
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:06,767
I think I left the stove on.

1098
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:10,854
Oh. Yeah.

1099
01:11:23,951 --> 01:11:25,827
-I need to sit down.
-Sorry.

1100
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:27,412
As soon as we get on the train.

1101
01:11:27,538 --> 01:11:29,998
This is the Flushing-Main Street
bound seven local train.

1102
01:11:30,123 --> 01:11:31,458
Left-Left-Left!

1103
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,876
Move, move, move!

1104
01:11:35,295 --> 01:11:38,423
That Giants fan said
the Mets suck shit. You hear that?

1105
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,884
That Giants fan right there!
Fuck you!

1106
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:43,428
Yeah, fuck that Giants fan!

1107
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,605
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

1108
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,384
Wow. Buddy.

1109
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:23,844
It's my cat.

1110
01:12:25,137 --> 01:12:26,930
At the next station,
we switch trains and get you

1111
01:12:27,014 --> 01:12:28,765
to an emergency room,
all right?

1112
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:32,144
I need you to take care of Bud, Hank.

1113
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:33,770
I got him.
He's gonna be fine now.

1114
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:36,732
Make sure you fucking do.

1115
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:39,443
You twat.

1116
01:12:41,528 --> 01:12:43,280
All right. It's time to go.

1117
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:12,392
Starving.

1118
01:13:13,018 --> 01:13:15,062
Chinese or burgers.

1119
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:16,855
I have to eat.

1120
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:21,336
Hey, kid. End of the line.

1121
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:56,622
You there, Hank?

1122
01:14:57,206 --> 01:14:58,999
I have something to say to you.

1123
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:04,087
1115 Hanover Street,
Patterson, California.

1124
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:07,549
You thinking of running back home
to your mom?

1125
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:09,009
Think again.

1126
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:11,553
People around you
keep winding up dead.

1127
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:15,140
Your high school buddy.
Your boss. Your girl.

1128
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:17,893
And now they found Russ
at Grand Central?

1129
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:20,729
Guess that makes you the fall guy.

1130
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:23,065
Everybody thinks you're a killer.

1131
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,816
You're as good as dead.

1132
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:27,486
You bring the money
to the Hermitage Club.

1133
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:28,820
Brighton Beach.

1134
01:15:28,946 --> 01:15:30,197
In two hours.

1135
01:15:30,822 --> 01:15:33,784
Maybe I can stop the collateral damage.

1136
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:36,703
You can't run forever, Hank.

1137
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,473
Fuck!

1138
01:16:44,855 --> 01:16:47,191
No, Ma, you need to leave the house.

1139
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,445
Yeah, I know. I know.
I know what the news says.

1140
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:54,239
Yeah, I know you know it's not true.
But, Mom...

1141
01:16:54,364 --> 01:16:57,826
People got killed because of me.

1142
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:00,871
It's not an accident.

1143
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:02,956
It is not like the car crash, Mom--

1144
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:06,376
No, it's exactly like that, Mom...

1145
01:17:07,252 --> 01:17:08,795
because that was my fault.

1146
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:11,882
I killed Dale.

1147
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:15,552
I did, Mom.

1148
01:17:15,844 --> 01:17:19,139
I killed Dale, and all I thought about
was how I fucked up my knee

1149
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:22,643
and I couldn't play baseball anymore.
I didn't even think about him.

1150
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:25,270
I killed Dale.

1151
01:17:25,395 --> 01:17:26,939
I ran from it.

1152
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:28,774
I never owned it.

1153
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:31,235
Now, listen to me, Mom.
I need you to get out of the house.

1154
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:32,903
You need to go to Jackie's.

1155
01:17:33,529 --> 01:17:35,656
Watch the game at her place, Mom!

1156
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:39,868
Please, please. Will you
promise me that you're gonna go?

1157
01:17:40,661 --> 01:17:43,413
OK. All right. I love you, Mom.

1158
01:17:45,499 --> 01:17:46,750
Go Giants.

1159
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:55,884
Bud. Here you go.

1160
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:19,700
Russ.

1161
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:21,702
No, I'm the neighbour. Hank.

1162
01:18:23,036 --> 01:18:25,330
Hank? The man with the moves.

1163
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:27,833
Yeah. Him.

1164
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:29,293
Where's Russ?

1165
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,128
Dead.

1166
01:18:31,503 --> 01:18:32,963
Well, that's a twist.

1167
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:35,674
But I can get you the money.

1168
01:18:35,799 --> 01:18:37,009
OK.

1169
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:38,677
Do me a favour, Hank.

1170
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:40,846
Don't make us chase you again, OK?

1171
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:43,724
No. I'm done running.

1172
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:47,311
Whoa!

1173
01:18:48,145 --> 01:18:50,189
Hell of a swing you got.

1174
01:18:50,314 --> 01:18:52,482
It reminds me of Gil Hodges.

1175
01:19:20,385 --> 01:19:21,887
It's a nice cat.

1176
01:19:23,347 --> 01:19:26,475
So, Hank, you know
not to mess with us, yes?

1177
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:28,977
-Yes.
-Good.

1178
01:19:29,102 --> 01:19:32,147
-You know where our money is, right, Hank?
-It's locked up.

1179
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,942
Russ had a key.

1180
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:35,901
What happened to Russ?

1181
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:39,238
I killed him.

1182
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:43,617
How'd you do that?

1183
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,495
I hit him with a baseball bat.

1184
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:52,626
So you have his key now?

1185
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,296
No, Roman has it.

1186
01:19:57,297 --> 01:19:59,591
But I'm the only one
who knows where the money's locked up.

1187
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:04,137
I'm supposed to meet her in an hour.

1188
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:10,519
So eager to die
that you'd walk into a trap?

1189
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:12,980
She'll murder my mom if I don't.

1190
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:15,816
Where's the money, Hank?

1191
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:23,448
I'll tell you after you kill Roman.

1192
01:21:06,575 --> 01:21:09,703
We have to do a mitzvah, Hank.
You know what a mitzvah is?

1193
01:21:09,828 --> 01:21:11,788
It's like a special favour.

1194
01:21:11,914 --> 01:21:13,373
I don't suppose you're Jewish, are you?

1195
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:00,838
I don't have the key.

1196
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:04,675
It appears not.

1197
01:22:08,262 --> 01:22:10,180
We are running out of time.

1198
01:22:28,866 --> 01:22:30,617
OK, get dressed.

1199
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:33,287
Eat, skinny boy.

1200
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:34,913
Thank you.

1201
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:40,127
Eat or you're gonna upset her.

1202
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:05,277
The place Roman wants you
to meet her, Hermitage,

1203
01:23:05,402 --> 01:23:07,654
it's Igor Dolokhov's supper club.

1204
01:23:07,988 --> 01:23:10,115
Big fancy place.
Like a Russian Vegas.

1205
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,658
Crawling with Brighton mob.

1206
01:23:11,783 --> 01:23:13,410
They'll be overconfident.

1207
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:15,370
They won't see us coming.

1208
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:20,959
So we're doing this.

1209
01:23:57,579 --> 01:23:58,580
Hank.

1210
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:13,011
If you can't bite,
don't show your teeth.

1211
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:16,640
Thank you.

1212
01:24:24,648 --> 01:24:25,941
-Car!
-Look out!

1213
01:24:26,066 --> 01:24:27,109
Car!

1214
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:32,114
All clear! All clear!

1215
01:24:32,739 --> 01:24:35,492
-This is good. Right here.
-Yes, brother.

1216
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:36,451
OK.

1217
01:24:40,998 --> 01:24:42,708
You ever fired a gun, Hank?

1218
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:44,209
No.

1219
01:24:44,334 --> 01:24:46,420
Pulling the trigger,
easiest thing in the world.

1220
01:24:47,462 --> 01:24:48,589
Sad world.

1221
01:24:48,964 --> 01:24:49,882
Broken world.

1222
01:24:50,674 --> 01:24:51,717
I won't need a gun.

1223
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:54,720
Why would we give you a gun?

1224
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,600
Show me your hands.

1225
01:25:01,685 --> 01:25:03,979
Come on.
Here, lemme see 'em.

1226
01:25:04,104 --> 01:25:05,355
Yeah, come on.

1227
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,274
He's got soft hands, huh?

1228
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:09,568
-Easy. Take it easy.
-Stop, stop. Stay.

1229
01:25:09,693 --> 01:25:10,569
Hey! Stay!

1230
01:25:10,694 --> 01:25:13,697
No-No-No. Come on!
I thought I was going in with you.

1231
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:16,200
Why would we risk your life? Huh?

1232
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:18,619
We need you to take us to the money.
Yes?

1233
01:25:18,744 --> 01:25:20,412
I have to go in.
I have to know it's done.

1234
01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:21,997
If I don't go in,
I don't take you to anything.

1235
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:23,999
Oh, you'll do what we tell you to do.

1236
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:28,462
If you don't, we're not
gonna touch your mommy.

1237
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:33,008
But we'll do things to her beloved son
that'll make her wish she was dead.

1238
01:25:34,801 --> 01:25:35,928
You understand, Hank.

1239
01:25:36,595 --> 01:25:38,222
Wait here. Don't worry.

1240
01:25:40,766 --> 01:25:42,142
All will be well.

1241
01:26:53,505 --> 01:26:54,923
Goddamn it.

1242
01:27:12,524 --> 01:27:15,319
Fuck!
Come on-Come on-Come on.

1243
01:27:26,747 --> 01:27:27,831
Hey, hey.

1244
01:27:27,956 --> 01:27:29,833
Hey, guys! Guys!

1245
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,835
You're going the wrong way!

1246
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:33,378
Guys!

1247
01:27:33,504 --> 01:27:34,630
Shit.

1248
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:51,563
Asshole!

1249
01:28:24,471 --> 01:28:25,931
Mr Baseball.

1250
01:28:28,433 --> 01:28:29,601
Stick 'em up?

1251
01:28:34,106 --> 01:28:35,107
Beer here.

1252
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:36,567
Cracker Jack.

1253
01:28:38,277 --> 01:28:40,320
Do you want fries with that?

1254
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:29,286
The key. Now.

1255
01:29:31,371 --> 01:29:32,206
I don't have it.

1256
01:29:33,248 --> 01:29:34,166
Where is it?

1257
01:29:35,626 --> 01:29:36,835
I threw it in the ocean.

1258
01:29:38,504 --> 01:29:40,255
Are you fucking with me?

1259
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:44,218
You never know
when something'll pop loose.

1260
01:30:07,574 --> 01:30:08,700
Fuck!

1261
01:30:11,662 --> 01:30:14,122
-You can't pull that trigger, Hank.
-Shut the fuck up!

1262
01:30:29,596 --> 01:30:31,473
Oh, you had me going for a minute.

1263
01:30:34,309 --> 01:30:36,186
You're not a fucking killer.

1264
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:39,314
You're right. I'm not.

1265
01:30:43,485 --> 01:30:44,987
But those guys are.

1266
01:30:59,042 --> 01:30:59,960
Get the key.

1267
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:02,754
She doesn't have it.

1268
01:31:04,047 --> 01:31:05,257
What?

1269
01:31:05,382 --> 01:31:06,425
Come on.

1270
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:07,634
Oy.

1271
01:31:08,093 --> 01:31:09,595
-Hey.
-Hank.

1272
01:31:11,138 --> 01:31:13,557
Hey, Bud. It's OK. I got ya.

1273
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:35,787
This guy.

1274
01:31:35,913 --> 01:31:37,039
Meshuggener.

1275
01:31:38,498 --> 01:31:40,417
All right, come on. It's time to go.

1276
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:41,752
Where you going?

1277
01:31:41,919 --> 01:31:42,878
I'm gonna drive.

1278
01:31:43,462 --> 01:31:44,421
It's Shabbas.

1279
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:47,591
My brother the rabbi.

1280
01:31:47,883 --> 01:31:49,176
You drive, Hank.

1281
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:50,302
I don't drive.

1282
01:31:51,178 --> 01:31:54,014
Hank, we've had a sense of humour
with you jerking us around.

1283
01:31:54,473 --> 01:31:58,393
But we're in enough trouble with Hashem
without driving on Shabbas.

1284
01:32:01,104 --> 01:32:02,564
Drive the car, Hank.

1285
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:22,751
-Buckle your seat belts.
-Drive the car, Hank. Please.

1286
01:32:22,876 --> 01:32:24,711
Let's go. Let's go.

1287
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:26,797
There you go.

1288
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,801
Eyes on the road, Hank.
Nice and slow.

1289
01:32:33,512 --> 01:32:35,681
So, what happens to me now?

1290
01:32:37,391 --> 01:32:40,269
Smart thing for us would be
to get rid of you, don't you think?

1291
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:44,064
But the man loves his mommy.

1292
01:32:44,189 --> 01:32:46,859
He tries to do right by her
and is truly meshuga.

1293
01:32:47,818 --> 01:32:50,612
How can we not feel fondness
for a man like that?

1294
01:32:52,948 --> 01:32:54,491
What are you hopin' for, Hank?

1295
01:32:56,785 --> 01:32:57,703
I wanna go home.

1296
01:33:00,038 --> 01:33:04,042
Things you've seen and done,
it may be home has no room for you.

1297
01:33:08,213 --> 01:33:09,214
What?

1298
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:11,842
A clear conscience is what you want?

1299
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:13,719
You think you can have that, Hank?

1300
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:17,222
I don't know.

1301
01:33:33,572 --> 01:33:36,408
What we could do,
we could give you 100 grand.

1302
01:33:36,533 --> 01:33:37,618
A little more.

1303
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:41,413
Maybe a little more than 100 grand
for services rendered.

1304
01:33:43,415 --> 01:33:45,626
A man could run a long way
on that much money.

1305
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:50,005
And besides, you didn't mean to kill Russ.
Maybe the police'll believe you.

1306
01:33:50,631 --> 01:33:53,675
Right? I mean, anyone can see
you're not a real killer, Hank.

1307
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:57,596
So you're doin' me a mitzvah?

1308
01:33:59,389 --> 01:34:01,225
We're doin' you a mitzvah.

1309
01:34:02,809 --> 01:34:05,729
-What happened to the lighter?
-Oh, that's my fault.

1310
01:34:05,854 --> 01:34:07,356
-Brother, Shabbas.
-It's all right.

1311
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:09,107
Hank'll light it for me.

1312
01:34:09,233 --> 01:34:10,275
Here.

1313
01:34:11,026 --> 01:34:12,528
Now you do me a mitzvah.

1314
01:34:27,501 --> 01:34:28,836
Just pull the trigger.

1315
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:32,422
Easiest thing in the world.

1316
01:34:48,772 --> 01:34:51,149
I didn't intend to steal it.
I just needed a light.

1317
01:34:51,608 --> 01:34:52,609
Brother.

1318
01:34:57,739 --> 01:34:59,116
We're sorry about your girl.

1319
01:34:59,867 --> 01:35:02,119
You ran from us, Hank.
You made us chase you.

1320
01:35:02,327 --> 01:35:04,204
We had to let you know
not to mess with us.

1321
01:35:04,288 --> 01:35:06,957
That's true.
No one to blame but yourself.

1322
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:10,127
Sad world.

1323
01:35:12,254 --> 01:35:13,380
Broken world.

1324
01:35:26,435 --> 01:35:27,352
What're you doing?

1325
01:35:28,562 --> 01:35:31,648
Hey, slow down.
We don't wanna draw attention.

1326
01:35:32,649 --> 01:35:33,483
Easy, Hank.

1327
01:35:33,567 --> 01:35:35,819
-Hey-Hey-Hey.
-Slow down.

1328
01:35:35,944 --> 01:35:38,739
-Hank, slow down!
-Hey! What're you doin'?! Hank!

1329
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:41,241
-Hank!
-Slow down! We can sort this out!

1330
01:35:41,366 --> 01:35:42,743
-Hank, Hank!
-Slow down, Hank!

1331
01:35:43,076 --> 01:35:44,828
-Hey! Hank!
-Hank! Slow down!

1332
01:35:44,953 --> 01:35:46,330
Stop!

1333
01:36:26,078 --> 01:36:27,120
Hey.

1334
01:36:28,497 --> 01:36:31,291
You all right? You're all right.

1335
01:36:35,254 --> 01:36:36,421
OK.

1336
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:43,637
We shouldn't have let the goy drive.

1337
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:07,202
So my mates convinced me
to skip the underground.

1338
01:37:07,327 --> 01:37:10,706
Never think you'll get in an accident
in a fucking taxi, do ya?

1339
01:37:10,831 --> 01:37:13,458
I mean, who wears a seat belt,
fucking grannies?

1340
01:37:13,584 --> 01:37:16,503
Went face-fucking-first
into the plexiglass shield, didn't I?

1341
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:18,380
-Anyone else hurt?
-No, just me.

1342
01:37:18,505 --> 01:37:22,676
Tell you what, I'm suing the shit out
of that fucking cab company, though. 'Ey?

1343
01:37:22,801 --> 01:37:24,928
-Bags, Mr Miner?
-Just one.

1344
01:37:26,054 --> 01:37:27,139
Oi.

1345
01:37:29,308 --> 01:37:30,475
Heavy.

1346
01:37:31,059 --> 01:37:34,479
Yeah, well, cables, mini amp and shit.
Playing some gigs down there.

1347
01:37:49,036 --> 01:37:50,078
Have a good trip.

1348
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:51,205
Thank you.

1349
01:37:59,379 --> 01:38:00,214
Next.

1350
01:38:03,425 --> 01:38:04,927
Hey, it's me, Mom.

1351
01:38:05,427 --> 01:38:06,845
Yeah, I'm OK.

1352
01:38:07,262 --> 01:38:09,306
You can go home. It's safe now.

1353
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:14,228
Listen to me.
Mama, I gotta go away for a while.

1354
01:38:14,353 --> 01:38:15,854
But it's gonna be OK.

1355
01:38:17,356 --> 01:38:19,608
No, I can't come home.

1356
01:38:19,733 --> 01:38:22,819
I just need to take care of myself
for a while.

1357
01:38:23,445 --> 01:38:26,907
You're gonna get a package
in the next few days.

1358
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:31,161
It's half of everything
I have in the world.

1359
01:38:32,871 --> 01:38:36,625
Hey, Mom, I gotta go right now,
but I love you so much.

1360
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:39,002
You can watch the tie-breaker at home.

1361
01:38:39,336 --> 01:38:40,671
Go Giants.

1362
01:39:08,448 --> 01:39:10,367
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

1363
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:32,431
Baseball OK?

1364
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:36,727
Beer? Margarita?

1365
01:39:41,315 --> 01:39:42,691
Club soda.

1366
01:39:44,109 --> 01:39:45,360
Nice cat.

1367
01:39:47,571 --> 01:39:49,489
You take good care of him?

1368
01:39:50,407 --> 01:39:51,825
I'm trying.

1369
01:39:54,703 --> 01:39:55,537
He's a biter.

1370
01:39:55,662 --> 01:39:56,955
The bases are loaded.

1371
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:04,046
Barry Bonds, who might not
have even batted this inning,

1372
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:06,965
not only will bat
but he is the possible tying run...

1373
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:09,009
Just you and me, Bud.

1374
01:40:09,134 --> 01:40:12,137
...even though a 5-run deficit
faced the Giants when the inning started.

1375
01:40:12,638 --> 01:40:14,848
So Barry Bonds against Mulholland.

1376
01:40:14,973 --> 01:40:17,768
Six homeruns for Bonds
in those 46 at-bats.

1377
01:40:17,893 --> 01:40:20,604
Bonds batting with the bases loaded
for the second straight time.

1378
01:40:21,563 --> 01:40:22,940
And here comes the pitch.

1379
01:41:10,821 --> 01:41:11,989
Fuck!
