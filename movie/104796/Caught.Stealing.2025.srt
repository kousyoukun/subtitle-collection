是啊。
Yeah.

汉克，你是最棒的。谢了，兄弟。
Hank, you're the best. Thanks, brother.

16
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,854
噢，别这样，伙计们。
Oh, come on, guys.

17
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,651
嗯哼！你们的人已经完蛋了。
Mm-mm-mm! Your boys are dead.

18
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,529
大都会队稳拿外卡了，老兄。
The Mets own the wild card, man.

19
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,533
我爱你，美铁，但恕我直言，滚一边去。
I love you, Amtrak, but with all due respect, fuck off.

20
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,700
汉克！别这样！
Hank! Come on!

21
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,955
嘿！你们几个，这里不能跳舞。
Hey! You guys, you can't dance in here.

22
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,414
胡说八道！
That's bullshit!

23
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,958
- 搞什么鬼？- 都怪朱利安尼。
- The fuck? - Blame Giuliani.

24
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,043
- 他说这是犯罪。- 去你的。
- He says it's a crime. - Fuck you.

25
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,129
你个混账东西。来跟我跳支该死的舞。
You motherfucker. Come fucking dance with me.

26
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,924
- 过来。咱们跳巴恰塔舞。- 放松点，老兄。
-Come here. Let's bachata. -Take it easy, buddy.

27
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,342
- 明白了。
- I got it.

28
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,554
好吧，这轮酒我请，然后你们就得走了。
All right, round of shots on me, then you gotta go.

29
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,973
-太棒了！ -好的。
-Fuck yeah! -All right.

- Hey, Hank. - Salud.

32
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,855
你负责关店和存营业款没问题吧？
You cool closing up, doing the cash drop?

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,481
-嗯。-好的，那就这样。
-Mm-hm. -All right, then.

34
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:14,319
我们将在我的屋顶上读些诗，一起看日出。
We shall read some poetry and watch the sunrise from my rooftop.

35
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:23,078
- 没错！ - 那是 1975 年，卢让我去见安迪，但我当时不知道的是... 好了！有酒就干杯！
- Yes! - So, it was 1975 and Lou asked me to come see Andy, but what I didn't know was... All right! Drink 'em if you got 'em!

36
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,999
- 上面凉快吗，布里特？ - 嗯，我搞定了。
-Cool up here, Britt? -Yeah, I got it.

37
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,262
喂！
Yo!

38
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,764
这张脸我不太认得。
Not sure I recognize the face.

39
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:46,143
- 但他们看起来挺眼熟。 - 有品位。
-But they look familiar. -Classy.

40
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,228
是你自己露胸在先的。
You're the one flashing your tits.

41
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,397
今晚我救了个人 药物过量
I made a save tonight. OD.

42
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,065
太了不起了
That's incredible.

43
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,485
刚下班肾上腺素飙升 我脑子不太清醒
I got post-shift adrenaline. I'm not thinking clearly.

44
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,989
我们回你那儿吧，趁我头脑不清醒的时候。
Let's go back to your place, take advantage of my poor judgment.

45
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,949
我就指望你犯糊涂了。
I depend on your poor judgment.

46
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,285
我马上出来。
I'll be right out.

47
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,663
巨人队昨天得了 18 分。
The Giants scored 18 runs yesterday.

48
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,581
嗯哼。
Uh-huh.

49
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,374
-今天连 2 分都拿不到。-嗯哼。
-They couldn't score 2 today. -Mm-hm.

50
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,127
他们打成这样，怎么可能连扳三局？
How are they gonna make up three games playing like that?

51
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,255
你说的这些话一点魅力都没有。
Nothing you're saying is even a little bit sexy.

52
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,007
我不用说话就很有魅力。
I'm sexy without saying anything.

53
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,135
那你就给我闭嘴。
So then shut the fuck up.

54
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,522
孩子们，找个房间去亲热吧。
Come on, kids, get a room.

55
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,816
对不起，猫咪小姐。
I'm sorry, Miss Kitty.

56
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,029
-噢！-你没事吧？
-Oh! -You all right?

57
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,823
嘿！喂！你他妈的在干嘛呢，老兄？
Hey. Oi! What the fuck you doing, geezer?

58
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,326
哈哈，咱们这儿可有个活宝喜剧演员啊。
Haha. We've got a fucking comedian in the 'ouse.

59
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,912
你就这点本事？听着跟迪克·范戴克似的。
Is that the best you can do? You sound like Dick Van Dyke.

60
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,997
怎么样，伊冯？看起来不错嘛。
All right, Yvonne? Looking nice.

61
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,916
想约个小会是吧？
Little booty call, is it?

62
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,794
-你还是这么风趣，拉斯。-好吧，什么事？
-Charming as always, Russ. -All right. What's up?

63
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,546
没什么大事。我需要你帮我照看一下巴德。
Nothing's up. I need you to mind Bud for me.

64
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,588
-哇，不行。-必须行。
-Whoa, no. -Yes.

65
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,674
不行。我可不擅长照顾东西。
No. I am not good at taking care of things.

66
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,384
-布德是谁？-我的室友。
-Who's Bud? -My flatmate.

67
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,177
-他的猫。-我喜欢猫。
-His cat. -I like cats.

68
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,345
-很好。-它爱咬人。
-Good. -He's a biter.

69
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,556
它可从来没咬过你。它喜欢你。
He never fucking bit you. He loves you.

70
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,890
肯定还有别人。
There's gotta be someone else.

71
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,684
嘿，听着！别再只想着自己了！
Hey, listen! Stop thinking about yourself!

72
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,893
我爸中风了，对吧？
My dad had a stroke, yeah?

73
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,812
我得飞回伦敦。所以你只管喂他就行。
I've gotta fly back to London. So just feed him.

74
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,522
给他点爱之类的，对吧？
Give him a little love and that, right?

75
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,190
他就会高兴得不得了...他会很开心。
And he'll be fucking... He'll be 'appy.

76
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,651
伙计们。有点晚了。
Dudes. Kinda late.

77
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,736
-滚开，杜恩。-抱歉，杜恩。
-Fuck off, Duane. -Sorry, Duane.

78
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,990
我喜欢聚会，但有些人明天早上还要工作。
I like to party, but some of us work in the morning.

79
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,408
-滚开，杜安。-没问题，杜安。
-Fuck off, Duane. -Sure thing, Duane.

80
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,118
我又不是想报警什么的。
It's not like I wanna call the cops or anything.

81
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:30,247
嘿！带着你的华尔街工作和臭钱给我滚远点！
Hey! Fuck off with your Wall Street job and your fucking money and all!

82
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,040
- 我爸快不行了！——拉斯。
- My dad's dying 'ere! - Russ.

83
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:32,958
你这烂透了的混蛋！
You fucking rotten cunt!

84
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,752
没把你活剥了喂猫算你走运！
You're lucky I don't skin you alive and feed you to the fucking cat!

85
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,963
要知道，我可不是那种装腔作势的金融雅痞。
You know, I'm not some douchebag finance yuppie.

86
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,298
是的，你是！
Yes, you are!

87
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,259
我负责搭建网站。
I build websites.

88
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,761
这太酷了，杜安。
That is very cool, Duane.

89
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:45,846
晚安，伙计。
Good night, man.

90
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,723
你是想说早上好吧。
You mean good morning.

91
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,144
"我是做网站开发的。"
"I build websites."

92
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:56,940
嗯。你听到了吗？
Mm. Do you hear that?

93
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,067
- 嗯。 - 猫叫。
- Mm. - Cat.

94
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,278
你觉得杜安会报警抓他吗？
You think Duane'll call the cops on him?

95
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,656
真让人难过。我去看看他。
That's sad. I'm gonna go check on him.

96
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,950
- 好吧，快去快回。- 嗯。
-All right, well, hurry back. -Mm-hm.

97
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,582
- 邮箱一。- 您有一条新留言。
- Mailbox one. - You have one new message.

98
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,292
- 嗨。- 过来，小猫咪，小猫咪。
- Hi. - Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

99
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,877
亨利，是妈妈。
Henry, it's Mom.

100
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,296
唉，杰克又削减了我的工作时间。
Agh. Jack cut my hours back again.

101
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,506
我们的球员呢？
And our boys?

102
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,883
昨天还拿了 18 分，今天就一分未得？
Eighteen runs yesterday and zip-all today?

103
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,469
-确实如此。 -他们快把我逼疯了。
-Exactly. -They're making me crazy.

104
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,514
要是你在队里，咱们早锁定外卡赛资格了。
They'd have the wild card locked if you were on the team.

105
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,307
给我打电话。爱你。
Call me. Love you.

106
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,683
巨人队加油！
Go Giants!

107
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,310
- 爱你，妈妈。
- Love you, Mom.

108
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,270
- 哇！猫！- 猫跑出来了！
- Ooh! Cat! - Cat on the loose!

109
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,273
哦！他在这里面。
Oh! He's in here.

110
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,817
你怎么了？
What's wrong with you?

111
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,528
--嘿。
--Hey.

112
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,781
哦，不。等一下。不行！
Oh, no. Wait a minute. No!

113
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,700
-宝贝，他不会留在这里的。-哦，拜托。
-Baby, he's not staying here. -Oh, come on.

114
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:50,869
他会把毛发弄得到处都是。
He's gonna get hair all over the bed.

115
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:51,828
看！
Look!

116
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,414
他是爱你的。
He loves you.

117
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,418
我喜欢狗。小时候我们家就养过狗。
I like dogs. We had dogs growing up.

118
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:07,302
当然了。你喜欢狗和棒球……你会给妈妈打电话，有钱了就寄钱给她……真是个善良的小镇男孩。
Of course you did. You like dogs and baseball... You call your mom, send her money when you can... Such a nice small-town boy.

119
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,057
小镇男孩，是吧？
Small-town boy, huh?

120
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,559
我可没那么善良。
I'm not so nice.

121
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,726
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

122
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:16,937
噢。
Ooh.

123
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,315
小心你手里的家伙指哪儿。
Better watch where you point that thing.

124
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,819
-你是个坏小子吗？-试试看啊。
-You a bad boy? -Try me.

125
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,696
我该害怕吗？
Should I be scared?

126
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,531
你们这些城里姑娘以为自己很厉害，是吧？
You city girls think you're so tough, huh?

127
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,033
是的，我们相当快。
Yeah, we're pretty fast.

128
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,997
-有多快？-比你快。
-How fast? -Faster than you.

129
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:37,958
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

130
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,347
那可是上好的啤酒。
That's a perfectly good beer.

131
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,184
-那就待会儿喝。-嗯。
-So drink it after. -Mm.

132
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,201
你还好吗？
You OK?

133
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,205
我没事。
Yeah, I'm fine.

134
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,583
好的。
OK.

135
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,351
-冠军的早餐。  -没错。
-Breakfast of champions. -Yep.

136
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,687
比那些发霉的冷冻贝果强多了。
Better than those moldy frozen bagels.

137
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,355
好的。
All right.

138
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,112
-你要走了？  -是啊，都快 1 点了。
-You gotta go? -Yeah, it's almost 1:00.

139
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,495
-你确定没事？  -嗯，一切都好。
-Sure you're OK? -Yeah. All good.

140
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,417
好的。
All right.

141

-待会打给你？ -你有我号码。
-Call you later? -You got my number.

143
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,522
巨人队正对阵海盗队。
And the Giants are facing the Buccos.

144
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,565
但他们落后三场且只剩七场比赛可打。
But they're three games back with only seven to play.

145
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,818
巨人队完了！拿叉子来！我的叉子在哪？
The Giants are cooked! Get a fork! Where is my fork?

146
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:59,034
你要叉子？我给你把叉子，你这混... 嘿，老兄。这不是给你的。
You want a fork? I got a fork for you, you f... Hey, Bud. It's not for you.

147
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:00,702
那是人类的食物。
That's human food.

148
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:02,913
行吗？
All right?

149
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:03,997
什么？
What?

150
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,209
哦，你饿了。
Oh, you're hungry.

151
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,878
好的，没问题。我去给你弄点吃的。
Yeah, all right. I'll go get you some food.

152
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,643
喂！你是谁？
Hey! Who are you?

153
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:26,979
拉斯在家吗？
Is Russ home?

Who are you?

这可不太妙。
That's not good.

你看到辛迪因为丹维尔那事气炸了吗？
You clock Cindy with that burnout from Danville?

But for real, though.

180
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,508
看到看台上那个道奇队的球探了吗？
You see that Dodgers scout in the stands?

181
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,136
你干嘛老针对我？今天怎么回事？
Why are you riding me? What is this today?

-I won't go that high. -But what if...?

184
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,102
不，我才不会被道奇队选中呢。
No, I'm not getting drafted by the Dodgers.

185

第 15 顺位。那就是我。
15th pick. That's me.

你已经昏迷了两天。

00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,666
-天啊。
-发生什么了？
-Oh, shit. -What happened?

208
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,919
噢，我妈呀。
Oh, my mom.

209
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,879
有电话吗？你带手机了吗？
Is there a phone? Do you have your phone?

00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,507
-有。有。-我能...？

211
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,053
两天没接到电话了。
Two days without a call.

212
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,683
嘿，妈妈，是我。
Hey, Mom, it's me.

不，我没事。抱歉，我只是...之前生病了。
Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just... I was sick.

214
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,483
嗯，就是食物中毒。
Yeah, it was just food poisoning.

215
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:03,362
不过别担心，我现在好多了。有个朋友陪着我。
But, hey, I'm OK. I got a friend with me.

216
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:04,655
不是那种关系，就是普通朋友。
No, just a friend.

217
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,949
嘿。我前几天真是昏昏沉沉的。
Hey. I was really out of it the last couple days.

218
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,450
那个...后来怎么样了？
What happened with the...?

219
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,161
真的吗？
Really?

220
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,749
哦，哇，太好了...哎哟。
Oh, wow, that's great... Ow.

221
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:21,129
呃...嘿，我现在有点迷糊，所以...呃...我们能...？
Um... Hey, I'm really out of it, so... Um... Can we...?

222
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:25,217
好的，嗯。我爱你。巨人队加油。
All right, yeah. I love you. Go Giants.

223
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,223
巨人队只落后一场比赛了。
Giants are only one game back.

224
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,560
你的优先事项真让我着迷。
Your priorities fascinate me.

225
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,437
-我让你着迷。-我可没这么说。
-I fascinate you. -Not what I said.

226
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,109
啊，你在我床边呢。
Aw, here you are at my bedside.

227
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,944
-我刚到。-嗯哼。
-I just got here. -Uh-huh.

228
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,363
嗯哼。哦，刚才有个警察来过了。
Mm-hm. Oh, a cop came by.

229
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,447
我不知道该跟她说什么。
I didn't know what to tell her.

230
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:48,824
她留下了名片。
She left her card.

231
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,702
到底发生什么了？
What the hell happened?

232
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,622
几个家伙来找拉斯，不知为何对我发火。
Some guys, they came looking for Russ, and they got pissed at me for some reason.

233
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,416
拉斯。果然是他。
Russ. Of course.

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,543
我得离开这儿。
I have to get out of here.

235
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,879
你刚做完手术。
You just had surgery.

236
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:05,257
不行，我付不起这个。得趁账单还没滚得更大之前离开。
No, I can't afford this. I gotta get out before I rack up a bigger bill.

237
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,301
——好吧，行。
--Yeah, OK.

238
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,136
可以。但有规矩要遵守。
Fine. But there are rules.

239
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,848
-“低钠”。-我不喜欢盐。
-"Low sodium". -I don't like salt.

240
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,309
-“禁止吸烟”。-吸烟很恶心。
-"No smoking". -Smoking is gross.

241
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,270
-“不含咖啡因”。-咖啡因让我紧张不安。
-"No caffeine". -Caffeine makes me jittery.

242
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:23,400
还有，呃...“禁止饮酒”。
And, um... "No alcohol".

243
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,486
永远。
Forever.

244
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,072
好的。
OK.

245
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,285
说真的，汉克。肾脏是用来处理毒素的。
Seriously, Hank. Kidneys process toxins.

246
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,787
酒精就是毒素，明白吗？
Alcohol is a toxin, do you understand?

247
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,372
是啊。
Yeah.

248
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,292
什么？我喝得又不多。
What? I don't drink that much.

249
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,129
好的。
OK.

250
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,798
给你，兄弟。
Here you go, Bud.

251
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,635
话说你好几天没联系我了，没事吧？
Anyway, you haven't called me for days. Are you OK?

252
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,887
给我打电话。爱你。巨人队加油。
Call me. Love you. Go Giants.

253
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,017
悠着点，硬汉。
You have to take it easy, tough guy.

254
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,773
我喜欢有备无患，以防需要招待客人。
I like to be prepared in case I have to entertain.

255
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,489
我不喜欢蠢男人，汉克。
I don't like stupid guys, Hank.

256
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:15,285
如果你想要找个银行家之类的，杜安就在走廊那头。
Well, if you want a banker or something, Duane's right down the hall.

257
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,996
这一点都不好笑。他又不是银行家。
That's not funny. He's not a banker.

258
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,665
他搭建网站。
He builds websites.

259
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,969
-你怎么回事？ -什么？你什么意思？
-What is it with you? -What? What do you mean?

260
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,346
每次遇到正经事就故意装傻。
Purposely acting stupid whenever shit gets real.

261
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:36,974
我才没有。
I don't do that.

262
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,018
好的。我来处理。
OK. I do that.

263
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,312
但我真的不知道你想要什么。
But I really don't know what you want.

264
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,898
我想知道这事能不能当真。
I wanna know if I can take this seriously.

265
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,235
你...？你想认真对待？
You...? You wanna get serious?

266
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,488
我们就在那个地方。
We're at that place.

267
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,618
要么继续深入，要么... ...就此退出。
Either we go deeper or... ...we get out.

268
00:17:56,702 --> 00:18:02,791
好吧。那么... 怎样才能让你认真对待我们？
OK. So... What do you need to take us seriously?

269
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,004
我只需要确认你是个能搞定自己烂摊子的人。
I just need to know that you're a guy that can take care of his shit.

270
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,717
我不想和一个逃避自己生活的人在一起。
I don't wanna be with someone who's running away from his life.

271
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:15,804
你越是逃避恐惧的东西，就越会被它控制。
You run away from what you're afraid of, then it owns you.

272
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,114
-待会打给你？ -你有我号码。
-Call you later? -You got my number.

273
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:37,492
你拿了我的帽子。
You got my hat.

274
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,722
怎么？你以为我不敢动手？
What? You don't think I'll do it?

275
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:01,767
去你的。
Fuck you.

276
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,033
--你有毛病啊？走开。
--What's your problem? Shoo.

277
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,703
别在床上。嘿，下来。
Not on the bed. Hey, get down.

278
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,498
哥们，别这样！
Bud, come on!

279
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,416
老兄。
Dude.

280
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,462
我有喜欢狗的理由。
There are reasons I like dogs.

281
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,803
喂，杰森！垃圾还没收走吗？
Yo, Jason! Still no trash pickup?

282
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,513
对我来说没问题！
Works out OK for me!

283
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,640
嘿，你那里面有罐子吗？
Hey, you got any cans in there?

284
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,058
哦，不，老兄。只有瓶子。
Oh, no, man. Just bottles.

285
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,102
喝几罐高杯啤酒。帮兄弟个忙。
Drink a couple tallboys. Help a brother out.

286
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,645
我的错。给。
My bad. Here.

287
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,858
嘿，你人不错啊，哈利。
Hey, you're all right, Harry.

288
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,570
...他的保镖阿尔和约瑟夫。
...his bodyguards Al and Joseph.

289
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,536
杰瑞！杰瑞！杰瑞！杰瑞！
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

290
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,789
杰瑞！杰瑞！杰瑞！杰瑞！
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

291
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,212
哦，该死。
Oh, shit.

292
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,757
从这该死的床上滚下去！
Off the fuckin' bed!

293
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:53,647
哦，该死。
Oh, shit.

294
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:55,774
靠。
Shit.

295
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:36,565
嗯哼。你看到几个？
Mm-hm. How many did you see?

296
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:39,067
呃，总共三个吧，我想。
Uh, three altogether, I think.

297
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,611
罗曼警官？
Detective Roman?

298
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,279
介意我用下洗手间吗？
You mind if I use the facilities?

299
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,156
犯罪现场禁止随地大小便。
We're not allowed to crap at a crime scene.

300
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,240
好的。
OK.

301
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:47,326
按住把手不放，否则会堵塞。
Hold the handle down or it clogs.

302
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,036
我知道怎么冲厕所。
I know how to flush a toilet.

303
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:52,915
警察工作最光鲜的时刻。
Police work at its most glamorous.

304
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,877
哎呀。嘿。
Aw. Hey.

305
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,796
看看那个。
Look at that.

306
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,048
嘿，小猫咪。
Hey, kitty.

307
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,342
-它会咬人。我不建议... -嘿。
-He's a biter. I wouldn't... -Hey.

308
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,302
--噢！哦！
--Ooh! Oh!

309
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,930
-这该死的咬人狂。-是啊，抱歉。
-Fuckin' man-eater. -Yeah, I'm sorry.

310
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:12,559
你觉得你看到了三个人。能描述一下其中任何一个吗？
So you think you saw three. Can you describe any of 'em?

311
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:17,648
呃，有前两天打我的那两个乌克兰人，然后...你怎么知道他们是乌克兰人？
Well, there were the two Ukrainians who beat me up the other day, and then... How do you know they're Ukrainian?

312
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,109
他们有口音，而且小乌克兰区就在附近。
They had accents, and Little Ukraine's right around the corner.

313
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,778
不，不对，他们不是乌克兰人。
Yeah, no, they're not Ukrainian.

314
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,948
黑手党多年前就接管了那个街区。
The mafia took over that neighborhood years ago.

315
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:28,825
-他们听起来不像意大利人。-是俄罗斯黑帮。
-They didn't sound Italian. -Russian mafia.

316
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,869
比意大利黑手党更暴力。
More violent than the Italians.

317
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:33,247
-食物更难吃。-好吧，真棒。
-Worse food. -Well, great.

318
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,124
你是粉丝吗？还是玩过？
Hey, you a fan? Or you played?

319
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,501
玩过。
I played.

320
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,962
嗯。大学？半职业？
Hm. College? Semi-pro?

321
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,214
呃，高中。
Uh, high school.

322
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,008
哦，还以为你打过真正的篮球呢。
Oh. Thought maybe you played real ball.

323
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:46,885
我打过真正的篮球。
I played real ball.

324
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:49,054
嗯哼。
Uh-huh.

325
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,433
你对迈纳先生的犯罪活动了解多少？
What do you know about Mr. Miner's criminal activities?

326
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:57,479
一无所知。拉斯？他不是罪犯。
Nothing. Russ? He's not a criminal.

327
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:59,731
汤普森先生，您在这里住了多久？
How long you been here, Mr. Thompson?

328
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:04,236
哦，在纽约待了 11 年，这个地方住了六七年吧。
Well, 11 years in New York and six, seven in this place.

329
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,363
嗯哼，时间够长，足以目睹所有的变化。
Mm-hm. Long enough to see all the changes.

330
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,782
警力增加了，高档餐厅也多了。
Increased policing. Fancy restaurants.

331
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,909
-高档化。-没错。
-Gentrification. -Yeah.

332
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:16,164
但即便有这么多变化，缉毒队的警探也不会为了一起胡扯的袭击抢劫案出现在这里。
But even with all those changes, you don't get a detective from Narcotics here on a bullshit assault and robbery.

333
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:22,796
-缉毒队？-我来是因为拉斯·迈纳，他在一起正经的毒品调查案中是重要嫌疑人。
-Narcotics? -I'm here 'cause Russ Miner, he's a person of interest in a non-bullshit narcotics investigation.

334
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,756
他跟你提过这事吗？
He talk to you about that?

335
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,884
不，他只是说要去伦敦见他父亲。
No. He just said he had to go see his dad in London.

336
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:29,678
你从拉斯那里买毒品？
You buy your drugs from Russ?

337
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:31,471
我不吸毒。
I don't do drugs.

338
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:34,183
-几乎不吸。-你和他一起贩毒？
-Hardly ever. -You deal drugs with him?

339
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,559
不，女士。
No, ma'am.

340
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:41,440
你上次和这些人说话是什么时候？
When was the last time you talked to these guys?

341
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:43,442
不知道。
I don't know.

342
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,445
我不认识那些人。
I don't know those guys.

343
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:51,033
就这几个家伙？他们可是可怕的怪物。
These guys right here? They're scary monsters.

344
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:55,829
不管你和他们有什么勾当，最好在他们决定剜掉你眼睛之前告诉我。
Whatever you're doing with them, you should tell me about it before they decide you'd look better with your eyes cut out.

345
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:57,873
我和他们毫无瓜葛。
I'm not doing anything with them.

346
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,959
听懂了吗？我...我...
OK? I... I...

347
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,384
你他妈在耍我？
Are you messing with me?

348
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:14,056
--我就是在耍你。
--I'm kinda fucking with you.

349
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:16,016
永远猜不到会出什么岔子。
Never know what'll pop loose.

350
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,268
我按住了，但它还是堵了。
I held it down but it clogged anyway.

351
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:23,273
-我在走廊那头完工了。-你非要把这位市民的管道搞砸了才告诉我？
-I'm done across the hall. -You couldn't tell me that before you ruined this citizen's plumbing?

352
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:26,235
-我得走了。-赶紧给我滚。
-I had to go. -Get the fuck outta here.

353
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,447
好吧，我直接问你个问题。
All right, I'mma ask you a direct question.

354
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,950
-行。-你他妈在耍我吗？
-OK. -Are you fucking with me?

355
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:36,245
没有。我什么都不知道。我没什么可耍的。
No. I don't know anything. I've got nothing to fuck with.

356
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,206
什么？
What?

357
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,334
什么？
What?

358
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:46,046
我又在耍你了。
I'm fucking with you again.

359
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,507
永远猜不到会冒出什么幺蛾子。
Never know what'll pop loose.

360
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:52,177
但经验告诉我你有所隐瞒。
But experience tells me you're not telling me something.

361
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:55,514
你觉得那是无关紧要的事。
You think it's something that doesn't matter.

362
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,558
但也许会的。所以再来一次：
But it might. So one more time:

363
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:00,060
你有什么想告诉我的吗？
Is there anything you wanna tell me?

364
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:06,900
呃...我真的好害怕。
Uh... I'm really scared.

365
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:12,364
-他们不在乎你。-他们把我送进了医院。
-They don't care about you. -They put me in the hospital.

366
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,366
那只是...附带伤害。
That's...collateral damage.

367
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,909
你没什么好担心的。
You have nothing to worry about.

368
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:18,495
除非那些可怕的怪物出现。
Unless the scary monsters come around.

369
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,289
你看到它们的话，就叫我。
You see them, you call me.

370
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:23,083
-还好吗？ -还好。
-All right? -All right.

371
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:25,878
今天你的小伙子们表现如何？
How'd your boys do today?

372
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:30,174
他们打败了海盗队，所以还落后一场。
They beat the Pirates, so one game back.

373
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,885
我押大都会队赢。
My money's on the Mets.

374
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,804
汤普森先生，您好。
Good day, Mr. Thompson.

375
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,514
好了，各位，我们走吧。
OK, fellas, let’s go.

376
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,612
哦，该死。
Oh, fuck.

377
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,849
搞什么鬼，巴德？
What the fuck, Bud?

378
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:22,559
你吃了什么？
What did you eat?

379
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:00,639
有什么区别呢？
What's the difference?

380
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,266
她说这些杏仁味道更苦一些。
She said they're a little more bitter.

381
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,351
- 那你猜我会怎么说？- 怎么说？
-Well, you know what I say. -What?

382
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,313
- 如果它嘎嘎叫...- 没错。
- If it quacks... - Exactly.

383
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:10,858
这正是我想说的。它就是颗杏仁。
That was my point. It's an almond.

384
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:13,318
罗斯？
Russ?

385
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,195
有人吗？
Hello?

386
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,923
你在干嘛？我车停路边挡道了。
What are you doing? I'm double-parked.

387
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:45,976
罗曼警探，纽约警局的。
Detective Roman, NYPD.

388
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:48,187
留言必回。
Leave a message, call you back.

389
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,730
我是汉克·汤普森。
It's Hank Thompson.

390
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,858
那个...那些可怕的怪物刚才就在这里。
The, uh... The scary monsters were just here.

391
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:59,781
我觉得我可能发现了重要线索，快给我打电话或者...不行，这里不安全。
And I think I may have found something important, so just call me or... No. I don't think it's safe here.

392
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:00,782
我稍后给你回电话。
I'll call you back.

393
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:06,997
嘿，好久不见。
Hey. Long time no see.

You got the license of that truck that hit you?

395
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,044
- 去你的，老兄。 - 嘿，老兄，你没事吧？
-Screw you, man. -Hey, man, you OK?

396
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,755

-Here, have a drink, champ. -No, I can't. I need a favor.

399
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,972
-操，别提什么帮忙！见鬼。 -不行，我真的不能喝，兄弟。
-Oh, fuck favors! Fuck. -No, I can't drink, man.

400
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:25,641
好吧好吧，那就算了。行。
All right, all right, then. OK.

401
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:29,186
那就为巨人队干杯吧。好吗？
Then here's a toast to the Giants. OK?

402
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:32,523
巨人！巨人！巨人！
Giants! Giants! Giants!

403
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,316
别诋毁你最喜欢的球队啊，伙计。
Don't diss your favorite team, man.

404
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,944
你还等什么？一口气干了。
What are you waiting for? Chugalug.

405
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:38,904
-好吧，就一个！ -巨人！巨人！
-All right, just one! -Giants! Giants!

00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:40,614
-认真的吗。 -巨人！
-Seriously. -Giants!

胜负难分！他安全上垒！
It's gonna be close! He is safe!

425
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,661
-观众瞬间沸腾！-快他妈让开！
-And the crowd goes wild! -Out of the fucking way!

426
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,913
本垒在这边，大明星。
Home base is this way, superstar.

427
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,667
超级巨星。
Superstar.

428
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:37,921
来吧，宝贝，别在街上待着。
Come on, baby. Get out of the street.

429
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:39,840
我们送你回家吧。
Let's get you home.

430
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:44,303
什么？
What?

431
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,389
你觉得这很好笑吗？
You think that's funny.

432
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:52,144
你想让我直面恐惧，却觉得这很好笑。
You want me to face my fears, but you think that's funny.

433
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:53,228
什么？
What?

434
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,064
你到底想说什么？
What is it you're trying to say?

435
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:59,359
我曾拥有那么多。
I had so much.

436
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:04,239
明明就在这里。然后...好吧。
It was right here. And then... OK.

437
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,201
那你告诉我，我该怎么面对这一切？
So you tell me, how do I face that?

438
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,624
你明白吗？曾经拥有一切如今只剩垃圾——这让我如何自处？
You know, how do I face when I had so much and now all I have is garbage?

439
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:17,878
-垃圾？说得好。-不，亲爱的。
-Garbage? Nice. -No. Baby.

440
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:19,296
-出租车！-我不是说你。
-Taxi! -I didn't mean you.

441
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,089
今晚我不用再看孩子了。
Yeah, I'm done babysitting tonight.

442
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:22,341
别这样嘛，宝贝。
Come on, baby.

443
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,178
嗨。唐人街？
Hi. Chinatown?

444
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,394
哈利，我的孩子。

454
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:42,523
我摸了摸那只臭猫。
I pet the shitty cat.

00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:47,861
然后它咬了我。所以... ...我就踢了那只臭猫。
And it bit me. So... ... I kicked the shitty cat.

456

不，不，不，不，不，不，不。我们是来跟那家伙谈话的。
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We here to talk to the guy.

听着，汉克...
Mira, Hank...

460
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:16,723
让我来解释一下情况。
Let me explain what's happening.

461
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:25,148
这些家伙，他们想打到你开口为止。
These guys, they wanna hit you until you tell them things.

462
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:30,987
但我相信肯定有更好的方式能达成理解。
But I believe that there has to be a better way to come to an understanding.

463
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,036
La pistola.（西班牙语：手枪）
La pistola.

464
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:44,251
有些人挥舞着枪，就像在炫耀他们那玩意儿似的。
Some guys wave a gun around like it's their... ...dick.

465
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:47,795
但我可不需要挥舞什么东西来示威。
But I don't need to wave anything around.

466
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:54,344
要么得到我想要的，要么就让我的枪替我说话。
Either I get what I want or my pistol talk for me.

467
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:55,888
明白吗？
You understand?

468
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:58,223
拉斯去伦敦见他老爸了。
Russ went to see his dad in London.

469

完美。
Perfecto.

470
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:04,688
但他先给了你什么东西，对吧？
But first he gave you something, right?

471
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:06,106
是啊。
Yeah.

472
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:13,906
哦，对。有一把钥匙。不过不是他直接给我的，而是藏在...猫砂盆里。
Oh, yeah. There was a key. Well, he didn't give it to me, but he hid it in the... the litter box.

473
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:17,242
-在卫生间。-全程没挨打。
-It's in the bathroom. -All with no hitting.

474
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:19,411
全垒打，棒球先生。
Home run, Mr. Baseball.

475
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:21,622
它藏在一坨假橡胶便便里。
It was in a fake rubber poo.

476
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:24,541
嗯...我就是在那儿找到的。
Um... That's where I found it.

477
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:31,131
听着，我当时醉得厉害，完全不记得发生了什么。但我洗了床单，然后杰森...假便便。
Look, I got so wasted I don't remember what happened, but I washed the sheets and then Jason... Fake poo.

478
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:35,427
真是搞笑。但没有钥匙。
So funny. But no key.

479
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,810
他不懂什么叫善意。
He doesn't understand nice.

480
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,648
嗯。
Hm.

481
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:50,025
-看我找到了什么。-该你出手了。
-Look what I found. -Do your thing.

482
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,443
-停下。快停下。-该你了。
-Stop. Just stop. -Your turn.

00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:55,030
停下。求你快停下。让我想一下。

嘿，老兄，你他妈能滚远点吗？
Hey, dude, how about you fuck off?

那个雅皮士会报警的。快走。
The yuppie will call the police. Come on.

507

OK, all right. Chill!

我没法照顾他了。
I couldn't take care of him.

-聪明。 -咱俩得少混一起了。

All right, let's check this out.

525
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:43,490
还行，不算太糟。
All right, not too bad.

526
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:45,993
只是掉了几个订书钉，应该没问题。
Just lost a few staples. Should be OK.

527
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:49,705
-你在干什么？-我在叫辆巴士。
-What are you doing? -I'm calling a bus.

528
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,290
不行，你不准联系任何人。
No, you can't call anyone.

529
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:53,041
你得把那个伤口缝合好。
You have to get that closed up.

530
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,626
- 你来弄。
- You do it.

531
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,881
-我不是医生 -我不能去医院 也不能去任何可能招来警察的地方
-I'm not a doctor. -I can't go to the hospital or anything that might involve cops.

532
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:04,720
谁把你弄成这样？到底发生了什么？
Who did this to you? What's going on?

533
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,054
缝上就行 我没事的
Stitch it up. I'll be OK.

534
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:10,642
我这里没有缝合线 我没有...我做不到
I don't have sutures here. I don't have... I can't.

535
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:16,481
好了好了，我有主意了。
All right, all right. I have something.

536
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:18,192
不过会留下难看的疤痕。
It's gonna leave a nasty scar, though.

537
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:26,742
别动。必须固定住。
Stop moving. It has to set.

538
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,369
别动。
Stay still.

539
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:34,208
好了。就像前线处理的那样。
OK. Just like they do it on the front lines.

540
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,002
谢谢。
Thank you.

541
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,302
-我能...？ -哦，不行。
-Can I...? -Oh, no.

542
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,054
你至少得让它保持那样几天。
You gotta leave that in for at least a couple days.

543
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:48,972
太有意思了。
Very funny.

544
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:54,436
搞什么鬼，汉克？
What the fuck, Hank?

545
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,064
我记不清昨晚发生什么了。
I can't remember what happened last night.

546
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:58,815
真让人震惊。
Shocker.

547
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:08,742
保罗说你来找他帮忙，然后开始喝酒，成了派对上的焦点，后来又对棒球满腹牢骚，所以...老样子了。
Paul said you came in asking for a favor, started drinking, were the life of the party, got old and bitter about baseball, so... The usual.

548
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:11,995
-我得走了。-什么？
-I have to go. -What?

549
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:15,290
你还没告诉我到底他妈的发生了什么事。
You still haven't told me what the fuck is going on.

550
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:16,959
事情变得不对劲。
Something fucked up is happening.

551
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:19,795
-我们报警吧。-不行，亲爱的。他们说不能叫警察。
-Let's call the cops. -No, baby. They said no cops.

552
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,213
行吗？
All right?

553
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:24,299
-我能搞定。-不！你不行。
-I can handle it. -No! You can't.

554
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:26,844
-这些人伤害猫咪。-你帮我看着他。
-These people hurt cats. -You watch him for me.

555
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:32,099
好的，我来照顾巴德。
Yeah, I'll take care of Bud.

556
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,059
-你要照顾好自己。-好的。
-You take care of yourself. -All right.

557
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:35,769
我晚点打给你？
I'll call you later?

558
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:12,014
保罗酒吧。保罗不在这儿。你老婆也不在。
Paul's Bar. Paul's not here. And neither is your wife.

559
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:13,765
--嘿，我是汉克。
--Hey, it's Hank.

560
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:15,893
昨晚我给你的那把钥匙？我需要拿回来。
The key I gave you last night? I need to get it.

561
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:18,145
你能打电话给我吗，呃...？
Can you call me at, uh...?

562
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,110
-汉克！-哦，该死！
-Hank! -Oh, shit!

563
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:30,949
小心！
Look out!

564
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:35,746

You fucking idiot!

565
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,831
给我注意点！你他妈的在干什么？
Pay attention! What the fuck are you doing?

566
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,181
对不起！
Sorry!

567
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,156
汉克。你跑什么？
Hank. Why you running?

568
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,491
-为什么跑？-冷静点。放轻松。
-For what? -Relax. Just relax.

569
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:13,784
不，不要，不行！
No, no, no!

570
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:20,249
汉克！
Hank!

571
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,377
快走！快走！
Move! Move!

572
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:48,861
哦，该死。
Ooh, fuck.

573
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:01,957
保罗酒吧。保罗不在。而且...也不在。
Paul's Bar. Paul's not here. And neither is...

574
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:23,228
再来杯啤酒？
Another beer?

575
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:27,733
当然记得。
Yeah, sure.

576
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,450
-喂？-我是汉克·汤普森。
-¿Hola? -It's Hank Thompson.

577
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,744
汉克。你想起什么了吗？
Hank. Did you remember something?

578
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:39,953
我知道钥匙在哪儿。
I know where the key is.

579
00:43:40,037 --> 00:43:41,872
很好。它在哪儿？
Good. Where is it?

580
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:43,248
别让我猜来猜去。
Don't make me guess.

581
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:44,583
我现在就去拿。
I'm gonna go get it now.

582
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,210
我陪你一起去。
I'll go with you. To keep you company.

583
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:48,337
不，是和朋友约好的。不能带你去。
No, it's with a friend. I'm not taking you there.

584
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:49,671
哪个朋友？
Which friend?

585
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:53,175
啊，唐人街那个姑娘。
Ah, the chica in Chinatown.

586
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:55,260
- 什么？- 什么？
- What? - What?

587
00:43:55,344 --> 00:44:00,349
什么？汉克，我告诉过你我们会怎么对付你在乎的人。
What? I told you what we'd do to the people you care about, Hank.

588
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:30,254
哦，不。
Oh, no.

589
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:37,928
天啊！天啊！
Oh, God! Oh, God!

590
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:44,893
911。请问您的紧急情况是什么？
911. What is your emergency?

591
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:47,855
喂？你能听到我说话吗？
Hello? Can you hear me?

592
00:44:55,779 --> 00:45:00,492
你没回电话，我就好奇查了你，汉克。
When you didn't call back, I got curious, so then I looked you up, Hank.

593
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:04,329
我还在吹嘘自己打过正经比赛，结果你才是真正的天才球员。
There I was shining you about playing real ball, and you were an actual phenom.

594
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:08,083
老爷子肯定把你调教得特别棒。
Old man must have coached you real good.

595
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,585
十八岁。
Eighteen.

596
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,088
注定成为大联盟选秀的热门人选。
Set to be a top pick in the Major League draft.

597
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:15,299
然后你却搞砸了。
Then you messed it up.

598
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:17,843
你老爸一定很失望吧。
Your dad must have been pretty disappointed.

599
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:27,352
棒球生涯就此终结。
So much for baseball.

600
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:32,149
你本应从中吸取教训，但……看看我们现在。
You think you'd learn from that, but... ...here we are.

601
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:39,823
那是个近距离枪伤。
That...is a contact wound.

602
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:41,742
枪当时是这样抵着的。
The gun was like this.

603
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:48,832
有人闯入她的公寓埋伏，等她回来后就处决了她。
Somebody gained entry into her apartment, waited for her, then executed her.

604
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:54,087
不管你在搞什么勾当害死了这姑娘，我的职责就是确保不再有人遇害。
Whatever you're into got this girl killed, and it's my job to make sure nobody else gets murdered.

605
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,840
我需要一些信息。
I'mma need some information.

606
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,217
所以要么你告诉我...
So either you tell me...

607
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:04,181
明白了吗？
You got that?

608
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:15,108
听着，呃，别再盯着那些看了。
Look, uh, no more looking at those.

609
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,988
我们，呃...我们带你离开这儿。
Let's, uh... Let's get you outta here.

610
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:22,574
来吧。我们去喝杯咖啡。
Come on. Let's get a coffee.

611
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:24,326
行吗？
All right?

612
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:34,294
什么？
What?

613
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:43,262
你打算告诉我怎么回事吗？
You gonna tell me what's going on?

614
00:46:46,598 --> 00:46:49,852
我需要你证明自己具备说话的能力。
I'd like evidence you possess the power of speech.

615
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:54,022
那是我妈妈。
It was my mom.

616
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:56,316
你妈妈怎么了？
Your mom what?

617
00:46:56,942 --> 00:46:57,943
棒球。
Baseball.

618
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:00,070
妈妈是我的教练。
Mom was my coach.

619
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:03,699
说得好，妈妈。
Right on, Mom.

620
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:07,077
所以这些你招惹上的俄国人，帕维尔和阿列克谢？
So these Russians you're messed up with, Pavel and Aleksei?

621
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:12,666
他们实际上是替布莱顿海滩一个极恶之徒伊戈尔·多洛霍夫在本地的分支打掩护。
They front a local franchise for a truly evil fucker out in Brighton Beach, Igor Dolokhov.

622
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:15,127
还有那个红头发的，波多黎各人科罗拉多？
And the redhead, the Puerto Rican, Colorado?

623
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:17,504
他在他们的地盘上经营着几家夜店。
He runs a couple nightclubs over on their turf.

624
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:19,381
他就是杀害伊冯娜的凶手。
He's the one who killed Yvonne.

625
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:22,301
哼。他给你来了那套"手枪演说"？
Hm. He gave you that whole pistola speech?

626
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:23,927
没错。一字不差。
Yes. Exactly.

627
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:29,016
全是装腔作势。这混蛋嘴上厉害，真让他扣扳机就怂了。
It's all a front. Asshole talks big, but he ain't got the balls to pull the trigger.

628
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:33,854
处决式谋杀，那是德鲁克兄弟的惯用手法。
Now, execution-murder, that's the Drucker brothers' style.

629
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:35,397
利帕和舒穆利。哈西德派那帮人。
Lipa and Shmully. The Hasids.

630
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:39,610
等等，但是...她跟他们毫无瓜葛啊。
Wait, but... She had nothing to do with them.

631
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:42,613
哼，他们跟着俄国人找到你，又通过你盯上了她。
Well, they followed the Russians to you and you to her.

632
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:45,115
你逃跑了，还惹毛了他们。
And you ran, and you pissed them off.

633
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:47,993
别他妈招惹我们。
Don't fuck with us.

634
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:53,749
听着，这一团糟全是为了钱。
Look, this whole clusterfuck is all about money.

635
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:56,627
一笔数额惊人的现金。
An exotically huge amount of cash.

636
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:59,421
那把钥匙能打开它藏匿的任何地方。
And that key opens wherever it's hidden.

637
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:01,673
是拉斯偷的。不是你。
And Russ stole it. Not you.

638
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:06,386
汉克... ...这不是你的错。
Hank... ...it's not your fault.

639
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:10,933
我本该给你打电话的。
I should have called you.

640
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:14,311
她是对的。我为什么没听她的话？
She was right. Why didn't I listen to her?

641
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:17,523
我真是个混...
I'm such a fu...

642
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,114
钥匙在我工作的那家酒吧。
The key is at the bar where I work.

643
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:31,411
我交给老板保管，后来喝醉酒就忘了。
I gave it to my boss to hide it, and then I got drunk and I forgot.

644
00:48:32,955 --> 00:48:33,956
好的？
OK?

645
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:37,000
好的。
OK.

646
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:39,586
给你。
Here you go.

647
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:41,880
好的。
OK.

648
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,885
这就是...这就是我来这儿的目的。
This... This is what I came here for.

649
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:50,180
嗯。
Mm.

650
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:54,142
-那我们现在怎么办？-等增援。
-So, what do we do now? -We wait for backup.

651
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:57,479
你喝过黑白配吗？
You ever had a black-and-white?

652
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,232
来吧，尝尝看。
Come on. Try it.

653
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:02,442
你错过了太多。
You're missing out.

654
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:10,868
嗯。那时候我还是个孩子，黑白电视的时代，这是这儿唯一值得一看的东西。
Mm. I was a kid, black-and-white, it was the only thing worth a shit down here.

655
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,203
我说的是真正的字母城。
I'm talking real Alphabet City.

656
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:16,790
可不是那种高档化矫情小餐馆的破玩意。
None of that gentrified chichi bistro bullshit.

657
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:20,502
我在 Avenue D 附近的里斯公屋区长大，就在那边。
I grew up in the projects right over there in Riis Houses off Avenue D.

658
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:23,922
在这里长大，也在这里工作。
Grew up down here, work down here.

659
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:26,884
但绝不会死在这个鬼地方。哼。
Ain't gonna fucking die down here. Mm-mm.

660
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:29,970
等这一切结束，我要去图卢姆。
When all of this is over, I'm going to Tulum.

661
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:40,731
沙滩泳池酒吧，可以游过去畅饮...我要坐在那儿，听涛声阵阵，畅想新生活。
Beaches, pool bar that you swim up to... I'mma sit there, listen to the waves, think about my new life.

662
00:49:42,065 --> 00:49:44,943
唯一舍不得的就是这块曲奇了。
Only thing I'mma miss is this cookie.

663
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:49,740
嗯！
Mm!

664
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,200
后援已到。
Backup has arrived.

665
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,165
汉克，你这是要去哪儿？
Where you going, Hank?

666
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:03,629
这帽子不错。
Nice hat.

667
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:06,256
好了，我们开始吧。
All right, here we go.

668
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:16,517
好吧。所以呢？
OK. So?

669
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,268
里面情况怎么样？
How's it look in there?

670
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:21,396
店主和一个胖子正在吧台边吸可卡因。
The owner and some fat guy are doing coke at the bar.

671
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:25,776
那个胖家伙还要跟你老板混多久？
How much longer will the gordo ese hang out with your boss?

672
00:50:31,073 --> 00:50:32,866
他有什么毛病？
What's his problem?

673
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,159
他以为你杀了他女人。
He thinks you killed his girl.

674
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:37,538
我告诉他你根本没胆子扣扳机。
I told him you don't have the balls to pull the trigger.

675
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:39,248
哈哈哈。
Ha-ha-ha.

676
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:43,877
-我们进去吧。-不，没必要进去。
-Let's go in. -No. We don't have to go in.

677
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:46,296
他会给我们送来的。
He's gonna bring it to us.

678
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:49,341
嗯。好吧。很好。
Hm. OK. Good.

679
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,678
你进去拿钥匙。
You go in and get the key.

680
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:57,266
-操你妈的混蛋！-嘿！少给我来这套！
-Fuck you, you motherfucker! -Hey! Knock that shit off!

681
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:02,479
汉克，你好像没抓住重点。
Hank, you seem to be missing the essence of the situation.

682
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:05,691
谁杀了你女人并不重要。
It doesn't matter who killed your girl.

683
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:09,695
重要的是你得采取行动，避免更多人送命。
What matters is that you do what you need to do so that nobody else gets killed.

684
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:14,700
你接下来要做的就是走进酒吧，拿到钥匙，然后带回来给我们。
So, what you're gonna do is go into the bar, you're gonna get the key, and bring it to us.

685
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:18,412
然后就结束了。噩梦到此为止。
And then that's it. It's over. Nightmare ends.

686
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,915
你只有一分钟时间，汉克。
You got one minute, Hank.

687
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:28,422
-不然我们就进去了。-好吧。
-Or we're comin' in. -All right.

688
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:32,634
不行，猫必须留在这里。
Nuh-uh. The cat stays here.

689
00:51:35,012 --> 00:51:36,138
没事的，伙计。
It's OK, Bud.

690
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:42,352
然后她转向我，问我是否爱她。
And then she turns to me and asks me if I love her.

691
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:45,814
这是一个女士问她绅士朋友的合理问题。
That's a legit question for a lady to ask her gentleman friend.

692
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:49,026
怎么，你是在帮我还是耍我？
What, are you helping me or are you fucking with me?

693
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:52,070
听着，谈情说爱谁更在行，你还是我？
Listen, who the fuck knows more about romance, you or me?

694
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:53,197
-把这个给我 -什么？
-Give me this. -What?

695
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,032
-当然是我啊混蛋 -真的吗？
-Me, motherfucker. -Really?

696
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:57,784
是啊。我对自己的女性气质非常自信。
Yeah. I'm very in tune with my femininity.

697
00:51:58,744 --> 00:51:59,828
- 这还用说！
- No shit!

698
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:01,038
让我进去！
Let me in!

699
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,832
麻烦来了。
Here comes trouble.

700
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:06,960
-哦哦，别给他可乐。-酒也不行。
-Uh-uh. No coke for him. -No booze either.

701
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:11,256
嘿，早上好啊，我的好朋友。
Hey, top o' the mornin' to you, my fine friend.

702
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,549
老兄，我需要我的钥匙。
I need my key, man.

703
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:14,635
什么钥匙？你在卖货吗？
A key of what? Are you selling weight?

704
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:17,262
-我的钥匙。现在就要。-你丢在哪了？
-My key. Right now. -Where did you lose it?

705
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:18,889
也许在失物招领抽屉里。
Maybe it's in the lost and found drawer.

706
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:20,599
我昨晚带给你的那把钥匙。
The key that I brought you last night.

707
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:24,353
在你搞坏台球桌呢绒之前还是之后？
Before or after you fucked up the felt on the pool table?

708
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:26,396
我给你的钥匙在哪儿？
Where is the key that I gave you?

709
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,648
你什么都没给我！
You didn't give me anything!

710
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:29,858
你只给我添了一堆麻烦。
All you gave me is a pain in the ass.

711
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:32,361
-什么？ -嘿，早上好啊。
-What? -Hey, good morning.

712
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:34,571
-再给我一分钟就好。 -安静点。
-I just need one more minute. -Quiet.

713
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:37,699
-嘿，你们在开派对吗？-这是...这是我家。
-Hey, you having a party? -It's... It's my place.

714
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:39,368
我们没伤害任何人。
We're not harming anybody.

715
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:40,911
我不必忍受眼前的一切。
I don't have to see everything I see.

716
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:44,915
-汉克，怎么回事？-汤普森先生正在协助调查。
-Hank, what's going on? -Mr. Thompson is helping with an investigation.

717
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:49,753
-昨晚他给了你钥匙？-听着，我觉得...告诉我们钥匙在哪儿，否则我们就搜你家。
-He gave you a key last night? -Listen, I think... Tell us where that key is, or we could search your place.

718
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:51,296
你有搜查令吗？操！
You got a fucking warrant?

719
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,714
这不关你的事，死胖子。
Not your problem, gordo cabrón.

720
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:54,550
别他妈叫我死胖子。
Don't call me fucking gordo cabrón.

721
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:56,301
告诉你的老板，你想要拿回属于你的东西。
Tell your boss you wanna reclaim your property.

722
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:59,805
- 对，对，但是我... -不，不，不。 -嘿，冷静点，阿姆特拉克。
- Yeah. Yeah, but I... -No, no, no. -Hey, cool it, Amtrak.

723
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:02,891
你他妈拿枪对着我？
You flash your fucking gun at me?

724
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:04,601
-嘿，阿姆特拉克！ -这混蛋根本不是警察！
-Hey, Amtrak! -This guy's no fucking cop!

725
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:05,686
-嘿，冷静点！-我认识警察！
-Hey, chill! -I know cops!

726
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:07,688
那根本他妈不是警察！
And that's no fucking cop!

727
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:09,898
靠！
Oh, fuck!

728
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:15,153
-美铁。美铁！-钥匙在哪？
-Amtrak. Amtrak! -Where is the key?

729
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:23,537
-别这样，老兄！-你有五秒钟。一...-你在干嘛？-问出答案。二...-我能搞定。-他他妈在说什么？
-No, come on, man! -You got five seconds. Uno... -What are you doing? -Getting answers. Dos... -I got it handled. -The fuck is he talking about?

730
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,582
-把枪放下。-三...-别数了，听着。-冷静点。
-Put the gun down. -Tres... - Stop counting, listen. - Calm down.

731
00:53:26,665 --> 00:53:28,375
-四...-冷静下来！
-Cuatro... -Calm down!

732
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:30,419
-他妈的把枪放下！-求你了，老兄！求你了，求你了！
-Put the fucking gun down! -Please, man! Please, please!

733
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:31,545
五。
Cinco.

734
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:35,090
哦！天啊！
Oh! God!

735
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,553
真他妈谢谢你啊。
Fucking thank you.

736
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:48,687
这能糊弄得了谁？
That supposed to fool anyone?

737
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,898
就是个装样子的东西，懂了吗？
It's just supposed to look like a thing, all right?

738
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:52,232
混淆事实。
Confuse the issue.

739
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:54,735
哦。这看起来像个东西。
Oh. It looks like a thing.

740
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,071
汉克给了你一把钥匙。
Hank gave you a key.

741
00:53:58,864 --> 00:53:59,990
我想要它。
I want it.

742
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:02,034
-等等，等等。-它在保险箱里。
-Wait, wait. -It's in the safe.

743
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,536
-保罗，我... -嗯。汉克。
-Paul, I... -Yeah. Hank.

744
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,538
钥匙在保险箱里。
The key is in the safe.

745
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:07,831
就放在你告诉我的地方。
It's where you told me to put it.

746
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:13,420
11-15-64。这锁有点挑剔，得轻轻晃动才行。
11-15-64. It's fussy. You gotta jiggle it.

747
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:21,929
-再给我报一遍数字。-11，15，64。
-Give me the numbers again. -11. 15. 64.

748
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:27,142
但我跟你说...你得...对，这确实挺难的，得掌握技巧才行。
But I'm telling... You gotta... Yeah, it's really tricky. You have to know how to do it.

749
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:28,977
-你搞不定的。-噢，见鬼！
-You can't do it. -Oh, fuck!

750
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:30,604
是啊，真他妈烦。
Yeah. Fuck.

751
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:33,982
好的。
OK.

752
00:54:34,525 --> 00:54:36,610
你打开它然后出来。
You open it and then come out.

753
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:40,030
-好了吗？-明白了。
-All right? -Understood.

754
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:47,412
她这里很敏感。
She's very sensitive here.

755
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:51,667
只让我碰她。好了，宝贝。
Only lets me touch her. There you go, baby.

756
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:55,045
嘿，汉克，它来了。
Oh, hey. Hank, it's here.

757
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:58,090
我拿到了。噢，妈的！
I got it. Oh, shit!

758
00:54:58,173 --> 00:54:59,967
-出去。-该死的膝盖。
-Out. -Fuckin' knees.

759
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:02,177
-啊！-枪！
-Aahh! -Gun!

760
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:08,058
混蛋！滚进我的酒吧来！
Motherfucker! Come into my bar!

761
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:10,185
你杀了我最好的兄弟！
You killed my best friend!

762
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:13,605
搞什么鬼，汉克？出什么事了老兄？
What the fuck, Hank? What's happening, man?

763
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:16,775
那些是什么人？他们把阿姆特拉克干掉了！
Who are those guys? They killed Amtrak!

764
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:18,986
他们竟然扫射我的酒吧！干死他们！
They shot up my bar! Fuck 'em!

765
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:22,155
趴下！
Get down!

766
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:28,871
他们朝我的宝贝蜥蜴开枪！
They shot at my fucking lizard!

767
00:55:28,954 --> 00:55:31,540
-快走！-等警察来吧！
-Let's go! -Just wait for the cops!

768
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:32,833
别这样，保罗！保罗！住手！别这样！
No, Paul! Paul! Don't! Don't!

769
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:47,264
把钥匙从投递口扔进来，汉克。
Drop the key through the slot, Hank.

770
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:49,057
我他妈不知道那鬼东西在哪！
I don't know where the fucking thing is!

771
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:51,268
好吧，又不是世界末日。
OK, it's not the end of the world.

772
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:54,605
-先出来我们再... -我不出来。
-Just come out and we can... -I'm not coming out.

773
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:59,610
汉克，你必须出来。现在被抓的话，这些罪名全都会落到你头上。
You gotta come out, Hank. You get arrested now and all of this is gonna land on you.

774
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:01,862
- 我保证会这样。
- I'll make sure of it.

775
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:02,946
我们得走了。
We have to go.

776
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:06,074
汉克，我能帮你摆脱这个烂摊子。
I can get you out of this mess, Hank.

777
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:08,368
但我必须拿到那把钥匙。
But I have to have that key.

778
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:11,038
你被抓就完蛋了。
You get arrested, you're fucked.

779
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:12,391
嘿。嘿，杰森。杰森。
Hey. Hey, Jason. Jason.

780
00:57:12,474 --> 00:57:13,684
我他妈宰了你！
I'll fucking cut you!

781
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:15,310
-退后！ -嘿，嘿，我是汉克。哈里。
-Back up! -Hey, hey, it's Hank. Harry.

782
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,106
-哈里。 -嘿，你拿了我的裤子，老兄。
-Harry. -Hey, you got my pants, man.

783
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:22,067
哦，天哪，我真的很喜欢这条裤子。
Oh, man, I really like these pants.

784
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:24,736
我知道，但我好像有东西落在口袋里了。
I know, but I think I left something in the pocket.

785
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:32,995
抱歉打扰了，伙计，我只是...哦。你说的是这个吗？
I'm sorry to disturb you, buddy, I just... Oh. You mean this?

786
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,831
是的，就是这个。谢了。裤子你留着吧。
Yes, I do. Thank you. You keep the pants.

787
00:57:35,914 --> 00:57:38,375
哎呦，哈利，你可真是个好人。
Aw, man, you're all right, Harry.

788
00:57:57,895 --> 00:58:00,939
你有一条新留言。
You have one new message.

789
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:03,692
亨利！天啊，你相信咱们的孩子们吗？
Henry! Oh my God, can you believe our boys?

790
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:07,154
他们居然在裸奔，大都会队和小熊队都拉胯了。
They're streaking, and the Mets and Cubs are shitting the bed.

791
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:09,698
就算没有超级巨星，他们也办得到。
They're gonna do it, even without their superstar.

792
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:11,241
真希望能有钱飞过去看比赛。
I wish I could afford to fly out.

793
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:12,784
我们可以一起看比赛。
We could watch the game together.

794
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:15,204
嘿，感觉好些了吗？
Hey, you feeling any better?

795
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:16,747
给我打电话。爱你。
Call me. Love you.

796
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,040
巨人队加油！
Go Giants!

797
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:43,941
啊！你这混蛋！
Ah! You fuck!

798
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:46,693
你他妈干嘛打我脑袋，白痴？
Why'd you hit me in the fucking 'ead, you twat?

799
00:58:46,777 --> 00:58:48,153
你到底把我卷进了什么烂摊子？
What the fuck did you get me into?

800
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:50,197
-这他妈是什么鬼东西？ -坚持住！
-What is this shit? -Just hang on!

801
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,198
兄弟们。
Dudes.

802
00:58:57,454 --> 00:58:58,997
他就是个该死的混蛋，对吧，汉克？
He's a fucking cunt, 'ey, Hank?

803
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:00,290
你也是个混蛋。
You're a cunt.

804
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:01,458
你为什么让我摊上这事？
Why did you stick me with this?

805
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:04,711
-干嘛，快给我。快给我！ -这能打开什么？
-What, gimme that. Gimme that! -What does it open?

806
00:59:05,712 --> 00:59:07,923
-钱在哪？ -什么钱？
-Where is the money? -What money?

807
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:10,217
他们杀了伊冯，拉斯。
They killed Yvonne, Russ.

808
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:15,055
伙计...
Mate...

809
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:22,813
咱们去拿我的车吧，好吗？
Let's go get my wheels, yeah?

810
00:59:25,607 --> 00:59:27,568
-你开吧。-不行。
-You drive. -No.

811
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:29,611
-你来开车。-不，我才不开。
-You're driving. -No, I'm not.

812
00:59:29,695 --> 00:59:31,697
兄弟，我他妈视线都模糊了。
Mate, my vision's fucking blurred.

813
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:33,782
-我不开车。-啊。
-I don't drive. -Agh.

814
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:36,034
加州来的每个人都会开车。
Every cunt from California drives.

815
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:38,203
-我不会。-什么叫你不会？
-Not me. -What do you mean, not you?

816
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:39,329
去你的。
Fuck you.

817
00:59:40,664 --> 00:59:41,832
你从没学过吗？
Did you never learn?

818
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:44,418
这就是他们把你赶出好莱坞的原因吗？
Is that why they kicked you out of Hollywood?

819
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:45,752
我又不是好莱坞的人。
I'm not from Hollywood.

820
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:48,172
这他妈是个比喻说法，汉克。
It's a fucking turn of phrase, Hank.

821
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:55,220
什么？是闲人乐队！
What? It's the Idles!

822
00:59:56,555 --> 00:59:57,890
系好安全带。
Buckle your seat belt.

823
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:08,066
东村一家酒吧发生枪战的报道。
Reports of a shoot-out in an East Village bar.

824
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,401
据报道至少三人死亡。
At least three are reported dead.

825
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:13,113
警方正在搜寻该酒吧一名早先从警方拘留中逃脱的员工...
Police are searching for an employee of the bar who fled police custody earlier...

826
01:00:16,867 --> 01:00:19,328
-你搞砸了，伙计。-我搞砸了？
-You fucked up, mate. -I fucked up?

827
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:24,041
去你的，拉斯！伊冯就是这样被处决的。
Fuck you, Russ! Yvonne was executed like this.

828
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:26,126
-嗷！-科罗拉多干掉了阿姆特拉克。
-Ow! -And Colorado killed Amtrak.

829
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:30,255
然后罗曼，她朝科罗拉多头部开了一枪，接着他们杀了保罗。
Then Roman, she shot Colorado in the head and then they killed Paul.

830
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:32,382
不是保罗。
Not Paul.

831
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:34,092
你他妈跟这些人搞什么鬼，哥们？
What the fuck are you doing with these people, man?

832
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:35,594
我会解释的。
I will explain.

833
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,056
但保证别再他妈的敲我脑袋了。
But promise to stop banging me in the fucking head.

834
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:41,725
-是吗？ -没事。
-Yeah? -Fine.

835
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:44,061
听着，老兄，很简单。
Look, mate, it's simple.

836
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:49,441
年轻时我认识了利帕和舒姆利，那两个希伯来人。
In my younger days I made an acquaintance with Lipa and Shmully, the Hebrews.

837
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:53,403
可以说我成了他们象征性的外邦人，就像换了个小挡位。
I became their token gentile, as it were, shifting a little gear.

838
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:54,988
什么装备？
What kind of gear?

839
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:57,407
该死的网球鞋啊，汉克。棒棒糖。
Fucking tennis shoes, Hank. Lollipops.

840
01:00:57,491 --> 01:00:59,451
毒品，伙计。我就是干这个的。
Drugs, mate. That's what I do.

841
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:00,702
我在科罗拉多的俱乐部里出货。
I deal out of Colorado's clubs.

842
01:01:00,786 --> 01:01:02,120
--滚开！
--Fuck off!

843
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:11,839
这些年来，我失去了莉帕和什穆利的踪迹，但最近他们又出现了，手里还掌握着数量惊人的比利时迷幻药。
So now, I lost track of Lipa and Shmully in the years, but recently they reappeared, having come into possession of an indecent fuckin' amount of Belgian ecstasy.

844
01:01:11,922 --> 01:01:13,715
那玩意儿简直要命。
The fucking right bollocks, it was.

845
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:16,802
吃了会让你眼神涣散，下巴像海盗船一样晃个不停。
Makes your eyes go fucking that way and your jaw do that like a pirate ship.

846
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:22,099
但是……最丢脸的是，我最近刚被罗曼逮了个正着。
But...the shame of it was I happened to be recently busted by Roman.

847
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:25,894
欠她一个线报，不然就把我关进去。
Owed her a snitch on something or she'd lock me up.

848
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:29,982
所以听说 X 的事后，我就给她通风报信了。
So when I heard about the X, I filled her in.

849
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:34,236
但这贱人根本不想抓人。
But, filth that she is, she's not interested in making an arrest.

850
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:39,324
看明白了吧？因为她自己也欠这个该死的俄罗斯黑帮老大伊戈尔一屁股债。
See? Because she's in debt herself to this evil fucking Russian mob boss Igor.

851
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:42,160
-哦。-哇，你还好吗？
-Oh. -Whoa. You all right?

852
01:01:42,244 --> 01:01:43,370
好吧。好吧。
All right. All right.

853
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:47,541
所以罗曼促成了这笔交易，在伊戈尔的地盘上通过科罗拉多的俱乐部销售 X 毒品。
So Roman brokered the deal to sell the X through Colorado's clubs on Igor's turf.

854
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:50,669
大家都能分一杯羹，但问题在于：
Everyone gets a cut, but here's the rub:

855
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:53,338
这些家伙没一个信得过对方管钱。
none of these fucks trust each other with the cash flow.

856
01:01:53,422 --> 01:01:55,257
他们想最后来个大分账。
They wanna do a big split at the end.

857
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:58,343
所以老兄，他们需要个管账的。
And for that, my friend, they need a banker.

858
01:01:58,427 --> 01:02:00,804
他们就放心让你管账？
And they trusted you to be their banker?

859
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:03,348
老子可不是什么混日子的废物，这是老子的饭碗。
I'm not some fucking wanker. I do this for a living.

860
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:04,975
我认识他们，有过节。
I know 'em. I've got history.

861
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:07,269
再说了，我他妈怕得要死。
Plus, also, I'm scared shitless of 'em.

862
01:02:07,352 --> 01:02:08,896
他们知道我不会坑他们。
They know I won't fuck 'em over.

863
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:11,607
-可你确实上了他们。-但那他妈不是故意的！
-Except you did fuck them. -But not on fucking purpose!

864
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,066
你说你爸中风了。
You said your dad had a stroke.

865
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:15,152
对，他他妈的死了。
Yeah, he's fucking dead.

866
01:02:16,778 --> 01:02:18,197
哦。
Oh.

867
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,948
哥们，听到这个我很难过。
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.

868
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,784
所以你当时不是想坑他们钱？
So you weren't trying to rip 'em off?

869
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:26,121
不是！我接到电话说我爸出事了，就立马回家了。
No! I got a call about Dad, I went home.

870
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:28,498
整个飞行途中我都魂不守舍。
That whole flight, I was mental.

871
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:33,378
到了伦敦发现我爸躺在重症监护室，半张脸肿得像布丁。
I get to London, Dad's in the fucking ICU, half his face is like a pudding.

872
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:37,466
哥们，操，我晕得不行。
Mate, fuck, I'm spinnin'.

873
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:41,053
然后那玩意儿真他妈上头了。
And it fucking hits me.

874
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:42,638
我谁都没说就溜了。
I dodged out without telling anyone.

875
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:44,014
我给语音信箱打了电话。
I call the answering service.

876
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:47,851
我收到上千条消息说要是拿不出钱就死定了
I've got a thousand messages saying how dead I am if I don't produce the money.

877
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:49,603
钱在哪？
So where is it?

878
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:58,195
还等什么？
What you waiting for?

879
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,035
拿着，派点用场
Here, hold this. Make yourself useful.

880
01:03:12,376 --> 01:03:14,503
欢迎来到这该死的纳尼亚。
Welcome to fucking Narnia.

881
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:25,556
本打算在我走那天进行那笔大额分账。
Supposed to do the big split the day I left.

882
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:29,726
-有多少钱？ -切！
-How much is there? -Pff!

883
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:33,438
稍微超过……四百万。
Wee bit over... ...four million.

884
01:03:34,565 --> 01:03:36,650
你把钥匙藏猫砂盆里了？
And you put the key in a litter box?

885
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:40,195
是啊！我哪能想到隔壁邻居会去翻那该死的猫屎啊？
Yeah. I didn't expect my next-door neighbor to go through the fucking cat shit, did I?

886
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:44,116
好吧，行。那我们打电话给罗曼。
OK. All right. OK. So we call Roman.

887
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:45,742
-不行，不能信她 -就告诉她钥匙在我们这儿
-No, we can't trust her. -We tell her we have it.

888
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:47,411
事情没那么简单。
It's more complicated than that.

889
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:49,371
复杂个屁！我只想回家。
Fuck complicated! I wanna go home.

890
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:53,917
我想见妈妈。我...哦，糟糕。妈妈。
I wanna see my mom. I... Oh, shit. Mom.

891
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:58,380
-电话。电话。-你想给你妈妈打电话吗？
-Phone. Phone. -You wanna phone your mum?

892
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,464
是啊。
Yeah.

893
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:02,342
别浪费我的通话时长。
Just don't use up my minutes.

894
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:05,053
是啊。顺便说一句，不客气。
Yeah. And you're welcome, by the way.

895
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:09,016
该死的...
Fucking...

896
01:04:16,982 --> 01:04:18,609
嘿，妈妈。是我。
Hey, Mom. It's me.

897
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:22,779
他们过得很好。嘿，听我说。
Yeah, they're doing great. Hey, listen.

898
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:31,538
电视上可能会有新闻，或者警方可能会......妈。妈，你必须听我说。
There's going to be news on the TV maybe or maybe the police will... Mom. Mom, you gotta listen to me.

899
01:04:31,622 --> 01:04:33,040
那不是真的，好吗？
It is not true, OK?

900
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:34,917
我没有做他们说的那些事。
I didn't do what they say.

901
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:39,129
-我现在没法解释。-挂电话。
-I can't explain right now. -Get off the phone.

902
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:41,215
我没事。我得走了。我爱你。
I'm OK. I have to go. I love you.

903
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:42,799
-快挂电话。-巨人队加油。
-Get off the phone. -Go Giants.

904
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:45,677
他们都以为我耍了他们，汉克。
They all think I fucked 'em, Hank.

905
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:48,972
我死定了，就算我带着钱出现。
I'm dead. Even if I show up with the money.

906
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:51,642
所以我要把钱全拿走然后逃走。
So I'm gonna take it all and run.

907
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:53,560
去拉瓜迪亚机场赶航班。
Catch a flight at LaGuardia.

908
01:04:54,311 --> 01:04:55,562
那我怎么办？
So, what happens to me?

909
01:04:57,147 --> 01:04:59,149
抱歉，伙计。你完蛋了。
Sorry, mate. You're fucked.

910
01:05:00,943 --> 01:05:03,403
进来吧。求你了。
Get in 'ere. Please.

911
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:05,781
快进来！
Get in 'ere!

912
01:05:06,823 --> 01:05:09,451
好的。行吧。这是你的手机。
OK. All right. Here's your phone.

913
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,311
好的。
All right.

914
01:05:41,108 --> 01:05:43,068
罗斯，你他妈死哪去了？
Russ, the fuck have you been?

915
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:45,320
-是汉克。 -汉克？
-It's Hank. -Hank?

916
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:46,989
罗斯回来了。
Russ came back.

917
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:49,116
-钱在我这儿。 -有意思。
-And I have the money. -Interesting.

918
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:52,244
你说过能帮我脱身，具体怎么做？
Now, you said you could get me out of this. How?

919
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:54,830
需要大量打点费用。
It's gonna take a lot of payoffs.

920
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:57,457
-所以我需要资金 -嗯哼
-So I need the money. -Uh-huh.

921
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:00,544
-还有件事 -洗耳恭听
-And one other thing. -I'm listening.

922
01:06:00,669 --> 01:06:02,004
替罪羊。
A fall guy.

923
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:04,590
除非你想蹲 20 年牢。
Unless you wanna do 20 to life.

924
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:06,717
——是啊，我也有个这样的。
--Yeah, I got one of those.

925
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:10,429
好了。这里是你要交钱的地方。
All right. Here's where you're gonna bring the money.

926
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:12,181
不，我来告诉你去哪。
No, I'll tell you where.

927
01:06:12,848 --> 01:06:14,933
好吧。你有什么计划？
Fine. What's your plan?

928
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:17,311
首先，我要那只猫。
First, I want the cat.

929
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:20,230
- 我们去哪？- 拉瓜迪亚机场。
- Where are we goin'? - LaGuardia.

930
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:21,398
是！
Yes!

931
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:24,484
-你来开车。-我告诉你怎么走。
-You drive. -I'll tell you where to go.

932
01:06:24,568 --> 01:06:25,861
-不，你...-你来开。
-No, y... -You're driving.

933
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:28,238
系好安全带。不会有事的。
Put your seat belt on. It'll be fine.

934
01:06:30,157 --> 01:06:32,075
--小心！
--Watch out!

935
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:33,493
靠！
Oh, shit!

936
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:36,163
哦，好吧。我没事。行了吧？
Oh, yeah. I'm all right. All right?

937
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:39,124
-快让开，快让开。-闭嘴，我在开车。
-Pull off, pull off. -Shut up. I'm driving.

938
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:44,087
好了，就停这儿。
All right, stop here.

939
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:53,680
我们来早了。
We're early.

940
01:06:53,764 --> 01:06:55,766
现在是 1010 WINS 体育广播的棒球节目时间。
It's time for 1010 WINS Sports with baseball.

941
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:58,352
大都会队今天在谢亚球场迎战勇士队。
The Mets are at Shea today with the Braves.

942
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:02,439
迈克·皮亚扎投出第三球。两人上垒。
Mike Piazza takes ball three. Two on.

943
01:07:02,523 --> 01:07:04,066
该死的棒球。
Fuckin' baseball.

944
01:07:04,149 --> 01:07:06,068
巨人队正在争夺外卡资格。
Giants are fightin' for the wild card.

945
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:09,613
我来聊聊英超，看你们有没有兴趣听。
I'll talk about the Premier League and see if you give a fuck.

946
01:07:09,696 --> 01:07:13,367
与此同时，在科罗拉多，巨人队在第一局以一分领先。
Meanwhile, in Colorado, the Giants have taken a one-run lead in the first.

947
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,910
太他妈棒了。
Fuck yeah.

948
01:07:16,578 --> 01:07:18,372
哇哦！威皮先生。
Ooh! Mr. Whippy.

949
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:23,377
-我们是在法拉盛草地公园吗？-嗯。
-Are we in Flushing Meadows? -Uh-huh.

950
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:25,629
我们得在航班起飞前接上巴德。
We have to pick up Bud before our flight.

951
01:07:25,712 --> 01:07:28,173
巴迪？他在哪儿？
Buddy? Where is he?

952
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:30,759
喂。你把我的猫交给谁了？
Oi. Who'd you give my cat to?

953
01:07:35,472 --> 01:07:36,765
我没把他交给任何人。
I didn't give him to anyone.

954
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:43,063
噢，你这该死的贱人！她会杀了我的！
Oh, you fucking cunt! She'll kill me!

955
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:44,231
-闭嘴。-不，滚开！
-Shut up. -No, fuck off!

956
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:45,691
-她会杀了我的！-没事的。
-She'll kill me! -It's gonna be OK.

957
01:07:45,774 --> 01:07:47,860
她会先宰了我，再他妈宰了你！
She'll fucking kill me, then she'll fucking kill you!

958
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:50,529
- 不。搞什么鬼？见鬼！
- No. What the fuck? The fuck?

959
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:51,780
- 你必须相信我！
- You have to trust me!

960
01:07:51,864 --> 01:07:57,578
-我凭什么要信你？-你...这个...棒球混蛋！
-Why would I ever do that? -You... Fucking... Mr. Baseball!

961
01:07:58,871 --> 01:08:01,915
-啊！该死！-钱在哪？
-Aahh! Fuck! -Where's the money?

962
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:04,251
-我没有钱！-别相信她！
-I don't have the money! -Don't trust her!

963
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:06,503
关键是要你把钱带来。
The point was for you to bring the money.

964
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:09,715
我带了钥匙，拉斯会带你去拿钱！
I brought the key, and Russ will take you to the money!

965
01:08:09,798 --> 01:08:13,010
-汉克！她杀了伊冯。-不。你得带我去找它。
-Hank! She killed Yvonne. -No. You'll take me to it.

966
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:14,386
-休想！-她会杀了你的！
-Not gonna happen! -She'll murder you!

967
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:16,220
-那就让她杀了我！-你们两个都给我上车。
-Then she'll murder me! -Both of you get in the car.

968
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:18,182
不！我他妈哪儿也不去！
No! I'm not going fucking anywhere!

969
01:08:18,265 --> 01:08:20,434
-拉斯！拉斯！-去你妈的！操！
-Russ! Russ! -Fuck you! Fuck!

970
01:08:20,517 --> 01:08:22,144
嘿，嘿，嘿！
Hey, hey, hey!

971
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:24,563
操。
Fuck.

972
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:26,148
哎哟！
Ow!

973
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:31,694
没错！混蛋们！就是这样，蠢货们，退后！
Yeah, that's right! Fuckers! That's it, fucktards, back up!

974
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:33,613
-老兄。老兄。
- Bud. Bud.

975
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:36,533
- 不许动！ - 不许动！
- Don't you move! - Don't you move!

976
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:37,951
去你的，给我停下。
Yeah, fuck you, stop.

977
01:08:38,035 --> 01:08:40,495
把猫弄上车！
Get the cat in the car!

978
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:42,872
别动！后退！去你的！
Don't! Back up! Fuck you!

979
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:45,751
操！操，操蛋。
Fuck! Fuck, fuck.

980
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:49,087
- 滚开！ - 哦，操，操，操！
- Get out of the way! - Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

981
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:50,546
- 哦，见鬼！
- Oh, fuck!

982
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:51,631
操！
Fuck!

983
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:58,388
去你妈的，你这个该死的混蛋！
Fuck you, you fucking horrible cunt!

操！操！
Fuck! Fuck!

987
01:09:06,604 --> 01:09:08,564
汉克，我觉得罗曼真的杀了伊冯娜！
Hank, I think Roman really did kill Yvonne!

988
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:09,691
别再说了！
Stop saying that!

989
01:09:09,774 --> 01:09:11,527
听着！伊冯娜是被射中太阳穴而死的，对吧？
Listen! Yvonne was shot in the temple, right?

990
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:12,778
别再提这事了！
Stop talking about it!

991
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:14,947
罗曼当时也是这样对科罗拉多开枪的，对吧？
And Roman shot Colorado that exact same way, yeah?

992
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:17,448
拉斯，罗曼根本没理由这么做！
Russ, there's no reason for Roman to do it!

993
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:20,160
万一罗曼当时在伊冯家找钥匙呢？
What if Roman was at Yvonne's looking for the key?

994
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:22,162
伊冯进来了，事情就这样发生了。砰！
Yvonne came in and that was that. Bang!

995
01:09:22,246 --> 01:09:23,455
一枪打中太阳穴。
One in the temple.

996
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:29,502

-Oh, fuck! -Brake! Brake!

-Very funny, cunts! -Go, go, go.

1015
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:34,902

Go, go, go.

1016
01:10:36,486 --> 01:10:39,448

01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:20,891
我杀了戴尔，当时满脑子只想着自己搞砸了膝盖，再也不能打棒球了。
I killed Dale, and all I thought about was how I fucked up my knee and I couldn't play baseball anymore.

1083
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:22,559

我需要你离开这栋房子。
I need you to get out of the house.

1088

01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:39,868
你能答应我你会去吗？
Will you promise me that you're gonna go?

1097
01:18:23,078 --> 01:18:25,372

1098
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:27,958
对，就是他。
Yeah. Him.

1100

死了。
Dead.

1101
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:33,005
这倒是个意外转折。
Well, that's a twist.

1102
01:18:34,173 --> 01:18:35,841
但我能给你弄到钱。
But I can get you the money.

1103
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:36,925
好的。
OK.

1104
01:18:37,509 --> 01:18:38,844
帮我个忙，汉克。
Do me a favor, Hank.

1105
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:40,929
别让我们再追着你不放了，好吗？
Don't make us chase you again, OK?

1106
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:43,557
不。我再也不会逃跑了。
No. I'm done running.

1107
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:47,561

但只有我知道钱锁在哪里。
But I'm the only one who knows where the money's locked up.

1127
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:04,179

-你开过枪吗，汉克？-没有。
-You ever fired a gun, Hank? -No.

扣动扳机，是这世上最简单的事。
Pulling the trigger, easiest thing in the world.

我不会需要枪的。
I won't need a gun.

1167
01:24:53,594 --> 01:24:54,761
我们为什么要给你一把枪？
Why would we give you a gun?

1168
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,641
让我看看你的手。
Show me your hands.

1169

来吧。这儿，让我看看。
Come on. Here, lemme see 'em.

对，来吧。
Yeah, come on.

-He's got soft hands, huh? -Oh.

01:25:09,693 --> 01:25:12,613
-嘿！别动！-不行不行不行。快过来！
-Hey! Stay! -No, no, no. Come on!

1174
01:25:12,696 --> 01:25:13,947
我还以为要和你一起进去呢。
I thought I was going in with you.

1175
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:16,450
我们为什么要拿你的生命冒险？嗯？
Why would we risk your life? Huh?

1176
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:18,577
你得带我们去找那笔钱。明白吗？
We need you to take us to the money. Yes?

1177
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,454
我必须进去。我得确认事情办妥了。
I have to go in. I have to know it's done.

1178
01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:22,581
我不进去，就休想让我带你们找到任何东西。
If I don't go in, I don't take you to anything.

1179
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:24,041
你最好按我们说的去做。
Oh, you'll do what we tell you to do.

1180
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:33,050
不然的话，我们不会动你妈妈，但会对她心爱的儿子做些让她生不如死的事。
If you don't, we're not gonna touch your mommy, but we'll do things to her beloved son that'll make her wish she was dead.

1181
01:25:34,927 --> 01:25:38,263
明白了吧。在这等着。别担心。
You understand that. Wait here. Don't worry.

1182
01:25:40,933 --> 01:25:42,351
一切都会好起来的。
All will be well.

哦。
Oh.

啤酒在这儿。还有花生糖。
Beer here. Cracker Jack.

1196
01:28:38,402 --> 01:28:40,320
要搭配薯条吗？
Do you want fries with that?

1197
01:29:27,367 --> 01:29:29,328
钥匙。马上交出来。
The key. Now.

1198
01:29:31,622 --> 01:29:34,208
-我没有。 -在哪？
-I don't have it. -Where is it?

1199
01:29:35,751 --> 01:29:36,877
我扔海里了。
I threw it in the ocean.

1200
01:29:38,587 --> 01:29:40,297
你他妈在耍我吗？
Are you fucking with me?

1201
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:44,218
你永远不知道什么时候会出事。
You never know when something'll pop loose.

1202
01:29:46,762 --> 01:29:47,888
哦。
Oh.

1203
01:30:06,865 --> 01:30:08,075
啊！该死！
Aahh! Fuck!

1204
01:30:11,828 --> 01:30:13,330
你扣不下扳机的，汉克。
You can't pull that trigger, Hank.

1205
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:14,706
他妈的闭嘴！
Shut the fuck up!

1206
01:30:29,596 --> 01:30:31,515
哦，刚才你差点把我唬住了。
Oh, you had me going for a minute.

1207
01:30:34,393 --> 01:30:36,144
你他妈根本不是个杀手。
You're not a fucking killer.

1208
01:30:38,105 --> 01:30:39,356
你说得对。我不是。
You're right. I'm not.

1209
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:45,028
但那些家伙是。
But those guys are.

1210
01:30:59,001 --> 01:31:00,002
拿到钥匙。
Get the key.

1211
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:02,629
钥匙不在她身上。
She doesn't have it.

1212
01:31:04,131 --> 01:31:06,466
-什么？ -快来吧。
-What? -Come on.

1213
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:09,636
- 喂。嘿。 - 汉克。
- Oy. Hey. - Hank.

1214
01:31:11,263 --> 01:31:13,515
嘿，老兄。没事的。有我在。
Hey, Bud. It's OK. I got ya.

1215
01:31:34,912 --> 01:31:37,080
-这家伙。 -疯子。
-This guy. -Meshuggener.

1216
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:40,626
好的，我们出发吧。该走了。
All right, come on. It's time to go.

1217
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:42,878
-你要去哪儿？-我来开车。
-Where you going? -I'm gonna drive.

1218
01:31:43,462 --> 01:31:44,463
今天是安息日。
It's Shabbas.

1219
01:31:45,964 --> 01:31:47,841
我这位当拉比的兄弟。
My brother the rabbi.

1220
01:31:48,383 --> 01:31:50,344
-汉克，你来开车。-我不会开车。
-You drive, Hank. -I don't drive.

1221
01:31:51,261 --> 01:31:54,056
汉克，你之前耍我们玩的时候还挺有幽默感的。
Hank, we've had a sense of humor with you jerking us around.

1222
01:31:54,598 --> 01:31:58,393
但我们在哈西姆那儿已经够麻烦了，不能在安息日开车。
But we're in enough trouble with Hashem without driving on Shabbas.

1223
01:32:01,104 --> 01:32:02,564
开车吧，汉克。
Drive the car, Hank.

1224
01:32:11,782 --> 01:32:19,122
♪在科帕♪科帕卡巴纳♪哈瓦那以北最火热的地方...♪
♪ At the copa ♪ Copacabana ♪ The hottest spot north of Havana... ♪

1225
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,876
-系好安全带。-开车吧，汉克。拜托了。
-Buckle your seat belts. -Drive the car, Hank. Please.

1226
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,711
我们走。我们走。
Let's go. Let's go.

1227
01:32:25,504 --> 01:32:26,880
给你。
There you go.

1228
01:32:28,006 --> 01:32:30,843
-看路，汉克。-稳一点，慢一点。
- Eyes on the road, Hank. - Nice and slow.

1229
01:32:33,554 --> 01:32:35,722
那么，我现在会怎样？
So, what happens to me now?

1230
01:32:37,516 --> 01:32:40,310
对我们来说，明智的做法是除掉你。
Smart thing for us would be to get rid of you.

1231
01:32:41,395 --> 01:32:44,231
但那个男人深爱着他的母亲。
But the man loves his mommy.

1232
01:32:44,314 --> 01:32:46,900
他竭力对她尽孝，简直到了痴狂的地步。
He tries to do right by her and is truly meshuga.

1233
01:32:47,776 --> 01:32:50,654
我们怎能不对这样的男人心生喜爱呢？
How can we not feel fondness for a man like that?

1234
01:32:53,073 --> 01:32:54,533
你在期待什么呢，汉克？
What are you hopin' for, Hank?

1235
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:59,162
- 我想回家。- 嗯。
- I wanna go home. - Mm.

1236
01:33:00,163 --> 01:33:04,084
你所经历的种种，或许家乡已无你容身之处。
Things you've seen and done, it may be home has no room for you.

1237
01:33:08,213 --> 01:33:09,214
什么？
What?

1238
01:33:10,674 --> 01:33:11,884
你想要的是问心无愧吗？
A clear conscience is what you want?

1239
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:13,760
汉克，你觉得你能做到吗？
You think you can have that, Hank?

1240
01:33:16,263 --> 01:33:17,264
不知道。
I don't know.

1241
01:33:33,655 --> 01:33:36,450
我们可以给你 10 万美金。
What we could do, we could give you 100 grand.

1242
01:33:36,533 --> 01:33:41,455
-再加点。-也许再多加点，算是对你服务的酬劳。
-A little more. -Maybe a little more than 100 grand for services rendered.

1243
01:33:43,582 --> 01:33:45,667
有这么多钱，一个人能跑很远的路。
A man could run a long way on that much money.

1244
01:33:46,877 --> 01:33:48,879
再说，你本来也没想杀拉斯。
And besides, you didn't mean to kill Russ.

1245
01:33:48,962 --> 01:33:51,089
也许警察会相信你。对吧？
Maybe the police'll believe you. Right?

1246
01:33:51,173 --> 01:33:53,717
我的意思是，谁都看得出来你不是真正的杀手。
I mean, anyone can see you're not a real killer.

1247
01:33:56,386 --> 01:33:57,638
所以你这是在帮我积德？
So you're doin' me a mitzvah?

1248
01:33:59,473 --> 01:34:01,183
是我们帮你积德。
We're doin' you a mitzvah.

1249
01:34:02,809 --> 01:34:05,771
-打火机怎么了？ -哦，那是我的错。
-What happened to the lighter? -Oh, that's my fault.

1250
01:34:05,854 --> 01:34:07,397
- 兄弟，安息日呢 - 没事的。
- Brother, Shabbas. - It's all right.

1251
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:10,025
汉克会帮我点火的。给。
Hank'll light it for me. Here.

1252
01:34:11,026 --> 01:34:12,528
现在你可得帮我个忙。
Now you do me a mitzvah.

1253
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,794
扣扳机就行。
Just pull the trigger.

1254
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:32,464
世上最简单的事。
Easiest thing in the world.

1255
01:34:48,981 --> 01:34:51,191
我不是故意偷的。我只是想借个火。
I didn't intend to steal it. I just needed a light.

1256
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:52,651
大哥。
Brother.

1257
01:34:57,823 --> 01:34:59,157
我们为你的女儿感到遗憾。
We're sorry about your girl.

1258
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:02,244
你从我们这儿逃走了，汉克。你让我们追着你跑。
You ran from us, Hank. You made us chase you.

1259
01:35:02,327 --> 01:35:04,204
你得知道别来招惹我们。
We had to let you know not to mess with us.

1260
01:35:04,288 --> 01:35:06,957
没错。只能怪你自己。
That's true. No one to blame but yourself.

1261
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:10,043
可悲的世界。
Sad world.

1262
01:35:12,421 --> 01:35:13,422
破碎的世界。
Broken world.

1263
01:35:26,685 --> 01:35:27,978
你在干嘛？
What're you doing?

1264
01:35:28,687 --> 01:35:31,690
嘿，慢点。我们不想引人注目。
Hey, slow down. We don't wanna draw attention.

1265
01:35:32,858 --> 01:35:35,861
-轻点，汉克。慢点。 -嘿，嘿，嘿。
-Easy, Hank. Slow down. -Hey, hey, hey.

1266
01:35:36,403 --> 01:35:39,823
-汉克，慢点！ -嘿！你在干什么？汉克！
-Hank, slow down! -Hey! What're you doin'? Hank!

1267
01:35:39,907 --> 01:35:41,283
慢点！我们能解决这事的！
Slow down! We can sort this out!

1268
01:35:41,366 --> 01:35:42,784
-汉克，汉克！ -慢点，汉克！
-Hank, Hank! -Slow down, Hank!

1269
01:35:43,327 --> 01:35:44,870
-嘿！汉克！ -汉克！慢点！
-Hey! Hank! -Hank! Slow down!

1270
01:35:44,953 --> 01:35:46,371
住手！
Stop!

1271
01:36:26,161 --> 01:36:27,162
嘿。
Hey.

1272
01:36:28,622 --> 01:36:30,958
你没事吧？你没事的。
You all right? You're all right.

1273
01:36:35,337 --> 01:36:36,421
好的。
OK.

1274
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:43,637
我们真不该让那外族人开车。
We shouldn't have let the goy drive.

1275
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:07,327
所以，我那几个哥们儿说服我别坐地铁。
So, my mates convinced me to skip the underground.

1276
01:37:07,411 --> 01:37:10,789
谁能想到他妈的在出租车里也能出车祸？
Never think you'll get in an accident in a fucking taxi, do ya?

1277
01:37:10,873 --> 01:37:13,500
说真的，谁系安全带啊？也就他妈的老太太们吧？
I mean, who wears a seat belt, fucking grannies?

1278
01:37:13,584 --> 01:37:17,629
我整个脸直接撞上了有机玻璃防护罩，-对吧？-还有人受伤吗？
Went face-fucking-first into the plexiglass shield, -didn't I? -Anyone else hurt?

1279
01:37:17,713 --> 01:37:22,092
没有，就我一个。不过我告诉你，我一定要把那该死的出租车公司告到倾家荡产。嗯？
No, just me. Tell you what, I'm suing the shit out of that fucking cab company, though. 'Ey?

1280
01:37:22,843 --> 01:37:24,720
-有行李吗，迈纳先生？-就一件。
-Bags, Mr. Miner? -Just one.

1281
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:27,181
喂。
Oi.

1282
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:30,475
挺沉的。
Heavy.

1283
01:37:30,559 --> 01:37:33,270
是啊，带些线缆、迷你音箱之类的玩意儿。
Yeah, well, cables, mini amp and shit.

1284
01:37:33,353 --> 01:37:34,521
在那边接了几场演出。
Playing some gigs down there.

1285
01:37:49,036 --> 01:37:51,246
-旅途愉快。-谢谢。
-Have a good trip. -Thank you.

1286
01:37:59,379 --> 01:38:00,214
下一个。
Next.

1287
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:04,927
喂，是我，妈。
Hey, it's me, Ma.

1288
01:38:05,511 --> 01:38:06,678
嗯，我没事。
Yeah, I'm OK.

1289
01:38:07,346 --> 01:38:09,223
你可以回家了，现在安全了。
You can go home. It's safe now.

1290
01:38:10,766 --> 01:38:11,767
听我说。
Listen to me.

1291
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:14,394
妈妈，我得离开一阵子。
Mama, I gotta go away for a while.

1292
01:38:14,478 --> 01:38:15,896
不过一切都会好起来的。
But it's gonna be OK.

1293
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:19,733
不，我不能回家。
No, I can't come home.

1294
01:38:19,816 --> 01:38:22,653
我需要先照顾好自己一段时间。
I just need to take care of myself for a while.

1295
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:26,907
过几天你会收到一个包裹。
You're gonna get a package in the next few days.

1296
01:38:28,784 --> 01:38:31,161
那是我全部家当的一半。
It's half of everything I have in the world.

1297
01:38:33,038 --> 01:38:36,750
妈 我现在得挂了 但我非常爱你。
Hey, Mom, I gotta go right now, but I love you so much.

1298
01:38:36,834 --> 01:38:39,002
你可以在家观看决胜局。
You can watch the tie-breaker at home.

1299
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:40,462
巨人队加油。
Go Giants.

1300
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:10,450
-谢谢。-非常感谢。
-Thank you. -Thank you so much.

1301
01:39:31,471 --> 01:39:32,472
棒球怎么样？
Baseball OK?

1302
01:39:35,601 --> 01:39:36,768
啤酒？还是玛格丽特？
Beer? Margarita?

1303
01:39:41,481 --> 01:39:42,733
苏打水吧。
Club soda.

1304
01:39:44,109 --> 01:39:45,152
好可爱的猫。
Nice cat.

1305
01:39:47,738 --> 01:39:49,323
你把他照顾得很好吗？
You take good care of him?

1306
01:39:50,574 --> 01:39:51,700
我在努力。
I'm trying.

1307
01:39:54,786 --> 01:39:56,580
- 他爱咬人。 - 哦。
-He's a biter. -Oh.

1308
01:40:01,877 --> 01:40:09,051
邦兹，这位可能根本没轮到击球的选手，不仅将上场击球，还可能是追平比分的关键跑垒员...就靠你了，伙计。
Bonds, who might not have even batted this inning, not only will bat but he is the possible tying run... Just you and me, Bud.

1309
01:40:09,134 --> 01:40:12,763
...尽管巨人队在这局开始时落后 5 分。
...even though a 5-run deficit faced the Giants when the inning started.

1310
01:40:12,846 --> 01:40:14,890
巴里·邦兹对阵穆赫兰。
So Barry Bonds against Mulholland.

1311
01:40:14,973 --> 01:40:17,935
邦兹在 46 次打席中击出六支本垒打。
Six homeruns for Bonds in those 46 at-bats.

1312
01:40:18,018 --> 01:40:22,898
邦兹连续第二次满垒上场击球。投球来了。
Bonds batting with the bases loaded for the second straight time. And here comes the pitch.
