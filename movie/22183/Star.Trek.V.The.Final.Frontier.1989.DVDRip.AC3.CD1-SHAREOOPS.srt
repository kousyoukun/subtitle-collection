1
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:50,165
I thought weapons were forbidden
on this planet.

2
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,010
Besides...

3
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:04,722
...I can't believe you'd kill me
for a field of empty holes.

4
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,694
It's all I have.

5
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,486
- Your pain runs deep.
- What do you know of my pain?

6
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,353
Let us explore it... together.

7
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,894
Each man hides a secret pain.

8
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:49,091
It must be exposed and reckoned with.

9
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:53,602
It must be dragged
from the darkness into the light.

10
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:58,436
Share your pain.
Share your pain with me.

11
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,773
And gain strength from the sharing.

12
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,361
Where did you get this power?

13
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,701
The power was within you.

14
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,818
It is as if a weight
has been lifted from my heart.

15
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:43,717
- How can I repay you?
- Join my quest.

16
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:49,225
- What is it you seek?
- What you seek.

17
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:58,001
What all men have sought
since time began.

18
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:01,662
The ultimate knowledge.

19
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,506
To find it we need a starship.

20
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,739
A starship? There are
no starships on Nimbus III.

21
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,079
- I have a way to bring one here.
- But how?

22
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:22,924
Have faith, my friend.
There are more of us than you know.

23
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,893
You're a Vulcan.

24
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:59,765
"You'll have a great time
on shore leave, Bones."

25
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,998
"You'll be able to relax."

26
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,543
You call this relaxing?
I'm a nervous wreck.

27
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,808
If I'm not careful,
I'll end up talking to myself.

28
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,629
Greetings, Captain.

29
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:35,637
- Spock, what are you doing here?
- I'm monitoring your progress.

30
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:40,574
I'm flattered, but of all the
points of interest here why pick me?

31
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:46,844
The record for climbing El Capitan
is in no danger of being broken.

32
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:51,490
I'm doing this because I enjoy it.

33
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:56,321
Not to mention the most important
reason for climbing a mountain...

34
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,488
Because it's there.

35
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,636
I do not think you realize
the gravity of your situation.

36
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,838
On the contrary,
gravity is foremost on my mind.

37
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:17,141
I'm trying to make an ascent.
Go pester Dr. McCoy.

38
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,117
Dr. McCoy is not in the best of moods.

39
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,779
Goddamn irresponsible!

40
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,162
Playing games with life.

41
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,197
Concentration is vital.
You must be one with the rock.

42
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,892
If you don't stop distracting me...

43
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:06,887
Perhaps "because it is there" is not
sufficient reason to climb a mountain.

44
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,125
I am hardly in a position to disagree.

45
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,697
Hi, Bones.
Mind if we drop in for dinner?

46
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:28,204
- I am Caithlin Dar.
- Yes! Our new Romulan representative.

47
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:34,842
Welcome to Paradise City, capital
of the Planet of Galactic Peace.

48
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:39,582
I'm St John Talbot, the Federation
Representative here on Nimbus III.

49
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:44,456
My charming companion
is the Klingon Consul, Korrd.

50
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:52,566
- I expect that's Klingon for hello.
- Come in, my dear.

51
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:15,352
20 years ago, our three governments
agreed to develop this planet.

52
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:21,158
- A new age was born.
- It died a quick death.

53
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:26,896
The settlers we conned into
coming here took to fighting.

54
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,940
We forbad them weapons,
but they fashioned their own.

55
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,340
It appears I've arrived just in time.

56
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,868
Get away from that transmitter.

57
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,244
Romulan.

58
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,321
Terran.

59
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,615
Klingon.

60
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,921
- Consider yourselves my prisoners.
- Prisoners?

61
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,793
We're already prisoners here
on this worthless lump of rock.

62
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:06,700
- What value could we be to you?
- Nimbus III <i>is</i> a worthless lump of rock.

63
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:12,469
But it is the only place in the galaxy
that has the three of you.

64
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:19,311
Our governments will stop at nothing
to ensure our safety.

65
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,510
That's exactly what I'm counting on.

66
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,599
<i>USS Enterprise,</i>
<i>shakedown cruise report.</i>

67
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:41,796
<i>I think this new ship</i>
<i>was put together by monkeys.</i>

68
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:47,343
<i>Half the doors won't open, and guess</i>
<i>whose job it is to make it right?</i>

69
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,946
Borgus frat!

70
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:56,147
"Let's see what she's got, Scotty."
We found out, didn't we?

71
00:15:56,355 --> 00:16:01,122
- I know you'll whip her into shape.
- Uhura, I thought you were on leave.

72
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:07,163
- I thought we were going together.
- I can't leave her when she needs me.

73
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,195
I had a feeling you would
say something like that.

74
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,373
So I brought us dinner.

75
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:20,637
You're the most understanding woman
I know.

76
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:25,415
<i>Red alert.</i>

77
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:29,644
I just fixed that damn thing!

78
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,415
Turn it off, will you?

79
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,752
<i>Red alert.</i>

80
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,863
<i>This is a red alert.</i>
<i>Enterprise, acknowledge.</i>

81
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,932
This is Enterprise. Identify yourself.

82
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:51,599
<i>This is Starfleet. We have a Priority 7</i>
<i>situation in the Neutral Zone.</i>

83
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,541
- Scotty, this is for real.
- They can't be serious!

84
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,684
The ship's in pieces and
we've got less than a skeleton crew.

85
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:04,181
Starfleet, are you aware
of our current status?

86
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:10,954
<i>Yes. Stand by to copy operational</i>
<i>orders and recall key personnel.</i>

87
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,629
- Admit it, we're lost.
- Yes, but we're making good time.

88
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:22,102
<i>- Commander Sulu, come in.</i>
- I don't believe this.

89
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,537
Shore leave is cancelled.

90
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:30,010
- Rescued at last.
<i>- Return to prearranged coordinates.</i>

91
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:35,448
- You can't say we're lost.
- Is there a problem?

92
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:41,889
Yes. We've been caught in... a blizzard.

93
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:49,792
We can't see a thing.
Direct us to the coordinates.

94
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:55,065
My visual says
sunny skies and 70 degrees.

95
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:02,003
Look, the sun has come out.
It's a miracle.

96
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:06,344
<i>Don't worry, your secret is safe</i>
<i>with me. I'll send the shuttle for you.</i>

97
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,816
Uhura, I owe you one.

98
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,884
Come and get it!

99
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,721
Bones, knock it off.

100
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,057
We're right here and we're starving.

101
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:24,827
- Bipodal seeds, Doctor?
- Beans, Spock, but no ordinary beans.

102
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:29,371
These are from an old recipe
handed down to me by my father.

103
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,544
If you stick your Vulcan nose
up at these, -

104
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:37,181
- you're insulting
generations of McCoys.

105
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:42,479
In that case I have little choice
but to sample your beans.

106
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:54,530
Surprisingly good. It does have
a flavoring I'm not familiar with.

107
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:59,898
- That's the secret ingredient.
- Any more secret ingredient, Bones?

108
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,738
Be my guest.

109
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:10,575
- Your secret ingredient is alcohol?
- Tennessee whiskey.

110
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:14,912
Bourbon and beans, an explosive
combination. Can Spock handle it?

111
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,923
With that Vulcan metabolism,
he could eat a bowl of termites.

112
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:27,827
- Doctor, I am half human.
- It certainly doesn't show.

113
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,265
- Thank you.
- This guy never changes.

114
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:36,339
I insult him
and he takes it as a compliment.

115
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:44,481
- You two could drive a man to drink.
- What did I do?

116
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:51,953
Human life is far too precious
to risk on crazy stunts.

117
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:57,754
You should have been killed
when you fell off that mountain.

118
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,761
It did cross my mind.

119
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:04,060
But even as I fell
I knew I wouldn't die.

120
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:09,639
- Isn't he the only one who's immortal?
- No, it isn't that.

121
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:14,904
I knew I wouldn't die
because the two of you were with me.

122
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:19,743
- I do not understand.
- I've always known...

123
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,716
...I'll die alone.

124
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,621
I'll call Valhalla and
reserve a room for you.

125
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:42,697
All that time in space,
getting on each other's nerves...

126
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:49,472
So what do we do on shore leave?
We spend it together.

127
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:54,550
- Other people have families.
- Other people, not us.

128
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,887
What are you doing?

129
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,862
I'm preparing to toast a "marsh melon".

130
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:14,596
I'll be damned! A marsh melon.
Where did you learn to do that?

131
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:21,871
I have familiarized myself with the
customs associated with camping out.

132
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,815
What do we do
after we toast the marsh melon?

133
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:34,118
- We consume them.
- No, I mean after that.

134
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:39,958
We are required to engage in a ritual
known as the sing-along.

135
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:45,102
I haven't sung around the campfire
since I was a boy in Iowa.

136
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,966
What are we going to sing?

137
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:51,472
- "Camptown Races".
- "Pack up your troubles".

138
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,737
- Are we leaving?
- It's a song title.

139
00:21:54,946 --> 00:22:00,077
- "Moon over Rigel 7".
- "Row, row, row your boat".

140
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:04,915
- Do you know "Row your boat"?
- It didn't come up in my research.

141
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,887
The lyrics are very simple...

142
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,891
"Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream."

143
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:15,499
"Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream."

144
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:20,229
The Doctor and I will start off
and you jump in.

145
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:26,844
- Doctor, if you please.
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

146
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,330
- Spock, why didn't you jump in?
- I cannot comprehend the words.

147
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:54,370
It's a song, you green-blooded Vulcan.
The words aren't important.

148
00:22:54,573 --> 00:23:00,478
- You just have a good time singing.
- I am sorry, Doctor.

149
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:05,680
- Were we having a good time?
- I liked him better before he died.

150
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:10,321
Let's just get some sleep.

151
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:24,228
- Captain...
- We're on leave. Call me Jim.

152
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,836
- Jim...
- Yes, Spock?

153
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,530
Life is not a dream.

154
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,701
- Go to sleep, Spock.
- Yes, Captain.

155
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:40,016
- Good night, Bones.
- Good night, Jim.

156
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:44,780
- Good night, Spock.
- Good night, Doctor.

157
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,051
- Good night, Spock.
- Good night, Jim.

158
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,930
I don't know. I just don't know.

159
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,335
Get the damn light out of my face.

160
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:59,088
We had to send the shuttlecraft.

161
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,488
The transporter is non-operational.

162
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:08,064
- We have received new orders.
- I had my communicator.

163
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:12,669
- You forgot to take it with you.
- I wonder why I did that.

164
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:18,776
It appears shore leave has been
cancelled. Pack out your trash.

165
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:55,343
"All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to steer her by."

166
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:59,278
- Melville.
- John Masefield.

167
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:04,478
- Are you sure about that?
- I'm well-versed in the classics.

168
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:09,490
Then how come you don't know
"Row, row, row your boat"?

169
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,998
<i>- Enterprise, you have control.</i>
- We're doing just fine.

170
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:02,741
All I can say is, they don't make them
like they used to.

171
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:06,849
You told me you could have this ship
operational in two weeks.

172
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:10,283
I think you gave me too much time.

173
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:15,926
How many times do I have to tell you?
The right tool for the right job.

174
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:19,563
I've never seen him happier.

175
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,665
Bridge... I hope.

176
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:33,008
I could use a shower.

177
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,475
Yes.

178
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:44,947
- Doesn't anything work on this ship?
- They can't send us out like this.

179
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:51,622
- Starfleet transmission on line.
- Put it on the view screen.

180
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,366
Can we have a little quiet, please?

181
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,910
Can you clear that up?

182
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,706
Can we have a little quiet?

183
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,783
- Bob!
<i>- Jim!</i>

184
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:19,821
<i>- We are dressing informally.</i>
- I'm on my way to the shower.

185
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:23,118
<i>I apologize for cancelling shore leave.</i>

186
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,389
<i>We have a dangerous situation</i>
<i>out on Nimbus III.</i>

187
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,534
On the Planet of Galactic Peace?

188
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:35,900
<i>A terrorist force</i>
<i>has captured the only settlement.</i>

189
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:40,339
<i>They've taken hostages. The Klingon,</i>
<i>the Romulan, the Federation Consuls.</i>

190
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:48,042
<i>- The Enterprise is not up to specs...</i>
- The Enterprise is a disaster.

191
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:52,952
- We have ships in the quadrant.
<i>- But no experienced commanders.</i>

192
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:56,355
<i>- I need Jim Kirk.</i>
- Please!

193
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,361
<i>Proceed to Nimbus III</i>
<i>and assess the situation.</i>

194
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,056
<i>Avoid a confrontation.</i>

195
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:07,227
<i>Above all, however,</i>
<i>get those hostages back safely.</i>

196
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:12,899
- Have the Klingons responded?
<i>- No, but you can bet they will.</i>

197
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:18,947
- Plot a course for Nimbus III, Mr. Sulu.
- Course plotted.

198
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,745
I'm afraid the ship's problems
will have to be solved en route.

199
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:28,221
I'm counting on each one of you
to give his best. Let's go to work.

200
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:32,760
Jim, if you ask me, and you haven't...

201
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:36,957
I think this is a terrible idea.
We're bound to bump into the Klingons.

202
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:41,332
- And they don't exactly like you.
- The feeling's mutual.

203
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,942
Engine room, we'll need all the power
you can muster, mister.

204
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:51,172
We'll beat those Klingon devils
even if I have to get out and push.

205
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,408
I hope it won't come to that.

206
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:58,146
- All possible speed, Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, sir.

207
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:08,098
- What's the matter?
- I miss my old chair.

208
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:49,573
Captain's log: Stardate 84...

209
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,709
Captain's log: Stardate 84...

210
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,046
<i>- Good morning, Captain.</i>
- Forget it.

211
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:09,784
- We have the hostage information.
- Put it on the screen.

212
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:15,489
<i>This is an authorized transmission</i>
<i>from the Starfleet memory bank.</i>

213
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:22,972
- Not General Korrd!
- He's apparently fallen from favor.

214
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:28,271
Korrd's military strategies were
required learning at the Academy.

215
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:33,212
When they put me out to pasture,
I hope I fair better than Korrd.

216
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,144
This must be the hostage tape.

217
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:44,784
<i>A short time ago, we surrendered</i>
<i>to the Galactic Army of Light.</i>

218
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,991
<i>We are now in the protective custody</i>
<i>of their leader.</i>

219
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,967
<i>We will be treated humanely</i>
<i>as long as we cooperate.</i>

220
00:32:54,172 --> 00:33:00,338
<i>He requests that you send a starship</i>
<i>to parley for our release at once.</i>

221
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:05,812
<i>We are in good health and would</i>
<i>appreciate your immediate response.</i>

222
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:13,050
<i>I regret this desperate act,</i>
<i>but these are desperate times.</i>

223
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:17,785
<i>I mean no harm to these innocents,</i>
<i>but do not put me to the test.</i>

224
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:23,024
<i>I implore you to respond immediately.</i>

225
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:39,076
What is it?

226
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:45,188
- You look like you've seen a ghost.
- Perhaps I have, Captain.

227
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:15,151
Spock, what is it?
Do you know this Vulcan?

228
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,652
- I cannot be certain.
- But he does seem familiar?

229
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:22,485
He reminds me of someone
I knew in my youth.

230
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:28,529
- I didn't know you had one.
- I do not often think of the past.

231
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:34,603
- Who does he remind you of?
- A gifted young student.

232
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:38,902
He possessed a great intelligence.

233
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:45,711
It was assumed that he would
join the great scholars of Vulcan.

234
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,318
- But he was a revolutionary.
- What do you mean?

235
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,219
The knowledge he sought
was forbidden by Vulcan belief.

236
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:59,556
- Forbidden?
- He rejected his logical upbringing.

237
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:04,133
He embraced the animal passions
of our ancestors.

238
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:11,468
He believed the key to self-knowledge
was emotion... not logic.

239
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:15,134
Imagine that, a passionate Vulcan.

240
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:21,046
When he encouraged others to follow
him, he was banished from Vulcan.

241
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,447
Fascinating.

242
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,317
<i>- Captain to the bridge.</i>
- On my way.

243
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,699
- Spock?
- Coming, Captain.

244
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:47,505
- Approaching Nimbus III.
- Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.

245
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,580
Paradise City is demanding
to know our intentions.

246
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:59,085
Respond with static.
Let them think we're having difficulty.

247
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:04,455
Paradise City, we are barely
receiving your transmission.

248
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:11,534
- Transporter room, status.
- Transporter is still inoperative.

249
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:17,436
If we <i>could</i> lock on to the hostages,
we couldn't beam them up.

250
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:23,102
- We'll have to get them out ourselves.
- Klingon vessel approaching.

251
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,841
Bird of Prey.
1.9 hours till her weapons are in range.

252
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:30,020
Damn! Let's go.

253
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,340
Their scanning equipment
is primitive, but effective.

254
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:58,447
- Land at coordinate 856.3.
- That's far from the city.

255
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:03,916
- We cannot risk detection.
- Mr. Sulu, execute.

256
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:15,592
<i>- This is the starship Enterprise.</i>
- A Federation starship.

257
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:24,503
<i>This is Captain Pavel Chekov.</i>
<i>You are in violation of our treaty.</i>

258
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:28,611
<i>Release your hostages at once</i>
<i>or suffer the consequences.</i>

259
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:32,340
Your threats amuse me.
What consequences?

260
00:37:55,339 --> 00:38:00,709
<i>A Klingon warship</i>
<i>will arrive within the hour.</i>

261
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:06,213
- The Klingons will be quite angry.
<i>- They are likely to destroy the planet.</i>

262
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,683
Then it is fortunate I have you
and your starship to protect me.

263
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:16,656
You and your first officer
are to beam down to my coordinates.

264
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:23,266
<i>We will be happy to beam down,</i>
<i>but we must have certain assurances.</i>

265
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:30,234
At foot speed the journey
to the city will take 1.2 hours.

266
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:33,968
We don't have 1.2 hours.

267
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:39,741
Wait a minute... Perfect!
We'll have to get their attention.

268
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,635
What's that?

269
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,607
Is she naked?

270
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,176
Hello, boys.

271
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,351
I've always wanted to play
to a captive audience.

272
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:05,733
- Spock, be one with the horse.
- Yes, Captain.

273
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,239
Open the gate.
It's our lookout party.

274
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,643
Federation soldiers are right behind us.
Close the gate.

275
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,823
Where are they going?

276
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:34,555
- Spock...
- Hold your horse, I'm scanning.

277
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,964
The hostages are being held
in that structure.

278
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,376
Galileo, start your run.

279
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:57,547
Phasers on stun.
Sulu, take out that light.

280
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:16,806
- What's going on?
<i>- Surrender, you are under attack.</i>

281
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:21,501
- It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
<i>- Wait! Come back.</i>

282
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,558
- Uhura, come on down.
- Roger, coming in.

283
00:42:56,173 --> 00:43:02,544
<i>Nimbus III is famous for its wildlife,</i>
<i>and the fishing is terrific!</i>

284
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:07,012
<i>Easy financing through</i>
<i>Federation Federal can take you there.</i>

285
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:11,176
- Thank God.
- Please cooperate.

286
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,084
Hand over your weapons.

287
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:20,290
Well done, my friends.

288
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,966
<i>Qual se tu?</i>

289
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,607
Spock!

290
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,317
Spock, it's me.

291
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,457
It's Sybok.
You've finally caught up with me.

292
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:27,061
Don't you have anything to say to me?

293
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:35,897
You are under arrest for 17 violations
of the Neutral Zone Treaty.

294
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:52,322
- You've developed a sense of humor.
- I did not intend to amuse you.

295
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:58,723
These are serious charges.
However, if you surrender now...

296
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:04,697
I'm sorry, Spock, I'm not through
violating the Neutral Zone Treaty.

297
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:11,569
In fact, I'm just getting started.
For my next violation, -

298
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:15,643
- I intend to steal something.

299
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,940
Something very big.

300
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,512
Your starship.

301
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,748
You staged all this
to get your hands on my ship?

302
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:33,055
- Who are you?
- Captain James T Kirk.

303
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:39,896
I thought Captain Chekov...
I see... very clever, Captain.

304
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:47,307
Spock, you have been given
a second chance to join me.

305
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:54,673
- I am a Starfleet officer.
- Of course.

306
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:59,117
Of course. Then I'll take the ship
without your help.

307
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,275
- Shuttle en route.
- Position of Bird of Prey?

308
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,712
Closing!

309
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:03,978
- The Bird of Prey must have cloaked.
- Raise shields.

310
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:07,589
- The shuttle?
- Do it. Go to red alert.

311
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:23,565
Once we control your vessel,
we'll bring up our followers.

312
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:27,642
The Klingons are out there.
We'll be lucky to make it to the ship.

313
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,643
<i>This is Enterprise, red alert.</i>

314
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,306
<i>Bird of Prey approaching.</i>
<i>Raising shields.</i>

315
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,544
Find a safe harbor.

316
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,381
No!

317
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:46,592
No reply. Remain on course.

318
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:51,131
Listen to me. In order for this
craft to enter the landing bay, -

319
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:55,863
- Enterprise must lower the shields
and activate the tractor beam.

320
00:47:56,073 --> 00:48:01,272
- To re-raise the shields will take...
- 15.5 seconds.

321
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:05,812
An eternity, during which
we'll be vulnerable to attack.

322
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:11,977
He speaks the truth. If my people
are cloaked, then they intend to strike.

323
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:18,790
- We cannot turn back.
- Let me do something.

324
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:23,763
Very well, do what you must,
but no more.

325
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:33,800
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

326
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:44,549
Understand your situation.
Are unable to return to planet.

327
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:50,990
Stand by to execute
emergency landing plan... B.

328
00:48:54,264 --> 00:49:02,228
- Emergency landing plan B?
<i>- B as in barricade.</i>

329
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,968
What are you doing?

330
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:14,276
In order to lower and raise the shields
quickly, we'll forego the tractor beam.

331
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,476
We'll fly her in manually.

332
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:23,251
- How often have you done this?
- Actually, it's my first attempt.

333
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:29,389
He's good... really.

334
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,132
Scotty, open bay doors.

335
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,545
Scotty, lower shields.

336
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:52,745
Lowering shields.

337
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:05,635
- Bird of Prey bearing 105.2.
- Go, Sulu.

338
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,750
They're in.

339
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,150
Warp speed now!

340
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,877
We must change course at once.

341
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,127
I'll take you to the bridge.

342
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:16,591
Pick it up.

343
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,298
Sybok...

344
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,842
You must surrender.

345
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,543
No!

346
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:41,054
- You must kill me.
- Shoot him!

347
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:56,434
For a moment...
I thought you might actually do it.

348
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:06,246
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.

349
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:17,526
Spock, you will accompany me
to the bridge?

350
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:22,664
No... I will not.

351
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:27,803
You know I'm right.

352
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,271
Then you must join them.

353
00:53:56,166 --> 00:54:01,627
- These two will be useful.
- Give us a moment alone.

354
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,773
Don't be afraid.

355
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:25,754
Goddamn it, Spock.
You betrayed us all.

356
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,954
I do not expect you to forgive me.

357
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:32,999
- I ought to knock you on your ass.
- If you think it would help.

358
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:37,606
- You want me to hold him?
- Stay out of this... Why?

359
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:41,903
- All you had to do was pull the trigger.
- Then Sybok would be dead.

360
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,570
- I ordered you to defend your ship.
- And kill my brother.

361
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:52,984
- A fellow Vulcan is not a...
- Sybok also is a son of Sarek.

362
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:57,649
He's your brother brother?
You made that up.

363
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:02,958
- I did not.
- You don't have a brother.

364
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:07,466
- Technically I don't have a brother.
- See?

365
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:12,836
- I have a half-brother.
- I've got to sit down.

366
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:19,545
You and Sybok have the same father
but different mothers?

367
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:26,416
Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess,
but we were raised as brothers.

368
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:33,893
- Why didn't you tell us this before?
- It is a personal matter.

369
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:38,796
- For that I am sorry.
- That makes everything all right. Sorry!

370
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:43,132
Spock could no more kill
his own brother than he could kill you.

371
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:49,108
He's already in the brig. Besides,
we've got bigger problems to deal with.

372
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:52,338
Like how do we get out of here.

373
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:56,076
I'll say one thing,
you never cease to amaze me.

374
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:59,585
Nor I myself.

375
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:11,558
- I was beginning to worry.
- It's all right. Sybok will explain.

376
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:15,465
- What are you doing?
- Plotting our new course.

377
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:18,436
You have no authority.

378
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:28,014
- What's going on here?
- Pavel, listen to this man.

379
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:32,382
- I don't understand.
- Each of us hides a secret pain.

380
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:37,390
Share yours with me
and gain strength from the sharing.

381
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,504
Useless.

382
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:05,477
Unwise.

383
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:17,327
You could have warned me.
He did, Jim.
