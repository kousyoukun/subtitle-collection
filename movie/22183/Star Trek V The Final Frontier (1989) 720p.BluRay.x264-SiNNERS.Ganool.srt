1
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,800
I thought weapons were forbidden
on this planet.

2
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,300
Besides...

3
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,800
I can't believe you'd kill me,

4
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,700
for a field of empty holes.

5
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
All I have.

6
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,700
Your pain runs deep.

7
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,400
What do you know of my pain?
Let us explore it together.

8
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,300
Each man hides a secret pain.

9
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,300
It must be exposed and reckoned with.

10
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,200
It must be dragged from the darkness
and forced into the light.

11
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,386
Share your pain.

12
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:01,124
Share your pain with me.

13
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,400
And gain strength from the sharing.

14
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,300
Where did you get this power?

15
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,600
The power was within you.

16
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,900
I feel as if a weight has
been lifted from my heart.

17
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,300
How can I repay you for this miracle?

18
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,500
Join my quest.
What is it you seek?

19
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,300
What you seek.

20
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,100
What all men have sought since time began.

21
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,500
The ultimate knowledge.

22
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,400
To find it, we'll need a starship.

23
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,700
A starship?
There are no starships on Nimbus lll.

24
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,900
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.

25
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,400
But how?

26
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,241
Have faith, my friend.

27
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,524
There are more of us than you know.

28
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,700
You're a Vulcan.

29
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,288
You'll have a great time, Bones.

30
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:03,124
You'll enjoy your shore leave.

31
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,700
You'll be able to relax.

32
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,336
You call this relaxing?

33
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:10,024
I'm a nervous wreck.

34
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,300
If I'm not careful, I'll end up talking to myself.

35
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,300
Greetings, Captain.

36
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,175
Spock!

37
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,224
What are you doing in
this neck of the woods?

38
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,009
I have been monitoring your progress.

39
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,324
I'm flattered.

40
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,900
Twelve hundred points of interest
in Yosemite and you pick me.

41
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,800
I regret to inform you that the record
for free-climbing El Capitan

42
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
is in no danger of being broken.

43
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,632
I'm not trying to break any records.

44
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:54,824
I'm doing this because I enjoy it.

45
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,300
Not to mention the most important
reason for climbing a mountain.

46
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,400
And that is?

47
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,000
Because it's there.

48
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Captain?

49
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I do not think you realise the gravity
of your situation.

50
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,000
On the contrary.
Gravity is foremost on my mind.

51
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,500
Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here.

52
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,000
Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy
for a while?

53
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,300
I believe that Dr McCoy
is not in the best of moods.

54
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,600
Goddamn irresponsible...

55
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
Playing games with life.

56
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,100
Concentration is vital.
You must be one with the rock.

57
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:40,000
Spock, I appreciate your concern,
but if you don't stop distracting me,

58
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm liable to be one to...

59
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
fall!

60
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh, my God.

61
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,900
Perhaps because it is there

62
00:11:07,924 --> 00:11:10,200
is not sufficient reason
for climbing the mountain.

63
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,500
I'm hardly in a position to disagree.

64
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,824
Hi, Bones.

65
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,924
Mind if we drop in for dinner?

66
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,100
<i>Your dream can become a reality.
The Paradise Inn.</i>

67
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,410
<i>We have spared no expense to create
the closest thing to paradise in paradise.</i>

68
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,824
<i>City, that is.</i>

69
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,100
Gentlemen, I'm Caithlin Dar.

70
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,600
Oh, yeah.

71
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,100
Our new Romulan representative.

72
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,100
Welcome to Paradise City, my dear,

73
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,400
capital of the so-called
planet of galactic peace.

74
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,900
I'm St John Talbot, the Federation
representative here on Nimbus lll.

75
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,609
My charming companion here,

76
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:46,724
is the Klingon consul, Korrd.

77
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,200
I expect that's Klingon for Hello.

78
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,600
Won't you come in, my dear?

79
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,600
Twenty years ago our three governments,

80
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:17,200
agreed to develop this planet together.

81
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,925
A new age was born.

82
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,624
Our new age died a quick death.

83
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,100
And the settlers we conned
into coming here,

84
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,000
they were the dregs of the galaxy.

85
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Immediately took
to fighting amongst themselves.

86
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,000
We forbad them weapons,

87
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,900
and they soon began to fashion their own.

88
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,400
Well, then it appears I've arrived
just in time.

89
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,300
<i>We have spared no expense
to create the closest thing to...</i>

90
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,500
Get away from that transmitter!

91
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,800
Romulan.

92
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,700
Terran.

93
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,800
Klingon.

94
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,100
Consider yourselves my prisoners.

95
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,450
Prisoners?

96
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:03,324
We're already prisoners here on
this worthless lump of rock.

97
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,100
What possible value could we be to you?

98
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,800
Nimbus lll may be a worthless
lump of rock,

99
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,000
but it does have one unique treasure.

100
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,700
It's the only place in the entire galaxy
that has the three of you.

101
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,932
I don't know who you are, or what you want,

102
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:19,624
but I can tell you this.

103
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,400
Our governments will stop at nothing
to ensure our safety.

104
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,600
That's exactly what I'm counting on.

105
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,800
U.S.S. Enterprise,
shakedown cruise report.

106
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,000
I think this new ship was
put together by monkeys.

107
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh, she's got a fine engine,
but half the doors won't open.

108
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,900
And guess whose job it is to make it right?

109
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,800
Borgus Frat.

110
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,500
Let's see what she's got, said the Captain.

111
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,300
And then we found out, didn't we?

112
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,900
I know you'll whip her into shape,
Scotty. You always do.

113
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.

114
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,400
And I thought we were supposed to be
going together.

115
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,200
Oh, I cannot leave her now
when she needs me the most.

116
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,200
I had a feeling
you would say something like that.

117
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,700
So I brought us dinner.

118
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,300
Oh, lassie, you're the most
understanding woman I know.

119
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,133
<i>Red. Red. Red.</i>

120
00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:27,524
<i>Alert.</i>

121
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,000
I just fixed that damn thing.

122
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,000
Turn it off, will you?

123
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,881
<i>Red alert. Red alert.</i>

124
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:41,524
<i>This is a red alert.
Enterprise acknowledge.</i>

125
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,100
This is Enterprise. ldentify yourself.

126
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
<i>Enterprise, this is Starfleet.</i>

127
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,200
<i>We have a priority seven situation
in the Neutral Zone.</i>

128
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,000
Stand by, Starfleet.

129
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,533
Scotty, this is for real.

130
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:58,324
They can't be serious.

131
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,600
The ship's in pieces and we've got less
than a skeleton crew aboard.

132
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Starfleet, are you aware
of our current status?

133
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,300
<i>Current status understood.</i>

134
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,800
<i>Stand by to copy operational orders
and recall key personnel.</i>

135
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,500
Admit it. We're lost.

136
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,980
All right, we're lost.

137
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:19,424
But we're making good time.

138
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,900
<i>Commander Sulu, come in, please.
I don't believe this.</i>

139
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,400
Commander Sulu here.

140
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,700
Bad news, gentlemen.
Shore leave's been cancelled.

141
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,500
Rescued at last!

142
00:17:29,524 --> 00:17:31,800
<i>Return to prearranged
coordinates for pickup.</i>

143
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,000
Don't tell them you're lost.
You'll never live it down.

144
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,800
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

145
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,525
Yes...

146
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,624
we've been caught in a...

147
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,700
We've been caught in a blizzard.

148
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,100
And we can't see a thing.

149
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,800
Request you direct us to the coordinates.

150
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,800
<i>My visual says,</i>

151
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,100
sunny skies and 70 degrees.

152
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,300
Sulu, look. The sun's come out.
It's a miracle.

153
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,900
<i>Don't worry, fellas.
Your secret's safe with me.</i>

154
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,800
<i>I'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.</i>

155
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,600
Uhura, I owe you one. Sulu out.

156
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,200
Come and get it! Come and get it!

157
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,566
Knock it.
Bones! Bones!

158
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,125
Knock it off! We're right here.

159
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,100
And we're starving.

160
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,900
Bipodal seeds, Doctor?

161
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Beans, Spock. But no ordinary beans.

162
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,600
These are from an old Southern recipe
handed down to me by my father.

163
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,600
And if you stick your Vulcan nose up
at these,

164
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,300
you're not only insulting me,
but generations of McCoys.

165
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,800
In that case, I have little choice
but to sample your beans.

166
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,500
Surprisingly good.

167
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,300
It does have flavouring
I'm not familiar with.

168
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,000
That's the secret ingredient.

169
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,000
You got any more
of that secret ingredient, Bones?

170
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,400
Be my guest.
Thank you.

171
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,300
Am I to understand
that your secret ingredient is alcohol?

172
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,100
Whisky. Tennessee whisky, Spock.
You care for a little snort?

173
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,400
Bourbon and beans,
an explosive combination.

174
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Think Spock can handle it?

175
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Are you kidding?
With that Vulcan metabolism,

176
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,300
he could eat a bowl of termites
and it wouldn't bother him.

177
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,500
As you are so fond of pointing out,
Doctor, I'm half human.

178
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,400
Well, it certainly doesn't show.

179
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,800
Thank you.

180
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,800
How do you like that?
This guy never changes.

181
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:38,100
I insult him, and he takes it as a compliment.

182
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,700
You know, you two could drive
a man to drink.

183
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,800
Me? What did I do?

184
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,000
What did you do?

185
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,200
You really piss me off, Jim.

186
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,600
Human life is far too precious
to risk on crazy stunts.

187
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,000
Maybe it didn't cross
that macho mind of yours,

188
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,900
but you should've been killed
when you fell off that mountain.

189
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,900
It crossed my mind.
And?

190
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,900
And, even as I fell, I knew I wouldn't die.

191
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,900
I thought he was the only one
who's immortal.

192
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,900
Oh, no. It isn't that.

193
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,100
I knew I wouldn't die because
the two of you were with me.

194
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,000
I do not understand.

195
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,522
I've always known...

196
00:20:23,947 --> 00:20:25,224
I'll die alone.

197
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,100
Well, I'll call Valhalla
and have them reserve a room for you.

198
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,800
It's a mystery to me
what draws us together.

199
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,300
All that time in space, and we
getting on each others nerves,

200
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,300
and what do we do when shore leave
comes along?

201
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,700
We spend it together.

202
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,700
Other people have families.

203
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
Other people, Bones. Not us.

204
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,300
What are you doing?

205
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,800
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.

206
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,000
Well, I'll be damned. A marsh melon.

207
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,100
Where'd you learn to do that?

208
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,900
Before leaving the ship,
I consulted the computer library

209
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,700
to familiarise myself with the customs
associated with camping out.

210
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,000
Well tell me Spock.

211
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,400
What do we do after we toast the marsh a,
a marsh melon?

212
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,100
We consume them.

213
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,500
I know we consume them.
I mean after that.

214
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,600
I believe we are required to engage
in a ritual known as the sing-along.

215
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,475
That's great.

216
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,424
I haven't sung around a campfire
since I was a boy in Iowa.

217
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,000
What are we going to sing?
What...

218
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,500
Bones, what are we going to sing?

219
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,400
How about Camptown Races?

220
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,800
Pack Up Your Troubles.

221
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:56,200
Are we leaving, Captain?

222
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,000
It's a song title, Spock.

223
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,500
Moon over Rigel Vll.

224
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,000
Row, Row, Row Your Boat.

225
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,800
Row, Row, Row Your Boat. I love Row...

226
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,100
Do you know Row, Row, Row,
Row, Row Your Boat?

227
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,300
That song did not come up
in my research, Captain.

228
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,900
The lyrics are very simple. It's...

229
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,300
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

230
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,089
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,

231
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:18,524
Life is but a dream.

232
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,000
The Doctor and I will start it off,

233
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,800
and then when we give you a signal,
you jump in.

234
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,000
Doctor, if you please.

235
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,900
Don't say I didn't warn you.

236
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,755

Come on, Spock.

243
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,200
Why didn't you jump in?

244
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,800
I was trying to comprehend
the meaning of the words.

245
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,200
It's a song, you green-blooded Vulcan.

246
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,700
You sing it. The words aren't important.

247
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,100
What's important
is that you have a good time singing it.

248
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,300
I am sorry, Doctor.

249
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,300
Were we having a good time?

250
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,200
God, I liked him better before he died.

251
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,700
All right, all right, let's call it a night.

252
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,700
He just keeps after it.
Let's... Let's go to bed,

253
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,600
and just let's get some sleep.

254
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,300
Captain?
Spock, we're on leave.

255
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
You can call me Jim.

256
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,500
Jim?
Yes, Spock?

257
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Life is not a dream.

258
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,700
Go to sleep, Spock.

259
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,800
Yes, Captain.

260
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,300
Good night, Bones.
Good night, Jim.

261
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Good night, Spock.
Good night, Doctor.

262
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,600
Good night, Spock.
Good night, Jim.

263
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,600
I don't know. I just don't know.

264
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Captain Klaa, we have a target in sight.
A probe of ancient origin.

265
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,000
Difficult to hit?

266
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,500
Most difficult.

267
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,700
Good.

268
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,100
All weapons to my control.

269
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Scope!

270
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,500
Shooting space garbage
is no test of a warrior's mettle.

271
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,000
I need a target that fights back.

272
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,500
Captain, new data, hostages on Nimbus lll.

273
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,500
One of the hostages is a Klingon.

274
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,500
And the others?

275
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,900
A Terran and a Romulan.

276
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,500
That means the Federation
will be sending a rescue ship of its own.

277
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,900
Plot course for Nimbus lll.

278
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,900
I've always wanted to engage
a Federation ship.

279
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,000
Get that damn light out of my face!

280
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,600
Mr Scott apologises
for having to send the shuttlecraft.

281
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,500
The transporter beam is non-operational.

282
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,600
Captain, we've received important
orders from Starfleet command.

283
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:11,400
Why didn't you beep my communicator?

284
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
You forgot to take it with you.

285
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,700
Wonder why I did that.

286
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,000
Well, gentlemen, it appears
shore leave has been cancelled.

287
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,200
Pack out your trash.

288
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,011
All I ask is a tall ship,

289
00:26:56,236 --> 00:26:58,624
and a star to steer her by.

290
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,600
Melville.
John Masefield.

291
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,400
Are you sure about that?

292
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
I am well versed in the classics, Doctor.

293
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,100
Then how come you don't know
Row, Row, Row Your Boat?

294
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Ready for landing manoeuvre.
Enterprise, you have control.

295
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,400
You're doing just fine.

296
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,900
Landing bay oxygen to pressure.

297
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,000
Landing bay is secure.

298
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,600
Attention!

299
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,200
All I can say is, they don't make them
like they used to.

300
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,900
You told me you could have this ship
operational in two weeks.

301
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,300
I gave you three. What happened?

302
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,300
I think you gave me
too much time, Captain.

303
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,800
Very well, Mr Scott. Carry on.
Aye, sir.

304
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,100
How many times do I have to tell you?
The right tool for the right job!

305
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,400
I don't think I've ever seen him happier.

306
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,700
<i>Level?</i>

307
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,100
Bridge.

308
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
I hope.

309
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,600
I could use a shower.

310
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,400
Yes.

311
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,700
Doesn't anything work on this ship?

312
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,500
Starfleet's got some nerve
sending us out in this condition

313
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,100
with this handful of people.

314
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,600
Captain on the Bridge.

315
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,700
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.

316
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,400
Put it on the viewscreen,
will you, please?

317
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,200
Can we have a little quiet, please?

318
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,600
Can you...
Am I on?

319
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,200
Can you clear that up?

320
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,600
Can we have a little quiet?

321
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,000
<i>Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations.
Come in.</i>

322
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,900
Bob?
<i>Jim!</i>

323
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,900
<i>Well! We're dressing informally,
aren't we?</i>

324
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,600
You caught me on the way
to the shower.

325
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,275
<i>I apologise for cancelling shore leave,
but look...</i>

326
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,424
<i>we have a dangerous situation
out on Nimbus lll.</i>

327
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,035
On the planet of galactic peace?

328
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,924
<i>The same.</i>

329
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,700
<i>From what we can make out,</i>

330
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,800
<i>a terrorist force
has captured the only settlement.</i>

331
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,650
<i>And they've taken hostages.</i>

332
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:42,200
<i>The KIingon, the Romulan,</i>

333
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,600
<i>the Federation consuls.</i>

334
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,300
<i>Now, I know Enterprise is not exactly
up to specs...</i>

335
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,400
With all due respect,
the Enterprise is a disaster.

336
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,800
There must be other ships
in the quadrant.

337
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,200
<i>Other ships, yes.
But no experienced commanders.</i>

338
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,800
<i>Captain, I need Jim Kirk.</i>

339
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,058
Oh, please.
<i>Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus lll,</i>

340
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,424
<i>assess the situation,</i>

341
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,600
<i>and avoid a confrontation if possible.</i>

342
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,400
<i>Above all however,
get those hostages back safely.</i>

343
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,400
Have the Klingons responded?

344
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,000
No, but you can bet they will.

345
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,500
Understood. Kirk out.

346
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,200
Plot course for Nimbus lll, Mr Sulu.

347
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,400
Aye, sir.

348
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,400
Course plotted.

349
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,800
I'm afraid the ship's problems
will have to be solved en route.

350
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,400
Since we're undermanned, I'm counting
on each one of you to give his best.

351
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
End of speech. Let's go to work.

352
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,700
Jim...

353
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,624
if you ask me, and you haven't,

354
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,000
I think this is a terrible idea.
We're bound to bump into the Klingons,

355
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,200
and they don't exactly like you.

356
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,200
The feeling's mutual.

357
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,169
Engine Room.

358
00:30:46,494 --> 00:30:47,494
<i>Scotty here.</i>

359
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,300
We'll need all the power
you can muster, mister.

360
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,800
Don't you worry, Captain.
We'll beat those Klingon devils,

361
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,500
even if I have to get out and push.

362
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,700
I hope it won't come to that, Mr Scott.

363
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,300
All possible speed, Mr Sulu.

364
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Aye, sir.

365
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,800
What's the matter, Jim?

366
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,300
I miss my old chair.

367
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,300
The starship Enterprise
has been dispatched to Nimbus lll.

368
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,300
Enterprise?

369
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,000
That's Kirk's ship!

370
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,100
If I could defeat Kirk...

371
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,300
You would be the greatest warrior
in the galaxy.

372
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,700
Maximum speed.

373
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,900
Success!

374
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,400
Captain's Log, Stardate 845...

375
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,000
Captain's Log, Stardate 84...

376
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,073
<i>Good morning, Captain. </i>
That's...

377
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:06,424
Forget it.

378
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,100
Captain, we're receiving the hostage
information you requested.

379
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,200
Put it on the screen.

380
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,700
<i>This is an authorised transmission
from Starfleet Galactic Memory Bank.</i>

381
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,738
Not General Korrd.

382
00:32:21,763 --> 00:32:22,824
The same.

383
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,400
He's apparently fallen out of favour
with the Klingon High Command.

384
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,300
General Korrd's military strategies
were required learning

385
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,100
when I was a cadet at the Academy.

386
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,100
When they put me out to pasture,
I hope I fare better than Korrd.

387
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,300
This must be the hostage tape.

388
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,600
<i>A short time ago,
we willingly surrendered ourselves</i>

389
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,100
<i>to the forces
of the Galactic Army of Light.</i>

390
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,900
<i>At this moment,
we're in their protective custody.</i>

391
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,400
<i>Their leader assures us
that we will be treated humanely</i>

392
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,200
<i>so long as you cooperate
with his demands.</i>

393
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,714
<i>I believe his sincerity.</i>

394
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:01,724
<i>He requests that you send
a Federation starship</i>

395
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,540
<i>to parley for our release at once.</i>

396
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
<i>Be assured that we are in good health,</i>

397
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,100
<i>and would appreciate
your immediate response.</i>

398
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,200
<i>I deeply regret this desperate act,
but these are desperate times.</i>

399
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,100
<i>I have no desire to harm these innocents,</i>

400
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,100
<i>but do not put me to the test.
I implore you...</i>

401
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,700
<i>I implore you to respond immediately.</i>

402
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,100
What is it?

403
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,700
You look like you've just seen a ghost.
Perhaps I have, Captain.

404
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,300
Perhaps I have.

405
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,100
Spock, what is it?

406
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,370
Do you know this Vulcan?

407
00:34:18,495 --> 00:34:19,824
I cannot be certain.

408
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,500
But he does seem familiar.

409
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,700
He reminds me of someone
I knew in my youth.

410
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,300
Why, Spock, I didn't know you had one.

411
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,500
I do not often think of the past.

412
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,400
Who is it he reminds you of?

413
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,969
There was a young student,

414
00:34:35,594 --> 00:34:37,424
exceptionally gifted,

415
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,800
possessing a great intelligence.

416
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,885
It was assumed that one day,

417
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:48,300
he would take his place
amongst the great scholars of Vulcan.

418
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,420
But he was a revolutionary.

419
00:34:51,745 --> 00:34:53,024
What do you mean?

420
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,200
The knowledge and experience
he sought,

421
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,500
were forbidden by Vulcan belief.

422
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,050
Forbidden?

423
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:02,224
He rejected his logical upbringing,

424
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,800
and embraced the animal passions
of our ancestors.

425
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Why?

426
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,775
He believed the key
to self-knowledge was emotion...

427
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,524
not logic.

428
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,800
Imagine that. A passionate Vulcan.

429
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,800
When he encouraged others to follow him,

430
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,426
he was banished from Vulcan,

431
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:24,124
never to return.

432
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,333
Fascinating.

433
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,024
<i>Captain to the Bridge.</i>

434
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,200
On my way.

435
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,875
Spock?

436
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,824
Coming, Captain.

437
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,500
Approaching Nimbus lll.

438
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,400
Hailing frequency open.

439
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,200
Standard orbit, Mr Sulu.

440
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,100
Captain, we're receiving transmission
from Paradise City.

441
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,400
They're demanding to knownour intentions.

442
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:00,800
Respond with static.
Let them think we're having difficulty.

443
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,400
Which wouldn't be far from the truth.

444
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,800
Paradise City, can you boost your power?

445
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,900
We're barely receiving transmission.

446
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,700
Transporter Room. Status.

447
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,200
Scotty here, Captain.

448
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,500
Transporter is still inoperative.

449
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,900
Even if we could lock on
to the hostages,

450
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,500
we could not beam them up.

451
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
We're gonna have to get them out
the old-fashioned way.

452
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,500
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant.

453
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,200
Bird-of-prey. Estimating 1.9 hours
until her weapons come to bear.

454
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,933
Damn.

455
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:33,624
Let's go.

456
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,400
Their scanning equipment is primitive
but effective.

457
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,500
I recommend we land
at coordinates 8-5-6-3.

458
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,900
That puts us pretty far away
from Paradise City.

459
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,300
To land any closer
would be to risk detection.

460
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,000
Mr Sulu. Execute.
Aye, sir.

461
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,200
<i>Paradise City.
This is Starship Enterprise.</i>

462
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,800
A Federation starship.

463
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,500
<i>This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking.</i>

464
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,800
<i>You are in violation
of Neutral Zone Treaty.</i>

465
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,700
<i>I advise you to release your hostages at once,</i>

466
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,100
<i>or suffer the consequences.</i>

467
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,900
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov.

468
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,800
What consequences did you have in mind?

469
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,500
Go! Go! Go!

470
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,100
Even as we speak,
a Klingon warship is on its way.

471
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,200
We estimate arrival within the hour.

472
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,700
I imagine the Klingons will be quite angry.

473
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,600
<i>You are a master of understatement.
They are likely to destroy the planet.</i>

474
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,900
Then it's fortunate that I have you
and your starship to protect me.

475
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,900
In the meantime, Captain Chekov,
I instruct you and your first officer

476
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,300
to beam down to my coordinates.

477
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,300
<i>We will be happy to beam down.</i>

478
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,700
But first we must have certain assurances.

479
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,800
At foot speed, I estimate the journey
to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.

480
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,800
We don't have 1.2 hours.

481
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,400
Wait a minute. Perfect!

482
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,100
But we'll have to get their attention.

483
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,600
What?

484
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,900
What's that?

485
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,700
Damn!

486
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,100
Is she naked?

487
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,300
What?
Is she naked?

488
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,000
What is that?

489
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,500
Hello, boys.

490
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,700
I've always wanted to play
to a captive audience.

491
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,600
Oh, damn.

492
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,100
Spock.
Yes, Captain?

493
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,200
Be one with the horse.
Yes, Captain.

494
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,800
Open the gate. It's our lookout party.

495
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,900
Federation soldiers right behind us.
Close the gate!

496
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,300
Where are they going?

497
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,800
Spock.
Hold your horse, Captain. I'm scanning.

498
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,300
The hostages are being held
in that structure.

499
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,800
Galileo, this is Strike Team.
Start your run.

500
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,900
Who are you?
Phasers on stun. Get rid of the mounts.

501
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Sulu, take out that light.
Yes, Captain.

502
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,300
What's going on?

503
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,000
<i>I instruct you to surrender at once.</i>

504
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,400
<i>You are under attack
by superior Federation forces.</i>

505
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,800
Do you realise what you've done?
It wasn't bloodshed I wanted!

506
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,000
<i>Wait! Come back!</i>

507
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,400
Uhura, come on down.

508
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,200
Roger. Coming in.

509
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,900
Thank God.

510
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,000
Please cooperate.

511
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,800
Would you mind handing over
your weapons?

512
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,300
Well done, my friends.

513
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,800
Spock!

514
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,500
Spock.

515
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,000
It's me. It's Sybok.

516
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,800
After all these years,
you've finally caught up with me.

517
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,500
Don't you have anything to say to me?

518
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,300
You are under arrest

519
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,400
for seventeen violations
of the Neutral Zone Treaty.

520
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,000
Spock, you've developed
a sense of humour after all.

521
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,040
It was not my intention to amuse you.

522
00:44:56,064 --> 00:44:59,224
These are serious charges.

523
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,559
However, if you surrender now...

524
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:04,924
I'm sorry, Spock.
I can't surrender now.

525
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,100
I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty.

526
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
In fact, I'm just getting started.

527
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,800
And for my next violation,
I intend to steal something.

528
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,800
Something very big.

529
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,100
I must have your starship.

530
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,200
You staged all this
to get your hands on my ship?

531
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,000
Who are you?

532
00:45:33,225 --> 00:45:34,824
James T. Kirk,

533
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,675
Captain of the Enterprise.

534
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,424
But I thought Captain Chekov...

535
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,100
I see!

536
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,600
Very clever, Captain.

537
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,400
Spock, it would appear that you've been
given a second chance to join me.

538
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,200
What do you say?

539
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,103
I am a Starfleet officer.

540
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:56,224
Of course.

541
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,300
Of course.

542
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,900
Then I'll take the ship without your help.

543
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,000
Shuttle en route.

544
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,900
Position, bird-of-prey?

545
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,100
Closing.

546
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,900
Estimating attack range in 8,000 kellicams.

547
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:47,500
Stealth approach,
slow to one quarter impulse power.

548
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,000
Prepare to cloak.

549
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,500
Engage cloaking device.

550
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,800
Mr Chekov.

551
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,600
I've lost the bird-of-prey.
She must have cloaked.

552
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,800
Raise shields.
But the shuttle...

553
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,000
Do it. Go to red alert.

554
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,400
Once we've taken control of your vessel,
we'll bring up the rest of our followers.

555
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,300
The Klingons are out there.

556
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,200
We'll be lucky to get back
to the ship ourselves.

557
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,900
<i>Galileo, this is Enterprise.
Condition red alert.</i>

558
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,800
<i>Bird-of-prey approaching.
She is cloaked. Raising shields.</i>

559
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,200
Recommend Galileo find safe harbour
until situation secure.

560
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,000
<i>Acknowledge.</i>
No!

561
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,233
No reply.

562
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:49,324
Remain on course.

563
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,468
Sybok, listen to me.

564
00:47:52,493 --> 00:47:54,724
In order for this craft
to enter the landing bay,

565
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,400
Enterprise must lower the shields
and activate the tractor beam.

566
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,600
To get us inside
and re-raise the shields will take...

567
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,000
Exactly 15.5 seconds.

568
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,700
An eternity, during which we'll be
vulnerable to Klingon attack.

569
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,700
Korrd, you tell him.
He speaks the truth.

570
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,959
If my people are cloaked,

571
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:14,824
then they intend to strike.

572
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,800
We cannot turn back.

573
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,100
You must allow us to act.
Let me do something.

574
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,100
Very well.

575
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:25,554
Do what you must.

576
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:26,848
But no more.

577
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,468
Enterprise.

578
00:48:35,693 --> 00:48:36,924
<i>This is Kirk.</i>

579
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Kirk.

580
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,700
He's on the shuttlecraft!

581
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,600
Alter the attack course!

582
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,363
Understand your situation.

583
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:47,024
Are unable to return to planet.

584
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,269
Stand by to execute...

585
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,724
Emergency Landing Plan B.

586
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,330
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?

587
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:01,800
I don't have a clue.

588
00:49:01,824 --> 00:49:05,600
<i>B, as in barricade.</i>
He can't be serious.

589
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,900
What are you doing?

590
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,500
In order to lower and raise the shields
as quickly as possible,

591
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,238
we're going to forego the tractor beam,

592
00:49:17,863 --> 00:49:19,324
and fly her in manually.

593
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,375
Manually?

594
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,124
How often have you done this?

595
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,500
Actually, it's my first attempt.

596
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,700
He's good.

597
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,800
Really.

598
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,400
Scotty, on my mark, open bay doors.

599
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,500
Stand by to de-cloak for firing.

600
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,000
Kirk to Scotty. Lower shields.

601
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,700
Lowering shields, sir.

602
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,000
Bird-of-prey bearing 1.0.5 mark 2.

603
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,500
Go, Sulu!

604
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,100
They're in!

605
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,900
Bear on Enterprise.

606
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,400
Enterprise targeted!

607
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,400
Warp speed now.

608
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,900
Firing!

609
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,600
Track her course!

610
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,700
He's good.

611
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,700
We must change course at once.

612
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,200
I'll take you to the Bridge.

613
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,000
Pick it up.

614
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,500
Sybok.

615
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,000
You must surrender.

616
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,600
No.

617
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,193
You must kill me.

618
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,024
Shoot him!

619
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,018
For a moment,

620
00:52:57,343 --> 00:53:00,024
I thought you might actually do it.

621
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,800
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.

622
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,100
Spock.

623
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,200
You will accompany me to the Bridge?

624
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,100
No.

625
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,900
I will not.

626
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,500
You know I'm right.

627
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,300
Then you must join them.

628
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,800
Move. Move!

629
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,800
These two will be useful.
Give us a moment alone.

630
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,600
Don't be afraid.

631
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,600
Damn it, Spock. God damn it!
Captain, what I have done...

632
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,400
What you have done
is betray every man on this ship.

633
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,800
Worse. I have betrayed you.
I do not expect you to forgive me.

634
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,900
Forgive you? I ought to knock you
on your goddamn ass.

635
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,600
If you think it would help.

636
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,300
You want me to hold him, Jim?
You stay out of this.

637
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,682
Why, Spock? Why?

638
00:54:40,707 --> 00:54:43,124
I... All you had to do was pull the trigger.

639
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,600
If I had pulled the trigger,
Sybok would be dead.

640
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,450
I ordered you to defend your ship.

641
00:54:47,475 --> 00:54:49,224
You ordered me to kill my brother.

642
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,200
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan,
but that doesn't...

643
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,200
No, no, no, Captain.
You do not understand.

644
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,600
Sybok also is a son of Sarek.

645
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,100
You mean he's your "brother" brother?

646
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,290
You made that up.

647
00:55:01,515 --> 00:55:02,424
I did not.

648
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,500
You did, too.
Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother

649
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,800
because I happen to know for a fact
you don't have a brother.

650
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,500
Technically you are correct.
I do not have a brother.

651
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,600
There, you see? See?
I have a half-brother.

652
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,400
I gotta sit down.

653
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,300
Let me get this straight.

654
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,100
You and Sybok have the same father
but different mothers.

655
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,623
Exactly. That is correct.

656
00:55:24,748 --> 00:55:27,024
Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess.

657
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,600
Upon her death,
Sybok and I were raised as brothers.

658
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,200
Why didn't you tell us this before?

659
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,200
I was not disposed to discuss matters
of a personal nature.

660
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,200
For that, I am sorry.

661
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,700
He's sorry. See? He's sorry.
That makes everything all right.

662
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,300
He's sorry. Everything...
Stop it, Jim!

663
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,600
Spock could no more kill
his own brother than he could kill you.

664
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,200
If you want to punish him
for what he's done,

665
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,800
why don't you throw him in the brig?

666
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,800
Besides, we've got
bigger problems to deal with.

667
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,900
Like how the hell to get out of here.

668
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,700
I'll say one thing, Spock.

669
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,000
You never cease to amaze me.
Nor I myself.

670
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,100
I was beginning to worry.
Where is the captain?

671
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,600
It's all right, Pavel.
Sybok will explain everything.

672
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,818
Sulu, what are you doing?

673
00:56:17,843 --> 00:56:19,424
Plotting our new course.

674
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,900
New course? You have no authority.

675
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,100
What's going on here?

676
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,500
Pavel...
I won't force you.

677
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,400
You've got to listen to this man.
The decision must be yours.

678
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,100
I don't understand.
Each of us hides a secret pain.

679
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,600
Share yours with me
and gain strength from the sharing.

680
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,600
Useless.

681
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,900
Unwise.

682
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,016
You could've warned me.

683
00:57:18,241 --> 00:57:19,324
He did, Jim.

684
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,900
There's got to be a way out of this place.

685
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,700
This is a new brig, Captain.
It is escape-proof.

686
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,876
How do you know?

687
00:57:26,001 --> 00:57:27,324
The designers tested it

688
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,500
using the most intelligent
and resourceful person they could find.

689
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,400
He failed to escape.

690
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,400
This person didn't by any chance
have pointed ears

691
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:41,400
and an unerring capacity for getting
his shipmates into trouble, did he?

692
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,300
He did have pointed ears.

693
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,700
Following new course. Warp 7.

694
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,200
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours,
present speed.

695
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,300
Now that we're under way,

696
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,500
it's time I announced my intentions
to the rest of the ship.

697
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,200
<i>Brave crew of the Starship Enterprise,</i>

698
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,900
<i>consider the questions of existence.</i>

699
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,600
These are the questions
which man has asked

700
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,900
ever since he first gazed at the stars
and dreamed.

701
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,800
<i>My Vulcan ancestors were ruled
by their emotions.</i>

702
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,767
They felt with their hearts.

703
00:58:26,492 --> 00:58:29,124
<i>They made love with their hearts.</i>

704
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,800
<i>They believed with their hearts.</i>

705
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,800
But above all else,
they believed in a place

706
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,600
in which these questions of existence
would be answered.

707
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,800
Modern dogma tells us
this place is a myth,

708
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,700
a fantasy concocted by pagans.

709
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,300
<i>It is no fantasy, I tell you.</i>

710
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,200
<i>I tell you</i>

711
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,200
<i>it exists.</i>

712
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,800
My brothers, we have been chosen,

713
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:02,966
to undertake,

714
00:59:02,991 --> 00:59:06,024
the greatest adventure of all time.

715
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,100
The discovery of Sha'Ka'Ree.

716
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,100
Is it possible?
Is what possible?

717
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,748
That he's found Sha'Ka'Ree.

718
00:59:16,273 --> 00:59:18,224
The reason Sybok left Vulcan.

719
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,300
Our destination is the planet Sha'Ka'Ree,

720
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,800
which lies beyond the Great Barrier

721
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,200
<i>at the centre of the galaxy.</i>

722
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,200
The centre of the galaxy?
Where Sha'Ka'Ree is fabled to exist.

723
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,200
But the centre of the galaxy
can't be reached.

724
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,000
No ship has ever gone
into the Great Barrier.

725
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,600
No probe has ever returned.

726
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,200
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect
I have ever known.

727
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,000
Spock, my only concern
is getting the ship back.

728
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,400
When that's done and Sybok is in here,

729
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,900
then you can debate Sha'Ka'Ree
until you're green in the face.

730
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,400
Until then, you're either with me
or you're not.

731
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,930
I am here, Captain.

732
00:59:58,155 --> 00:59:59,524
That's a little vague, Spock.

733
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,200
What's that noise?

734
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,700
I believe it is a primitive form
of communication

735
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,700
known as Morse code.
You're right.

736
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,180
I'm a little out of practise.

737
01:00:15,505 --> 01:00:16,524
That's an S.

738
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:17,900
T

739
01:00:18,725 --> 01:00:19,525
A

740
01:00:20,176 --> 01:00:20,876
N

741
01:00:22,137 --> 01:00:23,448
D, end of word.

742
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,968
Stand.
New word...

743
01:00:25,393 --> 01:00:26,093
B

744
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,731
A

745
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:30,800
C

746
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:32,624
K

747
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,800
Back. Stand back?

748
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,200
Stand back?
Stand back?

749
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,900
What are you standing around for?

750
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,100
Do you not know a jail break
when you see one?

751
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,100
The bond between these three
is strong, difficult to penetrate.

752
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,100
This will be quite a challenge.

753
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,600
We've got to find them.

754
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,800
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
If we could send a distress signal...

755
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,400
There is an emergency
sending apparatus

756
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,400
in the forward observation room.

757
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,900
The only trouble is, it's up there.
We're down here.

758
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
You might be able to reach it by means
of turbo shaft number three,

759
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:11,000
which is closed for repairs.
It's a long and dangerous climb.

760
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,600
Some of us get off
on long and dangerous climbs.

761
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,500
Mr Scott, get the transporter working.

762
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,600
If we can contact a rescue ship,
we'll need it.

763
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,900
Which way to the turbo shaft?

764
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,600
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent
and turn right.

765
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,700
Then left at the blowscreen.
You can't miss it.

766
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,925
Mr Scott, you're amazing.

767
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,524
There's nothing amazing about it.

768
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,700
I know this ship
like the back of my hand.

769
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,000
All right.

770
01:01:40,225 --> 01:01:42,424
Look at it this way,
we'll get a good workout.

771
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,900
Yeah, or a heart attack.

772
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,700
Get Mr Scott to sickbay.

773
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,200
Jim, this is going to take me forever.

774
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,900
Where's Spock?

775
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,000
I believe I have found a faster way.

776
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,200
Bones?

777
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,700
You two go ahead.
I'll wait for the next car.

778
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,500
We're not splitting up.

779
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,200
It appears we're too heavy.
Must be all those marsh melons.

780
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,200
Spock, the booster rockets.

781
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,700
If I activate them now, Captain,
we'll be propelled upward

782
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,200
at an unbelievable rate.

783
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,900
Fire the rockets!

784
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,300
Captain, please come back down...

785
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,500
Hit the brakes!

786
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,600
I'm afraid I overshot the mark
by one level.

787
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,300
Nobody's perfect.

788
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,700
Spock.

789
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,600
Emergency channel open.

790
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,700
To anyone within the sound of my voice,

791
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,000
this is Captain James T. Kirk
of the Federation Starship Enterprise.

792
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,800
If you read me, acknowledge.

793
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,900
Acknowledge.

794
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:25,200
<i>Enterprise, this is Starfleet Command.
We read you. Over.</i>

795
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,400
A hostile force has taken control
of our vessel

796
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,000
and put us on a direct course
with the Great Barrier.

797
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,700
Our coordinates are 0-0-0...

798
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,700
Mark 2.
mark 2.

799
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,500
Request emergency assistance.
Acknowledge.

800
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,500
Understood, Enterprise. We are
dispatching a rescue ship immediately.

801
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,700
Roger, Starfleet.

802
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,400
Plot course zero-zero-zero, mark two.

803
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:54,300
But Captain, that course will take us
into the Barrier as well.

804
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,100
Where Kirk goes, we follow.

805
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,600
I trust your message was received.

806
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,300
You can't expect us to stand by while
you take the ship into the Great Barrier.

807
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,800
What you fear...

808
01:05:08,025 --> 01:05:09,624
is the unknown.

809
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,333
The people of your planet,

810
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:15,824
once believed their world was flat.

811
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,400
Columbus proved it was round.

812
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,025
They said the sound barrier
could never be broken.

813
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:24,624
It was broken.

814
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,047
They said warp speed,

815
01:05:27,272 --> 01:05:28,924
could not be achieved.

816
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:35,300
The Great Barrier is the ultimate
expression of this universal fear.

817
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,900
It's an extension of personal fear.

818
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,000
Captain Kirk, I so much want
your understanding.

819
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,438
I want your respect.

820
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:48,024
Are you afraid to hear me out?

821
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,200
I'm afraid of nothing.

822
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,500
Wait outside.

823
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,300
I'm sure you have many questions.

824
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:09,000
Here, amidst the stars of our own galaxy,

825
01:06:09,024 --> 01:06:12,300
we shall seek the answers together.

826
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,808
Easy. Easy. Easy, Scotty. Easy.

827
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:25,624
You're back with us.

828
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,300
Uhura, I had the strangest dream.

829
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,600
I dreamt that a madman
had taken over the Enterprise.

830
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:33,000
Scotty, dear, he's not a madman.

831
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,800
He's not?
No.

832
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,297
Sybok has simply put us,

833
01:06:37,422 --> 01:06:41,500
in touch with feelings that we've
always been afraid to express.

834
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,578
I have to get back to the transporter.

835
01:06:43,703 --> 01:06:45,400
No, no, no. Scotty! Scotty.

836
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,300
There's so much I want to tell you.

837
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,200
Maybe you could wait
till I'm a wee bit stronger.

838
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,300
I don't think I could take it
in my present condition.

839
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,100
Or yours.

840
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,900
Sha'Ka'Ree.

841
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,700
The Source.

842
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,400
Heaven.

843
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,200
Eden.

844
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,400
Call it what you will.
The Klingons call it Qui'Tu.

845
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,169
For the Romulans, it's Vorta Vor.

846
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:19,824
The Andorian word is...

847
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,100
ls unpronounceable.

848
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,900
Still, every culture in existence
shares this common dream of a place,

849
01:07:26,225 --> 01:07:27,668
from which creation sprang.

850
01:07:27,693 --> 01:07:29,023
For us that place,

851
01:07:29,248 --> 01:07:30,872
will soon be reality.

852
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,900
The only reality I see is that
I'm a prisoner on my own ship.

853
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,350
What is this,

854
01:07:36,975 --> 01:07:39,424
power you have to control
the minds of my crew?

855
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,700
I don't control minds.

856
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:43,624
I free them.

857
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,400
How?

858
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,281
By making you face your pain,

859
01:07:52,706 --> 01:07:54,224
and draw strength from it.

860
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,500
Once that's done, fear cannot stop you.

861
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,529
Sounds like...

862
01:08:07,754 --> 01:08:09,624
brainwashing to me.

863
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,000
Your pain is the deepest of all.
What?

864
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,400
I can feel it. Can't you?

865
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,400
Leonard.

866
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,800
It's some kind of trick.

867
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,900
Leonard.

868
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,100
Father?

869
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,000
Oh, my God, don't do this to me.

870
01:08:42,424 --> 01:08:43,624
Leonard.

871
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,061
I'm here.

872
01:08:57,286 --> 01:08:59,224
I'm with you, Dad.

873
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:01,900
The pain.

874
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:04,900
Stop the pain.

875
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,500
I've done everything I can do.

876
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,600
You've got to hang on.

877
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,400
I can't stand the pain.

878
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,900
Help me.

879
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,200
All my knowledge, and I can't save him.

880
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,777
You've done all you can.

881
01:09:24,402 --> 01:09:26,424
The support system will keep him alive.

882
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,400
You call this alive?

883
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,300
Son,

884
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,200
release me.
I can't do that, Dad.

885
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,500
But how?
How can I watch him suffer like this?

886
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,400
You're a doctor.

887
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,500
I'm his son.

888
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,600
Why did you do it?

889
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,400
To preserve his dignity.

890
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,200
That wasn't the worst of it.

891
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,300
No.
Was it?

892
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,700
No!
Share it.

893
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,157
Not long after, they found a cure.

894
01:11:28,682 --> 01:11:29,724
A goddamn cure!

895
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,300
So if you hadn't killed him,
he might have lived.

896
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,921
No! I loved my father.

897
01:11:33,046 --> 01:11:34,124
I released him!

898
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,700
Then you did what you thought was right.

899
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,700
Yes. No! Yes!

900
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,600
Release this pain. Release it!

901
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,900
This pain has poisoned your soul
for a long time.

902
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,300
Now you've taken the first step.

903
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,500
The other steps we'll take together.

904
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,900
Each man's pain is unique.

905
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,900
I hide no pain.

906
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,800
I know you better than that.
Do you?

907
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,600
Spock, don't.
It's all right, Captain.

908
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:21,000
Proceed.

909
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:27,875
What is this?

910
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,524
I believe we are witnessing my birth.

911
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,300
Sarek, your son.

912
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,900
So human.

913
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,800
Spock?

914
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,800
What have you done to my friends?
I've done nothing.

915
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,436
This is who they are.

916
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:48,424
Didn't you know that?

917
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,600
No, I didn't.

918
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,200
Now learn something about yourself.
No. I refuse.

919
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:59,300
Jim, try to be open about this.
About what?

920
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:03,600
That I've made
the wrong choices in my life?

921
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,100
That I turned left
when I should have turned right?

922
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,600
I know what my weaknesses are.

923
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,500
I don't need Sybok to take me
on a tour of them.

924
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,300
If you'd just unbend and allow yourself...

925
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,057
And be brainwashed by this con man?

926
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:14,224
I was wrong.

927
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:18,300
This con man took away my pain.
Damn it, Bones, you're a doctor.

928
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,900
You know that pain and guilt
can't be taken away

929
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,300
with the wave of a magic wand.

930
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,400
They're the things we carry with us,
the things that make us who we are.

931
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,700
If we lose them, we lose ourselves.

932
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,400
I don't want my pain taken away.
I need my pain!

933
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:35,200
<i>Sybok, this is the Bridge.
We're in approach of the Great Barrier.</i>

934
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,200
Captain, I'm afraid
you'll have to remain here.

935
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,800
Spock, Dr McCoy, come with me.

936
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:44,975
Spock?

937
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,624
I cannot go with you.

938
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,200
Why not?

939
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:51,124
I belong here.

940
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,800
I don't understand.

941
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,325
Sybok,

942
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:58,124
you are my brother,
but you do not know me.

943
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:03,000
I am not the outcast boy
you left behind those many years ago.

944
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,615
Since that time,

945
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,724
I have found myself,
and my place.

946
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,526
I know who I am.

947
01:15:10,051 --> 01:15:11,624
And I cannot go with you.

948
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,300
I guess you'd better count me out, too.

949
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:27,000
Then I'll see you on the other side.
Wait!

950
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,800
You know we'll never make it
through the Great Barrier.

951
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,475
But if we do,

952
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,224
will that convince you
that my vision was true?

953
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,518
Your vision?

954
01:15:39,543 --> 01:15:41,324
Given to me by God.

955
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,300
He waits for us on the other side.

956
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,100
You are mad.

957
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,200
Am I?

958
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,200
We'll see.

959
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,700
They say no ship can survive this.

960
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,500
I say they're wrong.
I say that danger is an illusion.

961
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,600
We have no instrument readings.

962
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,474
Is it there or isn't it?

963
01:16:33,499 --> 01:16:35,124
Mr Sulu, full ahead.

964
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,600
Full ahead. Aye.

965
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,400
Is it possible?

966
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,000
Fascinating.

967
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:43,800
Are we dreaming?

968
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,900
If we are, then life is a dream.

969
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:20,000
Instruments back online.

970
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,250
Incredible.

971
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:26,724
There is a power source
emanating from the planet,

972
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,800
like nothing I have ever seen.

973
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:35,900
Sha'Ka'Ree.

974
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,700
Qui'Tu.

975
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,500
Vorta Vor.

976
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,700
Eden.

977
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,500
About the ship...

978
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,800
The ship needs its captain.
No special conditions?

979
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,000
No conditions.

980
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,900
What makes you think
I won't turn us around?

981
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,200
Because you, too, must know.

982
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,500
Well, if we're going to do it,
we're going to do it by the book.

983
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,700
Mr Chekov, you take the conn.
Mr Sulu, standard orbital approach.

984
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,700
Uhura, alert the shuttlecraft to stand by.

985
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,900
Sybok, Spock, Dr McCoy,
come with me.

986
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,900
The rest of you remain on board

987
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,500
until I've determined
what it is we're dealing with.

988
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,900
Well, don't just stand there.
God's a busy man.

989
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,600
I am no longer in control of the craft.

990
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,424
All right.

991
01:21:09,349 --> 01:21:10,724
We'll play it your way.

992
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,600
Amazing.

993
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,800
The land. The sky.

994
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,800
Just as I knew it would be.

995
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:38,600
Scotty, you gotta see this.

996
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:40,400
I don't have the time.

997
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,900
The Captain told me
to get this transporter working,

998
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,100
and I'm not about to let him down.

999
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,900
We have travelled far...

1000
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,500
by starship.

1001
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,000
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

1002
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,900
We have a...

1003
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,400
Sybok.

1004
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,600
Perhaps...

1005
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:22,300
<i>Brave souls, welcome.</i>

1006
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,400
Is this the voice of God?

1007
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:36,500
<i>One voice, many faces.</i>

1008
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:52,400
<i>Does this better suit your expectations?</i>

1009
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,200
<i>It is I.</i>

1010
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,300
<i>The journey you undertook to reach me
could not have been an easy one.</i>

1011
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,800
It was not. The Barrier stood
between us, but we breached it.

1012
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,200
<i>Magnificent.</i>

1013
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,300
<i>You are the first to find me.</i>

1014
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,700
We sought only your infinite wisdom.

1015
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:33,000
<i>And how did you breach the Barrier?</i>

1016
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:34,700
With a starship.

1017
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,500
<i>This starship,</i>

1018
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:43,000
<i>could it carry my wisdom
beyond the Barrier?</i>

1019
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,600
It could. Yes.

1020
01:28:45,624 --> 01:28:48,300
<i>Then I shall make use of this starship.</i>

1021
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,400
It will be your chariot!

1022
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:52,300
Excuse me.

1023
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:56,200
<i>It will carry my power
to every corner of creation.</i>

1024
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:59,400
Excuse me.
I'd just like to ask a question.

1025
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,400
What does God need with a starship?

1026
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,300
<i>Bring the ship closer.</i>

1027
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:11,100
I said, what does God need
with a starship?

1028
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,800
Jim, what are you doing?
I'm asking a question.

1029
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,466
<i>Who is this creature?</i>

1030
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:18,924
Who am I?

1031
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,378
Don't you know? Aren't you God?

1032
01:29:21,502 --> 01:29:22,232
He...

1033
01:29:22,757 --> 01:29:24,147
has his doubts.

1034
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,900
<i>You doubt me?</i>

1035
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,600
I seek proof.

1036
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Jim, you don't ask the Almighty
for his ID.

1037
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:36,100
<i>Then here is the proof you seek.</i>

1038
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,996
Why is God angry?

1039
01:29:50,321 --> 01:29:51,024
Why?

1040
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:53,439
Why have you done this to my friend?

1041
01:29:53,463 --> 01:29:55,324
<i>He doubts me.</i>

1042
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,000
You have not answered his question.

1043
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,224
What does God need with a starship?

1044
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,200
<i>Do you doubt me?</i>

1045
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,586
I doubt any God who...

1046
01:30:19,511 --> 01:30:21,057
inflicts pain...

1047
01:30:21,883 --> 01:30:23,548
for his own pleasure.

1048
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:27,800
Stop! The God of Sha'Ka'Ree
would not do this.

1049
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,700
<i>Sha'Ka'Ree?</i>

1050
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,000
<i>A vision you created.</i>

1051
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:41,700
<i>An eternity I've been imprisoned
in this place.</i>

1052
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,200
<i>The ship.</i>

1053
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,800
<i>I must have the ship.</i>

1054
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:53,600
<i>Now, give me what I want.</i>

1055
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:54,725
Sybok,

1056
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:57,524
this is not the God of Sha'Ka'Ree,

1057
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,300
or any other God.

1058
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,035
I don't understand.

1059
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:04,324
Reveal yourself to me.

1060
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:15,843
<i>What's wrong?
Don't you like this face?</i>

1061
01:31:16,968 --> 01:31:18,424
<i>I have so many.</i>

1062
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:21,100
<i>But this one suits you best.</i>

1063
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:24,500
No, no, it's not possible.

1064
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,800
<i>Bring me the ship or I will destroy you.</i>

1065
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,033
The ship.

1066
01:31:30,358 --> 01:31:33,024
<i>Bring it closer,</i>

1067
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:38,000
<i>so that I might join with it.</i>

1068
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,100
<i>Do it,</i>

1069
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:48,700
<i>or watch these puny things die horribly.</i>

1070
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,300
What have I done?
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully.

1071
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,000
Spock.
Sybok.

1072
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,200
This is my doing.

1073
01:32:00,225 --> 01:32:02,424
This is my arrogance, my vanity.

1074
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,144
Sybok, we must find a way...
No!

1075
01:32:04,169 --> 01:32:05,624
You must save yourselves.

1076
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,500
Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.

1077
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,300
I couldn't help but notice your pain.
My pain?

1078
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,700
It runs deep. Share it with me.

1079
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:25,900
Enterprise, are you ready?

1080
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,200
In firing position. Torpedo armed.

1081
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,400
But, Captain, we're firing directly
on your position.

1082
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,100
Send it down, Mr Chekov. Now!

1083
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,800
Run! Go!

1084
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:02,500
Sybok.

1085
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,800
Let's get out of here.

1086
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,700
Sulu, I've lost them.

1087
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,600
Spock, get us out of here.

1088
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,700
Thrusters are inoperative.

1089
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,268
Mr Scott.

1090
01:34:15,693 --> 01:34:16,924
<i>Scotty here, sir.</i>

1091
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,400
Please tell me
the transporter is working.

1092
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:22,500
She's got partial power, sir.
I might be able to take two of you.

1093
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,800
Beam up Spock and Dr McCoy. Now.

1094
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,000
Now, just a damn minute.

1095
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,600
Thank you, Mr Scott.
Bring up the Captain.

1096
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:34,800
All right.

1097
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,500
What about Jim?
We can't just leave him down there.

1098
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,100
Please get a grip on yourself, Doctor.
Status report.

1099
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:08,100
Klingon captain wishes
to name his terms, Mr Spock.

1100
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:09,600
On screen.

1101
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,600
<i>This is Captain KIaa
of the KIingon Empire.</i>

1102
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:17,000
<i>Attempt to raise shields
or arm weapons,</i>

1103
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,400
<i>and I will destroy you.</i>

1104
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,900
<i>You are alive for a single reason.</i>

1105
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,000
<i>The renegade James T. Kirk.</i>

1106
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:28,700
<i>Hand him over,
and I will spare your lives.</i>

1107
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,800
<i>My transporter stands ready
to beam him aboard.</i>

1108
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,954
Captain Kirk is not among us.

1109
01:35:35,579 --> 01:35:36,624
<i>You lie.</i>

1110
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:40,081
I'm a Vulcan.
I'm incapable of lying.

1111
01:35:40,306 --> 01:35:42,024
Captain Kirk is on the planet below.

1112
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,000
<i>Then give me his coordinates!</i>

1113
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,900
General, I am in need of your assistance.

1114
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:54,800
My assistance?

1115
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,200
You are his superior officer.

1116
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,726
I am a foolish old man.

1117
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:01,087
Damn you, sir.

1118
01:36:01,312 --> 01:36:02,848
You will try.

1119
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,000
<i>Klingon Commander,
someone wishes to speak with you.</i>

1120
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,300
So it's me you want,
you Klingon bastards.

1121
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,800
What are you waiting for?

1122
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,900
Release him!

1123
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:39,800
Kirk, my junior officer has something
he wants to say to you.

1124
01:37:40,424 --> 01:37:41,924
Speak now!

1125
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:46,813
I...

1126
01:37:48,338 --> 01:37:49,824
apologise.

1127
01:37:52,148 --> 01:37:53,448
Say...

1128
01:37:54,372 --> 01:37:55,372
more.

1129
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:00,500
The attack upon your vessel
was not authorised by my government.

1130
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:04,500
Kirk,

1131
01:38:05,224 --> 01:38:06,299
and now,

1132
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:10,200
may I present our new gunner?

1133
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,600
Spock?

1134
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:24,900
Welcome aboard, Captain.

1135
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:33,291
I...

1136
01:38:34,016 --> 01:38:35,864
thought I was going to die.

1137
01:38:35,989 --> 01:38:37,324
Not possible.

1138
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:39,200
You were never alone.

1139
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:46,189
Please, Captain,

1140
01:38:46,814 --> 01:38:48,524
not in front of the Klingons.

1141
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:12,600
Would you care for a wee nip
of Scotch whisky?

1142
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:18,500
I never thought I'd ever be drinking
with a Klingon.

1143
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:21,000
What are you two conspiring about?

1144
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:24,500
We were just saying how far we've
come in such a short space of time.

1145
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,500
We certainly have.

1146
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:32,900
She has wonderful muscles.

1147
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,500
Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?

1148
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:55,724
We were speculating.

1149
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,400
Is God really out there?

1150
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,300
Maybe he's not out there, Bones.

1151
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,600
Maybe he's right here.
Human heart.

1152
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,125
Spock?

1153
01:40:14,950 --> 01:40:16,624
I was thinking of Sybok.

1154
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:19,600
I've lost a brother.

1155
01:40:20,825 --> 01:40:21,624
Yes.

1156
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:26,800
I lost a brother once.

1157
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,400
I was lucky. I got him back.

1158
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:38,200
I thought you said
men like us don't have families.

1159
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:43,400
I was wrong.

1160
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,700
Are you just gonna sit there
and pluck that thing,

1161
01:41:05,724 --> 01:41:06,900
or are you gonna play something?
