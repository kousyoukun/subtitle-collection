1
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:48,962
l thought weapons were forbidden
on this planet.

2
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:57,429
Besides,

3
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:01,766
l can't believe you'd kill me

4
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,644
for a field of empty holes.

5
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:08,648
All I have.

6
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,925
Your pain runs deep.

7
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:40,305
-What do you know of my pain?
-Let us explore it together.

8
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:44,225
Each man hides a secret pain.

9
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:48,271
lt must be exposed and reckoned with.

10
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:53,485
lt must be dragged from the darkness
and forced into the light.

11
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:57,989
Share your pain.
Share your pain with me.

12
00:02:58,783 --> 00:03:01,326
And gain strength from the sharing.

13
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:23,390
Where did you get this power?

14
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:29,896
The power was within you.

15
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,821
l feel as if a weight has been lifted
from my heart.

16
00:03:39,573 --> 00:03:42,450
How can I repay you for this miracle?

17
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:45,662
-Join my quest.
-What is it you seek?

18
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:49,416
What you seek.

19
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:56,089
What all men have sought
since time began.

20
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:00,760
The ultimate knowledge.

21
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:05,682
To find it, we'll need a starship.

22
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:09,644
A starship?
There are no starships on Nimbus lll.

23
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:12,856
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.

24
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,899
But how?

25
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:22,907
Have faith, my friend.
There are more of us than you know.

26
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:25,618
You're a Vulcan.

27
00:08:56,181 --> 00:09:00,101
"You'll have a great time, Bones.
You'll enjoy your shore leave.

28
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:02,186
"You'll be able to relax."

29
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:06,816
You call this relaxing?
l'm a nervous wreck.

30
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:11,821
lf l'm not careful, I'll end up talking
to myself.

31
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:29,172
Greetings, Captain.

32
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:34,093
Spock! What are you doing
in this neck of the woods?

33
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,930
-l have been monitoring your progress.
-l'm flattered.

34
00:09:38,182 --> 00:09:41,684
Twelve hundred points of interest
in Yosemite and you pick me.

35
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:45,313
l regret to inform you that the record
for free-climbing El Capitan

36
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:47,690
is in no danger of being broken.

37
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,652
l'm not trying to break any records.
l'm doing this 'cause I enjoy it.

38
00:09:51,737 --> 00:09:55,365
Not to mention the most important
reason for climbing a mountain.

39
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:56,783
And that is?

40
00:09:57,743 --> 00:09:58,951
Because it's there.

41
00:09:59,286 --> 00:10:00,453
Captain?

42
00:10:00,954 --> 00:10:04,499
l do not think you realise the gravity
of your situation.

43
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:11,839
On the contrary.
Gravity is foremost on my mind.

44
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:14,634
Look, l'm trying to make an ascent here.

45
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:16,803
Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy
for a while?

46
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:22,100
l believe that Dr McCoy
is not in the best of moods.

47
00:10:22,893 --> 00:10:25,478
Goddamn irresponsible. . .

48
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:30,066
Playing games with life.

49
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:34,278
Concentration is vital.
You must be one with the rock.

50
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:36,906
Spock, I appreciate your concern,
but if you don't stop distracting me,

51
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,324
l'm liable to be one to

52
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:41,035
fall !

53
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,833
Oh, my God.

54
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:05,059
Perhaps "because it is there"

55
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:07,061
is not sufficient reason
for climbing the mountain.

56
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:09,730
l'm hardly in a position to disagree.

57
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:14,819
Hi, Bones. Mind if we drop in for dinner?

58
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:09,957
Your dream can become a reaIity.
The Paradise Inn.

59
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,502
We have spared no expense
to create the cIosest thing to paradise

60
00:12:12,586 --> 00:12:14,754
in paradise... City, that is.

61
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:22,136
Gentlemen, l'm Caithlin Dar.

62
00:12:22,554 --> 00:12:23,638
Oh, yeah.

63
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:27,934
Our new Romulan representative.

64
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:31,020
Welcome to Paradise City, my dear,

65
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:34,398
capital of the so-called
planet of galactic peace.

66
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:37,818
l'm St John Talbot,
the Federation representative

67
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:39,612
here on Nimbus lll.

68
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:43,950
My charming companion here is
the Klingon consul, Korrd.

69
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:50,414
l expect that's Klingon for "Hello."

70
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,667
Won't you come in, my dear?

71
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:12,478
Twenty years ago,
our three governments agreed

72
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:14,897
to develop this planet together.

73
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:20,444
-A new age was born.
-Our new age died a quick death.

74
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:23,197
And the settlers we conned
into coming here,

75
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:25,032
they were the dregs of the galaxy.

76
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:27,159
lmmediately took
to fighting amongst themselves.

77
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:29,036
We forbad them weapons,

78
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:31,581
and they soon began to fashion
their own.

79
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:34,750
Well, then it appears l've arrived
just in time.

80
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:28,346
We have spared no expense
to create the cIosest thing to...

81
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:36,395
Get away from that transmitter!

82
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:45,404
Romulan.

83
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:48,908
Terran.

84
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:51,994
Klingon.

85
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,872
Consider yourselves my prisoners.

86
00:14:55,332 --> 00:15:00,711
Prisoners? We're already prisoners
here on this worthless lump of rock.

87
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,423
What possible value
could we be to you?

88
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:06,842
Nimbus lll may be a worthless
lump of rock,

89
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:09,053
but it does have one unique treasure.

90
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:13,099
lt's the only place in the entire galaxy
that has the three of you.

91
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:16,686
l don't know who you are,
or what you want, but I can tell you this.

92
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,689
Our governments will stop at nothing
to ensure our safety.

93
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:22,274
That's exactly what l'm counting on.

94
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:36,872
U.S.S. Enterprise,
shakedown cruise report.

95
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:40,042
I think this new ship was put together
by monkeys.

96
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:44,004
Oh, she's got a fine engine,
but haIf the doors won't open.

97
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:46,966
And guess whose job it is
to make it right?

98
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:49,802
Borgus Frat.

99
00:15:52,264 --> 00:15:54,557
"Let's see what she's got,"
said the Captain.

100
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:56,350
And then we found out, didn't we?

101
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:58,978
l know you'll whip her into shape,
Scotty. You always do.

102
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:01,021
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.

103
00:16:01,106 --> 00:16:03,482
And I thought we were supposed to be
going together.

104
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:07,153
Oh, I cannot leave her now
when she needs me the most.

105
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:12,158
l had a feeling
you would say something like that.

106
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:14,660
So I brought us dinner.

107
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:20,249
Oh, lassie, you're the most
understanding woman I know.

108
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:24,336
Red... Red... Red aIert.

109
00:16:25,297 --> 00:16:28,048
-Red aIert.
-l just fixed that damn thing.

110
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:31,677
-Red... Red... Red aIert.
-Turn it off, will you?

111
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:38,517
Red aIert. Red aIert. This is a red aIert.
Enterprise acknowledge.

112
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,107
This is Enterprise. ldentify yourself.

113
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:47,151
Enterprise, this is Starfleet.

114
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:50,613
We have a priority seven situation
in the NeutraI Zone.

115
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:51,989
Stand by, Starfleet.

116
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:55,201
-Scotty, this is for real.
-They can't be serious.

117
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:59,580
The ship's in pieces and we've got less
than a skeleton crew aboard.

118
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,460
Starfleet, are you aware
of our current status?

119
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:06,212
Current status understood.

120
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:10,132
Stand by to copy operationaI orders
and recaII key personneI.

121
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:13,427
Admit it. We're lost.

122
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:16,722
All right, we're lost.
But we're making good time.

123
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:20,518
-Commander SuIu, come in, pIease.
-l don't believe this.

124
00:17:21,186 --> 00:17:22,311
Commander Sulu here.

125
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:24,647
Bad news, gentlemen.
Shore leave's been cancelled.

126
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:26,440
Rescued at last!

127
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:29,443
Return to prearranged coordinates
for pickup.

128
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:33,113
Don't tell them you're lost.
You'll never live it down.

129
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:35,783
ls there a problem, gentlemen?

130
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:39,662
Yes, we've been caught in a. . .

131
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:42,581
We've been caught in a blizzard.

132
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,044
And we can't see a thing.

133
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:49,880
Request you direct us
to the coordinates.

134
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:51,841
My visuaI says

135
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:55,094
sunny skies and 70 degrees.

136
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:01,308
Sulu, look. The sun's come out.
lt's a miracle.

137
00:18:02,435 --> 00:18:04,854
Don't worry, feIIas.
Your secret's safe with me.

138
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:06,730
I'II send the shuttIecraft to pick you up.

139
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:09,608
Uhura, I owe you one. Sulu out.

140
00:18:11,278 --> 00:18:14,113
Come and get it! Come and get it!

141
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:18,367
Knock it. . . Bones! Bones,
knock it off! We're right here.

142
00:18:18,743 --> 00:18:20,452
And we're starving.

143
00:18:20,537 --> 00:18:21,871
Bipodal seeds, Doctor?

144
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:25,165
Beans, Spock. But no ordinary beans.

145
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,545
These are from an old Southern recipe
handed down to me by my father.

146
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:32,840
And if you stick your Vulcan nose up
at these,

147
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:37,219
you're not only insulting me,
but generations of McCoys.

148
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:41,765
ln that case, I have little choice
but to sample your beans.

149
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:52,026
Surprisingly good.

150
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:53,986
lt does have flavouring
l'm not familiar with.

151
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:56,989
That's the secret ingredient.

152
00:18:57,073 --> 00:19:00,284
You got any more
of that secret ingredient, Bones?

153
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:03,787
-Be my guest.
-Thank you.

154
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:07,291
Am I to understand
that your secret ingredient is alcohol?

155
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:11,128
Whisky. Tennessee whisky, Spock.
You care for a little snort?

156
00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:13,422
Bourbon and beans,
an explosive combination.

157
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:15,507
Think Spock can handle it?

158
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:18,510
Are you kidding?
With that Vulcan metabolism,

159
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:22,306
he could eat a bowl of termites
and it wouldn't bother him.

160
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:26,435
As you are so fond of pointing out,
Doctor, l'm half human.

161
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,854
Well, it certainly doesn't show.

162
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:30,731
Thank you.

163
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:32,775
How do you like that?
This guy never changes.

164
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:35,152
l insult him, and he takes it
as a compliment.

165
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:42,201
You know, you two
could drive a man to drink.

166
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:43,786
Me? What did I do?

167
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,245
What did you do?

168
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,122
You really piss me off, Jim.

169
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:51,543
Human life is far too precious
to risk on crazy stunts.

170
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:54,964
Maybe it didn't cross
that macho mind of yours,

171
00:19:55,048 --> 00:19:58,050
but you should've been killed
when you fell off that mountain.

172
00:19:58,134 --> 00:20:01,136
-lt crossed my mind.
-And?

173
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:03,889
And, even as I fell, I knew I wouldn't die.

174
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:07,810
l thought he was the only one
who's immortal.

175
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:09,979
Oh, no. lt isn't that.

176
00:20:10,063 --> 00:20:13,065
l knew I wouldn't die because
the two of you were with me.

177
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:17,236
l do not understand.

178
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:22,116
l've always known I'll die alone.

179
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:32,001
Well, I'll call Valhalla
and have them reserve a room for you.

180
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:38,924
lt's a mystery to me
what draws us together.

181
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:43,345
All that time in space,
and we getting on each others' nerves,

182
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,515
and what do we do when shore leave
comes along?

183
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,018
We spend it together.

184
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:51,770
Other people have families.

185
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:54,523
Other people, Bones. Not us.

186
00:21:01,698 --> 00:21:03,574
What are you doing?

187
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:07,786
l am preparing to toast a marsh melon.

188
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:11,957
Well, I'll be damned. A marsh melon.

189
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,544
Where'd you learn to do that?

190
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:17,880
Before leaving the ship,
l consulted the computer library

191
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:21,675
to familiarise myself with the customs
associated with camping out.

192
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:24,678
Well, tell me, Spock.

193
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:28,307
What do we do
after we toast the marsh melon?

194
00:21:29,976 --> 00:21:31,393
We consume them.

195
00:21:31,478 --> 00:21:34,480
l know we consume them.
l mean after that.

196
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:40,778
l believe we are required to engage
in a ritual known as the sing-along.

197
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:45,324
That's great. I haven't sung around
a campfire since I was a boy in lowa.

198
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:46,950
What are we going to sing? What. . .

199
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:48,410
Bones, what are we going to sing?

200
00:21:48,495 --> 00:21:50,412
How about Camptown Races?

201
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:51,830
Pack Up Your TroubIes.

202
00:21:51,915 --> 00:21:53,165
Are we leaving, Captain?

203
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:54,917
lt's a song title, Spock.

204
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:56,668
Moon over RigeI VII.

205
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,921
Row, Row, Row Your Boat.

206
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:00,798
Row, Row, Row Your Boat. I love Row...

207
00:22:00,882 --> 00:22:03,050
Do you know Row, Row, Row,
Row, Row Your Boat?

208
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:05,260
That song did not come up
in my research, Captain.

209
00:22:05,345 --> 00:22:07,846
The lyrics are very simple. lt's,

210
00:22:08,431 --> 00:22:11,266
"Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

211
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:15,521
"Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream"

212
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:17,940
The Doctor and I will start it off,

213
00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:20,651
and then when we give you a signal,
you jump in.

214
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:22,611
Doctor, if you please.

215
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:27,241
Don't say I didn't warn you.

216
00:22:28,201 --> 00:22:33,247
Row, row, row your boat
GentIy down the stream

217
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:35,791
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
-Row, row, row your boat

218
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,377
-Life is but a dream
-GentIy down the stream

219
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:40,921
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy

220
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:42,339
Life...

221
00:22:42,423 --> 00:22:43,423
Come on, Spock.

222
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,134
Why didn't you jump in?

223
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:48,554
l was trying to comprehend
the meaning of the words.

224
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:52,141
lt's a song, you green-blooded Vulcan.

225
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:54,601
You sing it. The words aren't important.

226
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:58,021
What's important
is that you have a good time singing it.

227
00:22:58,898 --> 00:23:00,732
l am sorry, Doctor.

228
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:03,235
Were we having a good time?

229
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,154
God, I liked him better before he died.

230
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:06,697
All right, all right, let's call it a night.

231
00:23:06,781 --> 00:23:08,615
-He just keeps after it.
-Let's. . . Let's go to bed,

232
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,576
and just let's get some sleep.

233
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,172
-Captain?
-Spock, we're on leave.

234
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:24,464
You can call me Jim.

235
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:26,383
-Jim?
-Yes, Spock?

236
00:23:27,093 --> 00:23:29,052
Life is not a dream.

237
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,598
Go to sleep, Spock.

238
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:34,933
Yes, Captain.

239
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:39,188
-Good night, Bones.
-Good night, Jim.

240
00:23:40,356 --> 00:23:44,318
-Good night, Spock.
-Good night, Doctor.

241
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:48,488
-Good night, Spock.
-Good night, Jim.

242
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:54,453
l don't know. I just don't know.

243
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:20,062
Captain Klaa, we have a target in sight.
A probe of ancient origin.

244
00:24:20,146 --> 00:24:21,813
Difficult to hit?

245
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,398
Most difficult.

246
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:24,524
Good.

247
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:26,902
All weapons to my control.

248
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:28,528
Scope!

249
00:24:56,015 --> 00:25:00,352
Shooting space garbage
is no test of a warrior's mettle.

250
00:25:01,562 --> 00:25:03,855
l need a target that fights back.

251
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:08,360
Captain, new data,
hostages on Nimbus lll.

252
00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:15,367
One of the hostages is a Klingon.

253
00:25:16,077 --> 00:25:17,327
And the others?

254
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,706
A Terran and a Romulan.

255
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:26,378
That means the Federation
will be sending a rescue ship of its own.

256
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:30,799
Plot course for Nimbus lll.

257
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:36,763
l've always wanted to engage
a Federation ship.

258
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:44,855
Get that damn light out of my face!

259
00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:59,911
Mr Scott apologises
for having to send the shuttlecraft.

260
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,706
The transporter beam
is non-operational.

261
00:26:02,915 --> 00:26:06,460
Captain, we've received important
orders from Starfleet command.

262
00:26:06,544 --> 00:26:08,628
Why didn't you beep my communicator?

263
00:26:08,713 --> 00:26:11,131
You forgot to take it with you.

264
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:12,966
Wonder why I did that.

265
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:16,595
Well, gentlemen, it appears
shore leave has been cancelled.

266
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:18,430
Pack out your trash.

267
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:55,717
"All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to steer her by"

268
00:26:55,802 --> 00:26:57,761
-Melville.
-John Masefield.

269
00:26:59,806 --> 00:27:01,223
Are you sure about that?

270
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:03,975
l am well versed in the classics, Doctor.

271
00:27:04,977 --> 00:27:08,480
Then how come you don't know
Row, Row, Row Your Boat?

272
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:20,659
Ready for Ianding manoeuvre.
Enterprise, you have control.

273
00:27:21,494 --> 00:27:23,328
You're doing just fine.

274
00:27:43,474 --> 00:27:45,767
Landing bay oxygen to pressure.

275
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:53,859
Landing bay is secure.

276
00:27:59,282 --> 00:28:00,490
Attention !

277
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:03,034
All I can say is, they don't make them
like they used to.

278
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,787
You told me you could have this ship
operational in two weeks.

279
00:28:05,872 --> 00:28:07,122
l gave you three. What happened?

280
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:09,166
l think you gave me
too much time, Captain.

281
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,625
-Very well, Mr Scott. Carry on.
-Aye, sir.

282
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,046
How many times do I have to tell you?
The right tool for the right job!

283
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:18,300
l don't think l've ever seen him happier.

284
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:19,551
LeveI?

285
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:21,178
Bridge.

286
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:23,513
l hope.

287
00:28:30,062 --> 00:28:32,063
l could use a shower.

288
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:34,524
Yes.

289
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:40,572
Doesn't anything work on this ship?

290
00:28:40,656 --> 00:28:43,325
Starfleet's got some nerve
sending us out in this condition

291
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:45,243
with this handful of people.

292
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:47,162
Captain on the Bridge.

293
00:28:47,246 --> 00:28:49,664
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.

294
00:28:49,749 --> 00:28:52,083
Put it on the viewscreen,
will you, please?

295
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:57,297
Can we have a little quiet, please?

296
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:04,679
-Can you. . .
-Am I on?

297
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:06,765
Can you clear that up?

298
00:29:08,392 --> 00:29:09,684
Can we have a little quiet?

299
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:12,062
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations.
Come in.

300
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:13,939
-Bob?
-Jim!

301
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:17,776
WeII! We're dressing informaIIy,
aren't we?

302
00:29:18,903 --> 00:29:20,695
You caught me on the way
to the shower.

303
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,697
I apoIogise for canceIIing shore Ieave,

304
00:29:22,782 --> 00:29:27,452
but Iook, we have a dangerous situation
out on Nimbus III.

305
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,373
-On the planet of galactic peace?
-The same.

306
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:32,791
From what we can make out,

307
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:36,086
a terrorist force
has captured the onIy settIement.

308
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,214
And they've taken hostages.
The KIingon, the RomuIan,

309
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:40,799
the Federation consuIs.

310
00:29:40,883 --> 00:29:44,302
Now, I know Enterprise is not exactIy
up to specs...

311
00:29:45,346 --> 00:29:48,431
With all due respect,
the Enterprise is a disaster.

312
00:29:48,516 --> 00:29:49,891
There must be other ships
in the quadrant.

313
00:29:49,976 --> 00:29:53,228
Other ships, yes.
But no experienced commanders.

314
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:55,897
Captain, I need Jim Kirk.

315
00:29:55,982 --> 00:29:57,566
-Oh, please.
-Your orders are

316
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,485
to proceed to Nimbus III,
assess the situation,

317
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,738
and avoid a confrontation if possibIe.

318
00:30:03,823 --> 00:30:07,242
Above a¡¡, however,
get those hostages back safeIy.

319
00:30:07,743 --> 00:30:09,494
Have the Klingons responded?

320
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:11,079
No, but you can bet they wiII.

321
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:12,872
Understood. Kirk out.

322
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:15,250
Plot course for Nimbus lll, Mr Sulu.

323
00:30:15,334 --> 00:30:16,626
Aye, sir.

324
00:30:17,962 --> 00:30:19,379
Course plotted.

325
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:23,049
l'm afraid the ship's problems
will have to be solved en route.

326
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:26,469
Since we're undermanned, l'm counting
on each one of you to give his best.

327
00:30:26,554 --> 00:30:28,555
End of speech. Let's go to work.

328
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:32,934
Jim, if you ask me, and you haven't,

329
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:37,147
l think this is a terrible idea.
We're bound to bump into the Klingons,

330
00:30:37,231 --> 00:30:39,608
and they don't exactly like you.

331
00:30:39,692 --> 00:30:41,526
The feeling's mutual.

332
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:44,279
-Engine Room.
-Scotty here.

333
00:30:44,363 --> 00:30:46,489
We'll need all the power
you can muster, mister.

334
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:49,784
Don't you worry, Captain.
We'll beat those Klingon devils

335
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,411
even if I have to get out and push.

336
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:54,372
l hope it won't come to that, Mr Scott.

337
00:30:54,832 --> 00:30:56,249
All possible speed, Mr Sulu.

338
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:57,542
Aye, sir.

339
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:06,426
What's the matter, Jim?

340
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:08,261
l miss my old chair.

341
00:31:16,187 --> 00:31:20,231
The starship Enterprise
has been dispatched to Nimbus lll.

342
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:22,442
Enterprise?

343
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,071
That's Kirk's ship!

344
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:33,036
lf I could defeat Kirk. . .

345
00:31:35,122 --> 00:31:39,209
You would be the greatest warrior
in the galaxy.

346
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,045
Maximum speed.

347
00:31:43,547 --> 00:31:45,006
Success!

348
00:31:46,425 --> 00:31:49,386
Captain's Log, Stardate 845. . .

349
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,935
Captain's Log, Stardate 84. . .

350
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:03,316
-Good morning, Captain.
-That's. . . Forget it.

351
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:07,278
Captain, we're receiving the hostage
information you requested.

352
00:32:07,822 --> 00:32:09,614
Put it on the screen.

353
00:32:10,074 --> 00:32:14,828
This is an authorised transmission
from StarfIeet GaIactic Memory Bank.

354
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:19,791
-Not General Korrd.
-The same.

355
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:23,545
He's apparently fallen out of favour
with the Klingon High Command.

356
00:32:23,629 --> 00:32:26,214
General Korrd's military strategies
were required learning

357
00:32:26,298 --> 00:32:28,508
when I was a cadet at the Academy.

358
00:32:29,552 --> 00:32:33,555
When they put me out to pasture,
l hope I fare better than Korrd.

359
00:32:36,183 --> 00:32:38,351
This must be the hostage tape.

360
00:32:39,311 --> 00:32:42,564
A short time ago,
we wiIIingIy surrendered ourseIves

361
00:32:42,648 --> 00:32:45,525
to the forces
of the GaIactic Army of Light.

362
00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:49,070
At this moment,
we're in their protective custody.

363
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:51,364
Their Ieader assures us
that we wiII be treated humaneIy

364
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:54,117
so Iong as you cooperate
with his demands.

365
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:58,538
I beIieve his sincerity. He requests
that you send a Federation starship

366
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:01,040
to parIey for our reIease at once.

367
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:03,501
Be assured that we are in good heaIth,

368
00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:06,087
and wouId appreciate
your immediate response.

369
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,303
I deepIy regret this desperate act,
but these are desperate times.

370
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:15,096
I have no desire
to harm these innocents,

371
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:18,016
but do not put me to the test.
I impIore you...

372
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:22,645
I impIore you to respond immediateIy.

373
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:38,203
What is it?

374
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:43,583
-You look like you've just seen a ghost.
-Perhaps I have, Captain.

375
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:45,251
Perhaps I have.

376
00:34:11,278 --> 00:34:13,029
Spock, what is it?

377
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:17,283
-Do you know this Vulcan?
-l cannot be certain.

378
00:34:17,952 --> 00:34:19,410
But he does seem familiar.

379
00:34:19,745 --> 00:34:22,664
He reminds me of someone
l knew in my youth.

380
00:34:22,915 --> 00:34:25,416
Why, Spock, I didn't know you had one.

381
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:27,460
l do not often think of the past.

382
00:34:28,921 --> 00:34:30,380
Who is it he reminds you of?

383
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:34,300
There was a young student,
exceptionally gifted,

384
00:34:35,344 --> 00:34:38,721
possessing a great intelligence.

385
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:43,268
lt was assumed that one day
he would take his place

386
00:34:43,352 --> 00:34:46,062
amongst the great scholars of Vulcan.

387
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:49,607
-But he was a revolutionary.
-What do you mean?

388
00:34:50,025 --> 00:34:52,151
The knowledge and experience
he sought

389
00:34:52,236 --> 00:34:54,863
were forbidden by Vulcan belief.

390
00:34:54,947 --> 00:34:59,117
-Forbidden?
-He rejected his logical upbringing

391
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:03,079
and embraced the animal passions
of our ancestors.

392
00:35:03,163 --> 00:35:04,247
Why?

393
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:11,212
He believed the key to self-knowledge
was emotion, not logic.

394
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:14,757
lmagine that. A passionate Vulcan.

395
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:17,760
When he encouraged others
to follow him,

396
00:35:17,845 --> 00:35:20,805
he was banished from Vulcan,
never to return.

397
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:25,101
-Fascinating.
-Captain to the Bridge.

398
00:35:25,811 --> 00:35:27,395
On my way.

399
00:35:33,193 --> 00:35:35,486
-Spock?
-Coming, Captain.

400
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:43,494
Approaching Nimbus lll.

401
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:45,663
Hailing frequency open.

402
00:35:45,873 --> 00:35:47,123
Standard orbit, Mr Sulu.

403
00:35:49,835 --> 00:35:53,046
Captain, we're receiving transmission
from Paradise City.

404
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,423
They're demanding to know
our intentions.

405
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:57,884
Respond with static.
Let them think we're having difficulty.

406
00:35:57,968 --> 00:35:59,385
Which wouldn't be far from the truth.

407
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:02,722
Paradise City,
can you boost your power?

408
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:04,849
We're barely receiving transmission.

409
00:36:05,184 --> 00:36:06,643
Transporter Room. Status.

410
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:08,478
Scotty here, Captain.

411
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:11,481
Transporter is still inoperative.

412
00:36:11,982 --> 00:36:13,816
Even if we could lock on
to the hostages,

413
00:36:13,901 --> 00:36:16,152
we could not beam them up.

414
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:21,616
We're gonna have to get them out
the old-fashioned way.

415
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,451
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant.

416
00:36:23,535 --> 00:36:27,163
Bird-of-prey. Estimating 1.9 hours
until her weapons come to bear.

417
00:36:28,123 --> 00:36:30,375
Damn. Let's go.

418
00:36:50,604 --> 00:36:53,648
Their scanning equipment is primitive
but effective.

419
00:36:53,732 --> 00:36:56,442
l recommend we land
at coordinates 8-5-6-3.

420
00:36:56,568 --> 00:36:58,820
That puts us pretty far away
from Paradise City.

421
00:36:58,904 --> 00:37:01,406
To land any closer
would be to risk detection.

422
00:37:01,615 --> 00:37:03,950
-Mr Sulu. Execute.
-Aye, sir.

423
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:13,167
Paradise City.
This is Starship Enterprise.

424
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:15,294
A Federation starship.

425
00:37:19,341 --> 00:37:21,843
This is Captain PaveI Chekov speaking.

426
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:25,096
You are in vioIation
of NeutraI Zone Treaty.

427
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,682
I advise you
to reIease your hostages at once,

428
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:28,933
or suffer the consequences.

429
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:30,768
Your threats amuse me,
Captain Chekov.

430
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:32,603
What consequences
did you have in mind?

431
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,334
Go! Go! Go!

432
00:37:56,378 --> 00:37:58,963
Even as we speak,
a Klingon warship is on its way.

433
00:37:59,298 --> 00:38:01,090
We estimate arrival within the hour.

434
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:03,551
l imagine the Klingons
will be quite angry.

435
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:06,971
You are a master of understatement.
They are IikeIy to destroy the pIanet.

436
00:38:07,056 --> 00:38:11,225
Then it's fortunate that I have you
and your starship to protect me.

437
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:14,771
ln the meantime, Captain Chekov,
l instruct you and your first officer

438
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:17,148
to beam down to my coordinates.

439
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:20,651
We wiII be happy to beam down.

440
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:23,529
But first we must have
certain assurances.

441
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:30,620
At foot speed, I estimate the journey
to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.

442
00:38:30,704 --> 00:38:32,663
We don't have 1.2 hours.

443
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,210
Wait a minute. Perfect!

444
00:38:37,503 --> 00:38:39,962
But we'll have to get their attention.

445
00:38:49,348 --> 00:38:50,723
What?

446
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,980
What's that?

447
00:38:59,483 --> 00:39:00,566
Damn !

448
00:39:01,485 --> 00:39:02,902
ls she naked?

449
00:39:04,613 --> 00:39:06,155
-What?
-ls she naked?

450
00:39:10,035 --> 00:39:11,828
What is that?

451
00:39:46,655 --> 00:39:48,364
Hello, boys.

452
00:39:50,325 --> 00:39:53,703
l've always wanted to play
to a captive audience.

453
00:39:54,913 --> 00:39:56,414
Oh, damn.

454
00:40:01,086 --> 00:40:03,045
-Spock.
-Yes, Captain?

455
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:06,090
-Be one with the horse.
-Yes, Captain.

456
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:13,681
Open the gate. lt's our lookout party.

457
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:19,770
Federation soldiers right behind us.
Close the gate!

458
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:31,115
Where are they going?

459
00:40:31,617 --> 00:40:34,660
-Spock.
-Hold your horse, Captain. l'm scanning.

460
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:45,129
The hostages are being held
in that structure.

461
00:40:47,966 --> 00:40:49,675
Galileo, this is Strike Team.
Start your run.

462
00:40:52,596 --> 00:40:55,723
-Who are you?
-Phasers on stun. Get rid of the mounts.

463
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:57,892
-Sulu, take out that light.
-Yes, Captain.

464
00:41:12,157 --> 00:41:13,157
What's going on?

465
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:14,867
I instruct you to surrender at once.

466
00:41:14,952 --> 00:41:17,453
You are under attack
by superior Federation forces.

467
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:20,623
Do you realise what you've done?
lt wasn't bloodshed I wanted !

468
00:41:20,707 --> 00:41:21,832
Wait! Come back!

469
00:42:07,713 --> 00:42:09,297
Uhura, come on down.

470
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,048
Roger. Coming in.

471
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:59,347
RecreationaI opportunities are IimitIess.
The vicinity is famous for its pIentifuI

472
00:42:59,431 --> 00:43:02,600
IocaI wiIdIife. And the fishing? Terrific.

473
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:05,019
Easy financing
through Federation FederaI

474
00:43:05,103 --> 00:43:07,521
can put you in your own home...

475
00:43:07,606 --> 00:43:08,939
Thank God.

476
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:11,442
Please cooperate.

477
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,694
Would you mind handing over
your weapons?

478
00:43:13,779 --> 00:43:16,614
So, what are you waiting for?
Beam on down!

479
00:43:17,616 --> 00:43:20,117
Well done, my friends.

480
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,661
Spock!

481
00:44:13,255 --> 00:44:14,463
Spock.

482
00:44:15,132 --> 00:44:17,883
lt's me. lt's Sybok.

483
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,804
After all these years,
you've finally caught up with me.

484
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,684
Don't you have anything to say to me?

485
00:44:30,397 --> 00:44:33,149
You are under arrest

486
00:44:33,233 --> 00:44:36,277
for seventeen violations
of the Neutral Zone Treaty.

487
00:44:47,456 --> 00:44:50,791
Spock, you've developed
a sense of humour after all.

488
00:44:50,876 --> 00:44:56,046
lt was not my intention to amuse you.
These are serious charges.

489
00:44:57,632 --> 00:45:01,927
-However, if you surrender now. . .
-l'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now.

490
00:45:02,012 --> 00:45:04,889
l'm not through violating
Neutral Zone Treaty.

491
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:09,894
ln fact, l'm just getting started.

492
00:45:09,978 --> 00:45:14,857
And for my next violation,
l intend to steal something.

493
00:45:16,151 --> 00:45:17,735
Something very big.

494
00:45:22,073 --> 00:45:23,908
l must have your starship.

495
00:45:24,326 --> 00:45:27,995
You staged all this
to get your hands on my ship?

496
00:45:28,747 --> 00:45:31,582
-Who are you?
-James T. Kirk,

497
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:35,711
-Captain of the Enterprise.
-But I thought Captain Chekov. . .

498
00:45:36,671 --> 00:45:38,047
l see!

499
00:45:38,924 --> 00:45:40,841
Very clever, Captain.

500
00:45:42,177 --> 00:45:46,138
Spock, it would appear that you've been
given a second chance to join me.

501
00:45:46,556 --> 00:45:48,182
What do you say?

502
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:53,103
-l am a Starfleet officer.
-Of course.

503
00:45:55,023 --> 00:45:56,398
Of course.

504
00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:00,236
Then I'll take the ship without your help.

505
00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:22,341
Shuttle en route.

506
00:46:22,425 --> 00:46:24,260
Position, bird-of-prey?

507
00:46:27,722 --> 00:46:28,973
Closing.

508
00:46:35,313 --> 00:46:39,149
Estimating attack range
in 8,000 kellicams.

509
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:44,321
Stealth approach,
slow to one quarter impulse power.

510
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:46,282
Prepare to cloak.

511
00:46:47,325 --> 00:46:49,326
Engage cloaking device.

512
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,795
Mr Chekov.

513
00:47:01,006 --> 00:47:03,382
l've lost the bird-of-prey.
She must have cloaked.

514
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:05,551
-Raise shields.
-But the shuttle. . .

515
00:47:05,844 --> 00:47:07,720
Do it. Go to red alert.

516
00:47:20,066 --> 00:47:23,944
Once we've taken control of your vessel,
we'll bring up the rest of our followers.

517
00:47:24,029 --> 00:47:25,946
The Klingons are out there.

518
00:47:26,031 --> 00:47:27,990
We'll be lucky to get back
to the ship ourselves.

519
00:47:28,074 --> 00:47:30,868
Galileo, this is Enterprise.
Condition red aIert.

520
00:47:30,952 --> 00:47:34,955
Bird-of-prey approaching.
She is cIoaked. Raising shieIds.

521
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,916
Recommend Galileo find safe harbour
until situation secure.

522
00:47:38,543 --> 00:47:40,085
-AcknowIedge.
-No!

523
00:47:43,214 --> 00:47:46,050
No reply. Remain on course.

524
00:47:47,052 --> 00:47:51,555
Sybok, listen to me. ln order
for this craft to enter the landing bay,

525
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,726
Enterprise must lower the shields
and activate the tractor beam.

526
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:00,064
To get us inside
and re-raise the shields will take. . .

527
00:48:00,148 --> 00:48:01,815
Exactly 15.5 seconds.

528
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,402
An eternity, during which we'll be
vulnerable to Klingon attack.

529
00:48:05,487 --> 00:48:07,821
-Korrd, you tell him.
-He speaks the truth.

530
00:48:07,906 --> 00:48:11,742
lf my people are cloaked,
then they intend to strike.

531
00:48:13,953 --> 00:48:15,621
We cannot turn back.

532
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:19,124
-You must allow us to act.
-Let me do something.

533
00:48:19,959 --> 00:48:23,545
Very well. Do what you must.
But no more.

534
00:48:31,304 --> 00:48:33,597
Enterprise. This is Kirk.

535
00:48:34,182 --> 00:48:35,432
Kirk.

536
00:48:35,517 --> 00:48:37,518
He's on the shuttlecraft!

537
00:48:37,894 --> 00:48:39,645
Alter the attack course!

538
00:48:39,729 --> 00:48:43,774
Understand your situation.
Are unable to return to planet.

539
00:48:45,193 --> 00:48:50,698
Stand by to execute
Emergency Landing Plan B.

540
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:58,706
-What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
-l don't have a clue.

541
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:02,334
-B, as in "barricade."
-He can't be serious.

542
00:49:06,631 --> 00:49:08,465
What are you doing?

543
00:49:09,676 --> 00:49:12,511
ln order to lower and raise the shields
as quickly as possible,

544
00:49:12,595 --> 00:49:16,306
we're going to forego the tractor beam
and fly her in manually.

545
00:49:16,808 --> 00:49:19,184
-Manually?
-How often have you done this?

546
00:49:20,353 --> 00:49:22,688
Actually, it's my first attempt.

547
00:49:26,443 --> 00:49:27,735
He's good.

548
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,028
Really.

549
00:49:34,492 --> 00:49:36,452
Scotty, on my mark, open bay doors.

550
00:49:45,295 --> 00:49:47,588
Stand by to de-cloak for firing.

551
00:49:47,672 --> 00:49:50,007
Kirk to Scotty. Lower shields.

552
00:49:50,091 --> 00:49:51,842
Lowering shields, sir.

553
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:04,104
Bird-of-prey bearing 1 -0-5 mark 2.

554
00:50:04,189 --> 00:50:05,522
Go, Sulu !

555
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,166
They're in !

556
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,960
Bear on Enterprise.

557
00:50:27,128 --> 00:50:29,463
Enterprise targeted !

558
00:50:29,547 --> 00:50:31,465
Warp speed now.

559
00:50:31,758 --> 00:50:32,925
Firing !

560
00:50:39,682 --> 00:50:41,725
Track her course!

561
00:50:44,395 --> 00:50:45,729
He's good.

562
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,773
We must change course at once.

563
00:51:35,738 --> 00:51:37,948
l'll take you to the Bridge.

564
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:16,320
Pick it up.

565
00:52:23,328 --> 00:52:24,453
Sybok.

566
00:52:27,457 --> 00:52:29,166
You must surrender.

567
00:52:33,504 --> 00:52:34,504
No.

568
00:52:37,508 --> 00:52:40,969
-You must kill me.
-Shoot him !

569
00:52:52,899 --> 00:52:57,194
For a moment,
l thought you might actually do it.

570
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:06,119
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.

571
00:53:10,959 --> 00:53:12,042
Spock.

572
00:53:14,128 --> 00:53:17,172
You will accompany me to the Bridge?

573
00:53:18,091 --> 00:53:19,216
No.

574
00:53:21,386 --> 00:53:22,886
l will not.

575
00:53:25,264 --> 00:53:27,432
You know l'm right.

576
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,607
Then you must join them.

577
00:53:54,168 --> 00:53:55,794
Move. Move!

578
00:53:56,587 --> 00:54:00,799
-These two will be useful.
-Give us a moment alone.

579
00:54:02,051 --> 00:54:03,552
Don't be afraid.

580
00:54:21,779 --> 00:54:24,573
-Damn it, Spock. God damn it!
-Captain, what I have done. . .

581
00:54:24,657 --> 00:54:26,366
What you have done
is betray every man on this ship.

582
00:54:26,451 --> 00:54:29,703
Worse. I have betrayed you.
l do not expect you to forgive me.

583
00:54:29,787 --> 00:54:32,039
Forgive you? I ought to knock you
on your goddamn ass.

584
00:54:32,123 --> 00:54:33,540
lf you think it would help.

585
00:54:33,624 --> 00:54:36,251
-You want me to hold him, Jim?
-You stay out of this.

586
00:54:36,627 --> 00:54:40,130
Why, Spock? Why?
All you had to do was pull the trigger.

587
00:54:40,214 --> 00:54:42,549
lf I had pulled the trigger,
Sybok would be dead.

588
00:54:42,633 --> 00:54:46,178
-l ordered you to defend your ship.
-You ordered me to kill my brother.

589
00:54:46,262 --> 00:54:48,138
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan,
but that doesn't. . .

590
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:50,265
No, no, no, Captain.
You do not understand.

591
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:53,518
Sybok also is a son of Sarek.

592
00:54:53,603 --> 00:54:56,229
You mean he's your "brother" brother?

593
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,399
-You made that up.
-l did not.

594
00:54:59,484 --> 00:55:01,401
You did, too.
Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother

595
00:55:01,486 --> 00:55:03,737
because I happen to know for a fact
you don't have a brother.

596
00:55:03,821 --> 00:55:06,656
Technically you are correct.
l do not have a brother.

597
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:09,576
-There, you see? See?
-l have a half-brother.

598
00:55:11,704 --> 00:55:13,330
l gotta sit down.

599
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:17,209
Let me get this straight.

600
00:55:17,293 --> 00:55:20,045
You and Sybok have the same father
but different mothers.

601
00:55:20,129 --> 00:55:24,091
Exactly. That is correct.
Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess.

602
00:55:24,175 --> 00:55:27,511
Upon her death,
Sybok and I were raised as brothers.

603
00:55:28,471 --> 00:55:30,347
Why didn't you tell us this before?

604
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,226
l was not disposed to discuss matters
of a personal nature.

605
00:55:34,602 --> 00:55:36,186
For that, I am sorry.

606
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:38,605
He's sorry. See? He's sorry.
That makes everything all right.

607
00:55:38,689 --> 00:55:40,857
-He's sorry. Everything. . .
-Stop it, Jim !

608
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:43,777
Spock could no more kill
his own brother than he could kill you.

609
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:45,112
lf you want to punish him
for what he's done,

610
00:55:45,196 --> 00:55:46,988
why don't you throw him in the brig?

611
00:55:47,073 --> 00:55:49,783
Besides, we've got
bigger problems to deal with.

612
00:55:49,867 --> 00:55:52,327
Like how the hell to get out of here.

613
00:55:52,995 --> 00:55:54,621
l'll say one thing, Spock.

614
00:55:54,705 --> 00:55:57,916
-You never cease to amaze me.
-Nor I myself.

615
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:08,051
l was beginning to worry.
Where is the captain?

616
00:56:08,136 --> 00:56:11,513
lt's all right, Pavel.
Sybok will explain everything.

617
00:56:13,182 --> 00:56:16,476
-Sulu, what are you doing?
-Plotting our new course.

618
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:18,854
New course? You have no authority.

619
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,234
What's going on here?

620
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:25,485
-Pavel. . .
-l won't force you.

621
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:28,697
-. . .you've got to listen to this man.
-The decision must be yours.

622
00:56:28,781 --> 00:56:32,075
-l don't understand.
-Each of us hides a secret pain.

623
00:56:33,077 --> 00:56:37,581
Share yours with me
and gain strength from the sharing.

624
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:56,266
Useless.

625
00:57:03,274 --> 00:57:04,816
Unwise.

626
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:16,119
-You could've warned me.
-He did, Jim.

627
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:17,871
There's got to be a way
out of this place.

628
00:57:17,955 --> 00:57:20,624
This is a new brig, Captain.
lt is escape-proof.

629
00:57:21,709 --> 00:57:24,294
-How do you know?
-The designers tested it

630
00:57:24,378 --> 00:57:28,465
using the most intelligent
and resourceful person they could find.

631
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,383
He failed to escape.

632
00:57:30,468 --> 00:57:33,720
This person didn't by any chance
have pointed ears

633
00:57:33,804 --> 00:57:38,350
and an unerring capacity for getting
his shipmates into trouble, did he?

634
00:57:41,562 --> 00:57:43,688
He did have pointed ears.

635
00:57:48,361 --> 00:57:50,695
Following new course. Warp 7.

636
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:54,157
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours,
present speed.

637
00:57:56,827 --> 00:57:58,203
Now that we're under way,

638
00:57:58,287 --> 00:58:01,498
it's time I announced my intentions
to the rest of the ship.

639
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:05,210
Brave crew of the Starship Enterprise,

640
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:08,838
consider the questions of existence.

641
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,591
These are the questions
which man has asked

642
00:58:11,676 --> 00:58:15,804
ever since he first gazed at the stars
and dreamed.

643
00:58:16,305 --> 00:58:20,433
My VuIcan ancestors were ruIed
by their emotions.

644
00:58:20,518 --> 00:58:25,689
They feIt with their hearts.
They made Iove with their hearts.

645
00:58:26,565 --> 00:58:28,900
They beIieved with their hearts.

646
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:31,778
But above all else,
they believed in a place

647
00:58:31,862 --> 00:58:35,573
in which these questions of existence
would be answered.

648
00:58:37,285 --> 00:58:39,995
Modern dogma tells us
this place is a myth,

649
00:58:40,997 --> 00:58:44,624
a fantasy concocted by pagans.

650
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:48,211
It is no fantasy, I teII you.

651
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:51,089
I teII you

652
00:58:52,717 --> 00:58:54,092
it exists.

653
00:58:54,468 --> 00:58:57,637
My brothers, we have been chosen

654
00:58:58,723 --> 00:59:02,892
to undertake
the greatest adventure of all time.

655
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:07,522
The discovery of Sha'Ka'Ree.

656
00:59:09,066 --> 00:59:10,984
-ls it possible?
-ls what possible?

657
00:59:11,068 --> 00:59:15,488
That he's found Sha'Ka'Ree.
The reason Sybok left Vulcan.

658
00:59:15,781 --> 00:59:19,159
Our destination
is the planet Sha'Ka'Ree,

659
00:59:20,494 --> 00:59:23,663
which lies beyond the Great Barrier

660
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:26,082
at the centre of the gaIaxy.

661
00:59:27,251 --> 00:59:31,087
-The centre of the galaxy?
-Where Sha'Ka'Ree is fabled to exist.

662
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:34,090
But the centre of the galaxy
can't be reached.

663
00:59:34,175 --> 00:59:35,842
No ship has ever gone
into the Great Barrier.

664
00:59:35,926 --> 00:59:37,427
No probe has ever returned.

665
00:59:37,511 --> 00:59:40,889
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect
l have ever known.

666
00:59:40,973 --> 00:59:43,433
Spock, my only concern
is getting the ship back.

667
00:59:43,517 --> 00:59:45,393
When that's done and Sybok is in here,

668
00:59:45,478 --> 00:59:49,272
then you can debate Sha'Ka'Ree
until you're green in the face.

669
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:53,360
Until then, you're either with me
or you're not.

670
00:59:53,444 --> 00:59:56,946
-l am here, Captain.
-That's a little vague, Spock.

671
01:00:00,493 --> 01:00:02,160
What's that noise?

672
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:08,541
l believe it is a primitive form
of communication

673
01:00:08,626 --> 01:00:10,502
-known as Morse code.
-You're right.

674
01:00:10,586 --> 01:00:13,797
l'm a little out of practise. That's an "S."

675
01:00:13,964 --> 01:00:20,387
-"T."
-"A," "N," "D," end of word.

676
01:00:20,471 --> 01:00:25,809
-"Stand."
-New word. "B," "A". . .

677
01:00:26,977 --> 01:00:29,270
"C," "K."

678
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,648
"Back." "Stand back."

679
01:00:32,066 --> 01:00:33,066
-Stand back?
-Stand back?

680
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,739
What are you standing around for?

681
01:00:39,824 --> 01:00:41,950
Do you not know a jail break
when you see one?

682
01:00:42,993 --> 01:00:45,995
The bond between these three
is strong, difficult to penetrate.

683
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,164
This will be quite a challenge.

684
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,876
We've got to find them.

685
01:00:52,128 --> 01:00:55,630
-Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
-lf we could send a distress signal. . .

686
01:00:55,714 --> 01:00:57,257
There is an emergency
sending apparatus

687
01:00:57,341 --> 01:00:58,299
in the forward observation room.

688
01:00:58,384 --> 01:01:00,760
The only trouble is, it's up there.
We're down here.

689
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:03,847
You might be able to reach it by means
of turbo shaft number three,

690
01:01:03,931 --> 01:01:07,809
which is closed for repairs.
lt's a long and dangerous climb.

691
01:01:07,893 --> 01:01:10,437
Some of us get off
on long and dangerous climbs.

692
01:01:10,521 --> 01:01:12,355
Mr Scott, get the transporter working.

693
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,441
lf we can contact a rescue ship,
we'll need it.

694
01:01:14,525 --> 01:01:15,775
Which way to the turbo shaft?

695
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,403
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent
and turn right.

696
01:01:18,487 --> 01:01:20,572
Then left at the blowscreen.
You can't miss it.

697
01:01:20,656 --> 01:01:23,324
-Mr Scott, you're amazing.
-There's nothing amazing about it.

698
01:01:23,409 --> 01:01:26,536
l know this ship
like the back of my hand.

699
01:01:36,046 --> 01:01:39,215
All right. Look at it this way,
we'll get a good workout.

700
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,718
Yeah, or a heart attack.

701
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,283
Get Mr Scott to sickbay.

702
01:02:32,811 --> 01:02:35,355
Jim, this is going to take me forever.

703
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:43,363
Where's Spock?

704
01:02:47,076 --> 01:02:49,786
l believe I have found a faster way.

705
01:03:02,049 --> 01:03:03,883
Bones?

706
01:03:03,968 --> 01:03:06,844
You two go ahead.
l'll wait for the next car.

707
01:03:06,929 --> 01:03:08,596
We're not splitting up.

708
01:03:15,312 --> 01:03:18,022
-lt appears we're too heavy.
-Must be all those marsh melons.

709
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:22,068
Spock, the booster rockets.

710
01:03:22,152 --> 01:03:24,529
lf I activate them now, Captain,
we'll be propelled upward

711
01:03:24,613 --> 01:03:26,364
at an unbelievable rate.

712
01:03:26,448 --> 01:03:27,740
Fire the rockets!

713
01:03:29,994 --> 01:03:31,160
Captain, please come back down. . .

714
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:38,334
Hit the brakes!

715
01:03:44,967 --> 01:03:47,468
l'm afraid I overshot the mark
by one level.

716
01:03:47,553 --> 01:03:49,178
Nobody's perfect.

717
01:04:00,399 --> 01:04:01,858
Spock.

718
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,654
Emergency channel open.

719
01:04:06,989 --> 01:04:08,531
To anyone within the sound of my voice,

720
01:04:08,616 --> 01:04:11,868
this is Captain James T. Kirk
of the Federation Starship Enterprise.

721
01:04:11,952 --> 01:04:14,120
lf you read me, acknowledge.

722
01:04:15,414 --> 01:04:16,706
Acknowledge.

723
01:04:18,542 --> 01:04:22,086
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Command.
We read you. Over.

724
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:26,299
A hostile force has taken control
of our vessel

725
01:04:26,383 --> 01:04:29,052
and put us on a direct course
with the Great Barrier.

726
01:04:29,803 --> 01:04:31,554
Our coordinates are 0-0-0. . .

727
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:33,556
-Mark 2.
-. . .mark 2.

728
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:36,351
Request emergency assistance.
Acknowledge.

729
01:04:36,894 --> 01:04:41,397
Understood, Enterprise. We are
dispatching a rescue ship immediately.

730
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:42,523
Roger, StarfIeet.

731
01:04:42,608 --> 01:04:45,276
Plot course zero-zero-zero, mark two.

732
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:51,157
But Captain, that course will take us
into the Barrier as well.

733
01:04:51,241 --> 01:04:53,993
Where Kirk goes, we follow.

734
01:04:57,748 --> 01:04:59,582
l trust your message was received.

735
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:03,169
You can't expect us to stand by while
you take the ship into the Great Barrier.

736
01:05:03,253 --> 01:05:06,422
What you fear is the unknown.

737
01:05:08,467 --> 01:05:12,637
The people of your planet
once believed their world was flat.

738
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:16,349
Columbus proved it was round.

739
01:05:17,101 --> 01:05:21,437
They said the sound barrier could never
be broken. lt was broken.

740
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:25,525
They said warp speed
could not be achieved.

741
01:05:27,945 --> 01:05:32,407
The Great Barrier is the ultimate
expression of this universal fear.

742
01:05:34,118 --> 01:05:36,703
lt's an extension of personal fear.

743
01:05:36,787 --> 01:05:39,872
Captain Kirk, I so much want
your understanding.

744
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:44,794
l want your respect.
Are you afraid to hear me out?

745
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:48,089
l'm afraid of nothing.

746
01:05:48,966 --> 01:05:50,383
Wait outside.

747
01:05:58,684 --> 01:06:01,102
l'm sure you have many questions.

748
01:06:01,645 --> 01:06:05,857
Here, amidst the stars
of our own galaxy,

749
01:06:05,941 --> 01:06:09,068
we shall seek the answers together.

750
01:06:17,786 --> 01:06:22,582
Easy. Easy. Easy, Scotty. Easy.
You're back with us.

751
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:25,334
Uhura, I had the strangest dream.

752
01:06:25,419 --> 01:06:27,378
l dreamt that a madman
had taken over the Enterprise.

753
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:30,047
Scotty, dear, he's not a madman.

754
01:06:30,132 --> 01:06:31,716
-He's not?
-No.

755
01:06:32,384 --> 01:06:34,802
Sybok has simply put us in touch

756
01:06:34,887 --> 01:06:38,431
with feelings that we've always been
afraid to express.

757
01:06:38,515 --> 01:06:43,102
-l have to get back to the transporter.
-No, no, no. Scotty! Scotty.

758
01:06:43,187 --> 01:06:45,271
There's so much I want to tell you.

759
01:06:45,355 --> 01:06:49,192
Maybe you could wait
till l'm a wee bit stronger.

760
01:06:49,985 --> 01:06:53,321
l don't think I could take it
in my present condition.

761
01:06:56,825 --> 01:06:57,950
Or yours.

762
01:06:58,535 --> 01:06:59,994
Sha'Ka'Ree.

763
01:07:01,163 --> 01:07:02,497
"The Source."

764
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,166
"Heaven."

765
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:07,960
"Eden."

766
01:07:08,796 --> 01:07:12,131
Call it what you will.
The Klingons call it "Qui'Tu."

767
01:07:13,175 --> 01:07:16,803
For the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor."
The Andorian word is. . .

768
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:19,180
ls unpronounceable.

769
01:07:19,264 --> 01:07:22,058
Still, every culture in existence
shares this common dream

770
01:07:22,142 --> 01:07:27,730
of a place from which creation sprang.
For us, that place will soon be reality.

771
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:31,901
The only reality I see is
that l'm a prisoner on my own ship.

772
01:07:32,236 --> 01:07:36,072
What is this power you have
to control the minds of my crew?

773
01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:40,409
l don't control minds. I free them.

774
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:45,373
How?

775
01:07:47,668 --> 01:07:51,170
By making you face your pain,
and draw strength from it.

776
01:07:52,548 --> 01:07:55,633
Once that's done, fear cannot stop you.

777
01:08:02,432 --> 01:08:06,644
Sounds like brainwashing to me.

778
01:08:06,728 --> 01:08:09,480
-Your pain is the deepest of all.
-What?

779
01:08:10,148 --> 01:08:12,775
l can feel it. Can't you?

780
01:08:13,944 --> 01:08:15,570
Leonard.

781
01:08:25,163 --> 01:08:26,914
lt's some kind of trick.

782
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:31,294
Leonard.

783
01:08:34,631 --> 01:08:36,257
Father?

784
01:08:36,842 --> 01:08:40,344
-Oh, my God, don't do this to me.
-Leonard.

785
01:08:53,108 --> 01:08:56,485
l'm here. l'm with you, Dad.

786
01:08:57,863 --> 01:08:59,071
The pain.

787
01:09:00,824 --> 01:09:02,074
Stop the pain.

788
01:09:02,826 --> 01:09:04,994
l've done everything I can do.

789
01:09:06,079 --> 01:09:08,039
You've got to hang on.

790
01:09:08,707 --> 01:09:10,583
l can't stand the pain.

791
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,294
Help me.

792
01:09:16,006 --> 01:09:18,341
All my knowledge, and I can't save him.

793
01:09:19,468 --> 01:09:23,429
You've done all you can.
The support system will keep him alive.

794
01:09:27,768 --> 01:09:29,560
You call this alive?

795
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:31,646
Son,

796
01:09:34,191 --> 01:09:37,902
-release me.
-l can't do that, Dad.

797
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:43,616
But how?
How can I watch him suffer like this?

798
01:09:44,993 --> 01:09:46,702
You're a doctor.

799
01:09:55,212 --> 01:09:56,629
l'm his son.

800
01:11:01,069 --> 01:11:02,737
Why did you do it?

801
01:11:07,576 --> 01:11:11,662
To preserve his dignity.

802
01:11:15,959 --> 01:11:18,377
That wasn't the worst of it.

803
01:11:18,462 --> 01:11:19,462
-No.
-Was it?

804
01:11:19,546 --> 01:11:20,963
-No!
-Share it.

805
01:11:22,132 --> 01:11:26,719
Not long after, they found a cure.
A goddamn cure!

806
01:11:26,803 --> 01:11:28,345
So if you hadn't killed him,
he might have lived.

807
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:31,223
No! I loved my father. I released him !

808
01:11:31,308 --> 01:11:32,850
Then you did
what you thought was right.

809
01:11:32,934 --> 01:11:34,894
Yes. No! Yes!

810
01:11:34,978 --> 01:11:37,271
Release this pain. Release it!

811
01:11:38,857 --> 01:11:42,026
This pain has poisoned your soul
for a long time.

812
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:47,406
Now you've taken the first step.

813
01:11:48,992 --> 01:11:51,660
The other steps we'll take together.

814
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,087
Each man's pain is unique.

815
01:12:02,506 --> 01:12:04,048
l hide no pain.

816
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:11,972
-l know you better than that.
-Do you?

817
01:12:12,057 --> 01:12:14,767
-Spock, don't.
-lt's all right, Captain.

818
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:18,187
Proceed.

819
01:12:24,152 --> 01:12:27,696
-What is this?
-l believe we are witnessing my birth.

820
01:13:04,568 --> 01:13:07,111
Sarek, your son.

821
01:13:10,615 --> 01:13:11,907
So human.

822
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:19,832
Spock?

823
01:13:39,436 --> 01:13:41,896
-What have you done to my friends?
-l've done nothing.

824
01:13:42,105 --> 01:13:44,940
This is who they are.
Didn't you know that?

825
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:48,611
No, I didn't.

826
01:13:49,029 --> 01:13:52,281
-Now learn something about yourself.
-No. I refuse.

827
01:13:52,741 --> 01:13:56,535
-Jim, try to be open about this.
-About what?

828
01:13:58,371 --> 01:14:01,040
That l've made
the wrong choices in my life?

829
01:14:01,124 --> 01:14:03,334
That I turned left
when I should have turned right?

830
01:14:03,418 --> 01:14:04,668
l know what my weaknesses are.

831
01:14:04,753 --> 01:14:06,545
l don't need Sybok to take me
on a tour of them.

832
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:08,380
lf you'd just unbend and allow yourself. . .

833
01:14:08,465 --> 01:14:11,217
-And be brainwashed by this con man?
-l was wrong.

834
01:14:12,177 --> 01:14:15,304
-This con man took away my pain.
-Damn it, Bones, you're a doctor.

835
01:14:15,388 --> 01:14:16,931
You know that pain and guilt
can't be taken away

836
01:14:17,015 --> 01:14:18,724
with the wave of a magic wand.

837
01:14:18,808 --> 01:14:22,561
They're the things we carry with us,
the things that make us who we are.

838
01:14:22,646 --> 01:14:25,231
lf we lose them, we lose ourselves.

839
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:28,442
l don't want my pain taken away.
l need my pain !

840
01:14:28,526 --> 01:14:32,613
Sybok, this is the Bridge.
We're in approach of the Great Barrier.

841
01:14:34,282 --> 01:14:36,242
Captain, l'm afraid
you'll have to remain here.

842
01:14:36,326 --> 01:14:38,827
Spock, Dr McCoy, come with me.

843
01:14:41,122 --> 01:14:44,291
-Spock?
-l cannot go with you.

844
01:14:45,252 --> 01:14:48,212
-Why not?
-l belong here.

845
01:14:49,339 --> 01:14:50,839
l don't understand.

846
01:14:51,424 --> 01:14:55,177
Sybok, you are my brother,
but you do not know me.

847
01:14:56,346 --> 01:15:00,015
l am not the outcast boy
you left behind those many years ago.

848
01:15:00,225 --> 01:15:04,895
Since that time, I have found myself,
and my place.

849
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:09,024
l know who I am.
And I cannot go with you.

850
01:15:15,657 --> 01:15:18,367
l guess you'd better count me out, too.

851
01:15:21,705 --> 01:15:24,081
-Then I'll see you on the other side.
-Wait!

852
01:15:27,502 --> 01:15:30,462
You know we'll never make it
through the Great Barrier.

853
01:15:30,547 --> 01:15:34,466
But if we do, will that convince you
that my vision was true?

854
01:15:35,552 --> 01:15:38,387
-Your vision?
-Given to me by God.

855
01:15:39,556 --> 01:15:42,016
He waits for us on the other side.

856
01:15:43,893 --> 01:15:45,477
You are mad.

857
01:15:49,065 --> 01:15:50,566
Am l?

858
01:15:53,069 --> 01:15:54,403
We'll see.

859
01:16:20,972 --> 01:16:23,766
They say no ship can survive this.

860
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:26,560
l say they're wrong.
l say that danger is an illusion.

861
01:16:26,644 --> 01:16:28,645
We have no instrument readings.

862
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:32,149
-ls it there or isn't it?
-Mr Sulu, full ahead.

863
01:16:33,109 --> 01:16:34,693
Full ahead. Aye.

864
01:17:33,002 --> 01:17:34,461
ls it possible?

865
01:17:34,796 --> 01:17:36,296
Fascinating.

866
01:17:39,342 --> 01:17:40,843
Are we dreaming?

867
01:17:43,847 --> 01:17:46,974
lf we are, then life is a dream.

868
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:17,212
lnstruments back online.

869
01:18:19,048 --> 01:18:24,052
lncredible. There is a power source
emanating from the planet

870
01:18:24,888 --> 01:18:26,889
like nothing I have ever seen.

871
01:18:31,936 --> 01:18:32,978
Sha'Ka'Ree.

872
01:18:33,062 --> 01:18:34,730
Qui'Tu.

873
01:18:35,231 --> 01:18:36,523
Vorta Vor.

874
01:18:38,568 --> 01:18:39,735
Eden.

875
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,583
About the ship. . .

876
01:18:55,084 --> 01:18:57,878
-The ship needs its captain.
-No special conditions?

877
01:18:58,588 --> 01:19:00,088
No conditions.

878
01:19:02,926 --> 01:19:04,885
What makes you think
l won't turn us around?

879
01:19:05,261 --> 01:19:07,763
Because you, too, must know.

880
01:19:12,936 --> 01:19:15,854
Well, if we're going to do it,
we're going to do it by the book.

881
01:19:15,939 --> 01:19:18,774
Mr Chekov, you take the conn.
Mr Sulu, standard orbital approach.

882
01:19:18,858 --> 01:19:22,736
Uhura, alert the shuttlecraft to stand by.

883
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:24,947
Sybok, Spock, Dr McCoy,
come with me.

884
01:19:25,031 --> 01:19:26,949
The rest of you remain onboard

885
01:19:27,283 --> 01:19:30,619
until l've determined
what it is we're dealing with.

886
01:19:31,287 --> 01:19:34,998
Well, don't just stand there.
God's a busy man.

887
01:20:25,091 --> 01:20:27,551
l am no longer in control of the craft.

888
01:21:04,881 --> 01:21:07,382
All right. We'll play it your way.

889
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:41,500
Amazing.

890
01:21:41,584 --> 01:21:43,752
The land. The sky.

891
01:21:44,962 --> 01:21:47,089
Just as I knew it would be.

892
01:22:33,636 --> 01:22:35,595
Scotty, you gotta see this.

893
01:22:36,013 --> 01:22:37,389
l don't have the time.

894
01:22:37,473 --> 01:22:39,891
The Captain told me
to get this transporter working,

895
01:22:39,976 --> 01:22:42,144
and l'm not about to let him down.

896
01:24:15,655 --> 01:24:17,864
We have travelled far

897
01:24:23,246 --> 01:24:24,621
by starship.

898
01:24:33,506 --> 01:24:35,924
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

899
01:24:38,427 --> 01:24:39,886
We have a. . .

900
01:24:51,274 --> 01:24:52,357
Sybok.

901
01:24:56,529 --> 01:24:57,946
Perhaps. . .

902
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:19,212
Brave sou¡s, we¡come.

903
01:27:26,053 --> 01:27:28,221
ls this the voice of God?

904
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:33,351
One voice, many faces.

905
01:27:45,906 --> 01:27:49,284
Does this better suit your expectations?

906
01:28:06,385 --> 01:28:08,011
It is I.

907
01:28:08,804 --> 01:28:13,141
The journey you undertook to reach me
couId not have been an easy one.

908
01:28:13,225 --> 01:28:16,644
lt was not. The Barrier stood
between us, but we breached it.

909
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,439
Magnificent.

910
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:23,109
You are the first to find me.

911
01:28:23,903 --> 01:28:26,654
We sought only your infinite wisdom.

912
01:28:27,031 --> 01:28:29,866
And how did you breach the Barrier?

913
01:28:30,534 --> 01:28:31,659
With a starship.

914
01:28:31,994 --> 01:28:33,453
This starship,

915
01:28:35,456 --> 01:28:39,834
couId it carry my wisdom
beyond the Barrier?

916
01:28:40,628 --> 01:28:42,420
lt could. Yes.

917
01:28:42,505 --> 01:28:45,173
Then I shaII make use of this starship.

918
01:28:45,257 --> 01:28:47,217
lt will be your chariot!

919
01:28:47,968 --> 01:28:49,177
Excuse me.

920
01:28:49,428 --> 01:28:53,098
It wiII carry my power
to every corner of creation.

921
01:28:53,182 --> 01:28:56,267
Excuse me.
l'd just like to ask a question.

922
01:28:58,354 --> 01:29:00,271
What does God need with a starship?

923
01:29:01,273 --> 01:29:03,191
Bring the ship cIoser.

924
01:29:03,776 --> 01:29:07,904
l said, what does God need
with a starship?

925
01:29:09,031 --> 01:29:11,950
-Jim, what are you doing?
-l'm asking a question.

926
01:29:12,451 --> 01:29:15,787
-Who is this creature?
-Who am l?

927
01:29:16,372 --> 01:29:21,251
-Don't you know? Aren't you God?
-He has his doubts.

928
01:29:21,961 --> 01:29:23,711
You doubt me?

929
01:29:24,171 --> 01:29:25,797
l seek proof.

930
01:29:25,881 --> 01:29:29,843
Jim, you don't ask the Almighty
for his lD.

931
01:29:30,594 --> 01:29:32,929
Then here is the proof you seek.

932
01:29:45,192 --> 01:29:47,944
-Why is God angry?
-Why?

933
01:29:48,696 --> 01:29:52,115
-Why have you done this to my friend?
-He doubts me.

934
01:29:52,658 --> 01:29:56,244
You have not answered his question.
What does God need with a starship?

935
01:30:06,463 --> 01:30:08,089
Do you doubt me?

936
01:30:13,929 --> 01:30:20,351
l doubt any God
who inflicts pain for his own pleasure.

937
01:30:20,686 --> 01:30:24,606
Stop! The God of Sha'Ka'Ree
would not do this.

938
01:30:25,608 --> 01:30:27,567
Sha'Ka'Ree?

939
01:30:28,402 --> 01:30:30,820
A vision you created.

940
01:30:34,617 --> 01:30:38,912
An eternity I've been imprisoned
in this pIace.

941
01:30:39,622 --> 01:30:41,206
The ship.

942
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:44,626
I must have the ship.

943
01:30:45,794 --> 01:30:50,465
Now, give me what I want.

944
01:30:50,549 --> 01:30:54,636
Sybok, this is not
the God of Sha'Ka'Ree,

945
01:30:55,638 --> 01:30:57,347
or any other God.

946
01:30:57,473 --> 01:31:01,184
l don't understand.
Reveal yourself to me.

947
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:15,281
What's wrong? Don't you Iike this face?
I have so many.

948
01:31:15,366 --> 01:31:17,909
But this one suits you best.

949
01:31:17,993 --> 01:31:21,371
No, no, it's not possible.

950
01:31:22,248 --> 01:31:24,624
Bring me the ship, or I wiII destroy you.

951
01:31:25,834 --> 01:31:29,837
-The ship.
-Bring it cIoser,

952
01:31:30,339 --> 01:31:34,884
so that I might join with it.

953
01:31:35,803 --> 01:31:37,512
Do it,

954
01:31:38,514 --> 01:31:45,520
or watch these puny things die horribIy.

955
01:31:50,442 --> 01:31:54,070
-What have I done?
-Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully.

956
01:31:54,446 --> 01:31:55,863
-Spock.
-Sybok.

957
01:31:55,948 --> 01:31:59,284
This is my doing.
This is my arrogance, my vanity.

958
01:31:59,368 --> 01:32:02,787
-Sybok, we must find a way. . .
-No! You must save yourselves.

959
01:32:02,871 --> 01:32:05,373
Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.

960
01:32:11,547 --> 01:32:14,132
-l couldn't help but notice your pain.
-My pain?

961
01:32:14,216 --> 01:32:16,551
lt runs deep. Share it with me.

962
01:32:21,724 --> 01:32:22,724
Enterprise, are you ready?

963
01:32:22,891 --> 01:32:25,560
ln firing position. Torpedo armed.

964
01:32:25,644 --> 01:32:28,229
But, Captain,
we're firing directly on your position.

965
01:32:28,355 --> 01:32:30,023
Send it down, Mr Chekov. Now!

966
01:32:38,949 --> 01:32:40,616
Run ! Go!

967
01:32:58,177 --> 01:32:59,344
Sybok.

968
01:33:06,268 --> 01:33:07,602
Let's get out of here.

969
01:33:11,023 --> 01:33:12,815
Sulu, l've lost them.

970
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:42,303
Spock, get us out of here.

971
01:33:53,941 --> 01:33:56,025
Thrusters are inoperative.

972
01:34:11,208 --> 01:34:13,918
-Mr Scott.
-Scotty here, sir.

973
01:34:14,002 --> 01:34:16,295
Please tell me
the transporter is working.

974
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:19,382
She's got partial power, sir.
l might be able to take two of you.

975
01:34:19,716 --> 01:34:21,843
Beam up Spock and Dr McCoy. Now.

976
01:34:22,344 --> 01:34:23,803
Now, just a damn minute.

977
01:34:29,184 --> 01:34:30,435
Thank you, Mr Scott.
Bring up the Captain.

978
01:34:30,519 --> 01:34:31,519
All right.

979
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:59,255
What about Jim?
We can't just leave him down there.

980
01:34:59,339 --> 01:35:02,133
Please get a grip on yourself, Doctor.
Status report.

981
01:35:02,217 --> 01:35:04,802
Klingon captain wishes
to name his terms, Mr Spock.

982
01:35:05,053 --> 01:35:06,471
On screen.

983
01:35:07,389 --> 01:35:10,349
This is Captain KIaa
of the KIingon Empire.

984
01:35:11,018 --> 01:35:13,728
Attempt to raise shieIds
or arm weapons,

985
01:35:14,313 --> 01:35:16,189
and I wiII destroy you.

986
01:35:16,273 --> 01:35:18,733
You are aIive for a singIe reason.

987
01:35:19,234 --> 01:35:21,777
The renegade James T. Kirk.

988
01:35:22,863 --> 01:35:25,656
Hand him over,
and I wiII spare your Iives.

989
01:35:27,075 --> 01:35:29,535
My transporter stands ready
to beam him aboard.

990
01:35:29,995 --> 01:35:33,247
-Captain Kirk is not among us.
-You Iie.

991
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:39,170
l'm a Vulcan. l'm incapable of lying.
Captain Kirk is on the planet below.

992
01:35:39,254 --> 01:35:40,963
Then give me his coordinates!

993
01:35:46,929 --> 01:35:49,764
General, I am in need
of your assistance.

994
01:35:49,848 --> 01:35:51,516
My assistance?

995
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:53,935
You are his superior officer.

996
01:35:54,603 --> 01:35:59,565
-l am a foolish old man.
-Damn you, sir. You will try.

997
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:10,409
KIingon Commander,
someone wishes to speak with you.

998
01:37:00,335 --> 01:37:02,628
So it's me you want,
you Klingon bastards.

999
01:37:03,672 --> 01:37:05,673
What are you waiting for?

1000
01:37:31,116 --> 01:37:32,742
Release him !

1001
01:37:32,826 --> 01:37:36,704
Kirk, my junior officer has something
he wants to say to you.

1002
01:37:42,961 --> 01:37:46,756
l apologise.

1003
01:37:54,222 --> 01:37:58,225
The attack upon your vessel
was not authorised by my government.

1004
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:03,314
Kirk, and now,

1005
01:38:03,398 --> 01:38:07,234
may I present our new gunner?

1006
01:38:16,578 --> 01:38:17,745
Spock?

1007
01:38:20,582 --> 01:38:22,458
Welcome aboard, Captain.

1008
01:38:29,424 --> 01:38:34,178
-l thought I was going to die.
-Not possible.

1009
01:38:34,846 --> 01:38:36,681
You were never alone.

1010
01:38:42,062 --> 01:38:45,314
Please, Captain,
not in front of the Klingons.

1011
01:39:06,378 --> 01:39:09,463
Would you care for a wee nip
of Scotch whisky?

1012
01:39:12,634 --> 01:39:15,386
l never thought l'd ever be drinking
with a Klingon.

1013
01:39:15,721 --> 01:39:17,847
What are you two conspiring about?

1014
01:39:17,931 --> 01:39:21,767
We were just saying how far we've
come in such a short space of time.

1015
01:39:21,852 --> 01:39:23,310
We certainly have.

1016
01:39:27,733 --> 01:39:29,775
She has wonderful muscles.

1017
01:39:47,711 --> 01:39:52,631
-Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?
-We were speculating.

1018
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:55,426
ls God really out there?

1019
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:01,015
Maybe he's not out there, Bones.

1020
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:04,769
Maybe he's right here.
Human heart.

1021
01:40:10,442 --> 01:40:14,111
-Spock?
-l was thinking of Sybok.

1022
01:40:15,197 --> 01:40:18,365
-l've lost a brother.
-Yes.

1023
01:40:22,037 --> 01:40:23,954
l lost a brother once.

1024
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:28,709
l was lucky. I got him back.

1025
01:40:31,713 --> 01:40:35,007
l thought you said
men like us don't have families.

1026
01:40:38,887 --> 01:40:40,387
l was wrong.

1027
01:41:00,617 --> 01:41:02,868
Are you just gonna sit there
and pluck that thing,

1028
01:41:02,953 --> 01:41:05,371
or are you gonna play something?

1029
01:41:12,504 --> 01:41:18,926
Row, row, row your boat
GentIy down the stream

1030
01:41:19,511 --> 01:41:22,763
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
-Row, row, row your boat

1031
01:41:22,848 --> 01:41:25,975
-Life is but a dream
-GentIy down the stream

1032
01:41:26,059 --> 01:41:29,144
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
-Row, row, row your boat

1033
01:41:29,229 --> 01:41:32,565
-GentIy down the stream
-Life is but a dream

1034
01:41:32,649 --> 01:41:35,651
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
-Row, row, row your boat

1035
01:41:35,735 --> 01:41:38,821
-GentIy down the stream
-Life is but a dream

1036
01:41:38,905 --> 01:41:42,032
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
-Row, row, row your boat
