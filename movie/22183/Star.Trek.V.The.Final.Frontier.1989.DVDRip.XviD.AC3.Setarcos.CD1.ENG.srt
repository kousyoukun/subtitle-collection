1
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:46,377
I thought weapons were forbidden
on this planet.

2
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,806
Besides...

3
00:01:55,055 --> 00:02:00,425
...I can't believe you'd kill me
for a field of empty holes.

4
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:05,129
It's all I have.

5
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:31,988
- Your pain runs deep.
- What do you know of my pain?

6
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:35,676
Let us explore it... together.

7
00:02:35,744 --> 00:02:39,077
Each man hides a secret pain.

8
00:02:39,154 --> 00:02:43,147
It must be exposed and reckoned with.

9
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:47,507
It must be dragged
from the darkness into the light.

10
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:52,178
Share your pain.
Share your pain with me.

11
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,341
And gain strength from the sharing.

12
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:16,134
Where did you get this power?

13
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,227
The power was within you.

14
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:31,133
It is as if a weight
has been lifted from my heart.

15
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:35,832
- How can I repay you?
- Join my quest.

16
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:41,163
- What is it you seek?
- What you seek.

17
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:49,628
What all men have sought
since time began.

18
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:53,086
The ultimate knowledge.

19
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:56,767
To find it we need a starship.

20
00:03:56,866 --> 00:04:00,893
A starship? There are
no starships on Nimbus III.

21
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:05,046
- I have a way to bring one here.
- But how?

22
00:04:08,863 --> 00:04:13,630
Have faith, my friend.
There are more of us than you know.

23
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:16,420
You're a Vulcan.

24
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:39,385
"You'll have a great time
on shore leave, Bones."

25
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:42,439
"You'll be able to relax."

26
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:46,852
You call this relaxing?
I'm a nervous wreck.

27
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,897
If I'm not careful,
I'll end up talking to myself.

28
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,987
Greetings, Captain.

29
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:13,813
- Spock, what are you doing here?
- I'm monitoring your progress.

30
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:18,546
I'm flattered, but of all the
points of interest here why pick me?

31
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:24,566
The record for climbing El Capitan
is in no danger of being broken.

32
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:29,003
I'm doing this because I enjoy it.

33
00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:33,644
Not to mention the most important
reason for climbing a mountain...

34
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:37,613
Because it's there.

35
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:41,590
I do not think you realise
the gravity of your situation.

36
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,467
On the contrary,
gravity is foremost on my mind.

37
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:53,589
I'm trying to make an ascent.
Go pester Dr McCoy.

38
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:58,389
Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.

39
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,825
Goddamn irresponsible!

40
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:06,031
Playing games with life.

41
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:09,936
Concentration is vital.
You must be one with the rock.

42
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:13,466
If you don't stop distracting me...

43
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:41,292
Perhaps "because it is there" is not
sufficient reason to climb a mountain.

44
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,359
I am hardly in a position to disagree.

45
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:48,744
Hi, Bones.
Mind if we drop in for dinner?

46
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:59,318
- I am Caithlin Dar.
- Yes! Our new Romulan representative.

47
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:05,686
Welcome to Paradise City, capital
of the Planet of Galactic Peace.

48
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:10,180
I'm St John Talbot, the Federation
Representative here on Nimbus III.

49
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,894
My charming companion
is the Klingon Consul, Korrd.

50
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:22,673
- I expect that's Klingon for hello.
- Come in, my dear.

51
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:44,534
20 years ago, our three governments
agreed to develop this planet.

52
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:50,102
- A new age was born.
- It died a quick death.

53
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:55,606
The settlers we conned into
coming here took to fighting.

54
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:59,440
We forbad them weapons,
but they fashioned their own.

55
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:02,674
It appears I've arrived just in time.

56
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:03,616
Get away from that transmitter.

57
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,577
Romulan.

58
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:15,532
Terran.

59
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,664
Klingon.

60
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:21,910
- Consider yourselves my prisoners.
- Prisoners?

61
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:26,605
We're already prisoners here
on this worthless lump of rock.

62
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:31,313
- What value could we be to you?
- Nimbus III <i>is</i> a worthless lump of rock.

63
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:36,853
But it is the only place in the galaxy
that has the three of you.

64
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:43,413
Our governments will stop at nothing
to ensure our safety.

65
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:46,382
That's exactly what I'm counting on.

66
00:14:56,118 --> 00:14:59,952
<i>USS Enterprise,</i>
<i>shakedown cruise report.</i>

67
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:04,981
<i>I think this new ship</i>
<i>was put together by monkeys.</i>

68
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:10,293
<i>Half the doors won't open, and guess</i>
<i>whosejob it is to make it right?</i>

69
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:12,693
Borgus frat!

70
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:18,675
"Let's see what she's got, Scotty."
We found out, didn't we?

71
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:23,508
- I know you'll whip her into shape.
- Uhura, I thought you were on leave.

72
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:29,346
- I thought we were going together.
- I can't leave her when she needs me.

73
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:34,078
I had a feeling you would
say something like that.

74
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,102
So I brought us dinner.

75
00:15:37,173 --> 00:15:42,236
You're the most understanding woman
I know.

76
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:46,737
<i>Red alert.</i>

77
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:50,798
I just fixed that damn thing!

78
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:53,394
Turn it off, will you?

79
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:56,653
<i>Red alert.</i>

80
00:15:56,725 --> 00:16:00,627
<i>This is a red alert.</i>
<i>Enterprise, acknowledge.</i>

81
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:05,462
This is Enterprise. Identify yourself.

82
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:11,925
<i>This is Starfleet. We have a Priority 7</i>
<i>situation in the Neutral Zone.</i>

83
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:15,656
- Scotty, this is for real.
- They can't be serious!

84
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:19,638
The ship's in pieces and
we've got less than a skeleton crew.

85
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:23,883
Starfleet, are you aware
of our current status?

86
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:30,554
<i>Yes. Stand by to copy operational</i>
<i>orders and recall key personnel.</i>

87
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:35,920
- Admit it, we're lost.
- Yes, but we're making good time.

88
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:41,173
- <i>Commander Sulu, come in.</i>
- I don't believe this.

89
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:43,403
Shore leave is cancelled.

90
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:48,725
- Rescued at last.
- <i>Return to prearranged coordinates.</i>

91
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:53,958
- You can't say we're lost.
- Is there a problem?

92
00:16:53,973 --> 00:17:00,208
Yes. We've been caught in... a blizzard.

93
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,717
We can't see a thing.
Direct us to the coordinates.

94
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:12,796
My visual says
sunny skies and 70 degrees.

95
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:19,427
Look, the sun has come out.
It's a miracle.

96
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:23,541
<i>Don't worry, your secret is safe</i>
<i>with me. I'll send the shuttle for you.</i>

97
00:17:23,606 --> 00:17:25,836
Uhura, I owe you one.

98
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:30,743
Come and get it!

99
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:33,466
Bones, knock it off.

100
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:36,685
We're right here and we're starving.

101
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:41,319
- Bipodal seeds, Doctor?
- Beans, Spock, but no ordinary beans.

102
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:45,667
These are from an old recipe
handed down to me by my father.

103
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:48,655
If you stick your Vulcan nose
up at these...

104
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:53,128
you're insulting
generations of McCoys.

105
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:58,238
In that case I have little choice
but to sample your beans.

106
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:09,813
Surprisingly good. It does have
a flavouring I'm not familiar with.

107
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:14,978
- That's the secret ingredient.
- Any more secret ingredient, Bones?

108
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:18,545
Be my guest.

109
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:25,205
- Your secret ingredient is alcohol?
- Tennessee whiskey.

110
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:29,301
Bourbon and beans, an explosive
combination. Can Spock handle it?

111
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:36,085
With that Vulcan metabolism,
he could eat a bowl of termites.

112
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:41,785
- Doctor, I am half human.
- It certainly doesn't show.

113
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,920
- Thank you.
- This guy never changes.

114
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:49,873
I insult him
and he takes it as a compliment.

115
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:57,685
- You two could drive a man to drink.
- What did I do?

116
00:18:57,685 --> 00:19:04,885
Human life is far too precious
to risk on crazy stunts.

117
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:10,453
You should have been killed
when you fell off that mountain.

118
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:13,251
It did cross my mind.

119
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,427
But even as I fell
I knew I wouldn't die.

120
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:21,845
- Isn't he the only one who's immortal?
- No, it isn't that.

121
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:26,901
I knew I wouldn't die
because the two of you were with me.

122
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:31,497
- I do not understand.
- I've always known...

123
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,271
...I'll die alone.

124
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:42,919
I'll call Valhalla and
reserve a room for you.

125
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:53,557
All that time in space,
getting on each other's nerves...

126
00:19:53,557 --> 00:20:00,053
So what do we do on shore leave?
We spend it together.

127
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:04,888
- Other people have families.
- Other people, not us.

128
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:13,783
What are you doing?

129
00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:17,643
I'm preparing to toast a "marsh melon".

130
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:24,149
I'll be damned! A marsh melon.
Where did you learn to do that?

131
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:31,125
I have familiarised myself with the
customs associated with camping out.

132
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:37,781
What do we do
after we toast the marsh melon?

133
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:42,869
- We consume them.
- No, I mean after that.

134
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:48,469
We are required to engage in a ritual
known as the sing-along.

135
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:53,397
I haven't sung around the campfire
since I was a boy in Iowa.

136
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:56,059
What are we going to sing?

137
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:59,448
- "Camptown Races".
- "Pack up your troubles".

138
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,569
- Are we leaving?
- It's a song title.

139
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:07,742
- "Moon over Rigel 7".
- "Row, row, row your boat".

140
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:12,361
- Do you know "Row your boat"?
- It didn't come up in my research.

141
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:15,169
The lyrics are very simple...

142
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:18,051
"Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream."

143
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:22,536
"Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream."

144
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:27,077
The Doctor and I will start off
and you jump in.

145
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:33,498
- Doctor, if you please.
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

146
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:53,077
- Spock, why didn't you jump in?
- I cannot comprehend the words.

147
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:59,829
It's a song, you green-blooded Vulcan.
The words aren't important.

148
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:05,734
- You just have a good time singing.
- I am sorry, Doctor.

149
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,625
- Were we having a good time?
- I liked him better before he died.

150
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:15,114
Let's just get some sleep.

151
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:28,439
- Captain...
- We're on leave. Call me Jim.

152
00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:30,869
- Jim...
- Yes, Spock?

153
00:22:30,964 --> 00:22:34,456
Life is not a dream.

154
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:38,476
- Go to sleep, Spock.
- Yes, Captain.

155
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:43,537
- Good night, Bones.
- Good night, Jim.

156
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:48,133
- Good night, Spock.
- Good night, Doctor.

157
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:52,242
- Good night, Spock.
- Good night, Jim.

158
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,874
I don't know. I just don't know.

159
00:24:40,597 --> 00:24:43,725
Get the damn light out of my face.

160
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,926
We had to send the shuttlecraft.

161
00:24:56,981 --> 00:25:00,178
The transporter is non-operational.

162
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:05,589
- We have received new orders.
- I had my communicator.

163
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,992
- You forgot to take it with you.
- I wonder why I did that.

164
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:15,910
It appears shore leave has been
cancelled. Pack out your trash.

165
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,933
"All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to steer her by."

166
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:54,630
- Melville.
- John Masefield.

167
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:59,669
- Are you sure about that?
- I'm well-versed in the classics.

168
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,501
Then how come you don't know
"Row, row, row your boat"?

169
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:17,445
- <i>Enterprise, you have control.</i>
- We're doing just fine.

170
00:26:51,829 --> 00:26:55,526
All I can say is, they don't make them
like they used to.

171
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:59,440
You told me you could have this ship
operational in two weeks.

172
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:02,706
I think you gave me too much time.

173
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:08,212
How many times do I have to tell you?
The right tool for the right job.

174
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:11,648
I've never seen him happier.

175
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,601
Bridge... I hope.

176
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,541
I could use a shower.

177
00:27:24,597 --> 00:27:26,861
Yes.

178
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:36,069
- Doesn't anything work on this ship?
- They can't send us out like this.

179
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,444
- Starfleet transmission on line.
- Put it on the view screen.

180
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:47,880
Can we have a little quiet, please?

181
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:56,078
Can you clear that up?

182
00:27:58,132 --> 00:28:01,624
Can we have a little quiet?

183
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:04,552
- Bob!
- <i>Jim!</i>

184
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:09,492
- <i>We are dressing informally.</i>
- I'm on my way to the shower.

185
00:28:09,492 --> 00:28:12,586
<i>I apologise for cancelling shore leave.</i>

186
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:16,722
<i>We have a dangerous situation</i>
<i>out on Nimbus III.</i>

187
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:19,692
On the Planet of Galactic Peace?

188
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:24,916
<i>A terrorist force</i>
<i>has captured the only settlement.</i>

189
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:29,148
<i>They've taken hostages. The Klingon,</i>
<i>the Romulan, the Federation Consuls.</i>

190
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:36,565
- <i>The Enterprise is not up to specs...</i>
- The Enterprise is a disaster.

191
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:41,264
- We have ships in the quadrant.
- <i>But no experienced commanders.</i>

192
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:44,466
- <i>I need Jim Kirk.</i>
- Please!

193
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:48,333
<i>Proceed to Nimbus III</i>
<i>and assess the situation.</i>

194
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:50,864
<i>Avoid a confrontation.</i>

195
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:54,924
<i>Above all, however,</i>
<i>get those hostages back safely.</i>

196
00:28:54,964 --> 00:29:00,405
- Have the Klingons responded?
- <i>No, but you can bet they will.</i>

197
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:06,165
- Plot a course for Nimbus III, Mr Sulu.
- Course plotted.

198
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:09,760
I'm afraid the ship's problems
will have to be solved en route.

199
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:15,092
I'm counting on each one of you
to give his best. Let's go to work.

200
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:19,426
Jim, if you ask me, and you haven't...

201
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:23,437
I think this is a terrible idea.
We're bound to bump into the Klingons.

202
00:29:23,476 --> 00:29:27,640
- And they don't exactly like you.
- The feeling's mutual.

203
00:29:27,668 --> 00:29:32,071
Engine room, we'll need all the power
you can muster, mister.

204
00:29:32,085 --> 00:29:37,076
We'll beat those Klingon devils
even if I have to get out and push.

205
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:40,102
I hope it won't come to that.

206
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:43,704
- All possible speed, Mr Sulu.
- Aye, sir.

207
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:53,301
- What's the matter?
- I miss my old chair.

208
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,056
Captain's log: Stardate 84...

209
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,837
Captain's log: Stardate 84...

210
00:30:42,356 --> 00:30:45,951
- <i>Good morning, Captain.</i>
- Forget it.

211
00:30:46,036 --> 00:30:52,500
- We have the hostage information.
- Put it on the screen.

212
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,995
<i>This is an authorised transmission</i>
<i>from the Starfleet memory bank.</i>

213
00:30:58,804 --> 00:31:05,140
- Not General Korrd!
- He's apparently fallen from favour.

214
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,228
Korrd's military strategies were
required learning at the Academy.

215
00:31:10,228 --> 00:31:14,927
When they put me out to pasture,
I hope I fair better than Korrd.

216
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,576
This must be the hostage tape.

217
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:26,109
<i>A short time ago, we surrendered</i>
<i>to the Galactic Army of Light.</i>

218
00:31:27,476 --> 00:31:31,003
<i>We are now in the protective custody</i>
<i>of their leader.</i>

219
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,826
<i>We will be treated humanely</i>
<i>as long as we cooperate.</i>

220
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:40,981
<i>He requests that you send a starship</i>
<i>to parley for our release at once.</i>

221
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:46,214
<i>We are in good health and would</i>
<i>appreciate your immediate response.</i>

222
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,123
<i>I regret this desperate act,</i>
<i>but these are desperate times.</i>

223
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:57,700
<i>I mean no harm to these innocents,</i>
<i>but do not put me to the test.</i>

224
00:31:57,717 --> 00:32:02,745
<i>I implore you to respond immediately.</i>

225
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,008
What is it?

226
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:24,039
- You look like you've seen a ghost.
- Perhaps I have, Captain.

227
00:32:48,308 --> 00:32:52,711
Spock, what is it?
Do you know this Vulcan?

228
00:32:52,724 --> 00:32:56,023
- I cannot be certain.
- But he does seem familiar?

229
00:32:56,084 --> 00:32:59,713
He reminds me of someone
I knew in my youth.

230
00:32:59,764 --> 00:33:05,556
- I didn't know you had one.
- I do not often think of the past.

231
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:11,381
- Who does he remind you of?
- A gifted young student.

232
00:33:11,381 --> 00:33:15,477
He possessed a great intelligence.

233
00:33:16,372 --> 00:33:22,037
It was assumed that he would
join the great scholars of Vulcan.

234
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:25,438
- But he was a revolutionary.
- What do you mean?

235
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:30,191
The knowledge he sought
was forbidden by Vulcan belief.

236
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:35,316
- Forbidden?
- He rejected his logical upbringing.

237
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:39,685
He embraced the animal passions
of our ancestors.

238
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:46,740
He believed the key to self-knowledge
was emotion... not logic.

239
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,198
Imagine that, a passionate Vulcan.

240
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:55,924
When he encouraged others to follow
him, he was banished from Vulcan.

241
00:33:55,924 --> 00:33:58,085
Fascinating.

242
00:33:58,228 --> 00:34:01,891
- <i>Captain to the bridge.</i>
- On my way.

243
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:09,901
- Spock?
- Coming, Captain.

244
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:21,356
- Approaching Nimbus III.
- Standard orbit, Mr Sulu.

245
00:34:22,421 --> 00:34:28,084
Paradise City is demanding
to know our intentions.

246
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:32,384
Respond with static.
Let them think we're having difficulty.

247
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:37,556
Paradise City, we are barely
receiving your transmission.

248
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:44,340
- Transporter room, status.
- Transporter is still inoperative.

249
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:50,040
If we <i>could</i> lock on to the hostages,
we couldn't beam them up.

250
00:34:51,444 --> 00:34:55,403
- We'll have to get them out ourselves.
- Klingon vessel approaching.

251
00:34:55,444 --> 00:34:58,936
Bird of Prey.
1.9 hours till her weapons are in range.

252
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:01,997
Damn! Let's go.

253
00:35:21,044 --> 00:35:24,377
Their scanning equipment
is primitive, but effective.

254
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:29,300
- Land at coordinate 856.3.
- That's far from the city.

255
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,567
- We cannot risk detection.
- Mr Sulu, execute.

256
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,791
- <i>This is the starship Enterprise.</i>
- A Federation starship.

257
00:35:48,628 --> 00:35:54,324
<i>This is Captain Pavel Chekov.</i>
<i>You are in violation of our treaty.</i>

258
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:58,226
<i>Release your hostages at once</i>
<i>or suffer the consequences.</i>

259
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,752
Your threats amuse me.
What consequences?

260
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:29,044
<i>A Klingon warship</i>
<i>will arrive within the hour.</i>

261
00:36:29,044 --> 00:36:34,311
- The Klingons will be quite angry.
- <i>They are likely to destroy the planet.</i>

262
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:38,556
Then it is fortunate I have you
and your starship to protect me.

263
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:44,340
You and your first officer
are to beam down to my coordinates.

264
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:50,745
<i>We will be happy to beam down,</i>
<i>but we must have certain assurances.</i>

265
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,317
At foot speed the journey
to the city will take 1.2 hours.

266
00:36:57,364 --> 00:37:00,891
We don't have 1.2 hours.

267
00:37:00,948 --> 00:37:06,477
Wait a minute... Perfect!
We'll have to get their attention.

268
00:37:22,036 --> 00:37:24,504
What's that?

269
00:37:29,844 --> 00:37:33,143
Is she naked?

270
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,965
Hello, boys.

271
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,031
I've always wanted to play
to a captive audience.

272
00:38:24,116 --> 00:38:28,951
- Spock, be one with the horse.
- Yes, Captain.

273
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:36,066
Open the gate.
It's our lookout party.

274
00:38:38,548 --> 00:38:42,211
Federation soldiers are right behind us.
Close the gate.

275
00:38:50,644 --> 00:38:52,908
Where are they going?

276
00:38:53,012 --> 00:38:56,539
- Spock...
- Hold your horse, I'm scanning.

277
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:06,582
The hostages are being held
in that structure.

278
00:39:08,372 --> 00:39:10,704
Galileo, start your run.

279
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:18,577
Phasers on stun.
Sulu, take out that light.

280
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:37,107
- What's going on?
- <i>Surrender, you are under attack.</i>

281
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:41,601
- It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
- <i>Wait! Come back.</i>

282
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:28,603
- Uhura, come on down.
- Roger, coming in.

283
00:41:12,212 --> 00:41:18,515
<i>Nimbus III is famous for its wildlife,</i>
<i>and the fishing is terrific!</i>

284
00:41:18,515 --> 00:41:22,747
<i>Easy financing through</i>
<i>Federation Federal can take you there.</i>

285
00:41:22,803 --> 00:41:26,739
- Thank God.
- Please cooperate.

286
00:41:26,803 --> 00:41:29,499
Hand over your weapons.

287
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:35,470
Well done, my friends.

288
00:42:11,188 --> 00:42:13,486
<i>Qual se tu?</i>

289
00:42:14,996 --> 00:42:16,964
Spock!

290
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:29,212
Spock, it's me.

291
00:42:29,268 --> 00:42:34,205
It's Sybok.
You've finally caught up with me.

292
00:42:36,627 --> 00:42:39,494
Don't you have anything to say to me?

293
00:42:41,556 --> 00:42:48,120
You are under arrest for 17 violations
of the Neutral Zone Treaty.

294
00:42:58,388 --> 00:43:03,796
- You've developed a sense of humour.
- I did not intend to amuse you.

295
00:43:03,796 --> 00:43:09,940
These are serious charges.
However, if you surrender now...

296
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:15,708
I'm sorry, Spock, I'm not through
violating the Neutral Zone Treaty.

297
00:43:17,555 --> 00:43:22,254
In fact, I'm just getting started.
For my next violation...

298
00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:26,127
I intend to steal something.

299
00:43:26,164 --> 00:43:29,224
Something very big.

300
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:33,569
Your starship.

301
00:43:33,716 --> 00:43:37,709
You staged all this
to get your hands on my ship?

302
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:42,867
- Who are you?
- Captain James T. Kirk.

303
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:49,500
I thought Captain Chekov...
I see... very clever, Captain.

304
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:56,553
Spock, you have been given
a second chance to join me.

305
00:43:57,683 --> 00:44:03,604
- I am a Starfleet officer.
- Of course.

306
00:44:03,604 --> 00:44:07,836
Of course. Then I'll take the ship
without your help.

307
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:30,964
- Shuttle en route.
- Position of Bird of Prey?

308
00:44:34,419 --> 00:44:36,080
Closing!

309
00:45:04,052 --> 00:45:10,068
- The Bird of Prey must have cloaked.
- Raise shields.

310
00:45:10,068 --> 00:45:13,469
- The shuttle?
- Do it. Go to red alert.

311
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:28,819
Once we control your vessel,
we'll bring up our followers.

312
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:32,720
The Klingons are out there.
We'll be lucky to make it to the ship.

313
00:45:32,756 --> 00:45:35,520
<i>This is Enterprise, red alert.</i>

314
00:45:35,603 --> 00:45:39,061
<i>Bird of Prey approaching.</i>
<i>Raising shields.</i>

315
00:45:39,156 --> 00:45:42,148
Find a safe harbour.

316
00:45:43,316 --> 00:45:45,807
No!

317
00:45:47,123 --> 00:45:50,889
No reply. Remain on course.

318
00:45:50,932 --> 00:45:55,266
Listen to me. In order for this
craft to enter the landing bay...

319
00:45:55,284 --> 00:45:59,812
Enterprise must lower the shields
and activate the tractor beam.

320
00:45:59,828 --> 00:46:05,011
- To re-raise the shields will take...
- 15.5 seconds.

321
00:46:05,011 --> 00:46:09,311
An eternity, during which
we'll be vulnerable to attack.

322
00:46:09,332 --> 00:46:15,293
He speaks the truth. If my people
are cloaked, then they intend to strike.

323
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:21,812
- We cannot turn back.
- Let me do something.

324
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:26,579
Very well, do what you must,
but no more.

325
00:46:33,107 --> 00:46:36,133
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

326
00:46:41,268 --> 00:46:46,501
Understand your situation.
Are unable to return to planet.

327
00:46:46,516 --> 00:46:52,751
Stand by to execute
emergency landing plan... B.

328
00:46:55,635 --> 00:47:03,599
- Emergency landing plan B?
- <i>B as in barricade.</i>

329
00:47:06,868 --> 00:47:09,860
What are you doing?

330
00:47:09,939 --> 00:47:15,002
In order to lower and raise the shields
quickly, we'll forego the tractor beam.

331
00:47:15,027 --> 00:47:17,996
We'll fly her in manually.

332
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:23,663
- How often have you done this?
- Actually, it's my first attempt.

333
00:47:25,459 --> 00:47:29,486
He's good... really.

334
00:47:33,683 --> 00:47:35,878
Scotty, open bay doors.

335
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:48,706
Scotty, lower shields.

336
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:51,820
Lowering shields.

337
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:04,325
- Bird of Prey bearing 105.2.
- Go, Sulu.

338
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:22,456
They're in.

339
00:48:26,643 --> 00:48:28,611
Warp speed now!

340
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,966
We must change course at once.

341
00:49:29,972 --> 00:49:32,907
I'll take you to the bridge.

342
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:09,781
Pick it up.

343
00:50:15,635 --> 00:50:19,127
Sybok...

344
00:50:19,188 --> 00:50:21,520
You must surrender.

345
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:27,925
No!

346
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:33,353
- You must kill me.
- Shoot him!

347
00:50:43,827 --> 00:50:48,059
For a moment...
I thought you might actually do it.

348
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,399
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.

349
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:08,307
Spock, you will accompany me
to the bridge?

350
00:51:08,307 --> 00:51:13,244
No... I will not.

351
00:51:15,123 --> 00:51:18,092
You know I'm right.

352
00:51:23,156 --> 00:51:27,183
Then you must join them.

353
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:50,611
- These two will be useful.
- Give us a moment alone.

354
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:53,546
Don't be afraid.

355
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:13,747
Goddamn it, Spock.
You betrayed us all.

356
00:52:13,747 --> 00:52:16,739
I do not expect you to forgive me.

357
00:52:16,819 --> 00:52:20,653
- I ought to knock you on your ass.
- If you think it would help.

358
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:25,094
- You want me to hold him?
- Stay out of this... Why?

359
00:52:25,107 --> 00:52:29,203
- All you had to do was pull the trigger.
- Then Sybok would be dead.

360
00:52:29,235 --> 00:52:32,671
- I ordered you to defend your ship.
- And kill my brother.

361
00:52:32,892 --> 00:52:40,028
- A fellow Vulcan is not a...
- Sybok also is a son of Sarek.

362
00:52:40,028 --> 00:52:44,465
He's your brother brother?
You made that up.

363
00:52:44,508 --> 00:52:49,596
- I did not.
- You don't have a brother.

364
00:52:49,596 --> 00:52:53,896
- Technically I don't have a brother.
- See?

365
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:59,081
- I have a half-brother.
- I've got to sit down.

366
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:05,446
You and Sybok have the same father
but different mothers?

367
00:53:05,468 --> 00:53:12,092
Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess,
but we were raised as brothers.

368
00:53:12,092 --> 00:53:19,260
- Why didn't you tell us this before?
- It is a personal matter.

369
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,959
- For that I am sorry.
- That makes everything all right. Sorry!

370
00:53:23,964 --> 00:53:28,094
Spock could no more kill
his own brother than he could kill you.

371
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:33,852
He's already in the brig. Besides,
we've got bigger problems to deal with.

372
00:53:33,852 --> 00:53:36,844
Like how do we get out of here.

373
00:53:36,924 --> 00:53:40,451
I'll say one thing,
you never cease to amaze me.

374
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,839
Nor I myself.

375
00:53:48,924 --> 00:53:55,388
- I was beginning to worry.
- It's all right. Sybok will explain.

376
00:53:55,388 --> 00:53:59,085
- What are you doing?
- Plotting our new course.

377
00:53:59,132 --> 00:54:01,896
You have no authority.
