5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,280
我以为在这个星球上是禁止使用武器的
I thought weapons were forbidden on this planet.

6
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,910
再说了...
Besides...

7
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:07,840
...我不相信你会为了这片荒地而把我杀了
..I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.

8
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,380
这是我唯一拥有的
It's all I have.

9
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,170
你的内心非常痛苦  关于我的痛苦你知道些什么?
Your pain runs deep. What do you know of my pain?

10
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,550
让我们...  一起来探索
Let us explore it...together.

11
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,930
每个人心中都隐藏着一种神秘的痛苦
Each man hides a secret pain.

12
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,140
我们必须揭开它的面纱  正视它
It must be exposed and reckoned with.

13
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,980
我们必须把它从黑暗拽进光明
It must be dragged from the darkness into the light.

14
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,650
分享你的痛苦  让我分享你的痛苦
Share your pain. Share your pain with me

15
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,910
并从分享之中获得力量
and gain strength from the sharing.

16
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,480
你从哪里获得这种能力的?
Where did you get this power?.

17
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,820
这种能力就在你心中
The power was within you.

18
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,000
我感觉如释重负
It is as if a weight has been lifted from my heart.

19
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,000
我可以怎么报答你?  加入我的探寻之旅
How can I repay you? Join my quest.

20
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,130
你在探寻什么?  就是你所探寻的
What is it you seek?. What you seek.

21
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,980
自从世界起源以来人们一直在探寻的
What all men have sought since time began.

22
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,070
终极的学识
The ultimate knowledge.

23
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,490
我们需要一艘星舰才能去探寻
To find it we need a starship.

24
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,040
星舰?  祥云III星球上没有星舰
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus Ill.

25
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,290
我有办法弄一艘来  什么办法?
I have a way to bring one here. But how?.

26
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,390
要有信心  我的朋友  
Have faith, my friend.

27
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,090
我们有很多人  比你知道的多得多
There are more of us than you know.

28
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,100
你是个瓦肯人
You're a Vulcan.

29
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:12,100
星际迷航5:  终极先锋

30
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,100
约塞米蒂国家公园  地球

31
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,100
星历8454.1

32
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,860
你会在登陆假期中玩得很愉快的  老骨头
'You'll have a great time on shore leave, Bones."

33
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,860
你可以好好放松放松
'You'll be able to relax."

34
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:11,490
你把这叫做放松?  我紧张得要命呢
You call this relaxing? I'm a nervous wreck.

35
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,960
如果不注意点  我可能会疯掉的
If I'm not careful, I'll end up talking to myself.

36
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,690
你好  舰长
Greetings, Captain.

37
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,940
史波克  你在这儿干嘛?  我在监视你的进展
Spock, what are you doing here? I'm monitoring your progress.

38
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,260
我真是受宠若惊 
I'm flattered,

39
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,420
但公园里有这么多有趣的景点  
 but of all the points of interest here

40
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,910
为什么偏偏到我这儿来?
why pick me?

41
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,170
埃尔卡普坦峰的攀登纪录是无人能破的
The record for climbing EI Capitan is in no danger of being broken.

42
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,460
我这么做是因为我喜欢爬山
I'm doing this because I enjoy it.

43
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,640
更不用说最重要的原因...  什么原因?
Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...

44
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,810
因为山在你面前
Because it's there.

45
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,020
我不认为你意识到了自己现在有多危险
I do not think you realise the gravity of your situation.

46
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,110
恰恰相反  危险性是我最关心的问题
On the contrary, gravity is foremost on my mind.

47
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,160
我要继续往上爬了  你去找麦考依医生唠叨吧
I'm trying to make an ascent. Go pester Dr McCoy.

48
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,420
麦考依医生现在心情不好
Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.

49
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,380
不负责任的混蛋!
Goddamn irresponsible...!

50
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,470
简直是玩命
Playing games with life.

51
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,230
一定要集中精力  你必须人石合一
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.

52
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,150
如果你继续烦我的话...
If you don't stop distracting me...

53
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,180
也许山在你面前这个爬山理由并不充分
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason to climb a mountain.

54
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,400
我不得不同意你的说法
I am hardly in a position to disagree.

55
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,780
嗨  老骨头  一起吃晚饭吧?
Hi, Bones. Mind if we drop in for dinner?.

56
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,740
祥云III星球  天堂城

57
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,280
先生们  我叫凯瑟琳・达尔
I am Caithlin Dar.

58
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:31,490
对!  罗幕兰的新代表
Yes! Our new Romulan representative.

59
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:38,210
欢迎来到天堂城  银河和平之星的首都
Welcome to Paradise City, capital of the Planet of Galactic Peace.

60
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,630
我是圣约翰・陶博特  祥云III星球的联邦代表
I'm St John Talbot, the Federation Representative here on Nimbus Ill.

61
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,220
我的这位富有魅力的伙伴是克林贡领事  考德
My charming companion is the Klingon Consul, Korrd.

62
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,820
我猜这就是克林贡人打招呼的方式  请进  亲爱的
I expect that's Klingon for hello. Come in, my dear.

63
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,800
20年前  我们三族政府共同商定开发这个星球
20 years ago, our three governments agreed to develop this planet.

64
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,190
一个新时代由此诞生了  但很快就结束了
A new age was born. It died a quick death.

65
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,110
被我们骗到这里的移民很快变得好斗起来
The settlers we conned into coming here took to fighting.

66
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,240
我们没收了他们的武器  但他们却开始自行制造
We forbad them weapons, but they fashioned their own.

67
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,580
看来我来得正是时候
It appears I've arrived just in time.

68
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,990
离那发报机远点
Get away from that transmitter.

69
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,540
罗幕兰人
Romulan.

70
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,550
地球人
Terran.

71
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,680
克林贡人
Klingon.

72
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,180
你们已成为我的俘虏  俘虏?
Consider yourselves my prisoners. Prisoners?

73
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,810
我们早已成为这片荒土的俘虏
We're already prisoners here on this worthless lump of rock.

74
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,650
我们对你有什么价值?  祥云III星球是一片荒土
What value could we be to you? Nimbus Ill is a worthless lump of rock.

75
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:15,910
但整个银河系也只有这地方  会同时出现你们三个
But it is the only place in the galaxy that has the three of you.

76
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,670
我们的政府会不惜一切代价保护我们的
Our governments will stop at nothing to ensure our safety.

77
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,800
这正是我所期望的
That's exactly what I'm counting on.

78
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,690
USS  进取号试航报告
USS Enterprise, shakedown cruise report.

79
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,110
我想这船是猴子们组装起来的
I think this new ship was put togetherbymonkeys.

80
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,700
有半数的门开不了  猜猜谁来做修理工作?
Halfthe doors won't open, and guess whosejob itis to make itright?

81
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,830
混蛋!
Borgus frat!

82
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,160
让我们看看她有些什么能耐  
"Let's see what she's got,

83
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,300
史考提  我们都看到了  对吧?
 Scotty." We found out, didn't we?

84
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,150
我相信你一定能把她驯服的  
I know you'll whip her into shape.

85
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,010
乌拉我以为你休假去了
 Uhura, I thought you were on leave.

86
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,290
我想我们应该一起去休假的  
I thought we were going together.

87
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,980
进取号需要我的时候我是不会离开她的
 I can't leave her when she needs me.

88
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,320
我就知道你会这么说的
I had a feeling you would say something like that.

89
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,150
所以我把晚餐带来了
So I brought us dinner.

90
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,870
你是我认识的最善解人意的女人
You're the most understanding woman I know.

91
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,460
红色警报
Red alert.

92
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,880
我刚修好那该死的东西!
I just fixed that damn thing!

93
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,380
关掉它  行吗?
Turn it off, will you?

94
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,840
红色警报
Red alert.

95
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,770
这是红色警报  进取号  收到请回答
This is a red alert. Enterprise, acknowledge.

96
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,190
这里是进取号  请说明你的身份
This is Enterprise. Identify yourself.

97
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,990
这里是星际舰队  在中立区出现7级优先情况
This is Starfleet. We have a Priority 7 situation in the NeutraIZone.

98
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,750
史考提  这是来真的  不会吧!
Scotty, this is for real. They can't be serious!

99
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,080
这船现在七零八落的而且主要船员也没到齐
The ship's in pieces and we've got less than a skeleton crew.

100
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,420
星际舰队  知道我们当前的状况吗?
Starfleet, are you aware of our current status?

101
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:13,220
知道  准备接收行动命令并召回主要船员
Yes. Stand by to copy operational orders and recall key personnel.

102
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,690
承认吧  我们迷路了  对  但我们仍在加速前进
Admit it, we're lost. Yes, but we're making good time.

103
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:25,490
苏鲁中校  请回答  真难以置信
Commander Sulu, come in. I don't believe this.

104
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,950
登陆假期取消了
Shore leave is cancelled.

105
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,120
咱终于有救了  返回预定位置
Rescued at last. Return to pre-arranged co-ordinates.

106
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,920
你不能说我们迷路了  有问题吗?
You can't say we're lost. Is there a problem?

107
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:45,300
对  我们遇到了...  一场暴风雪
Yes. We've been caught in...a blizzard.

108
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,020
我们什么也看不见  请给我们指明方向
We can't see a thing. Direct us to the co-ordinates.

109
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:58,610
我这里显示天气晴朗  气温华氏70度
My visual says sunny skies and 70 degrees.

110
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,330
苏鲁看  太阳出来了  真是奇迹
Look, the sun has come out. It's a miracle.

111
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,590
别担心  我会保守你们这个秘密的  我会用穿梭机接你们
Don't worry, your secretis safe with me. I'll send the shuttle foryou.

112
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,000
乌拉  我欠你一个人情
Uhura, I owe you one.

113
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,720
快过来吃吧!
Come and get it!

114
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,720
老骨头  快别敲了
Bones, knock it off.

115
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,350
我们就在这儿而且饿死了
We're right here and we're starving.

116
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,990
彼泼德种子  医生?  豆子 
Bipodal seeds, Doctor?.

117
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,070
史波克  但不是普通豆子
Beans, Spock, but no ordinary beans.

118
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,660
这是根据我父亲传给我的一个  古老食谱做出来的
These are from an old recipe handed down to me by my father.

119
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,700
如果你把你的瓦肯鼻子贴着这些...
If you stick your Vulcan nose up at these,

120
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,370
你真是麦考依家族中出言不逊的一代
you're insulting generations of McCoys.

121
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,670
这样的话我只好尝尝你的豆子了
In that case I have little choice but to sample your beans.

122
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,690
真是不错  它的确有一种我不熟悉的配料
Surprisingly good. It does have a flavouring I'm not familiar with.

123
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,990
那可是秘密配料  还有其他秘密配料吗  老骨头?
That's the secret ingredient. Any more secret ingredient, Bones?

124
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,160
请自便
Be my guest.

125
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:14,000
你的秘密配料就是酒?  威士忌  田纳西威士忌
Your secret ingredient is alcohol? Tennessee whiskey.

126
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,380
威士忌和豆子  真是劲爆组合  史波克能搞定它吗?
Bourbon and beans, an explosive combination. Can Spock handle it?

127
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,670
你开玩笑  以瓦肯人的新陈代谢能力
With that Vulcan metabolism,

128
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,300
一碗白蚁他也吃得下
 he could eat a bowl of termites.

129
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:32,690
医生  我一半是人类  根本看不出来
Doctor, I am half-human. It certainly doesn't show.

130
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,610
谢谢  这家伙总是这样
Thank you. This guy never changes.

131
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,490
我取笑他  他却以为我在赞美他
I insult him and he takes it as a compliment.

132
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:47,880
你们两个真令人头疼  我怎么了?
You two could drive a man to drink. What did I do?

133
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:55,220
人的生命是那么宝贵  怎么可以那么疯狂地冒险呢?
Human life is far too precious to risk on crazy stunts.

134
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,930
你从那山上摔下来时会死的
You should have been killed when you fell off that mountain.

135
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,020
我确实想过这个
It did cross my mind.

136
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,400
但我知道即使摔下来我也不会死的
But even as I fell I knew I wouldn't die.

137
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,950
不是只有他才是永生的吗?  不  不是说这个
Isn't he the only one who's immortal? No, it isn't that.

138
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,120
我知道自己不会死是因为我有你们两个相伴
I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.

139
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,840
我不明白  我一直都知道...
I do not understand. I've always known...

140
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,090
...我会孤独地死去
..l'll die alone.

141
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,020
我会在瓦尔哈拉殿堂给你订个房间的
I'll call Valhalla and reserve a room for you.

142
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,280
到时候我们一起在太空  不断地相互打趣...
All that time in space, getting on each others nerves...

143
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:52,710
那么登陆假期时我们干什么呢?  我们一起度假
So what do we do on shore leave? We spend it together.

144
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,960
其他人都有家庭  其他人  我们没有
Other people have families. Other people, not us.

145
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,390
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

146
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,400
我准备烤一个沼泽甜瓜
I'm preparing to toast a "marsh melon".

147
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:18,070
真有你的!  沼泽甜瓜  你哪里学来的?
I'll be damned! A marsh melon. Where did you learn to do that?

148
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:25,370
我了解过野营方面的一些习俗
I have familiarised myself with the customs associated with camping out.

149
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:32,300
我们烤完沼泽甜瓜之后干什么?
What do we do after we toast the marsh melon?

150
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:37,600
吃掉它们  不  我是说在那以后
We consume them. No, I mean after that.

151
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:44,230
我们应该进行一个叫作大伙齐欢唱的仪式
We are required to engage in a ritual known as the sing-along.

152
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,700
自从我还是个爱荷华州的小男孩以来  
I haven't sung around the campfire

153
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,320
一直没有再绕着篝火唱过歌了
since I was a boy in lowa.

154
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,240
我们唱什么呢?
What are we going to sing?

155
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,410
康城赛马  收拾起你的烦恼
"Camptown Races." "Pack up your troubles."

156
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,790
我们要走了吗?  这是一首歌的名字
Are we leaving? It's a song title.

157
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,830
莱久7星球上的月亮  划呀划  来划船
"Moon over Rigel 7." "Row, row, row your boat."

158
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:08,220
你知道《划呀划  来划船》吗?  我没研究过它
Do you know "Row your boat"? It didn't come up in my research.

159
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,890
歌词很简单...
The lyrics are very simple...

160
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,270
划呀划  来划船  缓缓地顺流而下
"Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream.

161
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,580
欢快地  欢快地  欢快地  欢快地划 
"Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,

162
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,810
人生只是一场梦
life is but a dream."

163
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,530
医生和我先唱  然后你加入进来
The Doctor and I will start off and you jump in.

164
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:29,950
医生  你先请  别说我没警告过你（我唱不好）
Doctor, if you please. Don't say I didn't warn you.

165
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,900
史波克  你为什么不加入进来?  我不理解歌词
Spock, why didn't you jump in? I cannot comprehend the words.

166
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:57,700
这只是首歌  你这个绿血的瓦肯人  歌词并不重要
It's a song, you green-blooded Vulcan. The words aren't important.

167
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,620
你只要唱得高兴就够了  对不起  医生
You just have a good time singing. I am sorry, Doctor.

168
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,500
我们唱歌的时候很高兴吗?  我比较喜欢死而复生之前的他
Were we having a good time? I liked him better before he died.

169
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,800
我们还是睡觉吧
Let's just get some sleep.

170
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,480
舰长...  我们在休假  叫我吉姆
Captain... We're on leave. Call me Jim.

171
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,990
吉姆...  什么事  史波克?
Jim... Yes, Spock?.

172
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,740
人生不是一场梦
Life is not a dream.

173
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,290
睡觉吧  史波克  是  舰长
Go to sleep, Spock. Yes, Captain.

174
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,250
晚安  老骨头  晚安  吉姆
Good night, Bones. Good night, Jim.

175
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,050
晚安  史波克  晚安  医生
Good night, Spock. Good night, Doctor.

176
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,430
晚安  史波克  晚安  吉姆
Good night, Spock. Good night, Jim.

177
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,230
我不明白  我就是不明白
I don't know. I just don't know.

178
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,050
卡拉舰长  发现一个古老的深空探测卫星
Captain Klaa, we have the target in sight. A probe ofancient origin.

179
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,480
很难摧毁吗?  很难
Difflcult to hit? Most difflcult.

180
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,560
好  所有武器由我控制
Good. All weapons atmy control.

181
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,860
观察镜
Scope.

182
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,520
射击太空垃圾不足以考验战士的勇气
Shooting space garbage is no test ofa warrior's mettle.

183
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,360
我需要一个会还击的目标
I need a target thatfilghts back.

184
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,360
舰长  收到新资料  祥云III星球有人被劫持
Captain, new data, hostages on Nimbus Ill.

185
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,580
其中一个是克林贡人  其他的呢?
One ofthe hostages is a Klingon. And the others?

186
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,170
一个地球人和一个罗幕兰人
A Terran and a Romulan.

187
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,010
联邦一定会派出星舰营救他们
The Federation will be sending a rescue ship ofits own.

188
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,390
设定航线前往祥云III星球
Plot course forNimbus Ill.

189
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,110
我一直想跟联邦星舰交手
I've always wanted to engage a Federation ship.

190
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,580
那该死的光别照我脸上
Get the damn light out of my face.

191
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,640
我们只能用穿梭机过来
We had to send the shuttlecraft.

192
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,810
传送机还无法运作
The transporter is non-operational.

193
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:11,610
我们收到了新命令  我带着通讯器呢
We have received new orders. I had my communicator.

194
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,280
你忘带了  真不知道我怎么会忘的
You forgot to take it with you. I wonder why I did that.

195
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,250
看来登陆假期取消了  收拾下垃圾
It appears shore leave has been cancelled. Pack out your trash.

196
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:58,710
我只渴望要一艘高大的船  以及一颗引航的星星相伴
"All I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by."

197
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,590
麦尔维尔  约翰・梅斯菲尔德
Melville. John Masefield.

198
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,760
你确定?  我十分精通经典作品
Are you sure about that? I'm well-versed in the classics.

199
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:12,100
那你怎么会不知道《划呀划  来划船》?
Then how come you don't know "Row, row, row your boat"?

200
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,620
进取号  下面由你控制  我们干得不错
Enterprise, you have control. We're doing just fine.

201
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,040
我只想说  他们不像以前那样造船了
All I can say is they don't make them like they used to.

202
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:10,130
你说过你能在两周内修好这艘船
You told me you could have this ship operational in two weeks.

203
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,680
我想你给我的时间太多了
I think you gave me too much time.

204
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:19,270
我得跟你们说多少次?  要合适的工具才能干好相应的工作
How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job.

205
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,810
我从没见他这么高兴过
I've never seen him happier.

206
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,320
舰桥...但愿能到达舰桥
Bridge...l hope.

207
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,250
我要先去淋浴
I could use a shower.

208
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,210
嗯
Yes.

209
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,640
这船上没一样东西能正常工作的吗? 
Doesn't anything work on this ship?

210
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,600
他们不能叫我们这样去执行任务
They can't send us out like this.

211
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:54,770
星际舰队通讯当前在线  接到屏幕上
Starfleet transmission on line. Put it on the view screen.

212
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,780
请稍微安静点行吗?
Can we have a little quiet, please?

213
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,370
能调清楚点吗?
Can you clear that up?

214
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,050
能不能稍微安静点?
Can we have a little quiet?

215
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,050
鲍勃!  吉姆!
Bob! Jim!

216
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,470
怎么制服都没穿?  我正要去淋浴
We are dressing informally. I'm on my way to the shower.

217
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,770
很抱歉取消了你们的登陆假期
I apologise for cancelling shore leave.

218
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,980
在祥云III星出现危急情况
We have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.

219
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,110
银河和平之星上?
On the Planet of Galactic Peace?

220
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,330
一伙恐怖分子占领了唯一的居住区
A terroristforce has captured the only settlement.

221
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,000
他们抓了人质  克林贡  罗幕兰和联邦的三位领事
They've taken hostages. The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation Consuls.

222
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:51,470
进取号还无法胜任...  进取号简直是在灾难中
The Enterprise is not up to specs... The Enterprise is a disaster.

223
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,300
我们在这象限中还有其他星舰  但是没有经验丰富的指挥官
We have ships in the quadrant. Butno experienced commanders.

224
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,680
我需要吉姆・柯克  拜托!
I need Jim Kirk. Please!

225
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,940
去祥云III星并评估那里的情况
Proceed to Nimbus Ill and assess the situation.

226
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,740
避免冲突
Avoid a confrontation.

227
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,860
但最重要的是  把那些人质安全地救回来
Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.

228
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,290
克林贡人有回应吗?  没有  但肯定会有的
Have the Klingons responded? No, butyou can bet they will.

229
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:22,340
设定航线前往祥云III  苏鲁先生  航线设定
Plot a course for Nimbus Ill, Mr Sulu. Course plotted.

230
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:25,970
我恐怕这艘船的毛病得在路上解决了
I'm afraid the ship's problems will have to be solved en route.

231
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:31,560
我希望你们每个人都尽力而为  我们开始干活吧
I'm counting on each one of you to give his best. Let's go to work.

232
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:36,230
吉姆  如果你问我  而你还没...
Jim, if you ask me, and you haven't...

233
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,320
我觉得这不是个好主意  我们肯定会碰上克林贡人的
I think this is a terrible idea. We're bound to bump into the Klingons.

234
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,950
而且他们真的不怎么喜欢你  彼此彼此
And they don't exactly like you. The feeling's mutual.

235
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,620
轮机舱  我们需要你能提供的全部动力
Engine room, we'll need all the power you can muster, mister.

236
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,800
就算我只能用双手推船 
We'll beat those Klingon devils

237
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,800
我们也一定能打败那些克林贡魔鬼的
 even if I have to get out and push.

238
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,840
我希望不要惨到那个样子
I hope it won't come to that.

239
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,300
尽可能以最快速度航行  苏鲁先生  是  长官
All possible speed, Mr Sulu. Aye, sir.

240
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,650
怎么了?  我怀念起我的旧椅子了
What's the matter?. I miss my old chair.

241
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:24,000
进取号奉命前往祥云III星球
The starship Enterprise has been dispatched to Nimbus Ill.

242
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,420
进取号?  那是柯克的星舰
Enterprise? That's Kirk's ship!

243
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,220
如果我能打败柯克...
Ifl could defeatKirk...

244
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:42,730
那你就是全银河最英勇的战士了
You would be the greatest warrior in the galaxy.

245
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,070
全速前进  我们必胜
Maximum speed! Success!

246
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,910
舰长日志:  星历84...
Captain's log: Stardate 84...

247
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,520
(系统故障)

248
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,130
舰长日志:  星历84...
Captain's log: Stardate 84...

249
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,390
早上好  舰长  算了吧
Good morning, Captain. Forget it.

250
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,310
我们获得了有关人质的信息  显示到屏幕上
We have the hostage information. Put it on the screen.

251
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:19,070
这是星际舰队资料库授权传输的资料
This is an authorised transmission from the Starfleetmemorybank.

252
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,660
怎么是考德将军!  显然他已不再受宠了
Not General Korrd! He's apparently fallen from favour.

253
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:31,880
考德的军事战略曾是学院的必修课
Korrd's military strategies were required learning at the Academy.

254
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,840
等他们逼我退休的时候  希望我下场能比他好点
When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fair better than Korrd.

255
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,430
这一定是人质的录像了
This must be the hostage tape.

256
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:48,400
不久前我们向银河光明之军投降了
A short time ago, we surrendered to the Galactic Army ofLight.

257
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,240
我们现在处在他们首领的保护性监禁之下
We are now in the protective custody oftheir leader.

258
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:59,450
只要我们合作就不会受到伤害
We will be treated humanely as long as we cooperate.

259
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,620
他要求你们立即派出一艘星舰来谈判释放我们的问题
He requests thatyou send a starship to parley for our release at once.

260
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,460
我们现在很好  如果你们能迅速作出答复我们将很感激
We are in good health and would appreciate your immediate response.

261
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,510
我很遗憾做出这样极端的事  但这是极端的时期
I regret this desperate act, but these are desperate times.

262
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,440
我无意伤害这些无辜者  但是不要考验我
I mean no harm to these innocents, but do notputme to the test.

263
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:26,530
我恳求你们立即回应
I implore you to respond immediately.

264
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,460
怎么了?
What is it?

265
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:48,720
你看起来像见了鬼似的  也许是的  舰长
You look like you've seen a ghost. Perhaps I have, Captain.

266
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,510
史波克  怎么了?  你认识这个瓦肯人?
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?

267
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,260
我不确定  但他确实很眼熟?
I cannot be certain. But he does seem familiar?.

268
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,100
他使我想起了我年轻的时候认识的一个人
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.

269
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:32,030
我没听你说过  我不常回忆过去的
I didn't know you had one. I do not often think of the past.

270
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,240
他使你想起了谁?  一个才华横溢的年轻学生
Who does he remind you of? A gifted young student.

271
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:42,250
他很有智慧
He possessed a great intelligence.

272
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,550
他曾被认为能够成为伟大瓦肯学者团体中的一员
It was assumed that he would join the great scholars of Vulcan.

273
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,010
但他是个变革者  这是什么意思?
But he was a revolutionary. What do you mean?

274
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,890
他所寻求的学识是被瓦肯信仰所禁止的
The knowledge he sought was forbidden by Vulcan belief.

275
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,940
禁止?  他拒绝培养逻辑思维
Forbidden? He rejected his logical upbringing.

276
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,150
他信奉我们祖先那种野性的激情
He embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.

277
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:15,200
他相信自我认识的关键在于情感...  而不是逻辑
He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion...not logic.

278
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,830
想想看  一个充满激情的瓦肯人
Imagine that, a passionate Vulcan.

279
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:24,760
当他开始鼓励其他人跟随他时  他被驱逐出瓦肯
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan.

280
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,680
真有意思
Fascinating.

281
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,810
舰长到舰桥来  我来了
Captain to the bridge. On my way.

282
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,900
史波克?  来了  舰长
Spock?. Coming, Captain.

283
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:51,080
正在靠近祥云III星球  标准轨道  苏鲁先生
Approaching Nimbus Ill. Standard orbit, Mr Sulu.

284
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,300
天堂城要求我们表明来意
Paradise City is demanding to know our intentions.

285
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:02,770
用静电噪音回复  让他们以为我们正遇到麻烦
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty.

286
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:08,060
天堂城  我们难以接收清楚你们的讯息
Paradise City, we are barely receiving your transmission.

287
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:15,070
传送室  报告情况  传送机还无法使用
Transporter room, status. Transporter is still inoperative.

288
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,450
就算我们锁定了人质也无法把他们传送上来
If we could lock on to the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.

289
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,550
看来我们得自己去救他们了  克林贡战舰正在接近
We'll have to get them out ourselves. Klingon vessel approaching.

290
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,590
猛禽舰  1.9小时后她的武器进入射程
Bird of Prey. 1 .9 hours till her weapons are in range.

291
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,350
该死!  我们走
Damn! Let's go.

292
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,790
他们的扫描设备很简陋  但很有效
Their scanning equipment is primitive, but effective.

293
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,920
在坐标856.3登陆  那儿离城市很远
Land at co-ordinate 856.3. That's far from the city.

294
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:07,640
我们不能冒险被侦查到  苏鲁先生  执行命令
We cannot risk detection. Mr Sulu, execute.

295
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:18,360
这里是进取号星舰  联邦星舰
This is the starship Enterprise. A Federation starship.

296
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:28,040
我是帕维尔・契可夫舰长  你们违反了我们的协定
This is Captain Pavel Chekov. You are in violation ofour treaty.

297
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,040
立即释放人质否则将遭受严重后果
Release your hostages at once orsuffer the consequences.

298
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:36,010
你的威胁真好笑  什么后果?
Your threats amuse me. What consequences?

299
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:04,420
一艘克林贡战舰将在一小时内来到这儿
A Klingon warship will arrive within the hour.

300
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:10,010
克林贡人会十分生气  他们可能会摧毁这个星球
The Klingons will be quite angry. They are likely to destroy the planet.

301
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,350
那么我能受你和你的飞船保护真是太棒了
Then it is fortunate I have you and your starship to protect me.

302
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:20,400
你和你的大副传送到我指定的坐标上来
You and your first officer are to beam down to my co-ordinates.

303
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:27,030
我们很乐意传送下来  但我们必须能得到保证
We will be happy to beam down, but we musthave certain assurances.

304
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,790
步行到城市需要1.2小时
At foot speed, the journey to the city will take 1 .2 hours.

305
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,710
我们没有1.2小时
We don't have 1.2 hours.

306
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:43,430
等等...好极了!  我们得引起他们的注意
Wait a minute... Perfect! We'll have to get their attention.

307
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,240
那是什么?
What's that?

308
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,460
她是不是裸着身子?
Is she naked?

309
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,970
你好  小子
Hello, boys.

310
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:57,140
我一直希望能以歌声俘获人心
I've always wanted to play to a captive audience.

311
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:09,530
史波克  要人马合一  是  舰长
Spock, be one with the horse. Yes, Captain.

312
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,880
打开门  是我们的侦查队
Open the gate. It's our lookout party.

313
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,090
联邦士兵就在我们后面  关上门
Federation soldiers are right behind us. Close the gate.

314
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,560
他们要去哪儿?
Where are they going?

315
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,280
史波克...  停下你的马  我在做扫描
Spock... Hold your horse, I'm scanning.

316
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:48,710
人质在那座建筑物里
The hostages are being held in that structure.

317
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,300
加里利奥  开始行动
Galileo, start your run.

318
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,390
相位枪设定为击晕  苏鲁  打掉那灯
Phasers on stun. Sulu, take out that light.

319
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:20,660
怎么回事?  投降  你们正遭受攻击
What's going on? Surrender, you are under attack.

320
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:25,210
我并不想要流血冲突  等等!  回来
It wasn't bloodshed I wanted. Wait! Come back.

321
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:14,440
乌拉  快下来  收到  来了
Uhura, come on down. Roger, coming in.

322
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,070
祥云III以其野生动物而闻名 
Nimbus Ill is famous forits wildllfe,

323
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,710
这里也是最棒的钓鱼之处!
and the flshing is terrifilc!

324
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,510
你可以很方便地在联邦政府资助下到达那里

325
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,890

326
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,850
交出你们的武器

327
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,030
干得好  我的朋友们!

328
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:03,740
你是谁?

329
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,620
史波克!
Spock!

330
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,850
史波克  是我
Spock, it's me.

331
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,230
我是赛波克  你终于找到我了
It's Sybok. You've finally caught up with me.

332
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,820
难道你没什么要对我说的吗?
Don't you have anything to say to me?

333
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:39,750
你因违反17项中立区协定而被捕了
You are under arrest for 17 violations of the Neutral Zone Treaty.

334
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:55,850
史波克!  你终于有了点幽默感  我没和你开玩笑
You've developed a sense of humour. I did not intend to amuse you.

335
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:02,610
这些是很严肃的指控  但如果你现在投降...
These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now...

336
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:09,030
对不起  史波克  我还没违反全部的中立区协定
I'm sorry, Spock, I'm not through violating the Neutral Zone Treaty.

337
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:15,460
事实上  我才刚刚开始  我接下来要违反的是...
In fact, I'm just getting started. For my next violation,

338
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,300
我准备偷一样东西
I intend to steal something.

339
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,800
一样非常大的东西
Something very big.

340
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,350
我要你的飞船
Your starship.

341
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,650
你设计这一切就是为了偷到我的飞船?
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?

342
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,900
你是谁?  詹姆斯T.柯克舰长
Who are you? Captain James T Kirk.

343
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:43,830
我以为契可夫舰长...  我明白了...很聪明  舰长
I thought Captain Chekov... I see... Very clever, Captain.

344
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:51,090
史波克  再给你一次加入我的机会
Spock, you have been given a second chance to join me.

345
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:57,090
我是一名星际舰队军官  当然
I am a Starfleet officer. Of course.

346
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:03,940
当然  那么我就不用你们帮忙  自己偷船了
Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.

347
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,050
穿梭机正在返回  猛禽舰的位置?
Shuttle en route. Position of Bird of Prey?.

348
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:32,470
接近中!

349
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:42,440
距离射程还有约8000公里
Estimating attack range in 8,000 kellicams.

350
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:47,660
我们秘密行动  四分之一脉冲推进

351
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:52,580
准备隐形  启动隐形装置
Prepare to cloak. Engage cloaking device.

352
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:07,850
猛禽舰肯定隐形了  升起护盾
The Bird of Prey must have cloaked. Raise shields.

353
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,190
穿梭机怎么办?  照做  进入红色警报
The shuttle...? Do it. Go to red alert.

354
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:27,170
当我们控制你的船以后  我们就把追随者们带上来
Once we control your vessel, we'll bring up our followers.

355
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:31,300
克林贡人就在那儿  我们能赶到飞船上就很幸运了
The Klingons are out there. We'll be lucky to make it to the ship.

356
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,050
这里是进取号  红色警报
This is Enterprise, red alert.

357
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:38,180
猛禽舰正在靠近  已升起护盾

358
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,520
找一个安全的港口降落

359
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:44,230
不!
No!

360
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,490
不要回复  保持航线
No reply. Remain on course.

361
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,870
听我说  要让这艘小艇进入起降台
Listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay,

362
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,540
进取号就必须降下护盾  并激活牵引光束
Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam.

363
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:05,050
重新升起护盾要花...  15.5秒
To re-raise the shields will take... 15.5 seconds.

364
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,760
我们在这么长的时间里将非常脆弱
An eternity, during which we'll be vulnerable to attack.

365
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:15,890
他说的是真话  如果我们的人隐形了  就表示要攻击了
He speaks the truth. If my people are cloaked, then they intend to strike.

366
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,780
我们不能回头  让我来做点什么
We cannot turn back. Let me do something.

367
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:26,660
好吧  做你必须做的  别耍花招
Very well, do what you must, but no more.

368
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:37,340
进取号  我是柯克
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

369
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:43,050
柯克  他在穿梭机上  快改变攻击航向
Kirk! He's on the shuttlecratf! Alter the attack course!

370
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,230
了解你们的处境  但我们不能返回行星
Understand your situation. Are unable to return to planet.

371
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:54,820
准备执行紧急降落计划...B
Stand by to execute emergency landing plan...B

372
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:06,040
紧急降落计划B?  B  就是barricade中的B
Emergency landing plan B? B as in barricade.

373
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,800
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

374
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:17,970
为了快速降下和升起护盾  我们不使用牵引光束
In order to lower and raise the shields quickly, we'll forego the tractor beam.

375
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:21,390
我们将手动驾驶她
We'll fly her in manually.

376
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:27,190
你常这样做?  事实上  这是我第一次尝试
How often have you done this? Actually, it's my first attempt.

377
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:33,320
他很棒...真的
He's good...really.

378
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,080
史考提  打开起降台大门
Scotty, open bay doors.

379
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,180
准备解除隐形并开火
Stand by to de-cloak forflring.

380
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:55,600
史考提  降下护盾  正在降下护盾
Scotty, lower shields. Lowering shields.

Bird of Prey bearing 105.2. Go, Sulu.

382
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,480
他们进来了
They're in.

383
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,940
瞄准进取号  已瞄准目标
Bear on Enterprise. Enterprise targeted!

384
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,440
进入曲速!  开火!
Warp speed now! Firing!

385
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,870
追踪他们的航线
Track her course!

386
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,130
他果然了得
He's good.

387
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:34,480
我们必须立即改变航线
We must change course at once.

388
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,820
我带你去舰桥
I'll take you to the bridge.

389
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,490
把枪捡起来
Pick it up.

390
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,210
赛波克...
Sybok...

391
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,880
你必须投降
You must surrender.

392
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,600
不!
No!

393
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,940
除非你杀了我  杀了他!
You must kill me. Shoot him!

394
00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:00,380
有一会儿...我以为你真的会这么做
For a moment... I thought you might actually do it.

395
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,760
把他和柯克舰长一起关进牢房
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.

396
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:21,280
史波克  你愿意和我一起去舰桥吗?
Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?

397
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:26,660
不...我不愿意
No...l will not.

398
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:31,790
你知道我是对的
You know I'm right.

399
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,050
那么你得跟他们一起去了
Then you must join them.

400
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,330
这两个会有用处的  让我们单独待一会儿
These two will be useful. Give us a moment alone.

401
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,460
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

402
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:29,700
混蛋  史波克  你背叛了我们
Goddamn it, Spock. You betrayed us all.

403
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:32,910
我并不期望你原谅我
I do not expect you to forgive me.

404
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,790
我真应该狠揍一下你的屁股  如果你认为有用就随便
I ought to knock you on your ass. If you think it would help.

405
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,960
你要我把住他吗?  别插嘴...为什么?
You want me to hold him? Stay out of this... Why?.

406
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:45,840
你只需要扣一下扳机  那么赛波克就死了
All you had to do was pull the trigger. Then Sybok would be dead.

407
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:49,550
我命令你保护飞船  并且杀死我的兄弟
I ordered you to defend your ship. And kill my brother.

408
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,560
他是你的瓦肯伙伴并不等于他就是...  
A fellow Vulcan is not a...

409
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,940
赛波克也是萨瑞克之子
Sybok also is a son of Sarek.

410
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:01,610
他真是你兄弟?  你瞎编
He's your brother brother?. You made that up.

411
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,990
我没瞎编  你没有兄弟
I did not. You don't have a brother.

412
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,410
严格说来我没有兄弟  看到了吧?
Technically I don't have a brother. See?

413
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:17,210
我有个同父异母的兄弟  我得坐坐
I have a half-brother. I've got to sit down.

414
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:23,300
你和赛波克的父亲是同一个  但母亲不同?
You and Sybok have the same father but different mothers?

415
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:30,360
赛波克的母亲是个瓦肯公主  但我们像亲兄弟那样长大的
Syboky mother was a Vulcan princess, but we were raised as brothers.

416
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:37,740
为什么你以前没告诉过我们?  这是私事
Why didn't you tell us this before? It is a personal matter.

417
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:42,750
对此我表示道歉  这样就能全部了结了  就一个道歉?
For that I am sorry. That makes everything all right. Sorry!

418
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,960
史波克不能杀他兄弟  就像不能杀你一样
Spock could no more kill his own brother than he could kill you.

419
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,640
他已经关进牢房里来了  
He's already in the brig.

420
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,090
再说了  我们还有更重要的事要解决
Besides, we've got bigger problems to deal with.

421
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,220
比如我们怎么从这儿出去
Like how do we get out of here.

422
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:59,930
我得说  你总是令我感到惊奇
I'll say one thing, you never cease to amaze me.

423
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,850
我自己也是
Nor I myself.

424
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:15,540
我刚开始担心了  没关系  赛波克会解释的
I was beginning to worry. It's all right. Sybok will explain.

425
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,460
你在干什么?  设定新航线
What are you doing? Plotting our new course.

426
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,300
你没权这么做
You have no authority.

427
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:29,010
这是怎么了?  帕维尔  听他说
What's going on here? Pavel, listen to this man.

428
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:34,980
我不明白  每个人心中都隐藏着一种神秘的痛苦
I don't understand. Each of us hides a secret pain.

429
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:40,110
让我分享你的痛苦  你将从中获得力量
Share yours with me and gain strength from the sharing.

430
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:59,220
没有用
Useless.

431
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:07,060
不明智
Unwise.

432
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,080
你应该警告我的  肯定有办法出去
You could have warned me. There's got to be a way out.

433
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:25,080
这个新牢房能有效防止逃脱  你怎么知道?
This new brig is escape-proof. How do you know?.

434
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:30,670
设计师们找了最聪明的人来试着逃脱
The designers tested it using the most intelligent person they could find.

435
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,640
他失败了  这个人是不是长着尖耳朵的?
He failed to escape. Did this person have pointed ears?

436
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:40,890
并且总能够把他的同伴们拖入麻烦之中?
And an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble?

437
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:45,150
他确实长着尖耳朵
He did have pointed ears.

438
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:56,830
沿新航线前进  曲速7  以当前速度6.7小时内到达
Following new course. Warp 7. Arrival in 6.7 hours at present speed.

439
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,830
既然我们已经出发了  我现在向船上  
Now that we're underway,

440
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,800
余下的船员宣布我此行的目的
I'll announce my intentions to the rest of the ship.

441
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:11,100
进取号星舰上勇敢的船员们  想想存在的问题吧
Brave crew ofthe starship Enterprise, consider the questions ofexistence.

442
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:14,580
这是自人类第一次凝望星空 
Questions that man has asked

443
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:18,320
自梦想诞生以来就已提出的问题
 since he first gazed at the stars and dreamed.

444
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:22,450
我的瓦肯祖先们受他们的情感所支配
My Vulcan ancestors were ruled by their emotions.

445
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,530
他们用心去感受
They felt with their hearts.

446
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:30,960
他们用心去爱  他们用心去信仰
They made love with their hearts. They believed with their hearts.

447
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:38,300
而且他们相信有一个能解答这些问题的地方
And they believed in a place where these questions would be answered.

448
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:43,010
现代信条告诉我们这地方是虚构的
Modern dogma tells us this place is a myth.

449
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:47,270
是由异教徒编造出来的幻想
A fantasy concocted by pagans.

450
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,770
这不是幻想
Itis no fantasy.

451
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:56,700
我告诉你们...这地方真的存在
I tell you...it exists.

452
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,660
兄弟们  我们被选中
My brothers, we have been chosen

453
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:06,170
去进行有史以来最伟大的冒险
to undertake the greatest adventure of all time.

454
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,710
去探索沙・卡・里
The discovery of Sha Ka Ree.

455
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:15,180
他为了寻找沙・卡・里而离开瓦肯  
Is it possible he's found Sha Ka Ree,

456
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,720
他有没有可能找到它了?
the reason he left Vulcan?

457
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:22,310
我们的目的地是沙・卡・里星球
Our destination is the planet Sha Ka Ree.

458
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:26,030
它存在于大屏障之后...
It lies beyond the Great Barrier...

459
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,200
...在银河系的中心
..at the centre ofthe galaxy.

460
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:34,040
在银河系的中心?  传说中它所存在的地方
The centre of the galaxy?. Where it is fabled to exist.

461
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:39,460
没有哪艘飞船能到达银河系中心
The centre of the galaxy can't be reached by any ship.

462
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,880
赛波克是我所知道的最有智慧的人
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I've ever known.

463
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:47,590
等我夺回飞船  把赛波克关到这儿...
When I get the ship back, and Sybok is in here,

464
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:52,430
你再慢慢和他争论沙・卡・里  直到脸上发绿都行
you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face.

465
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,900
你要么站在我这边要么别站我这边
You're either with me or you're not.

466
00:59:55,150 --> 01:00:00,030
我在这里  舰长  说得有点含糊  史波克
I am here, Captain. That's a little vague, Spock.

467
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,240
那是什么声音?
What's that noise?

468
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:11,920
这是一种叫摩尔斯电码的通讯形式
It's a primitive form of communication known as Morse Code.

469
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:16,000
你说得对  我很久没接触过这个了  这是S
You're right. I'm out of practice. That's an S.

470
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,430
T...  A...
T... A...

471
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,470
N...  D...  单词结束
N... D... End of word.

472
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,720
Stand  新词
Stand. New word.

473
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:27,850
B...  A...
B... A...

474
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:32,110
C...  K...
C... K...

475
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,490
靠后站!
Back. Stand back!

476
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:44,250
你们干嘛站在边上?  这是在越狱
What are you standing around for?. This is a jailbreak.

477
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:50,420
这三个人很坚定  真是个挑战
These three are strong. This will be quite a challenge.

478
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:54,260
我们得找到他们
We've got to find them.

479
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:57,680
我们谁也不能信  我们可以发送求救信号
We can't trust anyone. Send a distress signal.

480
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:02,730
观察室里有一台紧急发送机
There is an emergency send apparatus in the observation room.

481
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:08,070
你们可以通过3号涡轮管道到达那里
You might be able to reach it by means of Turbo-shaft 3.

482
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:12,780
爬上去要很久  而且很危险  某些人就是爱这个
It's a long and dangerous climb. Some of us get off on that.

483
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:16,660
修好传送机并联络救援飞船
Get the transporter working and contact a rescue ship.

484
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,090
去涡轮管道走哪条路?  沿那条通道走然后右转
Which way to the Turbo-shaft? Down that tunnel and turn right.

485
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,470
你一定会找到的  史考特先生  你真棒
You can't miss it. Mr Scott, you're amazing.

486
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,140
我对这艘飞船了如指掌
I know this ship like the back of my hand.

487
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,410
我们可以好好锻炼下了  对  或者患个心脏病
We'll get a good workout. Yeah, or a heart attack.

488
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,440
快把史考特先生送去医务室
Get Mr Scott to sick bay.

489
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:38,350
好像一辈子都爬不完这个
This is going to take me forever.

490
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,530
史波克在哪里?
Where's Spock?.

491
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,160
我相信我找到了更快的方法
I believe I've found a faster way.

492
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:09,060
老骨头?  我等下一辆车
Bones? I'll wait for the next car.

493
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:12,140
我们绝不分开
We're not splitting up.

494
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:21,950
我们太重了  肯定是吃了太多的沼泽甜瓜
We're too heavy. It must be the marsh melons.

495
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:28,540
史波克  助推器  我无法控制能量
Spock, the booster rockets. I can't control their power.

496
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:30,920
启动助推器
Fire the rockets.

497
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:35,590
舰长  请下来
Captain, please come back down.

498
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,850
按下控制器
Hit the brakes.

499
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:52,070
我飞高了一层  没有人是完美的
I overshot the mark by one level. Nobody's perfect.

500
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,420
史波克
Spock.

501
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:09,010
紧急频道开启
Emergency channel open.

502
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:14,050
通信范围内的任何人  我是詹姆斯T.柯克舰长
To anyone within range, this is Captain James T Kirk.

503
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,810
收到请回复
If you read me, acknowledge.

504
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:20,520
回复
Acknowledge.

505
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:25,190
这里是星际舰队指挥部  收到讯息  完毕
This is Starfleet Command, we readyou. Over.

506
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:31,660
一伙敌意分子控制了我们的飞船
A hostile force has taken control of our vessel.

507
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:39,000
我们的方位是000.2  请求紧急援助
Our co-ordinates are 000.2. Request emergency assistance.

508
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:43,800
明白  进取号  我们立即派遣一艘救援飞船
Understood, Enterprise. We are dispatching a rescue ship immediately.

509
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,140
设定航线000.2
Plot course 000.2.

510
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:53,440
但这样的话我们也会驶向大屏障
But Captain, that course will take us into the Barrier as well.

511
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:56,570
柯克去哪  我们就去哪
Where Kirk goes, we follow.

512
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:05,450
相信你们的讯息已经被收到了  你别指望我们不会采取行动
I trust your message was received. You can't expect us to stand by.

513
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:09,370
你对未知感到恐惧
What you fear is the unknown.

514
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:15,340
你们星球上的人曾相信他们的世界是平的
The people of your planet once believed their world was flat.

515
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:19,010
哥伦布证明了它是圆的
Columbus proved it was round.

516
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:24,480
他们曾说音障不可能被打破  它被打破了
They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken.

517
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:28,310
他们曾说曲速不可能达到
They said warp speed could not be achieved.

518
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:35,910
大屏障是这种普遍恐惧的终极表现
The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear.

519
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,910
这是个人恐惧感的延伸
It is an extension of personal fear.

520
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:43,080
柯克舰长  我是多么希望你能理解
Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding.

521
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:47,840
我想要你尊重我  你害怕听我把话说完?
I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?

522
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:53,470
我什么都不怕  在外面等
I'm afraid of nothing. Wait outside.

523
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,650
我能肯定你有许多问题
I'm sure you have many questions.

524
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:07,990
来  在我们银河的群星之中...
Here, amidst the stars of our own galaxy,

525
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:12,330
让我们共同探索答案
we shall seek the answers together.

526
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:24,720
放松  史考提  你没事了
Easy, Scotty. You're back with us.

527
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:30,520
我梦见一个疯子占领了进取号
I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.

528
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:34,230
他不是疯子  不是?
He's not a madman. He's not?

529
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:40,650
赛波克让我们接触到了我们一直害怕表达的那些情感
Sybok has put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.

530
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:45,200
我得去修传送机了  史考提!
I have to get to the transporter. Scotty!

531
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:52,170
我有太多事要对你说  等我稍微好些再说吧
There's so much I want to tell you. Wait till I'm a wee bit stronger.

532
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:59,090
我觉得以我目前的情况无法理解关于他的...或你的事
I don't think I could take it in my present condition...or yours.

533
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:04,770
沙・卡・里  源头
Sha Ka Ree. The Source.

534
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,770
天堂
Heaven.

535
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:12,190
伊甸园  随你怎么称呼
Eden. Call it what you will.

536
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,200
克林贡人叫它奎突
The Klingons call it Qui Tu.

537
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:21,250
罗幕兰人叫它沃塔・沃  安多利人的叫法难以发音
The Romulans, Vorta Vor. In Andorian it is unpronounceable.

538
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,250
但是  每一个文明都分享着这个共同点梦想
Still, every culture shares this common dream.

539
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:30,340
那里是万物的源泉  对我们来说它很快就会变为现实
A place from which creation sprang. For us it will soon be reality.

540
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:34,310
我唯一的现实就是我成了自己飞船上的囚犯
My only reality is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship.

541
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:38,810
你用什么能力控制船员的思想的?
What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?.

542
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:43,110
我并不控制思想...我是释放思想
I don't control minds... I free them.

543
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,860
怎么释放?
How?.

544
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:54,580
让你面对你内心的痛苦并从中获得力量
By making you face your pain and draw strength from it.

545
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:58,090
一旦完成了  你就不会再恐惧了
Once that's done, fear cannot stop you.

546
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:08,850
听上去就像洗脑
It sounds like brainwashing to me.

547
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:12,020
你是所有人中最痛苦的
Your pain is the deepest of all.

548
01:08:12,270 --> 01:08:15,020
我能感觉到  你呢?
I can feel it, can't you?

549
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:18,490
罗纳德
Leonard.

550
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:30,500
这肯定是某种诡计
This is some kind of trick.

551
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:34,420
罗纳德
Leonard.

552
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:41,930
父亲?  上帝啊!  别对我这么做
Father?. My God! Don't do this to me.

553
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,600
罗纳德
Leonard.

554
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,330
我在这儿  我就在你身边  父亲
I'm here. I'm with you, Dad.

555
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:04,500
痛苦  结束我这种痛苦吧
The pain. Stop the pain.

556
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:10,800
我已经尽力了  你得撑住啊
I've done everything I can do. You've got to hang on.

557
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:13,930
我受不了这种痛苦了
I can't stand the pain.

558
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,850
帮帮我
Help me.

559
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:21,690
我竭尽全力还是救不了他
All my knowledge and I can't save him.

560
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:26,990
你已经尽力而为了  生命维持系统能让他活下去的
You've done all you can. The support system will keep him alive.

561
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,080
你把这叫活下去?  儿子...
You call this alive? Son...

562
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:40,380
让我解脱吧  我不能那么做  父亲
Release me. I can't do that, Dad.

563
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:47,100
但我怎么忍心看他这样受苦?
But how can I watch him suffer like this?

564
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,060
你是个医生
You're a doctor.

565
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,900
我是他儿子
I'm his son.

566
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,280
你为什么这么做?
Why did you do it?

567
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:14,210
维持他的尊严
To preserve his dignity.

568
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,010
那还不是最糟的  对吗?  对!
That wasn't the worst of it, was it? No!

569
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:24,180
那么分享最糟的
Share it.

570
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:28,890
不久以后  他们发现一种疗法  一种该死的疗法
Not long after, they found a cure. A goddamn cure.

571
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:33,310
如果你不杀他  他就还能活着  我让他解脱了!
If you didn't kill him, he'd have lived. I released him!

572
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,070
你做了你以为是正确的事  是的!  不!
You did what you thought was right. Yes! No!

573
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:40,150
从痛苦中解脱吧!
Release this pain!

574
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:44,950
这种痛苦长久以来毒害着你的灵魂
This pain has poisoned your soul for a long time.

575
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:50,960
现在你迈出了第一步
Now you've taken the first step.

576
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:54,670
让我们一起走完剩下的路
The other steps we'll take together.

577
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:04,310
每个人的痛苦都是独特的
Each man's pain is unique.

578
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,150
我没有什么隐藏的痛苦
I hide no pain.

579
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:14,280
我比你以为的更了解你  是吗?
I know you better than that. Do you?

580
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,660
史波克  别  没关系  舰长
Spock, don't. It's all right, Captain.

581
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:21,710
继续
Proceed.

582
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:30,800
这是什么?  我相信我们正在目睹我的出生
What is this? I believe we are witnessing my birth.

583
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:10,230
萨瑞克  你的儿子
Sarek, your son.

584
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:15,320
真像人类
So human.

585
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,200
史波克?
Spock?.

586
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:46,100
你对我的朋友做了些什么?  没什么  他们就是这样
What have you done to my friends? Nothing. This is who they are.

587
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:51,030
你不知道?  对  我不知道
Didn't you know that? No, I didn't.

588
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,780
现在了解一下你自己吧  不  我不干
Now learn something about yourself. No, I refuse.

589
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:59,410
吉姆  试着对这个开明一点  对哪个?
Jim, try to be open about this. About what?

590
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:05,500
我在人生中怎么作了错误的决定?  怎么走错了人生道路?
How I made wrong choices in my life? Turning left instead of right?

591
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,090
我不需要赛波克带着我游览自己的虚弱之处
I don't need Sybok to take me on a tour of my weaknesses.

592
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:14,140
这是在被骗子洗脑!
To be brainwashed by a conman!

593
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:20,860
这个骗子去除了我的痛苦  仅仅魔杖一挥就去除了痛苦?
This conman took away my pain. With the wave of a magic wand?

594
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:24,740
我们所经历过的事造就了我们
The things we carry with us make us who we are.

595
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:28,030
如果我们失去了这些  我们就迷失了自我
If we lose them, we lose ourselves.

596
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:31,620
我不想去掉我的痛苦  我需要这些痛苦
I don't want my pain taken away. I need my pain.

597
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:38,480
舰长  你继续待在这儿 
Captain, you remain here.

598
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,420
史波克  麦考依医生  跟我来
Spock, Dr McCoy, come with me.

599
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:47,100
史波克?  我不能跟你走
Spock?. I cannot go with you.

600
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:51,310
为什么?  我属于这里
Why not? I belong here.

601
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,150
我不明白  赛波克...
I don't understand. Sybok...

602
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,450
你是我的兄弟  但你并不了解我
You are my brother, but you do not know me.

603
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:02,330
我不是你多年前丢下的那个被遗弃的小男孩了
I am not the outcast boy you left behind many years ago.

604
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:09,130
我找回了自我和自己的位置  我知道我是什么样的人
I found myself and my place, and I know who I am.

605
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:12,500
我不能跟你走
I cannot go with you.

606
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:20,930
你最好也别叫我跟你走
You'd better count me out, too.

607
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:27,690
那么我只好在大屏障另一边跟你们再见了  等等!
Then I'll see you on the other side. Wait!

608
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:32,660
我们不可能成功穿越大屏障
We'll never make it through the Great Barrier.

609
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:36,790
如果成功了  能使你相信我的观点是正确的吗?
If we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?

610
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:43,880
是上帝在指使我  他在大屏障另一边等着我们
It was given to me by God. He waits for us on the other side.

611
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:48,380
你疯了
You are mad.

612
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:54,020
是吗?
Am l?

613
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:57,520
我们走着瞧
We'll see.

614
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:26,010
他们说没有飞船能够幸存
They say no ship can survive this.

615
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,930
他们错了  危险是一种假象
They're wrong. Danger is an illusion.

616
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:32,400
我们的仪表全都没读数了
We have no instrument readings.

617
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:37,780
苏鲁先生  全速前进  全速前进  明白
Mr Sulu, full ahead. Full ahead, aye.

618
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:38,980
这怎么可能?  太神奇了
Is it possible? Fascinating.

619
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:44,360
我们在做梦吗?
Are we dreaming?

620
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:50,910
如果是的  那么人生就是一场梦
If we are, then life is a dream.

621
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,120
(大胆踏迹前人未至之地)

622
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,030
仪表重新恢复了
Instruments are back on line.

623
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,040
不可思议
Incredible.

624
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:29,290
这个星球发出一种我从没见过的能源
There is a power source emanating from the planet like nothing I've seen.

625
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:37,390
沙・卡・里  奎突
Sha Ka Ree. Qui Tu.

626
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,520
沃塔・沃
Vorta Vor.

627
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:43,190
伊甸园
Eden.

628
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:58,790
关于这艘飞船...  它需要舰长
About the ship... The ship needs its captain.

629
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,500
没有特殊条件?  没有
No special conditions? No conditions.

630
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:07,510
那我也许会让飞船调头回去 
I could turn us around.

631
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:10,180
不  你太需要去了解这一切了
No, you too must know.

632
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:18,270
那  既然我们一定要这么做  就按着本本办事好了
Well, if we're going to do it, we're going to do it by the book.

633
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:25,070
标准轨道靠近  准备好穿梭机
Standard orbital approach. Alert the shuttlecraft to stand by.

634
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,340
赛波克  史波克  麦考依 
Sybok, Spock, McCoy,

635
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:29,370
跟我来  其余人留在飞船上
come with me. The rest of you remain on board.

636
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:32,660
等我先搞清楚我们在跟什么打交道再说
Until I determine what we're dealing with.

637
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:38,000
别傻站着了  上帝可是个大忙人
Don't just stand there, God's a busy man.

638
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:30,070
穿梭机不受我控制了
I am no longer in control of the craft.

639
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:10,040
好吧  我们全听你的
All right, we'll play it your way.

640
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:47,130
真迷人  这大地  这天空
It's amazing. The land. The sky.

641
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:50,300
就像我心目中的一样
Just as I knew it would be.

642
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:39,650
史考提  你看看这个  我没时间
You have to see this. I don't have time.

643
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:44,570
舰长要我修好传送机
The Captain told me to get the transporter working.

644
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:20,900
我们乘坐星舰
We have travelled far.

645
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:27,580
远道而来
By starship.

646
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:39,380
进取号  我是柯克
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

647
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:43,390
我们已经...
We have...

648
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:55,820
赛波克
Sybok.

649
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:01,160
也许...
Perhaps...

650
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:22,710
欢迎  勇敢的灵魂
Brave souls, welcome.

651
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:31,100
这是上帝的声音吗?
Is this the voice of God?

652
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:36,310
一种声音  多张面庞
One voice, many faces.

653
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,710
是否这样更合乎你的期望?
Does this better suit your expectations?

654
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:10,610
你是谁?  我就是我
Qualse tu? It is l.

655
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:15,320
你们的旅程一定很不容易
Yourjourney could not have been an easy one.

656
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:18,990
是的  我们必须突破大屏障
It was not. We had to breach the Barrier.

657
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:25,630
了不起  你们是最先找到我的人
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.

658
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:32,510
我们来向你寻求无限的智慧  你们是怎么突破屏障的?
We sought only your infinite wisdom. How did you breach the Barrier?.

659
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:37,390
乘坐星舰  这艘星舰...
With a starship. This starship...

660
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:42,900
它能否将我的智慧带出屏障?
Could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?.

661
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:47,360
是的  能够  那么我要用它
It could, yes. Then I shall make use of it.

662
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:51,530
它将成为您的马车  打扰一下...
It will be your chariot. Excuse me...

663
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:58,790
我将游遍宇宙的每个角落  我想问个问题
I will reach every corner of creation. I'd like to ask a question.

664
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:06,050
上帝要星舰干什么?  把这艘星舰驶近点
What does God need with a starship? Bring the ship closer.

665
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:11,100
上帝要星舰干什么?
What does God need with a starship?

666
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:14,560
你在干什么?  问问题
What are you doing? Asking a question.

667
01:29:14,810 --> 01:29:20,490
这个生物是谁?  你不知道?  你不是上帝吗?
Who is this creature? Don't you know?. Aren't you God?

668
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:26,160
他有他的疑惑  你怀疑我?
He has his doubts. You doubt me?

669
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:32,170
我想要证明  你不能向全能的上帝要他的ID
I seek proof. You don't ask the Almighty for his ID.

670
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:35,420
那么这就是你想要的证明
Then here is the proof you seek.

671
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:52,530
上帝为什么生气?  你为什么这么做?
Why is God angry?. Why have you done this?

672
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:56,660
他怀疑我  你还没回答他的问题
He doubts me. You have not answered his question.

673
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:59,870
上帝要星舰干什么?
What does God need with a starship?

674
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,550
你也怀疑我?
Do you doubt me?

675
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:19,580
我怀疑所有那些将自己的快乐 
I doubt any god

676
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:22,810
建立在别人的痛苦之上的上帝
who inflicts pain for his own pleasure.

677
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:27,030
住手!  沙・卡・里上帝是不会这么做的
Stop! The god of Sha Ka Ree would not do this.

678
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:33,620
沙・卡・里?  那是你自己创造的幻想
Sha Ka Ree? A vision you created.

679
01:30:36,830 --> 01:30:41,670
长久以来我一直被囚禁在此
An eternity I've been imprisoned in this place.

680
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:47,590
飞船  我一定要得到飞船
The ship. I must have the ship.

681
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:52,640
现在...给我飞船
Now...give me what I want.

682
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:54,770
赛波克...
Sybok...

683
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:59,740
这不是沙・卡・里上帝  或其他任何上帝
This is not the god of Sha Ka Ree, or any other god.

684
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:03,870
我不明白  让我看看你的真面目
I don't understand. Reveal yourself to me.

685
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:15,250
怎么?  难道你不喜欢这张脸?
What's wrong? Don't you like this face?

686
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:20,220
我有那么多样子  这个最适合你
I have so many, but this one suits you best.

687
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:24,390
不  这不可能
No, it's not possible.

688
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:29,190
给我飞船  否则我就消灭你们  飞船
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you. The ship.

689
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:37,280
把它驶近点...这样我就能与它结合了
Bring it closer so that I might join with it.

690
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:45,710
照做  否则就看着这些微不足道的东西――
Do it, or watch these puny things

691
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:48,710
悲惨地死去
die horribly.

692
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:56,510
我做了什么?  进取号  仔细听好
What have I done? Enterprise, listen carefully.

693
01:31:56,770 --> 01:32:01,520
这就是我的所作所为  是我的傲慢  自负
This is my doing. This is my arrogance. My vanity.

694
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:05,070
赛波克  我们必须想办法...  不  你们逃命吧
Sybok, we must find a way... No, save yourselves.

695
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:08,070
原谅我  兄弟
Forgive me, brother.

696
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:16,580
我虽然不能帮助  但注意到了你的痛苦
I couldn't help but notice your pain.

697
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:19,630
你的痛苦很深重  与我分享吧
It runs deep. Share it with me.

698
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:27,760
进取号  准备好了吗?  鱼雷已装载
Enterprise, are you ready?. Torpedo armed.

699
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:32,520
我们将向你们所在的位置发射  发射!
We're firing on your position. Send it down now!

700
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,410
快跑!
Run!

701
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:01,760
赛波克...
Sybok...

702
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:11,610
我们快离开这儿
Let's get out of here.

703
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:16,200
苏鲁  我失去他们了
Sulu, I've lost them.

704
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:45,690
史波克  带我们离开这儿
Spock, get us out of here.

705
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:59,460
推进器失灵了
Thrusters are inoperative.

706
01:34:13,810 --> 01:34:18,740
史考特先生  请告诉我传送机已经修好了
Mr Scott, please tell me the transporter is working.

707
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:21,820
我现在可以传送两个人
I might be able to beam up two of you.

708
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:27,040
把史波克和麦考依医生传送上去  该死的等等!
Beam up Spock and Dr McCoy now. Just a damn minute!

709
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:33,920
把舰长带上来
Bring up the Captain.

710
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:04,330
我们不能把吉姆留在那里  关心你自己就行了  报告情况
We can't just leave Jim down there. Get a grip on yourself. Status report.

711
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:08,090
克林贡舰长想谈谈条件
The Klingon captain wishes to name his terms.

712
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:12,760
我是克林贡帝国的克拉舰长
This is Captain Klaa ofthe Klingon Empire.

713
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:18,180
不要企图装载武器  否则我就摧毁你们
Do not attempt to arm your weapons orl will destroy you.

714
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:22,360
你们现在还活着只是因为一个原因
You are alive for a single reason:

715
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:24,900
叛逆者詹姆斯T.柯克
the renegade James TKirk.

716
01:35:25,150 --> 01:35:29,110
把他交出来我就饶了你们
Hand him over and I will spare your lives.

717
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:34,330
我已经准备好把他传送上舰了  柯克舰长不在我们这儿
I'm ready to beam him aboard. Captain Kirk is not among us.

718
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:39,630
你撒谎  瓦肯人不撒谎
You lie. Vulcans are incapable of lying.

719
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:44,590
柯克舰长在下面的星球上  那么给我他的坐标
Captain Kirk is on the planet below. Then give me his co-ordinates.

720
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:54,100
我需要你的帮助  我的帮助?
I am in need of your assistance. My assistance?

721
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:58,940
你是他的上司  我是个笨老头
You are his superior officer. I am a foolish old man.

722
01:35:59,190 --> 01:36:02,370
见你的鬼  先生  你一定要试试
Damn you, sir. You will try.

723
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:12,840
克林贡指挥官  有人想和你说几句
Klingon commander, someone wishes to speak with you.

724
01:37:02,770 --> 01:37:05,950
你们这帮混蛋要抓的是我
So it's me you want, you bastards.

725
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,870
你们还等什么?
What are you waiting for?.

726
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,070
放了他
Release him.

727
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:41,660
我的部下有话要跟你说
Myjunior officer has something he wants to say to you.

728
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:49,290
我...向你道歉

729
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:02,060
对你们飞船的攻击没有得到我们政府的批准
The attack upon your vessel was not authorised by my government.

730
01:38:04,770 --> 01:38:10,110
现在  请允许我介绍我们的新炮手
Now, may I present our new gunner.

731
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:25,040
史波克!  欢迎登舰  舰长
Spock! Welcome aboard, Captain.

732
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:35,430
我以为我死定了
I thought I was going to die.

733
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:39,520
不可能  你从不孤独
Not possible, you were never alone.

734
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:49,030
舰长  请不要在克林贡人面前这样
Please, Captain, not in front of the Klingons.

735
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:12,900
想不想呷一点点苏格兰威士忌?
Would you care for a wee nip of Scotch whisky?.

736
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:17,860
我从没想过自己会和一个克林贡人一起喝酒
I never thought I'd be drinking with a Klingon.

737
01:39:18,110 --> 01:39:25,830
你们俩在密谋什么呢?  关于我们所取得的进展
What are you two conspiring about? About the progress we've made.

738
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:33,380
她的肌肉真不错
She has wonderful muscles.

739
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:53,110
在思考宇宙吗  先生们?
Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?

740
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:58,490
我们在思索...真有上帝在那儿吗?
We were speculating... Is God really out there?

741
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:04,130
也许他不在那儿
Maybe he's not out there.

742
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:08,300
也许他在这儿  在人们心中
Maybe he's right here in the human heart.

743
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:17,020
史波克?  我在想赛波克
Spock?. I was thinking of Sybok.

744
01:40:17,810 --> 01:40:21,940
我失去了一个兄弟  嗯
I have lost a brother. Yes.

745
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:27,610
我曾经失去一位兄弟
I lost a brother, once.

746
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:32,540
我很幸运  我把他带了回来
I was lucky. I got him back.

747
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:37,540
我记得你说过像我们这样的人没有家庭
I thought you said men like us don't have families.

748
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:44,010
我错了
I was wrong.

749
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:08,540
你只是要拨弄那东西呢  还是准备弹奏点什么?
Are you just going to pluck that thing, or are you going to play something?

750
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:17,970
划呀划  来划船
 Row, row, row your boat

751
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:21,970
缓缓地顺流而下
 Gently down the stream

752
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:25,150
欢快地  欢快地  欢快地  欢快地划
 Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

753
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:28,230
生命是梦想
 Life is but a dream...
