1
00:00:01,924 --> 00:00:08,064
- What's going on here?
- Pavel, listen to this man.

2
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:12,294
- I don't understand.
- Each of us hides a secret pain.

3
00:00:12,356 --> 00:00:17,157
Share yours with me
and gain strength from the sharing.

4
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:35,398
Useless.

5
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:43,997
Unwise.

6
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:55,434
You could have warned me.
There's got to be a way out.

7
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,227
- This new brig is escape-proof.
- How do you know?

8
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:05,732
The designers tested it using the most
intelligent person they could find.

9
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,362
- He failed to escape.
- Did this person have pointed ears?

10
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:16,867
And an unerring capacity
for getting his shipmates into trouble?

11
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:19,513
He did have pointed ears.

12
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:30,512
- Following new course. Warp 7.
- Arrival in 6.7 hours at present speed.

13
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:37,377
Now that we're underway, I'll announce
my intentions to the rest of the ship.

14
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:44,388
<i>Brave crew of the starship Enterprise,</i>
<i>consider the questions of existence.</i>

15
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:51,299
Questions that man has asked since
he first gazed at the stars and dreamed.

16
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,463
<i>My Vulcan ancestors</i>
<i>were ruled by their emotions.</i>

17
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:58,289
<i>They felt with their hearts.</i>

18
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:03,460
<i>They made love with their hearts.</i>
<i>They believed with their hearts.</i>

19
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:10,366
And they believed in a place where
these questions would be answered.

20
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:15,025
Modern dogma tells us
this place is a myth.

21
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:19,035
A fantasy concocted by pagans.

22
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:23,602
<i>It is no fantasy.</i>

23
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:28,055
<i>I tell you... it exists.</i>

24
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:32,061
My brothers, we have been chosen -

25
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,379
- to undertake
the greatest adventure of all time.

26
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,576
The discovery of Sha Ka Ree.

27
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:48,260
Is it possible he's found Sha Ka Ree,
the reason he left Vulcan?

28
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,959
Our destination
is the planet Sha Ka Ree.

29
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,195
It lies beyond the Great Barrier...

30
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,127
<i>... at the centre of the galaxy.</i>

31
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:03,971
- The centre of the galaxy?
- Where it is fabled to exist.

32
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:09,315
The centre of the galaxy
can't be reached by any ship.

33
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:12,478
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect
I've ever known.

34
00:03:12,547 --> 00:03:16,984
When I get the ship back,
and Sybok is in here...

35
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:21,523
you can debate Sha Ka Ree
until you're green in the face.

36
00:03:21,572 --> 00:03:24,439
You're either with me or you're not.

37
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:28,919
- I am here, Captain.
- That's a little vague, Spock.

38
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:34,141
What's that noise?

39
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:40,212
It's a primitive form of communication
known as Morse code.

40
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:44,324
You're right. I'm out of practice.
That's an S.

41
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:47,553
- T...
- A...

42
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:50,352
N... D... End of word.

43
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:52,495
- Stand.
- New word.

44
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:56,740
B... A...

45
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,773
C... K...

46
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:02,812
- Back.
- Stand back!

47
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:11,097
What are you standing around for?
This is a jailbreak.

48
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:17,076
These three are strong.
This will be quite a challenge.

49
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:20,674
We've got to find them.

50
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:24,502
- We can't trust anyone.
- We can send a distress signal.

51
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,949
There is an emergency sending
apparatus in the observation room.

52
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:34,051
You might be able to reach it
by means of turbo-shaft 3.

53
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:38,750
- It's a long and dangerous climb.
- Some of us get off on that.

54
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:42,418
Get the transporter working
and contact a rescue ship.

55
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:47,556
- Which way to the turbo-shaft?
- Down that tunnel and turn right.

56
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:50,957
- You can't miss it.
- Mr Scott, you're amazing.

57
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:55,574
I know this ship
like the back of my hand.

58
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:08,585
- We'll get a good workout.
- Yeah, or a heart attack.

59
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:31,861
Get Mr Scott to sick bay.

60
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,755
This is going to take me forever.

61
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,636
Where's Spock?

62
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:14,139
I believe I've found a faster way.

63
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:30,115
- Bones?
- I'll wait for the next car.

64
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:33,084
We're not splitting up.

65
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,945
- We're too heavy.
- It must be the marsh melons.

66
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:48,740
- Spock, the booster rockets.
- I can't control their power.

67
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,834
Fire the rockets.

68
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:54,900
Captain, please come back down.

69
00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:01,296
Hit the brakes.

70
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,480
- I overshot the mark by one level.
- Nobody's perfect.

71
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,586
Spock.

72
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:27,699
Emergency channel open.

73
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:32,475
To anyone within range,
this is Captain James T. Kirk.

74
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:35,885
If you read me, acknowledge.

75
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,702
Acknowledge.

76
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,222
<i>This is Starfleet Command,</i>
<i>we read you. Over.</i>

77
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:49,251
A hostile force
has taken control of our vessel.

78
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:56,323
Our coordinates are 000.2.
Request emergency assistance.

79
00:07:56,323 --> 00:08:00,885
Understood Enterprise, we are
dispatching a rescue ship immediately.

80
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:21,604
- I trust your message was received.
- You can't expect us to stand by.

81
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:24,869
What you fear is the unknown.

82
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:31,364
The people of your planet
once believed their world was flat.

83
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:34,800
Columbus proved it was round.

84
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:39,982
They said the sound barrier
could never be broken. It was broken.

85
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:45,187
They said warp speed
could not be achieved.

86
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:50,627
The Great Barrier is the ultimate
expression of this universal fear.

87
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:53,755
It is an extension of personal fear.

88
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:57,763
Captain Kirk, I so much
want your understanding.

89
00:08:57,795 --> 00:09:02,323
I want your respect.
Are you afraid to hear me out?

90
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,072
- I'm afraid of nothing.
- Wait outside.

91
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:17,319
I'm sure you have many questions.

92
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:21,778
Here, amidst the stars
of our own galaxy...

93
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:26,528
we shall seek the answers
together.

94
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:37,827
Easy, Scotty.
You're back with us.

95
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,957
I dreamt that a madman
had taken over the Enterprise.

96
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:46,721
- He's not a madman.
- He's not?

97
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:53,219
Sybok has put us in touch with feelings
we've always been afraid to express.

98
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:57,246
- I have to get to the transporter.
- Scotty!

99
00:09:57,283 --> 00:10:03,747
- There's so much I want to tell you.
- Wait till I'm a wee bit stronger.

100
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:10,118
I don't think I could take it
in my present condition... or yours.

101
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:17,221
Sha Ka Ree.
The Source.

102
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,845
Heaven.

103
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:23,270
Eden.
Call it what you will.

104
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,300
The Klingons call it Qui Tu.

105
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:31,907
The Romulans, Vorta Vor.
In Andorian it is unpronounceable.

106
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:35,536
Still, every culture shares
this common dream.

107
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:40,547
A place from which creation sprang.
For us it will soon be reality.

108
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:44,506
My only reality is that
I'm a prisoner on my own ship.

109
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:48,814
What is this power you have
to control the minds of my crew?

110
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:52,394
I don't control minds... I free them.

111
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:58,301
How?

112
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:04,100
By making you face your pain
and draw strength from it.

113
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,228
Once that's done, fear cannot stop you.

114
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:17,642
It sounds like brainwashing to me.

115
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:20,795
Your pain is the deepest of all.

116
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:23,367
I can feel it, can't you?

117
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,111
<i>Leonard.</i>

118
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:39,058
This is some kind of trick.

119
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,714
<i>Leonard.</i>

120
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:49,059
Father?
My God! Don't do this to me.

121
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:51,687
<i>Leonard.</i>

122
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,718
I'm here. I'm with you, Dad.

123
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:10,855
The pain. Stop the pain.

124
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:15,946
I've done everything I can do.
You've got to hang on.

125
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:19,797
I can't stand the pain.

126
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,343
Help me.

127
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:26,373
All my knowledge and I can't save him.

128
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:32,461
You've done all you can.
The support system will keep him alive.

129
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:39,891
- You call this alive?
- Son...

130
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:46,216
- Release me.
- I can't do that, Dad.

131
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:51,587
But how can I watch him suffer
like this?

132
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:54,520
You're a doctor.

133
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,977
I'm his son.

134
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:07,996
Why did you do it?

135
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:15,343
To preserve his dignity.

136
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:22,676
- That wasn't the worst of it, was it?
- No!

137
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:25,021
Share it.

138
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:29,617
Not long after, they found a cure.
A goddamn cure.

139
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,765
- If you didn't kill him, he'd have lived.
- I released him!

140
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:37,354
- You did what you thought was right.
- Yes! No!

141
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,708
Release this pain!

142
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:44,730
This pain has poisoned your soul
for a long time.

143
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:50,450
Now you've taken the first step.

144
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:54,094
The other steps we'll take together.

145
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:03,496
Each man's pain is unique.

146
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:06,556
I hide no pain.

147
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,980
- I know you better than that.
- Do you?

148
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:16,986
- Spock, don't.
- It's all right, Captain.

149
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:20,297
Proceed.

150
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:28,785
- What is this?
- I believe we are witnessing my birth.

151
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:06,302
Sarek, your son.

152
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,797
So human.

153
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:19,292
Spock?

154
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:41,046
- What have you done to my friends?
- Nothing. This is who they are.

155
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:45,858
- Didn't you know that?
- No, I didn't.

156
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:49,295
- Now learn something about yourself.
- No, I refuse.

157
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,645
- Jim, try to be open about this.
- About what?

158
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:59,779
How I made wrong choices in my life?
Turning left instead of right?

159
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:04,182
I don't need Sybok to take me
on a tour of my weaknesses.

160
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:07,961
To be brainwashed by a conman!

161
00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:14,243
- This conman took away my pain.
- With the wave of a magic wand?

162
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:18,202
The things we carry with us
make us who we are.

163
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:21,369
If we lose them, we lose ourselves.

164
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:27,711
I don't want my pain taken away.
I need my pain.

165
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:34,226
Captain, you remain here.
Spock, Dr McCoy, come with me.

166
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:39,314
- Spock?
- I cannot go with you.

167
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:43,629
- Why not?
- I belong here.

168
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:47,084
- I don't understand.
- Sybok...

169
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:50,438
You are my brother,
but you do not know me.

170
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:55,587
I am not the outcast boy
you left behind many years ago.

171
00:17:55,587 --> 00:18:00,546
I found myself and my place,
and I know who I am.

172
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,674
I cannot go with you.

173
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:11,803
You'd better count me out, too.

174
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:18,369
- Then I'll see you on the other side.
- Wait!

175
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:23,189
We'll never make it
through the Great Barrier.

176
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:29,219
If we do, will that convince you
that my vision was true?

177
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:33,918
It was given to me by God.
He waits for us on the other side.

178
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,142
You are mad.

179
00:18:40,963 --> 00:18:43,124
Am I?

180
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,908
We'll see.

181
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:14,292
They say no ship can survive this.

182
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,237
They're wrong. Danger is an illusion.

183
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:20,443
We have no instrument readings.

184
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:25,575
- Mr Sulu, full ahead.
- Full ahead, aye.

185
00:20:20,547 --> 00:20:24,745
- Is it possible?
- Fascinating.

186
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:29,935
Are we dreaming?

187
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:35,043
If we are, then life is a dream.

188
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:03,826
Instruments are back on line.

189
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:06,515
Incredible.

190
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:12,463
There is a power source emanating
from the planet like nothing I've seen.

191
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,423
- Sha Ka Ree.
- Qui Tu.

192
00:21:20,482 --> 00:21:23,144
Vorta Vor.

193
00:21:23,235 --> 00:21:25,635
Eden.

194
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:40,672
- About the ship...
- The ship needs its captain.

195
00:21:40,738 --> 00:21:44,299
- No special conditions?
- No conditions.

196
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:52,345
- I could turn us around.
- No, you too must know.

197
00:21:56,227 --> 00:22:00,459
Well, if we're going to do it,
we're going to do it by the book.

198
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:06,010
Standard orbital approach.
Alert the shuttlecraft to stand by.

199
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:09,977
Sybok, Spock, McCoy, come with me.
The rest of you remain on board.

200
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:14,146
Until I determine
what we're dealing with.

201
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,411
Don't just stand there,
God's a busy man.

202
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:09,907
I am no longer in control of the craft.

203
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:46,604
All right, we'll play it your way.

204
00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:22,158
It's amazing. The land. The sky.

205
00:24:22,178 --> 00:24:25,113
Just as I knew it would be.

206
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:12,231
- You have to see this.
- I don't have time.

207
00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:17,316
The Captain told me
to get the transporter working.

208
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,761
We have travelled far.

209
00:26:53,858 --> 00:26:56,850
By starship.

210
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:07,275
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

211
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,272
We have...

212
00:27:20,866 --> 00:27:23,460
Sybok.

213
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:28,193
Perhaps...

214
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:43,136
Brave souls, welcome.

215
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,912
Is this the voice of God?

216
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:56,906
One voice, many faces.

217
00:30:08,194 --> 00:30:11,686
Does this better
suit your expectations?

218
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:30,372
- <i>Qual se tu?</i>
- It is I.

219
00:30:30,402 --> 00:30:34,600
Your journey
could not have been an easy one.

220
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:37,923
It was not.
We had to breach the Barrier.

221
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:44,290
Magnificent.
You are the first to find me.

222
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:50,882
- We sought only your infinite wisdom.
- How did you breach the Barrier?

223
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:55,046
- With a starship.
- This starship...

224
00:30:55,074 --> 00:31:00,834
Could it carry my wisdom
beyond the Barrier?

225
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:05,294
- It could, yes.
- Then I shall make use of it.

226
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:09,146
- It will be your chariot.
- Excuse me...

227
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:16,183
- I will reach every corner of creation.
- I'd like to ask a question.

228
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:23,042
- What does God need with a starship?
- Bring the ship closer.

229
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:27,741
What does God need with a starship?

230
00:31:27,746 --> 00:31:31,079
- What are you doing?
- Asking a question.

231
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:36,866
- Who is this creature?
- Don't you know? Aren't you God?

232
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:42,327
- He has his doubts.
- You doubt me?

233
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:48,130
- I seek proof.
- You don't ask the Almighty for his ID.

234
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,099
Then here is the proof you seek.

235
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:07,729
- Why is God angry?
- Why have you done this?

236
00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:11,682
- He doubts me.
- You have not answered his question.

237
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:14,806
What does God need with a starship?

238
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,510
Do you doubt me?

239
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:36,642
I doubt any god who inflicts pain
for his own pleasure.

240
00:32:36,642 --> 00:32:40,601
Stop! The god of Sha Ka Ree
would not do this.

241
00:32:40,674 --> 00:32:47,079
Sha Ka Ree? A vision you created.

242
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:55,106
An eternity I've been
imprisoned in this place.

243
00:32:55,106 --> 00:33:00,482
The ship. I must have the ship.

244
00:33:00,482 --> 00:33:05,378
Now... give me what I want.

245
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:07,471
Sybok...

246
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:12,046
This is not the god of Sha Ka Ree,
or any other god.

247
00:33:12,098 --> 00:33:16,034
I don't understand.
Reveal yourself to me.

248
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:26,917
What's wrong?
Don't you like this face?

249
00:33:26,978 --> 00:33:31,745
I have so many,
but this one suits you best.

250
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:35,772
No, it's not possible.

251
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,302
Bring me the ship
or I will destroy you.

252
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:43,628
- The ship.
- Bring it closer...

253
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:48,514
...so that I might join with it.

254
00:33:48,514 --> 00:33:56,226
Do it, or watch these puny things -

255
00:33:56,226 --> 00:33:59,024
- die horribly.

256
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,592
- What have I done?
- Enterprise, listen carefully.

257
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:11,154
This is my doing. This is my arrogance.
My vanity.

258
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,697
- Sybok, we must find a way...
- No, save yourselves.

259
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,482
Forgive me, brother.

260
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,639
I couldn't help but notice your pain.

261
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,564
It runs deep. Share it with me.

262
00:34:32,354 --> 00:34:36,791
- Enterprise, are you ready?
- Torpedo armed.

263
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:40,966
- We're firing on your position.
- Send it down now!

264
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,377
Run!

265
00:35:07,682 --> 00:35:10,378
Sybok...

266
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,802
Let's get out of here.

267
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,060
Sulu, I've lost them.

268
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,418
Spock, get us out of here.

269
00:36:01,122 --> 00:36:04,387
Thrusters are inoperative.

270
00:36:18,081 --> 00:36:22,848
Mr Scott, please tell me
the transporter is working.

271
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,717
I might be able to beam up two of you.

272
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:30,286
- Beam up Spock and Dr McCoy now.
- Just a damn minute!

273
00:36:35,074 --> 00:36:37,338
Bring up the Captain.

274
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:06,658
- We can't just leave Jim down there.
- Get a grip on yourself. Status report.

275
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:10,856
The Klingon captain
wishes to name his terms.

276
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:14,942
<i>This is Captain Klaa</i>
<i>of the Klingon Empire.</i>

277
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:19,842
<i>Do not attempt to arm your weapons</i>
<i>or I will destroy you.</i>

278
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:26,466
<i>You are alive for a single reason:</i>
<i>The renegade James T. Kirk.</i>

279
00:37:26,466 --> 00:37:30,562
<i>Hand him over</i>
<i>and I will spare your lives.</i>

280
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:35,290
- <i>I'm ready to beam him aboard.</i>
- Captain Kirk is not among us.

281
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:40,610
- <i>You lie.</i>
- Vulcans are incapable of lying.

282
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:45,240
- Captain Kirk is on the planet below.
- <i>Then give me his coordinates.</i>

283
00:37:49,474 --> 00:37:54,241
- I am in need of your assistance.
- My assistance?

284
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:58,871
- You are his superior officer.
- I am a foolish old man.

285
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:02,078
Damn you, sir. You will try.

286
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:12,302
<i>Klingon commander,</i>
<i>someone wishes to speak with you.</i>

287
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,390
So it's me you want, you bastards.

288
00:39:03,265 --> 00:39:06,359
What are you waiting for?

289
00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:31,871
Release him.

290
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:37,931
My junior officer has something
he wants to say to you.

291
00:39:40,737 --> 00:39:44,503
I... apologise.

292
00:39:51,586 --> 00:39:56,898
The attack upon your vessel
was not authorised by my government.

293
00:39:56,898 --> 00:40:04,703
Now, may I present
our new gunner.

294
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:19,153
- Spock!
- Welcome aboard, Captain.

295
00:40:25,377 --> 00:40:29,040
I thought I was going to die.

296
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:32,320
Not possible, you were never alone.

297
00:40:37,377 --> 00:40:41,507
Please, Captain,
not in front of the Klingons.

298
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:04,938
Would you care for
a wee nip of Scotch whiskey?

299
00:41:06,753 --> 00:41:09,950
I never thought
I'd be drinking with a Klingon.

300
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:17,446
- What are you two conspiring about?
- About the progress we've made.

301
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:24,476
She has wonderful muscles.

302
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:43,281
Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?

303
00:41:43,393 --> 00:41:48,660
We were speculating...
Is God really out there?

304
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:54,080
Maybe he's not out there.

305
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:58,809
Maybe he's right here
in the human heart.

306
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:06,323
- Spock?
- I was thinking of Sybok.

307
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:11,435
- I have lost a brother.
- Yes.

308
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:17,645
I lost a brother, once.

309
00:42:17,697 --> 00:42:20,666
I was lucky. I got him back.

<i>gently down the stream</i>

00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:11,712
<i>merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily</i>
