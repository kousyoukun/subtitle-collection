1
00:01:00,464 --> 00:01:05,368
Memorandum to Paramount Pictures,
Hollywood, California...

2
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:07,769
from Alexander Meyerheim.

3
00:01:07,838 --> 00:01:09,773
Subject: my latest production.

4
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,278
Gentlemen, while you sit safely
in your air-conditioned offices,

5
00:01:14,345 --> 00:01:18,908
we here in the trenches
are progressing brilliantly.

6
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:22,385
As to your curious anxieties
about the script, dismiss them.

7
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:24,820
I talked to the author
last night in Paris,

8
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:28,951
and he assures me that he has,
at this moment, 138 glorious pages,

9
00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:30,961
which are even now being typed.

10
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:34,590
It is my plan to join him
in Paris on Sunday.

11
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:37,601
<i>Period. Paragraph.</i>

12
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:41,400
Gentlemen, success is inevitable.

13
00:01:41,472 --> 00:01:44,032
An Alexander Meyerheim
Production...

14
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:47,101
of an original story
and screenplay by Richard Benson.

15
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:49,909
- Richard Benson?
- You know him, my little angel?

16
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,973
Know him?

17
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:06,659
I hate him!
Richard Benson? Phooey.

18
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:10,395
It seems there's facets of him
you know even better than I do.

19
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:13,302
I cannot imagine
when he finds time to write.

20
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:16,535
Unfortunately, he had time
to write a script for me.

21
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:21,636
The last pages were found floating
off Malibu... in a vodka bottle.

22
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:25,578
Send the usual telegram to Benson.

23
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:29,586
Richard assures me
that he's on the wagon.

24
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:29,224
It's open. Come in.

25
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:40,174
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Mr. Benson?

26
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:42,440
- You are from the typing bureau.
- I am.

27
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:46,382
<i>If we're to have a happy
and harmonious relationship,</i>

28
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,612
I beg of you, never answer
a question with a question.

29
00:05:48,686 --> 00:05:51,713
- Is that clear?
- Did I?

30
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:54,224
There you go again, answering
a question with a question.

31
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,886
My original "yes" when you opened
the door was a question.

32
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,896
Question mark implied,
of course.

33
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:01,523
You do know the difference
between implied and inferred?

34
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:04,364
Isn't that a question?

35
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:08,202
- Yes.
- You answered with a question.

36
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:11,367
To imply is to indicate without
saying openly or directly.

37
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:15,174
To infer is to conclude from
something known or assumed.

38
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:17,237
My name is Gabrielle Simpson.

39
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:19,476
Is that by any chance a bird?

40
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,485
Yes. I hope you don't mind.

41
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:24,283
I was told the job would take days.
I had nobody to leave him with.

42
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:26,449
Well, this is it. The office there.

43
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:29,425
I live up here,
and, uh, the terrace is out there.

44
00:06:29,493 --> 00:06:31,428
That rather grotesque object...

45
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:34,090
looming so formidably
on the horizon is the Eiffel Tower.

46
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:37,225
I had it moved there
to remind me what town I'm in.

47
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:41,136
If it offends you, of course,
I'll have it taken away again.

48
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:44,403
<i>You live through here.
It's an adjoining room,</i>

49
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:47,411
<i>which, to your mind,
has terribly sinister connotations.</i>

50
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:49,413
- No, not at all--
- If so, dismiss them.

51
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,881
I would have got you a room
down the hall or on another floor,

52
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,884
but the joint's all filled up.

53
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,886
Bastille Day weekend and all that.

54
00:06:55,953 --> 00:06:58,047
It's quite all right. I once worked
for an American novelist...

55
00:06:58,122 --> 00:07:00,057
who could only write
in the bathtub.

56
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:03,686
- I'm used to anything.
- You can unpack-- In the bathtub?

57
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:06,321
Yes. On the second day, I gave him
a packet of bubble bath...

58
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:08,332
and from then on in
we got along swimmingly.

59
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,334
I see.

60
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:13,462
Uh, does that imply
that the bird's name is Richelieu?

61
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:16,268
Oh, it's inferred, I believe,
rather than implied.

62
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:20,740
"Swimmingly."
Interesting figure of speech.

63
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:27,944
You call the canary Richelieu
because you wanted a cardinal.

64
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:30,214
That's very funny.

65
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:32,222
No, it isn't.

66
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:35,054
Just one of the hazards of being
an international wit, which I am.

67
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,060
You have to keep trying
all the time.

68
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:39,961
I can't tell you how delighted I am
to get this assignment...

69
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,194
and work with a screenwriter
of your stature.

70
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:45,429
You see, I'm very interested
in the cinema form myself.

71
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:48,028
- I can learn a great deal.
- Well, thank you.

72
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:50,631
I worked for Roger Roussin,
the young, new-wave director.

73
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:54,201
- You've heard of him, of course?
- No, I'm an old-wave man myself.

74
00:07:54,278 --> 00:07:57,009
The picture's terribly interesting.
Very avant-garde.

75
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:59,016
It's about a lot of people
who go to this party...

76
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,382
and decide not to play Scrabble
and then go home again.

77
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:03,853
It was called: <i>The Scrabble Game
Will Not Take Place.</i>

78
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:08,584
<i>His next one's about a girl who
decides not to have a birthday.</i>

79
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,594
It's called, <i>Blow Out No Candles.</i>

80
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:12,596
Roger believes the only important
thing to put on the screen...

81
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:14,757
is what doesn't happen.

82
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:17,267
This film you're writing,
does it have a title yet?

83
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:22,172
<i>The Girl Who Stole
the Eiffel Tower.</i>

84
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:24,504
<i>The Girl Who Stole
the Eiffel Tower.</i>

85
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,374
It sounds just fascinating.
The title is symbolic, of course.

86
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:30,744
She doesn't really steal
the Eiffel Tower. Does she?

87
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:36,545
- What's the story about?
- It's an action/suspense,

88
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,149
uh, romantic melodrama,
with lots of comedy, of course.

89
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:45,321
And, uh, deep down underneath,
a substrata of social comment.

90
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:47,864
Oh, well, if I could just
see the pages you've written,

91
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:50,162
I could estimate
the size of the typing job.

92
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:54,228
The pages, my dear girl,
are right here.

93
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,577
An Alexander Meyerheim
Production.

94
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:01,737
<i>The Girl Who Stole
the Eiffel Tower.</i>

95
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:05,442
Original story
and screenplay by Richard Benson.

96
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:09,681
Here, with a page of interestingly
photographed establishing shots,

97
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:13,690
possibly from a helicopter,
the boy and the girl meet.

98
00:09:13,757 --> 00:09:17,660
- But, Mr. Benson, I--
- Now, after some, uh, chitchat,

99
00:09:17,728 --> 00:09:21,756
getting-to-know-you kind of stuff--
the thing I do so brilliantly--

100
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:25,098
<i>we feel unconscious attraction
between the two,</i>

101
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:27,138
uh, an indication
to the audience...

102
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:29,400
of the tremulous
beginnings of love.

103
00:09:29,473 --> 00:09:31,908
And then... conflict!

104
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:37,710
We can tell by the music how
deeply fraught with danger it is.

105
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:41,843
And now... the first switch.

106
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,412
The audience gasps when
they realize they've been fooled.

107
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:49,358
Things are not what they seem.
Not at all.

108
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:54,091
In fact, the whole situation
is completely reversed...

109
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:58,260
involving
the magnificently ingenious...

110
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:02,204
switch on the switch.

111
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:07,003
Amazed by the sudden
turn of events,

112
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:12,038
the boy and girl realize
how they've misjudged each other.

113
00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:20,356
At that moment,
the music turns ominous once more.

114
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:23,326
They become aware
of the danger that they're in.

115
00:10:23,393 --> 00:10:27,125
And the chase is on.
Screaming tires...

116
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:29,564
<i>rooftops, long shots
of their tiny figures...</i>

117
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:31,625
racing through the empty,
fear-gripped city.

118
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:33,637
When suddenly, in a deserted alley,

119
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:36,264
we see, seated on the closed cover
of a garbage can,

120
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,744
licking its rain-bedraggled fur--
close shot-- the cat!

121
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:45,642
And now, as we build step-by-step
to the climax,

122
00:10:45,716 --> 00:10:47,708
the music soars!

123
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:53,018
And there, totally oblivious of
the rain pouring down upon them,

124
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,357
the two fall happily and tenderly
into each other's arms.

125
00:10:57,427 --> 00:11:01,990
And as the audience drools
with sublimated sexual pleasure,

126
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:06,161
the two enormous and
highly paid heads come together...

127
00:11:06,236 --> 00:11:08,933
for that ultimate
and inevitable moment,

128
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:12,534
the final, earth-moving,

129
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:15,807
studio-rent-paying,
theater-filling,

130
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:18,110
popcorn-selling...

131
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,786
kiss.

132
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:24,788
Fade out.

133
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:26,847
The end.

134
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:30,594
That's it.
One hundred and thirty-eight pages.

135
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:33,597
No point making it any longer.
We'd only have to cut later.

136
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:36,463
- Mr. Benson?
<i>- Yes.</i>

137
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:42,204
This screenplay,
when does it have to be finished?

138
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:45,436
Well, let's see. Today is Friday.

139
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:47,944
My friend, and in this case,
patron and producer...

140
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:52,415
Mr. Alexander Meyerheim, arrives
in Paris from Cannes at 10:00 on...

141
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:56,876
Sunday morning.

142
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:59,116
Which happens to be Bastille Day.

143
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:02,717
That's perfect.
10:01 we hand him the script,

144
00:12:02,793 --> 00:12:04,921
and then you and I,
we celebrate.

145
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:06,964
Drink champagne.
Dance in the streets.

146
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,397
Whatever they do on July 14.

147
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:12,129
I already have a date
for Bastille Day.

148
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:14,501
You mean you haven't
written anything at all?

149
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,774
You have a date.

150
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:22,108
You mean this entire movie
has to be done in two days?

151
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:25,411
Miss Simpson,
if you don't think...

152
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:28,509
you're up to your part of the job,
just tell me right now.

153
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:31,248
<i>- I can always find someone else.</i>
- Oh, no! No!

154
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:34,985
I didn't mean that. It's just that
it's rather unusual, isn't it?

155
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,993
Not for me.

156
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,689
I imagine you've been giving
the story a great deal of thought.

157
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:41,755
No, I haven't.

158
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,533
May I ask what
you have been doing?

159
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:51,837
I have been doing what any other
red-blooded American writer...

160
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:53,900
<i>would, or should, if he had sense,
have been doing...</i>

161
00:12:53,977 --> 00:12:57,175
for the first 19 and a fraction
weeks of his employment.

162
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:59,182
Water skiing in St. Tropez.

163
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:02,481
Lying in the sun in Antibes.
Studying Greek.

164
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:05,420
- Greek.
- There was this starlet...

165
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:09,551
representing the Greek film
industry at the Cannes Festival.

166
00:13:09,626 --> 00:13:12,528
Then, of course,
a few weeks spent unlearning Greek,

167
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:14,724
which involved
a considerable amount of vodka...

168
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:17,529
and an unpremeditated trip
to Madrid for the bullfights,

169
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:20,833
which, fortunately, since
I can't bear the sight of blood,

170
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:23,339
had long since gone on to Seville.

171
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:26,900
Week 17 and 18 were spent
in the casino at Monte Carlo...

172
00:13:26,977 --> 00:13:30,311
in a somewhat ill-advised attempt
to win enough money...

173
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,317
<i>to buy back my $5, 000-a-week
plus expenses contract...</i>

174
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:38,014
from my friend, employer and patron
Mr. Alexander Meyerheim.

175
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:40,057
Thus not having
to write the picture at all.

176
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:44,823
Take a note. For the textbook
which I will do on screenwriting:

177
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:49,230
Never play 13, 31
and the corners thereof...

178
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:52,201
for any serious length of time
for any serious amount of money.

179
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,204
It doesn't work.

180
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:57,070
And now I have to.
Shall we begin?

181
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:03,803
An Alexander Meyerheim
Production. Caps. Quotes.

182
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,406
<i>"The Girl Who Stole
the Eiffel Tower."</i>

183
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:09,078
<i>"The Girl Who--"</i>
Y-You do like the title, don' you?

184
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:11,917
Oh, yes. It certainly
sounds intriguing.

185
00:14:11,988 --> 00:14:15,982
It intrigued Meyerheim too.
He bought the title, script unseen.

186
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:20,258
Uh, original story
and screenplay by Richard Benson.

187
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,629
Page one. Fade in.

188
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:26,295
Exterior. Paris, naturally.
Let's see, night or day?

189
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:30,633
Day.

190
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:35,577
Begin with a shot of--
of the Eiffel Tower.

191
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:37,614
<i>The camera zooms to ward it.</i>

192
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:40,116
<i>Standing windswept and alone
on the platform...</i>

193
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:43,620
<i>is a mysterious woman in black.
She glances at her watch.</i>

194
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:45,849
And we see--

195
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:54,998
How the hell do I know what we see?
Mysterious woman in black.

196
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:58,229
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
Mustn't be obvious.

197
00:14:58,301 --> 00:15:02,636
We can't tip the story too early.
Okay, fade in.

198
00:15:02,706 --> 00:15:06,643
Exterior.
<i>Le Sacre Coeur.</i> Day.

199
00:15:07,978 --> 00:15:10,243
No.

200
00:15:10,313 --> 00:15:12,305
Make that, uh--

201
00:15:13,316 --> 00:15:17,014
The Grand Palais.

202
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:20,488
Mm-mmm.

203
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:22,856
We've got
to give the audience...

204
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:26,954
the taste and smell
of the real Paris.

205
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:32,560
Okay.

206
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:34,662
<i>Exterior. Christian Dior.</i>

207
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:37,537
<i>The camera pans.
We see a white Rolls Royce...</i>

208
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:40,270
<i>pull up and come to a stop.</i>

209
00:15:40,343 --> 00:15:44,280
<i>Now wait a minute.
Uh, make that a white Bentley.</i>

210
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:46,282
<i>It's chicer.</i>

211
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:50,116
<i>A chauffeur in white livery
leaps out and opens the door.</i>

212
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:53,988
<i>From inside emerges
some classically glamorous star,</i>

213
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:56,925
<i>like, uh, Marlene Dietrich.</i>

214
00:15:58,028 --> 00:16:01,521
<i>And now she, uh--</i>

215
00:16:01,598 --> 00:16:04,432
<i>Dot, dot, dot.</i>

216
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:08,097
<i>She sweeps majestically
into the store and--</i>

217
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:11,232
And that's the last
we ever see of her.

218
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:13,800
It doesn't make much sense,
but Alex would have loved it.

219
00:16:13,877 --> 00:16:17,279
He could have stolen the Bentley
and charged it to the picture.

220
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:23,312
- What'd you say your name was?
- Gabrielle Simpson.

221
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:26,322
- How long have you lived in Paris?
- Two years.

222
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:29,086
And you came here to write?

223
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,685
Well, that too.
But mostly to, uh--

224
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:35,027
I don't know
how to say it exactly-- live.

225
00:16:35,098 --> 00:16:38,296
Live. Uh, would you mind, uh--

226
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:45,966
You were saying you, uh,
came here to live.

227
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,977
Yes. I spent
the first six months...

228
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:50,843
making a comprehensive
study of depravity.

229
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:54,007
- No kidding?
- Seriously.

230
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:56,212
Never got to bed
before 8:00 in the morning.

231
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:59,489
I can't tell you
the number of cups...

232
00:16:59,556 --> 00:17:01,548
of that poisonous black coffee
I must have consumed.

233
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:05,153
I didn't drink then, so it was hard
to get totally into the spirit.

234
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:09,063
Depravity can be terribly boring
if you don't smoke or drink.

235
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:11,931
But a person does have to
try to grow.

236
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:14,403
And this guy you've got a date with
on Bastille Day,

237
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:16,406
is he part of the growth process?

238
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:19,568
Oh, no, he's just a friend,
a struggling young actor.

239
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:23,239
An actor! Ooooh!

240
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:26,715
A tragic relationship
to begin with.

241
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,378
I only hope he's not one of those
method actors...

242
00:17:29,452 --> 00:17:31,751
who scratches and mumbles
and pauses a lot,

243
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:36,054
thereby destroying the rhythm
of the author's prose.

244
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:39,460
Oh, he's a little intense,
but lots of fun.

245
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:42,158
Uh-huh. Yeah. Well--

246
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:46,135
And you and this... actor,

247
00:17:46,202 --> 00:17:48,569
what do you plan to do
on Bastille Day?

248
00:17:48,638 --> 00:17:50,573
We're going to spend
the whole day together,

249
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,973
starting with breakfast
at this little cafe we go to.

250
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:55,569
Then we're going to dance
from one end of Paris to the other.

251
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:57,580
The opera at 5:00.

252
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:59,878
Then to the Guards
and the singing of "Marseillaise."

253
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:01,918
And off to Montmartre
for the fireworks.

254
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:05,353
And then supper and champagne
and, you know, live.

255
00:18:05,422 --> 00:18:07,357
You really like it, don't you?

256
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:09,950
<i>- What?</i>
- Life.

257
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:11,961
Oh! Every morning
when I wake up...

258
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:16,693
and I see there's a whole new day,
I just go absolutely ape.

259
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:22,031
I've got an idea.

260
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:25,202
I've got an idea!
First good one I've had in months.

261
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:29,076
Not true. I had an idea to give up
drinking, but it didn't photograph.

262
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:31,910
Now, this could be good.
Very good, indeed.

263
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:35,145
A simple story of a simple
Parisian working girl...

264
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:37,414
and how she spends July 14.

265
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:39,422
The whole picture plays in one day.

266
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:41,549
And I've got two days to write it.

267
00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:44,492
Fade. Exterior Paris.
As our story begins...

268
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:47,121
it's early Bastille Day morning.

269
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:51,595
And all the trumpets of Paris
are sounding reveille.

270
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:59,399
<i>Now, over a shot
of the Arch of Triumph,</i>

00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:58,000
<i>and fade in.</i>

286
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:02,767
<i>A picturesque Parisian square where
the festivities are in progress.</i>

287
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,774
<i>A simple Parisian working girl...</i>

288
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:06,935
who looks remarkably like you,
Miss Simpson,

289
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,411
<i>emerges from her
simple Parisian dwelling...</i>

290

<i>She seats herself at a table

292
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:26,619
<i>With breathless anticipation,
she a waits the arrival of her date.</i>

293
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:29,825
<i>Some... actor.</i>

294
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:32,767
<i>Now I suppose
we'll have to describe him.</i>

295
00:20:32,836 --> 00:20:36,398
<i>I see him
as curiously unattractive.</i>

296
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:38,965
<i>Not at all.
Philippe happens to be handsome.</i>

297
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:42,740
<i>In fact he looks
rather like, uh, Tony Curtis.</i>

298
00:20:42,812 --> 00:20:45,577
<i>I see him as
one of those mumbling actors...</i>

299
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:48,277
<i>destined only for minor roles
and character parts.</i>

300
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:50,786
<i>And his name is not Philippe.
It's Maurice.</i>

301
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:53,153
Maurice!

302
00:20:57,393 --> 00:21:01,125
- Like, uh, bonjour, baby.
<i>- Bonjour, Maurice.</i>

303
00:21:01,197 --> 00:21:03,325
- Hey.
- Oh, darling, I'm so excited.

304
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,334
I didn't sleep a wink all night.

305
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:07,336
- You do like my dress, don't you?
- Yeah, very groovy.

306
00:21:07,403 --> 00:21:09,634
Do you think it would be too wicked
if instead of breakfast,

307
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:13,541
we had a glass of champagne
right here before we start?

308
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,170
Uh, thanks.

309
00:21:16,246 --> 00:21:21,310
- Uh... look, baby.
- Yes, Maurice?

310
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:24,684
Uh, this Bastille Day gig,

311
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:28,418
like, uh, we're gonna
have to cool it.

312
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:30,619
But, Maurice,
I don't understand.

313
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:32,787
Well, you see, baby,
I'm gonna have to cut.

314
00:21:32,862 --> 00:21:34,797
See, what happened, last night,

315
00:21:34,864 --> 00:21:38,392
while I was, uh, making the scene
at <i>Le Drug Store,</i>

316
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:41,996
uh, I was tearing an espresso
with a couple local citizens...

317
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:46,509
when, uh, all of a sudden, this
new-wave looking stud comes in...

318
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:49,671
and says to me
his name is Roger Rosen...

319
00:21:49,746 --> 00:21:53,547
and he's, like,
making a film about Bastille Day:

320
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:56,313
<i>No Dancing in the Streets.</i>

321
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:59,413
<i>No Dancing in the Streets?</i>

322
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:03,551
In Roger's flick,
it like, uh, rains.

323
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:06,221
Anyway, he offers me the lead.

324
00:22:06,296 --> 00:22:09,323
Oh, Maurice, I'm, like,
so happy for you.

325
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:11,334
Uh, you see,
I'm gonna have to split.

326
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:14,894
We're gonna be shooting all day...
in the sewers.

327
00:22:14,971 --> 00:22:16,371
I see.

328
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:19,739
Hey, baby, like, I got wheels.
Can I drop you?

329
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,835
No, thanks. I prefer to walk.

330
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:23,903
Crazy.

331
00:22:28,318 --> 00:22:30,844
Uh, toot a l'hoor.

332
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:35,892
<i>With the almost
lunatic narcissism...</i>

333
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:38,451
<i>peculiar to his curious calling,</i>

334
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:43,091
<i>Maurice rather preciously
mounts his motor scooter.</i>

335
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,192
<i>Our heroine is left grief-stricken.</i>

336
00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:48,602
<i>Not realizing how much better off
she really is.</i>

337
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:54,143
But they were going to spend
the whole day together.

338
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,078
My dear girl, you have
just witnessed the first switch.

339
00:22:57,146 --> 00:22:59,877
Well, maybe. But I know Maurice
would never behave that way.

340
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:02,578
Besides, his name is not Maurice.
It's Philippe.

341
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:04,577
Now then,
having thus successfully...

342
00:23:04,654 --> 00:23:09,319
disposed of her date, we move on
to important matters: conflict.

343
00:23:09,392 --> 00:23:13,295
- Conflict?
- The other man.

344
00:23:13,363 --> 00:23:16,094
The third corner
of the obligatory triangle.

345
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:18,396
Didn't Roger What's-His-Name,
the <i>No Scrabble</i> director,

346
00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:21,495
teach you anything
about writing movies?

347
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:28,872
- No. For a moment, Gaby sits--
- Gaby?

348
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:31,540
We've got to call her something.

349
00:23:31,614 --> 00:23:35,551
For a moment, Gaby sits there,

350
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:38,952
a lonely and pathetic figure.

351
00:23:39,022 --> 00:23:42,015
But unbeknownst to her,
this heart-breaking little scene...

352
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:44,993
has been witnessed by--

353
00:23:45,061 --> 00:23:47,895
dot, dot, dot--

354
00:23:47,964 --> 00:23:50,991
a mysterious stranger.

355
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:54,265
A mysterious stranger.
How exciting.

356
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:59,605
Before you escape the confines
of this unpretentious hotel room,

357
00:23:59,676 --> 00:24:01,838
it's my intention to show you...

358
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:04,779
just how exciting
a mysterious stranger can be.

359
00:24:05,915 --> 00:24:08,475
Now I suppose
we'll have to describe him.

360
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:11,749
- Yes, I suppose so.
- He's American, of course.

361
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:14,857
I can write him better that way.

362
00:24:14,924 --> 00:24:16,916
Now let's see. What else?

363
00:24:18,094 --> 00:24:21,428
I see him as rather tall,
rather suntanned.

364
00:24:21,497 --> 00:24:24,956
Rather handsome,
athletic-looking.

365
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:30,803
With a rugged, but...
curiously sensitive face.

366
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:57,358
<i>Poor sad creature.</i>

367
00:24:57,433 --> 00:25:00,369
<i>Little does she realize
that she and the audience...</i>

368
00:25:00,436 --> 00:25:03,929
<i>will have totally forgotten that
dull clod Maurice or Philippe...</i>

369
00:25:04,006 --> 00:25:06,339
<i>or whatever his name is.</i>

370
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:10,813
<i>At this magic moment,
her life has indeed begun.</i>

371
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,782
<i>Tenderly,
he folds her into his arms.</i>

372
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:17,309
<i>And moving with
the nimble grace of a Fred Astaire,</i>

373
00:25:17,386 --> 00:25:20,447
<i>he dances her off into the crowd.</i>

374
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:33,030
In exactly ten seconds, I want you
to slap me in the face...

375
00:25:33,102 --> 00:25:35,037
as hard as you possibly can.

376
00:25:35,104 --> 00:25:39,804
- What?
- There is no time to explain.

377
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:43,711
No reason for you to trust me.
But I trust you.

378
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,443
There's something about
your big magic eyes.

379
00:25:46,516 --> 00:25:51,420
And I am--
Well, the name doesn't matter.

380
00:25:51,487 --> 00:25:53,854
Just think of me as...

381
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:57,883
Thirteen thirty-one,
American Intelligence.

382
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,192
This must be
some kind of a joke.

383
00:26:01,264 --> 00:26:04,291
If you will look
slightly to your left--

384
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:06,802
without moving your head, please--

385
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:09,532
you will see in that window--

386
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:46,667
In the bouquet I've handed you,
there's a piece of microfilm.

387
00:26:46,742 --> 00:26:49,837
I can't tell you what it is,
of course. All I can say is...

388
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:51,847
if it should fall
into the wrong hands,

389
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:55,646
it might well mean the end
of civilization as we know it.

390
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,700
The time has come for you
to slap me as hard as you can.

391
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:47,536
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

392
00:27:47,603 --> 00:27:49,765
<i>Spies in trench coats?</i>

393
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,004
<i>I'm afraid I got carried a way.
We'll have to go back.</i>

394
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:08,287
<i>Okay.</i>

395
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:10,292
<i>That brings us back
to where we were.</i>

396
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:13,295
<i>We're all right through getting rid
of her date for Bastille Day.</i>

397
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:16,821
<i>The boy and the girl meet and--</i>

398
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:23,103
<i>And they dance, and they dance
and they dance.</i>

399
00:28:23,172 --> 00:28:25,368
And they dance and they dance.

400
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:28,138
Mr... Benson?

401
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:32,910
<i>The stranger. Who is he? What--</i>

402
00:28:32,982 --> 00:28:35,645
<i>- There's someone at the door.</i>
- What does he do?

403
00:28:35,718 --> 00:28:38,882
<i>What suffering, what torment
caused the deep sadness...</i>

404
00:28:38,955 --> 00:28:40,890
<i>that lurks behind his eyes?</i>

405
00:28:40,957 --> 00:28:42,892
And why, while
we're asking questions,

406
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:45,724
didn't I listen to my father
and learn some useful trade?

407
00:28:45,795 --> 00:28:47,787
<i>- Merci.
- Merci.</i>

408
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:52,661
It-- It's a telegram.

409
00:29:04,847 --> 00:29:06,782
Well, aren't you going to open it?

410
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,978
No, Miss Simpson,
I'm not going to open it.

411
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:11,987
The reason that
I'm not going to open it...

412
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:14,216
is because I'm fully aware
of what it says.

413
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,225
The reason I know
what it says is...

414
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:19,160
because in the last
19 and a fraction weeks...

415
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:23,893
I have received 134 telegrams
from Mr. Alexander Meyerheim,

416
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:27,198
all saying exactly the same thing.

417
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:29,204
<i>When's the script
going to be finished?</i>

418
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:31,536
When's the script
going to be finished?

419
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:34,839
How does he expect me to write
when he keeps badgering me?

420
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,880
Day and night:
wires, messages, telephone calls.

421
00:29:37,947 --> 00:29:42,180
"How'd it go today? When's
the script going to be finished?"

422
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:43,844
Talk about men in trench coats.

423
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,115
<i>He spies on me constantly.</i>

424
00:29:46,188 --> 00:29:49,647
His people are everywhere.
For all I know, you might be one.

425
00:29:49,725 --> 00:29:51,387
Mr. Benson!

426
00:29:51,861 --> 00:29:53,386
I'm sorry, but some days...

427
00:29:53,462 --> 00:29:55,658
I just feel like What's-His-Name
in <i>Les Miserables.</i>

428
00:29:55,731 --> 00:29:58,200
- Jean Valjean.
- I guess so.

429
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:02,329
Only last night, I swore to him
on the telephone...

430
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:05,170
that I had 138 pages
in front of me on the desk.

431
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:08,177
I said, "Alex, any man
who takes your money...

432
00:30:08,244 --> 00:30:12,739
and tells you he's got 138 pages
in front of him and doesn't...

433
00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:15,046
is nothing but a liar and a thief."

434
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:19,215
Sometimes I get the feeling
he doesn't trust me.

435
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:43,738
I know who
the mysterious stranger is.

436
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:46,874
He's a liar and a thief.

437
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:49,248
<i>Sure. A latter day
Francois Villon...</i>

438
00:30:49,318 --> 00:30:51,378
who lives by his wits
and what he can steal.

439
00:30:51,454 --> 00:30:53,548
<i>A jewel thief, maybe.</i>

440
00:30:53,622 --> 00:30:57,150
Expert safecracker!
There isn't a safe in the world...

441
00:30:57,226 --> 00:31:01,322
he can't open with his bare hands
in a matter of seconds.

442
00:31:01,397 --> 00:31:05,630
I've got it. We have to start over,
but that's not too serious.

443
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:08,603
We've only got eight pages.

444
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:11,163
Let's see. We're all right through
Alexander Meyerheim Production,

445
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,268
<i>Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower,</i>
original story by Richard Benson.

446
00:31:15,344 --> 00:31:17,210
<i>We can still use
the Bastille Dayjazz.</i>

447
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,716
Only this time
we don't start on Gaby.

448
00:31:20,783 --> 00:31:23,753
We start on Rick.

449
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:27,551
Rick. That's a wonderful name
for the mysterious stranger.

450
00:31:27,623 --> 00:31:31,151
Don't editorialize.
Just start typing.

451
00:31:31,227 --> 00:31:35,528
Exterior. Day.
A picturesque square.

452
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:38,295
Amidst the throng
of merrymakers,

453
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:41,201
the camera picks up
a rather tall,

454
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,604
rather suntanned American.

455
00:31:44,673 --> 00:31:48,701
<i>We'd better change his wardrobe.
Put him a liar-and-a-thief suit.</i>

456
00:31:48,777 --> 00:31:51,679
<i>You know,
various shades of black.</i>

457
00:31:51,747 --> 00:31:54,239
<i>Now moving with the lithe grace
of a jungle cat,</i>

458
00:31:54,316 --> 00:31:58,310
<i>Rick approaches the table where
Gaby is getting the brush-off.</i>

459
00:31:58,387 --> 00:32:02,950
<i>His almost superhuman intelligence
takes in the situation at once.</i>

460
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:07,520
<i>He hesitates. If there is
a single chink in Rick's armor,</i>

461
00:32:07,596 --> 00:32:09,622
<i>it's a pretty face.</i>

462
00:32:09,698 --> 00:32:13,829
<i>He comes to a decision,
and moves off to another table...</i>

463
00:32:13,903 --> 00:32:16,600
<i>where two denizens
of the underworld a wait him.</i>

464
00:32:16,672 --> 00:32:19,335
<i>Just call them First Gangster
and Second Gangster.</i>

465
00:32:19,408 --> 00:32:21,400
Well, Rick--

466
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:24,980
have you thought it over?

467
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:27,278
<i>Let's say
I'm considering the proposition.</i>

468
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:29,682
It is a plan of great simplicity
and beauty,

469
00:32:29,752 --> 00:32:31,687
and yet highly original.

470
00:32:31,754 --> 00:32:34,383
- Very daring.
<i>- Voila, Monsieur Rick.</i>

471
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:36,425
Now we need you
for two things only:

472
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:39,758
to open the safe
and deliver the note.

473
00:32:39,828 --> 00:32:44,664
A few hours work.
And for this, a million dollars,

474
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:47,328
<i>which we will, of course,</i>

475
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:49,497
split three ways.

476
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:53,805
Half for me, the other half to be
divided between you two.

477
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:55,936
But, Rick,
you have already agreed.

478
00:32:56,011 --> 00:32:57,946
Gentlemen,
it's a well-known fact...

479
00:32:58,013 --> 00:33:01,848
that I'm not only a safecracker,
I'm also a liar and a thief.

480
00:33:04,587 --> 00:33:09,355
Half for me and the other half
divided between you two.

481
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:14,261
<i>Very well. Well, I will pick you up
with the car at 4:00.</i>

482
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,765
Until 4:00 then.

483
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:21,965
And, Rick, resist at all costs...

484
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:27,374
<i>your overwhelming impulse
to perform the double cross.</i>

485
00:33:27,443 --> 00:33:31,778
We will not, this time,
be so understanding...

486
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:35,113
as we were last year in Tangier.

487
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:54,967
<i>Now, having established
a climate of suspense,</i>

488
00:33:55,037 --> 00:33:59,566
<i>intrigue and high romance,
we've arrived at that magic moment:</i>

489
00:34:01,143 --> 00:34:04,136
<i>the boy and the girl meet.</i>

490
00:34:07,816 --> 00:34:13,414
<i>Okay, now we need more conflict.
A new character, maybe.</i>

491
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:17,585
<i>I've got it. Seated nearby
is Rick's deadly enemy...</i>

492
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:22,155
<i>Inspector, uh, uh, Gillet
of the International Police Force.</i>

493
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,869
<i>It is apparent
that he knows something...</i>

494
00:34:26,935 --> 00:34:30,064
<i>the audience does not know.</i>

495
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:34,941
And now that we have set the wheels
of our plot in motion...

496
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:40,449
and inflamed the audience with
a desire to find out what happens--

497
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:44,112
And I don't blame them.
I'm just dying to find out myself--

498
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:47,281
we can pause
for a few pages of chitchat.

499
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:50,690
Getting-to-know-you kind of stuff.
The thing I do so brilliantly.

500
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:53,194
The question is,

501
00:34:53,262 --> 00:34:56,892
where should this charming
little scene be played?

502
00:35:03,138 --> 00:35:04,299
At lunch!

503
00:35:04,773 --> 00:35:05,638
That's it!

504
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:08,735
He takes her to a beautiful
restaurant for lunch in the Bois.

505
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:11,440
But that's ridiculous.
She wouldn't just go to lunch...

506
00:35:11,513 --> 00:35:13,482
with someone who picked her up
in a public square.

507
00:35:13,549 --> 00:35:16,348
I mean, he's a perfect... stranger.

508
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:20,583
Miss Simpson, nobody's perfect.
"Why," he asks as they dance,

509
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:22,591
and they dance, and they dance,

510
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:25,184
"are you so sad
when everyone else is so gay?"

511
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,752
And then a suggestion
from the mysterious stranger.

512
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,061
"If you will try
raising your upper lip,

513
00:35:30,132 --> 00:35:34,570
you might at least create
the illusion of a smile."

514
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:36,605
That being
somewhat of a disaster,

515
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:39,164
now he really
has to turn on the charm.

516
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:42,541
"Do you know the meaning
of the word serendipity?" he asks.

517
00:35:42,611 --> 00:35:44,546
- She shakes her head.
- What does it mean?

518
00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:46,605
Why, Miss Simpson, I'm surprised.

519
00:35:46,682 --> 00:35:50,983
It means opening your eyes and
looking at the bright new day...

520
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:53,022
and going absolutely ape.

521
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:55,648
- Serendipity?
- Right.

522
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:59,161
- Are you just making it up?
- No. Serendipity is a real word.

523
00:35:59,228 --> 00:36:02,892
The ability to find pleasure,
excitement and happiness...

524
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:06,561
in anything that occurs,
no matter how unexpected.

525
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:08,570
Serendipity.

526
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:11,869
He explains the word in a more
fascinating way than I did...

527
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,605
and, at the right moment, proposes
that they have lunch in the Bois.

528
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:19,147
- She's tempted.
- Of course she is. But don't you--

529
00:36:19,214 --> 00:36:22,207
Miss Simpson, he's not asking her
to spend a weekend with him...

530
00:36:22,284 --> 00:36:24,276
in a motel
in Asbury Park, New Jersey.

531
00:36:24,353 --> 00:36:28,916
He's inviting her to lunch. Don't
you think if he were charming...

532
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:31,051
- she'd go?
- Well--

533
00:36:31,126 --> 00:36:33,061
- Serendipity.
- All right, maybe she would,

534
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:35,688
if he promises they'll just have
lunch and that's absolutely all.

535
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:38,495
He promises. Unless, of course,
she can think of something...

536
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:40,729
- she would like to do afterwards.
- Which she won't.

537
00:36:40,803 --> 00:36:43,295
Sere-- All right, then.

538
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:47,833
He hails a horse and carriage,
and they go off to the Bois.

539
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,608
- Settled?
- Settled. We ought to write it.

540
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,014
Not at all.
The audience is way ahead of us.

541
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,746
They've known she was going to
have lunch with him for an hour.

542
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,619
How do we get them from the square
through all that serendipity...

543
00:37:00,689 --> 00:37:02,658
and everything
you do so brilliantly?

544
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:04,659
In the motion picture business,
we have a simple device...

545
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:09,164
which takes care of this kind
of situation: the dissolve.

546
00:37:09,231 --> 00:37:13,566
Over the years, the audience has
been conditioned to understand...

547
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:18,164
that when a scene fades away--
like an old soldier--

548
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,574
and another scene gradually appears
to take its place,

549
00:37:21,643 --> 00:37:24,306
a certain amount of time
has elapsed.

550
00:37:24,379 --> 00:37:28,339
So, Miss Simpson, we dissolve.

551
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:32,582
We dissolve slowly
and lingeringly...

552
00:37:32,654 --> 00:37:35,590
to the Bois.

553
00:37:35,657 --> 00:37:38,456
<i>A hansom cab bearing
our handsome couple...</i>

554
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:41,861
<i>clippity clops its way past
waterfalls and trees...</i>

555
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,865
<i>to ward a magnificent restaurant.</i>

556
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:47,960
<i>Notice how cleverly I will play
our suspense-filled melodrama...</i>

557
00:37:48,036 --> 00:37:51,803
<i>against a background of
holiday serendipity in gay Paree.</i>

558
00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:08,052
<i>We spare the audience
the ordeal of listening...</i>

559
00:38:08,123 --> 00:38:12,151
<i>to pages of dreary small talk
and get directly to the matter...</i>

560
00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:15,891
<i>by the simple use of the device
I've just explained to you:</i>

561
00:38:15,964 --> 00:38:17,899
<i>the dissolve.</i>

562
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:19,901
Who are you?
What do you do?

563
00:38:19,968 --> 00:38:23,530
Who am I and what do I do?

564
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:27,064
I'm nobody and I've done everything
and nothing.

565
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:29,941
Driven racing cars.
White hunter for a while.

566
00:38:30,012 --> 00:38:33,779
Piano player in a rather curious
establishment in Buenos Aires.

567
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:36,546
This and that,
everything and nothing.

568
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:39,588
It's the curse of having
been born too rich.

569
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:41,783
Oh, I know so well what you mean,

570
00:38:41,857 --> 00:38:44,190
about the curse
of having been born too rich.

571
00:38:44,259 --> 00:38:48,390
That's why I left the castle
and came to Paris to live.

572
00:38:48,463 --> 00:38:50,659
We've got houses
all over the world, of course.

573
00:38:50,732 --> 00:38:55,261
But my favorite was our place
in Deauville with its private zoo.

574
00:38:55,337 --> 00:38:59,866
When I was a little girl,
on Sunday, if I'd been good,

575
00:38:59,942 --> 00:39:02,070
I was allowed to feed the giraffes.

576
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:07,208
Giraffes? Don't tell me
that you had giraffes too.

577
00:39:07,282 --> 00:39:10,047
- You mean you?
- But of course we did.

578
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:14,920
Oh, what fun, both of us
having had giraffes as children.

579
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:17,550
It's a small world, isn't it?

580
00:39:20,629 --> 00:39:23,531
<i>Voila. Madame. Monsieur.</i>

581
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:28,126
- To Rick.
- To Gaby.

582
00:39:28,203 --> 00:39:30,138
<i>If I may recommend.</i>

583
00:39:30,205 --> 00:39:32,140
<i>I prefer to do it myself.</i>

584
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:36,804
To begin, we'll have thin slices
of prosciutto ham...

585
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:42,112
wrapped carefully around
well-ripened sections of melon.

586
00:39:42,184 --> 00:39:44,483
To follow,
a touch of Dover sole...

587
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:47,250
sauteed lightly
in champagne and butter.

588
00:39:47,322 --> 00:39:50,986
- With that, a bottle of, uh--
- Pouilly Fuisse.

589
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:54,621
<i>Fifty-nine will do.
And after that...</i>

590
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:58,497
We'll have
a Chateaubriand for two.

591
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:01,469
Uh, make that for four.
Charred and brown--

592
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:06,031
Nay! Black on the outside
and gloriously rare on the in.

593
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:09,601
With the beef,
we'll have white asparagus...

594
00:40:09,678 --> 00:40:13,581
and a bottle of
Chateau Laffitte Rothschild '47.

595
00:40:13,649 --> 00:40:17,279
And for dessert, an enormous order
of Fraises de Bois.

596
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:19,878
Served, or course,
with globs of heavy cream...

597
00:40:19,955 --> 00:40:23,221
so thick you can put it on
with a shovel, <i>s'il vous plait.</i>

598
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,226
Mmm!

599
00:40:25,293 --> 00:40:28,627
You heard the lady. Make it snappy.
We're starving to death.

600
00:40:28,697 --> 00:40:32,964
Now, while awaiting
the thin slices of prosciutto...

601
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:37,939
so skillfully wrapped around
perfect sections of ripened melon--

602
00:40:38,006 --> 00:40:40,942
Please, stop. I can't stand it.

603
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:46,846
They'll really do the sole
in champagne and butter?

604
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:49,407
Mm-hmm. In any case,
while we're waiting.

605
00:40:49,484 --> 00:40:51,885
I wonder if the very lovely
Miss Gabrielle Simpson...

606
00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:54,923
would consider joining
the talented Mr. Richard Benson...

607
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,255
for a small, very dry aperitif.

608
00:40:57,325 --> 00:40:59,590
I think she's earned it.
I think they both have.

609
00:40:59,661 --> 00:41:03,223
All right. I think
that would be very nice.

610
00:41:03,298 --> 00:41:06,166
You know, I didn't
really like Rick at first.

611
00:41:06,234 --> 00:41:09,033
But he's beginning to grow on me.

612
00:41:12,274 --> 00:41:16,405
<i>Mmm!</i>

613
00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:19,073
<i>You were saying you
find Rick growing on you.</i>

614
00:41:19,147 --> 00:41:21,548
Oh, yes, I think
he's very attractive.

615
00:41:21,616 --> 00:41:24,609
Important. The reaction
of the female audience.

616
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:27,019
All right, lunch is over.

617
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:29,991
The martinis, the two kinds of wine
and the brandy...

618
00:41:30,058 --> 00:41:31,993
have had their effect.

619
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,189
And a glorious dream-like glow
is settling over them.

620
00:41:35,263 --> 00:41:37,289
The pages, Miss Simpson,

621
00:41:37,365 --> 00:41:41,803
those that we have covered so far
with our fabulous prose.

622
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:54,045
Here you will notice, as advertised
in the discussion earlier on today,

623
00:41:54,116 --> 00:41:59,487
the opening: a series of interesting
establishing shots.

624
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:03,491
And, uh, here,
the boy and the girl--

625
00:42:03,558 --> 00:42:08,587
if a middle-age stranger
can indeed be called a boy-- meet.

626
00:42:08,663 --> 00:42:10,757
You're not middle-aged,
Mr. Benson.

627
00:42:10,832 --> 00:42:14,325
In fact, I think
you're remarkably well-preserved.

628
00:42:14,402 --> 00:42:18,339
As chilling a compliment
as I've ever received.

629
00:42:18,406 --> 00:42:20,398
However, to continue,

630
00:42:20,475 --> 00:42:25,607
pages eight, nine, ten
of romantic chitchat.

631
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,582
- Which you do so brilliantly.
- Well, thank you, Miss Simpson.

632
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:33,486
Now you can feel the unconscious
attraction between the two.

633
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:36,684
The-- The tremulous
beginnings of love.

634
00:42:38,493 --> 00:42:42,055
You see how easy it is when
you've got professional know-how...

635
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,224
running on your side?

636
00:42:46,234 --> 00:42:49,671
Miss Simpson,
I don't think you realize this,

637
00:42:49,738 --> 00:42:53,675
but a writer's life
is a terribly lonely one.

638
00:42:55,277 --> 00:42:58,577
- Mr. Benson?
- Mm?

639
00:42:58,647 --> 00:43:01,640
Have you any idea at all
what happens next?

640
00:43:03,618 --> 00:43:08,215
Do you, Miss Simpson,
have any idea what will happen?

641
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,282
Well--

642
00:43:14,262 --> 00:43:17,630
We've got to remember no matter how
charming he seems on the surface,

643
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:19,793
he is a liar and a thief!

644
00:43:19,868 --> 00:43:24,602
It says so right... here.
Mr. Benson--

645
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,416
I <i>do</i> know what happens next.

646
00:43:35,483 --> 00:43:38,976
What happens next
is the second switch!

647
00:43:39,054 --> 00:43:42,821
The audience gasps as they realize
they have been fooled.

648
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:46,726
He has been plying her
with martinis, wine, brandy...

649
00:43:46,795 --> 00:43:51,324
for only one reason:
To make her drunk.

650
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:54,702
Which, incidentally, she's not.

651
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:56,965
Not in the least.
No matter what he thinks.

652
00:43:57,038 --> 00:44:00,975
Now, as he forces
one last brandy...

653
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:03,876
to her unwilling lips-- Oh!

654
00:44:06,648 --> 00:44:08,583
<i>Poor ingenuous girl.</i>

655
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,949
<i>She has been charmed
and serendipitied into believing...</i>

656
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:15,013
<i>that she was safe in the hands
of this suntanned American.</i>

657
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:20,860
<i>Alas, things are not
what they seem. Not at all.</i>

658
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:23,922
<i>The music turns ominous.</i>

659
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:36,144
<i>And she becomes a ware
of the danger that she is in.</i>

660
00:44:37,812 --> 00:44:40,077
<i>The mysterious stranger.</i>

661
00:44:40,148 --> 00:44:42,947
<i>Who is he?
What is he really like?</i>

662
00:44:43,018 --> 00:44:46,011
<i>And why does he keep
nibbling on her neck?</i>

663
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,897
Don't be frightened, my dear.

664
00:44:57,966 --> 00:44:59,901
It's only a bat.

665
00:44:59,968 --> 00:45:03,598
The creatures of the night
are my friends.

666
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:16,041
Now I know why you keep
nibbling on my neck.

667
00:45:16,117 --> 00:45:18,052
You're some kind of a werewolf.

668
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,749
No, no, my dear.

669
00:45:21,823 --> 00:45:24,816
I'm a vampire.

670
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:49,443
The inner reaches
of these caverns...

671
00:45:49,517 --> 00:45:53,010
make an ideal setting
for my laboratory.

672
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,913
<i>And yet there's
something about his eyes,</i>

673
00:46:20,982 --> 00:46:23,975
<i>even though
they are rather bloodshot.</i>

674
00:46:24,052 --> 00:46:27,580
<i>A vampire's life must be
a terribly lonely one.</i>

675
00:46:27,655 --> 00:46:32,116
<i>But not for nothing has she made
a comprehensive study of depravity.</i>

676
00:46:32,193 --> 00:46:37,063
<i>There are girls who let vampires
nibble their necks the first date.</i>

677
00:46:37,132 --> 00:46:40,500
<i>But not our Gaby. She tears herself
free from his evil grasp,</i>

678
00:46:40,568 --> 00:46:43,003
<i>and the chase is on!</i>

679
00:46:53,748 --> 00:46:55,808
Ooh!

680
00:48:08,456 --> 00:48:11,392
<i>He's caught her. No, Gaby. No!</i>

681
00:48:11,459 --> 00:48:13,985
<i>You can't give in now.
You fought him in the cave,</i>

682
00:48:14,062 --> 00:48:17,555
<i>You fought him on the beaches.
You fought him on the plains.</i>

683
00:48:17,632 --> 00:48:19,624
<i>That's it! Planes!</i>

684
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:54,768
Her face registers terror.

685
00:48:54,836 --> 00:48:58,932
Mr. Benson, Mr. Benson!
She's killed him!

686
00:48:59,007 --> 00:49:03,536
Oh, there, there, Miss Simpson.

687
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:06,046
It's perfectly all right.

688
00:49:06,114 --> 00:49:09,380
It must be said in your defense,
it's been a hard day,

689
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,885
and you've had
a good deal to drink.

690
00:49:11,953 --> 00:49:14,218
Anyway,
he had it coming to him.

691
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:18,226
Plying her with all that booze,
making her drunk.

692
00:49:18,293 --> 00:49:22,230
Which, incidentally, she is not.
Not in the least.

693
00:49:22,297 --> 00:49:25,665
- Of course not.
- Not only did she kill him,

694
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:28,669
but when I think
of that poor horse...

695
00:49:28,736 --> 00:49:32,070
and the way she beat him
with that terrible whip--

696
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,975
Anyway, I think she's the one
who had it coming to her.

697
00:49:36,044 --> 00:49:37,910
That was what?

698
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:40,414
Whatever it was
he was gonna do to her.

699
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:43,246
I don't see why she was
making such a fuss anyway.

700
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:46,482
It's not as if he were some kind
of a vampire or something.

701
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:50,318
Actually,
I think he's very attractive.

702
00:49:55,663 --> 00:49:59,759
I think it would be a good idea
if you were to go to bed and sleep.

703
00:49:59,834 --> 00:50:03,362
You do? What about you?

704
00:50:03,438 --> 00:50:08,172
I am going to think. If you will
please go in there and lie down--

705
00:50:08,243 --> 00:50:10,610
Maybe if I did get
a few hours sleep--

706
00:50:10,678 --> 00:50:14,115
But if you do get an idea,
and I know you will,

707
00:50:14,182 --> 00:50:16,276
you've got to promise to wake me.

708
00:50:16,351 --> 00:50:19,014
- Sure.
- Promise?

709
00:50:22,357 --> 00:50:24,792
I promise.

710
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:27,124
All right then.

711
00:50:27,195 --> 00:50:29,289
Good night, Mr. Benson.

712
00:50:29,364 --> 00:50:31,595
Good night, Miss Simpson.

713
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,536
<i>Good night.</i>

714
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:38,699
Good night.

715
00:51:08,236 --> 00:51:13,402
Operator, I'd like to place a call
to a Mr. Alexander Meyerheim...

716
00:51:13,474 --> 00:51:15,670
in Cannes.

717
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:17,678
Well, it's 1:30.

718
00:51:17,745 --> 00:51:20,010
You can probably find him
at the casino.

719
00:51:23,184 --> 00:51:26,154
Uh... uh, Benson.

720
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,780
Mr. Richard Benson calling.

721
00:51:28,856 --> 00:51:30,950
Person to person.

722
00:51:31,025 --> 00:51:33,017
I'll hold on.

723
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:43,761
Dear Alex--

724
00:51:50,712 --> 00:51:52,840
Dear Alex...

725
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:55,509
<i>it is my unpleasant duty
to inform you...</i>

726
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:59,042
The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower
<i>will not take place.</i>

727
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,055
<i>You see, my friend,</i>

728
00:52:01,122 --> 00:52:05,492
that there's no point for you
to come to Paris on Sunday...

729
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,688
to read the script,

730
00:52:07,762 --> 00:52:09,822
because there is no script.

731
00:52:11,165 --> 00:52:14,932
And as I see it, there will be no--

732
00:52:15,002 --> 00:52:17,096
Eh?

733
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:19,231
<i>Como?</i>

734
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:25,569
Try him at the chemin de fer game--
the big table.

735
00:52:56,043 --> 00:52:58,706
Excuse me.
I forgot to cover Richelieu.

736
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:08,787
Good night.

737
00:53:13,161 --> 00:53:16,256
Oh, Mr. Benson,

738
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,925
please don't think
I'm quitting on you.

739
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,526
I'll be right here
when you need me.

740
00:53:21,602 --> 00:53:23,662
Good night.

741
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:37,175
Operator... cancel that call.

Unfortunately, Miss Simpson...

784
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,508
we are not writing a musical!

785
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,451
Mr. Benson, you mean
you did all these pages last night?

786
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,460
All by yourself?

787
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,463
While some of us were sleeping
snug in our beds,

788
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:35,468
other citizens were toiling in
the vineyards of beautiful letters.

789
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,300
I'm only sorry that you,
as a fledgling writer,

790
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,306
weren't present to observe...

791
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,308
with your own big magic eyes...

792
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,901
a seasoned professional in action.

793
00:57:44,978 --> 00:57:47,243
I was, in those few short hours,

794
00:57:47,314 --> 00:57:51,479
the great DiMaggio going back,
back, back for the high fly ball!

795
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,486
I was Manolete in Seville...

796
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,988
going in over the horns
for the kill!

797
00:57:56,056 --> 00:58:00,426
Missing, fortunately, because
I can't stand the sight of blood.

798
00:58:00,494 --> 00:58:02,986
I was Pablo Picasso deftly...

799
00:58:04,664 --> 00:58:09,295
adding the third eye
to a portrait of his lady love.

800
00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:12,430
I was, uh--

801
00:58:12,506 --> 00:58:15,271
How do you spell "ingenuous"?

802
00:58:15,342 --> 00:58:18,107
I-N-G-E-N-U-O-U-S.

803
00:58:18,178 --> 00:58:20,443
I was afraid of that.

804
00:58:20,514 --> 00:58:24,781
In addition to the 9 1/2 yards
of pages I wrote last night,

805
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:28,288
I discovered some errors
in the earlier pages...

806
00:58:28,355 --> 00:58:30,290
which had to be corrected,

807
00:58:30,357 --> 00:58:32,622
dealing, basically,
with the character of Rick.

808
00:58:32,692 --> 00:58:36,356
I found I had,
at a moment of insecurity...

809
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:40,125
underestimated
the brilliance of the man.

810
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,135
No simple safecracker he,

811
00:58:42,202 --> 00:58:46,640
but a master criminal wanted
by the police of three continents.

812
00:58:46,706 --> 00:58:51,474
The dazzling scheme has been
worked out step by painful step...

813
00:58:51,545 --> 00:58:53,537
for over a year by Rick himself.

814
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,310
The two other characters
are just employees.

815
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:59,080
Now then, that brings us
back to where we were.

816
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:02,418
Rick and Gaby had by now
demolished a glorious lunch,

817
00:59:02,489 --> 00:59:05,823
and it's almost 4:00--
time for the car to arrive.

818
00:59:05,892 --> 00:59:08,259
- Page 14.
- Now then,

819
00:59:08,328 --> 00:59:10,763
sit down and brace yourself.

820
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,766
Here comes the switch
on the switch.

821
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:16,598
In a minute and a half,
both you and the audience...

822
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:19,606
will gasp as you realize
you've been fooled.

823
00:59:19,673 --> 00:59:22,609
Things are not as they seem.
Not at all!

824
00:59:22,676 --> 00:59:23,700
In fact...

825
00:59:24,177 --> 00:59:26,112
the whole situation
is completely reversed.

826
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:28,114
Mr. Benson.

827
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:32,778
Miss Simpson, don't sit there
gazing at me in mute adoration.

828
00:59:32,852 --> 00:59:35,014
Read the script.

829
00:59:36,523 --> 00:59:39,618
"Rick and Gaby are sitting
with brandy glasses before them.

830
00:59:39,693 --> 00:59:41,992
Her big magic eyes are shiny."

831
00:59:43,863 --> 00:59:46,799
I can't imagine when I've had
a more marvelous lunch.

832
00:59:46,866 --> 00:59:48,994
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Please.

833
00:59:51,137 --> 00:59:55,131
And now I'll tell you the plans
for the rest of the afternoon.

834
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:57,803
- The rest of the afternoon?
- Exactly.

835
00:59:57,877 --> 01:00:00,813
I've asked my chauffeur
to pick us up here at 4:00...

836
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,317
for a tour of Paris, to see how
the celebration is progressing.

837
01:00:04,384 --> 01:00:07,821
A brief stop at my office
to pick something up,

838
01:00:07,887 --> 01:00:10,482
and then on to a party
being given in my honor...

839
01:00:10,557 --> 01:00:13,186
at the restaurant
in the Eiffel Tower.

840
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:18,824
- Pardon. You are Monsieur Rick?
<i>- Oui.</i>

841
01:00:18,898 --> 01:00:23,996
Your chauffeur is here. He says
he has an important message.

842
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:26,335
<i>Merci,</i> Jacques.

843
01:00:26,406 --> 01:00:28,568
Pardon me for a moment.

844
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:40,512
- It's almost 4:00.
- I know, I know.

845
01:00:40,587 --> 01:00:43,022
What's the matter?
Have you gone mad?

846
01:00:43,089 --> 01:00:45,854
Bringing a girl along
on a job like this?

847
01:00:45,925 --> 01:00:48,360
In our arrangement,
my dear Francois,

848
01:00:48,428 --> 01:00:51,523
you were to do the driving
and I was to do the planning.

849
01:00:51,598 --> 01:00:55,694
But the plan does not call
for the presence of a girl!

850
01:00:55,769 --> 01:01:00,366
The ability to improvise
in a moment of crisis...

851
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,468
is one of the reasons I am
a highly paid, successful thief.

852
01:01:04,544 --> 01:01:08,481
If you will look to the left,
just behind you,

853
01:01:08,548 --> 01:01:11,313
as casually as possible,

854
01:01:11,384 --> 01:01:16,152
you will see, stupidly trying to
hide behind yesterday's newspaper,

855
01:01:16,222 --> 01:01:18,851
our old friend Inspector Gillet.

856
01:01:23,063 --> 01:01:25,828
What is he doing in Paris?

857
01:01:25,899 --> 01:01:28,334
Do you think he suspects something?

858
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:31,838
Of course not. Even if he does,
I'm one step ahead of him.

859
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:36,172
- Why do you think I picked her up?
- Because she has big magic eyes.

860
01:01:36,242 --> 01:01:38,507
Well, that too, but,
actually, I picked her up...

861
01:01:38,578 --> 01:01:41,742
to throw our inspector friend
off the scent.

862
01:01:41,815 --> 01:01:44,046
Never in his wildest
imagination...

863
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,053
would he think that the highly paid
and successful Rick...

864
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,716
would be so foolish as to take
a girl along with him on a job.

865
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,055
Therefore, that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

866
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,118
She's a perfect cover.

867
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,094
Meet you at the car
in one minute.

868
01:02:11,044 --> 01:02:13,206
Shall we?

869
01:02:21,054 --> 01:02:23,785
My dear Gillet.
Our paths cross again.

870
01:02:23,857 --> 01:02:27,191
My dear Rick.
What an extraordinary coincidence.

871
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:31,994
This is Monsieur Gillet.
He is a business associate of mine.

872
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:34,830
Enchanted. Any friend of Rick's
is a friend of mine.

873
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:39,737
Please sit down, enjoy your lunch.
And I beg you, watch the calories.

874
01:02:59,426 --> 01:03:01,622
This, my friend,
is a moment to savor.

875
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:04,129
For three long years
I've waited, and now, at last,

876
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:08,794
my brilliant, highly paid friend
has risen to the bait.

877
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:13,135
What he doesn't know, poor Rick,
is that the girl is ours.

878
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,368
You're sure he suspected nothing?

879
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:21,140
Inspector, my imitation
of a method actor was impeccable.

880
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,308
I played the role internally,
of course,

881
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:27,320
indicating all the basic elements
of this curious calling--

882
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:31,483
the deep,
almost lunatic narcissism,

883
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,891
the lack of personal daintiness,

884
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,088
the appalling grammar.

885
01:03:36,162 --> 01:03:38,654
Pops, it was--
Sir, it was flawless.

886
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:41,667
I came in on a motorbike
in wheat-colored Levi's--

887
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:44,499
I beg of you, Philippe,
please don't get carried away.

888
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:47,507
Let me remind you that you are not
the star of this drama,

889
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:49,668
but merely a supporting player--

890
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:51,836
and a very minor one at that.

891
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,676
If life, like the theater,
came equipped with programs,

892
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:59,014
your billing, way down on the page
and in tiny letters,

893
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,782
would simply be "Second Policeman."

894
01:04:01,855 --> 01:04:04,120
As I was saying,

895
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:08,958
what he doesn't know, poor Rick,
is that the girl is ours.

896
01:04:09,028 --> 01:04:11,793
But can she be trusted?

897
01:04:11,865 --> 01:04:15,495
A creature of the streets
with a record as long as your arm?

898
01:04:15,568 --> 01:04:18,128
Nothing will go wrong,
my dear Philippe.

899
01:04:18,204 --> 01:04:21,800
There's a tiny, little chink
in Rick's armor-- a pretty face.

900
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:24,811
One way or another,
using such talent as she has,

901
01:04:24,878 --> 01:04:28,280
the girl will extract from him
the details of the plan.

902
01:04:28,348 --> 01:04:30,817
The plan.

903
01:04:30,884 --> 01:04:33,979
But should they not be followed?
I have the car.

904
01:04:34,053 --> 01:04:37,080
There would be no point.
On the streets, Rick is a master.

905
01:04:37,156 --> 01:04:40,957
There's no policeman alive
who can stay on his trail.

906
01:04:41,027 --> 01:04:44,122
- Yes. No.
- No.

907
01:04:44,197 --> 01:04:46,666
I shall sit here,
have a glorious lunch--

908
01:04:46,733 --> 01:04:51,330
everything to be cooked in
this nonfattening safflower oil--

909
01:04:51,404 --> 01:04:53,839
And eventually,
having followed my luncheon...

910
01:04:53,907 --> 01:04:56,172
with several <i>digestifs</i>
and a short walk,

911
01:04:56,242 --> 01:05:01,545
rejoin my friend tonight for
the climax of his adventures at--

912
01:05:01,614 --> 01:05:03,014
At...

913
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,952
the Eiffel Tower!

914
01:05:06,019 --> 01:05:08,181
Brilliant, Inspector. Brilliant.

915
01:05:16,195 --> 01:05:19,461
- To the studio, Francois.
- Studio?

916
01:05:19,532 --> 01:05:22,297
I told you I have to stop in
at my office...

917
01:05:22,368 --> 01:05:24,963
and pick something up there.

918
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:27,633
Have you ever been inside
a motion picture studio?

919
01:05:27,707 --> 01:05:30,142
No. Are you in the movie business?

920
01:05:30,209 --> 01:05:32,474
In a way.

921
01:05:32,545 --> 01:05:36,812
The studio is particularly
marvelous on a holiday like this.

922
01:05:36,883 --> 01:05:39,478
Silent. Empty.

923
01:05:39,552 --> 01:05:42,488
The vast sound stages
completely deserted.

924
01:05:44,057 --> 01:05:46,151
Like the night before Christmas,

925
01:05:46,225 --> 01:05:48,387
not a creature is stirring.

926
01:06:14,354 --> 01:06:16,516
Wait here. I won't be long.

927
01:06:23,529 --> 01:06:25,964
Mmm. Nice-ish.

928
01:06:26,032 --> 01:06:28,297
Isn't it.

929
01:06:28,368 --> 01:06:30,963
I-I don't understand.
Are you an actor?

930
01:06:31,037 --> 01:06:33,632
A writer? Producer? Director?

931
01:06:33,706 --> 01:06:38,474
Nothing as creative. My interest
in pictures is purely financial.

932
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:45,815
Gracious. I can't tell you
how exciting this is for me.

933
01:06:45,885 --> 01:06:47,820
I just love movies.

934
01:06:47,887 --> 01:06:51,881
Not those new-wave pictures
where nothing happens, of course.

935
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:54,484
What I like-- uh...

936
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,791
Westerns.

937
01:06:56,863 --> 01:07:02,302
Good old pictures with switches
and switches on switches and...

938
01:07:02,368 --> 01:07:04,303
things like that.

939
01:07:10,176 --> 01:07:12,611
Do you happen to have
an emery board in your purse?

940
01:07:12,679 --> 01:07:16,172
- Those things to file the nails?
- I think so.

941
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:19,785
Thank you.

942
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:24,449
I particularly like movies with
complicated robberies, don't you?

943
01:07:24,524 --> 01:07:26,755
Absolutely.

944
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:32,462
I know this sounds childish, but
next to pictures about robberies,

945
01:07:32,532 --> 01:07:34,626
I think I like
horror pictures best.

946
01:07:34,701 --> 01:07:36,636
I always have.

947
01:07:36,703 --> 01:07:40,299
When I was a girl,
I was in love with Dracula.

948
01:07:40,373 --> 01:07:44,970
<i>My mother was very upset.
She thought it was unhealthy.</i>

949
01:07:45,044 --> 01:07:49,482
She used to say, "That vampire's
old enough to be your father!"

950
01:07:49,549 --> 01:07:52,144
Whom, she would add,
he in many ways resembles.

951
01:07:52,218 --> 01:07:57,589
I'm glad-- not that your father
resembled Dracula.

952
01:07:57,657 --> 01:08:01,185
Which he didn't, at least not
after he had his teeth fixed.

953
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,264
But that you are interested
in pictures.

954
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,766
That makes two things
we have in common.

955
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,998
Movies... and giraffes.

956
01:08:14,373 --> 01:08:17,832
Here are the keys. Meet you
at the gate in a half an hour.

957
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:42,627
Giraffes and movies.
It's a small world, isn't it?

958
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:45,297
Let me see that!

959
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:48,535
Oh! No, no.
Please, Rick, you're hurting me.

960
01:08:48,608 --> 01:08:51,203
The lipstick.
It's been written with.

961
01:08:51,277 --> 01:08:53,212
The napkin!

962
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,272
The napkin you gave Gillet,
what was on it?

963
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,877
What was on it?

964
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:06,055
<i>You--</i>

965
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,954
Oh!

966
01:10:57,003 --> 01:11:00,303
Stop, Rick! Stop.
I'll shoot. I swear I will.

967
01:11:05,211 --> 01:11:08,807
- Mr. Benson, what happens next?
- I don't know.

968
01:11:08,881 --> 01:11:11,316
I don't know.

969
01:11:11,384 --> 01:11:13,410
That's as far as I got.

970
01:11:13,886 --> 01:11:15,411
- Mr. Benson.
- Yes?

971
01:11:15,488 --> 01:11:18,322
You know what I think? I think
there's going to be another--

972
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:22,658
What, a switch on a switch on
a switch on a switch on a switch...

973
01:11:22,728 --> 01:11:25,163
on a switch on a switch...
on a switch?

974
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:29,999
Working for Roger Roussin
was never like this.

975
01:11:30,069 --> 01:11:32,004
Wonder if he knows
about switches...

976
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:34,006
and switches on switches...

977
01:11:34,073 --> 01:11:36,167
and switches on switches
on switches.

978
01:11:36,242 --> 01:11:39,337
I don't think so. If he did,
it would change his whole life.

979
01:11:39,412 --> 01:11:41,677
Suddenly, not only would
they not be playing Scrabble,

980
01:11:41,747 --> 01:11:44,239
they would also
not be playing Parcheesi.

981
01:11:46,519 --> 01:11:48,988
I must say, the mind reels.

982
01:11:50,122 --> 01:11:53,286
- Anyway, you know what I think?
- Yes.

983
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:57,524
She is not really a creature of
the streets with a police record.

984
01:11:57,596 --> 01:12:00,395
You think she's an American
intelligence agent.

985
01:12:00,466 --> 01:12:04,460
Well, Miss Simpson,
you happen to be wrong.

986
01:12:04,537 --> 01:12:08,804
Our Gaby happens to be
that most reliable, steadfast,

987
01:12:08,874 --> 01:12:13,471
and you-cannot-possibly-
miss-with character...

988
01:12:13,546 --> 01:12:15,811
in all popular literature.

989
01:12:15,881 --> 01:12:18,544
The prostitute
with a heart of gold.

990
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:23,989
No. Actually, the "P" with
the "H" of "G," is second-most.

991
01:12:24,056 --> 01:12:26,491
The most is Frankenstein.

992
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:30,655
Sure. Someone who creates
or remakes another human being...

993
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:34,667
and either falls in love with it
or it destroys him.

994
01:12:34,734 --> 01:12:37,067
It can go either way.

995
01:12:37,136 --> 01:12:40,004
That's what gives it
such flexibility.

996
01:12:41,907 --> 01:12:45,002
Miss Simpson,
did you ever realize...

997
01:12:45,077 --> 01:12:48,172
that <i>Frankenstein</i>
and <i>My Fair Lady...</i>

998
01:12:48,247 --> 01:12:50,239
are the same story?

999
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,481
One ends happily...

1000
01:12:53,552 --> 01:12:55,783
and the other one doesn't.

1001
01:12:55,855 --> 01:12:57,915
Think about that for a while.

1002
01:13:01,494 --> 01:13:03,793
You smell wonderful.

1003
01:13:03,863 --> 01:13:05,957
That's the bath oil.

1004
01:13:06,032 --> 01:13:09,366
When I took my bath this morning,
I put some bath oil in.

1005
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:13,305
Only a few drops, of course.

1006
01:13:13,372 --> 01:13:17,207
For which I am most grateful,
for both our sakes.

1007
01:13:18,711 --> 01:13:21,112
Now, uh, where were we?

1008
01:13:22,214 --> 01:13:24,649
Bang, bang, bang!
That's where we were.

1009
01:13:24,717 --> 01:13:26,811
Or rather, where <i>you</i> were.

1010
01:13:26,886 --> 01:13:30,152
She was standing with a gun,
and he was moving toward her.

1011
01:13:30,222 --> 01:13:33,056
I don't see how <i>Frankenstein</i>
and <i>My Fair Lady</i> are the same.

1012
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,495
Oh, yes, I do.

1013
01:13:36,562 --> 01:13:40,158
Professor Higgins created Liza,
Frankenstein created the monster.

1014
01:13:40,232 --> 01:13:42,565
Oh, yes. Of course.

1015
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:46,005
But don't tell anybody.

1016
01:13:46,072 --> 01:13:49,907
I'm saving it for the textbook
on the art of screenplay writing.

1017
01:13:51,744 --> 01:13:56,682
Uh-huh. He's chased her through
the jungle and all that stuff.

1018
01:13:56,749 --> 01:14:00,186
Blah, blah, blah.
And, uh, past the bathtub--

1019
01:14:00,252 --> 01:14:02,949
If you think there's going to be
a Benson movie without a bathtub,

1020
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:04,957
you're out of your head.

1021
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:07,118
And into the bedroom.

1022
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:10,129
She pulls out a gun,
blah, blah, blah, blah,

1023
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,131
and, uh...

1024
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:15,566
my dear big magic-eyed,

1025
01:14:15,634 --> 01:14:18,627
<i>bath-oil-scented Miss Simpson,</i>

1026
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:21,003
<i>is where we are.</i>

1027
01:14:22,942 --> 01:14:27,573
Slowly...
Rick continues toward her.

1028
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,981
Go ahead. Pull the trigger.

1029
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:35,385
Don't reach for your gun.
I'm warning you.

1030
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:45,830
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

1031
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:47,890
Light?

1032
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,400
Well, Rick...

1033
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:03,343
do you mind if I get out
of these wet shoes?

1034
01:15:05,684 --> 01:15:08,984
And so my big magic-eyed Gaby...

1035
01:15:10,523 --> 01:15:13,459
who came to Paris to...

1036
01:15:13,526 --> 01:15:15,791
live...

1037
01:15:18,364 --> 01:15:21,391
turns out to be
a spy for the police,

1038
01:15:21,467 --> 01:15:23,402
an informer,

1039
01:15:23,469 --> 01:15:25,631
a common stool pigeon.

1040
01:15:25,704 --> 01:15:27,639
No, Rick. Don't say it!

1041
01:15:27,706 --> 01:15:30,232
It's that devil Gillet.
Oh, how I hate him!

1042
01:15:30,309 --> 01:15:32,244
He's relentless!

1043
01:15:32,311 --> 01:15:35,475
He'll stop at nothing
until he tracks you down.

1044
01:15:35,548 --> 01:15:38,814
He'll never forgive himself
for what happened in Tangier...

1045
01:15:38,884 --> 01:15:40,819
or the year before in Hong Kong.

1046
01:15:40,886 --> 01:15:42,980
You are his obsession!

1047
01:15:43,055 --> 01:15:45,991
He is a mad, overweight
Captain Ahab...

1048
01:15:46,058 --> 01:15:50,018
searching down you,
his Moby Dick, his white whale.

1049
01:15:50,095 --> 01:15:52,758
- And you?
- Me?

1050
01:15:52,831 --> 01:15:54,766
I'm nothing.

1051
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:57,997
A creature of the streets with
a record as long as your arm.

1052
01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:01,507
He had me paroled just for this--
to be the irresistible bait...

1053
01:16:01,574 --> 01:16:04,510
squirming on the end
of the hook he has prepared.

1054
01:16:04,577 --> 01:16:07,638
If I do not extract the plan
that you have been building...

1055
01:16:07,713 --> 01:16:10,774
step by painful step
for the last year,

1056
01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:13,876
my life, well, it's over.

1057
01:16:13,953 --> 01:16:17,287
Back I go behind the bars.
<i>Maedchen in Uniform</i> once more.

1058
01:16:17,356 --> 01:16:19,291
No longer Gabrielle nor Gaby,

1059
01:16:19,358 --> 01:16:21,623
but simply a number.

1060
01:16:21,694 --> 01:16:23,720
If, however, I succeed--

1061
01:16:23,796 --> 01:16:27,324
- And if you succeed?
- Freedom!

1062
01:16:27,399 --> 01:16:31,666
What exactly do you have to do
to extract this plan?

1063
01:16:33,372 --> 01:16:35,307
Anything.

1064
01:16:35,374 --> 01:16:37,309
- Anything?
- Anything.

1065
01:16:37,376 --> 01:16:41,472
It's not so hard. I, too,
am a highly paid professional.

1066
01:16:41,547 --> 01:16:47,487
Well, not so highly paid as you,
perhaps, but still a profession.

1067
01:16:47,553 --> 01:16:49,715
We're two of a kind, you and I.

1068
01:16:49,788 --> 01:16:54,658
There's no reason for us
to be enemies. We can perhaps be...

1069
01:16:54,727 --> 01:16:56,821
friends.

1070
01:16:56,895 --> 01:16:58,989
Perhaps.

1071
01:17:04,637 --> 01:17:07,664
<i>Their two bodies,
now moving as one,</i>

1072
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:12,110
<i>roll like breakers crashing
on an undiscovered shore.</i>

1073
01:17:12,177 --> 01:17:15,773
<i>And now... now...</i>

1074
01:17:15,848 --> 01:17:20,115
<i>we slowly... and lingeringly...</i>

1075
01:17:20,185 --> 01:17:22,177
<i>dissolve.</i>

1076
01:17:24,189 --> 01:17:26,124
Gracious.

1077
01:17:27,426 --> 01:17:29,952
Exactly, Miss Simpson. Well said.

1078
01:17:30,029 --> 01:17:32,692
You might even add
"Heavens to Betsy."

1079
01:17:34,867 --> 01:17:37,132
What's the matter?
Don't you like it?

1080
01:17:37,202 --> 01:17:41,572
Oh, I like it, but do you think
you can get away with it?

1081
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:45,475
Get away with it?
Get away with what?

1082
01:17:45,544 --> 01:17:48,412
It's just that scene with them
in the bed like that--

1083
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,415
it's, uh, rather suggestive.

1084
01:17:50,482 --> 01:17:52,417
Don't you think
the censors will object?

1085
01:17:52,484 --> 01:17:54,976
How can they possibly object?

1086
01:17:55,054 --> 01:17:57,489
- We dissolved, didn't we?
- Yes, but--

1087
01:17:57,556 --> 01:18:00,651
Miss Simpson, as I said before,

1088
01:18:00,726 --> 01:18:03,594
a dissolve is a most useful device.

1089
01:18:03,662 --> 01:18:06,598
Not only can it take you
from one place to another,

1090
01:18:06,665 --> 01:18:12,002
but it also leaves what's happening
on the screen to your imagination.

1091
01:18:13,539 --> 01:18:15,974
Now, if I were you, Miss Simpson,

1092
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:19,637
I would stop going to
those sinful art theaters...

1093
01:18:19,712 --> 01:18:25,515
and start seeing more wholesome
American family-type pictures.

1094
01:18:25,584 --> 01:18:29,521
I don't know what you think
they're doing on that bed,

1095
01:18:29,588 --> 01:18:33,787
but I take the position
that they're playing...

1096
01:18:33,859 --> 01:18:35,851
Parcheesi.

1097
01:18:50,876 --> 01:18:53,812
As much as I've enjoyed
our little game,

1098
01:18:53,879 --> 01:18:56,474
it's almost 8:30.

1099
01:18:56,548 --> 01:18:59,143
Time for the climax
of our glorious day.

1100
01:18:59,218 --> 01:19:01,210
We must be off.

1101
01:19:01,286 --> 01:19:03,278
Off? Where to?

1102
01:19:03,355 --> 01:19:05,415
You know perfectly well where.

1103
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:09,155
To the costume party at
the Eiffel Tower to finish the job.

1104
01:19:09,228 --> 01:19:13,165
No, Rick, you mustn't.
You can't go through with the plan.

1105
01:19:13,232 --> 01:19:16,361
Gillet will be there and the place
will be surrounded by police.

1106
01:19:16,435 --> 01:19:20,770
Gillet was in Tangier last year.
The entire city was surrounded.

1107
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,865
Now, if you'll excuse me--

1108
01:19:22,941 --> 01:19:25,843
Where <i>are</i> you going?

1109
01:19:26,311 --> 01:19:30,180
To the wardrobe department
to find something for us to wear.

1110
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:04,714
<i>I always carry a packet
of bubble bath in my purse,</i>

1111
01:20:04,783 --> 01:20:07,844
and I'm getting on swimmingly.

1112
01:20:11,256 --> 01:20:13,248
Howdy...

1113
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,688
stranger.

1114
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:22,228
You must be the new schoolmarm.

1115
01:20:28,373 --> 01:20:30,501
I hate to rush you, ma'am,

1116
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:32,841
but it's gettin' late.

1117
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:36,006
How long will it take you
to get outta that tub,

1118
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:39,347
into this costume
and out to the car?

1119
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:44,356
Absolutely no time at all.

1120
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,867
Now, according to my master plan,
the time has come...

1121
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:59,530
for me to take the most
dangerous step of all.

1122
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:02,074
Yes, Rick?

1123
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:05,076
I must trust you
and tell you the details.

1124
01:21:05,143 --> 01:21:07,476
I can trust you, can't I, Gaby?

1125
01:21:07,546 --> 01:21:09,481
How can you ask, Rick?

1126
01:21:09,548 --> 01:21:14,486
After our Parcheesi game,
I am yours forever and ever.

1127
01:21:14,553 --> 01:21:19,719
Can I trust you, Gaby?
Can I <i>really</i> trust you?

1128
01:21:31,069 --> 01:21:34,836
In the back of this car
there are 28 cans of film.

1129
01:21:34,907 --> 01:21:38,503
The party is being given
by the producer of the picture.

1130
01:21:38,577 --> 01:21:41,172
You can tell me the plan
in a minute, Rick.

1131
01:21:41,246 --> 01:21:44,512
It's a long drive
to the Eiffel Tower,

1132
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,576
and traffic is heavy.

1133
01:22:24,222 --> 01:22:26,214
Mr. Benson.

1134
01:22:27,392 --> 01:22:29,452
Rick.

1135
01:22:30,729 --> 01:22:33,563
Gaby, maybe, but I'm not--

1136
01:22:34,733 --> 01:22:37,225
Well, I'm not that kind of a girl.

1137
01:22:43,408 --> 01:22:47,743
Oh, I can't <i>stand</i> girls
who say things like that.

1138
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:54,345
Oh, dear.

1139
01:22:54,419 --> 01:22:57,412
I guess maybe we <i>are</i>
that kind of a girl.

1140
01:23:06,365 --> 01:23:08,800
<i>Exterior.</i>

1141
01:23:08,867 --> 01:23:11,234
<i>Eiffel Tower. Night.</i>

1142
01:23:11,303 --> 01:23:14,796
<i>Rick and Gaby have been driving
and driving and driving.</i>

1143
01:23:14,873 --> 01:23:17,638
<i>Through all that
marvelous traffic.</i>

1144
01:23:17,709 --> 01:23:19,803
<i>Mmm.</i>

1145
01:23:21,546 --> 01:23:24,482
<i>- The tower is ablaze--
- Richard...</i>

1146
01:23:24,549 --> 01:23:26,484
<i>how can I type if you’re going to--</i>

1147
01:23:26,551 --> 01:23:29,385
<i>All right. All right.</i>

1148
01:23:29,454 --> 01:23:32,982
<i>The tower is ablaze,
and the limousines are pulling up--</i>

1149
01:23:33,058 --> 01:23:38,224
<i>Miss Simpson, how can I dictate
if you're going to-- Mmm.</i>

1150
01:23:45,904 --> 01:23:48,169
Trust me, darling.

1151
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,404
I do. We go.

1152
01:23:55,747 --> 01:24:00,014
<i>And now, Rick and Gaby
make their way to the elevator,</i>

1153
01:24:00,085 --> 01:24:04,455
<i>which will carry them</i> and <i>us</i>
<i>to the inevitable party scene...</i>

1154
01:24:04,523 --> 01:24:07,960
<i>so dear to the hearts
of mo vie directors everywhere.</i>

1155
01:24:08,026 --> 01:24:10,461
<i>It's summertime,</i>
<i>and the</i> vita <i>is dolce,</i>

1156
01:24:10,529 --> 01:24:13,795
<i>breakfast is at Tiffany's
and everybody is high.</i>

1157
01:24:41,026 --> 01:24:44,155
<i>Now that the director
has distracted the audience...</i>

1158
01:24:44,229 --> 01:24:46,494
<i>with these totally
extraneous vignettes,</i>

1159
01:24:46,565 --> 01:24:49,399
<i>he reluctantly
returns to the plot...</i>

1160
01:24:49,468 --> 01:24:53,337
<i>and another new character--
the producer, host and victim,</i>

1161
01:24:53,405 --> 01:24:58,537
<i>who looks like my producer
and victim, Alexander Meyerheim.</i>

1162
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,953
If you will look to the left
as casually as possible,

1163
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:18,462
you will see that idiot Gillet...

1164
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,694
dressed appropriately enough
as an executioner.

1165
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:36,207
- Ready, darling?
- Ready, darling.

1166
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:46,384
Excuse me for a moment, darling.

1167
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:53,324
- You're late.
- Untrue, Gillet.

1168
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:56,334
Everything is going
precisely according to plan.

1169
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,996
- And the plan. Do you have it?
- Of course.

1170
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:01,403
While not exactly highly paid,
I'm at least...

1171
01:26:01,473 --> 01:26:03,408
a professional.

1172
01:26:31,736 --> 01:26:34,638
If you will be good enough
to read this,

1173
01:26:34,706 --> 01:26:38,199
I believe the entire situation
will become clear immediately.

1174
01:26:44,649 --> 01:26:47,881
At this very moment,
he's delivering the ransom note.

1175
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:51,253
- The ransom note?
- Exactly.

1176
01:26:51,323 --> 01:26:54,816
He has in the trunk of his car
28 reels of film.

1177
01:26:54,893 --> 01:26:57,488
They are the negative
and only existing work print...

1178
01:26:57,562 --> 01:27:00,657
of the producer's just completed
$6-million spectacle,

1179
01:27:00,732 --> 01:27:03,258
<i>The Girl Who Stole
the Eiffel Tower.</i>

1180
01:27:03,335 --> 01:27:07,272
You have both the negative
and the only work print?

1181
01:27:07,339 --> 01:27:09,274
Absolutely.

1182
01:27:09,341 --> 01:27:12,470
And it is your serious intention
to destroy them?

1183
01:27:12,544 --> 01:27:15,446
Unless you turn over to me,
at once,

1184
01:27:15,513 --> 01:27:18,972
the key to your safe deposit box
in your bank in Casablanca.

1185
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:20,985
My dear boy,

1186
01:27:21,052 --> 01:27:23,920
I haven't the faintest idea
who you are,

1187
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:25,981
but you are beautiful.

1188
01:27:27,726 --> 01:27:31,185
Absolutely beautiful.

1189
01:27:31,263 --> 01:27:35,223
Not only that,
you've saved my life.

1190
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:40,068
<i>The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower</i>
is, frankly, a disaster.

1191
01:27:40,138 --> 01:27:42,073
The title, by the way, is symbolic.

1192
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:45,076
She doesn't actually steal it.
At least I don't think she does.

1193
01:27:45,143 --> 01:27:47,476
But the end's so confusing,
it's hard to tell.

1194
01:27:47,545 --> 01:27:52,483
Anyway, the script is so ghastly
that it could never be released.

1195
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:55,486
I was finished, done for.
This party tonight...

1196
01:27:55,553 --> 01:27:58,489
was planned as a final
farewell gesture.

1197
01:27:58,556 --> 01:28:00,491
A sort of swan song.

1198
01:28:00,558 --> 01:28:04,086
When the check was presented,
it was my plan to sign it,

1199
01:28:04,162 --> 01:28:07,360
add a lavish,
if purely imaginary, tip,

1200
01:28:07,432 --> 01:28:12,268
and as the fireworks were exploding
in the black velvet sky,

1201
01:28:12,337 --> 01:28:16,433
to hurl myself from the top
of this grotesque edifice.

1202
01:28:16,508 --> 01:28:20,604
Now, suddenly, at the last minute,
in the nick of time--

1203
01:28:20,679 --> 01:28:22,773
Don't tell me
there isn't someone up there...

1204
01:28:22,847 --> 01:28:24,873
who watches
over whimsical movie producers--

1205
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:26,418
you appear!

1206
01:28:26,484 --> 01:28:29,352
Unbelievable!

1207
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:33,449
If you swear to me
that you will destroy this film,

1208
01:28:33,525 --> 01:28:35,460
hook, line and sinker,

1209
01:28:35,527 --> 01:28:38,122
not only will I give you the key...

1210
01:28:38,196 --> 01:28:42,725
to my safe deposit box
in Casablanca,

1211
01:28:42,801 --> 01:28:47,296
but we will split
the insurance... 60/40.

1212
01:28:47,372 --> 01:28:49,967
Fifty/fifty.

1213
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:51,976
Oh, my darling.

1214
01:28:52,043 --> 01:28:55,980
If ever you consider going into
the motion picture business,

1215
01:28:56,047 --> 01:28:57,982
do not hesitate to call me.

1216
01:28:58,049 --> 01:29:00,484
I've been searching
for a partner like you all my life.

1217
01:29:00,552 --> 01:29:03,420
We understand each other perfectly.

1218
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:06,253
You're so beautiful.

1219
01:29:06,324 --> 01:29:09,920
It's a rugged,
but curiously sensitive face.

1220
01:29:09,995 --> 01:29:12,988
It's so beautiful!

1221
01:29:15,867 --> 01:29:18,928
His plane is waiting for him
at Le Bourget Airport.

1222
01:29:19,004 --> 01:29:22,099
His chauffeur is even now
warming up the engines.

1223
01:29:22,173 --> 01:29:24,108
Good girl.

1224
01:29:24,175 --> 01:29:26,110
Tomorrow your entire
police record...

1225
01:29:26,177 --> 01:29:28,271
will disappear oh-so-mysteriously
from my files,

1226
01:29:28,346 --> 01:29:30,281
and you will be free.

1227
01:29:30,348 --> 01:29:33,011
Thank you, my dear Gillet.

1228
01:29:43,528 --> 01:29:45,724
And now, Gillet,
if you will be good enough...

1229
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:48,130
to quite casually
dance me across the floor...

1230
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:50,134
and over to
the gentlemen's lounge--

1231
01:29:50,201 --> 01:29:52,727
You fool! You little fool.

1232
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:56,639
He's using you like he did that
poor girl last year in Tangier.

1233
01:29:56,708 --> 01:29:59,143
Keep dancing, Gillet.

1234
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:03,477
I should have known that man
is irresistible to women.

1235
01:30:03,548 --> 01:30:07,485
He is, my dear Gillet.
Keep dancing!

1236
01:30:07,552 --> 01:30:10,317
You fool. You little fool.

1237
01:30:28,907 --> 01:30:32,241
I've worked the whole thing out
with my analyst.

1238
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:36,675
I don't really hate
Inspector Gillet.

1239
01:30:36,748 --> 01:30:38,910
I just feel sorry for him.

1240
01:30:40,418 --> 01:30:43,684
He insists on projecting himself
into the starring role...

1241
01:30:43,755 --> 01:30:46,589
and relegating me
to some minor character.

1242
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:51,857
Got me waiting for him
outside the Eiffel Tower. Okay.

1243
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:55,367
Got me saying lines like
"Brilliant, Inspector. Brilliant,"

1244
01:30:55,433 --> 01:30:58,528
or, uh, "I have the car
right here, sir."

1245
01:31:01,272 --> 01:31:03,969
- Maurice.
- Inspector,

1246
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,477
I am <i>Philippe.</i>

1247
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:10,481
It doesn't matter. Rick is making
his escape at Bourget Airport.

1248
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:12,540
Where is my car?

1249
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:16,654
Uh, I have the car
right here, sir.

1250
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:18,986
You read that line beautifully,
Maurice.

1251
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:22,994
Inspector, please.
I-- I am not Maurice.

1252
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:24,996
I am Philippe.

1253
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:27,760
My dear boy,
you are a minor character,

1254
01:31:27,832 --> 01:31:29,892
and your name
is of no importance.

1255
01:31:29,968 --> 01:31:32,563
Now, you were saying
something about the car.

1256
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:37,804
I have the car right here, sir.
Ayyy.

1257
01:31:55,793 --> 01:31:58,592
Faster, Maurice! Faster!

1258
01:31:58,663 --> 01:32:00,598
Faster, <i>Philippe. Faster.</i>

1259
01:32:00,665 --> 01:32:04,864
I keep forgetting.
My God, you are a dull character,

1260
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:07,633
even in the nontaxing role
of second policeman.

1261
01:32:11,242 --> 01:32:13,404
Bourget Airport! Quickly!

1262
01:32:20,585 --> 01:32:23,145
But if you are the inspector,
then who--

1263
01:32:23,221 --> 01:32:25,816
You are only third policeman
and shouldn't have any lines,

1264
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:27,483
so shut up and drive.

1265
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,495
- Do you know what this is?
- The key!

1266
01:32:38,570 --> 01:32:43,907
The key to our future and
$1 million worth of happiness...

1267
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:46,638
for the two of us.

1268
01:32:49,681 --> 01:32:53,311
Inspector Gillet of Interpol here
calling all <i>voitures.</i>

1269
01:33:09,033 --> 01:33:11,002
Faster! Faster!

1270
01:33:28,419 --> 01:33:30,820
Uh, the gate, sir. It is closed.

1271
01:33:30,888 --> 01:33:33,084
Then go through it, you fool!

1272
01:33:47,739 --> 01:33:51,767
- Wait here. I'll take him alone.
- Inspector, can I speak to you?

1273
01:33:54,679 --> 01:33:57,911
You're Rick!

1274
01:33:57,982 --> 01:34:02,420
- But I don't understand.
- You're not supposed to.

1275
01:34:02,487 --> 01:34:05,514
Can't you get it through your mind?
You're only a bit part.

1276
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:07,525
Nobody cares anything about you.

1277
01:34:07,592 --> 01:34:10,960
You're a mere literary convenience,

1278
01:34:11,029 --> 01:34:14,966
someone for the hero to punch
in the jaw at the correct moment.

1279
01:34:15,033 --> 01:34:18,868
And that moment, I'm happy
to state, has finally arrived!

1280
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:34,615
Stop, Rick!

1281
01:34:34,686 --> 01:34:37,656
Stop or I'll shoot!

1282
01:34:37,722 --> 01:34:40,385
Philippe!

1283
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:43,451
Philippe!

1284
01:34:44,829 --> 01:34:47,321
Mauri-- Philippe.

1285
01:35:02,747 --> 01:35:04,909
Darling.

1286
01:35:04,982 --> 01:35:06,917
It's all right.

1287
01:35:06,984 --> 01:35:08,953
Perhaps it's better this way.

1288
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:12,616
No, no, no, my darling.

1289
01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:14,955
We'll make it to Casablanca.

1290
01:35:15,026 --> 01:35:19,464
And when we get there,
we'll buy a darling little castle.

1291
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:23,467
With its own-- Unh-- private zoo.

1292
01:35:24,535 --> 01:35:27,471
And will there be giraffes?

1293
01:35:27,538 --> 01:35:31,373
Of course... giraffes.

1294
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:41,214
This is what it means to be a cop.

1295
01:35:43,888 --> 01:35:47,552
You're first policeman now.

1296
01:36:05,443 --> 01:36:09,437
<i>Thus, having proved
once again that crime does not pay,</i>

1297
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:11,449
<i>unless you happen to be me.</i>

1298
01:36:14,685 --> 01:36:16,950
<i>Fade out.</i>

1299
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:19,013
<i>The end.</i>

1300
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:29,296
<i>Well, there it is.</i>

1301
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:32,531
<i>All hundred
and thirty-odd pages of it.</i>

1302
01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:36,469
<i>Finished with...</i>

1303
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:38,703
hours to spare.

1304
01:36:41,379 --> 01:36:43,814
It's wonderful, Richard,

1305
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:46,476
only does it have to end that way?

1306
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:50,488
I mean, Philippe could miss
when he shoots.

1307
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:55,493
And Rick could tell the inspector
where the stolen film cans are...

1308
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:58,428
and give him back the key and...

1309
01:36:58,496 --> 01:37:01,159
he could explain
that now that he's met Gaby,

1310
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,100
he's retiring from
the liar-and-a-thief business.

1311
01:37:04,168 --> 01:37:08,936
Then the inspector might let them
go away together.

1312
01:37:09,006 --> 01:37:12,943
It could be the last
big switch on a switch.

1313
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:15,070
Couldn't it?

1314
01:37:15,146 --> 01:37:18,275
It won't work.

1315
01:37:18,349 --> 01:37:21,114
You see, he <i>is</i> a liar and a thief.

1316
01:37:21,185 --> 01:37:23,450
And he's been one for too long.

1317
01:37:23,521 --> 01:37:25,456
He can't retire now.

1318
01:37:25,523 --> 01:37:29,460
In addition to which,
he has become, I'm afraid,

1319
01:37:29,527 --> 01:37:31,689
a hack.

1320
01:37:33,865 --> 01:37:37,802
He may think he's all those things,
but she knows he's not.

1321
01:37:40,204 --> 01:37:43,140
What gives her
that curious idea?

1322
01:37:43,207 --> 01:37:45,802
She's been with him constantly
for the last few days.

1323
01:37:45,877 --> 01:37:51,282
She's seen him when he was shaking
with terror, ready to quit.

1324
01:37:51,349 --> 01:37:55,616
She's watched him
pull himself together again and...

1325
01:37:55,686 --> 01:37:58,656
she's also seen him be warm...

1326
01:37:58,723 --> 01:38:00,885
and tender...

1327
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:04,253
and funny.

1328
01:38:04,328 --> 01:38:06,263
Not famous,
international-wit funny,

1329
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:08,356
but really funny.

1330
01:38:10,001 --> 01:38:12,266
Do you think she's an idiot?

1331
01:38:12,336 --> 01:38:15,500
Do you think she doesn't know
what kind of man he is...

1332
01:38:17,174 --> 01:38:20,008
or what he needs?

1333
01:38:23,514 --> 01:38:26,848
And what he needs is L-O-V-E?

1334
01:38:33,357 --> 01:38:35,792
Uh-uh.

1335
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:38,455
It's too late.

1336
01:38:38,529 --> 01:38:41,158
<i>He's 43 years old.</i>

1337
01:38:41,232 --> 01:38:43,792
He will be this October.

1338
01:38:43,868 --> 01:38:45,962
Been married twice,

1339
01:38:46,037 --> 01:38:48,370
both times disastrously.

1340
01:38:49,473 --> 01:38:51,874
And there have been
too many years of...

1341
01:38:53,044 --> 01:38:55,479
too much dough,

1342
01:38:55,546 --> 01:38:57,981
too much bad writing,

1343
01:38:58,049 --> 01:39:00,041
and too much whiskey.

1344
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:05,913
He's got nothing left
inside to give.

1345
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:12,653
Even if he could, which he can't--

1346
01:39:12,730 --> 01:39:15,666
But that's not true, Richard.
You can. You <i>have.</i>

1347
01:39:15,733 --> 01:39:19,033
- I just love it.
<i>- No, you don't.</i>

1348
01:39:19,103 --> 01:39:21,072
It's lousy.

1349
01:39:23,007 --> 01:39:25,499
In any case, the problem is...

1350
01:39:28,346 --> 01:39:31,612
you're not in love with the script.

1351
01:39:31,682 --> 01:39:33,844
You're in love with me.

1352
01:39:35,186 --> 01:39:37,917
<i>And why shouldn't you be?</i>

1353
01:39:37,989 --> 01:39:40,788
Suddenly waltzing into your life...

1354
01:39:40,858 --> 01:39:45,193
comes this charming
and relatively handsome stranger.

1355
01:39:46,197 --> 01:39:48,223
Me.

1356
01:39:48,299 --> 01:39:53,795
Smooth as silk with a highly
practiced line of chatter...

1357
01:39:53,871 --> 01:39:58,969
specifically designed to knock
unsophisticated chicks...

1358
01:39:59,043 --> 01:40:01,137
like you, Miss Simpson,

1359
01:40:01,212 --> 01:40:03,477
right on their ears.

1360
01:40:03,547 --> 01:40:07,245
<i>Which, I'm terribly afraid,
I've done.</i>

1361
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:11,385
Well...

1362
01:40:11,455 --> 01:40:14,391
if it's the last decent thing
I do in this world,

1363
01:40:14,458 --> 01:40:18,122
and it very well may be,

1364
01:40:18,195 --> 01:40:20,494
<i>I'm going to fix that.</i>

1365
01:40:22,166 --> 01:40:25,659
I'm going to send you packing,
Miss Simpson...

1366
01:40:27,838 --> 01:40:30,740
<i>before I cause you serious...</i>

1367
01:40:32,410 --> 01:40:34,504
<i>and irrevocable...</i>

1368
01:40:34,578 --> 01:40:36,604
<i>harm.</i>

1369
01:40:36,681 --> 01:40:38,912
You want the truth?

1370
01:40:40,084 --> 01:40:42,246
<i>Of course you don't.</i>

1371
01:40:44,055 --> 01:40:46,581
I'll give it to you anyway.

1372
01:40:48,259 --> 01:40:52,196
I do not give one damn
about anything!

1373
01:40:52,263 --> 01:40:57,759
Certainly not my work,
as you so ingenuously call it.

1374
01:41:00,938 --> 01:41:03,567
No, that's not true.

1375
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:06,577
There is something I care about.

1376
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:11,173
Money. And good whiskey.

1377
01:41:11,248 --> 01:41:14,309
I am, as you've probably noticed,

1378
01:41:14,385 --> 01:41:16,479
rather fond of that.

1379
01:41:21,058 --> 01:41:23,186
But my work?

1380
01:41:24,562 --> 01:41:26,497
That's a hideous
little something...

1381
01:41:26,564 --> 01:41:29,500
that must occur
five days out of the year...

1382
01:41:29,567 --> 01:41:32,662
so I can spend the other 360...

1383
01:41:32,737 --> 01:41:35,502
in the manner to which
I have become--

1384
01:41:35,573 --> 01:41:38,338
and fully intend to remain--

1385
01:41:38,409 --> 01:41:40,901
accustomed.

1386
01:41:40,978 --> 01:41:43,914
<i>To you, Richard Benson.</i>

1387
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:50,587
To you... and your glorious
professional know-how.

1388
01:41:59,764 --> 01:42:03,064
Long may you wave.

1389
01:42:04,301 --> 01:42:08,170
<i>And may you go on...</i>

1390
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:17,379
fooling the people.

1391
01:43:15,039 --> 01:43:17,201
Miss Simpson? Mm.

1392
01:43:24,048 --> 01:43:26,210
Miss Simpson.

1393
01:43:39,396 --> 01:43:41,558
Gabrielle?

1394
01:46:01,538 --> 01:46:03,939
- Pardon, Maurice.
- Maurice?

1395
01:46:04,008 --> 01:46:06,102
No, no. Philippe.

1396
01:46:06,176 --> 01:46:08,771
Oh, come on.
You don't know when a joke is over.

1397
01:46:12,516 --> 01:46:15,452
- Ahh.
- Why, Mr. Benson.

1398
01:46:15,519 --> 01:46:17,511
What are you doing here?

1399
01:46:17,588 --> 01:46:21,355
Miss Simpson. Stop overacting.
You know what I'm doing here.

1400
01:46:21,425 --> 01:46:25,260
Of all the hokey, cornball,
grade-B picture devices--

1401
01:46:25,329 --> 01:46:27,764
She forgot the bird.
She forgot the bird.

1402
01:46:27,831 --> 01:46:31,165
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1403
01:46:31,235 --> 01:46:34,069
Girl leaves bird,
boy has to come looking for girl.

1404
01:46:34,138 --> 01:46:37,074
I've written that scene
a thousand times myself.

1405
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:40,805
Always works, of course.
That's point one.

1406
01:46:40,878 --> 01:46:44,974
Point two. How dare you quit me
when we haven't even started?

1407
01:46:45,049 --> 01:46:48,645
Point three. I love you.

1408
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:51,985
Miss Simpson, if you don't feel
you're up to your part of the job,

1409
01:46:52,056 --> 01:46:54,355
just tell me
and I can get somebody else.

1410
01:46:54,425 --> 01:46:58,123
Oh, no. I'm perfectly capable.

1411
01:46:58,195 --> 01:47:00,130
Very well then.

1412
01:47:00,197 --> 01:47:03,759
I hold here in my hand a hundred
and thirty-some odd pages...

1413
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:08,238
of contrived, utterly preposterous,
totally unmotivated--

1414
01:47:08,305 --> 01:47:10,604
Ooh! If you could
only say it in pictures--

1415
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:13,234
Come on. We've got
a screenplay to write.

1416
01:47:13,310 --> 01:47:16,610
Not from scratch, of course.
We've got two great characters.

1417
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,445
She's sweet and bright
and very, very beautiful.

1418
01:47:19,516 --> 01:47:21,781
And he, well--

1419
01:47:21,852 --> 01:47:23,946
Since he's gone straight,
he's rather dull.

1420
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:27,788
We've got to jazz him up,
find something for him to do.

1421
01:47:27,858 --> 01:47:30,123
Uh, some physical action.

1422
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:32,595
Uh, to accentuate
the masculine image.

1423
01:47:32,663 --> 01:47:34,962
There is something
in American movies.

1424
01:47:35,032 --> 01:47:39,128
It's a terrible cliche,
but you did use it in the script.

1425
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:42,298
Oh, yes.

1426
01:47:42,372 --> 01:47:44,864
<i>Whoo!</i>

1427
01:47:44,942 --> 01:47:47,912
I think maybe
we should, like, split!

1428
01:48:09,533 --> 01:48:11,866
Aah!

1429
01:49:21,338 --> 01:49:24,433
This new movie you're going
to write, what is it about?

1430
01:49:24,508 --> 01:49:26,443
It's a love story, naturally.

1431
01:49:26,510 --> 01:49:30,777
It will have a happy ending.
He won't get shot running?

1432
01:49:30,847 --> 01:49:33,112
On the contrary, Miss Simpson.

1433
01:49:33,183 --> 01:49:35,448
The music soars, and there,

1434
01:49:35,519 --> 01:49:38,455
totally oblivious of the fireworks,
the fountains,

1435
01:49:38,522 --> 01:49:40,957
and the holiday-mad throngs,

1436
01:49:41,024 --> 01:49:45,962
they fall happily and tenderly
into each other's arms.

1437
01:49:46,029 --> 01:49:48,624
- I know what will happen next.
- You do?

1438
01:49:48,699 --> 01:49:52,795
The two enormous and
highly paid heads come together...

1439
01:49:52,869 --> 01:49:55,805
for that ultimate
and inevitable moment.

1440
01:49:55,872 --> 01:49:58,467
The final, earth-moving,

1441
01:49:58,542 --> 01:50:02,479
studio-rent-paying,
theater-filling,

1442
01:50:02,546 --> 01:50:04,708
popcorn-selling--
