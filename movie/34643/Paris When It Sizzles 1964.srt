1
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,710
Memorandum to Paramount Pictures,

2
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,680
Hollywood, California,

3
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,990
from Alexander Meyerheim.
Subject - my latest production.

4
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:09,710
Gentlemen, while you sit back safely
in your air-conditioned offices

5
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,510
we here... in the trenches
are progressing brilliantly.

6
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,390
As to your anxieties
about the script, dismiss them.

7
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,630
I talked to the author in Paris.

8
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,110
He assures me that he has
at this moment 138 glorious pages

9
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,250
which are even now being typed. I
plan to join him in Paris on Sunday.

10
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,950
Period. Paragraph.

11
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,870
Gentlemen, success is inevitable.

12
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,350
An Alexander Meyerheim production

13
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,230
of an original story and screenplay
by Richard Benson.

14
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,950
- Richard Benson?
- You know him, my angel?

15
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,748
Know him?

16
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,834
I hate him! Richard Benson, phooey!

17
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,630
It seems there are facets of him
you know even better than I do.

18
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,190
I cannot imagine
when he finds time to write.

19
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,630
Unfortunately, he had time
to write a script for me.

20
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,000
The last ten pages were found

21
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,240
floating off Malibu,
in a vodka bottle.

22
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,390
Send the usual telegram to Benson.

23
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,860
Richard assures me that for all
practical purposes he's on the wagon.

24
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,342
It's open. Come in.

25
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,590
- Yes?
- Mr Benson?

26
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,988
You are the young lady
from the typing bureau?

27
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,528
I am.

28
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,817
If we are to have a happy
and harmonious relationship,

29
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,470
I beg you, never answer
a question with a question.

30
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,612
- Is that clear?
- Did I?

31
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,270
There you go again, answering
a question with a question.

32
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,910
My yes when you opened the door
was a question,

33
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,622
question mark implied, of course.

34
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,068
You know the difference
between implied and inferred?

35
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,468
Isn't that a question?

36
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,977
Yes.

37
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,742
Then you answered my question
with a question.

38
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,750
To imply is to indicate
without saying openly or directly,

39
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,491
to infer is to conclude
from something known or assumed.

40
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,376
- My name is Gabrielle Simpson.
- Is that a bird?

41
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,948
I was told the job would take several
days. I had nobody to leave him with.

42
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,200
Well, this is it. The office there,

43
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,190
I live up here,
the terrace is out there.

44
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,670
That grotesque object so prominent
on the horizon is the Eiffel Tower.

45
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,630
I had it moved there to remind me
what town I'm in.

46
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,470
If it offends you,
I'll have it taken away again.

47
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,350
You live through here.
It's an adjoining room

48
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,230
which no doubt to your mind
has terribly sinister connotations.

49
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,772
- Not at all...
- If so dismiss them.

50
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,470
I would have got you a room
down the hall

51
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,910
but the joint's filled up.
Bastille Day weekend, all that.

52
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,308
It's quite alright. I once worked
for an American novelist

53
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,030
who only wrote in the bathtub.
I'm used to anything.

54
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,910
You can unpack. In the bathtub?

55
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,550
Yes. I gave him a packet of
bubble bath and we got on swimmingly.

56
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,920
I see.

57
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,270
Does that imply that
the bird's name is Richelieu?

58
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,268
It's inferred, I believe,
rather than implied.

59
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,851
Swimmingly.
Interesting figure of speech.

60
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,016
You call the canary Richelieu
because you wanted a cardinal?

61
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,068
That's very funny.

62
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,057
No, it isn't.
Just one of the hazards of being

63
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,670
a famous international wit,
which I am. Have to keep trying.

64
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,790
I can't tell you how delighted I am
by this assignment, Mr Benson.

65
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,910
And to have the opportunity to work
with a screenwriter of your stature.

66
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,190
I'm interested in cinema myself.
I'm sure I can learn a great deal.

67
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,303
Thank you.

68
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,230
Last month I worked for Roger Roussin
the New Wave director. You know him?

69
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,200
I'm more of an Old Wave man.

70
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,110
The picture's terribly interesting.
Very avant-garde.

71
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,110
About people who go to this party
and decide not to play Scrabble.

72
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,365
<i>It was called The Scrabble Game
Will Not Take Place.</i>

73
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,422
His next one's about a girl
who won't have a birthday party -

74
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,486
<i>Blow Out No Candles.</i>

75
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,710
Roger believes what's important
on screen is what doesn't happen.

76
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,108
Does your film have a title yet?

77
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,480
Of course.

78
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,950
<i>The Girl Who Stole
the Eiffel Tower.</i>

79
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,790
<i>The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel
Tower. It sounds fascinating.</i>

80
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,988
The title is symbolic?

81
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,154
She doesn't really steal
the Eiffel Tower. Does she?

82
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,326
What's the story about?

83
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,310
It's an action-suspense, erm, ...

84
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,030
..romantic melodrama.
With lots of comedy, of course.

85
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,350
And deep down underneath
a substrata of social comment.

86
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,577
Oh. Well, if I could see
the pages you've written

87
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,845
I could estimate
the size of the typing job.

88
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,411
The pages, my dear girl,
are right here.

89
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,030
An Alexander Meyerheim production.

90
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,590
<i>The Girl Who Stole
the Eiffel Tower.</i>

91
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,110
Original story and screenplay by
Richard Benson.

92
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,830
Here, with a page or two
of interestingly photographed

93
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,470
establishing shots,
possibly from a helicopter,

94
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,830
- a boy and a girl meet.
- But Mr Benson...

95
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,870
Now, after some chitchat,

96
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,070
getting-to-know-you stuff,
which I do so brilliantly,

97
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,510
we feel an unconscious attraction
between the two.

98
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,590
An indication to the audience
of the tremulous beginnings of love.

99
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,817
And then, conflict!

100
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,590
We can tell by the music
how deeply fraught with danger

101
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,732
the whole situation is.

102
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,670
And now, ... our first switch.

103
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,350
The audience gasps when they realise
they've been fooled.

104
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,950
Things are not what they seem.
Not at all.

105
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,270
In fact, the whole situation
is completely reversed,

106
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:32,110
involving
the magnificently ingenious

107
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,708
switch... on the switch.

108
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,830
Amazed by the sudden turn of events,

109
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,713
the boy and girl realise how gravely
they've misjudged each other.

110
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,457
At that moment,

111
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,670
the music turns ominous once more.

112
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,670
They become aware of the danger
that they're in and the chase is on!

113
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,382
Spinning tyres, rooftops,

114
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,430
long shots of tiny figures racing
through the fear-gripped city.

115
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,830
When suddenly in a deserted alley
we see, seated on a garbage can,

116
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,057
licking its wet rain-bedraggled fur,

117
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,212
close shot, the cat!

118
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,870
Now, as we build
step by step to the climax,

119
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,497
the music soars.

120
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,862
And there, totally oblivious

121
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,070
of the torrential rain
pouring down upon them,

122
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,230
the two fall happily and tenderly
into each other's arms.

123
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,710
And as the audience drools
with sublimated sexual pleasure,

124
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,550
the two enormous and highly paid
heads come together

125
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,390
for that ultimate
and inevitable moment.

126
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,710
The final, earth-moving,

127
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,910
studio-rent-paying, theatre-filling,

128
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,708
popcorn-selling...

129
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,514
..kiss.

130
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,291
Fade out. The end.

131
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,622
That's it. 138 pages. Why make it
longer? We'd only have to cut later.

132
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,012
- Mr Benson...
- Yes?

133
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,908
This screenplay,
when does it have to be finished?

134
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,286
Well, let's see, today is Friday.

135
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,070
My friend and in this case patron
and producer Mr Alexander Meyerheim

136
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,582
arrives in Paris from Cannes
at ten o'clock on...

137
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,430
..Sunday morning.
Which happens to be Bastille Day.

138
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,470
Perfect! 10:01 we hand him
the completed script

139
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,710
and then you and I celebrate. Drink
champagne, dance in the streets,

140
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,852
whatever they do on July 14th.

141
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,925
You're very kind but I have a date.
You haven't written anything at all?

142
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,794
You have a date?

143
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,119
You mean this entire movie
has to be done in two days?

144
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,190
Miss Simpson, if you aren't up to
your part of the job, tell me now.

145
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,310
- I can find someone else.
- No, I didn't mean that.

146
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,990
It's just that it's,
well, rather unusual, isn't it?

147
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,446
Not for me.

148
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,230
I imagine you've given it
a great deal of thought?

149
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,857
No, I haven't.

150
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,468
So what have you been doing?

151
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,510
What any red-blooded
American screenwriter

152
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,566
would or should have been doing

153
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,950
for the first 19 and a fraction weeks
of his employment.

154
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,748
Water-skiing in St Tropez,

155
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,788
lying in the sun in Antibes,
studying Greek.

156
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,428
Greek?

157
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,390
There was this starlet
representing the Greek film industry

158
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,870
at the Cannes festival.

159
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,350
Then of course
a few weeks unlearning Greek,

160
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,910
which involved
a considerable amount of vodka

161
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,308
and an unpremeditated trip to Madrid
for the bullfights,

162
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,670
which fortunately, since
I can't bear the sight of blood,

163
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,726
had long since gone on to Seville.

164
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,430
Weeks 17 and 18 were spent
in the casino at Monte Carlo,

165
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,630
in a somewhat ill-advised attempt
to win enough money

166
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,310
to buy back my $5,000-a-week,
plus expenses, contract

167
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,990
from my friend, employer and patron,
Mr Alexander Meyerheim,

168
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,510
thus not having to write the picture
at all. Take a note.

169
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,710
For the textbook I will someday do
on the art of screenwriting,

170
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:14,030
never play 13, 31
and the corners thereof

171
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:18,142
for any serious length of time for
any serious money. It doesn't work.

172
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,480
And now I have to. Shall we begin?

173
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,590
An Alexander Meyerheim production.

174
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,531
<i>Caps, quotes. The Girl Who Stole
the Eiffel Tower.</i>

175
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,594
You do like the title?

176
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,870
Oh, yes,
it certainly sounds intriguing.

177
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,725
It intrigued Meyerheim, too.
He bought the title, script unseen.

178
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:44,190
Original story and screenplay
by Richard Benson.

179
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,790
Page one. Fade in. Exterior.
Paris, naturally.

180
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,588
Let's see, night or day?

181
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,583
Day.

182
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,662
Begin... with a shot of...
of the Eiffel Tower.

183
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,190
<i>The camera zooms in. Standing
windswept and alone on a platform</i>

184
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,788
<i>is a mysterious woman in black.
She glances at her watch.</i>

185
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,320
And we see...

186
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,830
How the hell do I know?
Mysterious woman in black.

187
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,228
Oh, how the mighty have fallen!

188
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,950
Mustn't be obvious. Don't give the
whole story too early. OK. Fade in.

189
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,062
Exterior, le Sacre Coeur. Day.

190
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,418
No...

191
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,177
Make that, erm, ...

192
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,332
..the Grand Palais.

193
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,440
Uh-uh.

194
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,702
We've got to give the audience

195
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,651
the taste and smell
of the real Paris.

196
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,223
OK.

197
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,950
<i>Exterior. Christian Dior.
The camera pans</i>

198
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,270
<i>"and now we see a white Rolls"-"Royce"
pull up and come to a stop.</i>

199
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,110
<i>No, wait a minute,
make that a white Bentley.</i>

200
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,908
<i>It's chicer.</i>

201
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,550
<i>A chauffeur in white livery
leaps out and opens the door.</i>

202
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,390
<i>From inside emerges
some classically glamorous star</i>

203
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,131
<i>like, erm, Marlene Dietrich.</i>

204
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,830
<i>And now she... Erm...</i>

205
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,114
<i>Dot, dot, dot.</i>

206
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,308
<i>She sweeps majestically
into the store and...</i>

207
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:32,270
That's all we see of her. Makes no
sense but Alex would have loved it.

208
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,639
He could have stolen the Bentley and
afte"rw"ards charged it to the picture.

209
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,390
- What d'you say your name was?
- Gabrielle Simpson.

210
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,302
- How long have you lived in Paris?
- Two years.

211
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,868
And you came here to write.

212
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,710
Well, that, too, but mostly to...

213
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,590
I don't know how to say it exactly.
Live.

214
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,217
Live?

215
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,812
Would you mind...?

216
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,230
You were saying
you came here to live.

217
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,942
Yes. For the first six months I made
a comprehensive study of depravity.

218
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,263
No kidding?

219
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,920
Seriously. Never got to bed
before eight in the morning.

220
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,110
Who knows how many cups of
poisonous black coffee I consumed?

221
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,870
I didn't drink then, so it was hard
to get totally into the spirit.

222
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,550
Depravity can be terribly boring
if you don't smoke or drink.

223
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,948
But a person must try to grow.

224
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,270
And the guy you're dating on Bastille
Day, is he part of the process?

225
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,310
No, he's just a friend.
A struggling young actor.

226
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,708
An actor?!

227
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,080
Ewww...

228
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,510
A tragic relationship to begin with.

229
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:47,310
I hope he's not a method actor, who
scratches and mumbles and pauses,

230
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,150
thereby destroying the impeccable
rhythm of the author's prose.

231
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,405
No, he's a little intense
but lots of fun.

232
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,292
Uh-huh? Yeah, well...

233
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,150
And you and this... actor, what
do you plan to do on Bastille Day?

234
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,630
We'll spend the whole day together.
First, breakfast at a little caf,

235
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,270
then we'll dance
from one end of Paris to the other,

236
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,270
opera at five, then the guards
and the singing of The Marseillaise,

237
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,726
off to Montmartre for the fireworks,

238
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,230
then supper and champagne
and, you know, live.

239
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,750
- You really like it, don't you?
- What?

240
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,548
Life.

241
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,160
Every morning when I wake up
and see a whole new other day,

242
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,145
I just go absolutely ape.

243
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,938
I've got an idea.

244
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,430
I got an idea!
The first good one in four months.

245
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,190
No, I had an idea to give up
drinking - it didn't photograph.

246
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,974
Now this could be good.
Very good indeed.

247
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,950
A simple story
of a simple Parisian working girl

248
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,950
and how she spends July 14th.
The whole picture plays in one day.

249
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,550
And I've got two days to write it.
Fade in. Exterior, Paris.

250
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,234
As our story begins
it's early Bastille Day morning.

251
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,600
And all the trumpets of Paris
are sounding reveille.

252
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,430
<i>Over a shot of the Arch of Triumph</i>

253

<i>superimpose

<i>Cut to the Eiffel Tower.
The main title.</i>

255
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,590
<i>The trumpets segue
into the inevitable title song.</i>

256
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,074
<i>Maybe we can get
Sinatra to sing it.</i>

257
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,550
<i>There follows an interminable list
of other credits</i>

258
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,590
<i>acknowledging the efforts of
all the quote little people unquote,</i>

259

263
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,082
<i>OK.</i>

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,312
<i>Fade out.</i>

265
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,310
<i>And fade in.

<i>where the holiday festivities

267

<i>A simple Parisian working girl,</i>

<i>who looks remarkably like you,
Miss Simpson,</i>

269

<i>emerges from

<i>With breathless anticipation
she awaits the arrival of her date.</i>

273
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,777
<i>Some... actor.</i>

274
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,594
<i>Now I suppose
we'll have to describe him.</i>

275
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,030
<i>I see him
as curiously unattractive.</i>

276
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,985
<i>Not at all. Philippe happens to be
very handsome.</i>

277
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,190
<i>In fact he looks rather like,
erm, Tony Curtis.</i>

278
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,931
<i>I see him as one of those
mumbling scratching actors</i>

279

<i>destined only for minor roles
and character parts.</i>

280
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,814
<i>And his name is not Philippe.
It's Maurice.</i>

281
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,326
Maurice!

282
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,468
Like, er, bonjour, baby.

283
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,308
- Bonjour, Maurice!
- Hey.

284
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,430
Oh, I'm so excited. I didn't sleep
a wink. Do you like my dress?

285
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,628
Yeah, very groovy.

286
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,430
Would it be too wicked
if instead of breakfast

287
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,550
we had a glass of champagne
right here?

288
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,306
Thanks.

289
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,806
Erm...

290
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,110
- Look, baby...
- Yes, Maurice?

291
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,980
This Bastille Day gig?

292
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,430
Like, erm,
we're gonna have to cool it.

293
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,400
But, Maurice, I don't understand.

294
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,950
Well, see, baby, I'm going to
have to cut. See, last night,

295
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,630
while I was making the scene
at le drug store,

296
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,390
erm, I was tearing an expresso
with a couple of local citizens

297
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:51,630
when, erm, all of a sudden
this New Wave-looking stud comes in

298
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,430
and says his name is Roger Roussin

299
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,190
and, like, he's making a film
about Bastille Day.

300
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,670
<i>No Dancing in the Streets.</i>

301
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,670
<i>No Dancing in the Streets?</i>

302
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,030
In Roger's flick it like,
erm, ... rains.

303
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,190
Anyway, he offers me the lead.

304
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,188
Oh, Maurice,
I'm, like, so happy for you.

305
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,510
See, I have to split. We're gonna be
shooting all day. In the sewers.

306
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,880
I see.

307
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,190
Hey, baby, I got wheels,
can I drop you?

308
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,117
No, thanks, I prefer to walk.

309
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,080
Crazy.

310
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,417
<i>Erm, tout I'heure.</i>

311
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,190
<i>With the almost lunatic narcissism</i>

312
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,670
<i>peculiar to his curious calling,</i>

313
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,310
<i>Maurice rather preciously mounts
his motor scooter.</i>

314
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,790
<i>Our heroine is left grief stricken,</i>

315
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,874
<i>not realising how much better off
she really is.</i>

316
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,252
They were going to spend
the whole day together!

317
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,990
My dear, you just witnessed
the first switch.

318
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,790
Maybe, but Maurice
would never behave that way.

319
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,074
Besides, his name is not Maurice,
it's Philippe.

320
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,790
So having successfully disposed of
her date for Bastille Day

321
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,788
we move on to important matters.
Conflict.

322
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,103
Conflict?

323
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,074
The other man.

324
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,452
The third corner
of the obligatory triangle.

325
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,697
<i>Didn't Roger whatshisname,
the No Scrabble director,</i>

326
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,451
teach you anything
about writing movies?

327
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,954
No...

328
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,870
- For a moment, Gabby sits there...
- Gabby?

329
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,268
We've got to call her something.

330
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,190
For a moment, Gabby sits there.

331
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,188
A lonely and pathetic figure.

332
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,350
But unbeknownst to her,
this heart-breaking little scene

333
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,234
has been witnessed by...

334
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,526
..dot, dot, dot, ...

335
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,150
..a mysterious stranger.

336
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,806
A mysterious stranger, how exciting.

337
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,142
Miss Simpson,
before you escape the confines

338
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,630
of this unpretentious hotel room,

339
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,828
it's my intention to show you

340
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,736
just how exciting
a mysterious stranger can be.

341
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,468
I suppose we'll have to describe him.

342
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,926
Yes, I suppose so.

343
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,630
He's American, of course.

344
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,942
I can write him better that way.

345
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,748
Now let's see, what else?

346
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,430
I see him as rather tall,
rather suntanned,

347
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,470
rather handsome, athletic looking,

348
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,953
with a rugged but...
curiously sensitive face.

349
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,630
<i>Poor sad creature.
Little does she realise</i>

350
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,342
<i>that in a moment
she and the audience</i>

351
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,110
<i>will have totally forgotten
that dull clod Maurice,</i>

352
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,680
<i>or Philippe
or whatever his name is.</i>

353
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,550
<i>At this magic moment
her life has indeed begun.</i>

354
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,270
<i>Tenderly he folds her into his arms</i>

355
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,950
<i>and moving with the nimble grace
of a Fred Astaire</i>

356
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,462
<i>he dances her off into the crowd.</i>

357
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,350
In exactly ten seconds I want you
to slap me as hard as you can.

358
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,234
What?

359
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,710
There is unfortunately
no time to explain.

360
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,150
And no reason to trust me.
But I trust you.

361
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:43,550
There's something about
your big magic eyes and I am...

362
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,670
Well, the name doesn't matter.

363
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:52,750
Just think of me as...
1331, American Intelligence.

364
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,406
This must be some kind of a joke.

365
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,990
If you will look
slightly to your left...

366
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,470
Without moving your head, please.

367
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,782
You will see in that window...

368
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,462
In the bouquet I handed you
is a piece of microfilm.

369
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,030
I can't tell you what it is, but
should it fall into the wrong hands

370
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,885
it may mean the end of civilisation
as we know it.

371
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,034
The time has come for you
to slap me as hard as you can.

372
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,857
<i>Stop. Stop!</i>

373
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,268
"Spies in trench"-"coats?"

374
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,211
<i>I'm afraid I got carried away.
We'll have to go back.</i>

375
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:59,470
<i>OK. That brings us back
to where we were.</i>

376
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,590
<i>We're alright through getting rid
of her date for Bastille Day.</i>

377
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,760
<i>The boy and the girl meet and...</i>

378
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:11,765
<i>..and they dance, and they dance,
and they dance...</i>

379
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,182
And they dance, and they dance...

380
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,910
Mr... Benson?

381
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,230
Now then. The mysterious stranger.
Who is he...?

382
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,428
There's someone at the door.

383
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,870
What does he do?
What suffering, what torment

384
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,670
caused the sadness
that lurks behind his eyes?

385
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,468
And why,
while we're asking questions,

386
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,310
didn't I listen to my father
and learn a useful trade?

387
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,423
Merci.

388
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,160
It's a telegram.

389
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,750
Well, aren't you going to open it?

390
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,590
No, I'm not going to open it.
The reason I won't open it

391
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,902
is I'm fully aware what it says.

392
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:05,790
The reason for that is because
in the last 19 and a fraction weeks

393
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:10,110
I have received 134 telegrams
from Mr Alexander Meyerheim,

394
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:15,070
all saying exactly the same thing.
When will the script be finished?

395
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,550
When will the script be finished?

396
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,590
How can I write
with him badgering me this way?

397
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,630
Day and night, wires, messages,
telephone calls.

398
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,030
How was it today? Did you work well?
When will it be finished?

399
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,230
Talk about men in trench-coats!
He spies on me constantly.

400
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,670
His people are everywhere.
For all I know, you might be one.

401
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,040
Mr Benson!

402
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,430
<i>I'm sorry. Some days I just feel like
whatshisname in Les Miserables.</i>

403
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:43,230
- Jean Valjean.
- I guess so.

404
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,830
Only last night... Last night
I swore to him on the telephone

405
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,710
that I had 138 pages in front of me.

406
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,510
I said, "Alex,
any man who takes your money

407
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,990
and tells you he's got 138 pages
in front of him and doesn't

408
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,988
is nothing but a liar and a thief!"

409
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,977
Sometimes I get the feeling
he doesn't trust me.

410
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,750
I know
who the mysterious stranger is.

411
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,710
He's a liar and a thief.

412
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,852
Sure. A latterday Francois Villon,

413
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,840
who lives by his wits
and what he steals.

414
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,840
A jewel thief, maybe.

415
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,462
Expert safe-cracker.

416
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,623
There isn't a safe in the world

417
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:44,593
he can't open with his bare hands.
I've got it!

418
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,457
We have to start all over again

419
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,080
but that's not too serious.
We've only got eight pages.

420
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,990
Let's see. We're alright through
Alexander Meyerheim production,

421
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,750
<i>Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower,
story and screenplay, Richard Benson.</i>

422
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:02,590
We keep the Bastille Day jazz, only
this time we don't start on Gabby,

423
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,902
we start on... Rick.

424
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,576
Rick. That's a wonderful name
for the mysterious stranger.

425
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,270
Don't editorialise.
Just start typing.

426
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,510
Exterior, day. A picturesque square.

427
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,080
Amidst the throng of merrymakers,

428
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:24,376
the camera picks up a rather tall,
rather suntanned American...

429
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,230
<i>We'd better change his wardrobe
for a liar and a thief suit.</i>

430
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,710
<i>You know, various shades of black.</i>

431
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,150
<i>Moving with the grace of a jungle
cat, Rick approaches the table</i>

432
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:38,670
<i>where Gabby is getting
"the brush"-"off from her actor."</i>

433
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,990
<i>"His almost super"-"human intelligence"
takes in the situation at once.</i>

434
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:47,150
<i>He hesitates. If there's
a single chink in Rick's armour,</i>

435
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,292
<i>it's a pretty face.</i>

436
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:53,150
<i>He comes to a decision
and moves to another table</i>

437
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,950
<i>where two denizens
of the underworld await him.</i>

438
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,262
<i>Call them first gangster
and second gangster.</i>

439
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,897
Well, Rick?

440
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,790
- Have you thought it over?
- I'm considering the proposition.

441
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:11,390
It is a plan of simplicity and beauty
yet highly original, very daring.

442
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,910
- "Voil, monsieur."
- "We need you for two things only."

443
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,710
To open the safe
and deliver the note.

444
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,594
A few hours' work.

445
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,542
And for this, a million dollars.

446
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,470
Which we will of course split
three ways.

447
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,790
Half for me. The other half
to be divided between you two.

448
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,246
But you already agreed.

449
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,852
Gentlemen, it's a well-known fact

450
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,022
that I am not only a brilliant
safe-cracker, but a liar and a thief.

451
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:46,330
Half for me, the other half
divided between you two.

452
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,948
Very well. I will pick you up
with a car at four.

453
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,840
Until four, then.

454
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,590
And, Rick, resist at all costs

455
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:03,390
your continuous and ove"rw"helming
impulse to perform the double-cross.

456
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:08,110
We will not this time be so...
understanding

457
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,365
as we were last year in Tangier.

458
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,950
<i>Now, Miss Simpson, having
established a climate of suspense,</i>

459
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,576
<i>intrigue and romance, we've arrived
once more at that magic moment.</i>

460
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,868
<i>The boy and the girl meet.</i>

461
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,870
<i>OK. Now we need more conflict.</i>

462
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,182
<i>A new character, maybe.</i>

463
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,790
<i>I've got it! Seated nearby
is Rick's deadly enemy,</i>

464
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:56,074
<i>Inspector, erm, Gillette
of the international police force.</i>

465
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:03,370
<i>It is apparent he knows something
the audience does not know.</i>

466
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,750
And now, Miss Simpson, we have set
the wheels of our plot in motion

467
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,870
and inflamed the audience
with a passionate desire

468
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,012
to find out what happens next.

469
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,550
And I don't blame them.
I'm dying to find out myself.

470
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,590
We can pause
for a few pages of chitchat,

471
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:23,870
getting-to-know-you stuff,
which I do so brilliantly.

472
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:29,524
The question is, where should
this charming little scene be played?

473
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,143
At lunch!

474
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,910
Yes, he takes her to a beautiful
restaurant for lunch in the Bois.

475
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:45,310
Ridiculous. She wouldn't go off with
a man who picked her up in a square.

476
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,950
I mean, he's a perfect... stranger.

477
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,430
Miss Simpson, nobody's perfect.

478
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,950
Why, he asks, as they dance
and dance and dance,

479
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,670
are you so sad
when everyone is so gay?

480
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,150
And then a suggestion
from the mysterious stranger.

481
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,292
If you try raising your upper lip,

482
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,480
you might at least create
the illusion of a smile.

483
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:10,230
That being somewhat of a disaster,
he really has to turn on the charm.

484
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,990
Do you know the word serendipity,
he asks. She shakes her head.

485
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:17,310
- What does it mean?
- Why, Miss Simpson, I'm surprised.

486
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,870
It means opening your eyes
each morning

487
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,150
and looking at the bright new day
and going absolutely ape!

488
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,790
- Serendipity?
- Right.

489
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,150
- Are you making it up?
- No, serendipity's a real word.

490
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,190
Actually, it means the ability
to find pleasure, excitement

491
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,502
and happiness
in anything that occurs.

492
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,352
No matter how unexpected.

493
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,972
Serendipity!

494
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,750
He explains the word, in a much more
fascinating way than I did,

495
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,592
and at the right moment proposes

496
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:46,750
a glorious lunch in the Bois.
She's tempted.

497
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,206
But don't you think...

498
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,870
Miss Simpson, he's not asking her
for a weekend at a motel

499
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:55,230
in Asbury Park, New Jersey.
He's inviting her to lunch!

500
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,150
Now don't you think if he were
terribly terribly charming, she'd go?

501
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,306
- Well...
- Serendipity.

502
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,270
Alright, maybe. If he promises it's
just lunch and that's absolutely all.

503
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:08,110
He promises. Unless she can think of
something she'd like to do after.

504
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:11,510
- Which she won't!
- Seren... Alright, then.

505
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,270
He hails a horse and carriage and
they go off to the Bois. Settled?

506
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,870
Settled. And now I suppose
we ought to write it.

507
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,954
Not at all.
The audience is ahead of us.

508
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,474
They've known she'll have lunch
with him for an hour.

509
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,922
But how do we get from the square

510
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,688
through the charm and serendipity
you do so brilliantly?

511
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,848
In motion pictures
we have a simple device

512
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:36,190
which takes care of
exactly this situation. The dissolve.

513
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,510
Over the years,
the audience has been conditioned

514
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,430
to understand
that when a scene fades away,

515
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:45,150
like an old soldier,
before their very eyes,

516
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,430
and another scene gradually appears
to take its place,

517
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:51,950
a certain amount of time has elapsed.
So, Miss Simpson,

518
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,150
we dissolve...

519
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:59,310
We dissolve slowly
and lingeringly...

520
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,766
..to the Bois.

521
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,670
<i>A hansom cab
bearing our handsome couple</i>

522
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,630
<i>"clippety"-"clops its way"
past waterfalls and trees</i>

523
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,514
<i>toward a magnificent restaurant.</i>

524
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,777
<i>Notice, Miss Simpson,
how cleverly I play</i>

525
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,830
<i>"our suspense"-"filled melodrama"
against a background</i>

526
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,700
<i>of holiday serendipity
in "gay Paris".</i>

527
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,670
<i>We will spare the audience
the pages of dreary small talk</i>

528
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,068
<i>and get to the heart of the matter,</i>

529
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:42,350
<i>by the simple use of the device
I've just explained, the dissolve.</i>

530
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,977
Who are you? What do you do?

531
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,510
Who am I and what do I do?
I'm nobody

532
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,990
and I've done everything
and nothing.

533
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,990
Driven racing cars,
white hunter for a while,

534
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:57,630
piano player in a rather curious
establishment in Buenos Aires.

535
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,414
This and that,
everything and nothing.

536
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,910
The curse
of having been born too rich.

537
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,510
Oh, I know what you mean. The curse
of having been born too rich.

538
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,208
That's why I left the castle
for Paris.

539
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,214
The castle?

540
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:14,510
We've got houses all over the world,
but my favourite

541
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:18,670
was our summer place in Deauville
with its own private zoo.

542
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:24,667
As a little girl, on Sundays, if I'd
been good, I could feed the giraffes.

543
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,390
Giraffes? Don't tell me
that you had giraffes, too?

544
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,230
- You mean, you...?
- But of course.

545
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:36,750
Oh, what fun! Both of us
having had giraffes as children.

546
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,320
It's a small world, isn't it?

547
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,685
<i>Voil! Madame. Monsieur.</i>

548
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,750
- To Rick.
- To Gabby.

549
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,334
If I may recommend...?

550
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,274
I prefer to do it myself.

551
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:57,750
To begin, we'll have paper-thin
slices of prosciutto ham

552
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:02,162
wrapped carefully around well-ripened
sections of Persian melon.

553
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,217
To follow, a touch of Dover sole

554
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,350
sauted lightly
in champagne and butter.

555
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,350
With that, a bottle of...

556
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,720
Pouilly-Fuiss?

557
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,791
'59 will do. And after that...

558
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,670
..we'll have a Chateaubriand for two.

559
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,550
Erm, make that for four.
Charred and brown.

560
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:26,230
Nay, black on the outside
and gloriously rare on the in.

561
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,550
With the beef
we'll have white asparagus

562
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,805
and a bottle of
Chateau Lafite-Rothschild '47.

563
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,750
And for dessert an enormous order
of fraise du bois...

564
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,310
Served, of course,
with globs of heavy cream

565
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:43,679
<i>so thick you can put it on with
a shovel, s'il vous plat. Mwah!</i>

566
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,750
You heard the lady.
And make it snappy, we're starving.

567
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,990
Now, while awaiting
the paper-thin slices of prosciutto,

568
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,746
so skilfully wrapped around

569
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,510
perfect sections
of ripened Persian melon...

570
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,251
Please, stop, I can't stand it.

571
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:05,070
Do you think they'll really do
the sole in champagne and butter?

572
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,382
Mm-hmm. In any case,
while we're waiting,

573
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,870
I wonder if the lovely
Miss Gabrielle Simpson

574
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,990
would join the very talented
Mr Richard Benson

575
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:17,470
for a small dry aperitif? I think
she's earned it. They both have.

576
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,990
Alright, I think
that would be very nice.

577
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,790
I didn't really like Rick at first

578
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,531
but he's beginning to grow on me.

579
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,092
Mmmm...

580
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,110
So, you find Rick growing on you?

581
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,508
Oh, yes,
I think he's very attractive.

582
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,870
Important. The reaction
of the female audience.

583
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,750
Alright. Lunch is over. The martinis,

584
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,990
the two different wines and brandy
have had their effect

585
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:51,630
and a glorious dream-like glow
is settling over them.

586
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,428
The pages, Miss Simpson.

587
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:57,754
Those that we have covered so far
with our fabulous prose.

588
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,870
Here you will notice, as advertised
in our discussion earlier on today,

589
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,230
the opening, a series of
interestingly photographed

590
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,772
establishing shots.

591
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,750
And here, the boy and the girl,

592
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,710
if a middle-aged mysterious stranger
can indeed be called a boy, meet.

593
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,750
You're not middle-aged, Mr Benson.

594
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,390
In fact, I think you're remarkably
well preserved.

595
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:33,230
As chilling a compliment as
I've ever received, Miss Simpson.

596
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:37,510
However, to continue,
pages eight, nine,

597
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,908
ten of romantic chitchat.

598
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,910
- Which you do so brilliantly.
- Why, thank you.

599
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:47,310
Now, you can feel the unconscious
attraction between the two,

600
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,651
the tremulous beginnings of love.

601
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,760
You see how easy it is
with professional know-how

602
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,571
and experience on your side?

603
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:03,150
Miss Simpson,
I don't think you realise this,

604
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:07,091
but a writer's life
is a terribly lonely one.

605
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:11,630
- Mr Benson.
- Hmm?

606
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,885
Have you any idea at all
what happens next?

607
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:21,070
Do you, Miss Simpson,
have any idea what will happen?

608
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,354
Well...

609
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,750
We've got to remember
that no matter how charming he seems

610
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:33,819
he is a liar and a thief.
It says so right here.

611
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,046
Mr Benson...

612
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,508
I do know what happens next.

613
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,350
What happens next
is the second switch.

614
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:54,110
The audience gasps as they realise
they have been fooled.

615
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,710
He has plied her with martinis,
white wine, red wine, brandy,

616
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:01,994
for only one reason.
To make her drunk!

617
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:07,630
Which incidentally she is not.
Not at all, whatever he thinks.

618
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:11,310
Now, as he forces one last brandy

619
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:13,366
to her unwilling lips...

620
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,830
<i>Poor ingenuous girl. Charmed
and serendipitied into believing</i>

621
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,942
<i>she was safe in the hands of
this suntanned handsome American.</i>

622
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,190
<i>Alas, things are not
what they seem. Not at all.</i>

623
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,674
<i>The music turns ominous.</i>

624
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:45,734
<i>And she becomes aware
of the danger that she is in.</i>

625
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:51,510
<i>The mysterious stranger. Who is he?
What is he really like?</i>

626
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,808
<i>And why does he keep
nibbling on her neck?</i>

627
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,770
Don't be frightened, my dear.
It's only a bat.

628
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:11,202
The creatures of the night
are my friends.

629
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:25,108
I know why you nibble on my neck.
You're some kind of werewolf.

630
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:29,230
No, no, my dear.

631
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,542
I'm a vampire.

632
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,120
The inner reaches of these caverns

633
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,091
make an ideal setting
for my laboratory.

634
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:25,470
<i>And yet,
there's something about his eyes.</i>

635
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:27,950
<i>Even though they are
rather bloodshot.</i>

636
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:32,910
<i>A vampire's life must be
a terribly Ionely one. But no!</i>

637
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,080
<i>Not for nothing has she made
a comprehensive study of depravity.</i>

638
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,830
<i>Some girls may let vampires
nibble their necks on the first date,</i>

639
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,590
<i>but not our Gabby. She tears free
from his evil grasp</i>

640
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,817
<i>and the chase is on!</i>

641
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,582
- "Vous tes Peau"-"Rouge?"
- "Oui."

642
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,172
<i>Moi aussi.</i>

643
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:12,750
<i>He's caught her, he's caught her.
No, Gabby, you can't give in now.</i>

644
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,470
<i>You fought him in the cave,
on the beaches,</i>

645
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:19,239
<i>you fought him on the plains.
"That's it" - "planes!"</i>

646
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,150
Her face registers terror.

647
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:56,919
Mr Benson, Mr Benson,
she's killed him!

648
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:03,950
There, there, Miss Simpson,
it's perfectly alright.

649
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,830
In your defence, it's been a hard day

650
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:09,228
and you've had a good deal to drink.

651
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,542
Anyway, he had it coming to him.

652
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,630
Plying her with all that booze,
making her drunk.

653
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:19,142
Which incidentally she is not.
Not in the least.

654
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:22,510
- Of course not.
- Not only did she kill him,

655
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,870
but when I think of
that poor horse...

656
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,696
The way she beat him
with that terrible whip.

657
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:32,394
Anyway, I think
she had it coming to her.

658
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,194
That was what?

659
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:39,390
Whatever he planned to do to her. Why
did she make such a fuss, anyway?

660
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:42,474
It's not as if he was
some kind of vampire or something.

661
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:46,291
Actually, I think
he's very attractive.

662
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:55,230
Miss Simpson, I think you should
go to bed and get some sleep.

663
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:58,190
You do? What about you?

664
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:00,160
I wish to think. Now, Miss Simpson,

665
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:03,470
if you'll please go in there
and lie down.

666
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:07,230
Maybe for a few hours.
But if you do get an idea,

667
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,910
and I know you will,
you must promise to wake me.

668
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,023
Sure.

669
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:13,822
Promise?

670
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:18,537
I promise.

671
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,686
Alright, then.

672
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,422
Good night, Mr Benson.

673
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,354
Good night, Miss Simpson.

674
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,154
Good night.

675
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,074
Good night.

676
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:03,870
Operator, I'd like to place a call

677
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:06,954
to Mr Alexander Meyerheim in Cannes.

678
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:12,759
It's one-thirty. You can probably
find him at the casino.

679
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:20,670
Erm... Ah, Benson.
Mr Richard Benson calling.

680
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,640
Person to person.

681
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,382
I'll hold on.

682
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:34,960
Dear Alex.

683
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:42,578
Dear Alex, ...

684
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,030
..it is my unpleasant duty
to inform you

685
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:49,870
<i>that The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel
Tower will not take place.</i>

686
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,497
You see, my friend,

687
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:56,110
that there's no point for you
to come to Paris on Sunday

688
00:49:56,110 --> 00:50:00,051
to read the script,
because there is no script.

689
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,634
As I see it, there will be no...

690
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,811
<i>Yeah? Comment?</i>

691
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:15,171
Try him at the chemin de fer game.
The big table.

692
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:47,600
Excuse me,
I forgot to cover Richelieu.

693
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,560
Good night.

694
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:06,350
Oh, Mr Benson. Please don't think
I'm quitting on you.

695
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:10,291
I'll be right here when you need me.
Good night.

696
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,320
Operator.

697
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,652
Cancel that call.

698
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,777
Unfortunately, Miss Simpson, ...

699
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:53,726
..we are not writing a musical.

700
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:04,590
Mr Benson, you did all these pages
last night? All by yourself?

701
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:07,630
While some of us
were snug in our bed,

702
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,686
other more productive citizens
were up

703
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:12,350
toiling in the vineyards
of beautiful letters.

704
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:15,470
I'm only sorry that you
as a fledgling writer

705
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,990
weren't present to observe
with your own big magic eyes

706
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:21,388
a seasoned professional in action.

707
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:23,617
I was, in those few short hours,

708
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:27,790
the great DiMaggio going back,
back, back for the high-fly ball.

709
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:32,270
I was Manolete in Seville,
going over the horns for the kill.

710
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:36,270
And missing, fortunately, because
I can't stand the sight of blood.

711
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,268
I was Pablo Picasso, deftly...

712
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:44,970
..adding the third eye
to a portrait of his lady love.

713
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,852
I was...

714
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:50,600
How do you spell ingenuous?

715
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,154
l-N-G-E-N-U-O-U-S.

716
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:55,457
I was afraid of that.

717
00:55:55,470 --> 00:56:00,030
In addition to the nine and a half
yards of pages I wrote,

718
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:03,070
I discovered some errors
in the earlier pages,

719
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:07,268
which I corrected, dealing basically
with the character of Rick.

720
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:11,045
I found I had,
in a moment of insecurity, ...

721
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:14,406
..underestimated
the brilliance of the man.

722
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:17,870
No simple safe-cracker he
but a master criminal,

723
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:20,750
wanted by the police
of three continents.

724
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,148
The dazzling scheme
has been worked out,

725
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:27,310
step by painful step,
for over a year by Rick himself.

726
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,870
The two other characters
are just employees.

727
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:32,590
That brings us back
to where we were.

728
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,790
Rick and Gabby have demolished
a glorious lunch

729
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:38,350
and it's almost four o'clock,
time for the car to arrive.

730
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:40,234
Page 14.

731
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,114
Sit down and brace yourself.

732
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:46,668
Here comes the switch on the switch.

733
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:50,190
In a minute and a half
you and the audience will gasp

734
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:52,246
as you realise you've been fooled.

735
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:55,011
Things are not as they seem.
Not at all. In fact,

736
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:00,350
- the whole situation is reversed.
- Mr Benson...

737
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,830
Miss Simpson, please don't sit there

738
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:05,470
gazing at me in mute adoration.

739
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,440
Read the script.

740
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:11,630
Rick and Gabby are sitting with
brandy glasses before them.

741
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:14,028
Her big magic eyes are shiny...

742
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:18,350
I can't imagine
a more marvellous lunch.

743
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:20,320
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Please.

744
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:26,430
And now I'll tell you the plans
for the rest of the afternoon.

745
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:27,714
The rest of the afternoon?

746
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:31,790
Exactly. My car and chauffeur
will pick us up here at four,

747
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:35,150
for a tour of Paris to see how
the celebration's progressing,

748
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:38,590
a brief stop at my office
to pick something up,

749
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,070
and then on to a party in my honour

750
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,640
at the restaurant
in the Eiffel Tower.

751
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:49,217
- Pardon, you are Monsieur Rick?
- Oui.

752
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:54,110
Your chauffeur is here, sir.
He has an important message for you.

753
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,223
Merci.

754
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:58,566
Pardon me for a moment.

755
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,062
It's almost four o'clock.

756
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,994
I know, I know.

757
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:14,990
What's the matter? Are you mad?
Bringing a girl on a job like this!

758
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:19,630
Our arrangement, Francois. You do
the driving and I do the planning.

759
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:24,085
But... but the plan does not
call for the presence of a girl.

760
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:28,830
The ability to improvise brilliantly
in a moment of crisis

761
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:33,230
is one of the reasons
I am a highly paid successful thief.

762
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:37,150
If you will look to the left,
just behind you,

763
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:39,720
as casually as possible,

764
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:43,950
you will see, stupidly trying to
hide behind yesterday's newspaper,

765
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:46,606
our old friend Inspector Gillette.

766
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,297
What is he doing in Paris?

767
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,790
Do you think he...
suspects something?

768
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:59,150
Of course not.
If so, I'm one step ahead.

769
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:00,777
Why do you think
I picked up the girl?

770
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,310
Because she has big magic eyes.

771
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:05,280
That, too,
but actually I picked her up

772
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:08,670
to throw our inspector friend
off the scent.

773
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,150
Never in his wildest imagination
would he think

774
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,548
that the highly paid
and successful Rick

775
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:17,150
would be so foolish
as to take a girl along on a job.

776
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:21,519
Therefore, that's exactly what I'm
going to do. She's a perfect cover.

777
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:25,566
Meet you at the car in one minute.

778
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,292
Shall we?

779
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:48,830
My dear Gillette,
our paths cross again.

780
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:52,430
My dear Rick,
what an extraordinary coincidence.

781
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:56,750
Monsieur Gillette is in a curious
way a business associate of mine.

782
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:59,470
Enchanted. Any friend of Rick's
is a friend of mine.

783
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:04,610
Please, enjoy your lunch. And I beg
of you, watch the calories.

784
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:25,132
This, my friend,
is a moment to savour.

785
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:28,234
For three years I've waited
and at last my brilliant,

786
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:32,190
highly paid professional friend
has risen to the bait.

787
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:36,350
What he doesn't know, poor Rick,
is that the girl is ours.

788
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:39,348
You're sure he suspected nothing?

789
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:44,110
Inspector, my imitation
of a method actor was impeccable.

790
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,080
I played the role internally,
of course,

791
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:49,870
indicating all the basic elements
of this curious calling.

792
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:53,870
The deep almost lunatic narcissism.

793
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:56,182
The lack of personal daintiness.

794
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,160
The appalling grammar.

795
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:01,360
Pops, it was...
Sir, it was flawless, brilliant.

796
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:03,617
I came in on a motorbike
in wheat-coloured...

797
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,190
Now, please, don't get carried away.

798
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:09,150
I remind you,
you are not the star of this drama

799
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:13,230
but merely a supporting player.
A very minor one, at that.

800
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:16,110
If life, like the theatre,
came equipped with programmes,

801
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:20,350
your billing, way down on the page
and in tiny letters,

802
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:22,834
would simply be second policeman.

803
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:27,470
As I was saying,
what he doesn't know, poor Rick,

804
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:29,526
is that the girl is ours.

805
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:34,110
Can we trust
a creature of the streets,

806
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:35,994
with a police record
as long as your arm?

807
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:38,670
Nothing will go wrong,
my dear Philippe.

808
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:42,030
There's a tiny chink
in Rick's armour. A pretty face.

809
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:44,910
One way or another,
using such talent as she has,

810
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:48,336
the girl will extract from him
the details of the plan.

811
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:54,190
The plan. But should they not
be followed? I have the car.

812
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:56,588
There would be no point.
Rick is a master.

813
01:01:56,590 --> 01:02:00,350
No policeman alive can stay on
his trail if he wishes to elude him.

814
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:01,463
- Yes...
- No.

815
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,006
No.

816
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:07,470
I shall have a glorious lunch,
everything to be cooked, of course,

817
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:10,830
in this remarkable
non-fattening sunflower oil,

818
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,800
and eventually
having followed my luncheon

819
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:15,142
with several digestifs
and a short walk,

820
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:20,376
rejoin my friend tonight for
the climax of his adventures at...

821
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:26,565
The Eiffel Tower?
Brilliant, Inspector. Brilliant.

822
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,994
To the studio, Francois, please.

823
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:37,657
Studio?

824
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:42,765
I said, I have to stop at my office
and pick something up there.

825
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:45,388
Have you been inside
a motion-picture studio?

826
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,446
No. Are you in the movie business?

827
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:50,148
In a way.

828
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:54,190
The studio is particularly marvellous
on a holiday like this.

829
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:56,670
Silent. Empty.

830
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:59,496
The vast sound stages
completely deserted.

831
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:05,096
Like the night before Christmas,
not a creature is stirring.

832
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:32,000
Wait here, I won't be long.

833
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:41,206
Hmm, nice-ish.

834
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,372
Isn't it?

835
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:45,868
I don't understand. Are you an actor,

836
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:48,510
a writer, producer, director?

837
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:50,222
Nothing so creative, I'm afraid.

838
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:53,182
My interest in movies
is purely financial.

839
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,754
Gracious.

840
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:59,206
I can't tell you
how exciting this is...

841
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:02,110
This is for me. I just love movies.

842
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:05,390
Not those terrible New Wave pictures,
where nothing happens.

843
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:07,017
But I like, ...

844
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:10,190
..erm, Westerns.

845
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:12,588
Good old-fashioned pictures
with switches

846
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:18,073
and switches on switches.
Things like that.

847
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:27,550
Do you have an emery board on you?
One of those things

848
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:30,120
- to file the nails?
- I think so.

849
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:32,788
Thank you.

850
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:37,630
I particularly like movies with
complicated robberies in, don't you?

851
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:39,342
Absolutely.

852
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:44,990
I know this sounds childish
but next to pictures about robberies

853
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:48,830
I think I like horror pictures best.
I always have.

854
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:52,428
As a little girl
I was madly in love with Dracula.

855
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,142
My mother was very upset.

856
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,910
She thought it was somehow...
unhealthy.

857
01:04:56,910 --> 01:05:01,230
She used to say, that vampire's
old enough to be your father!

858
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,714
Whom, she would add,
he in many ways resembles.

859
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:06,652
I'm glad.

860
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:08,982
Not that your father
resembled Dracula.

861
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:12,502
Which he didn't.
Not after he had his teeth fixed.

862
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:16,510
But that you are interested
in pictures.

863
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:19,230
That makes two things
we have in common.

864
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:22,228
Movies... and giraffes.

865
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,656
Here are the keys. Meet you
at the gate in half an hour.

866
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:52,696
Giraffes and movies...
It's a small world, isn't it?

867
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:55,326
Let me see that!

868
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,870
No, no. Please, Rick,
you're hurting me.

869
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,440
The lipstick. It's been written with.

870
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:05,679
The napkin! The napkin
you gave Gillette. What was on it?

871
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:10,006
What was on it?

872
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:14,628
You...

873
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,251
Stop, Rick, stop.
Or I'll shoot, I swear I will.

874
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,462
Mr Benson, what happens next?

875
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:14,028
I don't know. I don't know.

876
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:15,538
That's as far as I got.

877
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:18,526
- Mr Benson.
- Yes?

878
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:22,430
You know what I think?
I think we need another...

879
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:25,110
What would that be?
A switch on a switch

880
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:28,190
on a switch on a switch. On a switch.

881
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:32,910
I thought I knew movies but Roger
Roussin was never like this.

882
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:36,590
I wonder if he knows about switches.
And switches on switches.

883
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:39,790
And switches on switches
on switches. I don't think so.

884
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:41,846
It would change his whole life.

885
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:46,453
Not only would they not play Scrabble
they would also not play Parcheesi.

886
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:51,074
I must say, the mind reels.

887
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:54,257
Anyway, you know what I think?

888
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:59,150
Yes. You think she is not a creature
of the streets with a police record.

889
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:01,806
You think she's an American
intelligence agent.

890
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:03,840
Well, Miss Simpson,

891
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:05,926
you happen to be wrong.

892
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:09,870
Our Gabby happens to be
that most reliable, steadfast,

893
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:14,110
and you-cannot-miss-with-no-matter-
how-badly-you-write-it character

894
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:16,630
in all popular literature.

895
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:19,500
The prostitute with a heart of gold.

896
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:21,958
No, actually,

897
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:27,310
the P with the H of G is secondmost.
The most is Frankenstein.

898
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:30,750
Sure, someone who creates
or remakes another human being

899
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:35,310
and either falls in love with it
or it destroys him.

900
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,022
It can go either way.

901
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:39,982
That's what gives it
such flexibility.

902
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:44,750
Miss Simpson, did you ever realise

903
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:49,119
<i>that Frankenstein and
My Fair Lady are the same story?</i>

904
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:52,560
One ends happily

905
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:54,988
and the other one doesn't.

906
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,474
Think about that for a while.

907
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:02,630
You smell wonderful.

908
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:08,242
That's the bath oil. When I took
my bath earlier I put bath oil in.

909
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:11,950
Only a few drops, of course.

910
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:15,891
For which I am most grateful.
For both our sakes.

911
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:19,217
Ahem. And now, erm, where were we?

912
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:22,630
Bang, bang, bang!
That's where we were.

913
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:24,772
Or rather, where you were.

914
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:27,670
She was by the bed with a gun,
he was moving toward her.

915
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:31,054
<i>I don't see how Frankenstein
and My Fair Lady are the same.</i>

916
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:34,150
Oh, yes, I do.

917
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:37,790
Professor Higgins created Eliza and
Dr Frankenstein created the monster.

918
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:39,760
Oh, yes, of course.

919
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,630
But don't tell anybody.
I'm saving it for the textbook

920
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:47,071
on the art of screenplay writing.

921
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:51,110
Ah-ha, yeah, well...

922
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:54,830
He's chased her through the jungle,
all that. Blah, blah, blah.

923
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:58,350
Passed the bathtub.
If you want a Richard Benson movie

924
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:03,310
without a bathtub you're out of
your head. And into the bedroom.

925
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:07,379
She pulls out a gun,
blah, blah, blah, blah, and...

926
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:11,531
My dear big magic-eyed

927
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:14,510
bath-oil scented Miss Simpson,

928
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:16,652
is where we are.

929
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:19,714
Slowly,

930
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,977
Rick continues toward her.

931
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:28,326
Go ahead. Pull the trigger.

932
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,791
Don't reach for your gun,
I'm warning you.

933
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:41,536
- Cigarette?
- Thanks. Light?

934
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:52,557
Well, Rick, ...

935
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:58,016
..d'you mind
if I get out of these wet shoes?

936
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:02,800
And so my big magic-eyed Gabby,

937
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:08,211
who came to Paris to... live, ...

938
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:16,679
..turns out to be a spy
for the police. An informer.

939
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:18,608
A common stool pigeon.

940
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:21,630
No, Rick, don't say it!
It's that devil Gillette.

941
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:24,990
Oh, how I hate him. He is relentless!

942
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:28,350
He'll stop at nothing
until he tracks you down.

943
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:31,305
He'll never forgive himself
for last year in Tangier

944
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:35,230
or the year before in Hong Kong.
You are his obsession.

945
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:38,190
He is a mad ove"rw"eight Captain Ahab,

946
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:42,110
searching down you, his Moby Dick.
His white whale.

947
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:44,990
- And you?
- Me?

948
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:49,870
I'm nothing. A creature of the
streets with a long police record.

949
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:52,990
He had me paroled to be
the luscious and irresistible bait

950
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:55,950
squirming on the hook
he has prepared.

951
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:58,830
If I do not extract
the plan you have been building

952
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:02,270
step by painful step
for the last year,

953
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:04,990
my life, well, it's over.

954
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:08,270
Back I go behind the bars,
matron in uniform once more,

955
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:12,510
no longer Gabrielle or Gabby
but simply... a number.

956
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:14,394
lf, however, I succeed...

957
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:15,972
And if you succeed?

958
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:17,782
Freedom!

959
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:22,100
What exactly do you have to do
to extract this plan?

960
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:25,670
Anything.

961
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:28,510
- Anything?
- Anything. It's not so hard.

962
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:32,150
I too in my own way
am a highly paid professional.

963
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:37,150
Not so highly paid as you, perhaps,
but still... a professional.

964
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:39,292
We're two of a kind, you and I.

965
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:43,165
There's no reason for us
to be enemies. We can perhaps be...

966
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:46,300
..friends.

967
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:47,977
Perhaps...

968
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:56,510
<i>Their two bodies now moving as one</i>

969
01:13:56,510 --> 01:14:01,110
<i>roll like turbulent breakers
crashing on an undiscovered shore.</i>

970
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:03,766
<i>And now, now,...</i>

971
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:06,388
<i>..we slowly...</i>

972
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:08,828
<i>..and lingeringly...</i>

973
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:10,628
<i>..dissolve...</i>

974
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:13,886
Gracious.

975
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:17,950
Exactly, Miss Simpson. Well said.

976
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:21,120
You might even add heavens to Betsy.

977
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,720
What's wrong, don't you like it?

978
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:29,110
Oh, I like it,
but can you get away with it?

979
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:32,151
Get away with it? Get away with what?

980
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:37,870
Well, that scene with them
on the bed is rather suggestive.

981
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:40,150
Don't you think
the censors will object?

982
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:41,992
How can they possibly object?

983
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:43,742
We dissolved, didn't we?

984
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:47,470
- Yes, but...
- Miss Simpson, as I said before,

985
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:50,340
a dissolve is a most useful device.

986
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:53,091
Not only can it take you
from one place to another,

987
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:56,430
but it also leaves
what's happening on the screen

988
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,142
to your imagination.

989
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:01,942
Now if I were you, Miss Simpson,

990
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:05,670
I would stop going to
those sinful art theatres,

991
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:10,382
and start seeing more good wholesome
American family-type pictures.

992
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:15,310
I don't know what you and the censors
think they're doing on that bed,

993
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:20,964
but I take the position
that they're playing... Parcheesi.

994
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:40,428
As much as I've enjoyed our little
game, it's almost eight-thirty.

995
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:45,550
Time for the climax of
our glorious day. We must be off.

996
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:47,348
Off? Where to?

997
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:49,446
You know perfectly well where.

998
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:53,062
The costume party at
the Eiffel Tower to finish the job.

999
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:56,990
You mustn't. You can't go through
with the plan, whatever it is.

1000
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:59,950
Gillette will be there and the place
will be surrounded by police.

1001
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:01,577
Gillette was in Tangier last year.

1002
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:06,382
The entire city was surrounded by
police. Now if you'll excuse me...

1003
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:07,778
Where are you going?

1004
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:13,662
To the wardrobe department,
to find something for us to wear.

1005
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:44,026
Quite alright. I always carry

1006
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:49,510
a packet of bubble bath in my purse
and I'm getting on swimmingly.

1007
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:54,952
Howdy, ...

1008
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:57,797
..stranger.

1009
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:03,286
You must be the new schoolma'am.

1010
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:13,550
I hate to rush you, ma'am,
but it's getting late.

1011
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:16,590
How long will it take
to get out of that tub,

1012
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:19,790
into this costume
and out to the car?

1013
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:24,588
Absolutely no time at all...

1014
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:35,434
And now according to my master plan

1015
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:39,230
the time has come to take
the most dangerous step of all.

1016
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:40,686
Yes, Rick?

1017
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:44,270
I must trust you
and tell you the details.

1018
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:46,668
I can trust you, can't l, Gabby?

1019
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:50,430
How can you ask, Rick? After our
Parcheesi game this afternoon,

1020
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:53,670
I am yours for ever
and ever and ever.

1021
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,940
Can I trust you, Gabby?

1022
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:58,606
Can I really trust you?

1023
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:13,110
In the back of this car are
28 cans of motion-picture film.

1024
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:16,150
The Eiffel Tower party is being
given by the picture's producer.

1025
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:22,430
Tell me the plan in a minute, Rick.
It's a long drive to the Eiffel Tower

1026
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:25,428
and the traffic is heavy.

1027
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:01,737
Mr Benson...

1028
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:04,258
Rick.

1029
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:09,071
Gabby, maybe, but I'm not...

1030
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:13,108
Well, I'm not that kind of a girl.

1031
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:23,213
Oh, I can't stand girls
who say things like that.

1032
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:28,254
Oh, dear...

1033
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:32,914
I guess maybe
we are that kind of a girl.

1034
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:45,230
<i>Exterior. Eiffel Tower. Night.</i>

1035
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:48,630
<i>Rick and Gabby have been driving
and driving and driving.</i>

1036
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:51,842
<i>Through all that
marvellous traffic.</i>

1037
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:56,354
<i>The tower is ablaze.</i>

1038
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:59,670
<i>Richard, how can I type
if you're going to... ?</i>

1039
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:02,282
<i>Alright, alright...</i>

1040
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:03,720
<i>The tower is ablaze</i>

1041
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:06,510
<i>"and chauffeur"-"driven limousines"
are pulling up.</i>

1042
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:11,565
<i>Miss Simpson, how can I dictate
if you're going to... ? Hmm...</i>

1043
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:20,737
Trust me, darling.

1044
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:23,791
I do. Here we go.

1045
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:31,950
<i>And now, darling, Rick and Gabby
make their way to the elevator</i>

1046
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:36,430
<i>which will carry them and us
to the inevitable party scene,</i>

1047
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:39,600
<i>so dear to the hearts
of movie directors everywhere.</i>

1048
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:42,150
<i>It's summer time
and the vita is dolce.</i>

1049
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:45,791
<i>Breakfast is at Tiffany's
and everybody is high.</i>

1050
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:14,317
<i>And now that the director
has distracted the audience</i>

1051
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:16,630
<i>with these
totally extraneous vignettes,</i>

1052
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:20,910
<i>he reluctantly returns to the plot
and another new character.</i>

1053
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:23,230
<i>The producer. Host and victim.</i>

1054
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:26,270
<i>Who looks remarkably like
my producer and victim,</i>

1055
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:28,068
<i>Mr Alex ander Meyerheim.</i>

1056
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:45,310
If you look left, just behind you,
as casually as possible,

1057
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:47,230
you will see that idiot Gillette

1058
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:50,742
dressed appropriately enough
as an executioner.

1059
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:04,417
- Ready, darling?
- Ready, darling.

1060
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:14,300
Excuse me for a moment, darling.

1061
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:19,303
You're late.

1062
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:23,630
Untrue, Gillette. Everything
is going precisely according to plan.

1063
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:26,028
- And the plan, you have it?
- Of course.

1064
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:30,442
While not exactly highly paid
I'm at least... a professional.

1065
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:58,503
Well?

1066
01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:01,710
If you will kindly read this,
I believe the entire situation

1067
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,451
will become clear immediately.

1068
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:14,030
At this very moment,
he's delivering the ransom note.

1069
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:16,190
- The ransom note?
- Exactly.

1070
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:19,870
He has in the trunk of his car
28 reels of film.

1071
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:22,012
They are the negative
and only existing work print

1072
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:25,390
of the producer's just-completed
six-million-dollar spectacle,

1073
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:27,746
<i>The Girl Who Stole
the Eiffel Tower.</i>

1074
01:23:28,190 --> 01:23:31,870
You are certain you have both
the negative and the only work print?

1075
01:23:31,870 --> 01:23:33,326
Absolutely.

1076
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:36,560
And it is your serious intention
to destroy them?

1077
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:39,777
Unless you turn over the key

1078
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:42,831
to your safe-deposit box
in your bank in Casablanca.

1079
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:46,630
My dear boy,
I haven't the faintest idea

1080
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:49,585
who you are.
But you are beautiful. Whoo!

1081
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:54,668
Absolutely beautiful.

1082
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:58,430
Not only that, you've saved my life.

1083
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:03,110
<i>The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower
is frankly a disaster.</i>

1084
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:06,110
The title is symbolic.
She doesn't actually steal it.

1085
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:07,780
Or I don't think she does.

1086
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:10,012
The end's so confusing
it's hard to tell.

1087
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:15,110
Anyway, the script is so ghastly
it could never possibly be released.

1088
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:17,670
I was finished. Done for.
This party tonight

1089
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:22,590
was planned as a final farewell
gesture. A sort of swan song.

1090
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:26,350
At midnight, when the cheque
was presented, I planned to sign it,

1091
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:29,230
add a lavish if purely imaginary tip,

1092
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:34,110
and then as the fireworks were
exploding in the black velvet sky,

1093
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:37,870
to hurl myself from the top
of this grotesque edifice.

1094
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:40,910
And now, suddenly at the last minute,

1095
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:43,566
in the nick of time - don't tell me
there isn't someone up there

1096
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:47,470
who watches over whimsical
movie producers - you appear!

1097
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:49,354
I can't believe it.

1098
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:54,350
If you swear to me
that you will destroy this film,

1099
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:56,577
hook, line and sinker,

1100
01:24:56,630 --> 01:25:02,584
not only will I give you the key to
my safe-deposit box in Casablanca,

1101
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:06,034
but we will split the insurance,

1102
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:07,482
60-40.

1103
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:10,057
50-50.

1104
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:14,830
Oh, my darling, darling boy.
If ever you consider going into

1105
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:17,630
the motion-picture business,
do not hesitate to call me.

1106
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:20,242
I've searched for
a partner like you all my life.

1107
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:23,670
We understand each other perfectly.

1108
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:25,854
You are so beautiful...!

1109
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:29,150
It's a rugged
but curiously sensitive face.

1110
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:31,377
It's so beautiful...!

1111
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:37,950
His plane is waiting for him
at Le Bourget Airport.

1112
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:41,230
His chauffeur's even now
warming up the engines.

1113
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:45,390
Good girl. Tomorrow, your entire
police record will disappear

1114
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:48,670
oh-so-mysteriously from my files
and you will be free.

1115
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:50,168
Thank you, my dear Gillette.

1116
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:04,388
And now, Gillette,
if you could quite casually

1117
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:07,790
dance me across the floor
and over to the gentlemen's lounge.

1118
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:10,960
You fool. You little fool.
He's using you

1119
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:14,030
like he did that poor unfortunate
girl last year in Tangier.

1120
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:16,590
Keep dancing, Gillette.

1121
01:26:16,590 --> 01:26:20,630
I should have known! I should.
That man is irresistible to women.

1122
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:22,630
He is, my dear Gillette.

1123
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:24,386
Keep dancing.

1124
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:27,086
You fool. You little fool.

1125
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:48,336
I've worked the whole thing out
with my analyst.

1126
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:52,430
I don't really hate
Inspector Gillette,

1127
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:55,000
I just feel sorry for him.

1128
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:59,110
He insists on projecting himself
into the starring role

1129
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:02,151
and relegating me
to some minor character.

1130
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:07,110
Got me waiting for him
outside the Eiffel Tower? OK.

1131
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:10,510
Got me saying lines like,
"Brilliant, Inspector, brilliant,"

1132
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:13,422
or, erm, "I have the car here, sir."

1133
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:17,058
Maurice!

1134
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:20,228
Inspector, I am Philippe!

1135
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:25,070
It doesn't matter. Rick is making
his escape at Bourget Airport.

1136
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:26,954
Where is my car?

1137
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:30,830
Erm, I have the car right here, sir.

1138
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:32,886
You read that line beautifully,
Maurice.

1139
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:35,470
Inspector, please. I...

1140
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:38,040
I am not Maurice. I am Philippe.

1141
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:43,470
Dear boy, you are a minor character
and your name is of no importance.

1142
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:46,554
Now you were saying something
about the car?

1143
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:51,120
I have the car right here, sir.
Aiii...

1144
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:12,990
- Faster, Maurice, faster!
- Faster, Philippe, faster.

1145
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:17,150
I keep forgetting.
My God, you are a dull character.

1146
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:20,662
Even in the non-taxing role
of second policeman.

1147
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:25,132
Bourget Airport, quickly!

1148
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:34,468
But if you are the inspector
who was...?

1149
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:38,794
You are third policeman and should
have no lines. Shut up and drive.

1150
01:28:46,270 --> 01:28:49,354
- Do you know what this is?
- The key!

1151
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:52,046
The key to our future.
One million dollars

1152
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:56,565
in small unmarked bills' worth
of happiness for the two of us.

1153
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:03,502
Inspector Gillette of Interpol here.
Calling all patrols.

1154
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:20,406
Faster! Faster!

1155
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:39,710
Erm, the gate, sir, it is closed.

1156
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:41,594
Go through it, you fool.

1157
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:59,645
- Wait here, I'll take him alone.
- Inspector, can I speak to you?

1158
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:05,360
You're Rick.

1159
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:09,710
- I don't understand...
- No, you're not supposed to.

1160
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:11,337
Can't you get it through your mind?

1161
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:14,645
You're only a bit part.
Nobody cares about you.

1162
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:18,030
You're a mere literary convenience.

1163
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:21,950
Someone for the hero to punch
in the jaw at the correct moment.

1164
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:23,834
And that moment, I'm happy to state,

1165
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:25,754
has finally arrived.

1166
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,577
Stop, Rick!

1167
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:42,194
Stop or I'll shoot!

1168
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:45,063
Philippe.

1169
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:47,657
Philippe!

1170
01:30:50,830 --> 01:30:52,800
Mauri... Philippe.

1171
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:09,782
Darling.

1172
01:31:09,790 --> 01:31:13,645
It's alright.
Perhaps it's better this way.

1173
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:19,630
No, no, no, my darling,
we'll make it to Casablanca.

1174
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:23,630
And when we get there,
we'll buy a darling little castle...

1175
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:25,257
With its own...

1176
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:28,417
..private zoo.

1177
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:30,828
And will there be giraffes?

1178
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:33,777
Of course...

1179
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:35,497
Giraffes.

1180
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:45,360
If this is what it means
to be a cop...

1181
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:48,788
You're...

1182
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:51,400
..first policeman now.

1183
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:11,790
<i>Thus having proved once again
that crime does not pay,</i>

1184
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:14,274
<i>unless you happen to be me.</i>

1185
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:18,988
Fade out.

1186
01:32:18,990 --> 01:32:20,446
The end.

1187
01:32:28,430 --> 01:32:30,572
Well, there it is.

1188
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:33,582
All 130-odd pages of it.

1189
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:36,542
Finished with...

1190
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:39,782
..hours to spare.

1191
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:44,566
It's wonderful, Richard.

1192
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:47,470
Only does it have to end that way?

1193
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:51,390
I mean, Philippe could miss
when he shoots

1194
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:54,030
and then
Rick could tell the inspector

1195
01:32:54,030 --> 01:32:57,714
where the stolen film cans are
and give him back the key.

1196
01:32:58,590 --> 01:33:01,790
He could explain
that now that he's met Gabby

1197
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:04,910
he's retiring from
the liar and a thief business

1198
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:08,990
and then the inspector might...
let them go away together.

1199
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:12,830
It could be
the last big switch on the switch.

1200
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:14,372
Couldn't it?

1201
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:17,446
It won't work.

1202
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:20,670
You see, he is a liar and a thief.

1203
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:24,510
And he's been one for too long.
He can't retire now.

1204
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:27,936
In addition to which,
he has become, I'm afraid, ...

1205
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:30,372
..a hack.

1206
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:36,696
He may think he's all those things
but she knows he's not.

1207
01:33:38,670 --> 01:33:41,390
What gives her that curious idea?

1208
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:44,350
She's been with him constantly
for the last few days.

1209
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:49,230
She's seen him shaking with terror,
exhausted, ready to quit.

1210
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:52,485
She's watched him
pull himself together again and...

1211
01:33:54,350 --> 01:33:57,230
..she's also seen him be warm...

1212
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:58,857
..and tender.

1213
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:01,766
And funny.

1214
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:05,731
Not famous international wit funny
but really funny.

1215
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:09,280
Do you think she's an idiot?

1216
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:13,165
Do you think she doesn't know
what kind of man he is?

1217
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:15,582
Or what he needs?

1218
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:23,365
And what he needs is L-O-V-E?

1219
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:31,337
Uh-uh.

1220
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:34,668
It's too late.

1221
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:37,068
He's 43 years old.

1222
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:39,790
Or will be this October.

1223
01:34:39,790 --> 01:34:41,932
He's been married twice,

1224
01:34:42,030 --> 01:34:44,990
both times disastrously,

1225
01:34:44,990 --> 01:34:50,990
and there have been too many years
of... too much dough,

1226
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:53,550
too much bad writing

1227
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:55,092
and too much whisky.

1228
01:34:58,350 --> 01:35:01,434
He's got nothing left inside to give.

1229
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:07,230
Even if he could, which he can't.

1230
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:11,950
But that's not true, Richard,
you can, you have. I just love it.

1231
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:13,234
No, you don't.

1232
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:15,274
It's lousy.

1233
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:20,108
In any case, the problem is, ...

1234
01:35:22,830 --> 01:35:25,950
..you're not in love with the script.

1235
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:28,862
You're in love with me.

1236
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:31,422
And why shouldn't you be?

1237
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:34,350
Suddenly, waltzing into your life

1238
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:36,320
comes this charming,

1239
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:38,492
relatively handsome stranger.

1240
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:41,274
Me.

1241
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:46,590
Smooth as silk with
a highly practised line of chatter,

1242
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:51,790
specifically designed to knock
relatively unsophisticated chicks

1243
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:56,159
like you, Miss Simpson,
right on their ears.

1244
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:59,662
Which I'm terribly afraid
I have done.

1245
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:07,230
Well, ... if it's the last
decent thing I do in this world,

1246
01:36:07,230 --> 01:36:10,056
and it very well may be,

1247
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:12,314
I'm going to fix that.

1248
01:36:13,950 --> 01:36:16,006
I'm going to send you packing,

1249
01:36:16,030 --> 01:36:17,914
Miss Simpson.

1250
01:36:19,230 --> 01:36:21,886
Before I cause you serious...

1251
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:26,708
..and irrevocable harm.

1252
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:30,006
You want the truth?

1253
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:33,206
Of course you don't.

1254
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:37,874
I'll give it to you anyway.

1255
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:42,750
I do not give one damn
about anything,

1256
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:45,870
certainly not my work,
as you so touchingly

1257
01:36:45,870 --> 01:36:48,440
and ingenuously call it.

1258
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:53,710
Well, that's not true.

1259
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:57,908
There is something I care about.
Money.

1260
01:36:58,190 --> 01:37:00,931
And good whisky.

1261
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:04,030
I am, as you've probably noticed,

1262
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:05,914
rather fond of that.

1263
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:12,560
But my work?

1264
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:15,502
That's a hideous little something

1265
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:18,430
that must occur
five days out of the year

1266
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:21,470
so I can spend the other 360

1267
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:24,430
in the manner
to which I have become -

1268
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:28,628
and fully intend to remain -
accustomed.

1269
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:32,332
To you, Richard Benson.

1270
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:38,862
To you and your glorious
professional know-how.

1271
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:50,720
Long may you wave.

1272
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:55,639
And may you... go on...

1273
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:01,486
..fooling...

1274
01:38:03,070 --> 01:38:04,868
..the people.

1275
01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:01,000
Miss Simpson?

1276
01:39:08,430 --> 01:39:09,886
Miss Simpson!

1277
01:39:23,150 --> 01:39:24,520
Gabrielle?

1278
01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:43,790
- Pardon, Maurice.
- Maurice? No, no. Philippe, sir.

1279
01:41:43,790 --> 01:41:46,274
Oh, you don't even know
when a joke is over.

1280
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:47,806
<i>Qui cet homme?</i>

1281
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:51,150
<i>C'est mon patron.
Ne t'en fais pas.</i>

1282
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:54,750
Why, Mr Benson,
what are you doing here?

1283
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:58,990
Miss Simpson, stop overacting, you
know very well what I'm doing here.

1284
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:02,590
Of all the hokey cornball
grade-B picture devices.

1285
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:05,150
She forgot the bird,
she forgot the bird...

1286
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:07,790
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

1287
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:10,590
Girl leaves bird.
Boy has to come looking for girl.

1288
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:13,630
I've written that scene
a thousand times myself.

1289
01:42:13,630 --> 01:42:17,070
Always works, of course.
That's point one.

1290
01:42:17,070 --> 01:42:21,096
Point two. How dare you quit me
when we haven't even started?

1291
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:23,177
Point three...

1292
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:25,708
I love you. Miss Simpson,

1293
01:42:25,710 --> 01:42:30,165
if you don't feel up to the job,
tell me now. I'll get someone else.

1294
01:42:30,590 --> 01:42:33,630
Oh, no, I'm perfectly capable.

1295
01:42:33,630 --> 01:42:37,070
Very well, then,
I hold here in my hand

1296
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:40,430
130-some-odd pages of contrived

1297
01:42:40,430 --> 01:42:43,390
and utterly preposterous,
totally unmotivated...

1298
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:45,870
Oh, if you could only say it
in pictures.

1299
01:42:45,870 --> 01:42:48,182
Come on,
we've got a screenplay to write.

1300
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:51,390
Not starting from scratch, of course.
We've got two great characters.

1301
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:55,674
She's sweet and bright and very very
beautiful and he, well, ...

1302
01:42:56,430 --> 01:43:00,350
..he's gone straight, rather dull.
We need something to jazz him up.

1303
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:03,230
Find something for him to do,
some physical action.

1304
01:43:03,230 --> 01:43:04,857
<i>Madame est avec moi...</i>

1305
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:07,390
To accentuate the masculine image.

1306
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:09,960
There's something in American movies,
a terrible clich,

1307
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:13,310
but you did use it in the script.

1308
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:14,852
Oh, yes...

1309
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:21,406
I think maybe we should, ...
like, split.

1310
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:54,190
Richard, this new movie you're
going to write, what is it about?

1311
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:55,817
It's a love story, naturally.

1312
01:44:55,870 --> 01:45:00,190
It will have a happy ending?
He won't be shot running for a plane?

1313
01:45:00,190 --> 01:45:02,588
On the contrary, Miss Simpson.

1314
01:45:02,590 --> 01:45:04,560
The music soars and there,

1315
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:07,470
totally oblivious of the fireworks,
the fountains

1316
01:45:07,470 --> 01:45:10,190
and the holiday-mad throngs,

1317
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:14,510
they fall happily and tenderly
into each other's arms.

1318
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:17,390
- I know what happens next.
- You do?

1319
01:45:17,390 --> 01:45:21,310
The two enormous
and highly paid heads come together

1320
01:45:21,310 --> 01:45:23,950
for that ultimate
and inevitable moment.

1321
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:26,830
The final, earth-moving,

1322
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:30,670
studio-rent-paying, theatre-filling,

1323
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:32,897
popcorn-selling...
