1
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,839
The assistant warden wants this one
out of the block early.

2
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,840
Wants to get it over with fast.

3
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:57,080
Okay. Let's do it.

4
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,440
Hey, wake up. It's time.

5
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,879
Wake up. Let's go. It's time.

6
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,960
This is it.

7
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,838
7474505B.

8
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:13,718
- What wing?
- Maximum wing, Block 9.

9
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:14,839
Standard release?

10
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,278
Parole, three out of five.
Good behaviour.

11
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,799
Give me a minute.

12
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,319
One Timex digital watch, broken.

13
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,358
One unused prophylactic.

14
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,918
One soiled.

15
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,839
Boots, black.
Belt, black.

16
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:29,558
One black suit jacket.

17
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,199
One pair black suit pants.

18
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:37,999
One hat.

19
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:39,759
Black.

20
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:43,399
One pair sunglasses.

21
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,118
Twenty-three dollars
and seven cents.

22
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:52,798
Sign here.

23
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,238
- What's this?
- What?

24
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:44,837
This car.

25
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:46,757
This stupid car.

26
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,798
Where's the Cadillac?

27
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,918
The Caddy.
Where's the Caddy?

28
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:56,597
The what?

29
00:07:56,678 --> 00:08:00,198
The Cadillac we used to have.
The Bluesmobile.

30
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:01,638
I traded it.

31
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:05,318
- You traded the Bluesmobile for this?
- No, for a microphone.

32
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:06,758
A microphone?

33
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:10,438
Okay, I can see that.

34
00:08:10,518 --> 00:08:13,598
- What the hell is this?
- This was a bargain.

35
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:16,797
I picked it up at the Mount Prospect
City Police Auction last spring.

36
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:20,637
It's an old Mount Prospect police car.
They were practically giving them away.

37
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,117
Well, thank you, pal.

38
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:27,397
The day I get out of prison...

39
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:31,117
my own brother picks me up
in a police car.

40
00:08:54,437 --> 00:08:56,358
You don't like it?

41
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:01,638
No, I don't like it.

42
00:09:19,798 --> 00:09:21,637
Car's got a lot of pick-up.

43
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:24,597
It's got a cop motor,
a 440-cubic-inch plant.

44
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:28,197
It's got cop tyres,
cop suspension, cop shocks.

45
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:30,317
A model made
before catalytic converters...

46
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:32,837
so it'll run good on regular gas.

47
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:36,197
What do you say?
Is it the new Bluesmobile, or what?

48
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:40,837
Fix the cigarette lighter.

49
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:18,077
What are we doing here?

50
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:22,317
You promised you'd visit
the Penguin the day you got out.

51
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:25,477
Yeah. So I lied to her.

52
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,557
You can't lie to a nun.

53
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:30,276
We gotta go in
and visit the Penguin.

54
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:33,556
No fucking way.

55
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:32,717
Who is it?

56
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:34,637
Jake and Elwood.

57
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:39,717
Come in.

58
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:57,797
Hello, boys.

59
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:01,197
Nice to see you.

60
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:04,156
Please, have a seat.

61
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:20,597
No, boys.

62
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:22,756
Come over here in front of me.

63
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:25,597
I want to see your faces.

64
00:12:38,076 --> 00:12:42,476
The county took a tax assessment
of this property last month.

65
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:45,277
They want $5,000.

66
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:47,116
Won't the church pay?

67
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:51,316
They would if they were
interested in keeping the place.

68
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:54,956
But they aren't.

69
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:59,195
The archbishop wants to sell this
building to the Board of Education.

70
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:00,796
What will happen to you?

71
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:03,476
I'll be sent to the missions--

72
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:07,716
Africa, Latin America...

73
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:09,356
- Korea.
- Forget it!

74
00:13:09,436 --> 00:13:12,836
Five grand? No problem. We'll have it
for you in the morning. Let's go.

75
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:17,397
I will not take
your filthy, stolen money!

76
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:23,716
Well, then.
I guess you're really up shit creek.

77
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:27,876
I beg your pardon.
What did you say?

78
00:13:28,996 --> 00:13:30,836
I offered to help you.

79
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:34,996
You refused to take our money.

80
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:39,316
Then I said,
"I guess you're really up shit creek."

81
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,036
- Christ, Jake, take it easy, man.
- Elwood!

82
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:45,116
- Ow! Shit!
-Jesus Christ!

83
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:46,716
- Shit!
-Jesus!

84
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:49,036
- Shit! God dam it!
- Son of a bitch!

85
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:54,676
You fat penguin!

86
00:13:58,756 --> 00:13:59,676
Fuck this!

87
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:14,716
You are
such a disappointing pair.

88
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:17,756
I prayed so hard for you.

89
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:19,716
It saddens and hurts me...

90
00:14:19,796 --> 00:14:22,155
that the two young men
whom I raised...

91
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,316
to believe
in the Ten Commandments...

92
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:27,356
have returned to me
as two thieves...

93
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:31,996
with filthy mouths
and bad attitudes.

94
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:34,036
Get out!

95
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:36,556
And don't come back...

96
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:40,636
until you've
redeemed yourselves.

97
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:50,555
Boys, you gotta learn
not to talk to nuns that way.

98
00:14:54,716 --> 00:14:56,436
Curtis!

99
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:58,996
- You look fine!
- Good to see you!

100
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:00,916
Buy you boys a drink?

101
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:07,555
Boys, things are bad.

102
00:15:07,636 --> 00:15:10,556
They gonna sell this place
to the Board of Education...

103
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:12,556
and I'll be out on the street.

104
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:18,156
That money's got to be in the Cook
County Assessor's Office within 11 days.

105
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:22,795
They wouldn't turn you out,
would they?

106
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:28,676
Shit. What's one more old nigger
to the Board of Education?

107
00:15:30,316 --> 00:15:33,595
Curtis, you and the Penguin
are the only family we got.

108
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:36,635
You're the only one
that was ever good to us...

109
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:41,156
singing Elmore James tunes and
blowing the harp for us down here.

110
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:45,955
Well, the sister was right. You boys
could use a little churching up.

111
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:48,676
Slide on down
to the Triple Rock...

112
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:51,155
and catch Reverend Cleophus.

113
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:54,036
You boys listen
to what he's got to say.

114
00:15:58,235 --> 00:16:00,155
I don't want to listen
to no jive-ass preacher...

115
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:02,516
talking to me
about heaven and hell.

116
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:06,595
You get wise.
You get to church!

117
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:24,315
All I'm saying is,
we got to figure out...

118
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:26,795
some way
to get that money honestly.

119
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,875
That could be a problem.

120
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,235
Like the Penguin says.

121
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:34,835
We got to move toward redemption.
We got to go to church.

122
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:38,275
"We got to move toward redemption.
We got to go to church."

123
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:39,675
Bullshit.

124
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:41,835
Come on.

125
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:03,315
And now, this week's sermon...

126
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:06,395
is from our beloved,
the Reverend Cleophus James!

127
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:16,155
And now, people--

128
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:19,275
And now, people--

129
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:25,516
When I woke up this morning,
I heard a disturbing sound.

130
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:30,315
I said,
when I woke up this morning...

131
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:32,715
I heard a disturbing sound!

132
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:37,435
What I heard
was the jingle-jangle...

133
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,434
of a thousand lost souls!

134
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:43,955
I'm talking about the souls
of mortal men and women...

135
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:45,915
departed from this life!

136
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:48,875
Wait a minute!

137
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:53,434
Those lost, anguished souls
roaming unseen over the earth...

138
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,954
seeking a divine light...

139
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,515
they'll not find
because it's too late!

140
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:06,115
Too late! Yeah! Too late
for them to ever see again...

141
00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:10,714
the light they once chose
not to follow! All right!

142
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:13,834
Don't be lost
when the time comes!

143
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:17,475
For the day of the Lord cometh...

144
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,115
as a thief in the night!

145
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:22,995
Amen

146
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:25,875
Say amen!

147
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:34,954
- Let us all
-All go back

148
00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:36,594
- To the old
- Old landmark

149
00:18:42,674 --> 00:18:45,715
As we stay
in the service of the Lord

150
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:48,594
- Let us preach
- Preach the word

151
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:52,074
- Got to preach
- Preach the word all the way

152
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:57,114
Do it, know it, feel it

153
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,754
Jake, are you all right?

154
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:34,274
Alleluia

155
00:20:36,513 --> 00:20:38,634
The band.

156
00:20:41,354 --> 00:20:43,074
Do you see the light?

157
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:49,554
What light?

158
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:51,555
Have you seen the light?

159
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:56,754
Yes!
Jesus H. Tap-Dancing Christ!

160
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:59,634
I have seen the light!

161
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,194
The band!

162
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:35,873
- Praise God!
- And God bless the United States!

163
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:42,234
Stay in the service
of the Lord

164
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:53,714
Yea, Lord

165
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:21,393
We'll put the band back together,
we do a few gigs...

166
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:24,633
we get some bread.
Bang-- five thousand bucks!

167
00:23:24,713 --> 00:23:29,033
Well, getting the band
back together might not be that easy.

168
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:31,913
- What are you talking about?
- They split.

169
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,033
They all took straight jobs.

170
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,193
Yeah? So you know
where they are.

171
00:23:36,274 --> 00:23:38,313
You said you were
keeping in touch with them.

172
00:23:39,632 --> 00:23:43,913
I got a couple of leads,
a few phone numbers.

173
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:46,913
But, I mean, how many of them
visited or even wrote you?

174
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:50,192
They're not the kind of guys
who write letters.

175
00:23:50,273 --> 00:23:52,993
You were outside.
I was inside.

176
00:23:53,073 --> 00:23:56,313
You were supposed to keep
in touch with the band.

177
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,194
I kept asking you
if we were gonna play again.

178
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:03,073
What was I gonna do,
take away your only hope?

179
00:24:04,113 --> 00:24:06,993
Take away the very thing
that kept you going in there?

180
00:24:07,073 --> 00:24:09,793
I took the liberty
of bullshitting you. Okay?

181
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:14,393
- You lied to me.
- It wasn't lies. It was just bullshit.

182
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:28,673
- Shit.
- What?

183
00:24:28,753 --> 00:24:30,593
- Rollers.
- No.

184
00:24:30,672 --> 00:24:32,233
Shit.

185
00:25:07,952 --> 00:25:11,832
- What? What did I do?
- You failed to stop at a red signal.

186
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:14,153
The light was yellow, sir.

187
00:25:14,232 --> 00:25:16,553
May I see your license, please?

188
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:24,313
God dam it!

189
00:25:24,393 --> 00:25:27,792
I haven't been pulled over
in six months.

190
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:30,073
I bet those cops
have got SCMODS.

191
00:25:32,593 --> 00:25:37,152
State County Municipal Offender
Data System.

192
00:26:01,712 --> 00:26:04,992
Elwood, we show your license
currently under suspension.

193
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:07,393
Step out of the car, please.

194
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:30,912
First you trade the Cadillac
for a microphone.

195
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:33,152
Then you lie to me
about the band.

196
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:35,393
Now you're gonna put me
right back in the joint!

197
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:38,192
They're not gonna catch us.
We're on a mission from God.

198
00:26:54,952 --> 00:26:58,552
We are in high-speed pursuit
northbound on Courtland Avenue.

199
00:26:58,632 --> 00:27:01,952
Black-and-white 1 974 Dodge sedan
with Illinois plates.

200
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:04,152
Request assistance.

201
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:30,071
We'll be all right if we can
just get back on the expressway.

202
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:34,152
This don't look
like no expressway to me!

203
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,952
Don't yell at me.

204
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:40,191
What do you want me to do,
motor head?

205
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:42,271
Try not to be so negative
all the time.

206
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:45,192
Why don't you offer
some constructive criticism?

207
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:53,592
You got us into this parking lot, pal.
Now you get us out!

208
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,432
You want out
of this parking lot?

209
00:27:58,872 --> 00:28:01,072
- Will there be anything else?
- Do you have Miss Piggy?

210
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:23,952
- There's pants and burgers.
- Yeah, lots of space in this mall.

211
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:38,392
Disco pants and haircuts.

212
00:29:04,712 --> 00:29:06,552
Baby clothes.

213
00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:08,671
This place has got everything.

214
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:23,912
New Oldsmobiles
are in early this year.

215
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:45,391
Pier 1 imports.

216
00:29:58,591 --> 00:29:59,951
Oh, shit!

217
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:39,351
They broke my watch!

218
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:41,911
I'm gonna catch that sucker...

219
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:44,711
if it's the last thing
I ever do.

220
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,150
Nice place, huh?

221
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,950
Hey, Sam.

222
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,750
Hey, Lloyd.

223
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:38,949
- Anybody call for me on the phone?
- No. No calls.

224
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:43,430
Some guy left his card.
Cop. Said he'd be back.

225
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,950
This here's my brother, Jake.
He just got out of the joint.

226
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,949
He's gonna be staying with me
for a few weeks.

227
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,629
Yeah. Okay.

228
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:05,269
Did you get me
my Cheez Whiz, boy?

229
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,149
Well, it ain't much,
but it's home.

230
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:33,910
- How often does the train go by?
- So often you won't even notice it.

231
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,509
What are you doing?

232
00:36:02,588 --> 00:36:04,910
Making dinner.
Want some?

233
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:11,990
Tomorrow we got to get
the band back together.

234
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,789
I'm gonna quit work
in the morning, first thing.

235
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:16,988
And how are you going
to get to work...

236
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:20,189
Mr Lead Foot, Mr Hot-Rodder,
Mr Motor Head?

237
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:22,669
Those cops took your license away.

238
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,749
They got your name,
your address.

239
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:27,389
No, they don't got my address.
I falsified my renewal.

240
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:30,069
I put down 1 060 West Addison.

241
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:38,149
That's Wrigley Field.

242
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,669
I gotta hit the sack.

243
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,469
Hey, you sleaze! My bed!

244
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:35,948
This, gentlemen, is the elegant
abode of one Elwood Blues.

245
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:37,669
Thanks, Mr Mercer.

246
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:42,229
- I kinda like the Wrigley Field bit.
- Yeah, real cute.

247
00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:52,148
Hi, Sam.

248
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:06,868
Hi. Has my friend arrived yet?
He failed to report in yesterday.

249
00:39:06,948 --> 00:39:08,348
I don't want trouble.

250
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,788
Tell us where they are,
and there'll be no trouble.

251
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,428
Stand back.

252
00:40:10,148 --> 00:40:13,108
It's almost 9:00.
We've gotta go to work.

253
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:10,548
Hello, Elwood. Sit down.
What's on your mind?

254
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:12,747
I gotta quit.

255
00:41:13,508 --> 00:41:16,108
Why is that, Elwood?

256
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:19,228
I'm going to become a priest.

257
00:41:28,148 --> 00:41:31,148
I'll call payroll and have them get
your severance pay ready.

258
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:39,067
- Good luck.
- God bless you, sir.

259
00:41:39,148 --> 00:41:40,308
Thank you.

260
00:41:53,988 --> 00:41:58,748
- What's this?
- This is the last known address...

261
00:41:58,827 --> 00:42:01,428
of Bones Malone
and Blue Lou Marini.

262
00:42:05,387 --> 00:42:08,227
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

263
00:42:51,188 --> 00:42:53,827
- Mrs Toronto?
- Tarantino.

264
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:58,308
Ma'am, do you have a Thomas Malone
or Louis Marini living here?

265
00:42:59,587 --> 00:43:02,547
Not any more.
They moved out a long time ago.

266
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:04,947
I don't take in boarders any more.

267
00:43:06,426 --> 00:43:09,627
- May we come in, ma'am?
- Please.

268
00:43:19,828 --> 00:43:23,268
Did they leave a forwarding address?
A phone number?

269
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:26,147
Did they live quietly?
What were their personal habits?

270
00:43:26,227 --> 00:43:28,348
They were good boys...

271
00:43:28,427 --> 00:43:31,627
but they made
a lot of racket at night.

272
00:43:31,707 --> 00:43:33,548
Are you the police?

273
00:43:33,627 --> 00:43:35,867
No, ma'am.
We're musicians.

274
00:43:37,987 --> 00:43:39,347
Mr Man!

275
00:43:44,907 --> 00:43:49,266
- Yes, ma'am?
- They left this card. Maybe it'll help.

276
00:44:01,828 --> 00:44:03,748
Thanks.

277
00:45:00,026 --> 00:45:02,107
Thank you. You're marvellous.

278
00:45:04,627 --> 00:45:07,306
Thank you. I'm Murph,
and these are the Magic Tones.

279
00:45:07,387 --> 00:45:09,667
Steve "The Colonel" Cropper,
Donald "Duck" Dunn...

280
00:45:09,746 --> 00:45:12,747
Willie "Too Big" Hall
and Tom "Bones" Malone.

281
00:45:12,827 --> 00:45:14,787
We'll be back with the Magic Tones
for the Armada Room's...

282
00:45:14,867 --> 00:45:17,267
two-hour disco swing party
after this short break.

283
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:20,507
Till then, don't you go changing.

284
00:45:23,827 --> 00:45:27,827
So you're out. You're free.
You're rehabilitated.

285
00:45:27,906 --> 00:45:30,787
What's next? What's happening?
What you gonna do?

286
00:45:30,866 --> 00:45:33,027
You got the money you owe us,
mother-fucker?

287
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:35,546
Let's get something
straight here.

288
00:45:35,626 --> 00:45:37,907
The reason he got locked in the slam
in the first place...

289
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:40,826
was for sticking up a gas station
to cover you guys.

290
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:42,466
You're kidding.

291
00:45:42,546 --> 00:45:45,347
He pulled that job to pay
for the band's room-service tab...

292
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:47,906
from that Kiwanis gig
in Coal City.

293
00:45:47,986 --> 00:45:49,826
- You did?
- That's right.

294
00:45:49,906 --> 00:45:53,106
So I don't want to hear
any more of this small-change shit.

295
00:45:53,186 --> 00:45:55,026
We're putting the band
back together.

296
00:45:59,266 --> 00:46:03,746
Who here at this table
can honestly say...

297
00:46:03,826 --> 00:46:07,787
that they played any finer
or felt any better than they did...

298
00:46:07,867 --> 00:46:09,787
when they were
with the Blues Brothers?

299
00:46:12,706 --> 00:46:14,827
You were the backbone...

300
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:18,507
the nerve centre
of a great rhythm-and-blues band.

301
00:46:18,586 --> 00:46:22,786
You can make that live,
breathe and jump again.

302
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:24,906
Murph and the Magic Tones?

303
00:46:24,986 --> 00:46:28,027
Look at you in those
candy-ass monkey suits.

304
00:46:28,106 --> 00:46:30,586
And I thought
I had it bad in Joliet.

305
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:32,827
At least we got
a change in clothes.

306
00:46:32,906 --> 00:46:35,386
You're wearing the same shit
from three years ago.

307
00:46:35,466 --> 00:46:37,386
Jake ain't lying, though.

308
00:46:37,466 --> 00:46:40,706
We had a band powerful enough
to turn goat piss into gasoline.

309
00:46:40,786 --> 00:46:43,947
We'll never get that fat sound again
without more horns.

310
00:46:44,026 --> 00:46:45,866
We'll never get Mr Fabulous.

311
00:46:45,946 --> 00:46:47,945
- Where is he?
- Forget it.

312
00:46:48,026 --> 00:46:50,347
Mr Fabulous is the top maitre d'
at the Chez Paul.

313
00:46:50,426 --> 00:46:52,427
He's pullin' down
six bills a week.

314
00:46:52,506 --> 00:46:55,786
- Matt Murphy got married.
- Where is Matt "Guitar" Murphy?

315
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:57,866
He opened a restaurant with his old lady
on Maxwell Street...

316
00:46:57,947 --> 00:46:59,946
and he took Blue Lou with him.

317
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:04,586
You'll never get Matt and Mr Fabulous
out of them high-paying gigs.

318
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:07,306
Oh, yeah?

319
00:47:07,386 --> 00:47:09,867
Well, me and the Lord...

320
00:47:09,946 --> 00:47:12,186
we got an understanding.

321
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:14,346
We're on a mission from God.

322
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,945
Mainly French cuisine.

323
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:32,746
No, sir. Mayor Daley no longer
dines here. He's dead, sir.

324
00:47:33,905 --> 00:47:36,426
Private dining rooms
are available.

325
00:47:37,465 --> 00:47:39,865
Oh, no. It was supposed to be
five years.

326
00:47:39,945 --> 00:47:42,665
Didn't you get five years?
No, sir, not you.

327
00:47:42,746 --> 00:47:44,585
And your name, sir?

328
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:48,906
Rizzolo, for eight at 11:30.
Thank you.

329
00:47:50,747 --> 00:47:53,985
Mr Fabulous,
how marvellous it is to see you.

330
00:47:54,065 --> 00:47:56,906
- You're looking younger than ever.
- Wait. You guys can't come in here.

331
00:47:56,986 --> 00:47:58,985
Nonsense, my dear fellow.

332
00:47:59,066 --> 00:48:01,026
My brother and I
have come to dine...

333
00:48:01,105 --> 00:48:03,866
to celebrate my early release
from the service of the state.

334
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:06,666
Wait. Let's talk outside.

335
00:48:06,746 --> 00:48:08,666
- Let's have a cup of coffee outside.
- Why, heavens, no.

336
00:48:08,746 --> 00:48:11,706
We seek a full meal and all
the compliments of the house.

337
00:48:11,785 --> 00:48:13,625
Come, Elwood.

338
00:48:13,706 --> 00:48:16,066
Let us adjourn ourselves
to the nearest table...

339
00:48:16,145 --> 00:48:19,466
and overlook this establishment's
board of fare.

340
00:48:20,506 --> 00:48:23,386
Good evening. Chez Paul.
Wait! Hey!

341
00:48:23,466 --> 00:48:27,226
Sir, do you mind calling back
in about five minutes, please?

342
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:50,505
We'll have a table
in a few moments.

343
00:48:56,986 --> 00:48:58,346
Excuse me.

344
00:48:58,426 --> 00:49:00,985
Give us a bottle
of your finest champagne...

345
00:49:01,065 --> 00:49:04,425
five shrimp cocktails
and some bread for my brother.

346
00:49:04,505 --> 00:49:08,106
We have a Dom Pignon '71
at $1 20.

347
00:49:08,185 --> 00:49:10,265
That'll be fine, pal.

348
00:49:13,945 --> 00:49:18,585
Seriously, the food here is really
expensive. The soup is fucking $1 0!

349
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:21,506
Let's go outside.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

350
00:49:22,265 --> 00:49:24,265
We're putting the band
back together.

351
00:49:24,345 --> 00:49:27,625
- Forget it. No way.
- We're on a mission from God.

352
00:49:28,786 --> 00:49:30,625
Hold it. Hold it.
What's this?

353
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:32,545
Waiter? Sir?

354
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:34,665
Please, waiter?

355
00:49:37,065 --> 00:49:38,906
Yes, sir? How are your salads?

356
00:49:38,985 --> 00:49:41,426
The salads are fine.

357
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:45,906
It?s just that we'd like
to move to another table...

358
00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:48,305
away from those two gentlemen.

359
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,225
Why? Have they been
disturbing you?

360
00:49:51,386 --> 00:49:53,865
No. It?s just that--

361
00:49:53,945 --> 00:49:57,186
Well, frankly,
they're offensive-smelling.

362
00:49:57,265 --> 00:49:59,905
I mean, they smell bad.

363
00:50:02,505 --> 00:50:05,305
Excuse me. I'll see if I can locate
another table for you.

364
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:06,745
Thank you.

365
00:50:17,785 --> 00:50:19,304
Wrong glass, sir.

366
00:51:08,345 --> 00:51:10,585
How much for the little girl?

367
00:51:10,664 --> 00:51:13,705
- The women? How much for the women?
- What?

368
00:51:13,784 --> 00:51:15,785
I want to buy your women.

369
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:19,144
Your little girl. Your daughters.
Sell them to me.

370
00:51:19,225 --> 00:51:21,545
- Sell me your children.
- Maitre d'!

371
00:51:29,585 --> 00:51:33,065
Cut it out. The owners are gonna
ask me to call the cops.

372
00:51:33,145 --> 00:51:36,425
- You wouldn't do that to me, would you?
- He just got outta Joliet.

373
00:51:36,505 --> 00:51:39,465
He's on parole. You can't
call the cops on him, man.

374
00:51:40,345 --> 00:51:42,385
- We're putting the band back together.
- I said no.

375
00:51:42,464 --> 00:51:43,944
Absolutely not!

376
00:51:46,344 --> 00:51:48,264
How much for your wife?

377
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:54,425
We're putting the band back together.
We need you, man. We need your horn.

378
00:51:54,504 --> 00:51:56,225
I really can't.

379
00:51:56,304 --> 00:51:58,585
We got everybody except
Matt "Guitar" Murphy and Blue Lou.

380
00:51:58,664 --> 00:52:00,905
- We're getting them next.
- No way.

381
00:52:05,744 --> 00:52:08,865
If you say no, Elwood and I
will come here for breakfast...

382
00:52:08,944 --> 00:52:11,865
Lunch and dinner
every day of the week.

383
00:52:15,185 --> 00:52:18,304
Okay. I'll play.
You got me.

384
00:52:21,624 --> 00:52:22,985
Sir?

385
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,385
White men!

386
00:52:40,464 --> 00:52:42,664
White women!

387
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:46,544
The swastika is calling you!

388
00:52:47,545 --> 00:52:52,225
The sacred and ancient symbol
of your race...

389
00:52:52,305 --> 00:52:55,144
since the beginning of time.

390
00:52:56,465 --> 00:53:00,743
The Jew is using the black...

391
00:53:00,824 --> 00:53:03,864
as muscle against you.

392
00:53:05,024 --> 00:53:08,505
And you are left there, helpless.

393
00:53:08,584 --> 00:53:13,223
-Fuck you!
-What are you gonna do about it, whity?

394
00:53:14,464 --> 00:53:17,624
-Just sit there?
- Go back where you came from!

395
00:53:17,704 --> 00:53:19,464
Of course not!

396
00:53:19,544 --> 00:53:22,303
- Son of a bitch!
- You are going to join...

397
00:53:22,385 --> 00:53:23,783
with us...

398
00:53:24,544 --> 00:53:26,184
the members of...

399
00:53:26,264 --> 00:53:30,304
the American Socialist
White People's Party:

400
00:53:31,425 --> 00:53:34,704
an organization of decent...

401
00:53:34,784 --> 00:53:37,864
Law-abiding white folk...

402
00:53:37,943 --> 00:53:40,304
just like you.

403
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,584
Go to hell, bastards!

404
00:53:42,664 --> 00:53:44,065
Go to hell!

405
00:53:44,144 --> 00:53:46,224
I pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler...

406
00:53:48,584 --> 00:53:50,184
the immortal leader of our race.

407
00:53:52,183 --> 00:53:53,983
To the order for which he stands.

408
00:53:55,943 --> 00:53:58,184
One great cause.

409
00:53:58,264 --> 00:54:00,823
Sacred and invincible.

410
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,624
Hey, what's going on?

411
00:54:03,704 --> 00:54:06,825
Those bums won their court case
so they're marching today.

412
00:54:06,904 --> 00:54:09,903
- What bums?
- The fucking Nazi party.

413
00:54:11,304 --> 00:54:13,144
Illinois Nazis.

414
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,743
I hate Illinois Nazis.

415
00:54:16,824 --> 00:54:19,104
Heil Hitler!

416
00:54:26,143 --> 00:54:27,344
Ten-hut!

417
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:43,223
- Gruppenfuehrer!
- Yes, sir!

418
00:54:43,304 --> 00:54:46,704
Get that car's license plate number.

419
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,704
We're gonna kill
that son of a bitch.

420
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:17,143
Come on home, babe

421
00:55:20,224 --> 00:55:22,303
Oh, come on home, woman

422
00:55:24,223 --> 00:55:28,304
Oh, come on home, pretty baby

423
00:55:28,384 --> 00:55:30,224
I love you

424
00:56:18,823 --> 00:56:20,983
When she walk that walk

425
00:56:21,063 --> 00:56:22,903
And talk that talk

426
00:56:24,702 --> 00:56:27,223
And whisper in my ear

427
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:30,103
Tell me that she love me

428
00:56:30,183 --> 00:56:32,943
I love that talk

429
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,264
That baby talk

430
00:56:35,343 --> 00:56:37,263
When she talk like that

431
00:56:38,383 --> 00:56:40,343
I can?t take it like that

432
00:56:47,463 --> 00:56:49,983
Come on home to me, baby

433
00:56:50,064 --> 00:56:53,504
Walk your walk
Talk your talk

434
00:56:55,224 --> 00:56:57,583
Talk your talk, baby

435
00:57:30,503 --> 00:57:32,222
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

436
00:57:32,303 --> 00:57:35,023
That was "Boom, Boom,"
a song that I wrote back in the '50s.

437
00:57:35,103 --> 00:57:36,823
- No, you didn't.
- It was a hit.

438
00:57:36,903 --> 00:57:39,062
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

439
00:57:39,663 --> 00:57:42,263
I wrote "Boom, Boom"!
I wrote "Boom, Boom"!

440
00:57:53,062 --> 00:57:55,823
- Can I help you, boys?
- You got any white bread?

441
00:57:55,903 --> 00:57:57,264
Yes.

442
00:57:57,343 --> 00:58:00,023
I'll have some
toasted white bread, please.

443
00:58:02,262 --> 00:58:04,222
You want butter or jam
on that toast, honey?

444
00:58:04,302 --> 00:58:05,463
No, ma'am. Dry.

445
00:58:07,302 --> 00:58:11,543
- Got any fried chicken?
- Best damn chicken in the state.

446
00:58:11,623 --> 00:58:14,103
Bring me four fried chickens
and a Coke.

447
00:58:14,182 --> 00:58:16,382
You want chicken wings
or chicken legs?

448
00:58:16,463 --> 00:58:18,943
Four fried chickens and a Coke.

449
00:58:19,023 --> 00:58:20,783
And some dry white toast, please.

450
00:58:20,863 --> 00:58:22,863
You all want anything to drink
with that?

451
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:24,543
- No, ma'am.
- A Coke.

452
00:58:24,622 --> 00:58:26,863
Be up in a minute.

453
00:58:26,942 --> 00:58:30,942
We got two honkies out there
dressed like Hasidic diamond merchants.

454
00:58:31,023 --> 00:58:34,422
- Say what?
- They look like they're from the CIA.

455
00:58:34,503 --> 00:58:39,223
- What they wanna eat?
- The tall one wants white-bread toast.

456
00:58:39,302 --> 00:58:42,063
- Dry. With nothing on it.
- Elwood!

457
00:58:42,142 --> 00:58:46,422
And the other one wants
four whole fried chickens and a Coke.

458
00:58:46,503 --> 00:58:48,783
And Jake! Shit!
The Blues Brothers!

459
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:52,142
- Hi, Jake!
- Matt! How you doing?

460
00:58:52,222 --> 00:58:54,822
- How was Joliet?
- Oh, it's bad.

461
00:58:54,902 --> 00:58:56,663
On Thursday night
they serve a wicked pepper steak.

462
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:59,783
Can't be as bad as the cabbage rolls
at the Terre Haute Federal Pen.

463
00:58:59,862 --> 00:59:02,023
Or that oatmeal
at the Cook County slammer.

464
00:59:02,102 --> 00:59:04,542
- They're all pretty bad.
- Matt--

465
00:59:04,622 --> 00:59:06,222
Me and Elwood--

466
00:59:06,302 --> 00:59:08,622
we're putting the band back together.

467
00:59:08,703 --> 00:59:10,142
We need you and Blue Lou.

468
00:59:10,223 --> 00:59:12,502
Don't talk that way around here.
My old lady--

469
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:14,422
- She'll kill me.
- Ma'am, you gotta understand.

470
00:59:14,503 --> 00:59:18,542
This is a lot bigger than any domestic
problems you might be experiencing.

471
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,541
Matt, what the hell
is he talking about?

472
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,582
- Don't get riled, sugar.
- Don't you "sugar" me!

473
00:59:23,662 --> 00:59:25,622
Now, you not going
back on the road no more.

474
00:59:25,702 --> 00:59:28,422
And you ain't playing
any more two-bit, sleazy dives.

475
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:29,983
You're living with me now...

476
00:59:30,062 --> 00:59:33,663
and you're not gonna go sliding around
with your white hoodlum friends.

477
00:59:33,742 --> 00:59:37,422
But, babes! This is Jake and Elwood!
The Blues Brothers!

478
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:42,143
The Blues Brothers! Shit!

479
00:59:42,222 --> 00:59:45,302
They still owe you money, fool!

480
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,463
Ma'am.

481
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,502
Would it make you feel better
if you knew...

482
00:59:48,582 --> 00:59:51,742
that what we're asking Matt to do
is a holy thing?

483
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:54,742
You see,
we're on a mission from God.

484
00:59:54,823 --> 00:59:57,462
Don't you blaspheme in here!

485
00:59:57,542 --> 00:59:59,982
Now, this is my man,
my restaurant...

486
01:00:00,062 --> 01:00:02,062
and you two are gonna
walk right out that door...

487
01:00:02,142 --> 01:00:04,182
without your dry, white toast...

488
01:00:04,262 --> 01:00:06,062
without your four fried chickens...

489
01:00:06,142 --> 01:00:08,663
and without Matt "Guitar" Murphy!

490
01:00:08,742 --> 01:00:10,303
Now you listen to me!
I love you.

491
01:00:10,382 --> 01:00:12,182
But I'm the man
and you're the woman.

492
01:00:12,262 --> 01:00:14,222
And I'll make the decisions
concerning my life!

493
01:00:14,303 --> 01:00:16,022
You better think about
what you saying.

494
01:00:16,102 --> 01:00:18,542
You better think about
the consequences of your actions.

495
01:00:18,622 --> 01:00:19,862
Shut up, woman!

496
01:00:20,422 --> 01:00:21,423
You better think

497
01:00:21,502 --> 01:00:23,342
Think about what you?re
trying to do to me

498
01:00:23,422 --> 01:00:25,062
Yeah, think

499
01:00:25,143 --> 01:00:27,582
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

500
01:00:27,662 --> 01:00:29,022
Let?s go back

501
01:00:29,102 --> 01:00:30,902
Let's go way on back when

502
01:00:30,982 --> 01:00:34,901
I didn't even know you, you couldn't
have been too much more than ten

503
01:00:34,982 --> 01:00:38,102
I ain't no psychiatrist
lain 't no doctor with degree

504
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:41,502
It don't take too much high IQ
to see what you?re doing to me

505
01:00:41,582 --> 01:00:43,102
You better think

506
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:45,222
Think about what you?re trying
to do to me

507
01:00:45,302 --> 01:00:46,862
Think

508
01:00:46,942 --> 01:00:49,181
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

509
01:00:49,262 --> 01:00:51,062
Freedom

510
01:00:54,462 --> 01:00:56,181
Yeah, freedom right now

511
01:01:03,782 --> 01:01:05,502
Hey, think about it

512
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:07,062
You, think about it

513
01:01:07,142 --> 01:01:09,942
There ain't nothing you could ask
l could answer you, but I won't

514
01:01:10,021 --> 01:01:14,262
But I was gonna change that, I'm not
if you keep doing things l don't

515
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,181
Think about what you?re trying
to do to me

516
01:01:17,262 --> 01:01:18,422
Damn it

517
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:21,222
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

518
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:24,502
People walking around everyday
playing games and taking scores

519
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:27,861
Tryin' to make people lose their mind
Now, be careful you don't lose yours

520
01:01:35,662 --> 01:01:37,101
You need me

521
01:01:37,181 --> 01:01:39,022
And l need you

522
01:01:39,102 --> 01:01:42,261
Without each other
there ain't nothing either can do

523
01:01:42,342 --> 01:01:46,062
- Yeah, think about it, baby
- What you trying to do to me

524
01:01:46,142 --> 01:01:48,942
To the bone
Think about it right now

525
01:01:49,982 --> 01:01:51,462
Oh, freedom

526
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:08,142
You, think about it

527
01:02:08,221 --> 01:02:11,181
There ain 't nothing you could ask
l can answer you, but I won't

528
01:02:11,262 --> 01:02:14,421
But I was gonna change my mind
if you keep doing things l don?t

529
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:23,541
You need me

530
01:02:23,622 --> 01:02:25,262
And l need you

531
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:28,702
Without each other
there ain 't nothing either can do

532
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:32,301
- Think about it, baby
- What you?re trying to do to me

533
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:33,741
To the bone, man

534
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:35,501
Think about it, baby

535
01:02:35,581 --> 01:02:37,622
- Yeah, right on
- To the bone

536
01:02:37,702 --> 01:02:40,061
- For deepening
- To the bone, for deeps

537
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,542
Deepening

538
01:02:46,622 --> 01:02:48,302
Right now

539
01:02:48,381 --> 01:02:50,141
Think about it, yeah, yeah

540
01:02:50,222 --> 01:02:52,422
To the bone
For deepening

541
01:02:55,341 --> 01:02:56,541
Think about it

542
01:02:56,621 --> 01:02:59,061
To the bone

543
01:03:02,501 --> 01:03:04,541
Don't give me the Blues Brothers

544
01:03:04,622 --> 01:03:06,142
You had better

545
01:03:06,221 --> 01:03:08,821
Stop and think about it

546
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:10,661
Think

547
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,421
Let's boogie.

548
01:03:43,302 --> 01:03:45,141
Well, go ahead, damn it!

549
01:03:58,141 --> 01:03:59,662
Shit!

550
01:05:09,341 --> 01:05:11,060
Pardon me...

551
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,861
but we do have a strict policy
concerning handling the instruments:

552
01:05:13,941 --> 01:05:16,220
An employee
of Ray's Music Exchange...

553
01:05:16,301 --> 01:05:18,140
must be present.

554
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:19,820
Now, may I help you?

555
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:22,701
Ray, it's me. Joliet Jake.

556
01:05:22,781 --> 01:05:25,420
I once rented some column speakers
from you...

557
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:27,460
for my band-- The Blues Brothers.

558
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:30,060
Hey, Ray. It's me. Murph,
of Murph and the Magic Tones.

559
01:05:30,141 --> 01:05:31,781
Remember me?
I bought three Fender amps.

560
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:35,740
- Oh, we sell a lot of amplifiers.
- Not like these. They were beautiful.

561
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:39,221
- Upholstered with thick, red shag.
- Right!

562
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:42,860
I remember now.
I'll buy them all back for 350 apiece.

563
01:05:42,941 --> 01:05:44,380
Three fifty?

564
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,900
I paid 800 each
not six months ago.

565
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:49,540
You know-- depreciation, man.

566
01:05:49,621 --> 01:05:51,500
Ray, we're here to buy stuff.

567
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:54,661
We need pianos, amps, mikes--
the works.

568
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,261
Go on! Get!

569
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:05,821
Breaks my heart:
a boy that young going bad.

570
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,261
Tell me a little
about this electric piano.

571
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,260
You have a good eye, my man.

572
01:06:11,341 --> 01:06:13,300
That's the best
in the city of Chicago.

573
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,781
- How much?
- Two thousand bucks and it's yours.

574
01:06:15,861 --> 01:06:18,900
You can take it home with you.
I'll throw in the black keys for free.

575
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,380
Two thousand
for this chunk of shit?

576
01:06:22,459 --> 01:06:24,300
Come on, Ray!

577
01:06:26,381 --> 01:06:29,620
Really, Ray. It's used.
There's no action left in this keyboard.

578
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,980
Excuse me.

579
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,541
I don't think there's anything wrong
with the action on this piano.

580
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:51,260
Well, l heard about the fella
you've been dancing with

581
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:53,301
All over the neighbourhood

582
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,980
So why didn't you ask me, baby

583
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,740
Didn't you think I could

584
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:02,620
Well, I know that the bugaloo
is out of sight

585
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,259
But the shing-a-ling's
the thing tonight

586
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:08,020
But if that was you and me
out there, baby

587
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,499
I would have shown you
how to do it right

588
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:12,660
Do it right

589
01:07:24,339 --> 01:07:25,620
Twisting

590
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,620
Shake it, shake it, baby

591
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,620
Here we go loop-de-loop

592
01:07:33,659 --> 01:07:36,060
Shake it out, baby

593
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,420
Here we go loop-de-lai

594
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,380
Bend over
Let me see you shake your tail feather

595
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:47,699
Come on
Let me see you shake your tail feather

596
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,820
Come on
Come on, baby

597
01:08:03,139 --> 01:08:04,980
All right

598
01:08:05,059 --> 01:08:06,299
Do the twist

599
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,660
Do the fly

600
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,860
Do the swim

601
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:15,619
And do the bird

602
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:16,940
Do the duck

603
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:20,020
Do the monkey

604
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,059
Watusi

605
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:26,260
And what about the frug

606
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,900
Do the mashed potato

607
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,699
What about the bugaloo

608
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,859
Oh, the Bony Maronie

609
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:38,020
Come on, let's do the twist

610
01:08:42,299 --> 01:08:43,739
Twisting

611
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:46,139
Shake it, shake it, baby

612
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,420
Okay, man.

613
01:09:06,499 --> 01:09:08,339
We'll take these axes.

614
01:09:08,419 --> 01:09:11,940
Naturally. And as usual,
I gotta take an IOU.

615
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:48,139
You guys go inside.
Get yourselves a bite.

616
01:09:48,219 --> 01:09:50,219
I've got to make a phone call.

617
01:09:50,299 --> 01:09:53,299
Does this phone call
concern our first gig?

618
01:09:53,379 --> 01:09:55,700
Have I ever lied to you?

619
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:05,499
What are we gonna do, man?
We don't got no gig.

620
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:07,579
How much money you got?

621
01:10:07,659 --> 01:10:09,618
- I got a quarter.
- That's enough for a phone call.

622
01:10:09,699 --> 01:10:11,699
Come on.

623
01:10:19,659 --> 01:10:22,460
- What are you doing?
- You said we were gonna make a call.

624
01:10:22,539 --> 01:10:24,299
I said I was gonna make a call.

625
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,219
Who are you gonna call, Jake?

626
01:10:26,299 --> 01:10:28,019
Do you remember Maury Sline?

627
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,539
Sline? Booking agent?
What about him?

628
01:10:30,619 --> 01:10:33,499
He got us some good showcases
in the old days.

629
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:36,059
He got us the Morgan Park.
He got us the Ticktock.

630
01:10:36,139 --> 01:10:38,299
I got him laid.
He owes me.

631
01:10:39,299 --> 01:10:41,059
Give it a shot.

632
01:11:09,418 --> 01:11:12,459
There's got to be at least
seven dollars' worth of change here.

633
01:11:21,738 --> 01:11:23,099
Sir.

634
01:11:25,858 --> 01:11:27,900
- What did you find out?
- Okay.

635
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:30,938
I called a friend
at the Motor Vehicle Department.

636
01:11:31,019 --> 01:11:34,299
That license plate is like a rash
all over the computer.

637
01:11:34,378 --> 01:11:37,099
The car belongs
to a known traffic menace.

638
01:11:37,179 --> 01:11:39,738
- What's his name?
- His name is Elwood Blues.

639
01:11:39,819 --> 01:11:43,698
He's got a record a mile long.
And he's a Catholic.

640
01:11:44,978 --> 01:11:47,099
- Did you get his address?
- Of course.

641
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:48,739
1 060 West Addison.

642
01:11:50,498 --> 01:11:52,299
Let's go.

643
01:12:05,018 --> 01:12:07,939
Anybody with that kind of record
is gonna make a mistake.

644
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:12,018
I want all party members
in the tristate district...

645
01:12:12,098 --> 01:12:17,018
to monitor the city, county
and state police on their CBs.

646
01:12:17,098 --> 01:12:19,298
Mr Blues is gonna fuck up.

647
01:12:19,379 --> 01:12:21,779
And when he does...

648
01:12:21,858 --> 01:12:25,658
he better pray the police get to him
before we do.

649
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:37,139
We been in this car for three hours now.
Where is this place?

650
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:40,338
I told you it'd take
a little while to get there.

651
01:12:40,418 --> 01:12:45,738
- What's the name of the place?
- The name of the place is--

652
01:12:47,778 --> 01:12:49,178
Bob's Country Bunker.

653
01:12:49,257 --> 01:12:52,698
- Here we are.
- Bob's Country Bunker?

654
01:13:10,218 --> 01:13:12,618
The sign says, "Tonight only,
the Good Ole Boys."

655
01:13:12,699 --> 01:13:16,138
Blues Brothers! It should read,
"Tonight only...

656
01:13:16,219 --> 01:13:18,778
the Blues Brothers'
triumphant return."

657
01:13:18,858 --> 01:13:20,258
Must be some kind of mistake.

658
01:13:20,338 --> 01:13:22,178
You guys unload the stuff.

659
01:13:22,258 --> 01:13:24,858
Elwood, come with me.

660
01:13:45,858 --> 01:13:47,577
What can I get you boys?

661
01:13:47,658 --> 01:13:50,139
You thirsty, hungry
or just driving through?

662
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:52,858
Maybe you'd like a beer
or something a little harder?

663
01:13:52,938 --> 01:13:55,498
We happen to make
the state's best pepper steak.

664
01:13:55,578 --> 01:13:57,618
No, thank you, ma'am.

665
01:13:57,698 --> 01:14:00,217
We may be sucking back
a few beers later on.

666
01:14:00,297 --> 01:14:02,938
We'll be here all night.
You see, we're the band.

667
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:06,059
You are?
Gee, that's nice!

668
01:14:06,138 --> 01:14:08,257
Hey, Bob, this is the band!

669
01:14:08,338 --> 01:14:10,098
All right!

670
01:14:10,177 --> 01:14:13,179
What kind of music
do you usually have here?

671
01:14:13,258 --> 01:14:16,938
We got both kinds.
We got country and western.

672
01:14:20,258 --> 01:14:22,618
Jake, are you sure this is the place?

673
01:14:22,698 --> 01:14:25,177
Yeah, sure. This is the place.

674
01:14:30,217 --> 01:14:32,898
- Hi! You the Good Ole Boys?
- That's us!

675
01:14:32,978 --> 01:14:35,857
The rest of the band's
in the parking lot getting our stuff.

676
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:38,138
Well, I'm sure glad
to have you boys here.

677
01:14:38,218 --> 01:14:40,258
I'm Bob and this here is my place.

678
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:44,018
Well, it's a beautiful place, Bob!

679
01:14:44,097 --> 01:14:48,138
I guess you wanna get your steel guitars
and everything set up on stage.

680
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:51,178
Claire, get up and turn those stage
lights on and get these boys going.

681
01:14:57,578 --> 01:14:58,978
Chicken wire?

682
01:14:59,058 --> 01:15:01,178
What do you say
we have a sound check?

683
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,938
Excuse me, sonny. I'll give this
to you. You're the tallest one.

684
01:15:08,018 --> 01:15:10,297
Okay. What is it?

685
01:15:10,378 --> 01:15:12,578
That there is a list
of the songs...

686
01:15:12,657 --> 01:15:14,657
that you boys
will be playing tonight.

687
01:15:31,537 --> 01:15:35,137
I don't think we know
any of the songs on this list.

688
01:15:37,098 --> 01:15:39,778
This list doesn't mean anything.
They?re just requests.

689
01:15:39,858 --> 01:15:41,377
Do our regular set.
First tune.

690
01:15:41,457 --> 01:15:43,857
"Give Me Some Loving."
One, two--

691
01:15:43,938 --> 01:15:45,817
One, two, three, four.

692
01:16:00,177 --> 01:16:01,938
Shit!

693
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:04,257
What are those damn freak
pecker heads playing?

694
01:16:04,337 --> 01:16:08,297
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We're glad to be here tonight.

695
01:16:08,378 --> 01:16:13,017
We're the Good Old Blues Brothers
Boys Band from Chicago.

696
01:16:13,097 --> 01:16:16,137
We hope you'll like our show.
I'm Elwood. This is my brother Jake.

697
01:16:16,218 --> 01:16:19,778
Well, my temperature?s rising
And my feet on the floor

698
01:16:19,857 --> 01:16:22,778
Crazy people knockin '
'Cause they want some more

699
01:16:22,857 --> 01:16:25,297
Let me in, baby
I don't know what you got

700
01:16:26,577 --> 01:16:28,657
Better take it easy
'Cause this place is hot

701
01:16:28,737 --> 01:16:32,417
And I?m so glad we made it

702
01:16:32,497 --> 01:16:35,577
That ain't no Hank Williams song!

703
01:16:36,497 --> 01:16:38,497
Give me some loving

704
01:16:38,578 --> 01:16:40,458
Get off the stage!

705
01:16:42,138 --> 01:16:43,377
Everyday

706
01:16:44,577 --> 01:16:46,897
Why'd they turn off the lights?

707
01:16:46,976 --> 01:16:49,418
- Maybe they blew a fuse.
- I don't think so.

708
01:16:49,497 --> 01:16:51,338
Those lights are off on purpose.

709
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:54,338
We gotta figure out something
these people like, and fast!

710
01:16:54,417 --> 01:16:56,697
I got it. Remember the theme
from "Rawhide"?

711
01:16:56,777 --> 01:16:58,137
Old favourite. Rowdy Yates.

712
01:16:58,217 --> 01:17:00,937
- What key?
- "A." Good country key.

713
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:02,377
"Rawhide" in "A."

714
01:17:09,617 --> 01:17:12,217
Rollin ', rollin '

715
01:17:12,298 --> 01:17:14,177
Though the streams are swollen

716
01:17:14,257 --> 01:17:16,337
Keep them dogies rollin '

717
01:17:16,417 --> 01:17:17,977
Rawhide

718
01:17:18,936 --> 01:17:23,018
Through rain and wind and weather
Hell-bent for leather

719
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:28,017
Wishin' my gal was by my side

720
01:17:28,098 --> 01:17:29,977
All the things I'm missin '

721
01:17:30,057 --> 01:17:32,257
Good vittles, love and kissin '

722
01:17:32,337 --> 01:17:35,817
Are waiting at the end of my ride

723
01:17:36,897 --> 01:17:37,937
- Move 'em on
- Head 'em up

724
01:17:38,016 --> 01:17:39,217
- Head 'em out
- Move 'em on

725
01:17:39,297 --> 01:17:40,377
- Move 'em on
- Head 'em up

726
01:17:40,457 --> 01:17:41,897
Rawhide
Cut 'em out

727
01:17:41,976 --> 01:17:43,177
Ride 'em in

728
01:17:43,257 --> 01:17:44,537
Cut 'em out

729
01:17:44,617 --> 01:17:48,897
Ride 'em in, rawhide

730
01:18:40,977 --> 01:18:45,137
Theme from the TV show "Rawhide."
Thank you.

731
01:18:52,656 --> 01:18:55,697
We'd like to do a favourite of the horn
section. We hope it's one of yours.

732
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:05,057
Sometimes it?s hard
to be a woman

733
01:19:08,296 --> 01:19:10,897
Giving all your love

734
01:19:10,976 --> 01:19:14,176
To just one man

735
01:19:16,096 --> 01:19:19,136
And if you love him

736
01:19:20,097 --> 01:19:23,537
Oh, be proud of him

737
01:19:23,616 --> 01:19:26,536
'Cause after all

738
01:19:26,615 --> 01:19:29,296
He?s just a man

739
01:19:31,696 --> 01:19:35,216
Stand by your man

740
01:19:35,296 --> 01:19:39,095
Give him two arms to cling to

741
01:19:39,176 --> 01:19:43,616
And something warm to come to

742
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,856
When nights are cold and lonely

743
01:19:46,936 --> 01:19:49,736
Stand by your man

744
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:54,976
And tell the world you love him

745
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:59,976
Keep giving all the love you can

746
01:20:02,776 --> 01:20:07,536
Stand by your man

747
01:20:10,496 --> 01:20:12,695
Stand by your man

748
01:20:14,456 --> 01:20:17,935
And show the world you love him

749
01:20:18,016 --> 01:20:24,416
Keep giving all the love you can

750
01:20:24,496 --> 01:20:26,496
Baby

751
01:20:26,576 --> 01:20:28,896
Standby

752
01:20:28,977 --> 01:20:32,136
Your man

753
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:56,216
Well, folks, it's time
to call it a night.

754
01:20:56,296 --> 01:20:58,935
But do what you feel,
and keep both feet on the wheel.

755
01:20:59,016 --> 01:21:00,936
You don't have to go home
but you can't stay here.

756
01:21:01,016 --> 01:21:02,456
So, till next time.:

757
01:21:02,535 --> 01:21:03,576
- Move 'em on
- Head 'em up

758
01:21:03,656 --> 01:21:05,896
- Head 'em up
- Move 'em on

759
01:21:05,975 --> 01:21:07,056
Rawhide

760
01:21:07,136 --> 01:21:08,256
- Cut 'em out
- Ride 'em in

761
01:21:08,336 --> 01:21:09,535
- Ride 'em in
- Cut 'em out

762
01:21:10,376 --> 01:21:14,136
Ride 'em in, rawhide

763
01:21:17,496 --> 01:21:20,576
Let's get the hell out of here.

764
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:30,736
Shit, I wanna tell you, that's some
of the best god dam music we've had...

765
01:21:30,815 --> 01:21:32,936
at the Country Bunker
in a long time.

766
01:21:33,016 --> 01:21:37,055
Well, sorry we couldn't remember
"The Wreck of the Old 97."

767
01:21:37,136 --> 01:21:40,696
Why, hell! You guys can learn it
next time when you come back.

768
01:21:40,775 --> 01:21:43,896
Bob, about our money for tonight.

769
01:21:43,976 --> 01:21:46,535
That's right.

770
01:21:46,616 --> 01:21:48,575
Two hundred dollars...

771
01:21:48,655 --> 01:21:51,175
and you boys drank
$300 worth of beer.

772
01:21:51,256 --> 01:21:53,455
When we first came in...

773
01:21:53,535 --> 01:21:56,255
the bar lady never charged us
for the first round.

774
01:21:56,336 --> 01:22:00,216
So, like, we figured
beer was complimentary for the band.

775
01:22:03,496 --> 01:22:06,616
Well, I'll just go out
and take up a collection from the boys.

776
01:22:06,695 --> 01:22:09,215
I sure would appreciate it.

777
01:22:15,295 --> 01:22:17,416
I say this trip is nowhere, man.

778
01:22:17,496 --> 01:22:19,016
I say we gotta quit.

779
01:22:19,096 --> 01:22:22,015
What? Quit?

780
01:22:22,095 --> 01:22:24,256
I wish you guys
would make up your mind.

781
01:22:24,336 --> 01:22:27,776
Otherwise I gotta call Mr Ronzini at
the Holiday inn to get our old gig back.

782
01:22:27,856 --> 01:22:30,455
Back at the Armada Room?

783
01:22:30,536 --> 01:22:33,336
Listen, they want us
to pay for the beer we drank.

784
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:34,535
So you'd better split.

785
01:22:34,615 --> 01:22:38,375
The next gig is gonna be dynamite!

786
01:22:38,456 --> 01:22:40,776
Huge! You'll see.

787
01:22:44,455 --> 01:22:47,776
I say we give the Blues Brothers
just one more chance.

788
01:22:47,855 --> 01:22:50,335
Why not? If the shit fits, wear it!

789
01:22:50,855 --> 01:22:52,455
Scoot over, god dam it!

790
01:22:58,855 --> 01:23:00,695
Boys look a little upset.

791
01:23:01,896 --> 01:23:04,295
Hey, man. Don't worry.
We got a couple of days.

792
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:06,455
We'll get the Penguin's tax money.

793
01:23:06,535 --> 01:23:10,416
I mean, look. We got an appointment
to see Mr Sline tomorrow.

794
01:23:10,495 --> 01:23:12,336
Everything's gonna be all right.

795
01:23:12,415 --> 01:23:13,935
Let's skate.

796
01:23:15,656 --> 01:23:18,175
God dam it.

797
01:23:20,935 --> 01:23:22,855
Excuse me. Are you
the Good Ole Boys?

798
01:23:22,936 --> 01:23:25,895
That's right. I'm Tucker McElroy,
lead singer, driver of the Winnebago.

799
01:23:25,974 --> 01:23:28,416
I'd like to talk to you,
but we're running very late.

800
01:23:28,495 --> 01:23:32,575
I?m Jacob Stein, American Federation
of Musicians Union, Local 200.

801
01:23:32,655 --> 01:23:34,975
I've been sent here to see
if you?re carrying your permits.

802
01:23:35,054 --> 01:23:36,575
Our what?

803
01:23:36,654 --> 01:23:39,256
Your union cards.
May I see your cards, please?

804
01:23:40,695 --> 01:23:43,374
Suppose we ain't got no union cards,
and we go in and start playing anyway?

805
01:23:43,455 --> 01:23:46,495
What you gonna do about that?
You gonna stop us?

806
01:23:46,575 --> 01:23:48,655
Stein!

807
01:23:48,734 --> 01:23:52,415
You gonna look funny trying to eat
corn on the cob with no fucking teeth!

808
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:58,215
Listen, let me talk to Bob,
the owner.

809
01:23:58,296 --> 01:24:01,214
See if we can put your band
on contract waivers for tonight.

810
01:24:01,295 --> 01:24:03,855
I don't want you to move
from this spot.

811
01:24:03,936 --> 01:24:05,775
Just let me handle this.

812
01:24:09,055 --> 01:24:11,295
We'll talk to Bob.

813
01:24:15,214 --> 01:24:17,254
Get in the car and start her up.

814
01:24:20,775 --> 01:24:23,735
You know you boys owe me
a lot of money for that beer you drank!

815
01:24:23,815 --> 01:24:26,815
- God dam it!
- Bob, we loved playing here tonight.

816
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,494
My brother's writing out an
American Express traveller's check...

817
01:24:29,575 --> 01:24:31,294
to cover the bar tab.

818
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:33,054
I sure would appreciate it.

819
01:24:33,135 --> 01:24:36,494
I'd better check up, see how he's doing.
I have to sign it too.

820
01:24:36,575 --> 01:24:41,255
I usually sit in the car and write it
out on the glove compartment lid.

821
01:24:45,295 --> 01:24:46,975
Need a pencil.

822
01:24:57,375 --> 01:24:59,934
- Were them guys from the union?
- What the hell, "union"?

823
01:25:00,015 --> 01:25:03,134
Those boys skipped out of here
owing me a lot of money for beer.

824
01:25:03,214 --> 01:25:05,494
What the hell are you guys
all dressed up for?

825
01:25:05,574 --> 01:25:07,015
We're the Good Ole Boys!

826
01:25:07,094 --> 01:25:10,055
You're the Good Ole Boys?

827
01:25:28,174 --> 01:25:31,015
"A.F.M." Shit!

828
01:25:48,535 --> 01:25:51,494
Our Lady of Blessed Acceleration,
don't fail me now!

829
01:26:04,934 --> 01:26:07,935
I don't believe it!
It's that shit-box Dodge again.

830
01:26:08,015 --> 01:26:10,334
The bastards are ours now!

831
01:26:28,974 --> 01:26:31,934
Holy shit!

832
01:26:41,254 --> 01:26:44,334
Boys, you in big trouble.

833
01:26:47,534 --> 01:26:49,534
Maury, you owe me.

834
01:26:49,614 --> 01:26:52,334
We'll play anywhere, anytime,
for anybody.

835
01:26:52,414 --> 01:26:55,974
Put us in the Double Up Lounge, or
the Morgan Park Theatre, or the Crystal.

836
01:26:56,054 --> 01:26:58,374
We always knocked them dead
in those joints.

837
01:26:58,454 --> 01:27:01,854
Discos. They're all discos.

838
01:27:03,254 --> 01:27:06,374
Singles. Mixed singles.
Gay singles.

839
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:09,253
These people like to dance
with each other.

840
01:27:09,334 --> 01:27:11,134
We are a dance band.

841
01:27:11,213 --> 01:27:13,654
I don't know, boys.
I just don't know.

842
01:27:15,013 --> 01:27:16,693
Times have changed,
you know what I mean?

843
01:27:17,734 --> 01:27:19,654
What are you guys gonna do?
The same act?

844
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:21,494
You wear
the same farkakte suits.

845
01:27:21,574 --> 01:27:24,294
You'll scare people away.

846
01:27:24,374 --> 01:27:26,134
Don't you ever wear blue jeans
or jump suits...

847
01:27:26,214 --> 01:27:28,613
Like Wayne Cochran
and the C.C. Riders?

848
01:27:28,694 --> 01:27:30,214
You gotta come through for us.

849
01:27:31,294 --> 01:27:33,454
We need 5,000 bucks fast.

850
01:27:34,493 --> 01:27:36,375
Five thousand bucks?

851
01:27:36,454 --> 01:27:38,133
Who do you think you are?
The Beatles?

852
01:27:39,214 --> 01:27:42,254
You know the size hall you gotta work
to take in that kind of money?

853
01:27:42,334 --> 01:27:44,774
We'll fill any hall in the country.

854
01:27:46,573 --> 01:27:49,174
You guys familiar
with the Palace Hotel ballroom?

855
01:27:50,214 --> 01:27:53,414
- Never heard of it.
- Nice place up north.

856
01:27:53,494 --> 01:27:56,534
Built in the '40s
on Lake Wazapamani.

857
01:27:56,614 --> 01:27:58,373
That seats 5,000.

858
01:27:58,454 --> 01:28:00,774
You guys fill that place,
you can make 5,000 bucks, easy.

859
01:28:00,853 --> 01:28:04,453
- Book us for tomorrow night.
- Hold it! Tomorrow night?

860
01:28:04,533 --> 01:28:07,174
A gig like that, you gotta prepare
the proper exploitation.

861
01:28:07,254 --> 01:28:10,053
I know about that stuff.
I been exploited all my life.

862
01:28:10,134 --> 01:28:12,493
Forget it. There's no way
with you guys. Forget about it.

863
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:18,613
Say, how's Mrs Sline?

864
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:20,613
I might have some information
she'd like to know.

865
01:28:25,413 --> 01:28:27,213
You blackmailing me?

866
01:28:27,294 --> 01:28:30,854
If you wanna put it that way.
Maury, we need this gig!

867
01:28:30,933 --> 01:28:32,454
We're on a mission from God.

868
01:28:35,734 --> 01:28:38,614
Get us the hall, and I guarantee
we'll pack them in for miles around.

869
01:28:38,693 --> 01:28:40,374
What do you say?

870
01:28:42,094 --> 01:28:43,934
Okay. I'll get you the Palace Hotel.

871
01:28:45,293 --> 01:28:48,013
I'll print up show bills. I'll make
the place look real pretty, okay?

872
01:28:48,094 --> 01:28:51,893
I don't think you guys
are gonna gross dollar one.

873
01:28:53,253 --> 01:28:55,293
But if you do, I want a taste
of the gig, okay?

874
01:28:55,374 --> 01:28:56,973
Thanks, Maury.
Let's go, boys!

875
01:29:03,774 --> 01:29:08,333
Listen, you boys heard me talk
about Jake and Elwood.

876
01:29:08,413 --> 01:29:10,694
They used to live here,
just like you.

877
01:29:10,774 --> 01:29:13,173
And I used to sing to them,
just like with you.

878
01:29:13,253 --> 01:29:16,813
Tonight Jake and Elwood are going out
to sing and play...

879
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:18,853
to raise money
to help you children.

880
01:29:18,933 --> 01:29:20,773
Your lazy butts are in this too!

881
01:29:20,853 --> 01:29:22,773
So get up on that wagon.

882
01:29:22,853 --> 01:29:25,973
We're going up north
to put the word on the streets.

883
01:29:45,893 --> 01:29:49,813
Tonight only,
the fabulous Blues Brothers...

884
01:29:49,893 --> 01:29:52,493
Rhythm and Blues Revue...

885
01:29:52,573 --> 01:29:57,013
at the Palace Hotel ballroom,

886
01:29:57,093 --> 01:29:59,413
Lake Wazapamani.

887
01:29:59,493 --> 01:30:01,493
The fabulous Blues Brothers...

888
01:30:01,573 --> 01:30:03,974
Show Band and Revue.

889
01:30:08,053 --> 01:30:11,053
There you go, boy.

890
01:30:11,133 --> 01:30:13,213
All right, man!

891
01:30:13,293 --> 01:30:15,013
Check it out!

892
01:30:15,093 --> 01:30:17,293
- Tonight only!
- From Chicago!

893
01:30:17,373 --> 01:30:20,293
- The Blues Brothers.
- Rhythm and Blues Revue.

894
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:21,933
One night only!
The fabulous--

895
01:30:22,013 --> 01:30:24,653
Blues Brothers Show Band
and Revue.

896
01:30:29,213 --> 01:30:31,572
You! On the motorcycle!

897
01:30:31,653 --> 01:30:33,973
You two girls!

898
01:30:34,053 --> 01:30:36,693
- Tell your friends!
- Free parking.

899
01:30:38,413 --> 01:30:40,253
Two-dollar cover charge only, folks!

900
01:30:40,733 --> 01:30:43,453
- That?s a lot of entertainment.
- For two dollars.

901
01:30:44,933 --> 01:30:48,533
Will you please put this in the window,
'cause it's real important.

902
01:30:59,733 --> 01:31:02,773
Tonight only, from Chicago...

903
01:31:02,852 --> 01:31:06,053
the fabulous Blues Brothers...

904
01:31:06,133 --> 01:31:08,453
Rhythm and Blues Revue...

905
01:31:08,533 --> 01:31:10,893
for your dancing pleasure.

906
01:31:12,172 --> 01:31:15,173
And it's ladies? night tonight.

907
01:31:15,253 --> 01:31:17,093
at the Palace Hotel ballroom.

908
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:27,893
"Tonight only, the Blues Brothers...

909
01:31:27,972 --> 01:31:30,133
genuine Rhythm and Blues Show
and Revue.

910
01:31:30,212 --> 01:31:33,612
Palace Hotel ballroom.
Tonight only."

911
01:31:34,853 --> 01:31:36,452
How we doing?

912
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:42,092
So far we covered Lake, McHenry...

913
01:31:42,173 --> 01:31:43,892
and part of Du Page County.

914
01:31:43,973 --> 01:31:46,292
Good. Let's get to the gig.

915
01:31:48,613 --> 01:31:50,413
What is it?

916
01:31:50,493 --> 01:31:52,692
We're out of gas.

917
01:31:53,732 --> 01:31:56,372
Oh, shit.

918
01:32:18,252 --> 01:32:20,973
Wow! A classic. What a room!

919
01:32:21,052 --> 01:32:22,572
This place is gonna swing tonight.

920
01:32:22,653 --> 01:32:24,452
It's a fucking barn.
We'll never fill it.

921
01:32:24,533 --> 01:32:26,932
We've gotta fill this hall tonight.

922
01:32:27,012 --> 01:32:28,972
A lot of young children
are depending on it.

923
01:32:29,053 --> 01:32:31,293
Young children?
What do you mean?

924
01:32:31,372 --> 01:32:35,092
Jake and Elwood are donating
the band's share of the door money...

925
01:32:35,172 --> 01:32:37,612
to pay the taxes
on the St. Helen's orphanage...

926
01:32:37,692 --> 01:32:39,252
in Calumet City.

927
01:32:39,332 --> 01:32:40,732
What?

928
01:32:40,812 --> 01:32:44,972
- We're out of gas.
- Yep. Mind if we fill her up?

929
01:32:45,052 --> 01:32:47,893
Nope. I said "we're" out of gas.

930
01:32:47,972 --> 01:32:50,773
Tanker truck's late.
Should have been here two hours ago.

931
01:32:50,852 --> 01:32:53,852
It's always late on Thursdays.

932
01:32:53,933 --> 01:32:57,613
I guess we'll have to wait.

933
01:33:20,813 --> 01:33:22,652
Excuse me, sir.

934
01:33:24,493 --> 01:33:28,213
Yes, you. Could you fill it up
with premium, and check under the hood?

935
01:33:31,493 --> 01:33:33,332
Sure.

936
01:33:33,412 --> 01:33:36,331
You want I should wash
the dead bugs off the windshield?

937
01:33:37,452 --> 01:33:39,292
No. I'm in kind of a hurry.

938
01:33:49,012 --> 01:33:50,772
Where in the hell are they?

939
01:33:50,853 --> 01:33:55,212
So maybe you'd like to come by
and see the show.

940
01:33:55,292 --> 01:33:59,131
I'm awfully sorry, but I do have
a prior dinner engagement.

941
01:34:07,212 --> 01:34:08,852
Thanks, Marvin.

942
01:34:13,172 --> 01:34:15,331
Get me Troopers Daniel and Mount.

943
01:34:22,372 --> 01:34:24,052
I don't see those Blues Brothers.

944
01:34:24,932 --> 01:34:26,132
We'll wait.

945
01:34:28,292 --> 01:34:30,572
Okay, you're all set.

946
01:34:30,651 --> 01:34:34,612
That'll be $94.

947
01:34:37,132 --> 01:34:38,733
Here's 95.
Thank you.

948
01:34:38,812 --> 01:34:41,891
Okay. And that's a dollar change.

949
01:34:41,971 --> 01:34:45,452
- Oh, keep the change.
- Thanks.

950
01:34:47,212 --> 01:34:50,492
So, look. If your date...

951
01:34:50,571 --> 01:34:52,972
don't work out tonight
for any reason...

952
01:34:53,052 --> 01:34:57,172
there's a motel
up on the interstate.

953
01:34:57,251 --> 01:35:01,011
Maybe we could, say, meet...

954
01:35:01,091 --> 01:35:03,732
around midnight?

955
01:35:05,091 --> 01:35:07,092
I'll think about it, Elwood, okay?

956
01:35:09,211 --> 01:35:10,812
Bye.

957
01:35:24,331 --> 01:35:26,131
Son of a bitch!

958
01:35:27,252 --> 01:35:29,091
Come on!

959
01:36:01,051 --> 01:36:03,251
We're really late.
You'd better step on it.

960
01:36:12,011 --> 01:36:14,971
I always like to perform
for angry mobs.

961
01:36:15,051 --> 01:36:16,531
You can't quit now.

962
01:36:16,612 --> 01:36:18,051
What can they be doing?

963
01:36:35,171 --> 01:36:37,011
My head hurts.

964
01:36:38,052 --> 01:36:39,731
That Night Train's a mean wine.

965
01:36:39,811 --> 01:36:41,651
You'd better get bright!
We got a show to do.

966
01:36:41,731 --> 01:36:44,051
Then we gotta figure out
some way to collect that gate money...

967
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:48,172
get it to the County Assessor's office
as soon as they open in the morning.

968
01:36:56,131 --> 01:36:57,971
We want the show!

969
01:37:07,891 --> 01:37:10,371
Gentlemen, I'm leaving.

970
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:12,691
Man, we were so close.

971
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:14,771
Hey, you guys know
"Minnie The Moocher"?

972
01:37:14,851 --> 01:37:17,091
I knew a hooker once
named Minnie Mazola.

973
01:37:17,171 --> 01:37:19,530
No! The song "Minnie the Moocher."

974
01:37:19,611 --> 01:37:21,932
- Yeah. So what?
- Hit it!

975
01:37:50,651 --> 01:37:56,451
Hey, folks, here?s a story
'bout Minnie the Moocher

976
01:37:56,530 --> 01:38:01,171
She was a low-down hoochie coocher

977
01:38:01,251 --> 01:38:05,011
She was the roughest, toughest frail

978
01:38:05,091 --> 01:38:07,650
But Minnie had a heart

979
01:38:07,730 --> 01:38:09,570
As big as a whale

980
01:38:29,171 --> 01:38:33,770
She messed around
with a bloke named Smokey

981
01:38:33,850 --> 01:38:37,371
She loved him
though he was cokey

982
01:38:38,611 --> 01:38:41,530
He took her down to Chinatown

983
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:46,770
And he showed her how
to kick the gong around

984
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:30,011
She had a dream
about the King of Sweden

985
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:34,890
He gave her things
that she was needin '

986
01:39:34,971 --> 01:39:39,530
He gave her a home
built of gold and steel

987
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:43,970
A diamond car
with the platinum wheels

988
01:40:40,010 --> 01:40:42,850
This is glue. Strong stuff.

989
01:40:49,930 --> 01:40:51,730
What the hell are you doing?

990
01:40:51,810 --> 01:40:54,009
This can is from
a surplus disposal run.

991
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:56,970
Fifteen overcharged ounces
of pure, uncompounded...

992
01:40:57,050 --> 01:40:59,730
isopropyl butane monosulfate.

993
01:40:59,809 --> 01:41:02,010
When combined with oxygen
and a little heat...

994
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:04,250
it will cause a rapid expansion.

995
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:33,569
Poor Min, poor Min

996
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:17,329
- Let's take them!
- Wait a minute.

997
01:42:17,409 --> 01:42:21,089
I've never even heard
these boys sing, all right?

998
01:42:21,169 --> 01:42:22,929
All right.

999
01:42:23,009 --> 01:42:25,130
They're not going no place.

1000
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:27,849
All right, cover all exits! Let's go!
Come on! Hurry up!

1001
01:42:30,729 --> 01:42:33,249
Move it!

1002
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:54,089
Who wants an Orange Whip?
Orange Whip?

1003
01:42:55,969 --> 01:42:57,850
Three Orange Whips.

1004
01:43:15,809 --> 01:43:18,048
Excuse us.

1005
01:43:18,129 --> 01:43:20,210
Good evening, ladies.

1006
01:43:55,169 --> 01:43:57,609
One, two,
one, two, three, four.

1007
01:44:19,969 --> 01:44:23,648
Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the
distinct pleasure of the management...

1008
01:44:23,728 --> 01:44:27,649
to present to you
the evening's star attraction.

1009
01:44:27,729 --> 01:44:31,968
Here they are, back after
their exclusive three-year tour...

1010
01:44:32,049 --> 01:44:35,968
of Europe, Scandinavia
and the subcontinent.

1011
01:44:36,049 --> 01:44:39,648
Won't you welcome
from Calumet City, Illinois...

1012
01:44:39,728 --> 01:44:44,888
the show band
of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues.

1013
01:44:44,969 --> 01:44:47,409
The Blues Brothers!

1014
01:45:22,689 --> 01:45:25,048
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

1015
01:45:34,928 --> 01:45:37,608
We're so glad to see
so many lovely people here tonight.

1016
01:45:37,688 --> 01:45:40,249
We'd like to welcome
all the representatives...

1017
01:45:40,329 --> 01:45:42,009
of Illinois' law enforcement
community...

1018
01:45:42,089 --> 01:45:45,529
who have chosen to join us in
the Palace Hotel ballroom at this time.

1019
01:45:45,609 --> 01:45:47,769
We certainly hope you all
enjoy the show.

1020
01:45:47,848 --> 01:45:49,849
And remember that
no matter who you are...

1021
01:45:49,928 --> 01:45:52,248
and what you do
to live and survive...

1022
01:45:52,328 --> 01:45:55,128
there's still some things
that make us all the same.

1023
01:45:55,209 --> 01:45:59,008
You. Me. Them. Everybody.

1024
01:46:00,568 --> 01:46:02,808
Everybody

1025
01:46:02,888 --> 01:46:05,209
Needs somebody

1026
01:46:05,289 --> 01:46:07,608
Everybody

1027
01:46:07,689 --> 01:46:11,208
Needs somebody to love

1028
01:46:11,288 --> 01:46:12,968
Someone to love

1029
01:46:14,249 --> 01:46:16,648
Sweetheart to miss

1030
01:46:16,728 --> 01:46:19,128
Sugar to kiss

1031
01:46:19,209 --> 01:46:21,249
I need you, you, you

1032
01:46:26,168 --> 01:46:28,288
In the morning

1033
01:46:28,369 --> 01:46:30,729
When my soul?s on fire

1034
01:46:32,408 --> 01:46:33,928
Sometimes feel

1035
01:46:34,009 --> 01:46:36,928
I feel a little sad inside

1036
01:46:37,009 --> 01:46:40,288
When my baby mistreats me
I never, never

1037
01:46:40,367 --> 01:46:41,848
Find a place to hide
I need you

1038
01:47:00,528 --> 01:47:03,328
Sometimes feel

1039
01:47:03,407 --> 01:47:05,409
I feel a little sad inside

1040
01:47:05,488 --> 01:47:07,648
When my baby mistreats me

1041
01:47:07,728 --> 01:47:11,688
I never, never find a place to hide
I need you

1042
01:47:19,848 --> 01:47:22,248
People, when you do find
that special somebody...

1043
01:47:22,327 --> 01:47:24,407
you gotta hold that man,
hold that woman...

1044
01:47:24,488 --> 01:47:26,008
Love him, please him,
squeeze her, please her!

1045
01:47:26,088 --> 01:47:28,328
Signify your feelings
with every caress.

1046
01:47:28,408 --> 01:47:30,568
Because it's so important
to have that special somebody...

1047
01:47:30,648 --> 01:47:32,808
to hold, kiss, miss...

1048
01:47:32,887 --> 01:47:34,527
to squeeze and please!

1049
01:47:34,608 --> 01:47:38,728
Everybody needs somebody

1050
01:47:38,807 --> 01:47:41,128
Everybody

1051
01:47:41,208 --> 01:47:43,928
Needs somebody to love

1052
01:47:45,008 --> 01:47:46,328
Someone to love

1053
01:47:47,447 --> 01:47:49,729
Sweetheart to miss

1054
01:47:49,808 --> 01:47:51,928
Sugar to kiss

1055
01:47:52,008 --> 01:47:54,167
I need you, you

1056
01:48:01,528 --> 01:48:03,527
In the morning

1057
01:48:03,607 --> 01:48:05,607
When my soul?s on fire

1058
01:48:06,888 --> 01:48:10,408
When there ain 't no one around
I need you

1059
01:48:40,927 --> 01:48:43,247
Thank you.
That was for Wilson Pickett.

1060
01:48:46,608 --> 01:48:49,047
This is dedicated
to the late, great Magic Sam.

1061
01:48:49,128 --> 01:48:52,767
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

1062
01:48:59,808 --> 01:49:04,127
Come on
Baby, don?t you wanna go

1063
01:49:14,247 --> 01:49:16,928
Back to that same old place

1064
01:49:17,007 --> 01:49:19,207
Sweet home Chicago

1065
01:49:22,448 --> 01:49:24,287
Six and three is nine

1066
01:49:24,368 --> 01:49:26,047
Nine and nine is eighteen

1067
01:49:26,128 --> 01:49:29,248
Look there, brother, baby
and see what I see

1068
01:50:32,446 --> 01:50:34,407
- The Mafia's after us now.
- You guys were hot!

1069
01:50:34,486 --> 01:50:37,487
You were great!
I've got to record you.

1070
01:50:37,567 --> 01:50:40,487
- Bullshit.
- I don't bullshit.

1071
01:50:40,567 --> 01:50:42,327
I'm president of Clarion Records...

1072
01:50:42,407 --> 01:50:44,607
the largest recording company
on the eastern seaboard.

1073
01:50:44,687 --> 01:50:47,088
- So what?
- Here's $1 0,000.

1074
01:50:47,167 --> 01:50:50,047
An advance on your first
recording session.

1075
01:50:52,326 --> 01:50:53,406
Is it a deal?

1076
01:50:54,447 --> 01:50:56,607
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal.

1077
01:50:56,687 --> 01:50:59,527
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal!

1078
01:50:59,607 --> 01:51:02,287
Listen, all these cops out here--
they're waiting for us.

1079
01:51:02,366 --> 01:51:05,567
We gotta get out with nobody
seeing us. You know a back door out?

1080
01:51:05,647 --> 01:51:08,607
Sure. I used to be head bouncer here
back in the '70s.

1081
01:51:08,687 --> 01:51:12,327
There's an electrical service duct
behind your drummer's riser.

1082
01:51:12,407 --> 01:51:14,327
Do us a favour.

1083
01:51:14,406 --> 01:51:17,447
Take $1 ,400 and give it
to Ray's Music Exchange...

1084
01:51:17,527 --> 01:51:20,247
in Calumet City,
and give the rest to the band.

1085
01:51:20,326 --> 01:51:21,927
- You got it.
- Thanks.

1086
01:51:22,006 --> 01:51:23,807
Bye.

1087
01:51:40,527 --> 01:51:43,366
Me and Elwood are gonna make a break
for it. You and the band keep playing.

1088
01:52:00,047 --> 01:52:03,527
- Something's wrong.
- Where?s Jake?

1089
01:52:06,967 --> 01:52:08,526
Where'd they go?

1090
01:52:21,167 --> 01:52:23,487
I sure hope this thing
leads someplace.

1091
01:52:23,566 --> 01:52:26,126
Elwood, we're gone, man.

1092
01:52:34,126 --> 01:52:36,606
Who is that girl?

1093
01:52:36,686 --> 01:52:38,886
Well, Jake.

1094
01:52:38,967 --> 01:52:41,726
You look just fine down there...

1095
01:52:41,806 --> 01:52:43,886
slithering in the mud
like vermin.

1096
01:52:43,965 --> 01:52:45,806
No problem.

1097
01:52:46,846 --> 01:52:48,926
You're not gonna get away from me
this time.

1098
01:52:54,126 --> 01:52:55,566
Check that out! Let's go!

1099
01:53:14,407 --> 01:53:17,006
It's good to see you,
sweetheart!

1100
01:53:18,046 --> 01:53:19,966
You contemptible pig.

1101
01:53:21,647 --> 01:53:24,845
I remained celibate for you.

1102
01:53:24,927 --> 01:53:27,606
I stood at the back
of a cathedral...

1103
01:53:27,686 --> 01:53:30,085
waiting, in celibacy, for you...

1104
01:53:30,166 --> 01:53:33,645
with 300 friends and relatives
in attendance.

1105
01:53:33,726 --> 01:53:36,846
My uncle hired the best
Rumanian caterers in the state.

1106
01:53:36,925 --> 01:53:39,246
To obtain the seven limousines...

1107
01:53:39,327 --> 01:53:42,486
my father used up his last favours
with Mad Pete Trullo.

1108
01:53:43,486 --> 01:53:46,286
So for me, for my mother...

1109
01:53:46,367 --> 01:53:50,246
my grandmother, my father,
my uncle and for the common good...

1110
01:53:50,326 --> 01:53:53,566
I must now kill you
and your brother.

1111
01:54:06,526 --> 01:54:09,446
Oh, please don't kill us!

1112
01:54:11,167 --> 01:54:14,926
You know I love you, baby! I wouldn't
leave you! It wasn't my fault!

1113
01:54:15,006 --> 01:54:16,806
You miserable slug!

1114
01:54:16,886 --> 01:54:20,206
You think you can talk your way
out of this? You betrayed me!

1115
01:54:20,286 --> 01:54:23,086
No, I didn't. Honest!

1116
01:54:23,165 --> 01:54:25,006
I ran out of gas!

1117
01:54:25,085 --> 01:54:28,085
I had a flat tyre!
I didn't have money for cab fare!

1118
01:54:28,166 --> 01:54:30,125
My tux didn't come back
from the cleaners.

1119
01:54:30,206 --> 01:54:31,965
And old friend came in
from out of town!

1120
01:54:32,045 --> 01:54:36,286
Someone stole my car! There was
an earthquake! A terrible flood!

1121
01:54:36,366 --> 01:54:41,165
Locusts! It wasn't my fault,
I swear to God!

1122
01:55:02,886 --> 01:55:04,766
Jake, honey.

1123
01:55:17,166 --> 01:55:19,086
Let's go.

1124
01:55:21,805 --> 01:55:23,605
Take it easy.

1125
01:55:38,445 --> 01:55:40,405
You're now going to
totally demolish that car.

1126
01:55:43,365 --> 01:55:47,365
You want to maybe consider
going after the Blues Brothers?

1127
01:55:57,245 --> 01:55:59,486
It's 1 06 miles to Chicago.

1128
01:55:59,565 --> 01:56:02,285
We got a full tank of gas,
half a pack of cigarettes...

1129
01:56:02,365 --> 01:56:05,006
it's dark
and we're wearing sunglasses.

1130
01:56:05,085 --> 01:56:05,965
Hit it.

1131
01:56:48,205 --> 01:56:51,645
Shit, man. Can't this damn thing
go any faster than this?

1132
01:56:51,725 --> 01:56:53,965
Bob, I think I've got
a little problem.

1133
01:56:56,525 --> 01:56:58,365
God dam, boy.

1134
01:57:21,325 --> 01:57:22,685
Shit.

1135
01:57:48,525 --> 01:57:51,805
Don't you say a fuckin' word.

1136
01:58:28,245 --> 01:58:31,564
All units, we have a ten-seven-niner.

1137
01:58:31,644 --> 01:58:33,165
Officers are in pursuit:

1138
01:58:33,244 --> 01:58:36,604
a black-and-white
1 974 Dodge sedan...

1139
01:58:36,684 --> 01:58:38,524
southbound on 47.

1140
01:58:38,604 --> 01:58:41,925
Respond to signal, ten-seven-niner.

1141
01:58:42,004 --> 01:58:45,085
Occupants of vehicle.:
one Joliet Jake Blues...

1142
01:58:45,164 --> 01:58:47,164
one Elwood Blues.

1143
01:58:47,244 --> 01:58:49,364
- Considered extremely dangerous.
- Gruppenfuehrer!

1144
01:59:01,324 --> 01:59:04,405
Jake, I gotta pull over.

1145
01:59:12,885 --> 01:59:15,324
Southbound on State Highway 47.

1146
01:59:39,884 --> 01:59:42,724
Hi! Wanna hand me the mike?

1147
01:59:42,805 --> 01:59:44,765
Thanks a lot.

1148
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:48,165
This is car--
What number are we?

1149
01:59:48,244 --> 01:59:49,804
Five-five.

1150
01:59:49,884 --> 01:59:53,444
Car 55. We're in a truck.

1151
02:00:00,404 --> 02:00:03,164
Signal ten-seven-niner
still engaged.

1152
02:00:03,244 --> 02:00:06,764
Vehicle travelling southbound
approaching Chicago city limits.

1153
02:00:06,844 --> 02:00:09,684
Commander advises will contact
Chicago precincts...

1154
02:00:09,764 --> 02:00:11,284
for a local intercept.

1155
02:00:11,365 --> 02:00:12,724
Maintain pursuit.

1156
02:00:19,324 --> 02:00:21,283
Use of unnecessary violence...

1157
02:00:21,364 --> 02:00:25,044
in the apprehension
of the Blues Brothers has been approved.

1158
02:00:52,084 --> 02:00:55,283
Well, this is definitely
Lower Wacker Drive.

1159
02:00:55,364 --> 02:00:58,044
If my estimations are correct...

1160
02:00:58,124 --> 02:01:02,483
we should be very close to
the Honourable Richard J. Daley Plaza.

1161
02:01:02,564 --> 02:01:05,124
- That's where they got that Picasso.
- Yep.

1162
02:03:32,083 --> 02:03:33,964
Son of a bitch!

1163
02:03:40,403 --> 02:03:42,563
There they are.

1164
02:04:21,243 --> 02:04:23,043
- Oh, no!
- What the fuck was that?

1165
02:04:23,123 --> 02:04:25,483
The motor. It's thrown a rod.

1166
02:04:25,562 --> 02:04:28,242
- Is that serious?
- Yep.

1167
02:04:55,363 --> 02:04:57,043
Faster.

1168
02:05:47,882 --> 02:05:49,002
Holy shit!

1169
02:06:09,322 --> 02:06:10,682
I've always loved you.

1170
02:06:22,682 --> 02:06:23,682
There it is!

1171
02:07:06,602 --> 02:07:08,203
Come on!

1172
02:07:47,881 --> 02:07:51,841
Sir, where's the office
of the assessor of Cook County?

1173
02:07:51,922 --> 02:07:54,082
Down the hall. Turn right.

1174
02:07:54,163 --> 02:07:55,721
Take the elevator to 1102.

1175
02:07:55,802 --> 02:07:57,481
Thank you, sir.

1176
02:10:11,241 --> 02:10:13,321
Excuse me.
Did you see two guys...

1177
02:10:13,401 --> 02:10:15,401
with black suits and hats,
one carrying a briefcase?

1178
02:10:15,481 --> 02:10:17,360
Yeah. I just sent them down there.

1179
02:10:17,441 --> 02:10:19,281
Thank you.

1180
02:10:37,401 --> 02:10:39,241
Hold the door.

1181
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:08,881
Let's go.

1182
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:16,520
Can I help you?

1183
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:22,281
- This is where they pay taxes, right?
- Right.

1184
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:24,041
This money is for
the year's assessment...

1185
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:27,119
on the St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud
Orphanage in Calumet City, Illinois.

1186
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:29,480
Five thousand bucks.
It's all there, pal.
