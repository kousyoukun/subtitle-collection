YOU TAUGHT ME HOW TO DO THIS.

359
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,362
YES, I DID.

360
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:51,097
ABOUT A YEAR
AND A HALF AGO...

361
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:52,099
RIGHT.

362
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:53,533
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO,

363
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,501
WILDER WAS MANAGING
THIS MEDICAL PAVILION.

364
00:33:55,502 --> 00:33:59,506
IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD JOB, TOO.
I MEAN, GOOD BENEFITS,
NICE PEOPLE.

365
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:02,409
FOR HIM, IT WAS
A GREAT JOB AND HE KNEW IT.

366
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:04,777
AND EVERYBODY
REALLY LIKED HIM.

367
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:07,279
IT WAS WINTER AT THE TIME,
AND HE'D HAVE TO WAKE UP

368
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,051
REALLY EARLY ON SNOWY DAYS
TO GO OUT AND SHOVEL
ALL THE SIDEWALKS.

369
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:13,085
AND I WAS ALWAYS
GETTING ON HIS CASE,

370
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:16,089
YOU KNOW,
ABOUT USING HIS STUFF

371
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:17,890
TO CLEAR THE SIDEWALKS.

372
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,427
'CAUSE IT WOULD
ONLY TAKE A MINUTE
TO MELT ALL THAT SNOW.

373
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,630
AND IT WAS 5 IN THE MORNING,
SO IT WASN'T LIKE ANYONE WAS
GONNA SEE OR ANYTHING.

374
00:34:24,631 --> 00:34:27,800
THAT WAY, I FIGURED
IF HE USED
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT VOODOO,

375
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:30,603
HE COULD RUSH
RIGHT BACK HOME AND SEE ME.

376
00:34:30,637 --> 00:34:32,704
BUT ANYWAY,
HE WOULDN'T GO FOR IT.

377
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:36,209
IT WAS A SATURDAY,
SO I WAS OFF WORK
AND I WAS HELPING HIM.

378
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:37,877
IT WAS REALLY ICY.

379
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:40,113
AND HE'S OUT
FRONT SHOVELIN' AWAY

380
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:41,981
LIKE CRAZY,
AND I'M IN THE BACK.

381
00:34:41,982 --> 00:34:44,984
AND I REMEMBER STANDIN' THERE,
HOLDIN' THIS SNOW SHOVEL,

382
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:47,254
LOOKIN' AT THESE
2 SIDEWALKS

383
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:51,090
COVERED WITH ABOUT
AN INCH OF SOLID ICE.

384
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,892
I MEAN, NO WAY.

385
00:34:52,893 --> 00:34:55,228
SO, I GO OVER TO TOOL SHED,

386
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,429
I GET A BIG CAN OF GASOLINE,

387
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,900
AND VERY NEATLY,
I POUR IT DOWN THE LENGTHS
OF THESE 2 SIDEWALKS.

388
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:03,770
I STRIKE A MATCH,
AND I LIGHT UP
THE FIRST SIDEWALK.

389
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:05,973
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
IT WORKED GREAT.

390
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:08,174
I MEAN,
GAS DOESN'T MIX WITH WATER,

391
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:10,978
IT JUST BURNS ON
THE TOP AND MELTS ALL THE ICE.

392
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:17,484
THEN I SORT OF NOTICE
THAT THE FIRE'S
STARTING TO MOVE.

393
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:19,952
ALL THAT ICE
HAD TURNED TO WATER.

394
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:22,354
AND THE SIDEWALKS
WERE SORT OF ON AN INCLINE,

395
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:24,023
SO ALL THIS FLAMING WATER

396
00:35:24,024 --> 00:35:26,626
IS NOW MOVING SLOWLY DOWNHILL

397
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:28,996
ONTO THE STEPS OF
THIS DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

398
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:33,466
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,

399
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,036
ON THE DOOR OF
THIS DOCTOR'S OFFICE
IS LIKE A PET FLAP.

400
00:35:37,037 --> 00:35:39,506
ONLY, IT'S NOT A PET FLAP.
IT'S NOT A PET FLAP.

401
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:41,673
IT'S A LITTLE DROP-OFF DOOR,

402
00:35:41,674 --> 00:35:44,511
WHERE THEY DROP OFF
STOOL AND URINE SAMPLES.

403
00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:46,378
BUT ALL I KNOW
IS THIS FLAMING WATER

404
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:50,050
IS POURING THROUGH
THE STOOL-SAMPLE DOOR
OF THIS DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

405

407
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:00,327
WILDER LOST HIS JOB.

408
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:04,998
HE NEVER
YELLED AT ME THOUGH.

409
00:36:11,138 --> 00:36:13,340
THAT'S WHEN
THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

410
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:16,408
GAVE ME THIS
2-POUND FASHION STATEMENT
TO WEAR.

411
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:17,910
BUT IT COMES OFF TOMORROW.

412

OUR WEDDING PICTURE?

415
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:31,857
YEAH, IT FIGURES.

416
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:33,693

OF YOUR HOUSE ARREST?

HE DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU ROLLED INTO TOWN.

WILDER'S A SCHMUCK.

422
00:36:44,938 --> 00:36:48,040
HE HATES ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE HATES ME.
WHY DOES HE HATE ME?

423
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:51,878
WHY DON'T YOU START
WITH BURNIN' OFF HIS HAIR
AT HIS DAMN BACHELOR PARTY?

424
