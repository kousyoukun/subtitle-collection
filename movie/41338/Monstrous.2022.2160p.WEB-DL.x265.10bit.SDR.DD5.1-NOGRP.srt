There's a monster outside my window.

153
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:05,823
亲爱的
No, honey.

154
00:13:05,923 --> 00:13:06,967
你只是做噩梦了
You're just having a bad dream.

155
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,793
不是 你看！
No, look, look, look, look!

156
00:13:09,893 --> 00:13:10,995
好好好
Okay, okay.

157
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:12,596
我看看
Let's see.

158
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:14,932
没有 没有怪物
No, no monsters out here.

159
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:16,667
不过起风暴了
There was a storm out there, though.

160
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,937
可能是这个声音吓到你了吧？
So maybe that's what scared you, huh?

161
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:24,641
我理解 我也做噩梦了
I know, I was having a bad dream too.

162
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:27,111
梦里也有怪物吗？
Was there a monster in it?

163
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:30,180
对 而且非常可怕
Yes, and it was very scary.

164
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:34,585
但我知道我们两个
But I know that you and I

165
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:36,620
绝对安全
are completely safe,

166
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:38,989
就像窝在毯子里的两只小虫子
like two bugs, snug in a rug.

167
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:42,126
好吗？
Okay?

168
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:44,762
睡吧 宝贝
Get some rest, babe.

169
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:46,663
明天还要上学呢
You got school tomorrow.

170
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,466
我不想上学
I don't want to go to school.

171
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,167
但是你必须去
Well, you have to,

172
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:52,504
这是妈妈说的
Mommy says.

173
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:54,472
来吧 躺下
Come on, lie down.

174
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:55,806
躺下
Lay down.

175
00:13:55,873 --> 00:13:57,941
睡吧
Get some sleep.

176
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,047
妈妈
Mom,

177
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:07,485
能别关门吗？
can you leave the door open?

178
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:10,288
当然了
Of course.

179
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,303
韦弗医生办公室 请问有什么可以帮您的？
Dr. Weaver's office. How may I help you?

180
00:14:25,336 --> 00:14:27,372
能让韦弗医生接电话吗？
May I speak to Dr. Weaver please?

181
00:14:27,472 --> 00:14:29,807
对不起 女士 这只是他的电话应答服务
I'm sorry, ma'am, this is just his answering service.

182
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,477
您想给他留言吗？
Would you like to leave a message?

183
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,846
不用了 谢谢
No, thank you.

184
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:49,593

? I don't want to set the world ?

185
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:51,028
科迪 快点
Cody, hurry up.

186
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:53,364
第一天上学可不能迟到
You don't want to be late your first day.

187
00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:00,538

? I just want to start ?

188
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:04,074

? A flame in your heart ?

189
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:10,548
好了 上学第一天
Okay, first day of school.

190
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:12,550
有个小窍门
Here's a little tool.

191
00:15:12,584 --> 00:15:14,685
牢记黄金法则
Practice the golden rule

192
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,887
你就能变酷
and you will be Mr. Cool.

193
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,556
我爱你
I love you.

194
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,757
祝你过得愉快
Have a great day, okay?

195
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:25,463

? No other... ?

196
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:39,810

? I lost all ambition ?

197
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,112

? For worldly acclaim ?

198
00:15:42,213 --> 00:15:47,418

? I just want to be the one you love ?

199
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:50,821

? And with your admission ?

200
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:53,491

? That you feel the same ?

201
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:57,595

? I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of ?

202
00:15:57,629 --> 00:15:59,297

? Believe me ?

203
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:06,103

? I don't want to set the world on fire ?

204
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,944

? I just want to start ?

205
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:17,448

? A flame in your heart ?

206
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:34,865
这是你的办公桌
This is your desk.

207
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:36,467
放轻松点
Make yourself comfortable.

208
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:40,771
我去拿些材料 然后就可以开始了
I'll go get some materials and be back and get started.

209
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:42,473
好的 谢谢
Okay, thank you.

210
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:45,476

我是劳拉
I'm Laura.

213
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:49,146
简
Jane.

214
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,881
很高兴认识你 简
It's very nice to meet you, Jane.

215
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:52,716
你这身衣服是从哪来的？
Where'd you get that dress?

216
00:16:52,816 --> 00:16:54,017
这个？
Oh, this?

217
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:55,953
我...
I...

218
00:16:56,554 --> 00:16:58,021
我是简
This is Jane.

219
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,857
好的 先生 马上
Yes, sir. Right away.

220
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:25,683
嘿 第一天过得怎么样？
Hey, how was your first day?

221
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:27,685
还行
It was okay.

222
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,387
有没有交到新朋友？
Did you make any new friends?

223
00:17:31,356 --> 00:17:32,323
没有
No.

224
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:35,360
肯定很快就能交到的
Well, I'm sure you will in no time.

225
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,829
我们回家
All right, here we go home.

226
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,285
我新工作的第一天很愉快
Well, I had a great first day at work.

227
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:02,720
那里的女士们都很好
The ladies, they're so nice,

228
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:05,789
凯西和…呃…
Kathy and, um...

229
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,292
苏珊
Susan.

230
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:10,395
我跟她们相处得都特别愉快
Well, I just got such a tickle out of all of them.

231
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,298
科迪 快吃呀
Cody, eat your dinner.

232
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:15,733
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

233
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,801
那就少吃一点
Well, try to eat a little.

234
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:37,988
巨魔是最大公山羊的两倍大
The troll was twice as big as the biggest Billy goat gruff,

235
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:39,990
但是公山羊并不害怕
but the Billy goat was not afraid.

236
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,227
他低下头 把角对准巨魔冲了过去
He lowered his horns and ran at the troll,

237
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,763
把他推下桥
pushing him over the bridge.

238
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:47,732
巨魔愤怒地尖叫着
The troll screamed with fury

239
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:49,434
他掉进了河里
as he fell into the water

240
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:51,636
被水流冲走了
and was swept away by the current.

241
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:55,072
然后 最大的公山羊
Then, the biggest Billy goat gruff

242
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:56,940
回到草地上跟家人团聚了
joined his family in the meadow

243
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:58,975
并且告诉他们
and told them they never to worry

244
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:01,312
以后过桥再也不用担心了
about crossing the bridge again.

245
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:02,447
结束了
The end.

246
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:04,449
再读一个故事
Read another one.

247
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:05,616
不行
Sorry.

248
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,983
时间到了
The time has come

249
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:09,654
小男孩该数羊睡觉了
for counting sheep for little boys who need their sleep.

250
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:13,189
躺下吧
Now lie down.

251
00:19:13,257 --> 00:19:14,792
明天还要上学
You've got school tomorrow.

252
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,993
睡觉吧
Got to get some rest.

253
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:19,297
晚安 可爱的小王子
Goodnight, sweet prince.

254
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:28,806
别关门 好吗？
Leave the door open, okay?

255
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,508
好的
Okay.

256
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:31,776
爱你
Love you.

257
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:32,844
你好 是贝蒂吗？
Hello, Betty?

258
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:34,111
贝蒂・弗格森？
Betty Ferguson?

259
00:19:34,144 --> 00:19:35,213
是我 你是哪位？
Yes, who's this?

260
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:36,280
里克・尼尔森
This is Rick Nelson.

261
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:37,448
哦 大卫的弟弟？
Oh, David's brother?

262
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:38,982
是的
Yeah.

263
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:41,486
你想让我周五几点
Say, what time do you want me

264
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:43,129
来接你去参加舞会？
to pick you up for the dance Friday night?

265
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:44,331
八点半就很合适
Oh, well, 8:30 would just be wonderful.

266
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:45,857
嘿 我找到她了
Hey, I found her.

267
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:48,091
好的 我八点半准时到
Okay, I'll be there at 8:30...

268
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:50,661
-喂 -劳拉？
- Hello? - Laura?

269
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:53,364
我本来以为我自己在用的
I thought my own

270
00:19:53,464 --> 00:19:55,065
热点洗碗机已经很惊艳了
Hotpoint dishwasher was wonderful,

271
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:57,502
但是这个新洗碗机才是最棒的
but this new one is the greatest ever...

272
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:00,838
它采用了全新的无水渍系统
It uses a new system of spotless cleansing,

273
00:20:00,872 --> 00:20:02,507
两遍洗涤剂清洗
two detergent washes

274
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,843
再加上第二遍漂洗的时候
and a few drops of this special wetting agent

275
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:07,512
自动滴入的…
squirted automatically.

276
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:02,633
喂
Hello?

277
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:03,601
劳拉
Laura.

278
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:04,802
妈妈
Mother.

279
00:21:04,902 --> 00:21:06,280
妈妈 你怎么能把我的号码告诉斯科特？
Mother, how could you give Scott my number?

280
00:21:06,304 --> 00:21:07,438
科迪
Cody.

281
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:08,615
劳拉 你去哪儿了？
Laura, where have you been?

282
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:10,073
他刚给我打了电话
He just called here.

283
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,776
你怎么能这样？
How could you do that?

284
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:13,244
我没告诉他你的号码
I didn't give him your number.

285
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:14,855
只告诉了你的几个好朋友
I only gave it to a few of your friends.

286
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,913
为什么？
Why?

287
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:17,147
你为什么要这样？
Why would you do that?

288
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:19,650
我跟你说过 不要告诉任何人
I told you not to give it to anyone.

289
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,984
他们是你的朋友啊
They're your friends.

290
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:22,720
你把我的地址也告诉他了吗？
Did you give him my address too?

291
00:21:22,753 --> 00:21:23,921
他会找上门来吗？
Is he gonna come here?

292
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:25,365
他不会过去的 劳拉
He's not going to come there, Laura.

293
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:27,057
他只想和你谈谈
He just wants to talk to you.

294
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,292
他很后悔
He feels so bad.

295
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:30,628
我不在乎他怎么想
I don't care how he feels.

296
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:33,264
你知道他做了那种事
I don't know how you can even speak to him

297
00:21:33,297 --> 00:21:34,465
你怎么还能跟他说话？
after what he did.

298
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:37,768
你应该站在我们这边
You're supposed to be on our side.

299
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:39,604
外婆就会支持我们
Grandma would be.

300
00:21:39,637 --> 00:21:41,839
我们当然支持你了 劳拉
Of course we're on your side, Laura.

301
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:43,241
你没有
No you're not.

302
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:45,443
亲爱的 我去陪你们住几天好吗？
Honey, why don't I come and stay with you for a while?

303
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,445
不用
No. No.

304
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:49,313
我不需要任何帮助 一切都很好
I don't need any help. Everything's perfect.

305
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:12,803
妈妈！
Mom!

306
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,471
科迪
Cody.

307
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:14,705
科迪 怎么了？
Cody, what's wrong?

308
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:16,039
我的房间里有怪物
There was a monster in my room.

309
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:17,975
没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

310
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,544
你没事的
You're okay.

311
00:22:19,644 --> 00:22:21,288
妈妈 池塘里的怪物在我房间里！
Mom, the monster from the pond was in my room!

312
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:23,281
亲爱的 没有怪物
Honey, there's no monster.

313
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:24,682
你只是做噩梦了
You're just having a bad dream.

314
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:25,822
你不听我说话
You're not listening to me.

315
00:22:25,883 --> 00:22:27,318
它就在这里
It was right here.

316
00:22:27,385 --> 00:22:28,505
梦很像真的
It doesn't feel like a dream,

317
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:30,988
我知道 但我保证那只是梦
I know, but it was, I promise.

318
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:32,356
怪物就在这里
The monster was here.

319
00:23:53,237 --> 00:23:56,107
当我渴望回到你身边时
As I yearn to return to you,

320
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:59,410
你也会渴望回到我身边
so will you yearn to return to me.

321
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:02,980
当我们的道路再次交汇
When our paths do cross again,

322
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,483
我们的心也会欣喜地再次交织
our hearts will entwined with ecstasy.

323
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:13,424
劳拉
Laura,

324
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:15,893
我还以为你是塞顿夫人的鬼魂呢
I thought you were Mrs. Seton's ghost.

325
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:17,328
不是 外婆
No, Grandma.

326
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:18,929
她不喜欢阁楼里
She doesn't like it in the attic.

327
00:24:18,963 --> 00:24:21,132
我只在地下室见过她
I only ever see her in the basement.

328
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:22,933
我也是
Me too.

329
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:25,636
你从哪找到这么老的东西？
Where did you find this old thing?

330
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:30,941
他值得你这么付出吗？
Ugh. Is he really worth the effort?

331
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:34,779
亲爱的 别哭
Oh, honey, don't cry.

332
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:38,516
现在的年轻人一定很难吧
I can't even imagine how hard it is to be young these days.

333
00:24:38,616 --> 00:24:40,785
我年轻那时候要简单得多
It was so much simpler back in my time.

334
00:24:40,818 --> 00:24:43,354
真希望能带你一起回到过去
I wish I could take you back there with me.

335
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,589
我也希望
I wish I could too.

336
00:24:46,424 --> 00:24:47,692
你很适合那个时代
You'd fit right in.

337
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:50,961
谢谢 外婆
Thanks, Grandma.

338
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,486
这是韦弗医生的办公室
This is Dr. Weaver's office.

339
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:16,987
请问有什么可以帮您？
How may I help you?

340
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:18,456
是弗朗辛吗？
Hi, Francine?

341
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:19,390
我是劳拉・巴特勒
It's Laura Butler.

342
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,391
嗨 劳拉
Hi, Laura.

343
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:21,731
我们一直想联系您
We've been trying to reach you.

344
00:25:21,826 --> 00:25:23,828
韦弗医生刚好进来了 稍等
Oh, Dr. Weaver just walked in, hold on.

345
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:26,297
劳拉 你好吗？
Laura, how are you?

346
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,832
你好 医生
Hi, Doctor.

347
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:32,203
我也说不好
I don't know.

348
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:33,671
怎么回事？
What's going on?

349
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:36,674
斯科特给我打电话了
Scott called.

350
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:38,909
你又做梦了吗？
Are you having the dreams again?

351
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:40,212
是的
Yeah.

352
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:44,415
我不知道是不是该重新服药
I'm wondering if maybe I should go back on medication.

353
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:48,018
我更希望不用通过药物来处理
You know, I prefer we didn't handle them through medication.

354
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:49,420
你能今天过来一趟吗？
Can you come in today?

355
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,555
不行 我不在城里
No, I'm out of town.

356
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:53,090
你在哪里？
Where are you?

357
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:55,025
劳拉？
Laura?

358
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,595
我在听
I'm here.

359
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:59,196
你在哪里？
Where are you?

360
00:26:00,998 --> 00:26:04,568
我可能是想多了
You know, I think I'm just being silly.

361
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:06,937
一切都会好起来的
Everything will be fine.

362
00:26:07,037 --> 00:26:09,607
-谢谢你 医生 -劳拉？
- Thank you, Doctor. - Laura?

363
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:13,211
科迪 快点
Cody, hurry up.

364
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:14,578
我们要迟到了
We're going to be late.

365
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:23,053
-下午好 -下午好
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.

366
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:25,723
有什么需要帮忙的吗？
What can I do for you?

367
00:26:25,756 --> 00:26:27,400
我只是想跟你说一声
Well, I just wanted to let you know that the,

368
00:26:27,424 --> 00:26:29,593
厨房的水龙头漏水
the kitchen sink was leaking.

369
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:31,462
所以我把水阀关掉了
So I turned off the water.

370
00:26:31,562 --> 00:26:34,532
可能需要换个新胶圈
Probably just need your new seed washer.

371
00:26:34,565 --> 00:26:37,201
我会去看看的
I'll come by and take a look.

372
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:38,469
谢谢
Thank you.

373
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:42,940
而且电视也有问题了
And also the television sort of popped

374
00:26:44,141 --> 00:26:45,609
现在没法看了
and now it's not working.

375
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:47,745
我们不管电视的事
We're not responsible for the television.

376
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:50,581
好了 莱诺拉 我会过去看看的
Well, now, Lenora, I'd go by and take a look at it.

377
00:26:50,614 --> 00:26:53,417
但是她得支付零件费用
Well, but she's going to have to pay for the parts

378
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,220
电视是上任租客留下的
and the television was left behind.

379
00:26:55,253 --> 00:26:56,420
不是我们的房子提供的
It's not part of the house.

380
00:26:56,487 --> 00:26:57,755
可以的
That's okay.

381
00:26:57,822 --> 00:27:00,292
你先帮我看看吧
If you wouldn't mind just taking a look.

382
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:01,425
没问题
Will do.

383
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:02,626
那好
Okay.

384
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:03,828
祝你们一天愉快
Well, have a nice day.

385
00:27:03,928 --> 00:27:05,796
你也是 小姑娘
You as well, young lady.

386
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:10,601
我本来以为我自己在用的
That's how it starts.

387
00:27:11,435 --> 00:27:14,939
热点洗碗机已经很惊艳了
I thought my own Hotpoint dishwasher was wonderful,

388
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:17,107
但是这个新洗碗机才是最棒的
but this new one is the greatest ever.

389
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:19,610
它采用了全新的无水渍系统
It uses a new system of spotless cleanser,

390
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:21,279
两遍洗涤剂清洗
two detergent washes,

391
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:23,948
再加上第二遍漂洗的时候
plus a few drops of this special wetting agent

392
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:26,318
自动滴入的特殊湿润剂
squirted automatically in the second rinse water.

393
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:27,818
你知道结果是什么吗？
And do you know what this does?

394
00:27:27,918 --> 00:27:31,188
让水不可能残留在餐具上
It makes it impossible for water to collect in drops

395
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:32,324
或者沿着餐具滑落
on your dishes.

396
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:33,858
即使是玻璃餐具和银器
You get spotless dry,

397
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,993
也不会有任何水渍
even on glasses and silver.

398
00:27:36,026 --> 00:27:37,962
在热点洗碗机中
Everything is sparkling clean

399
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:40,130
一切都会洗得闪闪发光
when it's washed in a Hotpoint.

400
00:27:46,203 --> 00:27:47,638
科迪
Cody.

401
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:05,823
请查询号码簿的分类页面
Turn to the classified pages of your phone book.

402
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:07,458
你能找到距离最近的
That's where you will find

403
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:09,960
热点经销商
your nearest Hotpoint dealer.

404
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:43,894
冰箱
Refrigerators,

405
00:28:43,994 --> 00:28:46,063
自动洗衣机和...
automatic washers and...

406
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,540
科迪！
Cody!

407
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,810
科迪！
Cody!

408
00:32:22,946 --> 00:32:24,982
我想回家
I want to go home.

409
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:33,924
安泊尔
Amber.

410
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:35,426
这是你做的？
Is this you?

411
00:32:35,493 --> 00:32:36,493
是你做的？
You did this?

412
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:37,828
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

413
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:52,676
我在想是不是你来我家处理事情
So I thought maybe you had come by the house for something.

414
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:54,678
没有 可能是浣熊吧
No, no, probably a raccoon.

415
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:56,780
它们哪里都能钻进去
They climb all over the place.

416
00:32:56,847 --> 00:32:58,916
太讨厌了
Bunch of pests.

417
00:32:58,949 --> 00:33:01,486
我觉得不是浣熊
No, I don't think this was a raccoon.

418
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:04,821
我儿子说他在池塘边看到了一些东西
My son said that he saw something down by the pond.

419
00:33:04,922 --> 00:33:06,324
他不该去池塘那里
He's not supposed to be at the pond.

420
00:33:06,424 --> 00:33:07,824
我不想让他去那里玩
I don't want him playing near there.

421
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:09,527
我知道 我已经…
Yes, I know. I have, uh,

422
00:33:09,627 --> 00:33:11,329
我已经告诉他不要过去了
I've already told him to stay away from it.

423
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:12,963
我可以设一些捉浣熊的陷阱
I can set some traps from the raccoons.

424
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,467
我真的认为不是浣熊
Again, I really don't think it was a raccoon.

425
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:19,036
所以陷阱应该没用
So I don't think that that would be helpful.

426
00:33:19,136 --> 00:33:23,374
我昨晚出去查看的时候
Oh, but I did manage to lock myself out

427
00:33:23,474 --> 00:33:25,809
把自己锁在了房子外面…
of the house last night when I went to investigate and...

428
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:27,312
等等 这不可能
Wait, that's impossible.

429
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:29,012
门不会自己锁住...
The door doesn't lock on its own...

430
00:33:29,112 --> 00:33:30,324
那就是卡住了
Well, then I guess it was stuck.

431
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:31,683
-你必须... -总之呢
- Well you need... - Anyway.

432
00:33:31,782 --> 00:33:34,652
我只好打破门上的窗户爬进去
I had to break the window on the door to get in.

433
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:36,621
所以我很抱歉
So I'm so sorry.

434
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:37,694
我们已经修好了水龙头
We already fixed the sink.

435
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:38,965
不会再付钱修窗户了
We're not paying for that window.

436
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:40,123
是你弄坏的
You broke it.

437
00:33:40,157 --> 00:33:43,160
我当然会支付窗户的费用了
Of course I will pay for the window.

438
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,296
你有空的时候可以随时过来
Anytime you can stop by.

439
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,531
不用担心
Don't you worry.

440
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:47,631
我来处理
I'll take care of it.

441
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:48,899
谢谢

那个小朋有在自己玩

科迪 我知道你在这里不开心

我们不会回梅萨的 你知道原因
We are not going back to Mesa and you know why.

471
00:35:41,813 --> 00:35:44,282
因为你讨厌爸爸
Because you hate Dad.

472
00:35:44,315 --> 00:35:46,016
我不是讨厌爸爸
No, I don't hate Dad.

473
00:35:46,116 --> 00:35:47,418
我是讨厌爸爸对我们做的事
I hate what Dad did to us.

474
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:49,687
所以我必须确保

475

他不会再伤害我们了

但我还没准备好

479

也许有一天我也会原谅他
Maybe someday.

480
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:12,643
但在那之前
In the meantime,

481
00:36:12,677 --> 00:36:16,614
我们能试着在这里开心地生活吗？
can we try to be happy living here?

482
00:36:18,148 --> 00:36:20,117

池塘里的那个

00:36:31,462 --> 00:36:33,631
你不是说池塘里的是个怪物吗？
I thought you said it was a monster in the pond.

488
00:36:34,665 --> 00:36:36,467
我本来以为是怪物
I thought there was a monster in the pond,

489
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:40,671
但是她到我的房间跟我说话

我也喜欢热点的设计

00:46:16,046 --> 00:46:17,382
她不是故意吓唬你的 妈妈
She didn't mean to scare you, Mom.

585
00:46:17,415 --> 00:46:18,450
科迪 闭嘴！
Be quiet, Cody!

586
00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:19,883
你得跟她谈谈 妈妈
You need to talk to her, Mom.

587
00:46:19,917 --> 00:46:21,027
她不会伤害你的 她不会伤害任何人！
She would never hurt you. She wouldn't hurt anyone!

588
00:46:21,051 --> 00:46:22,619
够了 科迪！
Enough, Cody! Enough!

589
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,088
我不知道那是什么东西
I don't not know what that thing is

590
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:25,756
但是你永远不许再跟它说话了！
but you are never talking to it again.

591
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:27,091
明白吗？永远！
Do you understand? Ever!

592
00:46:27,124 --> 00:46:28,393
你要带我回家吗？
Are you gonna take me home?

593
00:46:28,426 --> 00:46:30,794
不 该死的 我说了无数遍了
No, goddammit, for the hundredth time.

594
00:46:30,894 --> 00:46:32,430
我们不回家
We're not going home.

595
00:46:32,496 --> 00:46:33,831
别再提这事了
Stop talking about that.

596
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:35,599
那我们要去哪？
Then where are we going?

597
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:43,274
我该怎么办？
What am I supposed to do?

598
00:46:48,012 --> 00:46:51,115
我该怎么办？
What am I supposed to do?

599
00:46:55,753 --> 00:46:57,355
没事的 妈妈
It's okay, Mom.

600
00:46:58,256 --> 00:46:59,257
她走了
She's gone.

601
00:47:00,924 --> 00:47:03,127
我会让她不要再去找你了
I'll tell her not to bother you anymore.

602
00:47:04,762 --> 00:47:05,963
好吗？
Okay?

603
00:47:05,996 --> 00:47:07,998
你该睡觉了 你累了
You should go to bed. You're tired.

604
00:47:08,866 --> 00:47:12,504
我会陪着你的 好吗？
I'll stay with you, okay?

605
00:47:12,603 --> 00:47:15,039
我们会没事的
We'll be all right.

606
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:17,375
我保证
I promise.

607
00:47:17,475 --> 00:47:18,842
我们会没事的
We're gonna be all right.

608
00:47:50,174 --> 00:47:52,076
你准备好了？
You ready?

609
00:47:53,877 --> 00:47:56,180
我希望你一到学校
Now, I want you to give these out

610
00:47:56,214 --> 00:47:58,349
就把这些都发出去 好吗？
as soon as you get to school, okay?

611
00:47:58,383 --> 00:47:59,750
-好的 -很好
- Okay. - Okay.

612
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,387
就放在这里
Put 'em right in here.

613
00:48:17,701 --> 00:48:19,203
你好 接线员
Hello, operator,

614
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:23,173
请帮我转接圣玛丽教堂吗？
will you connect me with St. Mary's church please?

615
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:24,775
谢谢
Thank you.

616
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:25,876
圣玛丽教堂
Saint Mary's.

617
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:27,378
艾格尼丝修女
Sister Agnes speaking.

618
00:48:27,445 --> 00:48:28,612
你好
Hi.

619
00:48:28,712 --> 00:48:31,382
不知道有没有人
I was wondering if there might be someone available

620
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:34,252
能跟我谈谈？
to speak with me?

621
00:48:34,352 --> 00:48:36,053
我 我想...
I, I think...

622
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:41,392
我觉得我家里有恶魔之类的东西
I think I have a demon or something in my house.

623
00:48:44,429 --> 00:48:47,232
喂？
Hello?

624
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:49,133
喂？
Hello?

625
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:16,594
朗特里先生有空吗？
Is Mr. Langtree available?

626
00:49:16,628 --> 00:49:19,631
怎么了 你又把什么东西弄坏了？
Why, what'd you break this time?

627
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,432
没有
Oh. Nothing, nothing.

628
00:49:21,499 --> 00:49:23,268
我就是 呃…
I just, um...

629
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:27,338
我不知道该怎么说
I don't, I don't know exactly how to say this.

630
00:49:27,438 --> 00:49:29,307
直说就行了
Well, just say it.

631
00:49:31,775 --> 00:49:33,110
有没有人说过
Has anyone ever said

632
00:49:33,143 --> 00:49:37,282
那座房子有什么不对劲？
that there's something wrong with the house?

633
00:49:38,182 --> 00:49:40,585
你到底想干什么 小姐？
What are you up to, missy?

634
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:42,986
什么意思？
What do you mean?

635
00:49:43,086 --> 00:49:44,797
因为你搬进那所房子之前
Because you knew exactly what you were getting into

636
00:49:44,821 --> 00:49:46,190
就已经知道房子的状况了
when you moved into the house.

637
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:48,626
如果你觉得你可以穿着那条小裙子
So if you think that you can come sashaying in here

638
00:49:48,692 --> 00:49:50,361
在这里搞点小动作
in that little skirt

639
00:49:50,461 --> 00:49:53,298
就可以骗我们在那房子上投入一大笔钱
and con us into putting a whole bunch of money into that place,

640
00:49:53,331 --> 00:49:55,466
我丈夫可能会蠢到上你的当
my husband might be stupid enough to fall for that,

641
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,534
但我不会
but I'm not.

642
00:49:56,634 --> 00:49:58,369
我没想让你们干什么事
I'm not trying to do anything.

643
00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:00,069
那我不明白你来这里干什么
Well, I don't know what you're doing here

644
00:50:00,137 --> 00:50:02,139
除非你在隐瞒什么
in the first place, unless you're hiding something.

645
00:50:02,172 --> 00:50:04,475
我是想问...
I am trying to ask you...

646
00:50:05,976 --> 00:50:08,845
那栋房子里是不是有鬼
if there's a ghost in the house.

647
00:50:08,946 --> 00:50:10,615
鬼？
A ghost!

648
00:50:10,648 --> 00:50:11,815
你吸毒了吗？
Is it drugs?

649
00:50:11,882 --> 00:50:13,784
没有
No, no.

650
00:50:13,817 --> 00:50:15,486
我可是有孩子的人
I have a child.

651
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:24,061
如果再让我听到
Because if I get wind

652
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:26,196
那座房子里闹鬼之类的屁话
that any of that crap is going on in that house,

653
00:50:26,297 --> 00:50:28,165
我就要报警了
I'm going to call the police,

654
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:32,503
到时候警察肯定会把你的孩子带走
and you can be sure of the fact they'll take your child away from you.

655
00:50:48,085 --> 00:50:49,220

? Every day ?

656
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,887

? It's a gettin' closer ?

657
00:50:50,988 --> 00:50:51,998
吹这么多气球干什么？
What are we going to do with all these balloons?

658
00:50:52,022 --> 00:50:52,990
挂起来
Oh, we're going to hang them.

659
00:50:53,023 --> 00:50:55,058
从这里开始
I'm going to hang from here,

660
00:50:55,158 --> 00:50:57,662
沿着这里挂一排
and then along there.

661
00:50:57,695 --> 00:50:58,962
也许那里也挂几个
And maybe over there.

662
00:50:59,062 --> 00:51:00,231
肯定很好看
It's gonna look great.

663
00:51:00,331 --> 00:51:01,666
所有人都会喜欢的
Everyone's gonna love it.

664
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:02,933

? Hey, hey, hey ?

665
00:51:03,033 --> 00:51:05,102

? Everyday, it's a getting faster ?

666
00:51:05,202 --> 00:51:06,003

? Everyone ?

667
00:51:06,036 --> 00:51:07,838
听起来像放屁
It sounds like I farted.

668
00:51:07,871 --> 00:51:09,207
你也试试 妈妈
You do it, Mom.

669
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,907

? Love like yours ?

670
00:51:11,008 --> 00:51:13,944

? Will surely come my way ?

671
00:51:14,044 --> 00:51:15,713

? Hey, hey, hey ?

672
00:51:15,747 --> 00:51:16,947
是谁在切奶酪？
Who cut the cheese?

673
00:51:17,047 --> 00:51:19,550

? Everyday seems a little longer ?

674
00:51:19,617 --> 00:51:23,086

? Every way, love's a little stronger ?

675
00:51:23,186 --> 00:51:24,855

? Come what may ?

676
00:51:24,888 --> 00:51:27,190

? Do you ever long for ?

677
00:51:27,225 --> 00:51:30,361

? True love from me ?

678
00:51:30,395 --> 00:51:33,564

? Everyday, it's a gettin' closer ?

679
00:51:33,631 --> 00:51:37,235

? Goin' faster than a roller coaster ?

680
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:42,806

? Love like yours will surely come my way ?

681
00:51:42,906 --> 00:51:45,743

? Hey, hey, hey ?

682
00:52:15,939 --> 00:52:17,642
完美
Perfect.

683
00:52:34,692 --> 00:52:36,193
别担心 他们肯定会来的
Don't worry, I'm sure they're coming.

684
00:52:36,294 --> 00:52:38,629
可能有些人迷路了
You know, I bet some of them even got lost.

685
00:52:38,663 --> 00:52:41,865
大家参加派对的时候总是迟到
And people love to come late to parties.

686
00:52:41,965 --> 00:52:43,033
你到时候就知道了
You'll see.

687
00:52:45,703 --> 00:52:47,505
也许我应该打几个电话问问
Maybe I should give a few of them a call.

688
00:52:47,605 --> 00:52:50,140
厨房里好像有一份学校的联系表
I think I have a class list from the school in the kitchen.

689
00:52:50,173 --> 00:52:51,542
马上回来
Be right back.

690
00:53:18,536 --> 00:53:20,371
他们应该不会来了 小家伙
I don't think they're coming, buddy.

691
00:53:21,806 --> 00:53:23,674
我知道
I know.

692
00:53:23,741 --> 00:53:26,844
别觉得这是针对你的 好吗？
I don't want you to take it personally, okay?

693
00:53:26,878 --> 00:53:28,646
我们住得离市区太远了
We live really far out of town.

694
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:30,515
有些人只是…
You know, some people, they just,

695
00:53:30,581 --> 00:53:35,051
没那么多时间来这么远的地方
they can't spend the time driving out here.

696
00:53:35,753 --> 00:53:37,688
好吗？
Okay?

697
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:40,023
明年我们找家茶餐厅给你办派对
But hey, next year we'll have your party

698
00:53:40,056 --> 00:53:42,560
或者披萨店
at the malt shop or the pizza parlor.

699
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,762
肯定很有意思
That'll be fun.

700
00:53:44,862 --> 00:53:46,697
好的
Okay.

701
00:53:46,731 --> 00:53:50,234
要打开你的礼物吗？
Do you wanna open your presents?

702
00:53:50,334 --> 00:53:51,736
暂时不要了
Not right now.

703
00:53:51,836 --> 00:53:54,004
我现在只想上楼回房间
I think I'm just going to go upstairs.

704
00:53:54,037 --> 00:53:55,673
你确定吗？
You sure?

705
00:53:55,706 --> 00:53:57,708
好的
Okay.

706
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,890
别往这里打电话了 斯科特
Stop calling here, Scott.

707
00:54:12,956 --> 00:54:14,892
求你别挂我的电话 劳拉
Please don't hang up on me, Laura.

708
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:17,695
求你跟我谈谈吧
Please talk to me.

709
00:54:18,729 --> 00:54:21,064
该说的我都已经说过了
I've said everything I ever want to say to you.

710
00:54:21,131 --> 00:54:23,601
对不起 我真的很抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

711
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:26,036
我想你 想我儿子
I miss you. I miss my son.

712
00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:27,472
那你最好习惯这一点
Well, you better get used to it

713
00:54:27,572 --> 00:54:29,807
因为你再也见不到我们了
because you'll never see either one of us ever again.

714
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,450
我也喜欢热点的设计
And I love the way our Hotpoint's designed too.

715
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,352
简直是为我量身定做的
It could have been made for me.

716
00:55:15,286 --> 00:55:18,589
内部设计都非常实用
The interior arrangements are all so practical.

717
00:56:21,919 --> 00:56:23,654
科迪！
Cody!

718
00:56:23,688 --> 00:56:24,589
为什么？
Why?

719
00:56:24,689 --> 00:56:26,156
你为什么没送出去？
Why didn't you hand these out?

720
00:56:26,189 --> 00:56:27,692
我花了那么多时间
I spent all that time

721
00:56:27,725 --> 00:56:30,227
想把你的生日派对办好
making a special day for your birthday

722
00:56:30,328 --> 00:56:31,996
而你就坐在那里
and you just sat there.

723
00:56:32,029 --> 00:56:34,665
坐在那里看我忙来忙去
You just sat there and watched me do it.

724
00:56:34,699 --> 00:56:37,034
但你根本连邀请信都没送出去！
And you didn't even hand out the invitations!

725
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,369
为什么？
Why?

726
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:39,337
为什么要这样？
Why would you do that?

727
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:40,871
科迪
Cody.

728
00:56:40,938 --> 00:56:42,273
科迪 不
Cody, no.

729
00:56:42,373 --> 00:56:44,041
科迪 回来
Cody, come back here.

730
00:56:46,844 --> 00:56:47,845
科迪
Cody,

731
00:56:47,878 --> 00:56:49,513
科迪
Cody,

732
00:56:49,547 --> 00:56:50,915
科迪 停下
Cody, stop it right now.

733
00:56:51,015 --> 00:56:53,217
-告诉我！ -因为他们不会来的
- Now, tell me! - Because they wouldn't come.

734
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,286
你不听我说话 你不听任何人说话！
You don't listen to me. You don't listen to anyone!

735
00:56:55,386 --> 00:56:56,554
你怎么知道？
How would you know that?

736
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,555
你根本没给他们机会
You didn't even give them a chance.

737
00:56:57,588 --> 00:56:58,389
因为我跟他们不一样
Because I'm not like them.

738
00:56:58,422 --> 00:56:59,357
我讨厌这里
I hate it here.

739
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:00,858
我想回家
I want to go home.

740
00:57:00,891 --> 00:57:02,893
我们不会回去的 明白了吗？
We are not going back there. Do you hear me?

741
00:57:05,863 --> 00:57:08,432
科迪
Cody.

742
00:57:11,736 --> 00:57:12,903
科迪 怎么…
Cody, what...

743
00:57:12,937 --> 00:57:14,271
你怎么了？
What is wrong with you?

744
00:57:14,372 --> 00:57:15,372
科迪
Cody, Cody,

745
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:16,307
别这样
please.

746
00:57:16,407 --> 00:57:17,742
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

747
00:57:17,775 --> 00:57:19,310
好了
Okay.

748
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,812
跟妈妈一起呼吸 深呼吸
Breathe with Mommy. Breathe, baby.

749
00:57:41,766 --> 00:57:43,467
如果你又感觉不舒服了
If you start to feel bad again,

750
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:45,636
就告诉老师 好吗？
you just tell the teacher, okay?

751
00:57:45,736 --> 00:57:47,471
好
Okay.

752
00:58:05,456 --> 00:58:06,924
劳拉
Laura.

753
00:58:09,427 --> 00:58:10,828
劳拉
Laura.

754
00:58:13,998 --> 00:58:15,800
劳拉！
Laura!

755
00:58:15,833 --> 00:58:18,636
一个小时之内 把新的DM40放在我的桌子上
I need that new DM 40 on my desk in an hour.

756
00:58:20,805 --> 00:58:24,141
DM40是文件中最重要的表格
The DM4's the most crucial form in the file.

757
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:26,477
嘿 科迪 今天过得怎么样？
Hey, Cody, how was your day?

758
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:29,146
-还可以 -是吗？
- It was okay. - Yeah?

759
00:58:33,317 --> 00:58:36,954
科迪 你是不是捉弄那些小姑娘了？
Cody, have you been teasing those little girls?

760
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,291
没有
No.

761
00:58:40,324 --> 00:58:41,726
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

762
00:58:41,826 --> 00:58:43,160
嗯
Yes.

763
00:58:43,194 --> 00:58:46,130
她们好像在跟老师告你的状
'Cause I can see them tattling on you to a teacher.

764
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:50,510
在我今晚接到老师电话之前
Do you want to give me your side of the story

765
00:58:50,534 --> 00:58:52,169
你想给我讲讲你那版本的故事吗？
before I get a call tonight?

766
00:58:52,203 --> 00:58:54,004
我什么也没做
I didn't do anything.

767
00:58:54,638 --> 00:58:56,674
好吧 那我就等电话吧
All right, I'll wait for the call.

768
00:59:36,347 --> 00:59:38,015
兰特里夫人？
Mrs. Langtree?

769
00:59:39,283 --> 00:59:41,452
哦 你好
Oh, oh, hello.

770
00:59:41,552 --> 00:59:44,355
我只是在检查设备
I was just checking on the appliances.

771
00:59:44,388 --> 00:59:46,123
-真的吗？ -是的
- Really? - Yeah.

772
00:59:46,224 --> 00:59:48,893
我不这么认为 你是在窥探吧
I don't think so. I think you were snooping.

773
00:59:48,926 --> 00:59:51,462
找到你想找的毒品了吗？
Did you find the drugs you were looking for?

774
00:59:51,562 --> 00:59:52,930
这是我的房子
You know, this is my house

775
00:59:52,997 --> 00:59:54,674
所以我可以随时来检查
so I can actually check on it anytime I want.

776
00:59:54,698 --> 00:59:56,009
没有我的许可你就不可以
Not without my permission, you can't.

777
00:59:56,033 --> 00:59:57,701
如果你想确定这一点
And if you'd like to validate that,

778
00:59:57,735 --> 00:59:59,370
我们可以让警察跟你说
we can call the police.

779
00:59:59,403 --> 01:00:00,971
警察？
The police?

780
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:02,740
是的
Mm-hmm.

781
01:00:03,407 --> 01:00:06,211
你是有什么毛病吗？
Is there something wrong with you?

782
01:00:06,244 --> 01:00:09,247
因为我觉得这座房子里有些事情
Because I think there's something terribly wrong

783
01:00:09,313 --> 01:00:10,648
非常不对劲
going on in this house.

784
01:00:10,748 --> 01:00:11,715
如果你搞清楚了
Well, when you figure it out,

785
01:00:11,749 --> 01:00:13,384
能告诉我一声吗？
will you give me a holler?

786
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:15,653
因为我太想知道了
Because I would just love to know.

787
01:00:15,753 --> 01:00:19,257
我要求你从这里搬走
I want you out of this house.

788
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:21,425
你有30天
You have 30 days.

789
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,093
给我书面通知
Put it in writing.

790
01:00:23,127 --> 01:00:24,328
我会的
Oh, I will.

791
01:00:24,428 --> 01:00:26,298
30天
30 days.

792
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:29,066

794
01:00:32,937 --> 01:00:36,674

798
01:00:48,253 --> 01:00:50,821

01:00:50,921 --> 01:00:55,293

800
01:00:55,327 --> 01:00:58,495

? She give me Katchi ?

801
01:00:58,596 --> 01:01:03,367

? All night long ?

802
01:01:03,467 --> 01:01:05,303

? Well, well, well ?

803
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:07,204

? It's been a long day ?

804
01:01:07,305 --> 01:01:11,108

? I'm kinda tired, bring your soothing arms my way ?

805
01:01:11,141 --> 01:01:14,979

? My back is achin' and my body sore ?

806
01:01:15,012 --> 01:01:18,682

? Don't stop, honey, you know that I want more ?

807
01:01:18,782 --> 01:01:21,819

? She give me Katchi ?

808
01:01:21,852 --> 01:01:26,358

? All night long ?

809
01:01:26,457 --> 01:01:29,327

? She give me Katchi ?

810
01:01:29,393 --> 01:01:32,330

? All night long ?

811
01:01:32,396 --> 01:01:34,465

? All night ?

812
01:01:47,478 --> 01:01:51,048
当她来的时候 她会绕山而来
? She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes ?

813
01:01:51,148 --> 01:01:56,553
当她来的时候 她会绕山而来
? She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes ?

814
01:01:58,055 --> 01:01:59,499
她会绕山而来
? She'll be coming around the mountain ?

815
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:01,259
她会绕山而来
? She'll be coming around the mountain ?

816
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:05,029
当她来的时候 她会绕山而来
? She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes ?

817
01:02:05,095 --> 01:02:07,197
科迪 不！
Cody, no!

818
01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:13,771
科迪
Cody.

819
01:02:28,585 --> 01:02:30,454
你好
Hello.

820
01:02:30,554 --> 01:02:32,390
你在哪？
Where are you?

821
01:02:32,424 --> 01:02:33,724
我已经准备好了
I'm ready.

822
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,801
科迪？
Cody?

823
01:02:45,202 --> 01:02:46,371
科迪？
Cody?

824
01:02:47,738 --> 01:02:49,407
科迪 停下！
Cody, stop!

825
01:03:45,195 --> 01:03:47,131
科迪
Cody, Cody.

826
01:03:47,197 --> 01:03:48,366
呼吸
Please breathe.

827
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:49,700
呼吸 宝贝
Breathe, baby.

828
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,504
对 就这样 宝贝
There. That's right, baby. That's right.

829
01:03:52,603 --> 01:03:53,804
你没事了
You're okay.

830
01:03:53,837 --> 01:03:56,807
哦 科迪
Oh, Cody. Cody.

831
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,447
科迪
Cody.

832
01:04:37,515 --> 01:04:39,250
我收到过很多次投诉
I've had repeated complaints

833
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:42,353
关于DM40归档不正确或者不完整
about the DM 40 being filed incorrectly or incomplete,

834
01:04:42,387 --> 01:04:45,689
没有给文件附上正确的信函
not attaching your correspondence to the proper files.

835
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,758
我会努力改进的
I'll try to get better at that.

836
01:04:47,858 --> 01:04:50,861
为审计员妥善维护档案
It's extremely important that you maintain

837
01:04:50,894 --> 01:04:53,797
是非常重要的
proper maintenance of the files for the auditors.

838
01:04:53,897 --> 01:04:55,699
准确性是对我们的评分标准
We're graded on accuracy.

839
01:04:55,766 --> 01:05:00,238
如果达不到某个标准 我们是要交罚款的
There're fines implemented if we don't meet a certain standard.

840
01:05:00,338 --> 01:05:03,408
我明白
I understand.

841
01:05:03,508 --> 01:05:06,377
劳拉 我要问你一个私人问题
Laura, I have to ask you a personal question.

842
01:05:07,744 --> 01:05:09,347
你是不是一直在喝酒？
Have you been drinking?

843
01:05:10,614 --> 01:05:14,285
我知道你喝了 我能闻到
I know you have. I can smell it.

844
01:05:14,385 --> 01:05:16,387
我们不能容忍在工作时间饮酒
We don't tolerate drinking on the job.

845
01:05:16,421 --> 01:05:18,755
这在员工手册中已经明确写出了
That's clearly stated in your employee handbook.

846
01:05:18,856 --> 01:05:20,391
是的
Yes, it is.

847
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,260
我知道 因为我读过
I know because I read it.

848
01:05:25,363 --> 01:05:27,931
但如果让你过我的生活 你也会喝酒的
But I think that if you had my job, you'd be drinking too.

849
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:30,901
离开你的家人和朋友
You try leaving your family and your friends

850
01:05:30,934 --> 01:05:32,403
以及你熟悉的一切
and everything you've ever known

851
01:05:32,437 --> 01:05:35,306
搬到一个偏僻的小镇
to move to this small town in the middle of nowhere,

852
01:05:35,406 --> 01:05:36,574
只能靠自己
all by yourself,

853
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,910
因为没有人给你任何其他选择 先试试这些
simply because no one gave you any other choice.

854
01:05:39,943 --> 01:05:41,912
然后再跟我谈工作期间饮酒的事
Then talk to me about drinking on the job.

855
01:05:41,945 --> 01:05:42,946
劳拉 听着
Laura, look.

856
01:05:43,046 --> 01:05:44,382
或者我们有一份
Or maybe there's a company manual

857
01:05:44,415 --> 01:05:47,418
关于如何摆脱怪物的员工手册
on how to get rid of a monster.

858
01:05:47,452 --> 01:05:50,087
而且我不是在谈论我的前夫
And I'm not talking about my ex-husband

859
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,492
也不是在说让我喘不过来气的压力
or my entire overwhelming situation.

860
01:05:54,592 --> 01:05:58,596
我是在说一个真正的怪物
No, I am talking about an actual monster

861
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:01,566
它半夜来到我家
who comes into my house in the middle of the night

862
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,966
想把我儿子拖出去
and tries to drag my son out

863
01:06:03,066 --> 01:06:05,303
淹死在房子后面的池塘里
and drown him in a pond out back.

864
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:10,275
我知道你觉得我疯了
I know you think I'm nuts.

865
01:06:10,308 --> 01:06:11,808
不
No.

866
01:06:11,909 --> 01:06:12,943
我没这么想
I don't think that.

867
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,646
我觉得你需要帮助
I think you need help.

868
01:06:14,745 --> 01:06:15,979
我不需要帮助
I do not need help.

869
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,349
一切都在我的控制中
I have everything completely under control.

870
01:06:18,449 --> 01:06:20,083
才不是呢
No, you don't.

871
01:06:20,117 --> 01:06:23,120
我们完全可以帮助你这样的女性
There's no reason we can't help women like you.

872
01:06:23,153 --> 01:06:24,355
上面有电话号码
There's a number there.

873
01:06:24,455 --> 01:06:28,426
打电话 跟护士或者咨询师谈谈
Call it, speak to a nurse or counselor.

874
01:06:28,459 --> 01:06:33,897
我觉得这个应该留给你
Actually, I think you should keep this

875
01:06:33,997 --> 01:06:35,108
因为我不需要你的帮助
because I don't want your help

876
01:06:35,132 --> 01:06:37,468
也不需要你可怜的工作

877
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,936
那就走吧
Then go.

878
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:40,438

881
01:06:47,811 --> 01:06:51,616

882
01:06:51,649 --> 01:06:55,220

? She give me Katchi ?

886
01:07:05,996 --> 01:07:10,702

? All night long ?

887
01:07:10,801 --> 01:07:12,803

? Well, well, well ?

888
01:07:12,836 --> 01:07:15,240

? It's been a long day ?

889
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,209

? I'm kinda tired, bring your soothing arms my way ?

890
01:07:18,309 --> 01:07:19,843

893
01:07:23,715 --> 01:07:26,684
你的啤酒喝完了
Your beer is empty.

894
01:07:26,718 --> 01:07:28,018
我再给你买一瓶

酒保 再给他来一瓶

我要一瓶这个
And can I have another one of those?

897
01:07:31,556 --> 01:07:32,323
别这样
No, no, no, please.

898
01:07:32,357 --> 01:07:33,824
我不能让你请我喝酒
You, you don't buy me a drink.

899
01:07:33,857 --> 01:07:35,360
别这样 我在庆祝
Come on, I'm celebrating.

900
01:07:35,393 --> 01:07:36,860
庆祝什么？
Oh, what are we celebrating?

901
01:07:36,893 --> 01:07:38,696
我今天辞职了

我喜欢你的风格

01:07:43,534 --> 01:07:46,903
这样吧 如果你跟我跳支舞
I'll tell you what, I'll get you that drink

906
01:07:47,004 --> 01:07:49,840
我就请你喝酒
if you come dance with me.

907
01:07:49,873 --> 01:07:51,542

Oh.

908
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,543

就一支舞
One dance.

910
01:07:59,217 --> 01:08:00,585
你知道这首歌吗？
You know this song?

911
01:08:00,685 --> 01:08:01,885
不知道
Mm-mm.

912
01:08:01,918 --> 01:08:04,955
很老了 慢慢被人遗忘了
Yeah, well, it's old and forgotten.

913
01:08:05,055 --> 01:08:07,525
有点像我
Kinda like me.

914
01:08:07,558 --> 01:08:08,959
但是你
But, you,

915
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:12,530
年轻又漂亮
you are a pretty young thing

916
01:08:12,563 --> 01:08:16,267
穿着漂亮的小圆点连衣裙
in a pretty little polka dot dress.

917
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:20,705
看起来像个天使
You look like an angel.

918
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:24,409
我的意思是...
I mean like...

919
01:08:24,442 --> 01:08:27,578
就好像我已经死了 现在身处天堂
like I died and went to heaven.

920
01:08:30,281 --> 01:08:31,582
我确实当过天使
I was an angel once

921
01:08:31,616 --> 01:08:34,117
在教堂的一次戏剧演出里
in a play at church.

922
01:08:35,286 --> 01:08:39,257
我外婆给我做了漂亮的天使翅膀
My grandmother made me the most beautiful angel wings.

923
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:42,460
我觉得穿上那些翅膀好像就能飞了
I felt like I could fly in those wings.

924
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,728
像你这样的女孩
A girl like you,

925
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:46,431
不需要翅膀就能飞翔
you don't need wings to fly.

926
01:08:46,464 --> 01:08:48,098
对 我有车
No, I have a car.

927
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:50,601
对 这就行了
Oh, well, that'll do.

928
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:51,669
车确实很有用
That's pretty good.

929
01:08:52,437 --> 01:08:54,672
那你接下来要做什么 天使？
So what are you going to do next, angel?

930
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:01,479
我不知道
I don't know.

931
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:02,680
我不知道
I don't know.

932
01:09:04,582 --> 01:09:05,350
嘿
Hey, hey, hey.

933
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:06,016
别哭呀
Don't cry.

934
01:09:06,116 --> 01:09:07,318
别哭
Don't cry.

935
01:09:07,418 --> 01:09:08,858
你会想出办法的
You're going to figure something out.

936
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:13,624
我想去别的地方
I just wish I could go somewhere else,

937
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,693
一个新的地方
you know, somewhere new

938
01:09:15,793 --> 01:09:17,160
然后重新开始
and start fresh.

939
01:09:17,261 --> 01:09:19,196
就是…重新开始
Just, just start over.

940
01:09:20,498 --> 01:09:22,800
那你就走吧
Then you go,

941
01:09:22,834 --> 01:09:26,970
找出你漂亮的小翅膀
you dig out those pretty little wings of yours

942
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:30,641
然后展翅高飞
and you fly, fly, fly.

943
01:10:01,004 --> 01:10:02,206
科迪
Cody.

954

警官 我来接我儿子

956

961
01:10:48,386 --> 01:10:50,221
我怕是我的前夫

962
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,390
没告诉我就把他接走了
has taken him without my knowledge.

963

-没事 我们会查清楚的 好吗？ -好的
Okay, well, we're going to get to the bottom of this, okay? - Okay.

971
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,745
你还好吗？
How are you?

972
01:11:14,779 --> 01:11:16,247
科迪在哪？
Where is Cody?

973
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:18,392
我去学校接他 他不在
I went to school to pick him up and he was not there.

974
01:11:18,416 --> 01:11:19,884
对 他不在

975
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:23,119
你觉得他在哪里？
Where do you think he is?

976
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:24,322

979
01:11:28,124 --> 01:11:29,660
你给他打电话了？
Did you call him?

980
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,062
我不用打电话
I didn't need to.

981
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,932
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

982
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:37,435
劳拉
Laura,

983
01:11:37,468 --> 01:11:40,505
我们能不能先同步下信息？
would you mind if we backed up a little bit?

984
01:11:40,605 --> 01:11:42,607
如果我能了解科迪事故的细节
I think I could be of more help

985
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:45,977
我应该能给你提供更多帮助
if I understood the details of Cody's accident.

986
01:11:46,076 --> 01:11:50,681
我指的是去年在亚利桑那发生的事故
I'm referring to the accident last year in Arizona.

987
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,285
哦
Oh.

988
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:56,854
不是大事
Well, that was nothing.

989
01:11:56,954 --> 01:11:58,856
他掉进了游泳池
He fell in the pool.

990
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,160
我当时不在
I wasn't there.

991
01:12:04,262 --> 01:12:07,398
我去超市买东西了
I had to go to the grocery store.

992
01:12:07,498 --> 01:12:10,535
他父亲在家看着他
His father was watching him.

993
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,641
我到家的时候 斯科特正坐在沙发上看球赛
When I came home, Scott was on the couch, watching the game

994
01:12:16,674 --> 01:12:18,476
我走进厨房
and I went into the kitchen

995
01:12:18,509 --> 01:12:22,880
有一种奇怪的感觉 好像出了什么事
and I had this weird feeling like something wrong.

996
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,315
而我站在水池边
And I was standing at the sink

997
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:26,102
看着窗外的游泳池
and I was looking out the window at the pool

998
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:28,219
好像看到里面有什么东西
and I thought I saw something in it.

999
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:32,657
我出去检查 发现是他
When I went out to check, I saw that it was him.

1000
01:12:33,457 --> 01:12:37,395
然后发生了什么？
And then what happened?

1001
01:12:38,496 --> 01:12:40,898
我把他拖了出来
Well, I dragged him out

1002
01:12:40,998 --> 01:12:42,198
给他做了心肺复苏术
and I performed CPR on him

1003
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,001
然后急救人员到了
until the paramedics came

1004
01:12:44,067 --> 01:12:48,673
他活过来了 完全没事了
and then they revived him and he was completely okay.

1005
01:12:51,676 --> 01:12:53,244
为什么问这个？
Why?

1006
01:12:54,077 --> 01:12:56,414
你的意思是发生了这件事
Are you saying there's something wrong with him

1007
01:12:56,514 --> 01:12:58,148
让他有后遗症了？
because of what happened?

1008
01:12:58,181 --> 01:13:00,083
不 我不是这个意思
No, that is not what I'm saying.

1009
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,438
没事的 劳拉
It's okay, Laura.

1010
01:13:20,538 --> 01:13:22,506
你没事的
You're all right.

1011
01:13:31,549 --> 01:13:34,051
我要喝点水
I think I need some water.

1012
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,921
好的
Okay.

1013
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:38,021
你在这里坐着
You sit tight.

1014
01:13:38,055 --> 01:13:39,357
我去给你倒水
I'll get you one.

1015
01:16:15,247 --> 01:16:17,948
她会绕山而来
? She'll be coming around the mountain ?

1016
01:16:18,048 --> 01:16:19,383
科迪！
Cody!

1017
