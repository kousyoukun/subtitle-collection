Good afternoon.

40
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:52,503
Well, hello there, young lady.

41
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:55,105
The little one with you?

42
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:57,708
Yeah, he's buried
in there someplace.

43
00:03:57,775 --> 00:03:58,576
It was long drive.

44
00:03:58,676 --> 00:03:59,844
He's fast asleep.

45
00:03:59,877 --> 00:04:02,213
Let me give you a key
so you can unpack some.

46
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:03,246
Thank you.

47
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:04,715
You need any help?

48
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:05,783
Oh no, thank you.

49
00:04:05,883 --> 00:04:06,950
I don't have much.

50
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,219
Okay.

51
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:09,696
If you need anything,
just let me know.

52
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,721
You've got the number.

53
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:12,690
I do, Mr. Langtree.
Thank you.

54
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:00,671
Oh, what is this place?

55
00:05:02,138 --> 00:05:03,808
It's your new home.

56
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:05,175
Huh?

57
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:06,611
Isn't it wonderful?

58
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:10,314
It's like a dream.

59
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:13,584
How lucky are we?

60
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:22,192
Cody.

61
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:24,094
Look at your room.

62
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,864
Such fun wallpaper, huh?

63
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:28,366
Oh, and this desk,

64
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:29,767
it's perfect.

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,303
You can do all of your
homework right here.

66
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:36,307
It's just so great, huh?

67
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,775
Lots of space out there

68
00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:40,110
to play with all of
your new friends.

69
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:42,446
All right, honey, I'm going
to get some more boxes

70
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,382
in the car and then make dinner.

71
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,984
Are you okay?

72
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,519
I don't feel right.

73
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,189
Well, why don't you
lie down for a little bit

74
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:54,825
and take a nap.

I thought my own

90
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,438
Hotpoint dishwasher
was wonderful,

91
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:16,807
but this new one
is the greatest ever.

92
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:19,910
It uses a new system
of spotless cleansing,

93
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:21,078
two detergent washers,

94
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:23,748
plus a few drops of this
special wetting agent

95
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:26,450
squirted automatically into
the second rinse water.

96
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,252
And do you know what this does?

97
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:29,754
It makes it impossible

98
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:31,098
for water to collect
in drops like...

99
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:32,256
Cody.

100
00:07:32,323 --> 00:07:33,400
Why don't you go
play outside, okay?

101
00:07:33,424 --> 00:07:35,426
I'm about to scrub the floor.

102
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:37,561
Stay near the house
where I can see you.

103
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:38,562
Sparkling clean

104
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:40,064
when it's washed in a Hotpoint.

105
00:07:40,097 --> 00:07:42,233
Turn to the classified
pages of your phone book.

106
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:46,470
That's where you'll find
your nearest Hotpoint dealer

107
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,340
for ranges,

108
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,609
refrigerators,

109
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:54,445
automatic washers and dryers.

110
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:09,420
Cody.

111
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:13,591
Cody?

112
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:22,433
Cody!

113
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:45,923
Cody.

114
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:52,863
Cody!

115
00:09:52,897 --> 00:09:54,465
Didn't you hear me calling you?

116
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:55,733
What are you doing out here?

117
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:57,235
I told you to stay
near the house.

118
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:58,135
Nothing.

119
00:09:58,236 --> 00:09:59,537
I was just...

120
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:01,705
it's a pond.

121
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:05,442
I don't you playing near here.

122
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:06,911
It's dangerous.

123
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:26,764
I thought my own Hotpoint
dishwasher was wonderful,

124
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:28,899
but this new one is
the greatest ever.

125
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:32,102
It uses a new system

00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,271

00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:38,276
squirted automatically into
the second rinse water.

129
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,977
And you know what this does?

130
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:42,088
It makes it impossible for water

131
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:44,114
to collect in drops
on your dishes.

132
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:45,783
You get spotless dry,

133
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,952
even on glasses and silver.

134
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:50,187
Everything is sparkling clean

135
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:51,689
when it's washed in a Hotpoint.

136
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:54,191
Turn to the classified
pages of your phone book.

137
00:12:13,604 --> 00:12:16,707
Don't let go, don't let go.

138
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,249
Don't let go.

139
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:25,582
Don't let go.

140
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:43,901
Don't be afraid.

141
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:47,738
You'll be all right.

142
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:50,140
Greatest ever.

143
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:51,775
It uses a new
system of spotless...

144
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,110
Mom, mom!

145
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:54,645
Two detergent washes

146
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:55,779
plus a few drops of...

147
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,147
Mom!

148
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:58,649
Mom!

149
00:12:58,749 --> 00:12:59,817
Cody?

150
00:13:01,286 --> 00:13:02,220
What happened?

151
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:03,554
Mom there's a...

152
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:04,555
There's a monster
outside my window.

153
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:05,823
No, honey.

154
00:13:05,923 --> 00:13:06,967
You're just having a bad dream.

155
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,793
No, look, look, look, look!

156
00:13:09,893 --> 00:13:10,995
Okay, okay.

157
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:12,596
Let's see.

158
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:14,932
No, no monsters out here.

159
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:16,667
There was a storm
out there, though.

160
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,937
So maybe that's what
scared you, huh?

161
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:24,641
I know, I was having
a bad dream too.

162
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:27,111
Was there a monster in it?

163
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:30,180
Yes, and it was very scary.

164
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:34,585
But I know that you and I

165
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:36,620
are completely safe,

166
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:38,989
like two bugs, snug in a rug.

167
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:42,126
Okay?

168
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:44,762
Get some rest, babe.

169
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:46,663
You got school tomorrow.

170
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,466
I don't want to go to school.

171
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,167
Well, you have to,

172
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:52,504
Mommy says.

173
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:54,472
Come on, lie down.

174
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:55,806
Lay down.

175
00:13:55,873 --> 00:13:57,941
Get some sleep.

176
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,047
Mom,

177
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:07,485
can you leave the door open?

178
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:10,288
Of course.

179
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,303
Dr. Weaver's office.
How may I help you?

180
00:14:25,336 --> 00:14:27,372
May I speak
to Dr. Weaver please?

181
00:14:27,472 --> 00:14:29,807
I'm sorry, ma'am, this is just
his answering service.

182
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,477
Would you like
to leave a message?

183
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,846
No, thank you.

Make yourself comfortable.

208
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:40,771
I'll go get some materials
and be back and get started.

209
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:42,473
Okay, thank you.

210
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:45,476
Hi.

211
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:46,810
Hi.

212
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:47,844
I'm Laura.

213
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:49,146
Jane.

214
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,881
It's very nice
to meet you, Jane.

215
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:52,716
Where'd you get that dress?

216
00:16:52,816 --> 00:16:54,017
Oh, this?

217
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:55,953
I...

218
00:16:56,554 --> 00:16:58,021
This is Jane.

219
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,857
Yes, sir.
Right away.

220
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:25,683
Hey, how was your first day?

221
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:27,685
It was okay.

222
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,387
Did you make any new friends?

223
00:17:31,356 --> 00:17:32,323
No.

224
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:35,360
Well, I'm sure
you will in no time.

225
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,829
All right, here we go home.

226
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,285
Well, I had a great
first day at work.

227
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:02,720
The ladies, they're so nice,

228
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:05,789
Kathy and, um...

229
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,292
Susan.

230
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:10,395
Well, I just got such
a tickle out of all of them.

231
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,298
Cody, eat your dinner.

232
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:15,733
I'm not hungry.

233
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,801
Well, try to eat a little.

234
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:37,988
The troll was twice as big as
the biggest Billy goat gruff,

235
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:39,990
but the Billy goat
was not afraid.

236
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,227
He lowered his horns
and ran at the troll,

237
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,763
pushing him over the bridge.

238
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:47,732
The troll screamed with fury

239
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:49,434
as he fell into the water

240
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:51,636
and was swept away
by the current.

241
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:55,072
Then, the biggest
Billy goat gruff

242
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:56,940
joined his family in the meadow

243
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:58,975
and told them they
never to worry

244
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:01,312
about crossing the bridge again.

245
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:02,447
The end.

246
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:04,449
Read another one.

247
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:05,616
Sorry.

248
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,983
The time has come

249
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:09,654
for counting sheep for little
boys who need their sleep.

250
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:13,189
Now lie down.

251
00:19:13,257 --> 00:19:14,792
You've got school tomorrow.

252
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,993
Got to get some rest.

253
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:19,297
Goodnight, sweet prince.

254
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:28,806
Leave the door open, okay?

255
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,508
Okay.

256
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:31,776
Love you.

257
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:32,844
Hello, Betty?

258
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:34,111
Betty Ferguson?

259
00:19:34,144 --> 00:19:35,213
Yes, who's this?

260
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:36,280
This is Rick Nelson.

261
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:37,448
Oh, David's brother?

262
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:38,982
Yeah.

263
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:41,486
Say, what time do you want me

264
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:43,129
to pick you up for
the dance Friday night?

265
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:44,331
Oh, well, 8:30
would just be wonderful.

266
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:45,857
Hey, I found her.

267
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:48,091
Okay, I'll be there
at 8:30...

268
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:50,661
- Hello?
- Laura?

269
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:53,364
I thought my own

270
00:19:53,464 --> 00:19:55,065
Hotpoint dishwasher
was wonderful,

271
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:57,502
but this new one is
the greatest ever...

272
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:00,838
It uses a new system
of spotless cleansing,

273
00:20:00,872 --> 00:20:02,507
two detergent washes

274
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,843
and a few drops of this
special wetting agent

275
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:07,512
squirted automatically.

276
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:02,633
Hello?

277
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:03,601
Laura.

278
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:04,802
Mother.

279
00:21:04,902 --> 00:21:06,280
Mother, how could you
give Scott my number?

280
00:21:06,304 --> 00:21:07,438
Cody.

281
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:08,615
Laura, where have you been?

282
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:10,073
He just called here.

283
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,776
How could you do that?

284
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:13,244
I didn't give him your number.

285
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:14,855
I only gave it
to a few of your friends.

286
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,913
Why?

287
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:17,147
Why would you do that?

288
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:19,650
I told you
not to give it to anyone.

289
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,984
They're your friends.

290
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:22,720
Did you give him my address too?

291
00:21:22,753 --> 00:21:23,921
Is he gonna come here?

292
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:25,365
He's not going
to come there, Laura.

293
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:27,057
He just wants to talk to you.

294
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,292
He feels so bad.

295
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:30,628
I don't care how he feels.

296
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:33,264
I don't know how you
can even speak to him

297
00:21:33,297 --> 00:21:34,465
after what he did.

298
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:37,768
You're supposed
to be on our side.

299
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:39,604
Grandma would be.

300
00:21:39,637 --> 00:21:41,839
Of course
we're on your side, Laura.

301
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:43,241
No you're not.

302
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:45,443
Honey, why don't I come and
stay with you for a while?

303
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,445
No. No.

304
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:49,313
I don't need any help.
Everything's perfect.

305
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:12,803
Mom!

306
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,471
Cody.

307
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:14,705
Cody, what's wrong?

308
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:16,039
There was a monster in my room.

309
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:17,975
It's okay.
It's okay.

310
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,544
You're okay.

311
00:22:19,644 --> 00:22:21,288
Mom, the monster
from the pond was in my room!

312
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:23,281
Honey, there's no monster.

313
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:24,682
You're just having a bad dream.

314
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:25,822
You're not listening to me.

315
00:22:25,883 --> 00:22:27,318
It was right here.

316
00:22:27,385 --> 00:22:28,505
It doesn't feel like a dream,

317
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:30,988
I know, but it was, I promise.

318
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:32,356
The monster was here.

319
00:23:53,237 --> 00:23:56,107
As I yearn to return to you,

320
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:59,410
so will you yearn
to return to me.

321
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:02,980
When our paths do cross again,

322
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,483
our hearts will
entwined with ecstasy.

323
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:13,424
Laura,

324
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:15,893
I thought you were
Mrs. Seton's ghost.

325
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:17,328
No, Grandma.

326
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:18,929
She doesn't like
it in the attic.

327
00:24:18,963 --> 00:24:21,132
I only ever see her
in the basement.

328
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:22,933
Me too.

329
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:25,636
Where did you find
this old thing?

330
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:30,941
Ugh. Is he really
worth the effort?

331
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:34,779
Oh, honey, don't cry.

332
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:38,516
I can't even imagine how hard
it is to be young these days.

333
00:24:38,616 --> 00:24:40,785
It was so much simpler
back in my time.

334
00:24:40,818 --> 00:24:43,354
I wish I could take
you back there with me.

335
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,589
I wish I could too.

336
00:24:46,424 --> 00:24:47,692
You'd fit right in.

337
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:50,961
Thanks, Grandma.

338
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,486
This is Dr. Weaver's office.

339
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:16,987
How may I help you?

340
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:18,456
Hi, Francine?

341
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:19,390
It's Laura Butler.

342
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,391
Hi, Laura.

343
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:21,731
We've been trying to reach you.

344
00:25:21,826 --> 00:25:23,828
Oh, Dr. Weaver just
walked in, hold on.

345
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:26,297
Laura, how are you?

346
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,832
Hi, Doctor.

347
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:32,203
I don't know.

348
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:33,671
What's going on?

349
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:36,674
Scott called.

350
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:38,909
Are you having the dreams again?

351
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:40,212
Yeah.

352
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:44,415
I'm wondering if maybe I
should go back on medication.

353
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:48,018
You know, I prefer we didn't
handle them through medication.

354
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:49,420
Can you come in today?

355
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,555
No, I'm out of town.

356
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:53,090
Where are you?

357
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:55,025
Laura?

358
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,595
I'm here.

359
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:59,196
Where are you?

360
00:26:00,998 --> 00:26:04,568
You know, I think
I'm just being silly.

361
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:06,937
Everything will be fine.

362
00:26:07,037 --> 00:26:09,607
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Laura?

363
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:13,211
Cody, hurry up.

364
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:14,578
We're going to be late.

365
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:23,053
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

366
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:25,723
What can I do for you?

367
00:26:25,756 --> 00:26:27,400
Well, I just wanted to
let you know that the,

368
00:26:27,424 --> 00:26:29,593
the kitchen sink was leaking.

369
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:31,462
So I turned off the water.

370
00:26:31,562 --> 00:26:34,532
Probably just need
your new seed washer.

371
00:26:34,565 --> 00:26:37,201
I'll come by and take a look.

372
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:38,469
Thank you.

373
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:42,940
And also the television
sort of popped

374
00:26:44,141 --> 00:26:45,609
and now it's not working.

375
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:47,745
We're not responsible
for the television.

376
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:50,581
Well, now, Lenora, I'd go
by and take a look at it.

377
00:26:50,614 --> 00:26:53,417
Well, but she's going to
have to pay for the parts

378
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,220
and the television
was left behind.

379
00:26:55,253 --> 00:26:56,420
It's not part of the house.

380
00:26:56,487 --> 00:26:57,755
That's okay.

381
00:26:57,822 --> 00:27:00,292
If you wouldn't mind
just taking a look.

382
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:01,425
Will do.

383
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:02,626
Okay.

384
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:03,828
Well, have a nice day.

385
00:27:03,928 --> 00:27:05,796
You as well, young lady.

386
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:10,601
That's how it starts.

387
00:27:11,435 --> 00:27:14,939
I thought my own Hotpoint
dishwasher was wonderful,

388
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:17,107
but this new one is
the greatest ever.

389
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:19,610
It uses a new system
of spotless cleanser,

390
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:21,279
two detergent washes,

391
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:23,948
plus a few drops of this
special wetting agent

392
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:26,318
squirted automatically in
the second rinse water.

393
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:27,818
And do you know what this does?

394
00:27:27,918 --> 00:27:31,188
It makes it impossible for
water to collect in drops

395
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:32,324
on your dishes.

396
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:33,858
You get spotless dry,

397
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,993
even on glasses and silver.

398
00:27:36,026 --> 00:27:37,962
Everything is sparkling clean

399
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:40,130
when it's washed in a Hotpoint.

400
00:27:46,203 --> 00:27:47,638
Cody.

401
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:05,823
Turn to the classified
pages of your phone book.

402
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:07,458
That's where you will find

403
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:09,960
your nearest Hotpoint dealer.

404
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:43,894
Refrigerators,

405
00:28:43,994 --> 00:28:46,063
automatic washers and...

406
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,540
Cody!

407
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,810
Cody!

408
00:32:22,946 --> 00:32:24,982
I want to go home.

409
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:33,924
Amber.

410
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:35,426
Is this you?

411
00:32:35,493 --> 00:32:36,493
You did this?

412
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:37,828
Are you sure?

413
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:52,676
So I thought maybe you had come
by the house for something.

414
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:54,678
No, no, probably a raccoon.

415
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:56,780
They climb all over the place.

416
00:32:56,847 --> 00:32:58,916
Bunch of pests.

417
00:32:58,949 --> 00:33:01,486
No, I don't think
this was a raccoon.

418
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:04,821
My son said that he saw
something down by the pond.

419
00:33:04,922 --> 00:33:06,324
He's not supposed
to be at the pond.

420
00:33:06,424 --> 00:33:07,824
I don't want him
playing near there.

421
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:09,527
Yes, I know.
I have, uh,

422
00:33:09,627 --> 00:33:11,329
I've already told him
to stay away from it.

423
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:12,963
I can set some traps
from the raccoons.

424
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,467
Again, I really don't
think it was a raccoon.

425
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:19,036
So I don't think that
that would be helpful.

426
00:33:19,136 --> 00:33:23,374
Oh, but I did manage
to lock myself out

427
00:33:23,474 --> 00:33:25,809
of the house last night when
I went to investigate and...

428
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:27,312
Wait, that's impossible.

429
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:29,012
The door doesn't
lock on its own...

430
00:33:29,112 --> 00:33:30,324
Well, then I guess it was stuck.

431
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:31,683
- Well you need...
- Anyway.

432
00:33:31,782 --> 00:33:34,652
I had to break the window
on the door to get in.

433
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:36,621
So I'm so sorry.

434
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:37,694
We already fixed the sink.

435
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:38,965
We're not paying
for that window.

436
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:40,123
You broke it.

437
00:33:40,157 --> 00:33:43,160
Of course I will
pay for the window.

438
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,296
Anytime you can stop by.

439
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,531
Don't you worry.

440
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:47,631
I'll take care of it.

441
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:48,899
Thank you.

442
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:56,907
Hey, how was your day?

443
00:34:05,383 --> 00:34:07,485
You're not still
mad at me, are you?

444
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,656
Honey, I said I was sorry.

445
00:34:14,992 --> 00:34:16,527
How about some ice cream?

446
00:34:16,561 --> 00:34:17,695
Huh?

447
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:18,696
Yeah.

448
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,666
Cody, why don't you go play?

449
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,533
This looks fun.

450
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,368
Kickball.

451
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:24,768
Why don't you go play with them?

452
00:34:24,868 --> 00:34:26,371
They're friends.

453
00:34:26,404 --> 00:34:28,772
Well, this kid's all by himself.

454
00:34:28,872 --> 00:34:30,251
He looks like he
could use a friend.

455
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:31,709
Why don't you go
ask him to play?

456
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:33,211
He's a dipstick.

457
00:34:33,278 --> 00:34:36,913
Well, maybe you could
help him be a better person.

458
00:34:37,014 --> 00:34:38,081
Right?

459
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:40,718
Go on.
Go ask him to play.

460
00:34:40,784 --> 00:34:41,852
I'll hold your ice cream.

461
00:34:41,885 --> 00:34:42,919
I don't want to.

462
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,422
Go on, ask him to play.

463
00:35:00,538 --> 00:35:01,572
Let's go.

464
00:35:01,606 --> 00:35:03,207
What happened?
He didn't want to play?

465
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:04,375
No, I told you, let's go.

466
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:05,777
Cody, did he say
something to you?

467
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:07,312
No, God, forget it, okay?

468
00:35:07,412 --> 00:35:08,713
Cody.

469
00:35:35,773 --> 00:35:37,608
Cody, I know you're
not happy here.

470
00:35:37,642 --> 00:35:41,779
We are not going back to
Mesa and you know why.

471
00:35:41,813 --> 00:35:44,282
Because you hate Dad.

472
00:35:44,315 --> 00:35:46,016
No, I don't hate Dad.

473
00:35:46,116 --> 00:35:47,418
I hate what Dad did to us.

474
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:49,687
And I'm going to make very sure

475
00:35:49,787 --> 00:35:51,154
that he can never hurt us again.

476
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:54,191
Well, I forgive him.

477
00:35:58,962 --> 00:36:01,299
I'm so proud of you for that.

478
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:05,703
But I'm not ready.

479
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,440
Maybe someday.

480
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:12,643
In the meantime,

481
00:36:12,677 --> 00:36:16,614
can we try to be
happy living here?

482
00:36:18,148 --> 00:36:20,117
Please?

483
00:36:23,688 --> 00:36:25,656
What you drawing?

484
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,658
The pretty lady.

485
00:36:27,725 --> 00:36:29,227
What pretty lady?

486
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:30,661
From the pond.

487
00:36:31,462 --> 00:36:33,631
I thought you said it
was a monster in the pond.

488
00:36:34,665 --> 00:36:36,467
I thought there was
a monster in the pond,

489
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:40,671
but then she came to my
room and talked to me.

490
00:36:42,573 --> 00:36:44,375
Now I understand.

491
00:36:48,145 --> 00:36:50,348
Understand what?

492
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:54,084
Come meet her, Mom.

493
00:36:54,184 --> 00:36:56,854
Come talk to her.

494
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:58,523
Let's go to the pond.

495
00:36:58,556 --> 00:37:01,191
I don't wanna go to the pond.

496
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,662
Well, then I guess she'll
just have to come to you.

497
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:06,997
You know what I would love?

498
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,433
I would love it

499
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:11,369
if you would draw me
a picture of your school or,

500
00:37:11,402 --> 00:37:12,770
or what about a bird?

501
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,373
And we can put your
drawings up on the fridge.

502
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:18,609
It'll look so nice.

503
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:51,996
Did you see the pretty lady?

504
00:39:52,029 --> 00:39:53,898
Did she talk to you, Mom?

505
00:39:53,998 --> 00:39:55,666
Cody, go to sleep.

506
00:39:57,368 --> 00:39:58,869
I love you, Mom.

507
00:40:17,855 --> 00:40:19,590
Cody.

508
00:40:20,725 --> 00:40:22,560
Cody.

509
00:40:22,593 --> 00:40:23,961
I said lunch was ready.

510
00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:25,730
Okay.

511
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,735
That's enough.

512
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:32,202
Give it back!

513
00:40:36,107 --> 00:40:37,742
Cody Richard Butler.

514
00:40:37,808 --> 00:40:40,778
Don't you ever do that again.

515
00:40:42,747 --> 00:40:44,281
Cody.

516
00:40:44,382 --> 00:40:46,050
Why are you so angry at me?

517
00:40:47,585 --> 00:40:48,819
I can't tell you.

518
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:53,156
Is it about your birthday?

519
00:40:53,257 --> 00:40:54,892
I didn't forget.

520
00:40:55,926 --> 00:40:56,994
My birthday?

521
00:40:57,962 --> 00:41:00,631
I was going to ask you
what you wanted to do.

522
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:05,936
Anything but that.

523
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:12,443
Hey, I was thinking,

524
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,011
how about we have a party?

525
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:16,080
We can,

526
00:41:16,113 --> 00:41:17,682
we can have balloons

527
00:41:17,782 --> 00:41:20,251
and ice cream and
cake and presents,

528
00:41:20,284 --> 00:41:23,354
and we can invite
your entire class.

529
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:27,825
It'll be a gas, right?

530
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:33,764
Okay.

531
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:37,200
Okay.

532
00:41:38,102 --> 00:41:40,271
I don't
mind, though. Keeps him happy.

533
00:41:40,304 --> 00:41:44,275
I'm sure our Hotpoint refrigerator
doesn't mind either...

534
00:41:44,308 --> 00:41:47,144
Hey, he looks just
like Roy Rogers.

535
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:49,013
You like Roy Rogers, right?

536
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,115
I have
a feeling it'll be with us

537
00:41:51,148 --> 00:41:53,484
long after Dave and Ricky
are grown up and married.

538
00:41:53,517 --> 00:41:55,986
And I love the way our
Hotpoint's designed too.

539
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:58,055
It could've been...

540
00:41:59,824 --> 00:42:02,193
All the interior arrangements
are so practical.

541
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:15,973
Why don't you talk to
your Hotpoint dealer today

542
00:42:16,006 --> 00:42:18,843
about a refrigerator like
this for your family?

543
00:42:18,876 --> 00:42:22,079
Turn to the classified
pages of your phone book.

544
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:26,050
That's where you will find
your nearest Hotpoint dealer.

545
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:34,692
There.

546
00:42:35,893 --> 00:42:38,562
Now there are exactly
enough invitations

547
00:42:38,662 --> 00:42:40,197
for every kid in your class.

548
00:42:40,232 --> 00:42:43,167
So I want you to make sure
that everyone gets one, okay?

549
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,568
They won't come.

550
00:42:44,668 --> 00:42:46,238
Of course they will.

551
00:42:46,337 --> 00:42:48,105
Everyone loves a party.

552
00:42:48,206 --> 00:42:50,841
- Can I invite the pretty lady?
- Who?

553
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,443
The pretty lady from the pond.

554
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,880
No.
No, you can't.

555
00:42:56,881 --> 00:42:59,350
Why not?
She's my best friend.

556
00:42:59,383 --> 00:43:01,352
She said that she
would take me home.

557
00:43:01,385 --> 00:43:03,921
Cody.

558
00:43:04,021 --> 00:43:06,023
This is your home.

559
00:43:06,056 --> 00:43:07,358
Okay?

560
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,393
If you would just
talk to her, Mom.

561
00:43:09,426 --> 00:43:10,761
Cody, that's enough.

562
00:43:10,828 --> 00:43:13,063
Clean up your toys.
It's almost bedtime.

563
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:19,904
♪ She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes ♪

564
00:43:19,937 --> 00:43:23,040
♪ She'll be coming around

00:43:23,073 --> 00:43:26,610

00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:39,056
Here she comes.

569
00:43:43,828 --> 00:43:45,297
Cody.

570
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:47,431
Go upstairs,
hide in your closet.

571
00:43:47,464 --> 00:43:48,732
Do not make a sound.

572
00:43:48,766 --> 00:43:50,067
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's okay.

573
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,102
- Listen to me. Don't be afraid!
- Cody, just go.

574
00:44:52,496 --> 00:44:55,333
Cody, are you okay?

575
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:45,883
Mom. Mom.

576
00:45:47,352 --> 00:45:49,887
Mom, Mom.

577
00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:52,690
You fell down.

578
00:45:56,394 --> 00:45:58,363
Come on.
Come on.

579
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,802
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Get in the car.

580
00:46:04,902 --> 00:46:06,971
- Why?
- Just get in.

581
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:10,074
- But, Mom...
- Get in the car!

582
00:46:12,743 --> 00:46:14,578
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

583
00:46:14,645 --> 00:46:15,946
But why?
Because she scared you?

584
00:46:16,046 --> 00:46:17,382
She didn't mean
to scare you, Mom.

585
00:46:17,415 --> 00:46:18,450
Be quiet, Cody!

586
00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:19,883
You need to talk to her, Mom.

587
00:46:19,917 --> 00:46:21,027
She would never hurt you.
She wouldn't hurt anyone!

588
00:46:21,051 --> 00:46:22,619
Enough, Cody!
Enough!

589
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,088
I don't not know
what that thing is

590
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:25,756
but you are never
talking to it again.

591
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:27,091
Do you understand?
Ever!

592
00:46:27,124 --> 00:46:28,393
Are you gonna take me home?

593
00:46:28,426 --> 00:46:30,794
No, goddammit,
for the hundredth time.

594
00:46:30,894 --> 00:46:32,430
We're not going home.

595
00:46:32,496 --> 00:46:33,831
Stop talking about that.

596
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:35,599
Then where are we going?

597
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:43,274
What am I supposed to do?

598
00:46:48,012 --> 00:46:51,115
What am I supposed to do?

599
00:46:55,753 --> 00:46:57,355
It's okay, Mom.

600
00:46:58,256 --> 00:46:59,257
She's gone.

601
00:47:00,924 --> 00:47:03,127
I'll tell her not
to bother you anymore.

602
00:47:04,762 --> 00:47:05,963
Okay?

603
00:47:05,996 --> 00:47:07,998
You should go to bed.
You're tired.

604
00:47:08,866 --> 00:47:12,504
I'll stay with you, okay?

605
00:47:12,603 --> 00:47:15,039
We'll be all right.

606
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:17,375
I promise.

607
00:47:17,475 --> 00:47:18,842
We're gonna be all right.

608
00:47:50,174 --> 00:47:52,076
You ready?

609
00:47:53,877 --> 00:47:56,180
Now, I want you
to give these out

610
00:47:56,214 --> 00:47:58,349
as soon as you get
to school, okay?

611
00:47:58,383 --> 00:47:59,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

612
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,387
Put 'em right in here.

613
00:48:17,701 --> 00:48:19,203
Hello, operator,

614
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:23,173
will you connect me with
St. Mary's church please?

615
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:24,775
Thank you.

616
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:25,876
Saint Mary's.

617
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:27,378
Sister Agnes speaking.

618
00:48:27,445 --> 00:48:28,612
Hi.

619
00:48:28,712 --> 00:48:31,382
I was wondering if there
might be someone available

620
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:34,252
to speak with me?

621
00:48:34,352 --> 00:48:36,053
I, I think...

622
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:41,392
I think I have a demon
or something in my house.

623
00:48:44,429 --> 00:48:47,232
Hello?

624
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:49,133
Hello?

625
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:16,594
Is Mr. Langtree available?

626
00:49:16,628 --> 00:49:19,631
Why, what'd you break this time?

627
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,432
Oh.
Nothing, nothing.

628
00:49:21,499 --> 00:49:23,268
I just, um...

629
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:27,338
I don't, I don't know
exactly how to say this.

630
00:49:27,438 --> 00:49:29,307
Well, just say it.

631
00:49:31,775 --> 00:49:33,110
Has anyone ever said

632
00:49:33,143 --> 00:49:37,282
that there's something
wrong with the house?

633
00:49:38,182 --> 00:49:40,585
What are you up to, missy?

634
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:42,986
What do you mean?

635
00:49:43,086 --> 00:49:44,797
Because you knew exactly
what you were getting into

636
00:49:44,821 --> 00:49:46,190
when you moved into the house.

637
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:48,626
So if you think that you
can come sashaying in here

638
00:49:48,692 --> 00:49:50,361
in that little skirt

639
00:49:50,461 --> 00:49:53,298
and con us into putting a whole
bunch of money into that place,

640
00:49:53,331 --> 00:49:55,466
my husband might be stupid
enough to fall for that,

641
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,534
but I'm not.

642
00:49:56,634 --> 00:49:58,369
I'm not trying to do anything.

643
00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:00,069
Well, I don't know
what you're doing here

644
00:50:00,137 --> 00:50:02,139
in the first place, unless
you're hiding something.

645
00:50:02,172 --> 00:50:04,475
I am trying to ask you...

646
00:50:05,976 --> 00:50:08,845
if there's a ghost in the house.

647
00:50:08,946 --> 00:50:10,615
A ghost!

648
00:50:10,648 --> 00:50:11,815
Is it drugs?

649
00:50:11,882 --> 00:50:13,784
No, no.

650
00:50:13,817 --> 00:50:15,486
I have a child.

651
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:24,061
Because if I get wind

652
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:26,196
that any of that crap
is going on in that house,

653
00:50:26,297 --> 00:50:28,165
I'm going to call the police,

654
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:32,503
and you can be sure of the fact they'll
take your child away from you.

Oh, we're going to hang them.

659
00:50:53,023 --> 00:50:55,058
I'm going to hang from here,

660
00:50:55,158 --> 00:50:57,662

Don't worry, I'm
sure they're coming.

684
00:52:36,294 --> 00:52:38,629
You know, I bet some
of them even got lost.

685
00:52:38,663 --> 00:52:41,865
And people love to
come late to parties.

686
00:52:41,965 --> 00:52:43,033
You'll see.

687
00:52:45,703 --> 00:52:47,505
Maybe I should give
a few of them a call.

688
00:52:47,605 --> 00:52:50,140
I think I have a class list
from the school in the kitchen.

689
00:52:50,173 --> 00:52:51,542
Be right back.

690
00:53:18,536 --> 00:53:20,371
I don't think they're
coming, buddy.

691
00:53:21,806 --> 00:53:23,674
I know.

692
00:53:23,741 --> 00:53:26,844
I don't want you to
take it personally, okay?

693
00:53:26,878 --> 00:53:28,646
We live really far out of town.

694
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:30,515
You know, some
people, they just,

695
00:53:30,581 --> 00:53:35,051
they can't spend the
time driving out here.

696
00:53:35,753 --> 00:53:37,688
Okay?

697
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:40,023
But hey, next year
we'll have your party

698
00:53:40,056 --> 00:53:42,560
at the malt shop
or the pizza parlor.

699
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,762
That'll be fun.

700
00:53:44,862 --> 00:53:46,697
Okay.

701
00:53:46,731 --> 00:53:50,234
Do you wanna open your presents?

702
00:53:50,334 --> 00:53:51,736
Not right now.

703
00:53:51,836 --> 00:53:54,004
I think I'm just
going to go upstairs.

704
00:53:54,037 --> 00:53:55,673
You sure?

705
00:53:55,706 --> 00:53:57,708
Okay.

706
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,890
Stop calling here, Scott.

707
00:54:12,956 --> 00:54:14,892
Please don't
hang up on me, Laura.

708
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:17,695
Please talk to me.

709
00:54:18,729 --> 00:54:21,064
I've said everything I
ever want to say to you.

710
00:54:21,131 --> 00:54:23,601
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

711
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:26,036
I miss you.
I miss my son.

712
00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:27,472
Well, you better get used to it

713
00:54:27,572 --> 00:54:29,807
because you'll never see
either one of us ever again.

714
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,450
And I love the way our
Hotpoint's designed too.

715
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,352
It could have been made for me.

716
00:55:15,286 --> 00:55:18,589
The interior arrangements
are all so practical.

717
00:56:21,919 --> 00:56:23,654
Cody!

718
00:56:23,688 --> 00:56:24,589
Why?

719
00:56:24,689 --> 00:56:26,156
Why didn't you hand these out?

720
00:56:26,189 --> 00:56:27,692
I spent all that time

721
00:56:27,725 --> 00:56:30,227
making a special day
for your birthday

722
00:56:30,328 --> 00:56:31,996
and you just sat there.

723
00:56:32,029 --> 00:56:34,665
You just sat there
and watched me do it.

724
00:56:34,699 --> 00:56:37,034
And you didn't even hand
out the invitations!

725
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,369
Why?

726
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:39,337
Why would you do that?

727
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:40,871
Cody.

728
00:56:40,938 --> 00:56:42,273
Cody, no.

729
00:56:42,373 --> 00:56:44,041
Cody, come back here.

730
00:56:46,844 --> 00:56:47,845
Cody,

731
00:56:47,878 --> 00:56:49,513
Cody,

732
00:56:49,547 --> 00:56:50,915
Cody, stop it right now.

733
00:56:51,015 --> 00:56:53,217
- Now, tell me!
- Because they wouldn't come.

734
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,286
You don't listen to me.
You don't listen to anyone!

735
00:56:55,386 --> 00:56:56,554
How would you know that?

736
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,555
You didn't even
give them a chance.

737
00:56:57,588 --> 00:56:58,389
Because I'm not like them.

738
00:56:58,422 --> 00:56:59,357
I hate it here.

739
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:00,858
I want to go home.

740
00:57:00,891 --> 00:57:02,893
We are not going back there.
Do you hear me?

741
00:57:05,863 --> 00:57:08,432
Cody.

742
00:57:11,736 --> 00:57:12,903
Cody, what...

743
00:57:12,937 --> 00:57:14,271
What is wrong with you?

744
00:57:14,372 --> 00:57:15,372
Cody, Cody,

745
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:16,307
please.

746
00:57:16,407 --> 00:57:17,742
I'm so sorry.

747
00:57:17,775 --> 00:57:19,310
Okay.

748
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,812
Breathe with Mommy.
Breathe, baby.

749
00:57:41,766 --> 00:57:43,467
If you start to feel bad again,

750
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:45,636
you just tell the teacher, okay?

751
00:57:45,736 --> 00:57:47,471
Okay.

752
00:58:05,456 --> 00:58:06,924
Laura.

753
00:58:09,427 --> 00:58:10,828
Laura.

754
00:58:13,998 --> 00:58:15,800
Laura!

755
00:58:15,833 --> 00:58:18,636
I need that new DM 40
on my desk in an hour.

756
00:58:20,805 --> 00:58:24,141
The DM4's the most
crucial form in the file.

757
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:26,477
Hey, Cody, how was your day?

758
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:29,146
- It was okay.
- Yeah?

759
00:58:33,317 --> 00:58:36,954
Cody, have you been
teasing those little girls?

760
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,291
No.

761
00:58:40,324 --> 00:58:41,726
Are you sure?

762
00:58:41,826 --> 00:58:43,160
Yes.

763
00:58:43,194 --> 00:58:46,130
'Cause I can see them
tattling on you to a teacher.

764
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:50,510
Do you want to give me
your side of the story

765
00:58:50,534 --> 00:58:52,169
before I get a call tonight?

766
00:58:52,203 --> 00:58:54,004
I didn't do anything.

767
00:58:54,638 --> 00:58:56,674
All right,
I'll wait for the call.

768
00:59:36,347 --> 00:59:38,015
Mrs. Langtree?

769
00:59:39,283 --> 00:59:41,452
Oh, oh, hello.

770
00:59:41,552 --> 00:59:44,355
I was just checking
on the appliances.

771
00:59:44,388 --> 00:59:46,123
- Really?
- Yeah.

772
00:59:46,224 --> 00:59:48,893
I don't think so.
I think you were snooping.

773
00:59:48,926 --> 00:59:51,462
Did you find the drugs
you were looking for?

774
00:59:51,562 --> 00:59:52,930
You know, this is my house

775
00:59:52,997 --> 00:59:54,674
so I can actually check
on it anytime I want.

776
00:59:54,698 --> 00:59:56,009
Not without my
permission, you can't.

777
00:59:56,033 --> 00:59:57,701
And if you'd like
to validate that,

778
00:59:57,735 --> 00:59:59,370
we can call the police.

779
00:59:59,403 --> 01:00:00,971
The police?

780
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:02,740
Mm-hmm.

781
01:00:03,407 --> 01:00:06,211
Is there something
wrong with you?

782
01:00:06,244 --> 01:00:09,247
Because I think there's
something terribly wrong

783
01:00:09,313 --> 01:00:10,648
going on in this house.

784
01:00:10,748 --> 01:00:11,715
Well, when you figure it out,

785
01:00:11,749 --> 01:00:13,384
will you give me a holler?

786
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:15,653
Because I would
just love to know.

787
01:00:15,753 --> 01:00:19,257
I want you out of this house.

788
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:21,425
You have 30 days.

789
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,093
Put it in writing.

790
01:00:23,127 --> 01:00:24,328
Oh, I will.

791
01:00:24,428 --> 01:00:26,298

01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:13,771
Cody.

819
01:02:28,585 --> 01:02:30,454
Hello.

820
01:02:30,554 --> 01:02:32,390
Where are you?

821
01:02:32,424 --> 01:02:33,724
I'm ready.

822
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,801
Cody?

823
01:02:45,202 --> 01:02:46,371
Cody?

824
01:02:47,738 --> 01:02:49,407
Cody, stop!

825
01:03:45,195 --> 01:03:47,131
Cody, Cody.

826
01:03:47,197 --> 01:03:48,366
Please breathe.

827
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:49,700
Breathe, baby.

828
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,504
There. That's right, baby.
That's right.

829
01:03:52,603 --> 01:03:53,804
You're okay.

830
01:03:53,837 --> 01:03:56,807
Oh, Cody. Cody.

831
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,447
Cody.

832
01:04:37,515 --> 01:04:39,250
I've had repeated complaints

833
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:42,353
about the DM 40 being filed
incorrectly or incomplete,

834
01:04:42,387 --> 01:04:45,689
not attaching your correspondence
to the proper files.

835
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,758
I'll try to get better at that.

836
01:04:47,858 --> 01:04:50,861
It's extremely important
that you maintain

837
01:04:50,894 --> 01:04:53,797
proper maintenance of the
files for the auditors.

838
01:04:53,897 --> 01:04:55,699
We're graded on accuracy.

839
01:04:55,766 --> 01:05:00,238
There're fines implemented if we
don't meet a certain standard.

840
01:05:00,338 --> 01:05:03,408
I understand.

841
01:05:03,508 --> 01:05:06,377
Laura, I have to ask you
a personal question.

842
01:05:07,744 --> 01:05:09,347
Have you been drinking?

843
01:05:10,614 --> 01:05:14,285
I know you have.
I can smell it.

844
01:05:14,385 --> 01:05:16,387
We don't tolerate
drinking on the job.

845
01:05:16,421 --> 01:05:18,755
That's clearly stated
in your employee handbook.

846
01:05:18,856 --> 01:05:20,391
Yes, it is.

847
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,260
I know because I read it.

848
01:05:25,363 --> 01:05:27,931
But I think that if you had
my job, you'd be drinking too.

849
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:30,901
You try leaving your
family and your friends

850
01:05:30,934 --> 01:05:32,403
and everything you've ever known

851
01:05:32,437 --> 01:05:35,306
to move to this small town
in the middle of nowhere,

852
01:05:35,406 --> 01:05:36,574
all by yourself,

853
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,910
simply because no one
gave you any other choice.

854
01:05:39,943 --> 01:05:41,912
Then talk to me about
drinking on the job.

855
01:05:41,945 --> 01:05:42,946
Laura, look.

856
01:05:43,046 --> 01:05:44,382
Or maybe there's
a company manual

857
01:05:44,415 --> 01:05:47,418
on how to get rid of a monster.

858
01:05:47,452 --> 01:05:50,087
And I'm not talking
about my ex-husband

859
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,492
or my entire
overwhelming situation.

860
01:05:54,592 --> 01:05:58,596
No, I am talking about
an actual monster

861
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:01,566
who comes into my house in
the middle of the night

862
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,966
and tries to drag my son out

863
01:06:03,066 --> 01:06:05,303
and drown him in
a pond out back.

864
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:10,275
I know you think I'm nuts.

865
01:06:10,308 --> 01:06:11,808
No.

866
01:06:11,909 --> 01:06:12,943
I don't think that.

867
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,646
I think you need help.

868
01:06:14,745 --> 01:06:15,979
I do not need help.

869
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,349
I have everything
completely under control.

870
01:06:18,449 --> 01:06:20,083
No, you don't.

871
01:06:20,117 --> 01:06:23,120
There's no reason we
can't help women like you.

872
01:06:23,153 --> 01:06:24,355
There's a number there.

873
01:06:24,455 --> 01:06:28,426
Call it, speak to
a nurse or counselor.

874
01:06:28,459 --> 01:06:33,897
Actually, I think
you should keep this

875
01:06:33,997 --> 01:06:35,108
because I don't want your help

876
01:06:35,132 --> 01:06:37,468
and I don't want
your miserable job.

877
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,936
Then go.

878
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:40,438
I'm gone, daddy-o.

Ginger Rogers.

893
01:07:23,715 --> 01:07:26,684
Your beer is empty.

894
01:07:26,718 --> 01:07:28,018
I'm going to buy you another.

895
01:07:28,051 --> 01:07:29,520
Bartender, can he have another?

896
01:07:29,554 --> 01:07:31,522
And can I have
another one of those?

897
01:07:31,556 --> 01:07:32,323
No, no, no, please.

898
01:07:32,357 --> 01:07:33,824
You, you don't buy me a drink.

899
01:07:33,857 --> 01:07:35,360
Come on, I'm celebrating.

900
01:07:35,393 --> 01:07:36,860
Oh, what are we celebrating?

901
01:07:36,893 --> 01:07:38,696
I quit my job today.

902
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:40,531
I hated it so I quit it.

903
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,065
Atta girl.

904
01:07:42,165 --> 01:07:43,501
I like your style.

905
01:07:43,534 --> 01:07:46,903
I'll tell you what,
I'll get you that drink

906
01:07:47,004 --> 01:07:49,840
if you come dance with me.

907
01:07:49,873 --> 01:07:51,542
Oh.

908
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,543
Come on.

909
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,379
One dance.

910
01:07:59,217 --> 01:08:00,585
You know this song?

911
01:08:00,685 --> 01:08:01,885
Mm-mm.

912
01:08:01,918 --> 01:08:04,955
Yeah, well,
it's old and forgotten.

913
01:08:05,055 --> 01:08:07,525
Kinda like me.

914
01:08:07,558 --> 01:08:08,959
But, you,

915
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:12,530
you are a pretty young thing

916
01:08:12,563 --> 01:08:16,267
in a pretty little
polka dot dress.

917
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:20,705
You look like an angel.

918
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:24,409
I mean like...

919
01:08:24,442 --> 01:08:27,578
like I died and went to heaven.

920
01:08:30,281 --> 01:08:31,582
I was an angel once

921
01:08:31,616 --> 01:08:34,117
in a play at church.

922
01:08:35,286 --> 01:08:39,257
My grandmother made me the
most beautiful angel wings.

923
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:42,460
I felt like I could
fly in those wings.

924
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,728
A girl like you,

925
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:46,431
you don't need wings to fly.

926
01:08:46,464 --> 01:08:48,098
No, I have a car.

927
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:50,601
Oh, well, that'll do.

928
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:51,669
That's pretty good.

929
01:08:52,437 --> 01:08:54,672
So what are you going
to do next, angel?

930
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:01,479
I don't know.

931
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:02,680
I don't know.

932
01:09:04,582 --> 01:09:05,350
Hey, hey, hey.

933
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:06,016
Don't cry.

934
01:09:06,116 --> 01:09:07,318
Don't cry.

935
01:09:07,418 --> 01:09:08,858
You're going to
figure something out.

936
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:13,624
I just wish I could
go somewhere else,

937
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,693
you know, somewhere new

938
01:09:15,793 --> 01:09:17,160
and start fresh.

939
01:09:17,261 --> 01:09:19,196
Just, just start over.

940
01:09:20,498 --> 01:09:22,800
Then you go,

941
01:09:22,834 --> 01:09:26,970
you dig out those pretty
little wings of yours

942
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:30,641
and you fly, fly, fly.

943
01:10:01,004 --> 01:10:02,206
Cody.

944
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:04,709
Do you know Cody Butler?

945
01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:05,849
Have you seen Cody Butler?

946
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:06,909
No.

947
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:10,046
Cody?

948
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:13,984
Do you know Cody Butler?

949
01:10:14,017 --> 01:10:16,854
Hey, do you know Cody Butler?

950
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,357
Cody?

951
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:22,427
Hey, hey, do you
know Cody Butler?

952
01:10:22,527 --> 01:10:24,194
No?

953
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:30,033
Have you seen Cody Butler?

954
01:10:36,374 --> 01:10:37,442
How are you today, ma'am?

955
01:10:37,542 --> 01:10:40,244
Officer, I came
to pick up my son

956
01:10:40,344 --> 01:10:41,746
and I can't find him anywhere.

957
01:10:41,846 --> 01:10:43,381
Okay, okay.
It's all right, ma'am.

958
01:10:43,414 --> 01:10:44,715
What's your son's name?

959
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,049
His name is Cody Butler.

960
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,352
He's a second grade student.

961
01:10:48,386 --> 01:10:50,221
I'm afraid that my ex-husband

962
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,390
has taken him
without my knowledge.

963
01:10:52,423 --> 01:10:55,593
Okay, well, we're going to get to
the bottom of this, okay? - Okay.

964
01:10:55,693 --> 01:10:57,204
Do you, do you
have any identification?

965
01:10:57,228 --> 01:10:58,529
For Cody?

966
01:10:58,563 --> 01:11:00,096
No, ma'am, your identification.

967
01:11:05,903 --> 01:11:07,070
Hi, Laura.

968
01:11:07,103 --> 01:11:08,439
I'm Barb Schiff.

969
01:11:08,539 --> 01:11:10,308
I'm a caseworker
with the department.

970
01:11:10,408 --> 01:11:12,243
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get here.

971
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,745
How are you?

972
01:11:14,779 --> 01:11:16,247
Where is Cody?

973
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:18,392
I went to school to pick
him up and he was not there.

974
01:11:18,416 --> 01:11:19,884
No, he wasn't.

975
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:23,119
Where do you think he is?

976
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:24,322
Does his dad have him?

977
01:11:24,422 --> 01:11:26,591
No, he doesn't.

978
01:11:26,624 --> 01:11:28,091
How do you know?

979
01:11:28,124 --> 01:11:29,660
Did you call him?

980
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,062
I didn't need to.

981
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,932
What do you mean?

982
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:37,435
Laura,

983
01:11:37,468 --> 01:11:40,505
would you mind if we
backed up a little bit?

984
01:11:40,605 --> 01:11:42,607
I think I could be of more help

985
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:45,977
if I understood the
details of Cody's accident.

986
01:11:46,076 --> 01:11:50,681
I'm referring to the accident
last year in Arizona.

987
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,285
Oh.

988
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:56,854
Well, that was nothing.

989
01:11:56,954 --> 01:11:58,856
He fell in the pool.

990
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,160
I wasn't there.

991
01:12:04,262 --> 01:12:07,398
I had to go to
the grocery store.

992
01:12:07,498 --> 01:12:10,535
His father was watching him.

993
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,641
When I came home, Scott was on
the couch, watching the game

994
01:12:16,674 --> 01:12:18,476
and I went into the kitchen

995
01:12:18,509 --> 01:12:22,880
and I had this weird feeling
like something wrong.

996
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,315
And I was standing at the sink

997
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:26,102
and I was looking out
the window at the pool

998
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:28,219
and I thought I saw
something in it.

999
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:32,657
When I went out to check,
I saw that it was him.

1000
01:12:33,457 --> 01:12:37,395
And then what happened?

1001
01:12:38,496 --> 01:12:40,898
Well, I dragged him out

1002
01:12:40,998 --> 01:12:42,198
and I performed CPR on him

1003
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,001
until the paramedics came

1004
01:12:44,067 --> 01:12:48,673
and then they revived him
and he was completely okay.

1005
01:12:51,676 --> 01:12:53,244
Why?

1006
01:12:54,077 --> 01:12:56,414
Are you saying there's
something wrong with him

1007
01:12:56,514 --> 01:12:58,148
because of what happened?

1008
01:12:58,181 --> 01:13:00,083
No, that is not what I'm saying.

1009
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,438
It's okay, Laura.

1010
01:13:20,538 --> 01:13:22,506
You're all right.

1011
01:13:31,549 --> 01:13:34,051
I think I need some water.

1012
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,921
Okay.

1013
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:38,021
You sit tight.

1014
01:13:38,055 --> 01:13:39,357
I'll get you one.

01:16:56,754 --> 01:16:59,456
- Cody, where are you?

1024
01:16:59,557 --> 01:17:01,425
Cody! Cody.

1025
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:03,160
What happened?

1026
01:17:03,261 --> 01:17:04,762
Where have you been?

1027
01:17:04,795 --> 01:17:07,998
Honey, why didn't you wait for
me to pick you up from school?

1028
01:17:08,098 --> 01:17:11,001
It's time
for me to go home, Mom.

1029
01:17:11,101 --> 01:17:12,603
No, no, no.

1030
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,738
I'm going to take you
somewhere else, okay?

1031
01:17:14,772 --> 01:17:15,916
I'm going to take
you away from here.

1032
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,608
That's what you want, right?

1033
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,510
We're going to pack up the car

1034
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:21,279
and we're going to go
somewhere brand new

1035
01:17:21,313 --> 01:17:23,814
and we're going to have
a fresh start, okay?

1036
01:17:23,914 --> 01:17:25,416
Okay?

1037
01:17:25,449 --> 01:17:28,352
I don't want to.

1038
01:17:28,452 --> 01:17:31,655
Well, you have to.
Mommy says.

1039
01:17:31,755 --> 01:17:36,160
So go upstairs
and pack up your stuff.

1040
01:17:41,832 --> 01:17:43,634
Cody, where are you going?

1041
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:45,303
- I'm not going.
- No. No.

1042
01:17:45,337 --> 01:17:46,338
- Please.
- No!

1043
01:17:46,437 --> 01:17:47,671
Please, let me...!

1044
01:17:47,771 --> 01:17:51,642
- Cody, go upstairs.
- Please, let me go!

1045
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:52,977
- Cody!
- Please!

1046
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:56,180
No! Cody! Stop it!
Stop it!

1047
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,552
I'm so sorry.

1048
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:11,356
Cody, Cody, Cody.

1049
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,134
Cody.

1050
01:19:27,204 --> 01:19:29,073
Cody.

1051
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:32,476
Cody, please don't leave me.

1052
01:19:32,576 --> 01:19:37,147
I want to go with
the pretty lady.

1053
01:19:37,248 --> 01:19:38,615
No, no.

1054
01:19:38,716 --> 01:19:40,117
Don't say that.

1055
01:19:40,218 --> 01:19:41,419
Don't say that.

1056
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:46,056
You want to stay here with me.

1057
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:49,394
You have to let me go, Mom.

1058
01:19:49,427 --> 01:19:51,396
Why?

1059
01:19:54,466 --> 01:19:57,601
It wasn't your fault, Mom.

1060
01:20:00,438 --> 01:20:01,439
It wasn't on purpose.

1061
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:02,606
It was an accident.

1062
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:03,741
It's okay.

1063
01:20:03,774 --> 01:20:04,842
It's not okay.

1064
01:20:04,942 --> 01:20:07,245
It will be, you'll see.

1065
01:20:07,278 --> 01:20:12,016
Please, Cody, I don't
want you to leave me.

1066
01:20:12,116 --> 01:20:14,752
You have to let me go, Mom.

1067
01:20:14,785 --> 01:20:17,588
Please. Please.

1068
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,134
I can't believe she did this.

1069
01:23:17,167 --> 01:23:18,835
The pipe burst.

1070
01:23:18,936 --> 01:23:21,339
She broke it, Jim.

1071
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:22,640
What's that?

1072
01:23:22,674 --> 01:23:24,442
Jim, Jim.

1073
01:23:24,475 --> 01:23:26,444
Jim, what's that piece of paper?

1074
01:23:26,477 --> 01:23:28,279
