And besides, I've booby-trapped

162
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,579
the vents with
heavy explosives.

163
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,084
Come on down!
Get out of there!

164
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,754
[crowd booing]

165
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:36,593
Grimm: God, I hate this town.

166
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:42,724
Ah, let's see if we can make
a deal here, Chip. Uh, Skip.

167
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:44,685
I'd like to get
those people out of there.

168
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,019
Fine.

169
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:49,022
I want a city bus

170
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:51,483
with a full tank of gas.

171
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,112
I want, um,
a Harley-Davidson XL1000.

172
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:00,284
- I want a monster truck.
- A what?

173
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,828
And I want two
Jet Ranger helicopters

174
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,413
here on the street.

175
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,460
I'll get you the choppers,
I'll get you the bus, the Harley

176
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:13,505
and the, uh, the monster truck
just as soon as

177
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,674
you give me the damn hostages.

178
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,343
Oh, yeah, I'm sure
no harm will come to me

179
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,763
once I'm inside the bank
all by myself.

180
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,225
- At least give me the women.
- Get your own women.

181
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:27,769
Grimm on phone:
One hostage per demand.

182
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:32,191
One? Listen, I've had just about
enough of your comedy, clown.

183
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:33,901
We're coming in
through the plate glass.

184
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,195
Alright,
I gotta hang up now

185
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,697
because I gotta go
kill everybody, okay?

186
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,742
Don't bust my chops, wise guy.
It's not that easy.

187
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,785
It takes time to find
two Jet Cruisers,

188
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:46,622
and pilots who are willing
to fly out an armed felon.

189
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:48,290
I don't need a pilot.

190
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,959
Now, you got 30 minutes
to meet my first demand.

191
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:54,796
- What's your number out there?
- 259-0660.

192
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,423
Don't try anything rash,
or you're dead

193
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,799
along with everyone else.

194
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,092
6-0?

195
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,678
And that's here
in area code 212?

196
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:03,764
Oh...

197
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,768
Alright. Do what he says, the
chopper and the bus, everything.

198
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,062
Set them up out here
as soon as they arrive.

199
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,524
Is it a diversion, chief,
or is he crazy?

200
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:16,610
He's not crazy,
he'll come out of that bank

201
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,738
with a few hostages
also dressed as clowns.

202
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,573
He'll make a run
for one of the choppers

203
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,992
assuming we're afraid
to shoot down a hostage.

204
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,285
Are we?

205
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:27,621
He said no pilots.

206
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,164
That means he's flying it.

207
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,916
Probably learned how in 'Nam.

208
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,377
Now, they'll get a bead
on whichever clown

209
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:35,504
takes the controls
and take him out

210
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,839
before he even
leaves the ground.

211
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,216
Here he comes.

212
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,428
- He's gonna let one of us go.
- Oldest first.

213
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:45,806
That makes sense, save the one
who will die first

214
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,266
of natural causes.

215
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:48,433
You prick.

216
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:50,852
I'm gonna vomit.

217
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,854
We better get him
out of here first.

218
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:55,148
- No way!
- The hell with him.

219
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,113
It's been decided.
I'm the first to go.

220
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,614
- What?
- Hey, come on.

221
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,575
- Who decided it?
- I did.

222
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:09,746
It really isn't your decision,
Mr. Adolf Hitler.

223
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:11,665
Have you got my money
ready back there?

224
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,041
It's here.

225

They're meeting my first demand.

229
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,567
Alright, to show this
fascist dictator here

230
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,653
how our system works,
I'm gonna let you folks decide

231
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,363
who's gonna be
the first to go.

232
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,614
- Him!
- Him!

[clamoring]

00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,785
- Him?
- Yes!

Let's... Come on. Come on.

236
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,709
Let's go, you...
Get downwind of me.

237
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,295
Ooh.

Sir, is human life at stake?

The stink of death
was in the air.

He said he knew how to make men
sit up and bark!

Oh, don't exaggerate
or anything.

248
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:53,558
And so we have our first report
from inside the bank.

249
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:56,061
Our first description
of this clown

250

at whom no one is laughing.

251

Whoo!
Now, that's original.

the last hostage is released.

Can it. Here comes Clarabelle.

- Hi.
- Hi.

256
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,708
Whoa.

257
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:25,215
- What's this?
- It's, uh, just a gift.

258
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,009
Okay, it's an Audemars Piguet.

259
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:31,263
Moon phase, 18-karat gold,
alligator band.

260
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,015
Thing cost me 12,000, but it
keeps appreciating every day.

261
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:36,560
As I say,
it's, it's my gift to you.

262
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:40,981
- Boy, it is nice.
- Isn't it?

263
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,817
- I can't keep this.
- Oh, don't be silly.

264
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:46,820
No, I would be beholden.

265
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,617
May I buy it?

266
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:55,287
I mean, would you take
three bills for it?

267
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,830
Three hundred dollars?

268
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,582
Well, unless someone wants
to make a higher offer.

269
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:01,376
Does anyone want to go higher
than 300 on this?

270
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,004
It's got a moon on it.

271
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,589
Great. And here's my watch.

272
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,215
It's a Timex...

273
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:10,177
and the band is the
Twist-o-Flex by Speidel.

274
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:13,680
I appreciate this damn thing
more and more every day.

275
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:23,398
You... pig.

276
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,984
Excuse me? Ha-ha. Pig?

277
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,988
I doubt it. Think the lady
protests too much, or what?

278
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:34,951
I think you're just afraid
to party with a real man.

279
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:38,371
A real man,
who has to use a gun...

280
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:42,042
who has to dress up like that
and... and keep people prisoner?

281
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,169
You're not a man.

282
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,338
You're a coward.

283
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,131
Oh, oh, no. No!

[laughs]

285
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,178
She... She does not speak
for the rest of us, Mr. Clown.

286
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,890
We think you're quite brave.
And... and manly.

287
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,018
You big pussy!
I don't believe you.

288
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,686
You're all a bunch of pussies.

289
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:03,355
Why don't you take her out next?

290
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,815
You don't need
this kind of aggravation.

- Hey, chief.
- Yeah?

295
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,039
On the bus, we've got
an ex-Green Beret

296
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,041
stashed under the back seat.
In the motorcycle,

297
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,418
we got exactly enough gas
to carry it half a mile.

298
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:26,836
We stationed
our sharp-shooters

299
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,630
a half-mile in every
possible direction.

300
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,383
- Any word on the monster truck?
- Yeah, about half an hour.

301
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,385
Did the hostage give you a
description of the perpetrator?

302
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,472
Yeah. Average height, average
build, red nose and blue hair.

303
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:41,017
Thanks.

Thank you for using AT&T.

Your bike's out here
and so's your bus.

307
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,406
- You owe me two more hostages.
Grimm on phone: They're coming.

308
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,366
Tell me when my monster truck
gets here.

00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:41,369
He's peeking at us
through the curtains.

319
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:47,709
The man is an animal.

320
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,796
I mean, ripping out phones,
urinating on desks.

321
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:53,757
You see what he did
to Miss Cochran's shirt?

322
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:55,258
There's a scratch here.

323
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,719
I mean, it's not deep,
but it's there.

324
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,512
It's okay.

325
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,097
Did he hurt anybody else?

326
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,932
Is the strain
beginning to show on him?

327
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:05,685
"If I could sleep ten days
and nights in a rice paddy,

328
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:08,396
I could certainly
last in this lousy bank."

329
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:10,148
This is what the animal
said to us.

330
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,233
He says to Miss Cochran here,

331
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,820
"Baby, up your butt
with a coconut."

332
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:18,365
I think he was prepared
to do it,

333
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,241
except I saw no coconut.

334
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:22,535
Yeah, he had no coconut
to my knowledge.

335
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:24,371
No coconut, huh?

336
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:26,539
What about dynamite?
Did you see any?

337
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:28,833
Any? It's everywhere.

338
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,503
I... it's on him. It's on us.

to tables as shields.

340

00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:38,385
He's sick.

- Officer Martin?
- Yes, sir.

345
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:49,187
Take these two to the doctor,
just as a precaution.

346
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,563
Martin: Yes, sir.

347
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:56,486
- The key is, he's an animal.
- That much is clear, sir.

348
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,238
Oh, so I'm repeating myself.

349
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,740
I suppose you want to just
throw me back in there with him.

give me a little more time?

I, I promise
I won't hurt anybody...

I'll call you right back.
I promise.

Guys!

375
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:27,720
Phyllis, you were
so great back there.

376
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:29,681
I felt like you were
protecting me for real.

377
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,516
Well, because I couldn't tell
if you were pretending.

378
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,351
- You were really good.
- Yeah, it's true.

379

Let's see Miss Meryl Streep
try to vomit on cue, huh?

Loomis, could we have
two seconds alone?

00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,280
- Sure, Grimm.
- Thanks.

I can't believe we did it.

00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,422
Do you remember the night
you proposed?

387
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,674
- Proposed?
- Yeah.

388
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,843
Oh, you mean the night
that the pipes froze

389
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,555
and the heat went out?
And as we lay there freezing,

390
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:14,392
waiting to be discovered dead,
you gave me that look.

391
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,437
That look a woman
gives her man that says,

392
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,564
"I blame you for everything."

393
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,984
Yeah, that look.

394
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,528
And I said to you, "Phyllis,
before we lose our self-respect,

00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,072
let's make a commitment.
Let's not be the Bickersons,

I know a way.

00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,748
Phyllis, will you
rob a bank with me?"

399
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,459
I will, Grimm. I will.

400
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,508
Grimm...

401
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:50,511
I have to tell you something.

402
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:52,889
Uh, I... I found
something out yesterday.

403

What? What is it?

404
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:59,312
I just feel funny.

405
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,690
I feel... You know,
I feel complete.

406
00:24:02,857 --> 00:24:04,984
Grimm, you already
were complete.

407
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:06,527
You know, if you were
any more complete,

408
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:07,946
it would be a little scary.

Maybe this is a bad neighborhood

412
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:19,457
for getting in touch
with our feelings.

413
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,793
Yeah, especially with a fortune
in our falsies.

414
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,504
Alright, I gotta make
a quick call to the chief.

415
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:29,550
- This is Rotzinger.
Grimm on phone: Yes.

416
00:24:29,717 --> 00:24:32,261
Have you got
Prince Albert in a can?

Feeling better, I see.

Your Macho Maniac is here.
You owe me another hostage.

Grimm on phone: Alright,
I gotta check it out.

420
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,355
I'm going over to the window.
Tell your men to get back.

421
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:48,319
Did you have
something to tell me?

00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,988
I want to wait.

423
00:24:52,615 --> 00:24:53,992
I can see from right here
it doesn't have

424
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:56,077
a hydraulic tilt body.
It's unacceptable.

425

Rotzinger on phone:
What? You son of a bitch.

426
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,163
You never said a goddamn word

427
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,749
about a "tilting
hydraulic body."

428
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:04,961
We had to send all the way to
Jersey for this goddamn thing.

Now, you get me
a respectable monster truck

They would have waited forever
to go into that bank.

Just throw me out of the car
and run me over.

00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:00,850
I could have called them from
anywhere in the world tonight

443
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,186
just to tell them
I was still in the bank.

and don't get back to me
until you do, okay?

447
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:23,790
There it is, a beep.

448
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:25,500
Can you isolate that beep
with this equipment?

449
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:28,169
- I can try.
- I... it could be a horn.

Clowns carry horns,
like those little rubber ones.

00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,340
Sometimes their noses are horns.

I wanna know what beeped, fast,
because I'll tell you

what I think it was goddamn it.

454
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:37,553
And it wasn't his fucking nose.

455

It was a car horn.

Phyllis: How much time
did we lose, exactly?

457
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:50,650
They won't storm the bank until
they're sure I'm not there,

458
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,527
and then there's
the period of chaos

while they round up the hostages

460
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,447
and take statements
and names and...

461
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,950
Finally, they'll realize
some are missing.

- By then...
- Our plane is taking off?

won't know who we are.

scouted this neighborhood.

469
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,017
Did we miss the expressway?

I didn't see it.

00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:14,525
Wow, you know, jeez,
we don't know where that is.

478
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:17,862
- Shut up!
. Hey, you shut up!

479
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,364
- Shut up!
Man 4: Shut up! Shut up!

480
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:22,074
Let's just
walk through this, okay?

481
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:24,535
Does that sign say BQE?

482
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,787
Yeah.

483
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:29,874
Okay, so which way
was the arrow pointing?

484
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,709
That was an hour ago,

485
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,128
and that witch ain't stopped
screaming the whole time.

486
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,840
Man 4: Yeah. She even had
her baby screaming at us.

487
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,843
Alright, let me try this, will
you be putting up a new sign?

488
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,721
- Not today.
- Today's just taking shit down.

489
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,599
Can you tell us anything?

490
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,769
The names of a street,
any street?

491
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,730
- The directions, north, south?
- It's not our neighborhood.

492
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,191
Honey, babe.

493
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,692
You've got a gun. Shoot them.

494
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:58,527
I want to,
but they're fur-bearing.

495
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:01,405
I'd need some kind of permit,
wouldn't I?

496
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:03,616
Say, I want to thank you guys,
you could've given us help,

497
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,534
but you've given us
so much more.

498
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,912
Hey, that's what
we're here for, right?

499
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,459
I'm glad this happened.

500
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,794
It's just another
little reminder

501
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,587
of why we pulled this thing.

502
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,214
You know what their problem is?

503
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,175
They live here, that's all.

504
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,053
But we don't. Not anymore.

505
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,139
How hot does this baby burn?

506
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:32,311
Anybody find a watch out there?

507
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:34,230
Chief, did you really
send men into the sewer?

508
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,898
Man 5: Are you grasping
at straws, chief?

509
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,817
How much time was wasted
in the sewer?

510
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,902
Where do you guys
get this stuff?

511

in the bus to save time.

513
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,505
He's getting farther away
every second.

514
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,970
Oh, we're really
making progress now.

515
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,723
I saw a sign, Phyllis.

[instrumental music]

Grimm: If we could just
find a landmark.

518
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:39,045
Grimm: Ask this guy.

519
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,802
Excuse me. Sir?

520
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,766
Sir? Excuse me.

[singing continues]

527
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:40,481
It's bad luck just seeing
a thing like that.

528
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,368
Things are going to hell,
aren't they?

529
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,287
Knock it off. It's just a couple
of guys sorting out some things.

530
00:31:55,454 --> 00:31:57,373
Now we're gonna find
a familiar street soon.

531
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,292
I'd settle
for a familiar borough.

532
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:03,629
I think we're... we're near
John Philip Sousa.

533
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,674
That was our junior high school.
Aren't we, Grimm?

534
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,468
Not unless there's been an
H-bomb mishap since prom.

Can you help us find the BQE?

00:32:21,313 --> 00:32:23,858
Glad to. Got a map
right here in the glove.

538

Loomis: Oh!

539
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:37,288
Wait a minute.
This guy's too wonderful.

540
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,249
- So?
- So definitely a felon.

541
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,835
Dangerous.
Probably a serial killer.

542
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,588
Oh... Maybe he's just
from out of town.

543
00:32:45,754 --> 00:32:47,590
[Loomis chuckles]

544
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:50,676
- He is. He's got Iowa plates.
- There you go.

545
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:59,518
Where was
the Clutter family from?

546
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:02,104
- Kansas.
Grimm: Just checking.

547
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,024
Say, the bank was really
beautiful, wasn't it?

548
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,654
It sure was, Grimm.

549
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,914
Hey, Phyllis.

550
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,625
Grimm needs a little reassuring.

551
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:24,210
No, he doesn't.

552
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,837
He's complete now.

553
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,716
- There you are.
- Great.

554
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,843
Great. Thank you.

555
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,221
Hey, is everybody
this nice in Iowa?

556
00:33:35,387 --> 00:33:37,264
- Iowa?
- Yeah.

557
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:39,767
Oh! Well, that's a stolen car.

558
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,313
Grimm doesn't seem
any different to you, does he?

559
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,483
Well, yesterday,
he was just a guy

560
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,152
working in the
Department of City Planning.

561
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:55,074
And today, he's a
world-class bank robber.

562
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,368
Thank you, Loomis.
You're very comforting.

563
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:00,788
Oh, this is a fucking nightmare.

564
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,498
He doesn't even know
the capital of Iowa.

565
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,874
Shut up.

566
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:08,963
Wow. This must be my lucky day.

567
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:11,048
You got some real money here.

568
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:19,098
Four dollars?

569
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,892
Well, I couldn't
get to the bank today.

570
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,561
Let me give you this watch.

571
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:25,813
It's worth $12,000.
I talked the guy down.

572
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,691
He ended up giving it to me
for 300, but nice, huh?

573
00:34:28,857 --> 00:34:31,986
God, are you a sucker.
Let's see what's in the trunk.

574
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,875
Thanks. Bye-bye.

575
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,342
Oh, sir, you,
you forgot your map.

576
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:57,261
And our million dollars.

577
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:03,017
- Was it Dubuque?
- Des Moines.

578
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:05,477
Now can we go to the airport?

579
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:07,563
In the clothes
we wore out of the bank?

580
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,567
Flatbush is 15 minutes
from here.

581
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,153
We'll stop at Woolworth's.
The sky's the limit, baby.

582
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,989
You know, I... if Albert Einstein
here hadn't honked the horn,

583
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,116
we could've changed our clothes
before they were stolen.

584
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,618
It was an accident, Phyllis.

585
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:22,703
Oh, you know, so was Chernobyl.

586
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,788
True. But Loomis didn't
irradiate anybody.

587
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:26,081
Yeah.

588
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,751
Ow!

589
00:35:30,669 --> 00:35:32,755
- Grimm, make her stop it.
- Hey, don't you worry about it.

590
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:35,424
When I hit you, you can
start worrying. And you.

591
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,800
What are you hitting him for

592
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:37,968
when you really want
to be hitting me?

593
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:39,428
What are you talking about?

594
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,055
I don't know,
something's bothering you.

595
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:42,431
I remember.

596
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,893
Okay, yeah.

597
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,395
I... I was trying to tell you
something...

598
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:50,481
Shouldn't we be going?

599
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:54,985
Alright, let's go. Come on.

600
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,154
- Alright. Straight ahead.
- Right, Grimm.

601
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,323
Grimm: I'm glad
the son of a bitch robbed us.

602
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,241
It's just another reminder

603
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,495
of how happy and lucky we are
to be getting out of here.

604
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,080
Okay, but not Woolworth's.

605
00:36:06,246 --> 00:36:08,248
You said we should see
as few people as possible.

606
00:36:08,415 --> 00:36:09,958
We'll go to my apartment,
I left some clothes there

607
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,669
for the super,
men's and women's.

608
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:13,212
Grimm: Right, that's better,
it's closer.

609
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,005
Take the next big left.

610
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:18,801
Men's clothes. Whose?

611
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:21,553
Barry Meyers.
I mentioned him.

612
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,848
A guy I should have married.
A guy who wasn't certifiable.

613
00:36:35,442 --> 00:36:38,153
Come off it, pal.

614
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,988
I want to thank you
for getting us out alive.

615
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:42,908
The owners of the bank
want me to tell you

616
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:46,370
not to expect
any cooperation from them.

617
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,580
Uh, and I think they're gonna
kill you with the press too.

618
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:51,583
They say that
if the clown gets away,

619
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,085
they owe it to their
shareholders

620
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,671
to let the abject humiliation

621
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,590
of this whole thing
fall on a public official.

622
00:36:58,757 --> 00:37:00,718
How many shareholders are there?

623
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:03,470
Uh, just the three, I think.

624
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:06,223
But thank you very much.
We really appreciate it.

625
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,933
See you on the bus.

Rotzinger: Oh, my God.
Now this one's going.

628
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,609
Tear them down no matter
how great they were.

629
00:37:17,776 --> 00:37:19,153
Chief.

630
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:20,946
The Peruvian Connection.

631
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,782
The Subway Psycho.

632
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:26,660
People are gonna remember
what you've done.

633
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,913
Now what's so memorable about a
clown stealing $1 million?

635
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,543
Jesus, we gotta get this guy.

636
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:40,799
Look at this.

637
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,638
Why do they have to do this?

638
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,312
Well, what do I care?
It's not my life's work anymore.

639
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:57,149
Hey, Grimm, you tried.
You're a good person.

640
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:02,070
Caring, faithful, concerned.
Aren't you?

641
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:04,114
Hey, Phyllis, where do
you park around here?

642
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,574
Just park by the hydrant.

643
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,034
The hydrant?

644
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,954
I'll pay the ticket.

645
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:13,499
I can't believe the new tenants
dumped this stuff here.

646
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:15,083
They're not supposed to move in
till Tuesday.

647
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,377
Well, we should be
out of here by then.

648
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:22,382
Here, here,
give me your sleeve.

649
00:38:22,549 --> 00:38:24,051
Come on, is that
really necessary?

650
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,094
We're gonna miss out on
the complimentary beverage.

651
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:29,264
Do you want to stand out
at the airport? Barry was 6'4".

652
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:30,724
Pituitary problem?

653
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,226
Hey, look at this, guys.

654
00:38:32,392 --> 00:38:33,852
I'm gonna get me one of these.

655
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:35,979
Get yourself three.

656
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:38,982
It sure would be less itchy
if there's no X-ray machines.

657
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:41,360
So we could just carry the dough
in a suitcase, you know.

658
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,738
Those darn terrorists who made
it tough on us bank robbers.

659
00:38:46,865 --> 00:38:48,700
It's a pretty nice jacket.

660
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:51,662
Why did Barry leave this behind?
Why didn't he take it with him?

661
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,247
Uh, too rich to care.

662
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:55,541
Loomis: There's smoke
across the street.

663
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:56,792
How did he make his money,
anyway?

664
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,127
Terminally boring banker-type?

665
00:38:59,294 --> 00:39:01,255
Loomis: It's black smoke.

666
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:04,174
Mafia kingpin? Amway?

667
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,635
Pimp?

668
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:10,138
- Oh, no.
Grimm: What, cops?

669
00:39:10,305 --> 00:39:11,974
Loomis: No, fire engine.
Grimm: The hydrant.

670
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,225
- Give me your keys.
- Huh?

671
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,935
- Keys. Keys.
- Here.

672
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:16,937
Phyllis: Grimm.

673
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:30,075
- Get your hands up.
- You must be Mr. Edison.

674
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,244
Get them up!

675
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,787
Uh, Mr. Edison,
I'm Phyllis Potter,

676
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,289
and this is my apartment.

677
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:36,915
We were ripped off
three times in the village

678
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:38,792
and it's not gonna happen here.

679
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,753
Do we look like criminals?
D... do we look like people

680
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,755
that are capable of
committing a crime?

681
00:39:43,922 --> 00:39:45,215
I only know what I saw.

682
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:47,175
When my wife gets here,
she'll go call the cops

683
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:49,469
and we'll let them decide. Now
turn around, face the window.

684
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:51,430
Okay, but it's still
our apartment.

685
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,891
We'll have to have you arrested.

686
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:55,642
Loomis: Oh, Jesus.

687
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:58,353
Grimm, our plane takes off
in 41 minutes.

688
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,982
Quiet. No codes.

689
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:05,736
Hey, honey.
Ready to celebrate?

690
00:40:06,486 --> 00:40:07,905
Oh, my God.

691
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:10,073
They were ripping off the TV
when I came in.

692
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,992
No, I was touching it.
Kill me.

693
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,120
- Turn around.
Woman 2: Oh, great, Hal.

694
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,997
For once, it was gonna be fun.

695
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,790
We were gonna eat on the floor,

696
00:40:18,957 --> 00:40:22,169
drink champagne,
listen to old records.

697
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,212
Why are you blaming me?

698
00:40:24,379 --> 00:40:27,424
We haven't even moved the bed
in, and already it's the same.

699
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,927
Now give credit
where it's due, Mrs. Edison.

700
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:31,929
Hal made the commitment,
didn't he?

701
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:33,764
He gave up the rent-controlled
place in the village.

702
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,265
Do you know him?

703
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:38,143
He's paying $1500
for a one-bedroom.

704
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:42,606
Fifteen hundred? Try $2600.

705
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,901
You... You weren't paying $1500,
were you?

706
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,488
- We were paying $1260.
Woman 2: Twelve-sixty?

707
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,114
Excuse me, I don't know
you very well,

708
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:54,076
but you must be crazy
if you gave this place up.

709
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:56,286
Maybe we are crazy.

710
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:59,206
We bought a farmhouse,
near Woodstock.

711
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,250
It's rustic, kind of a fixer.

712
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:04,461
But the payments
are $300 a month.

713
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,422
We just had to try.

714
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:13,595
I suppose you don't believe
that either, Edison!

715
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,764
That people would go
and do a thing like that!

716
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,685
For your information,
I was at Woodstock.

717
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,021
I don't judge you, Hal.

718
00:41:23,188 --> 00:41:25,399
Really, I don't.

719
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:29,528
But from Woodstock
to Charles Bronson in 20 years?

720
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,530
Good one.

721
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,868
Look.

722
00:41:38,578 --> 00:41:39,913
Man 6: Grab it! Grab it!

723
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,333
Oh, damn it.

726
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,893
You can shoot us now.

727
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,979
Hal: I've put the gun down.

728
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,565
No hard feelings?

729
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,527
These are the names and numbers

730
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,904
and preliminary statements
of the hostages.

731
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:16,992
"Clown seemed harmless until
he harassed blond hostage."

732
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,077
Yes, sir, apparently, he made
some sexual overtures,

733
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:20,662
and things like that.

734
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,459
I don't see her.

735
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:28,545
- Don't see who?
- The blond. Where is she?

736
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,217
I was talking to her myself
when she first came out.

737
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:35,927
All the hostages are here, sir.

738
00:42:36,094 --> 00:42:37,137
They're all here, chief.

739
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,766
No. Where's the whiny guy?

740
00:42:40,932 --> 00:42:42,601
[imitates Grimm]
"He's an animal."

741
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,728
[normal voice]
The one that came out with her.

742
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,230
They were the second
and third ones out.

743
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,861
Oh, Jesus.

744
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,201
The lumberjack-lookin' guy,
he was the first one out.

745
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:00,994
I guess in all that chaos,
a few wandered away...

746
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,662
- It was utter chaos, chief.
- Yeah.

747
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:04,915
But we got everybody's name
and telephone number.

748
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,666
Martin: We got all that stuff.
- Yeah, yeah.

749
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:09,002
Get me the news footage
on those three hostages

750
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,421
who were released. Right.

751
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:13,298
Then I said,
"It's all over, Chuckles."

752
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,008
And wrestled him to the floor.

753
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,052
But he got some gal in his
sights, and I had to let up.

754
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,679
That's when he coldcocked me.
Son of a bitch.

755
00:43:19,846 --> 00:43:21,431
Come on, now look at
some of this videotape with me

756
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:23,683
so we can put out
an APB on these robbers.

757
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,811
- Robbers, plural?
- They all coldcocked me.

758
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:28,271
Three of them out there,
shouting with glee.

759

Grimm: Taxi!
Phyllis: Taxi!

760
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:31,274
Grimm: Please!
Phyllis: Taxi!

761
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:33,652
Loomis: $10,000 for a taxi!

762
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,946
Phyllis: And a blowjob!

763
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:40,325
Alright, can we just calm down
a little, please?

764
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,660
We'll never make the flight.

765
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:42,911
We'll have to sail
a raft to Fiji

766
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,955
like Thor Heyerdahl.

767
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:49,000
I have made another reservation
on the 11 o'clock to Martinique.

768
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,044
You never mentioned this one,
the 11 o'clock flight.

769
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,754
I never ever thought
we'd need it.

770
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,590
But I don't know anything
about Martinique.

771
00:43:56,716 --> 00:43:58,009
What'd you know about Fiji?

772
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:00,220
Nothing, really.

773
00:44:00,887 --> 00:44:01,972
Okay.

774
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,934
Did you book another flight
after that?

775
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,395
Oh, let's just try to
make the 11 o'clock, okay?

776
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,356
Why, do they know about us yet?

777
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:15,068
Well, by now, Rotzinger
has probably figured out

778
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,403
it was the first three hostages.

779
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,155
Loomis: Oh, Grimm.
- Yeah.

780
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:21,158
Grimm, I cannot go to prison.

781
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:24,452
Don't worry about it.
We were disguised.

782
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:27,122
- Taxi!
- You never mentioned Rotzinger.

783
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,291
You never mentioned Martinique.

784
00:44:29,457 --> 00:44:30,917
What else haven't you mentioned?

785
00:44:31,084 --> 00:44:32,502
Huh?

786
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:34,421
Everything you ever told me
is a lie, isn't it?

787
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,423
- Are you alright?
- Am I?

788
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,009
You think this is fun, you think
this is a night on the town.

789
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,886
No, I think it's a lot more
exciting than that.

790
00:44:41,052 --> 00:44:42,929
Loomis: Taxi!
- You used to think so too.

791
00:44:43,096 --> 00:44:44,306
We couldn't even
discuss this plan

792
00:44:44,472 --> 00:44:45,849
unless there was
a bedroom pretty close by.

793
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,852
It was before I realized
who you are, what you are.

794
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,353
What am I?

795
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,063
You're a world-class
bank robber,

796
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,482
drunk on your own power
and expertise.

797
00:44:54,649 --> 00:44:57,611
- And Loomis thinks so too.
Loomis: Taxi.

"world-class bank robber"

thing came from.

801
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:07,078
Okay, I did rob a bank,
but so did you.

802
00:45:07,245 --> 00:45:10,665
Isn't that what we planned
for six months in your bedroom?

803
00:45:10,832 --> 00:45:13,293
And now if...
When we get a cab,

804
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,588
we can complete the plan
and live out our lives

805
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,965

tonight, Steve?

about that bank robbery, Roy.

such a bad guy, Roy?

I mean, he had a
great sense of humor, right?

00:46:22,153 --> 00:46:23,280
He wasn't another
one of them junkies

with a homemade nine millimeter.

828

a scumbag like him.

I say, hang the clown,
then pull his pants down

You're out of here, pal.

Oh, nothing. No, he's completely

And you are to him. Kind of like

Not so as you'd notice.

And I know it's not
exactly reasonable

inside the bank

than a beard or a blond

here's what's up.

1900 hours, a car containing
two men and a woman

906
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,646
crashed into the lobby of
the Pierce Hotel.

The passengers fled
before we got there.

and a woman, sir.

they're mired down

have to wade in every day.

- Hey.

952
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:54,504
Oh, nice. Professor
Henry Higgins is gonna spot us.

We're gonna go in here.

This ain't my dick in your back.

00:53:15,608 --> 00:53:17,151
That's a relief.

958
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,573
We came...

959
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,411
about the money.

960
00:53:26,577 --> 00:53:29,497
What's that walking corpse say?

961
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,207
He said they come
about the money.

962
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,836
Ask him what money, asshole.

963
00:53:35,002 --> 00:53:36,921
What money, asshole?

964
00:53:39,173 --> 00:53:41,634
Incredible.
They're playing games.

965
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,511
Yeah.

966
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:46,597
Tell him you're gonna play games
on his fucking head.

967
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:49,726
I'm gonna play games
on your fucking head.

Grimm: You must hate
this warehouse.

969

Because it's gonna be a
three-alarm job after tomorrow.

970
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:58,776
Johnny. Come here.

971
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,822
Come here.

972
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,825
What?

[whispering]
What the hell are you doing?

00:54:09,912 --> 00:54:12,206
I have no idea.

I don't know.

976
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,669
- Will I ask him?
- You want me to ask him?

977
00:54:20,965 --> 00:54:26,137
Um, Mr. Skelton wants to know
how come he don't know you.

978
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:30,141
- Gee. Because I'm new.
- Because he's new.

979
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,185
Tell him Lombino didn't say
nothing to me

980
00:54:32,351 --> 00:54:35,313
about no new bagman.

981
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:40,234
- Lombino didn't say nothing...
- Mr. Lombino, huh?

982
00:54:40,401 --> 00:54:42,153
Grimm: Mr. Lombino?

983
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,031
Since when does a wise guy
like you

984
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,575
deserve an explanation
from a giant

985
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,494
like Mr. Lombino?

986
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:54,165
Mr. Lombino didn't say nothing
to Mr. Skelton about no new...

987
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,083
Alright, enough already, Johnny.

988
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,835
Don't you see me
standing right here?

989
00:54:58,002 --> 00:55:00,046
Yeah, alright. I'm sorry.

990
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,881
Alright.

991
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,758
What happened to Mario?

992
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,468
Mario?

993
00:55:07,386 --> 00:55:09,055
Somebody dared him.

994
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,224
So he threw Earl here
out of a moving car.

995
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:15,770
Same spot he done Johnny.

996
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:18,689
- He must love that spot.
Grimm: The man is an animal.

997
00:55:18,856 --> 00:55:21,484
- He's sick.
- Alright.

998
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,153
I'll give you the money.

999
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,072
Soon as I call Lom...

1000
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,615
Mr. Lombino

1001
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,700
to check you out.

1002
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,289
Fine. Actually, perfect.

1003
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,709
I can hear Mr. Lombino now

1004
00:55:38,876 --> 00:55:42,922
"Skelton just called me
to check on Chip."

1005
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:46,133
Skelton: Mr. Lombino, please.
Skelton.

1006
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,177
"I guess Chip wasn't so hot.

1007
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,179
Guess I'll have to put
that animal Mario

1008
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,806
back on Skelton."

1009
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:56,269
No. Wait. Uncle Mike.
Uncle Mike.

1010
00:55:56,435 --> 00:55:58,396
Mr. Skelton, wait a minute.
No, wait a minute. Wait a...

1011
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,982
We don't want Mario to come
in here, the bald giant

knocking everybody around
for kicks, I mean.

1014
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:05,611
You know, I mean,
nobody's stupid enough

1015
00:56:05,778 --> 00:56:07,238
to do this for a few K.

1016
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,781
They gotta know that Mario's
gonna come after them

1017
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,325
and pull out their livers,
I mean, you know...

1018
00:56:11,492 --> 00:56:14,036
I think that I might be right
on this, so, you know...

1019
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:24,380
Six thousand. Short shipment.

1020
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,341
Thanks. Come on, Earl.

1021
00:56:27,508 --> 00:56:29,135
You know, when I first
heard the rumors

1022
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:32,179
about Lombino being back
in town, I said, "No way."

1023
00:56:32,346 --> 00:56:35,266
I mean, the man never leaves
his haven in Nevada.

1024
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:38,686
But, but now that I see you,
I know it must be true.

1025
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,731
He's come to put his house
in order.

1026
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,608
And that's why the man is king.

Drugs, protection, you name it.
Lombino is king.

1028
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:52,033
- Oh, tell him I said so.
- Yeah.

1029
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:54,785
Anything the Lombino touches
turns to gold.

1030
00:56:54,952 --> 00:56:58,122
King Lombino.
That's why he's the king, right?

1031
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,249
- Tell him I said so.
- I will, John.

1032
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,792
- See ya.
- See you later.

1033
00:57:01,959 --> 00:57:03,628
Alright.
Take care of your head.

Grimm, Grimm, baby,
I never thought

1035
00:57:05,546 --> 00:57:07,340
we'd get out of there. Never.

You just ripped off the Mob.

You were born for this.

It must be in your genes.

What's that smell?

1048
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,433
Used wine.
Do you go to the airport?

1049
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,020
- Near the airport.
- Great. We're on a roll.

1050
00:58:03,187 --> 00:58:05,815
You have exact change, right?

1051
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,733
Give him $100.

1052
00:58:09,193 --> 00:58:10,528
Hurry.

1053
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:11,946
Hurry.

1054
00:58:13,572 --> 00:58:16,075
That isn't exact change.

1055
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,119
Have you looked back there?

1056
00:58:18,285 --> 00:58:19,912
I don't think anybody's
going to object.

1057

I look back there every night,

and a hygienic fashion.

I leave this stop
in one minute and 45 seconds.

Exact change, or off.

Alright. Alright. Give me
a minute. I'll go get change.

No. I can sit.

01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,623
- Unbelievable.
- You know him?

1110
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:53,834
Mario Monetti,
bagman for Vince Lombino.

1111
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,003
Lombino?
He's in Nevada, right?

1112
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,964
Yeah, supposedly
somewhere in Nevada.

1113
01:01:59,131 --> 01:02:01,675
He got out just as I was
about to collar him.

1114
01:02:01,842 --> 01:02:03,928
Still takes more
out of this town in a day

1115
01:02:04,094 --> 01:02:06,847
than the clown could
get in a week.

1116
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,600
You're sure that's the guy
that jumped from the cab?

1117
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,518
The cabbie ID'd him, sir.

1118

[speaking in foreign language]

1119
01:02:21,987 --> 01:02:23,113
Come on.

1120
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:28,911
May I ask you a question?

1121
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,126
- Get behind the white line.
- Oh, please. Come on.

1122
01:02:36,293 --> 01:02:38,045
Go, just go.

1123
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,968
My mom used to do this.

1124
01:02:44,134 --> 01:02:46,053
Just like this.

1125
01:02:49,598 --> 01:02:51,350
You should have a kid, Phyllis.

1126
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,437
Funny you should say that.

1127
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,237
Really?

1128
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:05,489
Sit back.

1129
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:08,993
- Well, Grimm didn't tell me.
- Grimm doesn't know.

1130
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:12,204
I didn't want to tell him
till after the job.

1131
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:14,873
Well, tell him now.

1132
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,959
I'm not gonna tell him at all.

1133
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,046
Don't you love him?

1134

[mellow music]

1135
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:31,098
My sister always told me...

1136
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:34,643
there's the type of guy
you're crazy about...

1137
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,979
and there's the type
you marry.

1138
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:40,691
Because if he's that exciting,
you just can't trust him.

1139
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:44,611
But I told her,
you can have both.

1140
01:03:44,778 --> 01:03:47,281
And when I met Grimm,
I thought I did.

1141
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:52,161
But there's a limit. I mean,
you said it yourself, Loomis.

1142
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,787
He's born for this.

1143
01:03:53,954 --> 01:03:56,707
I'm, I'm just
one of his gang now.

1144
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,834
Oh, God,
what, something I said,

1145
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,919
you're gonna let that
influence you?

1146
01:04:03,213 --> 01:04:05,007
Oh, this is all my fault.

1147
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:08,427
Oh, no. Come here.

1148
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:09,803
Come here.

1149
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:12,723
Nothing's your fault.

1150
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,643
Except you honked
the fucking horn.

1151

When you say
"Near the airport..."

1152

- 0.48 miles.
- Alright.

1153

- When do we get there?
- 2230 hours.

1154
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,613
- When is that in human time?
- 10:30.

1155
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,657
- 10:30. Say you had to walk it.
- With that injured individual?

1156
01:04:30,824 --> 01:04:32,326
I can't give you
a precise figure on that.

1157
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:33,827
Come on. Make a guess.

1158
01:04:33,994 --> 01:04:36,538
- Twenty-one minutes.
- Thank you.

1159
01:04:38,665 --> 01:04:42,336
This isn't my usual route.
My husband's in intensive care.

1160
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:44,129
You're gonna even that out,
aren't you?

1161
01:04:44,296 --> 01:04:46,215
Mind your own business.

1162
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:53,806
What'd he say?

1163
01:04:53,972 --> 01:04:56,934
Well, his estimate,
which I'm prepared to accept,

1164
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,019
gets us to the terminal
at nine minutes of 11:00.

1165
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:02,022
Nine minutes? We'll have
nine months... Minutes?

1166
01:05:03,982 --> 01:05:06,026
How come I've heard that name
"Lombino" before?

1167
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:07,528
Oh, come on.
You remember this guy.

1168
01:05:07,694 --> 01:05:09,071
He shot out
his brother's eyeball

1169
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,865
over a plate of
Fra Diavolo sauce at Umberto's.

1170
01:05:12,032 --> 01:05:13,742
I can't believe our luck,

1171
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:16,036
to walk into his place,
all unsuspecting.

1172
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:17,579
His place?

1173
01:05:17,746 --> 01:05:19,289
You've walked into his places

all unsuspecting
many, many times.

1175
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:24,878
He owns restaurants, bars,
supermarkets.

1176
01:05:25,045 --> 01:05:27,172
The man owns preschools
in this town.

1177
01:05:31,593 --> 01:05:34,304
Do you work for the clown
or does he work for you?

1178
01:05:34,471 --> 01:05:36,890
Does the clown
work for Lombino, too?

1179
01:05:37,057 --> 01:05:40,519
- What clown?
- Oh, very convincing, Monetti.

1180
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,896
I guess we should apologize
and let you go now.

1181
01:05:43,063 --> 01:05:45,190
Yeah, right.

tell us a goddamn thing.

You idiot. This man doesn't
speak a word of English.

Come on... Here. Relax, fella.
Sit down. Sit down.

to get me an interpreter?

1187

"Interrogator."

01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:19,391
Probably left your own country

1193

to escape just
this type of persecution.

Damn it.
Get me an interpreter.

Don't you realize the robbers
told this man their destination?

But even if they did, sir,

1197
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:31,278
he wouldn't have understood
a word of it.

1198

Besides, I don't even know
what language he talks.

01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:25,533
Loomis: No.
Grimm: Please?

1420
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,118
Ready? I'll go real fast.
Please?

1421
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:29,579
Loomis: No.
Grimm: Yeah. Come on. Now!

1422
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:32,665
[Loomis groaning]

1423
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:38,588
Grimm: Alright. Attaboy.

1424
01:18:38,755 --> 01:18:41,090
Now help me zip this up.

1425
01:18:41,257 --> 01:18:43,384
You people can keep this city!

1426
01:18:56,689 --> 01:18:59,067
- Hi.
- You think you're late enough?

1427
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,152
Oh, you must be
from around here.

1428
01:19:06,449 --> 01:19:09,369
[mellow music]

1429
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,835
So, we'll just go and have
a great time anyway, huh?

1430
01:19:18,002 --> 01:19:19,545
Right, Grimm.

1431
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:24,259
Oh, this was not my idea.

1432
01:19:24,425 --> 01:19:26,177
This was not the plan.

1433
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:29,722
I'm sorry, Grimm.

1434
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,478
[tires screech]

1435
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:42,777
Give me three minutes
before you come in.

1436
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:43,820
Got it, sir.

1437
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:45,446
You go, just promise me

1438
01:19:45,613 --> 01:19:47,323
you'll see a doctor as soon
as you get there, okay?

1439
01:19:49,033 --> 01:19:52,161
No. We were all
gonna go together.

1440
01:19:52,328 --> 01:19:58,209
Hey, you two with the mileage
upgrades, sit down.

1441
01:19:58,376 --> 01:20:00,962
You believe the filth
that they let into first?

1442
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:02,463
Do you mind?

1443
01:20:03,631 --> 01:20:05,300
Come here, Loomis.

1444
01:20:05,466 --> 01:20:08,886
Look at you. I mean,
you have to get away, now.

1445
01:20:09,053 --> 01:20:11,347
When I find Phyllis...

1446
01:20:11,514 --> 01:20:14,892
- If I find Phyllis...
- Yeah, I mind.

1447
01:20:15,059 --> 01:20:17,103
You goddamn straphangers

1448
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:19,981
are ruining Mrs. Crane's
beverage service!

1449
01:20:21,649 --> 01:20:23,192
You okay, baby?

1450
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:25,903
Your Bloody Mary's
not too spicy, is it?

1451
01:20:27,947 --> 01:20:29,949
That's my girl.

1452
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:32,076
[knocking on door]

1453
01:20:32,243 --> 01:20:34,912
See you soon. Get a tan.

1454
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:36,539
Moisturize before you peel.

1455
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:39,959
Wait, Grimm.

1456
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:41,878
We can find her together.

1457
01:20:44,547 --> 01:20:48,176
Oh, look. It's...

1458
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:50,762
I hate to do this to you, babe.

1459
01:20:50,928 --> 01:20:52,513
You'll never take me alive,
Rotzinger.

1460
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,223
Save yourself the disgrace,
Lombino.

1461
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:57,018
- It's the king.
- Vince, you fucking worm!

1462
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,020
- He's come for the king.
- You snake!

1463
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:00,897
Even if you get past me,
there are 50 cops

1464
01:21:01,064 --> 01:21:02,523
waiting outside that door.

[grunting]

1466
01:21:07,528 --> 01:21:09,864
Alright, Rotzinger. My turn!

1467
01:21:11,991 --> 01:21:13,368
Still got another minute.

1468
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:15,953
[dramatic music]

1469
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,542
Hey!

1470
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:23,503
As we prepare for departure,

1471
01:21:23,669 --> 01:21:25,838
we ask that you pay
close attention...

1472
01:21:26,005 --> 01:21:29,133
You rat! You creep!

1473
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:32,220
Can you hit him
with something else? Give me!

1474

[indistinct TV chatter]

[grunting]

1477
01:21:40,978 --> 01:21:43,147
I did it with Mario, Vinnie.

1478
01:21:43,314 --> 01:21:48,069
When you were playing cards
with your stinking goombahs!

1479
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:50,321
Nobody does that
to Mrs. Russ Crane.

1480
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,949
- Ah!
- Quit making him angry!

1481
01:21:54,575 --> 01:21:56,077
It's thicker, Vinnie.

1482
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,621
It's thicker than his neck
and a lot more powerful.

1483
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,706
[grunting]

Phyllis, they just
caught this guy.

Rotzinger: Give me
that goddamn... Alright.

1489
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:28,526
Vince Lombino,
AKA Russ Crane,

1490
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:31,195
you're under arrest
for murder in first degree

1491
01:22:31,362 --> 01:22:33,865
and murder in second degree,
arson, pandering,

sale of weapons,
felonious assaults, blackmail...

1493

Hey, Mario, how come
you squealed, tough guy?

1496
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:50,256
Screw you.

1497
01:22:57,597 --> 01:22:59,140
That's him.

1498
01:23:02,602 --> 01:23:04,812
[speaking in foreign language]

1499
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:07,315
Don't matter what he's saying.
Throw him in the car.

1500
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:08,816
He's just along for the ride.
Come on!

1501

- Angie! Angel!
- Come on!

1502

- Is Mrs. Lombino okay up there?
- Hey! Hey!

I love you, Angie!

Hey, hold it, my friend.

[sighs] Thanks for the assist.

1508

No problem.

1509
01:23:33,466 --> 01:23:34,967
I'd like to give you
a commendation.

1510

What's your name and address?

Okay, Dan.
Wish there were more like you.

01:23:59,158 --> 01:24:01,410
Don't say that.

greatest day of your career?

called these guys?
