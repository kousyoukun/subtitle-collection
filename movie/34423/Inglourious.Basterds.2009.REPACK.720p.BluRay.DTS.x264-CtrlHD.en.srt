I have no way of knowing

Yes.

Please tell me
what you've heard .

13
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,733
I've heard

14
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:09,572
that the Führer has put you
in charge of rounding up
the Jews left in France

15
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,575
who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile .

The Führer couldn't have
said it better himself.

17

But the meaning
of your visit,

18
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:27,173
pleasant though it is,
is mysterious to me.

19
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,094
The Germans looked through
my house nine months ago
for hiding Jews

20
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,846
and found nothing .

21
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,266
I'm aware of that.

22
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,269
I've read the reports
of this area.

23
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,482
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

24
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,652
there is always
a slight duplication
of efforts,

25
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:54,575
most of it being a complete
waste of time, but needs
to be done nevertheless.

26
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,621
I just have a few questions,
monsieur LaPadite .

27
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,374
If you can assist me

Now,

Is that correct?

35
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,784
To my knowledge,

36
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:40,329
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.

except the Dreyfuses.

43
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:04,395
Somewhere in the last year
it would appear
they've vanished .

44
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,773
Which leads me
to the conclusion that they've
either made good their escape

45

or someone
is very successfully
hiding them .

Precisely.

94

Heydrich apparently
hates the moniker

the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him .

96
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,491
Actually, why he would hate
the name "the Hangman"
is baffling to me.

97

lt would appear he has
done everything in
his power to earn it.

precisely because
I've earned it.

100
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,214
The feature that makes me
such an effective hunter
of the Jews is,

101
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,008
as opposed to most
German soldiers ,

102
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,093
I can think like a Jew

103
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,472
where they can only
think like a German .

104
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,266
(CHUCKLING) More precisely,
a German soldier.

105
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:22,903
Now, if one were to determine
what attribute the German
people share with a beast,

106
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,990
it would be the cunning
and the predatory instinct
of a hawk.

But if one were to determine
what attributes the Jews share
with a beast,

it would be
that of the rat.

The Führer and Goebbels'
propaganda have said
pretty much the same thing .

110
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,215
But where our conclusions
differ,

111
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,301
is I don't consider
the comparison an insult.

112
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,641

the world a rat lives in .

113

It's a hostile world ,
indeed .

114

If a rat were to scamper
through your front door,
right now,

115

would you greet it

Has a rat ever done
anything to you

of the bubonic plague,
but that's some time ago.

a rat could spread ,

122
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,463
a squirrel could
equally carry.

(AGREES IN FRENCH)

125
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,595
Yet, I assume you don't
share the same animosity
with squirrels

126

that you do with rats,
do you?

127

No.

128
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,350
Yet, they're both rodents,
are they not?

129
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:39,438
And except for the tail ,
they even rather look alike,
don't they?

130
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,691
It's an interesting thought,
Herr Colonel .

131
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,444
However interesting
as the thought may be,

132
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:48,780
it makes not
one bit of difference
to how you feel .

133
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,203
If a rat were
to walk in here,
right now, as I'm talking

134
00:15:56,331 --> 00:16:00,167
would you greet it
with a saucer
of your delicious milk?

135
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,710
Probably not.

136
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,087
I didn't think so.

137
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,256
You don't like them .

138
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,216
You don't really know
why you don't like them .

139
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,053
All you know is
you find them repulsive.

140
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,308
Consequently,
a German soldier
conducts a search

141
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,935
of a house suspected
of hiding Jews.

142
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,438
Where does the hawk look?

143
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,691
He looks in the barn ,
he looks in the attic,
he looks in the cellar,

144
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,235
he looks everywhere
he would hide.

145
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,366
But there are so many places
it would never occur
to a hawk to hide.

146
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,288
However, the reason
the Führer has brought me
off my Alps in Austria

147
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:42,793
and placed me in
French cow country today is
because it does occur to me.

148
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,381
Because I'm aware
what tremendous feats
human beings are capable of

149
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,508
once they abandon dignity.

as well?

Please , Herr Colonel ,
make yourseIf at home.

152
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:16,451
Now, my job dictates

153
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,459
that I must have my men
enter your home

154
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,257
and conduct
a thorough search

155
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:34,136
before I can officially
cross your family's name
off my list.

156
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,765
And if there are any
irregularities to be found ,
rest assured they will be.

157
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,059
That is unless you have

such as they are,

01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:24,503
I write reviews and articles
for a publication called
Films and Filmmakers,

German Cinema in the '20s.

And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.

515

It's a subtextual film

Are you familiar
with German cinema
under the Third Reich?

522
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:09,548
Yes . Obviously, I haven't
seen any of the films made
in the last three years,

523
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,884
but I'm familiar with it.

01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:19,058
Well , this little escapade
of ours requires a knowledge
of the German film industry

under the Third Reich .
Explain to me U FA
under Goebbels .

528
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,859
Goebbels considers
the films he's making

529
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:32,196
to be the beginning
of a new era
in German cinema.

530
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:34,323
An alternative
to what he considers

531
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:37,368
the Jewish-German
intellectual cinema
of the '20s,

532
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:40,746
and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood .

533
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,414
How's he doing?

534
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:45,542
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?

535
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:50,589
You say he wants
to take on the Jews
at their own game.

536
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,593
Well , compared to,
say, Louis B . Mayer,

537
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,680
how's he doing?

538
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,014
Quite well , actually.

539
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,266
Since Goebbels
has taken over,

540
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:05,771
film attendance has steadily
risen in Germany over
the last eight years.

541
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,316
But Louis B . Mayer
wouldn't be Goebbels'
proper opposite number.

542
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:13,195

sees himseIf closer
to David O . Selznick.

Bormann , and most of

as well as luminaries
of the Nazi propaganda

all our rotten eggs
in one basket.

of yesteryear,
gone from this earth .

the Basterds.

of them , because these Yanks
have been them the devil .

565
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:35,319
You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside
of Paris.

566
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,488
The Basterds
will be waiting for you .

567
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,324

to a little village
called Nadine.

568
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,244
In Nadine,
there's a tavern
called La Louisiane.

members of the Basterds.

572

She's also made
all the other arrangements
you're going to need .

we can handle it.

798

799

801
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,480
The other looks odd .

802

there were no Germans

01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:21,788
and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to.

806
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:23,790
What was the next step?

807
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:25,250
Tuxedos.

808
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:28,670
To get them into the premiere
wearing military uniforms

809
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:31,548
with all the military there
would've been suicide.

810
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:36,803
But going as members
of the German film industry,

811
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:40,390
they wear tuxedos
and fit in with
everybody else.

812
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:45,062
I arranged for the tailor
to fit three tuxedos tonight.

813

was going as my escort.

as a German cameraman
and his assistant.

However, there's something
you don't know.

823
01:40:43,788 --> 01:40:47,874
There've been
two recent developments
regarding Operation Kino .

824
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:54,756
One , the venue has been
changed from The Ritz
to a much smaller venue.

825
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:58,468
Enormous change
at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.

826
01:40:58,553 --> 01:41:01,513
Why the hell is Goebbels
doing stuff so damn peculiar?

827
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:05,308
It probably has
something to do with
the second development.

828
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:06,977
Which is?

I know this is
a silly question
before I ask it,

850
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:53,750
but can you Americans
speak any other language
than English?

851
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:56,837
We both speak
a little ltalian .

With an atrocious accent,
no doubt.

But that doesn't exactly
kill us in the crib .

854
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:08,265
Germans don't have
a good ear for ltalian .

No, I do not.

Tell me, Aldo,
if I were sitting
where you're sitting ,

show me mercy?

Nope.

English expression
about shoes and feet?

953
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:22,204
"Looks like the shoe is
on the other foot." Yeah ,

Finding people
is my specialty,

960
02:04:46,229 --> 02:04:48,647

I worked for the Nazis
finding people.

some of them were Jews.

Well , you do
have to admit,
it is catchy.

the Little Man?

968
02:05:08,835 --> 02:05:10,627
Germans' nickname for you .

969
02:05:10,712 --> 02:05:13,755
The Germans' nickname for me
is the Little Man?

970
02:05:14,132 --> 02:05:18,677
And as if to make my point,
I'm a little surprised how
tall you were in real life.

971

not circus-midget little,

would suggest.

Well , let's just say,
she got what she deserved .

976
02:05:36,112 --> 02:05:38,614
And when you purchase
friends like Bridget
von Hammersmark,

02:05:38,698 --> 02:05:40,699

and Private Omar. . .

I wouldn't interrogate

982

every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors,

983
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:04,056
we simply aren't
operating on the level of
mutual respect I assumed .

984
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,724
No, I guess not.

985
02:06:05,934 --> 02:06:11,063
Well , back to
the whereabouts of your
two ltalian saboteurs.

986
02:06:14,234 --> 02:06:15,984
As of this moment,

987
02:06:16,069 --> 02:06:20,906
both Omar and Donowitz
should be sitting in the
very seats we left them in .

988

Double-zero 23

still around their ankles,
still ready to explode.

990

And your mission ,
some would call
a terrorist plot,

991
02:06:32,752 --> 02:06:35,254
as of this moment,
is still a go.

992
02:06:35,338 --> 02:06:38,674
That's a pretty
exciting story.
What's next? Eliza on lce?

993
02:06:38,758 --> 02:06:40,008
However,

994
02:06:41,886 --> 02:06:45,013
all I have to do is pick up
this phone right here,

995
02:06:45,098 --> 02:06:47,933
inform the cinema,
and your plan is kaput.

996
02:06:50,353 --> 02:06:55,565
If they're still here,
and if they're still alive,
and that's one big if,

997
02:06:56,901 --> 02:06:58,694
there ain't no way
you're going
to take them boys

998
02:06:58,778 --> 02:07:00,404
without setting off
them bombs.

999

I have no doubt.

1000
02:07:02,323 --> 02:07:05,617
And , yes,
some Germans will die .
Yes, it will ruin the evening .

1001
02:07:05,702 --> 02:07:08,620
And , yes , Goebbels will be
very, very, very mad at you

1002
02:07:08,705 --> 02:07:10,789
for what you've done
to his big night.

1003
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:14,334
But you won't get H itler,
you won't get Goebbels ,

1004
02:07:14,419 --> 02:07:17,462
you won't get Goring ,
and you won't get Bormann .

1005
02:07:17,547 --> 02:07:20,132
And you need all four
to end the war.

1006
02:07:21,801 --> 02:07:24,970
But if I don't pick up
this phone right here,

1007
02:07:25,054 --> 02:07:27,389
you may very well
get all four.

1008
02:07:28,641 --> 02:07:33,478
And if you get all four,
you end the war

1009

tonight.

1010
02:07:37,358 --> 02:07:38,900
So , gentlemen ,

1011
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:42,821
let's discuss the prospect
of ending the war tonight.

1012
02:07:45,742 --> 02:07:47,576
So , the way I see it,

1013
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:51,872
since H itler's death
or possible rescue rests
solely on my reaction ,

1014
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:54,124
if I do nothing ,

1015
02:07:54,542 --> 02:07:57,252
it's as if
I'm causing his death
even more than yourselves.

1016
02:07:57,337 --> 02:07:58,587
Wouldn't you agree?

1017
02:07:59,255 --> 02:08:00,589
I guess so.

1018
02:08:03,176 --> 02:08:05,177
How about you ,
Utivich?

1019
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:06,887
I guess so, too.

1020
02:08:12,435 --> 02:08:13,685
Gentlemen ,
l have no intention

1021
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:16,855
of killing H itler and killing
Goebbels and killing Goring
and killing Bormann ,

1022
02:08:16,939 --> 02:08:19,691
not to mention winning
the war single-handedly
for the Allies,

1023

to find myseIf standing
before a Jewish tribunal .

1024
02:08:25,615 --> 02:08:29,159
If you want to win
the war tonight,

1025
02:08:30,787 --> 02:08:32,954
we have to make a deal .

1026
02:08:35,958 --> 02:08:37,709
What kind of deal?

1027
02:08:37,794 --> 02:08:40,337
The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.

1028
02:08:40,421 --> 02:08:44,966
However, I'm sure
this mission of yours has
a commanding officer.
