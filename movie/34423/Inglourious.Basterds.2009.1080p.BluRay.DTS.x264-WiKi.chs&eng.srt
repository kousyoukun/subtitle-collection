00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,043
第一章
Chapter One

2
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,442
很久以前...
Once upon a time...

3
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,954
在纳粹占领的法国
in Nazi-occupied France

4
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,890
1941年
1941

5
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,728
进去，把门关上
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Go back inside and shut the door.

6
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,136
茱莉，替我装盆水洗脸...
Julie, get me some water
for my wash up...

7
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,797
...然后进屋子去
...then get inside with your sisters.

8
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,025
拿去，爸爸
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Ready, Papa.

9
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,436
谢谢你，乖女儿...
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Thank you, my darling...

10
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,774
...现在进去陪你姐姐
...now you go inside with your sisters.

11
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,344
不要跑
Don't run.

12
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,137
这是皮瑞拉帕帝的家吗？
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
ls this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

13
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,671
我就是皮瑞拉帕帝
l am Perrier LaPadite.

14
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,142
幸会了，拉帕帝先生...
lt is a pleasure to meet you,
Monsieur LaPadite...

15
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,687
...我是纳粹党卫军汉斯蓝达上校
...l am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.

16
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,245
我能为你做什么？
What can l do for you?

17
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,656
请我进去你家...
l was hoping you could invite me
inside your home...

18
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,190
...咱们俩一起谈谈
...and we may have a discussion.

19
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,153
没问题，请吧
Certainly. After you.

20
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,936
蓝达上校，这是我的家人
Colonel Landa, this is my family.

21
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,348
我是纳粹党卫军汉斯蓝达上校...
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS...

22
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,847
...小姐们...
...Mademoiselle...

23
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,184
...我随时效劳
...at your service.

24
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:56,289
关于你们家的谣言是真的
The rumors l have heard in the
village about your family are all true.

25
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,227
你的女儿一个比一个漂亮
Each one of your daughters
is more lovely than the last.

26
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,994
谢谢
Merci.

27
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:06,762
来...
Please...

28
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,564
...请坐
...have a seat.

29
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,214
苏珊，替上校倒杯酒
Suzanne, would you be so good as to
get the Colonel some wine?

30
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,708
不
But no.

31
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,149
谢谢你，但是我不喝酒
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite,
but no wine.

32
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:27,056
这是酪农场
你家应该有牛奶吧？
This being a dairy farm, one would be
safe in assuming you have milk?

33
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,218
对
Oui.

34
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,659
那就来杯牛奶吧
Then milk is what l prefer.

35
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,121
好的
Very well.

36
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,926
茱莉，请你关上窗户
Julie, would you mind closing the window?

37
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,947
谢谢你
Merci.

38
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,339
我要对你家人和你的乳牛...
Monsieur, to both your family
and your cows...

39
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,109
...说声：  “好极了”
...l say, ''Bravo.''

40
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,202
谢谢你
Thank you.

41
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,278
一起过来坐
Please Join me at your table.

42
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,175
好的
Very well.

43
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:32,715
拉帕帝先生...
Monsieur LaPadite...

44
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:37,724
...我们要谈的事最好私下谈
...what we have to discuss
would be better discussed in private.

45
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,499
我请手下在外面等
You'll notice l left my men outdoors.

46
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:47,504
不介意的话，请小姐们出去
lf it wouldn't offend them, could you
ask your lovely ladies to step outside?

47
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,332
说得对
You are right.

48
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,505
夏绿蒂，带她们出去
Charlotte, would you take the girls
outside?

49
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,970
我和上校有话要谈
The Colonel and l need to have
a few words.

50
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,187
拉帕帝先生...
Monsieur LaPadite...

51
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:15,596
...很抱歉，我会的法文都讲光了
...l regret to inform you
l've exhausted the extent of my French.

52
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,669
勉强讲下去只会让我很糗
To continue to speak it so inadequately
would only serve to embarrass me.

53
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,741
但是听说你的英文说得很溜
However, l've been led to believe
you speak English quite well.

54
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,102
是的
Yes.

55
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:31,377
我也是，那么客随主便...
Well, it Just so happens, l do as well.
This being your house...

56
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,916
...请你让我用英文继续说下去
...l ask your permission to switch
to English...
...for the remainder of the conversation.

57
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,247
请便
By all means.

58
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,754
我对你和你家人很熟悉
While l'm very familiar
with you and your family,

59
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,524
但我不知道你对我熟不熟悉
l have no way of knowing
if you are familiar with who l am.

60
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,627
你知道有我这个人吗？
Are you aware of my existence?

61
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,863
-知道
-非常好
-Yes.
-This is good.

62
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:56,465
你知道我在法国的任务吗？
Now, are you aware of the Job l've been
ordered to carry out in France?

63
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,369
知道
Yes.

64
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,571
请告诉我你听说什么
Please tell me what you've heard.

65
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:09,718
我听说元首命令你捕杀
仍在法国的犹太人
l've heard
that the Fuhrer has put you in charge
of rounding up the Jews left in France

66
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,724
他们不是躲起来
就是假装成非犹太人
who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.

67
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:17,061
就连元首都没你说得好
The Fuhrer couldn't have
said it better himself.

68
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,628
虽然我很欢迎你来访
But the meaning of your visit,

69
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:27,300
但是却不知道原因
pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.

70
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,240
德军九个月前来搜过我家
The Germans looked through my house
nine months ago for hiding Jews

71
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,211
什么也没找到
and found nothing.

72
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,409
我知道
l'm aware of that.

73
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,341
我看过报告
l've read the reports of this area.

74
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,618
但是就像每个新官上任的公司
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

75
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,785
同样的事得再做一次
there is always
a slight duplication of efforts,

76
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:54,660
大部分是浪费时间
但还是非做不可
most of it being a complete waste of time,
but needs to be done nevertheless.

77
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,762
我只想请教一些问题
l Just have a few questions,
monSieur LaPadite.

78
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,504
你只要照实回答
lf you can assist me with answers,

79
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,668
你家的档案就能结案
my department can close
the file on your family.

80
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,848
是这样的
Now,

81
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:21,289
法国被占领之前
这地区有四家犹太人
before the occupation,
there were four Jewish families in this area,

82
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,159
全都跟你一样是酪农
all dairy farmers like yourself.

83
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:30,628
德勒列克、罗伦昂、拉维特
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts

84
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,168
以及德瑞芙斯
and the Dreyfuses.

85
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,832
对吧？
ls that correct?

86
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,966
就我所知
To my knowledge,

87
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,501
他们是犹太裔的酪农
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.

88
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:44,480
上校，介意我抽烟斗吗？
Herr Colonel,
would it disturb you if l smoked my pipe?

89
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,017
请便，拉帕帝先生
(CHUCKLES) Please,
monSieur LaPadite,

90
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,054
这是你家，自在一点
this is your house,
make yourself comfortable.

91
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,357
根据这些文件
Now, according to these papers,

92
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,717
这地区的犹太家庭都被拘捕
all the Jewish families
in this area have been accounted for

93
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,662
除了德瑞芙斯一家人
except the Dreyfuses.

94
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,525
看来他们去年突然消失无踪
Somewhere in the last year
it would appear they've vanished.

95
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,903
我猜他们不是逃亡成功
Which leads me to the conclusion
that they've either made good their escape

96
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,874
就是有人把他们藏得很好
or someone
is very successfully hiding them.

97
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,707
你听过德瑞芙斯一家的事吗？
What have you heard about
the Dreyfuses, monSieur LaPadite?

98
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,215
-只有谣言
-我最爱谣言了！
-Only rumors.
-l love rumors!

99
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,118
事实很容易误导我们
Facts could be so misleading,

100
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,350
谣言不管真假都能泄密
where rumors, true or false,
are often revealing.

101
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,214
所以，拉帕帝先生
So, monSieur LaPadite,

102
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,557
你听过德瑞芙斯一家什么谣言？
what rumors have you heard
regarding the Dreyfuses?

103
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,529
我说过，这只是个谣言
Again, this is Just a rumor,

104
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:41,904
我们听说德瑞芙斯一家
逃到西班牙了
but we heard the Dreyfuses
had made their way into Spain.

105
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,616
你听到他们逃亡的谣言？
So, the rumors you've heard
have been of escape?

106
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,710
对
Yes.

107
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,624
虽然你没见过德瑞芙斯一家
Having never met the Dreyfuses,
would you confirm for me

108
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,959
但是请你说出他们全家的名字
the exact members of the household
and their names?

109
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,405
他们家有五个人
There were five of them.

110
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,270
父亲，雅各
The father, Jacob.

111
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,603
太太，米兰
Wife, Miram.

112
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,279
还有她的兄弟
巴布
And her brother, Bob.

113
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,257
巴布几岁？
How old is Bob?

114
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,564
30、31岁
Thirty, 31 .

115
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,793
继续说
Continue.

116
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,498
孩子们
And the children,

117
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,902
艾莫斯
Amos

118
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,241
还有苏珊娜
and Shosanna.

119
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,015
孩子们几岁？
Ages of the children?

120
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,551
艾莫斯，9或10岁
Amos was nine or 10.

121
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,956
-苏珊娜呢？
-苏珊娜是
-And Shosanna?
-And Shosanna was

122
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,369
18或19岁
我不是很确定
18 or 19. l'm not really sure.

123
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,582
我猜我问完了
Well, l guess that should do it.

124
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,394
不过我走之前
能不能再来杯好喝的牛奶？
However, before l go, could l have
another glass of your delicious milk?

125
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,128
当然可以
But of course.

126
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,732
拉帕帝先生
MonSieur LaPadite,

127
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,803
你知道法国人替我取的绰号吗？
are you aware of the nickname
the people of France have given me?

128
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,919
我对这种事没兴趣
l have no interest in such things.

129
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,617
但是你知道他们怎么叫我
But you are aware of what they call me.

130
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,853
我知道
l'm aware.

131
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,128
你知道什么？
What are you aware of?

132
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,237
-他们叫你“犹太人终结者”
-没错
-That they call you ''The Jew Hunter.''
-Precisely.

133
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,175
我了解你很怕说出这个绰号
l understand your trepidation in repeating it.

134
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,581
海德利希很讨厌
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker

135
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,280
布拉格人替他取的绰号
the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.

136
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,619
但是我不t他怎么会讨厌
“刽子手”这绰号
Actually, why he would hate the name
''the Hangman'' is baffling to me.

137
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:49,092
这绰号一定是他尽全力得到的
lt would appear he has done
everything in his power to earn it.

138
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,426
我不同，我特爱我的绰号
Now l, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title

139
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,864
尤其是我努力挣来的
precisely because l've earned it.

140
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,363
这代表跟其他德国军人比起来
The feature that makes me
such an effective hunter of the Jews is,

141
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,134
我猎杀犹太人的效率超高
as opposed to most German soldiers,

142
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,200
我会像犹太人思考
l can think like a Jew

143
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,608
他们只会像德国人思考
where they can only think like a German.

144
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,715
更精准地说，是德国士兵
(CHUCKLlNG) More precisely,
a German soldier.

145
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:23,026
若要以一种动物形容德国人
Now, if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast,

146
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,123
那就是狡猾掠杀的隼鹰
it would be the cunning
and the predatory instinct of a hawk.

147
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,468
若要以一种动物形容犹太人
But if one were to determine what attributes
the Jews share with a beast,

148
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,630
那就是老鼠
it would be that of the rat.

149
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:40,310
元首和戈培尔的宣传部
也这么形容犹太人
The Fuhrer and Goebbels' propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing.

150
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,371
但是我们的结论不同
But where our conclusions differ,

151
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,474
我不认为比较两者是种羞辱
is l don't consider the comparison an insult.

152
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,822
想一想老鼠生活的世界
Consider for a moment
the world a rat lives in.

153
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,887
那是充满敌意的世界
lt's a hostile world, indeed.

154
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,165
假设现在有只老鼠从门前窜过
lf a rat were to scamper
through your front door, right now,

155
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,666
你会对它有敌意吗？
would you greet it with hostility?

156
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,502
我猜会吧
l suppose l would.

157
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:10,508
老鼠曾经做了什么
让你对它们充满敌意？
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create
this animosity you feel toward them?

158
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,005
老鼠会散布疾病，还会咬人
Rats spread disease. They bite people.

159
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:18,346
老鼠的确散播过瘟疫
不过那是很久以前的事
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,
but that's some time ago.

160
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:23,621
让我告诉你
松鼠也能散布老鼠散布的疾病
l propose to you any disease
a rat could spread,
a squirrel could equally carry.

161
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,452
你同意吗？
Would you agree?

162
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,720
但是你对松鼠却没有
Yet, l assume you don't share
the same animosity with squirrels

163
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,559
-对老鼠的敌意，对吧？
-对
-that you do with rats, do you?
-No.

164
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,523
但它们都是啮齿动物呀
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?

165
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,560
除了尾巴，它们长得挺像的
And except for the tail,
they even rather look alike, don't they?

166
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,805
这想法真有趣，上校
lt's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.

167
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,567
不管这想法是多么有趣
However interesting as the thought may be,

168
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,909
你对老鼠的看法不会不一样
it makes not one bit of difference
to how you feel.

169
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,311
要是有一只老鼠跑进来
lf a rat were to walk in here, right now,
as l'm talking

170
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,323
你会替它准备一碟牛奶吗？
would you greet it with a saucer
of your delicious milk?

171
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,189
大概不会吧
Probably not.

172
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,222
我就知道
l didn't think so.

173
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,388
你不喜欢老鼠
You don't like them.

174
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,399
你连为什么不喜欢都不知道
You don't really know
why you don't like them.

175
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,163
只知道你觉得老鼠很恶心
All you know is you find them repulsive.

176
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,465
所以说
一名德国士兵前往一个
Consequently, a German soldier
conducts a search

177
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,066
疑似藏匿犹太人的家里搜查
of a house suspected of hiding Jews.

178
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,571
一只隼鹰会从何找起？
Where does the hawk look?

179
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,844
他会搜查谷仓、阁楼、地窖
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic,
he looks in the cellar,

180
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,350
什么地方他都会仔细搜查
he looks everywhere he would hide.

181
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,484
但有很多藏匿地方隼鹰想不到
But there are so many places
it would never occur to a hawk to hide.

182
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,423
所以元首才会从奥地利
However, the reason the Fuhrer
has brought me off my Alps in Austria

183
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,934
派我到法国的乳牛农场
因为我想得到
and placed me in French cow country today
is because it does occur to me.

184
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,536
因为我知道人一旦放弃尊严
Because l'm aware what tremendous feats
human beings are capable of

185
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,800
会做出多么惊人的举动
once they abandon dignity.

186
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,536
我能抽我的烟斗吗？
May l smoke my pipe as well?

187
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,782
请便，把这里当自己家
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.

188
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,627
现在呢
我的任务就是
Now, my Job dictates

189
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,636
派我的手下进来你家
that l must have my men enter your home

190
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,481
进行仔细地搜查
and conduct a thorough search

191
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,315
然后才能正式把你从名单删掉
before l can officially cross
your family's name off my list.

192
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,990
要是发现任何异状
然而一定会的
And if there are any irregularities
to be found, rest assured they will be.

193
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,288
除非你跟我实话实说
That is unless you have something to tell me

194
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,352
这样一来就不必搜你家了
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.

195
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,693
我要强调，只要你让我
l might add, also, that any information

196
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,463
轻松完成我的任务就不会受罚
that makes the performance of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.

197
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,831
恰好相反，你会受到奖赏
Actually, quite the contrary.
lt will be met with reward.

198
00:17:56,341 --> 00:18:00,506
那就是在我们占领法国期间
And that reward will be,
your family will cease
to be harassed in any way

199
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:05,016
你的家人不会再受到德军骚扰
by the German military during the rest
of our occupation of your country.

200
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,027
你藏匿了德国公敌，对吧？
You're sheltering enemies of the state,
are you not?

201
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,859
对
Yes.

202
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:32,275
你把他们藏在地板下面？
You're sheltering them underneath
your floorboards, aren't you?

203
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,337
对
Yes.

204
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,743
指出他们藏匿的地方
Point out to me the areas
where they're hiding.

205
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,173
我没听见任何骚动
Since l haven't heard any disturbance,

206
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,940
这表示他们听不懂英文
l assume, while they're listening,
they don't speak English.

207
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,440
是的
Yes.

208
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,818
我要再说法文，跟我演下去
l'm going to switch back to French now,
and l want you to follow my masquerade.

209
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,717
明白吗？
ls that clear?
(SNlFFLES)

210
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,882
明白
Yes.

211
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,386
拉帕帝先生...
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Monsieur LaPadite...

212
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,494
...谢谢你请我喝牛奶...
...l thank you for the milk...

213
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,493
...和你的热情招待
...and your hospitality.

214
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,241
我们的事情已经谈完了
l do believe our business here is done.

215
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,474
小姐们
Ah, ladies.

216
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,745
谢谢你们耐心等待
l thank you for your time.

217
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,951
我们不会再麻烦你们了
We shan't be bothering your family
any longer.

218
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,619
先生...
So, Monsieur...

219
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,118
...小姐们
...Mademoiselle.

220
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,462
让我向你们道别并说声...
l bid farewell to you and say...

221
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,626
...再会
...adieu.

222
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,446
是那个女孩
lt's the girl.

223
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,260
再见了，苏珊娜
Au revoir, Shosanna!

224
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,048
第二章
Chapter Two

225
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,608
恶棍特工
lNGLOURlOUS BASTERDS

226
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,346
立正！
ALDO: Ten-hut!

227
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,861
我是艾多雷恩中尉
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.

228
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,888
我要召集一个特种小组
我需要八名士兵
And l'm putting together a special team,
and l need me eight soldiers.

229
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,095
八个犹太裔美籍士兵
Eight Jewish American soldiers.

230
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:49,637
你们大概都听说盟军要大举进攻
Now, you all might've heard rumors
about the armada happening soon.

231
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,437
我们会早他们一步
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.

232
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,944
我们要以平民装扮空降法国
We're going to be dropped into France
dressed as civilians.

233
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,881
一旦进入敌区
Once we're in enemy territory,

234
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,476
就组成一支野战部队
as a bushwhacking guerrilla army,

235
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,887
执行一项任务，只有一项任务
we're going to be doing one thing
and one thing only.

236
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,426
把纳粹党赶尽杀绝
Killing Nazis.

237
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,520
我是不知道你们啦
l don't know about you all,

238
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:14,497
不过我远从大烟山脉
but l sure as hell didn't come down
from the goddamn Smoky Mountains,

239
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,558
横越五千英哩的海面
在西西里冲锋陷阵
cross 5,000 miles of water,
fight my way through half of Sicily

240
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:23,006
然后从他妈的飞机上跳下来
不是为了教纳粹党什么是人性
and Jump out of a fucking airplane
to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.

241
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,167
纳粹党根本没有人性
Nazi ain't got no humanity.

242
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,438
他们是痛恨犹太人的杀人魔
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating,
mass-murdering maniac

243
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,744
而且必须被消灭
and they need to be destroyed.

244
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,484
只要找到穿着纳粹军装的混蛋
That's why any and every son of a bitch
we find wearing a Nazi uniform,

245
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,752
他们都要死
they're going to die.

246
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,161
我的祖先是山地人吉姆布理吉
Now, l'm the direct descendent
of the mountain man Jim Bridger.

247
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,424
所以有一些印地安人血统
That means l got a little lndian in me.

248
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:51,697
我们的战略是阿帕契猎杀行动
And our battle plan
will be that of an Apache resistance.

249
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,102
我们要残杀德国佬
We will be cruel to the Germans.

250
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,772
让他们知道我们有多么狠
And through our cruelty,
they will know who we are.

251
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,207
当他们发现被分尸得
And they will find the evidence
of our cruelty

252
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,247
支离破碎的弟兄同胞
in the disemboweled, dismembered

253
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,978
就会知道我们有多么残酷
and disfigured bodies of their brothers
we leave behind us.

254
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,610
德国佬会忍不住想像
And the German won't be able
to help themselves

255
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:13,385
我们的手段有多残忍
but imagine the cruelty their brothers
endured at our hands,

256
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,495
军靴有多坚硬
刀锋有多锐利
and our boot heels
and the edge of our knives.

257
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,230
德国佬全都会被我们吓死
And the German will be sickened by us.

258
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,528
提到我们就会胆颤心惊
And the German will talk about us.

259
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,796
被吓得屁滚尿流
And the German will fear us.

260
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,829
他们晚上闭上眼睛
And when the German
closes their eyes at night

261
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,206
内心就会受到他们恶行的折磨
and they're tortured by their subconscious
for the evil they have done,

262
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,973
而且一想到我们就更害怕
it will be with thoughts of us
that they are tortured with.

263
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:38,743
听起来不错吧？
Sound good?

264
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,717
是的，长官！
-ALL: Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

265

这就是我要听的

但我要先警告你们这群战士
But l got a word of warning
for all you would-be warriors.

267
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,559
一旦加入，你们就欠了债
When you Join my command,
you take on debit.

268
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,556
欠我个人一笔债
A debit you owe me, personally.

269

我麾下的士兵都欠我
100个纳粹党的头皮
Each and every man under my command
owes me 100 Nazi scalps.

270
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,772

And l want my scalps.

271
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:08,774
你们要从100个死纳粹党脑袋
剥掉100个纳粹党的头皮
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps
taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.

272
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,407
拼了命都要给我办到
Or you will die trying!

273
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,545
不、不、不！
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

274
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:18,681
我还要忍受这些犹太猪多久？
How much more of these Jew swine
must l endure?

275
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,125
他们把我的士兵当苍蝇杀光光
They butcher my men like they were flies!

276
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:29,432
你知道我的士兵吓得魂飞魄散
传出什么谣言吗？
Do you know the latest rumor
they've conJured up
in their fear-induced delirium?

277
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:30,895
其中有一个...

00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,063

00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,241
那个叫“犹太熊”的恶棍...

280
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,873
...简直就是杀人幽灵

281
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,741
元首，这只是八卦而已
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
My Fuhrer, this is Just soldiers' gossip.

282
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,417
没人相信“犹太熊”是杀人幽灵
No one really believes ''The Bear Jew''
is a Golem.

283
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:47,776
为什么？
Why not?

284
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,046
他们像亡灵一样逃过追捕
They seem to be able to elude capture
like an apparition.

285
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,654

They seem to be able to appear and
disappear at will.

286
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:00,058
你们想证明他们有血有肉？
You want to prove they're flesh and blood?

287
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,562
那就把他们抓来！
Then bring them to me!

288
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:08,395
我要剥光他们
倒吊在巴黎铁塔
l will hang them naked, by their heels,
from the Eiffel Tower!

289
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,574
然后再把尸体丢进下水道...
And then throw their bodies in the sewers...

290
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:16,176
...让巴黎的老鼠享用大餐！
...for the rats of Paris to feast!

291
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,013
克利斯！

l have an order l want relayed to all
German soldiers stationed in France.

294
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:36,599
那个叫“犹太熊”的恶棍
从此不准有人这么叫他
The Jew degenerate
known as ''The Bear Jew,''
henceforth, is never to be referred
to as The Bear Jew again.

295
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,230
是，元首
(KLIEST SPEAKING GERMAN)
Yes, my Fuhrer!

296
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,601
您还想见巴兹二等兵吗？
Do you still wish to see Private Butz?

297
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,898
巴兹二等兵是什么东东？
Who and what is a Private Butz?

298
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,374
他是您要亲自接见的大兵
He's the soldier
you wanted to see personally.

299
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,305
他的小队被恶棍特工突袭
His squad was ambushed
by Lt. Raine's Jews.

300
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,482
他是唯一的生还者
He was its only survivor.

301
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,883
没错，我要见他，谢谢提醒

00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,748
派他进来
Send him in.

303
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:12,303
突袭过后，只有我
芮曼中士和洛魏没有死
(BUTZ SPEAKING GERMAN)
Sergeant Rachtmann, Ludwig and l
were the only ones left alive
after the ambush.

304
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:17,740
一个人看守我们
其他人在剥死人头皮
While one man guarded us,
the rest removed the hair.

305
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,209
喂，赫希堡
Hey, Hirschberg.

306
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,578
把德国中士押过来

韦纳芮曼中士

309
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,446
艾多雷恩中尉，幸会

你知道“坐下来”的意思吧？

311
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,152

-Yes.
-Then sit down.

312
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,725
你的英文好不好？
How is your English, Werner?

313
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,701
有需要的话，几位弟兄会翻译
Because if need be, we got
a couple of fellows who can translate.

314
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:52,929
魏奇呢
Wicki here,

315
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,269
是个奥地利籍犹太人
趁情况尚好时逃出慕尼黑
an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out
of Munich while the getting was good.

回来找你们报仇
Became American, got drafted,
come back to give y'all what for.

317
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,441
上面那个你可能认得

you might be familiar with.

318
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,483
雨果史提格中士
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.

319
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,282
听过他吗？
Heard of him?

320
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:13,017
每名德军都听过雨果史提格
Everybody in the German Army
has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.

321
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:21,727
雨果史提格

322
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,866
雨果大名鼎鼎的原因很简单
MALE NARRATOR.; The reaSon
for Hugo Stiglitz'S celebrity
among German SoldierS iS Simple.

323
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:33,569
身为德军士兵
他却杀了13名盖世太保军官
AS a German-enliSted man,
he killed 13 GeStapo officerS.

324
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,884
但是德军高层领导饶他一命
InStead of putting him up againSt a wall,

325
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,828
反而决定把他送回柏林
the High Command
decided to Send him back to Berlin

326
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,798
藉以杀鸡儆猴
to be made an example of.

327
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,666
不用说
当恶棍特工听到他的事
NeedleSS to Say,
once the BaSterdS heard about him,

328
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,973
他就没被送回柏林
he never got there.

329
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,579
雨果史提格中士？
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?

330
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,879
艾多雷恩中尉
这些是恶棍特工
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.

331
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,612
听过吗？
Ever heard of us?

332
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,148
我只想说我们是你的大粉丝
We Just want to say
we're a big fan of your work.

333
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,419
就刺杀纳粹来说
When it comes to killing Nazis,

334
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,926
我觉得你很有才华
l think you show great talent.

335
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,798
我看人一向很准
And l pride myself for having an eye
for that kind of talent.

336
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:10,469
不过你只是业余的B咖
But your status as a Nazi killer
is still amateur.

337
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,501
我们想知道你想不想当A咖
We all come here to see
if you want to go pro.

338
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,684
我假设你听过我们的名号
Can l assume you know who we are?

339
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,756
你是阿帕契人艾多
You're Aldo the Apache.

340
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,958
你听过我们
Werner, if you heard of us,

341
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,689
应该知道
咱们不干抓战俘这门生意
you probably heard we ain't
in the prisoner-taking business.

342
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:35,698
只干杀光纳粹的生意
而且这门生意兴隆
We in the killing Nazi business,
and, cousin, business is a-booming.

343
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,358
没错
HlRSCHBERG:
(LAUGHlNG) Oh, yeah.

344
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,194
现在我们只有两个选择
Now, that leaves two ways
we can play this out.

345
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,500
毙了你或是放你走
Either kill you or let you go.

346
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,134
你能不能活着走出壕沟
Whether or not you're going
to leave this ditch alive

347
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,178
全要看你的选择
depends entirely on you.

348
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,212
前面不远有一座果园
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.

349
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:59,055
除了你们
我们知道那里也有巡逻队
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut
patrol fucking around here somewhere.

350
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,051
要是其中有个神枪手
lf that patrol were to have any crack shots,

351
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,129
他就会高兴得不得了
that orchard would be
a goddamn sniper's delight.

352
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,663
你想再吃到德国酸菜三明治
So if you ever want to eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again,

353
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,561
就得在地图上指出他们的位置
you got to show me on
this here map where they are.

354
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:18,840
你得告诉我那里有多少德军
你也得告诉我
You got to tell me how many they are,
and you got to tell me

355
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,378
他们拥有什么样的火力
what kind of artillery
they're carrying with them.

356
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:27,045
你该不会认为我会透露军情
让同胞的生命陷入危险吧
You can't expect me to divulge information
that would put German lives in danger.

357
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:32,079
小韦，你错了
我就是这么认为
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're
wrong, because that's exactly what l expect.

358
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,087
我得知道有多少德军躲在树丛

And you need to tell me.

363
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,343
我恭敬地拒绝
l respectfully refuse, sir.

364
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,312
听到吗？
Hear that?

365
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,811
听到
Yes.

366
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,755
那是唐尼唐诺维兹中士
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.

367
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,755
你可能对他的绰号比较熟
You might know him better by his nickname.

368
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,592
犹太熊
The Bear Jew.

369
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,726
你听过阿帕契人艾多
一定也听过犹太熊
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache,
you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.

370
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,738
-我听过犹太熊
-你听过他什么事？
-l heard of The Bear Jew.
-What did you hear?

371
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,275
他用棒子打死德国士兵
Beats German soldiers with a club.

372
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,441
他用球棒把敌人的脑袋打爆
He bashes their brains in
with a baseball bat, what he does.

373
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,874
小韦，我再问你最后一次
And, Werner, l'm going to ask you
one last goddamn time,

374
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,943
你再恭敬地拒绝
我就要把犹太熊叫来
and if you still respectfully refuse,
l'm calling The Bear Jew over.

375
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,988
他会拿着他那根大球棒
He's going to take that big bat of his,

376
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:41,150
打到你的脑袋开花
and he's going to
beat your ass to death with it.

377
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,327
给我用你舔过德国香肠的手指
Now, take your
Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger,

378
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,389
在地图上指出我要的情报
and point out on this map
what l want to know.

379
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,102
去你的
Fuck you.

380
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,211
也去你的犹太走狗
And your Jew dogs.

381
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,841
老实说，你把我们逗得很乐
Actually, Werner,
we're all tickled to hear you say that.

382
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,783
因为看唐尼把纳粹活活给打死
Quite frankly, watching Donny
beat Nazis to death

383
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,754
就像看电影一样
唐尼！
is the closest we ever get
to going to the movies. Donny!

384
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,949
是
DONNY: Yeah?

385
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,515
这里有个德国佬想为国牺牲
Got us a German here
who wants to die for country.

386
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,594
让他如愿以偿吧
Oblige him.

387
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,029
这是你杀犹太人得到的奖章？
Did you get that for killing Jews?

388
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,925
英勇奖章
Bravery.

389
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:48,911
哦，不
BASTERD 1 : Oh, no!

390
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,180
哦，不
BASTERD 2: Oh, no!

391
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,881
唐尼！
Donny!

392
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,149
唐尼
BASTERD: Yeah, Donny!

393
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:56,189
换作是我，早就挫赛了
About now l'd be shitting
my pants if l was you.

394
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,290
全垒打王又击出一支红不让
Teddy Fucking Williams
knocks it out of the park!

395
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:04,027
全场的球迷都欢声雷动
Fenway Park is on its feet
for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!

396
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,038
他把球打到球场外的街上
He went yard on that one,
on to fucking Lansdowne Street!

397
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,664
你！
You!

398
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,141
该死，赫希堡
Damn it, Hirschberg!

399
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:17,113
唐尼，把另一个带来，活的！
Donny, bring that other one over here. Alive!

400
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:20,282
给我站起来，轮到下一名打者
Get the fuck up! Batter up. You're on deck!

401
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,281
我K你，你就会应声倒地
Two hits. l hit you, you hit the ground.

402
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,222
会说英文吗？
English?

403
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,182
魏奇
ALDO: Wicki.

404
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,397
问他想不想活
Ask him if he wants to live.

405
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,964
叫他指出德军的位置
Tell him to point out on this map
the German position.

406
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,808
问他人数有多少
Ask him how many Germans.

407
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,673
大约12个
Around about 1 2.

408
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,714
他们有什么火力？
What kind of artillery?

409
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,148
你怎么能活着回来？
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
How did you survive this ordeal?

410
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,720
他们放我走
They let me go.

411
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,520
当你报告这件事
Now, when you report what happened here,

412
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:07,257
千万别说你泄密，你会被枪决
you can't tell them you told us
what you told us. They'll shoot you.

413
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:11,199
他们会想知道你有多特别
我们才会饶你一命
They're going to want to know
why you so special, we let you live.

414
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,999
所以告诉他们
我们要你替我们打广告
So tell them, we let you live so you could
spread the word through the ranks

415
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,506
遇到我们的德军会死得很惨
what's going to happen
to every Nazi we find.

416
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:22,337
你啥都不准说
一个字都不准说
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
You are not to tell anybody anything.
Not one word of detail!

417
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,315
只能说你们被突袭，你逃走了
Your outfit was ambushed,
and you got away!

418
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,619
然后就乖乖闭嘴
Not one word more!

419
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,082
是，元首
Yes, my Fuhrer.

420
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,356
你像别的生还者留下刻印吗？
Did they mark you like they did
the other survivors?

421
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,558
是的，元首
Yes, my Fuhrer.

422
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,329
你没战死，回家后要干嘛？
Now that you've survived the war,
when you get home, what you going to do?

423
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,972
我要抱着我娘死都不放
l will hug my mother like
l've never hugged her before.

424
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,668
他要抱他娘
WlCKl: He's going to hug his mother.

425
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,539
真孝顺
Well, ain't that nice?

426
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,974
问他会不会脱掉军服？
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.

427
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,114
我不但会脱掉，还会烧掉
(BUTZ SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Not only shall l remove it,
but l intend to burn it.

428
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,487
他会把它烧掉
WlCKl: He's going to burn it.

429
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,485
我就知道，这可不行
Yeah, that's what we thought.
We don't like that.

430
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:12,485
咱们喜欢穿军服的纳粹
这样才能立刻认出来
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.

431
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,463
一眼就认出来
Just like that.

432
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:22,935
脱掉军服就没人知道你是纳粹
But you take off that uniform,
ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.

433
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,201
咱们会很不爽
And that don't sit well with us.

434
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,873
所以我要给你脱不掉的东西
So l'm going to give you
a little something you can't take off.

435
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,726
中尉，你的手艺愈来愈好
You know, Lieutenant,
you're getting pretty good at that.

436
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,397
你知道怎样才能登上小巨蛋？
You know how you
get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?

437
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,930
苦练
Practice.

438
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,600

明天要演什么？

麦克斯林德影展
A Max Linder festival.

447
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,883
我一向都喜欢林德甚于卓别林
l always preferred Linder to Chaplin.

448
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,678
只是他从来没拍过
比《孤儿流浪记》更好的作品
Except Linder never made a film
as good as ''The Kid.''

449
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,354
那部片的高潮追逐戏太赞了
The chase climax of ''The Kid,'' superb.

450
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,356
我很喜欢这家电影院

谢谢
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)

453
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:35,829
我是不是老板？
Do l own it?

454
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,396
对
-Oui.

455
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,099
是的
Oui.

456
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,673
你这么年轻怎会拥有电影院？
How is it a girl as young as you
owns a cinema?

457
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,183
我婶婶留给我的
My aunt left it to me.

458
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,081
谢谢你举办德国之夜影展
Merci for hosting a German night.

459
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,815
我别无选择...
l don't have a choice...

460
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,789
...但是不客气
...but you're welcome.

461
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,156
我很喜欢莱芬斯坦的作品...

462
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,525
...尤其是《匹茨帕吕的白色地狱》
...especially Piz Palu.

463
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,030
法国女生会崇拜莱芬斯坦很棒
lt's nice to see a French girl
who's an admirer of Riefenstahl.

464
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,625
我不会用“崇拜”这个词...
''Admire'' would not really be
the word l would use...

465
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,363
...来形容我对莱芬斯坦的感觉
...to describe my feelings towards
Fraulein Riefenstahl.

466
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,006
但你一定很欣赏导演帕布斯特
But you do admire the director Pabst,
don't you?

467
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,977
所以你才会把他放在看板上...
That's why you include his name
on the marquee...

468
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,180
...而其实没这必要
...when you didn't have to.

469
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:28,489
法国人一向都尊敬任何导演
l'm French.
We respect directors in our country.

470
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,691
就算是德国导演
Even Germans.

471
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,786
就算是德国导演，对
Even Germans, oui.

谢谢你的帮忙，再见

你还没换完看板

474
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,168
我明天一早再换

请问你的芳名是？

476

艾曼纽米敏优

你看完了吗？
Are you finished with my papers?

481
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,297
小姐，容我自我介绍...
Mademoiselle, may l introduce myself...

482
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,830
...我是弗德列克佐勒

多谢夸奖

00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,407
但是请你别再来烦我
Regardless, l want you to stop pestering me.

495
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,488
很抱歉，小姐...
l apologize, mademoiselle...

496
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,914
...我并不想当烦人精
...l wasn't trying to be a pest.

497
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,193
我只是想当朋友
l was simply trying to be friendly.

498
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,829
我不想当你的朋友
l don't wish to be your friend.

499
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,225
为什么？
Why not?

500
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,863
别幼稚了，你明知道原因
Don't act like an infant. You know why.

501
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,637
我不只是德国士兵
l'm more than Just a uniform.

502
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,367
对我来说你就是
Not to me.

503
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,739
如果你这么想交法国女友...
lf you are so desperate
for a French girlfriend...

504
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,336
...我建议你去维琪城
...l suggest you try Vichy.

505
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,811
你是什么人？
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Who are you?

506
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:37,947
我以为我只是个德国士兵
l thought l was Just a uniform.

507
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,983
你不只是德国士兵
You're not Just a German soldier.

508
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,949
你是高官子弟吗？
Are you somebody's son?

509
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,454
德国士兵通常都是某人的子弟
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.

510
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:20,754
你很幸运交到战争英雄男友
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
You're a very lucky girl,
catching a brave war hero.

511
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,655

--No, no, no, no, the
mademoiselle is not my girlfriend.

512
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,319
你能签“亲爱的芭碧”吗？
Can you write ''Amour Babette''?

513
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,353
原来你是战争英雄
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
So you're a war hero.

514
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,622
你做了什么？
What did you do?

515
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,727
我一个人死守围城的钟塔
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
l was alone in a bell tower
in a walled off city.

516
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,191
我在鸟巢里只有一千发子弹...
lt was myself and a thousand
rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest...

517
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,662
...必须对抗三百名敌军
...against three hundred enemy soldiers.

518
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,805
什么是鸟巢？
What's a bird's nest?

519
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,902
狙击手对钟塔的说法
A bird's nest is what a sniper
would call a bell tower.

520
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,348
钟塔很高，有360度视野
lt's a high structure, offering
a three hundred and sixty degree view.

521
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,444
对神枪手来说极占优势
Very advantageous for marksmen.

522
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,422
你杀了几个敌军？
How many did you kill?

523
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,050
68个
Sixty-eight.

524
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,387
第1天
The first day.

525
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,960
150个...
A hundred and fifty...

526
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,095
...第2天
...the second day.

527
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,205
32个，第3天
Thirty-two the third day.

528
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,538
到了第4天，敌军就撤退
On the fourth day they exited the city.

529
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:51,812
我的事迹在德国家喻户晓...
Naturally, my war story received a
lot of attention in Germany...

530
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,241
...所以大家都认得我
...that's why they all recognize me.

531
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,451
他们称我为德国的约克中士
They call me the German Sergeant York.

532
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,190
也许还想把你的故事拍成电影
Maybe they'll make a film
about your exploits.

533
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,453
约瑟夫戈培尔导演也这么想
Well, that's Just what
Joseph Goebbels thought.

534
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,764
于是拍了一部《祖国的荣耀》
So he did and called it ''Nation's Pride.''

535
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:14,503
他们要我演我自己...
And they wanted me to play myself...

536
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,397
...于是我就去演了
...so l did.

537
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,908
约瑟夫认为这是他的旷世巨作
Joseph thinks this movie will
be proven to be his masterpiece.

538
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,738
我也会是德国的范强生
And l will be the German Van Johnson.

539
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,411
《祖国的荣耀》讲的是你？
''Nation's Pride'' is about you?

540
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,775
你也是男主角？
''Nation's Pride'' is starring you?

541
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,214
我知道
l know.

542
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,050
很可笑吧？
Comical?

543
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:35,489
祝你的电影成功
也祝你和约瑟夫万事如意
Well, good luck with your movie, Private.
l hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.

544
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,661
再见
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Goodbye!

545
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:51,430
-你需要帮忙吗？
-不用，我行
-Do you need help?
-No, it's okay.

546
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:52,702
需要我的话，我在仓库
lf you need me, l'll be in the
storage room.

547
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:54,676
好的，我的爱
Okay, my love.

548
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,077
米敏优小姐？
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Mademoiselle Mimieux?

549
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,606
是的
Yes?

550
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,150
这是你的电影院？
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
ls this your cinema?

551
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,712
对

00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,653
下来！
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Come down!

553
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,958
请下来
Please.

554
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,806
我不懂，我做了什么？
l don't understand. What have l done?
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)

555
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,181
她想知道她做了什么
She wants to know what she's done.

556
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,947
给我上车
Get your ass in that car.

557
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:35,109
黑奴的后代
才让美国参加体育竞赛有竞争力
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
lt's only the offspring of slaves that allows
America to be competitive athletically.

558
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,448
只有黑人才能替美国
赢得奥运金牌
American Olympic gold can be
measured in Negro sweat.

559
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,577
约瑟夫戈培尔博士
希特勒第三帝国的第二把交椅

560
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,164
很好，你来了
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Good, you came.

561
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,532
我不确定你肯不肯接受邀请
l wasn't sure whether or not
you'd accept my invitation.

562
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:01,395
邀请？
lnvitation?

563
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:02,904
你说的就是这个女生？
(GOEBBELS SPEAKlNG GERMAN)

564
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,600
是的，戈培尔博士
ls that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Yes, it is, Dr. Goebbels.

565
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,409
艾曼纽，我希望你认识一个人
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Emmanuelle, there is somebody
l want you to meet.

566
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:13,943
艾曼纽米敏优
容我介绍宣传部长...
Emmanuelle Mimieux, l'd like to introduce
you to the minister of propaganda...

567
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,314
...以及德国电影工业的领导
...the leader of
the entire German film industry...

568
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:21,622
...我当了演员后也是我的老板
约瑟夫戈培尔博士
...and now that l'm an actor, my boss,
Dr. Joseph Goebbels.

569
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:24,517
我早就久仰你的大名
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Your reputation precedes you,
Fraulein Mimieux.

570
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:34,299
这位是戈培尔先生的口译官...
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels'
French interpreter...

571
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,229
...法兰茜丝孟迪娜小姐
...Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.

572
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,864
你好
Hello.

573
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:44,070
你好
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Hello.

574
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,950
你见过少校了
And you've met the MaJor.

575
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,852
我还没有自我介绍
盖世太保狄特韩斯壮少校
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Actually, l didn't introduce myself.
MaJor Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo.

576
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,290
为你效劳，小姐
At your service, mademoiselle.

577
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,219
让我来...
Please allow me...

578
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,487
...请坐
...have a seat, please.

579
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,995
喝点香槟，非常好喝
Try the champagne, mademoiselle,
it's quite good.

580
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:19,348
我得说你让我有点生气
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
l must say, Fraulein,
l should be rather annoyed with you.

581
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,184
我来到法国...
l arrive in France...

582
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,517
...想和我的男主角吃午饭
...and l wish to have lunch with my star.

583
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,380
却不知道...
Little do l know...

584
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,357
...他在巴黎大受欢迎
...he's become the toast of Paris.

585
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:35,029
他还得挤出时间来见我
And now he must find time for me.

586
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:42,030
一般人通常要排队个几小时
或是几天才能见到我
People wait in line hours, days to see me.

587
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,201
可是要见元首...
For the Fuhrer...

588
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,538
...和佐勒二等兵就轮到我排队
...and Private Zoller, l wait.

589
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:54,446
现在终于能够晋见这位大明星
So finally, l'm granted an audience
with the young Private.

590
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,056
他却一直谈你和你的电影院
And he spends the entire lunch speaking
of you and your cinema.

591
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,358
那就不如快点谈正事吧
So Fraulein Mimieux,
let's get down to business.

592
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:03,586
...戈培尔博士...
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
--Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels...

593
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,024
我还没告诉她
l haven't informed her yet.

594
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,087
除非她是呆子，应该早就想到
Unless the girl's a simpleton,
l'm sure she's figured it out by now.

595
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,888
毕竟，她经营一家电影院
After all, she does operate a cinema.

596
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,425
法兰茜丝，告诉她
Francesca, tell her.
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)

597
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,531
他们想告诉你，佐勒二等兵...
What they are trying to tell you,
Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller...

598
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:18,130
...一直想说服戈培尔先生...
...has spent the last hour at lunch trying
to convince Monsieur Goebbels...

599
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,801
...把原先举行电影首映会的场地...
...to abandon previous plans for
Private Zoller's film premiere...

600
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,906
...换到你经营的电影院
...and change the venue to your cinema.

601
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,072
什么？
What?

602
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,807
我要自己告诉她
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)

603
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:31,153
对不起，那是当然的
l wanted to inform her.
Shit! l apologize, Private, of course you did.

604
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,414
...怎么了？
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
--What's the issue?

605
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,088
佐勒想亲自告诉这位小姐
The Private wanted to inform
the mademoiselle himself.

606
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:37,585
荒谬！
Nonsense!

607
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,927
我要先问问题，才轮到他说话
Until l ask my questions,
he has nothing to inform.

608
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:45,064
请正式记录
我没同意更换我的首映会场地
Let the record state, l have not agreed
to switch cinemas for my premiere.

609
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,062
遵命
Duly noted.

610
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,906
你有包厢吗？
You have opera boxes?

611
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:56,269
有
Yes.

612
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,338
几个？
How many?

613
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,243
两个
Two.

614
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:04,344
多一点会更好
More would be better.

615
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:07,253
大厅有几个座位？
(GOEBBELS SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
How many seats in your auditorium?

616
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:08,950
350个
Three hundred and fifty.

617
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:15,961
比丽池大戏院少四百个座位
That's almost four hundred less
than The Ritz.

618
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:17,631
...可是，戈培尔博士...
--But Dr. Goebbels...

619
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,261
...那并不是件坏事
...that's not such a terrible thing.

620
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,870
你自己也说不想让每个
伪善的法国佬...
You said yourself you didn't want to
indulge every two-faced French bourgeois...

621
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:23,997
...占这么多位子
...taking up space, currying favor.

622
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,201
座位少一些，首映会就更特别
With less seats, it makes the
event more exclusive.

623
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:31,103
你不必吸引观众
观众要抢破头才进得去
You're not trying to fill the house,
they're fighting for seats.

624
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,449
而且管它的法国佬
Besides, to hell with the French.

625
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:37,320
这是德国之夜、德国电影
德国光荣的一刻
This is a German night, a German event,
a German celebration.

626
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,381
这一夜属于你、我...
This night is for you, me...

627
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,925
...德军、高层领导...
...for the German military,
the high command...

628
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,017
...以及他们的亲朋好友
...their family and friends.

629
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,424
唯一能够入场的...
The only people who should
be allowed in the room...

630
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,862
...只有受到故事感动的观众
...are people who will be moved by
the exploits on the screen.

631
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,366
你愈来愈会说话了
l see your public speaking has improved.

632
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,870
看来我创造了一个怪物
lt appears l've created a monster.

633
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,348
很有说服力的怪物
A strangely persuasive monster.

634
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,255
战争结束后，你会进入政治圈
When the war is over, politics await.

635
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,068
二等兵...
Well, Private...

636
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,941
...虽然你想做什么我都同意...
...though it is true,
l'm inclined to indulge you anything...

637
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:38,779
但我得先在她的戏院看场电影
l must watch a film in this young lady's
cinema before l can say, yes or no.

638
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:46,279
所以这位小姐
今晚你要举行一场私人试片会
So young lady, you are to close your
cinema for a private screening tonight.

639
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,094
你有什么德国片？
What German films do you have?

640
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,091
蓝达，你来了
Ah, Landa, you are here.

641
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,999
这是纳粹党卫军汉斯蓝达上校
(FREDRlCK SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Emmanuelle, this is Colonel Hans Landa
of the SS.

642
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,539
他会负责首映会的保安
He'll be running the security
for the premiere.

643
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:10,610
幸会了，小姐
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Charmed, mademoiselle.

644
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,555
再见了，苏珊娜
HANS: Au revoir, Shosanna!

645
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:25,155
我得替部长安排下一个行程
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
And now l must get the Reich Minister
to his next appointment.

646
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:27,763
她是个奴隶头子
Slave driver.

647
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,760
法国奴隶头子
French slave driver.

648
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:39,132
身为这场首映会的
保安主管，我必须...
(HANS SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Actually, in my role as security chief
of this Joyous
German occasion, l'm afraid l must...

649
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,741
...和米敏优小姐谈谈
...have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.

650
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,171
谈什么？
(FREDRlCK SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
What sort of discussion?

651
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:51,983
你这二等兵好像在质疑
我这个上校的命令
(HANS SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
That sounded suspiciously like a Private
questioning the order of a Colonel.

652
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,756
还是我想太多了？
Or am l Just being sensitive?

653
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,918
并不是这样，上校
(FREDRlCK SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Nothing could be further
from the truth, Colonel.

654
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,456
我绝不怀疑您的权力
Your authority is beyond question.

655
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,160
但是有关您的传闻
But your reputation does precede you.

656
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,623
我和米敏优小姐应该担心吗？
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
or myself be concerned?

657
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,990
汉斯，这小子并无恶意...
(GOEBBELS SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Hans, the boy means no harm...

658
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:07,159
...他只是出于爱意
...he's simply smitten.

659
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,472
不过你的确是恶名昭彰
And he's correct. Your reputation
does precede you.

660
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,640
放心，身为保安主管
我只是想...
(HANS SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
No need for concern, you two. As security
chief, l simply need to have a chat...

661
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,975
...和新场地的老板谈谈
...with the possible new venue's
property owner.

662
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,991
你尝过这里的苹果酥皮卷吗？
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Have you tried the strudel here?

663
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:35,790
没有
No, no.

664
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,291
其实不错吃
lt's not so terrible.

665
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:43,730
你和那位二等兵怎么会认识？
So how is it the young Private and
yourself came to be acquainted?

666
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,845
两份苹果酥皮卷
一份给我，一份给小姐
Yes, two strudels. One for myself and
one for the mademoiselle.

667
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,010
我要一杯义式浓缩咖啡
这位小姐...
For me a cup of espresso
and for the mademoiselle...

668
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,512
...来杯牛奶
...a glass of milk.

669
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,689
小姐，你正要解释...
So, mademoiselle, you were
beginning to explain...?

670
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:09,362
几天前，我没听过佐勒二等兵...
Up until a couple of days ago, l had no
knowledge of Private Zoller...

671
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,057
...或是他的丰功伟业
...or his exploits.

672
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:13,192
对我来说...
To me...

673
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,700
...他只是一位观众
我们聊过几次，但是...
...the Private was simply Just a patron
of my cinema. We spoke a few times but--

674
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,866
...小姐，容我打个岔
--Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.

675
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,441
这只是例行公事
This is a simple formality.

676
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,205
你没理由这么紧张
No reason for you to feel anxious.

677
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,884
抱歉，我忘了点鲜奶油
l apologize, l forgot to order the cream.

678
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:36,551
...请稍等
--One moment.

679
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,129
等鲜奶油来了再吃
Wait for the cream.

680
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,916
艾曼纽，我能这么叫你吗？
So, Emmanuelle.
May l call you Emmanuelle?

681
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,075
可以
Oui.

682
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,917
艾曼纽...
So, Emmanuelle...

683
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:09,816
...解释给我听...
...explain to me...

684
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,919
...你这么年轻
怎么会拥有一家电影院？
...how does it happen, that a young lady
such as yourself, comes to own a cinema?

685
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,467
你先请
After you.

686
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:44,953
怎样？
Verdict?

687
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,994
我说过，不错吃吧
Like l said, not so terrible.

688
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,972
你正在解释拥有电影院的事
You were explaining the origin
of your cinema ownership.

689
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:04,139
它本来是我叔叔和婶婶的
The cinema originally belonged
to my aunt and uncle.

690
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,312
他们叫什么？
What are their names?

691
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:08,945
尚皮耶和艾黛米敏优
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.

692
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,148
现在他们人呢？
Where are they now?

693
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,986
我叔叔死于闪电战
My uncle was killed during Blitzkrieg.

694
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:15,848
真可怜
Pity.

695
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,952
请继续说
Continue.

696
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:21,694
艾黛婶婶去年春天死于热病
Aunt Ada passed away
from fever last spring.

697
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:23,290
真遗憾
Regrettable.

698
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,732
你有一名黑人员工，对吧？
lt's come to my attention you have a
Negro in your employ. ls that true?

699
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:30,830
对
Oui.

700
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:33,801
他是法国人
He is a Frenchman.

701
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,337
他叫马瑟
His name is Marcel.

702
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:41,642
他从电影院开张后就做到现在
He worked with my aunt and uncle
since they opened the cinema.

703
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,854
除了他就没别的员工
He's the only other one who works with me.

704
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,178
他是做什么的？
Doing what?

705
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:47,514
他是放映师
ProJectionist.

706
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,316
技术好吗？
ls he any good?

707
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,584
最优秀的
The best.

708
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,858
看得出这工作对那种人最适合
Actually, one could see where that
might be a good trade for them.

709
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,007
你也会操作放映机吗？
Can you operate the proJectors?

710
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:06,701
当然会
Of course l can.

711
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,071
以我对戈培尔部长的了解...
Knowing the Reich Minister as l do...

712
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:14,774
我很确定...
l'm quite positive...

713
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:19,347
...他绝对不会把首映会的成败...
...he wouldn't want the success
or failure of his illustrious evening...

714
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,552
...交到一个黑人手中
...dependent on the prowess of a Negro.

715
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,252
所以...
So...

716
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:27,858
...如果我们真的...
...if it comes to pass...

717
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,591
...要在你的戏院举行首映会...
...we hold this event at your venue...

718
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:35,636
...虽然你的黑人员工技术优良...
...talented no doubt,
as your Negro may be...

719
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,098
...但是你必须...
...you will...

720
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,609
...亲自操作放映机
...operate the proJectors.

721
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:46,809
你能接受吗？
ls that acceptable?

722
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,474
可以
Oui.

723
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,077
来根香烟？
Cigarette?

724
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,315
这不是法国烟
They are not French.

725
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:57,283
这是德国烟
They are German.

726
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,509
我另外有件事想问你
l did have something else
l wanted to ask you.

727
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:32,618
不过我一下子突然想不起来
But right now, for the life of me,
l can't remember what it is.

728
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,964
无所谓，一定不重要
Oh, well, must not have been important.

729
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,194
今晚见
'Til tonight.

730
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:54,113
我挺喜欢这间朴实的电影院
(GOEBBELS SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
l must say, l appreciate the modesty
of this cinema.

731
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,881
非常庄重，几乎像是教堂
Your cinema has real respect, almost
church like.

732
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:01,680
别说我们不能弄得更豪华
Not to say we couldn't spruce the
place up a bit.

733
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:06,189
也许我会去罗浮宫
挑几尊希腊雕像摆在大厅
Maybe l'll go to the Louvre,
pick up a few Greek nudes,
and scatter them about the lobby.

734
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:10,361
你喜欢《幸运小子》吗？
So, Emmanuelle, how did
you like ''Lucky Kids''?

735
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:12,925
我很喜欢莉莲哈维
(SHOSANNA SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
l quite like Lilian Harvey.

736
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:15,904
那叛逃的贱人！
(GOEBBELS SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Lilian Harvey!

737
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,569
别在我面前提到这名字！
Never mention that name again
in my presence!

738
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:45,029
我们该怎么做？
Hey...
...what the fuck are we supposed to do?

739
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:49,533
我们要替纳粹举办首映会
lt looks like we're supposed
to have a Nazi premiere.

740
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,233
我问你，我们该怎么做？
Like l said,
what the fuck are we supposed to do?

741
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,741
我得跟你好好谈谈
Well, l need to talk with you about that.

742
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,878
我不懂，你在说什么？
l'm confused, what are we talking about?

743
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:07,214
让电影院挤满纳粹然后烧掉它
Filling the cinema with Nazis
and burning it down to the ground.

744
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:08,583
说这件事的不是我
l'm not talking about that.

745
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,085
而是你
You are talking about that.

746
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,487
现在说这件事的是我们
No, we're talking about that, right now.

747
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,728
我们能避免电影院被烧掉...
lf we can keep this place from burning
down by ourselves...

748
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,063
...也能故意把电影院烧掉
...we can burn it down by ourselves?

749
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,298
没错，我们办得到
Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.

750
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,303
我们有350部硝酸盐胶卷影片...
And with Madame Mimieux's
350 nitrate film print collection...

751
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,608
...根本不需要炸药
...we wouldn't even need explosives...

752
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:31,671
...对吧？
...would we?

753
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:34,776
你是说不需要更多炸药吧
(SCOFFS)
You mean we wouldn't need
any more explosives?

754
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:39,453
当时
35厘米硝酸盐胶卷非常易燃
MALE NARRATOR.; At that time,
35 millimeter nitrate film waS So flammable

755
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:42,582
就连一卷胶卷也不准带上电车
that you couldn't even
bring a reel onto a Streetcar.

756
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,522
你不能把胶卷带上车
Hey, you can't bring those here
on a public vehicle.

757
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,027
-那些是电影胶卷，对吧？
-对
-They're films, ain't they?
-Yes.

758
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,858
那是易燃物，给我下车
Then they're flammable. Go on, hop off.

759
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:51,764
硝酸盐胶卷比纸张易燃三倍
MALE NARRATOR.; BecauSe nitrate film
burnS three timeS faSter than paper.

760
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,431
苏珊娜收藏了
ShoSanna haS a collection

761
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:02,535
350多部硝酸盐胶卷影片
of over 350 nitrate film printS.

762
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,612
我要在首映会当晚把戏院烧掉
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
l am going to burn down the cinema
on Nazi night.

763
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,714
就算我也会被烧死...
And if l'm going to burn down the cinema...

764
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,181
...那是一定会的...
...which l am...

765
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,458
...我们都知道你不会让我单独做
...we both know, you're not
going to let me do it by myself.

766
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:28,169
因为你爱我，我也爱你
你是我在世上唯一能信任的人
Because you love me. And l love you.
And you're the only person on this earth
l can trust.

767
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:32,806
但我们要做的不仅如此
But that's not all we're going to do.

768
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,302
阁楼的摄影器材还能用吗？
Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic
still work?

769
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,244
我知道摄影机能用
收音器材呢？
l know the film camera does.
How about the sound recorder?

770
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:41,645
还能用
Quite well, actually.

771
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:46,348
我上周用来录一位吉他手
效果超赞
l recorded a new guitarist l met
in a cafe last week. lt works superb.

772
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,484
为什么需要摄影器材？
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?

773
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,397
因为亲爱的马瑟...
Because Marcel, my sweet...

774
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:00,327
...我们要拍一部影片
...we're going to make a film.

775
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,097
只放给纳粹看
Just for the Nazis.

01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:39,135
艾奇希考斯中尉报到
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.

780
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:42,040
我是艾德芬纳奇将军，稍息
General Ed Fenech. At ease, Hicox.

781
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,574
来杯酒？
Drink?

782
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:50,047
如果是威士忌加水就来一杯
lf you offer me a scotch and plain water,
l could drink a scotch and plain water.

783
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:53,714
好样的，自己去调一杯
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?

784
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,757
酒吧在地球仪里面
The bar is in the globe.

785
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:02,221
您要来点什么吗？
Something for yourself, sir?

786
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:05,461
威士忌，什么都不加
Whiskey. Straight. No Junk in it.

787
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,671
根据档案，你的德语流利
lt says here that you speak German fluently.

788
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:11,740
我说得可溜的呢
Like a KatzenJammer Kid.

789
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:15,675
-你在战前的职业？
-我是个影评人
-And your occupation before the war?
-l'm a film critic.

790
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:20,238
-说说你有哪些作品
-这么说吧
-List your accomplishments.
-Well, sir, such as they are,

791
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:24,844
我替《电影与电影人》杂志
写过文章和影评
l write reviews and articles for
a publication called FilmS and FilmmakerS,

792
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:27,354
我也出版过两本书
and l've had two books published.

793
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:31,286
不错
别谦虚，书名是什么？
lmpressive. Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?

794
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,418
第一本是
The first book was called

795
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:36,932

01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:40,867
第二本是《24格达文西》
And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.

797
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:46,272
针对德国导演帕布斯特作品
潜文本的影评研究
lt's a sub textual film criticism study
of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.

798
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,711
-我们要敬什么？
-敬...
-What should we drink to, sir?
-Well...

799
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,348
-希特勒沉沦
-沉沦到地狱
-Down with Hitler.
-All the way down, sir.

800
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,208
没错
Yes.

801
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:03,785
你熟悉第三帝国的德国片吗？
Are you familiar with German cinema
under the Third Reich?

802
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:09,893
熟，我没看过这三年来的作品
Yes. Obviously, l haven't seen any
of the films made in the last three years,

803
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:13,298
-不过我很熟悉
-解释给我听
-but l'm familiar with it.
-Explain it to me.

804
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,095
什么？
Pardon, sir?

805
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:19,508
这项小任务需要
第三帝国德国电影工业的知识
Well, this little escapade of ours requires
a knowledge of the German film industry

806
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:24,646
解释给我听
戈培尔掌管的UFA电影公司
under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.

807
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,216
戈培尔认为他制作的电影
Goebbels considers the films he's making

808
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,515
将是德国电影的新纪元
to be the beginning of a new era
in German cinema.

809
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,650
而不是他认为20年代
An alternative to what he considers

810
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,693
犹太裔德国知识分子的电影
the Jewish-German intellectual cinema
of the '20s,

811
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,089
以及被犹太人掌控的好莱坞
and the Jewish-controlled dogma
of Hollywood.

812
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:43,097
他做得怎样？
How's he doing?

813
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,857
抱歉，请再问一遍
Frightfully sorry, sir. Once again?

814
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:50,897
你说他想取代犹太人的电影
You say he wants to take on the Jews
at their own game.

815
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:54,899
尤其想和路易斯梅耶较劲
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,

816
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:59,373
-他做得怎样？
-非常好
-how's he doing?
-Quite well, actually.

817
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:06,154
戈培尔掌管之后的8年来
德国电影的观众持续增加
Since Goebbels has taken over,
film attendance has steadily risen
in Germany over the last eight years.

818
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:09,680
但戈培尔不把梅耶当成对手
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be
Goebbels' proper opposite number.

819
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:13,559
他自认比较像大卫塞兹尼克
l believe Goebbels sees himself
closer to David O. Selznick.

820
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,628
跟他说吧
Brief him.

821
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:24,730
希考斯中尉
我现在要说明电影院行动
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time
l'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.

822
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:26,467
三天后
Three days from now

823
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:30,876
约瑟夫戈培尔
将在巴黎举办一场电影首映会
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.

824
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:34,814
-哪一部电影？
-《祖国的荣耀》
-What film, sir?
-The motion picture is called Nation'S Pride.

825
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:39,152
这场欢乐的德国电影首映会
ln attendance
at this Joyous Germatic occasion

826
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:43,658

以及高层领导人都会出席
will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann,
and most of the German High Command

827
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:47,490
包括党卫军
以及盖世太保的高阶军官
including all high ranking officers
of both the SS and the Gestapo,

828
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:50,997
还有纳粹电影宣传部的明星
as well as luminaries
of the Nazi propaganda film industry.

829
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,159
纳粹菁英齐聚一堂？
The master race at play?

830
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:57,433
基本上，混蛋都聚在一起
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs
in one basket.

831
01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:00,066
电影院行动的目的
The obJective of Operation Kino,

832
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:02,843
就是炸死他们
blow up the basket.

833
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:07,609
他们会像去年的残雪
从地球上蒸发消失
And like the snows of yesteryear,
gone from this earth.

834
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:10,144
太好了
Jolly good, sir.

835
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:14,445
一组美国特工部队渗入敌区
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines

836
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,081
他们会协助你们
will be your assist.

837
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:20,026
德国人称他们为
“恶棍特工”
The Germans call them the Basterds.

838
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,793
恶棍特工，没听过
The Basterds. Never heard of them.

839
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:26,799
那是最高机密，你当然没听过
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy,
you not hearing of them.

840
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:30,862
不过德国士兵都听过他们
这群美国佬被视为恶魔
But the Jerries have heard of them, because
these Yanks have been them the devil.

841
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:35,672
你要空降到法国
距离巴黎24公里
You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.

842
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,837
恶棍特工会等着你
The Basterds will be waiting for you.

843
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,279
你要先到一个叫内汀的小村庄
First thing, you'll go to a little village
called Nadine.

844
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:41,748
内汀
ln Nadine,

845
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:44,615
那里有一家路易斯安酒馆
there's a tavern called La Louisiane.

846
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:47,850
你要跟我们的双面间谍碰面
她会替你搞定一切
There you'll rendezvous with
our double agent. She'll take it from there.

847
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,050
她会带你潜入首映会
She's the one who is going to get you
into the premiere.

848
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,890
到时候会有你、她
和两名德国出生的恶棍特工
lt'll be you, her, and two German-born
members of the Basterds.

849
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:57,363
她也会安排你需要的一切
She's also made all the other arrangements
you're going to need.

850
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,428
我该怎么认出她？
How will l know her?

851
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:02,699
这对你不会是个问题
l suspect
that won't be too much trouble for you.

852
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:08,299
-她是布莉姬范海慕丝玛克
-布莉姬范海慕丝玛克？
-Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
-Bridget von Hammersmark?

853
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:12,538
德国电影明星是英国的间谍？
(CHUCKLlNG) The German movie star
is working for England?

854
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,208
对，这两年来都是
Yes, for the last two years now.

855
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,844
电影院行动是她的心血结晶
One could even say that Operation Kino
was her brainchild.

856
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,219
-原来如此
-t了吗？
-lndeed.
-Got the gist?

857
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,019
t了，巴黎愈夜愈美丽
l think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.

858
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:28,094
内汀村
The village of
Nadine

859
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:31,689
你没说会合点是地下室
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous
is in a fucking basement.

860
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:34,600
-我也不知道
-你说是在酒馆
-l didn't know.
-You said it was in a tavern.

861
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,331
-这是酒馆呀
-酒馆的地下室
-lt is a tavern.
-Yeah, in a basement.

862
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,874
在地下室战斗困难重重
You know, fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.

863
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:44,242
第一，你要在地下室战斗
Number one being,
you're fighting in a basement.

864
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,211
要是发现她根本不在呢？
What if we go in there
and she's not even there?

865
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,045
我们就要等
We wait.

866
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:52,411
放心，她是英国间谍
一定会出现的
Don't worry. She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.

867
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:17,401
-史提格，对吧？
-没错
-Stiglitz, right?
-That's right, sir.

868
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:21,205
听说你很会用刀
l hear you're pretty good with that.

869
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:28,081
我们不是来找麻烦的
You know, we're not looking
for trouble right now.

870
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,917
只是和联络人碰面
应该不会有事
Simply making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful.

871
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:38,597
不过要是我错了
事情出了差错
However, the off chance l'm wrong,
things prove eventful,

872
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,770
我希望大家都能保持冷静
l need to know we can all remain calm.

873
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,468
我看起来不冷静吗？
l don't look calm to you?

874
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:56,751
既然你都这么说
我猜你很冷静
Well, now that you put it like that,
l guess you do.

875
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:17,635
你的德裔手下史提格
他不太爱说话，对吧？
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz,
not exactly the loquacious type, is he?

876
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:23,172
你需要的是爱说话的人吗？
ls that the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?

877
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,471
说的好，中尉
Fair point, Lieutenant.

878
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,548
要是出状况，该怎么做？
So you all get in trouble in there,
what are we supposed to do?

879
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:34,816
打赌能不能全身而退？
Make bets on how it all comes out?

880
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:39,188
如果出状况，我们都能处理
lf we get into trouble, we can handle it.

881
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:43,664
要是真的出状况，你得确保
But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure

882
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:47,862
不管是德国佬或法国佬
全都不能逃出去
no Germans, or French, for that matter,
escape from that basement.

883
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:53,035
要是范海慕丝玛克的身分曝光
整项行动就会泡汤
lf Frau von Hammersmark's cover
is compromised, the mission is kaput.

884
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:59,075
提到范海慕丝玛克小姐
是谁挑在这死亡陷阱碰面？
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose
idea was it for the death-trap rendezvous?

885
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:03,212
-是她挑的
-那敢情好
-She chose the spot.
-lsn't that Just dandy?

886
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,221
她不是战略专家，只是个演员
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's Just an actress.

887
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:11,490
白痴都知道不能在地下室战斗
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to
know you don't want to fight in a basement.

888
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,585
她不是挑战斗的地点
She wasn't picking a place to fight.

889
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:16,494
而是没有德国佬的秘密地点
She was picking a place isolated
and without Germans.

890
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:19,433
...我是男的...
--So, l'm male...

891
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,662
...而且是虚构的文学角色...
...l'm a fictional,
literary character from the past...

892
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:24,702
...我是美国佬，很有争议性
...l'm American, and that's controversial.

893
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,007
一点争议性都没有
No, it's not controversial at all.

894
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:33,007
作者的国籍和角色的国籍无关
The nationality of the author has nothing
to do with the nationality of the character.

895
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,710
角色只是角色
The character is the character.

896
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:38,352
哈姆雷特是丹麦人不是英国人
Hamlet is not British. He is Danish.

897
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:42,186
没错，这角色出生在美国
So yes, this character was born in America.

898
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:43,281
这样嘛
Well then.

899
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:46,519
玛蒂达
Mathilda.

900
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:48,256
松子酒？
松子酒？
Schnapps? Schnapps?

901
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:49,761
松子酒...松子酒...
Schnapps...Schnapps...Schnapps.

902
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:51,430
五杯松子酒
(ORDERlNG lN GERMAN AND FRENCH)
Five schnapps, please.

903
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:55,795
要是我有老婆...
lf l had a wife...

1038
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:12,224
...导演帕布斯特一直拍他的特写
...the director Pabst, gave him a Close-Up.

1039
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:16,502
少校，如果你信得过我...
Herr MaJor, if my word means anything...

1040
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:21,073
...我敢替这位上尉的话担保
...l can vouch for everything
the young captain has Just said.

1041
01:21:22,577 --> 01:21:25,068
他的确来自帕鲁峰山脚
He does hail from the bottom
of the Piz Palu.

1042
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:30,276
他也真的拍过戏
而且他弟弟比他帅多了
He was in the film and his brother
is far more handsome than he.

1043
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:42,286
你应该回去找朋友
You should reJoin your friends.

1044
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:47,525
我能加入你们吗？
May l Join you?

1045
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:48,694
请便
By all means.

1046
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:50,862
太好了
Wunderbar!

1047
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:01,774
原来你的怪口音是这么来的
So that's the source of your bizarre accent.

1048
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:04,309
真没想到
That's extraordinary.

1049
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,044
你来这里干嘛？
What are you doing here?

1050
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:09,446
除了和美丽的小姐喝酒以外？
Aside from having a drink
with the lovely fraulein?

1051
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:13,052
这我就不必替你解释
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.

1052
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,490
我是说来这国家
l mean in country.

1053
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:19,896
你若驻守法国，我肯定认识你
You're obviously not stationed in
France or l'd know who you are.

1054
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:22,466
你认识法国的每个德国人？
You know every German in France?

1055
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:24,363
当然了
Worth knowing.

1056
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:32,374
这就是问题所在
Well, there lies the problem.

1057
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:34,671
我们不敢说自己认识每个人
We never claimed to be worth knowing.

1058
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:37,578
你到底来法国干嘛？
All levity aside,
what are you doing in France?

1059
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:42,256
陪范小姐参加戈培尔首映会
Attending Minister Goebbels' film
premiere as the fraulein's escort.

1060
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:47,054
你是范小姐的男伴？
You are the Fraulein Hammersmark's
escort.

1061
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:51,062
总得有人替她拿打火机吧
Someone has to carry her lighter.

1062
01:22:57,005 --> 01:23:00,372
上尉是我的男伴
其他的人是我的贵宝
The captain is my date,
but all three are my guests.

1063
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:02,607
我们是老朋友...
We are old friends...

1064
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:04,709
...交情很久
...who go back a long time.

1065
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:10,446
比我这女明星想承认的久很多
Actually, longer than an actress
would care to admit.

1066
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:14,946
既然如此...
Well, in that case...

1067
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:18,455
...让我向三位幸运儿举杯敬酒
...let me raise my glass to the
three luckiest men in the room.

1068
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:20,553
我也喝了
l'll drink to that.

1071
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:37,803
我得说...
l must say...

1072
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:40,476
...他们在玩的游戏好像很好玩
...that game they're playing
looks like a good bit of fun.

1073
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:43,540
你说的对，我没跟着玩
l didn't Join them
because you're quite right, Captain.

1074
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:46,380
因为军官不该和士兵称兄道弟
An officer should not fraternize
with enlisted men.

1075
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:49,684
不过呢...
But...

1076
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:51,248
...既然我们都是军官
...seeing as we are all officers...

1077
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:54,486
...加上是大明星的好朋友
...and sophisticated lady friends of officers.

1078
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:56,087
咱们一起玩这游戏，如何？
What say we play the game?

1079
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:58,725
好啊，玩一场吧
Yes, great, one game.

1080

太好了
Wunderbar.

1081
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:03,562
大兵们...
Soldiers...

1082
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:05,231

谢谢你们

...write the name of a famous
person on your card.

1087
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:20,016
真人或虚构角色都行
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter.

1088
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:22,950
比如说可以写孔夫子或是傅满洲
For instance, you could write,
Confucius or Doctor Fu Manchu.

1089
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:24,419
艾瑞克！笔拿来！
Eric! More pens.

1090
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:26,587
一定要是名人，不能写你阿姨
And they must be famous, not aunt Frida.

1091
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:29,594
写完了就把卡片盖在桌上
When you finish writing,
put the card face down on the table.

1092
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:32,031
然后就给你右手边的人
And move it to the person on your right-

1093

...谢了

01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:35,460
你左手边的人会把卡片给你
-the person to your left
moves his card to you.

1095
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:37,861
你拿起卡片时不能看...
You pick up the card without looking at it...

1096
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:39,334
...然后舔一下背面...
...lick the back...

1097
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:43,167
...帖在你的额头
...and stick it on your forehead.

1098
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:58,584
写吧！
Write!

1099
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,684

我是德国人吗？

我是美国人吗？
Am l American?

不过他不是在美国出生
Obviously, he wasn't born in America.

1111
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:39,030
所以...我去过美国罗？
So...l visited America, aye?

1112
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:40,326
对
Yes.

我去美国是好事吗？
Was this visit fortuitous?

1114
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:45,563
对你来说不是
Not for you.

1115
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:51,705
我的故乡是不是有异国情调？
My native land,
is it what one would call, exotic?

1116
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:52,837
是
(VON HAMMERSMARK AND HlCOX
SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
-Yes.
-Yes.

1117
01:25:56,050 --> 01:26:00,919
那么说，不是丛林就是东方？
That could be either a reference
to the Jungle or the Orient.

1118
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:05,386
我要凭第一直觉问你们
我来自丛林吗？
l'm going to let my first instinct take over
and ask. Am l from the Jungle?

1119
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,822
对
-Yes.
-Yes.

1120
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:10,126
这时就能问是真人或虚构角色
Now gentlemen, around this time you could
ask whether you're real or fictitious.

1121
01:26:10,732 --> 01:26:13,223
我觉得答案太简单所以不问
l, however, think that's too easy,
so l won't ask that yet.

1122
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:14,926

是
-Yes.
-Yes.

对

Frau von Hammersmark.

1173
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:37,695
谢谢
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Thank you.

1174
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:42,637
第三帝国万岁！
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
A thousand year German Reich!

1175
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,534
第三帝国万岁！
-A thousand year Reich!
-A thousand year Reich!

1176
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:56,489
我跟你勾心斗角斗累了
l must say l grow weary
of these monkeyshines.

1177
01:29:59,927 --> 01:30:00,985
你听到吗？
Did you hear that?

1178
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:04,894
那是我的手枪
That was the sound of my Walther.

1179
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,363
指着你的鸟蛋的声音
Pointed right at your testicles.

1180
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:13,373
你干嘛拿手枪指着我的鸟蛋？
Why do you have your Walther pointed
at my testicles?

1181
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:17,709
因为你泄了底了，上尉
Because you've Just
given yourself away, Captain.

1182
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:20,939
你跟威士忌一样不是来自德国
You're no more German than that scotch.

1183
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,483
-少校
-闭嘴，婊子
(BOTH SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
-Well, MaJor.
-Shut up slut.

1184
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:35,494
你想说什么？
You were saying?

1185
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:42,692
看来这是两人对峙
l was saying that makes two of us.

1186
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:47,099
你一坐下我就拿枪指着你鸟蛋
l've had a gun pointed at your
balls since you sat down.

1187
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:51,035
这是三人对峙
That makes three of us.

1188
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:54,912
这么近，连我都是神枪手
And at this range, l'm a real Fredrick Zoller.

1189
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:59,150
看来情况有点不太妙
Looks like we have
a bit of a sticky situation here.

1190
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:03,318
少校，你要做的是...
What's going to happen, MaJor...

1191
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:07,121
...乖乖站起来陪我们走出大门
...you're going to stand up
and walk out that door with us.

1192
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:09,663
不...不...想都别想
--No, no, no, no, no, no.
l don't think so.

1193
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:11,421
你和我...
l'm afraid you and l...

1194
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:13,433
...都知道...
...we both know, Captain...

1195
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:17,133
...不管别人怎么样...
...no matter what happens to anybody else
in this room...

1196
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:20,098
...咱们俩哪儿都不能去
...the two of us aren't going anywhere.

1197
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:27,640
真可惜
威汉上士和他朋友要被拖下水
Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm
and his famous friends.

1198
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:32,112
你们想活命，就得毙了他们
lf any of you expect to live,
you'll have to shoot them too.

1199
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:36,715
看来小麦斯从小就会是孤儿
Looks like little Max will grow up an orphan.

1200
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:39,652
真可怜
How sad.

1201
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,064
如果是这样
Well, if this is it, old boy,

1202
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:51,661
希望你不介意我说英文
l hope you don't mind if l go out
speaking the King's.

1203
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:54,707
请说吧，上尉
By all means, Captain.

1204
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:04,376
地狱有一层
专门关浪费顶极威士忌的人
There's a special rung in hell reserved
for people who waste good Scotch.

1205
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,653
既然我可能就快要没命
Seeing as l may be rapping
on the door momentarily,

1206
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:17,323
我得说
真他妈的好喝
l must say, damn good stuff, sir.

1207
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:23,502
至于我们陷入的
Now, about this pickle

1208
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:26,836
这个状况
we find ourselves in.

1209
01:32:29,243 --> 01:32:32,337
看来你只能做一件事
lt would appear there's only
one thing left for you to do.

1210
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:34,347
什么事？
And what would that be?

1211
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:37,712
-史提格
-向你的纳粹鸟蛋说掰掰吧
-Stiglitz.
-Say auf wiederSehen to your Nazi balls.

1212
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,485
外面的人，你是什么人？
You outside. Who are you?

1213
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,559
英国人？美国人？
British? American?

1214
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:20,687
什么？
What?

1215
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:22,691
我们是美国人
ALDO: We're American.

1216
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:24,390
你呢？
What are you?

1217
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:26,556
德国人呀，猪头
l'm a German, you idiot.

1218
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:29,563
你的英文倒是说得不错
ALDO: Speak English
pretty good for a German.

1219
01:33:29,637 --> 01:33:31,264
我同意
l agree.

1220
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:34,039
所以来谈谈吧
So let's talk.

1221
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:36,103
好，谈吧
ALDO: Okay, talk.

1222
01:33:36,477 --> 01:33:38,240
我当了爸爸
l'm a father.

1223
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:42,115
我的宝宝今天在法兰克福出生
My baby was born today. ln Frankfurt.

1224
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:44,380
五个钟头前
Five hours ago.

1225
01:33:44,785 --> 01:33:49,017
他叫麦斯
我们来这里喝酒庆祝
His name is Max.
We were in here drinking, celebrating.

1226
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:53,325
他们跑来开枪杀人
不是我的错
They're the ones that came in shooting
and killing. lt's not my fault!

1227
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:55,486
好啦，不是你的错
ALDO: Okay! lt wasn't your fault.

1228
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,729
你叫什么，大兵？
What's your name, soldier?

1229
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:00,357
威汉
Wilhelm.

1230
01:34:00,868 --> 01:34:04,429
我方有没有人还活着？
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?

1231
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:06,530
-没有
-我还活着！
-No.
-l'm alive!

1232
01:34:08,509 --> 01:34:10,204
那是谁？
ALDO: Who's that?

1233
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,841
这女的是你们的人吗？
ls the girl on your side?

1234
01:34:16,217 --> 01:34:17,479
哪个女的？
ALDO: Which girl?

1235
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:19,985
你说呢？范海慕丝玛克呀！
Who do you think? Von Hammersmark.

1236
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:23,523
对，她是我们的人
ALDO: Yeah, she's ours.

1237
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:25,788
她没事吧？
ALDO: ls she okay?

1238
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:29,922
威汉！
ALDO: Wilhelm!

1239
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:32,293
她中了枪
She's been shot.

1240
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,100
不过她还活着
But she's alive.

1241
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:40,469
好吧，威汉
ALDO: Okay, Wilhelm.

1242
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:43,608
咱们谈个条件如何？
What do you say we make us a deal?

1243
01:34:44,945 --> 01:34:46,378
你叫什么？
What's your name?

1244
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:48,005
艾多
Aldo.

1245
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,611
威汉，这是我的条件
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.

1246
01:34:50,918 --> 01:34:54,547
让我和我的手下把那女的带走
You let me and one of my men
come down there and take the girl away.

1247
01:34:54,622 --> 01:34:57,182
我不拿枪，你不拿枪
No guns. No guns me, no guns you.

1248
01:34:57,258 --> 01:35:00,785
我们把那女的带了就走
就这么简单，威汉
And we take the girl and leave.
lt's that simple, Willi.

1249
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:03,619
你走你的，我们走我们的
You go your way, we go ours.

1250
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:06,598
小威汉就能长大陪他老爸打球
And little Max gets to grow up
playing catch with his daddy.

1251
01:35:07,768 --> 01:35:10,635
怎么样？这条件谈成了吗？
So what do you say, Willi? We got us a deal?

1252
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:16,634
艾多
Aldo.

1253
01:35:17,445 --> 01:35:19,413
我在这里，小威
ALDO: l'm here, Willi.

1254
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:22,479
我很想信任你
l want to trust you.

1255
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,177
可是...
But...

1256
01:35:24,618 --> 01:35:26,586
我怎么能信任你？
But how can l?

1257
01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:30,313
你有什么选择？
ALDO: What choice you got, son?

1258
01:35:36,163 --> 01:35:38,222
好吧，好吧
Okay, okay.

1259
01:35:39,834 --> 01:35:41,392
艾多
Aldo,

1260
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:43,866
我要信任你
l'm going to trust you.

1261
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:46,299
下来吧
Come down.

1262
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:04,581
喂，干嘛拿出机关枪？
我以为谈好条件了
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
l thought we had us a deal?

1263
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:06,922
是啊，带着那女的就走
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.

1264
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:08,552
先别急
Not so fast.

1265
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:11,189
只有一个条件，非得互相信任
We only got a deal, we trust each other.

1266
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:13,323
火线对峙不算是信任
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.

1267
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:15,992
你得拿枪对着我才算火线对峙
You need guns on me
for it to be a Mexican standoff.

1268
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:19,798
你拿枪对着我们
决定开火，我们就死定了
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot, we're dead.

1269
01:36:19,874 --> 01:36:23,173
不过他们在上面有手榴弹
只要丢下来，你就死定了
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here, you're dead.

1270
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:25,643
这算火线对峙，这不是条件
That's a Mexican standoff,
and that was not the deal.

1271
01:36:25,713 --> 01:36:27,738
没有信任就没有条件
No trust, no deal.

1272
01:36:43,297 --> 01:36:45,060
好吧，艾多
All right, Aldo.

1273
01:36:46,534 --> 01:36:48,092
好吧
Fine.

1274
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:54,474
把卖国贼带走，别让我看到她
Just take that fucking traitor,
and get her out of my sight.

1275
01:37:06,554 --> 01:37:09,990
先别急，医生
叫他去跟他的狗玩
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go play with his dogs.

1276
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:26,071
我们替你取出子弹前
你得先回答问题
Before we yank that slug out you,
you need to answer a few questions.

1277
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:27,936
什么问题？
Few questions about what?

1278
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:30,637
我们怎么会死了三个人？
About l got three men dead back there.

1279
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:33,509
告诉我们到底发生什么事
Why don't you try telling us
what the fuck happened?

1280
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:37,517
英国佬露了馅
被盖世太保的少校看到
The British officer blew his German act
and the Gestapo maJor saw it.

1281
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:40,849
在你从头开始解释之前
Before we get into who shot John,

1282
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:45,853
想问你为什么叫我们
在全是纳粹的地下室碰面？
why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous
in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?

1283
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:53,199
你没看见发生什么事
l can see since you didn't see
what happened inside,

1284
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:55,929
一定觉得有纳粹在很奇怪
that the Nazis being there must look odd.

1285
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:58,527
没错，有个词儿能形容
Yeah, we got a word
for that kind of odd in English.

1286
01:37:58,606 --> 01:38:00,597
那就是很可疑
lt's called suspicious.

1287
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:06,710
大家都得冷静下来
Everybody needs to calm down.

1288
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:09,442
千万别胡思乱想
You're letting your imagination
get the better of you.

1289
01:38:10,818 --> 01:38:13,787
你也见过威汉上士
You met the sergeant yourself. Willi.

1290
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,719
记得他吧？
You remember him, don't you?

1291
01:38:15,789 --> 01:38:16,847
当然了
Yeah, l remember him.

1292
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:20,621
他老婆今晚刚生小孩，他才...
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had Just become a...

1293
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:22,423
他才当了爸爸
He had Just become a father!

1294
01:38:22,496 --> 01:38:26,330
他的上司放他假和朋友庆祝
His commanding officer gave him
and his mates the night off to celebrate.

1295
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:35,972
那里会有德国人
不是我设的陷阱就是纯属巧合
The Germans being there was either
a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.

1296
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:38,044
不可能两者皆是
lt couldn't be both.

1297
01:38:48,022 --> 01:38:49,922
他们怎么会开始开枪？
How'd the shooting start?

1298
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:52,481
英国佬露了馅
The Englishman gave himself away.

1299
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:54,288
怎么会？
How'd he do that?

1300
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:57,659
他点了三杯酒
He ordered three glasses.

1301
01:38:58,866 --> 01:39:00,766
我们点三杯酒
We order three glasses.

1302
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:02,936
那是德国人比的三
That's the German three.

1303
01:39:03,837 --> 01:39:05,998
他比的三看起来就可疑
The other looks odd.

1304
01:39:06,206 --> 01:39:08,538
德国佬注意到了
Germans would and did notice it.

1305
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:19,278
假设那里没有德国佬
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans

1306
01:39:19,353 --> 01:39:21,947
一切都照计划进行
and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to.

1307
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:23,956
下一步是什么？
What was the next step?

1308
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:25,785
燕尾服
Tuxedos.

1309
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,824
首映会到处都是高阶军官
To get them into the premiere
wearing military uniforms

1310
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:31,694
他们穿军服去等于自杀
with all the military there
would've been suicide.

1311
01:39:33,667 --> 01:39:36,966
他们要冒充德国电影圈人士
But going as members
of the German film industry,

1312
01:39:37,371 --> 01:39:40,534
穿着燕尾服融入人群
they wear tuxedos
and fit in with everybody else.

1313
01:39:42,009 --> 01:39:45,206
我请人熬夜赶做三套燕尾服
l arranged for the tailor
to fit three tuxedos tonight.

1314
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:48,847
他们要怎么潜入首映会？
How'd you intend to get them
in that premiere?

1315
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:50,884
把我的皮包给我
Hand me my purse.

1316
01:40:00,427 --> 01:40:02,827
希考斯中尉本来是我的男伴
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.

1317
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:08,157
另外两个扮德国摄影师和助理
The other two were going
as a German cameraman and his assistant.

1318
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:10,997
你还是能帮我们潜进去？
You still get us in that premiere?

1319
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:14,199
你的德语比你朋友更溜吗？
没有
You speak German
better than your friends? No.

1320
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,836
我有没有中弹？有！
Have l been shot? Yes!

1321
01:40:17,378 --> 01:40:22,213
所以我有一阵子不能走红地毯
l don't see me tripping the light fantaStique
up a red carpet anytime soon.

1322
01:40:23,217 --> 01:40:25,685
更别说是明晚了
Least of all, by tomorrow night.

1323
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:41,865
但是，有件事你不知道
However, there's something you don't know.

1324
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:48,033
电影院行动有两项最新发展
There've been two recent developments
regarding Operation Kino.

1325
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:54,873
第一，场地从丽池大戏院
换到小很多的电影院
One, the venue has been changed
from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.

1326
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:58,613
德国人不太会临时改变计划
Enormous change at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.

1327
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:01,654
戈培尔怎么会做这种怪事？
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff
so damn peculiar?

1328
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:05,452
可能和第二项事有关
lt probably has something to do
with the second development.

1329
01:41:05,826 --> 01:41:07,521
什么事？
Which is?

1330
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:13,992
希特勒要参加首映会
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.

1331
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:15,996
关于你在巴黎...
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
l've been rethinking my position...

1332
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:24,337
...举行《祖国的荣耀》首映会
我一直在重新考虑我的立场
...in regards to your Paris premiere
of ''Nation's Pride.''

1333
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:27,744
一周一周过去...
As the weeks have gone on...

1334
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,244
...美国佬又抢上滩头...
...and the Americans are on the beach...

1335
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:35,244
...我对佐勒二等兵的英勇事迹...
...l do find myself thinking more and more...

1336
01:41:36,023 --> 01:41:37,354
...又考虑得更多
...about this Private Zoller.

1337
01:41:38,692 --> 01:41:40,819
这小子对国家奉献良多
This boy has done something tremendous
for us.

1338
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:43,856
于是我开始想...
And l'm beginning to think...

1339
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:48,091
...我参加首映会可能意义重大
...my participation in this event
could be meaningful.

1340
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:50,361
我靠！
Fuck a duck!

1341
01:41:59,012 --> 01:42:00,877
你在想什么？
What are you thinking?

1342
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:04,344
我在想有机会刺杀希特勒
l'm thinking getting a whack
at planting old Uncle Adolf

1343
01:42:04,418 --> 01:42:06,318
改变了整个计划
makes this horse a different color.

1344
01:42:06,386 --> 01:42:08,047
所以呢？
What is that supposed to mean?

1345
01:42:08,155 --> 01:42:10,089
你一定要把我们弄进去
lt means you getting us in that premiere.

1346
01:42:10,157 --> 01:42:13,058
我大概会失去这条腿
l'm probably going to end up losing this leg.

1347
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:16,060
演艺生涯也没了
Bye-bye, acting career. Fun while it lasted.

1348
01:42:16,163 --> 01:42:19,030
我这样该怎么走红地毯？
How do you expect me
to walk the red carpet?

1349
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:24,227
兽医会把子弹取出来
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug
out your gam.

1350
01:42:24,304 --> 01:42:26,363
替你裹一层石膏
He's going to wrap it up in a cast,

1351
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:28,567
然后你就瞎编说是登山摔断腿
and you got a good
how-l-broke-my-leg-mountain-climbing story.

1352
01:42:28,642 --> 01:42:31,304
德国人不是都很喜欢登山吗？
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing mountains, don't you?

1353
01:42:31,411 --> 01:42:34,642
我不喜欢
我喜欢抽烟喝酒，到餐厅吃饭
l don't. l like smoking, drinking
and ordering in restaurants.

1354
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:36,749
不过我明白你的意思
But l see your point.

1355
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:40,309
我们会替你注射一大桶吗啡
We fill you up with morphine
till it's coming out your ears

1356
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:43,651
你就一拐一拐地走红地毯
and Just limp your little ass
up that rouge carpet.

1357
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:48,458
我知道这是个蠢问题
l know this is a silly question before l ask it,

1358
01:42:48,562 --> 01:42:53,932
不过你们美国佬除了英文
还会哪一国语言？
but can you Americans speak
any other language than English?

1359
01:42:54,768 --> 01:42:56,998
我们都会说一点意大利文
We both speak a little ltalian.

1360
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:59,595
口音一定很重
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.

1361
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:04,799
但是不一定一开始就被戳破
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.

1362
01:43:05,612 --> 01:43:08,445
德国人听不太懂意大利话
Germans don't have a good ear for ltalian.

1363
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:16,153
你们要靠它蒙过去，对吧？
So you mumble ltalian
and brazen through it. ls that the plan?

1364
01:43:16,423 --> 01:43:18,391
差不多就是这样
That's about it.

1365
01:43:21,828 --> 01:43:22,886
听起来不错
That sounds good.

1366
01:43:22,963 --> 01:43:25,363
不错个屁！不然我们要回家？
lt sounds like shit.
What else are we going to do? Go home?

1367
01:43:25,432 --> 01:43:27,400
不，这真的行得通
No, that sounds good.

1368
01:43:28,101 --> 01:43:32,003
你们不凸，我就能带你们进去
lf you don't blow it, with that,
l can get you in the building.

1369
01:43:33,006 --> 01:43:34,064
谁要做什么？
Who does what?

1370
01:43:34,141 --> 01:43:38,305
我的意大利话说得最溜
所以我是你的男伴
Well, l speak the most ltalian,
so l'll be your escort.

1371
01:43:38,412 --> 01:43:41,506
唐尼也不赖，他是摄影师
Donowitz speaks second most,
so he'll be your ltalian cameraman.

1372
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:44,584
欧玛只能当摄影助理
Omar, third most. He'll be Donny's assistant.

1373
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,278
我不会讲意大利话
l don't speak ltalian.

1374
01:43:46,353 --> 01:43:49,754
所以罗，你就给我乖乖闭嘴
Like l said, third best.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.

1375
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:51,313
你们都给我马上练习
ln fact,
why don't you start practicing right now?

1376
01:43:58,999 --> 01:44:00,864
你升官了嘛
You've moved up in the world.

1377
01:44:03,036 --> 01:44:05,027
看看你，升中尉了
Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.

1378
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:10,333
你还有多次以下弑上的记录
这真是不容易
And with your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.

1379
01:44:15,849 --> 01:44:16,907
那个家伙叫...
And that one's name is...

1380
01:44:16,984 --> 01:44:18,747
...威汉魏奇
...Wilhelm Wicki.

1381
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:21,720
这个奥地利出生的犹太佬...
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who
immigrated to the United States...

1382
01:44:21,955 --> 01:44:24,856
...知道情势不妙就移民到美国
...when things began turning sour
for the lsraelites.

1383
01:44:24,992 --> 01:44:27,722
他们都是德国出生的恶棍特工
They are the two German-born
members of the Basterds.

1384
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:32,196
为了突袭德军穿上德军制服
They've been known to don German
uniforms, to ambush squads.

1385
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:34,628
你们为什么大老远跑来？
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
What brings you all the way out here?

1386
01:44:40,874 --> 01:44:42,398
这不像他们的作风
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
But that doesn't look like this.

1387
01:44:45,746 --> 01:44:46,804
事有蹊跷
This is odd.

1388
01:45:03,063 --> 01:45:04,325
有一个人不见了
lt would appear somebody's missing.

1389
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:06,597
一位很时髦的女士
Somebody fashionable.

1390
01:45:08,402 --> 01:45:09,426
大家出去！
Everybody out!

1391
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:26,116

01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:20,229
记得...要说英文
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Remember...in English.

1397
01:47:20,767 --> 01:47:22,257
好
Yes.

1398
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:23,694
开麦拉
Action.

1399
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:25,264
要找谁帮忙冲印呢？
But how do we get it developed?

1400
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:29,100
不要命的白痴才会答应
Only a suicidal idiot like us
would develop that footage.

1401
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:31,934
就算有人愿意冲印...
And suppose someone would develop
the footage...

1402
01:47:32,112 --> 01:47:34,239
...也不会是有音轨的35厘米拷贝
...how do we get a 35mm
print with a soundtrack?

1403
01:47:34,581 --> 01:47:38,073
我们要找到能冲印成
有音轨的35厘米拷贝的人
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
We find somebody who can develop
and process a 35mm print with a soundtrack.

1404
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:40,514
然后逼他们帮忙...
And we make them do it...

1405
01:47:40,587 --> 01:47:41,679
...要不然就杀了他们
...or we kill them.

1406
01:47:45,559 --> 01:47:47,424
把他带过来，把头压在桌上
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.

1407
01:47:48,895 --> 01:47:49,987
你不乖乖听我们的话...
You either do what the fuck we tell you...

1408
01:47:50,063 --> 01:47:52,031
...我就用斧头砍断你脑袋
...or l'll bury this ax
in your collaborating skull.

1409
01:47:52,098 --> 01:47:53,156
我不是卖国贼
(MAN SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
l'm not a collaborator.

1410
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:55,463
马瑟，他老婆小孩认识你吗？
Marcel, do his wife and children know you?

1411
01:47:55,535 --> 01:47:56,559
认识
Yes.

1412
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:59,070
我们杀死这只德国狗以后...
Then after we kill this dog
for the Germans...

1413
01:47:59,272 --> 01:48:01,001
...再去杀光他全家
...we'll go and silence them.

(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Jannings, come on, show the ring.

1416
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:44,171
快呀，这就对了
Come on, come on. There you go!

1417
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:49,147
弗德列克，你看
这代表最高的艺术成就
Fredrick, have a look at it. This is
the highest artistic honor that l give.

1418
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:52,343
-我感到非常荣幸
-这是你应得的
-Herr Doctor, l'm also feeling very honored.
-You deserve it, my dear Jannings!

1419
01:49:52,552 --> 01:49:55,851
不过今晚的首映会后
将有一名全新候选人
But l believe after the premiere today,
we have a new candidate.

1420
01:50:17,077 --> 01:50:18,169
艾曼纽...

谢谢你，赫曼

(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Fraulein von Hammersmark.

1427
01:51:14,968 --> 01:51:16,595
蓝达上校，好久不见
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Colonel Landa, it's been years.

1428
01:51:17,604 --> 01:51:19,572
你还是一样帅气
Dashing as ever, l see.

1429
01:51:22,275 --> 01:51:24,505
你的腿怎么了？
So what's happened to your lovely leg?

1430
01:51:25,278 --> 01:51:29,738
一定是为拍德国电影而挂彩
A by-product of kicking ass in
the German cinema, no doubt.

1431
01:51:30,417 --> 01:51:32,476
少来这一套，老狐狸
Save your flattery, you old dog.

1432
01:51:32,952 --> 01:51:37,582
我太了解你
才不信你的甜言蜜语
l know too many of your former conquests
to fall into that honey pot.

1433
01:51:37,857 --> 01:51:39,154
说真的，到底是怎么了？
Seriously, what happened?

1434
01:51:40,326 --> 01:51:43,762
我竟然会傻到想要试试看...
Well, l tried my hand,
foolishly l might add...

1435
01:51:45,165 --> 01:51:46,632
...登山的滋味
...at mountain climbing.

1436
01:51:47,867 --> 01:51:49,027
结果就摔断了腿
And this is the result.

1437
01:51:49,269 --> 01:51:50,293
登山？
Mountain climbing?

1438
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:52,497
你因为登山摔断腿？
That's how you inJured your leg
-mountain climbing?

1439
01:51:52,605 --> 01:51:54,197
信不信由你，是真的
Believe it or not, yes it is.

1440
01:52:18,031 --> 01:52:21,489
原谅我，我不是故意笑你
Forgive me, fraulein. l don't mean to
laugh at your misfortune.

1441
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:23,331
只是...你会去登山？
lt's Just --- mountain climbing?

1442
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:29,704
我很好奇
你怎么会想去做这种蠢事？
l'm curious, fraulein,
what could have ever compelled
you to undertake
such a foolhardy endeavor?

1443
01:52:32,679 --> 01:52:34,909
相信我，我不会再去了
Well, l shan't be doing it again,
l can tell you that.

1444
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:38,750
石膏看来像是才刚敷上去
That cast looks as fresh
as my old Uncle Gustav.

1445
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:41,979
你是昨晚去登山吗？
When were you climbing this mountain,
last night?

1446
01:52:43,523 --> 01:52:44,854
你的眼光真锐利

你是登巴黎的哪座山呀？
And where in Paris is this mountain?

1449
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:56,235
我只是在逗你
No, l'm Just teasing you, fraulein.

1450
01:52:56,436 --> 01:52:59,166
你也知道，我最爱逗人了
You know me, l tease rough.

1451
01:52:59,405 --> 01:53:00,929
这三位帅哥是谁呀？
So, who are your three
handsome escorts?

1452
01:53:03,409 --> 01:53:06,378
他们连一句德文都不会说
l'm afraid neither three speak
a word of German.

1453
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:08,843
他们是我意大利的朋友
They're friends of mine from ltaly.

1454

1510
01:57:38,518 --> 01:57:39,678
来杯香槟...

...向《祖国的荣耀》致敬

Let me see your foot.

1520

把你的脚放在我大腿上
Put your foot in my lap.

1522
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,817
汉斯，你让我很害羞

1523
01:59:22,121 --> 01:59:26,956
请你伸进我大衣的右口袋...

让我来
May l?

1526
02:00:23,983 --> 02:00:28,215
美国人是怎么说来着？
“鞋子合脚，你就得穿上”
What's that American expression?
''lf the shoe fits, you must wear it.''

1527
02:00:33,859 --> 02:00:35,383
现在你想怎样？
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
What now, Colonel?

1528
02:01:26,646 --> 02:01:27,977
穿白色晚礼服的家伙
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
The guy in the white smoking Jacket.

1529
02:01:31,751 --> 02:01:36,313

去你的！
ALDO: Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck. Fuck you!

1530
02:01:36,455 --> 02:01:38,446
一群他妈的猪头
Bunch of shithead fuck.

1531
02:01:41,394 --> 02:01:43,294
你也去死吧！
Fuck you, too!

1532
02:01:45,564 --> 02:01:49,660
该死的臭纳粹，狗娘养的

Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.

1533
02:01:50,169 --> 02:01:53,661

You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
God damn you! Get off!

1534
02:02:00,413 --> 02:02:01,675
聪明
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Clever.

1535
02:02:03,916 --> 02:02:06,612
我告诉元首观众已经入席
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
l informed the Fuhrer that the
audience has taken their seats.

1536
02:02:06,786 --> 02:02:08,117
他应该随时就会到
He should arrive any minute.

1537
02:02:09,455 --> 02:02:10,479
谢谢你，汉斯

1538
02:02:12,258 --> 02:02:13,589
你们这些臭德国佬...

Limburg-smelling...
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)

1539
02:02:13,659 --> 02:02:14,683
放开他
Let go.

1540
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:22,324
就像电影台词一样
我猜你就是艾多雷恩中尉吧？
As Stanley said to Livingstone,
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, l presume?

1541
02:02:23,302 --> 02:02:24,997
汉斯蓝达
Hans Landa.

1542
02:02:26,839 --> 02:02:29,205
你风光了好一阵子，艾多
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.

1543
02:02:30,142 --> 02:02:32,975
最后还是落到党卫军的手中
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.

1544
02:02:33,045 --> 02:02:34,603
其实是落到我的手中
My hands to be exact.

1545
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:38,377
大家都等了很久想教训你
And they've been waiting a long time
to touch you.

1546
02:02:42,288 --> 02:02:44,188
逮到你退缩了
Caught you flinching.

1547
02:02:48,294 --> 02:02:50,489
看你敢不敢再碰我
ALDO: Touch me again,
Kraut-burger.

1548
02:03:06,345 --> 02:03:08,870
-尤特维奇？
-是你吗，中尉？
ALDO: Utivich?
UTlVlCH: ls that you, Lieutenant?

1549
02:03:08,981 --> 02:03:10,471
是
ALDO: Yeah.

1550
02:03:10,583 --> 02:03:12,710
你知道唐尼怎么了吗？
UTlVlCH: Do you know
what happened to Donny?

1551
02:03:12,818 --> 02:03:14,479
欧玛呢？
Omar?

1552
02:03:14,553 --> 02:03:16,987
-还有那个女的？
-我不知道
-The woman?
-ALDO: No, l do not.

1553
02:04:03,469 --> 02:04:07,030
告诉我，要是换我坐在那里
Tell me, Aldo,
if l were sitting where you're sitting,

1554
02:04:07,106 --> 02:04:09,074
你会饶过我吗？
would you show me mercy?

1555
02:04:13,646 --> 02:04:15,204
不会
Nope.

1556
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:18,713
英文不是有句鞋子和脚的俗语？
What is that English expression
about shoes and feet?

1557
02:04:18,784 --> 02:04:22,276
“左右脚的鞋子穿反了”
我正好也想到这句
''Looks like the shoe is on the other foot.''
Yeah, l was Just thinking that.

1558
02:04:22,488 --> 02:04:23,580
你们下去吧
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
You may leave us.

1559
02:04:25,124 --> 02:04:26,148
不过在外面看守
But stay alert outside.

1560
02:04:35,401 --> 02:04:38,268
你就是阿帕契人艾多
So you're Aldo the Apache.

1561
02:04:39,405 --> 02:04:42,397
-你就是犹太人终结者
-我是个侦探
-So you're The Jew Hunter.
-l'm a detective.

1562
02:04:42,475 --> 02:04:44,375
很高竿的侦探
A damn good detective.

1563
02:04:44,643 --> 02:04:46,270
找人是我的专长
Finding people is my specialty,

1564
02:04:46,345 --> 02:04:48,779
我专门替纳粹找人
so naturally, l worked for the Nazis
finding people.

1565
02:04:48,848 --> 02:04:51,976
有些是犹太人，但犹太人终结者？
And, yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?

1566
02:04:53,319 --> 02:04:55,287
那只是无聊的称号
Just a name that stuck.

1567
02:04:55,654 --> 02:04:58,452
不过你得承认很好记
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.

1568
02:04:59,925 --> 02:05:03,088
你能管敌人替你取的绰号吗？
Do you control the nicknames
your enemies bestow on you?

1569
02:05:03,162 --> 02:05:05,653
阿帕契人艾多和小矮子
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?

1570
02:05:06,765 --> 02:05:08,858
小矮子，什么意思？
What do you mean the Little Man?

1571
02:05:08,968 --> 02:05:10,765
德军替你取的绰号
Germans' nickname for you.

1572
02:05:10,836 --> 02:05:13,862
我的绰号是小矮子？
The Germans' nickname for me
is the Little Man?

1573
02:05:14,273 --> 02:05:18,801
容我说一句话
看到你这么高让我吓一跳
And as if to make my point, l'm a little
surprised how tall you were in real life.

1574
02:05:18,878 --> 02:05:21,312
你个子不高，但并不是侏儒
l mean, you're a little fellow,
but not circus-midget little,

1575
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:23,211
完全不符合你的绰号
as your reputation would suggest.

1576
02:05:23,282 --> 02:05:25,182
我的手下呢？
Where's my men?

1577
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:27,683
布莉姬范海慕丝玛克呢？
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?

1578
02:05:30,523 --> 02:05:33,720
姑且说，她得到该有的惩罚
Well, let's Just say,
she got what she deserved.

1579
02:05:36,195 --> 02:05:38,720
当你买通她这种双面间谍
And when you purchase friends like
Bridget von Hammersmark,

1580
02:05:38,831 --> 02:05:40,822
只能说便宜没好货
you get what you pay for.

1581
02:05:42,234 --> 02:05:47,228
至于你的麻吉们
唐诺维兹中士和欧玛一等兵...
Now as far as your paeSanoS,
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...

1582
02:05:47,339 --> 02:05:49,569
你怎么知道我们的名字？
How you know our names?

1583
02:05:49,842 --> 02:05:51,537
艾多中尉
Lieutenant Aldo,

1584
02:05:53,312 --> 02:05:54,745
如果你以为我不会拷问
if you don't think l wouldn't interrogate

1585
02:05:54,813 --> 02:05:58,180
额头被你刻上纳粹记号的人
every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors,

1586
02:06:00,619 --> 02:06:04,180
我们就没有我期待的互相尊重
we simply aren't operating on the level
of mutual respect l assumed.

1587
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:05,985
我猜没有吧
No, l guess not.

1588
02:06:06,058 --> 02:06:11,189
回到你的两名意大利破坏分子
Well, back to the whereabouts
of your two ltalian saboteurs.

1589
02:06:14,366 --> 02:06:16,129
目前为止
As of this moment,

1590
02:06:16,201 --> 02:06:21,036
他们都应该还坐在座位上吧
both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting
in the very seats we left them in.

1591
02:06:21,674 --> 02:06:25,235
我记得是0023和0024号座位
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24,
if my memory serves.

1592
02:06:26,045 --> 02:06:29,481
他们的脚踝还绑着炸药
随时都能引爆
Explosives still around their ankles,
still ready to explode.

1593
02:06:29,548 --> 02:06:32,813
至于你的任务
有些人会称之为恐怖行动
And your mission,
some would call a terrorist plot,

1594
02:06:32,885 --> 02:06:35,410
目前仍在进行中
as of this moment, is still a go.

1595
02:06:35,521 --> 02:06:38,820
这真是好消息
接下来呢？请他们看卡通？
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next? Eliza on Ice?

1596
02:06:38,891 --> 02:06:40,449
但是
However,

1597
02:06:42,027 --> 02:06:48,057
我只要拿起电话听筒通知戏院
你的计划就泡汤
all l have to do is pick up
this phone right here,
inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.

1598
02:06:50,436 --> 02:06:55,669
“如果”他们还在，还活着
真的是“如果”
lf they're still here, and if they're still alive,
and that's one big if,

1599
02:06:57,009 --> 02:07:00,501
你想抓他们，炸药就会引爆
there ain't no way you're going to take
them boys without setting off them bombs.

1600
02:07:00,579 --> 02:07:02,342
我毫不怀疑
l have no doubt.

1601
02:07:02,414 --> 02:07:05,747
有些德国人会死
也会破坏这美好的一夜
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.

1602
02:07:05,851 --> 02:07:08,718
你毁了戈培尔光荣的一刻
And, yes, Goebbels will be
very, very, very mad at you

1603
02:07:08,787 --> 02:07:10,880
他会对你超不爽的
for what you've done to his big night.

1604
02:07:12,124 --> 02:07:14,422
不过你杀不了他和希特勒
But you won't get Hitler,
you won't get Goebbels,

1605
02:07:14,526 --> 02:07:17,552
也杀不了戈林和鲍曼
you won't get Goring,
and you won't get Bormann.

1606
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:20,224
要杀死这四个人才能结束战争
And you need all four to end the war.

1607
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:25,097
要是我不拿起电话听筒
But if l don't pick up this phone right here,

1608
02:07:25,204 --> 02:07:27,434
你搞不好就能杀死他们
you may very well get all four.

1609
02:07:28,741 --> 02:07:33,576
如果你杀死他们
今晚战争就会
And if you get all four, you end the war

1610
02:07:34,813 --> 02:07:36,371
结束
tonight.

1611
02:07:37,449 --> 02:07:39,144
所以各位
So, gentlemen,

1612
02:07:39,718 --> 02:07:42,915
让我们讨论今晚结束战争的可能
let's discuss the prospect
of ending the war tonight.

1613
02:07:45,791 --> 02:07:47,656
照我看来
So, the way l see it,

1614
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:51,958
我的行动能决定希特勒的生死
since Hitler's death or possible rescue
rests solely on my reaction,

1615
02:07:52,631 --> 02:07:54,565
如果我坐视不管
if l do nothing,

1616
02:07:54,633 --> 02:07:58,660
他的死也等于是我造成的
你同意吧？
it's as if l'm causing his death even more
than yourselves. Wouldn't you agree?

1617
02:07:59,304 --> 02:08:00,999
我猜是吧
l guess so.

1618
02:08:03,275 --> 02:08:05,300
你呢，尤特维奇？
How about you, Utivich?

1619
02:08:05,411 --> 02:08:07,106
我猜也是
l guess so, too.

1620
02:08:12,484 --> 02:08:16,944
各位，我并不想杀死希特勒
戈培尔、戈林和鲍曼
Gentlemen, l have no intention
of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels
and killing Goring and killing Bormann,

1621
02:08:17,022 --> 02:08:19,786
更不会拱手把胜利让给盟军
not to mention winning the war
single-handedly for the Allies,

1622
02:08:19,858 --> 02:08:23,555
然后发现自己站在犹太法庭
only later to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.

1623
02:08:25,664 --> 02:08:29,191
如果你们今晚想赢得战争
lf you want to win the war tonight,

1624
02:08:30,836 --> 02:08:32,997
我们就得谈谈条件
we have to make a deal.

1625
02:08:36,008 --> 02:08:37,771
什么样的条件？
What kind of deal?

1626
02:08:37,843 --> 02:08:40,368
你无权决定的条件
The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.

1627
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:45,007
不过这场行动一定有指挥官
However, l'm sure this mission of yours
has a commanding officer.

1628
02:08:46,018 --> 02:08:47,713
一位将军
A general.

1629
02:08:48,020 --> 02:08:49,681
我打赌...
l'm betting for...

1630
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:53,551
我猜应该是战略情报局
OSS would be my guess.

1631
02:08:57,229 --> 02:08:59,697
宝“狗”
That's a bingo!

1632
02:09:02,701 --> 02:09:05,192
是不是这样说？宝“狗”？
ls that the way you say it? ''That's a bingo.''

1633
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:07,204
是“果”不是“狗”
You Just say, ''Bingo.''

1634
02:09:07,272 --> 02:09:09,502
宝果，真好玩
Bingo! How fun.

1635
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:15,004
我离题了，我们说到哪儿？
谈条件
But l digress. Where were we?
Yeah! Make a deal.

1636
02:09:15,547 --> 02:09:20,007
那里有一台效能很强的无线电
Over there is a very capable
two-way radio and sitting behind it

1637
02:09:20,085 --> 02:09:24,215
还有一名优秀的通讯官赫曼
is a more than capable radio operator
named Hermann.

1638
02:09:24,556 --> 02:09:26,888
帮我联络盟军的将领
Get me someone
on the other end of that radio

1639
02:09:26,959 --> 02:09:30,053
他有权力核准我的
with the power of the pen to authorize my,

1640
02:09:30,129 --> 02:09:33,064
这么说吧，有条件的投降
let's call it, the terms
of my conditional surrender.

1641
02:09:33,132 --> 02:09:35,532
如果这么说比较好听
lf that tastes better going down.

1642
02:09:36,301 --> 02:09:37,563
我来的地方...
You know, where l'm from...

1643
02:09:37,636 --> 02:09:39,570
到底是哪里？
Yeah? Where is that exactly?

1644
02:09:39,638 --> 02:09:41,697
美丽谷，田纳西州
Maynardville, Tennessee.

1645
02:09:41,774 --> 02:09:44,208
我卖过不少私酒
l've done my share of bootlegging.

1646
02:09:44,409 --> 02:09:48,072
如果你干的是
联邦政府说的非法勾当
Up there, if you engage in what the federal
government calls illegal activity,

1647
02:09:48,147 --> 02:09:50,274
而我们贩卖私酒
but what we call Just a man trying
to make a living for his family

1648
02:09:50,382 --> 02:09:54,785
只是为了养家活口的话
你就得随时提高警觉
selling moonshine liquor,
it behooves oneself to keep his wits.

1649
02:09:56,755 --> 02:10:00,156
长话短说，听起来太好的事
Long story short, we hear
a story too good to be true,

1650
02:10:00,826 --> 02:10:02,589
其实并不好
it ain't.

1651
02:10:03,929 --> 02:10:06,727
换作是我，我大概也会这么说
Sitting in your chair,
l would probably say the same thing,

1652
02:10:06,799 --> 02:10:11,463
而且绝大多数的时候
你说的完全没错
and 999.999 times out of a million,
you would be correct.

1653
02:10:13,472 --> 02:10:17,067
不过在历史的滚轮下
But in the pages of history,
every once in a while,

1654
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:21,010
偶尔命运之神会伸出手来
fate reaches out and extends its hand.

1655
02:10:27,853 --> 02:10:29,821
历史课本会怎么写？
What shall the history books read?

1656
02:10:56,682 --> 02:10:59,879
我求你，我们一定要炸毁钟塔
MAN.; I implore you.
we muSt deStroy that tower.

1657
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:02,947
中士，那栋钟塔...
Sarge, that tower...

1658
02:11:22,507 --> 02:11:24,475
不能炸毁钟塔！
MAN.; The tower StandS!

1659
02:11:26,678 --> 02:11:28,373
口香糖？
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Gum?

1660
02:12:14,893 --> 02:12:16,588
时候到了
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
lt's time.

1661
02:12:17,763 --> 02:12:20,561
我去封锁大门，再到银幕后面
l should go lock the auditorium and
take my place behind the screen.

1662
02:14:04,136 --> 02:14:06,331
当世人记载今晚的军事史
HANS: So when the military history
of this night is written,

1663
02:14:06,438 --> 02:14:10,135
我将是电影院行动的一分子
it will be recorded that l
was part of Operation Kino

1664
02:14:10,208 --> 02:14:12,972
从一开始我就是双面间谍
from the very beginning as a double agent.

1665
02:14:13,045 --> 02:14:17,106
我伪装成党卫军上校做的一切
Anything l've done in my guise
as an SS Colonel

1666
02:14:17,182 --> 02:14:20,208
都受到战略情报局的认可
was sanctioned by the OSS
as a necessary evil

1667
02:14:20,318 --> 02:14:22,980
全是为了掩护我的身分
to establish my cover with the Germans.

1668
02:14:23,221 --> 02:14:26,520
是我把雷恩中尉的炸药
And it was my placement
of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite

1669
02:14:26,625 --> 02:14:29,594
放在希特勒和戈培尔的包厢
确定能把他们炸死
in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box
that assured their demise.

1670
02:14:30,595 --> 02:14:33,257
我告诉元首观众已经入席
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
l informed the Fuhrer that the
audience has taken their seats.

1671
02:14:33,365 --> 02:14:35,333
他应该随时就会到
He should arrive any minute.

1672
02:14:36,168 --> 02:14:38,068
谢谢你，汉斯
Thank you, Hans.

1673
02:14:46,711 --> 02:14:49,737
最后那部分是真的
By the way, that last part is actually true.

1674
02:14:49,848 --> 02:14:54,751
我要全额的军职人员退抚金
以及按照我官阶的福利
l want my full military pension
and benefits under my proper rank.

1675
02:14:55,087 --> 02:14:57,521
我要因为协助推翻第三帝国
l want to receive
the Congressional Medal of Honor

1676
02:14:57,589 --> 02:15:01,548
获颁国会荣誉勋章
for my invaluable assistance
in the toppling of the Third Reich.

1677
02:15:02,961 --> 02:15:06,055
其实我要这次行动每个成员
ln fact, l want all the members
of Operation Kino

1678
02:15:06,131 --> 02:15:09,066
都获颁国会荣誉勋章
to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

1679
02:15:09,468 --> 02:15:13,199
不用说，我要成为美国公民
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.

1680
02:15:13,472 --> 02:15:16,737
我要美国政府
And l would like
the United States of America

1681
02:15:16,808 --> 02:15:20,869
替我在南塔克特岛置产
to purchase property for me
on Nantucket lsland

1682
02:15:20,946 --> 02:15:24,245
因为我加速纳粹党暴政的瓦解
as a reward for all
the countless lives l've saved

1683
02:15:24,316 --> 02:15:26,614
拯救了无数人命
by bringing the tyranny
of the National Socialist Party

1684
02:15:26,718 --> 02:15:30,313
藉以奖赏我的功劳
您都记下来了吗？
to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?

1685
02:15:32,090 --> 02:15:35,582
我也很期待能和您面对面
l look forward to seeing you
face to face as well, sir.

1686
02:15:36,461 --> 02:15:38,656
雷恩中尉？他在这里
Lieutenant Raine? Right here.

1687
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:43,094
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1688
02:15:43,168 --> 02:15:46,934
蓝达上校会把你和尤特维奇
以战俘身分押上卡车
GENERAL.; Colonel Landa will put you
and Private Utivich in a truck aS priSonerS.

1689

然后他和通讯官会上车
开到我们的防线
Then he and hiS radio operator will
get in the truck and drive to our lineS.

1690
02:15:51,476 --> 02:15:56,072
一旦跨越防线
蓝达上校和手下会向你投降
Upon croSSing our lineS, Colonel Landa
and hiS man will Surrender to you.

1691
02:15:56,148 --> 02:15:58,673
你要接手驾驶卡车
You will then take over driving of the truck

1692
02:15:58,783 --> 02:16:02,150
把他们带来做简报，了解吗？
and bring them Straight to me for debriefing.
IS that clear, Lieutenant?

1693
02:16:02,254 --> 02:16:03,380
了解，长官
Yes, sir.

1694
02:16:03,455 --> 02:16:05,150
通话完毕
Over and out.

1695
02:16:29,381 --> 02:16:32,714
戈培尔博士，我想出去一下
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Herr Dr. Goebbels, excuse me.
Could l go out for a moment?

1696
02:16:33,652 --> 02:16:37,019
我完全能理解
去吧，电影结束后见
Perfectly understandable, my boy.
You go now,
and we'll see you after the show.

1697
02:17:44,556 --> 02:17:45,853
哪位？
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)
Who is it?

1698
02:17:45,924 --> 02:17:47,687
弗德列克！
Fredrick!

1699
02:17:48,426 --> 02:17:49,984
该死
Shit.

1700
02:17:54,032 --> 02:17:56,330
你是戏院经理吗？我要退钱
Are you the manager of this cinema?
l want my money back.

1701
02:17:56,701 --> 02:17:58,669
男主角演得烂透了
That actor in the movie stinks.

1702
02:18:00,538 --> 02:18:01,800
你跑来干嘛？
What are you doing here?

1703
02:18:01,873 --> 02:18:03,636
我来看你呀
l came to visit you.

1704
02:18:04,276 --> 02:18:05,538
你没看到我在忙吗？
Can't you see how busy l am?

1705
02:18:05,610 --> 02:18:07,510
那就让我帮忙
Then allow me to lend an assist.

1706
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:10,541
这不好笑，你不能进来
Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.

1707
02:18:11,216 --> 02:18:13,480
这是你的首映会，快回去吧
This is your premiere,
you need to be out there with them.

1708
02:18:16,621 --> 02:18:18,646
平常来说，你说得对
Normally, you would be right.

1709
02:18:18,890 --> 02:18:20,824
我对我拍的其它电影...
And for all the other films l do...

1710
02:18:20,892 --> 02:18:23,759
...绝对会以高昂气势撑到底
...l intend to endure evenings like tonight,
in the proper spirit.

1711
02:18:25,930 --> 02:18:27,898
但是，事实是...
However, the fact remains...

1712
02:18:28,233 --> 02:18:30,531
...这部电影改编自我的经历
...this film is based on my military exploits.

1713
02:18:30,969 --> 02:18:34,598
而我的经历包括杀死很多人
And in this case,
my exploits consisted of killing many men.

1714
02:18:36,074 --> 02:18:38,235
现在放映的这个部分...
Consequently, the part of
the film that's playing now...

1715
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:42,480
...我真的很不想看
...l don't like watching this part.

1716
02:18:43,748 --> 02:18:45,841
-很抱歉，弗德列克...
-所以...
-l am sorry, Fredrick, but...
-So, l thought...

1717
02:18:45,917 --> 02:18:48,147
...我就想上来尽全力...
...l'd come up here and do what l do best...

1718
02:18:48,486 --> 02:18:50,181
...来烦你
...annoy you.

1719
02:18:50,588 --> 02:18:53,580
从你的表情看来，我很成功
And from the look on your face,
it would appear l haven't lost my touch.

1720
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:57,251
你真的很习惯受到奉承...
Are you so used to
the Nazis kissing your ass...

1721
02:18:57,329 --> 02:18:59,354
...忘了“不”的意思吗？
...you've forgotten what the word
''no'' means?

1722
02:18:59,431 --> 02:19:01,365
不...你不能进来
No...you can't be here!

1723
02:19:01,533 --> 02:19:03,091
走开
Now go away!

1724
02:19:05,537 --> 02:19:06,868
弗德列克，你弄痛我了
Fredrick, you hurt me.

1725
02:19:06,938 --> 02:19:11,272
很高兴知道你至少有感觉
Well, it's nice to know
you can feel something.

1726
02:19:12,110 --> 02:19:14,135
就算只是身体的痛楚
Even if it's Just physical pain.

1727
02:19:14,612 --> 02:19:16,842
我不是那种轻易放弃的人
l'm not a man you say, ''go away'' to.

1728
02:19:17,549 --> 02:19:21,715
意大利有三百多具尸体能作证
There's over three hundred dead bodies
in ltaly,
that if they could, would testify to that!

1729
02:19:24,356 --> 02:19:25,823
我为你做了这么多...
After what l've done for you...

1730
02:19:25,890 --> 02:19:27,949
...你却毫不尊重我
...you disrespect me at your peril!

1731
02:19:28,293 --> 02:19:29,817
把门锁上
Lock the door.

1732
02:19:29,894 --> 02:19:31,521
什么？
What?

1733
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:33,288
把门锁上
Lock the door.

1734
02:19:33,365 --> 02:19:35,265
我们时间不多
We don't have much time.

1735
02:19:37,635 --> 02:19:39,330
要干嘛？
Time for what?
(SlGHS)

1736
02:19:39,637 --> 02:19:40,899
算了！
Forget it!

1737
02:19:40,972 --> 02:19:42,872
不...不...等等
--No, no, no...wait.

1738
02:19:43,808 --> 02:19:45,833
你要我...把门锁上？
You want me to...lock the door?

1739
02:19:46,478 --> 02:19:48,503
要我说几百遍，对啦
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.

1740
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:51,660
我杀了他，你离警卫还有30英尺
When l kill that guy,
you got 30 feet to get to that guard.

1741
02:21:51,769 --> 02:21:54,260
-你办得到吗？
-我非办到不行
-Can you do it?
-l have to.

1742
02:22:23,935 --> 02:22:25,698
来杯香槟？
Champagne?

1743
02:22:46,958 --> 02:22:48,949
太赞了，太精采了！
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Extraordinary my dear, simply extraordinary!

1744
02:22:49,494 --> 02:22:51,655
这是你至今最好的作品
This is your finest film yet.

1745
02:22:52,797 --> 02:22:54,765
多谢夸奖，元首
Thank you, my Fuhrer.

1746
02:22:56,301 --> 02:22:57,928
谢谢你
Thank you.

1747
02:23:17,155 --> 02:23:19,817
谁要向德国传送讯息？
who wantS to Send a meSSage to Germany?

1748
02:23:20,658 --> 02:23:22,990
我要向德国传送一个讯息
I have a meSSage for Germany.

1749
02:23:26,497 --> 02:23:28,692
你们全都会死翘翘
That you are all going to die.

1750
02:23:29,734 --> 02:23:31,099
够了！关掉！
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
Enough! Stop it!

1751
02:23:31,169 --> 02:23:32,431
把放映机关掉！
Turn off the proJector!

1752
02:23:32,503 --> 02:23:37,873
我要你们仔细看
要杀死你们的犹太人的巨脸
And I want you to look deep into the face
of the Jew who'S going to do it!

1753
02:23:38,009 --> 02:23:39,943
我不懂，这不是我的电影
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
l don't know what's going on.
That does not belong in my movie!

1754
02:23:40,011 --> 02:23:43,037
马瑟，把戏院烧掉吧
Marcel, burn it down.

1755
02:23:44,048 --> 02:23:45,811
是，苏珊娜
Oui, Shosanna.

1756
02:24:21,052 --> 02:24:23,145
我叫苏珊娜德瑞芙斯
My name iS ShoSanna DreyfuS,

1757
02:24:23,554 --> 02:24:25,181
这就是
and thiS iS the face

1758
02:24:27,058 --> 02:24:29,390
犹太人复仇的巨脸
of JewiSh vengeance.

1759
02:26:25,409 --> 02:26:27,877
美军防线到了，上校
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN)
These are the American lines, Colonel sir.

1760
02:26:29,013 --> 02:26:30,913
太好了，赫曼
Excellent, Hermann.

1761
02:26:35,052 --> 02:26:37,020
解开他们的手铐
HANS: Hermann, uncuff them.

1762
02:26:55,473 --> 02:26:59,466
我正式向你投降，雷恩中尉
l'm officially surrendering myself
over to you, Lieutenant Raine.

1763
02:27:00,611 --> 02:27:02,579
我们是你的战俘
We're your prisoners.

1764
02:27:03,247 --> 02:27:05,147
我的刀子呢？
How about my knife?

1765
02:27:10,922 --> 02:27:12,913
谢谢你，上校
Thank you very much, Colonel.

1766
02:27:12,990 --> 02:27:16,050
把上校的双手铐起来
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands
behind his back.

1767
02:27:16,127 --> 02:27:18,322
真的有这必要吗？
ls that really necessary?

1768
02:27:18,429 --> 02:27:20,488
这是一定要的
l'm a slave to appearances.

1769
02:27:23,668 --> 02:27:25,568
剥了他的头皮
Scalp Hermann.

1770
02:27:26,838 --> 02:27:28,601
你疯了吗？
Are you mad?

1771
02:27:28,906 --> 02:27:30,806
你做了什么？
What have you done?

1772
02:27:31,175 --> 02:27:34,474
你的将军说好不会杀他！
l made a deal with your general
for that man's life!

1773
02:27:35,580 --> 02:27:38,981
没错，不过他们只需要你
Yeah, they made that deal. But they don't
give a fuck about him. They need you.

1774
02:27:39,083 --> 02:27:41,017
你会因此被枪决
You'll be shot for this!

1775
02:27:41,652 --> 02:27:45,179
才怪，只会被臭骂一顿而已
我从小被骂到大
Nah, l don't think so. More like chewed out.
l've been chewed out before.

1776
02:27:46,490 --> 02:27:50,688
我们听到你和将军谈的条件
You know, Utivich and myself heard
that deal you made with the brass.

1777
02:27:51,128 --> 02:27:53,096
今晚就结束战争？
End the war tonight?

1778
02:27:54,298 --> 02:27:55,890
我也会答应你的条件
l'd make that deal.

1779
02:27:55,967 --> 02:27:57,867
你呢？你会答应吗？
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?

1780
02:27:57,935 --> 02:28:01,427
-当然会
-我不怪你，条件真的很好
-l'd make that deal.
-l don't blame you. Damn good deal.

1781
02:28:02,206 --> 02:28:05,334
至于你替自己争取的福利
And that pretty little nest
you feathered for yourself.

1782
02:28:05,443 --> 02:28:08,810
如果你肯烧死德军的高层领导
Well, if you're willing to barbecue
the whole High Command,

1783
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:11,872
搞不好是很值得考虑
l suppose that's worth
certain considerations.

1784
02:28:12,617 --> 02:28:14,710
不过我有一个问题
But l do have one question.

1785
02:28:15,786 --> 02:28:18,550
当你到了南塔克特岛
When you get to your little place
on Nantucket lsland,

1786
02:28:18,656 --> 02:28:23,184
一定会脱掉帅气的党卫军制服
l imagine you are going to take off
that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.

1787
02:28:23,294 --> 02:28:24,921
对吧？
Ain't you?

1788
02:28:28,566 --> 02:28:30,397
我就知道
That's what l thought.

1789
02:28:31,168 --> 02:28:33,136
这我可不能接受
Now, that l can't abide.

1790
02:28:34,472 --> 02:28:36,736
你呢？你能接受吗？
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?

1791
02:28:36,841 --> 02:28:38,706
绝对不能
Not one damn bit, sir.

1792
02:28:40,344 --> 02:28:42,403
要是照我的方法
l mean, if l had my way,

1793
02:28:42,914 --> 02:28:47,374
你这辈子都得穿着那套军服
you'd wear that goddamn uniform
for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.

1794
02:28:48,886 --> 02:28:49,944
不过我知道很不实际
But l'm aware that ain't practical.

1795
02:28:50,021 --> 02:28:53,047
你总得把它脱掉
l mean, at some point,
you're going to have to take it off.

1796
02:28:53,157 --> 02:28:54,784
所以呢
So,

1797
02:28:55,192 --> 02:28:58,923
我要给你一个脱不掉的记号
l'm going to give you
a little something you can't take off.

1798
02:29:23,821 --> 02:29:25,982
你知道吗，尤特维奇？
You know something, Utivich?

1799
02:29:26,324 --> 02:29:29,088
这应该会是我的旷世巨作
l think this Just might be my masterpiece.
