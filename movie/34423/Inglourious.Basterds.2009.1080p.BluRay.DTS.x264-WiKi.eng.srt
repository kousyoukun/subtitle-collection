Chapter One

2
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,442
Once upon a time...

3
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,954
in Nazi-occupied France

4
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,890


5
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,728
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Go back inside and shut the door.

6
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,136
Julie, get me some water for my wash up...

7
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,797
...then get inside with your sisters.

8
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,025
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Ready, Papa.

9
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,436
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Thank you, my darling...

10
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,774
...now you go inside with your sisters.

11
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,344
Don't run.

12
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,137
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) ls this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

13
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,671
l am Perrier LaPadite.

14
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,142
lt is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur LaPadite...

15
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,687
...l am Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.

16
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,245
What can l do for you?

17
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,656
l was hoping you could invite me inside your home...

18
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,190
...and we may have a discussion.

19
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,153
Certainly. After you.

20
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,936
Colonel Landa, this is my family.

21
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,348
Colonel Hans Landa of the SS...

22
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,847
...Mademoiselle...

23
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,184
...at your service.

24
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:56,289
The rumors l have heard in the village about your family are all true.

25
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,227
Each one of your daughters is more lovely than the last.

26
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,994
Merci.

27
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:06,762
Please...

28
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,564
...have a seat.

29
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,214
Suzanne, would you be so good as to get the Colonel some wine?

30
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,708
But no.

31
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,149
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.

32
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:27,056
This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in assuming you have milk?

33
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,218
Oui.

34
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,659
Then milk is what l prefer.

35
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,121
Very well.

36
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,926
Julie, would you mind closing the window?

37
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,947
Merci.

38
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,339
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows...

39
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,109
...l say, ''Bravo.''

40
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,202
Thank you.

41
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,278
Please Join me at your table.

42
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,175
Very well.

43
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:32,715
Monsieur LaPadite...

44
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:37,724
...what we have to discuss would be better discussed in private.

45
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,499
You'll notice l left my men outdoors.

46
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:47,504
lf it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside?

47
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,332
You are right.

48
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,505
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside?

49
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,970
The Colonel and l need to have a few words.

50
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,187
Monsieur LaPadite...

51
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:15,596
...l regret to inform you l've exhausted the extent of my French.

52
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,669
To continue to speak it so inadequately would only serve to embarrass me.

53
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,741
However, l've been led to believe you speak English quite well.

54
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,102
Yes.

55
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:31,377
Well, it Just so happens, l do as well. This being your house...

56
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,916
...l ask your permission to switch to English... ...for the remainder of the conversation.

57
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,247
By all means.

58
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,754
While l'm very familiar with you and your family,

59
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,524
l have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who l am.

60
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,627
Are you aware of my existence?

61
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,863
-Yes. -This is good.

62
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:56,465
Now, are you aware of the Job l've been ordered to carry out in France?

63
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,369
Yes.

64
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,571
Please tell me what you've heard.

65
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:09,718
l've heard that the Fuhrer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France

66
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,724
who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.

67
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:17,061
The Fuhrer couldn't have said it better himself.

68
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,628
But the meaning of your visit,

69
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:27,300
pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.

70
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,240
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews

71
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,211
and found nothing.

72
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,409
l'm aware of that.

73
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,341
l've read the reports of this area.

74
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,618
But like any enterprise, when under new management,

75
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,785
there is always a slight duplication of efforts,

76
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:54,660
most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.

77
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,762
l Just have a few questions, monSieur LaPadite.

78
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,504
lf you can assist me with answers,

79
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,668
my department can close the file on your family.

80
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,848
Now,

81
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:21,289
before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area,

82
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,159
all dairy farmers like yourself.

83
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:30,628
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts

84
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,168
and the Dreyfuses.

85
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,832
ls that correct?

86
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,966
To my knowledge,

87
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,501
those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.

88
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:44,480
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if l smoked my pipe?

89
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,017
(CHUCKLES) Please, monSieur LaPadite,

90
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,054
this is your house, make yourself comfortable.

91
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,357
Now, according to these papers,

92
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,717
all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for

93
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,662
except the Dreyfuses.

94
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,525
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.

95
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,903
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape

96
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,874
or someone is very successfully hiding them.

97
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,707
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monSieur LaPadite?

98
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,215
-Only rumors. -l love rumors!

99
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,118
Facts could be so misleading,

100
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,350
where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.

101
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,214
So, monSieur LaPadite,

102
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,557
what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?

103
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,529
Again, this is Just a rumor,

104
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:41,904
but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.

105
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,616
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?

106
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,710
Yes.

107
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,624
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me

108
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,959
the exact members of the household and their names?

109
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,405
There were five of them.

110
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,270
The father, Jacob.

111
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,603
Wife, Miram.

112
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,279
And her brother, Bob.

113
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,257
How old is Bob?

114
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,564
Thirty, 31 .

115
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,793
Continue.

116
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,498
And the children,

117
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,902
Amos

118
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,241
and Shosanna.

119
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,015
Ages of the children?

120
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,551
Amos was nine or 10.

121
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,956
-And Shosanna? -And Shosanna was

122
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,369
18 or 19. l'm not really sure.

123
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,582
Well, l guess that should do it.

124
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,394
However, before l go, could l have another glass of your delicious milk?

125
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,128
But of course.

126
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,732
MonSieur LaPadite,

127
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,803
are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?

128
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,919
l have no interest in such things.

129
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,617
But you are aware of what they call me.

130
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,853
l'm aware.

131
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,128
What are you aware of?

132
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,237
-That they call you ''The Jew Hunter.'' -Precisely.

133
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,175
l understand your trepidation in repeating it.

134
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,581
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker

135
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,280
the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.

136
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,619
Actually, why he would hate the name ''the Hangman'' is baffling to me.

137
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:49,092
lt would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.

138
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,426
Now l, on the other hand, love my unofficial title

139
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,864
precisely because l've earned it.

140
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,363
The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is,

141
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,134
as opposed to most German soldiers,

142
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,200
l can think like a Jew

143
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,608
where they can only think like a German.

144
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,715
(CHUCKLlNG) More precisely, a German soldier.

145
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:23,026
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast,

146
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,123
it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.

147
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,468
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast,

148
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,630
it would be that of the rat.

149
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:40,310
The Fuhrer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.

150
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,371
But where our conclusions differ,

151
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,474
is l don't consider the comparison an insult.

152
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,822
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.

153
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,887
lt's a hostile world, indeed.

154
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,165
lf a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now,

155
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,666
would you greet it with hostility?

156
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,502
l suppose l would.

157
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:10,508
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?

158
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,005
Rats spread disease. They bite people.

159
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:18,346
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.

160
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:23,621
l propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.

161
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,452
Would you agree?

162
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,720
Yet, l assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels

163
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,559
-that you do with rats, do you? -No.

164
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,523
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?

165
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,560
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?

166
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,805
lt's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.

167
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,567
However interesting as the thought may be,

168
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,909
it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.

169
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,311
lf a rat were to walk in here, right now, as l'm talking

170
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,323
would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?

171
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,189
Probably not.

172
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,222
l didn't think so.

173
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,388
You don't like them.

174
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,399
You don't really know why you don't like them.

175
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,163
All you know is you find them repulsive.

176
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,465
Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search

177
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,066
of a house suspected of hiding Jews.

178
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,571
Where does the hawk look?

179
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,844
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar,

180
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,350
he looks everywhere he would hide.

181
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,484
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.

182
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,423
However, the reason the Fuhrer has brought me off my Alps in Austria

183
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,934
and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.

184
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,536
Because l'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of

185
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,800
once they abandon dignity.

186
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,536
May l smoke my pipe as well?

187
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,782
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.

188
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,627
Now, my Job dictates

189
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,636
that l must have my men enter your home

190
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,481
and conduct a thorough search

191
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,315
before l can officially cross your family's name off my list.

192
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,990
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.

193
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,288
That is unless you have something to tell me

194
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,352
that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.

195
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,693
l might add, also, that any information

196
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,463
that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.

197
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,831
Actually, quite the contrary. lt will be met with reward.

198
00:17:56,341 --> 00:18:00,506
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way

199
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:05,016
by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.

200
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,027
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?

201
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,859
Yes.

202
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:32,275
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?

203
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,337
Yes.

204
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,743
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.

205

Yes.

208

l'm going to switch back to French now, and l want you to follow my masquerade.

My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.

228
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,888
And l'm putting together a special team, and l need me eight soldiers.

229
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,095
Eight Jewish American soldiers.

230
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:49,637
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.

231
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,437
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.

232
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,944
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.

233
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,881
Once we're in enemy territory,

234
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,476
as a bushwhacking guerrilla army,

235
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,887
we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.

236
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,426
Killing Nazis.

237
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,520
l don't know about you all,

238

but l sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains,

239

cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily

240
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:23,006
and Jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.

241
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,167
Nazi ain't got no humanity.

242
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,438
They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac

243
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,744
and they need to be destroyed.

244
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,484
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform,

245
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,752
they're going to die.

246
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,161
Now, l'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.

247
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,424
That means l got a little lndian in me.

248
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:51,697
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.

249
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,102
We will be cruel to the Germans.

250
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,772
And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.

251
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,207
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty

252
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,247
in the disemboweled, dismembered

253
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,978
and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.

254
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,610
And the German won't be able to help themselves

255
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:13,385
but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands,

256
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,495
and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.

257
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,230
And the German will be sickened by us.

258
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,528
And the German will talk about us.

259
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,796
And the German will fear us.

260
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,829
And when the German closes their eyes at night

261
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,206
and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done,

262
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,973
it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.

263

271

00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:33,569
AS a German-enliSted man, he killed 13 GeStapo officerS.

324
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,884
InStead of putting him up againSt a wall,

325
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,828
the High Command decided to Send him back to Berlin

326
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,798
to be made an example of.

327
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,666
NeedleSS to Say, once the BaSterdS heard about him,

328
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,973
he never got there.

329
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,579
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?

330
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,879
Lieutenant Aldo Raine. These are the Basterds.

331
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,612
Ever heard of us?

332
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,148
We Just want to say we're a big fan of your work.

333
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,419
When it comes to killing Nazis,

334
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,926
l think you show great talent.

335
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,798
And l pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.

336
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:10,469
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.

337
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,501
We all come here to see if you want to go pro.

338
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,684
Can l assume you know who we are?

339
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,756
You're Aldo the Apache.

340
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,958
Werner, if you heard of us,

341
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,689
you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.

342
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:35,698
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.

343
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,358
HlRSCHBERG: (LAUGHlNG) Oh, yeah.

344
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,194
Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.

345
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,500
Either kill you or let you go.

346
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,134
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive

347
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,178
depends entirely on you.

348
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,212
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.

349
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:59,055
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.

350
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,051
lf that patrol were to have any crack shots,

351
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,129
that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.

352
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,663
So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again,

353
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,561
you got to show me on this here map where they are.

354
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:18,840
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me

355
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,378
what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.

356
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:27,045
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.

357
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:32,079
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what l expect.

358
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,087
l need to know about Germans hiding in trees.

359
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,322
And you need to tell me. And you need to tell me right now.

360
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,088
Now, Just take that finger of yours

361
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:44,430
and point out on this here map where this party is being held,

362
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,902
how many is coming and what they brought to play with.

363
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,343
l respectfully refuse, sir.

364
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,312
Hear that?

365
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,811
Yes.

366
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,755
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.

367
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,755
You might know him better by his nickname.

368
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,592
The Bear Jew.

369
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,726
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.

370
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,738
-l heard of The Bear Jew. -What did you hear?

371
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,275
Beats German soldiers with a club.

372
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,441
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.

373
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,874
And, Werner, l'm going to ask you one last goddamn time,

374
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,943
and if you still respectfully refuse, l'm calling The Bear Jew over.

375
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,988
He's going to take that big bat of his,

376
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:41,150
and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.

377
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,327
Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger,

378
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,389
and point out on this map what l want to know.

379
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,102
Fuck you.

380
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,211
And your Jew dogs.

381
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,841
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.

382
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,783
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death

383
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,754
is the closest we ever get to going to the movies. Donny!

384
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,949
DONNY: Yeah?

385
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,515
Got us a German here who wants to die for country.

386
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,594
Oblige him.

387
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,029
Did you get that for killing Jews?

388
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,925
Bravery.

389
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:48,911
BASTERD 1 : Oh, no!

390
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,180
BASTERD 2: Oh, no!

391
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,881
Donny!

392
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,149
BASTERD: Yeah, Donny!

393
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:56,189
About now l'd be shitting my pants if l was you.

394
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,290
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!

395
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:04,027
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!

396
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,038
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!

397
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,664
You!

398
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,141
Damn it, Hirschberg!

399
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:17,113
Donny, bring that other one over here. Alive!

400
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:20,282
Get the fuck up! Batter up. You're on deck!

401
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,281
Two hits. l hit you, you hit the ground.

ALDO: Wicki.

404
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,397
Ask him if he wants to live.

405
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,964
Tell him to point out on this map the German position.

406
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,808
Ask him how many Germans.

407
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,673
Around about 1 2.

408
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,714
What kind of artillery?

409
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,148
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) How did you survive this ordeal?

410
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,720
They let me go.

411
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,520
Now, when you report what happened here,

412
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:07,257
you can't tell them you told us what you told us. They'll shoot you.

413
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:11,199
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.

414
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,999
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks

415
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,506
what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.

416
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:22,337
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) You are not to tell anybody anything. Not one word of detail!

417
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,315
Your outfit was ambushed, and you got away!

418
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,619
Not one word more!

419
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,082
Yes, my Fuhrer.

420
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,356
Did they mark you like they did the other survivors?

421
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,558
Yes, my Fuhrer.

422
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,329
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?

423
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,972
l will hug my mother like l've never hugged her before.

424
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,668
WlCKl: He's going to hug his mother.

425
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,539
Well, ain't that nice?

426
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,974
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.

427
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,114
(BUTZ SPEAKlNG GERMAN) Not only shall l remove it, but l intend to burn it.

428
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,487
WlCKl: He's going to burn it.

429
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,485
Yeah, that's what we thought. We don't like that.

430
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:12,485
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms. That way you can spot them.

431
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,463
Just like that.

432
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:22,935
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.

433
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,201
And that don't sit well with us.

434
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,873
So l'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.

435
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,726
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.

00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:29,818
Well... ...it's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.

484
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,053
Sweet dreams, mademoiselle.

485
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,681
Adieu.

486
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,962
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Hello, mademoiselle.

487
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,302
May l Join you?

488
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,638
Look, Fredrick...

489
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,468
You remember my name?

490
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,099
Yes.

491
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,371
Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow...

492
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,706
Thank you.

493
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,304
You're welcome.

494
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,407
Regardless, l want you to stop pestering me.

495
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,488
l apologize, mademoiselle...

496
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,914
...l wasn't trying to be a pest.

497
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,193
l was simply trying to be friendly.

498
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,829
l don't wish to be your friend.

499
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,225
Why not?

500
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,863
Don't act like an infant. You know why.

501
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,637
l'm more than Just a uniform.

502
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,367
Not to me.

503
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,739
lf you are so desperate for a French girlfriend...

504
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,336
...l suggest you try Vichy.

505
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,811
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Who are you?

506
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:37,947
l thought l was Just a uniform.

507
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,983
You're not Just a German soldier.

508
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,949
Are you somebody's son?

509
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,454
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.

510
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:20,754
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) You're a very lucky girl, catching a brave war hero.

511
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,655
--No, no, no, no, the mademoiselle is not my girlfriend.

512
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,319
Can you write ''Amour Babette''?

513
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,353
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) So you're a war hero.

514
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,622
What did you do?

515
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,727
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) l was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city.

516
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,191
lt was myself and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest...

517
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,662
...against three hundred enemy soldiers.

518
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,805
What's a bird's nest?

519
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,902
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower.

520
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,348
lt's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view.

521
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,444
Very advantageous for marksmen.

522
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,422
How many did you kill?

523
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,050
Sixty-eight.

524
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,387
The first day.

525
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,960
A hundred and fifty...

526
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,095
...the second day.

527
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,205
Thirty-two the third day.

528
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,538
On the fourth day they exited the city.

529
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:51,812
Naturally, my war story received a lot of attention in Germany...

530
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,241
...that's why they all recognize me.

531
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,451
They call me the German Sergeant York.

532
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,190
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits.

533
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,453
Well, that's Just what Joseph Goebbels thought.

534
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,764
So he did and called it ''Nation's Pride.''

535
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:14,503
And they wanted me to play myself...

536
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,397
...so l did.

537
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,908
Joseph thinks this movie will be proven to be his masterpiece.

538
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,738
And l will be the German Van Johnson.

539
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,411
''Nation's Pride'' is about you?

540
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,775
''Nation's Pride'' is starring you?

541
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,214
l know.

542
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,050
Comical?

543
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:35,489
Well, good luck with your movie, Private. l hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself.

544
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,661
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Goodbye!

545
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:51,430
-Do you need help? -No, it's okay.

546
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:52,702
lf you need me, l'll be in the storage room.

547
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:54,676
Okay, my love.

548
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,077
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Mademoiselle Mimieux?

549
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,606
Yes?

550
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,150
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) ls this your cinema?

551
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,712
Yes.

552
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,653
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Come down!

553
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,958
Please.

554
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,806
l don't understand. What have l done? (SPEAKlNG GERMAN)

555
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,181
She wants to know what she's done.

556
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,947
Get your ass in that car.

557
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:35,109
lt's only the offspring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically.

558
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,448
American Olympic gold can be measured in Negro sweat.

559
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,577


560
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,164
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Good, you came.

561
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,532
l wasn't sure whether or not you'd accept my invitation.

562
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:01,395
lnvitation?

563
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:02,904
(GOEBBELS SPEAKlNG GERMAN)

564
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,600
ls that the young lady in question, Fredrick? Yes, it is, Dr. Goebbels.

565
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,409
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Emmanuelle, there is somebody l want you to meet.

566
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:13,943
Emmanuelle Mimieux, l'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda...

567
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,314
...the leader of the entire German film industry...

568
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:21,622
...and now that l'm an actor, my boss, Dr. Joseph Goebbels.

569
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:24,517
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) Your reputation precedes you, Fraulein Mimieux.

570
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:34,299
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) And normally, this is Herr Goebbels' French interpreter...

571
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,229
...Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.

572
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,864
Hello.

573
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:44,070
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Hello.

574
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,950
And you've met the MaJor.

575
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,852
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) Actually, l didn't introduce myself. MaJor Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo.

576
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,290
At your service, mademoiselle.

577
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,219
Please allow me...

578
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,487
...have a seat, please.

579
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,995
Try the champagne, mademoiselle, it's quite good.

580
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:19,348
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) l must say, Fraulein, l should be rather annoyed with you.

581
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,184
l arrive in France...

582
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,517
...and l wish to have lunch with my star.

583
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,380
Little do l know...

584
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,357
...he's become the toast of Paris.

585
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:35,029
And now he must find time for me.

586
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:42,030
People wait in line hours, days to see me.

587
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,201
For the Fuhrer...

588
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,538
...and Private Zoller, l wait.

589
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:54,446
So finally, l'm granted an audience with the young Private.

590
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,056
And he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema.

591
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,358
So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down to business.

592
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:03,586
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) --Herr Minister Doctor Goebbels...

593
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,024
l haven't informed her yet.

594
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,087
Unless the girl's a simpleton, l'm sure she's figured it out by now.

595
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,888
After all, she does operate a cinema.

596
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,425
Francesca, tell her. (SPEAKlNG FRENCH)

597
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,531
What they are trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller...

598
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:18,130
...has spent the last hour at lunch trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels...

599
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,801
...to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller's film premiere...

600
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,906
...and change the venue to your cinema.

601
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,072
What?

602
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,807
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH)

603
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:31,153
l wanted to inform her. Shit! l apologize, Private, of course you did.

604
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,414
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) --What's the issue?

605
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,088
The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself.

606
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:37,585
Nonsense!

607
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,927
Until l ask my questions, he has nothing to inform.

608
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:45,064
Let the record state, l have not agreed to switch cinemas for my premiere.

609
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,062
Duly noted.

610
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,906
You have opera boxes?

611
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:56,269
Yes.

612
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,338
How many?

613
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,243
Two.

614
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:04,344
More would be better.

615
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:07,253
(GOEBBELS SPEAKlNG GERMAN) How many seats in your auditorium?

616
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:08,950
Three hundred and fifty.

617
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:15,961
That's almost four hundred less than The Ritz.

618
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:17,631
--But Dr. Goebbels...

619
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,261
...that's not such a terrible thing.

620
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,870
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two-faced French bourgeois...

621
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:23,997
...taking up space, currying favor.

622
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,201
With less seats, it makes the event more exclusive.

623
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:31,103
You're not trying to fill the house, they're fighting for seats.

624
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,449
Besides, to hell with the French.

625
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:37,320
This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration.

626
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,381
This night is for you, me...

627
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,925
...for the German military, the high command...

628
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,017
...their family and friends.

629
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,424
The only people who should be allowed in the room...

630
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,862
...are people who will be moved by the exploits on the screen.

631
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,366
l see your public speaking has improved.

632
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,870
lt appears l've created a monster.

633
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,348
A strangely persuasive monster.

634
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,255
When the war is over, politics await.

635
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,068
Well, Private...

636
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,941
...though it is true, l'm inclined to indulge you anything...

637
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:38,779
l must watch a film in this young lady's cinema before l can say, yes or no.

638
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:46,279
So young lady, you are to close your cinema for a private screening tonight.

639
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,094
What German films do you have?

640
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,091
Ah, Landa, you are here.

641
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,999
(FREDRlCK SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Emmanuelle, this is Colonel Hans Landa of the SS.

642
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,539
He'll be running the security for the premiere.

643
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:10,610
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Charmed, mademoiselle.

644
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,555
HANS: Au revoir, Shosanna!

645
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:25,155
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) And now l must get the Reich Minister to his next appointment.

646
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:27,763
Slave driver.

647
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,760
French slave driver.

648
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:39,132
Actually, in my role as security chief of this Joyous German occasion, l'm afraid l must...

649
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,741
...have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux.

650
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,171
(FREDRlCK SPEAKlNG GERMAN) What sort of discussion?

651
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:51,983
That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel.

652
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,756
Or am l Just being sensitive?

653
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,918
(FREDRlCK SPEAKlNG GERMAN) Nothing could be further from the truth, Colonel.

654
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,456
Your authority is beyond question.

655
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,160
But your reputation does precede you.

656
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,623
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned?

657
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,990
(GOEBBELS SPEAKlNG GERMAN) Hans, the boy means no harm...

658
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:07,159
...he's simply smitten.

659
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,472
And he's correct. Your reputation does precede you.

660
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,640
No need for concern, you two. As security chief, l simply need to have a chat...

661
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,975
...with the possible new venue's property owner.

662
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,991
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Have you tried the strudel here?

663
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:35,790
No, no.

664
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,291
lt's not so terrible.

665
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:43,730
So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted?

666
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,845
Yes, two strudels. One for myself and one for the mademoiselle.

667
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,010
For me a cup of espresso and for the mademoiselle...

668
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,512
...a glass of milk.

669
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,689
So, mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain...?

670
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:09,362
Up until a couple of days ago, l had no knowledge of Private Zoller...

671
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,057
...or his exploits.

672
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:13,192
To me...

673
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,700
...the Private was simply Just a patron of my cinema. We spoke a few times but--

674
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,866
--Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.

675
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,441
This is a simple formality.

676
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,205
No reason for you to feel anxious.

677
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,884
l apologize, l forgot to order the cream.

678
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:36,551
--One moment.

679
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,129
Wait for the cream.

680
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,916
So, Emmanuelle. May l call you Emmanuelle?

681
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,075
Oui.

682
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,917
So, Emmanuelle...

683
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:09,816
...explain to me...

684
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,919
...how does it happen, that a young lady such as yourself, comes to own a cinema?

685
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,467
After you.

686
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:44,953
Verdict?

687
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,994
Like l said, not so terrible.

688
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,972
You were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership.

689
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:04,139
The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle.

690
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,312
What are their names?

691
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:08,945
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.

692
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,148
Where are they now?

693
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,986
My uncle was killed during Blitzkrieg.

694
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:15,848
Pity.

695
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,952
Continue.

696
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:21,694
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.

697
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:23,290
Regrettable.

698
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,732
lt's come to my attention you have a Negro in your employ. ls that true?

699
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:30,830
Oui.

700
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:33,801
He is a Frenchman.

701
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,337
His name is Marcel.

702
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:41,642
He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema.

703
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,854
He's the only other one who works with me.

704
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,178
Doing what?

705
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:47,514
ProJectionist.

706
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,316
ls he any good?

707
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,584
The best.

708
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,858
Actually, one could see where that might be a good trade for them.

709
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,007
Can you operate the proJectors?

710
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:06,701
Of course l can.

711
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,071
Knowing the Reich Minister as l do...

712
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:14,774
l'm quite positive...

713
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:19,347
...he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening...

714
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,552
...dependent on the prowess of a Negro.

715
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,252
So...

716
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:27,858
...if it comes to pass...

717
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,591
...we hold this event at your venue...

718
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:35,636
...talented no doubt, as your Negro may be...

719
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,098
...you will...

720
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,609
...operate the proJectors.

721
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:46,809
ls that acceptable?

722
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,474
Oui.

723
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,077
Cigarette?

724
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,315
They are not French.

725
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:57,283
They are German.

726
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,509
l did have something else l wanted to ask you.

727
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:32,618
But right now, for the life of me, l can't remember what it is.

728
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,964
Oh, well, must not have been important.

729
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,194
'Til tonight.

730
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:54,113
(GOEBBELS SPEAKlNG GERMAN) l must say, l appreciate the modesty of this cinema.

731
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,881
Your cinema has real respect, almost church like.

732
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:01,680
Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit.

733
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:06,189
Maybe l'll go to the Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and scatter them about the lobby.

734
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:10,361
So, Emmanuelle, how did you like ''Lucky Kids''?

735
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:12,925
(SHOSANNA SPEAKlNG FRENCH) l quite like Lilian Harvey.

736
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:15,904
(GOEBBELS SPEAKlNG GERMAN) Lilian Harvey!

737
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,569
Never mention that name again in my presence!

738
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:45,029
Hey... ...what the fuck are we supposed to do?

739
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:49,533
lt looks like we're supposed to have a Nazi premiere.

740
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,233
Like l said, what the fuck are we supposed to do?

741
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,741
Well, l need to talk with you about that.

742
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,878
l'm confused, what are we talking about?

743
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:07,214
Filling the cinema with Nazis and burning it down to the ground.

744
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:08,583
l'm not talking about that.

745
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,085
You are talking about that.

746
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,487
No, we're talking about that, right now.

747
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,728
lf we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves...

748

...we can burn it down by ourselves?

749
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,298
Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.

750
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,303
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection...

751
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,608
...we wouldn't even need explosives...

752
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:31,671
...would we?

753
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:34,776

Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.

-They're films, ain't they? -Yes.

...we both know, you're not going to let me do it by myself.

But that's not all we're going to do.

Does the filmmaking equipment in the attic still work?

Quite well, actually.

772
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,484
Why do we need filmmaking equipment?

773
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,397
Because Marcel, my sweet...

774
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:00,327
...we're going to make a film.

775

Whiskey. Straight. No Junk in it.

lt says here that you speak German fluently.

794
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,418
The first book was called

795
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:36,932
Art of the EyeS, the Heart and the Mind.; A Study of German Cinema in the '20S.

796
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:40,867
And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.

797
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:46,272
lt's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.

-What should we drink to, sir? -Well...

-Down with Hitler. -All the way down, sir.

Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?

802
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:09,893
Yes. Obviously, l haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years,

803
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:13,298
-but l'm familiar with it. -Explain it to me.

804
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,095
Pardon, sir?

805
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:19,508
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry

806
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:24,646
under the Third Reich. Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.

807
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,216
Goebbels considers the films he's making

808
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,515
to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.

809
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,650
An alternative to what he considers

810
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,693
the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s,

811
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,089
and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.

812
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:43,097
How's he doing?

813
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,857
Frightfully sorry, sir. Once again?

814
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:50,897
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.

815
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:54,899
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,

816
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:59,373
-how's he doing? -Quite well, actually.

817
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:06,154
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.

818
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:09,680
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.

819
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:13,559
l believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O. Selznick.

820
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,628
Brief him.

821
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:24,730
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time l'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.

822
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:26,467
Three days from now

823
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:30,876
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.

824
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:34,814
-What film, sir? -The motion picture is called Nation'S Pride.

825
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:39,152
ln attendance at this Joyous Germatic occasion

826
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:43,658
will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command

827
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:47,490
including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo,

828
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:50,997
as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.

829
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,159
The master race at play?

830
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:57,433
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.

831
01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:00,066
The obJective of Operation Kino,

832
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:02,843
blow up the basket.

833
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:07,609
And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.

834
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:10,144
Jolly good, sir.

835
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:14,445
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines

836
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,081
will be your assist.

837
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:20,026
The Germans call them the Basterds.

838
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,793
The Basterds. Never heard of them.

839
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:26,799
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.

840
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:30,862
But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.

841
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:35,672
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.

842
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,837
The Basterds will be waiting for you.

843
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,279
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.

844
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:41,748
ln Nadine,

845
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:44,615
there's a tavern called La Louisiane.

846
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:47,850
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent. She'll take it from there.

847
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,050
She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.

848
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,890
lt'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.

849
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:57,363
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.

850
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,428
How will l know her?

851
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:02,699
l suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.

852
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:08,299
-Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark. -Bridget von Hammersmark?

853
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:12,538
(CHUCKLlNG) The German movie star is working for England?

854
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,208
Yes, for the last two years now.

855
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,844
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.

856
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,219
-lndeed. -Got the gist?

857
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,019
l think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.

858
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:28,094
The village of Nadine

859
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:31,689
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.

860
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:34,600
-l didn't know. -You said it was in a tavern.

861
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,331
-lt is a tavern. -Yeah, in a basement.

862
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,874
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.

863
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:44,242
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.

864
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,211
What if we go in there and she's not even there?

865
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,045
We wait.

866
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:52,411
Don't worry. She's a British spy. She'll make the rendezvous.

867
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:17,401
-Stiglitz, right? -That's right, sir.

868
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:21,205
l hear you're pretty good with that.

869
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:28,081
You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.

870
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,917
Simply making contact with our agent. Should be uneventful.

871
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:38,597
However, the off chance l'm wrong, things prove eventful,

872
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,770
l need to know we can all remain calm.

873
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,468
l don't look calm to you?

874
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:56,751
Well, now that you put it like that, l guess you do.

875
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:17,635
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?

876
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:23,172
ls that the kind of man you need? Loquacious type?

877
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,471
Fair point, Lieutenant.

878
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,548
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?

879
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:34,816
Make bets on how it all comes out?

880
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:39,188
lf we get into trouble, we can handle it.

881
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:43,664
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure

882
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:47,862
no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.

883
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:53,035
lf Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.

884
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:59,075
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the death-trap rendezvous?

885
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:03,212
-She chose the spot. -lsn't that Just dandy?

886
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,221
Look, she's not a military strategist. She's Just an actress.

887
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:11,490
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.

888
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,585
She wasn't picking a place to fight.

889
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:16,494
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.

890
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:19,433
--So, l'm male...

891
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,662
...l'm a fictional, literary character from the past...

892
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:24,702
...l'm American, and that's controversial.

893
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,007
No, it's not controversial at all.

894
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:33,007
The nationality of the author has nothing to do with the nationality of the character.

895
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,710
The character is the character.

896
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:38,352
Hamlet is not British. He is Danish.

897
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:42,186
So yes, this character was born in America.

898
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:43,281

01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:48,767
Don't worry, pretty little thing.

Stop it!

Schnapps, schnapps, take your schnapps in hand, comrades.

01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:12,657
...we will drink.

967
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:15,829
We drink to our friend Wilhelm.

968
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:18,799
And his little boy...

969
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:20,799
...Maximilian.

01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:25,443
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) There's some new development.

972
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:27,638
The cinema venue has changed.

973
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,142
Why?

974
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:31,185
No one knows but that should not be a real problem.

975
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:34,788
The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller than The Ritz.

976
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:39,119
So whatever explosives you brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective here.

977
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,162
Now the next piece of information...

978
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:45,690
...is colossal.

979
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:47,300
Try not to overreact.

980
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:50,695
The Fuhrer-

981
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:54,669

982
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,343
...could you sign an autograph to my son on his birthday?

983
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,512
Of course. l'd love to, Wilhelm.

984
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:07,010
This handsome Staff Sergeant Just became a father today.

01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:18,655
l most certainly do, fraulein. His name is Maximilian.

989
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:20,659
Maximilian, wonderful name.

Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.

Once again-

1002
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:19,421
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) Frau Hammersmark, what brings you to France?

1003
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:22,725
None of your business!

1004
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:24,857
Staff Sergeant.

1005
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:33,439
You might not have worn out your welcome with the fraulein with your drunken boorish behavior...

1006
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:35,574
...but you have worn out your welcome with me.

1007
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:41,310
Might l remind you, Staff Sergeant, you are an enlisted man.

1008
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,245
This is an officer's table!

1009

l suggest you stop pestering the fraulein...

1010
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:51,756
...and reJoin your table.

1011
01:18:57,499 --> 01:19:02,402
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very unusual.

1012
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,598
Where are you from?

1013
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:12,841
You must be either completely drunk or mad to dare...

1014
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:15,409
...to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness!

1015
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:17,111
Staff Sergeant.

1016
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,248
l'm making you and you responsible for him.

1017
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:21,652
l suggest you take hold of your friend...

1018
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:25,853
...or he'll spend Max's first birthday in Jail for public drunkenness.

--Might l inquire?

1020

...l, too, have an acute ear for accents.

1022
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:09,694
And like him...

1023
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:12,238
...l, too, find yours odd.

1024
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:15,769
From where do you hail, Captain?

1025
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:17,402
MaJor, this is highly-

1026
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:19,707
---l wasn't speaking to you, Lieutenant Munich.

1027
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:23,676
Or you either, Lieutenant Frankfurt.

1028
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:30,286
l was speaking to Captain l-don't-know-what.

1029
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:39,190
l was born in a village that rests in the shadow of the Piz Palu.

-The mountain? -Yes.

1031
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:43,860
ln that village, we all speak like this.

1032
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,735
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

1033
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:50,708
-Yes. -Then you saw me.

1034
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:55,374
You remember the skiing torch scene?

1035
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:58,777
Yes.

1036
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:04,886
ln that scene was myself, my father, my sister and my two brothers.

1037
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:08,225
My brother is so handsome...

...the director Pabst, gave him a Close-Up.

1039

Herr MaJor, if my word means anything...

1040
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:21,073
...l can vouch for everything the young captain has Just said.

1041
01:21:22,577 --> 01:21:25,068
He does hail from the bottom of the Piz Palu.

1042
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:30,276
He was in the film and his brother is far more handsome than he.

1043
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:42,286
You should reJoin your friends.

Wunderbar!

1047

1055
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:24,363
Worth knowing.

1056

...write the name of a famous person on your card.

01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:10,126
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask whether you're real or fictitious.

1121
01:26:10,732 --> 01:26:13,223
l, however, think that's too easy, so l won't ask that yet.

1122
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:14,926
Okay...

1123
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:17,266
...my native land is the Jungle...

1124
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:19,566
...l visited America...

1125
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:22,266
...but my visit was not fortuitous to me...

1126
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:26,738
...but the implication is that it was to somebody else.

1127
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,944
When l went...

1128
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:36,587
...from the Jungle to America...

1129
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:40,751
...did l go by boat?

-Yes. -Yes.

1131

-Yes. -Yes.

1133
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:52,164
On this boat ride, was l in chains?

1134
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:53,497
Yes.

1135
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:56,206
When l arrived in America, was l displayed in chains?

1136
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:57,335
-Yes. -Yes.

1137
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:58,936
Am l the story of the Negro in America?

1138

(HlCOX SPEAKlNG GERMAN) -No.

1139
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:02,010
Well then l must be King Kong.

1140
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:05,710

Cheers.

Now, who is next?

1145
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:21,859
Well, MaJor...

1146
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:29,101
...l don't mean to be rude. But the four of us are very good friends.

1147

And we haven't seen each other in quite a while.

1148
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:36,107
So, MaJor...

1149
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:37,344
...l am afraid...

1150
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,588
...you are intruding.

1151
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:43,780
l beg to differ, Captain.

1152
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:50,520
lt's only if the fraulein considers my presence an intrusion...

1153
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:53,030
...that l become an intruder.

1154
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:00,202

l didn't think so.

1157
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:07,971
lt's simply the captain is immune to my charms.

1158
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:24,395
l am Just Joking.

1159

Just Joking. Of course l'm intruding.

You're most gracious, MaJor.

1165
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:46,082
Eric! The thirty-three. And new glasses!

1166
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:49,748
You don't want to contaminate the thirty-three with the swill you were drinking.

1167
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:50,848
How many glasses?

1168

Did you hear that?

1178
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:04,894
That was the sound of my Walther.

1179
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,363
Pointed right at your testicles.

1180

Why do you have your Walther pointed at my testicles?

1181
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:17,709
Because you've Just given yourself away, Captain.

You're no more German than that scotch.

l was saying that makes two of us.

1186
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:47,099
l've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.

1187
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:51,035
That makes three of us.

And at this range, l'm a real Fredrick Zoller.

...the two of us aren't going anywhere.

Too bad about Sergeant Wilhelm and his famous friends.

Well, if this is it, old boy,

1202
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:51,661
l hope you don't mind if l go out speaking the King's.

1203
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:54,707
By all means, Captain.

1204
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:04,376
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.

1205
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,653
Seeing as l may be rapping on the door momentarily,

-Stiglitz. -Say auf wiederSehen to your Nazi balls.

01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:26,556
l'm a German, you idiot.

1218

Five hours ago.

His name is Max. We were in here drinking, celebrating.

1226
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:53,325
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing. lt's not my fault!

1227
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:55,486
ALDO: Okay! lt wasn't your fault.

1228
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,729
What's your name, soldier?

1229

-No. -l'm alive!

1233
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,841
ls the girl on your side?

1234
01:34:16,217 --> 01:34:17,479
ALDO: Which girl?

1235
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:19,985
Who do you think? Von Hammersmark.

1236
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:23,523
ALDO: Yeah, she's ours.

1237
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:25,788
ALDO: ls she okay?

1238
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:29,922
ALDO: Wilhelm!

1239
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:32,293
She's been shot.

1240
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,100
But she's alive.

1241
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:40,469
ALDO: Okay, Wilhelm.

1242
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:43,608
What do you say we make us a deal?

1243
01:34:44,945 --> 01:34:46,378
What's your name?

1244
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:48,005
Aldo.

1245
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,611
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.

1246
01:34:50,918 --> 01:34:54,547
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.

1247
01:34:54,622 --> 01:34:57,182
No guns. No guns me, no guns you.

1248
01:34:57,258 --> 01:35:00,785
And we take the girl and leave. lt's that simple, Willi.

1249
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:03,619
You go your way, we go ours.

1250
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:06,598
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.

1251
01:35:07,768 --> 01:35:10,635
So what do you say, Willi? We got us a deal?

1252
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:16,634
Aldo.

1253
01:35:17,445 --> 01:35:19,413
ALDO: l'm here, Willi.

1254
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:22,479
l want to trust you.

1255
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,177
But...

1256
01:35:24,618 --> 01:35:26,586
But how can l?

1257
01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:30,313
ALDO: What choice you got, son?

1258
01:35:36,163 --> 01:35:38,222
Okay, okay.

1259
01:35:39,834 --> 01:35:41,392
Aldo,

1260
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:43,866
l'm going to trust you.

1261
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:46,299
Come down.

1262
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:04,581
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun? l thought we had us a deal?

1263
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:06,922
We still have a deal. Now, get the girl and go.

1264
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:08,552
Not so fast.

1265
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:11,189
We only got a deal, we trust each other.

1266
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:13,323
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.

1267
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:15,992
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.

1268
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:19,798
You got guns on us. You decide to shoot, we're dead.

1269
01:36:19,874 --> 01:36:23,173
Up top, they got grenades. They drop them down here, you're dead.

1270
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:25,643
That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.

1271
01:36:25,713 --> 01:36:27,738
No trust, no deal.

1272
01:36:43,297 --> 01:36:45,060
All right, Aldo.

1273
01:36:46,534 --> 01:36:48,092
Fine.

1274
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:54,474
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.

1275
01:37:06,554 --> 01:37:09,990
Not so goddamn fast, doc. Tell him to go play with his dogs.

1276
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:26,071
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.

1277
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:27,936
Few questions about what?

1278
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:30,637
About l got three men dead back there.

1279
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:33,509
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?

1280
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:37,517
The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo maJor saw it.

1281
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:40,849
Before we get into who shot John,

1282
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:45,853
why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?

1283
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:53,199
l can see since you didn't see what happened inside,

1284
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:55,929
that the Nazis being there must look odd.

1285
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:58,527
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.

1286
01:37:58,606 --> 01:38:00,597
lt's called suspicious.

1287
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:06,710
Everybody needs to calm down.

1288
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:09,442
You're letting your imagination get the better of you.

1289
01:38:10,818 --> 01:38:13,787
You met the sergeant yourself. Willi.

1290
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,719
You remember him, don't you?

1291
01:38:15,789 --> 01:38:16,847
Yeah, l remember him.

1292
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:20,621
His wife had a baby tonight. He had Just become a...

1293
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:22,423
He had Just become a father!

1294
01:38:22,496 --> 01:38:26,330
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.

1295
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:35,972
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.

1296
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:38,044
lt couldn't be both.

1297
01:38:48,022 --> 01:38:49,922
How'd the shooting start?

1298
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:52,481
The Englishman gave himself away.

1299
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:54,288
How'd he do that?

1300
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:57,659
He ordered three glasses.

1301
01:38:58,866 --> 01:39:00,766
We order three glasses.

1302
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:02,936
That's the German three.

1303
01:39:03,837 --> 01:39:05,998
The other looks odd.

1304
01:39:06,206 --> 01:39:08,538
Germans would and did notice it.

1305
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:19,278
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans

1306
01:39:19,353 --> 01:39:21,947
and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.

1307
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:23,956
What was the next step?

1308
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:25,785
Tuxedos.

1309
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,824
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms

1310
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:31,694
with all the military there would've been suicide.

1311
01:39:33,667 --> 01:39:36,966
But going as members of the German film industry,

1312
01:39:37,371 --> 01:39:40,534
they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.

1313
01:39:42,009 --> 01:39:45,206
l arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.

1314
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:48,847
How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?

1315
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:50,884
Hand me my purse.

1316
01:40:00,427 --> 01:40:02,827
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.

1317
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:08,157
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.

1318
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:10,997
You still get us in that premiere?

1319
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:14,199
You speak German better than your friends? No.

1320
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,836
Have l been shot? Yes!

1321
01:40:17,378 --> 01:40:22,213
l don't see me tripping the light fantaStique up a red carpet anytime soon.

1322
01:40:23,217 --> 01:40:25,685
Least of all, by tomorrow night.

1323
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:41,865
However, there's something you don't know.

1324
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:48,033
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.

1325
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:54,873
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.

1326
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:58,613
Enormous change at the last minute? That's not very Germatic.

1327
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:01,654
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?

1328
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:05,452
lt probably has something to do with the second development.

1329
01:41:05,826 --> 01:41:07,521
Which is?

1330
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:13,992
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.

1331
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:15,996
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) l've been rethinking my position...

1332
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:24,337
...in regards to your Paris premiere of ''Nation's Pride.''

1333
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:27,744
As the weeks have gone on...

1334
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,244
...and the Americans are on the beach...

1335
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:35,244
...l do find myself thinking more and more...

1336
01:41:36,023 --> 01:41:37,354
...about this Private Zoller.

1337
01:41:38,692 --> 01:41:40,819
This boy has done something tremendous for us.

1338
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:43,856
And l'm beginning to think...

1339
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:48,091
...my participation in this event could be meaningful.

1340
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:50,361
Fuck a duck!

1341
01:41:59,012 --> 01:42:00,877
What are you thinking?

1342
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:04,344
l'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf

1343
01:42:04,418 --> 01:42:06,318
makes this horse a different color.

1344
01:42:06,386 --> 01:42:08,047
What is that supposed to mean?

1345
01:42:08,155 --> 01:42:10,089
lt means you getting us in that premiere.

1346
01:42:10,157 --> 01:42:13,058
l'm probably going to end up losing this leg.

1347
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:16,060
Bye-bye, acting career. Fun while it lasted.

1348
01:42:16,163 --> 01:42:19,030
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?

1349
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:24,227
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.

1350
01:42:24,304 --> 01:42:26,363
He's going to wrap it up in a cast,

1351
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:28,567
and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg-mountain-climbing story.

1352
01:42:28,642 --> 01:42:31,304
That's German, ain't it? You all like climbing mountains, don't you?

1353
01:42:31,411 --> 01:42:34,642
l don't. l like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.

1354
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:36,749
But l see your point.

1355
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:40,309
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears

1356
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:43,651
and Just limp your little ass up that rouge carpet.

1357
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:48,458
l know this is a silly question before l ask it,

1358
01:42:48,562 --> 01:42:53,932
but can you Americans speak any other language than English?

1359
01:42:54,768 --> 01:42:56,998
We both speak a little ltalian.

1360
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:59,595
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.

1361
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:04,799
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.

1362
01:43:05,612 --> 01:43:08,445
Germans don't have a good ear for ltalian.

1363
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:16,153
So you mumble ltalian and brazen through it. ls that the plan?

1364
01:43:16,423 --> 01:43:18,391
That's about it.

1365
01:43:21,828 --> 01:43:22,886
That sounds good.

1366
01:43:22,963 --> 01:43:25,363
lt sounds like shit. What else are we going to do? Go home?

1367
01:43:25,432 --> 01:43:27,400
No, that sounds good.

1368
01:43:28,101 --> 01:43:32,003
lf you don't blow it, with that, l can get you in the building.

1369
01:43:33,006 --> 01:43:34,064
Who does what?

1370
01:43:34,141 --> 01:43:38,305
Well, l speak the most ltalian, so l'll be your escort.

1371
01:43:38,412 --> 01:43:41,506
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your ltalian cameraman.

1372
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:44,584
Omar, third most. He'll be Donny's assistant.

1373
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,278
l don't speak ltalian.

1374
01:43:46,353 --> 01:43:49,754
Like l said, third best. Just keep your fucking mouth shut.

1375
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:51,313
ln fact, why don't you start practicing right now?

1376
01:43:58,999 --> 01:44:00,864
You've moved up in the world.

1377
01:44:03,036 --> 01:44:05,027
Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.

1378
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:10,333
And with your record of insubordination. Truly remarkable.

1379
01:44:15,849 --> 01:44:16,907
And that one's name is...

1380
01:44:16,984 --> 01:44:18,747
...Wilhelm Wicki.

1381
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:21,720
He's an Austrian-born Jew, who immigrated to the United States...

1382
01:44:21,955 --> 01:44:24,856
...when things began turning sour for the lsraelites.

1383
01:44:24,992 --> 01:44:27,722
They are the two German-born members of the Basterds.

1384
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:32,196
They've been known to don German uniforms, to ambush squads.

1387

1400
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:29,100
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage.

1401
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:31,934
And suppose someone would develop the footage...

...at mountain climbing.

And this is the result.

01:51:49,269 --> 01:51:50,293
Mountain climbing?

That's how you inJured your leg -mountain climbing?

1439

01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:29,704
l'm curious, fraulein, what could have ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor?

1443

Well, l shan't be doing it again, l can tell you that.

1591
02:06:21,674 --> 02:06:25,235
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.

1592
02:06:26,045 --> 02:06:29,481
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.

1593
02:06:29,548 --> 02:06:32,813
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot,

1594
02:06:32,885 --> 02:06:35,410
as of this moment, is still a go.

1595
02:06:35,521 --> 02:06:38,820
That's a pretty exciting story. What's next? Eliza on Ice?

1596
02:06:38,891 --> 02:06:40,449
However,

1597
02:06:42,027 --> 02:06:48,057
all l have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.

1598
02:06:50,436 --> 02:06:55,669
lf they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if,

1599
02:06:57,009 --> 02:07:00,501
there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.

1600
02:07:00,579 --> 02:07:02,342
l have no doubt.

1601
02:07:02,414 --> 02:07:05,747
And, yes, some Germans will die. Yes, it will ruin the evening.

1602
02:07:05,851 --> 02:07:08,718
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you

1603
02:07:08,787 --> 02:07:10,880
for what you've done to his big night.

1604
02:07:12,124 --> 02:07:14,422
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels,

1605
02:07:14,526 --> 02:07:17,552
you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.

1606
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:20,224
And you need all four to end the war.

1607
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:25,097
But if l don't pick up this phone right here,

1608
02:07:25,204 --> 02:07:27,434
you may very well get all four.

1609
02:07:28,741 --> 02:07:33,576
And if you get all four, you end the war

1610
02:07:34,813 --> 02:07:36,371
tonight.

1611
02:07:37,449 --> 02:07:39,144
So, gentlemen,

1612
02:07:39,718 --> 02:07:42,915
let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.

1613
02:07:45,791 --> 02:07:47,656
So, the way l see it,

1614
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:51,958
since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction,

1615
02:07:52,631 --> 02:07:54,565
if l do nothing,

1616
02:07:54,633 --> 02:07:58,660
it's as if l'm causing his death even more than yourselves. Wouldn't you agree?

1617
02:07:59,304 --> 02:08:00,999
l guess so.

1618
02:08:03,275 --> 02:08:05,300
How about you, Utivich?

1619
02:08:05,411 --> 02:08:07,106
l guess so, too.

1620
02:08:12,484 --> 02:08:16,944
Gentlemen, l have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann,

1621
02:08:17,022 --> 02:08:19,786
not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies,

1622
02:08:19,858 --> 02:08:23,555
only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.

1623
02:08:25,664 --> 02:08:29,191
lf you want to win the war tonight,

1624
02:08:30,836 --> 02:08:32,997
we have to make a deal.

1625
02:08:36,008 --> 02:08:37,771
What kind of deal?

1626
02:08:37,843 --> 02:08:40,368
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.

1627
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:45,007
However, l'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.

1628
02:08:46,018 --> 02:08:47,713
A general.

1629
02:08:48,020 --> 02:08:49,681
l'm betting for...

1630
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:53,551
OSS would be my guess.

1631
02:08:57,229 --> 02:08:59,697
That's a bingo!

1632
02:09:02,701 --> 02:09:05,192
ls that the way you say it? ''That's a bingo.''

1633
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:07,204
You Just say, ''Bingo.''

1634
02:09:07,272 --> 02:09:09,502
Bingo! How fun.

1635
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:15,004
But l digress. Where were we? Yeah! Make a deal.

1636
02:09:15,547 --> 02:09:20,007
Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it

1637
02:09:20,085 --> 02:09:24,215
is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.

1638
02:09:24,556 --> 02:09:26,888
Get me someone on the other end of that radio

1639
02:09:26,959 --> 02:09:30,053
with the power of the pen to authorize my,

1640
02:09:30,129 --> 02:09:33,064
let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.

1641
02:09:33,132 --> 02:09:35,532
lf that tastes better going down.

1642
02:09:36,301 --> 02:09:37,563
You know, where l'm from...

1643
02:09:37,636 --> 02:09:39,570
Yeah? Where is that exactly?

1644
02:09:39,638 --> 02:09:41,697
Maynardville, Tennessee.

1645
02:09:41,774 --> 02:09:44,208
l've done my share of bootlegging.

1646
02:09:44,409 --> 02:09:48,072
Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity,

1647
02:09:48,147 --> 02:09:50,274
but what we call Just a man trying to make a living for his family

1648
02:09:50,382 --> 02:09:54,785
selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.

1649
02:09:56,755 --> 02:10:00,156
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true,

1650
02:10:00,826 --> 02:10:02,589
it ain't.

1651
02:10:03,929 --> 02:10:06,727
Sitting in your chair, l would probably say the same thing,

1652
02:10:06,799 --> 02:10:11,463
and 999.999 times out of a million, you would be correct.

1653
02:10:13,472 --> 02:10:17,067
But in the pages of history, every once in a while,

1654
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:21,010
fate reaches out and extends its hand.

1655
02:10:27,853 --> 02:10:29,821
What shall the history books read?

1656
02:10:56,682 --> 02:10:59,879
MAN.; I implore you. we muSt deStroy that tower.

1657
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:02,947
Sarge, that tower...

1658
02:11:22,507 --> 02:11:24,475
MAN.; The tower StandS!

1659
02:11:26,678 --> 02:11:28,373
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) Gum?

1660
02:12:14,893 --> 02:12:16,588
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) lt's time.

1661
02:12:17,763 --> 02:12:20,561
l should go lock the auditorium and take my place behind the screen.

1662
02:14:04,136 --> 02:14:06,331
HANS: So when the military history of this night is written,

1663
02:14:06,438 --> 02:14:10,135
it will be recorded that l was part of Operation Kino

1664
02:14:10,208 --> 02:14:12,972
from the very beginning as a double agent.

1665
02:14:13,045 --> 02:14:17,106
Anything l've done in my guise as an SS Colonel

1666
02:14:17,182 --> 02:14:20,208
was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil

1667
02:14:20,318 --> 02:14:22,980
to establish my cover with the Germans.

1668
02:14:23,221 --> 02:14:26,520
And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite

1669
02:14:26,625 --> 02:14:29,594
in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.

1670
02:14:30,595 --> 02:14:33,257
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) l informed the Fuhrer that the audience has taken their seats.

1671
02:14:33,365 --> 02:14:35,333
He should arrive any minute.

1672
02:14:36,168 --> 02:14:38,068
Thank you, Hans.

1673
02:14:46,711 --> 02:14:49,737
By the way, that last part is actually true.

1674
02:14:49,848 --> 02:14:54,751
l want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.

1675
02:14:55,087 --> 02:14:57,521
l want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor

1676
02:14:57,589 --> 02:15:01,548
for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.

1677
02:15:02,961 --> 02:15:06,055
ln fact, l want all the members of Operation Kino

1678
02:15:06,131 --> 02:15:09,066
to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1679
02:15:09,468 --> 02:15:13,199
Full citizenship for myself. Well, that goes without saying.

1680
02:15:13,472 --> 02:15:16,737
And l would like the United States of America

1681
02:15:16,808 --> 02:15:20,869
to purchase property for me on Nantucket lsland

1682
02:15:20,946 --> 02:15:24,245
as a reward for all the countless lives l've saved

1683
02:15:24,316 --> 02:15:26,614
by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party

1684
02:15:26,718 --> 02:15:30,313
to a swifter-than-imagined end. Do you have all that, sir?

1685
02:15:32,090 --> 02:15:35,582
l look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.

1686
02:15:36,461 --> 02:15:38,656
Lieutenant Raine? Right here.

1687
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:43,094
Yes, sir.

1688
02:15:43,168 --> 02:15:46,934
GENERAL.; Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck aS priSonerS.

1689
02:15:47,005 --> 02:15:51,408
Then he and hiS radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lineS.

1690
02:15:51,476 --> 02:15:56,072
Upon croSSing our lineS, Colonel Landa and hiS man will Surrender to you.

1691
02:15:56,148 --> 02:15:58,673
You will then take over driving of the truck

1692
02:15:58,783 --> 02:16:02,150
and bring them Straight to me for debriefing. IS that clear, Lieutenant?

1693
02:16:02,254 --> 02:16:03,380
Yes, sir.

1694
02:16:03,455 --> 02:16:05,150
Over and out.

1695
02:16:29,381 --> 02:16:32,714
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) Herr Dr. Goebbels, excuse me. Could l go out for a moment?

1696
02:16:33,652 --> 02:16:37,019
Perfectly understandable, my boy. You go now, and we'll see you after the show.

1697
02:17:44,556 --> 02:17:45,853
(SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Who is it?

1698
02:17:45,924 --> 02:17:47,687
Fredrick!

1699
02:17:48,426 --> 02:17:49,984
Shit.

1700
02:17:54,032 --> 02:17:56,330
Are you the manager of this cinema? l want my money back.

1701
02:17:56,701 --> 02:17:58,669
That actor in the movie stinks.

1702
02:18:00,538 --> 02:18:01,800
What are you doing here?

1703
02:18:01,873 --> 02:18:03,636
l came to visit you.

1704
02:18:04,276 --> 02:18:05,538
Can't you see how busy l am?

1705
02:18:05,610 --> 02:18:07,510
Then allow me to lend an assist.

1706
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:10,541
Fredrick, it's not funny, you can't be here.

1707
02:18:11,216 --> 02:18:13,480
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them.

1708
02:18:16,621 --> 02:18:18,646
Normally, you would be right.

1709
02:18:18,890 --> 02:18:20,824
And for all the other films l do...

1710
02:18:20,892 --> 02:18:23,759
...l intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper spirit.

1711
02:18:25,930 --> 02:18:27,898
However, the fact remains...

1712
02:18:28,233 --> 02:18:30,531
...this film is based on my military exploits.

1713
02:18:30,969 --> 02:18:34,598
And in this case, my exploits consisted of killing many men.

1714
02:18:36,074 --> 02:18:38,235
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now...

1715
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:42,480
...l don't like watching this part.

1716
02:18:43,748 --> 02:18:45,841
-l am sorry, Fredrick, but... -So, l thought...

1717
02:18:45,917 --> 02:18:48,147
...l'd come up here and do what l do best...

1718
02:18:48,486 --> 02:18:50,181
...annoy you.

1719
02:18:50,588 --> 02:18:53,580
And from the look on your face, it would appear l haven't lost my touch.

1720
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:57,251
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass...

1721
02:18:57,329 --> 02:18:59,354
...you've forgotten what the word ''no'' means?

1722
02:18:59,431 --> 02:19:01,365
No...you can't be here!

1723
02:19:01,533 --> 02:19:03,091
Now go away!

1724
02:19:05,537 --> 02:19:06,868
Fredrick, you hurt me.

1725
02:19:06,938 --> 02:19:11,272
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.

1726
02:19:12,110 --> 02:19:14,135
Even if it's Just physical pain.

1727
02:19:14,612 --> 02:19:16,842
l'm not a man you say, ''go away'' to.

1728
02:19:17,549 --> 02:19:21,715
There's over three hundred dead bodies in ltaly, that if they could, would testify to that!

1729
02:19:24,356 --> 02:19:25,823
After what l've done for you...

1730
02:19:25,890 --> 02:19:27,949
...you disrespect me at your peril!

1731
02:19:28,293 --> 02:19:29,817
Lock the door.

1732
02:19:29,894 --> 02:19:31,521
What?

1733
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:33,288
Lock the door.

1734
02:19:33,365 --> 02:19:35,265
We don't have much time.

1735
02:19:37,635 --> 02:19:39,330
Time for what? (SlGHS)

1736
02:19:39,637 --> 02:19:40,899
Forget it!

1737
02:19:40,972 --> 02:19:42,872
--No, no, no...wait.

1738
02:19:43,808 --> 02:19:45,833
You want me to...lock the door?

1739
02:19:46,478 --> 02:19:48,503
For the fifty-seventh time, yes.

1740
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:51,660
When l kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.

1741
02:21:51,769 --> 02:21:54,260
-Can you do it? -l have to.

02:22:49,494 --> 02:22:51,655
This is your finest film yet.

1745
02:22:52,797 --> 02:22:54,765
Thank you, my Fuhrer.

1746
02:22:56,301 --> 02:22:57,928
Thank you.

1747
02:23:17,155 --> 02:23:19,817
who wantS to Send a meSSage to Germany?

1748
02:23:20,658 --> 02:23:22,990
I have a meSSage for Germany.

1749
02:23:26,497 --> 02:23:28,692
That you are all going to die.

1750
02:23:29,734 --> 02:23:31,099
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) Enough! Stop it!

1751
02:23:31,169 --> 02:23:32,431
Turn off the proJector!

1752
02:23:32,503 --> 02:23:37,873
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who'S going to do it!

1753
02:23:38,009 --> 02:23:39,943
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) l don't know what's going on. That does not belong in my movie!

1754
02:23:40,011 --> 02:23:43,037
Marcel, burn it down.

1755
02:23:44,048 --> 02:23:45,811
Oui, Shosanna.

1756
02:24:21,052 --> 02:24:23,145
My name iS ShoSanna DreyfuS,

1757
02:24:23,554 --> 02:24:25,181
and thiS iS the face

1758
02:24:27,058 --> 02:24:29,390
of JewiSh vengeance.

1759
02:26:25,409 --> 02:26:27,877
(SPEAKlNG GERMAN) These are the American lines, Colonel sir.

1760
02:26:29,013 --> 02:26:30,913
Excellent, Hermann.

1761
02:26:35,052 --> 02:26:37,020
HANS: Hermann, uncuff them.

1762
02:26:55,473 --> 02:26:59,466
l'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.

1763
02:27:00,611 --> 02:27:02,579
We're your prisoners.

1764
02:27:03,247 --> 02:27:05,147
How about my knife?

1765
02:27:10,922 --> 02:27:12,913
Thank you very much, Colonel.

1766
02:27:12,990 --> 02:27:16,050
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.

1767
02:27:16,127 --> 02:27:18,322
ls that really necessary?

1768
02:27:18,429 --> 02:27:20,488
l'm a slave to appearances.

1769
02:27:23,668 --> 02:27:25,568
Scalp Hermann.

1770
02:27:26,838 --> 02:27:28,601
Are you mad?

1771
02:27:28,906 --> 02:27:30,806
What have you done?

1772
02:27:31,175 --> 02:27:34,474
l made a deal with your general for that man's life!

1773
02:27:35,580 --> 02:27:38,981
Yeah, they made that deal. But they don't give a fuck about him. They need you.

1774
02:27:39,083 --> 02:27:41,017
You'll be shot for this!

1775
02:27:41,652 --> 02:27:45,179
Nah, l don't think so. More like chewed out. l've been chewed out before.

1776
02:27:46,490 --> 02:27:50,688
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.

1777
02:27:51,128 --> 02:27:53,096
End the war tonight?

1778
02:27:54,298 --> 02:27:55,890
l'd make that deal.

1779
02:27:55,967 --> 02:27:57,867
How about you, Utivich? You make that deal?

1780
02:27:57,935 --> 02:28:01,427
-l'd make that deal. -l don't blame you. Damn good deal.

1781
02:28:02,206 --> 02:28:05,334
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.

1782
02:28:05,443 --> 02:28:08,810
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,

1783
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:11,872
l suppose that's worth certain considerations.

1784
02:28:12,617 --> 02:28:14,710
But l do have one question.

1785
02:28:15,786 --> 02:28:18,550
When you get to your little place on Nantucket lsland,

1786
02:28:18,656 --> 02:28:23,184
l imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.

1787
02:28:23,294 --> 02:28:24,921
Ain't you?

1788
02:28:28,566 --> 02:28:30,397
That's what l thought.

1789
02:28:31,168 --> 02:28:33,136
Now, that l can't abide.

1790
02:28:34,472 --> 02:28:36,736
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?

1791
02:28:36,841 --> 02:28:38,706
Not one damn bit, sir.

1792
02:28:40,344 --> 02:28:42,403
l mean, if l had my way,

1793
02:28:42,914 --> 02:28:47,374
you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.

1794
02:28:48,886 --> 02:28:49,944
But l'm aware that ain't practical.

1795
02:28:50,021 --> 02:28:53,047
l mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.

1796
02:28:53,157 --> 02:28:54,784
So,

1797
02:28:55,192 --> 02:28:58,923
l'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.

1798
02:29:23,821 --> 02:29:25,982
You know something, Utivich?

1799
02:29:26,324 --> 02:29:29,088
l think this Just might be my masterpiece.
