1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:13,850


2
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:42,093
Klytus, I'm bored.

3
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,050
What plaything
can you offer me today?

4
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:53,425
An obscure body in the SK system.
The inhabitants call it Earth.

5
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,259
How peaceful it looks.

6
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:06,407
EARTHQUAKE

7
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:13,364
Most effective, Your Majesty.
Will you destroy this Earth?

8
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:20,984
Later. I like to play with things...
before annihilation.

9
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:37,117
MAIN TITLE

10
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:48,748
HOT HAIL

11
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:38,397
Green Mountain Airways 123
requesting instructions.

12
00:05:38,782 --> 00:05:45,080
I hope Flash Gordon's had
a great vacation after last season.

13
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:58,993
- Any problem, fellas?
- Just turbulence. Nothing serious.

14
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:02,991
Nothing you'd want to toss
a third-down pass through either.

15
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:08,912
Would you like to autograph this
for my kid, Mr. Gordon?

16
00:06:10,823 --> 00:06:14,702
- Call Boston approach.
- It may be smoother higher up.

17
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:19,481
Do us a favor and leave them alone.
They're busy driving the bus.

18
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:23,476
It's just a little turbulence.

19
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:27,474
- My name's Flash.
- I know.

20
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:31,551
I'm sorry if I seemed rude.
I'm just a little scared.

21
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:35,976
It's kind of nice.
A travel agent who's scared in planes.

22
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:40,878
I asked the Maître D' who you were.

23
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:47,192
- Talk to me. Get my mind off this.
- I couldn't believe you were alone.

24
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:50,315
- You're just saying that.
- No, I mean it.

25
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:55,544
- What were you doing there, alone?
- Trying to get my head together.

26
00:06:55,987 --> 00:07:00,864
- By myself, you know?
- I sure do.

27
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:03,996
It's okay.
Honestly, it's nothing.

28
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:07,036
- Famous last words.
- I take flying lessons.

29
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:12,303
Sometimes air rises above clouds
and you get a...

30
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:16,858
What's the matter?

31
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,499
What's happening, Flash?

32
00:07:56,951 --> 00:08:01,636
Dr. Zarkov! There's no sun.
It's 8:24 in the morning.

33
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:05,067
- No sun?
- No.

34
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:08,773
Check the angular vector
of the moon.

35
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:13,798
There seems to be no reason
for these intergalactic upsets.

36
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:19,187
Only Dr. Hans Zarkov, formerly
of NASA, provided an explanation.

37
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:24,164
His ideas, however,
have been rejected as irrational.

38
00:08:24,594 --> 00:08:30,162
According to NASA, today's
solar eclipse is no cause for alarm.

39
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:36,931
A team of scientists has been
in conference with the President.

40
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:40,435
What do you find?
The moon out of orbit?

41
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:44,674
By more than twelve degrees.
It must be a mistake.

42
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:50,606
That's no mistake.
It's an attack.

43
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:56,656
I've been right all these years.

44
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:10,470
Fragments of moon rock. Our moon
is subjected to some enormous force.

45
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:16,756
A kind of energy beam.

46
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:21,040
Time to go, Munson.
I've got the coordinates -

47
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:24,050
- the direction it's coming from.

48
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,203
This is what we've been waiting for.

49
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,784
We'll go up and counter-attack.

50
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,194
You're crazy.
I'm not going up in that.

51
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:40,632
- I can't handle the capsule alone.
- You'd better try.

52
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:45,687
- Get your toothbrush and whatever.
- Right, chief.

53
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:52,035
Munson!
Why are you running away?

54
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:54,895
All the frequencies are dead.

55
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,578
- Get a look at the V.O.R.
- Holy cow!

56
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:05,339
John, ten o'clock!

57
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:13,003
I'll put this baby down right here.

58
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:23,591
What the hell?

59
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:31,479
- My God, where are the pilots?
- Help me pull her up.

60
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:41,578
Are we coming up?
I can't see.

61
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:44,574
Me neither. Look for landing lights.

62
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:49,801
- This isn't my scene. Look where?
- Hit the switches over there.

63
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:54,431
Did your flying lessons
get as far as landing?

64
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:58,225
I was afraid you'd ask that. No.

65
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:03,022
Hang on, here we go.

66
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:14,754
Munson!

67
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:18,467
I swear, Munson, I'll shoot!

68
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:21,651
Get shot, go up,
what's the difference?

69
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:25,043
You'll give your life to save Earth.

70
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:30,747
- Haven't you any spirit at all?
- No!

71
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,646
- Dr. Zarkov, listen!
- You're back.

72
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:55,459
- Dale, you all right?
- I'm terrific.

73
00:11:55,849 --> 00:12:01,340
Let's get out of here
before she blows.

74
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,300
Hold me for a second, then drop me,
I'll kiss the ground.

75
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:21,991
- You sure you're okay?
- Fine. But no more flying.

76
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:28,314
- Good morning! Are you injured?
- It seems not.

77
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:32,652
A miracle.
I expect you'd like to use my phone?

78
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:38,046
- I would.
- I'm sure the insurance...

79
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:42,410
- Please, don't mention it.
- What happened to the sun?

80
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:47,691
- Looks like an eclipse.
- There was nothing about it on TV.

81
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:52,665
The phone is right in there.

82
00:12:58,135 --> 00:13:01,668
Sorry, Munson.
Missed your opportunity.

83
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:06,779
- Where's the telephone?
- I'm sure that's Dr. Zarkov.

84
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:09,597
He's a crazy scientist I saw on TV.

85
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:14,275
He kept talking about an attack.
They kicked him out of NASA...

86
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:17,039
- Dr. Zarkov.
- Enough!

87
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:20,027
- Are you crazy?
- Unfortunately not.

88
00:13:20,377 --> 00:13:26,252
The attack has begun. We have eleven
days before the moon crashes down.

89
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:31,000
- I need aid in taking off.
- Taking off where?

90
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:36,411
Up there. I need one person
to keep a foot on that red pedal -

91
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:42,274
- During blast-off.
You're the lighter. Sit down.

92
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:48,230
You may leave. Tell the world
what Hans Zarkov has done.

93
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,153
I guess I'll be running along now.
You lunatic!

94
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:01,871
Flash, the doors!

95
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:30,432
Sit down! Keep a foot on the pedal,
or the G-forces will kill us all.

96
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:34,126
My God, we're moving.

97
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:40,678
For God's sake,
strap yourselves down! Quick!

98
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:03,447
The red pedal!

99
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:11,354
Friendship.
Built this to send in friendship...

100
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:14,873
The end, now...

101
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:22,637
Unless we three can...
Unless we can...

102
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:33,258
Strange object
in the imperial vortex.

103
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:37,397
What distance?

104
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:43,167
Parallel to star field Zygma 12,
approaching.

105
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:52,778
- Test object for life waves.
- Positive, form unknown.

106
00:16:53,193 --> 00:16:56,802
Approximate Mong Scale 3.

107
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:05,100
Object entering our control range,
approaching the Sea of Fire.

108
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:10,353
Bring it through safely. Land it.

109
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,860
Wake up, Dale. We're okay.

110
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:57,539
It's me, Flash. Remember?
We're on the ground.

111
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:02,913
- Back home?
- I don't think so.

112
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:20,030
Hello. We're from Earth. Friends.

113
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,434
Whoever they are,
it's clear they are highly developed.

114
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:41,332
- I'm sure we can reason with them.
- Want to bet on it?

115
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:50,925
- My God!
- Is this a Civic Reception?

116
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:55,163
- More like a police state.
- That could be our good luck.

117
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:58,097
It means we'll find allies everywhere.

118
00:18:58,443 --> 00:19:02,398
They're just waiting for someone
to lead them in revolt.

119
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:09,409
- Are you looking at me, Zarkov?
- Please. I just want to get home.

120
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:16,772
Guards, halt.
Prisoners, follow me.

121
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:33,797
Halt, Lizard Man!
Escape is impossible. Surrender.

122
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:40,334
Prisoners, march below me
to Emperor Ming.

123
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:44,759
Let's not argue. Here, hold my hand.

124
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:50,160
- You want to reason with that?
- If it fails, I still have the gun.

125
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:54,678
Don't worry. I'll make it plain
I'm acting on my own.

126
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:58,582
- It's plain suicide.
- It's a rational transaction.

127
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:03,193
- One life for billions.
- Halt!

128
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:13,932
Proceed.

129
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:10,493
Hail Ming, hail!
Ruler of the universe!

130
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:15,542
Hail, Ming! Emperor of the galaxy!

131
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:21,082
The tributes of the Hawkmen
will be first.

132
00:21:22,095 --> 00:21:24,974
- Are we dreaming?
- I'd like to think so.

133
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:30,442
The fabled Ice Jewel of Frigia.

134
00:21:30,896 --> 00:21:35,811
- We seized it in battle.
- Stop!

135
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:41,969
The Ice Jewel is our tribute,
not Vultan's.

136
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:46,334
Vultan stole it
while we were burying our dead.

137
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:51,345
- You are a thief.
- What?

138
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:57,125
Let down your weapons!

139
00:21:57,577 --> 00:22:01,455
No one, but no one,
dies in the palace -

140
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:06,734
- Without a command
from the Emperor.

141
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:15,292
Hail Ming.

142
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:23,654
You obey...
Or you sacrifice your daughter.

143
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:34,184
Hail Ming.

144
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,294
Now the tributes from Ardentia.

145
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,695
Your Majesty,
we, the people of Ardentia. -

146
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:49,173
- Have suffered
since you blasted our kingdom.

147
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:53,150
I can offer you nothing
except my loyalty.

148
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:58,072
Prince Thun,
we prize nothing more highly.

149
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:02,879
- And how great is this loyalty?
- Without measure.

150
00:23:03,302 --> 00:23:09,100
We are delighted to hear it.
Fall on your sword.

151
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:15,886
Show us this loyalty.
Throw yourself onto your sword.

152
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:36,562
May this deed of Prince Thun be an
example to all the kingdoms of Mongo.

153
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:41,327
Death to Ming!

154
00:24:13,627 --> 00:24:17,506
- This Ming's a psycho.
- This Ming is a psycho.

155
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:24,281
- Who said that?
- The fair-haired prisoner.

156
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,284
Come along, Fellini.

157
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:57,972
Remember me?

158
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:09,894
- Who are you?
- Flash Gordon. Quarterback.

159
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:15,305
Dale Arden, Your Highness.
Live and let live, that's my motto.

160
00:25:15,753 --> 00:25:21,436
I'm Hans Zarkov. I kidnapped them
in an effort to save our planet Earth.

161
00:25:21,913 --> 00:25:27,558
An obscure body, which has given you
so much amusement recently.

162
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:32,871
We're only interested in friendship.
Why do you attack us?

163
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:36,002
Why not?

164
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:42,344
Pathetic earthlings.
Hurling your bodies into the void. -

165
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:46,367
- Without an inkling of
who or what is out here.

166
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:53,321
If you knew anything about
the Universe, you'd hide from it.

167
00:25:54,076 --> 00:25:56,918
Come closer.
Not you!

168
00:25:57,277 --> 00:26:02,959
- You. Let us see you.
- No.

169
00:26:11,877 --> 00:26:15,909
- Dale!
- Don't.

170
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:51,087
- Did you ever see such response?
- No. Truly.

171
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,897
She even rivals your daughter.

172
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,133
- What happened?
- Don't know, but it was sensational.

173
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,592
Remove the Earth woman.

174
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:18,260
Prepare her for our pleasure.

175
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:25,170
Forget it, Ming. Dale's with me.

176
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:31,184
- Stay back!
- Don't, Flash, they'll kill you.

177
00:27:45,085 --> 00:27:50,307
I'll go with them, just...
You...!

178
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:19,456
Klytus!

179
00:28:19,805 --> 00:28:24,067
Are your men on the right pills?

180
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:29,363
Maybe you should execute
their trainer.

181
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:41,519
Come here!

182
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:48,222
You fools. He's playing some
barbaric game. Match him, like this.

183
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:56,975
- Forty one! Forty two!
- Go, Flash, go.

184
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,827
Go, Flash, go!

185
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:35,902
Don't kill him yet, Father.

186
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:41,090
I want him.
Give him to me.

187
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:44,489
What would Prince Barin say?

188
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:50,460
I can handle Barin.
Please...

189
00:29:51,694 --> 00:29:55,073
Really, Aura. Your appetites
are too dangerous. I refuse.

190
00:29:55,454 --> 00:30:01,061
Guards! Deliver the scientist
to General Klytus for conditioning.

191
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:04,991
This one has defied us
before our subjects.

192
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:11,404
We order him disposed of tonight
by public execution.

193
00:30:12,616 --> 00:30:17,916
This is a public announcement.
Flash Gordon is to be executed -

194
00:30:18,376 --> 00:30:22,216
- at 29.15 Mingo mean time.

195
00:30:22,616 --> 00:30:28,990
Fly back to your kingdom.
You may see me sooner than you think.

196
00:30:32,217 --> 00:30:36,134
- Lying bitch.
- I'll come.

197
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:41,913
If you rocket there right away.
I've a surprise for you.

198
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:48,098
- Don't you love me?
- I don't trust you.

199
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:53,871
Just be there.

200
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:06,835
I demand to see the Governor.

201
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:13,174
I can hardly breathe in this thing.

202
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:18,571
Yes, you don't look well. And I'm told
you refused your final meal.

203
00:31:19,021 --> 00:31:22,976
- The chef will be upset.
- Tell him to go to hell!

204
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:28,680
Gas works more quickly
on an empty stomach. Any requests?

205
00:31:29,142 --> 00:31:34,326
- Let me see Dale right away.
- Oh, dear. How pathetic.

206
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:37,701
Yes, I anticipated that.

207
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,864
Bring in the Emperor's concubine.

208
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:48,790
- Oh, my God!
- I said I want to see her!

209
00:31:51,104 --> 00:31:57,133
You have until the sands run out.

210
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:04,981
Pathetic...

211
00:32:06,904 --> 00:32:12,203
You look great.
No kidding, you look great.

212
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:17,580
It's the eye make-up. I hope
I remember the trick when I wake up.

213
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:21,327
That's exactly
what I was gonna tell you.

214
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:25,889
This isn't happening.
It's just a bad dream.

215
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:28,148
I agree completely.

216
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:33,995
We'll wake up any minute
in Dark Harbor and laugh about this.

217
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:38,997
Only, next time I'll walk over
and talk to you.

218
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:44,456
- Promise?
- Cross my heart and hope to...

219
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:49,399
- I really will talk to you, Dale.
- What if we're wrong?

220
00:32:49,827 --> 00:32:54,781
- What if it isn't a dream?
- You'll find Zarkov, save the Earth.

221
00:32:55,228 --> 00:33:00,950
He'll get you home in the capsule.
Don't think of me, think of...

222
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:05,585
Don't look at it.

223
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:12,479
It won't turn over...
It won't turn over.

224
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:06,921
Did you enjoy yourselves on Sybaria?
I hear you flew the Doctor there.

225
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:11,233
Klytus kindly fed me the information.

226
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:16,780
He wants me himself. His agents
are always making up lies about me.

227
00:34:52,596 --> 00:34:57,703
Look!
Water is leaking from her eyes.

228
00:34:58,157 --> 00:35:04,070
It's what they call tears,
a sign of their weakness.

229
00:35:19,238 --> 00:35:23,424
This will help you on your way.

230
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:49,882
Flash!

231
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:18,718
FLASH GORDON -
EARTHLING EXECUTED BY MING

232
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:35,982
Hurry.

233
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:45,701
You know what happens
if I'm found out.

234
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:50,426
I'm a fool for you, Aura.

235
00:36:50,846 --> 00:36:54,570
There we are. Sybaria again,
same place, next weekend?

236
00:36:54,966 --> 00:36:59,075
I can hardly wait.

237
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:28,203
- Where am I?
- Back from the dead. I saved you.

238
00:37:28,689 --> 00:37:32,414
- How?
- By magic, of course.

239
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:37,686
- With a kiss, because I like you.
- Where's Dale and Zarkov?

240
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:44,812
They're safe. Put this uniform on
before the Lizard Men come.

241
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:50,263
Don't worry, I won't look.

242
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:54,301
I like you a lot.

243
00:37:58,892 --> 00:38:02,463
- Where are you taking me?
- To the moon Arboria.

244
00:38:02,852 --> 00:38:05,732
I've got to rescue my friends
and save Earth.

245
00:38:06,093 --> 00:38:11,623
Pretty risky telling that
to the Emperor's daughter.

246
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:16,935
- What's in Arboria?
- People who'll help you.

247
00:38:17,335 --> 00:38:22,403
- Prince Barin does anything I ask.
- That's Zarkov!

248
00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:29,870
They're just conditioning him
to our climate. Keep out of sight.

249
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:38,376
Every thousand years I test
each life system in the universe.

250
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:45,151
I visit it with mysteries,
earthquakes, unpredicted eclipses.

251
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:48,573
Strange craters in the wilderness.

252
00:38:48,935 --> 00:38:53,350
If these are taken as natural, I judge
that system ignorant and harmless.

253
00:38:53,774 --> 00:38:59,918
I spare it. But if the hand of Ming
is recognized in these events -

254
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:07,289
- I judge that system dangerous.
I call upon the great god Dyzan.

255
00:39:07,816 --> 00:39:15,074
And for his greater glory,
and our mutual pleasure...

256
00:39:16,217 --> 00:39:19,289
I destroy it utterly.

257
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:24,457
So it's my fault
Earth is being destroyed?

258
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:29,198
Precisely, Doctor.

259
00:39:29,778 --> 00:39:36,460
I thought it might amuse you to
know this, before your mind is gone.

260
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,661
Proceed with it.

261
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,002
What are you doing to me?

262
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:52,644
We're just emptying your mind.

263
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:58,780
We are going to empty your memory
as we might empty your pockets...

264
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:04,099
- Doctor...
- No, don't. Please. I beg you.

265
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:09,264
My mind is all I have. I've spent
my whole life trying to fill it.

266
00:40:09,702 --> 00:40:13,695
Begin.

267
00:40:55,545 --> 00:40:59,462
Now he showed promise.

268
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:18,662
Papa!

269
00:41:39,548 --> 00:41:42,390
- Hold it there.
- Reprogram now?

270
00:41:42,749 --> 00:41:45,936
Yes.

271
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:51,148
But don't fill him with anything above
level three. His mind can't take it.

272
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,393
I understand. Level three only.

273
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,169
I have to attend to something.

274
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,964
- Can you manage without me?
- I'll try.

275
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:05,770
I'll return.

276
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:09,837
Begin to reprogram.

277
00:42:10,712 --> 00:42:15,128
Continue to level six.
I gave you an order.

278
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:20,044
Program the subject to level six.

279
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:33,210
Try again.

280
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:40,770
Your left hand controls direction,
right does the altitude.

281
00:42:41,107 --> 00:42:45,720
And use your fingers too this time.

282
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:53,329
Gently, darling,
it's extremely sensitive...

283
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:57,171
- Like me.
- What's that?

284
00:42:57,553 --> 00:43:01,854
The planet Aquaria.

285
00:43:06,275 --> 00:43:12,956
Now take a left over Frigia,
the next moon rising.

286
00:43:14,956 --> 00:43:21,254
Every moon of Mongo is a kingdom.
My father keeps them fighting.

287
00:43:21,757 --> 00:43:26,671
It's a really brilliant strategy.

288
00:43:27,116 --> 00:43:32,300
- Why don't they team up against him?
- Team up? What does that mean?

289
00:43:32,757 --> 00:43:36,942
- Maybe I'll show you sometime.
- Wonderful.

290
00:43:37,357 --> 00:43:41,657
You can do it
when I take you to Cythera.

291
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:46,110
It's my secret pleasure moon.
I have a little palace there.

292
00:43:46,518 --> 00:43:49,398
- Just for two.

293
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:54,828
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, Flash, I saved your life.

294
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,685
Drink this.
It has no name.

295
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,112
Many brave men died to bring it here
from the Galaxy of Pleasure.

296
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,512
It will make your nights with Ming
more agreeable.

297
00:44:17,962 --> 00:44:20,342
- Will it make me forget?
- No.

298
00:44:20,682 --> 00:44:25,598
But it will make you not mind
remembering.

299
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:37,314
This isn't bad at all.

300
00:44:41,284 --> 00:44:46,812
It's a thought amplifier. I'm going to
think to Barin to expect us.

301
00:44:47,283 --> 00:44:50,853
- You're kidding. Think to him?
- Of course.

302
00:44:51,242 --> 00:44:56,503
- Don't you have telepathy on Earth?
- Could I call Dale on this?

303
00:44:56,963 --> 00:45:01,992
- If I showed you how. But I won't.
- Please, show me.

304
00:45:02,443 --> 00:45:08,434
You'll have to persuade me
much better than that.

305
00:45:10,524 --> 00:45:15,669
What are you doing? Are you mad?
Let go, we're diving into Frigia.

306
00:45:16,124 --> 00:45:21,577
- Pull up.
- Just tune me in to Dale.

307
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:34,855
Dale, it's me, Flash.
Are you getting me?

308
00:45:35,246 --> 00:45:40,853
Oh, my head.
If it only was you.

309
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:48,086
- She's not getting me.
- Use your brain.

310
00:45:49,008 --> 00:45:54,038
I'm with you, Dale. Just concentrate hard.
It's telepathy.

311
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:58,905
Can this be real?
I saw you executed.

312
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:04,475
- I was saved.
- Thank God. Where are you?

313
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:09,230
In a rocket to Arboria, to get help.
Are you okay?

314
00:46:09,649 --> 00:46:14,871
- I'm locked in Ming's bedroom.
- Fake him out. Girls know how.

315
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:18,786
It's been done to me.
"Fake him out till I get back."

316
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:23,548
It's too dangerous for you here.
Stay where you're safe.

317
00:46:23,971 --> 00:46:29,962
- This girl really turns me on...
- I didn't quite get that.

318
00:46:30,452 --> 00:46:35,021
- It wasn't about you.
- What?

319
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:40,713
I've got to go, someone's coming.
Got to stop thinking to each other.

320
00:46:42,653 --> 00:46:46,990
His Imperial Highness
will be here very soon.

321
00:46:47,412 --> 00:46:52,096
- Shall I pour?
- Please.

322
00:46:52,573 --> 00:46:58,141
- Wouldn't you like a sip?
- No, it's forbidden for us slaves.

323
00:46:58,613 --> 00:47:03,450
It's quality stuff, have some.

324
00:47:03,893 --> 00:47:08,654
We're all girls here, I won't tell.
Just one sip.

325
00:47:09,093 --> 00:47:13,356
Live a little.

326
00:47:19,415 --> 00:47:23,102
Bottoms up.

327
00:47:26,095 --> 00:47:28,898
- What is your name?
- Hans Zarkov.

328
00:47:29,255 --> 00:47:34,553
Agent Zarkov! Number 2133 of the
Anti-Insurgent Espionage Group.

329
00:47:35,015 --> 00:47:37,511
Hail Ming.

330
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:41,312
Good.

331
00:48:05,459 --> 00:48:09,606
- It's not usually so bad.
- How far to the landing pad?

332
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:14,780
Six point four. I'll drop the flaps.

333
00:49:08,102 --> 00:49:11,750
You?

334
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:31,428
Over here.

335
00:49:34,786 --> 00:49:38,394
Hey buddy!

336
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:38,254
I've got her.
Sector 409 beta.

337
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:42,973
Activate Agent Zarkov.

338
00:50:59,552 --> 00:51:03,238
Dr. Zarkov.
You're a sight for sore eyes.

339
00:51:03,632 --> 00:51:07,165
- Rest a minute.
- I can't.

340
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:10,739
We've got to join up with Flash.
He's alive.

341
00:51:11,112 --> 00:51:15,182
I talked to him by telepathy.
He went to Arboria to get help.

342
00:51:15,591 --> 00:51:19,086
- Incredible.
- There's soldiers everywhere.

343
00:51:19,473 --> 00:51:22,007
- Let me think a moment.
- Unseal the city.

344
00:51:22,353 --> 00:51:28,036
- Allow her to exit with Zarkov.
- I think I can find a way out.

345
00:51:28,513 --> 00:51:32,622
No questions, just follow me.

346
00:51:36,195 --> 00:51:39,996
Dale Arden is under the guidance
of Agent Zarkov.

347
00:51:40,394 --> 00:51:45,732
- But Flash Gordon is still alive.
- He was revived by a traitor.

348
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:50,266
And spirited from the city.
We know this from the Earth girl.

349
00:51:50,676 --> 00:51:56,013
- What traitor?
- I have my suspicions.

350
00:51:56,476 --> 00:52:00,009
- Stop at nothing.
- No matter to whom the trail leads?

351
00:52:00,397 --> 00:52:04,736
I said at nothing.

352
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:19,030
- What's that?
- Their sacred temple.

353
00:52:19,399 --> 00:52:25,773
A young man is being initiated.
But we must hide till it's done.

354
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,295
I love initiations.

355
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:09,966
I am now of age, Green Father.
I ask for the test of manhood.

356
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:15,775
Choose your passage,
into this world, or the next.

357
00:53:16,241 --> 00:53:21,080
May Arbor guide you.

358
00:54:15,206 --> 00:54:18,432
Send me on my way.

359
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:24,683
- Spare me the madness.
- I will. Hold him.

360
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:35,783
- This guy is going to help me?
- Stay.

361
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:47,491
That was extremely moving.
I do sometimes keep a promise.

362
00:54:52,211 --> 00:54:56,819
- Prepare a feast.
- No, I have to get back right away.

363
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:04,507
- Then why did you come?
- I brought you a present. Flash?

364
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:13,536
Welcome back from the grave.

365
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,732
I knew you were up to something,
but not necrophilia.

366
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:20,623
Just keep him for me until my father
has had his way with Dale Arden.

367
00:55:21,011 --> 00:55:25,734
I'll keep him all right! In my larder.
Take him, with the rest of the meat.

368
00:55:26,172 --> 00:55:32,392
I forbid it. If you kill Flash,
you'll never have me again.

369
00:55:32,893 --> 00:55:37,309
What danger is there?
Everyone thinks he's dead.

370
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:42,341
- I'll take him to Cythera next week.
- Harboring a fugitive is treason.

371
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:47,880
You're not frightened of Ming.

372
00:55:48,654 --> 00:55:54,030
- You are playing with fire, Aura.
- Of course I am.

373
00:56:00,735 --> 00:56:03,385
Does anyone ever trust her twice?

374
00:56:03,576 --> 00:56:06,878
So they let us escape because Klytus
thought he erased your memory.

375
00:56:07,256 --> 00:56:14,704
Do you know why it failed? I started
to recite Shakespeare, the Talmud. -

376
00:56:15,256 --> 00:56:22,130
- Einstein, anything I could remember,
even The Beatles. It armored me.

377
00:56:22,656 --> 00:56:28,992
They couldn't wipe those things away.
You can't beat the human spirit.

378
00:56:34,578 --> 00:56:39,916
Prince Barin! I'm not your enemy,
Ming is. And you know it.

379
00:56:40,379 --> 00:56:46,790
Ming is the enemy of every creature
on Mongo. Let's team up and fight him.

380
00:56:47,899 --> 00:56:52,238
Lower them into the swamp.

381
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:56,351
We can do it, Barin!

382
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:23,233
Your lover Barin is harboring
Gordon, is he not?

383
00:57:23,661 --> 00:57:25,850
This lying is such a waste of time.

384
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:32,172
You left with a pilot and returned
alone. Wasn't he Gordon?

385
00:57:32,662 --> 00:57:36,733
Who do you think you're protecting?
The Imperial Surgeon?

386
00:57:37,142 --> 00:57:41,750
- Another lover of yours!
- Your jealousy has made you mad.

387
00:57:42,182 --> 00:57:45,638
Seize the surgeon
on suspicion of treason.

388
00:57:46,023 --> 00:57:49,978
- Prepare him for torture!
- Confess and we won't hurt you.

389
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:54,376
- We don't like doing this at all.
- Never!

390
00:57:54,783 --> 00:57:58,163
Bring me the bore worms.

391
00:57:58,544 --> 00:58:03,766
No! Not the bore worms.

392
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:10,441
I'm a princess. My father
will have your head for this.

393
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:18,352
He'll execute your whole perverted
secret police. I demand to see him!

394
00:58:18,905 --> 00:58:22,976
With pleasure.

395
00:58:27,027 --> 00:58:31,021
- Father...
- The traitor is close to confession.

396
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:35,191
Should we stop the torture?

397
00:58:35,588 --> 00:58:40,657
- No.
- Damn you, father!

398
00:58:45,509 --> 00:58:50,423
- That damn woman's using me again.
- What do you expect?

399
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:57,357
- I don't know what you see in her.
- Keep playing, fool.

400
00:58:58,149 --> 00:59:04,099
- Fico, I'm going to kill Gordon now.
- And lose the princess forever?

401
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:10,540
There must be a way to dispose of him
and keep faith with the princess.

402
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:16,520
- I'm sorry, Flash, I'm finished.
- No, you're not. Get up.

403
00:59:16,989 --> 00:59:21,558
Look, someone's coming.

404
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:28,289
Send him over. Hurry up.

405
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:32,741
It's no good, Flash.
I can't hold on.

406
00:59:33,151 --> 00:59:37,413
Go on, get in.

407
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:42,937
Sleep well, you traitor.
We hang you in the morning.

408
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:51,976
- There's always hope.
- This is better.

409
00:59:52,353 --> 00:59:56,462
I stole the key.
We need weapons to cross the swamp.

410
00:59:56,873 --> 01:00:00,099
They're stored in the temple.
Want to climb up with me?

411
01:00:00,473 --> 01:00:04,659
Hold on, Hawkman.

412
01:00:06,755 --> 01:00:10,134
Nice confession. I commend you.

413
01:00:10,515 --> 01:00:15,583
- Execute her.
- No. Too kind.

414
01:00:16,035 --> 01:00:19,414
Aura will be banished to Frigia
after my wedding.

415
01:00:19,795 --> 01:00:25,593
One year in a cavern of ice
will cool her blood.

416
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:29,677
And then, who knows?

417
01:00:30,076 --> 01:00:35,375
Perhaps we'll marry her to someone
worthy of her treacherous nature.

418
01:00:35,837 --> 01:00:44,362
- How can I express my gratitude?
- Easily. Get me Gordon and Barin.

419
01:00:47,998 --> 01:00:50,341
With pleasure.

420
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:15,592
Hans, look!

421
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,820
- Hey Vultan!
- Not now.

422
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,772
You'll love this.
See what Brave Blue has caught.

423
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,307
Prince Vultan. Remember us?

424
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:43,175
Indeed I do, my lovely.

425
01:01:43,601 --> 01:01:47,825
Call the Emperor.
Tell him I have prisoners.

426
01:01:48,242 --> 01:01:51,391
- You wouldn't!
- Are you mad, Vultan?

427
01:01:51,762 --> 01:01:57,253
You hate Ming. You're only waiting
for the moment to attack.

428
01:01:57,722 --> 01:02:00,564
Yes, and Ming knows it, too.

429
01:02:00,923 --> 01:02:05,876
By delivering you,
I allay his suspicions.

430
01:02:06,324 --> 01:02:11,661
- I gain time.
- Our weapons are inferior.

431
01:02:12,124 --> 01:02:16,118
Ming's not unbeatable.
He couldn't even kill Flash.

432
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:21,555
- Gordon's alive?
- In Arboria with Prince Barin.

433
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:25,575
I tell you, now is the time to strike.

434
01:02:36,446 --> 01:02:41,170
- Where are the weapons?
- Feel one.

435
01:02:47,287 --> 01:02:51,972
- Do you know where you are?
- Up the creek.

436
01:02:52,407 --> 01:02:55,517
You've trespassed.

437
01:02:55,887 --> 01:03:01,916
A stranger in this temple
must try the Wood Beast, or die...

438
01:03:02,408 --> 01:03:06,286
That figures.

439
01:03:07,288 --> 01:03:11,357
You came here of your own free will.
However. -

440
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:18,027
- Because of my word to Aura,
I swear by Arbor I'll not kill you...

441
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:21,984
Unless you beg me to.

442
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:26,093
The Beast lies somewhere
in the stump. Choose a passage.

443
01:03:26,488 --> 01:03:30,060
No way.

444
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:38,774
- Coward.
- Let's do it.

445
01:03:53,332 --> 01:03:56,595
Must be my lucky day.

446
01:03:56,971 --> 01:04:00,696
You scared?

447
01:04:07,732 --> 01:04:12,263
What would Aura think of you now?

448
01:04:21,974 --> 01:04:26,237
Second down.

449
01:04:30,614 --> 01:04:32,880
Your play.

450
01:04:33,214 --> 01:04:36,862
No, yours.

451
01:04:37,255 --> 01:04:44,128
- Are you sure these are the rules?
- They've just been changed.

452
01:05:06,098 --> 01:05:10,207
Death is certain,
but only after tortured madness.

453
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:15,340
- How long?
- It depends on your strength.

454
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:20,846
Please, end it now.

455
01:05:21,377 --> 01:05:26,139
Tricked you, Barin.
Back off!

456
01:05:26,578 --> 01:05:32,068
One move and you're looking
for a new prince.

457
01:05:33,738 --> 01:05:40,190
Leave him! He's mine.
I hunt him alone.

458
01:07:09,787 --> 01:07:13,742
What the hell is going on?

459
01:07:37,588 --> 01:07:43,194
This is one grave
you won't be returning from.

460
01:07:45,309 --> 01:07:47,959
Vultan wants a word.

461
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:10,832
Excuse me for waking you. We scanned
a Hawkman patrol 400 Mongo miles east.

462
01:08:11,271 --> 01:08:15,611
They have Gordon and Prince Barin.

463
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:21,668
- When do we reach Vultan's kingdom?
- Estimating sixteen.

464
01:08:22,113 --> 01:08:26,682
Wake me when it's in sight.

465
01:08:33,953 --> 01:08:38,293
- You'd sell us to Ming?
- Come on, Barin.

466
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:43,935
Do you expect mercy here? What
would you do if I were your captive?

467
01:08:44,394 --> 01:08:48,734
Remind you of
Article 17 of Ming's Law:

468
01:08:49,154 --> 01:08:52,726
"No prince of Mongo
shall be offered for ransom -

469
01:08:53,115 --> 01:08:56,303
- without trial by combat."

470
01:08:56,676 --> 01:09:01,976
Is there such an article?
What a damned nuisance.

471
01:09:02,437 --> 01:09:09,924
- And... who do you choose to fight?
- Him.

472
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:15,582
This is a lunatic asylum.

473
01:09:15,957 --> 01:09:19,872
- Where are we being taken now?
- Ssh, I'm calculating.

474
01:09:20,275 --> 01:09:25,842
Time remaining before the moon crashes
on Earth. I'd say, roughly...

475
01:09:26,317 --> 01:09:29,619
Fourteen hours, nine minutes
and twenty seconds.

476
01:09:29,997 --> 01:09:34,566
And we haven't even found...
Flash!

477
01:09:38,596 --> 01:09:42,667
Last time I saw you
I prayed it was a dream.

478
01:09:43,077 --> 01:09:47,840
This time I pray it's not.
Are you okay? Me too.

479
01:09:48,278 --> 01:09:53,846
- I've got some crazy stories to tell.
- Save them for our kids.

480
01:09:54,320 --> 01:10:01,155
- Enough!
- Leave us alone! I just got engaged.

481
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:18,518
Let the combat begin! To the death.

482
01:10:50,444 --> 01:10:54,553
Give me the remote control.

483
01:10:57,446 --> 01:11:01,401
Come on!

484
01:11:04,686 --> 01:11:08,410
He's tilting it.

485
01:11:15,406 --> 01:11:18,939
Watch out!

486
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:36,460
- Present from Vultan.
- Brute! Give me that.

487
01:11:36,847 --> 01:11:41,148
- Bastard!
- Flash!

488
01:11:46,046 --> 01:11:50,539
Come on, finish him.

489
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,830
Flash! I love you.

490
01:12:25,212 --> 01:12:30,396
But we only have 14 hours
to save the Earth.

491
01:12:44,533 --> 01:12:48,373
How's that feel, Arborian?

492
01:12:57,535 --> 01:13:04,215
If you kill me, promise to team up
with Vultan and fight Ming.

493
01:13:06,175 --> 01:13:09,630
Goodbye, Barin.

494
01:13:15,295 --> 01:13:21,170
- Take my hand.
- You've won, let him go.

495
01:13:30,176 --> 01:13:33,747
That's it, Prince.

496
01:13:35,656 --> 01:13:40,455
- What is this?
- Humanity.

497
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:04,588
Where you go, I follow.

498
01:14:06,739 --> 01:14:10,578
Listen to me!

499
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:15,011
There is something finer
in this galaxy than Ming's law.

500
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:19,297
Rubbish!

501
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:28,122
Hawkmen, to your posts!

502
01:14:49,062 --> 01:14:52,441
Agent Zarkov,
you will be liquidated for treachery.

503
01:14:52,823 --> 01:14:56,855
Vultan!
Surrender the fugitives at once. -

504
01:14:57,263 --> 01:15:01,948
- Or the Imperial Fleet will blast
your kingdom to atoms.

505
01:15:04,984 --> 01:15:07,672
- Step forward, Barin.
- "Prince" Barin.

506
01:15:08,025 --> 01:15:13,630
Princess Aura has implicated you
on a charge of high treason.

507
01:15:14,104 --> 01:15:17,484
- A prison ship will take you away.
- You tortured Aura.

508
01:15:17,866 --> 01:15:21,206
Interesting girl. I think
she found it rather enjoyable.

509
01:15:21,586 --> 01:15:25,387
Klytus.

510
01:15:41,585 --> 01:15:44,887
The first step forward.

511
01:15:45,265 --> 01:15:50,295
Into the air, Hawkpeople.
Fly for your lives!

512
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:55,968
You damned hothead, you brought down
destruction on my kingdom.

513
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:59,461
He showed us the way.
Fight with us.

514
01:15:59,827 --> 01:16:03,936
- Against the Imperial Fleet?
- They won't expect resistance.

515
01:16:04,348 --> 01:16:07,036
- We'll take them by surprise.
- We can do it.

516
01:16:07,388 --> 01:16:14,069
You're all mad! My duty is
to protect my people. Evacuate!

517
01:16:14,588 --> 01:16:18,889
- Then take us with you.
- Impossible, we can't carry more.

518
01:16:19,309 --> 01:16:22,573
- You're leaving us to die?
- You know Ming's law.

519
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:26,828
Outside his own kingdom,
the hunter becomes the hunted.

520
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:33,604
- Traitor!
- Save your breath. Fly!

521
01:16:40,071 --> 01:16:42,183
Help me pull these down.

522
01:16:42,512 --> 01:16:45,314
We'll make parachutes
and jump to Arboria.

523
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:47,630
We'll kill ourselves.

524
01:16:47,952 --> 01:16:51,983
A body reaches maximum velocity
within a few hundred feet.

525
01:16:52,391 --> 01:16:59,534
- We'll need some rope.
- My God, what is that?

526
01:17:00,433 --> 01:17:06,577
It's Ming.
We must stop him.

527
01:17:12,635 --> 01:17:16,013
- Blast them?
- Not yet. Send down a shuttle.

528
01:17:16,394 --> 01:17:20,196
- Bring back Barin, Zarkov and Dale.
- And Gordon?

529
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:25,855
Leave him there.
Prepare my Imperial Lander.

530
01:17:31,714 --> 01:17:35,093
Why aren't I going with them?

531
01:17:35,475 --> 01:17:41,158
- I've got other plans for you.
- I can imagine.

532
01:17:41,635 --> 01:17:48,854
- You want to destroy me.
- It's the only way to save Earth.

533
01:17:49,395 --> 01:17:55,155
- What if I granted you a kingdom?
- If you what?

534
01:17:55,597 --> 01:17:59,821
Ming the Merciless,
ruler of the universe. -

535
01:18:00,237 --> 01:18:06,650
- Offers Flash Gordon a kingdom
of Mongo, to rule over as his own.

536
01:18:07,158 --> 01:18:12,110
You're crazy. Why would you do that?

537
01:18:12,558 --> 01:18:16,896
Because I've never met your like.
You're a hero, don't you see that?

538
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:24,537
Who better to rule a kingdom?
Your moon is very close now.

539
01:18:25,078 --> 01:18:30,685
- Earth's end might come within hours.
- You'd call off the attack?

540
01:18:31,159 --> 01:18:33,770
- I could.
- Everyone would be saved?

541
01:18:34,119 --> 01:18:38,881
Yes, and no.

542
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,176
After the earthquakes and tidal waves,
they won't be the same human beings.

543
01:18:44,601 --> 01:18:49,323
They'll be more tractable. Easier
for you to rule, in the name of Ming.

544
01:18:49,761 --> 01:18:57,863
- You mean slaves?
- Let's say 'satisfied with less'.

545
01:18:59,042 --> 01:19:05,378
- What about Dale?
- We have decided to marry her.

546
01:19:05,883 --> 01:19:09,032
She's exceptional.
We'll breed with her -

547
01:19:09,403 --> 01:19:14,318
- And send our progeny back
to populate your Earth.

548
01:19:14,764 --> 01:19:20,830
Do you really prefer death
to a kingdom? I'm disappointed.

549
01:19:21,325 --> 01:19:27,813
I'd rather see you on my side
than scattered into...

550
01:19:29,684 --> 01:19:32,103
Atoms.

551
01:19:32,444 --> 01:19:37,358
But as you wish.

552
01:19:38,644 --> 01:19:45,441
We'll return to the Imperial Rocket.
Leave the Earthling here to his doom.

553
01:19:57,446 --> 01:20:02,246
- Beam another blast.
- You murderer.

554
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:42,223
Flash. I loved you.

555
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:50,857
- They were brave creatures.
- Shut up!

556
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:57,240
With respect, the man who rid us
of Klytus should not be deserted.

557
01:20:57,731 --> 01:21:03,721
So... maybe I'd do it different
if I had it over again.

558
01:21:04,212 --> 01:21:10,356
- Then fight.
- I can't help a man who's dead!

559
01:21:10,852 --> 01:21:16,804
Flash Gordon to Vultan.
Mayday, mayday.

560
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:21,788
This is Vultan. I read you.
Where are you?

561
01:21:22,213 --> 01:21:29,201
- Flying blind on a rocket cycle.
- Flying blind on a rocket cycle?

562
01:21:29,734 --> 01:21:34,227
We're in Arboria.
I'll send you a homing beam.

563
01:21:34,655 --> 01:21:40,221
For what it's worth,
Ming's got Dale, Zarkov and Barin.

564
01:21:40,653 --> 01:21:45,568
- I see. My thanks to you.
- What for?

565
01:21:46,014 --> 01:21:50,814
Well... for giving a dumb old bird
a second chance.

566
01:21:51,255 --> 01:21:55,555
Over to homing beam.

567
01:22:07,496 --> 01:22:11,336
Don't touch me!

568
01:22:12,216 --> 01:22:15,787
- You!
- Stop! I'm a prisoner too.

569
01:22:16,176 --> 01:22:22,742
Damned Mongo person! You couldn't
tell the truth to save your life.

570
01:22:24,496 --> 01:22:29,757
- Stop! I'm going to be exiled.
- Liar!

571
01:22:30,217 --> 01:22:34,095
Liar.

572
01:22:39,498 --> 01:22:46,180
- Is this another trick, Aura?
- Is this a trick?

573
01:22:46,699 --> 01:22:51,461
Could I cry
if my heart hadn't changed?

574
01:22:51,901 --> 01:22:57,084
I've been such a spoiled fool.
I never knew what my father was...

575
01:22:57,541 --> 01:23:01,342
Until he let Klytus use bore worms.

576
01:23:01,741 --> 01:23:06,502
I believe you.
But I don't trust you.

577
01:23:06,942 --> 01:23:11,857
You're of Ming's blood. You'll cosy up
with him again in the morning.

578
01:23:12,302 --> 01:23:16,718
Not if you give him this.
It's deadly poison.

579
01:23:17,142 --> 01:23:20,867
He always drinks a power potion
before making love.

580
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:27,328
- Drop this into his glass tonight.
- I can't. I gave him my word.

581
01:23:27,823 --> 01:23:31,586
- What word?
- To be a good wife...

582
01:23:31,983 --> 01:23:35,363
If he'd spare Zarkov and Barin.
He vowed he would.

583
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:40,350
My father has never kept a vow.

584
01:23:40,783 --> 01:23:46,389
Keeping our word is one of the things
that make us better than you.

585
01:23:47,183 --> 01:23:52,943
A guard will take you to the waiting
room. Your Joyous Time has come.

586
01:23:53,424 --> 01:23:57,570
You are to be prepared
for your wedding.

587
01:23:57,984 --> 01:24:03,168
I'm lost. Nothing can save me now.

588
01:24:16,866 --> 01:24:19,785
Flash Gordon approaching.

589
01:24:20,147 --> 01:24:24,447
What do you mean,
'Flash Gordon approaching'?

590
01:24:24,867 --> 01:24:29,128
On a rocket cycle.
Shall I inform His Majesty?

591
01:24:29,547 --> 01:24:33,770
The Emperor would shoot you
for interrupting his wedding.

592
01:24:34,187 --> 01:24:38,103
Fire when Gordon's in range.

593
01:24:57,109 --> 01:25:03,944
He's escaping, idiot!
Dispatch War Rocket Ajax.

594
01:25:23,073 --> 01:25:26,797
Charge the boosters.

595
01:25:35,153 --> 01:25:41,566
- Flash Gordon in range, Captain.
- Fire!

596
01:25:45,913 --> 01:25:51,557
- Shall we go in after him?
- No. Reduce velocity.

597
01:25:57,193 --> 01:26:02,069
Our trap worked.
They'll follow me for sure.

598
01:26:02,513 --> 01:26:06,507
Stand by, my Hawkmen!

599
01:26:09,514 --> 01:26:14,851
- He's not coming out, sir.
- Prepare to electrify cloud.

600
01:26:15,315 --> 01:26:21,997
Prepare sky nets to catch
Gordon's body. Fire capacitators.

601
01:26:26,557 --> 01:26:32,469
- They're trying to flush you out.
- Let's go in.

602
01:26:38,157 --> 01:26:43,456
Good. They're coming through.

603
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:11,008
Squadron 40... Dive!

604
01:27:26,321 --> 01:27:30,045
Arm topside!

605
01:27:42,403 --> 01:27:46,702
Second wave. Dive!

606
01:28:16,004 --> 01:28:19,883
Stop engines. Repel boarders.

607
01:28:58,608 --> 01:29:05,020
- Biro's hit. I'm going in after him.
- Impetuous boy.

608
01:29:06,249 --> 01:29:11,625
Oh well, who wants to live forever?

609
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:16,291
Dive!

610
01:30:08,413 --> 01:30:12,368
Biro, hold on, I'm coming.

611
01:30:12,933 --> 01:30:18,808
- You all right?
- They winged me. Detonate the mine.

612
01:30:22,254 --> 01:30:25,863
Blow it, Flash!

613
01:30:30,455 --> 01:30:34,755
Let's get out of here.

614
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:42,870
Well done, Flash. Here.
Up there, Luro!

615
01:30:43,256 --> 01:30:46,981
Come on.

616
01:30:50,857 --> 01:30:54,927
Full velocity, all drives.

617
01:31:13,178 --> 01:31:15,866
Attention, all citizens.

618
01:31:16,218 --> 01:31:21,671
Behold the face
of your Empress to be.

619
01:31:22,939 --> 01:31:28,238
While you await the ceremony,
all channels will display -

620
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:34,076
- the execution of the traitors,
Barin and Zarkov.

621
01:31:45,582 --> 01:31:49,729
Pick that up, would you?

622
01:31:56,781 --> 01:32:00,352
Tell me more about this Houdini.

623
01:32:00,742 --> 01:32:05,120
This is it.
At least it'll be over quickly.

624
01:32:11,262 --> 01:32:16,944
Scanner malfunction,
area 7-7 delta, under repair.

625
01:32:26,663 --> 01:32:30,273
- They've changed the code.
- I've changed too, Aura.

626
01:32:30,664 --> 01:32:34,236
- I think I can work it out.
- Will you marry me?

627
01:32:34,624 --> 01:32:38,809
We'll try.
Not now, Barin!

628
01:32:39,224 --> 01:32:41,758
If I'm not at the wedding,
I'll be shot.

629
01:32:42,105 --> 01:32:48,249
I thought it was the Zeitman series!
I haven't changed.

630
01:32:53,586 --> 01:32:58,617
Everybody take off! Form a battle
stream behind the rocket.

631
01:32:59,067 --> 01:33:02,369
Flash and me bail out
when the shooting starts.

632
01:33:02,748 --> 01:33:07,624
- And keep your head down.
- See you in Mingo City.

633
01:33:08,067 --> 01:33:13,481
Yes... with luck.
What are you setting there?

634
01:33:13,948 --> 01:33:19,631
That's the time left for the Earth.
In minutes and seconds.

635
01:33:20,109 --> 01:33:24,525
- Level with me. Will this do it?
- Yes, no doubt.

636
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:30,287
There's a lightning field at the
entrance. When this baby hits it...

637
01:33:30,749 --> 01:33:36,547
It will blow that field dead.
My Hawkmen fly right in.

638
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:41,599
Let's see what Mingo City's saying.

639
01:33:46,831 --> 01:33:49,788
Oh, my God.

640
01:34:18,952 --> 01:34:22,063
- Rocket Ajax returning.
- With Gordon's body?

641
01:34:22,432 --> 01:34:25,236
I presume so. Communications are off.

642
01:34:25,593 --> 01:34:31,084
- Are they in the proper approach?
- Negative.

643
01:34:31,553 --> 01:34:35,317
- Open fire!
- On Ajax?

644
01:34:35,714 --> 01:34:40,283
All weapons, now!
Charge the lightning field.

645
01:34:40,714 --> 01:34:46,512
I take responsibility,
in the Emperor's name.

646
01:34:52,275 --> 01:34:56,461
Attention, all wedding guests.
There is no cause for alarm.

647
01:34:56,875 --> 01:35:00,869
The weapons are being fired
in continuous salute. -

648
01:35:01,276 --> 01:35:06,268
- In honor of His Majesty's wedding.

649
01:35:11,197 --> 01:35:15,037
Come on, Flash.
It's time to bail out.

650
01:35:15,437 --> 01:35:19,661
Sorry, I'm not coming.
The rocket cycle's gone.

651
01:35:20,078 --> 01:35:24,071
- I'll carry you.
- Bail out, Vultan.

652
01:35:24,478 --> 01:35:27,857
- Are you crazy?
- The fire's too heavy.

653
01:35:28,238 --> 01:35:31,310
We'll never make it
with nobody at the wheel.

654
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:35,865
- It's suicide, Flash!
- No. A rational transaction.

655
01:35:36,279 --> 01:35:40,158
- One life for billions.
- You'll be destroyed!

656
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,823
Looney bird!
Get out of here, they need you.

657
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:50,843
- Goodbye, Flash, it's been...
- I know. For me too, Vultan.

658
01:35:51,361 --> 01:35:54,625
Tell Dale I know
it would've been good.

659
01:35:55,001 --> 01:35:58,340
You must come from
one hell of a planet.

660
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:03,098
Not too bad.

661
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:15,131
Onward, my brave Hawkmen.

662
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:22,279
Let this be known forever
as Flash Gordon's Day!

663
01:36:23,842 --> 01:36:29,179
- Freeze, you bloody bastards!
- Take us to Ming.

664
01:36:29,642 --> 01:36:33,175
We do not lead traitors
to the Emperor.

665
01:36:33,563 --> 01:36:39,899
We'll find a way.
Grab an imager off an agent.

666
01:36:45,523 --> 01:36:49,363
Zarkov!

667
01:36:51,844 --> 01:36:54,916
- Thank you.
- Ajax still approaching.

668
01:36:55,285 --> 01:36:57,742
Identified Earthling Gordon
at the controls.

669
01:36:58,085 --> 01:37:02,885
We guarantee its destruction in
the lightning field. General Kala?

670
01:37:03,326 --> 01:37:06,743
Please show yourself.

671
01:37:07,126 --> 01:37:11,312
- Let's go.
- We must deactivate the field.

672
01:37:11,727 --> 01:37:15,835
- Where are the atomic generators?
- There's no time.

673
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:22,083
I'm heading for Sector Alpha 9.
Hold the fort.

674
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:40,749
There must be a way of
deactivating the lightning field.

675
01:38:11,330 --> 01:38:15,092
Do you, Ming the Merciless,
ruler of the universe. -

676
01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:19,560
- Take this Earthling, Dale Arden,
to be your Empress of the hour?

677
01:38:19,971 --> 01:38:25,577
- Of the hour, yes.
- Do you promise to use her?

678
01:38:26,052 --> 01:38:32,464
Not to blast her into space...
until you grow weary of her?

679
01:38:32,972 --> 01:38:37,043
- I do.
- I do not!

680
01:39:00,334 --> 01:39:04,827
Recite after me, Your Majesty.
With this ring...

681
01:39:05,255 --> 01:39:10,401
Matsuna! Ring! Ring!

682
01:39:13,496 --> 01:39:19,984
Recite after me, Your Majesty.
With this ring I thee wed.

683
01:39:20,576 --> 01:39:24,723
Dale, what a damn shame.

684
01:39:29,177 --> 01:39:34,553
Freeze!
Deactivate the lightning field.

685
01:39:56,179 --> 01:40:00,096
- Gordon!
- Flash?

686
01:40:42,223 --> 01:40:48,827
The game's lost. Stop your attack
on Earth, and I'll spare your life.

687
01:40:49,342 --> 01:40:52,453
You pitiful fool.

688
01:40:52,823 --> 01:40:57,354
My life is not
for any Earthling to give. -

689
01:40:57,783 --> 01:41:01,623
- Or take.

690
01:41:03,904 --> 01:41:08,128
Your power's fading, Ming.

691
01:41:30,186 --> 01:41:33,220
The reactors are destroyed.
Glad you made it, Vultan.

692
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:36,236
Better late than never.

693
01:41:36,587 --> 01:41:39,659
- Dale.
- Look out, Flash.

694
01:41:40,027 --> 01:41:44,789
Don't move. Stay where you are.

695
01:41:45,229 --> 01:41:51,986
Long live Flash. You've saved
your Earth. Have a nice day.

696
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:03,753
Barin is the rightful heir.

697
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:07,681
Hail Barin, King of Mongo.

698
01:42:08,068 --> 01:42:11,754
We owe everything to Flash.

699
01:42:12,149 --> 01:42:17,870
We appoint Vultan
General of our armies.

700
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:26,067
From this day on, let every breed
of Mongo live together in peace.

701
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:31,759
- Will we ever get out of here, Hans?
- I don't know.

702
01:42:32,190 --> 01:42:36,183
- But we'll try.
- We certainly invite you all to stay.

703
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:42,235
- What do you think?
- I'm a New York City girl.

704
01:42:42,711 --> 01:42:47,972
It's a little too quiet around here
for me.

705
01:42:58,353 --> 01:43:02,769
THANKS

706
01:43:07,034 --> 01:43:12,602
FLASH
