00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:06,264
<i>My husband used to tell me</i>

3
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,767
<i>I have an overactive
imagination.</i>

4
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,969
<i>I can't help it.</i>

5
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,437
<i>I mean, haven't you ever been</i>

6
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,840
<i>on a train and wondered
about the lives</i>

7
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,408
<i>of the people
who live near the tracks?</i>

8
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,477
<i>The lives you've never lived.</i>

9
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,315
<i>These are things I want to know.</i>

10
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,153
<i>Twice a day, I sit in
the third car from the front</i>

11
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:31,623
<i>where I have the perfect view
into my favorite house.</i>

12
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,258
<i>Number 15 Beckett road.</i>

13
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,835
<i>I don't know when exactly.</i>

14
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,939
<i>I suppose I started
noticing her about a year ago,</i>

15
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,442
<i>and gradually,
as the months went past,</i>

16
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,278
<i>she became important to me.</i>

17
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,467
<i>I'm not the girl I used to be.</i>

18
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,803
<i>I think people can see it
on my face.</i>

19
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,721
<i>She's what I lost.</i>

20
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:41,459
<i>She's everything I want to be.</i>

21
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:19,698
<i>I imagine she's a painter.</i>

22
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:24,402
<i>She's creative.</i>

23
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,871
<i>He's a doctor or an architect.</i>

24
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,211
<i>He has a good laugh.</i>

25
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,480
<i>She can't cook.</i>

26
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,386
<i>I wonder what they say
to each other</i>

27
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,887
<i>before they go to sleep.</i>

28
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,799
<i>Today her name is Jess;
Tomorrow it could be...</i>

29
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,901
<i>Lisa or Amber.</i>

30
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,904
<i>It all depends on the day;
It depends on my mood.</i>

31
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:07,579
<i>The truth is,
I don't know her name.</i>

32
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,882
<i>I don't know if she paints or
whether he has a good laugh.</i>

33
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,053
<i>I just know they know love.</i>

34
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,025
<i>Sometimes I catch myself
trying to remember</i>

35
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:23,528
<i>the last time I had meaningful
contact with another person.</i>

36
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:36,808
<i>I used to live two doors down,
number 13 Beckett road.</i>

37
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,512
- No.
<i>- It was my first home.</i>

38
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,447
<i>We bought it together.</i>

39
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,183
<i>- It was ours.</i> -You didn't
even like having him over.

40
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,785
I hated it.

41
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,321
<i>Every day,
I tell myself not to look.</i>

42
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,361
<i>But then I look.</i>

43
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:05,203
<i>Are you alone?</i>

44
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:07,706
Yeah.

45
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,607
No, it's...
Come. It's all yours.

46
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,645
- Okay.
- Your baby's so cute.

47
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,814
- Oh, thank you.
- Hi, baby!

48
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,315
Is it a... is it a boy?

49
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,750
Yeah!

50
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,186
So sweet.
How ol... how old is he?

51
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,154
- Six months.
- Six months.

52
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,227
So sweet.

53
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,001
Shh.

54
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,603
Here.

55
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,735
<i>A teacher once told me I was</i>

56
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,570
<i>a mistress
of self-reinvention.</i>

57
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,405
Down the center line,

58
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,775
open, around and together...

59
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,377
<i>I wasn't really sure
what it meant at the time.</i>

60
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,312
Around and up.

61
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,914
<i>But since moving here,</i>

62
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,449
<i>I've come to understand it.</i>

63
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:32,724
<i>Ardsley-on-Hudson
is boring and routine.</i>

64
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,128
<i>It's a fucking baby factory.</i>

65
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,233
<i>I want to start my life
over again.</i>

66
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,704
<i>So far, I've been
a rebellious teenager...</i>

67
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,475
<i>lover...</i>

68
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,410
<i>Waitress...</i>

69
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,847
<i>Gallery director...</i>

70
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,849
<i>Nanny...</i>

71
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,819
<i>and...</i>

72
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,320
<i>A whore.</i>

73
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,591
<i>And not necessarily
in that order.</i>

74
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:16,301
<i>I can't just be a wife anymore.</i>

75
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,303
<i>That's why I...</i>

76
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,839
<i>Stay awake at night
staring at the ceiling.</i>

77
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,510
In fact, the only time
I feel like myself

78
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,780
is when I'm running.

79
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,949
You always felt that way?

80
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:36,554
Maybe since I was...

81
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,823
- About 17.
- Mm-hmm.

82
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,959
With Mac.

83
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,696
Mac? Who's Mac?

84
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,632
My brother's best friend.

85
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,601
My brother who died.

86
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,478
I tend to smile
when I'm nervous.

87
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,447
Sometimes I laugh.

88
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,793
For a year, Mac and I lived
in this hunting cabin.

89
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,398
We started fucking.

90
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,274
We were the saddest people
we knew.

91
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,845
But in a way,
that cabin made us happy.

92
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:39,183
No one could find us.

93
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,286
Everyone thought we were dead.

94
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,588
And if you were
to run away today,

95
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,224
right now, where would you go?

96
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,871
I read once that
when a train hits,

97
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,807
it can rip the clothes
right off of you.

98
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,550
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks

99
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,154
the nanny job is gonna
make me less restless.

100
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,057
Make me want to get pregnant.

101
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,858
And that's not the case?

102
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:23,461
When I finish work every night,

103
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,463
I run home
and I get in the shower

104
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,832
and I wash the smell
of that baby off of me

105
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,834
as fast as I can.

106
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,612
Ah.

107
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,815
When you woke up this morning,

108
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:47,518
I went and I brought you
back to bed with me.

109
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,287
And when I was feeding you,

110
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:52,357
we heard daddy singing
from the kitchen, didn't we?

111
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,841
Aw, daddy came upstairs
with a beautiful breakfast

112
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,110
that he made for mommy,
didn't he?

113
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,012
Yes, he did.

114
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,513
Thank you, Megan.

115
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:16,948
Oh.

116
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,817
Whew... ah...

117
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,819
- There.
- -There you go.

118
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,354
Come here.

119
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,356
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Oh.

120
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,129
Oh, hello.

121
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:39,070
I swear, I sometimes feel like
my heart is gonna explode.

122
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,638
- I mean, look at her.

123
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,240
Look at her.

124
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,878
You're not sleeping.

125
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,248
Hello? -:
You're not sleeping.

126
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,583
Hello?

127
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,585
- Hello?

128
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,524
- Is that another hang-up?
- Mm-hmm.

129
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,492
<i>And grab the corners.</i>

130
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:03,928
Mm.

131
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,699
And straight.

132
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,768
I got another job.

133
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,170
You what?

134
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:14,972
I'm really sorry, Anna.

135
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:20,378
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.

136
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,913
I am.

137
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,083
It's just, this isn't what I do.

138
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,385
Take care of children?

139
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,454
Or laundry.

140
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,357
Another gallery headhunted me.

141
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,795
That's great.

142
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,964
The thing is,
it starts tomorrow.

143
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,034
I'm out all day tomorrow.

144
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,603
- That is so uncool.
- I hate to leave you like this

145
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,606
without child care, but...
You don't have a job.

146
00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:54,879
Okay, that sounded wrong.

147
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,781
I know that
you're busy volunteering.

148
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,816
It's not the volunteering.

149
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,551
It's all the shopping,

150
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,987
it's spending hours
in the farmers' market...

151
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,622
It's finding
the right foods for her,

152
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,057
it's pureeing sweet potatoes,

153
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,559
and I do all of this
at the same time...

154
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,394
As I'm nursing.

155
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,097
Maybe you should go
back to work, too.

156
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,500
Mothers need to work.

157
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,135
It's actually better
for the kid.

158
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,736
And how would you know?

159
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,813
Your key.

160
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,816
There's no job more important
than raising a child.

161
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,087
Megan, please. I...

162
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,180
- Rachel. What are you doing?

163
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,481
Give me my baby.

164
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,683
Rachel, what are you doing?

165
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,822
Hello?

166
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,564
Oh.

167
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,301
- Thank you.
- Here.

168
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,936
Mm. Beautiful.

169
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,642
How many times
has she texted you today?

170
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,844
I don't know.

171
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,880
She called the landline
three times.

172
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,682
Oh.

173
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,717
- You have to talk to her.
- I know. I-I...

174
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,052
It's getting crazy.

175
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,754
I will. I know, I know, I know.

176
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,123
- Okay.
- It's gonna be fine.

177
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,093
Isn't it always fine?

178
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,095
Don't I always make
everything fine?

179
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,231
Stop.

180
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,999
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.

181
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,435
Are you sure you don't want me
to take you out tonight?

182
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,170
- No, I like it at home.
- Call Megan.

183
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,138
Ask her to come back.

184
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,010
She just quit.

185
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,411
She what?

186
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,247
She just told me
she got another job.

187
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,249
Oh.

188
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,785
Shame. Thought you guys were
kind of a good team together.

189
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,887
Mm.

190
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,357
So did I.

191
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,948
Hey, it's tom.
Sorry I missed you.

192
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,683
- I'll get right back to you.

193
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,619
Hey, tom. It's me.

194
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,623
Uh, I just wanted
to wish mama a happy birthday.

195
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,226
- Happy birthday, mama.
- Rachel.

196
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,561
Jesus.

197
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,964
No, no, no, no, no.

198
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,632
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.

199
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,167
- Relax. Relax!
- Cathy, come on!

200
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,203
I just... I just need some
to go to sleep.

201
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,571
That's all.
I just need... I just...

202
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,473
I just need a little bit
to go to sleep.

203
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,942
What brought this on?

204
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,314
He posted another picture
of the baby.

205
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,182
- It was a cute picture.
- Yeah?

206
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,884
Yup.

207
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:30,087
Facebook and drunk ex-wives
do not make good friends.

208
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,824
I got it. I got it.

209
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,227
All right.
Let's get you to your room.

210
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:44,168
Rachel, you have to stop
calling them, okay?

211
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,708
I really appreciate this room.

212
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,877
I do.

213
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,614
I thought that
I would just be here for...

214
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,250
For a couple of weeks or months.

215
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,951
Yeah, that was two years ago.

216
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,357
Get some sleep.

217
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,290
I've rarely works
the first time.

218
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,026
Would you like a moment?

219
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:45,729
<i>It's okay, sweetie.</i>

220
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,465
We're gonna try again.

221
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,867
We can't afford to do it again.

222
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,904
Well, when we can, we will.

223
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,339
<i>I wonder what she's looking at.</i>

224
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,276
<i>Or if she even sees
this train at all.</i>

225
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,725
<i>Who is that man?</i>

226
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,737
The next
station is Ardsley-on-Hudson.

227
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,754
<i>What is she doing?</i>

228
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:01,865
<i>She's throwing it all away.</i>

229
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:35,833
<i>Anna, I fell asleep last night</i>

230
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,068
<i>thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing</i>

231
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,437
<i>the inside of your thighs
and holding your breasts.</i>

232
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,473
- <i>-God, I wish</i>

233
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,408
<i>I was fucking you right now.</i>

234
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,778
<i>Anna, I love you.</i>

235
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,947
<i>I love you so much.</i>

236
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,982
<i>When it happened to me,</i>

237
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,418
<i>I found dozens of e-mails.</i>

238
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,154
<i>Tom told her that he never
felt like this before.</i>

239
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,823
<i>He said it wouldn't be
that much longer</i>

240
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:03,027
<i>-until they were together.</i>

241
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,329
I know what they say,

242
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:08,766
and you shouldn't check
his e-mail.

243
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,201
It was stupid.

244
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,303
But when I, um...

245
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,606
When I saw
it was from the realtor,

246
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,342
I thought that it was just spam.

247
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:21,545
And then I realized that
they were kisses, not X's,

248
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,281
and my husband was fucking
a century 21 agent.

249
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,116
That sucks.

250
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,185
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd,

251
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,454
and he was in love with her.

252
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,793
Come here for one second.

253
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,862
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd,"
but just yell it, all right?

254
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,498
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

255
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:46,670
That bitch is living
in my house.

256
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,472
I picked everything
in that house.

257
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,874
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table,

258
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,876
the kitchen table.

259
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,079
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked tom

260
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:57,481
on the same table
that her baby eats at.

261
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,416
I just want to tell her.

262
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,487
Oh, I wish I could tell her.

263
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,155
I picked everything
in that house.

264
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,991
I fucking picked
everything in that house.

265
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,099
I...

266
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:18,368
I could never find the words
to describe how I felt

267
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,004
when I read that e-mail.

268
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,842
But this morning, I did.

269
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,910
I did.

270
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,379
When I saw that woman...

271
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,549
Kissing someone else, just...

272
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,018
I... betraying her husband,

273
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,188
I felt... I felt it.

274
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,458
I felt pure rage.

275
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:47,264
It was like something
had been taken from me again,

276
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:50,567
and... just thought
if I could...

277
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,037
If I could,
I'd just go to her house

278
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,806
and I'd go and...

279
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:58,609
Find her sitting
at the kitchen table,

280
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,077
and I'd just...

281
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,713
I'd wrap my hand
in her long blond hair,

282
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,114
and I'd jerk her head back.

283
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,083
I'd just jerk it back.

284
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,285
And then I'd pull it down
to the ground,

285
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:11,722
and I would just...
Smash her head

286
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,525
all over the floor!

287
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:12,149
Move! Get out of my way!

288
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,817
Move! Move.

289
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,472
Hey!

290
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,741
Hey!

291
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,521
You whore!

292
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,656
Jesus Christ, Rachel.

293
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,491
Uh, what the hell
is wrong with you?

294
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:06,029
I spent the past hour
driving around looking for you.

295
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,067
You... you scared
the shit out of Anna.

296
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,569
- Do you know that?

297
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,638
She thought you were gonna...

298
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,240
She-she wanted to call
the police, so just...

299
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,580
- Leave us alone.

300
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,615
You can ruin your own life
if you want to,

301
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,117
but you're not
gonna destroy ours.

302
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,753
I'm not gonna
protect you anymore.

303
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,258
Oh, my god.

304
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,227
God.

305
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:39,930
God.

306
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,847
Rachel?

307
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,115
Open the door.

308
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,851
Cathy, I just...
I just need a sec.

309
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,853
Are you okay?

310
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,222
Rachel, open the door.

311
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,790
I have a stomach flu.

312
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,625
- Okay? I just...
- You don't have a flu.

313
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,061
What the fuck, Rachel?

314
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,329
I'm not stupid!

315
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:14,297
Rachel!

316
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,699
Cathy, just go away!

317
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,577
Come here for one second.

318
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,479
Just one second.

319
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,981
- Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."

320
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,417
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

321
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,325
- You whore!

322
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:27,871
No!

323
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,156
<i>Anyone counting days one to 90,</i>

324
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:49,126
who would like
to share a day count?

325
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,894
Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.

326
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,662
- Welcome, Jason.
- I've got 22 days back.

327
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,664
- Nice.
- There we go. -Good job.

328
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,435
Anyone else?

329
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,943
Hi. I'm-I'm Rachel and...

330
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,411
Welcome, Rachel.

331
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,247
- Hi, Rachel.
- And this... thank you.

332
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,649
This is day one, I-I suppose.

333
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,765
Um...

334
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,234
I'm here because I...

335
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,640
because I...

336
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:39,276
Because I woke up,
um, covered in blood.

337
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:45,715
And I had... I had bruises
all over my arm and, um...

338
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,052
It's usually from
when I've fallen

339
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:51,054
and someone's helped me up.

340
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,293
My husband...

341
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:59,596
He used to tell me
what I'd done the night before.

342
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:05,168
And I learned,
when you wake up like that,

343
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,703
you just say you're sorry.

344
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:13,243
You just say you're sorry
for what you did

345
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:15,378
and you're sorry
for who you are,

346
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,914
and you're never
gonna do it again.

347
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,283
But you do. You do it again.

348
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:24,054
And there's some time missing.

349
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,058
I need to remember.

350
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,396
I need to remember.

351
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,731
Okay.

352
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:36,433
Thank you, Rachel.

353
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:43,173
Am I... am I right?

354
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,508
- Or am I nuts?
- No.

355
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,044
Make an effort!
You know, we all worked hard.

356
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,213
That was a charity event.

357
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,582
- You don't wear that.
- No, you don't.

358
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:55,552
Right? It was that,
um, the homeless thing.

359
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:56,786
I don't remember
what it was called.

360
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,221
Oh, oh, safe shelter.

361
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,557
Yeah.
That was a tube top, right?

362
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,758
Yup. It was.

363
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,059
I can't.

364
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,028
Why say, "yes, I'm gonna go,

365
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,529
"and I can't wait because

366
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,365
it's fun to dress up."
Then dress up.

367
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,866
<i>Do you like
devil's eggs, Martha?</i>

368
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,901
Deviled eggs? Yeah, I do.

369
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,204
- Deviled egg.
- Thank you for making them.

370
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,974
The classics. Do you want
to try one, anybody?

371
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,443
Uh, those go outside. I don't
want the eggs with the dessert.

372
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,045
It doesn't fucking matter
where they go, okay?

373
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,080
So do you want to put them
here? Do you want them

374
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,482
with your hot dogs
or you can put a couple

375
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,250
with your quinoa if you want to.

376
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,152
Do you want to put them with
your other salad and your corn?

377
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:30,820
- Rachel.
- Put a couple on the wall?

378
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,055
Rachel.

379
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,556
I'm fine, tom!

380
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,158
- Stop it.
- Come on.

381
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,993
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.

382
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,628
You never have my back.

383
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,497
- That's my boss's wife.

384
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,098
Probably got me fired
back there.

385
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,634
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.

386
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,569
- I'm your wife and you never...
- Rachel.

387
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,505
- You never fucking support me.
- Rachel, please stop it.

388
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,974
Hey, come on.
Need you to focus here.

389
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,142
<i>Don't fucking talk</i>

390
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:53,276
- to me like that!
- Relax!

391
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,511
Relax!

392
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,826
- Rachel.
- Hi, Cathy. I'm sorry.

393
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,261
- There you are.
- I need to get my shit together.

394
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,829
- I'm s...
- Shh.

395
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:15,598
You must be Ms. Watson.

396
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,167
I'm detective Riley.

397
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:19,169
This is detective Gaskill.

398
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,037
We need to ask you
a few questions.

399
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,939
What's this about?

400
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,774
Want to sit down?

401
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,382
Can you tell me
where you were Friday night?

402
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,590
I-I was at work
in the city, and then...

403
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,994
and then I went
to visit my husband.

404
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,696
You mean your ex-husband?

405
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:48,998
Yeah.

406
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,467
So I got off the train

407
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,835
at Ardsley-on-Hudson,

408
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,837
and then...

409
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,172
And then I decided
that it was a bad idea.

410
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,842
Around what time
did you reach that conclusion?

411
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:01,478
I was back here by 11:00.

412
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,547
Yeah. Yeah.

413
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,584
On your way back here,
did you stop anywhere?

414
00:33:09,186 --> 00:33:10,687
No.

415
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:13,156
And what time did you
take the train there?

416
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,724
Um, 6:00. I...

417
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,326
So...

418
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,528
What'd you do
during those hours in Ardsley,

419
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,330
if you weren't seeing
your ex-husband?

420
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,075
Do you remember
seeing this woman?

421
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,844
She worked for your ex-husband.

422
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,679
She's gone missing.

423
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,114
What do you mean, she's missing?

424
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,116
Well, her husband said
she never came back home

425
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,986
the same night you got off
the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson.

426
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:46,456
I was just... I was just...

427
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,891
Do you know Megan Hipwell?

428
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:49,359
- No!
- Did you see her?

429
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,860
No, I don't...
I don't think so.

430
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,129
Is that because
you were inebriated?

431
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:57,434
Just to clarify, you said
you were at work Friday?

432
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:00,437
Are you referring to your job
in public relations?

433
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,871
Right.

434
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,273
It's my understanding
you were fired

435
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,774
from that job over a year ago

436
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,010
because of
your drinking problem.

437
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,558
Okay. That's enough for now.

438
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,931
If you're able
to remember anything else,

439
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:30,433
give us a call.

440
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,002
Did you really get fired?

441
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,604
Look, I didn't want you to worry

442
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:36,339
that I couldn't pay the rent.

443
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:39,108
If you don't have a job,
then what do you do every day?

444
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,945
I...

445
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:44,113
I-I ride the train.

446
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,815
You what?

447
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,985
I ride the train
to New York and back.

448
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,920
That's what
your alimony's paying for,

449
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,290
just tickets to nowhere?

450
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,292
That's really fucking weird,
Rachel.

451
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,327
O-okay, okay.

452
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:03,533
I just, I-I got on the train,

453
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,603
and then... and then I...
I got off the train.

454
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,838
I don't know.
It's-it's very unclear.

455
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,007
You don't remember anything,
do you?

456
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,712
You know, I read about this man
in long island...

457
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,680
Who blacked out.

458
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,716
He left a bar,

459
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,885
drove to the house
that he'd grown up in,

460
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,486
stabbed its occupants to death.

461
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,288
<i>He woke up the next morning,</i>

462
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,824
oblivious to what he did
until the police

463
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,292
<i>came to get him.</i>

464
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,727
- Rachel!
- What? What?

465
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,029
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.

466
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:35,965
- I'll give you a few weeks...
- Hold on.

467
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,201
Hold on.

468
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:39,736
Detective Riley!

469
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,672
- Yeah, I agree with you.
- Detective Riley!

470
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,308
I saw someone
with Megan Hipwell,

471
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,876
but, uh, not on Friday night.

472
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,711
She...

473
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,514
She was having an affair,
she had a lover... that's what

474
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:54,150
- I'm trying to tell you.
- I thought you didn't know her.

475
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,885
No. But I s... but I saw her.

476
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,354
- You saw her where?
- I-I saw her from the train.

477
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,590
She was standing on-on the deck
with this man.

478
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,725
- With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
- No, it wasn't him.

479
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,694
This... man was different,

480
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:06,663
and th-they were...
They were kissing.

481
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,332
Wow. That's pretty
coincidental, isn't it?

482
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:12,602
You just happen to be on a train

483
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,604
at the same exact moment
that a woman you don't know,

484
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,573
but somehow recognize,
is cheating on her husband?

485
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:18,341
I-I know it sounds crazy.
Um...

486
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,109
Neighbors saw a drunk woman

487
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:23,379
in the vicinity of her house
Friday night.

488
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:26,416
Megan Hipwell does bear
a resemblance to Anna Watson.

489
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,085
Mrs. Watson reported

490
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:32,021
that you go to their house
sometimes uninvited,

491
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,923
and that on one occasion
you actually broke in

492
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,425
and took their child.

493
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,629
Let me give you some advice.

494
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,464
Don't go back to Beckett road.

495
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,733
Don't contact your ex-husband.

496
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:46,035
Don't go anywhere near
Anna Watson or her baby.

497
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,737
Are you listening to me?

498
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,039
Yes.

499
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,276
You don't live there anymore.

500
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:55,278
Stay away.

501
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,222
<i>You know, I lie all the time.</i>

502
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,427
I lie to Scott.

503
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:14,797
I lie to you.

504
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,800
I mean, I know that's not
the point of therapy, but...

505
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,438
I have to keep things vague.

506
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,908
Jumble up all the men
and the exes, the lovers.

507
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:31,114
It doesn't matter who they are.

508
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:34,684
It matters
how they make me feel.

509
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,260
Lying is like taking a trip.

510
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,970
It's like having a secret.

511
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:57,373
It's like touching yourself
and no one else knows.

512
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,317
Except you.

513
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,787
But you're just pretending.

514
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:17,293
You're just pretending
to touch yourself.

515
00:38:27,037 --> 00:38:30,273
Scott's possessive, jealous.

516
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,644
He likes to own me.

517
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,749
He figures out all my passwords.

518
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:44,721
Which is kind of sexy.

519
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,030
So, when I came home last night,

520
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:58,501
Scott was on my laptop,
wondering why...

521
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,936
Scott's behavior is not normal.

522
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,107
It's a form of emotional abuse.

523
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,611
Are you ever afraid of Scott?

524
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,382
It's not abuse.

525
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,952
Not if you don't care,
and I don't.

526
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:19,021
Maybe it's become
a normal state for you.

527
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,627
Is it normal I think about you
all the time?

528
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,239

Yes. Rachel.

542
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,662
Come in.

543
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,535
- Do you want a coffee?
- Uh, sure. Thank you.

544
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:47,877
Sorry it's a mess.

545
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:50,279
I've been hunting for her
social, her birth certificate.

546
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,781
And the cops need a lot.

547
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,286
Have we met somewhere before?

548
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,522
I... I don't think so.

549
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:00,823
And you know Megan from...?

550
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,825
Uh, from the gallery.

551
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,026
Oh, you're an artist?

552
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,863
Uh, well, I like to think so.

553
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,669
So, you said on the phone

554
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,639
you wanted to tell me
something about Megan.

555
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:21,010
What did you want to tell me?

556
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,746
I saw your wife...

557
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:26,315
With someone...

558
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,050
On Friday morning.

559
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,252
With who?

560
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:31,854
She was up there on your porch.

561
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,590
Um... I saw her from the train,

562
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:38,361
because I commute
to Manhattan every day

563
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:40,763
and I go straight past here.

564
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,770
She kissed him.

565
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,941
They were kissing.

566
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,613
I'm sorry.

567
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,316
I know this is
a terrible thing to hear.

568
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,953
Yeah.

569
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,424
I know how it feels.

570
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:12,962
What did he look like?

571
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:18,968
He-he was...
He was average height.

572
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,536
He had dark hair.

573
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,206
And they were out there
on the porch?

574
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,975
Yes.

575
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,783
Fuck.

576
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,325
Fuck.

577
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,865
Oh, no, no, no. Thank you.

578
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,837
Okay, sure.

579
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:02,345
Uh, it could... I-I don't know.

580
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:04,747
Maybe it's a good thing.

581
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,450
Could mean she's all right.

582
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:10,086
She just ran off with someone.

583
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,088
Right.

584
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,496
Has she talked to you?

585
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:21,697
Oh, no, n...

586
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,332
Um, I haven't heard anything.

587
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,268
But you know her well enough
to know where we live.

588
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,037
Megan doesn't have many friends.

589
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:33,209
Well, I used to live nearby,
and, um, she and I,

590
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:36,612
we took... we took yog...
We took Pilates... together.

591
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,447
I-I think I should go.

592
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,317
I feel like I've taken up
too much of your time, and...

593
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,020
So sorry
to have had to tell you...

594
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:45,521
Tell you that in that way and...

595
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:48,290
Hey.

596
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,127
Do you think you'd recognize
him again if you saw him?

597
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,463
I don't know.

598
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,699
There's a guy. A therapist.

599
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,202
His name's, um, ab...

600
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,571
Abdic... Abdic.

601
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:08,244
Uh, Kamal... Abdic.

602
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,649
Is that who you saw?

603
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,751
I don't know.

604
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,220
I really can't tell.

605
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,956
She spends a lot of
fucking time with her shrink.

606
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,538
<i>That's him.</i>

607
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,541
I remember. That's him.

608
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:40,076
I remember.
That's him.

609
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,588
I'm sorry.

610
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,424
<i>Where are you? Where are you?</i>

611
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:59,361
Where are you?

612
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,731
Where are you?

613
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:37,500
Stay away from me!

614
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:39,301
<i>This is so stupid.</i>

615
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:42,505
He makes every conversation
about getting pregnant.

616
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,941
And every time we go there...

617
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,643
Where?

618
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:50,079
To that subject.

619
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,214
What subject?

620
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,186
Megan.

621
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,854
What subject?

622
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,007
It's okay.

623
00:46:21,144 --> 00:46:23,045
- Megan.

624
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:25,314
No!

625
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:29,485
Megan.

626
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,522
All right, Megan.

627
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,528
We shouldn't.

628
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,298
No.

629
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,632
Megan.

630
00:46:45,368 --> 00:46:48,571
Don't make it impossible
for us to work together.

631
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,178
Meg...

632
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,447
Megan, I could lose my practice.

633
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,917
I don't give a fuck!

634
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:04,920
I don't give a fuck
about your fucking practice!

635
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,523

00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,100
<i>I do.</i>

649
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:53,035
Yeah!

650
00:47:55,905 --> 00:47:57,640
<i>Just not quite yet.</i>

651
00:48:05,548 --> 00:48:07,650
Hi.

652
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:09,084
What's wrong?

653
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,086
Abdic's been released.

654
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,622
- What?
- There wasn't enough evidence.

655
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:17,059
And because I'm the one that
got him arrested, he talked.

656
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,061
A lot.

657
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,929
They'll... they'll build a case
against him.

658
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,731
It'll just take some time.

659
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,900
Are you totally sure he's
the guy you saw Megan with?

660
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,035
Yes.

661
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:28,971
You sure as fuck better be.

662
00:48:28,973 --> 00:48:30,606
I don't understand.

663
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:32,441
- The police think I did it.
- Yeah, but he's...

664
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,777
- He's the one...
- He told them Megan's miserable.

665
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:38,580
That I'm a jealous,
controlling husband.

666
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:42,117
I'm sure that they're just...
Trying to rule you out.

667
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,154
Abdic told them I'm abusive.

668
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:49,992
When she walked out,
I... I didn't go after her.

669
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:52,094
I never called to check on her.

670
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,332
I went to a sports bar,
for fuck's sake.

671
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:57,599
Got drunk.

672
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,501
No, we j...
We just need to find

673
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:01,003
more evidence on Abdic.

674
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:03,172
I've spent the whole day
going through her stuff.

675
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:05,274
There's no e-mails.
There's nothing.

676
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,709
No letters, no e-mails.

677
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:08,344
Nothing.

678
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:11,914
For a second, I thought about
contacting Abdic myself.

679
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:16,952
- Fucking phone won't stop!

680
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:19,788
This is Scott.

681
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,990
Yeah, yeah.
H-hold on, hold on.

682
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,826
Do you mind?

683
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,640
Oh. Come here.

684
00:49:49,085 --> 00:49:51,553
Oh, you're heavy. You're heavy.

685
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,722
- You're getting a little fatty.
- Rachel, no.

686
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,224
Anna, get in the house.

687
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,869
Your-your... your wife hit me
on Friday night!

688
00:50:06,871 --> 00:50:08,170
No. What are you talking about?

689
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,038
Yes. Yes, yes, you did.
Yes, you did!

690
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,876
And then sh... and then she...
She-she got in your car.

691
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:16,345
No. She said you yelled at her
that night.

692
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:17,946
No, that is not what happened.

693
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:20,349
She was... she was in
the tunnel, and she-she hit me.

694
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,050
I don't want to argue
in the street.

695
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,786
The middle of the day
and you're drunk.

696
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:25,254
Look, I'm not drunk, tom.

697
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,793
My wife is scared of you.

698
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:32,528
Of what?

699
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:36,532
I don't even know
if that's a joke or not.

700
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,567
- Let's start with child abduction.
- That's bullshit.

701
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:40,102
You know that's not
how it happened.

702
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:42,805
You and I both know
what you're capable of.

703
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:50,212
Were you just
at Scott Hipwell's house?

704
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,918
Why are you at
Scott Hipwell's house?

705
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,486
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.

706
00:50:57,488 --> 00:50:58,921
- How?
- To try and find Megan.

707
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:01,223
You don't even know Megan.

708
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,327
Rach...

709
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:08,330
I don't think
you're helping anybody.

710
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,101
<i>So you're here because you want</i>

711
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,970
to uncover lost memories.

712
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:17,406
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.

713
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,740
Pardon?

714
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,275
No, sorry, I-I, um,

715
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,978
wasn't expecting you
to have an accent.

716
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,847
Well, you have an accent.

717
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,485
Where are you from?

718
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:31,620
I'm an American citizen.

719
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:33,922
But I guess you're not here
to talk about me.

720
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,958
- Unless you are.
- No, no, I...

721
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,161
Sorry, I was just, uh, just
trying to make conversation.

722
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:41,363
The blackouts.

723
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:43,165
You're experiencing blackouts?

724
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:44,466
Mm-hmm.

725
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,568
Do you want to tell me
about them?

726
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,840
Mm...

727
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,877
Well, when I...

728
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:58,514
Wake up, and when someone
tells me what I've done...

729
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,552
it just doesn't feel like me

730
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:05,988
or like something
that I would do.

731
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,790
I feel bad about it, but, um...

732
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,393
But it's like
it's so far removed,

733
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:13,395
that I have a...

734
00:52:15,698 --> 00:52:17,699
I just don't feel bad enough.

735
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,635
And you want to take
personal responsibility

736
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,637
for what you've done,
but you find it difficult

737
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,806
to feel accountable because
you can't even remember it.

738
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,478
Yeah?

739
00:52:30,813 --> 00:52:32,414
Yeah.

740
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:35,050
So, Rachel, besides drinking...

741
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:39,187
Because you clearly drink.

742
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,456
You've been drinking today,
haven't you?

743
00:52:48,197 --> 00:52:51,333
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?

744
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,937
I like to draw. Art.

745
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:56,772
I guess.

746
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:58,206
Good. We can try to...

747
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,075
Regain some of your memories
by drawing them.

748
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:02,377
I've tried it. It doesn't work.

749
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:04,246
And have you ever tracked
all the way back

750
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:05,781
to when you started
drinking heavily?

751
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:09,451
When was that?

752
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,589
It was with tom.

753
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:16,391
When I couldn't get pregnant.

754
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,393
Who's tom?

755
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,462
He's my ex-husband.

756
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:22,297
You want to talk about that?

757
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,335
I really wanted a baby.

758
00:53:35,144 --> 00:53:38,046
And we tried everything,
and nothing worked.

759
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,852
And it just absolutely...

760
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,266
It just broke my...

761
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:01,336
My heart, and...

762
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,672
So it got really sad.

763
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:05,574
And then, um...

764
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:11,246
and then the-the booze
just, uh, broke us.

765
00:54:12,982 --> 00:54:15,017
Good.

766
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:16,385
Tell me more.

767
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:24,593
I used to watch
this perfect couple.

768
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:30,198
And they were just the...

769
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,634
Embodiment of...

770
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,302
True love.

771
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:37,506
It's like the kind of love
you always want.

772
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,745
And then she betrayed him.

773
00:54:49,385 --> 00:54:51,586
And it sparked something in me.

774
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,894
Why are you really here, Rachel?

775
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:02,531
Because I'm afraid of myself.

776
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:12,974
<i>July 5th.</i>

777
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,677
<i>1:33 and 1:34.</i>

778
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,813
<i>1:37.</i>

779
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,181
She calls again 1:38.

780
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:21,883
And then she calls again
at 1:44, 1:45,

781
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,752
2:15 P.M.

782
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:25,887
And July 6th.
You get the point.

783
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:29,725
She sometimes texted him
dozens of times a day.

784
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:32,227
But these are all
from an unknown number.

785
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:34,596
- Mm, and unknown is Rachel.
- You have a log

786
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:36,364
of the calls;
You don't have a log

787
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:37,933
of what they're saying
to each other.

788
00:55:39,535 --> 00:55:42,704
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house

789
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:45,173
- since the incident with your child?
- Not that I know of.

790
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,742
Well, then you may have a case

791
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:48,410
for harassment
in the second degree,

792
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:50,252
but these are texts,
they're not threats, so...

793
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:54,349
She has been hanging around
Scott Hipwell's house.

794
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,751
A lot.

795
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,886
Yeah, I'm aware.

796
00:55:57,888 --> 00:56:00,055
There are a lot
of loose ends here

797
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:02,524
that suggest something,
but they don't add up to much.

798
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:05,393
If you could bring me
something more solid...

799
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,596
What more do you need?

800
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:08,897
Evidence.

801
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:10,866
Real evidence.

802
00:56:15,938 --> 00:56:17,606
You sure your husband

803
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:19,808
doesn't want to stay in touch
with his ex-wife?

804
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,209
What? No.

805
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,744
She's harassing us.

806
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,146
Is that what he calls it?

807
00:57:07,356 --> 00:57:09,558
Hi.

808
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:17,265
- Hey.
- Hi.

809
00:57:50,399 --> 00:57:51,800
Hi.

810
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,401
Reporters are in my yard.

811
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:54,803
They're everywhere.

812
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,838
I didn't know where else to go.

813
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,440
Come in.

814
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:11,820
The detective just...

815
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:16,358
The detective
just told me something

816
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,760
I've wanted to hear
for a long time.

817
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,267
She's pregnant.

818
00:58:26,535 --> 00:58:29,938
She told her shrink but not me.

819
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,777
I wanted a family.

820
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:38,680
But she fought me
every step of the way.

821
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,350
We always fought about it.

822
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:47,289
Did Megan ever say anything
about me to you?

823
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:58,033
She loved you.

824
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,804
She loved you in ways

825
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:06,441
that people only dream
of being loved.

826
01:00:07,803 --> 01:00:09,904
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

827
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,344
I just...

828
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:19,180
I need to tell someone.

829
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:21,116
Just once.

830
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:24,519
Just say it out loud.

831
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:26,254
I want to tell you.

832
01:00:29,558 --> 01:00:32,293
And then I'll be gone.

833
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,262
I swear.

834
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,537
I got pregnant.

835
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:48,376
I was 17.

836
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:51,279
I had her by myself.

837
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:58,953
She had dark eyes
and blond hair.

838
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:07,395
I expected it to be hard,
but it wasn't.

839
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:14,169
It was easy.

840
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:18,106
Because I loved her.

841
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:20,608
I loved her.

842
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:26,181
We called her Elizabeth.

843
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,083
Libby.

844
01:01:29,753 --> 01:01:32,187
Libby.

845
01:01:38,095 --> 01:01:40,528
It was December.

846
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,498
We had gotten in a fight,
me and Mac.

847
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:49,571
He'd gone off
and... and left.

848
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:53,708
<i>The roof was leaking.</i>

849
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,312
<i>It was freezing cold, so...</i>

850
01:01:57,314 --> 01:02:00,448
<i>I got in the tub.</i>

851
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,118
<i>I brought Libby in with me.</i>

852
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,387
<i>Put her on my chest.</i>

853
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,791
Her head just... under my chin.

854
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,068
I fell asleep.

855
01:02:26,108 --> 01:02:27,842
<i>I let her go.</i>

856
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:30,912
<i>I let her go.</i>

857
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,982
I let her go.

858
01:02:35,484 --> 01:02:36,985
I let her go.

859
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,756
<i>I...</i>

860
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,224
<i>I couldn't look.</i>

861
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,528
<i>I didn't want to see it.</i>

862
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:48,897
<i>I didn't want to see it.</i>

863
01:02:53,135 --> 01:02:55,303
I wrapped her in a blanket,

864
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:58,206
and I buried her.

865
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,523
And...

866
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,161
Mac went out that night...

867
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:26,067
and he never came back.

868
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,338
He never came back.

869
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,893
I missed our home.

870
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:03,004
So one day, when I was drunk,

871
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,640
<i>I decided to go there.</i>

872
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:13,181
<i>The front door was open;
It's not like I broke in.</i>

873
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:28,263
<i>And then I heard Evie.</i>

874
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:31,933
<i>Who's Evie?</i>

875
01:04:31,935 --> 01:04:34,135
<i>Tom's baby.</i>

876
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:57,959
<i>And I know this sounds...</i>

877
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:01,062
<i>Insane...</i>

878
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,464
<i>But I just wanted to hold her.</i>

879
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,370
<i>Just for a moment.</i>

880
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:37,965
Rachel.

881
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,869
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

882
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:43,705
Rachel...

883
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:55,650
Give her to me.

884
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:57,819
Shh, shh, shh.

885
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:59,654
Oh. Mommy's here.

886
01:05:59,656 --> 01:06:02,990
- Shh. Oh.

887
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:05,393
Shh.

888
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:09,731
<i>I wasn't going to hurt her.</i>

889
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,768
<i>I would never hurt her.</i>

890
01:06:18,173 --> 01:06:20,141
I just wanted to hold her.

891
01:06:44,366 --> 01:06:46,901
<i>"Partially decomposed
body found.</i>

892
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:49,437
<i>"Female body found. Death a
result of blunt force trauma.</i>

893
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:51,572
<i>"Blunt force trauma, partially
decomposed body found...</i>

894
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:52,840
<i>"Megan Hipwell,
blunt force trauma,</i>

895
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,442
<i>"partially decomposed...</i>

896
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:56,577
<i>"The investigation now
being called a homicide.</i>

897
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:59,580
<i>"Sources say the partially
decomposed body found</i>

898
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:01,749
<i>"is missing Ardsley woman
Megan Hipwell.</i>

899
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,419
<i>"Death a result
of blunt force trauma.</i>

900
01:07:04,421 --> 01:07:08,189
<i>Megan Hipwell's investigation
now being called a homicide."</i>

901
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,324
- Mr. Hipwell!

902
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,668
What's wrong?

903
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:56,504
I'm sorry.

904
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,294
This reminds me of when I used
to watch you getting dressed

905
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:21,762
before going back to her.

906
01:08:28,036 --> 01:08:30,037
Back to this house.

907
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:36,143
I actually miss being
the other woman.

908
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:38,145
Did you enjoy
cheating on Rachel?

909
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:41,048
Seriously?

910
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,584
Can we not fixate on her?

911
01:08:44,953 --> 01:08:46,954
I saw her again today.

912
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,689
Where?

913
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:50,791
This afternoon, when the police
brought Scott back home.

914
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,193
She was across the street.

915
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:59,166
And when she saw me,
she got aggressive.

916
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,302
Aggressive how?

917
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,971
What if Rachel killed Megan?

918
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,907
Rachel did not kill Megan.

919
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:07,675
Then why is she creeping
around Scott's house?

920
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:09,744
- She's dangerous, and you know it.
- Anna, Anna.

921
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:13,381
Sweetheart...
Rachel is a sad person.

922
01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:16,417
She's completely harmless.

923
01:09:43,111 --> 01:09:45,046
What are you doing here?

924
01:09:45,048 --> 01:09:47,081
How di... how did you get in?

925
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,087
Come here.

926
01:09:53,089 --> 01:09:54,755
Have a beer with me.

927
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:58,292
Uh, I'm-I'm not drinking
right now.

928
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:06,634
Detective Riley
came to see me last night.

929
01:10:08,036 --> 01:10:11,706
It turns out,
I'm not the father.

930
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,375
Neither is the shrink.

931
01:10:16,144 --> 01:10:19,213
Did my wife confide in you
about a third man?

932
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,218
Sit down.

933
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,358
Sit down!

934
01:10:32,894 --> 01:10:35,429
Look, I don't know, I don't
know what this is about...

935
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:36,731
Oh, come on.

936
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:39,333
You and Megan
were such good friends.

937
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:43,137
You must've known.

938
01:10:44,606 --> 01:10:46,340
Admit it.

939
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:48,275
Admit what?

940
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:51,145
Admit that you never even
fucking met my wife.

941
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:56,884
The detective said
you didn't even know Megan.

942
01:10:59,187 --> 01:11:01,589
She used other words, too.

943
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,791
Alcoholic.

944
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:05,326
Maybe even mentally unstable.

945
01:11:05,328 --> 01:11:06,794
I am sorry.

946
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,529
I was honestly just
trying to help you.

947
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:13,000
You're tom's crazy ex.

948
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:15,436
When the fuck were you
gonna tell me that, huh?

949
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,872
And now the detective
is asking if you and I are

950
01:11:17,874 --> 01:11:18,973
in a relationship?

951
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:20,474
You?

952
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:24,178
I would never even
get near someone like you!

953
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,713
My wife is dead.

954
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:29,183
And you're lying to me!

955
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:31,385
What's wrong with you?

956
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,987
- Who does this?
- I needed to tell you

957
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:34,188
about Megan's affair,

958
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:35,456
and you wouldn't
have believed me

959
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,791
if I was just tom's ex!

960
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,659
Oh, well, thank you, you know?

961
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:41,295
For getting Abdic
to point the finger at me.

962
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,598
For getting the cops to say
that you and I are fucking!

963
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:53,040
How are they going, huh?

964
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:55,710
You know, the sessions.

965
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:00,214
With the doctor.

966
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,685
I wanted to know about Abdic.

967
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,721
And I-I went to him
to help you...

968
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,224
You're just a sad liar
with no life.

969
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,227
- You're all liars.
- Please...

970
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:34,949
I need to file a statement.

971
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:35,950
Name.

972
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:37,084
Rachel Watson.

973
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:39,453
Pete, I got this.

974
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:54,368
You wanted to file a statement?

975
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,137
I'm listening.

976
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:58,806
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.

977
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:02,309
You mean your new boyfriend,
Scott Hipwell?

978
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:04,745
No, we-we were just friends.

979
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,547
But that's what you wanted,
isn't it?

980
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,415
I mean, you got him
to stay overnight

981
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:09,583
- at your apartment, right?
- No, you-you...

982
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:11,285
You need the context...

983
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:13,587
I know the context, but
what I'm trying to determine

984
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:16,257
is when your obsession
with Mr. Hipwell began.

985
01:13:16,259 --> 01:13:19,093
Was it before or after
his pregnant wife was murdered?

986
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:21,829
I mean, you were neighbors
at one point.

987
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:22,963
I met him after.

988
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,999
After being questioned by me,

989
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:27,601
you befriend another even more
obvious suspect than yourself,

990
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:30,504
and then you manage to get him
to incriminate himself,

991
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:32,740
all the while
hoping he'll fuck you.

992
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:35,242
I came here trying to help you!

993
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,312
He just assaulted me
in my own house!

994
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:42,516
You were seen
in the area that night.

995
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,985
There are several hours

996
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:47,288
that you say
you can't account for.

997
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:50,324
It was Scott.
Scott Hipwell killed his wife.

998
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:52,359
No, he didn't.

999
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,997
Surveillance footage
from a sports bar

1000
01:13:56,999 --> 01:14:00,401
accounts for Mr. Hipwell's
whereabouts that night.

1001
01:14:02,003 --> 01:14:05,406
You're lying. You're lying.

1002
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,679
Tell me what happened.

1003
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,285
It's okay.

1004
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,621
Tell me.

1005
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,859
I don't know.

1006
01:14:24,861 --> 01:14:28,262
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?

1007
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:46,380
Hi.

1008
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:50,484
I need to see you.

1009
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,453
Can you please come over?

1010
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:08,369
<i>I can still see her dark eyes.</i>

1011
01:15:08,371 --> 01:15:10,671
<i>I can smell her skin.</i>

1012
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:14,308
<i>I can feel how cold she was.</i>

1013
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:17,244
Forgive yourself.

1014
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:31,425
You don't have to be afraid
of being alone.

1015
01:15:34,729 --> 01:15:36,697
You're not alone.

1016
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:54,848
The next
station is Ardsley-on-Hudson.

1017
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:05,292
You'll be fine.

1018
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,194
You and your baby will be fine.

1019
01:16:48,436 --> 01:16:50,371
Why are you following me?

1020
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:52,840
Why are you here?

1021
01:16:52,842 --> 01:16:54,375
Uh...

1022
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:56,610
I could ask you
the same question.

1023
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,645
I saw you.

1024
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,481
I saw you that night
in the tunnel.

1025
01:17:00,483 --> 01:17:01,949
I saw you there.

1026
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:04,284
- And I-I know I saw you there.
- All right.

1027
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,552
Lady, I live here.

1028
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:08,188
I'm always in that tunnel.

1029
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,724
But-but what did you,
what did you see?

1030
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,292
What happened that night?

1031
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:13,527
What did you see?

1032
01:17:13,529 --> 01:17:14,895
All right, you, uh...

1033
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:16,196
You busted your ass.

1034
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:17,664
You fell.

1035
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:20,167
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.

1036
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:22,703
You told me to fuck off,
so I fucked off.

1037
01:17:22,705 --> 01:17:24,038
Was I with anyone?

1038
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,706
- Was I, was I alone?

1039
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:27,041
Was i... what happened?

1040
01:17:27,043 --> 01:17:29,009
I don't know.

1041
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:30,577
You were wasted.

1042
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:33,180
You're always wasted.

1043
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:36,383
That's all I can tell you.

1044
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:37,918
Whoa, take it easy.

1045
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,756
I need you to tell me
the fucking truth.

1046
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:44,658
What did you see that night?

1047
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:48,395
What happened that night?

1048
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:50,831
Uh... I don't know.

1049
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:54,635
I'm assuming it's the worst.

1050
01:17:59,707 --> 01:18:01,675
God.

1051
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:06,447
Come here for one second.

1052
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:08,215
Just one second.

1053
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:10,017
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."

1054
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,386
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

1055
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:14,922
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked tom on the...

1056
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:19,760
When I saw that woman

1057
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:22,763
kissing someone else,
betraying her husband,

1058
01:18:22,765 --> 01:18:25,232
<i>I felt it.</i>

1059
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:27,134
<i>Pure rage.</i>

1060
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:30,037
<i>If I could, I'd go to her house,</i>

1061
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:31,972
<i>-I'd find her sitting and...</i>

1062
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:34,942
<i>I'd smash her head</i>

1063
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:38,178
all over the floor!

1064
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,657
<i>Cathy,</i>

1065
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:52,826
<i>thank you for all
you have done for me.</i>

1066
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:54,595
<i>I'm sorry to leave this way.</i>

1067
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:56,597
<i>I'll send for my things later.</i>

1068
01:18:56,599 --> 01:18:57,998
<i>Love, Rachel.</i>

1069
01:19:18,753 --> 01:19:22,456
That's so true.

1070
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,525
It's the worst restaurant ever.

1071
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:26,593
Why do we keep going back?

1072
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,262
Martha.

1073
01:19:29,764 --> 01:19:30,764
Martha.

1074
01:19:31,799 --> 01:19:34,635
Rachel?

1075
01:19:34,637 --> 01:19:36,637
Wow, I haven't seen you
in a million years.

1076
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:38,772
Um...

1077
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,707
Yeah, I-I wanted to call you,

1078
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:43,677
um, but tom said I should
just leave it alone.

1079
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,379
- Oh.
- Um...

1080
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:48,382
I'm so sorry.

1081
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:49,683
For what?

1082
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:52,019
For the barbecue.

1083
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:54,354
And I just need you to know

1084
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:57,291
that I-I don't remember
anything and, um,

1085
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:58,992
I just completely blacked out.

1086
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:00,661
Everyone had a little
too much to drink,

1087
01:20:00,663 --> 01:20:02,196
- so it's okay.
- I know, but, uh,

1088
01:20:02,198 --> 01:20:04,998
with the eggs
and then I-I screamed at you.

1089
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,302
That I was that abusive,
I just feel...

1090
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:11,238
I just feel so ashamed about it.

1091
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,472
Um...

1092
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,142
I don't...

1093
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:18,979
Tom... tom said that, um...

1094
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:20,714
That I smashed your plate.

1095
01:20:20,716 --> 01:20:22,149
I don't...

1096
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:24,918
Tom was fired...
Fired because of how I behaved.

1097
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:30,190
You felt sick and you took
a nap in our guest bedroom.

1098
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:31,892
<i>You want to lie down?</i>

1099
01:20:31,894 --> 01:20:33,894
- Come with me.
- Okay.

1100
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:37,531
Excuse us.

1101
01:20:37,533 --> 01:20:39,600
Rachel, are you feeling better?

1102
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:41,735
You guys can
stay tonight if you want.

1103
01:20:41,737 --> 01:20:43,370
- No, no. That's fine, thanks.
- Okay.

1104
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:44,771
<i>I think I'd remember</i>

1105
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:46,673
<i>if you caused a scene.</i>

1106
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,742
I'm so sorry.

1107
01:20:50,778 --> 01:20:51,912
Get up.

1108
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:57,384
And then tom took you home.

1109
01:20:57,386 --> 01:20:59,753
- Sorry, tom...
- Stop fucking saying that!

1110
01:20:59,755 --> 01:21:01,788
- I know you're sorry!
- Sorry.

1111
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:03,590
What's your fucking problem?
Can't even focus on me.

1112
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:05,759
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?

1113
01:21:05,761 --> 01:21:06,761
Can you stand?

1114
01:21:08,931 --> 01:21:11,098
Fucking disgusting.

1115
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:13,767
<i>N-no.</i>

1116
01:21:13,769 --> 01:21:15,569
No.

1117
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:17,204
Yeah, tom got fired

1118
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:18,872
'cause he couldn't keep
his dick in his pants.

1119
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,074
You did nothing wrong.

1120
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:22,509
Nothing.

1121
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:32,119
<i>Wake the fuck up, Rachel.</i>

1122
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:33,287
<i>Wake the fuck up!</i>

1123
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:34,855
- Wake up!

1124
01:21:40,928 --> 01:21:43,630
You can sleep out here.

1125
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:45,599
<i>We all felt so bad for you.</i>

1126
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:48,268
He's such a bad guy.

1127
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,270
Oh, god.

1128
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:52,139
Are you okay?

1129
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:21,335
Hmm.

1130
01:22:58,673 --> 01:23:00,540
<i>I need to see you.</i>

1131
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,142
<i>Meet me at 3:00.</i>

1132
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:04,978
<i>I'm here. Where are you?</i>

1133
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,214
<i>I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.</i>

1134
01:23:18,559 --> 01:23:21,528
What are you doing up?

1135
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:24,898
Picking up after Evie.

1136
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:02,135
You whore!

1137
01:24:03,604 --> 01:24:05,439
Leave us alone.

You okay?

1149
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:17,978
I thought I heard something.

1150
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,013
You should wake me up
if you heard something.

1151
01:25:20,015 --> 01:25:21,681
I just, I...

1152
01:25:23,951 --> 01:25:26,286
Well, come back to bed.

1153
01:26:14,201 --> 01:26:16,736
Whore!

1154
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:28,415
Rachel's down there.

1155
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:38,592
What the hell are you doing?

1156
01:26:38,594 --> 01:26:39,693
Come here.

1157
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:44,257
Hey, get the fuck
out of here, okay?

1158
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,925
Get the fuck out of here!

1159
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,460
You're okay.
Just need some help.

1160
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:48,662
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

1161
01:27:48,664 --> 01:27:50,163
Just need to get
a little help up.

1162
01:27:50,165 --> 01:27:52,198
- Just fuck off. Fuck off!
- Come on. Come on.

1163
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,468
You're heavy. Aw.

1164
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,343
Come here.

1165
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:38,578
Anna?

1166
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,180
No.

1167
01:28:40,182 --> 01:28:41,981
- Anna, please, please?
- No, go away.

1168
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:43,149
- There's... okay.
- Go!

1169
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:44,918
I'm-I'm gonna stand right here.

1170
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,553
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.

1171
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:48,555
I don't want to hear
anything you have to say.

1172
01:28:48,557 --> 01:28:49,989
Where's tom?

1173
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:00,333
He's lying to you.

1174
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:02,001
He-he always does.

1175
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:03,403
He's-he's a good liar...

1176
01:29:03,405 --> 01:29:05,905
I know he's a good liar.

1177
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:08,341
We went behind your back
for months.

1178
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,243
He's just done it to you.

1179
01:29:10,245 --> 01:29:11,611
I know he's cheating.

1180
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:15,682
I know.

1181
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:18,418
Anna, he-he killed Megan...

1182
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,754
No, we don't,
we don't know that.

1183
01:29:20,756 --> 01:29:22,622
- He's dangerous.
- We don't know anything.

1184
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:24,591
- Anna, you-you need to leave.
- No. No.

1185
01:29:24,593 --> 01:29:26,526
You need to leave.
You need to take Evie

1186
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,094
- and you need to leave, get out of here.
- No.

1187
01:29:28,096 --> 01:29:30,463
- It's not safe...
- I'm not leaving him.

1188
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:33,466
It's hardly the first time
he's had an affair.

1189
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:35,902
It's not about the affair.

1190
01:29:35,904 --> 01:29:37,737
And you... you know that
deep down.

1191
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:39,272
Anna, please,

1192
01:29:39,274 --> 01:29:41,040
- just come with me.
- I'm not leaving him.

1193
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,142
Please come with me.

1194
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:46,713
- Anna, don't, don't...
- Come in the house, honey.

1195
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:48,114
Please.

1196
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:52,886
I saw you, tom.
You motherfucker!

1197
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,554
I saw you, you murderer!

1198
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:56,489
You fucking murderer!

1199
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:58,625
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!

1200
01:29:58,627 --> 01:30:00,393
I know it!

1201
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:02,262
Un-fucking-believable!

1202
01:30:02,264 --> 01:30:03,596
Now, listen. Listen to me.

1203
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:04,764
Megan got into his car
that night.

1204
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:06,232
You think I don't remember.

1205
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,767
You thought I blacked out!
I saw you.

1206
01:30:07,769 --> 01:30:09,269
Why did Megan get in your car?

1207
01:30:09,271 --> 01:30:11,171
- Did Megan get in your car?
- No!

1208
01:30:11,173 --> 01:30:13,239
Yes, she did.

1209
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,308
Tell her the truth.

1210
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:17,110
Just tell her
the truth right now.

1211
01:30:17,112 --> 01:30:19,646
You attacked me in that tunnel
because I saw her with you.

1212
01:30:19,648 --> 01:30:20,680
I found Megan's phone.

1213
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:29,889
I found it.

1214
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:34,561
So, all those phone calls,
they weren't from Rachel.

1215
01:30:37,698 --> 01:30:41,935
So, were you fucking her
while she was here working?

1216
01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:44,437
While she was looking after
our daughter?

1217
01:30:46,173 --> 01:30:49,876
You... you were
so tired all the time.

1218
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:03,022
It's all about Evie.

1219
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:05,124
That's right.

1220
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:08,294
Your daddy loves you.

1221
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:09,495
Tom?

1222
01:31:09,497 --> 01:31:12,465
- Give her to me.
- That's right.

1223
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,133
Your daddy loves you.

1224
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:17,003
Tom, give her to me, please?

1225
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:19,038
- Please give her to me.
- It's fine.

1226
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,039
I think she needs
changing, please.

1227
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:21,641
No, she's gonna be fine.

1228
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:23,710
Please just give her to me.
Oh, okay. Shh, shh.

1229
01:31:23,712 --> 01:31:25,478
- Let her go. You're going to hurt her.
- Change her here.

1230
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,546
- Change her here.
- You're... okay.

1231
01:31:26,548 --> 01:31:27,580
I'll change her. Let her go.

1232
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:28,648
You're gonna hurt her.

1233
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,550
- Shh.

1234
01:31:30,552 --> 01:31:32,652
You're okay, you're okay.

1235
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:34,420
Shh, shh.

1236
01:31:35,522 --> 01:31:37,056
Shh.

1237
01:31:42,429 --> 01:31:44,163
911, what's your...

1238
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:48,234
What's your emergency?

1239
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,381
No, no. Stay.

1240
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:03,316
Stay.

1241
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,557
Do you need a drink?

1242
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:13,526
No.

1243
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:22,268
Yeah, you do.

1244
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:36,416
All those things
that you said I did.

1245
01:32:38,753 --> 01:32:42,021
Those terrible things...
I didn't do any of them.

1246
01:32:44,124 --> 01:32:46,125
You just watched me suffer.

1247
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:48,895
You made me feel so worthless.

1248
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:53,533
You made me think that
everything was my fault.

1249
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:04,911
Drink it.

1250
01:33:12,152 --> 01:33:14,520
You told me I got you fired.

1251
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:18,091
But I didn't.

1252
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:24,697
You know, I saw Martha
on the train...

1253
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:26,299
Drink it!

1254
01:33:33,474 --> 01:33:35,708
I saw Martha on the train.

1255
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:38,378
And she told me
that you were fired

1256
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:41,581
because you were fucking
everyone in the office!

1257
01:34:04,004 --> 01:34:06,172
Rachel's down there.

1258
01:34:06,174 --> 01:34:08,541
Wait here.

1259
01:34:43,343 --> 01:34:46,846
You gonna get in the car?

1260
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:48,381
What's going on?

1261
01:34:48,383 --> 01:34:50,850
Don't worry about it.

1262
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:53,252
Come on.

1263
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:13,806
Okay, I'm here.

1264
01:35:13,808 --> 01:35:16,209
So, what is it?

1265
01:35:18,712 --> 01:35:21,114
I just want to go to the woods.

1266
01:35:40,467 --> 01:35:43,536
What is it with you crazy women?

1267
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:10,963
This what you want?

1268
01:36:11,966 --> 01:36:14,066
No.

1269
01:36:17,704 --> 01:36:19,906
Like this?

1270
01:36:24,444 --> 01:36:26,312
What?

1271
01:36:26,314 --> 01:36:29,048
I'm pregnant.

1272
01:36:32,553 --> 01:36:34,587
Congratulations.

1273
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:39,725
I thought you should know.

1274
01:36:39,727 --> 01:36:41,627
You thought I should know?

1275
01:36:43,463 --> 01:36:45,865
There's a chance
it could be yours.

1276
01:36:45,867 --> 01:36:47,600
Then get an abortion.

1277
01:36:49,369 --> 01:36:51,204
Or if it's Scott's,
do whatever you want.

1278
01:36:51,206 --> 01:36:54,707
But if it's not,
then get rid of it.

1279
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:02,582
You can be as involved
as you want.

1280
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:05,351
You were a shitty nanny.

1281
01:37:05,353 --> 01:37:07,353
What makes you think
you're gonna be a good mother?

1282
01:37:10,657 --> 01:37:12,925
Why did you bring me there
in the first place?

1283
01:37:12,927 --> 01:37:15,895
Because I thought it would be
fun to have you both around.

1284
01:37:19,099 --> 01:37:20,099
Come on.

1285
01:37:23,904 --> 01:37:26,172
I played your game
so you could fuck me

1286
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:27,773
in between Evie's playdates.

1287
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:30,009
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.

1288
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:32,645
I took care of your kid
to be near you!

1289
01:37:34,848 --> 01:37:37,550
You fucked Anna 'cause you
couldn't fuck Rachel anymore,

1290
01:37:37,552 --> 01:37:39,585
and you fucked me 'cause
you couldn't fuck Anna!

1291
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:42,588
Take us all away
and you're just a pathetic,

1292
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:44,023
impotent man!

1293
01:38:00,407 --> 01:38:03,709
You're... you're not
gonna get rid of me.

1294
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:07,880
You're gonna pay for this child
for the rest of your life.

1295
01:38:13,587 --> 01:38:16,455
I can just... yeah.

1296
01:39:11,611 --> 01:39:13,579
You're like a dog.

1297
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:18,351
Like one of those unwanted,

1298
01:39:18,353 --> 01:39:20,586
mistreated dogs.

1299
01:39:22,723 --> 01:39:24,457
And you can kick them.

1300
01:39:26,026 --> 01:39:28,661
They keep coming back to you.

1301
01:39:28,663 --> 01:39:31,063
Thinking that somehow
if they're good...

1302
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:33,499
You're not doing this again.

1303
01:39:33,501 --> 01:39:35,968
You'll love them.

1304
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:37,336
This is what you do.

1305
01:39:37,338 --> 01:39:40,506
You're not doing this to me.

1306
01:39:40,508 --> 01:39:43,542
You brought this
on yourself, Rachel.

1307
01:39:45,178 --> 01:39:48,614
If you had just stayed away
that one night...

1308
01:39:50,817 --> 01:39:54,487
Just left us all alone.

1309
01:39:57,090 --> 01:40:00,259
You brought this on Megan.

1310
01:40:00,261 --> 01:40:02,862
In a way, you killed her.

1311
01:40:02,864 --> 01:40:04,296
Mm-hmm.

1312
01:40:05,665 --> 01:40:07,833
But I didn't.

1313
01:40:09,603 --> 01:40:11,404
You did.

1314
01:40:22,449 --> 01:40:24,083
No!

1315
01:40:24,085 --> 01:40:26,685
No...

1316
01:40:29,557 --> 01:40:32,625
You did this to me
in our marriage.

1317
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:37,129
You made me fucking crazy.

1318
01:40:41,902 --> 01:40:43,969
Do you have any idea

1319
01:40:43,971 --> 01:40:46,238
what it's like to be
married to a fucking blur?

1320
01:43:34,474 --> 01:43:37,910
I had no choice. He was...

1321
01:43:37,912 --> 01:43:41,747
He would've killed me.

1322
01:43:41,749 --> 01:43:44,483
I never wanted to hurt him.

1323
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:50,723
It was self-defense.

1324
01:43:55,261 --> 01:43:57,930
She had no choice.

1325
01:43:57,932 --> 01:43:59,898
Tom would've killed her.

1326
01:44:02,302 --> 01:44:04,303
I saw the whole thing.

1327
01:44:08,575 --> 01:44:10,542
Rachel was right about Megan.

1328
01:44:12,646 --> 01:44:14,680
She was right about everything.

1329
01:44:59,793 --> 01:45:01,527
<i>We are tied forever now,</i>

1330
01:45:01,529 --> 01:45:02,928
<i>the three of us.</i>

1331
01:45:06,966 --> 01:45:10,402
<i>Bound forever
by the story we share.</i>

1332
01:45:43,737 --> 01:45:46,872
<i>Today I sit in a different car.</i>

1333
01:45:46,874 --> 01:45:49,408
<i>And I look ahead.</i>

1334
01:45:49,410 --> 01:45:51,543
<i>Anything is possible,</i>

1335
01:45:51,545 --> 01:45:54,813
<i>because I am not the girl
I used to be.</i>
