The Girl on the Train

2
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:03,939
Subtitle by Bambula

3
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:07,956
My husband used to tell me I
have an overactive imagination.

4
00:01:09,352 --> 00:01:11,055
I cant help it.

5
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:13,394
I mean, havent you
ever been on a train

6
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,682
and wondered about the lives of
the people who live near the tracks?

7
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:19,138
The lives youve never lived.

8
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:22,936
These are things I want to know.

9
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,070
Twice a day I sit in the third
car from the front

10
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:31,638
where I have the perfect
view into my favorite house:

11
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:34,009
Number 15 Beckett Road...

12
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:44,317
I dont know when exactly.

13
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:47,900
I suppose I started
noticing her about a year ago

14
00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:50,911
and, gradually, as
the months went past,

15
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:53,555
she became important to me...

16
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,918
Im not the girl I used to be.

17
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,311
I think people can see it on my face.

18
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:37,534
Shes what I lost.

19
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:40,925
Shes everything I want to be...

20
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,051
I imagine shes a painter...

21
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,268
Shes creative.
Hes a doctor or an architect.

22
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:33,867
He has a good laugh.

23
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:36,045
She cant cook.

24
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,625
I wonder what they say to each
other before they go to sleep.

25
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:56,953
Today her name is Jess,  tomorrow
it could be Lisa or Amber.

26
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,330
It all depends on the
day, it depends on my mood.

27
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:05,899
The truth is, I dont know her name.

28
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:11,027
I dont know if she paints or
whether he has a good laugh.

29
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,106
I just know they know love...

30
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:20,178
Sometimes I catch
myself trying to remember

31
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:23,367
the last time I had meaningful
contact with another person...

32
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:35,629
I used to live two doors
down... number 13 Beckett Road.

33
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:40,040
It was my first home.

34
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:43,730
We bought it together. It was ours.

35
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:51,024
Every day, I tell myself not to
look.

36
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:56,278
But then I look...

37
00:05:05,036 --> 00:05:07,194
Are you alone?
-Yeah.

38
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,622
No, come. Its all yours.

39
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:15,793
Your babys so cute.
-Thank you. -Hi, baby.

40
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:18,485
Is it... Is it a boy?
-Yeah.

41
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:23,819
So sweet. How... how old is he?
-Six months. -Six months.

42
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,612
So sweet.

43
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,850
A teacher once told me I was a
mistress of self-reinvention...

44
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:19,827
I wasnt really sure
what it meant at the time.

45
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:25,024
But since moving here Ive
come to understand it...

46
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,481
6 MONTHS AGO

47
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:32,547
Ardsley-on-Hudson is
boring and routine.

48
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,139
Its a fucking baby factory.

49
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:41,353
I want to start my life over again.

50
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,079
So far, Ive been:
rebellious teenager,

51
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:50,480
lover,

52
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:52,747
waitress...

53
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,569
gallery director,

54
00:06:56,468 --> 00:06:58,168
nanny,

55
00:06:59,997 --> 00:07:02,408
and a whore.

56
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:07,353
And not necessarily in that order.

57
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,201
I cant just be a wife anymore.

58
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,560
Thats why I stay awake at night,
staring at the ceiling.

59
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,011
In fact, the only time I feel
like myself is when Im running.

60
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:31,422
You always felt that way?

61
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,505
Maybe since I was about seventeen.

62
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:41,066
With Mac.

63
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:43,468
Mac? Whos Mac?

64
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:46,771
My brothers best friend.

65
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,127
My brother who died...

66
00:07:57,516 --> 00:07:59,810
I tend to smile when Im nervous.

67
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:02,778
Sometimes, I laugh.

68
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:16,091
For a year, Mac and I
lived in this hunting cabin.

69
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,180
We started fucking.

70
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:29,106
We were the saddest people we knew.

71
00:08:31,904 --> 00:08:34,673
But in a way, that
cabin made us happy.

72
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:38,323
No one could find us.

73
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:41,463
Everyone thought we were dead.

74
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:45,240
And if you were to run away today,
right now, where would you go?

75
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,581
I read once that when a train hits, it
can rip the clothes right off of you.

76
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:14,929
Im pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny
job is gonna make me less restless,

77
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:19,080
make me wanna get pregnant...

78
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,061
And thats not the case?

79
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:25,336
When I finish work,
every night I run home,

80
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:28,876
and I get in the shower and wash the
smell of that baby off me as fast as I can.

81
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,315
ANNA

82
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:38,897
TODAY

83
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:47,437
When you woke up this morning I went
and I brought you back to bed with me.

84
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,082
And when I was feeding you, we heard
daddy singing from the kitchen, didnt we?

85
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:58,807
Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday to you,

86
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,322
Happy Birthday dear Anna,
Happy Birthday to you!

87
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:10,261
Daddy came upstairs with
a beautiful breakfast

88
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:12,071
that he made for Mommy,
didnt he?

89
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,182
Yes he did.

90
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:16,599
Thank you, Megan.

91
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:22,313
There you go.

92
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:32,453
Oh, hello.

93
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:39,364
I swear I sometimes feel like
my heart is gonna explode.

94
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,099
I mean, look at her.

95
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:43,347
Look at her!

96
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:46,905
Youre not sleeping!

97
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:49,086
Hello? -Youre not sleeping...

98
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:52,594
Hello?

99
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:54,903
Hello?

100
00:10:57,085 --> 00:10:58,786
Is that another hang-up?

101
00:11:00,655 --> 00:11:02,356
And grab the corners.

102
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:11,437
And straighten.
-I got another job.

103
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:13,490
You what?

104
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:15,802
Im really sorry, Anna.

105
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:20,336
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here...

106
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:22,395
I am.

107
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:25,155
Its just this isnt what I do.

108
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:27,884
Take care of children?

109
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,772
Or laundry.

110
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,581
Another gallery head-hunted me.

111
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:39,245
That's great.
-The thing is, it starts tomorrow.

112
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,576
Im out all day tomorrow.
That is so uncool.

113
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:48,658
I hate to leave you like this, without
childcare, but, you dont have a job.

114
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,871
Ok, that sounded wrong.

115
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:58,573
I know that youre busy volunteering.
-Its not the volunteering.

116
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,677
Its all the shopping, its spending
hours in the farmers market,

117
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:06,240
its finding the right foods for
her, its pureeing sweet potatoes.

118
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:10,535
And I do all of this at the
same time as Im nursing.

119
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:13,587
Maybe you should go back to work, too.

120
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,956
Mothers need to work, its actually
better for the kid. -How would you know?

121
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:28,570
Your key.

122
00:12:29,352 --> 00:12:31,807
There is no job more important
than raising a child...

123
00:12:34,998 --> 00:12:36,698
Megan, please...

124
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:02,730
Rachel? What are you doing?

125
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:04,433
Give me my baby.

126
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:06,229
Rachel, what are you doing?!

127
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:13,067
Hello?

128
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:23,384
Thank you.

129
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,230
Beautiful.

130
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:31,258
How many times has
she texted you today?

131
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:35,445
I dont know. -She called
the landline three times.

132
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,822
You have to talk to her.
-I know.

133
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,231
Its getting crazy.
-I will. I know I know I know. -Okay.

134
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:46,966
Its going to be fine.

135
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,123
Isnt it always fine? Dont
I always make everything fine?

136
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:57,625
Who gives a shit? Its your birthday. You sure
you dont want me to take you out tonight?

137
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:00,732
No, I like it at home.
-Call Megan. Ask her to come back.

138
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,577
She just quit.

139
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:09,359
She what?
-She just told me she got another job.

140
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,524
Shame. I thought you guys were
kind of a good team together.

141
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:18,879
So did I.

142
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:40,009
RACHEL

143
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:52,619
Hey, its Tom. Sorry I missed you.

144
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:59,338
Hey, Tom, it's me. I just wanted
to wish Momma happy birthday.

145
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,578
Happy birthday, Momma.
-Rachel!

146
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:04,683
Jesus...

147
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,591
No no no. No, dont, Cathy. Please
stop it! -Relax. -Cathy, come on! -Relax.

148
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:15,013
I just need something to go to
sleep. I just need a little bit to go to sleep.

149
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:18,972
What brought this on?

150
00:16:20,802 --> 00:16:23,245
He posted another picture of the baby.

151
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,311
It was a cute picture.
-Yeah?

152
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:30,537
Facebook and drunk ex-wives
do not make good friends.

153
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:35,397
I got it. I got it.
-Alright. Ill just get you to your room.

154
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,938
Rachel, you have to stop calling
them. Okay?

155
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:52,539
I really appreciate this room. I do.

156
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:59,286
I thought that I would just be
here for a couple of weeks or a month.

157
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:01,480
Yeah. That was two years ago.

158
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:06,346
Get some sleep.

159
00:17:37,134 --> 00:17:39,684
IVF rarely works the first time.

160
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:42,733
Would you like a moment?

161
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,320
Its okay, sweetie.
Were gonna try again.

162
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:49,427
We cant afford to do it again.

163
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:54,211
When we can, we will.

164
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:02,146
I wonder what shes looking at...

165
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,769
Or if she even sees this train at all.

166
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,358
Who is that man?

167
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:50,737
What is she doing?

168
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:01,884
Shes throwing it all away.

169
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:36,413
Anna, I fell asleep last night
thinking of you.

170
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:41,144
I dreamed about kissing the inside
of your thighs. Holding your breasts.

171
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,858
God, I wish I was
fucking you right now.

172
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,926
Anna, I love you. I love you so much.

173
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:53,137
When it happened to me, I found
dozens of emails.

174
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:57,588
Tom told her that
hed never felt like this before.

175
00:20:58,515 --> 00:21:02,261
He said it wouldnt be that much
longer until they were together.

176
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:07,344
I know what they say: You
shouldnt check his email.

177
00:21:09,094 --> 00:21:11,019
I was stupid.

178
00:21:11,491 --> 00:21:15,444
But when I saw it was from the realtor

179
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,994
I thought that it was
just spam.

180
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:21,574
And then I realized that
they were kisses not Xs

181
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:25,114
and my husband was
fucking a Century 21 Agent.

182
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:29,390
That sucks. -It does. Her name was Anna Boyd
and he was in love with her.

183
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:34,556
Come here for one second.

184
00:21:35,455 --> 00:21:38,635
Say "fuck you, Anna Boyd",
but just yell it. -Right.

185
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:41,380
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

186
00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:45,570
That bitch is living in my house.

187
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:49,282
I picked everything in that
house. I picked everything.

188
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:53,035
I picked the
dining table, the kitchen table.

189
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:55,430
I wonder if she knows that
I fucked Tom

190
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:57,916
on the same table
that her baby eats at.

191
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,201
I just want to tell her.

192
00:22:01,894 --> 00:22:05,159
I wish I could tell her.
I picked everything in that house.

193
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,313
I fucking
picked everything in that house!

194
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:18,315
I could never find the words to
describe how I felt

195
00:22:18,316 --> 00:22:20,885
when I read that e-mail,

196
00:22:21,597 --> 00:22:24,060
but this morning, I did.

197
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,545
I did.

198
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:31,299
When I saw that woman
kissing someone else...

199
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:35,932
I... Betraying her
husband, I felt...

200
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:41,482
I felt it.
I felt pure rage.

201
00:22:43,855 --> 00:22:47,335
Like something has been
taken from me again.

202
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:53,481
If I could... If I
could, Id just go to her house.

203
00:22:54,301 --> 00:22:58,573
And Id go in and find her sitting
at the kitchen table.

204
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:03,480
Id wrap my hand in her long
blonde hair and jerk her head back.

205
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,218
Just jerk it back!

206
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,229
And then Id pull
her down to the ground

207
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:14,683
and I would just smash her
head all over the floor!

208
00:24:10,236 --> 00:24:12,638
Move! Get out of my way! Move!

209
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:25,262
You whore!

210
00:25:58,444 --> 00:26:01,663
Jesus Christ, Rachel! What
the hell is wrong with you?

211
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:06,287
Ive spent the past hour
driving around looking for you!

212
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:10,748
You scared the shit out of
Anna, do you know that?

213
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:16,558
She thought you were going to...
She wanted to call the police.

214
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:18,314
So just...

215
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:22,693
Leave us alone!

216
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:26,992
You can ruin your own life if you want
to, but youre not gonna destroy ours.

217
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:29,994
Im not gonna protect you any more.

218
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,835
Oh my god...

219
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,572
Rachel, open the door.

220
00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:03,797
Cathy, I just need a sec.
-Are you ok? Rachel, open the door.

221
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,367
I have a stomach flu, okay? -You dont
have a flu. What the fuck, Rachel?

222
00:27:10,826 --> 00:27:12,527
Im not stupid...

223
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,332
Rachel!
-Cathy, just go away!

224
00:27:26,496 --> 00:27:28,196
Come here for one second.

225
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:33,086
Say "fuck you, Anna Boyd."
-Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

226
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:42,299
You whore!

227
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:48,440
Anyone counting days one to ninety
who would like to share a day count?

228
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:50,846
Hey, Im Jason, Im an alcoholic.

229
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:52,884
Welcome, Jason.
-Ive got twenty-two days back.

230
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,938
Anyone else?

231
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:09,201
Hi, Im Rachel, and...
-Welcome, Rachel.

232
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,109
This is day one, I suppose.

233
00:29:29,694 --> 00:29:32,328
Im here because I...

234
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,981
Because I...

235
00:29:36,377 --> 00:29:38,941
Because I woke up
covered in blood.

236
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:44,614
And I had bruises
all over my arm and...

237
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:50,392
Its usually from when Ive fallen
and someone has helped me up.

238
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,619
My husband...

239
00:29:56,392 --> 00:29:59,029
He used to tell me what
Id done the night before.

240
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:06,948
And I learned that when you wake up
like that, you just say you're sorry.

241
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:13,083
You just say youre
sorry for what you did

242
00:30:13,117 --> 00:30:16,852
and you're sorry for who you are
and you're never gonna do it again.

243
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,602
But you do. You do it again.

244
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:23,708
And there's... time missing.

245
00:30:25,837 --> 00:30:27,538
I need to remember.

246
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:31,752
I need to remember.

247
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:35,554
Okay. Thank you, Rachel.

248
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:56,542
It was that homeless thing. I
dont remember what it was called.

249
00:30:56,577 --> 00:31:01,080
Oh, Safe Shelter... -Yeah. -That was
a tube top, right? -Yeah, it was.

250
00:31:08,438 --> 00:31:11,669
Do you like Devils Eggs, Martha?
-Deviled Eggs? Yeah, I do.

251
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,371
Deviled Eggs.

252
00:31:15,422 --> 00:31:17,188
The classics.

253
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:20,221
Do you want to try one, anybody? -Those go
outside. I dont want the eggs with the dessert.

254
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:22,954
It doesnt fucking matter where they go,
okay? So do you want to put them here?

255
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,795
Do you want them with your hot dogs? Or you
can put a couple with your quinoa if you want.

256
00:31:26,894 --> 00:31:30,183
Or do you want to put them with your other
salad and your corn, and a couple on the wall!

257
00:31:31,194 --> 00:31:33,999
Rachel!
-Im fine, Tom. Stop it!

258
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:36,965
You didnt back me up.
You never have my back.

259
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:39,695
You never have my back.
-Thats my bosss wife.

260
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:44,096
You probably got me fired back there.
-I dont give a fuck. Im your wife.

261
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:47,241
Im your wife and you never...
-Rachel! -You never fucking support me!

262
00:31:47,277 --> 00:31:50,592
Please stop. Hey, come on.
I need you to focus here.

263
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,952
Dont fucking talk to me like that!
-Relax!

264
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:12,082
Rachel, there you are. -Cathy, Im sorry.
I need to get my shit together. Im...

265
00:32:14,218 --> 00:32:17,169
You must be Miss Watson.
Im Detective Riley.

266
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:21,147
This is Detective Gaskill. We
need to ask you a few questions.

267
00:32:21,182 --> 00:32:23,732
Whats this about?
-Want to sit down?

268
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:32,140
Can you tell me where you were
Friday night?

269
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:39,830
I was at work in the city. And then...

270
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:46,203
And then I went to visit my husband.
-You mean your EX-husband?

271
00:32:48,337 --> 00:32:52,613
Yes. So I got off the train at
Ardsley-on-Hudson. And then...

272
00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:56,393
And then I decided
that it was a bad idea.

273
00:32:56,429 --> 00:32:59,077
Around what time did you
reach that conclusion?

274
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:01,421
I was back here by 11:00.

275
00:33:02,728 --> 00:33:04,430
Yeah. Yeah.

276
00:33:05,422 --> 00:33:07,887
On your way back here,
did you stop anywhere?

277
00:33:09,815 --> 00:33:11,730
No. -And what time did
you take the train there?

278
00:33:13,255 --> 00:33:15,526
Um, 6:00.
-So...

279
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:20,058
What did you do during those hours in
Ardsley if you werent seeing your ex-husband?

280
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:31,074
Do you remember seeing this woman?

281
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,878
She worked for your ex-husband.

282
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:37,781
Shes gone missing.
-What do you mean shes missing?

283
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:40,653
Her husband said she never
came back home the same night

284
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:42,880
you got off the train
in Ardsley-on-Hudson.

285
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:49,095
I was just...I was... -Do you know
Megan Hipwell? -No. -Did you see her?

286
00:33:49,172 --> 00:33:52,951
No. I dont think so. -Is that
because you were inebriated?

287
00:33:54,226 --> 00:33:57,080
Just to clarify, you said
you were at work Friday?

288
00:33:57,115 --> 00:34:00,411
Are you referring to your job
in Public Relations?

289
00:34:00,654 --> 00:34:03,781
Right. -Its my understanding you were
fired from that job over a year ago

290
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:05,871
because of your drinking problem?

291
00:34:20,253 --> 00:34:21,954
Ok. Thats enough for now.

292
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:28,679
If youre able to remember
anything else, give us a call.

293
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:33,547
Did you really get fired?

294
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:36,445
Look, I didnt want you to worry
that I couldnt pay the rent...

295
00:34:36,628 --> 00:34:40,983
If you dont have a job, then
what do you do everyday? -I...

296
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:44,521
I ride the train.
-You what?

297
00:34:44,556 --> 00:34:47,563
I ride the train to New York and back.

298
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,192
Thats what your alimonys
paying for? Tickets to nowhere?

299
00:34:53,704 --> 00:34:57,289
That's really fucking
weird, Rachel! -Okay. Okay.

300
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:03,233
I got on the train.

301
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:08,695
And then, I got off the train.
I dont know! Its very unclear...

302
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,827
You dont remember anything, do you?

303
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:16,465
You know, I read about this man
in Long Island who blacked out.

304
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,123
He left a bar and drove to the house

305
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,244
that hed grown up in,
stabbed its occupants to death.

306
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,784
He woke up the next morning
oblivious to what he did

307
00:35:26,786 --> 00:35:30,465
until the police came to get him.
Rachel! -What? What?

308
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:35,443
You have to leave. I cant do this anymore.
Ill give you a few weeks. -Hold on.

309
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,574
Hold on.

310
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:41,818
Detective Riley! -Yeah, I agree
with you, but... -Detective Riley!

311
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:46,670
I saw someone with Megan Hipwell,
but not on Friday night.

312
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:52,052
She was having an affair. She had a
lover. Thats what Im trying to tell you.

313
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:54,032
I thought you didnt know her.

314
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,583
No. But I saw her.
-You saw her where?

315
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:59,666
I saw her from the train. She was
standing on the deck with this man.

316
00:35:59,702 --> 00:36:02,963
With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
-No. It wasnt him.

317
00:36:03,153 --> 00:36:05,695
This man was different.
And they were kissing.

318
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:09,280
Wow. Thats pretty
coincidental, isnt it?

319
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:14,476
You just happen to be on a train at the same
exact moment that a woman you dont know,

320
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,449
but somehow recognize, is
cheating on her husband?

321
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,668
I know it sounds crazy, but...
-Neighbors saw a drunk woman

322
00:36:19,702 --> 00:36:22,121
in the vicinity of
her house Friday night.

323
00:36:23,038 --> 00:36:26,376
Megan Hipwell does bear a
resemblance to Anna Watson.

324
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:31,195
Mrs. Watson reported that you go
to their house sometimes uninvited.

325
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,505
And that on one occasion, you
actually broke in and took their child.

326
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:38,106
Let me give you some advice.

327
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:43,400
Dont go back to Beckett Road.
Dont contact your ex-husband.

328
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:48,449
Dont go anywhere near Anna Watson or
her baby. Are you listening to me? -Yes.

329
00:36:49,766 --> 00:36:51,467
You dont live there anymore.

330
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,521
Stay away.

331
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,422
You know, I lie all the time.

332
00:37:07,043 --> 00:37:08,744
4 MONTHS AGO

333
00:37:09,217 --> 00:37:12,005
I lie to Scott. I lie to you.

334
00:37:14,302 --> 00:37:17,902
I mean I know thats not
the point of therapy, but...

335
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:20,626
I have to keep things vague.

336
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:25,568
Jumble up all the men,
the Exes, the lovers.

337
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:32,277
It doesn't matter who they are.
It matters how they make me feel.

338
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:43,119
Lying is like taking a trip.

339
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:52,032
Its like having a secret.

340
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:56,273
Its like touching yourself
and no one else knows...

341
00:38:05,688 --> 00:38:07,389
Except you.

342
00:38:07,943 --> 00:38:10,378
But youre just pretending.

343
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:15,719
Youre just pretending
to touch yourself.

344
00:38:26,393 --> 00:38:29,262
Scotts possessive. Jealous.

345
00:38:32,204 --> 00:38:33,905
He likes to own me.

346
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:38,856
He figures out all my passwords.

347
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:44,246
Which is kinda sexy.

348
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:57,324
So, when I came home last night,
Scott was on my laptop wondering why...

349
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,972
Scotts behavior is not normal.

350
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:03,806
Its a form of emotional abuse.

351
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:07,858
Are you ever afraid of Scott?

352
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:11,969
Its not abuse.

353
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,896
Not if you dont care. And I dont.

354
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:18,882
Maybe its become a
normal state for you.

355
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:24,097
Is it normal I think
about you all the time?

356
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:37,771
Almost exactly a week ago, Megan Hipwell
walked out of Number 15 Beckett Road

357
00:39:37,806 --> 00:39:43,150
and disappeared. No one has seen her
since. Neither her phone nor her bank cards

358
00:39:43,186 --> 00:39:44,976
have been used since Friday.

359
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:53,510
Ardsley Woman Still Missing

360
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:59,213
A wonderful woman. An intensely
private person with a warm heart.

361
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:02,923
She lost a brother
when she was sixteen,

362
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:05,422
and both her parents
died a few years ago.

363
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:13,186
Scott Hipwell urges anyone with
information to please come forward.

364
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:31,427
Youre Megans friend?
-Yes. Rachel.

365
00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:33,626
Come in.

366
00:40:37,338 --> 00:40:39,239
Do you want a coffee?
-Sure. Thank you.

367
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,230
Sorry its a mess.

368
00:40:47,757 --> 00:40:50,438
Ive been hunting for her
social, birth certificate.

369
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:52,563
The cops need a lot.

370
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:58,989
Have we met somewhere before?
-I dont think so.

371
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:02,353
And you know Megan from?
-From the gallery.

372
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:06,193
Are you an artist?
-Well, I like to think so.

373
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,233
So you said on the phone, you wanted
to tell me something about Megan.

374
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,677
What did you want to tell me?

375
00:41:21,753 --> 00:41:28,663
I saw your wife with someone,
on Friday morning. -With who?

376
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:32,250
She was up there on your porch.

377
00:41:33,463 --> 00:41:37,865
I saw her from the train because
I commute to Manhattan everyday

378
00:41:38,436 --> 00:41:40,295
and I go straight past here.

379
00:41:46,697 --> 00:41:48,398
She kissed him.

380
00:41:50,498 --> 00:41:52,197
They were kissing.

381
00:41:56,898 --> 00:41:59,364
Im sorry. I know this is
a terrible thing to hear.

382
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,192
I know how it feels.

383
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,351
What did he look like?

384
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:18,985
He was average height.

385
00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:20,721
He had dark hair.

386
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:23,556
And they were out there on the porch?

387
00:42:24,003 --> 00:42:25,706
Yes.

388
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:34,380
Fuck.

389
00:42:41,032 --> 00:42:42,733
Fuck.

390
00:42:47,594 --> 00:42:49,295
No, no, no. Thank you.

391
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:54,800
OK. Sure.

392
00:43:00,284 --> 00:43:03,414
It could, I dont know.
Maybe its a good thing?

393
00:43:04,856 --> 00:43:07,039
It could mean shes all right.

394
00:43:08,597 --> 00:43:11,030
She just ran off with someone.
-Right.

395
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:23,001
She talked to you?
-Oh no. I havent heard anything.

396
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,646
You know her well enough
to know where we live.

397
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:27,842
Megan doesnt have many friends.

398
00:43:29,731 --> 00:43:34,717
Well, I used to live nearby...
She and I, we took yoga...

399
00:43:34,753 --> 00:43:36,829
We took pilates together.

400
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,905
I think I should go, I feel like
Ive taken up too much of your time.

401
00:43:41,262 --> 00:43:47,230
So sorry to have
had to tell you that in that way.

402
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,809
Do you think youd recognize him
again? If you saw him?

403
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,831
I dont know.

404
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,838
There was a guy, a therapist.

405
00:43:58,153 --> 00:44:01,550
His names Abdic. Abdic.

406
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:06,873
Kamal Abdic.

407
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:13,463
Is that who you saw?

408
00:44:14,971 --> 00:44:16,918
I dont know. I really cant tell.

409
00:44:18,077 --> 00:44:20,539
She spends a lot of
fucking time with her shrink.

410
00:44:35,795 --> 00:44:37,876
I remember...
Thats him.

411
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:40,336
I remember.
Thats him.

412
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,742
Im sorry.

413
00:44:52,744 --> 00:44:55,856
Where are you? Where are you?

414
00:44:56,672 --> 00:44:58,373
Where are you?

415
00:45:00,835 --> 00:45:02,538
Where are you?

416
00:45:35,664 --> 00:45:37,365
Stay away from me.

417
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:42,469
This is so stupid. He makes every
conversation about getting pregnant.

418
00:45:43,813 --> 00:45:46,322
And every time we go there...
-Where?

419
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:49,452
To that subject.

420
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:52,496
What subject?

421
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,719
Megan.

422
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:59,003
What subject?

423
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,271
It's okay.

424
00:46:20,918 --> 00:46:23,045
Megan.

425
00:46:28,425 --> 00:46:30,126
Megan.

426
00:46:32,724 --> 00:46:34,425
All right, Megan.

427
00:46:38,501 --> 00:46:40,202
We shouldnt...

428
00:46:40,373 --> 00:46:42,074
No.

429
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,204
Megan.

430
00:46:45,615 --> 00:46:49,440
Dont make it impossible
for us to work together.

431
00:46:56,282 --> 00:46:58,184
Megan, I could lose my practice.

432
00:47:00,797 --> 00:47:04,525
I dont give a fuck. I dont give a
fuck about your fucking practice!

433
00:47:06,735 --> 00:47:08,438
I dont give a fuck...

434
00:47:21,903 --> 00:47:25,590
Dr. Kamal Abdic has been brought in
for questioning on the disappearance

435
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:28,137
of Ardsley-on-Hudson
resident, Megan Hipwell.

436
00:47:29,032 --> 00:47:32,847
He was, according to sources,
Mrs. Hipwells psychiatrist...

437
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:38,360
For the first time in ages I have
purpose.

438
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,800
Or at least, I have a distraction...

439
00:47:47,253 --> 00:47:50,275
I want Megan to show
up safe and sound. I do.

440
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,432
SCOTT: We need to meet ASAP

441
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:57,724
Just not quite yet.

442
00:48:05,472 --> 00:48:07,175
Hi.

443
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:10,141
Whats wrong?
-Abdics been released.

444
00:48:10,769 --> 00:48:12,469
What?!

445
00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:14,280
There wasnt enough evidence.

446
00:48:14,315 --> 00:48:17,643
And because Im the one that got
him arrested, he talked. A lot.

447
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,804
Theyll build a case against him,
itll just take some time.

448
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:25,429
Are you totally sure hes the guy
you saw Megan with? -Yes.

449
00:48:27,623 --> 00:48:29,356
You sure as fuck better be.

450
00:48:29,356 --> 00:48:32,652
I dont understand. -The police
think I did it. -Yeah, but hes the one...

451
00:48:32,686 --> 00:48:37,201
He told them Megans miserable, that
Im a jealous, controlling husband.

452
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:41,983
Im sure that theyre just
trying to rule you out...

453
00:48:42,018 --> 00:48:43,719
Abdic told them Im abusive.

454
00:48:45,307 --> 00:48:48,298
When she walked out,
I didn't go after her.

455
00:48:49,867 --> 00:48:51,742
I never called to check on her.

456
00:48:54,043 --> 00:48:57,423
I went to a sports bar, for
fucks sake, and got drunk. -No.

457
00:48:57,458 --> 00:49:00,485
We just need to find more
evidence on Abdic.

458
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,800
Ive spent the whole day
going through her stuff.

459
00:49:02,835 --> 00:49:06,981
Theres no emails, theres nothing,
no letters, no emails. Nothing.

460
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:11,802
For a second, I thought about
contacting Abdic myself...

461
00:49:15,081 --> 00:49:17,472
Fucking phone wont stop!

462
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,434
This is Scott. Yeah. Hold on. Hold on.

463
00:49:22,112 --> 00:49:23,813
Do you mind?

464
00:49:48,965 --> 00:49:52,166
Youre heavy. Youre a fatty.
Youre a little fatty.

465
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:55,175
Rachel? No.
Anna, get in the house.

466
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:06,353
Your wife hit me on Friday night!

467
00:50:07,021 --> 00:50:10,202
What are you talking about?
-Yes. Yes, she did. Yes, you did.

468
00:50:10,237 --> 00:50:12,655
And then she got in your car.

469
00:50:13,813 --> 00:50:17,530
No. She said you yelled at her that
night. -No. That is not what happened!

470
00:50:17,565 --> 00:50:19,918
She was in the tunnel. And she hit me.

471
00:50:20,697 --> 00:50:23,713
I wont argue in the street. The
middle of the day and youre drunk.

472
00:50:23,748 --> 00:50:25,494
Im not drunk, Tom!

473
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:30,588
My wife is scared of you.

474
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,619
Of what?

475
00:50:33,474 --> 00:50:37,125
I dont even know if thats a joke or
not. Lets start with child abduction.

476
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,893
Thats bullshit. You know
thats not... how it happened.

477
00:50:39,927 --> 00:50:41,905
You and I both know what youre
capable of.

478
00:50:48,342 --> 00:50:50,045
You were just at Scott Hipwells
house?

479
00:50:53,786 --> 00:50:57,764
Why are you at Scott Hipwells
house?! -Because Im helping him. -How?

480
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,550
To try and find Megan.
-You don't even know Megan!

481
00:51:03,463 --> 00:51:07,364
Rach. I dont think
youre helping anybody.

482
00:51:11,047 --> 00:51:14,677
So youre here because you
want to uncover lost memories.

483
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:16,565
Is that correct?
-You have an accent.

484
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:21,976
Pardon? -Sorry. I wasnt
expecting you to have an accent.

485
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:25,532
Well, you have an accent.

486
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:30,110
Where are you from?
-Im an American citizen.

487
00:51:31,516 --> 00:51:34,277
But I guess youre not here to
talk about me.

488
00:51:34,277 --> 00:51:37,177
Unless, you are...
-No. Im sorry.

489
00:51:37,213 --> 00:51:39,188
I was just trying
to make conversation.

490
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:42,603
The blackouts. Youre
experiencing blackouts.

491
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:46,594
Do you want to tell me about them?

492
00:51:52,327 --> 00:51:57,947
Well, when I wake up, and when
someone tells me what Ive done,

493
00:52:01,753 --> 00:52:05,891
it just doesnt feel like me or like
something that I would do.

494
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:08,342
I feel bad about it.

495
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:13,989
But its like its so far
removed that I have a...

496
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,021
I just dont feel bad enough.

497
00:52:17,456 --> 00:52:20,277
You want to take personal
responsibility for what youve done,

498
00:52:20,313 --> 00:52:24,416
but you find it difficult to feel accountable
because you cant even remember it.

499
00:52:27,871 --> 00:52:29,572
Yeah?

500
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:35,398
Yeah.
-So, Rachel, besides drinking...

501
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:38,673
Because you clearly drink.

502
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:41,070
Youve been drinking
today, havent you?

503
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,271
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?

504
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,061
I like to draw. Art, I guess.

505
00:52:56,588 --> 00:52:59,896
Good. We can try to regain some of
your memories by drawing them.

506
00:52:59,896 --> 00:53:01,599
Ive tried it. It doesnt work.

507
00:53:02,521 --> 00:53:05,751
Have you ever tracked all the way back
to when you started drinking heavily?

508
00:53:08,074 --> 00:53:09,777
When was that?

509
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:15,289
It was with Tom. When
I couldnt get pregnant.

510
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,003
Whos Tom?

511
00:53:18,474 --> 00:53:20,177
Hes my ex-husband.

512
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:22,898
Do you want to talk about that?

513
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,094
I really wanted a baby.

514
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:37,699
We tried everything
and nothing worked.

515
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,672
And it just absolutely...

516
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:59,313
It just broke my heart.

517
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:04,588
So I got really sad and then...

518
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:11,123
The booze just broke us.

519
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,911
Okay.

520
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,351
Tell me more.

521
00:54:21,777 --> 00:54:23,693
I used to watch this perfect couple.

522
00:54:27,242 --> 00:54:33,434
And they were just the
embodiment of true love.

523
00:54:34,485 --> 00:54:37,150
Its like the kind of
love you always want.

524
00:54:41,762 --> 00:54:43,465
And then, she betrayed him.

525
00:54:49,262 --> 00:54:52,646
And its sparked something in me...

526
00:54:56,396 --> 00:54:58,115
Why are you really here, Rachel?

527
00:54:59,985 --> 00:55:02,355
Because Im afraid of myself.

528
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:15,329
July 5th: 1:33, 1:34, 1:37...

529
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:21,942
She calls again 1:38 and then she
calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 PM.

530
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,474
And then July 6th...
You get the point.

531
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:28,103
She sometimes texted him
dozens of times a day.

532
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:32,730
But these are all from an unknown
number. -Unknown is Rachel.

533
00:55:32,731 --> 00:55:34,472
You have a log of the calls.

534
00:55:34,474 --> 00:55:37,063
You dont have a log of what
theyre saying to each other.

535
00:55:38,289 --> 00:55:42,860
Look, has she been back to the house
since the incident with your child?

536
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:46,599
Not that I know. -Well, then you might have
a case for harassment in the second degree,

537
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,891
but these are texts,
theyre not threats, so...

538
00:55:50,356 --> 00:55:54,132
Shes been hanging around Scott
Hipwells house. A lot.

539
00:55:55,108 --> 00:55:59,681
Im aware. There are a lot of loose
ends here that suggest something,

540
00:55:59,717 --> 00:56:01,719
but they dont add up to much.

541
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:04,306
If you can bring me
something more solid...

542
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:06,217
What more do you need?

543
00:56:06,351 --> 00:56:08,967
Evidence. Real evidence?

544
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:18,382
You sure your husband doesnt want
to stay in touch with his ex-wife?

545
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:21,068
What? No. Shes harassing us.

546
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:23,144
Is that what he calls it?

547
00:56:31,668 --> 00:56:33,371
The password is incorrect.
Try again.

548
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:40,681
The password is incorrect.
Try again.

549
00:56:53,586 --> 00:56:55,289
The password is incorrect.
Try again.

550
00:57:07,063 --> 00:57:08,945
Hi.

551
00:57:49,157 --> 00:57:55,481
Hi. -Reporters are in my yard.
Everywhere. I didnt know where else to go.

552
00:57:55,862 --> 00:57:57,565
Come in.

553
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:11,364
The detective just...

554
00:58:13,521 --> 00:58:16,961
The detective just told me something
Ive wanted to hear for a long time.

555
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:23,882
Shes pregnant.

556
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:27,489
She told her shrink but not me.

557
00:58:31,251 --> 00:58:33,550
I wanted a family,

558
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,699
but she fought me
every step of the way.

559
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,190
We always fought about it.

560
00:58:43,826 --> 00:58:45,744
Did Megan ever say anything
about me to you?

561
00:58:55,411 --> 00:58:58,036
She loved you.

562
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:04,552
She loved you in ways that
people only dream of being loved.

563
00:59:36,791 --> 00:59:38,577
1 MONTH AGO

564
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:08,771
You shouldnt be here.

565
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:14,867
I just...

566
01:00:15,391 --> 01:00:17,945
I need to tell someone,

567
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,032
just once.

568
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:21,737
Just say it out loud.

569
01:00:24,009 --> 01:00:25,710
I want to tell you.

570
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,610
And then Ill be gone, I swear.

571
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:41,809
I got pregnant.

572
01:00:45,481 --> 01:00:47,184
I was seventeen.

573
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:49,802
I had her by myself.

574
01:00:54,978 --> 01:00:56,916
She had dark eyes and blond hair.

575
01:01:03,635 --> 01:01:06,458
I expected it to be
hard, but it wasnt.

576
01:01:10,063 --> 01:01:11,766
It was easy.

577
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,483
Because I loved her.

578
01:01:17,574 --> 01:01:19,277
I loved her.

579
01:01:21,907 --> 01:01:23,608
I called her Elizabeth.

580
01:01:25,168 --> 01:01:26,871
Libby.

581
01:01:28,746 --> 01:01:30,449
Libby.

582
01:01:37,063 --> 01:01:38,766
It was December.

583
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,295
Wed gotten in a fight, me and Mac.

584
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,516
Hed gone off and left.

585
01:01:49,396 --> 01:01:51,099
The roof was leaking.

586
01:01:52,898 --> 01:01:57,077
I was freezing cold,
so I got in the tub.

587
01:01:59,217 --> 01:02:01,496
I brought Libby in with me,

588
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:03,802
put her on my chest,

589
01:02:05,282 --> 01:02:08,402
her head just under my chin.

590
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:18,771
I fell asleep.

591
01:02:25,434 --> 01:02:27,137
I let her go.

592
01:02:28,601 --> 01:02:30,304
I let her go.

593
01:02:31,309 --> 01:02:33,012
I let her go.

594
01:02:35,661 --> 01:02:37,362
I let her go.

595
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:42,492
I couldnt look.

596
01:02:43,067 --> 01:02:44,996
I didnt want to see it.

597
01:02:45,032 --> 01:02:47,920
I didnt want to see her.

598
01:02:52,032 --> 01:02:54,266
I wrapped her in a blanket.

599
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,702
And I buried her.

600
01:03:12,474 --> 01:03:14,177
Then...

601
01:03:17,715 --> 01:03:19,481
Mac went out that night.

602
01:03:22,704 --> 01:03:24,532
And he never came back.

603
01:03:26,534 --> 01:03:28,521
He never came back.

604
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:50,427
I missed our home.

605
01:03:59,362 --> 01:04:03,858
So one day when I was
drunk, I decided to go there.

606
01:04:09,197 --> 01:04:12,528
The front door was open. Its not
like I broke in.

607
01:04:24,715 --> 01:04:26,847
And then I heard Evie.

608
01:04:29,342 --> 01:04:31,045
Whos Evie?

609
01:04:32,192 --> 01:04:33,894
Toms baby.

610
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:57,481
I know this sounds insane,

611
01:04:59,893 --> 01:05:02,007
but I just wanted to hold her.

612
01:05:06,967 --> 01:05:08,670
Just for a moment.

613
01:05:35,963 --> 01:05:38,244
Rachel? What are you doing?!

614
01:05:38,706 --> 01:05:40,409
What are you doing?

615
01:05:42,097 --> 01:05:43,800
Rachel...

616
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:08,992
I wasnt going to hurt her.

617
01:06:10,677 --> 01:06:12,380
I would never hurt her.

618
01:06:17,467 --> 01:06:19,170
I just wanted to hold her.

619
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:46,648
Partially decomposed body
found... Female body found...

620
01:06:46,684 --> 01:06:50,235
Death a result of blunt force trauma.
Partially decomposed body.

621
01:06:50,271 --> 01:06:54,315
Megan Hipwell. Investigation
now being called a homicide.

622
01:06:56,431 --> 01:06:59,163
Sources say the partially
decomposed body found

623
01:06:59,222 --> 01:07:03,126
is missing Ardsley woman Megan Hipwell.
Death a result of blunt force trauma.

624
01:07:03,983 --> 01:07:06,882
Megan Hipwells investigation
now being called a homicide.

625
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:09,166
Mr. Hipwell?

626
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,463
Whats wrong?

627
01:07:53,887 --> 01:07:55,590
Im sorry.

628
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:18,518
This reminds me of
when I used to watch

629
01:08:18,519 --> 01:08:21,041
you getting dressed
before going back to her.

630
01:08:27,524 --> 01:08:29,226
Back to this house.

631
01:08:30,993 --> 01:08:32,921
I actually miss being the other woman.

632
01:08:35,421 --> 01:08:37,943
Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel?
-Seriously?

633
01:08:40,298 --> 01:08:42,002
Can we not fixate on her?!

634
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:47,574
I saw her again today.
-Where?

635
01:08:47,576 --> 01:08:51,252
This afternoon when the police brought
Scott back home. She was across the street.

636
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,961
And when she saw me
she got aggressive.

637
01:08:58,448 --> 01:09:00,150
Aggressive how?

638
01:09:00,247 --> 01:09:01,948
What if Rachel killed Megan?

639
01:09:02,344 --> 01:09:04,269
Rachel did not kill Megan

640
01:09:04,869 --> 01:09:07,881
Then why is she creeping around Scotts
house? Shes dangerous and you know it.

641
01:09:07,916 --> 01:09:12,514
Anna, sweetheart,
Rachel is a sad person.

642
01:09:13,185 --> 01:09:14,887
Shes completely harmless.

643
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:45,469
What are you doing
here? How did you get in?

644
01:09:50,282 --> 01:09:51,984
Come here.

645
01:09:52,512 --> 01:09:54,216
Have a beer with me.

646
01:09:55,195 --> 01:09:56,898
Im not drinking right now.

647
01:10:02,704 --> 01:10:05,033
Detective Riley came
to see me last night.

648
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:09,582
It turns out Im not the father.

649
01:10:10,909 --> 01:10:12,613
Neither is the shrink.

650
01:10:15,047 --> 01:10:17,533
Did my wife confide in
you about a third man?

651
01:10:21,497 --> 01:10:23,201
Sit down.

652
01:10:26,765 --> 01:10:28,469
Sit down!

653
01:10:32,503 --> 01:10:35,373
Look, I dont know what
this is about... -Come on!

654
01:10:35,725 --> 01:10:37,988
You and Megan were such good friends.

655
01:10:40,006 --> 01:10:41,710
You must have known.

656
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:47,278
Admit it.
-Admit what?

657
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:49,909
Admit that you never
even fucking met my wife!

658
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:56,132
The Detective said you
didnt even know Megan.

659
01:10:58,105 --> 01:10:59,806
She used other words too.

660
01:11:01,042 --> 01:11:04,555
Alcoholic. Maybe even
mentally unstable?

661
01:11:05,289 --> 01:11:07,693
I am sorry. I was honestly
just trying to help.

662
01:11:09,493 --> 01:11:11,197
Youre Toms crazy ex!

663
01:11:11,886 --> 01:11:13,590
When the fuck were you
going to tell me that?

664
01:11:14,498 --> 01:11:17,297
And now the detective is asking if
you and I are in a relationship?!

665
01:11:18,282 --> 01:11:21,868
You?! I would never even
get near someone like you!

666
01:11:23,368 --> 01:11:26,349
My wife is dead, and
youre lying to me!?

667
01:11:28,677 --> 01:11:30,381
Whats wrong with you?

668
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,087
Who does this? -I needed to
tell you about Megans affair,

669
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,800
and you wouldnt have believed
me if I was just Toms ex!

670
01:11:35,835 --> 01:11:39,528
Well, thank you, you know. For
getting Abdic to point the finger at me!

671
01:11:40,256 --> 01:11:43,639
For getting the cops to say
that you and I are fucking!

672
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,002
How are they going, huh?

673
01:11:52,131 --> 01:11:54,323
You know? The sessions?

674
01:11:58,274 --> 01:11:59,976
With the doctor?

675
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:05,921
I wanted to know about Abdic
and I went to him to help you.

676
01:12:07,516 --> 01:12:09,706
Youre just a sad liar with no life.

677
01:12:10,667 --> 01:12:12,394
Youre all liars.
-Please, dont!

678
01:12:32,453 --> 01:12:36,489
I need to file a statement.
-Name? -Rachel Watson. -Pete?

679
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:38,792
I got this.

680
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:54,788
You wanted to file a
statement? Im listening.

681
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,917
Scott Hipwell just assaulted me.

682
01:12:57,952 --> 01:13:00,104
You mean your new
boyfriend Scott Hipwell?

683
01:13:01,516 --> 01:13:03,774
No. We were just friends.

684
01:13:04,257 --> 01:13:07,871
But thats what you wanted, isnt it? I mean, you
got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right?

685
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:11,574
You need the context.
-I know the context.

686
01:13:11,609 --> 01:13:15,051
But what Im trying to determine is when
your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began.

687
01:13:15,086 --> 01:13:18,149
Was it before or after his pregnant
wife was murdered?

688
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:20,354
I mean, you were
neighbors at one point?

689
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:23,996
I met him after...
-After being questioned by me,

690
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:27,240
you befriend another even more
obvious suspect than yourself,

691
01:13:27,275 --> 01:13:31,846
and then you manage to get him to incriminate
himself all the while hoping hell fuck you.

692
01:13:31,881 --> 01:13:34,063
I came here trying to help you.

693
01:13:34,097 --> 01:13:36,591
He just assaulted me in my own house!

694
01:13:39,596 --> 01:13:41,359
You were seen in the area that night.

695
01:13:42,463 --> 01:13:46,448
There are several hours that
you say you cant account for.

696
01:13:46,534 --> 01:13:49,288
It was Scott. Scott
Hipwell killed his wife.

697
01:13:49,795 --> 01:13:52,525
No. He didnt.

698
01:13:54,005 --> 01:13:58,481
Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts
for Mr. Hipwells whereabouts that night.

699
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,872
Youre lying. Youre lying.

700
01:14:09,068 --> 01:14:11,072
Tell me what happened.

701
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,131
Its okay.

702
01:14:18,127 --> 01:14:19,828
Tell me.

703
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,462
I dont know...

704
01:14:24,975 --> 01:14:26,844
Did you murder Megan Hipwell?

705
01:14:37,314 --> 01:14:39,104
LAST FRIDAY

706
01:14:44,073 --> 01:14:45,775
Hi.

707
01:14:47,559 --> 01:14:49,261
I need to see you.

708
01:14:49,793 --> 01:14:51,496
Can you
please come over?

709
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:06,792
I can still see her dark eyes.

710
01:15:07,564 --> 01:15:09,268
I can smell her skin.

711
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:12,523
I can feel how cold she was.

712
01:15:15,069 --> 01:15:16,770
Forgive yourself.

713
01:15:28,735 --> 01:15:30,738
You dont have to be
afraid of being alone.

714
01:15:33,698 --> 01:15:35,402
Youre not alone.

715
01:16:02,511 --> 01:16:04,212
Youll be fine.

716
01:16:04,412 --> 01:16:06,113
You and your baby will be fine.

717
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,195
Why are you following me?

718
01:16:49,692 --> 01:16:51,457
Why are you here?

719
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:55,541
I could ask you the same question.

720
01:16:55,953 --> 01:16:57,655
I saw you.

721
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:01,103
I saw you that night in
the tunnel. I saw you there.

722
01:17:02,055 --> 01:17:05,109
I know I saw you there!
-Lady, I live here.

723
01:17:05,145 --> 01:17:07,092
Im always in that tunnel.

724
01:17:07,585 --> 01:17:09,287
But what did you see?

725
01:17:10,323 --> 01:17:12,527
What happened
that night? What did you see?

726
01:17:14,554 --> 01:17:17,918
You busted your ass. You fell. I
felt sorry for you.

727
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,104
I tried to help you up.
You told me to fuck off.

728
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:25,402
So, I fucked off. -Was I
with anyone? Was I alone?

729
01:17:25,403 --> 01:17:27,525
What happened?!
-I don't know.

730
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:30,820
You were wasted.
Youre always wasted.

731
01:17:32,605 --> 01:17:34,952
Thats all I can tell you.

732
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:40,587
Whoa. Take it easy. -I need you
to tell me the fucking truth.

733
01:17:41,979 --> 01:17:45,833
What did you see that night?
What happened that night?

734
01:17:49,225 --> 01:17:51,231
I don't know.

735
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,662
Im assuming its the worst.

736
01:17:59,126 --> 01:18:00,828
God...

737
01:18:04,404 --> 01:18:06,550
Come here for one
second. Just one second.

738
01:18:07,648 --> 01:18:09,350
Say Fuck you, Anna Boyd.

739
01:18:09,502 --> 01:18:11,203
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

740
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:14,212
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked Tom.

741
01:18:16,456 --> 01:18:20,747
When I saw that woman
kissing someone else,

742
01:18:21,149 --> 01:18:25,960
betraying her husband. I felt it.
Pure rage.

743
01:18:26,725 --> 01:18:28,740
If I could, Id go to her house,

744
01:18:28,775 --> 01:18:30,478
find her sitting...

745
01:18:33,228 --> 01:18:36,823
and Id smash her head
all over the floor!!

746
01:18:48,595 --> 01:18:52,007
Cathy, thank you for
all you have done for me.

747
01:18:52,658 --> 01:18:55,532
Im sorry to leave this way.
Ill send for my things later.

748
01:18:56,235 --> 01:18:57,939
Love, Rachel.

749
01:19:20,237 --> 01:19:23,202
Its so true. Its the
worst restaurant ever.

750
01:19:24,073 --> 01:19:25,775
Why do we keep going back?

751
01:19:26,658 --> 01:19:28,475
Martha?

752
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:30,774
Martha?

753
01:19:31,452 --> 01:19:33,154
Rachel?

754
01:19:34,024 --> 01:19:35,895
I havent seen you
in a million years...

755
01:19:38,064 --> 01:19:42,570
Yeah, I wanted to call you, but Tom
said I should just leave it alone.

756
01:19:45,161 --> 01:19:46,863
I'm so sorry.

757
01:19:47,588 --> 01:19:49,291
For what?

758
01:19:49,923 --> 01:19:51,627
For the barbecue.

759
01:19:52,572 --> 01:19:57,458
I just need you to know that I don't remember
anything and I just completely blacked out...

760
01:19:57,493 --> 01:20:00,881
Everyone had a little too much to
drink, so... Its okay. -I know,

761
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:04,143
but with the eggs... And
then I screamed at you.

762
01:20:04,177 --> 01:20:09,711
That I was that abusive. I just
feel... I just feel so ashamed about it.

763
01:20:12,288 --> 01:20:13,990
I don't...

764
01:20:14,961 --> 01:20:20,060
Tom... Tom said that I
smashed your plate. I dont...

765
01:20:21,371 --> 01:20:24,502
Tom was fired
because of how I behaved.

766
01:20:27,036 --> 01:20:30,056
You felt sick and you took a nap in
our guest bedroom.

767
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:32,251
Do you want to lie down? Come with
me.

768
01:20:35,792 --> 01:20:38,203
Excuse us...
Rachel? Are you feeling better?

769
01:20:39,289 --> 01:20:42,518
You guys can stay the night if you
want. -No, no. Thats fine. Thanks.

770
01:20:42,554 --> 01:20:44,846
I think Id remember
if you caused a scene...

771
01:20:47,047 --> 01:20:48,953
Im so sorry.

772
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:52,091
Get up.

773
01:20:54,055 --> 01:20:55,759
And then Tom took you home.

774
01:20:56,122 --> 01:20:58,694
Im sorry, Tom...
-Stop fucking saying that!

775
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:01,507
I know youre sorry. -Im sorry.
-Whats your fucking problem?

776
01:21:01,542 --> 01:21:04,394
You cant even focus on me.
You cant even fucking stand up.

777
01:21:04,399 --> 01:21:06,301
What is wrong with you? Can you stand?

778
01:21:08,099 --> 01:21:09,801
Fucking disgusting.

779
01:21:12,506 --> 01:21:14,240
No... No...

780
01:21:14,689 --> 01:21:18,426
Yeah. Tom got fired because he
couldnt keep his dick in his pants.

781
01:21:18,462 --> 01:21:20,195
You did nothing wrong.

782
01:21:31,056 --> 01:21:33,198
Fuck up, Rachel!
Wake the fuck up!

783
01:21:33,712 --> 01:21:35,416
Wake up!

784
01:21:41,201 --> 01:21:42,904
You can sleep out here.

785
01:21:44,282 --> 01:21:46,707
We all felt so bad for you.

786
01:21:46,742 --> 01:21:48,444
Such a bad guy.

787
01:21:49,122 --> 01:21:50,826
God.

788
01:21:50,898 --> 01:21:52,600
Are you okay?

789
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:07,670
The password is incorrect.
Try again.

790
01:22:14,692 --> 01:22:16,475
The password is incorrect.
Try again.

791
01:22:59,418 --> 01:23:01,219
I need to see you.

792
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:02,922
Meet me at 3.

793
01:23:03,043 --> 01:23:04,746
Im here, where are you?

794
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,896
I can't.
Stuck watching Evie.

795
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,338
What are you doing up?

796
01:23:21,734 --> 01:23:23,436
Picking up after Evie.

797
01:24:00,685 --> 01:24:02,386
You whore!

798
01:24:03,373 --> 01:24:05,077
Leave us alone.

799
01:24:40,929 --> 01:24:44,488
No new messages. No saved messages.

Hi, its Megan. Leave a message.

804
01:25:13,292 --> 01:25:14,993
You okay?

805
01:25:15,572 --> 01:25:17,274
I thought I heard something.

806
01:25:17,774 --> 01:25:20,962
You should wake me up if you
heard something. -I just...

807
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:25,672
Come back to bed.

808
01:26:15,095 --> 01:26:16,796
Whore!

809
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:29,216
Rachels down there.

810
01:26:36,126 --> 01:26:37,828
What the hell are you doing?

811
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,923
Hey, get the fuck out of
here. Get the fuck out of here!

812
01:27:46,119 --> 01:27:49,868
Youre okay. You just need some help. -Dont
touch me. Dont touch me. Just fuck off.

813
01:27:49,903 --> 01:27:51,605
Fuck off!

814
01:28:35,881 --> 01:28:37,791
Come here.
-Anna.

815
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:42,149
No, no. -Anna, please.
-Go away.

816
01:28:42,184 --> 01:28:45,167
Go. -Im just going to stand right
here. Im not gonna come closer.

817
01:28:45,203 --> 01:28:48,614
I just need to talk to you. -I dont
want to hear anything you have to say.

818
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,462
Wheres Tom?

819
01:28:58,336 --> 01:29:04,819
Hes lying to you. He always does. Hes
a good liar. -I know hes a good liar.

820
01:29:05,851 --> 01:29:08,055
We went behind your back for months.

821
01:29:08,695 --> 01:29:11,698
Hes just done it to you...
-I know hes cheating.

822
01:29:13,172 --> 01:29:14,875
I know.

823
01:29:16,413 --> 01:29:20,106
Anna... He killed Megan.
-No, we dont... We dont know that.

824
01:29:20,141 --> 01:29:21,945
Hes dangerous.
-We dont know anything!

825
01:29:22,436 --> 01:29:25,824
Anna, you need to leave. -No. -You
need to leave. You need to take Evie

826
01:29:25,859 --> 01:29:28,742
and you need to leave.
-No. -Get out of here. -Im not leaving him.

827
01:29:30,408 --> 01:29:32,454
Its hardly the first
time hes had an affair.

828
01:29:34,148 --> 01:29:37,912
Its not about the affair.
And you know that, deep down.

829
01:29:37,947 --> 01:29:41,273
Anna, please just come with me.
-Im not leaving him.

830
01:29:41,307 --> 01:29:43,011
Please come with me.

831
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:47,974
Anna, dont. Dont! Please.
-Come in the house, honey.

832
01:29:49,912 --> 01:29:54,323
I saw you, Tom. You motherfucker, I
saw you! You murderer!

833
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:58,962
You fucking murderer! You killed her!
You fucking killed her, I know it!

834
01:30:00,127 --> 01:30:01,829
Youre un-fucking-believable.

835
01:30:01,921 --> 01:30:04,635
Now listen. Listen to me. Megan got
into his car that night.

836
01:30:04,636 --> 01:30:07,828
You think I dont remember. You
thought I blacked out. I saw you.

837
01:30:07,828 --> 01:30:12,827
Why did Megan get in your car? Did
Megan get in your car? -No! -Yes, she did.

838
01:30:13,917 --> 01:30:16,118
Tell her the truth. Just tell
her the truth right now.

839
01:30:16,154 --> 01:30:18,962
You attacked me in that tunnel,
because I saw her with you.

840
01:30:18,963 --> 01:30:21,210
I found Megans phone.

841
01:30:27,887 --> 01:30:29,590
I found it.

842
01:30:31,934 --> 01:30:35,152
So, all those phone calls.
They werent from Rachel.

843
01:30:37,435 --> 01:30:40,682
So were you fucking her
while she was here, working?

844
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:44,399
While she was looking
after our daughter?!

845
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:49,699
You were so tired all the time.

846
01:31:00,713 --> 01:31:02,417
Its all about Evie.

847
01:31:04,282 --> 01:31:06,247
Thats right.

848
01:31:08,908 --> 01:31:10,944
Tom, give her to me.
-Its all right.

849
01:31:15,112 --> 01:31:18,157
Tom, give her to me. Please.
Please give her to me.

850
01:31:18,287 --> 01:31:22,185
I think she needs changing. Please? -Its
gonna be fine. -Please just give her to me.

851
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:27,128
Let her go. Youre going to hurt her.
-Change her here. Okay, Ill change her.

852
01:31:27,163 --> 01:31:29,619
Let her go.
Youre gonna hurt her.

853
01:31:42,698 --> 01:31:44,399
911, whats your...

854
01:31:47,796 --> 01:31:49,497
Whats your emergency?

855
01:32:00,539 --> 01:32:02,243
No no, stay. Stay.

856
01:32:10,404 --> 01:32:12,106
Do you need a drink?

857
01:32:12,381 --> 01:32:14,083
No.

858
01:32:20,863 --> 01:32:22,565
Yeah, you do.

859
01:32:33,594 --> 01:32:36,394
All those things that you said I did.

860
01:32:38,997 --> 01:32:41,923
Those terrible things.
I didnt do any of them.

861
01:32:44,795 --> 01:32:48,359
You just watched me suffer.
You made me feel so worthless.

862
01:32:50,627 --> 01:32:53,333
You made me think that
everything was my fault.

863
01:33:03,186 --> 01:33:04,889
Drink it.

864
01:33:12,596 --> 01:33:14,466
You told me I got you fired.

865
01:33:17,466 --> 01:33:19,168
But, I didnt.

866
01:33:22,484 --> 01:33:25,998
You know, I saw Martha
on the train. -Drink it!

867
01:33:33,306 --> 01:33:38,189
I saw Martha on the train. And
she told me that you were fired

868
01:33:38,225 --> 01:33:41,998
because you were fucking
everyone in the office!

869
01:34:04,063 --> 01:34:05,765
Rachels down there.

870
01:34:06,305 --> 01:34:08,007
Wait here.

871
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:45,472
You want to get in the car?

872
01:34:46,844 --> 01:34:48,546
Whats going on?

873
01:34:48,867 --> 01:34:50,569
Dont worry about it.

874
01:34:51,046 --> 01:34:52,747
Come on.

875
01:35:12,391 --> 01:35:15,635
Okay, Im here. What is it?

876
01:35:19,122 --> 01:35:20,823
I just want to go to the woods.

877
01:35:40,987 --> 01:35:42,689
What is it with you crazy women?

878
01:36:09,222 --> 01:36:10,923
Is this what you want?

879
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:13,881
No.

880
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:20,143
Like this?

881
01:36:25,484 --> 01:36:27,265
What?
-Im pregnant.

882
01:36:33,202 --> 01:36:34,904
Congratulations.

883
01:36:37,297 --> 01:36:39,000
I thought you should know.

884
01:36:40,685 --> 01:36:42,387
You thought I should know?

885
01:36:43,854 --> 01:36:47,261
Theres a chance it could be yours.
-Then get an abortion.

886
01:36:49,688 --> 01:36:51,932
Or if its Scotts,
do whatever you want.

887
01:36:52,805 --> 01:36:54,557
But if its not then... Get rid of it.

888
01:36:59,403 --> 01:37:02,292
You can be as involved as you want.

889
01:37:04,637 --> 01:37:07,416
Youre a shitty nanny. What makes you
think youre gonna be a good mother?

890
01:37:11,028 --> 01:37:12,905
Why did you bring me
there in the first place?

891
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:15,949
Because I thought it would be
fun to have you both around.

892
01:37:23,777 --> 01:37:26,029
I played your game
so you could fuck me

893
01:37:26,033 --> 01:37:28,970
in between Evies playdates.
-I dont need another kid.

894
01:37:29,262 --> 01:37:32,462
Certainly not with you. -I took
care of your kid to be near you!

895
01:37:34,997 --> 01:37:37,724
You fucked Anna because you
couldnt fuck Rachel anymore!

896
01:37:37,759 --> 01:37:39,929
And you fucked me because
you couldnt fuck Anna!

897
01:37:39,963 --> 01:37:43,782
Take us all away and youre
just a pathetic, impotent man!

898
01:38:01,814 --> 01:38:03,551
Youre not gonna get rid of me.

899
01:38:05,105 --> 01:38:07,564
Youre gonna pay for this
child for the rest of your life.

900
01:39:11,701 --> 01:39:13,404
Youre like a dog.

901
01:39:15,337 --> 01:39:20,479
Like one of
those unwanted, mistreated dogs.

902
01:39:22,931 --> 01:39:27,849
You can kick them, but they
keep coming back to you.

903
01:39:28,895 --> 01:39:30,597
Thinking that somehow
if theyre good...

904
01:39:30,711 --> 01:39:33,118
Youre not doing this again.

905
01:39:34,738 --> 01:39:39,239
Youll love them. -This is what
you do. Youre not doing this to me.

906
01:39:41,605 --> 01:39:43,847
You brought this on yourself, Rachel.

907
01:39:45,509 --> 01:39:48,934
If you had just stayed
away that one night...

908
01:39:51,572 --> 01:39:54,199
Just left us all alone.

909
01:39:57,586 --> 01:39:59,827
You brought this on Megan.

910
01:40:00,452 --> 01:40:02,577
In a way, you killed her.

911
01:40:06,069 --> 01:40:07,770
But I didnt.

912
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:11,559
You did.

913
01:40:30,516 --> 01:40:32,219
You did this to me in our marriage.

914
01:40:34,578 --> 01:40:37,222
You made me fucking crazy.

915
01:40:42,448 --> 01:40:46,319
Do you have any idea what its like
to be married to a fucking blur?

916
01:43:34,954 --> 01:43:36,657
I had no choice. He was...

917
01:43:38,224 --> 01:43:39,926
He would have killed me.

918
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:44,345
I never wanted to hurt him.

919
01:43:49,411 --> 01:43:51,113
It was self-defense.

920
01:43:55,845 --> 01:43:57,547
She had no choice.

921
01:43:58,448 --> 01:44:00,242
Tom would have killed her.

922
01:44:02,573 --> 01:44:04,645
I saw the whole thing.

923
01:44:08,771 --> 01:44:10,474
Rachel was right about Megan.

924
01:44:13,112 --> 01:44:14,814
She was right about everything.

925
01:45:00,739 --> 01:45:03,039
We are tied forever
now, the three of us.

926
01:45:07,256 --> 01:45:10,059
Bound forever by the story we
share.

927
01:45:44,457 --> 01:45:48,177
Today, I sit in a different car.
And I look ahead.

928
01:45:49,603 --> 01:45:51,331
Anything is possible.

929
01:45:51,365 --> 01:45:54,989
Because I am not the
girl I used to be.

930
01:46:07,733 --> 01:46:12,097
