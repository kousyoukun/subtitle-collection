1
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,864
My husband used to tell me

2
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,367
I have an overactive
imagination.

3
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,569
I can't help it.

4
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,037
I mean, haven't you ever been

5
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,440
on a train and wondered
about the lives

6
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:16,008
of the people
who live near the tracks?

7
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,077
The lives you've never lived.

8
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,915
These are things I want to know.

9
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,753
Twice a day, I sit in
the third car from the front

10
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:31,223
where I have the perfect view
into my favorite house.

11
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,858
Number 15 Beckett road.

12
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,435
I don't know when exactly.

13
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,539
I suppose I started
noticing her about a year ago,

14
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,042
and gradually,
as the months went past,

15
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,878
she became important to me.

16
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:15,067
I'm not the girl I used to be.

17
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,403
I think people can see it
on my face.

18
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,321
She's what I lost.

19
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:41,059
She's everything I want to be.

20
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,298
I imagine she's a painter.

21
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,002
She's creative.

22
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,471
He's a doctor or an architect.

23
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,811
He has a good laugh.

24
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,080
She can't cook.

25
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,986
I wonder what they say
to each other

26
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,487
before they go to sleep.

27
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,399
Today her name is Jess;
Tomorrow it could be...

28
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,501
Lisa or Amber.

29
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,504
It all depends on the day;
It depends on my mood.

30
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:07,179
The truth is,
I don't know her name.

31
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,482
I don't know if she paints or
whether he has a good laugh.

32
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,653
I just know they know love.

33
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,625
Sometimes I catch myself
trying to remember

34
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:23,128
the last time I had meaningful
contact with another person.

35
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,408
I used to live two doors down,
number 13 Beckett road.

36
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,112
- No.
- It was my first home.

37
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,047
We bought it together.

38
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,783
- It was ours. -You didn't
even like having him over.

39
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,385
I hated it.

40
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,921
Every day,
I tell myself not to look.

41
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,961
But then I look.

42
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,803
Are you alone?

43
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,306
Yeah.

44
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,207
No, it's...
Come. It's all yours.

45
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,245
- Okay.
- Your baby's so cute.

46
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,414
- Oh, thank you.
- Hi, baby!

47
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,915
Is it a... is it a boy?

48
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,350
Yeah!

49
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,786
So sweet.
How ol... how old is he?

50
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,754
- Six months.
- Six months.

51
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,827
So sweet.

52
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,601
Shh.

53
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,203
Here.

54
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,335
A teacher once told me I was

55
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,170
a mistress
of self-reinvention.

56
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,005
Down the center line,

57
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,375
open, around and together...

58
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,977
I wasn't really sure
what it meant at the time.

59
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,912
Around and up.

60
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,514
But since moving here,

61
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,049
I've come to understand it.

62
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,324
Ardsley-on-Hudson
is boring and routine.

63
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,728
It's a fucking baby factory.

64
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,833
I want to start my life
over again.

65
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:46,304
So far, I've been
a rebellious teenager...

66
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,075
lover...

67
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,010
Waitress...

68
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:55,447
Gallery director...

69
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,449
Nanny...

70
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,419
and...

71
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:01,920
A whore.

72
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,191
And not necessarily
in that order.

73
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,901
I can't just be a wife anymore.

74
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,903
That's why I...

75
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:20,439
Stay awake at night
staring at the ceiling.

76
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,110
In fact, the only time
i feel like myself

77
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,380
is when I'm running.

78
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:30,549
You always felt that way?

79
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,154
Maybe since I was...

80
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,423
- About 17.
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,559
With Mac.

82
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:44,296
Mac? Who's Mac?

83
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,232
My brother's best friend.

84
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,201
My brother who died.

85
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,078
I tend to smile
when I'm nervous.

86
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,047
Sometimes I laugh.

87
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,393
For a year, Mac and I lived
in this hunting cabin.

88
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,998
We started fucking.

89
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,874
We were the saddest people
we knew.

90
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,445
But in a way,
that cabin made us happy.

91
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,783
No one could find us.

92
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,886
Everyone thought we were dead.

93
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:43,188
And if you were
to run away today,

94
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,824
right now, where would you go?

95
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,471
I read once that
when a train hits,

96
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,407
it can rip the clothes
right off of you.

97
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,150
I'm pretty sure Scott thinks

98
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,754
the nanny job is gonna
make me less restless.

99
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,657
Make me want to get pregnant.

100
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,458
And that's not the case?

101
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,061
When I finish work every night,

102
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,063
I run home
and I get in the shower

103
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,432
and I wash the smell
of that baby off of me

104
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,434
as fast as I can.

105
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,212
Ah.

106
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,415
When you woke up this morning,

107
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:47,118
I went and I brought you
back to bed with me.

108
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,887
And when I was feeding you,

109
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,957
we heard daddy singing
from the kitchen, didn't we?

110
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:09,441
Aw, daddy came upstairs
with a beautiful breakfast

111
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,710
that he made for mommy,
didn't he?

112
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,612
Yes, he did.

113
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,113
Thank you, Megan.

114
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,548
Oh.

115
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,417
Whew... ah...

116
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,419
- There.
- -There you go.

117
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,954
Come here.

118
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,956
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Oh.

119
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,729
Oh, hello.

120
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,670
I swear, I sometimes feel like
my heart is gonna explode.

121
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,238
- I mean, look at her.

122
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,840
Look at her.

123
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,478
You're not sleeping.

124
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,848
Hello? -:
You're not sleeping.

125
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,183
Hello?

126
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,185
- Hello?

127
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,124
- Is that another hang-up?
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,092
And grab the corners.

129
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,528
Mm.

130
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,299
And straight.

131
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,368
I got another job.

132
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,770
You what?

133
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,572
I'm really sorry, Anna.

134
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,978
I thought you were happy here.
I mean, you seemed happy here.

135
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,513
I am.

136
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,683
It's just, this isn't what I do.

137
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,985
Take care of children?

138
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,054
Or laundry.

139
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,957
Another gallery headhunted me.

140
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,395
That's great.

141
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,564
The thing is,
it starts tomorrow.

142
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,634
I'm out all day tomorrow.

143
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:45,203
- That is so uncool.
- I hate to leave you like this

144
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,206
without child care, but...
You don't have a job.

145
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,479
Okay, that sounded wrong.

146
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,381
I know that
you're busy volunteering.

147
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,416
It's not the volunteering.

148
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,151
It's all the shopping,

149
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,587
it's spending hours
in the farmers' market...

150
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,222
It's finding
the right foods for her,

151
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,657
it's pureeing sweet potatoes,

152
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,159
and I do all of this
at the same time...

153
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,994
As I'm nursing.

154
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,697
Maybe you should go
back to work, too.

155
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,100
Mothers need to work.

156
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:16,735
It's actually better
for the kid.

157
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,336
And how would you know?

158
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,413
Your key.

159
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,416
There's no job more important
than raising a child.

160
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,687
Megan, please. I...

161
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,780
- Rachel. What are you doing?

162
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,081
Give me my baby.

163
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,283
Rachel, what are you doing?

164
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,422
Hello?

165
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,164
Oh.

166
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,901
- Thank you.
- Here.

167
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,536
Mm. Beautiful.

168
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,242
How many times
has she texted you today?

169
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,444
I don't know.

170
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,480
She called the landline
three times.

171
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,282
Oh.

172
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,317
- You have to talk to her.
- I know. I-i...

173
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,652
It's getting crazy.

174
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,354
I will. I know, I know, I know.

175
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,723
- Okay.
- It's gonna be fine.

176
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,693
Isn't it always fine?

177
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,695
Don't I always make
everything fine?

178
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,831
Stop.

179
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,599
Who gives a shit?
It's your birthday.

180
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,035
Are you sure you don't want me
to take you out tonight?

181
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,770
- No, I like it at home.
- Call Megan.

182
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,738
Ask her to come back.

183
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,610
She just quit.

184
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,011
She what?

185
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,847
She just told me
she got another job.

186
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,849
Oh.

187
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:14,385
Shame. Thought you guys were
kind of a good team together.

188
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,487
Mm.

189
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,957
So did I.

190
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,548
Hey, it's tom.
Sorry I missed you.

191
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,283
- I'll get right back to you.

192
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,219
Hey, tom. It's me.

193
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:59,223
Uh, I just wanted
to wish mama a happy birthday.

194
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,826
- Happy birthday, mama.
- Rachel.

195
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,161
Jesus.

196
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,564
No, no, no, no, no.

197
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,232
No, don't, Cathy.
Please stop it.

198
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,767
- Relax. Relax!
- Cathy, come on!

199
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,803
I just... I just need some
to go to sleep.

200
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,171
That's all.
I just need... I just...

201
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,073
I just need a little bit
to go to sleep.

202
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,542
What brought this on?

203
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,914
He posted another picture
of the baby.

204
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,782
- It was a cute picture.
- Yeah?

205
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,484
Yup.

206
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,687
Facebook and drunk ex-wives
do not make good friends.

207
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,424
I got it. I got it.

208
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,827
All right.
Let's get you to your room.

209
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:43,768
Rachel, you have to stop
calling them, okay?

210
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,308
I really appreciate this room.

211
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,477
I do.

212
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,214
I thought that
i would just be here for...

213
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,850
For a couple of weeks or months.

214
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,551
Yeah, that was two years ago.

215
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,957
Get some sleep.

216
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,890
Ivf rarely works the first time.

217
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,626
Would you like a moment?

218
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,329
It's okay, sweetie.

219
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,065
We're gonna try again.

220
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,467
We can't afford to do it again.

221
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,504
Well, when we can, we will.

222
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,939
I wonder what she's looking at.

223
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,876
Or if she even sees
this train at all.

224
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,325
Who is that man?

225
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,337
The next
station is ardsley-on-Hudson.

226
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,354
What is she doing?

227
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,465
She's throwing it all away.

228
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,433
Anna, I fell asleep last night

229
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,668
thinking of you.
I dreamed about kissing

230
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,037
the inside of your thighs
and holding your breasts.

231
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,073
- -God, I wish

232
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,008
I was fucking you right now.

233
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,378
Anna, I love you.

234
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,547
I love you so much.

235
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,582
When it happened to me,

236
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,018
I found dozens of e-mails.

237
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,754
Tom told her that he never
felt like this before.

238
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,423
He said it wouldn't be
that much longer

239
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,627
-until they were together.

240
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,929
I know what they say,

241
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:08,366
and you shouldn't check
his e-mail.

242
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,801
It was stupid.

243
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,903
But when I, um...

244
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,206
When I saw
it was from the realtor,

245
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,942
I thought that it was just spam.

246
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:21,145
And then I realized that
they were kisses, not x's,

247
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,881
and my husband was fucking
a century 21 agent.

248
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,716
That sucks.

249
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,785
It does.
Her name was Anna Boyd,

250
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,054
and he was in love with her.

251
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:35,393
Come here for one second.

252
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,462
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd,"
but just yell it, all right?

253
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,098
Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

254
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:46,270
That bitch is living
in my house.

255
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,072
I picked everything
in that house.

256
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,474
I picked everything.
I picked the dining table,

257
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,476
the kitchen table.

258
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,679
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked tom

259
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:57,081
on the same table
that her baby eats at.

260
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,016
I just want to tell her.

261
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,087
Oh, I wish I could tell her.

262
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,755
I picked everything
in that house.

263
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,591
I fucking picked
everything in that house.

264
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,699
I...

265
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:17,968
I could never find the words
to describe how I felt

266
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,604
when I read that e-mail.

267
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:24,442
But this morning, I did.

268
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,510
I did.

269
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,979
When I saw that woman...

270
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:32,149
Kissing someone else, just...

271
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:34,618
I... betraying her husband,

272
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,788
I felt... I felt it.

273
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,058
I felt pure rage.

274
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,864
It was like something
had been taken from me again,

275
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,167
and... just thought
if I could...

276
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,637
If I could,
I'd just go to her house

277
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,406
and I'd go and...

278
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:58,209
Find her sitting
at the kitchen table,

279
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,677
and I'd just...

280
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,313
I'd wrap my hand
in her long blond hair,

281
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:03,714
and I'd jerk her head back.

282
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,683
I'd just jerk it back.

283
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,885
And then I'd pull it down
to the ground,

284
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,322
and I would just...
Smash her head

285
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:14,125
all over the floor!

286
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,749
Move! Get out of my way!

287
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,417
Move! Move.

288
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,072
Hey!

289
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,341
Hey!

290
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,121
You whore!

291
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,256
Jesus Christ, Rachel.

292
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,091
Uh, what the hell
is wrong with you?

293
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,629
I spent the past hour
driving around looking for you.

294
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,667
You... you scared
the shit out of Anna.

295
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:12,169
- Do you know that?

296
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,238
She thought you were gonna...

297
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,840
She-she wanted to call
the police, so just...

298
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:23,180
- Leave us alone.

299
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:25,215
You can ruin your own life
if you want to,

300
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,717
but you're not
gonna destroy ours.

301
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,353
I'm not gonna
protect you anymore.

302
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,858
Oh, my god.

303
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,827
God.

304
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:39,530
God.

305
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,447
Rachel?

306
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,715
Open the door.

307
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:00,451
Cathy, I just...
I just need a sec.

308
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,453
Are you okay?

309
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,822
Rachel, open the door.

310
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,390
I have a stomach flu.

311
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,225
- Okay? I just...
- You don't have a flu.

312
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,661
What the fuck, Rachel?

313
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:11,929
I'm not stupid!

314
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:13,897
Rachel!

315
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,299
Cathy, just go away!

316
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,177
Come here for one second.

317
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,079
Just one second.

318
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,581
- Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."

319
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:33,017
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

320
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:41,925
- You whore!

321
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,471
No!

322
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,756
Anyone counting days one to 90,

323
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:48,726
who would like
to share a day count?

324
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,494
Hey, I'm Jason.
I'm an alcoholic.

325
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,262
Welcome, Jason.
- I've got 22 days back.

326
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:54,264
- Nice.
- There we go. -Good job.

327
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,035
Anyone else?

328
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,543
Hi. I'm-I'm Rachel and...

329
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,011
Welcome, Rachel.

330
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,847
Hi, Rachel.
- And this... thank you.

331
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:12,249
This is day one, i-i suppose.

332
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,365
Um...

333
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,834
I'm here because I...

334
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,240
because I...

335
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:38,876
Because I woke up,
um, covered in blood.

336
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:45,315
And I had... I had bruises
all over my arm and, um...

337
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,652
It's usually from
when I've fallen

338
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,654
and someone's helped me up.

339
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,893
My husband...

340
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:59,196
He used to tell me
what I'd done the night before.

341
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,768
And I learned,
when you wake up like that,

342
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,303
you just say you're sorry.

343
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,843
You just say you're sorry
for what you did

344
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,978
and you're sorry
for who you are,

345
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,514
and you're never
gonna do it again.

346
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,883
But you do. You do it again.

347
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,654
And there's some time missing.

348
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,658
I need to remember.

349
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,996
I need to remember.

350
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,331
Okay.

351
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,033
Thank you, Rachel.

352
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,773
Am I... am I right?

353
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:45,108
- Or am I nuts?
- No.

354
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,644
Make an effort!
You know, we all worked hard.

355
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,813
That was a charity event.

356
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,182
- You don't wear that.
- No, you don't.

357
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,152
Right? It was that,
um, the homeless thing.

358
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:56,386
I don't remember
what it was called.

359
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:57,821
Oh, oh, safe shelter.

360
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,157
Yeah.
That was a tube top, right?

361
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,358
Yup. It was.

362
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,659
I can't.

363
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,628
Why say, "yes, I'm gonna go,

364
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,129
"and I can't wait because

365
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,965
it's fun to dress up."
Then dress up.

366
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,466
Do you like
devil's eggs, Martha?

367
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,501
Deviled eggs? Yeah, I do.

368
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,804
- Deviled egg.
- Thank you for making them.

369
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,574
The classics. Do you want
to try one, anybody?

370
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:20,043
Uh, those go outside. I don't
want the eggs with the dessert.

371
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,645
It doesn't fucking matter
where they go, okay?

372
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,680
So do you want to put them
here? Do you want them

373
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,082
with your hot dogs
or you can put a couple

374
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,850
with your quinoa if you want to.

375
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,752
Do you want to put them with
your other salad and your corn?

376
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,420
Rachel.
- Put a couple on the wall?

377
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:31,655
Rachel.

378
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,156
I'm fine, tom!

379
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,758
- Stop it.
- Come on.

380
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,593
You didn't back me up.
You never have my back.

381
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,228
You never have my back.

382
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,097
- That's my boss's wife.

383
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,698
Probably got me fired
back there.

384
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,234
I don't give a fuck.
I'm your wife.

385
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,169
- I'm your wife and you never...
- Rachel.

386
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,105
- You never fucking support me.
- Rachel, please stop it.

387
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:50,574
Hey, come on.
Need you to focus here.

388
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:51,742
Don't fucking talk

389
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:52,876
- to me like that!
- Relax!

390
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,111
Relax!

391
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,426
- Rachel.
- Hi, Cathy. I'm sorry.

392
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,861
- There you are. -I need
to get my shit together.

393
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:12,429
- I'm s...
- Shh.

394
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,198
You must be Ms. Watson.

395
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,767
I'm detective Riley.

396
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,769
This is detective gaskill.

397
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,637
We need to ask you
a few questions.

398
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,539
What's this about?

399
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,374
Want to sit down?

400
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,982
Can you tell me
where you were Friday night?

401
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,190
I-i was at work
in the city, and then...

402
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,594
and then I went
to visit my husband.

403
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,296
You mean your ex-husband?

404
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,598
Yeah.

405
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,067
So I got off the train

406
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,435
at ardsley-on-Hudson,

407
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:53,437
and then...

408
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,772
And then I decided
that it was a bad idea.

409
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:58,442
Around what time
did you reach that conclusion?

410
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:01,078
I was back here by 11:00.

411
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,147
Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,184
On your way back here,
did you stop anywhere?

413
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,287
No.

414
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:12,756
And what time did you
take the train there?

415
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,324
Um, 6:00. I...

416
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,926
So...

417
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:18,128
What'd you do
during those hours in ardsley,

418
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,930
if you weren't seeing
your ex-husband?

419
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,675
Do you remember
seeing this woman?

420
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,444
She worked for your ex-husband.

421
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,279
She's gone missing.

422
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:37,714
What do you mean, she's missing?

423
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,716
Well, her husband said
she never came back home

424
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:42,586
the same night you got off
the train in ardsley-on-Hudson.

425
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,056
I was just... I was just...

426
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,491
Do you know Megan hipwell?

427
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:48,959
- No!
- Did you see her?

428
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,460
No, I don't...
I don't think so.

429
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,729
Is that because
you were inebriated?

430
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,034
Just to clarify, you said
you were at work Friday?

431
00:33:57,036 --> 00:34:00,037
Are you referring to your job
in public relations?

432
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,471
Right.

433
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:02,873
It's my understanding
you were fired

434
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,374
from that job over a year ago

435
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,610
because of
your drinking problem.

436
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,158
Okay. That's enough for now.

437
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,531
If you're able
to remember anything else,

438
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:30,033
give us a call.

439
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,602
Did you really get fired?

440
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,204
Look, I didn't want you to worry

441
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,939
that I couldn't pay the rent.

442
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:38,708
If you don't have a job,
then what do you do every day?

443
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,545
I...

444
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,713
I-i ride the train.

445
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,415
You what?

446
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,585
I ride the train
to New York and back.

447
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,520
That's what
your alimony's paying for,

448
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,890
just tickets to nowhere?

449
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,892
That's really fucking weird,
Rachel.

450
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:56,927
O-okay, okay.

451
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,133
I just, i-i got on the train,

452
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:06,203
and then... and then I...
I got off the train.

453
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:08,438
I don't know.
It's-it's very unclear.

454
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,607
You don't remember anything,
do you?

455
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,312
You know, I read about this man
in long island...

456
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:17,280
Who blacked out.

457
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,316
He left a bar,

458
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:21,485
drove to the house
that he'd grown up in,

459
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:23,086
stabbed its occupants to death.

460
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:24,888
He woke up the next morning,

461
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,424
oblivious to what he did
until the police

462
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:28,892
came to get him.

463
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:30,327
- Rachel!
- What? What?

464
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:32,629
You have to leave.
I can't do this anymore.

465
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,565
- I'll give you a few weeks...
- Hold on.

466
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,801
Hold on.

467
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,336
Detective Riley!

468
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:42,272
- Yeah, I agree with you.
- Detective Riley!

469
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,908
I saw someone
with Megan hipwell,

470
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,476
but, uh, not on Friday night.

471
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,311
She...

472
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,114
She was having an affair,
she had a lover... that's what

473
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:53,750
- I'm trying to tell you.
- I thought you didn't know her.

474
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:55,485
No. But I s... but I saw her.

475
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,954
- You saw her where?
- I-i saw her from the train.

476
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:00,190
She was standing on-on the deck
with this man.

477
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:02,325
- With her husband, Scott
hipwell? -No, it wasn't him.

478
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,294
This... man was different,

479
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:06,263
and th-they were...
They were kissing.

480
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:08,932
Wow. That's pretty
coincidental, isn't it?

481
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,202
You just happen to be on a train

482
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:14,204
at the same exact moment
that a woman you don't know,

483
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,173
but somehow recognize,
is cheating on her husband?

484
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:17,941
I-i know it sounds crazy.
Um...

485
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,709
Neighbors saw a drunk woman

486
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:22,979
in the vicinity of her house
Friday night.

487
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:26,016
Megan hipwell does bear
a resemblance to Anna Watson.

488
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,685
Mrs. Watson reported

489
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,621
that you go to their house
sometimes uninvited,

490
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,523
and that on one occasion
you actually broke in

491
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,025
and took their child.

492
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,229
Let me give you some advice.

493
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:41,064
Don't go back to Beckett road.

494
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,333
Don't contact your ex-husband.

495
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,635
Don't go anywhere near
Anna Watson or her baby.

496
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,337
Are you listening to me?

497
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,639
Yes.

498
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,876
You don't live there anymore.

499
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,878
Stay away.

500
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,822
You know, I lie all the time.

501
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,027
I lie to Scott.

502
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:14,397
I lie to you.

503
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,400
I mean, I know that's not
the point of therapy, but...

504
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,038
i have to keep things vague.

505
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,508
Jumble up all the men
and the exes, the lovers.

506
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,714
It doesn't matter who they are.

507
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:34,284
It matters
how they make me feel.

508
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,860
Lying is like taking a trip.

509
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:53,570
It's like having a secret.

510
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:56,973
It's like touching yourself
and no one else knows.

511
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,917
Except you.

512
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,387
But you're just pretending.

513
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,893
You're just pretending
to touch yourself.

514
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,873
Scott's possessive, jealous.

515
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,244
He likes to own me.

516
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,349
He figures out all my passwords.

517
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,321
Which is kind of sexy.

518
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,630
So, when I came home last night,

519
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:58,101
Scott was on my laptop,
wondering why...

520
00:38:58,103 --> 00:38:59,536
Scott's behavior is not normal.

521
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,707
It's a form of emotional abuse.

522
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,211
Are you ever afraid of Scott?

523
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,982
It's not abuse.

524
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:15,552
Not if you don't care,
and I don't.

525
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:18,621
Maybe it's become
a normal state for you.

526
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,227
Is it normal I think about you
all the time?

527
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,839
"Almost exactly a week ago,

528
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,841
"Megan hipwell walked out
of number 15 Beckett road

529
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:39,843
"and disappeared.

530
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,378
"No one has seen her since.

531
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,546
"Neither her phone
nor her bank cards

532
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,949
"have been used since Friday.

533
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,726
"A wonderful woman,

534
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,396
"an intensely private person
with a warm heart.

535
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,832
"She lost a brother
when she was 16,

536
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,502
"and both her parents died
a few years ago.

537
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,940
"Scott hipwell urges
anyone with information

538
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:13,109
to please come forward."

539
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,359
You Megan's friend?

540
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:30,960
Yes. Rachel.

541
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,262
Come in.

542
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,135
- Do you want a coffee?
- Uh, sure. Thank you.

543
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,477
Sorry it's a mess.

544
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,879
I've been hunting for her
social, her birth certificate.

545
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,381
And the cops need a lot.

546
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,886
Have we met somewhere before?

547
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:59,122
I... I don't think so.

548
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,423
And you know Megan from...?

549
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:02,425
Uh, from the gallery.

550
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:03,626
Oh, you're an artist?

551
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,463
Uh, well, I like to think so.

552
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,269
So, you said on the phone

553
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:16,239
you wanted to tell me
something about Megan.

554
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:20,610
What did you want to tell me?

555
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:23,346
I saw your wife...

556
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,915
With someone...

557
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:27,650
On Friday morning.

558
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,852
With who?

559
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:31,454
She was up there on your porch.

560
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:34,190
Um... I saw her from the train,

561
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:37,961
because I commute
to Manhattan every day

562
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:40,363
and I go straight past here.

563
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,370
She kissed him.

564
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,541
They were kissing.

565
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,213
I'm sorry.

566
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:59,916
I know this is
a terrible thing to hear.

567
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,553
Yeah.

568
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:08,024
I know how it feels.

569
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,562
What did he look like?

570
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,568
He-he was...
He was average height.

571
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,136
He had dark hair.

572
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,806
And they were out there
on the porch?

573
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:25,575
Yes.

574
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,383
Fuck.

575
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:41,925
Fuck.

576
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,465
Oh, no, no, no. Thank you.

577
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,437
Okay, sure.

578
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,945
Uh, it could... i-i don't know.

579
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:04,347
Maybe it's a good thing.

580
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:07,050
Could mean she's all right.

581
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:09,686
She just ran off with someone.

582
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,688
Right.

583
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:20,096
Has she talked to you?

584
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,297
Oh, no, n...

585
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:22,932
Um, I haven't heard anything.

586
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,868
But you know her well enough
to know where we live.

587
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,637
Megan doesn't have many friends.

588
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:32,809
Well, I used to live nearby,
and, um, she and I,

589
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:36,212
we took... we took yog...
We took pilates... together.

590
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:38,047
I-i think I should go.

591
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:40,917
I feel like I've taken up
too much of your time, and...

592
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:43,620
So sorry
to have had to tell you...

593
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,121
Tell you that in that way and...

594
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,890
Hey.

595
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,727
Do you think you'd recognize
him again if you saw him?

596
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:54,063
I don't know.

597
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:56,299
There's a guy. A therapist.

598
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,802
His name's, um, ab...

599
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,171
Abdic... abdic.

600
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,844
Uh, kamal... abdic.

601
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,249
Is that who you saw?

602
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:15,351
I don't know.

603
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:17,820
I really can't tell.

604
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,556
She spends a lot of
fucking time with her shrink.

605
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,138
That's him.

606
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,141
I remember. That's him.

607
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:39,676
I remember.
That's him.

608
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,188
I'm sorry.

609
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,024
Where are you? Where are you?

610
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,961
Where are you?

611
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,331
Where are you?

612
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,100
Stay away from me!

613
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:38,901
This is so stupid.

614
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,105
He makes every conversation
about getting pregnant.

615
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,541
And every time we go there...

616
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:47,243
Where?

617
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,679
To that subject.

618
00:45:49,681 --> 00:45:51,814
What subject?

619
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,786
Megan.

620
00:45:56,788 --> 00:45:58,454
What subject?

621
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,607
It's okay.

622
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,645
- Megan.

623
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:24,914
No!

624
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,085
Megan.

625
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:33,122
All right, Megan.

626
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,128
We shouldn't.

627
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,898
No.

628
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,232
Megan.

629
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,171
Don't make it impossible
for us to work together.

630
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,778
Meg...

631
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,047
Megan, I could lose my practice.

632
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,517
I don't give a fuck!

633
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,520
I don't give a fuck
about your fucking practice!

634
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,123
I don't give a...

635
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:08,858
縌u? es lo que t? quieres
de m?

636
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,960
縌u? es lo que t?/i>
quieres de m? Ah, ah, s?

637
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:13,095
縌u? es lo que t? quieres
de m? Me est醩 volviendo...

638
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:15,531
e est醩 volviendo loco!
e est醩 volviendo loco!

639
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,271
Dr. kamal abdic...

640
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:24,307
Dr. kamal abdic
has been brought in

641
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:25,975
for questioning
on the disappearance

642
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:28,311
of ardsley-on-Hudson resident
Megan hipwell.

643
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:32,782
He was, according to sources,
Mrs. hipwell's psychiatrist.

644
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:39,522
For the first time in ages,
I have purpose.

645
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,460
Or at least
I have a distraction.

646
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,664
I want Megan to show up
safe and sound.

647
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:50,700
I do.

648
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:52,635
Yeah!

649
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,240
Just not quite yet.

650
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,250
Hi.

651
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:08,684
What's wrong?

652
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:10,686
Abdic's been released.

653
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:13,222
- What?
- There wasn't enough evidence.

654
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:16,659
And because I'm the one that
got him arrested, he talked.

655
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:18,661
A lot.

656
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:20,529
They'll... they'll build a case
against him.

657
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:22,331
It'll just take some time.

658
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:24,500
Are you totally sure he's
the guy you saw Megan with?

659
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:25,635
Yes.

660
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,571
You sure as fuck better be.

661
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,206
I don't understand.

662
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,041
- The police think I did it.
- Yeah, but he's...

663
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:34,377
- He's the one... -He told them
Megan's miserable.

664
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:38,180
That I'm a jealous,
controlling husband.

665
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:41,717
I'm sure that they're just...
Trying to rule you out.

666
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:44,754
Abdic told them I'm abusive.

667
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:49,592
When she walked out,
i... I didn't go after her.

668
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,694
I never called to check on her.

669
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,932
I went to a sports bar,
for fuck's sake.

670
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:57,199
Got drunk.

671
00:48:57,201 --> 00:48:59,101
No, we j...
We just need to find

672
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,603
more evidence on abdic.

673
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,772
I've spent the whole day
going through her stuff.

674
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,874
There's no e-mails.
There's nothing.

675
00:49:04,876 --> 00:49:06,309
No letters, no e-mails.

676
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:07,944
Nothing.

677
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:11,514
For a second, I thought about
contacting abdic myself.

678
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:16,552
- Fucking phone won't stop!

679
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,388
This is Scott.

680
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,590
Yeah, yeah.
H-hold on, hold on.

681
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:23,426
Do you mind?

682
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,240
Oh. Come here.

683
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:51,153
Oh, you're heavy. You're heavy.

684
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,322
- You're getting a little fatty.
- Rachel, no.

685
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,824
Anna, get in the house.

686
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:06,469
Your-your... your wife hit me
on Friday night!

687
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:07,770
No. What are you talking about?

688
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:09,638
Yes. Yes, yes, you did.
Yes, you did!

689
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,476
And then sh... and then she...
She-she got in your car.

690
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:15,945
No. She said you yelled at her
that night.

691
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:17,546
No, that is not what happened.

692
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:19,949
She was... she was in
the tunnel, and she-she hit me.

693
00:50:19,951 --> 00:50:21,650
I don't want to argue
in the street.

694
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,386
The middle of the day
and you're drunk.

695
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:24,854
Look, I'm not drunk, tom.

696
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,393
My wife is scared of you.

697
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:32,128
Of what?

698
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,132
I don't even know
if that's a joke or not.

699
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:38,167
- Let's start with child
abduction. -That's bullshit.

700
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:39,702
You know that's not
how it happened.

701
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:42,405
You and I both know
what you're capable of.

702
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,812
Were you just
at Scott hipwell's house?

703
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,518
Why are you at
Scott hipwell's house?

704
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,086
Because I'm helping...
I'm helping him.

705
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:58,521
- How?
- To try and find Megan.

706
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:00,823
You don't even know Megan.

707
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,927
Rach...

708
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:07,930
I don't think
you're helping anybody.

709
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,701
So you're here because you want

710
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:14,570
to uncover lost memories.

711
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:17,006
- Is that correct?
- You have an accent.

712
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:18,340
Pardon?

713
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:19,875
No, sorry, i-i, um,

714
00:51:19,877 --> 00:51:22,578
wasn't expecting you
to have an accent.

715
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,447
Well, you have an accent.

716
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,085
Where are you from?

717
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:31,220
I'm an American citizen.

718
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:33,522
But I guess you're not here
to talk about me.

719
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:35,558
- Unless you are.
- No, no, I...

720
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,761
Sorry, I was just, uh, just
trying to make conversation.

721
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,963
The blackouts.

722
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:42,765
You're experiencing blackouts?

723
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:44,066
Mm-hmm.

724
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:46,168
Do you want to tell me
about them?

725
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,440
Mm...

726
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,477
Well, when I...

727
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:58,114
Wake up, and when someone
tells me what I've done...

728
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,152
it just doesn't feel like me

729
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:05,588
or like something
that I would do.

730
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:08,390
I feel bad about it, but, um...

731
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:10,993
But it's like
it's so far removed,

732
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,995
that I have a...

733
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,299
i just don't feel bad enough.

734
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,235
And you want to take
personal responsibility

735
00:52:19,237 --> 00:52:21,237
for what you've done,
but you find it difficult

736
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:24,406
to feel accountable because
you can't even remember it.

737
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,078
Yeah?

738
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,014
Yeah.

739
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:34,650
So, Rachel, besides drinking...

740
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,787
Because you clearly drink.

741
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:41,056
You've been drinking today,
haven't you?

742
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:50,933
What else do you enjoy?
Do you have any hobbies?

743
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,537
I like to draw. Art.

744
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:56,372
I guess.

745
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:57,806
Good. We can try to...

746
00:52:57,808 --> 00:52:59,675
Regain some of your memories
by drawing them.

747
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,977
I've tried it. It doesn't work.

748
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:03,846
And have you ever tracked
all the way back

749
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,381
to when you started
drinking heavily?

750
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,051
When was that?

751
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,189
It was with tom.

752
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:15,991
When I couldn't get pregnant.

753
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:17,993
Who's tom?

754
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:20,062
He's my ex-husband.

755
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:21,897
You want to talk about that?

756
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,935
I really wanted a baby.

757
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:37,646
And we tried everything,
and nothing worked.

758
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,452
And it just absolutely...

759
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,866
It just broke my...

760
00:53:57,868 --> 00:54:00,936
My heart, and...

761
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,272
So it got really sad.

762
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:05,174
And then, um...

763
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:10,846
and then the-the booze
just, uh, broke us.

764
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,617
Good.

765
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:15,985
Tell me more.

766
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:24,193
I used to watch
this perfect couple.

767
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,798
And they were just the...

768
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,234
Embodiment of...

769
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:33,902
True love.

770
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:37,106
It's like the kind of love
you always want.

771
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:43,345
And then she betrayed him.

772
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:51,186
And it sparked something in me.

773
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,494
Why are you really here, Rachel?

774
00:54:58,496 --> 00:55:02,131
Because I'm afraid of myself.

775
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,574
July 5th.

776
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:15,277
1:33 and 1:34.

777
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:17,413
1:37.

778
00:55:17,415 --> 00:55:18,781
She calls again 1:38.

779
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,483
And then she calls again
at 1:44, 1:45,

780
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,352
2:15 P.M.

781
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:25,487
And July 6th.
You get the point.

782
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:29,325
She sometimes texted him
dozens of times a day.

783
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:31,827
But these are all
from an unknown number.

784
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,196
- Mm, and unknown is Rachel.
- You have a log

785
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,964
of the calls;
You don't have a log

786
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,533
of what they're saying
to each other.

787
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:42,304
Look, um...
Has she been back to the house

788
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:44,773
- since the incident with your
child? -Not that I know of.

789
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:46,342
Well, then you may have a case

790
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:48,010
for harassment
in the second degree,

791
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,852
but these are texts,
they're not threats, so...

792
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,949
She has been hanging around
Scott hipwell's house.

793
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:55,351
A lot.

794
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:57,486
Yeah, I'm aware.

795
00:55:57,488 --> 00:55:59,655
There are a lot
of loose ends here

796
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:02,124
that suggest something,
but they don't add up to much.

797
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:04,993
If you could bring me
something more solid...

798
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:07,196
What more do you need?

799
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:08,497
Evidence.

800
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:10,466
Real evidence.

801
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,206
You sure your husband

802
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,408
doesn't want to stay in touch
with his ex-wife?

803
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:20,809
What? No.

804
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:22,344
She's harassing us.

805
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:23,746
Is that what he calls it?

806
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:09,158
Hi.

807
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,865
- Hey.
- Hi.

808
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,400
Hi.

809
00:57:51,402 --> 00:57:53,001
Reporters are in my yard.

810
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:54,403
They're everywhere.

811
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:56,438
I didn't know where else to go.

812
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,040
Come in.

813
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,420
The detective just...

814
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:15,958
The detective
just told me something

815
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,360
I've wanted to hear
for a long time.

816
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,867
She's pregnant.

817
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:29,538
She told her shrink but not me.

818
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,377
I wanted a family.

819
00:58:35,379 --> 00:58:38,280
But she fought me
every step of the way.

820
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,950
We always fought about it.

821
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,889
Did Megan ever say anything
about me to you?

822
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,633
She loved you.

823
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,404
She loved you in ways

824
00:59:02,406 --> 00:59:06,041
that people only dream
of being loved.

825
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:09,504
You shouldn't be here.

826
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,944
I just...

827
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,780
I need to tell someone.

828
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,716
Just once.

829
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:24,119
Just say it out loud.

830
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,854
I want to tell you.

831
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:31,893
And then I'll be gone.

832
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:33,862
I swear.

833
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,137
I got pregnant.

834
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:47,976
I was 17.

835
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,879
I had her by myself.

836
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:58,553
She had dark eyes
and blond hair.

837
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:06,995
I expected it to be hard,
but it wasn't.

838
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:13,769
It was easy.

839
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:17,706
Because I loved her.

840
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:20,208
I loved her.

841
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:25,781
We called her Elizabeth.

842
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:27,683
Libby.

843
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:31,787
Libby.

844
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:40,128
It was December.

845
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:43,098
We had gotten in a fight,
me and Mac.

846
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:49,171
He'd gone off
and... and left.

847
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:53,308
The roof was leaking.

848
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:56,912
It was freezing cold, so...

849
01:01:56,914 --> 01:02:00,048
I got in the tub.

850
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,718
I brought Libby in with me.

851
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,987
Put her on my chest.

852
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:09,391
Her head just... under my chin.

853
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,668
I fell asleep.

854
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,442
I let her go.

855
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,512
I let her go.

856
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,582
I let her go.

857
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,585
I let her go.

858
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:41,356
I...

859
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:42,824
I couldn't look.

860
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,128
I didn't want to see it.

861
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,497
I didn't want to see it.

862
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,903
I wrapped her in a blanket,

863
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:57,806
and I buried her.

864
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,123
And...

865
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:19,761
Mac went out that night...

866
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,667
and he never came back.

867
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,938
He never came back.

868
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,493
I missed our home.

869
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:02,604
So one day, when I was drunk,

870
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:05,240
I decided to go there.

871
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:12,781
The front door was open;
It's not like I broke in.

872
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,863
And then I heard Evie.

873
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,533
Who's Evie?

874
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:33,735
Tom's baby.

875
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,559
And I know this sounds...

876
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:00,662
Insane...

877
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:03,064
But I just wanted to hold her.

878
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,970
Just for a moment.

879
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:37,565
Rachel.

880
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:41,469
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

881
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:43,305
Rachel...

882
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,250
Give her to me.

883
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:57,419
Shh, shh, shh.

884
01:05:57,421 --> 01:05:59,254
Oh. Mommy's here.

885
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:02,590
- Shh. Oh.

886
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:04,993
Shh.

887
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,331
I wasn't going to hurt her.

888
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,368
I would never hurt her.

889
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,741
I just wanted to hold her.

890
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:46,501
"Partially decomposed
body found.

891
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:49,037
"Female body found. Death a
result of blunt force trauma.

892
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,172

893

900
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:09,924
- Mr. hipwell!

901
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,268
What's wrong?

902
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,104
I'm sorry.

903
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,894
This reminds me of when I used
to watch you getting dressed

904
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:21,362
before going back to her.

905
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:29,637
Back to this house.

906
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:35,743
I actually miss being
the other woman.

907
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:37,745
Did you enjoy
cheating on Rachel?

908
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:40,648
Seriously?

909
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:43,184
Can we not fixate on her?

910
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,554
I saw her again today.

911
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:48,289
Where?

912
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,391
This afternoon, when the police
brought Scott back home.

913
01:08:50,393 --> 01:08:51,793
She was across the street.

914
01:08:56,066 --> 01:08:58,766
And when she saw me,
she got aggressive.

915
01:08:58,768 --> 01:09:00,902
Aggressive how?

916
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:03,571
What if Rachel killed Megan?

917
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:05,507
Rachel did not kill Megan.

918
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:07,275
Then why is she creeping
around Scott's house?

919
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:09,344
- She's dangerous,
and you know it. -Anna, Anna.

920
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:12,981
Sweetheart...
Rachel is a sad person.

921
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:16,017
She's completely harmless.

922
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,646
What are you doing here?

923
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:46,681
How di... how did you get in?

924
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,687
Come here.

925
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,355
Have a beer with me.

926
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:57,892
Uh, I'm-I'm not drinking
right now.

927
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:06,234
Detective Riley
came to see me last night.

928
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:11,306
It turns out,
I'm not the father.

929
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:13,975
Neither is the shrink.

930
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,813
Did my wife confide in you
about a third man?

931
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:23,818
Sit down.

932
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:29,958
Sit down!

933
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:35,029
Look, I don't know, I don't
know what this is about...

934
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:36,331
Oh, come on.

935
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:38,933
You and Megan
were such good friends.

936
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,737
You must've known.

937
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:45,940
Admit it.

938
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:47,875
Admit what?

939
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,745
Admit that you never even
fucking met my wife.

940
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:56,484
The detective said
you didn't even know Megan.

941
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:01,189
She used other words, too.

942
01:11:01,191 --> 01:11:03,391
Alcoholic.

943
01:11:03,393 --> 01:11:04,926
Maybe even mentally unstable.

944
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:06,394
I am sorry.

945
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:08,129
I was honestly just
trying to help you.

946
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:12,600
You're tom's crazy ex.

947
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:15,036
When the fuck were you
gonna tell me that, huh?

948
01:11:15,038 --> 01:11:17,472
And now the detective
is asking if you and I are

949
01:11:17,474 --> 01:11:18,573
in a relationship?

950
01:11:18,575 --> 01:11:20,074
You?

951
01:11:20,076 --> 01:11:23,778
I would never even
get near someone like you!

952
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,313
My wife is dead.

953
01:11:25,315 --> 01:11:28,783
And you're lying to me!

954
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:30,985
What's wrong with you?

955
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:32,587
- Who does this?
- I needed to tell you

956
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:33,788
about Megan's affair,

957
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,056
and you wouldn't
have believed me

958
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:36,391
if I was just tom's ex!

959
01:11:36,393 --> 01:11:38,259
Oh, well, thank you, you know?

960
01:11:38,261 --> 01:11:40,895
For getting abdic
to point the finger at me.

961
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:44,198
For getting the cops to say
that you and I are fucking!

962
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:52,640
How are they going, huh?

963
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:55,310
You know, the sessions.

964
01:11:58,347 --> 01:11:59,814
With the doctor.

965
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,285
I wanted to know about abdic.

966
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:06,321
And i-i went to him
to help you...

967
01:12:07,957 --> 01:12:09,824
You're just a sad liar
with no life.

968
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:12,827
- You're all liars.
- Please...

969
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,549
I need to file a statement.

970
01:12:34,551 --> 01:12:35,550
Name.

971
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:36,684
Rachel Watson.

972
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:39,053
Pete, I got this.

973
01:12:51,134 --> 01:12:53,968
You wanted to file a statement?

974
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,737
I'm listening.

975
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:58,406
Scott hipwell just assaulted me.

976
01:12:58,408 --> 01:13:01,909
You mean your new boyfriend,
Scott hipwell?

977
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:04,345
No, we-we were just friends.

978
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:06,147
But that's what you wanted,
isn't it?

979
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:08,015
I mean, you got him
to stay overnight

980
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:09,183
- at your apartment, right?
- No, you-you...

981
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:10,885
You need the context...

982
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:13,187
I know the context, but
what I'm trying to determine

983
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:15,857
is when your obsession
with Mr. hipwell began.

984
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:18,693
Was it before or after
his pregnant wife was murdered?

985
01:13:18,695 --> 01:13:21,429
I mean, you were neighbors
at one point.

986
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:22,563
I met him after.

987
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,599
After being questioned by me,

988
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:27,201
you befriend another even more
obvious suspect than yourself,

989
01:13:27,203 --> 01:13:30,104
and then you manage to get him
to incriminate himself,

990
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:32,340
all the while
hoping he'll fuck you.

991
01:13:32,342 --> 01:13:34,842
I came here trying to help you!

992
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:37,912
He just assaulted me
in my own house!

993
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:42,116
You were seen
in the area that night.

994
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:44,585
There are several hours

995
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,888
that you say
you can't account for.

996
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,924
It was Scott.
Scott hipwell killed his wife.

997
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:51,959
No, he didn't.

998
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:56,597
Surveillance footage
from a sports bar

999
01:13:56,599 --> 01:14:00,001
accounts for Mr. hipwell's
whereabouts that night.

1000
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:05,006
You're lying. You're lying.

1001
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:11,279
Tell me what happened.

1002
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,885
It's okay.

1003
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:20,221
Tell me.

1004
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,459
I don't know.

1005
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:27,862
Did you murder Megan hipwell?

1006
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:45,980
Hi.

1007
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,084
I need to see you.

1008
01:14:50,086 --> 01:14:52,053
Can you please come over?

1009
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:07,969
I can still see her dark eyes.

1010
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:10,271
I can smell her skin.

1011
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:13,908
I can feel how cold she was.

1012
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,844
Forgive yourself.

1013
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,025
You don't have to be afraid
of being alone.

1014
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:36,297
You're not alone.

1015
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:54,448
The next
station is ardsley-on-Hudson.

1016
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,892
You'll be fine.

1017
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,794
You and your baby will be fine.

1018
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:49,971
Why are you following me?

1019
01:16:49,973 --> 01:16:52,440
Why are you here?

1020
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:53,975
Uh...

1021
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:56,210
I could ask you
the same question.

1022
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:58,245
I saw you.

1023
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:00,081
I saw you that night
in the tunnel.

1024
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,549
I saw you there.

1025
01:17:01,551 --> 01:17:03,884
- And i-i know I saw you there.
- All right.

1026
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:05,152
Lady, I live here.

1027
01:17:05,154 --> 01:17:07,788
I'm always in that tunnel.

1028
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:10,324
But-but what did you,
what did you see?

1029
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:11,892
What happened that night?

1030
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:13,127
What did you see?

1031
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,495
All right, you, uh...

1032
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:15,796
You busted your ass.

1033
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:17,264
You fell.

1034
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:19,767
I felt sorry for you.
I tried to help you up.

1035
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:22,303
You told me to fuck off,
so I fucked off.

1036
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:23,638
Was I with anyone?

1037
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,306
- Was I, was I alone?

1038
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:26,641
Was i... what happened?

1039
01:17:26,643 --> 01:17:28,609
I don't know.

1040
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:30,177
You were wasted.

1041
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:32,780
You're always wasted.

1042
01:17:32,782 --> 01:17:35,983
That's all I can tell you.

1043
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,518
Whoa, take it easy.

1044
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,356
I need you to tell me
the fucking truth.

1045
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:44,258
What did you see that night?

1046
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:47,995
What happened that night?

1047
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:50,431
Uh... I don't know.

1048
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:54,235
I'm assuming it's the worst.

1049
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:01,275
God.

1050
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:06,047
Come here for one second.

1051
01:18:06,049 --> 01:18:07,815
Just one second.

1052
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:09,617
Say, "fuck you, Anna Boyd."

1053
01:18:09,619 --> 01:18:11,986
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!
- Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

1054
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:14,522
I wonder if she knows
that I fucked tom on the...

1055
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:19,360
When I saw that woman

1056
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:22,363
kissing someone else,
betraying her husband,

1057
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:24,832
I felt it.

1058
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:26,734
Pure rage.

1059
01:18:26,736 --> 01:18:29,637
If I could, I'd go to her house,

1060
01:18:29,639 --> 01:18:31,572
-I'd find her sitting and...

1061
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:34,542
I'd smash her head

1062
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:37,778
all over the floor!

1063
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,257
Cathy,

1064
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:52,426
thank you for all
you have done for me.

1065
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:54,195
I'm sorry to leave this way.

1066
01:18:54,197 --> 01:18:56,197
I'll send for my things later.

1067
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:57,598
Love, Rachel.

1068
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:22,056
That's so true.

1069
01:19:22,058 --> 01:19:24,125
It's the worst restaurant ever.

1070
01:19:24,127 --> 01:19:26,193
Why do we keep going back?

1071
01:19:26,195 --> 01:19:27,862
Martha.

1072
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:30,364
Martha.

1073
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:34,235
Rachel?

1074
01:19:34,237 --> 01:19:36,237
Wow, I haven't seen you
in a million years.

1075
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,372
Um...

1076
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:40,307
Yeah, i-i wanted to call you,

1077
01:19:40,309 --> 01:19:43,277
um, but tom said I should
just leave it alone.

1078
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:44,979
- Oh.
- Um...

1079
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:47,982
I'm so sorry.

1080
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:49,283
For what?

1081
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:51,619
For the barbecue.

1082
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,954
And I just need you to know

1083
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:56,891
that i-i don't remember
anything and, um,

1084
01:19:56,893 --> 01:19:58,592
I just completely blacked out.

1085
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:00,261
Everyone had a little
too much to drink,

1086
01:20:00,263 --> 01:20:01,796
- so it's okay.
- I know, but, uh,

1087
01:20:01,798 --> 01:20:04,598
with the eggs
and then i-i screamed at you.

1088
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,902
That I was that abusive,
i just feel...

1089
01:20:07,904 --> 01:20:10,838
I just feel so ashamed about it.

1090
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,072
Um...

1091
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:14,742
I don't...

1092
01:20:14,744 --> 01:20:18,579
Tom... tom said that, um...

1093
01:20:18,581 --> 01:20:20,314
That I smashed your plate.

1094
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:21,749
I don't...

1095
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:24,518
Tom was fired...
Fired because of how I behaved.

1096
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:29,790
You felt sick and you took
a nap in our guest bedroom.

1097
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:31,492
You want to lie down?

1098
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:33,494
- Come with me.
- Okay.

1099
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,131
Excuse us.

1100
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:39,200
Rachel, are you feeling better?

1101
01:20:39,202 --> 01:20:41,335
You guys can
stay tonight if you want.

1102
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:42,970
- No, no. That's fine, thanks.
- Okay.

1103
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:44,371
I think I'd remember

1104
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:46,273
if you caused a scene.

1105
01:20:46,275 --> 01:20:48,342
I'm so sorry.

1106
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:51,512
Get up.

1107
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:56,984
And then tom took you home.

1108
01:20:56,986 --> 01:20:59,353
- Sorry, tom...
- Stop fucking saying that!

1109
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:01,388
- I know you're sorry!
- Sorry.

1110
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,190
What's your fucking problem?
Can't even focus on me.

1111
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,359
Can't even fucking stand up!
What is wrong with you?

1112
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:06,361
Can you stand?

1113
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:10,698
Fucking disgusting.

1114
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:13,367
N-no.

1115
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,169
No.

1116
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:16,804
Yeah, tom got fired

1117
01:21:16,806 --> 01:21:18,472
'cause he couldn't keep
his dick in his pants.

1118
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:20,674
You did nothing wrong.

1119
01:21:20,676 --> 01:21:22,109
Nothing.

1120
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:31,719
Wake the fuck up, Rachel.

1121
01:21:31,721 --> 01:21:32,887
Wake the fuck up!

1122
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:34,455
- Wake up!

1123
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:43,230
You can sleep out here.

1124
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:45,199
We all felt so bad for you.

1125
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:47,868
He's such a bad guy.

1126
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:49,870
Oh, god.

1127
01:21:49,872 --> 01:21:51,739
Are you okay?

1128
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,935
Hmm.

1129
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:00,140
I need to see you.

1130
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,742
Meet me at 3:00.

1131
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:04,578
I'm here. Where are you?

1132
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:06,814
I can't.
I'm stuck watching Evie.

1133
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,128
What are you doing up?

1134
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:24,498
Picking up after Evie.

1135
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:01,735
You whore!

1136
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:05,039
Leave us alone.

1137
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:43,077
No new messages.

1138
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:44,678
No saved messages.

01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:15,242
You okay?

1148
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:17,578
I thought I heard something.

1149
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,613
You should wake me up
if you heard something.

1150
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:21,281
I just, I...

1151
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:25,886
Well, come back to bed.

1152
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:16,336
Whore!

1153
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:28,015
Rachel's down there.

1154
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:38,192
What the hell are you doing?

1155
01:26:38,194 --> 01:26:39,293
Come here.

1156
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:43,857
Hey, get the fuck
out of here, okay?

1157
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:45,525
Get the fuck out of here!

1158
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:47,060
You're okay.
Just need some help.

1159
01:27:47,062 --> 01:27:48,262
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

1160
01:27:48,264 --> 01:27:49,763
Just need to get
a little help up.

1161
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:51,798
- Just fuck off. Fuck off!
- Come on. Come on.

1162
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,068
You're heavy. Aw.

1163
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,943
Come here.

1164
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:38,178
Anna?

1165
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,780
No.

1166
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:41,581
- Anna, please, please?
- No, go away.

1167
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:42,749
- There's... okay.
- Go!

1168
01:28:42,751 --> 01:28:44,518
I'm-I'm gonna stand right here.

1169
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,153
I'm not gonna come closer.
I just need to talk to you.

1170
01:28:46,155 --> 01:28:48,155
I don't want to hear
anything you have to say.

1171
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:49,589
Where's tom?

1172
01:28:57,799 --> 01:28:59,933
He's lying to you.

1173
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:01,601
He-he always does.

1174
01:29:01,603 --> 01:29:03,003
He's-he's a good liar...

1175
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:05,505
I know he's a good liar.

1176
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,941
We went behind your back
for months.

1177
01:29:07,943 --> 01:29:09,843
He's just done it to you.

1178
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:11,211
I know he's cheating.

1179
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:15,282
I know.

1180
01:29:15,284 --> 01:29:18,018
Anna, he-he killed Megan...

1181
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,354
No, we don't,
we don't know that.

1182
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:22,222
- He's dangerous.
- We don't know anything.

1183
01:29:22,224 --> 01:29:24,191
- Anna, you-you need to leave.
- No. No.

1184
01:29:24,193 --> 01:29:26,126
You need to leave.
You need to take Evie

1185
01:29:26,128 --> 01:29:27,694
- and you need to leave,
get out of here. -No.

1186
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:30,063
- It's not safe...
- I'm not leaving him.

1187
01:29:30,065 --> 01:29:33,066
It's hardly the first time
he's had an affair.

1188
01:29:33,068 --> 01:29:35,502
It's not about the affair.

1189
01:29:35,504 --> 01:29:37,337
And you... you know that
deep down.

1190
01:29:37,339 --> 01:29:38,872
Anna, please,

1191
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,640
- just come with me.
- I'm not leaving him.

1192
01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:41,742
Please come with me.

1193
01:29:43,912 --> 01:29:46,313
- Anna, don't, don't...
- Come in the house, honey.

1194
01:29:46,315 --> 01:29:47,714
Please.

1195
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:52,486
I saw you, tom.
You motherfucker!

1196
01:29:52,488 --> 01:29:54,154
I saw you, you murderer!

1197
01:29:54,156 --> 01:29:56,089
You fucking murderer!

1198
01:29:56,091 --> 01:29:58,225
You killed her!
You fucking killed her!

1199
01:29:58,227 --> 01:29:59,993
I know it!

1200
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:01,862
Un-fucking-believable!

1201
01:30:01,864 --> 01:30:03,196
Now, listen. Listen to me.

1202
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:04,364
Megan got into his car
that night.

1203
01:30:04,366 --> 01:30:05,832
You think I don't remember.

1204
01:30:05,834 --> 01:30:07,367
You thought I blacked out!
I saw you.

1205
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:08,869
Why did Megan get in your car?

1206
01:30:08,871 --> 01:30:10,771
- Did Megan get in your car?
- No!

1207
01:30:10,773 --> 01:30:12,839
Yes, she did.

1208
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:14,908
Tell her the truth.

1209
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,710
Just tell her
the truth right now.

1210
01:30:16,712 --> 01:30:19,246
You attacked me in that tunnel
because I saw her with you.

1211
01:30:19,248 --> 01:30:20,280
I found Megan's phone.

1212
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:29,489
I found it.

1213
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:34,161
So, all those phone calls,
they weren't from Rachel.

1214
01:30:37,298 --> 01:30:41,535
So, were you fucking her
while she was here working?

1215
01:30:41,537 --> 01:30:44,037
While she was looking after
our daughter?

1216
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:49,476
You... you were
so tired all the time.

1217
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,622
It's all about Evie.

1218
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:04,724
That's right.

1219
01:31:06,728 --> 01:31:07,894
Your daddy loves you.

1220
01:31:07,896 --> 01:31:09,095
Tom?

1221
01:31:09,097 --> 01:31:12,065
- Give her to me.
- That's right.

1222
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:13,733
Your daddy loves you.

1223
01:31:13,735 --> 01:31:16,603
Tom, give her to me, please?

1224
01:31:16,605 --> 01:31:18,638
- Please give her to me.
- It's fine.

1225
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,639
I think she needs
changing, please.

1226
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:21,241
No, she's gonna be fine.

1227
01:31:21,243 --> 01:31:23,310
Please just give her to me.
Oh, okay. Shh, shh.

1228
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,078
- Let her go. You're going to
hurt her. -Change her here.

1229
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,146
- Change her here.
- You're... okay.

1230
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:27,180
I'll change her. Let her go.

1231
01:31:27,182 --> 01:31:28,248
You're gonna hurt her.

1232
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:30,150
- Shh.

1233
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:32,252
You're okay, you're okay.

1234
01:31:32,254 --> 01:31:34,020
Shh, shh.

1235
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:36,656
Shh.

1236
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:43,763
911, what's your...

1237
01:31:46,134 --> 01:31:47,834
What's your emergency?

1238
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,981
No, no. Stay.

1239
01:32:00,983 --> 01:32:02,916
Stay.

1240
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:11,157
Do you need a drink?

1241
01:32:11,159 --> 01:32:13,126
No.

1242
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:21,868
Yeah, you do.

1243
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:36,016
All those things
that you said I did.

1244
01:32:38,353 --> 01:32:41,621
Those terrible things...
I didn't do any of them.

1245
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:45,725
You just watched me suffer.

1246
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:48,495
You made me feel so worthless.

1247
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:53,133
You made me think that
everything was my fault.

1248
01:33:02,544 --> 01:33:04,511
Drink it.

1249
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:14,120
You told me I got you fired.

1250
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:17,691
But I didn't.

1251
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:24,297
You know, I saw Martha
on the train...

1252
01:33:24,299 --> 01:33:25,899
Drink it!

1253
01:33:33,074 --> 01:33:35,308
I saw Martha on the train.

1254
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:37,978
And she told me
that you were fired

1255
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:41,181
because you were fucking
everyone in the office!

1256
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:05,772
Rachel's down there.

1257
01:34:05,774 --> 01:34:08,141
Wait here.

1258
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:46,446
You gonna get in the car?

1259
01:34:46,448 --> 01:34:47,981
What's going on?

1260
01:34:47,983 --> 01:34:50,450
Don't worry about it.

1261
01:34:50,452 --> 01:34:52,852
Come on.

1262
01:35:11,572 --> 01:35:13,406
Okay, I'm here.

1263
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:15,809
So, what is it?

1264
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:20,714
I just want to go to the woods.

1265
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:43,136
What is it with you crazy women?

1266
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:10,563
This what you want?

1267
01:36:11,566 --> 01:36:13,666
No.

1268
01:36:17,304 --> 01:36:19,506
Like this?

1269
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:25,912
What?

1270
01:36:25,914 --> 01:36:28,648
I'm pregnant.

1271
01:36:32,153 --> 01:36:34,187
Congratulations.

1272
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,325
I thought you should know.

1273
01:36:39,327 --> 01:36:41,227
You thought I should know?

1274
01:36:43,063 --> 01:36:45,465
There's a chance
it could be yours.

1275
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:47,200
Then get an abortion.

1276
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:50,804
Or if it's Scott's,
do whatever you want.

1277
01:36:50,806 --> 01:36:54,307
But if it's not,
then get rid of it.

1278
01:36:58,913 --> 01:37:02,182
You can be as involved
as you want.

1279
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:04,951
You were a shitty nanny.

1280
01:37:04,953 --> 01:37:06,953
What makes you think
you're gonna be a good mother?

1281
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:12,525
Why did you bring me there
in the first place?

1282
01:37:12,527 --> 01:37:15,495
Because I thought it would be
fun to have you both around.

1283
01:37:18,699 --> 01:37:19,699
Come on.

1284
01:37:23,504 --> 01:37:25,772
I played your game
so you could fuck me

1285
01:37:25,774 --> 01:37:27,373
in between Evie's playdates.

1286
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:29,609
I don't need another kid.
Certainly not with you.

1287
01:37:29,611 --> 01:37:32,245
I took care of your kid
to be near you!

1288
01:37:34,448 --> 01:37:37,150
You fucked Anna 'cause you
couldn't fuck Rachel anymore,

1289
01:37:37,152 --> 01:37:39,185
and you fucked me 'cause
you couldn't fuck Anna!

1290
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:42,188
Take us all away
and you're just a pathetic,

1291
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:43,623
impotent man!

1292
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:03,309
You're... you're not
gonna get rid of me.

1293
01:38:03,311 --> 01:38:07,480
You're gonna pay for this child
for the rest of your life.

1294
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:16,055
I can just... yeah.

1295
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:13,179
You're like a dog.

1296
01:39:15,049 --> 01:39:17,951
Like one of those unwanted,

1297
01:39:17,953 --> 01:39:20,186
mistreated dogs.

1298
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:24,057
And you can kick them.

1299
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:28,261
They keep coming back to you.

1300
01:39:28,263 --> 01:39:30,663
Thinking that somehow
if they're good...

1301
01:39:30,665 --> 01:39:33,099
You're not doing this again.

1302
01:39:33,101 --> 01:39:35,568
You'll love them.

1303
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:36,936
This is what you do.

1304
01:39:36,938 --> 01:39:40,106
You're not doing this to me.

1305
01:39:40,108 --> 01:39:43,142
You brought this
on yourself, Rachel.

1306
01:39:44,778 --> 01:39:48,214
If you had just stayed away
that one night...

1307
01:39:50,417 --> 01:39:54,087
Just left us all alone.

1308
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:59,859
You brought this on Megan.

1309
01:39:59,861 --> 01:40:02,462
In a way, you killed her.

1310
01:40:02,464 --> 01:40:03,896
Mm-hmm.

1311
01:40:05,265 --> 01:40:07,433
But I didn't.

1312
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:11,004
You did.

1313
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:23,683
No!

1314
01:40:23,685 --> 01:40:26,285
No...

1315
01:40:29,157 --> 01:40:32,225
You did this to me
in our marriage.

1316
01:40:33,794 --> 01:40:36,729
You made me fucking crazy.

1317
01:40:41,502 --> 01:40:43,569
Do you have any idea

1318
01:40:43,571 --> 01:40:45,838
what it's like to be
married to a fucking blur?

1319
01:43:34,074 --> 01:43:37,510
I had no choice. He was...

1320
01:43:37,512 --> 01:43:41,347
He would've killed me.

1321
01:43:41,349 --> 01:43:44,083
I never wanted to hurt him.

1322
01:43:48,355 --> 01:43:50,323
It was self-defense.

1323
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:57,530
She had no choice.

1324
01:43:57,532 --> 01:43:59,498
Tom would've killed her.

1325
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:03,903
I saw the whole thing.

1326
01:44:08,175 --> 01:44:10,142
Rachel was right about Megan.

1327
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:14,280
She was right about everything.

1328
01:44:59,393 --> 01:45:01,127
We are tied forever now,

1329
01:45:01,129 --> 01:45:02,528
the three of us.

1330
01:45:06,566 --> 01:45:10,002
Bound forever
by the story we share.

1331
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:46,472
Today I sit in a different car.

1332
01:45:46,474 --> 01:45:49,008
And I look ahead.

1333
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:51,143
Anything is possible,

1334
01:45:51,145 --> 01:45:54,413
because I am not the girl
I used to be.
