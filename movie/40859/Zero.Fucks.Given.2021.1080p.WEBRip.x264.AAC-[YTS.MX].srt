3
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:22,758
ZERO FUCKS GIVEN

4
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:09,842
- You've got the mollies on you?
- I called the guy.

5
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:15,758
Call him!

6
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:17,300
Call him.

7
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,092
I sent him a message.
He said he'd be here in an hour.

8
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:26,217
An hour?

9
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,300
It's Spain!

10
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:40,717
Can you buy me a drink?

11
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,883
But I'm full of love, you see!

12
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,550
I want to cry, I want to be happy
and at the same time, I...

13
00:09:22,717 --> 00:09:24,217
Come on, it's the drug.

14
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,592
I want a bit of everything...

15
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:33,883
I wanted to tell you earlier...
when I told you...

16
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,883
You and me... We can... Sorry.

17
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,300
- I said it like that...
- I'd prefer a "Let's go home together"

18
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,258
than a "I'm looking for love".

19
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:47,342
But I am really looking for it!

20
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:48,508
- No!
- Yes!

21
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:51,467
You're looking for it...
like looking for your phone...

22
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,050
- It stresses me out!
- I just want to... you know...

23
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:58,092
It's the drug, Arthur! The drug!

24
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:14,925
Move your... your big sticky feet!

25
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:33,717
If I throw up,
it'll be like a stream.

26
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:35,925
Get your hand off.

27
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:37,633
It's fine!

28
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:39,675
Make me some noodles.

29
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:43,008
- Make you some "poodles"?
- Noodles with ketchup and cheese.

30
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,758
- I'm begging you...
- Ah, I thought you said "poodles".

31
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,925
- Yeah, sure...
- No, it's OK.

32
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:50,050
I'll make some...
noodles with ketchup?

33
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,383
All right, let's go!

34
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,300
You prefer to live with a Smarties...

35
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,300
like, you're married for life...

36
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:01,592
like, forever...

37
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:03,883
and every time you say
"I'm in a relationship",

38
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,217
he pops up.

39
00:11:06,258 --> 00:11:08,133
Or, or...

40
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:10,300
Or, instead...

41
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,508
When you...

42
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,758
You put your keys in the keyhole

43
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:20,842
to lock and open your door at home...

44
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:24,050
there is...

45
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:25,925
acid...

46
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:28,633
rain that falls...

47
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:30,842
like 2 km from your home.

48
00:11:31,008 --> 00:11:33,383
- So it can fall on anyone.
- Acid rain.

49
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,008
- Would you rather kill people?
- No!

50
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:39,008
Maybe... well.

51
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:40,550
I dunno.

52
00:11:41,383 --> 00:11:43,217
I'd go out with the Smarties.

53
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:44,925
- Would you rather...
- Not bad.

54
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:48,675
have rubber arms so you can't hug anyone
and everything is soft,

55
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,883
like marshmallow arms.

56
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,675
Or, would you rather have 19 nipples?

57
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,467
I would rather have...

58
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:04,467
- Nineteen nipples.
- Nineteen?

59
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:07,633
But that means the first time
you're shirtless in front of a woman...

60
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:09,800
- Shit...
- So do you announce it?

61
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:10,967
Shit...

62
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:13,633
It'll come out.

63
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:17,008
- That'll come out? How?
- Well it's... It's vodka.

64
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:19,175
I'd rather have 19 nipples

65
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:21,217
because I can hide them.

66
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:24,342
Like, I can put hair on them
or something.

67
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:27,300
- It'd be nice to get a little...
- A little what?

68
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:30,717
- To get 19 nipples fondled like...
- I'm going to throw up!

69
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,175
like a guitar.

70
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:37,967
My mother had to see a client
that my father had to see.

71
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,758
So she took his car.

72
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,633
- Yeah.
- And...

73
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:47,883
So she took his car
to go to this meeting.

74
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,508
But to get to this meeting,
she had to go through a roundabout.

75
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:55,300
It's a roundabout
that's a bit out of our town,

76
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,592
but she was used to going through it.

77
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:00,508
And...

78
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:03,800
on this roundabout,
there are some decorations.

79
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,383
You see... little walls, propellers...

80
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,467
which where a bit all over the place.

81
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:10,717
And...

82
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:15,592
when she drove in,
she crashed into the roundabout.

83
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:19,133
So... she died on impact?
Just like that, instantly?

84
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,342
When someone called me...
she was dead, so...

85
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:28,883
I think so.

86
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,633
For example, my mum...

87
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:35,258
It's unbearable right now.

88
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:41,883
To see her age, to know that...
there's a process that's started that...

89
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,092
I'm going to have to witness
her decline.

90
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:50,467
It's really the end of a...
It's human decadence.

91
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:55,217
She is just very... hardcore with us.

92
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:57,883
In...

93
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:01,300
In simple phases...

94
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,175
When she's just at the table,
she'd rub her hands together like this

95
00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:10,550
before eating,
looking at all of us like...

96
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,092
It's frightening!

97
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:19,383
I don't know... She's taking us
into her long-term depression.

98
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,967
And... I love her very, very much.

99
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:26,842
I mean, to see...

100
00:14:27,592 --> 00:14:30,758
let people live to be old...

101
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:34,008
that you have to be there for that.

102
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:38,342
I mean... There's no going back.
And instead of

103
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,508
having to witness...
this downward spiral.

104
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:45,758
Maybe it's better to just hit a wall.

105
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:36,717
Suzanna?

106
00:16:37,883 --> 00:16:38,967
Sylvia?

107
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:50,133
DEREK -
SEE PROFILE OR RESPOND

108
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,133
And you think these are good conditions?

109
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,175
I don't know.
I need to work so I work.

110
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,425
You need to work, and it's a great job
but not in such conditions.

111
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:50,383
- Look at how other companies are!
- Conditions... It's always the same.

112
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,592
There are always imperfections.

113
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:55,800
Do you know the working conditions
in other companies?

114
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:59,550
If for example, if you're sick,
do you get paid?

115
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,967
I don't know, I try not to be sick.
I watch out for myself.

116
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:06,217
- I drink vodka.
- I think it's really time to act!

117
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:09,467
And it's phenomenal that
this strike is going on all over Europe.

118
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:12,008
- Where are you based?
- I don't know. In Lanzarote,

119
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:14,800
but I don't really have time
to make the revolution.

120
00:21:18,008 --> 00:21:20,758
We're going to be late.

121
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,592
Go and talk to your colleagues!

122
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,342
Some of your colleagues in Lanzarote
are on strike too.

123
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:46,633
Go and see them.
They'll explain it to you.

124
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,675
I'm sure that if we don't do anything

125
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,508
things will get worse.

126
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:54,925
Yeah,
but I don't really believe in change...

127
00:21:55,592 --> 00:21:59,550
We're not the same age
so what we can sacrifice isn't the same.

128
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:01,383
Don't believe in change? Meaning?

129
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,008
It means I have a flight
and I'd like to take it.

130
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:05,425
What about the future?

131
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:07,675
I don't even know
if I'll be alive tomorrow,

132
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:09,883
so I just want to get on my flight.

133
00:22:58,467 --> 00:22:59,550
Are you OK?

134
00:23:02,592 --> 00:23:05,300
Are you OK or not?
Why don't you respond?

135
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:07,842
About what?

136
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:11,133
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine and you?

137
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:53,758
Shit...

138
00:28:48,717 --> 00:28:51,008
Hey, Dad asks
if you'll be back for Christmas.

139
00:28:51,175 --> 00:28:53,008
I don't know if you have plans or not.

140
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:54,258
See you.

141
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:03,508
No, I won't be here for Christmas
or New Year's.

142
00:29:04,717 --> 00:29:06,883
I'm working at the time.

143
00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:10,300
I couldn't postpone.
I tried everything but they said no.

144
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:32,675
Couldn't you have at least tried
to get off?

145
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:34,508
Well... It's fine.

146
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:43,175
I just told you
I tried but it didn't work.

147
00:39:58,508 --> 00:39:59,758
Hello?

148
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:03,092
Hello Mrs Wessels,
this is Sabrina from Orange.

149
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:07,675
Could you spare me a moment
to talk about your phone consumption?

150
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:10,758
I saw that
you were on a hummingbird plan

151
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:15,175
and I see that your data consumption
was mainly abroad.

152
00:40:15,342 --> 00:40:18,258
So I wanted to suggest the cheetah plan

153
00:40:18,425 --> 00:40:22,467
which would allow you
to have unlimited downloads abroad.

154
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:24,425
Would you be interested in that?

155
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:29,217
What's the difference in cost
to the one I have now?

156
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:32,050
That's a difference of
fourteen euros and ninety cents.

157
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:34,133
And then you'll have unlimited data.

158
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,758
Then you won't get blocked
when you use up your data.

159
00:40:36,925 --> 00:40:39,883
All right, I'll take it.
I'd like to change my plan.

160
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:43,758
However, it has to be the account holder
who does the modification

161
00:40:43,925 --> 00:40:46,175
so I will ask you for some information.

162
00:40:46,342 --> 00:40:48,425
You are Sabine Wessels...

163
00:40:49,675 --> 00:40:51,258
No, it's my mother.

164
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:57,883
OK, then your mother needs to go online
and make the necessary changes.

165
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:02,717
She can either do so
from her mobile application or online.

166
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:08,050
The procedure is simple, she clicks on
"Document" on the "Add New Document" tab

167
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:13,300
and then she will be able to allow you
to make the change on her behalf.

168
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:18,008
Then you can change the phone plan.
Would that be OK?

169
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:21,508
No, that's complicated.

170
00:41:24,217 --> 00:41:27,550
Well, another solution
would be for your mother

171
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:30,342
to call the customer service directly
herself.

172
00:41:30,508 --> 00:41:33,550
It's going to be really complicated
because she's dead.

173
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:37,217
I... I understand.

174
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:43,383
What we can do is resend you the code
so that you have access...

175
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:48,008
Well, maybe the best thing would be...
to cancel the line.

176
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,467
- All right. - And your name?

177
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:54,342
Cassandre Wessels.

178
00:41:54,508 --> 00:41:58,758
What I can suggest at this point
is to cancel the subscription

179
00:41:58,925 --> 00:42:02,550
- so you can create a new one.
- All right.

180
00:42:05,217 --> 00:42:06,800
Very well.

181
00:42:06,967 --> 00:42:10,717
However,
the cancellation fee will cost 43 euros

182
00:42:10,883 --> 00:42:13,883
which you'll have to pay
in order to reopen a line in your name.

183
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:16,925
- Will that be fine?
- All right.

184
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:20,383
- Great. I'll let you do the modification.
- Thank you.

185
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:23,550
- Thank you for being a valued customer.
- Goodbye.

186
00:49:32,383 --> 00:49:36,258
In fact, the plan is simple.
I've just finished a year at Wing.

187
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,508
I'll be a cabin manager.

188
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,425
After that, I'll try out for Emirates.

189
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:43,967
- I get into Emirates...
- Emirates is tough.

190
00:49:44,133 --> 00:49:45,550
I get into Emirates,

191
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:47,800
- spend 3-4 years in Dubai...
- OK, but...

192
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:50,675
Yes, it's the perfect plan but...

193
00:49:51,508 --> 00:49:54,133
- How many languages can you speak?
- Four.

194
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,633
That's why. It's impossible for me.
They'll never take me.

195
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,883
- It's not as easy as that!
- So, you've already given up!

196
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:04,550
- Well, no, but...
- You don't even apply. That's that.

197
00:50:05,175 --> 00:50:07,717
It's not that...

198
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:09,633
- Do you want to or not?
- Of course I do!

199
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,008
You don't think it's my dream
to be walking around Dubai with a tiger?

200
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:16,175
- Well, if you want to...
- Or to have a dolphin in my jacuzzi?

201
00:50:16,342 --> 00:50:19,050
If you want to have a dolphin
and a tiger, then go for it!

202
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:21,300
But you have to be more of everything!

203
00:50:21,467 --> 00:50:25,675
You have to be more beautiful,
more smiley, more chic, and classier.

204
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:29,467
Everything is more complicated.
It's not Wing, you know!

205
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:31,175
Compared to them, we're...

206
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,883
- Great! You got your life on lock.
- We're yokels.

207
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,633
That's nice! It's great being young!

208
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,258
No, but I'll try...

209
00:50:40,925 --> 00:50:42,842
but I'm sure it won't work out.

210
00:50:43,717 --> 00:50:45,675
They're too...

211
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,467
they're too strict on language skills,
I'm telling you!

212
00:50:48,633 --> 00:50:52,383
They have thousands of applications
of people speaking seven languages.

213
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,717
I'll walk in and speak a little English
and... I will never pass.

214
00:50:56,883 --> 00:51:00,175
You want me to tell you what I think
it's all about?

215
00:51:00,342 --> 00:51:03,675
- It's not the language or whatever.
- It's hope.

216
00:51:03,842 --> 00:51:06,675
No, it's not hope!
Stop talking like a grandma!

217
00:51:06,842 --> 00:51:08,217
It's gallantry!

218
00:51:09,508 --> 00:51:11,050
That's worse!

219
00:51:11,217 --> 00:51:14,258
You talk like a grandma's grandma!

220
00:51:14,883 --> 00:51:16,550
So gallantry means energetic?

221
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:21,383
Just fake it! Fake having confidence
and everyone thinks you're hot shit.

222
01:01:55,258 --> 01:01:57,008
Take off your jacket, please.

223
01:02:06,883 --> 01:02:08,508
Thank you. Goodbye.

224
01:02:33,133 --> 01:02:34,342
Thank you.

225
01:02:51,842 --> 01:02:55,758
Forget Emirates. In Dubai for a month now,
working for a private jet company.

226
01:02:55,925 --> 01:02:58,050
Send in your CV,
they're hiring like crazy!

227
01:08:56,508 --> 01:08:59,175
It's the same job
with more responsibilities...

228
01:08:59,342 --> 01:09:01,925
It's not the same thing.
I manage the people I work with.

229
01:09:02,092 --> 01:09:04,592
And before I was under people's orders.

230
01:09:04,758 --> 01:09:08,425
The job is what you do.
You bring coffees and whatnot.

231
01:09:09,383 --> 01:09:10,383
- OK?
- Fine.

232
01:09:10,425 --> 01:09:12,425
She's managing and making the decisions.

233
01:09:12,592 --> 01:09:15,175
And we're not just serving coffee.

234
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:21,133
If it's only serving coffee,
I'd work at Starbucks, you see?

235
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:24,717
That's not what I meant... For example,
how many cabin managers are there?

236
01:09:24,883 --> 01:09:27,883
We are in the air.
There's maybe 30,000 in the company.

237
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:31,508
- And how many planes, for example?
- Damn it, I don't know!

238
01:09:31,675 --> 01:09:33,675
- Dad, you're pretending not to get it!
- No!

239
01:09:33,842 --> 01:09:35,217
- Yes, you are!
- It's...

240
01:09:36,175 --> 01:09:38,633
Dad, you're my boss
but we do the same job.

241
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,675
- Well... No.
- He does it on purpose.

242
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:44,967
It's not that...
Yes, I manage a bit more

243
01:09:45,133 --> 01:09:47,550
- but I have more experience.
- I'm cleaning up.

244
01:09:49,217 --> 01:09:50,508
Well, that's good!

245
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,758
But you agree with me

246
01:09:57,925 --> 01:10:00,842
in the end you still do things
with more responsibilities, but...

247
01:10:01,008 --> 01:10:04,217
- the job is the same, no?
- No.

248
01:10:06,092 --> 01:10:08,217
- It's not that I don't get it.
- Yes, you do.

249
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:12,133
Anyway, when you did...
You got in there,

250
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,675
because you wanted to travel,
and that's good.

251
01:10:15,842 --> 01:10:17,633
So you should continue with it.

252
01:10:19,675 --> 01:10:21,675
No, I think it's good but...

253
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:25,425
- Because you said it was a promotion.
- In reality it's a very simple...

254
01:10:25,592 --> 01:10:28,175
It's not a promotion
because it's based on a competition!

255
01:10:28,342 --> 01:10:31,967
For example, if there's a...
a passenger who gets furious

256
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:34,217
it's you who has to decide
how to handle it.

257
01:10:34,383 --> 01:10:36,883
Yes, so do I call the police,
do I get him out,

258
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:39,383
- if someone has a stroke...
- A stewardess can't.

259
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:41,550
But the captain
has to take care of that.

260
01:10:41,717 --> 01:10:45,550
Yes, but I don't want to be the pilot
of the plane. I'm the boss of...

261
01:10:45,717 --> 01:10:47,133
the flight attendants.

262
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,925
You are a stewardess.
A stewardess plus more.

263
01:10:50,092 --> 01:10:52,800
It's not "plus more",
it's chief attendant. Line manager?

264
01:10:52,967 --> 01:10:54,883
- Cabin manager!
- Cabin manager.

265
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:02,675
I don't need that, Dad.

266
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:05,175
It's not just for you,
it's for the pillows too.

267
01:11:09,967 --> 01:11:13,050
If you gave me another day
I could have sorted it out

268
01:11:13,217 --> 01:11:14,842
but you didn't warn me...

269
01:11:20,008 --> 01:11:21,592
It's not that, it's that...

270
01:11:22,133 --> 01:11:26,675
Because I had to store away
all the agency's archives,

271
01:11:27,633 --> 01:11:31,633
they were in the garage,
and there's no room now with the pickup.

272
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,717
So I put them in your room.

273
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:35,800
Pardon.

274
01:14:01,842 --> 01:14:03,092
What's up?

275
01:14:04,758 --> 01:14:05,800
Very well.

276
01:14:05,967 --> 01:14:09,383
... so it's 279,500 euros...

277
01:14:12,967 --> 01:14:15,425
Yes, it is 79,500, exactly.

278
01:14:16,342 --> 01:14:19,133
For the land registry,
I could give it to you at the visit

279
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,883
but as it's a second visit
there won't be too many issues.

280
01:14:22,675 --> 01:14:24,008
Exactly.

281
01:14:24,175 --> 01:14:26,258
And this time,
you'll be with your husband.

282
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:28,550
OK.

283
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:30,967
So we'll say Wednesday

284
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,050
at 2PM, and it'll be with me.

285
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,758
I bought it second hand

286
01:14:36,925 --> 01:14:40,300
from a friend of mine
who wanted to get a new car.

287
01:14:41,383 --> 01:14:43,508
It's a Mercedes, so it's solid.

288
01:14:43,675 --> 01:14:45,508
And parking isn't a problem?

289
01:14:47,342 --> 01:14:49,175
That's not why I got it.

290
01:14:49,342 --> 01:14:52,008
I got it because it's indestructible.

291
01:14:52,175 --> 01:14:54,550
If you drive into a tree,
the tree falls over.

292
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,508
And...
it's a question of social standing.

293
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:02,883
When the customers see you arrive,
you stand out differently.

294
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:06,675
- Well, it's true.
- That's funny.

295
01:15:06,842 --> 01:15:09,592
Well, we are in a business of image.

296
01:15:09,758 --> 01:15:12,258
And you dress like that
when you see clients?

297
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:14,175
I'm a bit more relaxed now.

298
01:15:15,717 --> 01:15:18,508
Some clients in the countryside like it
when I dress like this.

299
01:15:18,675 --> 01:15:20,550
I know I have to adapt to the client.

300
01:15:21,092 --> 01:15:22,258
And...

301
01:15:24,342 --> 01:15:27,467
When farmers see me in my leather jacket
they trust me straight away.

302
01:15:27,633 --> 01:15:31,758
If I show up with my suit,
they don't trust me.

303
01:15:31,925 --> 01:15:35,925
But when we have to deal with
real estate operations, it's a suit.

304
01:15:36,717 --> 01:15:38,050
That's what sales is,

305
01:15:38,217 --> 01:15:40,842
knowing who you're dealing with
to reassure them.

306
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,300
And the pickup plays a part in this.

307
01:15:44,842 --> 01:15:47,508
When I arrive, they say,
"Wow, it works!" It reassures them.

308
01:15:47,675 --> 01:15:50,508
The pickup is reassuring.
It's impressive!

309
01:15:51,133 --> 01:15:53,717
It may not be easy to park

310
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,092
but...

311
01:16:02,842 --> 01:16:06,883
I like being higher. You can see
the road better and you're above others.

312
01:16:26,592 --> 01:16:28,092
What are you doing?

313
01:16:28,633 --> 01:16:29,758
Why are you here?

314
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:33,008
Are you OK?

315
01:16:33,175 --> 01:16:34,967
- Weren't you sleeping?
- No.

316
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,842
Do you want some herbal tea?

317
01:16:57,717 --> 01:16:59,342
What are you checking?

318
01:17:01,342 --> 01:17:05,008
When I get up,
I check that the door is closed.

319
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:21,258
- Do you often get up at night?
- No, it's just that...

320
01:17:22,967 --> 01:17:25,175
I'm used to getting up early for work.

321
01:17:30,008 --> 01:17:32,383
I'm ready by 4 AM in the morning.

322
01:17:34,592 --> 01:17:36,342
That's what I usually do.

323
01:17:48,133 --> 01:17:49,342
What time is it?

324
01:17:50,675 --> 01:17:51,925
It's 4:20.

325
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:00,717
So where are we going afterwards?

326
01:18:00,883 --> 01:18:02,550
We're going to Moulin de Solières!

327
01:18:02,717 --> 01:18:05,758
- Moulin de Solières still exists?
- Of course!

328
01:18:05,925 --> 01:18:09,217
- Wow!
- The old bearded bouncer's still there.

329
01:18:09,967 --> 01:18:11,842
- Gandalf!
- Gandalf!

330
01:18:12,008 --> 01:18:14,842
You put your feet in and it gets hot.

331
01:18:15,008 --> 01:18:16,550
- I swear!
- Seriously?

332
01:18:16,717 --> 01:18:19,842
I brought these for you girls,
but I'll let you choose the smells.

333
01:18:20,008 --> 01:18:23,133
I saw some real French shops
so I thought of you girls.

334
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:27,383
- What's this?
- Many different body creams and stuff.

335
01:18:28,717 --> 01:18:30,508
- That's so nice!
- No worries!

336
01:18:30,675 --> 01:18:33,300
- These are samples?
- No, they're mini bottles,

337
01:18:33,467 --> 01:18:35,592
but they do look like a spray for a day.

338
01:18:35,758 --> 01:18:37,217
- So yeah...
- So nice!

339
01:18:37,383 --> 01:18:41,050
It's never really too hot
like in Marrakech.

340
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:44,092
Yeah, it's true it's windier
than in Marrakech.

341
01:18:45,342 --> 01:18:48,842
That's so cool! You must have seen
some beautiful places!

342
01:18:49,008 --> 01:18:51,133
Yeah, I'm lucky.
I've been all over Europe.

343
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:54,258
And a bit of Africa too!

344
01:18:55,883 --> 01:18:57,717
Were you able to get around?

345
01:18:57,883 --> 01:19:01,550
- And have you seen all the countries?
- I didn't always have time to visit.

346
01:19:01,717 --> 01:19:06,967
A fortnight ago, in the same week,
I went to Milan, Mykonos, Essaouira...

347
01:19:07,925 --> 01:19:10,717
- and then we went back to Lanzarote.
- Not bad.

348
01:19:10,883 --> 01:19:14,092
- What? You don't want to do that?
- Yeah, tomorrow...

349
01:19:14,258 --> 01:19:16,800
- And we do it well...
- Yes, but my sister is right there!

350
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,925
- It's fine.
- What do you mean?

351
01:19:20,508 --> 01:19:23,217
Cassandre!
I already had sex with your sister.

352
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:27,383
You annoy me!

353
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:29,717
You talking like this
stresses out my dad.

354
01:19:29,883 --> 01:19:31,217
Come on, your dad loves me!

355
01:19:31,383 --> 01:19:34,758
He's my friend and she even knows it!

356
01:19:34,925 --> 01:19:38,842
- It's only right now.
- Stop putting on your show!

357
01:19:39,008 --> 01:19:41,383
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

358
01:19:41,967 --> 01:19:43,508
Don't worry about it...

359
01:19:44,508 --> 01:19:47,217
You're better behaved
when you're in front of Jean.

360
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:48,800
- He scares me!
- Really?

361
01:19:48,967 --> 01:19:51,050
- Yeah, he's so...
- But our dad is a softy!

362
01:19:51,217 --> 01:19:52,717
Really?

363
01:19:52,883 --> 01:19:54,967
- I don't know, he seems a bit strict!
- No!

364
01:19:55,467 --> 01:19:59,217
No, he can come off a bit...
He's actually quite shy.

365
01:19:59,383 --> 01:20:02,717
- We were never spanked!
- Yes, you were! You don't remember...

366
01:20:02,883 --> 01:20:04,758
I remember...

367
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:08,800
Even I've been spanked
by your father too!

368
01:20:08,967 --> 01:20:11,967
It should be called a dish:
"Jean's spankings".

369
01:20:12,842 --> 01:20:16,258
- Don't you want to settle down sometimes?
- Yeah, but every day is different,

370
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:19,175
I never get bored and I meet
different people all the time.

371
01:20:19,342 --> 01:20:22,175
In the same day, I can see snow and sun.
I'm rather lucky!

372
01:20:22,342 --> 01:20:24,258
So you're not attached to anyone?

373
01:20:25,675 --> 01:20:26,883
No, nobody.

374
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:29,175
- Really not?
- Nope.

375
01:20:29,342 --> 01:20:32,050
Why are you travelling
if you don't meet anyone?

376
01:20:32,217 --> 01:20:34,925
I meet people and I have flatmates
but I have to accept

377
01:20:35,092 --> 01:20:37,717
that I like them for two hours
and then it's goodbye.

378
01:20:37,883 --> 01:20:40,383
What's wrong with you?
You look like you have...

379
01:20:41,092 --> 01:20:44,258
- You can't talk about attachment!
- Ah, we're still on this!

380
01:20:44,425 --> 01:20:46,717
- Yes, we are!
- Yes, Cassandre!

381
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,425
Oh my God!

382
01:20:51,425 --> 01:20:55,217
I don't understand.
What is the definition of attachment?

383
01:20:56,008 --> 01:21:00,425
It's the moment when you're entitled
to make mistakes, come back, and argue.

384
01:21:00,592 --> 01:21:02,717
- If you meet someone for two hours...
- Yeah!

385
01:21:02,883 --> 01:21:05,967
I'm entitled to it all!
We don't even know who we are!

386
01:21:06,592 --> 01:21:07,800
Melissa?

387
01:21:07,967 --> 01:21:09,883
Melissa, do you have a cigarette?

388
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:11,675
I only have rolled cigarettes.

389
01:21:12,342 --> 01:21:16,217
- We only smoke rolled cigarettes here!
- Do you guys have a cigarette?

390
01:21:17,133 --> 01:21:20,925
- Vincent? Vincent?
- Does anyone have a cigarette?

391
01:21:22,092 --> 01:21:24,967
Don't you have a real cigarette?
An industrial one?

392
01:21:26,633 --> 01:21:28,842
I'll roll one up for you.

393
01:21:33,842 --> 01:21:36,050
Are you OK, sir?
Would you like some change?

394
01:21:38,342 --> 01:21:39,675
Sir!

395
01:21:43,425 --> 01:21:44,717
He's scared of you!

396
01:21:44,883 --> 01:21:46,925
Would you like some change, sir?

397
01:21:47,092 --> 01:21:49,092
- You are very scary.
- You're very scary!

398
01:21:49,258 --> 01:21:51,258
- We saw a shadow!
- Don't stand in the dark!

399
01:21:51,425 --> 01:21:53,925
- You said Alessandro and now it's Aless.
- But you...

400
01:21:54,092 --> 01:21:56,508
No, it's OK, it's OK!

401
01:21:56,925 --> 01:21:59,508
- Do you like him?
- Yeah. Do you like him too?

402
01:21:59,675 --> 01:22:01,550
- I do!
- Well that's that.

403
01:22:02,842 --> 01:22:04,883
He'll take us back.

404
01:22:18,925 --> 01:22:20,133
Slow down!

405
01:22:48,633 --> 01:22:51,050
What the hell!
She puked all over the seat!

406
01:22:52,925 --> 01:22:54,425
Give me her bag!

407
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:56,383
Damn it, Melissa! You piss me off!

408
01:22:57,633 --> 01:22:59,592
Every weekend
it's the same damn thing!

409
01:23:04,592 --> 01:23:06,383
Here's her bag!

410
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:08,300
You fucking asshole!

411
01:23:08,467 --> 01:23:09,800
Shut the fuck up!

412
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,300
Are you OK?

413
01:25:04,758 --> 01:25:06,300
Is this for trash?

414
01:25:06,467 --> 01:25:08,300
- That's for trash.
- Hold on.

415
01:25:09,592 --> 01:25:11,758
You can throw that away... 2010.

416
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:15,883
That's disgusting stuff!

417
01:25:17,217 --> 01:25:20,758
They were at your grandmother's
and we've been carrying them for years.

418
01:25:23,342 --> 01:25:25,383
- It was fashionable back then!
- But why?

419
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:28,425
- It was for decoration.
- Are we throwing it away?

420
01:25:29,383 --> 01:25:31,342
- No, I've always had it.
- You use it

421
01:25:31,508 --> 01:25:33,883
if you don't want to be seen
when you go next door.

422
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:40,383
That... that's not possible...

423
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:45,217
Another box of 2004 documents.

424
01:25:45,383 --> 01:25:48,592
2004 is to be thrown out.
We don't need anything before 2010.

425
01:25:48,758 --> 01:25:50,717
We have to keep these for ten years.

426
01:25:50,883 --> 01:25:53,092
- Why?
- It's the law.

427
01:25:54,008 --> 01:25:57,633
- We can throw that out too. It's 2002.
- OK, wow... Hold on.

428
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:06,467
I'll take it out later.
We're almost done.

429
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,425
- Account 2016, so it's thrown out.
- No, we're keeping it.

430
01:26:10,592 --> 01:26:12,008
Just kidding!

431
01:26:12,175 --> 01:26:14,467
OK, you're listening.
We forgot that!

432
01:26:15,217 --> 01:26:16,967
What do we do with this?

433
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:22,342
We'll put them in the cellar...

434
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,383
The basement.

435
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:28,258
Don't you want to throw them out?

436
01:26:29,467 --> 01:26:30,300
No.

437
01:26:30,467 --> 01:26:32,092
We'll put them in the basement.

438
01:27:13,050 --> 01:27:14,675
- Hey.
- How are you?

439
01:27:14,842 --> 01:27:16,175
Yes...

440
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:22,133
- Isn't Dad with you?
- No, he's eating with his lawyer.

441
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:23,592
What for?

442
01:27:27,092 --> 01:27:29,300
For yet another appeal.

443
01:27:33,717 --> 01:27:35,467
It will never fucking end!

444
01:27:35,633 --> 01:27:37,217
Is there anything new?

445
01:27:37,383 --> 01:27:40,925
Well... no. He's apparently still at it.

446
01:27:41,092 --> 01:27:42,758
I don't get why he does this.

447
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:53,592
Three appeals didn't work.

448
01:27:54,175 --> 01:27:56,133
His lawyer doesn't charge him anymore.

449
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:58,133
He invites him to the restaurant!

450
01:28:03,467 --> 01:28:05,800
Why doesn't he get a second appraisal?

451
01:28:07,258 --> 01:28:11,133
Because she was the one speeding,
even if it wasn't much. So...

452
01:28:11,717 --> 01:28:14,550
The speed limit is fifty
and she was doing fifty-seven.

453
01:28:16,883 --> 01:28:18,258
What were you thinking?

454
01:28:19,675 --> 01:28:22,008
That she was doing
between seventy to eighty.

455
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,508
Is it the same area all the way through
or is it...

456
01:34:03,675 --> 01:34:06,008
- Is it wider here?
- Yes, it's wider here.

457
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:13,925
We're thinking
of placing the kitchen here...

458
01:34:14,092 --> 01:34:17,717
What's very fashionable at the moment
are island kitchens...

459
01:34:17,883 --> 01:34:21,883
It's very welcoming, for drinks
and doing homework with the children...

460
01:34:25,008 --> 01:34:28,675
... a play area there
and the more parental area here...

461
01:34:30,175 --> 01:34:32,258
- I'll let you look around?
- OK.

462
01:35:01,008 --> 01:35:02,675
Can I have a sip of your beer?

463
01:35:10,925 --> 01:35:12,467
Who bought that gnome?

464
01:35:13,842 --> 01:35:15,092
You know who.

465
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,008
I forgot.

466
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,425
Your mother liked tall men
but she also liked garden gnomes.

467
01:35:32,008 --> 01:35:33,925
She was full of contradictions.

468
01:35:37,425 --> 01:35:39,925
Before you,
was she with someone tall or short?

469
01:35:40,633 --> 01:35:42,800
Before me, she wasn't with anyone.

470
01:35:42,967 --> 01:35:44,550
That's what you think!

471
01:35:45,675 --> 01:35:47,217
She had no one before you?

472
01:35:47,383 --> 01:35:49,425
I didn't say she didn't have anyone.

473
01:35:49,592 --> 01:35:51,175
I said she wasn't with anyone.

474
01:35:51,925 --> 01:35:53,217
But do you really know?

475
01:35:53,383 --> 01:35:55,258
- That she wasn't with anyone?
- Yeah.

476
01:35:55,967 --> 01:35:58,967
Getting the light on
used to be my favourite game.

477
01:36:00,217 --> 01:36:01,675
Sure, cheerleaders...

478
01:36:07,925 --> 01:36:09,383
Papa Beaver.

479
01:36:10,175 --> 01:36:12,758
Tell us a story, Papa Beaver.

480
01:36:16,217 --> 01:36:17,758
No really, don't you know?

481
01:36:19,342 --> 01:36:21,092
No. When I appeared...

482
01:36:21,925 --> 01:36:24,258
she was very young and so was I, and...

483
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:26,758
we met over there.

484
01:36:27,508 --> 01:36:30,008
- Not far from here.
- How did you pick her up?

485
01:36:31,883 --> 01:36:34,467
- Tell us all the details.
- No...

486
01:36:34,633 --> 01:36:37,217
- Please!
- No, that's our story.

487
01:36:37,383 --> 01:36:38,967
But it's ours too!

488
01:36:41,758 --> 01:36:43,550
What did you tell her? And how?

489
01:36:44,425 --> 01:36:47,383
To know the whole story, I think it's...

490
01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:50,717
I think she was hitting on me
but she always said the opposite.

491
01:36:51,175 --> 01:36:53,050
But I think she was pushing it a bit.

492
01:36:53,633 --> 01:36:54,883
Did she dance well?

493
01:36:55,842 --> 01:36:57,133
She danced very well.

494
01:36:58,342 --> 01:37:00,342
I liked that best,
among other things.

495
01:37:01,508 --> 01:37:03,592
- Can you imitate her?
- And she was always...

496
01:37:04,092 --> 01:37:05,467
No, I couldn't do that!

497
01:37:06,342 --> 01:37:07,800
So, how did you dance?

498
01:37:09,217 --> 01:37:11,800
Back in those days, it was minimal.

499
01:37:17,258 --> 01:37:18,842
Did you ask her to dance?

500
01:37:20,258 --> 01:37:23,467
We weren't at the ball, you know!

501
01:37:24,008 --> 01:37:26,758
There were rock stages and concerts.

502
01:37:26,925 --> 01:37:29,883
We weren't inviting each other.
We weren't at the ball.

503
01:37:30,508 --> 01:37:32,008
When was the first kiss?

504
01:37:33,508 --> 01:37:35,092
The first time we kissed?

505
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:38,633
Well, it was after a concert

506
01:37:39,383 --> 01:37:41,800
and we were pretty drunk...

507
01:37:44,717 --> 01:37:45,925
and...

508
01:37:46,717 --> 01:37:50,800
I think it helped me
overcome my shyness

509
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:52,842
and not to overthink it.

510
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:56,258
She seemed to agree.

511
01:37:56,425 --> 01:37:58,633
The proof is that
you arrived not long after.

512
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,383
So there was something.

513
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:01,967
For once I figured it out.

514
01:38:05,133 --> 01:38:07,550
- Were you there for both births?
- Of course.

515
01:38:11,592 --> 01:38:13,258
The first one was "whoa".

516
01:38:14,717 --> 01:38:16,550
- Why?
- Because it was...

517
01:38:17,383 --> 01:38:19,300
I was very young and so was she.

518
01:38:20,008 --> 01:38:21,300
We didn't know

519
01:38:21,467 --> 01:38:24,092
and then suddenly it was real.

520
01:38:25,092 --> 01:38:26,800
You were very small...

521
01:38:27,633 --> 01:38:30,342
like a real, small animal.

522
01:38:32,842 --> 01:38:34,383
Thirty centimetres long...

523
01:38:36,925 --> 01:38:38,967
I can't remember...

524
01:38:39,133 --> 01:38:41,050
I remember the weight
but not the size.

525
01:38:42,467 --> 01:38:43,717
It was 3.5 kg.

526
01:38:44,425 --> 01:38:46,425
I don't know the size.
I can't remember.

527
01:38:47,217 --> 01:38:50,383
But then it was real,
and we looked at each other like,

528
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,008
"That's it!"

529
01:38:53,342 --> 01:38:55,467
- What do you mean?
- That you were there.

530
01:38:55,633 --> 01:38:57,633
We switched to something else.

531
01:38:59,258 --> 01:39:01,675
Then everything went very quickly...

532
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,092
Everything changed.

533
01:39:04,967 --> 01:39:06,925
Your delivery too, it was...

534
01:39:07,425 --> 01:39:09,508
for other reasons, it was very strong.

535
01:39:13,092 --> 01:39:16,258
Your mother had a problem
at the last moment

536
01:39:16,425 --> 01:39:18,050
and you couldn't come out.

537
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:22,842
The epidural wasn't working.
So they decided to open...

538
01:39:23,342 --> 01:39:24,800
to do a caesarean...

539
01:39:27,967 --> 01:39:29,342
And so...

540
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:33,383
I had to take you and have skin contact,
you know?

541
01:39:35,008 --> 01:39:39,717
When the baby arrives,
they put it on the mother's breast...

542
01:39:41,175 --> 01:39:43,550
to warm the baby up...
but as she had a caesarean.

543
01:39:43,717 --> 01:39:45,925
I took you on me

544
01:39:46,092 --> 01:39:48,050
to warm you up, to calm you down,

545
01:39:48,217 --> 01:39:51,592
to comfort you, and you were
a little animal looking for the breast.

546
01:39:52,842 --> 01:39:54,342
Sorry, I didn't have any.

547
01:39:56,342 --> 01:39:58,550
It's a reflex the baby has
when it comes out.

548
01:39:58,717 --> 01:40:01,550
It's a survival thing.
It climbs up to reach the breast.

549
01:40:02,883 --> 01:40:04,133
A little animal.

550
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,008
So...

551
01:40:11,883 --> 01:40:14,217
When reported,
the vehicle was found embedded

552
01:40:14,383 --> 01:40:16,550
on the pile of rocks in the roundabout.

553
01:40:16,717 --> 01:40:19,300
The vehicle is on its side
at a 45 degree angle,

554
01:40:19,467 --> 01:40:22,050
approximately 7.5 metres from the road.

555
01:40:22,217 --> 01:40:26,300
The driver, Mrs Sabine Wessels,
fifty-three years old, is deceased.

556
01:40:30,508 --> 01:40:33,258
I'm sorry.
We can take a little break if you want.

557
01:40:34,133 --> 01:40:37,842
I'm obliged to read it.
It's the law in fact. I have no choice.

558
01:40:38,008 --> 01:40:40,092
- It's not pleasant for me either.
- Let's go on.

559
01:40:40,467 --> 01:40:44,508
The front end, passenger compartment
and the engine crashed into the rocks

560
01:40:44,675 --> 01:40:46,717
in the landscaping.

561
01:40:46,883 --> 01:40:48,717
The left fender was crushed,

562
01:40:48,883 --> 01:40:52,925
part of the vehicle was on fire,
and the right rear tyre was burst.

563
01:40:53,092 --> 01:40:55,967
A large amount of rubber residue
was found on the road surface

564
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:58,633
at an angle
of approximately 125 degrees,

565
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,050
suggesting that the vehicle had veered
violently onto the far-right lane.

566
01:41:03,508 --> 01:41:07,925
When reported, the roundabout
was partially covered with gravel.

567
01:41:08,092 --> 01:41:12,800
This may be due to a construction site
on the road leading to Floreffe.

568
01:41:12,967 --> 01:41:16,592
Yet, we cannot certify that this was
the direct cause of the tyre blow-out

569
01:41:16,758 --> 01:41:19,550
that caused the vehicle
to deviate from its course.

570
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:23,383
After that, there are still
two or three Volkswagen

571
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:24,967
and then it's Peugeots.

572
01:41:26,925 --> 01:41:29,383
Because those are all Fiats.

573
01:41:30,508 --> 01:41:33,217
But it's not possible...

574
01:42:34,092 --> 01:42:35,258
Here it is.

575
01:42:35,842 --> 01:42:39,592
This is the document for the court
to say that the vehicle was not present.

576
01:42:40,425 --> 01:42:42,633
So the assessment could not take place.

577
01:42:43,383 --> 01:42:45,508
This will be the other copy for me...

578
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:49,300
Forward...

579
01:42:49,425 --> 01:42:53,217
How long will it take for the court
to process a...

580
01:42:53,383 --> 01:42:55,633
to set a new date
for a new expert opinion?

581
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,550
Well...

582
01:42:59,008 --> 01:43:02,717
If there's no vehicle, I won't be able
to carry out the assessment.

583
01:43:02,883 --> 01:43:05,383
- Well, that's...
- Not you, but...

584
01:43:06,342 --> 01:43:10,258
I don't know... that there is a new file
and a new assessment?

585
01:43:10,425 --> 01:43:14,133
Then we'll have to close the case
and slowly move on to compensation...

586
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:16,467
especially if there is no more vehicle.

587
01:43:43,842 --> 01:43:46,508
I don't even know how to drink that.
I forgot.

588
01:43:46,675 --> 01:43:49,133
- What is it, a shot?
- No.

589
01:43:49,550 --> 01:43:52,758
Not everything is a shot, Cassandre.

590
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,842
It smells like solvent.

591
01:43:57,717 --> 01:44:00,342
I'm sure when you drink shots,
you get a little tear.

592
01:44:00,925 --> 01:44:03,508
Isn't that true?
You have the little...

593
01:44:07,175 --> 01:44:09,175
I'm drinking it for you, Dad.

594
01:44:17,883 --> 01:44:19,217
You've got fags?

595
01:44:19,383 --> 01:44:20,883
- Do you want a fag?
- Yes.

596
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:22,758
- A fag.
- I haven't got one on me.

597
01:44:22,925 --> 01:44:24,842
- Do you have any?
- For you?

598
01:44:25,508 --> 01:44:26,508
Well, what?

599
01:44:27,508 --> 01:44:29,008
In my bag in the hall.

600
01:45:33,175 --> 01:45:34,925
You shouldn't blame yourself.

601
01:45:38,717 --> 01:45:41,383
- Not even a little?
- No.

602
01:45:44,592 --> 01:45:47,758
I was angry with you when you left
and didn't warn us in advance.

603
01:45:49,258 --> 01:45:51,050
Actually, I didn't know what to say.

604
01:45:52,508 --> 01:45:55,383
I didn't know
if I was going to come home or not.

605
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:57,050
I didn't know what to say.

606
01:46:11,008 --> 01:46:12,175
I'm sorry.

607
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,000
