YOU COULDN'T.

63
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:39,633

00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:47,600
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?

68
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,500

IT SMELLS LIKE A BARBECUE
IN HERE.

- IT'S DINNER.

78
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,033
PASS IT OVER.

00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,133
YOU WANT SOME?

80
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,300
- ALL RIGHT.

81
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,067
I MIGHT JUST STEAL SOME VEGGIES.

82
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,900
SO, UH...

83
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,867
IS THIS A BUSINESS TRIP?

84
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:52,033
- YEAH.

85
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,433
- WHAT SORT OF WORK DO YOU DO?

86
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:57,233
- PEST CONTROL.

87
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,767
- OH.

88
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,567
I USUALLY JUST
SWEEP BUGS OUTSIDE,

89
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,100
EXCEPT FOR HUNTSMAN SPIDERS.

90
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,133
- CAN YOU PASS ME A NAPKIN
FROM IN THE GLOVE BOX?

91
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:19,733
- WHO'S THIS?

92
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,867
- MY DAUGHTER.

93
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,467
- WHAT'S HER NAME?

94
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:30,533
- JESSE.

95
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,567
- DOES SHE LIVE WITH YOU?

96
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:37,200
- YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A SEAT.

97
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:58,167
SHE WAS FOUND LYING ON HER BACK,

98
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,567
WHICH MEANS WHEN SHE VOMITED,

99
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:03,400
THE AIRWAYS BECAME BLOCKED,
CAUSING SUFFOCATION.

100
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,500
THE TOXICOLOGY REPORT FOUND
ALCOHOL, COCAINE,

101

00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:15,267
WE ALSO FOUND TRACES OF SEMEN.

103
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,800
- WHERE DID THEY FIND HER?

104
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,467
- THATCHER'S LANE.

105
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:31,033
EMERGENCY SERVICES RECEIVED AN
ANONYMOUS CALL FROM A PAY PHONE.

106
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,033
- SOMEONE WAS WITH HER.

107
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,733
- IT APPEARS SO.

108
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,233
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, BEING
AN INDUSTRIAL AREA ON A SUNDAY,

109
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:49,367
WE'RE FINDING IT VERY DIFFICULT
TO GET A WITNESS.

110
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,467

MOST OF OUR BUSINESS

00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,233
THROUGH THE MAIL OR BY PHONE,

119
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,667

WHEN I FIND A GOOD MOVIE,
I TAKE IT TO THE STORES.

130
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:07,667
- OKAY.

131

YOU'RE LOOKING AT $2,656.50.

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,300
- YOU TAKE CREDIT?

138
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,367
- SURE DO.

139
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:30,867
WHERE DO YOU WANT 'EM
DELIVERED?

140
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,833
- I'LL GRAB 'EM NOW,
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

141
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:35,067

WHO MADE THIS?

145
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:51,767

146
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:53,767
FINN AND I GO WAY BACK.

147
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:54,800
THERE'S YOUR ORDER SLIP.

148
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,200
JUST SHOW IT TO MICK
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

149
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:01,933
- SO FINN,
HE'S THE PRODUCER?

150
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:03,033
- WELL, I GUESS
YOU'D CALL HIM THAT.

151
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:06,033
SPENDS MOST OF HIS TIME
DOING FIGHT PROMOTIONS.

152
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:07,933
ACTUALLY, THIS VIDEO WAS SHOT
AT ONE OF HIS GYMS.

153
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,033
- REALLY?

154
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,300
WERE YOU THERE
WHEN THEY SHOT IT?

155
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:15,400
- YOU OFTEN ADVISE PEOPLE
ON THOSE SHOOTS.

156
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,267
IMAGINE BEING SO CLOSE,
YOU CAN SMELL IT.

157
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:20,100
[laughs]

158
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,633
- I WANT TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH FINN, YOU KNOW,

159
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,633
SEE WHAT ELSE HE'S GOT.

160
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:26,767
- YEAH, I COULD ORGANIZE THAT.

161
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:29,200
IT'LL ALL BE
IN OUR BACK CATALOGS.

162
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,233
- WELL, I'M ALSO INTERESTED
IN COMMISSIONING SOME WORK.

163
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:36,067
- YEAH, HE'S TALENTED,
AIN'T HE, OLD FINN?

164
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,300
LET ME GRAB
YOUR POSTAL ADDRESS

165
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,467
SO I CAN PUT YOU
ON OUR MAILING LIST.

166
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,533
- NO, I'D REALLY LIKE
TO CONTACT HIM.

167
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:44,067
I GOT SOME GREAT IDEAS.

168
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:45,833
- DON'T WE ALL, MATE?

169
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,800
I JUST CAN'T GIVE OUT
HIS DETAILS.

170
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,867
LET ME GIVE HIM A CALL.

171
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:50,000
HE CAN CONTACT YOU.

172
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,033
- WRITE DOWN THE ADDRESS.

173
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,100
GIVE ME THE ADDRESS.

174
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:29,500
I WANT HIS HOME ADDRESS,
NOT A P.O. BOX.

175
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,900
- I DON'T HAVE IT.

176
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,133
- THEN TELL ME
WHERE HIS GYM IS.

177
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:51,867
WHO ELSE FUCKED HER?

178
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:53,400
- WHAT?

179
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:57,000
- IN THE VIDEO,

180
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,267
THERE'S THREE OF THEM,

181
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:00,033
BUT THE COPS TELL ME
THERE WERE FOUR INVOLVED.

182
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,200
- THE COPS?

183
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,767
WHAT HAVE YOU TOLD 'EM?

184
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,200
- WHO WAS IT?

185
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,500
YOU?

186
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,967
THIS FINN?

187
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,267
SOMEONE ELSE?

188
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,500
- I WOULDN'T HAVE A CLUE.

189
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:19,867
- DID SHE SMELL GOOD?

190
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,400
- WHAT?

191
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:28,633
- DID SHE SMELL GOOD?

192
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:34,867
- [gasps]

193
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,100
[crashing sound]

194
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:45,167
- THERE'S A POT DOWN THERE.

195
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,600
- IT'S AN URN.

196
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,867
- REALLY?

197
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,500
- YEAH.

198
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,200
MY DAUGHTER'S IN THERE--

199
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,433
HALF OF HER, ANYWAY.

200
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,233
MY WIFE HAS THE REST OF HER.

201
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,533
- HOW DID SHE...

202
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:14,067
- HEROIN.

203
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,533
- THAT'S AWFUL.

204
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:20,467
ARE YOU GONNA
SCATTER HER SOMEWHERE?

205
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,000
- I DON'T KNOW YET.

206
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,767
- YEAH, RIGHT.

207
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:02,700
- [speaking indistinctly]

208
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,700
- YEAH.

209
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,700
- ALL RIGHT, FINN.

210
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,033
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE CARE, MAN.

211
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:28,033
- I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
ABOUT JESSICA FORTESKY,

212
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,300
THE GIRL IN THE VIDEO.

213
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:33,433
HOW DID SHE GET INVOLVED?

214
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:34,933
- I TOLD YOU,
SHE CAME TO ME.

215
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:36,600
SHE JUST WANTED TO MAKE
SOME EXTRA DOSH.

216
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,000
- HOW MUCH WAS SHE WORTH?

217
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,367
- WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER?

218
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:46,333
- BECAUSE SHE'S DEAD.

219
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:49,300
- HOW?

220
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,333
- HEROIN, BUT YOU ALREADY
KNOW THAT!

221
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:53,500
- FUCK OFF!

222
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,167
I'VE BEEN IN THIS FUCKING
BUSINESS FOR 20 YEARS!

223
00:24:56,267 --> 00:24:59,933
YOU THINK I'D STILL BE AROUND
IF I DRUGGED MY ACTORS, EH?

224
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:00,933
LOOK AT HER,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES!

225
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,033
YOU THINK I WANTED HER
LIKE THAT?

226
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:05,333
- THEN WHY DID YOU SHOOT HER?

227
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:09,333
- BECAUSE IT'S
FUCKING EXPENSIVE, YEAH?

228
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:10,867
LOOK, NO ONE HAD
A PROBLEM WITH IT.

229
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:14,100
- SOMEONE CALLED AN AMBULANCE
FOR HER

230
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,500
AND LEFT HER
IN A FUCKING ALLEYWAY TO DIE!

231
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,500
- AND YOU FUCKING THINK
IT WAS ONE OF US, EH?

232
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,467
YOU THINK WE FUCKIN'
WERE ALL INVOLVED IN IT, EH?

233
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:24,967
TELL YOU WHAT, MATE.

234
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,100
SHE CAME HERE STONED
OFF HER FUCKING TITS, YEAH?

235
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,867
SHE DID WHAT SHE HAD TO DO,
YOU HEAR?

236
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:31,167
ALL THAT ROOTIN', YEAH?

237
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:35,433
COLLECTED HER MONEY
AND BUGGERED OFF ALL BY HERSELF.

238
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:41,133
YOU THINK WE FUCKIN'
HAD ANYTHING TO HIDE, EH?

239
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:43,900
DO YOU THINK
IF WE HAD ANYTHING TO HIDE,

240
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,833
WE'D BE MAKING FUCKIN' HUNDREDS
OF VIDEOS,

241
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:47,867
SENDING IT AROUND THE WORLD?

242
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:49,433
DO YOU THINK SO, EH?

243
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:53,367
YOU THINK I'M GONNA DO THAT
IF WE FUCKIN' BUMPED HER OFF?

244
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:57,400
FUCKIN' HELL.

245
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,133
LOOK.

246
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:01,167
JUST LET ME OUT OF THIS.

247
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:02,200
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

248
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,167
I KNOW.
YOU'RE FEELING CRANKY.

249
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:13,667
YOU'RE HER DAD, I KNOW,
OR WHAT ARE YOU?

250
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:15,300
FUCKIN' UNCLE, WHATEVER.

251
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,967
LOOK, MY KIDS
WERE JUST THE SAME.

252
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:21,567
THEY JUST WOULDN'T HAVE
THE BOTHER OF IT EITHER.

253
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:28,033
- I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES

254
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:30,300
OF EVERYONE INVOLVED,
STARTING WITH THE ACTORS.

255
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,733
- LOOK, MATE, YOU AIN'T GONNA
GET ANYWHERE WITH THIS BULLSHIT.

256
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:37,033
FORGET ABOUT IT, EH?

257
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:39,400
LOOK, NO ONE DID ANYTHING WRONG.

258
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,600
[grunts]

259
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,433
STAY FUCKING STILL.

260
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:54,467
- [groaning]

261
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:07,733
- STAY FUCKING STILL.

262
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:24,133
- [muffled shouting]

263
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,733
YOU LIKE FOOTBALL?

264
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:03,200
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

265
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:14,100
- [muffled scream]

266
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,033
CHRIST!
YOU FUCKIN' BASTARD!

267
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:19,233
YOU'RE GONNA DIE FOR THIS!

268
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,467
- YOU WANT MORE?
YOU WANT MORE?

269
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:23,333
- ALL RIGHT!

270
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:25,567
JIMMY, HE COME FROM UP NORTH
IN GLADSTONE.

271
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,600
- YES, I KNOW.

272
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:32,733
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ONES?

273
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:36,433
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

274
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:40,433
FUCKIN' PAUL, HE SAID HE DRIVED
DOWN FROM MACKAY OR SOMETHING.

275
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:41,500
LOOK, IN MY PHONE.

276
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,467
IT'S IN THE FUCKING--
ON MY PANTS THERE.

277
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:44,333
JUST LOOK IN THERE.

278
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:45,767
ALL THE PHONE NUMBERS
ARE IN THERE.

279
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:48,667
GO ON, HAVE A LOOK.

280
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,000
IT'S UNDER PAUL LYNCHIP.

281
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,033
YOU GONNA FUCK OFF NOW?

282
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:02,067
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.

283
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:02,867
- I WANT THE OTHER ONE.

284
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:05,167
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ONE?

285
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:06,267
- I DON'T FUCKIN' KNOW.

286
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:07,600
I NEVER DEALT WITH HIM.

287
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,800
HE'S JIM'S BROTHER.

288
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,633
HE'S HIS LITTLE BROTHER
OR SOMETHING.

289
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:14,400
YOU WANT HIM, JUST GO
AND FUCKIN' ASK JIM, ALL RIGHT?

290
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,433
- AND WHAT ABOUT THE TAPES
YOU SHOT ON?

291
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:20,433
- ALL RIGHT,
A BLOKE CALLED WALTERS, RIGHT?

292
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:21,500
HE LIVES IN IPSWICH;
HIS NUMBER'S IN THERE TOO.

293
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,267
NOW FUCK OFF!

294
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:24,300
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

295
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,667
THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH, YEAH.

296
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:27,600
YOU'RE WELCOME.
FUCK OFF.

297
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,900
- NO, NO, NO.

298
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,633
NOW I WANT TO KNOW
WHO ELSE DID HER.

299
00:29:38,867 --> 00:29:40,667
- KILL THIS PIECE
OF FUCKING SHIT!

300
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,133
[both grunting]

301
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:15,033
- HEY, FINN.

302
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:16,033
YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?

303
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:17,200
- OH, YEAH, JUST FUCKIN' PEACHY.

304
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,300
I JUST GOT A BIKE PUMP
STUCK IN ME DICK!

305
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,367
NOW, BRING THAT FUCKIN' CUNT
IN HERE!

306
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:53,600
- YOU LIKE THAT?

307
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,200
HUH?

308
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:07,000
[dull thud]

309
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,400
- OH, SHIT.

310
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,467
OH, SHIT.

311
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:28,967
- I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE
IF I START SNORING.

312
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:30,100
- WHATEVER.

313
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,233
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T
SLEEP NAKED.

314
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:39,533
- MIND IF I PUT THE TELLY
ON LIVE FOR A WHILE?

315
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:42,033
HELPS ME SLEEP.

316
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:44,067
- YEAH, THAT'S COOL.

317
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:46,433
I DO THAT AT HOME.

318
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,267
- DEVELOPMENTS IN
A FATAL HOUSE FIRE TODAY

319
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:56,033
AS INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE
ARSON IS TO BLAME.

320
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:58,233
THE REVELATION CAME
AS AUTHORITIES UNCOVERED

321
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:02,533
A PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEO OPERATION
INSIDE THE RESIDENCE.

322
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:04,167
THE ENTERPRISE WAS LINKED
WITH TWO OTHER BUSINESSES

323
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:07,033
WHERE THREE MEN WERE MURDERED
EARLIER THIS WEEK.

324
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:09,533
- THE NEWS IS TOO DEPRESSING.

325
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:33,200
NOTHING ON?

326
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:36,700
- NOT REALLY.

327
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,233
I SAW YOUR ARM.

328
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,067
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

329
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,667
- I DON'T ANYMORE.

330
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:06,133
WHY DO YOU?

331
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:11,533
- I DON'T KNOW.

332
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:16,900
MOST OF THE TIME,
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A DAZE.

333
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,200
HELPS ME FEEL SOMETHING.

334
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,000
I'M GONNA HAVE A SHOWER.

335
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:26,467
OH, BEFORE I FORGET,

336
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,967
I MIGHT HAVE TO VISIT
A CLIENT TOMORROW.

337
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,000
HE LIVES NEARBY;
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

338
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,533
- THAT'S OKAY.

339
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:36,033
I'LL JUST SLEEP IN.

340
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:49,067
- AFTER WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE,
I HAD A LOOK AROUND.

341
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:51,400
IF THERE'S ANYWHERE
THEY'RE GONNA BE,

342
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,267
THEY'LL BE IN THESE
OLD KENNELS HERE, I RECKON.

343
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:54,800
- THAT'S GOOD THINKING.

344
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,433
- I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TEAR THE
FUCKING THINGS DOWN FOR YEARS.

345
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:20,600
- OH, YEAH.

346
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,600
HERE, TAKE A LOOK.

347
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,133
- REALLY?

348
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:07,333
- JIM?

349
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,167
JIM?

350
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,233
- OH, FUCK.

351
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,167
[groans]

352
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,800
- YOU WERE RECENTLY IN
A PORN SHOOT WITH MY DAUGHTER.

353
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,467
I WANT TO KNOW
WHO SHE LEFT WITH.

354
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,100
- YOU'RE A FUCKIN' DEAD MAN!

355
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:01,200
- WHO DID SHE LEAVE WITH?

356
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,200
- I DON'T KNOW.

357
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,600
SHE WAS STILL THERE
WHEN I LEFT.

358
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,733
[groans]

359
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:16,433
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW.

360
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:19,500
[screams]

361
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:24,067
- WHO ELSE WAS AT THE SHOOT?

362
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,933
- A PRODUCER, FINN.

363
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:32,033
SOME CAMERAMAN.

364
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:34,833
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME.

365
00:38:34,933 --> 00:38:37,433
AND THE GUY
THAT OWNED THE WAREHOUSE.

366
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:41,600
- WHICH ONE OF THEM FUCKED HER?

367
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:45,700
- I DON'T KNOW.

368
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,233
PROBABLY FINN.

369
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,733
[groans]

370
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:00,133
- WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?

371
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:07,767
- YOU THINK I'M GONNA
TELL YOU THAT?

372
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:09,000
- YES, I DO, ACTUALLY.

373
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,700
- LISTEN, LISTEN.

374
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,067
YOUR DAUGHTER CAME TO THE SHOOT
BY HERSELF, MATE.

375
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:18,300
NO ONE FORCED HER
TO DO NOTHING.

376
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,933
- NO ONE FORCED HER
TO DO NOTHING.

377
00:39:22,033 --> 00:39:24,567
NO ONE FUCKING FORCED HER
TO DO NOTHING!

378
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:29,167
YOU RAPED HER!

379
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:30,933
WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU AFRAID?

380
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:34,200
COME ON, THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.

381
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,133
HMM?

382
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:36,733
NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

383
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:40,500
IT'S JUST A LITTLE CUT.

384
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,567
LOOK.

385
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:46,133
TINY LITTLE CUT!

386
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,300
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

387
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,367
WHICH ONE?

388
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:55,433
LEFT OR RIGHT?

389
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:56,400
- FUCK YOU!

390
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,233
- TELL ME WHERE
TO FIND YOUR BROTHER!

391
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,033
SPEAK!

392
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:02,700
- HE LIVES DOWN THE ROAD.

393
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,533
- SHUT YOUR FUCKING HOLE, IRENE!

394
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:17,767
- CHANTAM ROAD, NUMBER 64.

395
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:19,133
HE'S COMING OVER HERE SOON.

396
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:37,000
YOU'RE MR. FORTESKY,
AREN'T YOU?

397
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,133
- WHO ARE YOU?

398
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:41,633
- IRENE, HIS WIFE.

399
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:46,267
- YOU SENT THE VIDEO.

400
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:48,367
- YEAH.

401
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:50,533
- WHY?

402
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:51,600
WHAT'D YOU THINK I'D DO?

403
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,233
- I DON'T KNOW.

404
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:56,600
I WAS HOPING
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

405
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:13,533
THAT VIDEO TURNED UP
IN THE POST ONE DAY.

406
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:18,467
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS,
SO I SAT DOWN AND WATCHED IT.

407
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:22,067
THEN I SAW HER FACE
IN THE PAPER.

408
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:27,000
THEY'RE PIGS,
HIM AND HIS FUCKING BROTHER.

409
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,800
- YOU BETTER GO.

410
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,167
COME BACK LATER
AND CALL THE POLICE.

411
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:11,233
THIS OKAY?

412
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,200
- FINE.

413
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:25,833
[both grunting]

414
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:27,533
GET HIM!

415
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:38,200
- [screaming]

416
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,167
- GET HIM!

417
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:53,300
- FUCK!

418
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:55,333
[tearing sound]

419
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:57,400
- [screams]

420
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,300
- [growls]

421
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,867
- OH, NO!

422
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:18,433
EDDY.

423
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:21,400
[sobbing]

424
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,100
EDDY!

425
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,533
EDDY!

426
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,633
EDDY!

427
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:36,500
[sobbing]

428
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:55,100
- HE'LL BE HERE
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

429
00:46:03,133 --> 00:46:04,067
HAVE YOU GOT A LIGHT?

430
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:42,867
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN I STARTED SMOKING,

431
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,367
I WAS THE COOLEST
SON OF A BITCH IN SCHOOL.

432
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:52,267
NOT TILL 20 YEARS LATER
YOU THINK ABOUT QUITTING.

433
00:46:52,367 --> 00:46:54,767
BY THEN YOUR TEETH ARE YELLOW,
YOU SMELL LIKE SHIT,

434
00:46:54,867 --> 00:46:57,200
AND THEY GOT YOU BY THE BALLS.

435
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:18,633
SO HOW LONG YOU PLANNING
TO STAY UP HERE?

436
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:22,500
- DON'T KNOW.

437
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,167
- JUST PROMISE ME
NEXT TIME I COME THROUGH,

438
00:47:24,267 --> 00:47:27,233
I DON'T SEE YOU WORKING HERE
WITH EIGHT KIDS.

439
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:32,200
- I'M NOT PLANNING
ON HAVING KIDS FOR A LONG TIME.

440
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:36,567
- I REMEMBER THINKING THAT.

441
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:37,767
THEN ONE DAY,
ME GIRLFRIEND GIVES ME A CALL,

442
00:47:37,867 --> 00:47:40,600
TELLS ME SHE'S PREGNANT.

443
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,633
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

444
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:44,700
- I MARRIED HER.

445
00:47:47,733 --> 00:47:51,067
- IT MUST SUCK FOR GUYS.

446
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:52,033
- JEEZ, I HAVEN'T HEARD
THAT BEFORE

447
00:47:52,133 --> 00:47:56,133
FROM A MEMBER
OF THE FEMALE RACE.

448
00:47:56,233 --> 00:47:57,967
- WELL, YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

449
00:47:58,067 --> 00:48:00,667
IF SHE WANTS IT,
SHE'S HAVING IT.

450
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,100
[engine revving]

451
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,167
WELL, THAT'S HIM.

452
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,500
WELL, IT'S BEEN NICE
MEETING YOU.

453
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:21,300
- YOU TOO.

454
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,533
- I HOPE EVERYTHING WORKS OUT.

455
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:34,667
- ALICE.

456
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,467
IT'S GOT MY MOBILE ON IT,

457
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:46,000
JUST IN CASE.

458
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,267
- THANKS, CHRISTIAN.

459
00:50:01,233 --> 00:50:04,167
[speaking indistinctly]

460
00:50:13,433 --> 00:50:14,900
- SAY "BYE-BYE."

461
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,867
BYE-BYE.

462
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:18,133
[engine turns over]

463
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,133
[coughs]

464
00:50:28,467 --> 00:50:30,767
I DON'T KNOW.
IT COULD'VE BEEN ANY OF THEM.

465
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:33,467
I DIDN'T HANG AROUND;
I JUST LEFT.

466
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:35,233
- OH, YOU LEFT TOO?

467
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:36,533
- YEAH.

468
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:39,800
YEAH, YOU CAN EVEN SEE ME
WALK OUT IN THE VIDEO.

469
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,833
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
I'LL PUT IT ON.

470
00:50:41,933 --> 00:50:42,967
I'LL SHOW YOU.

471
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:45,333
- AND WHAT MADE YOU
SUDDENLY LEAVE?

472
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:48,100
- WHAT?

473
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,500
I WENT THERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT'D BE A BIT OF FUN.

474
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,667
AND THEN WHEN I SAW OTHERWISE,
I LEFT.

475
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:56,267
- AND WHAT DID YOU SEE?

476
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,333
- IT WAS JUST THE WAY THAT FINN
KEPT DIRECTING US.

477
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:00,967
HE KEPT SAYING,
"BE ROUGHER ON HER.

478
00:51:01,067 --> 00:51:03,633
KEEP EVERYONE AT ONCE
GOING ON HER."

479
00:51:03,733 --> 00:51:04,633
THE OTHER GUYS LOVED IT,

480
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:07,800
BUT I JUST WALKED OUT.

481
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,600
- YOU LEFT HER WITH THEM.

482
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,900
- NO.

483
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,100
NO, NO, NO,
I HAD WORDS WITH FINN.

484
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,867
I TOLD HIM THAT IT WASN'T RIGHT.

485
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:17,833
- AND WHAT DID HE SAY?

486
00:51:17,933 --> 00:51:20,400
- HE SAID,
"THAT'S WHY SHE'S GETTING PAID."

487
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,767
[coughs]

488
00:51:34,867 --> 00:51:38,033
- DID YOU TALK TO HER AT ALL?

489
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,467
- A LITTLE.

490
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:46,433
- DID SHE SAY WHY?

491
00:51:46,533 --> 00:51:48,467
- WHY WHAT?

492
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:49,633
- WHY SHE WAS THERE.

493
00:51:51,433 --> 00:51:53,767
- NO.

494
00:51:53,867 --> 00:51:57,200
NO, IT WAS A QUICK INTRODUCTION.

495
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,000
THERE WERE DRINKS GOING AROUND.

496
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,300
FINN WAS BRINGING AROUND
LINES OF COKE.

497
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,000
EVERYONE WAS GETTING FUCKED UP.

498
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,300
- AND SHE HAD SOME.

499
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,767
- YEAH,
FINN WAS ENCOURAGING HER.

500
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:15,367
- WHY?

501
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,967
- I THINK SHE HAD HER DOUBTS.

502
00:52:19,067 --> 00:52:22,000
SOMETHING ABOUT IT
NOT BEING ABOUT--

503
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,433
- HANG ON, HANG ON.

504
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,200
WAS SHE STONED
WHEN SHE GOT THERE?

505
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:32,500
- NO, NOT THAT I COULD TELL.

506
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,067
I DON'T KNOW.

507
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:36,067
- THEN WHEN DID SHE TAKE
THE HEROIN?

508
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:40,000
- HEROIN?

509
00:52:42,267 --> 00:52:45,633
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
WHEN SHE DISAPPEARED WITH DEREK.

510
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:46,733
- WHO THE FUCK IS DEREK?

511
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:49,300
- HE--HE WORKS WITH FINN.

512
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,633
- AND SHE WENT SOMEWHERE
WITH HIM.

513
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:53,367
- YEAH, SHE--SHE LOOKED LIKE
SHE WAS GONNA WALK OFF,

514
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:57,200
SO HE--SO HE TOOK HER IN A ROOM,
AND THEN, I DON'T KNOW.

515
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,600
THEY WERE IN THERE FOR A WHILE.

516
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,800
WHEN SHE CAME OUT, SHE--
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

517
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,333
SHE LOOKED ALL OVER THE PLACE.

518
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,467
- DO YOU THINK HE MIGHT HAVE...

519
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:10,200
FORCED HIMSELF?

520
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,467
- I DON'T KNOW.

521
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:15,500
YEAH, MAYBE.

522
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,200
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.

523
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,667
THEY WERE IN THERE LONG ENOUGH.

524
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:21,567
- AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

525
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:24,933
- THEN--

526
00:53:25,033 --> 00:53:27,900
THEN FINN SAW--
THEN FINN SAW HER,

527
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,367
AND THEN HE HAD WORDS
WITH DEREK.

528
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:33,367
HE SAID--HE SAID HE DIDN'T
WANT HER LOOKING ALL DRUNK

529
00:53:33,467 --> 00:53:35,867
AND WE HAD TO SHOOT STRAIGHTAWAY
BEFORE SHE PASSED OUT.

530
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:37,500
- FUCK! STOP!

531
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,733
WHERE THE FUCK
CAN I FIND THIS DEREK?

532
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:42,000
- I DON'T KNOW HIM.

533
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,733
- YOU DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW!

534
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:45,733
YOU DON'T KNOW.

535
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:47,000
YOU SURE YOU DON'T KNOW?

536
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,033
- I DON'T KNOW HIM.

537
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:49,733
- YOU DON'T KNOW,
ALL RIGHT.

538
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:50,800
- PLEASE, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

539
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,200
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I DON'T KNOW HIM.

540
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,133
TALK TO FINN.
TALK TO FINN.

541
00:53:54,233 --> 00:53:55,567
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT KNOWS DEREK.

542
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,400
- FINN'S DEAD.

543
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,600
- WELL, THEN--
THEN TALK TO THE BROTHERS.

544
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,333
THEY KNEW HIM.

545
00:54:02,433 --> 00:54:03,800
- YEAH, WELL, THEY'RE DEAD TOO.

546
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:04,900
- WAIT, PLEASE!

547
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,367
DO YOU THINK
I WANT TO PROTECT HIM?

548
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:07,167
I DON'T.

549
00:54:07,267 --> 00:54:07,933
I JUST WANT TO HELP YOU.

554
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,100
- LIKE WHAT?

555
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,867
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
FIGHT THEM ALL?

556
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:33,000
SHE WAS THERE
BECAUSE SHE CHOSE TO BE.

557
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,700
- SHE FUCKIN' CHOSE TO BE?

558
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:41,833
SHE HAD NO CHOICE!

559
00:54:41,933 --> 00:54:43,367
NO CHOICE!

560
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:47,633
GET UP!

YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

565
00:54:53,233 --> 00:54:55,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

566
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:55,800
YOU COULD JUST WALK WAY.

567
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:00,167
YOU COULD JUST WALK AWAY.

568
00:55:00,267 --> 00:55:02,333
YOU KEEP THE VIDEOTAPE.

569
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:04,267
YOU CAN BLACKMAIL ME
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

570
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,967
I WON'T GO TO THE POLICE,
I PROMISE.

571
00:55:06,067 --> 00:55:07,700
PLEASE.

572
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,367
I HAVE A FAMILY.

573
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:11,833
I HAVE A FAMILY.

574
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,867
PLEASE, PLEASE.

575
00:55:14,967 --> 00:55:17,900
I HAVE A LITTLE DAUGHTER.

PLEASE?

577
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:35,567
- SO DID I.

578
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:52,533
SHE'S DEAD.

579
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,667
- I KNOW.

580
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,133
- NO, YOU DON'T.

581
00:56:12,433 --> 00:56:15,667
SHE'S DEAD.

582
00:56:20,067 --> 00:56:23,033
SHE'S NOT UP THERE
DANCING AROUND.

583
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:27,267
SHE'S A PILE OF DUST.

584
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:29,400
I CAN HOLD HER IN ONE HAND.

585
00:56:34,367 --> 00:56:36,700
STILL, IT'S BETTER
THAN BURYING HER.

586
00:56:41,767 --> 00:56:44,500
I COULDN'T BEAR THE THOUGHT
OF HER TINY LITTLE BODY

587
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,467
ROTTING IN THE GROUND.

588
00:58:30,567 --> 00:58:34,333
[cell phone ringing]

589
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:42,900
HELLO?

590
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,900
- HI, CHRISTIAN.

591
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,700
IT'S ALICE.

592
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,133
- ALICE.

593
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:50,067
- UM, ARE YOU DRIVING BACK
TO BRISBANE ANY TIME SOON?

594
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,300
YEAH, I'M--I'M HEADING BACK
RIGHT NOW.

595
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,633
- HAVE YOU GONE PAST HERE YET?

596
00:58:53,733 --> 00:58:57,067
- NO, I'LL BE PASSING THROUGH
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

597
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:58,367
- DO YOU THINK
I COULD CATCH A LIFT?

598
00:58:58,467 --> 00:58:59,833
- OF COURSE THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

599
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:01,833
- I'M JUST
AT THE PETROL STATION.

600
00:59:01,933 --> 00:59:03,167
- OKAY.

601
00:59:03,267 --> 00:59:04,733
WELL, WAIT FOR ME THERE.

602
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,767
- OKAY, THANKS.

603
00:59:32,733 --> 00:59:34,367
- HI.

604
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:36,433
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

605
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:41,433
- YEAH.

606
00:59:52,133 --> 00:59:53,733
- YOU'RE PREGNANT, AREN'T YOU?

607
00:59:56,433 --> 01:00:01,000
- TEN WEEKS.

608
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,333
- WHEN'D YOU FIND OUT?

609
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,200
- MONDAY.

610
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,167
- THIS GUY IN TOWN,
HE'S THE FATHER?

611
01:00:16,667 --> 01:00:19,133
- I WANT TO GET IT SORTED,

612
01:00:19,233 --> 01:00:20,767
BUT THE LONGER YOU LEAVE IT,
THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT GETS,

613
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:26,500
SO I NEEDED HIM TO CHIP IN.

614
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,667
- DID HE COME THROUGH?

615
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:32,600
- STOLE A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS
FROM HIS BROTHERS.

616
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,100
- YOUR PARENTS KNOW?

617
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,367
- DAD CALLED ME
A STUPID LITTLE SLUT,

618
01:00:40,467 --> 01:00:45,767
AND MOM DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
SO FUCK THEM BOTH.

619
01:00:45,867 --> 01:00:49,267
- WHERE ARE YOU PLANNING
TO GO NOW?

620
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:52,400
- MY FRIEND KIM
SAID I COULD STAY A WHILE,

621
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,567
AND I CAN GET TO SCHOOL
WITH HER.

622
01:00:59,367 --> 01:01:04,167
- WELL, IF YOU WANT
MY TWO CENTS,

623
01:01:04,267 --> 01:01:06,133
YOU PROBABLY SCARED THE SHIT
OUT OF THEM ALREADY

624
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:10,600
RUNNING AWAY LIKE THIS.

625
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:15,233
I KNOW IT'LL BE HARD TO GO BACK
AND FACE THEM, BUT...

626
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:21,033
I'M SURE IF YOU DO,
THEY'LL LISTEN THIS TIME,

627
01:01:21,133 --> 01:01:25,867
MAKE IT RIGHT.

628
01:01:25,967 --> 01:01:28,200
- THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE.

629
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:53,700
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

630
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:58,667
WHAT'S IT LIKE HAVING KIDS?

631
01:02:00,067 --> 01:02:02,467
- IT'S SCARY...

632
01:02:02,567 --> 01:02:06,933
BUT WORTH IT.

633
01:02:07,033 --> 01:02:11,000
I CRIED LIKE A BABY
WHEN SHE WAS BORN.

634
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:14,500
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT.

635
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,267
I DON'T KNOW;
THEY FILL YOU WITH SOMETHING

636
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:23,233
YOU NEVER REALLY KNEW YOU NEEDED
OR WANTED.

637
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:28,033
AND NO ONE WILL EVER HUG YOU
LIKE YOUR OWN KID

638
01:02:28,133 --> 01:02:30,633
WHEN YOU COME HOME
FROM WORK OR...

639
01:02:30,733 --> 01:02:31,767
THEY HEAR A BUMP IN THE NIGHT.

640
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:34,733
THEY COME TO YOU FOR PROTECTION.

641
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,800
YOU GIVE 'EM A CUDDLE,

642
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,000
AND THEY GO STRAIGHT BACK
TO SLEEP,

643
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,633
'CAUSE YOU'RE SO STRONG--

644
01:02:40,733 --> 01:02:43,700
AT LEAST, THEY THINK YOU ARE.

645
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,300
MAKES YOU FEEL IMPORTANT.

646
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,900
I REMEMBER THINKING
I WANTED TO TEACH HER

647
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,200
ALL OF LIFE'S LITTLE SECRETS,

648
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,633
ALL THOSE THINGS I KNEW
AND NO ONE ELSE DID,

649
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:03,267
WARN HER ABOUT BOYS.

650
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:05,500
I NEVER KNEW QUITE
WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HER,

651
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,067
THAT'S FOR SURE.

652
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:09,733
SOMETIMES SHE'D LOCK HERSELF
IN HER ROOM,

653
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:11,667
WOULDN'T TALK TO ANYONE.

654
01:03:11,767 --> 01:03:15,300
SHE GOT THAT FROM ME.

655
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:20,900
OTHER TIMES, SHE'D GO CRAZY
AND THROW PARTIES.

656
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,300
SHE WAS SUCH A LITTLE
DRAMA QUEEN.

657
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,067
SHE GOT THAT FROM HER MOTHER.

658
01:03:31,067 --> 01:03:32,767
WHAT REALLY SCARES ME,
THOUGH, IS,

659
01:03:32,867 --> 01:03:37,000
I THINK SHE REALLY FELT ALONE.

660
01:03:40,967 --> 01:03:45,033
THAT'S THE WORST THING
YOU CAN FEEL.

661
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,433
- DID YOU WANT
TO SCATTER HER SOMEWHERE?

662
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:57,633
- SOMEWHERE WITH WATER,

663
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:01,933
THE BEACH OR A RIVER.

664
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:04,933
NOW I JUST WANT TO DO IT,
GET IT OVER WITH.

665
01:04:05,033 --> 01:04:08,000
CAN'T KEEP HER LOCKED UP
IN A POT.

666
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,433
- WE JUST PASSED A TURNOFF
FOR THE BEACH.

667
01:05:34,967 --> 01:05:37,100
[cell phone beeping]

668
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,667
WHAT'S UP?

669
01:05:59,033 --> 01:06:01,133
- NOTHING, JUST A CLIENT.

670
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,133
- HAVE YOU GOT MORE BUSINESS
OR SOMETHING?

671
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:15,000
- NO.

672
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,600
I'M FINISHED.

673
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:40,733
SO WHERE AM I DROPPING YOU?

674
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,767
- HOME.

675
01:06:49,467 --> 01:06:50,600
- SHIT.

676
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,633
- WHAT?

677
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:21,433
- SORRY, I'M AWARE
I WAS SPEEDING.

678
01:07:21,533 --> 01:07:23,067
- YOUR LICENSE.

679
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:33,367
KEEP YOUR HANDS
ON THE STEERING WHEEL.

680
01:07:38,867 --> 01:07:39,833
- WHO'S TRAVELING WITH YOU?

681
01:07:39,933 --> 01:07:40,900
- HER NAME'S--

682
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,467
- I'M TALKING TO HER.

683
01:07:42,567 --> 01:07:45,733
- UH, ALICE?

684
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,267
- DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

685
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:49,467
- YEAH.

01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:53,867
CAN YOU PLEASE STEP
OUT OF THE CAR, THANK YOU?

687
01:07:53,967 --> 01:07:55,167
- WHY?

688
01:07:55,267 --> 01:07:56,167
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

689
01:07:56,267 --> 01:07:58,667
- GET OUT OF THE CAR.

690
01:07:58,767 --> 01:08:02,100

MOVE ROUND THE FRONT OF THE CAR.

693
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,000
STAY THERE.

NOW GET OUT.

695
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:12,133
CLOSE THE DOOR.

696
01:08:12,233 --> 01:08:13,833
UP AGAINST THE CAR.

697
01:08:13,933 --> 01:08:16,400
TURN ROUND AGAINST THE CAR.

698
01:08:18,533 --> 01:08:20,033
DON'T LOOK AT ME;
LOOK AT THE CAR.

699
01:08:20,133 --> 01:08:22,733

STOP THERE!

TELL ME.

716
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,633
TELL ME!

717
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:24,833
- SOME MEN HURT JESSE.

718
01:09:24,933 --> 01:09:27,100
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

719
01:10:24,967 --> 01:10:27,167
- WHERE ARE YOU TAKING US?

720
01:10:30,767 --> 01:10:33,767
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

721
01:10:33,867 --> 01:10:34,100
WHERE ARE WE?

722
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:38,500
DON'T FUCKING--

723
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,600
- GET OUT OF THE CAR!

724
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:42,467
- LEAVE HER ALONE!

725
01:10:42,567 --> 01:10:46,767
LEAVE HER!

726
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:49,033
- NO, PLEASE!

727
01:10:54,433 --> 01:10:57,167
[screaming]

728
01:10:58,533 --> 01:11:01,600
- LET HER GO!

729
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,933
- G'DAY.

730
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:28,167
YOU MUST BE MR. FORTESKY.

731
01:11:28,267 --> 01:11:30,800
HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING FOR ME?

732
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,433
- NO.

733
01:11:32,533 --> 01:11:34,467
- REALLY?

734
01:11:34,567 --> 01:11:35,733
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE.

735
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:42,200
- HIS WALLET, KEYS, KNIFE,
AND YOUR MATE'S MOBILE PHONE.

736
01:11:47,033 --> 01:11:49,867
- YOU SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN RID OF THIS.

737
01:11:49,967 --> 01:11:51,233
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T.

738
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:53,533
YOU'D BE SURPRISED THE CONTACTS
I'VE GOT, RIGHT?

739
01:11:53,633 --> 01:11:55,633
- OH, FUCK OFF.

740
01:11:55,733 --> 01:11:57,333
- YEAH, YEAH.

741
01:12:00,633 --> 01:12:03,267
JEEZ, YOUSE PIGS
ARE GETTING EXPENSIVE.

742
01:12:03,367 --> 01:12:06,300
YOU HANGING AROUND
THIS TIME, HMM?

743
01:12:08,067 --> 01:12:10,467
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE GIRL?

744
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:11,867
- WHAT?

745
01:12:11,967 --> 01:12:13,167
- THE GIRL.

746
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:15,933
- YOU LIKE HER,
YOU DIRTY OLD PIG, HUH?

747
01:12:16,033 --> 01:12:17,700
- DON'T FUCKIN' TOUCH ME.

748
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,433
- [laughs]

749
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:22,133
- HANG ON TO HIM.

750
01:12:22,233 --> 01:12:23,133
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

751
01:12:23,233 --> 01:12:24,400
- I'M TAKIN' MY CUFFS.

752
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,500
- WE'RE USING 'EM.

753
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,733
- WHAT, THE FOUR OF YOU
CAN'T HANG ON TO HIM?

754
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:29,967
- HOLD HIM.
HOLD HIM.

755
01:12:30,067 --> 01:12:31,600
GIVE ME THE GIRL.

756
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,600
GIVE ME THE GIRL!

757
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:35,700
[voices overlapping]

758
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,867
- PLEASE, SHE'S GOT NOTHING--

759
01:12:36,967 --> 01:12:37,633
PLEASE, SHE'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH--

760
01:12:37,733 --> 01:12:40,033
- SHE'LL BE FINE.

761
01:12:40,133 --> 01:12:42,400
WE'RE LOVERS, NOT FIGHTERS.

762
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,433
- COME ON, I'VE GOT PLENTY OF--
I'VE GOT MONEY!

763
01:12:45,533 --> 01:12:48,600
- REALLY?
- YES.

764
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,567
- HOW MUCH IS SHE WORTH?

765
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:54,533
- $10,000.

766
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:56,867
- YEAH?
- YES.

767
01:12:56,967 --> 01:12:57,867
- HOW ABOUT $20,000?

768
01:12:57,967 --> 01:12:58,833
- SURE.

769
01:12:58,933 --> 01:13:00,000
- NOT BAD.

770
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,867
I THINK WE CAN SQUEEZE
A LITTLE MORE.

771
01:13:01,967 --> 01:13:03,200
- HOW ABOUT $100,000?

772
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,600
- WE CAN GO TO THE BANK
TOMORROW.

773
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,567
ANYTHING, $100,000.

774
01:13:06,667 --> 01:13:09,267
I CAN ARRANGE IT.

775
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:17,100
- YOU KNOW, I WENT TO SCHOOL
WITH JIM AND HIS BROTHER!

776
01:13:18,367 --> 01:13:21,300
HUH?

777
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:24,867
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKIN'?

778
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:27,300
I'M GONNA GET MY MONEY'S WORTH
OUT OF THE TWO OF YOUSE TONIGHT.

779
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,333
OH, YEAH.

780
01:13:30,433 --> 01:13:34,733
GET THE ROPE AND TIE HIM UP,
CHUCK.

781
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:35,933
TAKE HIM DOWN.

782
01:13:36,033 --> 01:13:36,933
- LITTLE PARTY?

783
01:13:37,033 --> 01:13:39,733
- YEAH, MY BOY, DIG IN.

784
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,333
- GIVE ME THE ARMS.

785
01:13:41,433 --> 01:13:42,667
- FUCK OFF!

786
01:13:42,767 --> 01:13:43,667
FUCK OFF!

787
01:13:43,767 --> 01:13:45,567
- LET'S GO, PLEASE.

788
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:50,867
- GET ON HIM.

789
01:13:50,967 --> 01:13:51,100
- OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE.

790
01:13:54,533 --> 01:13:58,533
- GET YOUR ASS UP!

791
01:13:58,633 --> 01:13:59,567
- HOLD HIM, CHUCK.

792
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:03,433
- [growling]

793
01:14:07,467 --> 01:14:09,433
- HOLD HIM.

794
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:10,100
HOLD HIM!

795
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,033
[grunts]

796
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:10,233
[both grunting]

797
01:15:15,667 --> 01:15:16,567
[cracking sound]

798
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:17,767
- [screams]

799
01:15:17,867 --> 01:15:20,200
YOU FUCKIN'--

800
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:23,033
[grunts]

801
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:27,000
[metallic clang]

802
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,367
- [groans]

803
01:16:14,033 --> 01:16:15,500
[shattering crash]

804
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,567
- GET THE FUCK UP.

805
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:20,067
[metallic clang]

806
01:16:30,733 --> 01:16:33,667
[both grunting]

807
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:33,067
- WE DON'T EVEN SLEEP
IN THE SAME ROOM.

808
01:17:33,167 --> 01:17:36,467
WHEN WE WATCH TELEVISION,
SHE WATCHES IT IN HER ROOM.

809
01:17:36,567 --> 01:17:37,833
I WATCH IT IN MY ROOM.

810
01:17:37,933 --> 01:17:41,100
I HAVEN'T SLEPT WITH HER
FOR TWO YEARS.

811
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:44,667
A MAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO SLEEP
WITH HIS OWN WIFE.

812
01:17:44,767 --> 01:17:45,700
WHY DOES--
FUCK!

813
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,767
- LEAVE HER THE FUCK ALONE!

814
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,867
[gunshots]

815
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:01,333
- [sobbing]

816
01:18:01,433 --> 01:18:02,500
- YOU OKAY?

817
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:05,000
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

818
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,767
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

819
01:18:07,867 --> 01:18:09,233
- COME HERE, YOU FUCKER!

820
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,667
- [sobbing]

821
01:18:44,733 --> 01:18:48,533
- LOOK WHO'S WAKING UP.

822
01:18:48,633 --> 01:18:50,733
HEY.

823
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:52,500
FUCK!

824
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,933
- CHARLES, JUST HANG ON.

825
01:18:55,033 --> 01:18:56,067
HANG ON.

826
01:18:59,967 --> 01:19:02,033
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH OF A HEADACHE

827
01:19:02,133 --> 01:19:03,267
THAT DEAD PIG'S GONNA BE?

828
01:19:03,367 --> 01:19:05,267
HUH?

829
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:08,133
YOU FUCK WITH ONE,
AND THE REST COME AFTER YOU.

830
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:20,533
ANYWAY,

831
01:19:20,633 --> 01:19:25,767
THIS LITTLE PRINCESS AND I
HAVE GOT TO GET READY.

832
01:19:25,867 --> 01:19:28,433
GOT SOMEONE SPECIAL ON THEIR WAY
OVER HERE TO MEET HER.

833
01:19:32,433 --> 01:19:34,133
HMM?

834
01:19:44,933 --> 01:19:47,633
BEFORE WE GO...

835
01:19:47,733 --> 01:19:48,767
WE MIGHT HAVE THAT LITTLE CHAT

836
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:51,600
ABOUT THAT SLAG DAUGHTER
OF YOURS.

837
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:55,633
YOU STILL WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED, RIGHT?

838
01:19:55,733 --> 01:19:57,633
- I KNOW WHAT YOU DID TO HER.

839
01:19:57,733 --> 01:20:02,100
- BUT YOU'VE BEEN MISSING OUT
ON ALL OF THE GOOD BITS.

840
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:06,633
SEE, SHE GOT A LITTLE UP TIGHT
BEFORE THE SHOOT.

841
01:20:06,733 --> 01:20:10,867
BIT OF "H" SETTLED HER DOWN.

842
01:20:10,967 --> 01:20:12,267
BUT SHE ASKED FOR IT.

843
01:20:12,367 --> 01:20:17,300
HONEST.

844
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,933
DIDN'T GIVE A GOOD LOOK, THOUGH.

845
01:20:20,033 --> 01:20:22,600
FINN WASN'T TOO HAPPY.

846
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:25,333
BUT SHE DIDN'T COMPLAIN.

847
01:20:25,433 --> 01:20:27,300
NO.

848
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,200
IN FACT...

849
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:33,967
SHE WANTED A LITTLE TOPPER
BEFORE SHE LEFT.

850
01:20:34,067 --> 01:20:35,567
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

851
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:39,667
HMM?

852
01:20:39,767 --> 01:20:41,867
YEAH, WE HAD A LITTLE
PRIVATE TIME TOGETHER.

853
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:42,867
- [screams]

854
01:20:42,967 --> 01:20:43,867
- OH, YEAH.

855
01:20:43,967 --> 01:20:44,867
YOU HEARD ME.

856
01:20:44,967 --> 01:20:47,100
- [screaming]

857
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,433
- BUT HEY...

858
01:20:53,533 --> 01:20:54,767
I HAD TO GIVE THE HOSPITAL
A CALL

859
01:20:54,867 --> 01:20:57,633
RIGHT AFTER I DUMPED HER OFF.

860
01:20:57,733 --> 01:20:59,633
SO THAT'S GOT TO BE WORTH
A COUPLE OF POINTS THERE.

861
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,333
IF IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE...

862
01:21:09,433 --> 01:21:12,500
I DID FEEL PRETTY ROTTEN
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

863
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,300
- NO!

864
01:21:33,733 --> 01:21:34,733
- NOW...

865
01:21:34,833 --> 01:21:36,867
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

866
01:21:36,967 --> 01:21:38,800
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

867
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,100
I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU
WITH CHUCK HERE.

868
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,833
AS MUCH AS I'D LOVE TO STAY
AND WATCH,

869
01:21:43,933 --> 01:21:46,667
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

870
01:21:46,767 --> 01:21:48,733
I REALLY DON'T LIKE VIOLENCE.

871
01:21:54,933 --> 01:21:57,467
- [shushing]

872
01:21:57,567 --> 01:21:59,633
- [gasps]

873
01:21:59,733 --> 01:22:01,233
- [sobbing]

874
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,433
- COME ON, LOVE.

875
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,567
COME ON.

876
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:29,300
SEE YA.

877
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,700
- [shushing]

878
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,767
[chuckles]

879
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:47,200
ALONE AT LAST, EH?

880
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,067
MM.

881
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:14,467
OKAY.

882
01:23:14,567 --> 01:23:16,767
NOW, YOU MIGHT FEEL
A SMALL PINCH, YEAH?

883
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:18,933
LET ME KNOW IF IT HURTS,
ALL RIGHT?

884
01:23:19,033 --> 01:23:21,467
OKAY?

885
01:23:21,567 --> 01:23:24,467
WAIT, WAIT.

886
01:23:24,567 --> 01:23:26,600
STOP FUCKING MOVING.

887
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,433
OH, OH, WHOA, WHOA.

888
01:23:30,633 --> 01:23:32,567
[tearing sound]

889
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:50,267
RIGHT.

890
01:23:50,367 --> 01:23:52,000
NOW...

891
01:23:53,933 --> 01:23:55,133
JUST LET ME
SEAL THAT UP FOR YOU.

892
01:23:58,467 --> 01:24:01,267
- [screaming]

893
01:24:34,067 --> 01:24:35,900
- HEY.

894
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:36,733
- WHERE'S DEREK?

895
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:37,600
- HE'S IN THE SHED.

896
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:40,267
- WHERE?
- OVER THERE.

897
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:40,867
THERE.
