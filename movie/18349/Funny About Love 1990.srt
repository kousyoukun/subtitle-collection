1
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,055
Here you are.

2
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:00,389
- Make it out to you?
- No, for my cousin Loretta.

3
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:03,523
Could you sign "with love"?

4
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:22,249
- Excuse me.
- This is terrific, isn't it?

5
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,415
He's very talented. And funny.

6
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:28,881
This is a notion
Duffy and I kicked around.

7
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:32,296
- It matured into this.
- You work with him?

8
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:34,470
No, I'm a paediatrician.

9
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:39,058
But I am his best friend.
We went to college together.

10
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:42,804
- I'd love to meet him.
- Let me have your number.

11
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:45,062
I'll see what I can do.

12
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:49,684
Being a cartoonist
is the hardest job in the world.

13
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:54,365
No, that title has to go
to Noriega's dermatologist.

14
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:57,322
Very funny!

15
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,037
Excuse me, excuse me.

16
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:06,958
Duffy, Duffy. That redhead
over there, she's a big fan.

17
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:11,631
- Really wants you to call.
- Spare me. I can't go through that.

18
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:15,127
- Don't you want to meet women?
- Not the way you do.

19
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:17,801
You use a spear gun and I use a net.

20
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:21,467
I don't fall for every woman
I make eye contact with.

21
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:24,307
- Do you mind if I use this?
- Be my guest.

22
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:26,810
Somebody was Wendy's friend.

23
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:29,815
Thank you.

24
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:37,320
- What is this?
- Your cappuccino.

25
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:40,819
You think this is cappuccino?
Taste it!

26
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:44,157
- Don't start.
- Mr Celebrity, you want another cup?

27
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:47,577
No. Could I meet
the person who made it?

28
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,082
- This way.
- Thank you. Excuse me.

29
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:56,050
A little emergency just came up.
I'll be right back. Don't go away.

30
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:01,465
- It's just a cup of coffee.
- It's not just a cup of coffee.

31
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:07,678
Excuse me. Hello!
Hello, folks. Excuse me.

32
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:11,348
Who is the Bulgarian bear wrestler
who made this?

33
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:16,145
- I'm the Bulgarian bear wrestler.
- This is delicious.

34
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:20,313
- Oh?
- Really wonderful coffee.

35
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:23,986
- He said he hates the coffee.
- This guy!

36
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:28,154
I said I hate the coughing!
It was driving me nuts.

37
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:32,954
You can breathe in stuff, you get colds.
The coffee was sensational.

38
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:38,083
Oh, thanks. I'm so flattered.
Why don't you have some more?

39
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:40,341
- No, no.
- I insist.

40
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:45,588
- A nice big cup.
- Oh, boy! Thank you.

41
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:49,094
Oh, my. Gosh. Thank you.

42
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:52,805
Oh, you can just...

43
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:55,479
- Nice aroma!
- Yeah.

44
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:02,902
- How do you do this?
- It's my little secret.

45
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:05,572
- Don't tell anyone.
- No, I won't.

46
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:10,199
You don't want the word to get out
about this stuff. Oh, no.

47
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:14,365
- Duff, they need you out there.
- I have to go to work now.

48
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:18,537
- What a shame. So do I.
- Could I talk with you later?

49
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,050
Finish your cappuccino
and then we'll see.

50
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:24,717
I would like to talk with you.

51
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,552
- I'll be busy.
- You mean working?

52
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:32,559
No, I'm taking my private jet
to St Moritz for the skiing.

53
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:35,393
Duffy, there are people waiting for you.

54
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,561
Bye.

55
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:54,660
Last one. Good night, everybody.

56
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,915
Good night. Take care.

57
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:04,459
- Are you cooking tomorrow night?
- Yes, I'll be there, 8.00. Good night.

58
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:06,965
Hey! Yo!

59
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:09,966
Hey! Hey, lady!

60
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:15,102
Wait a second. Hello, there!
Do you ski here often?

61
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:19,689
Yeah, once in a while.

62
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:24,397
I came to see if I could ski you home.
Hold on one second.

63
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:29,524
Don't go away. I want to apologise.
Please! I brought you a present.

64
00:06:29,743 --> 00:06:33,871
Look. Here, taste this, will you?
Give this a little taste.

65
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:37,948
- Tell me what you think.
- Why are you dressed like this?

66
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:43,079
- I'm going to St Moritz.
- Oh. Yeah, right.

67
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:51,929
That's pretty good.

68
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,547
- How did you make this?
- Tell me your name.

69
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:57,437
- Tell me how you did this.
- It's easy.

70
00:06:57,645 --> 00:07:01,974
You have an automatic coffee grinder.
You put it on a 1.8 setting.

71
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:04,943
You have to have a rich, heavy coffee.

72
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:09,066
You can't use some dumb
Costa Rican/Haitian blend.

73
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:11,738
The milk has to be room temperature,

74
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:17,325
otherwise the machine takes so long
heating up that you burn the coffee.

75
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,494
That's all. Coffee's important to me.

76
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,585
- This is really quite amazing.
- So you'll tell me your name?

77
00:07:25,798 --> 00:07:31,338
- Meg. Meg Lloyd.
- Meg? Very short.

78
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:33,546
That's a very short name.

79
00:07:33,764 --> 00:07:36,967
- This party was for you, right?
- Yeah.

80
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:41,134
- Do you like a fuss made over you?
- Sometimes. Don't you?

81
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:43,312
No, I'm from Maine.

82
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:48,481
We don't need much to keep us happy.
Lobster every now and then.

83
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:52,645
How did you know that I used
a Costa Rican/Haitian blend?

84
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:58,073
- What are you doing on Thursday?
- Thursday? Oh, shoot!

85
00:07:58,287 --> 00:08:00,245
- I have a date.
- With who?

86
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:02,365
With you.

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,372
Next on Live With Regis And Kathie Lee,

88
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,707
controversial cartoonist Duffy Bergman!

89
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,507
What was the comic strip
that Mr Hatcher wouldn't run?

90
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:18,635
The president of the NRA with
a sign: "Guns don't kill children.

91
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,807
"Children kill children."

92
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:22,976
That was satire.

93
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:27,683
A hunter with a smoking gun
between his legs is satire?

94
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,150
We feel we were simply
exercising good taste.

95
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:33,271
Exercising good taste?

96
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:37,652
What is that? Is that Alistair Cooke
on a treadmill machine?

97
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:41,153
Is Jesse Helms in good taste?

98
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:45,451
Are legal assault guns
used by drug lords in good taste?

99
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,751
Polluted fish in the Great Lakes
taste good?

100
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,413
The only thing I know
that is 100% good taste

101
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:57,175
is Ben & Jerry's Vanilla Ice Cream
with crushed HEATH Bars.

102
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,509
That's good taste!

103
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:05,094
And they told me he was shy!
We'll be back.

104
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,609
- That was terrific.
- Honest?

105
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,283
- Yeah.
- Good.

106
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:23,359
Tomorrow I'm going to quit the strip
and finish my musical.

107
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:26,284
- Wait a second. You're quitting?
- Yeah.

108
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:32,039
- Did you think I went overboard?
- On the show? No, it was great.

109
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:36,501
- They told me to be animated.
- You didn't disappoint them.

110
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:39,634
- But...?
- But nothing.

111
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,921
I see that twinkle in your eye.

112
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:44,096
- What?
- Tell me.

113
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:46,265
- It's nothing.
- What?

114
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:50,260
I just don't get
what you're trying to do here.

115
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,272
It seems to me that your strip
is getting more popular, right?

116
00:09:55,485 --> 00:09:58,106
- Yeah.
- You love doing it, right?

117
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:01,772
- I do.
- Here comes this guy Thatcher...

118
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:03,617
- Thanks.
- Hatcher.

119
00:10:03,827 --> 00:10:06,614
Hatcher supports you 99% of the time.

120
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,163
- 95.
- He objects to just one storyline.

121
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,834
- Right?
- Yeah.

122
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:15,993
I don't get why you want
to throw this away, unless...

123
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:18,171
Unless...? Unless? Unless?

124
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:20,007
- Never mind.
- Unless what?

125
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:23,088
You're self-indulgent and childish!

126
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:27,254
Yes, I am.
You want to play house with me?

127
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,837
- Hi.
- Welcome to my house.

128
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:03,924
Thank you.

129
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:11,142
I made you a little something.
I thought we might get hungry.

130
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:14,305
Perfect! I got something for you, too.

131
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:17,972
- Wait right here.
- What?

132
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:22,769
- Don't look till I say when.
- OK, OK, OK. What?

133
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,404
Now look.

134
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:34,820
- It's wonderful.
- Really? You really like it?

135
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,125
Oh, it's... What is it?

136
00:11:41,338 --> 00:11:47,174
Well, I call it
Flying Angel Coming to Cook for Me.

137
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:52,297
It's great.

138
00:11:56,728 --> 00:12:01,023
This is a great place.
Have you always lived here alone?

139
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:05,776
- No, I was married for a while.
- Really? What happened?

140
00:12:11,993 --> 00:12:15,943
That good, huh?
I was married for three years.

141
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:20,292
- What happened?
- It was all my fault.

142
00:12:20,502 --> 00:12:25,459
I just couldn't get along with
the other woman he was seeing.

143
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:31,792
- That's funny.
- Thanks.

144
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:40,973
Sure, sure! That's all right.
You go on, Rudy, have a good time.

145
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:46,146
Don't you worry about me,
just 'cause I'm blind and deaf...

146
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,981
- Sh, sh.
- Don't worry about me.

147
00:12:49,196 --> 00:12:52,647
- I'll make out all right.
- It's OK.

148
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,789
Of course. It's perfect.

149
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:40,127
- Is it my birthday?
- Every day is your birthday.

150
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:47,429
Oh, look!

151
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:49,934
Oh, it's great!

152
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,043
Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me.

153
00:15:58,548 --> 00:16:00,172
Excuse me.

154
00:16:55,353 --> 00:17:00,311
I'm sorry I'm late.
The plane was circling for 45 minutes.

155
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:03,728
- I know. I called the airport.
- Forgive me.

156
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:09,235
I know how important this is to you.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

157
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:19,916
It's OK. Don't worry.
We'll do it next month.

158
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:26,756
Do you know how cute you look
with your hair wet like that?

159
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:32,674
- Everything was perfect.
- Yep.

160
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:36,838
Your eggs were right,
temperature was just right.

161
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,017
I have an idea.

162
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:41,185
It just hit me.

163
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:46,024
- Why don't we do it anyway?
- The doctor said to try around noon.

164
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:48,193
- It's 4.15.
- So what?

165
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:51,524
Maybe your eggs are on California time.

166
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:54,695
Is that not possible?

167
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,615
Oh, all right. Come on.

168
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:03,910
Worst thing that can happen,

169
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:07,579
we'll have two hours
of incredible, unreproductive sex.

170
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:11,249
Work, work, work! All I do is work!

171
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:15,086
It's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.

172
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:17,713
Take off your clothes.
This shouldn't hurt.

173
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,508
It's nobody's fault, Mr Bergman.

174
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:24,178
26 million couples a year
have difficulty conceiving.

175
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:28,644
- But it can't be nobody's fault.
- Duffy, come on.

176
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,311
You're saying it's my fault
we can't have a baby.

177
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,694
- I didn't say it was your fault.
- I want the answer to a question.

178
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:40,990
Mr Bergman,
could I ask you a question?

179
00:18:41,206 --> 00:18:44,789
- Yes.
- Are you sure you want a child?

180
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:52,962
Am I sure I want a child?
You mean, do I want to have a baby?

181
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:04,305
Excuse me, Dr Benjamin,
could we just have a few moments?

182
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,429
Of course.

183
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:10,063
- Just let me know when you're ready.
- Thanks.

184
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:16,238
- OK. What's going on?
- You're not going to like it.

185
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:21,406
Come on, come on.
Open those lips and tell me.

186
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,905
- Come on.
- I'm scared.

187
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:29,073
You're scared?
What are you scared of?

188
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:35,248
I'm scared that if we have a baby,
I won't get the hugs and the kisses

189
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,836
and all the holding that I'm used to.

190
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,011
Oh, Duffy.

191
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,180
Oh, honey.

192
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:49,012
I've got so many kisses
and so many hugs.

193
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:54,651
I've got, like, a trillion of them.
There's plenty to go around.

194
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,864
Now we'll start on some tests.

195
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:07,371
Some tests? What kind of tests?
Multiple choice? Essays?

196
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,531
Do I need a number-two pencil?
Maybe I have a number-two pencil.

197
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,536
You have a wonderful,
giant redwood tree of a pencil.

198
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,045
- She said it.
- Let him do this.

199
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,928
The woman knows. What's happening?

200
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,421
It's an auditory monitor
of your scrotal activity.

201
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:27,593
Oh, I thought maybe you were lonely.

202
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,478
Would you like to listen to your testicles?

203
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,604
- Who wouldn't?
- I would.

204
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:39,605
I just plug the stethoscope
into these speakers.

205
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,814
I flick this switch...

206
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,986
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

207
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,239
I laughed at love
'cause I thought it was funny

208
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:53,405
- Just a joke, Mr Bergman.
- Is that what it was?

209
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:57,576
- How amusing!
- I'm trying to get you to relax.

210
00:20:57,797 --> 00:21:01,462
Yes, I feel much better now.
Thank you, Doctor.

211
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:05,543
- You want my sperm in this cup?
- That's right, Mr Bergman.

212
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,720
- Good luck.
- We'll wait outside.

213
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:11,217
Wait a minute!
You make this sound easy.

214
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:13,392
I've never done this before.

215
00:21:13,604 --> 00:21:17,388
- Come, come, Mr Bergman.
- You want me to do it twice?

216
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:21,059
We'll be here all day.
I deal in quality, not quantity.

217
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:24,563
- What do you want, a quart?
- Excuse us.

218
00:21:26,032 --> 00:21:28,986
- Duff...
- It's not so easy.

219
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:31,159
Come here, come here.

220
00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:39,377
I think maybe we should try to work
on this together. What do you say?

221
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:44,337
Is this business or pleasure?

222
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:54,008
Intense heat can kill
the reproductive quality in sperm.

223
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:59,185
- Have you been in a hot tub?
- At my health club. How do you know?

224
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:02,933
All your sperm
are wearing terry-cloth robes.

225
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,272
- There he goes again.
- Very funny.

226
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,737
All we need to do is lower
the temperature of your sperm.

227
00:22:11,952 --> 00:22:16,246
- This should do the trick.
- What the heck...?

228
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:21,449
- What's this little pocket for?
- Ice.

229
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,920
- You're doing fine.
- I look silly.

230
00:22:25,132 --> 00:22:28,751
- Here, climb on.
- No, go away!

231
00:22:32,348 --> 00:22:35,302
Come here, come here. Here.

232
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:40,969
I really think this is the one,
the love of my life.

233
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,104
I'm so delighted, Hugo.
You don't know her last name?

234
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,607
She is vague about personal details,

235
00:22:47,821 --> 00:22:51,984
but I think this is normal
in the Witness Protection Program.

236
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,277
Sorry I'm so late. I had to wait
for the boss to approve my apple crisp.

237
00:22:57,497 --> 00:22:59,952
- How did you do?
- I got a gold star.

238
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,075
Why did I ask?

239
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:05,413
It's excellent!
You are so good in the kitchen.

240
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,547
- Thanks.
- The bedroom, I don't know.

241
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:10,003
- Ma!
- Adele!

242
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:13,669
Did I offend
the sensitive Bergman men?

243
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:16,046
Hold your tongue once in a while.

244
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:21,140
It's only in your cartoons that people
may speak without being censored.

245
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:23,346
No one's censoring you.

246
00:23:23,564 --> 00:23:28,985
"Hold your tongue!" Did anyone hear
that? How about Mr Lonely Hearts?

247
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:31,353
- I was chewing.
- We're trying, OK?

248
00:23:31,572 --> 00:23:35,985
- Try a little harder.
- Is it a question of velocity?

249
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:40,614
- Shut up about babies!
- Pardon me for wanting a grandchild!

250
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:44,282
- You're talking to your mother.
- She likes confrontation.

251
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:48,000
- You're darn right.
- You want us to do it right here?

252
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:51,831
- Why not?
- I'll move the bagels and the lox.

253
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,633
- Missionary or the usual?
- The usual. They get a better view.

254
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:58,846
If it's like our usual,
I don't want to see it!

255
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:03,635
- How about this, Ma? A grandkid!
- Put your pants back on!

256
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:09,357
Wait a second! We can't try
any harder to have a baby, OK?

257
00:24:11,152 --> 00:24:15,445
Our staff will show you how to do this.

258
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:21,528
You give Meg these shots every day
to boost her production of eggs.

259
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:31,956
- I'm surprised at how calm I am.
- Honey, you can do it.

260
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:34,415
Come on, it's a snap.

261
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,466
- Here we go.
- OK.

262
00:24:39,263 --> 00:24:41,255
No problem.

263
00:24:41,473 --> 00:24:43,383
Nice and clean.

264
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,979
Almost done, almost done.

265
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:59,031
Done! I'm sorry, honey.

266
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,656
- Did it hurt?
- No, I liked it. Do it again.

267
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,823
- One more time.
- Yeah. No, no!

268
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,414
This is as far as you go, Mr Bergman.

269
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:24,092
- See you in a little while.
- Good luck.

270
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:28,007
Sure. Don't you worry about me.
I'll be swell.

271
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:32,854
Go on, have a good time.
Don't give me another thought.

272
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,173
There's your cup, Mr Bergman.

273
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:07,296
Turn on the red light when you're
done, and please wash your hands.

274
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:53,942
Oh, I'm sorry!
I thought this room was empty.

275
00:27:54,161 --> 00:27:57,779
- Is that the July issue?
- Get out of here.

276
00:28:09,592 --> 00:28:11,881
Honey, help me.

277
00:28:12,095 --> 00:28:15,595
Meg, help me, please.

278
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,857
I got an egg.

279
00:29:16,742 --> 00:29:18,781
How does it look?

280
00:29:19,703 --> 00:29:21,031
It's good.

281
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:34,299
You must have been a beautiful baby

282
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:41,340
You must have been a wonderful child

283
00:29:42,308 --> 00:29:45,593
When you were only startin'

284
00:29:45,811 --> 00:29:48,729
To go to kindergarten

285
00:29:48,939 --> 00:29:54,894
I bet you drove the little boys wild

286
00:29:55,112 --> 00:30:02,075
And when it came
to winning blue ribbons

287
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:08,453
You must have shown
the other kids how

288
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:12,997
I can see the judges' eyes

289
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:16,831
As they handed you the prize

290
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:23,005
I bet you made the cutest bow

291
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:30,269
Oh! You must have been
a beautiful baby

292
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:38,442
'Cause, baby, look at you now

293
00:30:55,546 --> 00:30:57,704
I made you a batch of cappuccino.

294
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:59,880
- Batch?
- Yep.

295
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,250
Wow, thanks.

296
00:31:18,652 --> 00:31:23,444
Yow! This is it! This is the best
cappuccino you've ever made.

297
00:31:23,657 --> 00:31:28,947
- On a scale from one to ten?
- Eight to eight and a half.

298
00:31:29,162 --> 00:31:31,285
- Really?
- Serious.

299
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:34,664
What's the matter with your eye?

300
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:37,248
- Nothing.
- Why is your eye twitching?

301
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,416
- I have a lash caught in my eye.
- No.

302
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:43,716
I can't believe you're lying to me.

303
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:49,302
Jesus! I can't even make
a stupid cup of cappuccino.

304
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:53,133
- I can't make anything.
- You make stuff all the time.

305
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:56,555
What's going on? What's happening?

306
00:31:56,772 --> 00:31:58,811
I got my period, Duff.

307
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:05,941
I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry.

308
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,363
- I'm sorry.
- I can't make a baby.

309
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:15,489
You've got to stop beating yourself up
like this. It's no good.

310
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:19,076
- Let's just forget about kids.
- I can't.

311
00:32:19,294 --> 00:32:23,755
I've always had a thing about kids.
I can't imagine not having them.

312
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:28,295
Well, let's just postpone it,
get our minds off this thing.

313
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:30,967
Let's think about our careers.

314
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:34,300
Easy for you to say. You have a career.

315
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:38,811
Didn't The Village Voice
just put you in the comic pantheon?

316
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:43,648
What am I in? I'm in the kitchen
cooking with six illegal aliens.

317
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:48,320
- I'm not even good at it.
- What's coming out of those lippers?

318
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:51,485
Are you crazy?
You're a sensational chef.

319
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,152
You're the only American chef
who's cooking American.

320
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:58,288
I see you one day
in the frying pan-theon.

321
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:02,497
- I really do! What about...?
- No, wait. No twitching.

322
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:07,172
No twitching. What about the guy who
wants you as chef of his restaurant?

323
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:11,333
Was he looking for no talent?
Call him, get this show on the road.

324
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:16,014
- You mean Café Pretentious Name?
- Sotto Voce is pretentious to you?

325
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:20,851
Do you know how big a commitment
that job is? It's 18-hour days.

326
00:33:21,063 --> 00:33:23,518
Six, sometimes seven days a week.

327
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:26,686
We couldn't fit sex in, let alone a baby.

328
00:33:26,902 --> 00:33:29,689
- So we'll wait.
- For the baby.

329
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:32,193
Tell him you'll take the job.

330
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:35,527
- I don't think I can do it.
- You can do it!

331
00:33:35,743 --> 00:33:41,034
Say I said that you make the best
cappuccino in the United States.

332
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:45,198
- It's twitching.
- What's going on with the lights?

333
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:48,586
I think we blew a fuse.
Help! Call the super.

334
00:33:56,847 --> 00:33:59,469
This is what I'm talking about.

335
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:02,804
How could you do this?
I owe him my career.

336
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:06,970
Don't you remember working for him,
canvassing with me?

337
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:11,141
I remember being on Columbus Avenue
in winter without a scarf.

338
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:15,656
That's a reason to destroy his life?
While I'm working for him?

339
00:34:15,866 --> 00:34:20,160
- You shouldn't work so hard.
- I wouldn't if we had grandchildren.

340
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:24,498
- Vivian has three adorable kids.
- Two! Roger's a little shit.

341
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:29,500
He's not a little shit.
Oh, you're kidding! Oh, my God!

342
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:33,924
I don't believe this!
They don't make this any more!

343
00:34:34,134 --> 00:34:38,926
Meg's been trying to get this stove
for two months. I'll be right back.

344
00:34:39,138 --> 00:34:42,507
I want to tell her
what's written on the crate.

345
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:46,141
Go ahead. I'll be here
with my head in the oven.

346
00:34:46,354 --> 00:34:51,312
- What is this for? The bedroom?
- Hey, lady, get out of there!

347
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:54,146
Would you move?

348
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:56,604
Hello, it's me, your husband.

349
00:34:56,823 --> 00:35:00,441
Have you got a pen or a pencil handy?
Write this down.

350
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:07,576
Calleverde Brothers, lmporters.

351
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:12,576
Yeah. 'Cause that's what it says
on the side of the crate.

352
00:35:12,797 --> 00:35:17,257
What have we been searching for
for two months? Yes, positive.

353
00:35:17,468 --> 00:35:21,928
I'm sure of it,
because it's got the little white...

354
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:24,511
- It wasn't my fault!
- Ma!

355
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:34,932
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

356
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:38,105
I just can't get over the way she...

357
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:41,772
Well, I guess she died
the way she lived.

358
00:35:41,991 --> 00:35:46,949
- Like Wile E Coyote?
- Oh, Duffy, would you stop that?

359
00:35:49,665 --> 00:35:51,705
Duff...

360
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:11,053
That was a very nice talk
you gave at the service.

361
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,227
What did I say?

362
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:16,808
How Mom was always in a hurry,
couldn't wait.

363
00:36:17,026 --> 00:36:21,984
She managed to get death over with
just like that, one fell swoop.

364
00:36:22,197 --> 00:36:26,444
- It was good.
- I miss her already.

365
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:32,788
Jakey! Oh, honey.
Get out of here, Roger.

366
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:35,834
Roger, hey, come with me, buddy.

367
00:36:36,503 --> 00:36:39,457
Oh, it's OK, honey. It's OK.

368
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:42,626
Don't cry, don't cry.

369
00:36:42,842 --> 00:36:46,792
Please! It's just water.
It's not going to hurt you.

370
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:51,510
Please don't cry.
You're going to make me cry.

371
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,282
Oh, Duff.

372
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:22,168
I know, I know.

373
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:32,005
Four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

374
00:37:39,105 --> 00:37:41,228
Roger, you're a little shit!

375
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:44,940
Roger, honey, come here
and give Mommy a kiss.

376
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:54,161
The hobgoblins came down the hill
and made their camp on the shore.

377
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:58,451
At the bottom of the lake there lived a...

378
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:02,913
- Bear.
- A bear! Right!

379
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:06,794
With a lot of fantastic
scuba-diving equipment

380
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:10,591
and a great big spear gun
so he could hunt for the...

381
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:13,638
- Junk.
- The junk?

382
00:38:13,848 --> 00:38:17,715
- The junk?
- The lake has junk, Uncle Duffy.

383
00:38:17,935 --> 00:38:21,849
That's right. You're right, Jakey.
It's sad but true.

384
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:27,022
You are the most incredible kidlet,
and you're not even ticklish!

385
00:38:27,236 --> 00:38:28,694
Are you?

386
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:32,486
- Oh, he is!
- I want one.

387
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:35,320
- What?
- I want one of those.

388
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:40,656
I want us to try and have a baby again.

389
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:45,579
- What?
- I know. I'm breaking my word.

390
00:38:45,796 --> 00:38:51,252
I want you to be happy and do exactly
what you want and you are doing that.

391
00:38:51,468 --> 00:38:55,003
I said, "We can wait." But I'm a liar.

392
00:38:55,222 --> 00:38:59,136
I lied. I should be
somebody's press secretary.

393
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:03,560
Whoa, wait a second, Duffy. I can't.

394
00:39:04,898 --> 00:39:09,559
I can't go through all that again
right now. We agreed to wait.

395
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:13,478
How many more years do you think
you can have a child?

396
00:39:13,698 --> 00:39:15,774
OK, we'll do it.

397
00:39:15,992 --> 00:39:19,610
You don't mean that.
You're just saying that.

398
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:22,782
No, I do. I just...

399
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,872
- I don't know.
- Maybe it would work.

400
00:39:28,087 --> 00:39:32,879
- They said it was very possible.
- OK.

401
00:39:33,925 --> 00:39:37,875
- OK, we'll try again.
- You won't hate me for it?

402
00:39:38,096 --> 00:39:41,679
- I'll hate you, but we can try.
- As long as we can try.

403
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:44,264
That's the only thing I care about.

404
00:39:54,404 --> 00:39:57,358
- Your own champagne.
- Oh, my God!

405
00:39:57,574 --> 00:40:01,524
- And your own...
- What? Restaurant?

406
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:05,363
- Sotto Voce.
- My own restaurant! Oh, Ellis!

407
00:40:05,582 --> 00:40:07,539
- Really?
- One condition.

408
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:12,080
- Behave, Ellis.
- No chops, no fries, no apple crisp.

409
00:40:12,296 --> 00:40:15,748
You must stick to the Sotto Voce menu.

410
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:20,171
- It's a deal.
- Bravo.

411
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:24,055
Happy Fourth of July.

412
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:35,773
- Hello?
- Hello? Duff? Hi.

413
00:40:35,986 --> 00:40:38,607
I thought you'd be home by now.

414
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:43,781
Something's come up, honey.
Do you remember Ellis Hayden?

415
00:40:43,994 --> 00:40:47,944
Yes, you do. Ellis is one
of the partners in Sotto Voce.

416
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:50,205
He's editor of Glare Magazine.

417
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:52,873
Go ahead. Ellis Hayden.

418
00:40:53,086 --> 00:40:57,333
Well, anyway,
Ellis is giving me Sotto Voce.

419
00:40:57,549 --> 00:41:01,084
He's making me head chef.
Isn't that unbelievable?

420
00:41:01,303 --> 00:41:05,134
It happened, just like you said.
We're celebrating.

421
00:41:05,348 --> 00:41:09,298
I thought we were celebrating
the birth of the nation

422
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,473
with our own birth thing.

423
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:15,179
Yeah, we were, honey, but...

424
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:20,145
I'm ovulating.
I think my temperature's perfect.

425
00:41:21,322 --> 00:41:23,777
OK, you're right.

426
00:41:25,492 --> 00:41:30,831
I'll just ease my way out of here.
I'll make up some excuse.

427
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:36,164
Wait a minute. You only get
your first restaurant once in your life.

428
00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:39,914
We've got a million nights like this
in our lives.

429
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:42,623
Honey, you'd tell me if it wasn't OK.

430
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:45,002
Sure, sure, it's all right.

431
00:41:45,221 --> 00:41:49,135
- Listen...
- Duffy, I love you.

432
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,675
Well, I like you very much.

433
00:41:51,894 --> 00:41:55,512
- Bye.
- Bye.

434
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:24,884
At 12 o'clock, Claire's bringing lunch.
My kids are going to come...

435
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:28,046
- Hi.
- Good to see you both.

436
00:42:28,262 --> 00:42:31,631
Come on in.
This isn't going to take long.

437
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:36,595
I have some documents for you to sign
that pertain to your mother's estate.

438
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:40,561
Couldn't this have waited
until dinner tomorrow night?

439
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:45,069
I'm sorry, dear,
but I have plans for tomorrow night.

440
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:49,193
- What kind of plans?
- I'm seeing someone.

441
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:51,448
You're seeing someone?

442
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,902
- That's right.
- What about Mom?

443
00:42:54,121 --> 00:42:57,075
Mom's dead.
What kind of question is that?

444
00:42:57,291 --> 00:43:01,419
Show a little patience.
These things are difficult for children.

445
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:05,791
I wouldn't be concerned, Viv.
We're not even serious... yet.

446
00:43:06,007 --> 00:43:11,926
Well, I guess it's all right
if you want to bring your date.

447
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:17,470
I'm sorry, honey,
but we're going away for the weekend.

448
00:43:18,978 --> 00:43:24,138
Going away? Claus von Bülow didn't
work this fast. Who is this woman?

449
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:28,107
Her name is Claire.
She's a recruiter here at the firm.

450
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,153
- Are you seeing anybody else?
- No.

451
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:36,495
- Is that so surprising?
- You've narrowed down to one woman.

452
00:43:36,704 --> 00:43:40,322
I pictured you taking
on the whole League of Women Voters.

453
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:46,662
Kids, I found I don't like living alone.
I'm not used to it.

454
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:50,000
I hate it.
So what would you have me do?

455
00:43:50,217 --> 00:43:53,052
- Hire a maid.
- To sleep with?

456
00:43:56,014 --> 00:44:00,890
You sleep with her?
You mean...? You mean...?

457
00:44:01,103 --> 00:44:06,345
Duffy, I know it's hard for you to accept,
but she makes me happy.

458
00:44:06,566 --> 00:44:10,149
Because you're happy
is a good reason to be content?

459
00:44:10,362 --> 00:44:17,075
Hi. Oh, I'm sorry, Emil.
I didn't realise you were with clients.

460
00:44:18,161 --> 00:44:21,411
- Emil? Emil!
- Oh, come on in.

461
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:26,411
Say hello to Duffy and Vivian.

462
00:44:30,632 --> 00:44:33,383
Kids, this is Claire Raskin.

463
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:35,844
- Hello.
- Hello.

464
00:44:36,054 --> 00:44:42,388
Hi. So, have you two
been married long?

465
00:44:42,602 --> 00:44:45,437
Till the birth of our idiot child.

466
00:44:45,646 --> 00:44:51,601
- Then we were forced to break up.
- But you told me Duffy was married.

467
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:56,481
I did. Duffy is my son.
Vivian is my daughter.

468
00:44:56,699 --> 00:44:58,691
- I'm Duffy.
- I'm Vivian.

469
00:45:00,577 --> 00:45:02,486
So you're not married?

470
00:45:02,704 --> 00:45:06,998
No, they are. Vivian's married to Steve.

471
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:11,289
Duffy is married to Meg.
At least, I think he is.

472
00:45:11,504 --> 00:45:15,205
OK. Now I've got it straight.

473
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:21,004
For a conversation like this,
we could have kept Mom on life support.

474
00:45:27,604 --> 00:45:33,310
It's almost like a curse, you know,
that great review in The Times.

475
00:45:33,526 --> 00:45:36,017
We've been overbooked
every single night.

476
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:39,902
These people are
so unbelievably demanding.

477
00:45:40,116 --> 00:45:43,401
Oh, and did I tell you?
More great news.

478
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:46,573
The maître d' got offered a new job.

479
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:50,739
I shouldn't be taking this week
at the Vineyard.

480
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,420
What do you mean, this week?
I thought it was three weeks.

481
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:59,296
A whole fertile period.
I thought we agreed to try.

482
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:02,878
I can't run a restaurant
without a maître d'.

483
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:06,050
Last month, I thought we agreed to try.

484
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:11,058
- We agreed not to push for a baby.
- I changed my mind. I'm sorry.

485
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:14,390
I didn't know
I was going to have a restaurant.

486
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:18,557
- So we can't have a baby?
- No, I'm not saying that.

487
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:22,063
You said,
"Let's forget about babies for now."

488
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:24,904
You convinced me
to concentrate on my career.

489
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:29,365
- I didn't think it was either/or.
- It's just bad timing.

490
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:32,154
When is it good timing? You tell me!

491
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:36,243
I have a really great idea.
I'll give up the restaurant.

492
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:41,374
- Is that what you think I want?
- Yeah. That's fine. I'll give it up.

493
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:48,881
It's hot in here! Who buys a car
these days without air conditioning?

494
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:54,094
I'm in traffic. You going to buy me
a radiator when this one burns out?

495
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:57,018
- Yes!
- Turn it on.

496
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:06,531
I don't want you to do what I want.
I want you to do what you want.

497
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:10,691
You're acting as if you don't ever
want to have a baby.

498
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:17,116
Oh, God! I can't believe
you could even say that to me.

499
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,660
Didn't I try for three years?

500
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:25,171
Didn't I fail for three years? Do you
have any idea how that makes me feel?

501
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:28,007
Month after month, nothing.

502
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:32,171
When I finally succeed at something,
you want me to drop it.

503
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:37,350
Let's forget about doctors, hormones
and injections. Let's adopt a baby.

504
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:41,857
Sure! When I suggested adopting,
you said, "Absolutely not."

505
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:44,524
Now you want to adopt? Bullshit!

506
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:48,023
I don't want to adopt,
and you're afraid of failure.

507
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:53,198
- We both want a baby, but we can't.
- Didn't you hear what I said?

508
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,532
Let's wait
until a Democrat gets elected.

509
00:47:56,749 --> 00:48:01,707
A baby in a Republican administration
is liable to be a boring dresser.

510
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,796
Let's wait 30 years and make the front
page of The National Enquirer.

511
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,958
Between "Ape gives birth to human"
and "Elvis was really a woman",

512
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:15,722
there'll be "87-year-old father
gives birth to twins"!

513
00:48:18,436 --> 00:48:21,224
I told you! Now I've got no radiator.

514
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,939
Get out of the cab.
Get out of the cab!

515
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:37,784
May you have a child
and may it cause you the same pain

516
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,120
you have visited on to me today!

517
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:45,576
We don't have a child and he's already
caused us pain. Can you believe this?

518
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:49,212
What do you have to do
to take a vacation in this city?

519
00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:54,336
What? What? Oh, God! I'm sorry.
I went too far. That's all.

520
00:48:54,555 --> 00:48:58,849
You know me. I always go too far.
I take it back.

521
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:01,681
Why are we fighting all the time?

522
00:49:01,895 --> 00:49:05,596
Some couples don't communicate.
We're ahead of the game.

523
00:49:05,816 --> 00:49:08,770
Then why are we both so unhappy?

524
00:49:53,779 --> 00:49:57,729
- Why are you giving me that?
- I want you to have it.

525
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:01,900
- I can't make cappuccino.
- You make good cappuccino.

526
00:50:02,121 --> 00:50:05,572
I want you to have it.
I can buy a new one.

527
00:50:11,463 --> 00:50:13,123
Excuse me.

528
00:50:20,806 --> 00:50:23,095
- Hello?
- This is Alyssa Johnson.

529
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:26,262
- I'm calling about your speech...
- Wait!

530
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,267
- Come back for me.
- Sure, Mrs Bergman.

531
00:50:31,483 --> 00:50:36,228
Listen, I'm sort of in the middle
of ending my marriage.

532
00:50:36,446 --> 00:50:40,396
- Can we talk another time?
- I'm sorry. I'll call you back.

533
00:50:40,617 --> 00:50:42,526
Thanks.

534
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:55,122
So this is it? We're getting separated
and I didn't even get to have an affair?

535
00:50:59,343 --> 00:51:02,379
- Maybe you can have one now.
- Thanks.

536
00:51:02,596 --> 00:51:05,882
It's not so much fun
when you get permission.

537
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:11,177
- It violates every rule in the book.
- Please, Duff. Not now.

538
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:17,023
I'll call you.

539
00:52:39,983 --> 00:52:43,601
You're right. Here you go.
What can I get for you?

540
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:47,948
- Could I have some grapes?
- Sure. One second.

541
00:52:48,157 --> 00:52:50,483
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

542
00:53:01,003 --> 00:53:03,375
You do this on all your first dates?

543
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:07,173
You bring a friend
who bums everybody out? Oh, God.

544
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:10,006
Here he comes. I'll see you later.

545
00:53:11,097 --> 00:53:14,217
I should never have
let you talk me into this.

546
00:53:14,434 --> 00:53:17,885
Forget it. You need to get out,
talk to people.

547
00:53:18,104 --> 00:53:20,476
I tried. It just didn't work.

548
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:24,818
- What did you talk about?
- Divorce, infertility, death.

549
00:53:25,027 --> 00:53:29,985
And nobody jumped overboard?
Look, Duff, this is crazy.

550
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:34,148
You've got to start having fun.
You've got to loosen up.

551
00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:36,991
I tell you what, I know this girl.

552
00:53:37,205 --> 00:53:41,666
We'll drive out to the Amish country
this weekend, buy some quilts.

553
00:53:41,877 --> 00:53:44,332
I have to speak at a dumb convention.

554
00:53:44,546 --> 00:53:47,167
- What convention?
- The Delta Gammas.

555
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:51,510
A DG convention?
How many women are going to be there?

556
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:53,676
About 500, I suppose.

557
00:53:53,888 --> 00:53:55,845
- How many men?
- Just me.

558
00:53:56,057 --> 00:53:58,595
That sounds like a really dumb idea.

559
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:03,971
Duff, these are the same girls who
wouldn't even spit on us in college,

560
00:54:04,191 --> 00:54:07,108
the most beautiful girls God created.

561
00:54:28,464 --> 00:54:30,919
Duffy Bergman? No, right?

562
00:54:34,136 --> 00:54:36,175
- Duffy Bergman?
- Daphne, DGs?

563
00:54:36,388 --> 00:54:38,297
- Hop in.
- Good.

564
00:54:38,515 --> 00:54:40,508
- Great.
- I was getting worried.

565
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,102
Look out!

566
00:54:49,526 --> 00:54:53,274
Trust me. I'm from New York.
Sorry to make you wait.

567
00:54:53,488 --> 00:54:57,699
A secretary gave me the wrong time
and I'm about to burst my bladder.

568
00:54:57,909 --> 00:55:01,824
- I don't mind stopping.
- I have to get you there.

569
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:05,621
- I'll drive with my legs crossed.
- I'm curious.

570
00:55:05,834 --> 00:55:10,211
Were you abandoned at birth and
raised by a gang of longshoremen?

571
00:55:10,422 --> 00:55:14,419
You sound like the guy I'd expect
to be writing Duffy's World.

572
00:55:14,634 --> 00:55:17,339
Funny. I happen to be the author.

573
00:55:17,553 --> 00:55:20,803
The fact is you are
single-handedly responsible

574
00:55:21,015 --> 00:55:24,715
for the resurgence of
political humour for my generation.

575
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:30,855
Well, thanks. Give a little credit to
Ronald Reagan and maybe Dan Quayle.

576
00:55:50,794 --> 00:55:53,249
Do you identify with any character?

577
00:55:53,463 --> 00:55:56,748
There's something of me
in all my characters.

578
00:55:56,966 --> 00:56:00,418
I think the best parts are in the women.

579
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:03,721
I meant metaphorically.

580
00:56:21,574 --> 00:56:28,027
Yi, yi, yi. God, who is it?
Daphne, what are you doing here?

581
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:33,205
I was going to slip the schedule
under your door. I saw your light on.

582
00:56:33,419 --> 00:56:37,547
- What are you doing up so late?
- I'm trying to write a speech.

583
00:56:37,756 --> 00:56:42,217
- And you haven't a clue what to say?
- That's a way of putting it.

584
00:56:42,427 --> 00:56:44,087
What's the problem?

585
00:56:44,304 --> 00:56:48,551
They want me to talk about
relationships with women.

586
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:53,512
My history with women is a disaster.
I can't even talk to women.

587
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:56,186
- You're talking to me.
- That's different.

588
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,642
This is talking to a friend.

589
00:56:58,861 --> 00:57:03,321
OK, what about the characters in your
work? You deal with those women.

590
00:57:03,532 --> 00:57:06,651
That's political satire.
I understand that.

591
00:57:06,868 --> 00:57:10,652
I could never relate to women
without messing up,

592
00:57:10,872 --> 00:57:12,829
especially not with the DGs.

593
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:16,659
I always thought of them
as love goddesses.

594
00:57:16,878 --> 00:57:20,163
Well, there you go. They'll love that.

595
00:57:35,312 --> 00:57:38,348
And so they suggested relationships.

596
00:57:38,565 --> 00:57:42,645
I said, "I'm not qualified
to talk about relationships.

597
00:57:42,861 --> 00:57:45,566
"I don't have one any more."

598
00:57:45,781 --> 00:57:50,738
So they suggested mothers.
I said, "I don't have one any more."

599
00:57:50,952 --> 00:57:54,073
I suggested, "What about self-pity?"

600
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:57,746
That's something I understand.

601
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,914
I could get my teeth into that.

602
00:58:05,384 --> 00:58:08,550
Thank you for just being here,

603
00:58:08,762 --> 00:58:13,673
for walking this earth,
for breathing this air.

604
00:58:16,227 --> 00:58:22,348
Because I'm weak, lonely, self-pitying...

605
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:27,353
...in other words, a man.

606
00:58:28,906 --> 00:58:34,991
And I couldn't live without you,
my love goddesses.

607
00:59:10,697 --> 00:59:12,737
Duffy!

608
00:59:36,847 --> 00:59:38,887
Did you get lucky?

609
00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:43,227
Keep your eyes on the road!
What kind of talk is that?

610
00:59:43,437 --> 00:59:48,479
You didn't strike me as a guy
who played the circuit just to get laid.

611
00:59:48,693 --> 00:59:53,438
I'm the kind of guy who wants
to find the right woman, if I can,

612
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,732
and have babies and settle down.

613
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:00,279
Don't get so defensive. I want
to have babies, too. Young, though.

614
01:00:01,955 --> 01:00:04,625
And, what, I'm too old?

615
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:10,871
Not old, but you got
that biological clock ticking, right?

616
01:00:11,089 --> 01:00:16,130
For girls, the older you get,
the more complicated it gets.

617
01:00:16,344 --> 01:00:21,931
- Do you have your life planned out?
- You got to know what you want.

618
01:00:22,141 --> 01:00:25,593
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

619
01:00:28,147 --> 01:00:34,102
Do you want to go to a motel for
an hour or go straight to the airport?

620
01:00:36,822 --> 01:00:41,567
Too late. See?
You got to know what you want.

621
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,118
For you, nice lady,
I got double chocolate cake.

622
01:00:51,337 --> 01:00:54,622
I got lemon pie, cookies, brownies...

623
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,292
OK, I'll have the...
What else have you got?

624
01:00:58,511 --> 01:01:02,722
I got cherry cheesecake,
I got cannolis, apple tartin.

625
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:08,720
Oh, boy.
OK, I'll have the... lemon pie.

626
01:01:08,937 --> 01:01:14,097
I got coffee regular, I got decaf,
I got espresso, I got cappuccino.

627
01:01:16,611 --> 01:01:22,067
He's got cappuccino. I'm just going
to pass on the coffee, thank you.

628
01:01:22,283 --> 01:01:24,905
Do you have herbal tea?

629
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:34,246
Meg, Emil and I talk about you
all the time.

630
01:01:35,629 --> 01:01:38,085
We're worried about you.

631
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,257
Claire, I'm fine.

632
01:01:41,468 --> 01:01:47,590
Really, I'm just having a hard time
making decisions right now,

633
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:49,766
like what tea to drink,

634
01:01:49,977 --> 01:01:55,731
what blouse to wear, what I should
be doing with my life. Small things.

635
01:01:56,984 --> 01:02:01,693
- You mean Duffy?
- Yeah, I guess.

636
01:02:04,575 --> 01:02:08,524
You know, I just think this is so wrong.

637
01:02:08,745 --> 01:02:13,491
I just find it so hard to imagine
you and Duffy not being together.

638
01:02:13,708 --> 01:02:16,626
Well, what's so hard? We're not.

639
01:02:22,926 --> 01:02:25,879
Claire, I'm sorry. It's just...

640
01:02:27,263 --> 01:02:29,220
I miss him.

641
01:02:29,432 --> 01:02:33,892
I love the son of a bitch,
but we stopped talking.

642
01:02:34,103 --> 01:02:39,393
We all know that Duffy is a great talker,
but he wasn't talking to me.

643
01:02:39,608 --> 01:02:43,903
Everything became
about wanting a baby for him.

644
01:02:44,114 --> 01:02:49,737
He was looking at me like I was
some kind of baby machine. Really.

645
01:02:49,952 --> 01:02:53,902
"What's my name?" "Baby."
"What's your name?" "Baby."

646
01:02:54,123 --> 01:02:58,417
"What time is it, what day, what year?"
"Baby, baby, baby."

647
01:02:58,627 --> 01:03:01,118
Jesus! I wanted to punch his face in.

648
01:03:01,338 --> 01:03:04,754
Meg, he loves you.

649
01:03:05,884 --> 01:03:09,134
Yes, well, I like him very much.

650
01:03:09,346 --> 01:03:12,762
No, I mean he really loves you!

651
01:03:15,268 --> 01:03:19,729
God, it sounds so great
when you say it, Claire.

652
01:03:19,939 --> 01:03:25,894
I guess I really needed to hear him
say it, you know, just once,

653
01:03:26,112 --> 01:03:28,733
instead of all that bullshit.

654
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:42,704
- Are you sick?
- Some people think so.

655
01:03:42,921 --> 01:03:46,087
- Are you?
- I've got ringworm.

656
01:03:46,299 --> 01:03:49,253
- See?
- Oh.

657
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:54,218
- What do you have?
- Problems.

658
01:03:56,475 --> 01:04:00,259
- Duffy.
- Bye-bye.

659
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:05,145
Doctor Hugo'll make you all better.

660
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,146
I'll tell you what's wrong. Nothing.

661
01:04:08,362 --> 01:04:13,320
What? I've got a burning inside
my stomach just below my ribs.

662
01:04:13,533 --> 01:04:17,483
I'm listless, I have no appetite,
and you tell me it's nothing!

663
01:04:17,704 --> 01:04:20,990
What kind of a doctor are you?
You'll send me a bill!

664
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:26,332
You lost your mother, your marriage
is a mess. It's understandable.

665
01:04:26,546 --> 01:04:31,753
- Hugo, I want a baby.
- Take one of my patients.

666
01:04:32,552 --> 01:04:34,878
You understand, Hugo,

667
01:04:35,097 --> 01:04:41,894
that I'm a little bit scared
that I'm never going to have a child?

668
01:04:44,439 --> 01:04:48,389
Talk to Meg.
Maybe now some time has gone by...

669
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:50,567
Talk to her.

670
01:04:55,783 --> 01:04:58,404
Sotto Voce, this is Kathryn.

671
01:05:02,581 --> 01:05:04,538
One moment, please.

672
01:05:05,918 --> 01:05:08,539
Meg, it's Duffy for you.

673
01:05:14,259 --> 01:05:15,919
- Duffy?
- Hi.

674
01:05:16,136 --> 01:05:18,674
Hi. Where are you?

675
01:05:19,473 --> 01:05:21,512
I'm at home. Can you talk?

676
01:05:21,725 --> 01:05:24,642
Well, I'm in the middle of something.

677
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:29,388
Listen, I've been doing some thinking.

678
01:05:29,607 --> 01:05:32,894
I just got back from a trip.

679
01:05:35,614 --> 01:05:40,572
I was just wondering if we could
get together and have some dinner

680
01:05:40,786 --> 01:05:46,372
and maybe, you know,
I know it sounds silly, have a date.

681
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:51,077
Look, this isn't a good time
for me right now.

682
01:05:51,296 --> 01:05:57,630
Well, also I was thinking that maybe
we've been separated long enough.

683
01:05:57,844 --> 01:06:02,719
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe we should think about adoption.

684
01:06:04,558 --> 01:06:07,180
Sure, yeah, that sounds great, Duff.

685
01:06:07,394 --> 01:06:09,850
This is really a bad time for me.

686
01:06:11,565 --> 01:06:14,317
- What is this?
- What's what?

687
01:06:14,526 --> 01:06:18,109
Did you have to hire
America's biggest divorce lawyer?

688
01:06:18,321 --> 01:06:22,449
Couldn't you get some hit men
to shoot me outside a steak joint?

689
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:25,280
Marcus is doing it as a favour.

690
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:29,113
Not to me. The whole thing
could have been so simple.

691
01:06:29,332 --> 01:06:32,784
We get a book on divorce
and do it ourselves.

692
01:06:33,003 --> 01:06:37,464
- It's not that simple, Duffy.
- I am. You got more complicated.

693
01:06:37,674 --> 01:06:40,130
- I did?
- What about Glare Magazine?

694
01:06:40,344 --> 01:06:45,136
Designer lettuce! Franchises! What
happened to the great American chef?

695
01:06:45,348 --> 01:06:49,346
Meggie, Al Costello is here
to show us the new pasta maker.

696
01:06:49,561 --> 01:06:51,886
- Just a second.
- Unfair!

697
01:06:52,105 --> 01:06:54,726
- Why?
- You could have given me a warning!

698
01:06:54,941 --> 01:06:58,025
Is this making it all too real for you?

699
01:06:58,236 --> 01:07:02,364
We had a real marriage and
we're getting a real divorce. It's over.

700
01:07:02,573 --> 01:07:05,907
- Over?
- I am the ship and I have sailed.

701
01:07:06,118 --> 01:07:09,202
- Where to?
- Let the lawyers take care of it.

702
01:07:09,413 --> 01:07:12,580
Lawyer, singular,
because I'm not getting one.

703
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:15,911
I'm going to do your lawyer a favour.

704
01:07:16,128 --> 01:07:19,876
- What are you doing?
- He's going to get it all anyway.

705
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:22,047
Take something on account.

706
01:07:22,259 --> 01:07:27,217
By the way, congratulations on
the name of your restaurant. Sotto Voce!

707
01:07:27,431 --> 01:07:31,892
It's a great name. All of this purple
is good for the appetite.

708
01:07:46,741 --> 01:07:48,698
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

709
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:52,244
- Ready on four.
- Do you enjoy offending people?

710
01:07:52,455 --> 01:07:54,780
Do you enjoy acid rain?

711
01:07:55,917 --> 01:08:01,042
- I take it your answer is yes.
- I take it your answer is no.

712
01:08:01,255 --> 01:08:07,258
Duffy Bergman of Duffy's World.
Stay with us and we'll be right back.

713
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:11,921
- What a kidder.
- Really. See you.

714
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:19,521
- Duffy? Hi.
- What are you doing here?

715
01:08:19,731 --> 01:08:23,681
- I work here.
- Great. How's it going?

716
01:08:23,902 --> 01:08:28,197
Not bad. Actually, good.
They want to promote me, I think.

717
01:08:28,407 --> 01:08:30,364
- Against your will?
- No.

718
01:08:30,576 --> 01:08:34,870
Well, sort of. It means moving
to Los Angeles. I'm a New Yorker.

719
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:39,030
I need to maintain a level
of aggression or I destabilise.

720
01:08:39,251 --> 01:08:42,869
So, how's the rest of your life?

721
01:08:43,088 --> 01:08:46,042
There isn't any rest of my life
any more.

722
01:08:46,258 --> 01:08:48,713
Really? Shame!

723
01:08:48,927 --> 01:08:53,387
- Daph, are you ready to go?
- Yeah, I'm coming.

724
01:08:53,598 --> 01:08:56,552
How about I buy you dinner some time?

725
01:09:00,104 --> 01:09:03,307
How's tomorrow night?
Is that too soon?

726
01:09:03,524 --> 01:09:06,229
I have this Girl Scout meeting...

727
01:09:07,528 --> 01:09:11,988
I'm just kidding.
I think I can cancel it. OK.

728
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:16,113
- Good night.
- Tomorrow.

729
01:09:16,328 --> 01:09:18,819
- All right.
- Bye.

730
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:26,666
So, anyway, the day after I was born,
my dad gets his credentials

731
01:09:26,881 --> 01:09:30,166
to cover the war
for some radical weekly,

732
01:09:30,384 --> 01:09:33,338
and he doesn't even want to go.

733
01:09:33,554 --> 01:09:38,132
But my mom pushes him. You know,
the free press saving the world.

734
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:40,639
Whoa, hold on!

735
01:09:41,562 --> 01:09:45,180
His first night in Vietnam,
he gets blown to pieces.

736
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:50,689
- That's awful.
- Yeah... It was his own fault.

737
01:09:50,904 --> 01:09:55,862
- He lit a joint near an ammo dump.
- Good evening, Mr Bergman.

738
01:09:59,912 --> 01:10:03,198
She seemed to have nice tits, that girl.

739
01:10:07,086 --> 01:10:09,707
- Really?
- Like you didn't notice?

740
01:10:09,922 --> 01:10:12,876
You were staring at her tits.

741
01:10:13,092 --> 01:10:17,255
I was not. What are you talking about?

742
01:10:17,471 --> 01:10:24,221
- Right. What are you? A tit man?
- What kind of a question is that?

743
01:10:24,437 --> 01:10:28,386
I'm interested in what
gets you excited. Is it tits?

744
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:34,903
You seemed interested in her tits,
which I don't think were hers.

745
01:10:35,114 --> 01:10:39,194
- Yes, they were.
- So you are a tit man.

746
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:42,743
I'm not. I'm interested
in the whole person.

747
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,117
So these don't excite you?

748
01:10:48,335 --> 01:10:51,917
Hey, hey, hey! Good night, Fred.

749
01:10:53,298 --> 01:10:55,255
Good night, Mr Bergman.

750
01:11:13,275 --> 01:11:16,525
So you are interested
in the whole person!

751
01:11:19,282 --> 01:11:21,690
In case they want me in the Raiders.

752
01:11:36,298 --> 01:11:38,421
No, no! Oh, no!

753
01:11:58,653 --> 01:12:01,523
Doctor! Doctor!

754
01:12:22,427 --> 01:12:26,175
Take this! Take this thing!

755
01:12:52,622 --> 01:12:56,572
- No more. I can't. I'm too old.
- No, no, no.

756
01:12:56,793 --> 01:13:00,244
Help an old man go to bed.
Did you get me the milk?

757
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:05,291
I want a little milk
before I go to bed. No! Please!

758
01:13:27,949 --> 01:13:31,993
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Isn't that cute?

759
01:13:34,246 --> 01:13:38,196
- Verdi drives her crazy.
- With me, it's Madonna.

760
01:13:38,417 --> 01:13:42,545
Hey, what a coincidence.
They're both Italians.

761
01:13:44,131 --> 01:13:46,289
I don't know if you know this,

762
01:13:46,508 --> 01:13:50,755
but Emil and I came here
on our first date.

763
01:13:51,805 --> 01:13:54,510
This place is very special to us.

764
01:13:54,724 --> 01:13:58,010
We wanted to come here tonight
with you to...

765
01:13:58,228 --> 01:14:00,600
Speed it up.

766
01:14:00,814 --> 01:14:04,147
Claire, I'm trying
to break it to him gently.

767
01:14:04,359 --> 01:14:08,902
- Break what, Daddy?
- Oh, hell, we're getting married.

768
01:14:12,075 --> 01:14:14,993
Shotgun? You have to get married?

769
01:14:18,832 --> 01:14:23,125
I'd say a toast was in order.
Duffy?

770
01:14:26,798 --> 01:14:28,340
OK.

771
01:14:28,549 --> 01:14:37,470
Here's to Emil Thomas Bergman,
better known as my dad,

772
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:41,467
and... l'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name.

773
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:44,641
Joke. Just a joke.

774
01:14:44,857 --> 01:14:46,315
Joke, joke.

775
01:14:49,111 --> 01:14:52,776
Here's to my dad and Claire.

776
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:56,740
Bon voyage.

777
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:25,183
What do you have against Claire?

778
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:29,857
I don't have anything against her.
My dad could have done better.

779
01:15:30,068 --> 01:15:33,021
Well, I don't know, I like her.

780
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:37,068
You and Meg. Meg liked her, too.

781
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:41,864
It sounds like I would've liked Meg.

782
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,036
You would have.

783
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:49,538
You never told me why you broke up.

784
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:54,498
That's a long, and I don't know
if it's so interesting, story.

785
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:56,709
Then make it interesting.

786
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:01,466
First, Meg wanted to have a baby.

787
01:16:01,681 --> 01:16:06,225
We couldn't do it. We tried everything,
but it didn't work out.

788
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:11,229
Then my mother died. All of a sudden,
I wanted to have a baby.

789
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:14,561
Not that we could have
had one then either,

790
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:18,063
but all I could think about
was having a baby.

791
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:20,737
That's when we broke up.

792
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:28,695
I didn't realise
what was really important then.

793
01:16:37,591 --> 01:16:39,383
Ugh, who made this?

794
01:16:39,593 --> 01:16:43,045
- Did you make this?
- Rod the houseboy made it.

795
01:16:43,264 --> 01:16:46,798
- What's the matter with it?
- It's so strong.

796
01:16:47,017 --> 01:16:52,557
And you forgot the cinnamon. Good
cappuccino has a chocolatey flavour.

797
01:16:53,607 --> 01:16:55,398
Chocolatey?

798
01:16:55,609 --> 01:16:59,191
Yeah. I don't know
how you can drink this shit.

799
01:17:02,867 --> 01:17:07,908
Did you brush your teeth and say
your prayers yet? Go upstairs and do it.

800
01:17:55,459 --> 01:17:59,753
- How did you get these seats?
- I humped a couple of affiliates.

801
01:17:59,964 --> 01:18:02,965
- It was worth it. What a birthday!
- There's more.

802
01:18:03,175 --> 01:18:06,675
The Knicks and Madison Square
Garden thank you for attending.

803
01:18:16,855 --> 01:18:18,563
Duffy!

804
01:18:19,858 --> 01:18:21,897
I'm going upstate now.

805
01:18:23,695 --> 01:18:26,364
- Daphne, are you looking for me?
- Yeah.

806
01:18:26,573 --> 01:18:29,408
- Great game!
- Thank you.

807
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:32,404
- Meet my friend, Duffy Bergman.
- Hi.

808
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:38,124
How do you do? This is the best
birthday present I could imagine.

809
01:18:38,334 --> 01:18:43,328
- One more surprise to go. Patrick?
- Daphne's pregnant.

810
01:18:45,382 --> 01:18:48,004
You're kidding. This is incredible!

811
01:18:48,218 --> 01:18:51,670
I didn't even know
you were seeing each other!

812
01:18:51,889 --> 01:18:55,008
- It's yours, dummy.
- Even better!

813
01:18:58,563 --> 01:19:02,560
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

814
01:19:02,775 --> 01:19:04,150
I owe you one.

815
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:10,196
I've been thinking.

816
01:19:10,407 --> 01:19:12,364
When this one's born,

817
01:19:12,576 --> 01:19:15,862
and I think it's a girl,
who we should name Lilith,

818
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:19,199
which I saw in Delta Of Venus
by Anaïs Nin.

819
01:19:19,416 --> 01:19:21,871
We should have another one right away,

820
01:19:22,085 --> 01:19:26,747
get through the nursery phase
of our lives and into the good stuff.

821
01:19:26,965 --> 01:19:32,207
Maybe I should take that job in LA.
It's a great place to raise kids.

822
01:19:32,428 --> 01:19:36,640
That means private schools.
The public school system there sucks.

823
01:19:36,849 --> 01:19:40,929
That means Hollywood for you,
but how terrible could that be?

824
01:19:41,145 --> 01:19:45,059
It's great money,
and how badly could they treat you?

825
01:19:45,274 --> 01:19:48,559
Anyway,
you could do the strip anywhere.

826
01:19:49,737 --> 01:19:54,862
All of which is just a prelude
to the ranch near Jackson Hole,

827
01:19:55,076 --> 01:20:00,532
where we can all just kick back
and watch the leaves turn

828
01:20:00,748 --> 01:20:03,702
and watch the snow fall.

829
01:20:03,918 --> 01:20:07,702
You can write another musical,
and I can...

830
01:20:10,925 --> 01:20:14,376
- What can I do?
- Make plans.

831
01:20:22,269 --> 01:20:25,554
- Good.
- Let's swing it around first.

832
01:20:29,109 --> 01:20:31,066
Keep it coming.

833
01:20:44,957 --> 01:20:48,124
All right, we can take it up.

834
01:20:53,633 --> 01:20:55,756
Duffy, there's a problem.

835
01:20:55,969 --> 01:20:59,254
- Hold it, Charlie.
- Something's wrong.

836
01:20:59,472 --> 01:21:03,339
Don't worry.
We're going to take care of it.

837
01:21:03,559 --> 01:21:05,516
Don't get scared.

838
01:21:05,728 --> 01:21:11,351
Don't get scared. I'm going to make it
all go away. Don't you worry.

839
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:13,524
Don't cry.

840
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:28,372
- Is she OK?
- She's fine. No complications.

841
01:21:31,252 --> 01:21:34,704
It just wasn't meant to be
this time around.

842
01:21:44,473 --> 01:21:45,932
Thanks.

843
01:22:19,424 --> 01:22:20,883
Hi.

844
01:22:31,936 --> 01:22:33,894
Where are you going?

845
01:22:34,105 --> 01:22:39,561
- LA. I'm taking the job out there.
- You're taking the job in LA?

846
01:22:39,777 --> 01:22:42,233
- Yeah.
- I'll go with you.

847
01:22:43,781 --> 01:22:47,945
- You'll move to LA?
- Sure. Get a house in Hollywood.

848
01:22:48,161 --> 01:22:51,328
I'll buy a jeep for all the snow.

849
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:54,291
- We can watch the seasons changing.
- Sit down.

850
01:22:54,501 --> 01:22:56,540
What's going on?

851
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:03,922
Let's face it. The baby just happened.

852
01:23:04,135 --> 01:23:07,835
We didn't mean for it to happen.

853
01:23:08,055 --> 01:23:13,678
It made everything more serious
than either of us ever intended.

854
01:23:13,894 --> 01:23:17,180
We were both
doing the honourable thing.

855
01:23:17,398 --> 01:23:20,185
You think I was doing
the honourable thing?

856
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,650
Then why else are you with me?

857
01:23:25,405 --> 01:23:30,032
Well, because I think
that... you're great.

858
01:23:33,246 --> 01:23:37,244
I think that I have
an awful lot of fun with you.

859
01:23:38,418 --> 01:23:43,377
And... the sex is something...

860
01:23:45,092 --> 01:23:49,136
...a little out of the ordinary,
and extraordinary.

861
01:23:49,346 --> 01:23:51,303
I take partial credit for that,

862
01:23:51,515 --> 01:23:55,464
but you get points for
embarrassing moments in elevators

863
01:23:55,685 --> 01:23:58,639
and regularity.

864
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:07,320
And I think that you're
a very exciting woman.

865
01:24:08,698 --> 01:24:12,612
Girl. Wo... Girl.

866
01:24:12,827 --> 01:24:18,746
In spite of all this craziness that
you put out, you're very centred.

867
01:24:18,957 --> 01:24:21,033
We like doing the same things.

868
01:24:23,879 --> 01:24:27,461
What's going...? Hey, hey!
Are you crying?

869
01:24:27,674 --> 01:24:32,003
Come here. No, no. Come on.
What are you crying about?

870
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:37,012
Was it something I said?
Tell me what it is. I'll take it back.

871
01:24:37,225 --> 01:24:41,176
- I'll take it right back.
- I'm too much fun, aren't I?

872
01:24:41,397 --> 01:24:46,853
You're not. No, you're
the perfect amount of fun for me.

873
01:24:47,069 --> 01:24:53,023
It was all good times. I never hurt you.
You never had to worry about me.

874
01:24:53,241 --> 01:24:57,618
I don't know what you're saying.
You weren't neurotic.

875
01:24:57,829 --> 01:25:00,783
You never had to take me seriously.

876
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:06,329
I always take you seriously. I do.

877
01:25:08,881 --> 01:25:11,882
You have to know I'm crazy about you.

878
01:25:15,054 --> 01:25:21,388
Then why, Duffy, when I asked you
why you were coming with me,

879
01:25:21,602 --> 01:25:25,730
why didn't you say,
"Because I love you"?

880
01:25:46,502 --> 01:25:49,075
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

881
01:25:50,422 --> 01:25:54,372
- Excuse me just one moment, please.
- Sure.

882
01:25:54,593 --> 01:25:58,886
Sir? Excuse me. Excuse me.

883
01:25:59,097 --> 01:26:01,552
Sir! Excuse me.

884
01:26:02,517 --> 01:26:06,466
- Sir, can I help you?
- I'm going to see Meg for a minute.

885
01:26:06,688 --> 01:26:11,314
- Meg who? Excuse me.
- Meg the chef.

886
01:26:11,525 --> 01:26:16,650
Sir, our chef is Antonio Lucchesi.
I'm sorry. There's no Meg here.

887
01:26:16,864 --> 01:26:19,485
- What happened to Meg?
- I don't know.

888
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:24,161
But whatever happened to her,
it didn't happen here. Now, please.

889
01:26:24,371 --> 01:26:26,827
Grazie. Buonasera.

890
01:26:27,874 --> 01:26:29,701
Thank you.

891
01:26:41,889 --> 01:26:44,344
- That was great.
- Perfect.

892
01:26:44,558 --> 01:26:48,009
- I think we have just enough time.
- We'll make it.

893
01:26:54,192 --> 01:26:55,936
Excellent.

894
01:27:10,374 --> 01:27:11,999
Mazel tov!

895
01:27:21,385 --> 01:27:23,543
Are you all right, Duff?

896
01:27:49,204 --> 01:27:52,787
- This is great. It's terrific.
- It's lovely.

897
01:27:54,084 --> 01:27:56,041
Excuse me.

898
01:27:57,921 --> 01:27:59,878
- It is you!
- Hi, Duff.

899
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:04,467
You know, I wasn't sure.
I couldn't tell from the back.

900
01:28:04,677 --> 01:28:06,634
Look at you! My gosh!

901
01:28:06,846 --> 01:28:11,307
You look... whoo!
You look rather great.

902
01:28:11,517 --> 01:28:15,467
- Thanks. So do you.
- Oh, well, you know.

903
01:28:15,688 --> 01:28:20,065
Dad didn't say anything. I didn't
know you were going to be here.

904
01:28:20,276 --> 01:28:24,225
Neither did I. I thought
I was going to be at the restaurant.

905
01:28:24,446 --> 01:28:28,396
- But you're not there any more.
- Right.

906
01:28:28,617 --> 01:28:32,117
- How did you know?
- Somebody told me.

907
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:38,417
Yeah, well, anyway. I opened
my own place on Thompson Street.

908
01:28:38,628 --> 01:28:42,495
Your own place? Nobody told me that.
What's it called?

909
01:28:42,715 --> 01:28:45,502
- Meg's.
- Meg's?

910
01:28:45,718 --> 01:28:50,510
What an original name!
How did you get a name like that?

911
01:28:50,722 --> 01:28:55,515
- Out of the phone book.
- Oh, gosh. Congratulations.

912
01:28:55,727 --> 01:28:59,392
That's wonderful.
You got what you really wanted.

913
01:29:00,565 --> 01:29:03,483
Yeah. I guess so.

914
01:29:04,986 --> 01:29:11,439
- And they let you make apple crisp?
- No. I let me make apple crisp.

915
01:29:11,659 --> 01:29:14,530
Yeah, well. Sorry. I didn't mean...

916
01:29:14,745 --> 01:29:17,865
- What's going on here?
- Congratulations!

917
01:29:18,082 --> 01:29:21,533
- I'm so glad you could make it.
- Good to see you.

918
01:29:21,752 --> 01:29:25,203
- Thanks for coming.
- You didn't tell me she was coming.

919
01:29:25,422 --> 01:29:28,543
This is your request.
We'll be right back.

920
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,717
- Go on, Pops.
- Yeah.

921
01:29:34,182 --> 01:29:36,554
It's going to work!

922
01:29:36,767 --> 01:29:40,717
You know the old saying.
You can lead a horse to water...

923
01:29:40,938 --> 01:29:42,895
Bet you a dollar.

924
01:29:44,358 --> 01:29:46,315
You're on.

925
01:29:47,778 --> 01:29:49,735
I think that...

926
01:29:50,864 --> 01:29:54,316
- I think I should get going.
- You just got here!

927
01:29:54,534 --> 01:29:59,659
I know, but there's this person
waiting for me at the restaurant.

928
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:06,332
- Oh, oh, sorry.
- No, no, no. It's...

929
01:30:07,422 --> 01:30:10,791
Why don't I explain it
to you another time?

930
01:30:11,009 --> 01:30:15,172
Sure, sure. That's all right.
You go on, have a good time.

931
01:30:15,388 --> 01:30:18,009
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

932
01:30:18,224 --> 01:30:20,928
I always loved
your Jimmy Stewart impression.

933
01:30:21,143 --> 01:30:23,052
My Jimmy Stewart.

934
01:30:25,065 --> 01:30:28,184
- Thanks.
- Well...

935
01:30:35,116 --> 01:30:41,119
Maybe we'll see each other some time
if I come around Thompson Street.

936
01:30:42,498 --> 01:30:45,203
Yeah, that sounds great.

937
01:30:47,044 --> 01:30:48,455
I'll see you.

938
01:30:58,055 --> 01:31:00,261
You owe me a dollar.

939
01:31:12,402 --> 01:31:16,316
Gosh, look at all the cake
that people didn't eat.

940
01:31:16,531 --> 01:31:18,570
Did you taste it?

941
01:31:19,283 --> 01:31:22,404
- It's awfully cinnamony.
- Yeah.

942
01:31:23,872 --> 01:31:27,455
Who cares?
I had a great time.

943
01:31:29,919 --> 01:31:36,123
You know something? I haven't been
very supportive of this whole thing.

944
01:31:36,342 --> 01:31:38,382
What do you mean?

945
01:31:42,306 --> 01:31:45,640
I mean I've acted
pretty much like a jerk.

946
01:31:46,352 --> 01:31:47,680
Yeah.

947
01:31:51,607 --> 01:31:55,272
- You've made Dad so happy.
- He deserves it.

948
01:31:56,945 --> 01:32:01,572
I just want to tell you that I'm sorry.
I really am.

949
01:32:01,783 --> 01:32:03,776
I want to tell you that.

950
01:32:06,204 --> 01:32:12,159
And that... I think he's awfully lucky
to have found you.

951
01:32:12,377 --> 01:32:14,832
I hope he doesn't let you get away.

952
01:32:24,848 --> 01:32:27,006
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

953
01:32:29,561 --> 01:32:33,772
- This was really some wedding.
- This is the last time.

954
01:32:33,982 --> 01:32:35,939
I promise you that.

955
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:40,978
You know, I thought it was
a very nice gesture, your inviting Meg.

956
01:32:42,406 --> 01:32:46,356
Well, I'd like to take
the credit for that, but...

957
01:32:46,577 --> 01:32:49,862
I ran into her at Union Square Market.

958
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,532
She asked if you were definitely
going to be here.

959
01:32:53,751 --> 01:32:57,700
I said, "Of course."
Then she asked if she could come.

960
01:32:57,921 --> 01:33:01,753
So I guess you could say
that she invited herself!

961
01:33:01,967 --> 01:33:07,174
- She came to see me?
- Well, she didn't come for the cake.

962
01:33:10,558 --> 01:33:12,598
Would you excuse me?

963
01:33:23,655 --> 01:33:25,695
Taxi!

964
01:33:29,536 --> 01:33:32,987
- Stop, I'll get out here.
- OK. Hey, thanks!

965
01:34:10,867 --> 01:34:16,075
- The food here is really good.
- Good, it should be.

966
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:17,618
Yes, I know.

967
01:34:18,542 --> 01:34:22,290
- Good.
- Really, it's wonderful.

968
01:34:22,504 --> 01:34:24,544
Thanks.

969
01:34:26,383 --> 01:34:30,677
- Oh, hi.
- I want to be with you.

970
01:34:32,555 --> 01:34:35,841
- What?
- I want to live with you again.

971
01:34:36,893 --> 01:34:38,720
I see.

972
01:34:42,398 --> 01:34:45,684
Meg, honey, I love you.

973
01:34:45,902 --> 01:34:47,859
I've always loved you.

974
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:52,198
I've never loved anyone else,
and I think that you still love me.

975
01:34:52,408 --> 01:34:55,195
- Excuse me.
- If you don't, then say so.

976
01:34:55,411 --> 01:34:59,539
If you don't love me,
tell me and I'll get out of the way.

977
01:34:59,748 --> 01:35:02,286
- Get out of the way!
- That's for her to say.

978
01:35:02,501 --> 01:35:04,826
- Excuse me.
- Meg!

979
01:35:06,838 --> 01:35:10,172
Meg, this is the last time, I promise.

980
01:35:10,383 --> 01:35:14,382
- I know I shouldn't have pushed you.
- I've got work to do.

981
01:35:14,597 --> 01:35:17,218
I know I should never have let you go.

982
01:35:17,433 --> 01:35:21,726
I know I should have said this
at the wedding. I know my timing stinks.

983
01:35:21,937 --> 01:35:26,231
Look at all the stuff I know!
That's got to be worth something.

984
01:35:26,441 --> 01:35:32,314
There's another thing I know.
I know I don't need a baby any more.

985
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:34,488
But I need you.

986
01:35:34,699 --> 01:35:37,155
I just want you.

987
01:35:38,536 --> 01:35:40,992
We belong together.

988
01:35:43,708 --> 01:35:45,996
- I know.
- You know?

989
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:48,167
Yeah, I know.

990
01:35:55,135 --> 01:35:57,211
Gosh, I'm sorry.

991
01:35:57,429 --> 01:36:00,715
- I have to go back to work.
- Wait a minute!

992
01:36:03,518 --> 01:36:06,934
- What is this?
- I adopted him.

993
01:36:14,864 --> 01:36:16,821
You mean...

994
01:36:17,032 --> 01:36:21,659
You mean this could be my son?

995
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:28,240
I don't know. That's up to him.
I'll see you.

996
01:36:33,381 --> 01:36:36,382
Where's Mommy?

997
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:47,351
Excuse me. Folks, this is my family.

998
01:36:54,068 --> 01:36:57,733
You're my favourite person
in the whole world.

999
01:36:59,573 --> 01:37:01,530
You get one, too.

1000
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:07,289
I don't know how good
we're going to be at raising a child.

1001
01:37:07,498 --> 01:37:12,041
What are you worried about?
Look how well you did with me!

1002
01:37:12,253 --> 01:37:13,961
That's true.

1003
01:37:14,171 --> 01:37:17,256
I can see the judges' eyes

1004
01:37:17,466 --> 01:37:21,215
As they handed you the prize

1005
01:37:21,428 --> 01:37:27,549
I bet you made the cutest bow

1006
01:37:27,768 --> 01:37:35,182
Oh! You must have been
a beautiful baby

1007
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:41,853
'Cause, baby, look at you now
