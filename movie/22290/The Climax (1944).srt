1
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,591


2
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,617
Good evening, Doctor.

3
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,322
Doctor?
Yes.

4
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,630
Dr. Hohner.
The theater physician.

5
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:20,366
He lives just around the corner. What's
he doin' around here this time of night?

6
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,137
Uh, somebody sick?
Yes. He is.

7
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,003
Marcellina.
Marcellina.

8
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,743
Oh, yes.

9
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,843
Uh, did the police ever find her?
No.

10
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,979
After 10 years,
they've given up trying.

11
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,227
Marcellina, it has come.
At last, it has come.

12
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,133
What, Luise?
I couldn't wait. I opened it.

13
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,661
The king invites you—
no, commands you to sing for him.

14
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,374
Luise, I'm going to faint.
Not now, my sweet.

15
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,173
After you sing for the king,
you can faint all you like.

16
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,374
Will you find the maestro?
I want him to hear the good news.

17
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,179
This is the biggest
moment of my life.

18
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,489
#Ah, we bid you welcome
to this fete #

19
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,925
#Ah, we're sorry if we made you wait #

20
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,532
#Ah, let violins begin the dance #

21
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,969
#Ah, let there be joy
and gay romancing #

22
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,899
#Ah, tell me why this doubt #

23
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:45,273
# Should fall to me #

24
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:51,215
#Whose tragic power
seems to call to me ##

25
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,816
Friedrich, I asked you never
to come here again.

26
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:59,585
I had to see you.
Well, I don't want to see you.

27
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,355
I thought you understood that.
But I love you, Marcellina.

28
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:07,525
No, Friedrich. You love your
own private, selfish world.

29
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,228
You want to lock me up
there with you,

30
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,237
give up my career.

31
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,273
That's what you've got to do.

32
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,037
I can't bear the thought that
any man can hear you sing for him,

33
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,045
feast his eyes on you...

34
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,047
just for the price of a ticket.

35
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,709
I worked hard for my success,
Friedrich.

36
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,844
Tonight, there were 11
solo curtain calls.

37
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,048
More than any other singer's
ever had in this theater.

38
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,922
The king commands me
to sing for him.

39
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:37,394
Why, I'd be a fool to give that
up for you. Darling, listen to me.

40
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:41,160
No, Friedrich. I've listened to you
for the last time. Now please go.

41
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,737
This isn't really you speaking,
Marcellina.

42
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:49,605
You've forgotten how happy
we've been and will be again.

43
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:53,975
Now let me hear you say
once more, just as you used to,

44
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,105
"I love you, Friedrich. "

45
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,311
I can't say it...
because I don't love you.

46
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,254
I hate you.

47
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,087
I don't hate you.

48
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:12,757
I only hate the thing
that's come between us—your voice.

49
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,124
Yes, I know.

50
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,296
You were out front tonight.

51
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,440
I felt your eyes on me.

52
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,170
<i>Like you're looking at me now.</i>

53
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,178
<i>Go away.</i>

54
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,237
Get out of here!

55
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,474
I'm afraid of you.

56
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,884
You needn't be.

57
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,359
I love you, my darling.
You know that.

58
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,791
I'd give my life for you.

59
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,699
This thing that shuts me out—
I won't let it.

60
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,066
I tell you I won't let it.

61
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,868
It's here,

62
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,932
now, between my fingers.

63
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,141
I've only to close them
to silence it forever.

64
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,547
Friedrich, you're hurting me.

65
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,376
<i>Friedrich, you're—</i>

66
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,127
We'll always be together now.

67
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,197
Your voice will never
come between us again.

68
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,601
<i>Marcellina.</i>

69
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,125
Dr. Hohner,
are you all right?

70
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,028
Yes. Yes.

71
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,626
I'm all right.

72
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,110
Good morning, Count Seebruck.

73
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,169
Good morning.

74
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,946
Good morning, Count
Seebruck. Good morning.

75
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,785
Good morning, Count
Seebruck. Good morning.

76
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,348
Good morning. Good morning, Jean.
Good morning, Count Seebruck.

77
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,624
What a lovely morning.
The air is like wine.

78
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,963
Chestnut trees are in bloom.
All nature is in harmony.

79
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:08,935
Well, even our friends the critics
have been kind to us this morning.

80
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:13,172
Oh, it's good to be alive.

81
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,305
Everything is serene, peaceful, quiet.

82
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,249
<i>- I have never been
so insulted in all my life.!</i>

83
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,252
I positively will not stand for it.

84
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,051
I am the prima donna of the Royal Theatre,
not a barmaid in a cheap beer hall.

85
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,718
And I won't be insulted by—
I was not insulting you.

86
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,455
<i>I was merely trying to show you—
You show me.</i>

87
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,557
<i>Why, the insolence.! Now, children,
children. Please. Please. What's wrong?</i>

88
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,661
Stop it! Stop it!

89
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,298
Now, you, Brunn. What
is it? And stop bobbing.

90
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,501
Yes, madame.

91
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,669
Uh, Count Seebruck, if you please.

92
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,976
We were just rehearsing the duet between
MadameJarmila and Signor Roselli...

93
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,484
<i>when for no apparent reason,
MadameJarmila— For no apparent reason?</i>

94
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,783
Why, this—This creature here was
handling me like a pan of unbaked dough.

95
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,417
I was not. I merely
put my arm around your waist.

96
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:05,157
- Carl, you were in the prompter's box. You saw it all.
- I'm sorry.

97
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,029
You know how it goes,
Count Seebruck.

98
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,796
# I love you
La-la-la-la, la-la-la #

99
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,838
Will you take your hands
off my stomach!

100
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:17,069
Perhaps you'd rather I didn't touch you
at all. Nothing would please me better.

101
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,772
For 20 years, the baritone embraces the
prima donna at that particular moment.

102
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,873
- Now she's trying to tell—
- I defy anyone to sing in one of your deathlike grips.

103
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,216
<i>My dear, if you are unable to sing,
I refuse to take the blame.</i>

104
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,621
Unable to sing? Just what
do you mean by that insult?

105
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,990
Oh, stop it. Stop it.

106
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,894
Roselli, you're as temperamental
as a prima donna.

107
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,626
And as for you, Jarmila, I'm getting a
little bit tired of your constant bickering.

108
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,896
So am I, Count Seebruck.

109
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:48,702
And if you, as the impresario of this
theater, don't do something about it, I shall.

110
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,867
All right.

111
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,673
Is madame's understudy ready?
Yes, Count Seebruck.

112
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,907
Miss Metzger, please.

113
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,449
<i>Miss Metzger.
Yes, Count Seebruck.</i>

114
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,648
Come in, my dear.

115
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,724
- Do you know the soprano role?
- Oh, yes, sir.

116
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,286
You shall sing it tonight
in MadameJarmila's stead.

117
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,559
Tonight? Oh!

118
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,029
Oh.

119
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:27,607
If some composer would only write me an operetta
without any women, I'd make him immortal.

120
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:33,183
<i>Count Seebruck.! Count Seebruck.!
Count Seebruck.! Well, what is it?</i>

121
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,346
There's a— There's a— Well?

122
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,913
There's a dead man
in one of the dressing rooms.

123
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,084
A dead man?
In which room?

124
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,151
T- Twenty-two.

125
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,765
But, Jarmila, darling.

126
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,211
Oh, it's you, Dr. Hohner.

127
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,282
I must have fallen asleep.

128
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,618
Thank you. Brunn, continue
with the rehearsal.

129
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,385
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Yes, sir.

130
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,950
On stage, please.

131
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:20,089
Are you all right now? That was silly of
me to fall asleep in the dressing room.

132
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,100
Oh, I understand.

133
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,036
Carl, get some black coffee
and bring it to my office.

134
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,987
And as a doctor, you must realize that this
constant brooding over Marcellina is bad for you.

135
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,286
<i>You've had a brilliant career.</i>

136
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,122
Your clientele is most distinguished.

137
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,392
But you must put this tragedy
out of your mind.

138
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:57,128
<i>- #Ah, tell me why this doubt #
- Who is that singing?</i>

139
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:01,333
<i>- You hear it too?
- #Should fall to me #</i>

140
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:05,241
<i># Whose tragic power #</i>

141
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,542
# Seems to call to me ##

142
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,580
Who are you?

143
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:16,246
Who are you? She's Angela Klatt, a
music student. We are both students.

144
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,689
<i>Do you know what you were singing?
Of course. It's from The Magic Voice.</i>

145
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,919
That music is sacred.
Sacred?

146
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,588
Sacred to the memory of Marcellina.

147
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,723
No one must ever sing it again.
Do you hear?

148
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,360
<i>No one.
Hohner.</i>

149
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,243
And now may I ask what you're doing
in my music library?

150
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,252
Count Seebruck, forgive me, please.

151
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,448
I am altogether to blame.
You know these young people?

152
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:55,960
My nephew, Franz Munzer.
And this is Angela Klatt.

153
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:00,624
I've been smuggling them in here
to study these old scores.

154
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,133
I shouldn't have done it
without your permission.

155
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,762
It's quite all right, Carl.
There's no harm been done.

156
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,103
But Dr. Hohner.
I met him in the corridor.

157
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,907
Yes. Why was he so angry with me?
He was in love with Marcellina.

158
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:18,075
<i>Ten years ago, she disappeared.
But I still don't see why.</i>

159
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,084
You know,
it's a strange thing, my dear,

160
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,815
but as I came down the corridor, I
thought I heard Marcellina singing in here.

161
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,823
The doctor was convinced of it.

162
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,621
You mean my voice
is anything like hers?

163
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,754
<i>It's far more beautiful.
Did you ever hear Marcellina?</i>

164
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,995
No. She was before my time, but there's never been anything
like Angela's voice. It's the most beautiful voice in the world.

165
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,560
They are engaged to be married.

166
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,207
He could be right, you know.

167
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,209
How long have you been studying?

168
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,211
Eight years.
At the conservatory.

169
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,270
Franz is going to be
a great composer.

170
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,339
Indeed.

171
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,911
They have heard every performance in
the theater for the past three years.

172
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,115
They have season tickets, eh?

173
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,387
I smuggled them
under the prompter's box.

174
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,451
Incorrigible.

175
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:09,192
<i>- There's an aria in the second act of The Boulevardier.

MadameJarmila, Signor Roselli.

Klatt sing. Ah, but we did hear.

May I congratulate you?
Thank you, signor.

204
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,795
And MadameJarmila is just
as enthusiastic as I am.

205
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:20,025
I am indeed.
You show promise, my dear.

Great promise. Your voice is lovely,
but don't force it.

<i>Today, it would be a folly
to give it to the public.</i>

208
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:30,535
Believe me. Don't you
agree with me, Seebruck?

209
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,875
I do, Jarmila. As you say,
today, Miss Klatt is not ready.

210
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,108
Not nearly ready.

211
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:43,181
<i>But next week, Thursday,
I will present her in The Boulevardier.</i>

212
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,623

<i>Mama Hinzl.
Yes.</i>

214
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,344
What have you got there?
Angela's supper.

215
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,721
Nightingales must have something
solid to eat if they are to sing.

216
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,057
Solid is right. Fat sausages,
buttered buns and rich chocolate.

217
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:28,156
Take it away. You mean you are going to
let her go to the theater without eating?

218
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,667
That's no good for Angela.
It'll only make her fat.

219
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:34,968
Suppose it does. Whoever heard of
a good prima donna who wasn't fat?

220
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,340
"Soprano" and "fat" are one
and the same thing. Look at me.

221
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,936
Get her lemon juice and honey.

222
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,580
Lemon juice.

223
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,245
<i>Come in.</i>

224
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,248
Angela, are you ready? Yes.
Where's my muff? My muff.

225
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,053
Angela, don't be nervous now.
I'm not nervous. I feel fine.

226
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:02,567
You must be. I can't blame you for it. You've
been working so hard, and you're excited.

227
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:07,128
I'm not excited. Good. I'm not either. I'm as calm
as can be. There's one thing I must impress on you.

228
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,040
When you cross in the beginning of the number—
When you cross to the girls— Cross. Yeah.

229
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:15,011
You get the mirror from the girls and go
over and hold it in front of you— Yeah, yeah.

230
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,880
Please, Angela. Hold the mirror low. We
want to see your face. Yeah. The mirror.

231
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,919
Oh, Franz.
Oh, Angela.

232
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,784
Oh, you're going to be wonderful,
and I'll be very proud.

Coming.

235
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,897
Carl, a carriage?
Such extravagance.

236
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,060
Certainly. Whoever heard of
a prima donna walking to the theater?

237
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:40,229
Here you are, my little thrush.
Lemon juice and honey. Drink it all.

238
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:44,503
Of course, I wouldn't put this mess in
my stomach, but the maestro knows best.

239
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,773
Come, come, children. You can't
be late, Angela. This is an event.

240
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,041
<i>Good luck, darling.
Good-bye. Bye, Mama.!</i>

Lemon juice.

242
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,781
Excuse me. I'm s-sorry.

243
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,318
Oh. Sorry.

244
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,311
Angela Klatt.

245
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,718
The greatest voice in the world.
Quiet.

246
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,958
All right, girls. All right.
Places, please.

247

<i>Where are you to go?
# Where are you to go #</i>

309
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,245
<i>Will you recognize him?
# Will you recognize him #</i>

310
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:58,976
<i>How are you to know?
#How are you to know #</i>

311
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,419
# Our eyes will meet #

312
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:07,618
# Our lips will speak #

313
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:12,095
#Across some crowded #

314
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:15,326
# Hall #

315
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,235
<i>#I'll touch his hand #</i>

316
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:24,401
<i>#And understand #</i>

317
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:30,415
# It all #

318
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:36,045
<i># When he comes near #</i>

319
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,682
<i>#I know I'll hear #</i>

320
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,352
# Sweet music #

321
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:48,366
# From above #

322
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:52,870
#Till then, I'll dream #

323
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:56,805
# My dream #

324
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:02,836
# Of #

325
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:06,509
# Love ##

326
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,002
Miss Klatt alone, please.

327
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:39,082
<i>Bravo.!</i>

328
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,983
Good-bye, my dearJarmila.
Oh, are you going away?

329
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,613
No, but you are.

330
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:56,396
<i>What do you think?
Count Seebruck, I don't think. I know.</i>

331
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:01,167
<i>A new star is born. It's unbelievable. Her voice—
I could close my eyes and swear it's Marcellina.</i>

332
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,571
<i>You must feel it too.</i>

333
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:08,101
<i>I'm seriously thinking of reviving The
Magic Voice for her. Wonderful. Wonderful.</i>

334
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:20,647
Come to the office tomorrow. I
need to talk to you about something.

335
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,694
Meanwhile, tonight—

336
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,729
Franz. She was magnificent.

337
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:36,171
Weren't you nervous, excited?
Both. I ate my program.

338
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,801
Oh, Leon, I forgot to
buy her a present. Oh.

339
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:47,308
<i>- Ajeweler open till midnight?
- Yes. He sells gifts to the men while they wait for their sweethearts to come out.</i>

340
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,479
Then, next day, he buys them back
from the girls at one-half.

341
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:54,719
Each piece he sells over and over. Well,
he won't sell my present over again.

342
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,852
Oh. Is he expensive?
Very.

343
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,396
But men in love don't question prices.

344
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,455
That's right, Leon.

345
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,017
I beg your pardon.

346
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,062
But you're Miss Klatt,
aren't you?

347
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,928
Yes.
I'm Dr. Hohner.

348
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,467
Oh, yes, Doctor. I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

349
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:42,097
It's a rule of the theater to have your
throat examined after each performance.

350
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,165
Now, if you don't mind,
my office is just around the corner.

351
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:49,771
I'm sorry, but— but I'm waiting
for Franz. Franz Munzer, my fiancé.

352
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,442
He should be waiting for you.
But if I'm not here—

353
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,485
He'll wait.
But, Doctor, I—

354
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:59,387
I'm sorry, my dear, but Count
Seebruck expects the report tonight.

355
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,925
I won't keep you a moment.

356
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,223
You know,

357
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,889
I heard you sing tonight.

358
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,934
I haven't heard a voice
like that in 10 years.

359
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:13,300
Thank you, Doctor. You have a
great career ahead of you, my dear.

360
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,629
I hadn't thought a throat examination
would be necessary after the performance.

361
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:45,135
It's a rule of the Royal Theatre. You are part of
that theater now, my dear, and you must obey its rules.

362
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,195
From now on, your music
must come before everything.

363
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,970
But what about Franz? Oh, Franz,
of course. But that will come later.

364
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:04,979
It's hard to believe that it's 10 years since
I brought Marcellina here after a great triumph.

365
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,427
Ah, Luise.
This is Miss Klatt.

366
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,931
How do you do, Luise?
Is that Marcellina?

367
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:18,662
Yes. Perhaps I shouldn't say it—
and I don't say it boastfully—

368
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:22,035
but Count Seebruck told me
that my voice reminded him of hers.

369
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:26,509
It's true. That's why I behaved so
rudely that morning in the library.

370
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,639
I was certain it was Marcellina's voice
come back to life again.

371
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,618
That's a wonderful compliment,
Doctor.

372
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,480
You knew her very well, didn't you?

373
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:42,492
No one knew her better.
Now will you come with me?

374
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,954
Excuse me.

375
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,905
Don't mind Luise.

376
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,876
She was Marcellina's maid
and companion.

377
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:05,610
She worshipped her. And as a reward for her
devotion, I brought her here to keep house for me.

378
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:09,380
You're handy to the theater,
aren't you? I have to be.

379
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,514
You songbirds
are my official responsibility.

380
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,653
And if I'm too busy to get away, I can still
hear the opera through these ventilators.

381
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,391
It's like a private
performance, isn't it?

382
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,890
Oh, this is lovely.

383
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,131
That's Marcellina as Isolde.

384
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,196
She sang it beautifully.

385
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,402
She must be very real
to you, Doctor.

386
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,173
Yes. Let me show you.

387
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:41,314
I have souvenirs here
of every role she ever sang.

388
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,287
What do you think
became of Marcellina, Doctor?

389
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,918
That is a mystery
that has never been solved.

390
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,178
<i>She used this fan
in Romeo and Juliet.</i>

391
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,776
<i>And this slipper is one of a pair
she wore in Mozart's Nozze di Figaro.</i>

392
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,444
Oh.

393
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,787
What tiny feet she must have had.

394
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,849
Like a child.

395
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,987
That's true. A child.

396
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,731
What exquisite pearls.

397
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,964
<i>She always wore them
in The Magic Voice.</i>

398
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,267
She had them on
the night she disappeared.

399
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:39,605
<i>How would you like to wear them
when you sing The Magic Voice?</i>

400
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:44,205
I? Perhaps I'm talking out of turn.

401
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,183
Seebruck told me tonight
he plans on reviving it with you.

402
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,647
Oh. Oh, I can't believe it.

403
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,123
Shall we try them on for luck?

404
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,356
She always wound them
around her throat.

405
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,524
Like this.

406
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,933
Her slender,

407
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:10,303
graceful throat.

408
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,871
Exquisite to the touch.

409
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:47,172
- I shouldn't keep Franz waiting so long.
- I'm sorry.

410
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,510
I forgot all about him. Now
let's take a look at your throat.

411
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,209
I won't keep you
another moment.

412
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,411
You'll be coming here
regularly, you know.

413
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,478
From now on, I'm responsible
for your physical welfare.

414
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,115
Oh, just sit down there,
my dear.

415
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,720
Then you're not going to
operate on me? Of course not.

416
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,230
Well, all these things
are rather frightening.

417
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:12,702
I know exactly what you mean. I feel
the same way when I go to the dentist's.

418
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,765
Now then.
If you'll remove your hat...

419
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,833
and loosen your cape.

420
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,750
Now then. Sit back in the
chair and be comfortable.

421
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:40,731
This is only a routine examination.
It won't take long.

422
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,834
The light.

423
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,827
We're ready.

424
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,342
Now watch the light.

425
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,978
No, no. Watch it.

426
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:05,011
I— I can't. It hurts my eyes.
It'll only be for a minute.

427
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:08,354
I want to relax you
before I examine your throat.

428
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,204
<i>You don't mind it now, do you?</i>

429
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,401
Rest, my dear.

430
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:33,474
Restore those tired
and broken nerves.

431
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:38,080
Drive out all fear and weariness.

432
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:41,420
<i>Chase away the shadows and forms...</i>

433
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:45,792
<i>that exhaust our emotions
and enfeeble us.</i>

434
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,199
That's better.

435
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,202
You're relaxing now.

436
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:58,231
<i>Body, muscles, nerves, brain.</i>

437
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:04,511
<i>You're gliding away
into pleasant places.</i>

438
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,380
You don't resist anymore.

439
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,751
<i>Gently slipping into another world—</i>

440
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:18,886
a world of my design
where you will be helpless without me.

441
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,133
Can you hear me?

442
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,661
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

443
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,901
Yes.

444
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,206
I hear you, Doctor.

445
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:41,512
You don't want to sing again. Ever.

446
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:48,650
<i>Tonight, you give your voice
and your will to me.</i>

447
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,717
I'm in control.

448
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:55,859
<i>Your voice will no longer
answer your brain.</i>

449
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,333
<i>It will obey mine instead.</i>

450
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,499
<i>Look at the mirror.
Keep looking at it.</i>

451
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,179
You will never try to sing again.

452
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,183
Say it.

453
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,645
I—

454
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:23,888
I will never try to sing again.

455
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:26,930
That voice was never yours.

456
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,490
It belongs to Marcellina,
but it's leaving you.

457
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,198
<i>I'm sending it back to her.</i>

458
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,169
<i>It must be silenced forever.</i>

459
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,673
I forbid you to sing again.

460
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,252
My—

461
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,620
My throat.

462
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,988
I'll take care of that.

463
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:17,047
You will take this atomizer with you
and never be without it.

464
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,917
It will remind you of my control.

465
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,629
Shall we get up now?

466
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,901
I— I must have fallen asleep.

467
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,910
Just what I wanted.

468
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,742
And my throat?
Perfect.

469
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,807
I don't think it's going
to give us a bit of trouble.

470
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:59,087
Can I help you, Doctor?
Yes, Luise.

471
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,750
Send Miss Klatt home
in the carriage.

472
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,105
<i>#Ah, tell me why this doubt
should fall to me #</i>

473
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,266
<i># Whose tragic—#</i>

474
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,335
<i>#Ah, tell me why
this doubt should—#</i>

475
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,281
<i>#Ah—#</i>

476
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:04,880
<i>#Ah, tell me why this doubt
should fall to me #</i>

477
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:09,650
<i>#Ah, tell me why this doubt #</i>

478
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,628
<i>#Should fall to me #</i>

479
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,859
<i># Whose tragic power #</i>

480
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,460
<i>#Seems to call to me #</i>

481
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,471
<i>#Ah ##</i>

482
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,463
Marcellina, it's come back.

483
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:55,471
That voice—That voice
to take you away from me.

484
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,531
But I won't let it.
I won't let it.

485
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:08,346
How can you sit there when we don't
even know what's happened to her?

486
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,115
We know what happened.
She made a great success.

487
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:14,646
That is no reason to disappear into
thin air. I'm going to the police.

488
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,558
<i>Here she is.</i>

489
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,066
Angela, where have you been?

490
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:36,044
I'm sorry, Franz. Really.
We were worried about you.

491
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,104
Please forgive me.

492
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:41,310
Of course, but—
Won't you tell me what happened?

493
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,047
I— I don't know.

494
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,248
You don't know?

495
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:52,523
Angela, I waited for you at the theater
for hours. You must have gone someplace.

496
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,587
Let's not talk about it
tonight, Franz.

497
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:58,260
I— I'm very tired.
Some other time.

498
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,154
<i>Angela, forgive me.</i>

499
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,383
<i>L— I was so worried
about you,</i>

500
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:23,085
<i>I forgot to tell you
how wonderful you were.</i>

501
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,287
I was in the audience, you know.

502
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,830
You—You got five curtain calls.

503
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,359
Then when I left
and waited for you—

504
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,904
I didn't wait so long.

505
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:40,342
Leon told me that across the street
there was a little jewelry shop...

506
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:43,244
where men bought their present,
and then they—

507
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,440
Well—

508
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,452
For you.

509
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,757
To—

510
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,316
To remind you of your first success.

511
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,889
My first success.

512
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,193
Oh, Franz.

513
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,500
Oh, my darling.
Please hold me tight.

514
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,942
Franz, I— I'm afraid.

515
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,310
Afraid of what?

516
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,542
I— I don't know.

517
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,782
They tell me she's young, beautiful
and really can sing.

518
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,921
Good morning, Count. May I have a statement
for my newspaper? Now, gentlemen. Please.

519
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,795
<i>The Magic Voice has been out
of the repertory for 10 years, hasn't it?</i>

520
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:39,335
Yes, ever since La Marcellina's
strange disappearance.

521
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,236
Then you found the new soprano.
Then I found Miss Klatt.

522
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,240
Did you say "Klatt"?

523
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,347
Franz.

524
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:05,489
#Warriors bold
We are come to this garden fete #

525
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:09,794
<i>#Marching to love
as we march to war #</i>

526
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:13,530
<i>Good morning, my dearJarmila.</i>

527
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,233
Well, our baritone is positively
glowing this morning.

528
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:20,504
Glowing with new admiration
for you, my dear.

529
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:24,604
Few prima donnas would confess
so openly they had anything to learn.

530
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:26,979
I salute you.
Anything to learn?

531
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,848
It takes character
to understudy a newcomer.

532
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,184
Understudy?

533
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:35,054
<i>Your new soprano will never
sing The Magic Voice. Oh, no?</i>

534
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:39,619
No! Seebruck's insane to even consider
letting a young, inexperienced girl like that—

535
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:43,530
You forget, my dear,
that once upon a time you were a girl.

536
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,534
<i>#... the greatest game of all #</i>

537
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:49,197
<i>#Love is no trifling thing
to a maid in the spring #</i>

538
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:52,401
<i>#So best be wary, lad
or you will be had #</i>

539
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:56,503
<i># Yes, you'll be had
and that is bad for men of arms #</i>

540
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:03,042
#Ah, yes, that is bad
for mighty men of arms ##

541
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:07,480
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.

542
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,924
This is followed
by the baritone solo and ballet.

543
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,554
We have the sketches of the set.
Would you like to see them? Not now.

544
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:17,589
The ballet is followed by the soprano aria.
We'll omit the baritone solo and the ballet.

545
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,661
I want these gentlemen of the press to
hear Miss Klatt. Of course. Gentlemen.

546
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:23,672
We take it
from the soprano aria.

547
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,970
Signor Roselli on stage, please.

548
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,341
Attention, gentlemen.
The ladder back, please.

549
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,472
Miss Klatt! On stage, please.

550
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:02,341
# I was all alone #

551
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:06,508
#A blindly groping maid #

552
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:10,781
# My heart was still my own #

553
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:15,348
#Just hoping, yet afraid #

554
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:19,191
<i>- # Oflove #
- #Then I came and found you there #</i>

555
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:25,099
# I called your name
and breathed a prayer #

556
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:29,002
# I began to live #

557
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:33,008
<i># The moment that I knew #</i>

558
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:37,638
#The clouds began to give #

559
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:41,878
#The sun came shining through #

560
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:46,480
<i>#Above # # You were
mine to have and hold #</i>

561
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:51,721
# But even then
the sun grew cold #

562
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,262
#Ah #

563
00:48:55,332 --> 00:49:00,269
<i># Tell me why this doubt
should fall to me #</i>

564
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:04,706
#Whose tragic power—##

565
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,847
"Whose tragic power calls for me. "

566
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:28,125
I— I'm sorry.
May I try that last part again?

567
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:30,962
Of course, my dear.
Of course.

568
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,832
#Ah #

569
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:39,137
#Tell me why this doubt—#

570
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,652
Why, darling, what happened?

571
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,926
<i>Quite the real thing.</i>

572
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,053
Angela, what happened?
My voice— It's gone.

573
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,618
That's ridiculous.
My voice— It's gone!

574
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,630
Stop saying that and come here.

575
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,689
Franz. What's the matter with me?

576
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,634
Nothing. People don't lose their
voices like that. You've got to sing.

577
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,830
I— I can't, Franz.

578
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,499
For some reason, I don't want to sing.
Angela!

579
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,508
For me, darling.

580
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,104
Now, from the same place.

581
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,015
#Ah #

582
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:06,825
#Tell me why this doubt
should fall to me #

583
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,560
#Whose tragic power—##

584
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:29,274
Young man, how did you
get in this dressing room?

585
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:32,412
Do you realize that by forcing her
voice, you might ruin it forever?

586
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:36,858
- I'm only trying to help. She lost her confidence. That's all.
- Is that true, Doctor?

587
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,556
Why do you think her voice broke?
High tension, nerves.

588
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,565
<i>And it could be serious?
It could be if not taken care of.</i>

589
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,567
What do you advise, Doctor?

590
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:48,297
A few days, at least,
of absolute rest.

591
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,703
But rehearsal— You can
rehearse with the understudy.

592
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,208
But you won't have to.
I tell you she's perfectly all right.

593
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,710
It's quite obvious
she's not perfectly all right.

594
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,906
Her voice did break.
We all heard it.

595
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:01,041
I would suggest that we leave it
to Miss Klatt herself.

596
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,614
What with your nerves in this condition,
do you think you ought to sing?

597
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:14,720
I don't know.

598
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,063
I never felt like this before.

599
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,569
We'd better send her home, Brunn.

600
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,571
Where does she live?
Fifteen Hahnen Street.

601
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,131
I'm afraid that won't do.
She must have professional care.

602
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,200
The hospital?

603
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:35,214
How would you like to come
home with me for a few days?

604
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,927
I'll come and see you, Angela.

605
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:57,838
I'd wait, my boy.
She needs complete rest.

606
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:38,205
That woman must have blackmailed
Seebruck into giving her the part.

607
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:41,409
<i>After the papers have been full
of nothing but The Magic Voice,</i>

608
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,475
Seebruck will have to produce it.

609
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,487
But it isn't for her.
She can never sing the aria.

610
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,046
They can lower the key.
But it's Angela's part.

611
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:51,093
There was nothing wrong with her—
until she met Hohner.

612
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,959
Dr. Hohner wants to help Angela.
Then why does he keep her locked up?

613
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,726
Why can't I go and see her?
She hasn't even answered my letters.

614
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:04,401
I'm going to take her back
where she belongs. Franz.

615
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:56,091
Yes?
I would like to see Dr. Hohner.

616
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,753
Dr. Hohner never sees patients at
this hour. But I'm not a patient.

617
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:01,353
It's— It's a personal matter,
and it's very important.

618
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,695
What is it about?
Angela Klatt.

619
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:06,827
Angela Klatt?
I've got to see her.

620
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,996
I'm afraid you'll have to come
another time.

621
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:11,563
The doctor is just leaving
for the theater.

622
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,154
I've decided not to go
to the theater tonight, Luise.

623
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,825
Oh, but that was a message
from Count Seebruck.

624
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:41,098
The new tenor has a sore throat. Oh.

625
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,308
Why don't you go home? Now,
why don't you go to the theater?

626
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,312
You should be there by now.
But, Franz—

627
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,645
Go on. Don't worry about me. I just
want to see what happens. Go on.

628
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,858
She's upstairs. Hurry.

629
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:08,321
Angela. Angela, it's Franz.

630
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,382
Angela, what's the matter?
Don't you know me?

631
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,361
<i>Good evening, Dr. Hohner.</i>

632
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,364
Good evening, Leon.

633
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,162
Who is that singing?
That's the new tenor.

634
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:20,668
Well, there's nothing wrong
with his throat. No, sir.

635
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,831
Get her out of here now
before it's too late.

636
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:28,639
Angela, we're getting out of here. I
mustn't leave. He doesn't want me to leave.

637
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,805
Let me stay, Franz. Please let me stay.
I'll take you home to Mama Hinzl and Carl.

638
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:34,281
Hurry. Please hurry.

639
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,735
The back door.
Quickly.

640
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,212
To the left, out the door
and through the gate.

641
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:25,333
<i>Dr. Hohner!</i>

642
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,907
Dr. Hohner! Dr. Hohner!

643
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,246
<i>Dr. Hohner, she's gone.</i>

644
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:40,407
How? Where were you?

645
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:43,213
After you left, I went down to the
kitchen to look after some things.

646
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:46,653
A little later, I came up to see her.
She wasn't here.

647
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:48,691
I searched everywhere,
but she was gone.

648
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:51,591
They must have been watching the
house for days, waiting for a chance.

649
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,652
Who brought that message
from the theater?

650
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,028
I don't know.
I never saw him before.

651
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,090
Franz. The young fool.

652
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,158
What are you going to do?

653
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,839
Nothing.

654
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:07,570
That girl will obey me
no matter where she is.

655
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:22,153
I fixed you some nice hot soup, dear.

656
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:26,889
Put it over here, Mama Hinzl.
No, Franz. You mustn't touch it.

657
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,897
Angela, it's just an atomizer.

658
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:32,366
He— He told me
something about it.

659
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,869
Franz, what did he tell me?
Can't you remember?

660
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,998
I— I can't.

661
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:42,368
But I— But I must.
It was very important.

662
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:44,379
Don't worry about it now.

663
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:46,574
Mama Hinzl is going
to give you your soup.

664
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,810
Franz, don't leave me.

665
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:50,944
All right, darling.

666
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,853
Now close your eyes
and try to sleep.

667
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,857
Think of nothing else.

668
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:15,537
You saw the chemist? It's water,
Uncle Carl— plain everyday water.

669
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,546
Water?

670
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:23,917
Yes. You are sure
this came out of the atomizer?

671
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,978
Yes. I took it out
when Angela was asleep.

672
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:29,684
I was sure there was something in there
that stopped her from singing, but now I—

673
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:32,956
Oh, Uncle Carl, what is it—
her imagination?

674
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:36,897
When did her voice break first?
When she was singing the aria.

675
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:40,959
At rehearsal, with
Hohner watching her. Yes.

676
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:43,665
And the next time?
In her dressing room.

677
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,765
And Hohner walked in.

678
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:50,108
All this after she had been
to his office for treatment.

679
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:53,512
He must have frightened
the child. But why?

680
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:57,110
Marcellina. The aria.

681
01:00:57,186 --> 01:01:00,883
Who can tell what goes on in a
man's mind? And who can prove it?

682
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:04,518
Oh, Carl, what are we going to do?
I don't know.

683
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:09,995
In the army, when a man
was thrown from a horse,

684
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:12,967
we put him right back on the horse
and made him ride.

685
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:15,004
And it worked?
Usually.

686
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:19,007
The longer a man waited,
the more difficult it became.

687
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:23,910
Something in his mind grew
into a terrible mental hazard.

688
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,210
Men, horses— I know.

689
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:28,216
But it's different with singers.

690
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:30,878
Why should it be different
with singers? The same hazard.

691
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:35,315
Of course! That's it.

692
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:38,918
Franz, where are you going?
Wait for me.

693
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,363
What you ask is not only impossible.
It's fantastic. But the girl is very ill.

694
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:50,270
We not only ask you to save her
career, but her life as well.

695
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,705
Dr. Hohner tells me she's
lost her voice beyond recovery.

696
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,709
Dr. Hohner is wrong.

697
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:58,804
Let's be reasonable about this thing.
All I demand is a chance to hear her sing.

698
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,076
I've asked you to bring her
here to my office.

699
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,278
But, no, you must have my company,
my orchestra, lights—

700
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:08,050
a full performance for your
experiment before an audience.

701
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:12,254
It's absolutely out of the question.
That will be all, gentlemen.

702
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:14,262
But, Count Seebruck—
Franz.

703
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,028
I told you it was
a hopeless task.

704
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,766
We gave him his chance. Now
he has only himself to blame.

705
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,308
We are going over his head.
But who is over his head?

706
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,741
The king.
The king?

707
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,609
Do you mean to say
we should ask the king himself?

708
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,708
Come on.

709
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,169
Is this the cross
he gave you personally?

710
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:06,545
Hundreds of us
got the same decoration.

711
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,414
And it wasn't him. It was
his father who gave it to me.

712
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:12,750
Just stick your chest out.
I'm going to lose my job.

713
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:16,383
Seebruck will discharge me. You must
have been much braver when you were young.

714
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:19,257
No one is permitted in this corridor
until His Majesty has left the theater.

715
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:23,025
Oh, but— but His Majesty
will grant him an audience.

716
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:25,932
<i>You should know better. You will
have to make your petition in writing.</i>

717
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,867
Gentlemen, His Majesty the king.

718
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:02,733
- Well, one of the heroes from Sadova.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

719
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:06,673
Second Cavalry, Blue Hussars.

720
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:08,733
Yes, Your Majesty.
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

721
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:11,302
This corridor should have been
cleared of petitioners.

722
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:14,713
One of my father's old guard
may talk to me at any time.

723
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:16,752
Now, what can I do for you?

724
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:19,913
It's about a singer.
Ayoung lady.

725
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,321
We are in love.

726
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,825
No. The young lady and I
are in love.

727
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:29,627
Oh, I see. Well, in that case,
shall we step in here?

728
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:50,446
Oh, this performance will be known
as the most dismal fiasco...

729
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:53,420
in the entire history
of the Royal Theatre.

730
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,855
This will really make me immortal.

731
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,950
<i>Seebruck.! I want to talk to you.</i>

732
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:00,791
This is the last straw, and I don't intend
to stand for it any longer.

733
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:03,457
There's no clause in my contract
that calls for insults.

734
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:07,298
My name is on every billboard, and
this— this nobody is singing in my place.

735
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:10,271
Do you know what I'm going to do? I'm
going to leave here and never come back.

736
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,603
I wish to heaven
I could go with you.

737
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:15,610
Oh, you sent for me?
Yes. Here, read this.

738
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:25,052
A command performance.
It's unbelievable.

739
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:29,057
What shall I do?
What can I do?

740
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:31,889
I would suggest that you have
MadameJarmila stand by.

741
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:34,088
Stand by? And let her
make a fool of me?

742
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,791
You don't have to bother
about that.

743
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:41,260
It will not be possible
for that girl to sing.

744
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,641
How'd she take it?
I don't know.

745
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,941
I haven't told her anything except
that we're going to the theater.

746
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:55,217
Oh, Mama Hinzl, I—
I don't want to go.

747
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,218
You run along with Franz.

748
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,277
See your friends.
Hear some music.

749
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:02,051
It will do you good.
You look wonderful, Angela.

750
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,718
Good night, Mama Hinzl.
Good night.

751
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:08,621
But how will I
get to the theater?

752
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:12,225
Just walk if you have to,
but leave them alone.

753
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,292
But, Mama Hinzl—

754
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,159
Good evening, Miss Klatt.
Good evening, Leon.

755
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,703
Count Seebruck wants
to see you. Where is he?

756
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:51,865
Uh, Dressing Room 22.
Thank you, Leon.

757
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,745
<i>Good evening, Miss Klatt.
Please come in.</i>

758
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:08,847
<i>This is Count Romborg,
aide-de-camp to His Majesty.</i>

759
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:10,653
Enchanted.

760
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:14,526
<i>Miss Klatt, you are commanded by His
Majesty to sing The Magic Voice tonight.</i>

761
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:17,896
I? Sing? Yes. A command performance.

762
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,901
But... I can't.

763
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,937
But it is His Majesty's orders.

764
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:24,700
My congratulations,
Miss Klatt.

765
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,765
This is a great honor, my dear.

766
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:29,402
But, Count Seebruck—
The king.

767
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,810
I'll send a maid to you.

768
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:35,878
Mr. Brunn. Now, now. Your
wardrobe is all ready.

769
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:38,579
I'll see you on the stage.
Good luck.

770
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,294
Franz, I'm afraid.
No, you're not.

771
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,887
You're—You're probably
as surprised as I am.

772
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:51,626
As Count Seebruck said,
this is a great honor.

773
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,794
The king sends his aide-de-camp
to command you to sing.

774
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:58,431
But that's why I'm afraid. I—
I can't sing. Of course you can.

775
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:02,273
The minute you're out there before the
audience and— and hear that music, you'll sing.

776
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:05,609
Everybody wants you to. Look.
They're—They're all thinking of you.

777
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,445
They send you their—
their good wishes. Here.

778
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:14,720
Here. Flowers from Seebruck,
from Brunn, from Roselli.

779
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:17,418
Flowers even from His Majesty.

780
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:25,534
Franz, what's that?

781
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,967
Another present, I suppose.
We'll soon find out.

782
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:47,448
That is... just like the one you—
you have at home.

783
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:51,186
Now I broke your present.
I— I'm sorry.

784
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,251
That was very clumsy of me.

785
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,855
Angela.

786
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,665
Was that very important?

787
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:04,797
Dr. Hohner told me something
about it. My— My voice.

788
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,399
Oh, that's just broken glass
and a little colored water.

789
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:11,276
Listen. Whatever Dr. Hohner said
is past and gone—just like that.

790
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:15,044
Tonight is the night you've worked and
studied for, the night we've dreamed of.

791
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:17,813
<i>Do you know why The Magic Voice
hasn't been performed for 10 years?</i>

792
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:20,822
Because there was no one to sing it.
Now the king commands you to sing it.

793
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:24,121
That's what you've got to do. So
forget Dr. Hohner. Forget everything.

794
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,893
Everything but— but me.

795
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:30,898
Of course, Franz.

796
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:33,594
And I'll really try.
I know you will.

797
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:37,298
And you'll be wonderful.
Now get dressed.

798
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,736
I'll call you when I'm changed.

799
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:50,847
How is she? Fine. Everything is
going to work out as we planned.

800
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,856
I have fixed a place in the wings for you
where Angela can see you while she sings.

801
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:57,392
Come. I'll show you.

802
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,697
<i>Just a moment. Count Seebruck
sent me to Miss Klatt.</i>

803
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:11,706
You may help the ballet girls.
Yes, madame.

804
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:29,314
I came to help you dress.

805
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:41,436
The last time I saw Marcellina,

806
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:44,904
she was standing right here,
in a dress just like that.

807
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:48,908
You're as beautiful as she was.

808
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:52,505
Thank you, Luise.
I'll take this.

809
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:56,311
Would you ask Franz to
come in now, please? Yes.

810
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:13,086
I've come to help you, my dear.

811
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,630
It's cruel of them
to do this to you.

812
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:18,394
<i>You don't want to sing, do you?</i>

813
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:23,329
But I— I promised Franz I'd try.

814
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,307
Of course you did, my dear.

815
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:30,243
But Franz doesn't understand.

816
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:35,181
<i>You're in no condition to sing,
are you?</i>

817
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:39,854
I— I don't know.

818
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:42,857
I only know
I promised Franz I'd try.

819
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:46,588
Dr. Hohner!
Don't look at me like that.

820
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,596
Franz!

821
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:54,034
What does Franz know about it?

822
01:12:56,538 --> 01:13:00,338
Why, you're trembling, shaking.

823
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:03,003
Your nerves have gone to pieces.

824
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:08,472
I warned Franz what would happen
if he forced you to sing.

825
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:16,991
You don't want to ruin
that voice, do you?

826
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:21,485
It isn't yours. Remember?

827
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:28,864
Now tell me. Whose voice is it?

828
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:32,373
Tell me.

829
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:37,335
Marcellina's.

830
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:16,950
#Warriors bold
We are come to this fete #

831
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:21,012
# Marching to love
as we march to war #

832
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:24,957
# Ready for any fate
We await duty's call #

833
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:28,861
# Eager to meet the foe
Even though we know #

834
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:31,456
#That we may all be captured
by the lovely foe #

835
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:34,627
#We gladly go to meet
in this fairy garden #

836
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:36,637
#Where we pirouette and posture #

837
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:40,471
# Here where romance seems to call
in the measures of a dance #

838
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:44,706
#We bow and we smile and we preen
for the ladies we adore #

839
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:48,807
#And pray that they soon may heed
our pleas of love #

840
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:52,615
# Meanwhile, we know
as they sigh most romantically #

841
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:56,624
#They have their minds
on the greatest game of all #

842
01:14:56,692 --> 01:15:00,560
# Love is no trifling thing
to a maid in the spring #

843
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:03,792
# So best be wary, lad
or you will be had #

844
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:07,734
#Yes, you'll be had
and that is bad for men of arms #

845
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:14,140
#Ah, yes, that is bad
for mighty men of arms ##

846
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:16,370
<i>She ought to be ready by now.</i>

847
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:18,936
Yes. I want to rehearse the aria
once more anyway.

848
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:23,774
Angela, are you ready?

849
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:26,887
Angela.

850
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,881
Angela!

851
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:34,255
Angela!
Where is she?

852
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:43,571
Hohner.

853
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:50,979
Have you seen Dr. Hohner?
Not tonight.

854
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:57,777
I want to borrow this.
Carl!

855
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:02,221
This time, I'll silence it forever.

856
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:19,966
Murderer.

857
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:24,570
I suspected you from the first and
came here as your servant to make sure.

858
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:27,240
For 10 years, I've watched and waited.

859
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:30,774
You kept your secret well until
the first night you brought Angela here...

860
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:34,015
<i>when you showed the pearls Marcellina
had on when she disappeared.</i>

861
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,387
You took them off her body.

862
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:42,630
<i>I'm not afraid of you.</i>

863
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:45,166
<i>I needed more evidence
for the police.</i>

864
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:47,929
<i>I got it tonight when I followed you here
from the dressing room—</i>

865
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:50,301
in time to save this child.

866
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:53,671
You killed Marcellina.
You'll never say that again.

867
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:01,175
Dr. Hohner!
Angela, are you all right?

868
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:03,740
<i>You should be at the theater.
You're singing The Magic Voice tonight.</i>

869
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:07,346
<i>She can't sing. I won't let her. She
will sing, and you can't stop her.</i>

870
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:11,882
If this girl sings, I won't be
responsible. I will. Carl, watch him.

871
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,326
Get back, Doctor.
This way.

872
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:24,466
<i>My dearJarmila,
what a great night for you.</i>

873
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:27,770
Yes, when your little Miss Nobody
breaks down, I go on to save your face.

874
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:31,006
<i>Why, not at all. You've always
wanted to sing The Magic Voice.</i>

875
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,445
This is your great opportunity.
And what an audience!

876
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:36,177
Haven't I always said that hers
is the greatest voice in the country?

877
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,583
In the country, Count Seebruck?
In the world. In the world.

878
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,747
What about your brilliant
new discovery?

879
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,881
Forget about her.
Forget about everything.

880
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:45,017
Go out there
and cover yourself with glory.

881
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:49,587
Thrill the king and that distinguished audience
with the golden voice of the greatJarmila.

882
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:53,159
All right. I'll do it.

883
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:56,932
But not for you or for the king.

884
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,565
ForJarmila.
Brava.

885
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,224
Send the police to
Dr. Hohner's. Yes, sir.

886
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:02,429
Where have you been?
We've looked everywhere.

887
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:06,031
This is a command performance for the king.
You've just time to make your entrance.

888
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:09,236
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
Luise, take care of her.

889
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,882
What about me
and my golden voice?

890
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:25,859
Do you think I'm going to stand here
and let that little— Shh! The king.

891
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,254
She ought to be there by now.

892
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:32,391
Don't go on that stage.

893
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:35,027
Your voice will break.
I warn you.

894
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,503
Don't go on that stage.

895
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,793
I forbid you to sing.
Do you hear?

896
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:05,060
- I forbid you to sing.
- Sit down.

897
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:17,637
<i>Repeat the cue.</i>

898
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:31,120
<i>#Ah, we bid you welcome
to this fete #</i>

899
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:34,788
<i>#Ah, we're sorry if we made you wait #</i>

900
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,927
<i>#Ah, let violins begin the dance #</i>

901
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:44,836
#Ah, let there be joy
and gay romancing #

902
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:18,829
<i>#I was all alone #</i>

903
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:23,276
#A blindly groping maid #

904
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:27,145
# My heart was still my own #

905
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:31,709
<i>#Just hoping, yet afraid #</i>

906
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:35,813

907
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:41,227
# I called your name
and breathed a prayer #

908
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:46,165
# I began to live #

909
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:50,068
