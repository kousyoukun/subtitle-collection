3
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,783
Good evening, doctor.

4
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,626
doctor?

5
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,464
Yes.

6
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,468
Dr. Hohner.

7
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,918
The theater physician.

8
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,544
He lives just around the corner.

9
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,842
What's he doin' around
here this time of night?

10
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,056
Somebody sick?

11
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,015
Yes.

12
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,019
He is.

13
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,932
Marcellina.

14
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,475
Marcellina.

15
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,483
Oh yes.

16
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,729
Did the police ever find her?

17
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,102
no.

18
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,401
After 10 years, they've given up trying.

19
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,176
Marcellina, it has come.

20
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,674
At last, it has come.

21
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,549
What, Luise?

22
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,552
I couldn't wait, I opened it.

23
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:36,182
The king invites you, no,
commands you to sing for him.

24
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,399
Luise, I'm going to faint.

25
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,687
Not now, my sweet.

26
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,232
After you sing for the king,
you can faint all you like.

27
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,319
Will you find the maestro?

28
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,315
I want him to hear the good news.

29
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,944
Oh, this is the biggest moment of my life.

30
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:44,716
♫ Ah, tell me why this
doubt should fall to me

31
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:51,014
♫ whose tragic power seems to call to me ♫

32
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,434
Friedrich, I asked you
never to come here again.

33
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,475
I had to see you.

34
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,599
Well, I don't want to see you.

35
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,316
I thought you understood that.

36
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,309
But I love you, Marcellina.

37
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,027
No, Friedrich.

38
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,865
You love your own private, selfish world.

39
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:13,203
You want to lock me up there
with you, give up my career.

40
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,117
That's what you've got to do.

41
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,411
I can't bear the thought that any man

42
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,287
can hear you sing, feast his eyes on you,

43
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,209
just for the price of a ticket.

44
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,753
I worked hard for my success, Friedrich.

45
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,002
Tonight, there were 11 solo curtain calls,

46
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,427
more than any other singer's
ever had in this theater.

47
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,471
The king commands me to sing for him.

48
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,594
Why, I'd be a fool to
give that up for you.

49
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,595
Darling, listen to me.

50
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,019
No, Friedrich. I've listened
to you for the last time.

51
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,141
Now please go.

52
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,062
This isn't really you
speaking, Marcellina.

53
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,907
You've forgotten how happy
we've been, and will be again.

54
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:55,154
Now let me hear you say once
more, just as you used to,

55
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,121
"I love you, Friedrich.”

56
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,873
I can't say it,
because I don't love you.

57
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,089
I hate you.

58
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,296
I don't hate you.

59
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:14,056
I only hate the thing that's
come between us, your voice.

60
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,508
Yes, I know.

61
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,520
You were out front tonight.

62
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,524
I felt your eyes on me.

63
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,439
Like you're looking at me now.

64
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,653
Go away.

65
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,942
Get out of here!

66
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,157
I'm afraid of you.

67
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,736
you needn't be.

68
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,574
I love you, my darling.

69
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,700
You know that.

70
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,079
I'd give my life for you.

71
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,875
This thing that shuts
me out, I won't let it,

72
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,002
I tell you I won't let it.

73
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,923
It's here, now, between my fingers.

74
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:03,143
I've only to close them
to silence it forever.

75
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,686
Friedrich, you're hurting me.

76
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,144
Friedrich, you're...

77
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,586
We'll always be together now.

78
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,207
Your voice will never
come between us again.

79
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:33,554
Marcellina.

80
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,940
Dr. Hohner, are you all right?

81
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,232
Yes.

82
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Yes.

83
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,734
I'm all right.

84
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,331
Good morning, count Seebruck.

85
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,541
Good morning.

86
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,707
Good morning, count Seebruck.

87
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,921
Good morning.

88
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,586
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Jean.

89
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,424
Good morning, count Seebruck.

90
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,134
What a lovely morning.

91
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,753
The air is like wine.

92
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,847
Chestnut trees are in bloom.

93
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,886
All nature is in Harmony.

94
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,887
Well, even our friends the critics

95
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,855
have been kind to us this morning.

96
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,477
Oh, it's good to be alive.

97
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,943
Everything is serene, peaceful, quiet.

98
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,363
I have never been
so insulted in all my life!

99
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,577
I positively will not stand for it.

100
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,445
I am the prima Donna of the royal theatre,

101
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,164
and I won't be insulted by...

102
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,908
I was not insulting you.

103
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,581
I was merely trying to show you...

104
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,998
You, show me.

105
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,371
Why, the insolence!

106
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,965
Now, children, children, please, please.

107
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:36,969
What's wrong?

108
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,881
Stop it, stop it!

109
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,844
Now you, Brunn.

110
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:41,679
What is it?

111
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,014
And stop bobbing.

112
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,132
Yes, madame.

113
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,010
Count Seebruck, if you please.

114
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,478
We were just rehearsing the
duet between madame Jarmila

115
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,689
and signor Roselli, when
for no apparent reason,

116
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,773
madame Jarmila...

117
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,392
For no apparent reason?

118
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,486
Why, this creature here was handling me

119
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,899
like a pan of unbaked dough.

120
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,192
it was not.

121
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,033
I merely put my arm around your waist.

122
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,742
Carl, you were in the prompter's box.

123
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,952
You saw it all.

124
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:05,956
I'm sorry.

125
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,248
You know how it goes, count Seebruck.

126
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,742
♫ I love you ♫

127
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,209
♫ la-la-la-la, la-la-la ♫

128
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,999
will you take your hands off my stomach?

129
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,043
Perhaps you'd rather I
didn't touch you at all.

130
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,211
Nothing would please me better.

131
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,881
For 20 years, the baritone
embraces the prima Donna

132
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,004
at that particular moment.

133
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,050
Now she's trying to tell...

134
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,969
I defy anyone to sing in
one of your deathlike grips.

135
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,389
My dear, if you are unable to sing,

136
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,478
ti refuse to take the blame.

137
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,017
Unable to sing?

138
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,107
Just what do you mean by that insult?

139
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,476
Oh, stop it, stop it.

140
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,399
Roselli, you're as
temperamental as a prima Donna.

141
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,568
And as for you, Jarmila, I'm
getting a little bit tired

142
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,316
of your constant bickering.

143
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,193
So am I, count Seebruck.

144
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,991
And if you, as the
impresario of this theater,

145
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,411
don't do something about it, I shall.

146
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,033
All right.

147
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,501
Is madame"s understudy ready?

148
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,290
Yes, count Seebruck.

149
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,924
Miss Metzger, please.

150
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,585
Miss Metzger.

151
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,803
Yes, count Seebruck.

152
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,296
Come in, my dear.

153
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,392
Do you know the soprano role?

154
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,976
Oh, yes, sir.

155
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,938
You shall sing it tonight
in madame Jarmila's stead.

156
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,432
Tonight?

157
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,443
Oh.

158
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,031
oh.

159
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,113
If some composer would
only write me an operetta

160
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,704
without any women, I'd make him immortal.

161
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,073
count Seebruck!

162
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,040
Count Seebruck!

163
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,409
Well, what is it?

164
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,535
there's a...

165
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,788
well?

166
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,960
There's a dead man in
one of the dressing rooms.

167
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:40,832
a dead man?

168
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,333
in which room?

169
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,345
22.

170
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,975
But, Jarmila, darling.

171
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,947
Oh, it's you, Dr. Hohner.

172
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,446
I must have fallen asleep.

173
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,444
Thank you.

174
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,696
Brunn, continue with the rehearsal,

175
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,948
I'll be there as soon as I can.

176
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,706
yes sir.

177
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,076
On stage, please.

178
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,711
Are you all right now?

179
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,331
That was silly of me to fall
asleep in the dressing room.

180
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,878
Oh, I understand.

181
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,810
And as a doctor, you
must realize that this

182
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,484
constant brooding over
Marcellina is bad for you.

183
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,823
You've had a brilliant career.

184
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,364
Your clientele is most distinguished.

185
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,738
But you must put this
tragedy out of your mind.

186
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,417
Who is that singing?

187
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,877
You hear it too?

188
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:07,135
♫ whose tragic power seems to call to me ♫

189
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,763
Who are you?

190
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,602
She's Angela Klatt, a music student.

191
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,721
We are both students.

192
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,222
Do you know what you were singing?

193
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,723
Of course, it's from "the magic voice."

194
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,317
- That music is sacred.
- Sacred?

195
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,028
Sacred to the memory of Marcellina.

196
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,738
No one must ever sing it again.

197
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:28,857
Do you hear?

198
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,483
No one.

199
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,110
Hohner.

200
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,379
And now may I ask what you're
doing in my music library?

201
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,594
Count Seebruck, forgive me, please.

202
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,133
I am altogether to blame.

203
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,505
You know these young people?

204
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,929
My nephew, Franz Munzer.

205
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,769
And this is Angela Klatt.

206
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:01,856
I've been smuggling them in
here to study these old scores.

207
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,566
I shouldn't have done it
without your permission.

208
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,525
It's quite all right, Carl.

209
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,895
There's no harm been done.

210
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,521
but Dr. Hohnev.

211
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,489
Ti met him in the corridor.

212
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,984
Yes, why was he so angry with me?

213
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,031
He was in love with Marcellina.

214
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,280
10 years ago, she disappeared.

215
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,202
But I still don't see why.

216
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,371
You know, it's a strange thing, my dear,

217
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,835
but as I came down the corridor,

218
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,330
I thought I heard
Marcellina singing in here.

219
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,252
The doctor was convinced of it.

220
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,717
You mean my voice is anything like hers?

221
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,676
it's far more beautiful.

222
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,546
Did you ever hear Marcellina?

223
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,219
No, she was before my
time, but there's never

224
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,636
been anything like Angela's voice.

225
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,430
It's the most beautiful
voice in the world.

226
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,145
They are engaged to be married.

227
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,732
He could be right, you know.

228
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,316
How long have you been studying?

229
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,150
Eight years.

230
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,486
At the conservatory.

231
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,696
Franz is going to be a great composer.

232
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
indeed?

233
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,406
They have heard every
performance in the theater

234
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,199
for the past three years.

235
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,367
They have season tickets, eh?

236
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,538
I smuggled them under
the prompter's box.

237
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,751
Incorrigible.

238
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,832
There's an Aria in the second
act of the boulevardier.

239
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,209
"Someday I know."

240
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:23,517
♫ Someday I know [♫

241
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,563
♫ my heart will know ♫

242
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,062

how are you to find him?

255
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,703
Where are you to go?

256
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,126
Will you recognize him?

257
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,748
How are you to know?

258
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:42,221

what's the matter, dear?

262
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,816
Stifling in here, don't you think?

263
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,860
not for baritones.

264
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,404
♫ I'll touch his hand ♫

265
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,277
ah, Jarmila, Roselli.

266
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,413
Come in, come in.

267
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,203
Madame Jarmila, signor Roselli.

268
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,746
Miss Angela Klatt, Mr...

269
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,084
Munzer. Franz Munzer.

270
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,170
I'm sorry you didn't
hear miss Klatt sing.

271
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,913
Ah, but we did hear.

272
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,085
May I congratulate you?

273
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:14,923
Thank you, signor.

274
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,964
And madame Jarmila is just
as enthusiastic as I am.

275
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,587
am indeed.

276
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,557
You show promise, my dear, great promise.

277
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,302
Your voice is lovely, but don't force it.

278
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:28,100
Today it would be a folly
to give it to the public.

279
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,688
Believe me.

280
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,853
Don't you agree with me, Seebruck?

281
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,146
I do, Jarmila.

282
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,066
As you say, today miss Klatt is not ready.

283
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,438
Not nearly ready.

284
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,152
But next week, Thursday,
I will present her

285
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,950
in "the boulevardier."

286
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,494
And please don't faint, either of you.

287
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,481
Mama Hinzl.

288
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,316
Yes.

289
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,230
What have you got there?

290
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,443
Angela's supper.

291
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,984
Nightingales must have
something solid to eat

292
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,980
if they are to sing.

293
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,822
Solid is right.

294
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,408
Fat sausages, buttered
buns, and rich chocolate.

295
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,276
Take it away.

296
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,528
You mean you are going to let her

297
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,279
go to the theater without eating?

298
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,371
That's no good for Angela.

299
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,616
It'll only make her fat.

300
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:30,912
Suppose it does.

301
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,957
Whoever heard of a good
prima Donna who wasn't fat?

302
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,252
Soprano and fat are
one and the same thing.

303
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,544
Look at me.

304
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,338
Get her lemon juice and honey.

305
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,505
Lemon juice.

306
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,562
come in.

307
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,971
- Angela, are you ready?
- Yes.

308
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:52,812
Where's my muff?

309
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:53,817
My muff.

310
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,355
Angela, don't be nervous now.

311
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,318
I'm not nervous, I feel fine.

312
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,983
Oh, you must be, 1
can't blame you for it.

313
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,605
You've been working so
hard, and you're excited.

314
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,527
I'm not excited.

315
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,445
Good, I'm not either.

316
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,282
I'm as calm as can be.

317
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,117
There's one thing I must impress on you.

318
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,078
When you cross in the beginning
of the number, you know,

319
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:11,074
when you cross to the girls,
and you get the mirror

320
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,666
from the girls and you go over to Jarmila

321
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,500
and you hold it in front of her.

322
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,334
Yeah, yeah.

323
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,623
Please, Angela, hold the mirror low.

324
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,711
We want to see your face.

325
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,126
Yes.

326
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,089
Oh, Franz.

327
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,048
Oh, Angela.

328
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,919
Oh, you're going to be wonderful,
and I'll be very proud.

329
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,261
Angela, Franz.

330
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,051
The carriage is here.

331
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,058
Coming.

332
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,969
Carl, a carriage?

333
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:32,970
Such extravagance.

334
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:33,812
Certainly.

335
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,398
Whoever heard of a prima
Donna walking to the theater?

336
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,642
Here you are, my little thrush.

337
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,109
Lemon juice and honey, drink it all.

338
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,650
Of course, I wouldn't put
this mess in my stomach,

339
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,693
but the maestro knows best.

340
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:44,531
Come, come, children.

341
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,991
You can't be late, Angela.

342
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:46,859
This is an event.

343
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,077
Good luck, darling.

344
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Goodbye.

345
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,951
Lemon juice.

346
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,276
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

347
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,363
Oh.

348
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,367
Sorry.

349
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,530
Angela Klatt.

350
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,079
The greatest voice in the world.

351
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,083
Quiet.

352
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,996
All right, girls, all right.

353
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,164
Places, please.

354
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,708
Thank you, thank you.

355
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,502
Jill?

356
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,011
Hello, Jill.

357
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,219

00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,006
Goodbye, my dear Jarmila.

437
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,125
Oh, are you going away?

438
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,592
No, but you are.

439
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:53,436
What do you think?

440
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,180
Count Seebruck,
I don't think, I know.

441
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,523
A new star is born.

442
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,436
It's unbelievable.

443
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:01,107
Her voice, I could close my
eyes and swear it's Marcellina.

444
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,729
You must feel it too.

445
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,026
I'm seriously
thinking of reviving

446
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,649
"the magic voice" for her.

447
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,276
Wonderful, wonderful.

448
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,828
come to the office tomorrow.

449
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,921
I need to talk to you about something.

450
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,165
Meanwhile, tonight...

451
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,009
She was magnificent.

452
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,635
Weren't you nervous, excited?

453
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,387
Both, I ate my program.

454
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,139
Oh, Leon, I forgot to buy her a present.

455
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,150
oh.

456
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,402
A jeweler open till midnight?

457
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:43,236
Yes.

458
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,650
He sells gifts to the men while they wait

459
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,398
for their sweethearts to come out.

460
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,150
Then, next day, he buys
them back from the girls

461
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,367
at one-half.

462
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,578
Each piece he sells over and over.

463
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,788
Well, he won't sell
my present over again.

464
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,622
oh.

465
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,456
Is he expensive?

466
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,290
Very.

467
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,456
But men in love don't question prices.

468
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,169
That's right, Leon.

469
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,191
I beg your pardon.

470
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,158
But you're miss Klatt, aren't you?

471
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,152
Yes.

472
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,825
I'm Dr. Hohnev.

473
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,619
Oh, yes, doctor, I'm sorry,
I didn't recognize you.

474
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,083
It's a rule of the theater
to have your throat examined

475
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,248
after each performance.

476
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,339
Now, if you don't mind, my
office is just around the corner.

477
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,836
Franz Munzer, my fiancé.

478
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,883
He should be waiting for you.

479
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:51,721
but if I'm not here...

480
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,636
- He'll wait.
- But, doctor, I...

481
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,385
I'm sorry, my dear, but count Seebruck

482
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,512
expects the report tonight.

483
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,060
I won't keep you a moment.

484
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,935
You know, I heard you sing tonight.

485
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:09,069
I haven't heard a voice
like that in 10 years.

486
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,441
Thank you, doctor.

487
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:14,411
You have a great career
ahead of you, my dear.

488
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,550
I hadn't thought a throat examination

489
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,597
would be necessary after the performance.

490
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,436
It's a rule of the royal theatre.

491
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,476
You are part of that theater now, my dear,

492
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,065
and you must obey its rules.

493
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,232
From now on, your music
must come before everything.

494
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,445
but what about Franz?

495
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,563
Oh, Franz, of course.

496
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,610
But that will come later.

497
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,161
It's hard to believe that it's 10 years

498
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:04,628
since I brought Marcellina
here after a great triumph.

499
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,416
Ah, Luise, his is miss Klatt.

500
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,510
How do you do, Luise?

501
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,753
Is that Marcellina?

502
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,970
Yes.

503
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:17,637
Perhaps I shouldn't say it,
and I don't say it boastfully,

504
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,680
but count Seebruck told me that my voice

505
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,303
reminded him of hers.

506
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,679
it's true.

507
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:26,650
That's why I behaved so rudely
that morning in the library.

508
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,190
T was certain it was Marcellina's voice

509
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,734
come back to life again.

510
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:35,029
That's a wonderful compliment, doctor.

511
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,070
You knew her very well, didn't you?

512
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,242
no one knew her better.

513
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,366
Now will you come with me?

514
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,004
Excuse me.

515
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,091
don't mind Luise.

516
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,757
She was Marcellina's maid and companion.

517
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,429
She worshiped her.

518
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,598
And as a reward for her
devotion, I brought her here

519
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,688
to keep house for me.

520
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,602
You're handy to
the theater, aren't you?

521
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,396
t have to be.

522
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,566
You songbirds are my
official responsibility.

523
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,029
And if I'm too busy to get away,

524
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:16,776
I can still hear the opera
through these ventilators.

525
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,199
It's like a
private performance, isn't it?

526
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,743
Oh, this is lovely.

527
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:26,084
that's Marcellina as Isolde.

528
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,043
She sang it beautifully.

529
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,631
She must be
very real to you, doctor.

530
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,670
Yes.

531
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,962
Let me show you.

532
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:40,633
I have souvenirs here of
every role she ever sang.

533
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,645
What do you think became
of Marcellina, doctor?

534
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:49,517
That is a mystery that
has never been solved.

535
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:09,168
She used this fan in Romeo and Juliet.

536
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,582
And this slipper is one of a pair

537
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,299
she wore in Mozart's nozze di figaro.

538
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,302
oh.

539
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,471
What tiny feet she must have had.

540
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,509
Like a child.

541
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,724
that's true.

542
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,728
A child.

543
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,597
What exquisite pearls.

544
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,850
She always wore them
in "the magic voice."

545
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,479
She had them on the night she disappeared.

546
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,230
How would you like to wear them

547
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,107
when you sing "the magic voice?"

548
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,450
I?

549
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,865
Perhaps I'm talking out of turn.

550
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:47,787
Seebruck told me tonight he
plans on reviving it with you.

551
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,788
oh.

552
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,037
Oh, I can't believe it.

553
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,506
Shall we try them on for luck?

554
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:02,597
She always wound them around
her throat, like this.

555
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,719
Her slender, graceful throat.

556
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,474
Exquisite to the touch.

557
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,798
I shouldn't keep Franz waiting so long.

558
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,219
I'm sorry.

559
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,138
I forgot all about him.

560
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,477
Now let's take a look at your throat.

561
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,314
I won't keep you another moment.

562
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,524
You'll be coming here regularly, you know.

563
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:58,520
From now on, I'm responsible
for your physical welfare.

564
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,113
Oh, just sit down there, my dear.

565
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,982
Then you're not going to operate on me?

566
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,825
of course not.

567
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,195
Well, all these things
are rather frightening.

568
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,118
I know exactly what you mean.

569
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:13,744
I feel the same way when
I go to the dentist's.

570
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:18,465
Now then, if you'll remove
your hat and loosen your cape.

571
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,725
Now then, sit back in the
chair and be comfortable.

572
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,567
This is only a routine examination.

573
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,107
It won't take long.

574
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:43,075
The light.

575
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,450
We're ready.

576
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,656
Now watch the light.

577
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,755
No, no, watch it.

578
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,750
I can't, it hurts my eyes.

579
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,592
It'll only be for a minute.

580
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:07,635
I want to relax you before
I examine your throat.

581
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,983
You don't mind it now, do you?

582
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,608
Rest, my dear.

583
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,530
Restore those tired and broken nerves.

584
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,958
Drive out all fear and weariness.

585
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:42,462
Chase away the shadows and
forms that exhaust our emotions

586
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,796
and enfeeble us.

587
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,338
That's better.

588
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,924
You're relaxing now.

589
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,761
Body, muscles, nerves, brain.

590
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,318
You don't resist anymore.

591
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,153
Gently slipping into another world,

592
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:18,126
a world of my design, where you
will be helpless without me.

593
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,917
Can you hear me?

594
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,921
Can you hear me?

595
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,306
Yes.

596
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,636
I hear you, doctor.

597
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:40,307
You don't
want to sing again, ever.

598
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:46,321
Tonight you give your
voice and your will to me.

599
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,906
I'm in control.

600
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,913
Your voice will no
longer answer your brain,

601
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,032
it will obey mine instead.

602
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,330
Look at the mirror.

603
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,874
Keep looking at it.

604
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,844
You will never try to sing again.

605
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,141
Say it.

606
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,311
I will never try to sing again.

607
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,727
That voice was never yours.

608
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,945
It belongs to Marcellina,
but it's leaving you.

609
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,489
I'm sending it back to her now.

610
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,742
It must be silenced forever.

611
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,126
I forbid you to sing again.

612
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,388
My throat.

613
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,930
t'll take care of that.

614
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,075
You will take this atomizer with you

615
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,034
and never be without it.

616
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,874
It will remind you of my control.

617
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,469
Shall we get up now?

618
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,230
I must have fallen asleep.

619
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,065
just what I wanted.

620
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,185
And my throat?

621
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,606
perfect.

622
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:54,529
I don't think it's going to
give us a bit of trouble.

623
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,116
Can I help you, doctor?

624
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,031
Yes, Luise.

625
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,076
Send miss Klatt home in the carriage.

626
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:46,876
♫ Ah, tell me why this
doubt should fall to me

627
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,547
♫ whose tragic ♫

628
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:55,339

632
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:16,611

633
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,826
jah ♫

634
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,435
Marcellina, it's come back.

635
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:54,527
That voice, that voice
to take you away from me.

636
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,066
But I won't let it.

637
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,280
T won't let it.

638
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,413
Carl, how can you sit there

639
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,327
when we don't even know
what's happened to her?

640
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,666
We know what happened.

641
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,125
She made a great success.

642
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,586
That is no reason to
disappear into thin air.

643
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,955
I'm going to the police.

644
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:15,916
here she is.

645
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,023
Angela, where have you been?

646
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,687
I'm sorry, Franz, really.

647
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,400
We were worried about you.

648
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,110
Please forgive me.

649
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:41,449
Of course, but won't
you tell me what happened?

650
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,658
t don't know.

651
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,284
you don't know?

652
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,327
Angela, I waited for you
at the theater for hours.

653
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,542
You must have gone someplace.

654
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:54,083
Let's not talk about it tonight, Franz.

655
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,126
I'm very tired.

656
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,419
Some other time.

657
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,731
Angela, forgive me.

658
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,901
I was so worried about
you, I forgot to tell you

659
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,364
how wonderful you were.

660
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,609
I was in the audience, you know.

661
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,703
You got five curtain calls.

662
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:32,576
Then when I left and waited
for you, I didn't wait so long.

663
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,754
Leon told me that across the street

664
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,248
there was a little jewelry shop

665
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,424
where men bought their
present, and then they,

666
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:44,546
well, for you.

667
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,315
To remind you of your first success.

668
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,817
My first success.

669
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,660
Oh, Franz.

670
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:09,821
Oh, my darling.

671
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,914
Please hold me tight.

672
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,783
Franz, I'm afraid.

673
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,830
Afraid of what?

674
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,212
t don't know.

675
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,848
They tell me she's young,
beautiful and really can sing.

676
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,715
Good morning, count.

677
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,887
May I have a statement for my newspaper?

678
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,806
Now, gentlemen, please.

679
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,394
But "the magic voice" has
been out of the repertory

680
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,729
for 10 years, hasn't it?

681
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,440
Yes, ever since la Marcellina's
strange disappearance.

682
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,650
And then you
found the new soprano.

683
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,440
Then I found miss Klatt.

684
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,937
Did you say "Klatt?"

685
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,754
Franz.

686
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,464
> Warriors bold ♫

687
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,709
♫ we are come to this garden fete ♫

688
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,510
♫ marching to love as we march to war ♫

689
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,304
good morning, my dear Jarmila.

690
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:16,145
Well, our baritone is
positively glowing this morning.

691
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,390
Glowing with new
admiration for you, my dear.

692
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,893
Few prima Donnas would confess so openly

693
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,519
they had anything to learn.

694
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:24,395
I salute you.

695
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,772
Anything to learn?

696
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,866
It takes character to
understudy a newcomer.

697
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:29,904
Understudy?

698
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:33,241
Your new soprano will never
sing "the magic voice."

699
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,079
no?

700
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:34,913
nol!

701
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,454
Seebruck's insane to even
consider letting a young,

702
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,667
inexperienced girl like that...

703
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,411
You forget, my dear,
that once upon a time,

704
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,629
you were young.

705
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,419

710
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,443
thank you, gentlemen.

711
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,278
Thank you.

712
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:09,194
This is followed by the
baritone solo and ballet.

713
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,987
Up there we have the sketches of the set.

714
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:11,859
Would you like to see them?

715
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,701
Not now.

716
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,787
The ballet is followed
by the soprano Aria.

717
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,621
We'll omit the baritone
solo and the ballet.

718
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,911
I want these gentlemen of
the press to hear miss Klatt.

719
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:19,749
of course.

720
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:20,584
Gentlemen.

721
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,795
We take it from the soprano Aria.

722
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,413
Signor Roselli on stage, please.

723
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,089
Attention, gentlemen.

724
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,674
The ladder back, please.

725
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,009
Miss Klatt!

726
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,423

♫ my heart was still my own ♫

730
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:14,343
♫ just hoping, vet afraid ♫

731
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,180
♫ of love ♫

732
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:18,096
♫ then I came and found you there ♫

733
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:23,064
♫ I called your name
and breathed a prayer

734
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:28,110
♫ I began to live

735
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:32,278
♫ the moment that I knew

736
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:36,402
♫ the clouds began to give

737
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:41,374
♫ the sun came shining through

738
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:42,912
♫ above ♫

739
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,332
♫ you were mine to have and hold ♫

740
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:50,299
♫ but even then, the sun grew cold ♫

741
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,675
♫ ah ♫

742
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:59,642
I tell me why this doubt
should fall to me ♫

743
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:03,099
♫ whose tragic power ♫

744
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,747
"Whose tragic power calls for me."

745
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:23,918
I'm sorry.

746
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,624
May I try that last part again?

747
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,247
Of course, my dear, of course.

748
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,802
♫ ah ♫

749
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,673
♫ tell me why this

750
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:54,780
Why, darling, what happened?

751
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,646
Angela, what happened?

752
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,231
My voice, it's gone.

753
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,771
that's ridiculous.

754
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:31,767
My voice, it's, it's gone!

755
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,610
Stop saying that and come here.

756
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:34,774
Franz.

757
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,147
What's the matter with me?

758
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,898
Nothing, people don't
lose their voices like that.

759
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,116
You've got to sing.

760
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,950
I can't, Franz.

761
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,320
For some reason, I don't want to sing.

762
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:43,331
Angela!

763
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,495
For me, darling.

764
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,161
Now, from the same place.

765
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,092
Jah ♫

766
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:05,059
I tell me why this doubt
should fall to me ♫

767
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,933
♫ whose tragic power ♫

768
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,331
Young man, how did you
get in this dressing room?

769
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,041
Do you realize that
by forcing her voice,

770
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,376
you might ruin it forever?

771
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,540
I'm only trying to help.

772
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,504
She lost her confidence, that's all.

773
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,873
Is that true, doctor?

774
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,545
Why do you think her voice broke?

775
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,544
High tension, nerves.

776
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:40,465
And it could be serious?

777
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,838
It could
be if not taken care of.

778
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,681
What do you advise, doctor?

779
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:47,677
A few days, at least, of absolute rest.

780
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:48,518
but rehearsal.

781
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,978
You can rehearse with the understudy.

782
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:50,812
But you won't have to.

783
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,681
I tell you she's perfectly all right.

784
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,854
It's quite obvious she's
not perfectly all right.

785
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,102
Her voice did break.

786
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,023
We all heard it.

787
00:51:57,031 --> 00:52:01,741
I would suggest that we
leave it to miss Klatt herself.

788
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:06,245
What with your nerves in this condition,

789
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,785
do you think you ought to sing?

790
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,001
t don't know.

791
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:17,590
Ti never felt like this before.

792
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,504
We'd better
send her home, Brunn.

793
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,341
Where does she live?

794
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:21,506
15 Hahnen street.

795
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,299
I'm afraid that won't do.

796
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,263
She must have professional care.

797
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,427
The hospital?

798
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:35,733
How would you like to come
home with me for a few days?

799
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,246
I'll come and see you, Angela.

800
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,959
I'd wait, my boy.

801
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,750
She needs complete rest.

802
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,997
That woman must have
blackmailed Seebruck

803
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,244
into giving her the part.

804
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,212
After the papers have
been full of nothing

805
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,424
but "the magic voice," Seebruck
will have to produce it.

806
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:43,258
but it isn't for her.

807
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,718
She can never sing the Aria.

808
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:45,837
They can lower the key.

809
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,054
But it's Angela's part.

810
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,299
There was nothing wrong with
her, until she met Hohner.

811
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,096
Dr. Hohner wants to help Angela.

812
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:53,059
Then why does he keep her locked up?

813
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,394
Why can't I go and see her?

814
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:57,356
She hasn't even answered my letters.

815
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,486
I'm going to take her
back where she belongs.

816
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,489
Franz!

817
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:53,995
Yes?

818
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,114
t would like to see Dr. Hohner.

819
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,956
Dr. Hohner never sees
patients at this hour.

820
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,915
But I'm not a patient.

821
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,457
It's a personal matter,
and it's very important.

822
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:01,579
What is it about?

823
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,921
Angela Klatt.

824
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:03,755
Angela Klatt?

825
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:06,000
I've got to see her.

826
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,093
I'm afraid you'll have
to come another time.

827
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,634
The doctor is just
leaving for the theater.

828
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,035
I've decided not to go to
the theater tonight, Luise.

829
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,746
Oh, but that was a
message from count Seebruck.

830
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,082
The new tenor has a sore throat.

831
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,086
oh.

832
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:45,922
Why don't you go home?

833
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,211
Now, why don't you go to the theater?

834
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,174
You should be there by now.

835
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,008
But, Franz...

836
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,468
Go on, don't worry about me.

837
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,507
I just want to see what happens.

838
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,515
Go on.

839
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:37,929
She's upstairs.

840
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:38,936
Hurry.

841
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,286
Angela.

842
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:06,833
Angela, it's Franz.

843
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:10,298
Angela, what's the
matter, don't you know me?

844
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,714
Good evening, Dr. Hohner.

845
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,302
Good evening, Leon.

846
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:15,341
Who is that singing?

847
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,055
that's the new tenor.

848
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,765
Well, there's nothing
wrong with his throat.

849
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:19,769
no sir.

850
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,850
Get her out of here
now before it's too late.

851
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,188
Angela, we're getting out of here.

852
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,181
t mustn't leave.

853
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,649
He doesn't want me to leave.

854
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,268
Let me stay, Franz, please let me stay.

855
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,985
I'll take you home
to mama hinzl and Carl.

856
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:31,978
Hurry.

857
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,025
Please hurry.

858
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,554
The back door.

859
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,561
Quickly.

860
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:10,775
To the left, out the door
and through the gate.

861
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,315
Thank you, Luise.

862
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,702
Dr. Hohner!

863
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,003
Dr. Hohner!

864
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,343
Dr. Hohner, she's gone.

865
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,632
How?

866
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,504
Where were you?

867
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,881
After you left, I
went down to the kitchen

868
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,257
to look after some things.

869
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,260
A little later, I came up to see her.

870
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,636
She wasn't here.

871
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,854
I searched everywhere, but she was gone.

872
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,223
They must have been
watching the house for days,

873
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,849
waiting for their chance.

874
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,647
Who brought that
message from the theater?

875
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,191
I don't know, I never saw him before.

876
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,859
Franz, the young fool.

877
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,074
What are you going to do?

878
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:01,996
Nothing.

879
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:06,619
That girl will obey me
no matter where she is.

880
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:21,217
I fixed you some nice hot soup, dear.

881
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,091
No, Franz.

882
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,933
You mustn't touch it.

883
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,178
Angela, it's just an atomizer.

884
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,397
He told me something about it.

885
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,062
Franz, what did he tell me?

886
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,776
Can't you remember?

887
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:36,739
t can't.

888
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,283
But I must.

889
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:41,616
It was very important.

890
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,736
Don't worry about it now.

891
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,954
Mama hinzl is going to give you your soup.

892
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,948
Franz, don't leave me.

893
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,915
All right, darling.

894
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,832
Now close your eyes and try to sleep.

895
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,625
Think of nothing else.

896
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:12,139
You saw the chemist?

897
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,482
It's water, uncle Carl,
plain everyday water.

898
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,486
Water?

899
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:19,949
Yes.

900
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,858
You are sure this came
out of the atomizer?

901
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,905
Yes, I took it out
when Angela was asleep.

902
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,278
I was sure there was something in there

903
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,496
that had stopped her
from singing, but now I,

904
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,118
oh, uncle Carl, what
is it, her imagination?

905
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,835
when did her voice break first?

906
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,830
When she was singing the Aria.

907
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,548
At rehearsal, with Hohner watching her.

908
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:39,962
Yes.

909
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,005
and the next time?

910
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,627
In her dressing room.

911
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,721
and Hohner walked in.

912
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:49,013
All this after she had been
to his office for treatment.

913
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,181
He must have frightened the child.

914
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,599
But why?

915
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,268
Marcellina.

916
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,276
The Aria.

917
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,481
Who can tell what goes on in a man's mind?

918
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,773
And who can prove it?

919
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,022
Oh, Carl, what are we going to do?

920
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,239
t don't know.

921
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:08,912
In the army, when a man
was thrown from a horse,

922
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,907
we put him right back on
the horse and made him ride.

923
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:12,907
and it worked?

924
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:13,999
Usually.

925
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:17,963
The longer a man waited, the
more difficult it became.

926
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:22,630
Something in his mind grew
into a terrible mental hazard.

927
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,878
Men, horses, I know.

928
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,176
But it's different with singers.

929
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,674
Why should it be different with singers?

930
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,970
The same hazard.

931
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,602
Of course

932
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:33,606
that's it.

933
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,606
Franz, where are you going?

934
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:37,610
Wait for me!

935
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,610
What you ask is not only
impossible, it's fantastic.

936
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,529
But the girl is very ill.

937
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,072
We not only ask you to save her career,

938
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,535
but her life as well.

939
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,825
Dr. Hohner tells me she's
lost her voice beyond recovery.

940
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,539
Dr. Hohner is wrong.

941
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,999
Let's be reasonable about this thing.

942
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:57,745
All I demand is a chance to hear her sing.

943
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,213
I've asked you to bring
her here to my office.

944
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:03,175
But no, you must have my
company, my orchestra, lights,

945
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:07,012
a full performance for your
experiment before an audience.

946
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:09,882
It's absolutely out of the question.

947
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,303
That will be all, gentlemen.

948
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:12,141
But, count Seebruck...

949
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,145
Franz.

950
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,146
I told you it was a hopeless task.

951
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,142
Well we gave him his chance.

952
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,690
Now he has only himself to blame.

953
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,857
We're going over his head.

954
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,401
but who is over his head?

955
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,238
The king.

956
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:27,653
The king?

957
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:31,779
Do you mean to say we
should ask the king himself?

958
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,441
Hundreds of us got the same decoration.

959
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,563
And it wasn't him.

960
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,405
It was his father who gave it to me.

961
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,650
Just stick your chest out.

962
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,697
I'm going to lose my job.

963
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,161
Seebruck will discharge me.

964
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,450
You must have been much
braver when you were young.

965
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,039
No one is permitted in this corridor

966
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,533
until his majesty has left the theater.

967
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:21,628
Oh, but his majesty will
Grant him an audience.

968
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,461
you should know better.

969
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:26,549
You will have to make
your petition in writing.

970
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:29,295
Gentlemen, his majesty the king.

971
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:00,705
Well, one of the heroes from Sadova.

972
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,828
Yes, your majesty.

973
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,581
Second cavalry, blue hussars.

974
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:06,547
Yes, your majesty.

975
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,666
I am sorry, your majesty.

976
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,009
This corridor should have
been cleared of petitioners.

977
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:14,347
One of my father's old guard
may talk to me at any time.

978
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:16,512
Now, what can I do for you?

979
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,804
It's about a singer.

980
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:18,892
A young lady.

981
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:20,262
We are in love.

982
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:24,228
No, the young lady and I are in love.

983
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,566
Oh, I see.

984
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:29,028
Well, in that case, shall we step in here?

985
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,539
Oh, this performance will be known

986
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,337
as the most dismal fiasco
in the entire history

987
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:52,381
of the royal theatre.

988
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,301
This will really make me immortal.

989
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,798
Seebruck, I want to talk to you.

990
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,346
This is the last straw, and I don't intend

991
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:59,638
to stand for it any longer.

992
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:02,183
There's no clause in my
contract that calls for insults.

993
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,181
Why, my name is on every
billboard, and this,

994
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:06,183
this nobody is singing in my place.

995
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:07,183
Do you know what I'm going to do?

996
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:09,231
I'm going to leave here
and never come back.

997
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,525
I wish to heaven I could go with you.

998
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:12,648
Oh, you sent for me?

999
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,489
Yes.

1000
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:14,778
Here, read this.

1001
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:22,703
A command performance.

1002
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,450
It's unbelievable.

1003
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,292
what shall I do?

1004
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,411
What can I do?

1005
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:31,170
I would suggest that you
have madame Jarmila stand by.

1006
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,384
Stand by, and let her make a fool of me?

1007
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:37,222
you don't have to bother about that.

1008
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:41,013
It will not be possible
for that girl to sing.

1009
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,142
How'd she take it?

1010
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,390
t don't know.

1011
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,187
I haven't told her anything except

1012
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,810
that we're going to the theater.

1013
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:54,197
Oh, mama hinzl, I don't want to go.

1014
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,111
You run along with Franz.

1015
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,279
See your friends.

1016
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,322
Hear some music.

1017
01:05:58,329 --> 01:05:59,489
It will do you good.

1018
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,078
You look wonderful, Angela.

1019
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,288
Good night, mama hinzl.

1020
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,327
Good night.

1021
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,581
But how will I get to the theater?

1022
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:11,047
Just walk if you have
to, but leave them alone.

1023
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,631
but mama hinzl.

1024
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:44,330
Good evening, miss Klatt.

1025
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,164
Good evening, Leon.

1026
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:46,783
Count Seebruck wants to see you.

1027
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:47,874
Where is he?

1028
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,369
Dressing room 22.

1029
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,836
Thank you, Leon.

1030
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,381
Good evening, miss Klatt.

1031
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:03,599
Please come in.

1032
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,599
This is Count Romborg,
aide-de-camp to his majesty.

1033
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,305
enchanted.

1034
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:11,182
Miss Klatt, you are
commanded by his majesty

1035
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,435
to sing "the magic voice" tonight.

1036
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:14,276
I?

1037
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,110
Sing?

1038
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,945
Yes, a command performance.

1039
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,781
but I can't.

1040
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,992
But it his his majesty's orders.

1041
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:24,158
My congratulations, miss Klatt.

1042
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,701
This is a great honor, my dear.

1043
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:26,788
But, count Seebruck...

1044
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:28,454
The king.

1045
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,417
I'll send a maid to you.

1046
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:32,916
Mr. Brunn.

1047
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:34,835
Now, now, your wardrobe is all ready.

1048
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:36,378
I'll see you on the stage.

1049
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:37,386
Good luck.

1050
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:44,431
Franz, I'm afraid.

1051
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:45,265
No, you're not.

1052
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,761
You're probably as surprised as I am.

1053
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:50,479
As count Seebruck said,
this is a great honor.

1054
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:53,691
The king sends his aide-de-camp
to command you to sing.

1055
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:55,276
But that's why I'm afraid.

1056
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,486
I can't sing.

1057
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,444
Of course you can.

1058
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:58,813
The minute you're out
there before the audience

1059
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:01,157
and hear that music, you'll sing.

1060
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,741
Everybody wants you to.

1061
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,827
Look, they're all thinking of you.

1062
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,617
They send you their good wishes.

1063
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:07,624
Here.

1064
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:13,336
Here, flowers from Seebruck,
from Brunn, from Roselli.

1065
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,797
Flowers even from his majesty.

1066
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,430
Franz, what's that?

1067
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:28,552
Another present, I
suppose, we'll soon find out.

1068
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:45,281
That is just like the
one you have at home.

1069
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,992
Now I broke your present.

1070
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,117
I'm sorry, that was very clumsy of me.

1071
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:54,671
Angela.

1072
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:59,503
Was that very important?

1073
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,468
Dr. Hohner told me something about it.

1074
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:03,632
My voice.

1075
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,256
Oh, that's just broken glass
and a little colored water.

1076
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,177
Listen.

1077
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:10,598
Whatever Dr. Hohner said is
past and gone, just like that.

1078
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,516
Tonight is the night you've
worked and studied for,

1079
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,354
the night we dreamed of.

1080
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,474
Do you know why "the magic voice"

1081
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:16,850
hasn't been performed for 10 years?

1082
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:18,226
Because there was no one to sing it,

1083
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,943
and now the king commands you to sing it.

1084
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,027
That's what you've got to do.

1085
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:24,365
So forget Dr. Hohner, forget everything.

1086
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:25,825
Everything but me.

1087
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:30,079
Of course, Franz.

1088
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:31,573
And I'll really try.

1089
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:32,994
I know you will.

1090
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,833
And you'll be wonderful.

1091
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,122
Now get dressed.

1092
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,882
I'll call you when I'm changed.

1093
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:47,630
How is she?

1094
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:48,472
fine.

1095
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:50,057
Everything is going to
work out as we planned.

1096
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:51,972
I have fixed a place
in the wings for you,

1097
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:54,095
where Angela can see you while she sings.

1098
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:55,688
Come, I'll show you.

1099
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,731
just a moment.

1100
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,984
Count Seebruck sent me to miss Klatt.

1101
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:09,531
You may help the ballet girls.

1102
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:10,574
yes madame.

1103
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,554
I came to help you dress.

1104
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:42,023
The last time I saw Marcellina,
she was standing right here,

1105
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:44,145
in a dress just like that.

1106
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:48,070
You're as beautiful as she was.

1107
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,113
Thank you, Luise.

1108
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:51,327
I'll take this.

1109
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,576
Would you ask Franz to
come in now, please?

1110
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:55,584
Yes.

1111
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:12,028
I've come to help you, my dear.

1112
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:15,574
It's cruel of them to do this to you.

1113
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:18,823
You don't want to sing, do you?

1114
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,372
But I promised Franz I'd try.

1115
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:26,373
Of course you did, my dear.

1116
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:28,750
But Franz doesn't understand.

1117
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:33,175
You're in no condition to sing, are you?

1118
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:37,850
t don't know.

1119
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,017
I only know I promised Franz I'd try.

1120
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:46,317
Dr. Hohner, don't look at me like that!

1121
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,320
Franz!

1122
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:53,191
what does Franz know about it?

1123
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,991
Why, you're trembling, shaking.

1124
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,991
Your nerves have gone to pieces.

1125
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:08,336
I warned Franz what would
happen if he forced you to sing.

1126
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:16,430
You don't want to ruin that voice, do you?

1127
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,888
It isn't yours, remember?

1128
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:24,733
Now tell me.

1129
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,691
Whose voice is it?

1130
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:29,905
Tell me.

1131
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,445
Marcellina's.

1132
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,604

1152
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,082
she ought to be ready by now.

1153
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:19,178
Yes, I want to rehearse
the Aria once more, anyway.

1154
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,512
Angela, are you ready?

1155
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,519
Angela.

1156
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:27,856
Angela!

1157
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,020
Angela!

1158
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,234
where is she?

1159
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:41,578
Hohnev.

1160
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:48,915
Have you seen Dr. Hohner?

1161
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:50,034
Not tonight.

1162
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,380
I want to borrow this.

1163
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,384
Carll

1164
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:01,758
this time, I'll silence it forever.

1165
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:17,947
murderer.

1166
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,190
I suspected you from the first

1167
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:23,864
and came here as your
servant to make sure.

1168
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:26,283
For 10 years, I've watched and waited.

1169
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,201
You kept your secret well
until the first night

1170
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:30,700
you brought Angela here,
when you showed the pearls

1171
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:33,498
Marcellina had on when she disappeared.

1172
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,713
You took them off her body.

1173
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,213
I'm not afraid of you.

1174
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,929
I needed more evidence for the police.

1175
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,514
I got it tonight when I followed you here

1176
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:49,306
from the dressing room, in
time to save this child.

1177
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:51,144
You killed Marcellina.

1178
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:53,605
You'll never say that again.

1179
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:59,441
Dr. Hohner!

1180
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,029
Angela, are you all right?

1181
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:01,863
You should be at the theater.

1182
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:02,982
You're singing "the magic voice" tonight.

1183
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:03,823
She can't sing.

1184
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:04,658
Ti won't let her.

1185
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:06,448
She will sing, and you can't stop her.

1186
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,741
If this girl sings,
I won't be responsible.

1187
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:09,579
it will.

1188
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:10,868
Carl, watch him.

1189
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:12,783
Get back, doctor.

1190
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:13,795
This way.

1191
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:23,336
My dear Jarmila, what
a great night for you.

1192
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,133
Yes, when your little
miss nobody breaks down,

1193
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,597
I go on to save your face.

1194
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,715
Why no, not at all.

1195
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:29,637
You've always wanted to
sing "the magic voice."

1196
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,431
This is your great opportunity.

1197
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:32,393
and what an audience!

1198
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:33,387
Haven't I always said that hers

1199
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:34,764
is the greatest voice in the country?

1200
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:35,685
In the country, count Seebruck?

1201
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:37,308
In the world, in the world.

1202
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,275
What about your brilliant new discovery?

1203
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,315
Forget about her.

1204
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,653
Forget about everything.

1205
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,773
Go out there and cover
yourself with glory.

1206
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,649
Thrill the king and that
distinguished audience

1207
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:49,199
with the golden voice
of the great Jarmila.

1208
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,537
All right.

1209
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:51,541
I'll do it.

1210
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:55,701
But not for you, or for the king.

1211
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:57,419
For Jarmila.

1212
01:17:57,423 --> 01:17:58,423
Brava.

1213
01:18:57,358 --> 01:18:58,643
Send the police to Dr. hohner's.

1214
01:18:58,651 --> 01:18:59,481
yes sir.

1215
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,315
Where have you been?

1216
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:01,274
We've looked everywhere for you.

1217
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,360
This is a command
performance for the king.

1218
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:04,729
You've just time to make your entrance.

1219
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,480
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.

1220
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:08,448
Luise, take care of her.

1221
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,623
What about me and my golden voice?

1222
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:22,417
Do you think I'm going to stand
here and let that little...

1223
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,039
shh!

1224
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:25,051
The king.

1225
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:29,135
She ought to be there by now.

1226
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:31,221
Don't go on that stage.

1227
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:33,841
Your voice will break, I warn you.

1228
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,717
Don't go on that stage.

1229
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,367
I forbid you to sing.

1230
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:00,868
Do you hear?

1231
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,665
I forbid you to sing.

1232
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:03,673
sit down.

1233
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:16,967
Repeat the cue.

1234
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:29,776
♫ Aah, we bid you welcome to this fete

1235
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:33,321
♫ ah, we're sorry if we made you wait ♫

1236
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:39,866
♫ ah, let violins begin the dance ♫

1237
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:43,586
♫ ah, let there be joy and gay romancing ♫

1238
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:18,112
♫ I was all alone

1239
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:22,241
♫ a blindly groping maid ♫

1240
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:26,086
♫ my heart was still my own ♫

1241
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:30,459
♫ just hoping, vet afraid ♫

1242
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:31,629
♫ of love ♫

1243
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:34,549
♫ then I came and found you there ♫

1244
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:39,516
♫ I called your name
and breathed a prayer

1245
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:44,350
♫ I began to live

1246
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:48,692
♫ the moment that I knew

1247
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:53,029
♫ the clouds began to give

1248
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:57,993
♫ the sun came shining through

1249
01:21:58,247 --> 01:21:59,487
♫ above ♫

1250
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:02,114
♫ you were mine to have and hold ♫

1251
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:07,086
♫ but even then, the sun grew cold ♫

1252
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,915
jah ♫

1253
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:15,841
I tell me why this doubt
should fall to me ♫

1254
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:21,392
♫ whose tragic power seems to call to me ♫

1255
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,432
she made it.

1256
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:29,399
Her fear of you is gone.

1257
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:32,645
♫ this says it all for me ♫

1258
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:35,022
♫ I love you ♫

1259
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:40,778
sing, Angela!

1260
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:41,789
Sing!

1261
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:48,585
♫ everything is clearing ♫

1262
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:52,127
♫ now, at last ♫

1263
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:56,047
♫ paradise is nearing ♫

1264
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:59,387
♫ I cling ♫
 
1265
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:04,181
♫ to your love ♫

1266
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:07,555
♫ while I sing ♫

1267
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,022
up the stairs.

1268
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:11,733
♫ Of my yearning ♫

1269
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,822
Marcellina, they're here.

1270
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:22,865
They're here.

1271
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:02,485
♫ now, at last ♫

1272
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,493
♫ gone is all confusion ♫

1273
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:11,870
♫ and the past'

1274
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:16,169
♫ fades like some illusion ♫

1275
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:19,919
♫ and you ♫

1276
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:24,299
♫ are my life ♫

1277
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:28,052
♫ and my dream ♫

1278
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,600
♫ come.

1279
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:35,567
♫ true ♫

1280
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,445
♫ is you ♫

1281
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:14,275
Brava
