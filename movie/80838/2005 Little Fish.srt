Ray's 30.
My baby's 30.

341
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:42,913
Five years ago
on this night,

342
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:44,846
I stayed in a hospital
emergency room

343
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:47,248
not knowing
if you were gonna live.

344
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:52,412
I never wanna go
through another night
like that in my life.

345
00:25:53,925 --> 00:25:54,949
It was a bad night.

346
00:25:55,027 --> 00:25:56,858
Bad night.

347
00:25:58,463 --> 00:26:00,761
And three years
of rehab for Ray and me.

348
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:05,634
People from the past
knocking at the door.

349
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:12,100
I suppose
you think about it.
The accident.

350
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:14,610
Every day, Janelle.

351
00:26:18,717 --> 00:26:21,117
So, when do you start work?

352
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:23,677
Friday.
I n the city.

353
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:28,419
So I suppose now
you'll be moving out
to Stratfield, somewhere.

354
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:29,687
I don't know.

355
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:31,854
I'm just staying
with Kim and J une
for now.

356

You probably have noticed this
but people have been running
from this place.

357
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:38,462
Almost everyone.
All the houses
have changed hands.

358
00:26:38,537 --> 00:26:41,904
Or kicking themselves.
Prices around here
have gone up.

359
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:44,669
People just want
the best they can
for their families.

That's not what I meant.

362
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:51,781
Five years ago
one's nearly killed
in a car crash.

363
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,718
Other one is about to become
a fully blind junkie
or find himself in jail.

364
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:58,950
Or maybe bloody both!
So, what do I do?

365
00:26:59,024 --> 00:27:01,322
Can I send them off
to a rich family overseas?

366
00:27:01,393 --> 00:27:02,758
No.

367
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:05,592
Can I get Tracy
into the clinics
to get her clean? No!

368
00:27:05,664 --> 00:27:07,598
Mom, sit down.

369
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:10,260
It'll be alright.
No matter what you do,

370
00:27:10,335 --> 00:27:12,496

to smooth it over.

371

Get it, sign the check.

That would be alright.

373
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:19,504
Maybe you shouldn't
have married such
a loser asshole then.

374
00:27:19,578 --> 00:27:22,046
You gonna blame your dad
for the rest of your life?

375
00:27:22,114 --> 00:27:24,878
Probably yeah.

376
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,283
Janelle, you would have done
the same things
if you had the money.

377
00:27:28,353 --> 00:27:30,651
But I don't.
I didn't, I never did.

these people.

I can't get the loan, mom.

1131
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:09,691
Does it mean no?

1132
01:22:09,765 --> 01:22:11,255
[Sniffs]

1133
01:22:16,805 --> 01:22:19,774
Is it so bad?
I mean, you still got
your job.

1134
01:22:19,841 --> 01:22:23,868
You're the manager.
That's quite an achievement.

1135
01:22:23,945 --> 01:22:26,072
I don't want
to just have a job!

1136
01:22:26,148 --> 01:22:29,549
Four years
I've been working
in that place!

1137
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:35,283
Turning up on time.
Spending hours
chained up in there.

1138
01:22:41,263 --> 01:22:43,629
What do you want, Tracy?

1139
01:22:48,103 --> 01:22:50,663
I wanna turn up on Monday

1140
01:22:50,739 --> 01:22:53,970
with enough cash
to be an owner
of that business.

1141
01:22:57,679 --> 01:22:58,907
What else?

1142
01:23:04,119 --> 01:23:07,088
When Jonny was here
the other night,

1143
01:23:07,155 --> 01:23:11,057
shit, I gave him
a hard time.

1144
01:23:11,126 --> 01:23:14,323
And I thought
to myself afterwards,
"Where did that come from?"

1145
01:23:16,431 --> 01:23:19,992
I haven't seen you
these last few days
since he's been back.

1146
01:23:23,638 --> 01:23:26,106
Mom!

1147
01:23:27,743 --> 01:23:29,904
I see a bit
of my little girl back.

1148
01:23:29,978 --> 01:23:34,176
Yeah.

1149
01:23:34,249 --> 01:23:36,615
Well, it's not that easy, mom.
I mean, you know.

1150
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:39,682
No, it's not.

1151
01:23:50,332 --> 01:23:52,323
You would've done
something different

1152
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,732
if you could've,
wouldn't you?

1153
01:23:56,304 --> 01:23:58,636
You would've changed
thing for you?

1154
01:23:58,707 --> 01:24:00,834
[Whispering]
Of course.

1155
01:24:03,512 --> 01:24:08,711
Trace, it's your life.
Darling, it's no one else's.

1156
01:24:36,311 --> 01:24:39,474
[Beeps]

1157
01:24:49,224 --> 01:24:50,418
Got your card?

1158
01:24:50,492 --> 01:24:52,084
Yeah.

1159
01:24:56,965 --> 01:25:01,527
You've got $15 in overdue.
Do you want to fix it
a month?

1160
01:25:01,603 --> 01:25:04,265
Would you pay
a couple of dollars
off it today?

1161
01:25:05,407 --> 01:25:06,874
Alright.

1162
01:25:06,942 --> 01:25:08,876
This guy
will fix it.

1163
01:25:10,245 --> 01:25:11,303
Thanks for this.

1164
01:25:11,379 --> 01:25:13,040
No worries
I need the money.

1165
01:25:13,114 --> 01:25:14,547
How much is here?

1166
01:25:14,616 --> 01:25:16,379
(Tracy)
Eight.

1167
01:25:17,519 --> 01:25:19,009
So, do you bring it back?

1168
01:25:19,087 --> 01:25:20,816
Yeah, we got a buyer.

1169
01:25:23,592 --> 01:25:24,820
How far out is it?

1170
01:25:24,893 --> 01:25:27,885
A couple of hours.
South.

1171
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:32,662
Okay, I'm coming with you.

1172
01:25:34,502 --> 01:25:35,560
No, she's not.

1173
01:25:39,407 --> 01:25:41,739
I go where that money goes.

1174
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:43,437
Fuck!

<i>Okay, Tania, it's discussed</i>
<i>if we don't reach the reserve.</i>

1176
01:25:50,585 --> 01:25:53,748
(Tania)
You talk to him.
You have law in negotiations.

1177
01:25:53,822 --> 01:25:55,187
I can't go there today.

1178
01:25:56,558 --> 01:25:59,391
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

1179
01:26:00,795 --> 01:26:03,662
Oh, this is very exciting.

1180
01:26:11,339 --> 01:26:14,103
U h!

1181
01:26:14,175 --> 01:26:15,699
What did you do that for?

1182
01:26:15,777 --> 01:26:18,245
'Cause you're here
and you fucking shouldn't be.

1183
01:26:18,313 --> 01:26:20,406
Fucking hurt my head.
Is it bleeding?

1184
01:26:20,482 --> 01:26:23,610
Why are you in my house?

1185
01:26:23,685 --> 01:26:25,175
It was a fucking shit week.

1186
01:26:25,253 --> 01:26:28,245
I've heard
from credible sources
that you aren't retiring.

1187
01:26:28,323 --> 01:26:32,259
That makes you
a full blind prick, you know.

1188
01:26:32,327 --> 01:26:33,726
Say it again.

1189
01:26:33,795 --> 01:26:36,127
You heard me.

1190
01:26:39,401 --> 01:26:44,839
Lionel, who told you
I wasrt retiring?

1191
01:26:47,676 --> 01:26:50,201
You should talk
to Steven.

1192
01:26:54,249 --> 01:26:55,978
Alright.

1193
01:26:56,051 --> 01:26:59,646
Let's have a look at that.
That's alright.

1194
01:26:59,721 --> 01:27:02,019
I kind of liked it.

1195
01:27:22,777 --> 01:27:25,803
Come with me.
I'll sort you out.

1196
01:28:06,454 --> 01:28:10,823
Steven, If I drive down
to my place at M ilton,

1197
01:28:10,892 --> 01:28:13,190
what am I gonna find there?

1198
01:28:13,261 --> 01:28:15,320
Don't know.
I haven't been there
in years.

1199
01:28:15,397 --> 01:28:17,297
Well, they asked me.

1200
01:28:17,365 --> 01:28:20,027

how much you earn.

I know how much
your fucking mortgage is.

You tell me everything,
you bloody idiot.

J ust tell me the truth.

under my name
behind my fucking back?

to worry about, Bradley.

Alright.

Drive the car.

Yeah, but you know
what you said to Steven.

Like you said
I've been in situations.
