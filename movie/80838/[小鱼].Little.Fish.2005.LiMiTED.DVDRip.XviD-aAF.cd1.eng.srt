1
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:26,368
C'mon!

2
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:29,408
C'mon! I got a baby-sitter.

3
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,530
I don't wanna go.

4
00:02:30,602 --> 00:02:32,163
I don't wanna go
on my own.

5
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:34,603
Trace!

6
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:37,536
You got some clothes here,
haven't ya?

7
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:39,368
C'mon, show us!

8
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:42,980
Hey, Tran, don't you reckon Tracy
should come to the school reunion?

9
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:44,514
Yeah.

10
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:45,765
Is that right?

11
00:02:45,837 --> 00:02:47,245
Tracy never goes out.

12
00:02:55,406 --> 00:02:57,863
Listen.
We'll have a look here.

13
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,294
You're alright?

14
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,569
Yeah!
Good.

15
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:08,752
Good Evening.
Can I have you bags, please?

16
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:13,898
What have you got there?

17
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:15,496
This one.

18
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:15,511
G'day.

19
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:16,560
How was it?

20
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:18,008
It was okay.

21
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:19,385
Did she behave herself?

22
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:21,043
Yeah, not a problem.

23
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:22,063
How was that?

24
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,027
It was alright.

25
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:25,879
Can we go?

26
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:26,896
I'll drive.

27
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:28,183
Can you give
me a ride home?

28
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:30,902
No. You can walk, fatso.

29
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,078
Excuse me.
Come here.

30
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:37,557
I had a message from
Lionel Dawson on my phone.

31
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:41,309
How did he get my number?

32
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:57,470
<i>Hey, girl,
It's a new world</i>

33
00:04:57,534 --> 00:05:00,502
<i>let's have a little fun</i>

34
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:02,910
<i>Don't stay hitting away</i>

35
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:04,918
They play this one.
You should come.

36
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:07,132
I wish you were there.

37
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,852
You're gonna stay
very long?

38
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,085
Kind of got sick of this.
I thought you were dead.

39
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:19,676
I got my sun messy.

40
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:21,372
Mom was there.

41
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:23,299
I had to drive her home.

42
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:27,193
Well, I gave her another call
but no, she didn't call back.

43
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:28,543
You should go see her.

44
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,237
Yeah.

45
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:32,097
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that.

46
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:40,375
What's up?

47
00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:42,650
Nah!

48
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:47,136
Someone's, you know,
dropping something off for me.

49
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:51,234
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

50
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:55,652
I didn't know
you were coming.

51
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:02,757
Go on, right on the front room.

52
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:08,992
Sorry, darling.

53
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:14,435
Just a moment, Steven.

54
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:19,464
Brad!

55
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:21,794
What an honor.

56
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:26,186
Lionel.

57
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,115
I'll get you a drink.

58
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,908
Working hard?

59
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:45,511
I've sold quite
a few jerseys this week.

60
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,329
Take the pressure off.

61
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,093
Li!

62
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:54,792
Lionel!

63
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:55,945
Tracy!

64
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:14,282
It's all yours now, mate.

65
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:17,833
Yeah, partnership's dissolved.
I understand.

66
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:20,046
It's all up to you now.

67
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:25,710
So, that's it.

68
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,747
Yeah, you're retiring.
That's great!

69
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,340
As to this
particular arrangement.

70
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:36,593
That's it.
The enamel packages.

71
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,221
This is not for me.

72
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:42,484
Yeah. Interesting timing. Like I've
been making arrangements for detox.

73
00:07:47,222 --> 00:07:49,711
Yeah, I'm fine.

74
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,540
I reckon this will be good for us.

75
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,972
Clear the air.

76
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:57,141
Won't be so dependant
at last.

77
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:58,901
You'll have more time
not working.

78
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:01,171
We can take up golf.

79
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,509
Snooker.

80
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:05,171
Fucking bridge.

81
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,683
You're alright, then.

82
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:12,124
Yeah, I couldn't be happier.

83
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:28,695
It just began.

84
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,896
Good luck, mate.

85
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,900
Steven.

86
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:15,798
Fuck!

87
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:18,876
Sorry. I... forgot
you were there.

88
00:09:18,946 --> 00:09:20,376
Yeah, you did.

89
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:34,852
It's you, ey?

90
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,472
Shinny girl.

91
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:39,840
I've gotta go.

92
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:43,171
I have to stay.
It was spectacular.

93
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,182
Jesus Christ, Lionel!

94
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:48,126
Don't get on
when I'm here, alright?

95
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:49,890
You wait till I go!

96
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:52,031
I thought
you'd go in there and-

97
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:55,264
Do you want this?

98
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:56,579
No.

99
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:58,176
I'll see ya.

100
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:59,678
See ya, love.

101
00:10:27,596 --> 00:10:29,452
<i>Trace, are you up?</i>

102
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:10,128
<i>Tracy, this business plan
Is good,</i>

103
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:12,913
<i>It's very good, You've
obviously done a lot of research,</i>

104
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,388
<i>It's very impressive,</i>

105
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:16,012
<i>And this address
where you live,</i>

106
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:17,772
<i>Is this rented property?</i>

107
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:21,456
That's my mom's house.
It's rented, yeah.

108
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,276
In the last four years
there's steady employment,

109
00:11:27,349 --> 00:11:30,645
but there's no savings,
no capital.

110
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,977
You don't own a car?

111
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:35,468
No, I've had some debts
to pay off.

112
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:38,193
We do a credit check
on all loan applications

113
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,911
and it is quite colorful
your file, Tracy.

114
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,112
This isn't really really
safe estimate.

115
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:45,972
Did you, did you see these?

116
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,244
We get people coming in
to the shop all the time

117
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:51,925
asking if we've got internet,
'cause we're so close to the station.

118
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,969
The nearest place is-

119
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,705
It's-

120
00:11:58,774 --> 00:12:02,192
Tracy, this is not a personal
decision. This is the bank's policy.

121
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:04,437
I cannot approve
an unsecured line

122
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,873
against someone
with your history.

123
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:12,470
Sorry.

124
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:14,808
Look, if you can come back
with some collateral

125
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:16,667
we might be able
to talk again.

126
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:20,788
But the way it's currently
structured I can't approve that loan.

127
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:24,881
Okay?

128
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:30,293
What?

129
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:33,880
No, no, I won't do it.

130
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:36,667
No, Ray,
I said no.

131
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,299
<i>Hey, Trace,</i>

132
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:45,401
The manager said
the plan was, uhm,

133
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:48,854
What did he say?
It's impressive.

134
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:51,198
Impressive?

135
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,804
So, we'll sign off
our new shop on Monday.

136
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:57,596
That gives you a week.

137
00:12:57,664 --> 00:13:00,567
Will the bank be able to
transfer the money by then?

138
00:13:00,642 --> 00:13:03,294
By Monday?
Yeah!

139
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:08,281
Oh! Did you tell
your mom?

140
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,418
Trace... did you call
you mom?

141
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,832
Yeah, on the mobile.

142
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,978
Net one plan.

143
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:23,611
Do they have any computers
can we actually fit in there?

144
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:25,474
Some shoes
for your brother.

145
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:35,708
Ray gets his shoes done by that guy
of the street. I'm seeing him tonight.

146
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:37,246
How is he going?
Come on, kids.

147
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,266
Ray is Ray.

148
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:40,132
Grab your bags.

149
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:42,174
Hey, thanks for opening up
this morning.

150
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:44,005
No problem.

151
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:47,968
That'd be 12.

152
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:48,988
Sorry?

153
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:51,813
Computers.
Next door.

154
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,791
Cool.
I'll see ya.

155
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:55,688
See ya.

156
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:58,721
Girls!
Wait up.

157
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:22,976
Hello.
Ray Heart speaking.

158
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:24,962
This is where I work.

159
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:27,971
You get down here and get
the shit out of my shop.

160
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:29,903
Do you hear me, Ray?

161
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:34,603
Yeah. I'll get back to you in about five
minutes, alright? I'll call you straight back.

162
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:37,164
Shit.

163
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,060
Okay?

164
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,729
Forty'd be good.

165
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,903
What do you say?

166
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:49,419
See you tonight?

167
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,984
Yeah, give us a kiss.

168
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:54,606
Is it alright if I bring
a friend over for dinner?

169
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:56,330
Friend?

170
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,125
Yeah, I do have him.

171
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:00,847
Good. It's okay.

172
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:02,539
See you tonight.

173
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:06,602
Hi, Trace.

174
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:09,325
Don't hang up on me, Ray.
You get down here

175
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:11,498
and get this fucking shit
out of my shop

176
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,546
or I'll throw it
in the bin.

177
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,144
Just get here.

178
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:18,286
I have to get a bus. I've only got
ten bucks to last me 'till Friday

179
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:22,283
and it's Tuesday. Can you hold on
to it 'till tonight for me, Trace?

180
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:24,179
It'd be a birthday present.

181
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:26,701
Last time, Ray.

182
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,991
Sorry.
Your password?

183
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:10,008
Oh, Jesus Christ.

184
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:22,867
I suppose a cup of tea
is out of the question.

185
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,661
How's Ray?

186
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:35,385
He's good.

187
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,245
It's his birthday today.

188
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:44,285
There's milk if you-

189
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:47,164
No, still have it black.

190
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:00,473
Tracy's doing well?

191
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,900
Yes, she is. Lionel,
what are you doing here?

192
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,748
Just came round to
say hello, that's all.

193
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:08,793
Say hello.

194
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:16,451
Haven't been to a show
in years.

195
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,886
You and the kids
and me.

196
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:21,925
Had some times, ey?

197
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:24,672
Mainly in club
and races.

198
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:26,749
Beach.

199
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:32,508
I miss you.

200
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:36,196
Lionel, you gave my daughter
heroin.

201
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,694
Yeah.

202
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:43,111
She's clean now.
She's good.

203
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:58,084
This is for you.

204
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:02,595
I don't want anything from
you. You can call a cab.

205
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,448
It's Ray's birthday. I'm
cooking his favorite dinner.

206
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:10,249
Tracy will be home soon.
And you were never here.

207
00:18:20,302 --> 00:18:23,083
Tran, I don't mind you
singing on the ship,

208
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:24,871
but you got to get
the work done, too.

209
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:31,048
Remember we got
that special?

210
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:34,917
Two DVDs and you get a pack of that
crap popcorn. Give it away, Tran.

211
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,437
Want me to pick him up
later?

212
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:58,158
No, mate.
I'll put him in a taxi.

213
00:18:58,227 --> 00:19:01,195
Unless you want to stay
and watch the cable.

214
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:03,175
I gotta get home.

215
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:33,810
G'day, mate.

216
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:35,090
Over there.

217
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:44,752
Ray Heart?

218
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,168
Yeah.

219
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:47,608
Thanks for coming out here.

220
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:49,299
Yeah.

221
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:50,861
I got you a beer.

222
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:52,793
No, thanks.

223
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,739
So... is there a problem?

224
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:04,087
I got some money together
with a friend of mine.

225
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:06,294
We're looking
for opportunities to-

226
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:07,409
How much money?

227
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:11,061
About 30 grand.

228
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:12,146
No bullshit.

229
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:14,710
Why would I do that, mate?

230
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,070
We're good for it.

231
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:21,173
Fair enough.

232
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:24,792
Give us a call tomorrow

233
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:26,389
and I'll see
what we can do.

234
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,097
Thanks.

235
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,692
Well, he said a friend.
Isn't that what a friend means?

236
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,828
Could be someone he talked to
at the bus stop.

237
00:20:44,897 --> 00:20:47,287
Look, it's his birthday.

238
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,999
Trace, get the door, will ya?

239
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:04,286
Why is he at the front-

240
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:07,424
You know where the key is.
Use it!

241
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,752
Shit!

242
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:26,307
Ray's not here yet?

243
00:21:29,094 --> 00:21:31,034
I'll let you in the front.

244
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:34,116
Is that Ray?

245
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:36,352
It's Jonny.

246
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:39,843
Isn't he in Vancouver?

247
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:41,058
Not anymore.

248
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:45,631
Shit.

249
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:47,112
Janelle?

250
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:50,406
Oh, well,
what have we got here?

251
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:52,479
Come in.

252
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:54,750
Trace.

253
00:21:56,457 --> 00:21:58,795
Duty free.
Do you still smoke?

254
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,630
Ray told you
I was coming here?

255
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:04,324
When did you get back?

256
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,368
A couple
of days ago.

257
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:09,189
Thanks.

258
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:13,541
Here.
This is for you.

259
00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:17,353
Not real ones.

260
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:19,909
Why are you wearing
a suit?

261
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:24,550
Why I am wearing a suit?

262
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,183
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

263
00:22:27,728 --> 00:22:29,615
Hey!

264
00:22:31,821 --> 00:22:33,385
How are you going, Ray?

265
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,170
Shit.

266
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:43,953
So, you know,
in Vancouver

267
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:48,294
people are making money 24-7
and that's all they do.

268
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,280
They work and sleep.

269
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:52,775
I don't suppose
they sleep much.

270
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,995
That sounds like shit.

271
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:57,293
You've been there, Janelle?

272
00:22:57,362 --> 00:23:02,099
No. Overseas I've been in
New Zealand, Fiji, and Bali.

273
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:03,375
How long are you back for?

274
00:23:03,444 --> 00:23:05,518
For good.
Yeah.

275
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,752
I've got a job offer here, so-

276
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,063
What sort of a job?

277
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:12,655
A trader
with a stockbroker.

278
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,342
I worked with my uncle
in Canada in his company.

279
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:17,299
They do the Asian market.

280
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,275
It'd be pretty good money,
wouldn't it?

281
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,357
Yeah.
It's alright.

282
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:26,166
I'm also thinking about importing
those flowers I gave you.

283
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,791
Thanks.

284
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,313
How are you going?

285
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:32,722
Good.

286
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:34,963
She's doing great.
She's opening her own shop.

287
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:38,743
Mom, I'm going into partnership with
Ming in my work at the video shop.

288
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,839
We're expanding into internet
on-line gaming.

289
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:45,459
And the bank.

290
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,698
Yeah.

291
00:23:51,772 --> 00:23:53,679
The bank approved
my loan today.

292
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:55,793
That's great!

293
00:23:57,115 --> 00:23:58,456
That's amazing.

294
00:23:59,323 --> 00:24:00,849
No, no, really!

295
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,821
That is amazing.

296
00:24:11,037 --> 00:24:12,728
Don't just drop them
in a plate.

297
00:24:12,797 --> 00:24:14,291
How many times
have I done this?

298
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:16,373
Happy birthday.

299
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:18,425
Thanks.

300
00:24:18,493 --> 00:24:19,954
Don't drink it all.

301
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,070
Anything but alcohol.

302
00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:25,243
A speech, Ray.

303
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:26,904
Get fucked.
I want a big bit.

304
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,237
I'd like to say a few words.

305
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,441
Just a few, mom?

306
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,124
Ray's 30.
My baby's 30.

307
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:38,942
Five years ago
on this night,

308
00:24:39,008 --> 00:24:40,800
I stayed in a hospital
emergency room

309
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:43,102
not knowing
if you were gonna live.

310
00:24:44,738 --> 00:24:48,055
I never wanna go through another
night like that in my life.

311
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:50,486
It was a bad night.

312
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:52,319
Bad night.

313
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,061
And three years
of rehab for Ray and me.

314
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,735
People from the past
knocking at the door.

315
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,936
I suppose you think
about it. The accident.

316
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:09,346
Every day, Janelle.

317
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:15,587
So, when do you start work?

318
00:25:15,654 --> 00:25:18,042
Friday.
In the city.

319
00:25:18,118 --> 00:25:22,591
So I suppose now you'll be moving
out to Stratfield, somewhere.

320
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:23,809
I don't know.

321
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:25,885
I'm just staying with
Kim and June for now.

322
00:25:25,955 --> 00:25:29,637
You probably have noticed this but
people have been running from this place.

323
00:25:29,704 --> 00:25:32,224
Almost everyone. All the
houses have changed hands.

324
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:35,524
Or kicking themselves. Prices
around here have gone up.

325
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:38,177
People just want the best
they can for their families.

326
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:40,353
Oh, right,
and I don't!

327
00:25:40,425 --> 00:25:42,184
That's not what I meant.

328
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:45,000
Five years ago one's nearly
killed in a car crash.

329
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:48,776
Other one is about to become a fully
blind junkie or find himself in jail.

330
00:25:48,844 --> 00:25:51,876
Or maybe bloody both!
So, what do I do?

331
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:54,150
Can I send them off
to a rich family overseas?

332
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,528
No.

333
00:25:55,594 --> 00:25:58,246
Can I get Tracy into the
clinics to get her clean? No!

334
00:25:58,317 --> 00:26:00,171
Mom, sit down.

335
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:02,723
It'll be alright.
No matter what you do,

336
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:04,868
always someone's there
to smooth it over.

337
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:06,436
Need it?
Get it, sign the check.

338
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:08,001
That would be alright.

339
00:26:08,076 --> 00:26:11,590
Maybe you shouldn't have married
such a loser asshole then.

340
00:26:11,661 --> 00:26:14,027
You gonna blame your dad
for the rest of your life?

341
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:16,745
Probably yeah.

342
00:26:16,814 --> 00:26:20,010
Janelle, you would have done the
same things if you had the money.

343
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,283
But I don't.
I didn't, I never did.

344
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,556
You say you don't understand
these people.

345
00:26:24,622 --> 00:26:26,924
They're doing what you
would do if you could.

346
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,343
Oh, I've had enough.

347
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:39,017
Happy fucking birthday, Ray.

348
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:45,870
Should I take it?

349
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,050
So you can be all in.

350
00:26:47,121 --> 00:26:49,807
Yes, thank you.
That will be very nice.

351
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,192
I'm fine, thank you.

352
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,144
Okay, there you go.

353
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,787
Darling.

354
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,153
It's alright now.
Ray.

355
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:05,588
Thanks for the shoot.

356
00:27:06,964 --> 00:27:09,652
Good night.

357
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:12,941
Ray.

358
00:27:16,376 --> 00:27:17,835
I'm gonna bed.

359
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,271
<i>Trace, are we gonna fit
12 computers In here?</i>

360
00:27:28,341 --> 00:27:29,870
Yeah, easily.

361
00:27:29,945 --> 00:27:33,524
Yeah, good.
This is cool.

362
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:35,980
Fix the place up.
Make a bit of money.

363
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:38,708
And you can refinance
and buy me out.

364
00:27:40,473 --> 00:27:42,100
What would you do?

365
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:44,889
Oh, I'll be up at businesses.
Other things I wanna do.

366
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:45,935
No, no, no.

367
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:47,866
C'mon, Trace!
Why not?

368
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,070
You've been doing it
for four years.

369
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,720
You're a bloody great
manager.

370
00:27:57,372 --> 00:28:02,707
You know, it's bad luck for tears to
fall in the ground of a new business.

371
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,083
Bullshit.

372
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:06,426
Just think about it, ey?

373
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:08,403
Yeah, right.

374
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,332
Thanks.

375
00:28:12,445 --> 00:28:15,098
<i>The whales aren't believed
to be In any danger,</i>

376
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:19,192
<i>But National Parks will stand
In guard to ensure proper traffic</i>

377
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:21,020

<i>give the mammals
plenty of room to move,</i>

379
00:28:26,526 --> 00:28:30,720
You know, you should have told your
mom I was coming last night, prick.

380
00:28:32,193 --> 00:28:33,884
<i>Stay In memory,</i>

381
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:37,435
Yeah, absolutely.

382
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:40,221
Give us a look
at that fun, will you?

383
00:28:47,812 --> 00:28:48,891
This is weird.

384
00:28:48,964 --> 00:28:50,524
What?

385
00:28:55,812 --> 00:28:58,659
I don't know.
I just feel-

386
00:28:58,723 --> 00:29:00,830
Seeing you again
we'll be more together.

387
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,968
What about this?

388
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,946
Did you speak to that guy?

389
00:29:06,021 --> 00:29:07,482
Moss?

390
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,372
I told him we had 30 grand,
mate, and his eyes went like this.

391
00:29:12,326 --> 00:29:15,677
C'mon, let's get out of here. I want
you to take me somewhere, will you?

392
00:29:16,581 --> 00:29:18,405
Ray, I can't drive like this.

393
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,025
What's wrong? You're worried
you might have a crash?

394
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:29,918
Sorry.

395
00:29:57,677 --> 00:29:58,886
Thanks, mate.

396
00:29:58,957 --> 00:30:01,159
No worries.

397
00:30:01,226 --> 00:30:02,985
Change those prices
for me.

398
00:30:03,054 --> 00:30:05,123
No worries.

399
00:30:05,195 --> 00:30:06,310
You're alright?

400
00:30:06,382 --> 00:30:08,238
Yeah. I've just got a bit of a cold.

401
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:11,301
I'll drop in, uh, later in
the way. I'll give you a ring.

402
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:27,854
Hello?

403
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,677
Tracy, it's me.

404
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:31,599
Jonny.

405
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:35,049
How did you get
my number?

406
00:30:35,121 --> 00:30:36,779
Ray.

407
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,816
Ray gave it to me.

408
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:41,264
It's hard.

409
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,274
It's hard being back.

410
00:30:44,338 --> 00:30:46,707
It's harder than I thought.

411
00:30:47,858 --> 00:30:49,931
Tracy, you're there?

412
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:53,552
I gotta go.

413
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:54,699
See ya.

414
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,878
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

415
00:31:05,174 --> 00:31:06,284
You're okay?

416
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:08,498
Yeah.

417
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:09,549
You're okay?

418
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:11,989
Yeah, just wanna get home.

419
00:31:31,994 --> 00:31:35,377
And Jonny wouldn't speak.

420
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,067
He had just lost his parents.

421
00:31:38,138 --> 00:31:41,071
A feeling
I will never forget.

422
00:31:41,145 --> 00:31:42,741
As time goes on-

423
00:31:53,406 --> 00:31:56,601
But Jonny has been
in Vancouver for four years.

424
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:59,636
He has been working
very hard.

425
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:02,578
And he has a new job here
in Sydney.

426
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:04,508
A stockbroker.

427
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:19,549
Today is 20 years
since I married June.

428
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:38,493
June, thank you.

429
00:32:43,972 --> 00:32:46,491
I don't know, Lionel.

430
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:49,763
You've got to do something.
Never had to pay for it.

431
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:50,874
A straight price?

432
00:32:50,948 --> 00:32:52,607
I never had to find it.

433
00:32:52,677 --> 00:32:56,092
No, I won't stand up in front of a
bunch of people and say that I was wrong,

434
00:32:56,163 --> 00:32:59,611
that my life was wrong,
because it wasn't. It isn't.

435
00:33:01,252 --> 00:33:03,675
I gotta strip for this
Salbutan and just wait.

436
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,244
Really?

437
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,591
Yeah, I'll be fine.
One week and I'm clean.

438
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:10,855
One week?
Yeah, right.

439
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,609
M'mmmm.

440
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:19,297
How good is that?

441
00:33:19,368 --> 00:33:21,122
Yummy.

442
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,337
Aren't you having any?

443
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:23,872
No.

444
00:33:36,395 --> 00:33:37,474
Jonny's back.

445
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:40,583
Eh?

446
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,324
How is he?

447
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,321
He's great.
He's clean.

448
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:49,442
He's a stockbroker.

449
00:33:53,453 --> 00:33:55,364
Let him on the phone
in the morning.

450
00:33:58,895 --> 00:34:00,901
Most stupid.

451
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,045
No.

452
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,893
No boyfriend causes such a
commotion. What does that say?

453
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,863
It's okay.

454
00:34:09,935 --> 00:34:12,456
Yeah.
Is it?

455
00:34:13,743 --> 00:34:15,686
Yeah, it is.

456
00:34:18,383 --> 00:34:19,366
It's great.

457
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:25,678
The look on your face
after you spoke to him.

458
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:27,403
And now it's beyond that.

459
00:34:27,472 --> 00:34:30,189
I'd kill for that feeling.

460
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,752
You got your stuff?

461
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:40,947
Trace... I haven't been
to the beach for years

462
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,752
and what is all.
Like I'm on public.

463
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:51,054
I'll take you
to the beach.

464
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,802
You're my darling.

465
00:34:58,901 --> 00:35:00,463
Eat something.

466
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:07,020
Bye-bye.

467
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:09,004
See you, darling.

468
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:32,152
Do you like trading?

469
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:34,608
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

470
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:37,717
It's fun playing with other
people's money, you know.

471
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:39,894
I'm impressed.

472
00:35:39,965 --> 00:35:43,096
A car.
Mr. Cool C.

473
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:44,820
The car's me uncle's.

474
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,378
Tracy.

475
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:53,047
How you're going?

476
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,873
I'm good.
What are you doing?

477
00:35:54,942 --> 00:35:56,117
Now?

478
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,329
Yes.

479
00:35:58,398 --> 00:35:59,379
Nothing.

480
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:01,014
Do you-

481
00:36:01,089 --> 00:36:02,910
Do you wanna meet up?

482
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:06,008
Yeah, we could meet
on the corner, you know.

483
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,485
I don't have a car.

484
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,189
I can, I can pick you up.

485
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,143
At 7: 00?

486
00:36:14,209 --> 00:36:15,702
I'll take you
to the city.

487
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:17,751
This is a really
cool restaurant.

488
00:36:17,824 --> 00:36:19,229
Yeah, right.

489
00:36:19,295 --> 00:36:20,890
Alright.

490
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,296
Okay.
Bye.

491
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:14,624
Hey.

492
00:37:14,697 --> 00:37:16,737
Hi.

493
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:26,432
You wanna drive?

494
00:37:27,977 --> 00:37:28,927
Okay.

495
00:37:45,036 --> 00:37:50,154
I've got to know
if this is the real sea

496
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:07,246
How are you going?

497
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,187
Good.

498
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:11,174
You look great.

499
00:38:15,441 --> 00:38:17,711
You really changed
since I left.

500
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:24,841
Tracy, You know I-
I didn't have a choice.

501
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:28,624
My uncle sent me away
and my bags were packed.

502
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:30,697
I had no time
to see anyone.

503
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:33,745
Four years.

504
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:36,332
Yeah.

505
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,254
Anyway, look at you.
You look great.

506
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:44,944
Yeah, 32.

507
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:48,241
Living home with my mom
and work in a video shop.

508
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,128
Do you think
if I'd stayed,

509
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,279
you'd be clean now?

510
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:00,916
Fuck knows
where we'd be.

511
00:39:00,985 --> 00:39:06,582
Scarlet for me
and scarlet for you

512
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:19,537
What do you wanna eat?

513
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,478
I bet the food
is pretty good here.

514
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:26,300
Is that what you heard? Like
you read restaurant reviews.

515
00:39:27,353 --> 00:39:29,143
Certain times I do, yeah.

516
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,786
Are you ready to order?

517
00:39:32,857 --> 00:39:34,614
What'd you like?

518
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,084
Take your time.
I'll come back.

519
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,345
You're okay?

520
00:39:44,412 --> 00:39:46,486
I don't wanna be here.
I'm wanna go.

521
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,109
Tracy.

522
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:50,706
No, I just
wanna go home, okay?

523
00:39:54,364 --> 00:39:57,271
This is a bad idea.

524
00:39:57,344 --> 00:39:58,325
Where are you going?

525
00:39:58,399 --> 00:39:59,346
I'm going home.

526
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:00,536
Let me drive.

527
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,754
No, no, no.

528
00:40:01,824 --> 00:40:03,315
Don't grab me!

529
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,977
Don't think
you can fucking... grab me.

530
00:40:06,048 --> 00:40:07,957
Tracy, c'mon.

531
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,373
What am I doing here?

532
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:15,392
This is so easy for you!

533
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:17,433
Is it easy?

534
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:21,626
What do you reckon, huh?

535
00:40:29,923 --> 00:40:32,708
I want to drive you home, okay?

536
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:40,419
<i>Mr. Bush spoke
to Mr. Howard</i>

537
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:44,477
<i>about getting at least
the understanding</i>

538
00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:02,746
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

539
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:03,773
What?

540
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:07,266
Is that loaded?

541
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:10,784
Nah, it's my farewell present when
I sold the bar in the Philippines.

542
00:41:10,857 --> 00:41:13,705
Some bastard
tried to impress me.

543
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:16,103
I never used it.

544
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:18,883
It's beautifully
handcrafted.

545
00:41:18,952 --> 00:41:21,191
Why don't you keep it?
I'm retiring.

546
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,437
Oh, no.

547
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:23,715
No, I want you
to have it.

548
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,565
I'm not a collector, mate.

549
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:28,524
Do you want a beer?
I poured you one.

550
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,081
No, I might keep going.

551
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:32,011
There's some white wine
in the fridge.

552
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,630
Jenny's getting a bit jacked
up at me showing up late.

553
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,147
So, if there's nothing else,
I'll see you tomorrow.

554
00:41:38,221 --> 00:41:39,625
Yeah, alright.

555
00:41:39,692 --> 00:41:41,001
At 10: 00?

556
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:42,533
Sure.

557
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:44,715
Hey,

558
00:41:44,783 --> 00:41:46,691
what ever happened
to that Barky couple

559
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:49,154
who ran the speed factory
for us?

560
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:51,085
Merv and Eileen.

561
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,736
Where did they go?

562
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:55,909
Kangaroo Valley, I think.

563
00:41:55,984 --> 00:41:57,542
They've got some goats
up there.

564
00:41:57,613 --> 00:42:00,163
Goats.

565
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,204
I just wanna get things
finalized.

566
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:06,128
Lawyer's on the case.
You understand?

567
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,298
Yeah, yeah, sure.

568
00:42:08,368 --> 00:42:09,546
Steven,

569
00:42:09,617 --> 00:42:11,405
just sit down
for a minute, will you?

570
00:42:11,472 --> 00:42:13,675
I know you wanna get back
to your family.

571
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:22,953
Come.

572
00:42:23,028 --> 00:42:27,084
I know some things about me
that you found... difficult.

573
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:30,570
I wanna say this.

574
00:42:30,642 --> 00:42:32,947
I know what sort of man
you are,

575
00:42:33,013 --> 00:42:35,792
and your thoughts about such
matters won't make things-

576
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,681
I'm not one
to judge, mate.

577
00:42:37,748 --> 00:42:41,840
I just wanna...thank you
for your trust and discretion.

578
00:42:43,222 --> 00:42:44,976
Okay.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

579
00:42:45,045 --> 00:42:46,477
Yeah, alright.

580
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,678
Right.

581
00:42:49,751 --> 00:42:51,344
Okay.

582
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:55,787
Bradly's got no idea.

583
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,645
He hasn't been down to
the speed factory in years.

584
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,231
He just wants to fuck boys
and play golf.

585
00:43:01,304 --> 00:43:02,895
What if he goes down there?

586
00:43:02,968 --> 00:43:04,526
Well, then he does.

587
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:07,021
Merv and Eileen can deal
with it. Honestly, Stevy.

588
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,150
I hurt my nose!

589
00:43:11,224 --> 00:43:12,208
Is there any blood?

590
00:43:13,754 --> 00:43:15,444
Is she alright?

591
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:16,921
Just a little bit.

592
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:18,874
My bunny, my bunny.

593
00:43:18,937 --> 00:43:21,493
Oh, that's alright
'cause we've got him now!

594
00:43:21,564 --> 00:43:25,305
We silly duffers.
These toys are shit.

595
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:27,576
Bloody dangerous, too.

596
00:43:27,643 --> 00:43:29,815
You know, Tiny and Jean
have got a new floor.

597
00:43:29,882 --> 00:43:31,789
You can just lay
straight over the slab.

598
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:33,276
Yeah? Good.

599
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,928
Here we go. It's okay, it's
okay, honey. There you go.

600
00:43:35,997 --> 00:43:38,136
Sh, sh, sh,
There.

601
00:43:38,204 --> 00:43:40,026
There we go.

602
00:43:42,238 --> 00:43:43,831
So, this is what
we're doing.

603
00:43:43,902 --> 00:43:47,033
So, we can save for a whole
new floor and we can have it.

604
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:49,143
It's worth it.

605
00:43:49,214 --> 00:43:52,247
Yeah.

606
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:55,669
<i>Move along the outside,
Now Springsfur is pushing up,</i>

607
00:43:55,744 --> 00:43:58,360
<i>And now Camel has dropped
to the tall,</i>

608
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:02,044
<i>Springsfur by four,
Second Is Camel,</i>

609
00:44:23,939 --> 00:44:27,255
<i>Tracy, you're brother's here,
C'mon, please,</i>

610
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:47,232
He's not here.

611
00:44:47,301 --> 00:44:49,506
Having a good perv?

612
00:44:49,573 --> 00:44:51,397
You're losing your touch.

613
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:58,279
Why didn't you wake me?
I missed my swim.

614
00:44:58,344 --> 00:45:00,994
I did try to wake you, but
if my memory says me correctly

615
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:02,692
you told me
to fuck off, mum.

616
00:45:02,762 --> 00:45:04,548
Sorry.

617
00:45:04,617 --> 00:45:06,982
Mum, just drop her off here.
She can get the train.

618
00:45:07,048 --> 00:45:08,804
I'm late.

619
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,013
Here's the station, Trace.

620
00:45:20,363 --> 00:45:22,054
Where're you going, anyway?

621
00:45:22,123 --> 00:45:24,068
I don't know.
It's a surprise.

622
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:26,625
Yeah, it's just somewhere
never you mind.

623
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:30,945
Go right here.
Mum, mum? Go.

624
00:45:31,018 --> 00:45:33,476
Oh, don't.
Stop it, for goodness sake!

625
00:45:33,546 --> 00:45:36,038
We're going to take forever
to get back on the freeway.

626
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:39,271
I'll take Tracy to work.
Laura picks her up, right?

627
00:45:39,341 --> 00:45:41,829
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

628
00:45:44,622 --> 00:45:45,570
Mum?

629
00:45:45,647 --> 00:45:47,947
Just wait, please.
Trace!

630
00:45:52,145 --> 00:45:54,116
Did you go out
with Jonny last night?

631
00:45:54,193 --> 00:45:55,979
Yeah.

632
00:45:58,895 --> 00:46:00,204
Okay.

633
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:02,628
Hey, mom?

634
00:46:04,786 --> 00:46:06,192
Give us a kiss.

635
00:46:10,832 --> 00:46:13,964
Oh, no, no, no!
Naughty girl!

636
00:46:14,035 --> 00:46:15,889
Like the lesbians?

637
00:46:15,954 --> 00:46:17,131
You have a good day.

638
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:24,499
Could you not clap lesbian-

639
00:46:41,462 --> 00:46:43,088
Doesn't it go in the Ts?

640
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:44,718
No.

641
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,579
I'll look for it Ivonne
as a customer.

642
00:46:46,646 --> 00:46:48,109
Would you?

643
00:46:49,686 --> 00:46:51,411
When do you find out
about the bank?

644
00:46:52,374 --> 00:46:54,513
This afternoon.

645
00:46:56,376 --> 00:46:59,758
You told Janelle you got
the loan approved already.

646
00:46:59,832 --> 00:47:01,458
Yeah.

647
00:47:01,526 --> 00:47:03,318
Did you tell her
anything different?

648
00:47:03,384 --> 00:47:05,013
No!

649
00:47:07,737 --> 00:47:10,735
The party's right here.
It's right here!

650
00:47:12,411 --> 00:47:13,425
Are you alright?

651
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:14,576
Yeah.

652
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:16,951
Just I didn't sleep much
last night.

653
00:47:17,017 --> 00:47:19,473
You're racing or you
just watching some TV?

654
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:24,887
I went out with Jonny.

655
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,662
Are you alright?

656
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:30,008
It's a change.

657
00:47:30,077 --> 00:47:32,377
Didn't you and Janelle
have a chitty chat about that?

658
00:47:32,444 --> 00:47:33,904
Tracy.

659
00:47:35,324 --> 00:47:39,002
Lionel Dawson. Okay, I can
buy that. He's an old friend.

660
00:47:39,069 --> 00:47:40,727
Do you think
this is okay?

661
00:47:40,798 --> 00:47:44,541
He's straight.
Straighter than you.

662
00:47:44,607 --> 00:47:46,614
Do you feel okay
about being around him?

663
00:47:46,688 --> 00:47:48,599
I can handle it.

664
00:47:50,366 --> 00:47:51,611
You don't know him!

665
00:47:51,681 --> 00:47:53,653
No, I don't.

666
00:47:56,864 --> 00:47:59,002
He's a stockbroker.

667
00:48:00,353 --> 00:48:03,220
Went to this really nice
restaurant in the city.

668
00:48:06,722 --> 00:48:08,064
What?

669
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:11,032
You look scared. I haven't
seen that look for a while.

670
00:48:11,105 --> 00:48:13,724
There's this big fucking
empty space.

671
00:48:13,795 --> 00:48:14,873
Tracy, it's okay.

672
00:48:14,945 --> 00:48:16,322
I'm fucking fine.

673
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:17,533
Take it easy.

674
00:48:22,404 --> 00:48:25,471
<i>Brad, It's Lionel,</i>

675
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,282
<i>If you're there, mate, please pick
up, I really need to talk to you,</i>

676
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:31,516
<i>Brad, It's Lionel again,</i>

677
00:48:31,588 --> 00:48:34,523
<i>Please, call me, mate,
Okay?</i>

678
00:48:34,596 --> 00:48:37,148
It's the third time today.

679
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,543
Your wife's outside.

680
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,119
She's got a key.

681
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,909
Look at these fucking boxes.

682
00:48:54,985 --> 00:48:57,023
There are people waiting.

683
00:48:57,095 --> 00:49:00,161
Can I stay today?
Please?

684
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,853
If you want to arrange this,

685
00:49:08,361 --> 00:49:09,703
you talk to me.

686
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:12,159
'Cause I fucking live here,
not her.

687
00:49:12,235 --> 00:49:13,828
I co-owned, Bradley.

688
00:49:13,899 --> 00:49:15,461
C'mon, Steven.

689
00:49:15,531 --> 00:49:17,920
You fucking prick.

690
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,929
<i>Do you know
whose house Is this?</i>

691
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:23,589
<i>Bradley Thompson's,
What?</i>

692
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,700
Don't you want to have
a look inside?

693
00:49:25,772 --> 00:49:27,048
Ray!

694
00:49:27,115 --> 00:49:29,900
It's open for inspection, mom!
Look, anyone can go in.

695
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:33,125
How did you find out
about it?

696
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,393
I just ready it in the paper. C'mon.

697
00:50:16,115 --> 00:50:19,311
<i>Hi, my name Is Tracy Heart, I had
an appointment with Donna Suvani,</i>

698
00:50:21,587 --> 00:50:24,819
It's just that I need to secure
the loan as soon as possible.

699
00:50:26,771 --> 00:50:27,951
No.

700
00:50:28,021 --> 00:50:29,778
Okay.
No, that's great.

701
00:50:29,845 --> 00:50:32,181
Yeah, yeah. I'll be there. Thank you.

702
00:50:32,245 --> 00:50:34,000
Excuse me.

703
00:50:34,066 --> 00:50:37,134
I've gotta close the shop.
Do you want anything?

704
00:50:40,725 --> 00:50:43,476
I'm gonna get change.
I'll be two minutes.

705
00:50:48,116 --> 00:50:49,842
It's Trace.

706
00:50:57,303 --> 00:50:59,409
Oh, honey, I forgot
how painful this is.

707
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,933
It's fucking horrible.

708
00:51:04,089 --> 00:51:06,544
I'll be back
in a couple of hours, alright?

709
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:15,222
I call Brad so many times but he
hasn't called back. I don't understand.

710
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:18,192
Sorry, Lionel,
but I gotta go.

711
00:51:20,028 --> 00:51:21,970
I'll be back
really soon, alright?

712
00:51:22,043 --> 00:51:23,604
Okay.

713
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,041
Hi. I'm here to see
Donna Suvani.

714
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:36,181
M'h-hm.
Take a seat.

715
00:51:47,999 --> 00:51:52,702
Yeah, it's alright.
It's about half an hour trip.

716
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:55,322
Hi, Jonny. Steven Moss.
Steven, this is Jonny Nguyen.

717
00:51:55,393 --> 00:51:56,377
How are ya?

718
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:58,009
Good, good, good.

719
00:52:00,673 --> 00:52:02,080
I'm sorry, excuse me.

720
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,764
Hi.

721
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:15,007
Where are you?

722
00:52:15,076 --> 00:52:18,076
With some friends at
the club. Where are you?

723
00:52:18,148 --> 00:52:22,403
I'm just sorting out some-
Finishing up the bank stuff.

724
00:52:22,469 --> 00:52:26,430
It's kind of hard for me
to talk right now.

725
00:52:26,501 --> 00:52:27,646
Sure, sorry.

726
00:52:27,717 --> 00:52:29,692
No, that's fine.

727
00:52:31,044 --> 00:52:33,021
It's great you called.

728
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:36,158
I missed you.

729
00:52:36,227 --> 00:52:38,619
I just, I wanted to say
that last night-

730
00:52:38,692 --> 00:52:40,671
Tracy, listen,
I'll call you.

731
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:43,013
Okay?
I have to finish here.

732
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:46,911
Excuse me.
You can go in now.

733
00:52:46,984 --> 00:52:47,997
I've gotta go.

734
00:52:52,296 --> 00:52:54,120
G'day, Tracy.

735
00:52:54,184 --> 00:52:56,290
How are you?

736
00:52:56,361 --> 00:52:58,214
Sit down.
Wait me a second.

737
00:53:02,216 --> 00:53:04,518
Bloody computers.

738
00:53:05,451 --> 00:53:07,206
He's cute.

739
00:53:07,275 --> 00:53:09,313
You want kids?

740
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,177
Don't know.

741
00:53:12,748 --> 00:53:14,886
I've got a friend who's having
a second baby.

742
00:53:14,954 --> 00:53:17,191
Really?
He's nice.

743
00:53:17,258 --> 00:53:19,051
A lot of work.

744
00:53:19,115 --> 00:53:21,572
Have you got
a boyfriend?

745
00:53:21,645 --> 00:53:23,498
Would it help the loan
if I did?

746
00:53:25,357 --> 00:53:27,268
Maybe.

747
00:53:27,339 --> 00:53:28,749
Okay.

748
00:53:28,814 --> 00:53:30,985
Now, the business loan.

749
00:53:31,053 --> 00:53:33,869
I'm really sorry, Tracy,
but there's no way

750
00:53:33,936 --> 00:53:37,382
I can approve this loan
for you today.

751
00:53:37,453 --> 00:53:39,311
I think you probably
know why.

752
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:41,838
Okay.

753
00:53:41,905 --> 00:53:43,975
But what if I reduce
the amount a little bit?

754
00:53:44,048 --> 00:53:47,790
Instead of making it
40 thousand I made it 25.

755
00:53:47,854 --> 00:53:52,046
The business is great but it's a lease
premises. There's no real capital.

756
00:53:52,112 --> 00:53:55,147
If the bank did have to come in,
there'll be nothing to recoup on it.

757
00:53:55,219 --> 00:53:57,586
The capital'll be built
into the new shop.

758
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,854
The computers, the stock,
the customer base.

759
00:53:59,922 --> 00:54:03,665
Tracy, is there someone you
can get to help you out with it?

760
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,583
Maybe get your dad
to go guarantor.

761
00:54:05,648 --> 00:54:08,498
That's not gonna happen. I'm
not asking for a gift here.

762
00:54:08,563 --> 00:54:10,418
I'll be paying it back.

763
00:54:10,484 --> 00:54:12,177
Tracy, we did a credit check
on you.

764
00:54:12,245 --> 00:54:14,830
I'm paying it off.
I've organized it.

765
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:17,072
Di-di-
I'm paying it off!

766
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:20,590
Look here. "Have you been refused
credits in the last ten years?"

767
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:23,147
You ticked the box No
when you should've ticked Yes.
