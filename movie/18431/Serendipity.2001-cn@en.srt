64
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,630
我女朋友  懂了吗?
My girlfriend. Do you understand?

65
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,630
确实很难明白
That didn't really work out.

66
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,640
-是  还是祝你们圣诞快乐  -非常感谢

Thank you.

74
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,160
我真不知道刚那人能懂不
I don't know what you said to that guy makes any sense.

75
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,370
但我想我们是吓到他了
But I think we scared the bejesus out of him.

76
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,490
你真够激动的
You were pretty fierce.

77
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,910
这确实挺管用  这蛮像咖啡味道
This will work, though. This is quite a coffee.

78
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,750
一定要让我请客  这是我至少能做的
But I'm serious about the check. It's the least I can do.

嗯  谢谢  但这样一来
Well, thank you, but, see,

80
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,750
我得另外找一份礼物给我女朋友了

-噢  你打算买给你女友  -是的
- Oh, they were for your girlfriend. - Yes, they were.

82
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,260
-噢  我怎能接受  -你一定要接受
- Oh, I can't accept them then. - Well, you have to.

83
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,840
不然你真不能请客
Otherwise you won't treat. Really.

84
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,430
让我告诉你  这终极混合冷饮
Let me tell you something. This is the ultimate blend to drink.

85
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,480
-你怎么找到这家店的?  -第一次来
- Where did you find this place? - I first came in...

86
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,440
是因为这家店的名字

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,810
-嗯  -"情有独钟"那是一个...
- Hmm. - Serendipity. It's one...

88
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,850
我最喜欢的一个词

89
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,940
-是吗?  为什么?  -嗯哼
- It is? Why? - Uh-huh.

90
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,520
因为它好听具有深意就像是:幸运的邂逅
'Cause it's such a nice sound for what it means: a fortunate accident.

91
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,700
-嗯  -除了我不...
- Mm. - Except I don't really...

92
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,610
相信邂逅

93
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,280

- We don't have any choice at all? - I think we make our own decisions.

97
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,960
我只认为命运给我们一丝征兆
I just think that fate sends us little signs,

98
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,120
然后如何去解读才是决定...
and it's how we read the signs that determines whether...

99
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:33,960
我们快乐与否
we're happy or not.

100

-一丝征兆  嗯  -是

- I don't know that one. - You don't know that story?

我一般都满意自己挑选的

I just had a great time, and I'd never be able to find you again.

130
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,960

00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,420
那样我们就早5小时了
and we're five hours too early.

134
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,840
拜托  我连你名字都不知道
Come on. I don't even know your name.

135
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,220
我叫乔纳森
My name is Jonathan.

136
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,140
你没有什么想告诉我吗?
Does that make you wanna tell me something?

137
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,640
嗯  有
Yeah, it does.

138
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,520
圣诞快乐  乔纳森  再次感谢
Merry Christmas, Jonathan. And thanks.

139
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,770
就这样?
That's it?

140
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,950
# I can feel my heart... #

141
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,930
噢  天哪  真抱歉
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry about that.

142
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,620
# I try to clean it up #

143
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,210
# But I just get worse #

144
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,750
# Wish I could fall #

145
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,890
# On a night like this... #

146
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,990
# Into your loving arms #

147
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,950
我想我围巾落下了
I think I left a scarf.

148
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,760
没有  下面什么都没有  为什么你不到楼上看看?
No. Nothing down here. Why don't you go upstairs?

149
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,810
-也许还在那儿  -谢谢
- Maybe it's still there. - Thank you.

150
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,980
# I thought I saw your face #

151
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,020
# In the evening sky #

152
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,120
# On a lonesome cloud #

153
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,780
# That was drifting by #

154
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,000
# I wish I could fall #

155
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,500
# On a night like this #

156
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,130
# Into your loving arms #

157
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,430
嘿
Hey.

158
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,510
嘿
Hey.

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,980
一起去逛逛吧
Let's go do something.

160
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,810
好呀  你想去哪里呢?
All right. What you wanna do?

161
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,650
无所谓
I don't care.

162
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:37,310
好  这边
All right. Come on.

163
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,670
现在  答应我你不是只来这儿观光一周...
Now, promise me you're not just visiting here for a week...

164
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,330
或为了得到绿卡嫁给某人或在假释中
or marrying somebody to get a green card or on parole.

165
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,720
都不是  你呢?
None of the above. You?

166
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,890
不不不  自豪的美国公民  没有一点犯罪记录
No, no, no. Proud U. S. citizen. No criminal record.

167
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,840
所以你不告诉我你的名字
So you won't tell me your name.

168
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,680
嗯  告诉我  故乡英格兰的什么让你最为牵挂?
Well, tell me, uh, what do you miss most about Mother England?

169
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,020
我最牵挂我的妈妈
I miss my mom terribly.

170
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,730
要是我是你妈妈  也会牵挂你的
If I were her, I'd miss you too.

171
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,610
好  你最喜欢哪部电影
Okay. Favorite movie.

172
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,280
最喜欢"铁手卢克"
The correct answer is Cool Hand Luke.

173
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
我从没看过这部电影
I've never seen it.

174
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,620
噢  不会吧  你从来没有看过"铁手卢克"?
Oh, come on. You've never seen Cool Hand Luke?

175
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,870
保罗・纽曼?  噢  天哪  拜托!
Paul Newman? Oh, my God. Come on!

176
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,830
"缺乏沟通"  冷漠的狱警戴着一副墨镜...
"Failure to communicate. " Sadistic cop in sunglasses...

177
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,670
没有名字
with no name.

178
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,130
让我感觉很有你的味道
Reminds me of you in that way.

179
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,680
嗯  最喜欢"纽约时刻"
Um, favorite New York moment.

180
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,260
这是一部进排行榜的电影
This one's climbing the charts.

181
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,390
我受宠若惊
I'm flattered.

182
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,390
你还想知道我什么
Is there anything else you need to know about me?

183
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
呃
Huh.

184
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,030
喜欢的性爱姿势?
Favorite sexual position?

185
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,240
噢!
Oh!

186
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,400
哇哦!  哇哦!  哇哦!  这个也是我喜欢的
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Yeah, yeah. That's my favorite too.

187
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,540
-你没事吧?  -嗯
- You all right? - Yeah.

188
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,410
-你有没有受伤?  -是  对
- Did you hurt yourself? - No. Yes.

189
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,620
真的?  给我看看
You did? Let's take a look at that.

190
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,080
呀
Ouch.

191
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,510
噢  天哪  伤得好深
Oh, Jesus. That's a deep, deep gash.

192
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,260
皮破了
Gaping.

193
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,050
什么?  我替你包扎下
What? We'll fix that right up.

194
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,050
看这里
There you go.

195
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,600
什么?  噢  你在看我的雀斑
What? Oh, you're looking at my freckles.

196
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,480
我认为这是因为我是英国人
It's the curse of the English, I'm afraid.

197
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,680
苍白的肤质和虫蛀的牙齿
Fair skin and bad teeth.

198
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,900
不  你的牙齿很好的
No, you have great teeth.

199
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,070
这几点不仅仅是雀斑
Those aren't just freckles.

200
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,070
如果你细心看  看得见仙后座
If you look closely, you can see Cassiopeia.

201
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,620
-什么?  -就在这里
- What? - Right there.

202
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,620
等会儿
Hold on a minute.

203
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,410
好  让我讲给你听
Okay. All right, here's the story.

204
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,550
很久以前在埃塞俄比亚
A long time ago in Ethiopia,

205
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,630
有位王后叫卡西欧琵雅
there was this queen named Cassiopeia...

206
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,630
自诩是世上绝色
who thought she was the most beautiful woman in the entire world,

207
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,970
大家都很气她
and there wasn't anybody in the kingdom who wasn't offended...

208
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,520
这女人无情自负
by this woman's relentless vanity.

209
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,310
然后有一天  她触犯了天神
And then one day, she really screwed up and offended the gods.

210
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,390
我不太记得她做了什么和触犯了谁
I don't remember what she did and I don't remember who she offended.

211
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,530
但她做的太过火了  她触犯了底线
But it was bad. She crossed the line.

212
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,940
总之  海神波塞冬为了惩罚她
But anyway, Poseidon, the sea god, punished Cassiopeia...

213
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,150
就把她永远倒悬在天空
by placing her in the heavens upside down on her throne,

214
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,620
双脚朝上  王冠朝下
stuck for eternity with her skirt around her shoulders...

215
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,990
浑身血液往脑袋逆流
and all the blood rushing to her head.

216
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,490
现在她化身为天上的星座
And now she's just a constellation in the sky,

217
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,050
一撮王冠型的英国雀斑
a bunch of English freckles in the shape of a throne.

218
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,170
古语有云:一失足...
So she made one tragic mistake.

219
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,000
成千古恨
And paid for eternity.

220
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,100
对
Correct.

221
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,370
-好好好  -写得清楚点
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Legible, legible.

222
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,700
-我想不到会写给你  -现在  快快
- I can't believe I'm doing this. - Now, please, please.

223
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,490
拜托  顺应命运安排吧
Let fate take its proper course.

224
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,040
噢
Oh!

225
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,680
那是意外  再写一张  拜托
That was an accident. Write down that again, please.

226
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,140
不可以
I can't.

227
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,050
那是征兆
That was a sign.

228
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,140
我们注定会分开
Fate's telling us to back off.

229
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,310
既然注定我们会分开  为什么...
If fate didn't want us to be together, then why...

230
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,560
我们今晚还会相遇呢?
did we meet tonight, huh?

231
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,690
-对吧  -噢  我不知道
- Gotcha. - Well, I don't know.

232
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,190
这又不是精准的科学  只是感觉
But it's not an exact science. It's a feeling.

233
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,150
那万一你错了
Well, what if you're wrong?

234
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,400
我们有缘却分离
Huh? What if it's all in our hands and we just walk away?

235
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,280
没名字  没电话  什么都没有  那将会怎样?
No names, no phone numbers, nothing. What do you think's gonna happen?

236
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,490
难道你认为等待命运送我的信息...
Do you think good old fate is just gonna deliver my information...

237
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,530
-正好到你家门口?  -你知道其实最好...
- right to your doorstep? - Do you know that's the best...

238
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,570
你整晚就只想到这个主意?
idea you're had all night?

239
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,920
-什么是最好的...  -来  写下...
- What's the best... - Here you go. Write...

240
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,790
你的名字和电话
your name and number down.

241
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,880
-在一张5元钞票?  -嗯  照着做
- On a $5.00 bill? - Mm. Just do it.

242
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,220
你真是个奇怪又有趣的女人
You are a strange and interesting woman.

243
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,550
现在呢?
Now what?

244
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,220
这儿等会儿
Wait there.

245
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,450
嘿!
Hey!

246
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,070
到底怎么回事?
What the hell was that?

247
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,740
当那张5元钞票再回到我手上
When that $5.00 bill makes it back into my hands,

248
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,950
我会打给你
I'll be able to call you.

249
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,250
当你从电话中听到我声音
And when you hear my voice on the other end,

250
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,790
然后你就会相信命运了  对吧?
then you'll believe in fate, won't you?

251
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,800
-嘿  那我怎么办?  -你什么怎么办?
- Hey, what about me? - What do you mean?

252
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,380
那好  就让我们送出不同的东西在这时空...
Well, we have to send something out in the universe...

253
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,380
把你姓名电话写下来
with your name on it, don't we?

254
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,130
拜托  那不公平
Come on. Isn't that the only fair thing?

255
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,260
那是唯一公平的事
That is the only fair thing.

256
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,130
我该怎么办  噢  有了  我有个好办法
What have I got, even? Ooh. No. I have a really good idea.

257
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,100
-什么?  -好的
- What? - Okay.

258
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,980
-好多大喇叭  -好  看到这本书了吗?
- That's a lot of tuba. - Okay, see this book?

259
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,730
《爱在瘟疫蔓延时》

260
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,640
嗯
Yeah.

261
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,640
好  然后当我今晚回到家
Okay, so when I get home tonight,

262
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,650
我将把姓名电话写在书扉页里
I'm gonna write my name and number inside this book.

263
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,360
然后明早第一件事  我将它送出去...
And then first thing tomorrow morning, I'll sell it...

264
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,150
给旧书店
to a used book store.

265
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,070
哪一家?
Which one?

266
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,320
你不会告诉我的  你不会告诉我  为什么不?
You're not gonna tell me. You're not gonna tell me. Why not?

267
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,320
好  现在你每次经过旧书店
Well, now, every time you go past an old book store,

268
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,500
你只管进去看有没有这本书
you're gonna have to go inside to see if it's there.

269
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,330
这行不通的  你既然拥有了...
This is just wrong. You don't just have the most...

270
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,500
最美妙的一夜...
incredible night of your life...

271
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,830
却将一切机会留给命运吧  是吧?
with a perfect stranger and then leave it all to chance, do ya?

272
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,670
-是吧?  -跟我来下
- Do ya? - Come with me a second.

273
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,970
什么  去开房?
What, we're gonna get a room?

274
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,510
开玩笑的  但我想多了解你
I'm kidding. But I wanna know you more.

275
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,350
-拜托  我们要去哪儿?  -好
- Come on. Where are we going? - Okay.

276
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,810
-现在  你站这儿  -好
- Now, you stay here. - Okay.

277
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,890
不  站着  不要动  不要逼我走过去
No, stay here. Stay there. Don't make me come over there.

278
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,350
好
Okay.

279
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,530
好  要是我们按同一层楼
All right, if we both randomly pick the same floor,

280
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,030
我们就注定会在一起
we're meant to be together now.

281
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,860
你疯了
You're insane.

282
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,490
快点  好  进去
Come on. Okay, get in.

283
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,540
放松  然后门一关就按一个键
Take a breath, and then when the door closes, hit a button.

284
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,000
-我不明白  -你不用明白
- I don't understand this. - You don't have to understand.

285
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,200
你只要相信
You just have to have faith.

286
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,700
相信什么?
Faith in what?

287
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,710
缘分
Destiny.

288
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,210
嘿!
Hey!

289
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,770
莎拉  我叫莎拉
It's Sara. My name's Sara.

290
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,250
电梯来了  瞧?  你说对了
And here it is. See? You were right.

291
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,170
-嗯...  -出发  小子
- Uh... - Let's go, buddy.

292
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,970
-我们要去楼上  -噢  好的
- We're going up here. - Oh, that's okay.

293
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,310
乔西按哪层都无所谓
Josh likes to ride either way.

294
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,600
是吧  乔西?
Don't you, Josh?

295
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,760
不要按!  不要乱按!
Don't do that! Don't touch those!

296
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,520
嘿  冷静  小孩子嘛
Hey, calm down. He's just a kid.

297
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,950
我们好像停了
Looks like we've stopped.

298
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,550
-我们又上了  -谢谢
- We're going again. - Thank you.

299
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,510
她呢  在这层?
Where is she? Is she here?

300
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,810
不不  我觉得不在
No, no. I don't think so.

301
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,440
快点  乔西  出发了  小子
Come on, Josh. Let's go, buddy.

302
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,240
好  留点神
Okay, stay alert.

303
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,240
她在这层?
Is she here?

304
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,570
没有  不在这儿  回电梯来
No, not here. Back in the elevator.

305
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,240
她不在这层?
She's not here?

306
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,830
拜托!  拜托!  快  快点  小孩!
Come on! Come on! Move it! Come on, boy!

307
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,340
嘿  莎拉  对不起
Hey, Sara. I'm sorry.

308
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,970
-嘿  对不起  -干什么?
- Hey. I'm sorry. - What?

309
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,980
对不起
I'm sorry.

310
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,440
"几年后"

311
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,860
我通常都是求着参加婚礼
I usually have to beg to be a part of weddings.

312
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,860
但一接获邀请  婚礼不是延期
And if I do get into the wedding, of course they postponed it,

313
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,370
就在国外举行  而我的护照刚好还过期了
and it's overseas somewhere, and they've canceled my passport,

314
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,160
然后我就参加不了婚礼  真是太荒谬了...
and I can't be a part of it, and it's ridiculous...

315
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,370
真是尴尬而且糟透了
and awkward and horrible.

316
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,790
所以  谢谢各位  我很重视这次婚礼
So thank you. I take this very seriously.

317
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,540
能做伴郎真的很荣幸
It's a gift to be the best man.

318
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,460
某君曾说过在人生中  你会遇见某人…
They say that once in your lifetime, someone comes along...

319
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,710
那个独一无二和你在一起的人
whom you're absolutely meant to be with.

320
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,920
所有的感觉都棒极了  犹如星辰闪耀
Everything feels great, stars are aligned,

321
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,180
身心都感觉到均衡
body and spirit are in balance.

322
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,850
对于我朋友乔纳森・特雷格来说
For my friend Jonathan Trager,

323
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,810
那人本来是我
that person was me.

324
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,730
但你知道  乔尼同我趣味相投
But as you know, Jonny and I were simpatico.

325
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,730
我俩亲如兄弟
We were brothers from another mother.

326
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
我俩相识在大一
We were friends since freshman year.

327
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,360
我看着他曾跟很多女人约会
I watched him go out with woman after woman,

328
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,150
但他总会爬着...
and he'd always come crawling...

329
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,200
他总会爬回来找我...
he would come crawling back to me.

330
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,870
-真是难堪死了  -你喜欢这样
- It was embarrassing. - You loved it.

331
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,330
可是有一晚  他回来后情况完全不同
But then one night he came home and things were different.

332
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,590
他不再坚持梦想成为纪录片导演...
His adolescent dream of becoming a documentary filmmaker...

333
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,500
那是过去的事了
was a thing of the past.

334
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,250
-谢天谢地  -他几乎没有反应...
- Thank God. - He hardly even responded...

335
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,340
不管我恶作剧用手指...
to my playful yet tormented flicks of my finger...

336
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,680
轻弹他脑袋在他复习期末考试时
against the soft part of his skull as he studied for finals.

337
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,430
一切皆是他找到了她
And that is because he had found her.

338
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,930
能和他厮守一生的一个女人  要说谁能胜任成...
The woman he was meant to be with. And if anyone is qualified...

339
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:54,570
他遇见的他的灵魂伴侣  这将是我  他的首任妻子
to know when he met his soul mate, it would be me,his first wife.

340
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,520
她聪明  风趣且美丽
She's smart, she's funny, she's beautiful.

341
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,370
简而言之  她是那种每个男人的梦想的女人
In short, she's the kind of woman that any man would dream about.

342
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,030
我想我们都幻想过  所以这真是带有丝丝悲伤...
And I think we all have. So it is with sadness...

343
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,990
和甜蜜  甜蜜的回忆...
and fond, fond memories...

344
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,790
我举杯敬...
that I raise my glass...

345
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,790
新任的乔纳森・特雷格太太
to the new Mrs. Jonathan Trager.

346
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
我想告诉那些
I'll tell you what.

347
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,210
我想告诉你一些事  我的挚友  如果乔尼要另娶他人
I'll tell you something. My friends, if I had to lose Jonny to anyone,

348
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,510
我认为没有比娶希莉更理想了
I can't imagine a more perfect woman than Halley.

349
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,390
向两位新人干杯
Cheers to both of you.

350
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,440
估计他十成有几成醉?
How drunk is he on a scale of one to ten?

351
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,060
十二成
Twelve.

352
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,060
你认为我们会比迪恩与考特妮更甜蜜?
You think we'll ever out-romance Dean and Courtney?

353
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,490
我不知道  我没见过他们争吵
I don't know. I don't think I've ever seen them fight.

354
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,070
我也是
Me neither.

355
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,410
吵架才能提高"性趣"
Must be a bitch on their sex life.

356
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,490
我们有石榴奶酥很棒
We have a pomegranate souffle which is amazing, which is...

357
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,240
跟果露不一样
different than the sorbet.

358
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,250
听着  我很喜欢和你们在一起
Listen, we'd love to join you guys,

359
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,710
但考特妮要早起  我不得不告辞
but Courtney has to wake up, so I got to be good.

360
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,080
哈雷  听我的  现在决定不嫁还不晚
Halley, listen to me. It's not too late to back out.

361
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,430
-晚安  迪恩  -我在166号和...
- Good night, Dean. - And I'm at 166th and...

362
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,510
晚安  考特妮
Good night, Courtney.

363
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,260
妈妈  你不想看这个  我要...  我需要依偎下
Mama, you don't want to see this. I need... I need to snuggle.

364
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,640
我得回家睡觉了  听着  你很棒
I'm gonna go sleep it off. Listen, you're wonderful.

365
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,260
晚安
Good night.

366
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,690
-你知道吗?  你需要我  -保重  我们走吧
- You know what? You need me. - Take care. Come on, hon.

367
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,770
大伙儿  听着  我很抱歉告诉你们  我也得回家了
You guys, listen, I hate to tell you, but I gotta go home too.

368
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,650
我不得不  我明早八点还得起来
I have to. I gotta get up at 8:00 in the morning.

369
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,770
我明天会很忙
My day is crazy tomorrow.

370
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,450
-进来喝一杯  -他不想进来
- Come in for one drink. - He doesn't want to come.

371
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,280
他不想进来
He doesn't have to come.

372
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,610
-二十小时后再见  -拜拜  亲爱的
- I'll see you in about 20 hours. - Bye-bye, dear.

373
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,610
-我爱你  宝贝  -晚安
- I love you, son. - Night-night.

374
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,740
-乔治  -保重
- George. - Take care.

375
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,670
你还好吗?
You okay?

376
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,210
-你最好起晚点  -嗯  为什么?
- You better be up later. - Yeah, why?

377
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,710
因为我一回家就脱光衣服
Because I'm gonna come home and get undressed...

378
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,120
嗯哼?
Uh-huh?

379
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,290
-然后爬上床  -嗯哼?
- and climb into bed, - Uh-huh?

380
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,050
假装我们才刚大吵一架
act like we just got over a terrible fight.

381
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,230
一会见
See you later now.

382
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,620
开卷有益
Reading is good for you. Knowledge.

383
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,410
阅读?
Reading?

384
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,100
-等等  等等  听着  听着  -我早就读过了
- Hold on, hold on. Listen, listen. - I read it a long time ago.

385
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,570
我愿意加送"麦迪逊之桥"
I'll throw in the screenplay to The Bridges of Madison County.

386
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,190
我看过电影  还不错
I saw the movie. It was great.

387
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,200
好  然后...
Okay, and...

388
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,870
然后就没了  我意思...  我意思是什么都没有做
And nothing. I mean... I mean, I did nothing.

389
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,920
我...  我就这样让她离开派对
I... I just let her walk out of the party...

390
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,710
然后我什么也没对她说
and I didn't say anything to her.

391
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,420
现在她永远离开我了
And now she's gone forever.

392
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,260
我是说  她是我的灵魂伴侣
I mean, she was my soul mate.

393
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,060
肯尼  老实说  我认为用这词很危险...
Kenny, I honestly think it's dangerous...

394
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,220
用这个"灵魂伴侣"
to use the term "soul mate. "

395
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,020
它意味那些难以想象的因素
It implies there's some magical element...

396
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,390
我们无法掌控
that we have no control over,

397
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,900
像是命运或缘分
like fate or destiny.

398
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,400
我认为执迷于那些会扰乱我们真正的生活
I think holding on to beliefs like that stops us doing the real work.

399
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,230
然而事实是  如果你的治疗有效
And the fact is, if your therapy stays on track,

400
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,530
我认为你将找到许多许多适合的人...
I think you'll find there are many, many people out there...

401
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,910
你也能轻松的寻到快乐
you could easily be happy with.

402
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,790
你真的信这些?  莎拉?
You truly believe all that, Sara?

403
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,990
是的  我真相信
Yeah. I really do.

404
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,670
-好了  -谢谢
- There you go. - Thanks.

405
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,430
# From the very first time I rest my eyes on you, boy #

406
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,650
# My heart said follow through #

407
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,980
# But I know now that I'm way down on your line #

408
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,120
# But the waiting feeling's fine #

409
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
# You see #

410
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,960
# I don't wanna wait in vain for your love #

411
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:17,130
# I don't wanna wait in vain for your love #

412
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:22,930
# I don't wanna wait in vain for your love... #

413
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,850
# Cause summer is here... #

414
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,730
# - And I'm still waiting there - Summer is here... #

415
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,650
# - Winter is here - Winter is here #

416
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:39,200
# I'm still waiting there #

417
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,830
# Like I said #

418
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,500
# It's been three years since I'm knocking on your door #

419
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,390
# And I still can knock some more #

420
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,180
# Ooh boy Ooh boy #

421
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,140
# Is it crazy Look, I wanna know now #

422
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,520
# For I to knock some more you see #

423
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,850
# In life I know... #

424
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,820
你得先说我愿意
You got to say yes, first.

425
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,750
我愿意
Yes.

426
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,140
-等等  -喔!
- Wait a second. - Ow!

427
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,230
-让我来...  喔!  喔!  喔!  -我自己来  我自己来
- Let me... Ow! Ow! Ow! - I got it. I got it.

428
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,350
-喔!  喔!  喔!  -我自己来
- Ow, ow. Ow! - I got it.

429
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,070
你不会误会吧  对吧  莎拉?
Okay, you're not gonna read into this, right, Sara?

430
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,570
我是说  这只是个意外  没有其他意思
I mean, it's just an accident, nothing more.

431
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:58,820
不会
No.

432
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,070
天哪  我们得拿去改改
God. We'll get it refitted.

433
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,820
它很漂亮  我很喜欢
It's beautiful. I love it.

434
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,040
你去换衣服  我要去告诉雷恩
You-You get changed. I'm gonna call Ryan,

435
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,210
告诉他你愿意
tell him you said yes.

436
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:11,080
-为什么?  他担心?  -不是关于你  是他的巡回演出
- Why? Was he worried? - Not about you. About the tour.

437
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,090
他希望把蜜月排进演出行程
He's hoping to fit the honeymoon into the schedule.

438
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,550
去波拉波拉岛怎么样?
How does Bora Bora sound?

439
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,800
很...性感?
Very... sexy-sexy?

440
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:29,230
# I don't wanna wait in vain for your love #

441
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:34,690
# I don't wanna wait in vain for your love... #

442
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,940
现在  如果你喜欢利用午休打高尔夫球
Now, if you're a golfer on a one-hour lunch break,

443
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,610
你就该用那时间来这个离...
you'd use that time up just getting to the nearest...

444
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,040
曼哈顿最近的球场
course out of Manhattan.

445
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,410
这里球道够长
All this was a long overdue solution.

446
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,120
这是五年前从废弃的码头改建的
Formerly a dilapidated pier and converted just five years ago,

447
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,450
球道长度刚好能让纽约人
the range offers the inhabitants of this concrete jungle...

448
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,510
有机会练习击球技术的场所
the chance to keep their drives straight,

449
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,010
给他们一个改善开球的场所...
their short games accurate...

450
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,130
更重要的是  带着打高尔夫的乐趣与挫折...
and most of all, brings the joys and frustrations of golf...

451
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,260
重回纽约人中
back to city folk.

452
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,020
这是纽约市ESPN新闻  尼克・罗伯特  带来的报道
This is Nick Roberts, ESPN News, New York City.

453
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,470
精彩  尼克  我们拍好了  谢谢
Superb, Nick. We got it. Thank you.

454
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,140
-亚迪  我要走了  好吗?  -拍副带怎么办?
- Artie, I gotta run, okay? - What about the B-roll shot?

455
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,150
呼叫莎拉  罗森  呼叫莎拉  罗森
Paging Sara Lawson. Paging Sara Lawson.

456
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,610
-请到练球台  -你回来能带上...
- Please come to the front desk. - Could you come back and get...

457
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,150
副带在周五?
the B-roll on Friday?

458
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,150
-好  都听你的  老板  -谢谢  先生
- Yeah. Whatever you say, boss. - Thank you, sir.

459
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,150
我是莎拉  罗森  你好  抱歉我来晚了
I'm Sara Lawson. Hi. Sorry I'm late.

460
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:19,980
你还好吧?
How are you?

461
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,540
你到第二号击球点吧
You're down at position number two.

462
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,490
噢  好的  球技差的练习区都在这儿  对吧?
Oh, right. Bad golfers all the way down there, right?

463
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,790
老兄  走吧  我们能拍
Dude, take off. We got it.

464
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,340
噢  你好  新郎
Well, hello, Mr. Marrying Man.

465
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,500
-你好  嗯  罗伦呢?  -噢  罗伦今天休息
- Hi. Uh, where's Lauren? - Oh, Lauren took the day off.

466
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,260
我叫莎拉  我今天替你理发
My name is Sara and I'm gonna cut your hair today.

467
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,350
你知道吗?
You know what?

468
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,140
我对"稍微修下"的样子不感冒...
I'm not thrilled with having that "just cut hair" look...

469
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,100
为了拍结婚照  所以...
for my own wedding, so...

470
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,730
-我只修一下  -我将在那些照片...
- I'll just take a little bit off. - I gotta live with these pictures...

471
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,270
度过我的余生
the rest of my life.

472
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,570
-我只修一下  -拜托  你知道的  嗯...
- Just a little bit. - Please, you know, uh...

473
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,270
只有你
It's you

474
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,980
和我到永远
And me forever

475
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:04,830
莎拉  微笑吧  喔!
Sara, smile Whoo!

476
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,870
难道你不会为我微笑
Won't you smile awhile for me

477
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,250
不去查理街了  带我去纽约时报...
Forget Charles Street. Take me to the New York Times...

478
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,340
42街的大厦  谢谢
building on 42nd, please.

479
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,040
-嗯哼  -莎拉...
- Mm-hmm. - Sara...

480
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,250
喔哦!
Whoo!

481
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,210
我告诉你  我不断碰到她
I'm telling you, I keep running into her.

482
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,800
我不断遇到她  事情不断发生
I keep finding it. It keeps happening.

483
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,010
她在高尔夫练习场
She was at the golf range.

484
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,140
她是个肥臀的胖妹  对吧?
She's a big girl now with big hips. All right?

485
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,390
然后因为理发师是莎拉所以我走了
Then I gotta leave 'cause Sara's gonna cut my hair,

486
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,550
遇在出租车上遇到一个人  他对着我唱"莎拉"
And the guy in the taxi, he's serenading me, "Sara. "

487
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,360
我告诉你  全宇宙都在跟我提醒她
I'm telling you, the universe keeps revealing her to me,

488
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
-搞得我心里乱糟糟的  -你就快结婚...
- screwing with my head. - You're getting married...

489
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,060
三天后
in three days.

490
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,730
-这才是重点  -这真是太邪门了
- That's my point. - It's entirely duplicitous.

491
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,070
想想  为什么非要冒着破坏自己和哈莉婚事的风险...
Think about it. Why would you risk your relationship with Halley...

492
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,700
就为了一些浮光掠影?
just to search for some pipe dream?

493
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,320
听我说完  老兄
Just hear me out, man.

494
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,530
我确信我爱哈莉  对吧?
I'm sure that I love Halley, all right?

495
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,540
也许每当你爱上某人
And maybe every time you fall in love with somebody,

496
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,540
那是完全不一样的经历
it's a completely different experience.

497
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,040
所以拿它们来比较是不对的  我懂  但...
So it's a mistake to compare them. I get it, but...

498
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,130
那好
All right.

499
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,590
那就像哈莉是教父2
It's like Halley is The Godfather, Part II.

500
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,800
她是什么?
She's what?

501
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,430
教父2  那部不可思议的电影
Godfather, Part II. That was an incredible movie.

502
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,430
可能会好过第一部  对吧?
Might be better than the original. All right?

503
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,440
但不管如何的喜欢着"教父2"
But no matter how much you love The Godfather, Part II,

504
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,440
你依然要看过第一集
you still have to see the original...

505
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,600
懂得剧情然后才能够欣赏第二集  不是吗?
to understand and appreciate the sequel, don't ya?

506
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,940
拜托  那是不是找我老朋友帮忙太过分了?
Come on. Is it too much to ask from my oldest friend to help me out?

507
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,200
你准备办一场童话般的婚礼
You've already got the fairy-tale marriage.

508
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,110
我是你的伴O
I'm the best man.

509
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,570
你在全球最大的报社工作
You work in the biggest newspaper in the world.

510
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,110
帮我找到她
Help me find her.

511
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,450
让我告诉你些什么  与流传的纽约神话搞好相反
Let me tell you something. Contrary to popular New York myth,

512
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,450
纽约时报并非无所不知
The Times is not omniscient.

513
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,420
我需要她的姓和社会保险号码
I need a last name. I need a social security number.

514
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,500
-如果我们找到那本书...  -那行不通
- If we find the book... - It-It-It's a dead end.

515
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,290
你知道的
You know that.

516
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,960
除非我们寻遍纽约所有的书店
Unless we search every book store in New York.

517
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,420
你试过了
You did that.

518
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,120
-多年前  你还记得吗?  -也许我错过那间店
- Years ago. Do you remember? - Maybe I missed a store.

519
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,680
也许有人买了又卖它回去
Maybe somebody bought it and sold it back.

520
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,300
你知道吗?
You know what?

521
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,590
我并不想参与这事儿  好吗?
I don't want any part of this. All right?

522
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,360
或许我是婚前恐惧症
Maybe I am just getting cold feet.

523
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,320
我现在告诉你  英国女人老了残得很快的
I'm telling you right now, British women do not age well.

524
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,450
我是说  多年前也许她是道美味的佳肴
You know, I mean, years ago, yes, she was a luscious treat.

525
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,830
我说  她可能看起来像一个小辣妹
You know, she probably looked like, you know, Baby Spice.

526
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,870
但现在可能成了...
But now she could look like...

527
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,000
老辣妹
Old Spice.

528
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,560
-头发剪得好啊  -噢  谢谢
- It's a great haircut. - Oh. Thanks.

529
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,730
-说你爱我  -我爱你
- Tell me you love me. - I love you.

530
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:36,530
-说几句情话吧  -比如?
- Tell me something romantic. - Like what?

531
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:39,400
我不知道  像是...
I don't know. Like...

532
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,410
像我是你全宇宙唯一的最爱

我要去臭骂下楼管

541
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,450
我不明白为什么这会关掉
I don't understand why this is going off.

542

我以为你想要圆形切工的钻戒
I thought you wanted a round-cut diamond.

Well, I mean, was that last song really inspired by my sister?

554
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,710
每个艺术家都需要自己的思女神
Every artist needs his muse.

555
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,500
-谁想听好消息?  -嘿  我付你钱就是要好消息的

He's right, Sara. I mean, a couple of extra weeks...

569
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,990
卡露莲希望你玩久一点...

570

Sara, it was a movie poster. It's no big deal.

589
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,160

It's peculiar though, right? Don't you think?

590
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,580

Look, I thought you were through with all this New Age bullshit...

591
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,630
像是星座  风水那些不削一顾
like horoscopes and feng shui and all the crap.

592
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,210
伊芙  就开New  Age店的人来说
Eve, for someone who owns a New Age store,

593

你还真是世俗
you are alarmingly earthbound.

594
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,920
噢  是吗?  对于一个心理医生
Oh, yeah? And for a shrink-in-training,

Great. You see, that is what happens...

601
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,940
当人迷上新世纪生活
when people get hooked on the New Age life.

602

他们坐在家里烧蜡烛祈求真命天子...
They end up sitting at home burning candles for Mr. Right...

603
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:04,370

when Mr. Good Enough For Right Now is waiting at the corner bar.

604
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,910

00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,560
你要店员...
You need an employee...

661
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,640
陪同才可以进去
to get you in.

很自然
A natural.

665
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,100
-是吗?  -对  非常自然
- Yeah? - Yeah. Really natural.

666
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,520
-不不不  打住  打住  打住  -有什么问题?
- No, no, no. Cut, cut, cut. - What's the problem?

667
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,490
问题是不能赶走残暴的
The problem is you can't fend off an army of bloodthirsty

668
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,780
维京人用一支西奈笛子
Vikings with a shehnai.

669
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,120
-不合逻辑  -不  瞧  不  不
- It's illogical. - No, see... No, no.

670
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,080
你用音乐降服他们
You're lulling them into submission with the music.

671
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,500
那才能衬托出整首歌曲主题
That's the whole point of the song, really.

672
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,250
神秘的降服
"Mystic Surrender. "

673
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,090
你不觉得他看起来很讨厌音乐?
You don't think he looks like he hates the music?

674
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,500
不  嘿
No. Hey.

675
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,640
嘿  宝贝
Hey, baby.

00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,180
这人像亚历坚尼斯那么棒
Now, this guy, he's-he's like Alec Guinness. So good.

677
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:26,470
对
Yeah.

星球大战的欧比王

679
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,810
很好  就这儿  他们在做什么?
All right, right here, what are they doing?

680
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,650
他们什么态度?
What's their attitude?

681
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,810
-他们在想什么?  这些人是谁?
- What are they thinking? Who are these people?

682
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,230
他们敬畏的无话可说
They're in awe and speechless.

683
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:41,820
他们满怀感激  营养不良  入不敷出
And they're just grateful. Underfed. Underpaid.

684
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,950
他们怎么不叫我搬去村里住?
Why don't they ask me to stay in the village and have a feast?

685
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,960
是  莎拉  嘿
Yeah. Sara, hey.

686
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,920
-能谈几分钟吗?  -可以
- Can we talk for a sec? - Sure.

687
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,920
正好  嗯  我要走了
Okay, yeah, I'm going to split, guys.

688
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,630
拉斯  我会跟导演谈谈
Lars, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna talk to the director...

689
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,470
我会叫他这段修改一下
and I'm gonna have him tweak that whole section.

690
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:02,510
-放心好了  -我会告诉他加上设宴招待那一幕
- It'll be fine. It'll be fine. - Tell him about the feast.

691
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,470
-什么事  -我昨天遗失了钥匙
- What's going on? - I lost my keys yesterday.

692
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,440
-那可麻烦  -我后来...
- Oh, that's a drag. - And I've just...

693
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,020
在冰箱里找到了
found them in the freezer.

694
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,440
我没懂  那是个玩笑?
I don't get it. Is that a joke?

695
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,440
不  拉斯  那不是玩笑
No, Lars, it's not a joke.

696
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,440
我感觉自己心神不宁
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

697
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,490
婚礼  巡回演出  我的病人
It's the wedding plans and the tour and my patients.

698
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,490
好多事要处理
It's just a bit too much to deal with.

699
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:26,670
好  莎拉  听着  我们明早就去多伦多了
Okay, Sara, look. We're leaving for Toronto in the morning,

700
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:29,500
-所以现在可别崩溃  -我知道
- so don't fall apart on me now. - I know, I know, I know.

701
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,670
所以我想分开一下
And that's why I think I need a little break.

702
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,170
你什么意思  分开下?
What do you mean, a little break?

703
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,180
不  不是那种分开
No, not that kind of little break.

704
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,050
我的意思是走开一个周末给自己充个电...
I just mean a weekend away to recharge my batteries...

705
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,130
再整理下思绪
and clear my head.

706
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,340
嘿  这跟那天晚上无关
Hey, this has nothing to do with the other night.

707
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:47,060
我需要渡假  很需要
I just need this. I need it for me.

708
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,520
但除非你点头我是不会离开
But I won't go unless you say it's okay.

709
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,890
-没关系  -谢谢你
- It's okay. - Thank you.

710
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,900
好吧  你要去哪?  你要去哪?
Okay. Where are you going? Where are you going?

711
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,450
噢  我不知道  纽约  也许
Oh, I don't know. New York, maybe.

712
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,620
-生日快乐!  -噢  天哪
- Happy birthday. - Oh, my God.

713
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,170
你是认真的?  到外地去玩
Are you serious? Get out of town.

714
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,260
对  是这样想的
Yeah, that's the idea.

715
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,380
-谢了  等会再说  -好
- Thanks. Talk to you soon. - Okay.

716
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,300
这真不敢相信
This is unbelievable.

717
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,850
莎拉  真的  你真太破费了
Sara, really, this is way too generous of you.

718
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,930
噢  少来  女生就不能给点惊喜...
Oh, come on. Can't a girl do something nice...

719
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,430
为她好友的生日?
for her friend on her birthday?

720
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,430
没别的动机?
There's no ulterior motives?

721
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,780
嗯  有
Well, yeah.

722
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,490
我一个星期后就嫁人  我就想婚前...
I'm getting married in a week and I'd just like to have...

723
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,280
最后来次旅行
one last fling...

724
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,280
跟我的好友再疯一次
with my best friend before I walk down the aisle.

725
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,440
-说得真好听  但  你知道的  你真不是我的类型
- It's so sweet. But, you know, you're really not my type.

726
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,120
喔  谢了
Oh, thanks.

727
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,450
-我们要去纽约?  -对呀!
- We're going to New York? - Yeah. Yea!

728
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,590
# I want you to get together #

729
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,720
# I want you to get together #

730
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,320
# I want you to get together #

731
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,660
# Put your hands together one time #

732
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,950
# I want you to get together #

733
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,990
# I want you to get together #

734
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,500
嘿!  抱歉
Hey! Excuse me.

735
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,840
-为什么那么紧张?  -因为你...
- Why so tense? - Because you're...

736
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,920
惹毛我了  懂吗?
freaking me out, all right?

737
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,960
你没别的地方呆着吗?
Is there another space you can be in?

738
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,090
噢  抱歉啊
Oh. Excusez-moi.

739
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,460
-嗯哼  -你是做什么的?
- Uh-huh. - And what is it you do?

740
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,760
我的销售店员朋友  我开始为...
Why, my sales clerk friend, I happen to write for...

741
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,640
一家小报社工作
a little publication.

742
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,510
也许你听过  都叫它《纽约时报》
Maybe you've heard of it. It's called the New York Times.

743
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,970
-哦  -是
- Oh. - Yeah.

744
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,690
喂  谁?
Hello. Who?

745
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:03,660
迪恩?  阁下是?
Dean? And who may I say is calling?

746
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,990
哈?  等一等  你的编辑
Huh? Hang on. Your editor.

747
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,160
嗨  没
Hi. No.

748
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,670
还没有时间去写那一篇  嗯...
Didn't get a chance to write that one. Uh...

749
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,670
那一篇也还没写
Didn't write that one either.

750
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:20,010
呃  恕我直言  先生  他们明天依旧还是死人
Uh, with all due respect, sir, they'll all still be dead tomorrow.

751
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:25,010
好  谢谢  拜拜
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

752
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,890
-你专写讣告  -没错
- You write for the obituaries. - Absolutely. Yeah.

753
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,730
-你一定很自豪  -嗯哼  我是一个...
- You must be very proud. - Uh-huh. I'm the one...

754
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:30,480
和最后一句话
with the last word.

755
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,900
-今晚不是  我认为不是  -绝对是
- Not tonight. I don't think so. - Yes, I am. Absolutely.

756
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,480
-机会渺茫  最后一行  -还在说  嗯  这儿
- Fat chance. Last line. - Still talking. Yeah, right here.

757
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,320
我不知道  我不知道  我眼睛很痛
I don't know. I don't know. My eyes are killing me.

758
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,320
-告诉我那些数字  -我来告诉你
- Tell me these numbers match. - I'll tell you.

759
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,320
-让我看看  -别那样
- Let me see. - Don't do that.

760
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,410
-啊!  -是0293吗?
- Ah-ah! - Is it 0293?

761
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:50,380
0293  恭喜
0293. Congratulations.

762
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,380
-你找到了?  -我想你找到她了
- You got it? - I think you found her.

763
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:57,040
可惜她的姓被弄花掉了
Too bad the last name's completely smudged out, though.

764
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,260
这是他的错  是他的拇指
Well, it's his fault. It was his thumb.

765
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:02,590
当他抢纸时  拇指刚好刷到了姓
When he grabbed it, his thumb went right across the name.

766
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,890
当然  开玩笑的  这本来就花了
Completely. I'm kidding. It was smudged in my hand.

767
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,300
-你能停一停吗?  -这只是个小玩笑
- Would you stop it? - It's just a little joke.

768
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:07,350
那是给你的复写纸
That's carbon paper for you.

769
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,900
我猜这就是为什么美国没人用它了
I guess that's why America rejected it.

770
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,980
地址呢?  是她的吗?
What's that address? Is that her address?

771
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,400
那是七年前的了  兄弟
That's seven years ago, man.

772
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,560
所以去房屋出租管理署...
So go to the building leasing office...

773
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:17,570
然后你就能查到七年前谁住那里
and you'll find out who lived there seven years ago.

774
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,070
这又不难
It ain't rocket science.

775
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,160
谢谢
Thank you.

776
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,750
-嗨  -嘿
- Hi. - Hey.

777
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,760
-去哪里?  -嗯  我们去哪里?
- Where to? - Yeah, where are we going?

778
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,800
嗯  好的  载我们...纽约随便一个地方
Uh, okay, take us... anywhere in New York.

779
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:41,970
什么?
Excuse me?

780
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,970
你想去哪就去哪
Anywhere. Wherever you feel like going.

781
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,730
-那不是目的地  小姐  -等等  你没有订房?
- That's not a destination, lady. - Wait. You didn't make reservations?

782
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,810
嗯  好  伊芙  不要生我气
Um, okay, Eve, please don't get mad at me.

783
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,310
什么?
What?

784
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,980
噢  不  我真不敢相信
Oh, no. I cannot believe this.

785
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,440
我需要目的地  小姐
I need a borough here, ladies.

786
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,650
我本来打算在飞机上告诉你
I was gonna tell you when we got on the plane.

787
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,110
你知道吗?  你那真的做得太隐藏了  莎拉
You know what? That's really sneaky of you, Sara.

788
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,450
-我不懂心灵感应  -依芙  等等!
- I'm not a bloody psychic. - Eve, wait!

789
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:03,570
等一下!
Wait!

790
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,160
-依芙!  依芙!  -你耍我
- Eve. Eve! - You tricked me.

791
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,790
我知道要是说实话你就不来了
I knew you wouldn't come if I told you the truth.

792
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,960
我需要我最好的朋友和我一起
I needed my best friend with me.

793

你想做什么  莎拉?

797
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,810
在飞机上  我一直...
I've just spent the entire flight...

798
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:30,140
望着天际发愣  脑海浮现的
staring into the sky, thinking.

799
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,860
不是我的未婚夫  而是那个神秘的人...
Not about my fiance, but about this mystery guy...

800
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,860
我曾一百万零半小时前遇到的
I met a million and a half hours ago.

一个我几乎不记得  只剩下...

依稀印象在脑海里
vague picture I have inside my head.

803
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,620
那虽然很短暂  很片段  真的
It was just a few seconds. A fragment, really.

804
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,290
但一切就像...
And it was like...

805
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,710
在那一刻
in that moment,

806
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,210
整个宇宙因我俩相聚而闪亮
the whole universe existed just to bring us together.

807
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,630
那就是为什么我要在这儿
That's why I'm here.

808
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:03,850
那就是为什么我想让命运带我到任何地方
That's why I'm gonna let fate take me wherever it wants to go.

809
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:08,100
因为当这一切结束  我就不会...
Because when all this is over, at least I'm never gonna have...

810
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,020
再惦记他
to think of him ever again.

811
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,030
让他最好变成秃头大老粗...
Let's just pray he's a bald fascist...

815
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,060
你们要去哪?
Where are you going?

816
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,220
你最好帮我买个大生日蛋糕
You better be buying me one frigging big birthday cake,

817
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:45,060
那正是我想说的
that's all I gotta say.

818
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,060
我能知道你们要去哪里吗?

我跟你走
And I'm gonna follow.

822
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:02,030
你能自己做到  只是打开电脑然后看看
You can do it yourself. Just open up the computer and look into it.

823
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,330
我很不确定我能给你们这些资料
I'm not even sure that I can give you this information.

824
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,530
你怎么会不行?
If you can't, why can't you?

825
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,080
因为我只是临时工  不清楚规定
Because I'm just a temp, okay? I don't know the rules.

00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,000
叫莎拉的住?
first name Sara?

924
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,000
很迷人  深色头发像那种神秘
Attractive, dark hair, kind of, like, mysterious,

925
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,210
你知道  真的很有气质...
you know, really amazing...

926
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:55,250
-女孩  -有
-girl. - Oui.

927
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,050
-你知道去哪找她吗?
- Do you know where we can locate this individual?

928
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:58,720
不  我不知道
No, I do not.

929
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,510
-你记得她姓什么吗?  -不
- Do you remember her last name? - No.

930
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,930
噢  少来了  你会不记得名字的姓...
Oh, come on. You don't even remember the last name...

931
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:03,510
你的前任女友?
of your ex-girlfriend?

932
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:06,550
-我觉得太难相信  -你根本不懂
- I find that hard to believe. - You don't understand anything.

933
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,020
她不是我女友  她只是  嗯  一个室友
She was not my girlfriend. She was just, uh, a roommate.

934
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,060
她在这里住过一阵
She stayed with me for a very short period of time.

935
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:15,020
-他来这里跟我住通过...  -室友中介服务?
- She was placed with me by... - A roommate finder's service?

936
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,780
对  她跟男友来我这住过几个月...
Oui. She stayed with me with her boyfriend for a few months...

937
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:21,320
-我不关心他  -后来男友搬走
- I don't care about him. - And then he moved out...

938
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:22,030
很快
very quickly.

939
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:25,570
到了年底  她也搬走了
And at the end of the year, she moved out too.

940
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,580
是  但她没有留下任何东西
Yeah, but did she leave anything behind,

941
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:30,370
她也许留下什么东西有她名字像是收据  帐单?
maybe with her last name on it, like a receipt, a bill?

942
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,580
-像是一点行李?  -没有没有
- Like a piece of luggage? - No. No, no.

943
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:35,800
任何东西都行  真的  任何东西
Anything would help, really. Anything.

944
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,180
我记得她坐在我旁边
I remember she sat on me.

945
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,800
她...她坐在你旁边?
She... She sat on you?

946
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,810
是  她坐在我旁边一会儿
Yes. She sat on me for a while.

947
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,640
我觉得她...
I found her...

948
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,270
有灵感
inspiring.

949
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:56,450
我猜那就是为什么我一开始就画了她
I guess that is why I started painting her in the first place.

950
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,450
噢  她坐在你旁边  抱歉
Oh. She sat for you. I'm sorry.

951
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:01,280
我是这么说的
That is what I said.

952
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,780
-他说的没错  -我是那么说的
- That's what he said. - That's what I said.

953
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,910
清楚了
Clearly.

954
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,540
你的画还在吗?
Do you happen to have the painting?

955
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,510
嘿  现在你将看到后明白一切
Hey, now you're gonna see what it's all about.

956
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:20,800
你知道  你瞧她的脸
You know, you see her face.

957
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,420
好  嗯
Okay. Yeah.

958
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,180
这就是她  对吧?
This is her, yes?

959
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,680
嗯  当然  眼睛一圈有点
Yeah, sure. Around the eyes a little.

960
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:35,610
我意思  我很确信这是英国风格  你知道
I mean, I'm definitely getting the British thing, you know,

961
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,280
还有皇冠跟权杖
with the crown and the scepter.

962
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,360
你记得室友中介服务名字吗?
Do you have a name for the roommate finder's service?

963
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,610
他们会有资料
They would have the information.

964
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:43,290
不  不知道
No, I do not.

965
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:48,000
但如果有帮助  我记得那服务社在本地
But if it helps, I do remember where the service was located.

966
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,910
-当然  -是!  在哪里?  哪里?
- Absolutely! - Yes! Where? Where?

967
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,550
-曼哈顿  -曼哈顿哪里  米尼翁先生?
- Manhattan. - Where in Manhattan, Mr. Mignon?

968
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,670
在第60街
On 60th Street.

969
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:01,010
-东边还是西边?  -它就靠着那个...
- East side or west side? - It was just next to that......

970
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:05,600
那间小糕点店左边
on the left of that splendid little patisserie,

971
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,680
情有独钟
Serendipity.

972
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,270
就在那里
That's it.

973
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,480
准备好了
Get... Get ready.

974
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,830
生日快乐  老板请客
Happy birthday. It's on the house.

975
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,910
谢谢
Thank you.

976
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,910
谢了
Thanks.

977
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,370
噢  我真是个损友
Oh, I'm a god-awful friend.

978
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:34,050
不  只要你不唱歌
No, you will be if you sing.

979
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,050
伊芙  太感谢你能跟着我
Eve, thanks so much for coming with me.

980
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:40,170
不客气
You're welcome.

981
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,850
莎拉  你知道  这是个很美妙的想法
Sara, you know, it's a wonderful thought.

982
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,430
人生冥冥之中自有主宰
The idea that all of life, that every single event...

983
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,100
这是老天安排的...
is part of some master plan...

984
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,190
决定去引导我们的世界找到灵魂伴侣
designed to lead us to our universal soul mate.

985
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:55,230
但如果那是真的  那生活的意义何在?
But if that's really true, then what's the point of living?

986
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,650
抉择的意义呢?  该死  为什么让我们甚至...
Or making decisions? Hell, why should we even...

987
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,190
在早上起床?
get out of bed in the morning?

988
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:01,080
为了个蛋糕?
For the cake?

989
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,080
不  不是为蛋糕
No. Not for cake.

990
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,780
所以当你犯了个错误
So that you make mistakes.

991
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:09,280
就像这次旅行的错误
Mistakes like this trip.

992
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:12,380
如果你够聪明  你能从错误中汲取教训
And if you're smart enough, you learn from your mistakes.

993
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,710
你想清楚  你想想
You figure it out. You-You think.

994
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,630
你认识到人生并非一出精心制作的舞台剧...
You realize that life isn't some elaborate stage play...

995
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,390
有导演和演员
with directions for the actors.

996
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:21,470
生活就是一团糟  莎拉
Life's a mess, Sara.

997
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:24,550
它是  它是混乱的化身
It's-It's chaos personified.

998
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,770
我得放弃找他了  对吧?
I have to give it all up now, don't I?

999
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,770
莎拉  你有未婚夫
Sara, you have a fiance who,

1000
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,810
尽管他的古怪东方音乐
despite his weird Eastern music,

1001
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,950
我们希望那只是一时的兴趣
which we hope is just a phase, let's hope,

1002
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,950
非常非常爱你
loves you very, very, very much.

1003
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,990
这不叫放弃  这是成长
It's not giving up. It's growing up.

1004
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,080
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

1005
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,960
好吧
Yeah.

1006
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,980
-那有一辆  -噢  拦下它
- Here's one. - Ooh, catch it.

1007
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:26,460
-这是间婚纱店  -噢  天啊  真讽刺
- It's a bridal shop. - Oh, my God. The irony.

1008
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,290
在这等着  我马上回来  在这儿等着
Wait right here. I'll be right back. Stay here.

1009
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,420
为什么?
Why?

1010
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,010
-请问几点了?  -嗯  大概7:30
- Time, please? - Uh, about 7:30.

1011
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,090
好  好
Right. Right.

1012
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,390
他们搬去市区了  如果我们幸运的赶上车  我们还能撞见它
They moved downtown. If we get lucky with traffic, we can still hit it.

1013
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,390
-几点婚礼彩排?  -来不及
- What time is rehearsal? - Can't do it.

1014
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,390
-出租车!  -都结束了  兄弟
- Taxi! - It's over, man.

1015
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,900
什么?
What?

1016
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:58,570
-你说什么?  -我怎能忽视那个?
- What are you talking about? - How can I ignore that?

1017
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,530
"祝福那讨厌新娘"?
"Bless the goddamn bride"?

1018
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:00,570
-什么?  -我不懂...
- What? - It can't get...

1019
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:01,900
这再清楚也不过了
any more clearer than this.

1020
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:04,400
我不支持这么做  那没有在卡里
I'm not supposed to be doing this. It's not in the cards.

1021
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:06,460
嘿  那是另一条你的线索  兄弟
Hey, it's another one of your clues, man.

1022
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,910
咱们上车再说...
Let's talk about it in the cab...

1023
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,540
-所有的线索都断了  -那不是线索  那是征兆
- on the way over. - It's not a clue. It's a sign.

1024
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,420
-有区别吗?  -线索是侦探...
- What's the difference? - A clue is what a detective...

1025
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:15,760
用来找疑犯
uses to find a suspect.

1026
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,090
收条  货仓  法国人  这些...
The receipt, the warehouse, that French guy... those...

1027
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,220
是线索  而这是征兆
are clues. This is a sign.

1028
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,220
我怎么也找不到那本书  那是征兆
Me never finding the book, that's a sign.

1029
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,550
莎拉怎么也找不到那张5块钞票  那是征兆
Sara never finding the $5.00 bill, that's a sign.

1030
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:26,180
没发生的事怎么会是征兆?
How could something not happening be a sign?

1031
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,230
也许缺少征兆就是征兆
Maybe the absence of signs is a sign.

1032
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:30,730
是吗?
Isn't it?

1033
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,930
那很清楚
That's lucid.

1034
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:35,240
听着  我不知道  兄弟  也许没有什么命运
Look, I don't know, man. Maybe there is no fate.

1035
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:39,610
如果有  对我也没起作用
And if there is, it's not working for me.

1036
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:42,570
你知道  这真不应该这样结束的
You know, it's not actually supposed to end this way, by the way.

1037
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:45,410
我们应该拨开表象看本质  对吧?
We're supposed to pull the curtain and see the wizard, all right?

1038
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,410
-追寻到底  -这就是底
- Get to the end of the river. - This is the end of the river.

1039
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,250
我的婚礼彩排...
My wedding rehearsal...

1040
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:50,250
不到一小时开始
starts in less than an hour.

1041
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,410
=我的未婚妻在等我  -让我在这儿问你件事
- My bride is waiting for me. - Let me ask you something here.

1042
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,460
假如莎拉突然出现在这儿  呼一下  掉下来  那么...
If Sara were here right now, poof, came down, what would...

1043
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:56,420
她会叫你怎样做?
she tell you to do?

1044
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:58,760
她会告诉我快跑  别慢吞吞的去沃尔杜夫酒店...
She would tell me to run, not walk to the Waldorf...

1045
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,090
因为所有征兆就是要去结婚
because all the signs point to me getting married.

1046
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:03,100
看  婚纱  都是白色
Look. Wedding dress. Lots of white.

1047
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,720
-我讨厌叙述事实...  -叙述它
- I hate to state the obvious... - State it.

1048
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:09,470
如果你不这样做  就永远不知道莎拉是谁
If you don't do this, you may never find out who Sara is.

1049
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,320
也许我不应该
Maybe I was never supposed to.

1050
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,280
也许所有这一切只是幻...
Maybe all this is just a maze...

1051
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,820
设计好引导我回到最初的地方
designed to lead me directly back to where I started.

1052
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:24,040
就是结婚
Which is getting married.

1053
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:31,170
真该发明治这种病的药

And you can bring your... partner if you want.

1073
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,300
-噢!  -噢!  不不
- Oh! - Oh! No, no.

1074

再见  我亲爱的同性恋人
Good-bye, my sweet lesbian lady lover.

1079
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:45,320
我只是开玩笑  我们之前习惯开玩笑
I'm just kidding. It's just a joke between us.

1080
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:59,430
拉斯?
Lars?

1081
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:01,800
你在这儿做什么?
What are you doing?

1082
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:05,640
-你怎么知道我住这?  -直觉

真的?
Really?

1084
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,270
不  我用纽约酒店指南
No. I went through the New York Hotel Guide.

1085
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:14,690
按字母表顺序  反向查找  我最开始查"Z"
Alphabetically, in reverse. I started with "Z. "

1086
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:17,240
莎拉  我好想你
Sara, I missed you so much.

1087
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:22,110
对不起  我不是怪你离开
I'm sorry. I don't blame you for running away.

1088
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:27,370
我太...  投入专辑跟MV了
I was so... focused on the album, the video.

1089
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:32,620
我  乔纳森  娶你哈莉作我的妻子
I, Jonathan, take you, Halley, to be my wife,

1090
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,620
我承诺爱你并维护你...
and I promise to love and sustain you...

1091
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:37,680
从今以后在婚姻的牵绊
in the bond of marriage from this day forward.

1092
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,450
当然  乔纳森  你到时你会望着哈莉
And obviously, Jonathan, you'll be looking at Halley.

1093
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:02,950
那就是实际流程...
And that's when the actual...

1094
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:04,450
仪式就会完毕
ceremony will conclude.

1095
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,620
打扰下  我这里需要点帮助
Excuse me. I need some help over here.

1096

然后...然后你就成婚了
And then... then you're married.

1098
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:12,250
那女的是谁?
Hal, who's that girl over there?

1099
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:15,670
-噢  我的老朋友  伊芙  -哦

1101
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,720
现在只要保证明早...
And now make sure to be here tomorrow morning...

1102
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,300
九点整来拍照
at 9:00 sharp for pictures.

1103
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,390
我讨厌破坏好事  但是我们有一些脱衣舞娘...
I hate to break up a good thing, but we have some strippers...

1104
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,310
等着我们  我们迟到了
waiting for us. We're late.

1105
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:27,770
-你是指"艳舞女O"  -不不  我意思"脱光光"...
- You mean "exotic dancers. " - No, no. I mean "strippers. "...

1106
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:30,140
-舞女全部脱光  -我九点见你
- The women who take off everything. - I'll see you men at 9:00.

1107

But remember, I promised Judy I'd be home by 10:00.

1108

哈莉  那是什么?  你怎么了?
Halley, what is it? What's wrong?

1124
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:17,030
是你
It's you.

1125
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:18,940
你什么意思  是我?  我做了什么?
What do you mean, it's me? What did I do?

1126
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:19,690
没什么  确切说
Nothing, exactly.

1127
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:22,950
只是我有种感觉像...
It's just this feeling I have, like......

1128
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,990
你过去几天都精神恍惚
like you've been somewhere else for the past few days.

1129
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,990
-我没有  -别骗我  乔纳森
- That's not true. - Don't lie to me, Jonathan.

1130
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:34,420
我这辈子最大的梦想就是结婚
I've dreamed about this my entire life, and-and...

1131
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:37,050
我憧憬过婚纱和捧花...
I've imagined the dress and the flowers...

1132
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:40,000
甚至连乐队要演奏的曲子都想好了
and even the music the band was gonna play.

1133
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:44,560
一切如我所愿  除了我的未婚夫
And everything is exactly the way I want it, except for my fiance,

1134
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,930
他心思完全不在这里
who's just decided to float off to Never-Never Land.

1135
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,100
听着  也许过去的一周我是有点分心
Look, maybe I've been a little bit out of it the past week,

1136
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:51,440
但这是正常的  你知道  男人的事
but it's just normal, you know, guy stuff.

1137
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,150
有一点点怯弱  但是并不代表我不爱你
It's a little cold feet. Doesn't mean I don't love you.

1138
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:53,820
嗯  是我想太多
Well, call me crazy,

1139
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,940
但我想要我的未婚夫更娇勇敢的去面对
but I'd like my fiance's feet to be warm,

1140
01:03:56,070 --> 01:04:00,580
特别是当我们没几小时就要成婚
especially when we're hours from going down the aisle.

1141
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:04,950
对不起  哈莉  真的
I'm sorry, Hal. Really, I am.

1142
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:08,370
无论你有什么放不开
Whatever it is that you're holding on to,

1143
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:12,460
求你设法放开吧
please just let it go.

1144
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,790
求求你
Please.

1145
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,090
我想我已经准备放开了  好吗?
I think it already let go of me, okay?

1146
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:23,890
等下
Wait.

1147
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:28,430
-这是什么?  -你觉得呢?
- What's this? - What do you think?

1148
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:31,440
这是传统的新O礼物嘛
It's the traditional groom's gift.

1149
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,270
我买了你的  忘带来了
I got yours, and I forgot to bring it.

1150
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,690
我知道  没关系
I know. It's okay.

1151
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:38,110
打开它
Open it.

1152
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:47,370
这是初版
It's a first edition.

1153
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,580
你每次去书店
It's just that every time we go into a book store,

1154
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:51,130
你都去翻这本书
you're always flipping through it.

1155
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:55,580
然后我这周找过  你没有这本书
And I checked this week. You don't even have a copy.

1156
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,650
怎么了?  你不喜欢它?
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

1157
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,690
太完美了
It's perfect.

1158
01:05:15,770 --> 01:05:17,950
这是个绝佳的选择
It's an excellent choice.

1159
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,460
# When you know #

1160
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:31,370
# That you know #

1161
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,460
# Who you love #

1162
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:36,300
# You can't deny it #

1163
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,680
发生什么了?  你没事吧?
What's going on? Are you all right?

1164
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,180
她名字叫莎拉  托马斯
Her name's Sara Thomas.

1165
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,220
什么?
What?

1166
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,310
怎么...
How did...

1167
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:52,350
哈莉作为结婚礼物给我的
Halley gave it to me as a wedding gift.

1168
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:57,150
# Never let him go... #

1169
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,650
# 'Cause you know #

1170
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,070
# And you know that you know #

1171
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:08,790

我听不见
I can't hear a thing.

1178
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:32,560
亲爱的  一分钟  好  说  什么事?

# You can feel love's around you #

1183
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:59,510
# Like the sky round the moon #

1184
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:04,720
# This is how love has found you #

1185
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:10,060
# Now you know what to do #

1186
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,400
# When you know #

1187
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:19,440
噢  看那些星星
Oh. Look at those stars.

1188
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,910
你知道它们都有名字的
They all have names, you know.

1189
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:26,290
我不知道那个叫什么
I don't know what that is.

1190
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:43,260
那是仙后座
It's Cassiopeia.

1191
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:50,270
是...天上的星座
The... stars in the sky.

1192
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,690
那是仙后座
It's Cassiopeia.

1193
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,030
你知道航班延误  如果我们回程飞机起飞...
You realize with the time delay, if our return flight takes off...

1194
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,160
超过10分钟
more than ten minutes late,

1195
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,160
我就错过我的婚礼  对吧?
I miss my own wedding, okay?

1196
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,790
那不会困扰你吗?
Does that bother you in the slightest?

1197
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,040
你这个大混蛋
You are a jackass.

1198
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:17,380
-好  谢谢  -你是  你...
- Well, thank you. - You are. You...

1199
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,470
你你你是我的大英雄  你知道吗?
Y- Y-You're my hero, you know?

1200
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:23,180
你就像我的神谕和狗屎  你知道吗?
You're like my oracle and shit, you know?

1201
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:27,550
你就在那儿  兄弟  你让它发生了
You're out there, man, and you're making it happen.

1202
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,980
考特妮搬出去了
Courtney moved out.

1203
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:38,950
-什么?  -是的  这...听着  兄弟
- What? - Yeah. It's... Look, man.

1204
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:43,160
我们真的吵很久了
We'd been fighting for a really long time.

1205
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,240
怎么你不告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me?

1206
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,160
我不想影响你的婚礼  兄弟
We didn't want to ruin your wedding, man.

1207
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,290
不想浇灭你对的婚姻美好的看法  兄弟
Didn't want to rain on your parade, man.

1208
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,580
到底他妈的出什么事了?
What the hell happened?

1209
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,710
我们只是...
We just...

1210
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,630
我们的爱消逝了  你知道吗?
We let it slip away, you know?

1211
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:59,050
这是重点  爱...你知道  爱熄灭了
That's the point. It... You know, it died.

1212
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:01,930
-我们关系结束  -你们结束的原因是?
- We died. - What was the cause of death?

1213
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:07,650
对爱的信心
Not enough of all of this, of this, of this.

1214
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:11,480
远远不够  你知道吗?  你还...
And not enough, you know? Do you...

1215
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,150
你还记得哲学家爱比克泰德吗?
Do you remember the philosopher Epictetus?

1216
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:14,230
你记得他怎么说?
You remember what he said?

1217
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:17,320
他说:"如果你想不断提高  必须满足承受..."
He said, "If you want to improve, be content to be...

1218
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:19,070
被人认为是愚蠢无知的
thought foolish and stupid. "

1219
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,360
这正是你在做的
That's what you've done.

1220
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:26,210
-我可努力了  -现在我只想当个混蛋
- I work hard at it. - Now I want to be a jackass.

1221
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:30,420
你知道吗?  你就像坨屎!
You know? You're the shit!

1222
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,000
那正是我  一坨屎
That would be me, the shit.

1223
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,050
对  他是一坨屎
Yeah. He's the shit. Okay.

1224
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:21,050
你知道吗  老友?  重新考虑后
You know what, old buddy? On second thought,

1225
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:22,300
也许你应该打个电话先
maybe you should call first.

1226
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,590
-你在说什么?  -给我电话
- What are you talking about? - Give her a ring.

1227
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,310
那样比较礼貌
It's more polite that way.

1228
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,310
打给她才有机会整理下房间
Calling her gives her a chance to clean up.

1229
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,310
我不关心房间干净不干净!
I don't care how clean her house is!

1230
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,310
-他也许关心  -你在说什么啊?
- She might. - What are you talking about?

1231
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:32,350
-你叫我去的!  你刚才才说我是大英雄!
- You told me to go! You said I was your hero!

1232
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,270
我不准你看
I forbid you to look.

1233
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:36,320
-你不能看!  -你干嘛抱住我?
- You can't look! - Why are you hanging on?

1234
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:40,190
我不想你受伤  不想受伤!
I don't want you to get hurt. Don't get hurt!

1235
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,280
你弄疼我了!
You're hurting me!

1236
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:22,410
我想那会是愉快的
I think that went very well.

1237
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:25,740
不是...不是她说凡事都有原因吗?
Didn't... Didn't she say that everything happens for a reason?

1238
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:27,740
-是  她说过  -那好  也许我们...
- Yeah, she did. - Well, maybe we're...

1239
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:28,990
躺在这儿因为...
laying here because...

1240
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,800
因为什么?
Because why?

1241
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:36,300
因为你不想站在其他地方
Because you don't want to be standing somewhere else.

1242
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,570
我明白了  对  我们爬过去  我们爬过去
I see. Yeah. We're crawling. We're crawling.

1243
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:52,900
女士们先生们  我是机长
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking.

1244
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:55,440
我很抱歉告诉大家我们要稍微在地面多待会儿...
I'm sorry to report that we're gonna be on the ground a little longer...

1245
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,480
因为一些坏天气作祟
due to some bad weather heading this way.

1246
01:11:57,570 --> 01:11:59,520
航管中心让我们要等待下
The air traffic controller has put us on hold,

1247
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:02,910
所以与此同时我叫机上乘务员...
so in the meantime, I've asked the cabin attendants...

1248
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:04,160
开始播放电影
to start the movie.

1249
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,080
-嘿  你准备好了?  -是
- Hey, you getting ready? - Yeah.

1250
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,750
你知道我  我喜欢参加婚礼
You know me. I love a good wedding.

1251
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,500
-你跟拉斯谈过了?  -是的
- So have you talked to Lars? - Yeah.

1252
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:15,460
我们今早他走前谈了
We spoke this morning before he left.

1253
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:18,710
我想他不会有事  希望如此
I think he's gonna be okay. At least I hope so.

1254
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:22,760
他当然没事  你也会没事的
Of course he's gonna be okay, and you're gonna be okay too.

1255
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:25,300
对了?
Yeah?

1256
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:28,260
噢  你知道吗?  那边有个女的盯着我
Oh, you know what? There's a lady glaring at me.

1257
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,360
我觉得我不能再讲手机了
I don't think I'm supposed to be on the phone.

1258
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,770
我能回到家再打给你?
Can I call you when I get home?

1259
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,770
祝你安全飞行  好吗?
Have a safe flight, okay?

1260
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,980
-我爱你  拜  -耳机要吗?

- Yes, I will. - $3.00, please.

1262
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:43,410
怎么会这样?
What the hell is this?

1263
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:45,070
有问题吗?
Something the matter?

1264
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,830
是的  我想我拿混了朋友的钱包了
Yes. I think I've mixed up my wallet with my friend's.

但是别担心
But don't worry.

1296
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:34,670
你会拿回礼物的
You'll get your present back.

1297

1299

1304
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:10,630
你是新娘的朋友?
Were you a friend of the bride?

1305
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,500
或是新郎?

1306
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:25,300
-这天气怎么了?  -春天都发生了些什么?

你怎么鼓励?
What do you got?

1309
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,900

Well, I've got the inspirational "You can achieve anything...

1310
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:33,860
你梦想的"
you dream about. "

1311
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:35,980
这太通俗  但没有这句更适合
It's very popular, but not appropriate for this.

1312
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:39,700
当然  这儿还有"别担心  还有更多鱼儿在海里"
Of course, there's the "Don't worry, there's more fish in the sea" pap.

1313
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,410
-不  -嗯  我们能经常...
- No. - Uh, we can always...

1314
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:43,070
引用经典名句...
fall back on the classic...

1315
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:48,580
"当上帝关上一道门  他会开一扇窗"
"When God shuts a door, he opens a window. "

1316
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,790
告诉我做得对怎么样?
How about telling me I did the right thing?

1317
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,170
我不需要讲你
I don't have to tell you.

1318
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:56,250
我写好了
I wrote it.

1319
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:58,340
-这什么?  -这是你的讣文
- What's this? - It's your obituary.

1320
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:01,260
-不错  -真相源自我写不出...
- Nice. - Turns out I had writer's block...

1321
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:04,180
写不出伴郎的讲稿  然后最后就成那样了
penning your best man speech, and that's what ended up coming out.

1322
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:07,060
怪我犯职业病吧
Blame it on the day job.

1323
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,690
-二十元  对吧?  -谢了
- Twenty, right? - Thanks.

1324
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:18,280
-你要去找考特妮?  -当然了
- You going to see Courtney? - Absolutely.

1325
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,360
我需要这个
I needed this.

1326
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:26,920
你知道  希腊人不写讣文
You know, the Greeks didn't write obituaries.

1327
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:31,370
他们只在人死后问一个问题
They only asked one question after a man died:

1328
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:33,620
他曾有过激情吗?
"Did he have passion?"

1329
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,380
我看起来怎么样?
How do I look?

1330
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:45,940
像个大混蛋
Like a jackass.

1331
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:50,270
-好运  兄弟  -谢谢
- Good luck, man. - Thank you.

1332
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:05,120
乔纳森・特雷格
Jonathan Trager,

1333
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,910
ESPN杰出制作人
prominent television producer for ESPN,

1334
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,710
死于昨晚病因来自失去...
died last night from complications of losing...

1335
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:14,260
他的灵魂伴侣和他的未婚妻
his soul mate and his fiance.

1336
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,670
他有35岁说话很轻柔而且令人喜爱
He was 35 years old and soft-spoken and obsessive.

1337
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,800
特雷格看起来绝不像是个爱情盲目的人
Trager never looked the part of a hopeless romantic.

1338
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:26,180
但在他人生的最后几天
But in the final days of his life,

1339
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:29,100
他发现自己不为人知的另一面
he revealed an unknown side of his psyche.

1340
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:32,430
一个隐藏的人格...
This hidden quasi-Jungian persona...

1341
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,610
就在一次侦探式的追踪...
surfaced during the Agatha Christie-like pursuit...

1342
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:37,690
寻找他一直以为的灵魂伴侣
for his long-reputed soul mate,

1343
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:41,650
一个只跟他共度过几小时的女人
a woman whom he only spent a few precious hours with.

1344
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:45,910
可惜  搜寻于周六夜结束...
Sadly, the protracted search ended late Saturday night...

1345
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,910
搜寻结果彻底失败
in complete and utter failure.

1346
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,290
纵使遭受打击
Yet even in certain defeat,

1347
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:54,800
勇敢的特雷格依然坚信...
the courageous Trager secretly clung to the belief...

1348
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,210
人生并非一连串毫无关联...
that life is not merely a series of meaningless...

1349
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,670
意外和巧合
accidents or coincidences.

1350
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,470
而是错综复杂的事件集合...
Uh-uh. But rather it's a tapestry of events...

1351
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:07,310
冥冥中  已被上天细密周详的安排好
that culminate in an exquisite, sublime plan.

1352
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:10,720
叫他失去的好友迪恩  坎斯基
Asked about the loss of his dear friend, Dean Kansky,

1353
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:13,150
普利策奖得主兼主编...
the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and executive editor...

1354
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:14,360
在纽约时报
of the New York Times,

1355
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:18,690
描述乔纳森在最后几天变了个人
described Jonathan as a changed man in the last days of his life.

1356
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:21,870
迪恩说道:他似乎更清醒了
"Things were clearer for him, " Kansky noted.

1357
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,910
最终  乔纳森总结如果我们要在生活中...
Ultimately, Jonathan concluded that if we are to live life...

1358
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:26,540
和谐跟宇宙相处
in harmony with the universe,

1359
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:29,700
我们必须保持坚定的信念...
we must all possess a powerful faith in what the ancients...

1360
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:31,130
相信说的"命"...
used to call "fatum"...

1361
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:35,170
也就是现在所说的缘分
what we currently refer to as destiny.

1362
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:37,250
缘分
Destiny.

1363
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,440
-你打算怎么做?  -我不知道
- So what are you gonna do? - I don't know.

1364
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:52,570
我猜我会试着找到他
I guess I'm just gonna try and find him or something.

1365
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:54,860
我不认为你该再找了  我真的不用
I don't think you should do that. I really don't.

1366
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:56,570
那我现在该做什么?
Well, what do you think I should do?

1367
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:57,190
在这里等
Just be here.

1368
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:58,940
我有预感  我感觉得到周围的气息
I feel it. I feel it in the air.

1369
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:01,030
伊芙  你是怎么了?
Eve, what's happened to you?

1370
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:05,370
你怎么也开始迷信了
You've become your own worst nightmare right there.

1371
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:09,370

Bye.

# I never felt magic crazy as this #

1374
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:29,330
# I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea #

1375
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:34,710
# I never held emotion in the palm of my hand #

1376
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,710
# Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree #

1377
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,350
# But now you're here #

1378
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:46,010

# I've been a long time that I'm blown #

1383
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,670
# I've been a long time that I've wandered #

1384
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,670
# Through the people I have known #

1385
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:19,970
# Oh, if you would and you could #

1386

# Straighten my new mind's eye #

1387
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:38,910
# Would you love me for my money #

1388
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:43,950

我觉得我们每年都回到"犯罪现场"会带来好运
I think it's good luck we return each year to the scene of the crime.
