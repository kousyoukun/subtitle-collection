1
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,922
Merry Christmas.

2
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,157
Excuse me.

3
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,462
- Whoo!
- I'm sorry.

4
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,298
- Sorry.
- Uh...

5
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,675
Do... Do you want these?

6
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,801
- You go ahead.
- No, please.

7
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,802
It's the last one.

8
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,722
Uh, miss, do you have another pair
of these black cashmere gloves?

9
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,390
Whatever's out is what we have.

10
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,516
You don't have a stockroom?

11
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,851
- No.
- Or a basement?

12
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,644
No. We don't have an attic, either.

13
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,190
Um, listen, you take 'em.
I don't need 'em.

14
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,192
No, no, no.
You saw them first. I...

15
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,568
Please. I insist.

16
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,819
I mean, here. Take 'em.

17
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,071
- Oh, oh!
Hey, wait a minute.

18
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,239
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey!

19
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,407
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah?

20
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,367
- These are ours.
- Oh. Your gloves?

21
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,452
- Yes.
- Well, how come? I mean...

22
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,622
They're just sort of hanging there,
sleeping with their little price tag on.

23
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,498
We were just discussing them, all right?
This is, uh...

24
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,167
Well, I have news for you.

25
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,836
You can go on discussing them
long after I've paid for them.

26
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,129
Calm down, all right?
Just calm down.

27
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,881
Calm down?
It's five days before Christmas.

28
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,382
I'm in the middle of a New York
department store.

29
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,550
He's asking me to calm down.

30
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,637
Well, listen. These were meant to be
a very special gift for someone.

31
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,180
Yeah, we've put quite a lot
of thought into those.

32
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,389
- Ah.
- Isn't that right?

33
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,099
Who are you?
And who were they for?

34
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,184
- My boyfriend.
- My girlfriend.

35
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,228
- Her boyfriend.
- His girlfriend.

36
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,854
- His girlfriend.
- Her boyfriend.

37
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,731
One pair of gloves for two people?

38
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,524
- This is hard to explain.
- Well, try.

39
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,109
All right. Go ahead.

40
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,907
Oh. Uh, well, he is at the present time
my boyfriend.

41
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,576
But in 18 months...

42
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,246
after the operation...

43
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,167
- he will be...
- she will be...

44
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,003
...my girlfriend.
Do you understand?

45
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,880
That didn't really work out.

46
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,341
- No, but Merry Christmas anyway.
- Thank you very much.

47
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,259
All right.

48
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,221
Well, you earned these.
That was quick on your feet.

49
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,474
- Thanks. It was a team effort.
- Yeah, it was. It was.

50
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,352
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Well...

51
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,853
Ah, well.

52
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,192
They're ready for you guys.

53
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,360
Thank you.

54
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,238
I don't know if what you said to that guy
makes any sense.

55
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,240
It was helpful. I think we scared
the bejesus out of him.

56
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,283
Oh, you were pretty fierce.

57
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,952
This will work, though.
This is quite a coffee.

58
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,745
No, but I'm serious about the check.

59
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,746
It's the least I can do.

60
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,416
Well, thank you, but, see,

61
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,711
now I have to go find something else
for my girlfriend.

62
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,130
- Oh, they were for your girlfriend.
- Yes, they were.

63
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,257
Oh, I can't accept them then.

64
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,425
Well, you have to.
Otherwise you won't treat.

65
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,676
Really.

66
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,262
Let me tell you something.
This is the ultimate blended drink.

67
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,888
Where did you find this place?

68
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,473
I first came in because of the name.

69
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,725
- Hmm.
- Serendipity.

70
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,435
- It's one of my favorite words.
- It is?

71
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,728
- Uh-huh.
- Why?

72
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,730
'Cause it's such a nice sound
for what it means:

73
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,315
A fortunate accident.

74
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,650
- Mm.
- Except I don't really believe in accidents.

75
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,402
I think fate's behind everything.

76
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,320
Oh, you do?

77
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,155
- Yeah.
- Fate's behind everything?

78
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,698
Well, I think so.

79
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,700
Everything's predestined?
We don't have any choice at all?

80
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,618
No, I think we make our own decisions.

81
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,079
I just think that fate sends us
little signs,

82
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,164
and it's how we read the signs

83
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,582
that determines whether
we're happy or not.

84
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,000
Little signals.

85
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,376
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

86
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,670
Fortunate accidents.
Lucky discoveries.

87
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,172
Like Columbus and America.

88
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,758
Yeah, or Fleming discovering...

89
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,134
...penicillin.
- Penicillin. Yeah.

90
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,094
- Fleming is his name?
- Yes.

91
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,429
Or "Jonathan and the Gloves."

92
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,765
I don't know that one.

93
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,184
You don't know that story?
It's an old folk tale. Classic.

94
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,187
Our hero, Jonathan, goes out
in search of black gloves.

95
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,148
And in a perfect act of
serendipiocity

96
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,691
or serendipaciousness,

97
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,362
he runs into a beautiful,
attractive English girl

98
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,404
with a boyfriend.

99
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,531
You have a boyfriend, right?

100
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,867
- Yeah, I do.
- That's what I thought.

101
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,410
And you have the glove lady.

102
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,787
Yes, I do.

103
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,208
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a very nice time.

104
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,089
Well, I hope you enjoy the gloves
you bought yourself.

105
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,298
Oh, I'm sure I will.

106
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,342
I usually appreciate
my own thoughtfulness.

107
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,511
What do you want for Christmas?

108
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,429
- Golf clubs.
- Oh.

109
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,723
So you're gonna meet
your boyfriend now or what?

110
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,351
No, I think he's probably out
doing what you're doing.

111
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,478
Getting a crush on
someone else's girlfriend?

112
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,564
No, I'm sorry. I just meant to say
that I had a really great time, and...

113
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,359
Um... you know, maybe you should
give me your phone number,

114
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,402
you know, just in case.

115
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,113
- In case of what?
- You know, in case of life.

116
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,074
I just had a great time,
and I'd never be able to find you again.

117
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,743
Well, if we're meant
to meet again, then...

118
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,786
we'll meet again.

119
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,454
It's just not the right time now.

120
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,081
Maybe we were supposed
to meet on British time

121
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,040
and we're five hours too early.

122
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,210
Come on.
I don't even know your name.

123
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,837
My name is Jonathan.

124
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,880
Does that make you
wanna tell me something?

125
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,757
Yeah, it does.

126
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,303
Merry Christmas, Jonathan.
And thanks.

127
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,687
That's it?!

128
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,110
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.

129
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,486
I'm sorry about that.

130
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,797
I think I left a scarf.

131
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,091
No. Nothing down here.
Why don't you go upstairs?

132
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,634
- Maybe it's still there.
- Thank you.

133
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,332
Hey.

134
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,924
Let's go do something.

135
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,760
All right.
What you wanna do?

136
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,637
I don't care.

137
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,972
All right. Come on.

138
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,694
Now, promise me you're not just
visiting here for a week

139
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,113
or marrying somebody
to get a green card or...

140
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,949
on parole.

141
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,285
None of the above. You?

142
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,871
No, no, no. Proud U.S. Citizen.
No criminal record.

143
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,749
So you won't tell me your name.
Well, tell me, uh...

144
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,335
what do you miss most
about Mother England?

145
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,586
I miss my mom terribly.

146
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,464
If I were her,
I'd miss you too.

147
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,100
Okay. Favorite movie.

148
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,228
The correct answer is
Cool Hand Luke.

149
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,563
I've never seen it.

150
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,565
Oh, come on.
You've never seen Cool Hand Luke?

151
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,694
Paul Newman?
Oh, my God. Come on!

152
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,281
"Failure to communicate,"
sadistic cop in sunglasses with no name.

153
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,907
Reminds me of you in that way.

154
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,035
Um, favorite New York moment.

155
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,000
This one's climbing the charts.

156
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,335
I'm flattered.

157
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,381
Is there anything else you need
to know about me?

158
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,466
Huh.

159
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,137
Favorite sexual position?

160
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,848
Oh!

161
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,766
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

162
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,603
Yeah, yeah.
That's my favorite too.

163
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,396
- You all right?
- Yeah.

164
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,814
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No.

165
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,690
- Yes, a little.
- You did?

166
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,358
- Ouch.
- Oh, let's take a look at that.

167
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,777
Oh, Jesus. Wow.

168
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,988
- That's a deep, deep gash.
- Gaping.

169
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,573
What?

170
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,117
Well, we'll fix that right up.

171
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:21,995
There you go.

172
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,166
What?

173
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,877
Oh, you're looking at my freckles?

174
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,296
It's the curse of the English, I'm afraid.

175
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,923
- Fair skin and bad teeth.
- No, you have great teeth.

176
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,843
Those aren't just freckles.

177
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,512
If you look closely,
you can see Cassiopeia.

178
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,432
- What?
- Right there.

179
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,643
Hold on a minute.

180
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,271
Okay.

181
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,149
All right.
Here's the story:

182
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,069
A long time ago in Ethiopia,

183
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,571
there was this queen
named Cassiopeia,

184
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,617
who thought she was the most
beautiful woman in the entire world,

185
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,161
and there wasn't anybody in the kingdom
who wasn't offended

186
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,538
by this woman's relentless vanity.

187
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,416
And then one day, she really
screwed up and offended the gods.

188
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,334
I don't remember what she did

189
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,418
and I don't remember
who she offended.

190
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,295
But it was bad.
She crossed the line.

191
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,839
But anyway,
Poseidon, the sea god,

192
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,259
punished Cassiopeia
by placing her in the heavens

193
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,803
upside down in her throne,

194
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,681
stuck for eternity with her skirt
around her shoulders,

195
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,224
and all the blood rushing to her head.

196
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,686
And now she's just
a constellation in the sky,

197
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,648
a bunch of English freckles
in the shape of a throne.

198
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,819
So she made one tragic mistake.

199
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,656
And paid for eternity.

200
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,282
Correct.

201
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,679
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Legible, legible.

202
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,764
I can't believe I'm doing this.

203
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,183
Now, please, please.
Let fate take its proper course.

204
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,358
Oh! Oh!

205
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,240
That was an accident.
Write down that again, please.

206
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,617
I can't.
That was a sign.

207
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,453
Fate's telling us to back off.

208
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,830
If fate didn't want us to be together,

209
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,291
then why did we meet tonight, huh?
Gotcha.

210
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,419
Well, I don't know, but it's not
an exact science. It's a feeling.

211
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,545
Well, what if you're wrong, huh?

212
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,422
What if it's all in our hands
and we just walk away?

213
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,923
No names, no phone numbers,
nothing.

214
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,300
What do you think's gonna happen?

215
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,177
Do you think good old fate
is just gonna deliver my information

216
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,178
right to your doorstep?

217
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,305
Do you know that's the best idea
you've had all night?

218
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,183
- What's the best...
- Here you go.

219
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,768
Write your name and number down.

220
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,936
- On a $5.00 bill?
- Mm. Just do it.

221
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,859
You are a strange
and interesting woman.

222
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,529
Now what?

223
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,782
Wait there.

224
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,337
Hey!

225
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,924
What the hell was that?

226
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,552
When that $5.00 bill makes its way
back into my hands,

227
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,762
I'll be able to call you.

228
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,056
And when you hear my voice
on the other end,

229
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,766
then you'll believe in fate,
won't you?

230
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,771
Hey, what about me?

231
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:35,980
What do you mean?

232
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,398
Well, we have to send something
out in the universe

233
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,525
with your name on it, don't we?

234
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,734
Come on.
Isn't that the only fair thing?

235
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,069
That is the only fair thing.

236
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,446
What have I got, even?
Ooh.

237
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,823
No. I have a really good idea.

238
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,032
- What?
- Okay.

239
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,369
That's a lot of tuba.

240
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,037
- Okay, see this book?
- Yeah.

241
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,373
Okay, so when I get home tonight,

242
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,458
I'm gonna write my name and number
inside this book.

243
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,795
And then first thing tomorrow morning,
I'll sell it to a used-book store.

244
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,130
Which one?
You're not gonna tell me.

245
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,090
You're not gonna tell me.
Why not?

246
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,133
Well, now, every time you go past
an old bookstore,

247
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,802
you're gonna have to go inside
to see if it's there.

248
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,388
This is just wrong.

249
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,431
You don't just have the most
incredible night of your life

250
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,474
with a perfect stranger

251
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,059
and then leave it all
to chance, do ya?

252
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,769
Do ya?

253
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,647
Come with me a second.

254
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,482
What, are we gonna get a room?

255
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,443
I'm kidding.
But I wanna know you more.

256
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,071
Come on. Where are we going?

257
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,865
- Okay. Now, you stay here.
- Okay.

258
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,409
No, stay here. Stay there.

259
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,077
Don't make me come over there.

260
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,287
- Okay.
- Okay.

261
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,998
Right, if we both randomly
pick the same floor,

262
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,957
we're meant to be together now.

263
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,208
You're insane.

264
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,586
Come on.

265
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,462
Okay, get in...

266
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,131
take a breath,

267
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,465
and then when the door closes,
hit a button.

268
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,842
I don't understand this.

269
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,219
You don't have to understand.
You just have to have faith.

270
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,262
Faith in what?

271
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,973
Destiny.

272
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,683
Oh. Here.

273
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,936
Hey!

274
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,314
It's Sara.

275
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,524
My name's Sara.

276
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,184
And here it is.
See? You were right.

277
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,395
- Uh...
- Let's go, buddy.

278
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,148
- We're going up here.
- Oh, that's okay.

279
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,232
Josh likes to ride either way.

280
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,568
Don't you, Josh?

281
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,779
Don't do that!
Don't touch those!

282
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,365
Hey, calm down.
He's just a kid.

283
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,589
Looks like we've stopped.

284
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,857
- Oh. We're going again.
- Thank you.

285
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,944
Where is she? Is she here?

286
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,946
No, no. I don't think so.

287
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,572
Come on, Josh.
Let's go, buddy.

288
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,289
Okay, stay alert.

289
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,793
- Is she here?
- No, not here.

290
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,169
- Back in the elevator.
- She's not here?

291
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,714
Come on! Come on! Move it!
Come on, boy!

292
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,223
Hey, Sara.
Oh, I'm sorry.

293
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,893
- Hey. I'm sorry.
- What?

294
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,064
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,991
Usually, I have to beg
to be a part of weddings.

296
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,159
And if I do get into the wedding,

297
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,246
of course, they've postponed it
and it's overseas somewhere,

298
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,832
and they've canceled my passport
and I can't be a part of it,

299
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,416
and it's ridiculous and all for naught.

300
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,961
Well, thank you.
I take this very seriously.

301
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,921
It's a gift to be the best man.

302
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,299
They say that once in your lifetime,

303
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,386
someone comes along whom
you're absolutely meant to be with.

304
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,139
Everything feels great,
stars are aligned,

305
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,141
body and spirit are in balance.

306
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,810
For my friend Jonathan Trager,

307
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,103
that person...

308
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,104
was me.

309
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,817
But as you know,
Jonny and I were simpatico.

310
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,235
We were brothers
from another mother.

311
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,529
We were friends since freshman year.

312
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,698
I watched him go out
with woman after woman,

313
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,159
and he'd always come crawling...

314
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,119
He would come crawling back to me.

315
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,037
It was embarrassing.

316
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,205
You loved it.

317
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,292
But then one night he came home
and things were different.

318
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,627
His adolescent dream of becoming
a documentary filmmaker

319
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,503
was a thing of the past.

320
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,713
Thank God.

321
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,384
He hardly even responded to my playful
yet tormenting flicks of my finger

322
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,677
against the soft part of his skull

323
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,345
as he studied for finals.

324
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,433
And that is because
he had found her:

325
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,310
The woman
he was meant to be with.

326
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,813
And if anyone is qualified to know
when he met his soul mate,

327
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,856
it would be me,

328
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,274
his first wife.

329
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,488
She's smart, she's funny,
she's beautiful.

330
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,241
In short, she's the kind of woman
that any man would dream about.

331
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,409
And I think we all have.

332
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,953
So it is with sadness

333
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,915
and fond, fond memories,

334
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,374
that I raise my glass

335
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,752
to the new Mrs. Jonathan Trager.

336
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,794
- Aww.
- Hear, hear.

337
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,046
I'll tell you what.

338
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,090
I'll tell you something, my friends,
if I had to lose Jonny to anyone,

339
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,844
I can't imagine a more perfect
woman than Halley.

340
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,762
To Halley.

341
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,096
Cheers to both of you.

342
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,605
How drunk is he
on a scale of one to ten?

343
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,606
Twelve.

344
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,359
You think we'll ever out-romance
Dean and Courtney?

345
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,110
I don't know. I don't think
I've ever seen them fight.

346
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,028
Me neither.

347
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,613
Must be a bitch on their sex life.

348
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,991
We... We have a pomegranate souffle,
which is amazing,

349
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,493
which is different than the sorbet.

350
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,414
Listen, we'd love to join you guys,
but Courtney has to wake up,

351
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,792
so I got to be good.

352
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,961
Halley, listen to me.
It's not too late to back out.

353
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,963
- And I'm up... I'm up 116...
- Good night, Dean.

354
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,010
Mama, you don't want to see this,
but I need... I need to snuggle.

355
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,429
I'm gonna sleep it off.
Listen, you're wonderful.

356
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,348
- Good night.
- You know what? You need me.

357
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,016
Take care. Come on, hon.

358
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,770
You guys, listen, I hate to tell you,
but I gotta go home too.

359
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,063
- I have to.
- Come in for one drink.

360
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,690
I gotta get up at 8:00 in the morning.
My day is crazy tomorrow.

361
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,857
- Come in for one drink.
- He doesn't want to come.

362
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,318
- He doesn't have to come.
- I'll see you in about 20 hours.

363
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,611
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Good night.

364
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,779
- I love you, son.
- Night-night.

365
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,989
- George.
- Take care.

366
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,198
- Good night.
- Take care.

367
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,033
You okay?

368
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,079
- You better be up later.
- Yeah, why?

369
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,872
- Because I'm gonna come home and...
- Uh-huh.

370
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,374
Get undressed...

371
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,126
...climb into bed...
- Uh-huh.

372
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,712
Act like we just got over a terrible fight.

373
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,799
Cab!

374
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,261
See you later now.

375
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,071
Buy a book.

376
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,949
Reading is good for you.
Knowledge.

377
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,788
Read it?

378
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,969
Hold on, hold on.
Listen, listen.

379
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,095
I read it.
I read it a long time ago.

380
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,306
I'll throw in the screenplay
to the Bridges of Madison County.

381
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,558
- I saw the movie. It was great.
- I know you like that.

382
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:46,947
Okay, and...

383
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,909
And nothing. I mean...

384
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:53,120
I mean, I did nothing.
I... I just let her walk out of the party

385
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,622
and I didn't say anything to her.

386
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,333
And now she's gone forever.

387
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,212
I mean, she was my soul mate.

388
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,549
Kenny, I honestly think it's dangerous
to use the term "soul mate."

389
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,387
It implies there's some magical element
that we have no control over,

390
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,055
like fate or destiny.

391
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,309
I think holding onto beliefs like that
stops us doing the real work.

392
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,521
And the fact is,
if your therapy here stays on track,

393
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,356
I think you'll find there are
many, many people out there

394
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,774
you could easily be happy with.

395
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,651
You truly believe all that, Sara?

396
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,905
Yeah.
I really do.

397
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,577
- There you go.
- Thanks.

398
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,096
You got to say yes first.

399
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,276
Yes.

400
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,168
Wait a second.

401
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,336
Ow.

402
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,213
- Let me...
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

403
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,130
- Ow, ow, ow.
- I got it.

404
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,173
- I got it.
- Ow.

405
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,174
Ow!

406
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,970
Okay, you're not gonna
read into this, right, Sara?

407
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,930
I mean, it's just an accident,
nothing more.

408
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,516
No. God, we'll get it refitted.

409
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,644
It's beautiful. I love it.

410
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,021
You... You get changed.
I wanna call Ryan,

411
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,147
tell him you said yes.

412
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,440
Why? Was he worried?

413
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,650
Not about you.

414
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,901
About the tour.

415
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,195
He's hoping to fit the honeymoon
into the schedule.

416
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,448
How's Bora Bora sound?

417
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,411
Very... sexy sexy?

418
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,888
Now, if you're a golfer
on a one-hour lunch break,

419
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,098
you'd use that time up

420
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,309
just getting to the nearest course
out of Manhattan.

421
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,228
All this was a long overdue solution.

422
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,690
Formerly a dilapidated pier
and converted just five years ago,

423
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,568
the range offers the inhabitants
of this concrete jungle

424
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,986
the chance to keep
their drives straight,

425
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,821
their short games accurate,

426
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,241
and most of all, brings the joys
and frustrations of golf

427
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,367
back to city folk.

428
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,872
This is Nick Roberts,
ESPN News, New York City.

429
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,874
Superb, Nick.
We got it. Thank you.

430
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,044
- Artie, gotta run, okay?
- What about the B-roll shot?

431
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,837
- Paging Sara Lawson.
- No time. Totally jammed with the wedding.

432
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,839
Paging Sara Lawson.
Please come to the front desk.

433
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,257
You come back,
get the B-roll on Friday?

434
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,967
- Yeah. Whatever you say, boss.
- Thank you, sir.

435
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,219
I'm Sara Lawson. Hi.

436
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,888
- How are you?
- Sorry I'm late.

437
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,389
You're down at position number two.

438
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,099
Oh, right. Bad golfers
all the way down there, right?

439
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,851
Dude, take off. We got it.

440
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,779
Well, hello,
Mr. Marrying Man.

441
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,491
- Hi. Uh, where's Lauren?
- Oh, Lauren took the day off.

442
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,826
My name is Sara
and I'm gonna cut your hair today.

443
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,579
You know what?

444
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,790
I'm not thrilled with having
that "just cut hair" look

445
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,792
- for my own wedding, so...
- I'm just gonna take a little bit off.

446
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,251
I gotta live with these pictures
the rest of my life.

447
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,461
- Just a little bit.
- Please, you know, uh...

448
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,602
Forget Charles Street.

449
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,313
Take me to the New York Times building
on 42nd, please.

450
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,195
I'm telling you,
I keep running into it.

451
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,780
I keep finding it.
It keeps happening.

452
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,198
She was at the golf range.

453
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,075
She's a big girl now with big hips.
All right?

454
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,203
Then I gotta leave
'cause Sara's gonna cut my hair,

455
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,664
and the guy in the taxi,
he's serenading me, Sara.

456
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,166
I'm telling you, the universe
keeps revealing her to me,

457
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,584
screwing with my head.

458
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,920
- You're getting married in three days.
- That's my point.

459
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,339
It's entirely duplicitous.
Think about it.

460
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,008
Why would you risk
your relationship with Halley

461
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,969
just to search for some pipe dream?

462
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,262
Just hear me out, man.

463
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,640
I'm sure that I love Halley, all right?

464
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,475
And maybe every time
you fall in love with somebody,

465
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:52,062
it's a completely different experience,
so it's a mistake to compare them.

466
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,188
- I get it, but...
- Right.

467
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,691
All right...

468
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,570
It's like Halley is
The Godfather, Part II.

469
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,697
She's what?

470
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,324
Godfather, Part II.
That was an incredible movie.

471
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,535
Might be better than the original.
All right?

472
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,454
But no matter how much you love
The Godfather, Part II,

473
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,122
you still have to see the original

474
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,167
to understand and appreciate
the sequel, don't ya?

475
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,836
Come on. Is it too much to ask
of my oldest friend to help me out?

476
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,379
You already got
the fairy-tale marriage.

477
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,173
I'm the best man.

478
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,716
You work in the biggest
newspaper in the world.

479
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,717
- Now, why don't you help me find her?
- Let me tell you something:

480
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,053
Contrary to popular New York myth,
the Times is not omniscient.

481
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,556
I need a last name.
I need a social security number.

482
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,309
- If we find the book...
- It-It's a dead end. You know that.

483
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,727
Unless we search every bookstore
in New York.

484
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,228
You did that. Years ago.

485
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,147
- Do you remember?
- Maybe I missed a store.

486
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,732
Maybe somebody bought it
and sold it back.

487
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,776
Here's the deal. You know what?
I don't want any part of this.

488
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,028
All right?

489
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,337
Maybe I am just getting cold feet.

490
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,839
I'm telling you right now,
British women do not age well.

491
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,343
You know, I mean, years ago, yes,
she was a luscious treat.

492
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,845
You know, she probably looked like,
you know, Baby Spice.

493
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,555
But now she could look like...

494
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,142
Old Spice.

495
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:29,451
- It's a great haircut.
- Oh. Thanks.

496
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,788
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.

497
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,916
- Tell me something romantic.
- Like what?

498
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,377
I don't know. Like...

499
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,756
how I'm the only girl in the entire universe
meant for you.

500
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,846
Oh, my God, the dinner!

501
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,808
By the way, I emptied your closet.

502
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,476
We gotta pack for the honeymoon.

503
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,812
God, I hate this building.

504
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,106
Shut up!

505
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,983
Don't hit it with the thing.

506
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,944
- Jon!
- What?

507
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,530
I'm gonna go yell at the super.

508
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,379
I don't understand
why this is going off.

509
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,256
You said last week it would be fine.

510
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,799
- Hey, Jon.
- Hey.

511
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,344
Jesus, this place looks like
a disaster area.

512
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,180
- Thanks, Gerald.
- Gerald, it's in here.

513
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,557
I gotta get going. Coming!

514
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,360
Come on! I wanna see!
I wanna see! I wanna see...

515
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,238
I thought you wanted
a round-cut diamond.

516
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,656
Why? When did I say that?

517
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,742
I'm not exactly sure. But, I mean,
when we were younger, I think.

518
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:19,204
Oh, God. When I was younger,
I was gonna marry Boris Becker, wasn't I?

519
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,415
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

520
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,041
- What did you think?
- Well, I mean...

521
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,711
Was that last song
really inspired by my sister?

522
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,671
Every artist needs his muse.

523
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,424
- Who wants to hear the good news?
- Hey, I pay you for the good news.

524
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,426
No. You pay me to keep away
the bad news.

525
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,094
Bring it on.

526
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,097
Lars' dates in Stockholm sold out
in eight hours.

527
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,807
Wow!

528
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,475
That means we're gonna have to
add some more shows.

529
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,019
So we'll bump Paris
and then we'll...

530
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:45,105
Sorry. Um, I don't wanna
spoil anyone's party,

531
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,315
but Lars and I have already set the dates
for our honeymoon and our wedding,

532
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,985
and I've told my patients
when I'm going.

533
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,321
Well, baby, your patients can do
without you for a couple weeks.

534
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,406
He's right, Sara. I mean,

535
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,783
a couple of extra weeks in Europe
aren't gonna kill you.

536
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,910
Caroline's just pushing you
to stay longer

537
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,580
'cause she wants us
to house-sit for you guys.

538
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,624
Yeah, thank you. I was going to ask her
when she was drunk.

539
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,210
- Actually, that's a great idea.
- Yeah?

540
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:11,965
Yes! Come on, Kip. Let's get out of here
before Sara changes Lars' mind.

541
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,136
- I said something wrong?
- No, it's...

542
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,223
I've just got a very detailed schedule,
and my patients are important too.

543
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,142
I don't like changing the dates
at the last minute.

544
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,018
You know what I mean?

545
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,019
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

546
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,272
But I really need you to approve
these T-shirt designs for Australia.

547
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,899
- Oh, no problem.
- You don't mind, do you?

548
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,692
- Can we do this later?
- Yeah.

549
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,152
She don't mind.

550
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,409
That's chamomile for you ladies.
Nice and hot.

551
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,577
- Very good.
- But, Eve...

552
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,122
Sara, it was a movie poster.
It's no big deal.

553
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,082
It's peculiar though, right?
Don't you think?

554
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,501
Look, I thought you were through
with all this New Age bullshit

555
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,587
like horoscopes and feng shui
and all that crap.

556
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,925
Eve, for someone who owns a New Age store,
you are alarmingly earthbound.

557
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,760
Oh, yeah?
And for a shrink-in-training,

558
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,929
you are a little bit crazy.
I'll tell you that much.

559
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,182
Excuse me.
Do you carry the Casanova candle?

560
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,892
Yes. As a matter of fact, we do.

561
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:50,438
You know what? Check on the shelf
across from the Caligula incense.

562
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,649
And they're on sale,
so today's your lucky day.

563
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,902
Great. You see, that is what happens

564
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,696
when people get hooked
on the New Age life.

565
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,407
They end up sitting at home
burning candles for Mr. Right,

566
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,286
when Mr. Good Enough For Right Now
is waiting at the corner bar.

567
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,205
Hi. Oh, yeah.

568
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,874
She's a pain in the ass.

569
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,173
- And I gotta find her.
- I've been here three years.

570
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,174
- So this is...
- Yeah, I understand.

571
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,718
But your computer... your computer system
has been here for a long time.

572
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,928
I think... I think you're just
wasting my time, sir.

573
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,555
- No, no. Here's the thing.
- There's nothing I can do.

574
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,015
- It's very crucial.
- You cannot be over here.

575
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,642
You cannot come over
to this side of the counter.

576
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,311
- Please don't cross this line.
- I understand.

577
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,520
- Thank you.
- We're off to a bad start here.

578
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,147
All I really need, if you could, is just

579
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,191
if you could enter this account number
in the computer

580
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,317
and just tell me her name.

581
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,611
Oh, I see.
When you put it that way...

582
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,695
No.

583
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,821
All right.

584
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,615
Would 20 bucks help?

585
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,825
It might if I was a health inspector.

586
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,827
Listen, this is really important.

587
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,621
Oh, boy, did it again.
Crossed the line.

588
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:50,165
You have to remain on the other side
of the register.

589
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,418
I don't wanna say it again.
Remain on that side. Thank you.

590
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,129
Let's bottom-line this, huh?
What's it gonna take?

591
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,255
I have to have the name.

592
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:02,761
Well, I was a little short
on my weekly sales draw.

593
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,262
- Were you?
- I'm just mentioning.

594
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,016
Okay. Um, I'm going to, uh...

595
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,730
- Uh-uh.
- Look where my feet are. All right?

596
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,695
- A lovely choice, sir.
- Thank you.

597
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,408
The account number was 029351...

598
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,745
I thought you said you were gonna
help with my weekly draw.

599
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,915
The tie's worth $95.
We're still 700 short.

600
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,208
$700?

601
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,292
- 700.
- That's extortion.

602
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,753
That's good salesmanship, sir.

603
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,173
What do I need?
Ring it up.

604
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,884
- Well, we have a purple tie.
- Mm-hmm.

605
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,761
What would go with a purple tie?

606
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,097
I look like a magician.

607
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,849
All right, you horrible little man.

608
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,769
I bought the entire spring line.
Okay, you happy?

609
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,020
Now, look her up.

610
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,563
I already did.

611
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:59,067
It was a dead account.
There's no information in our computers.

612
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,402
- You give me that!
- Hey, chase me.

613
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,904
- Chase you? What? Are you insane?
- Don't cross the line!

614
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,408
- You crossed the line!
- Stop saying that or I will cut you!

615
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,076
Now, you better find a way
to help me right now!

616
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,996
- I can suggest another option.
- Suggest it fast.

617
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,831
When our customers
apply for a credit card,

618
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,333
the hard copies go to
our storage facility in Queens.

619
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:19,170
All you need is the account number,
which you already have,

620
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,505
and you can find her application.

621
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,425
However, you need an employee
to get you in.

622
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,511
You need an employee...

623
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,221
to get you in.

624
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,936
Crocodile.

625
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,037
Hal.

626
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,125
Halley.

627
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,089
Ah.

628
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,257
A natural.

629
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,426
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Really natural.

630
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,394
- No, no, no. Cut, cut, cut.
- What's the problem?

631
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,187
The problem is you can't fend off

632
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,023
an army of bloodthirsty
Vikings with a shehnai.

633
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,025
- It's illogical.
- No, see... no, no.

634
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,986
See, you're lulling them into submission
with the music.

635
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:10,490
That's the whole point of the song, really.
Mystic Surrender.

636
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,994
You don't think he looks like
he hates the music?

637
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:18,373
No. Hey.

638
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,461
Hey, baby.

639
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,423
Now, this guy, he's-he's like
Alec Guinness. So good.

640
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,175
Star Wars.
Obi-wan.

641
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,555
All right, right here, what are they doing?
What's their attitude?

642
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,265
What are they thinking?
Who are these people?

643
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,475
I tell you, they're in awe
and they're speechless.

644
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,145
And they're just grateful
and underfed.

645
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,271
Underpaid.

646
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,441
Why don't they ask me
to stay in the village and have a feast?

647
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,402
- Yeah. Sara, hey.
- Hey.

648
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,904
- Can we talk for a sec?
- Sure.

649
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,906
Okay, yeah, I'm going to split, guys.

650
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,242
Lars, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna talk to the director,

651
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,412
and I'm gonna have him tweak
that whole section.

652
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,457
- It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
- Tell him about the feast.

653
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:06,254
- What's going on?
- I lost my keys yesterday.

654
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,630
Oh, that's a drag.

655
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,966
And I've just found them in the freezer.

656
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,343
I don't get it. Is that a joke?

657
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:16,681
No, Lars, it's not a joke.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

658
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,852
It's the wedding plans
and the tour and my patients.

659
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,437
It's just a bit too much to deal with.

660
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,608
Okay, Sara, look. We're leaving
for Toronto in the morning...

661
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,943
...so don't fall apart on me now.
- I know, I know, I know, I know.

662
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,571
And that's why I think I need a little break.

663
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,073
What do you mean, a little break?

664
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,867
No, not that kind of little break.

665
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,954
I just mean a weekend away
to recharge my batteries and clear my head.

666
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,374
Hey, this has nothing to do
with the other night.

667
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,961
I just need this.
I need it for me.

668
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,297
But I won't go unless you say it's okay.

669
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,760
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

670
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:57,680
Okay. Where are you going?
Where are you going?

671
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,935
Oh, I don't know.
New York, maybe.

672
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,193
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, my God.

673
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,323
Are you serious?
Get out of town.

674
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,075
Yeah, that's the idea.

675
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,494
- Thanks. Talk to you soon.
- Okay.

676
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,205
This is unbelievable. Oh, my God.

677
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,749
Sara, really, this is
way too generous of you.

678
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:28,378
Oh, come on. Can't a girl do something nice
for her friend on her birthday?

679
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,380
And there's no ulterior motives?

680
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,092
Well, yeah.

681
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,510
I'm getting married in a week

682
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,929
and I'd just like to have one last fling
with my best friend

683
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,222
before I walk down the aisle.

684
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,224
It's so sweet. But, you know,
you're really not my type.

685
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,767
Oh, thanks.

686
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,187
- We're going to New York?
- Yeah. Yay!

687
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,483
Hey! Excuse me.

688
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,902
- Why so tense?
- Because you're freaking me out, all right?

689
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,822
- Is there another space you can be in?
- Oh. Excusez-moi.

690
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,408
- Uh-huh.
- And what is it you do?

691
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,578
Well, my sales clerk friend,
I happen to write for a little publication.

692
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,497
Maybe you've heard of it.
It's called the New York Times.

693
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,540
- Oh.
- Yeah.

694
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,594
Hello. Who?

695
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,514
Dean?
And who may I say is calling?

696
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,684
Uh-huh? Hang on.
Your editor.

697
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,604
Hi. No.

698
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,940
Didn't get... Didn't get a chance
to write that one. Uh...

699
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,777
Didn't... Didn't write that one either.

700
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,447
Uh, with all due respect, sir,
they'll all still be dead tomorrow.

701
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,242
Okay. Thank you.
Bye-bye.

702
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,955
- You write for the obituaries.
- Absolutely. Yeah.

703
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,541
- Hmm. You must be very proud.
- Uh-huh. I'm the one with the last word.

704
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:31,668
- Not tonight.
- Yes, I am.

705
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,835
- I don't think so.
- Absolutely.

706
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,045
- Fat chance.
- Still talking.

707
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,505
- Last line.
- Yeah, right here.

708
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,802
I don't know. I don't know.
My eyes are killing me.

709
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,470
My eyes are killing me.
Tell me these numbers match.

710
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,554
Here, I'll tell you.

711
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:44,972
- Let me see.
- Don't do that.

712
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,684
- Ah-ah!
- Is it 0293?

713
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,728
- 0293. Congratulations.
- You got it?

714
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,146
- I think you found her.
- No way.

715
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,774
Too bad the last name's
completely smudged out, though.

716
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,153
Well, it's his fault.
It was his thumb.

717
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,614
When he grabbed it,
his thumb went right across the...

718
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,657
right across the name.

719
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,826
Completely. I'm kidding.
It was smudged in my hand.

720
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,952
- Would you stop it?
- It's just a little joke.

721
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,412
That's carbon paper for you.

722
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,831
I guess that's why America rejected it.

723
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,083
What's that address?
Is that her address?

724
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,751
That's seven years ago, man.

725
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,586
So go to the building leasing office

726
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,672
and you'll find out who lived there
seven years ago.

727
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,840
It ain't rocket science.

728
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,676
Thank you.

729
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,642
The white zone
is for the immediate loading

730
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,520
and unloading of passengers only.
No parking.

731
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,439
- Hi.
- Hey.

732
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,691
- Where to?
- Yeah, where are we going?

733
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,944
Uh, okay, take us...

734
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,029
...anywhere in New York.
- Excuse me?

735
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,115
Anywhere.
Wherever you feel like going.

736
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,617
- That's not a destination, lady.
- Wait. You didn't make reservations?

737
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,204
- Um, okay, Eve, please don't get mad at me.
- What?

738
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,915
Oh, no. I cannot believe this.

739
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,333
I need a borough here, ladies.

740
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,711
Look, I was gonna tell you
when we got on the plane.

741
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,005
You know what?
That's really sneaky of you, Sara.

742
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:03,551
- I'm not a bloody psychic.
- Eve, wait! Wait!

743
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,052
Hold on one second.

744
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:08,014
- Eve. Eve!
- You tricked me.

745
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,348
I knew you wouldn't come
if I told you the truth.

746
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,975
And I needed my best friend with me.

747
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,560
What are you doing, Sara?

748
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,689
Honestly, Sara, I don't understand
you anymore, okay?

749
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,151
Please, tell me something.
Tell me anything that makes

750
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,736
just a little bit of sense.

751
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:29,994
I've just spent the entire flight
staring into the sky, thinking.

752
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:34,165
Not about my fiancé,
but about this mystery guy I met

753
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,292
a million and a half hours ago.

754
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,921
A guy I don't even remember,
except for this...

755
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,840
vague picture I have inside my head.

756
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,512
It was just a few seconds.
A fragment, really.

757
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:50,181
And it was like...

758
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:55,937
in that moment, the whole universe existed
just to bring us together.

759
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,774
That's why I'm here.

760
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,694
That's why I'm gonna let fate
take me wherever it wants to go.

761
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,196
Because when all this is over,

762
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,491
at least I'm never gonna have
to think of him ever again.

763
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,953
Let's just pray he's a bald fascist

764
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,747
who picks his nose and wipes it
under the car seat.

765
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,130
- Hi.
- Hi.

766
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,757
Could you hold on?

767
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,023
Where ya goin'?

768
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,319
You better be buying me one friggin'
big birthday cake, that's all I gotta say.

769
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,071
Could I get your destination, please?

770
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,907
- The Waldorf, I guess.
- Finally she gets it.

771
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:56,455
Okay, we are going... that way.

772
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,124
And I'm gonna follow you.

773
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,253
Come on, you can do it yourself.
Just open up the computer and look into it.

774
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,171
I'm not even sure that I can
give you this information.

775
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,423
Yes, you can. Why can't you?

776
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,967
Because I'm just a temp, okay?
I don't know the rules.

777
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,761
Couple of months out of college, you're acting
like you're part of the establishment.

778
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:14,307
No, no, no, no, no...
What about privacy law, huh?

779
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,809
Forget about privacy laws.
You know what privacy laws do?

780
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,561
- No.
- They protect millionaires.

781
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,687
Do you know who those millionaires are?

782
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,689
- Who?
- Tell him who they are.

783
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,858
- Tell him.
- Kids your age.

784
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,278
Pimple-faced college dropouts
who have made unhealthy sums of money

785
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,281
forming Internet companies
that create no concrete products,

786
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,117
provide no viable services
and still manage to generate profits

787
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,953
for all of its lazy, day-trading,
son-of-a-bitch shareholders.

788
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:39,290
Meanwhile, as a tortured member
of the disenfranchised proletariat,

789
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:43,127
you find some altruistic need
to protect these digital plantation owners?

790
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,338
Wow. Come on.

791
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,134
Come on.

792
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,932
- You guys want the tenant on record in 1994?
- December, to be exact.

793
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,357
- There's your tenant.
- Sebastian Mignon?

794
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,150
No. Mignon. It's French.

795
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,402
No, we're looking for someone
named Sara in that apartment.

796
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,321
You got the right one?

797
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,281
Maybe he was her boyfriend.

798
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,744
Thanks. Hey, you did the right thing.
Really, you did.

799
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,245
Good work, pal.

800
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,373
You got it.
M-i-g-n-o-n.

801
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,416
You got it? There you go.

802
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,544
Thank you so much, Sally.
You gotta love her.

803
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,629
- Where is he?
- Brooklyn.

804
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,214
Okay, let's, uh...

805
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,674
- Let's grab a subway.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

806
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,675
Aren't you forgetting about something?

807
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,927
- Uh, what?
- Wedding rehearsal. Bachelor party.

808
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,595
- Plenty of time. Plenty of time. Come on.
- You sure?

809
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,014
Yes. Gotta go to Brooklyn. Come on.

810
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,229
Okay...
Prada!

811
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,730
Oh, my God!

812
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,025
Ooh! Prada!

813
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,946
Ooh, I love this stuff.

814
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,281
- That's $20.
- 20 bucks?

815
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,784
Eve, that's a horrific knockoff.

816
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:00,287
At least my fake says Prada.
Yours says Prado.

817
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,208
Yeah? Well, I say for a dollar,
I can buy a little magic marker and fix that.

818
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,627
I'll take it. 20 bucks?

819
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,380
Right back here.
Here you go.

820
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,383
Two buckets of balls for the price of one
at the Chelsea Piers today.

821
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,135
- So where are we going to now?
- I don't know.

822
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,053
- Lady, lady, you're a golfer?
- I feel like... I feel something.

823
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,930
- Wanna play golf? Two for the price of one.
- Right where I'm standing.

824
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,890
Hey! Who are you?

825
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:24,145
Can you believe that?
Two bucket of... Whoa!

826
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:28,232
Will you help me up, ma'am?
Yeah, yeah, help me up.

827
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,235
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Is the ball okay?

828
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,070
Yeah, the back of the head.
Is that all right?

829
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,073
Oh, my. Goodness gracious.

830
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,491
I'm all right. Thank you.
Can you get the flyers?

831
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,452
- Here you go.
- All right.

832
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,705
- It's a signal.
- Two buckets of balls.

833
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,083
- Taxi!
- Sara!

834
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,045
They should make pills for this.

835
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,850
He's gotta be here.

836
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,810
He's got to be here. I can feel it.

837
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,208
- Excuse me. Miss?
- Yeah?

838
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,920
- You're blocking my shot.
- Oh.

839
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,256
Oh. Sorry.

840
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:44,517
This is Nick Roberts,
ESPN News, New York City.

841
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,270
- Oh!
- Do you know who plays golf?

842
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:51,398
Guys who are too fat to play tennis.

843
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,567
Like that guy.

844
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,486
Well, this is a special occasion.

845
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,572
After all, how many times in your life
is your son gonna get married?

846
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,157
Well said.

847
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,409
You wanna know
why I love this game?

848
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,161
- No. Why?
- I'll tell ya.

849
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:08,833
You can take years off from playing
and still come back strong.

850
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,585
Well, me, I haven't played
in over five years.

851
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,711
You're kidding.

852
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,008
- Ow!
- Ooh!

853
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,135
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

854
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,177
Sorry up there.

855
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,138
- Eve, look out!
- Go.

856
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,807
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

857
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,934
I'm, so sorr...
Are you okay?

858
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,186
Please say something.
Say something.

859
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,397
I think I swallowed a filling.

860
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,274
Thank you for letting us in.

861
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:37,027
Now, Mr. Mignon, we have an odd
and somewhat personal question to ask you.

862
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,571
Mignon.

863
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,782
Mr. Mignon.

864
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,826
Mignon. Like the meat.

865
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,873
Mr. Mignon, a few years ago,
did you live with a girl, first name Sara?

866
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,458
Attractive, dark hair,
kind of, like, mysterious,

867
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,544
you know, really amazing girl.

868
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,712
Oui.

869
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,630
Do you know where we can
locate this individual?

870
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,632
No, I do not.

871
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,385
- Do you remember her last name?
- No.

872
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,512
Oh, come on. You don't even remember
the last name of your ex-girlfriend?

873
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,847
I mean, I find that hard to believe.

874
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,640
You don't understand anything.

875
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,935
She was not my girlfriend.
She was just, uh, a roommate.

876
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,979
She stayed with me
for a very short period of time.

877
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,982
- She was placed with me by...
- A roommate finder's service?

878
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:18,736
Oui, oui, oui. She stayed with me
with her boyfriend for a few months...

879
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:22,823
- I don't care about him.
- And then he moved out very quickly.

880
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,492
And at the end of the year,
she moved out too. That's it.

881
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,661
Yeah, but did she leave
anything behind,

882
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,247
maybe with her last name on it,
like a receipt, a bill?

883
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,583
- Like a piece of luggage?
- No. No, no.

884
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,501
Anything would help, really.
Anything.

885
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,922
I remember she sat on me.

886
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,635
She... She sat on you?

887
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:46,639
Yes. She sat on me for a while.

888
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,475
I found her...

889
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,477
inspiring.

890
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,773
I guess this is why I started
painting her in the first place.

891
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,400
Oh. She sat for you.
I'm sorry.

892
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,153
That is what I said.

893
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,072
- That's what he said.
- Right.

894
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,573
- That's what I said.
- Clearly.

895
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,330
Do you happen to have the painting?

896
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,505
Hey, now you're gonna see
what it's all about.

897
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,839
You know, you see her face.

898
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,259
Okay. Yeah.

899
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,845
This is her, yes?

900
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,726
Yeah, sure.
Around the eyes a little.

901
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,852
I mean, I'm definitely getting
the British thing,

902
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:36,021
you know, with the crown
and the scepter.

903
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,399
Do you have a name
for the roommate finder's service?

904
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,733
- They would have the information.
- Absolutely.

905
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,820
- Yes. You have that name?
- No, I do not.

906
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:48,158
But if it helps, I do remember
where the service was located.

907
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,910
- Absolutely!
- Yes! Where? Where?

908
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:55,207
- Manhattan.
- Where in Manhattan, Mr. Mignon?

909
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,458
On 60th Street.

910
00:54:56,501 --> 00:55:01,005
- Eastside or Westside?
- It was just next to that...

911
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:04,633
on the left of that splendid
little patisserie,

912
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,927
Serendipity.

913
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,472
That's it.

914
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,272
Get... Get ready.

915
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,443
Happy birthday.
It's on the house.

916
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,320
Thank you.

917
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,530
Thanks.

918
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,284
Oh, I'm a god-awful friend.

919
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,202
No, you will be if you sing.

920
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,125
Eve, thanks so much
for coming with me.

921
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,585
You're welcome.

922
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,464
Sara, you know,
it's a wonderful thought.

923
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,966
The idea that all of life,

924
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,302
that every single event
is all part of some master plan

925
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,055
designed to lead us
to our universal soul mate.

926
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:54,808
But if that's really true,
then what's the point of living?

927
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,144
Or making decisions?

928
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,104
Hell, why should we even get out of bed
in the morning?

929
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:00,939
For the cake?

930
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:04,109
No. Not for the cake.

931
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,278
So that you make mistakes.

932
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,156
Mistakes like this trip.

933
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,326
And if you're smart enough,
you learn from your mistakes.

934
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,661
You figure it out.
You... You think.

935
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:18,082
You... You realize that life isn't
some elaborate stage play

936
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:21,251
with directions for the actors.
Life's a mess, Sara.

937
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,463
It's... It's chaos personified.

938
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,593
I have to give it all up now, don't I?

939
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:35,682
Sara, you have a fiancé
who, despite his weird Eastern music,

940
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:39,686
which we hope is just a phase,
let's hope,

941
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,022
loves you very, very, very much.

942
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,066
It's not giving up. It's growing up.

943
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,825
Let's get out of here.

944
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,743
Yeah.

945
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,429
- Here's one.
- Ooh, catch it.

946
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:26,233
- It's a bridal shop.
- Oh, my God. The irony.

947
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,402
Wait right here. I'll be right back.

948
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,862
- Why?
- Stay here.

949
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,951
- Time, please?
- Uh, about 7:30.

950
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,327
Right. Right.

951
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,591
They moved downtown. If we get lucky
with traffic, we can still hit it.

952
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,342
- What time is rehearsal?
- Can't do it.

953
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,303
- Taxi!
- It's over, man.

954
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,722
What?

955
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,182
- What are you talking about?
- How can I ignore that?

956
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,600
"Bless the goddamn bride"?

957
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,685
- What?
- It can't get any more clearer than this.

958
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,480
I'm not supposed to be doing this.
It's not in the cards.

959
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:07,024
It's just...
Hey, it's another one of your clues, man.

960
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,775
Let's talk about it in the cab
on the way over. Let's go.

961
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,486
It's not a clue. It's a sign.

962
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:12,654
Well, what's the difference?

963
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,699
A clue is what a detective uses
to find a suspect.

964
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,451
The receipt, the warehouse,
that French guy...

965
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,119
- Uh-huh.
- Those are clues. This is a sign.

966
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,288
Me never finding the book, that's a sign.

967
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,624
Sara never finding the $5.00 bill,
that's a sign.

968
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,084
How could something not happening
be a sign?

969
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,129
Maybe the absence of signs is a sign.

970
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:31,465
Isn't it?

971
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,217
That's lucid.

972
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,219
Look, I don't know, man.
Maybe there is no fate.

973
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,930
And if there is,
it's not working for me.

974
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,518
You know, it's not actually supposed
to end this way, by the way.

975
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,229
We're supposed to pull the curtain
and see the wizard, all right?

976
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,606
- Get to the end of the river.
- This is the end of the river.

977
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,650
My wedding rehearsal starts
in less than an hour.

978
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,318
My bride is waiting for me.

979
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,903
Let me... Let me ask you
something here, okay?

980
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,239
If Sara were here right now,
poof, came down,

981
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,740
what would she tell you to do?

982
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,825
She would tell me to run,
not walk to the Waldorf

983
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,327
because all the signs point to me
getting married.

984
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,913
Look. Wedding dress.
Lots of white.

985
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,540
Okay, I hate to state the obvious...

986
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,541
- State it.
- Okay.

987
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:10,087
If you don't do this,
you may never find out who Sara is.

988
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,548
Maybe I was never supposed to.

989
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,300
Maybe all this is just a maze

990
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:18,845
designed to lead me directly back
to where I started.

991
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,475
Which is getting married.

992
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,107
They should make pills for this.

993
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,739
- Halley?
- Oh, my God. Eve!

994
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:41,618
What a crazy coincidence!
How are you?

995
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,036
- Good.
- Oh, my God.

996
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:47,416
Sara, can you believe
that I was Halley's R.A. In college?

997
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:50,627
Isn't that funny?
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Sara.

998
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,796
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

999
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,716
Oh, my gosh. What's it been,
like eight or nine years or something.

1000
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,676
Eve was, uh...
I went to B.U. With Eve.

1001
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,887
- Well, isn't that wonderful?
- Yeah. How about that?

1002
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,097
So what are you doing here?

1003
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,641
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- You are?

1004
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,435
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

1005
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,020
- Congratulations.
- Wow!

1006
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,731
- Thanks.
- In this hotel?

1007
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,899
Yeah, at 12 noon.
We're actually going to rehearsal.

1008
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,528
- Why don't you come watch?
- Why don't you go?

1009
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,238
Okay, sure. I would love
to come and watch.

1010
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:22,659
And you can bring your...
partner if you want.

1011
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,246
- Oh!
- Oh! No, no.

1012
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,832
I have to go upstairs and call my fiancé...

1013
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:33,170
...who's a man.
- Oh! You must be very proud.

1014
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:36,131
- Okay, so have a good one.
- Okay.

1015
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,591
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, good. Okay, bye.

1016
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,428
Good-bye, my sweet lesbian lady lover.

1017
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,889
I'm just kidding.
It's a joke between us.

1018
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:57,653
Lars?

1019
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,573
What are you doing?

1020
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:04,117
How did you know where I was?

1021
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,245
- Intuition.
- Really?

1022
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:11,375
No. I went through
the New York hotel guide.

1023
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:14,544
Alphabetically, in reverse.
I started with "Z."

1024
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:17,047
Sara, I missed you so much.

1025
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,510
I'm sorry. I don't blame you
for running away.

1026
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:27,015
I was so... focused
on the album, the video.

1027
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,771
I, Jonathan, take you, Halley,
to be my wife,

1028
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,564
and I promise to love and sustain you

1029
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:37,609
in the bonds of marriage
from this day forward.

1030
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,340
And obviously, Jonathan,
you'll be looking at Halley.

1031
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:04,428
And that's when the actual ceremony
will conclude.

1032
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,637
- Excuse me.
- What?

1033
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,847
Well, look, I need some help over here.

1034
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,850
And then... then you're married.

1035
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,352
- Hal, who's that girl over there?
- Huh?

1036
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,522
- Oh, that's my old friend Eve.
- Oh.

1037
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,399
Okay, everyone, that's a wrap.

1038
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,693
And now make sure to be here
tomorrow morning

1039
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,111
at 9:00 sharp for pictures.

1040
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,447
Yes, yes. I hate to break up a good thing,

1041
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,449
but we have half a dozen strippers
waiting for us. We're late.

1042
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,617
- You mean "exotic dancers."
- No, no. I actually mean "strippers,"

1043
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,537
- the women who take off everything.
- Llsten, I'll see you men at 9:00.

1044
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,039
But remember, I promised Judy
I'd be home by 10:00.

1045
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,000
Fantastic, Mr. McKinley.
It gives you an hour to get crazy.

1046
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,127
- Okay, let's get into it.
- Hello, darling.

1047
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,714
Uh, Dean, before you take Jon and Dad off
to your male-bonding ritual,

1048
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,090
I need to talk to him.

1049
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,177
Okay. Beautiful bride.
I'll be in the cab.

1050
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:50,807
- Hi. I want you to meet Jon.
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

1051
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,684
I would love for you
to come tomorrow.

1052
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:56,396
- We'd feel terrible if you didn't.
- Really?

1053
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:57,898
- Yeah.
- That's so sweet.

1054
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,316
And it's tomorrow at noon?

1055
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,151
Yeah, and you can bring
your friend if you want.

1056
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,736
- Okay.
- Be there.

1057
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,737
Wow. I'll be there.

1058
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,073
Thank you. That's so nice.

1059
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,742
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow. Nice to meet you.

1060
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,702
Okay, bye. Bye. See you.

1061
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,083
- Halley, what is it? What's wrong?
- It's you.

1062
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,752
What do you mean, it's me?
What did I do?

1063
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,755
Nothing, exactly.
It's just this feeling I have, like...

1064
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,091
like you've been somewhere else
for the past few days.

1065
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,011
- That's not true.
- Don't lie to me, Jonathan.

1066
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:34,351
I've dreamed about this
my entire life, and... and...

1067
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:37,187
I've imagined the dress and the flowers

1068
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,023
and even the music
the band was gonna play.

1069
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:43,318
And everything is
exactly the way I want it,

1070
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,444
except for my fiancé,

1071
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,780
who's just decided to float off
to Never-Never Land.

1072
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,199
Look, maybe I've been
a little bit out of it the past week,

1073
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,451
but it's just normal, you know, guy stuff.

1074
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,119
It's a little cold feet.
Doesn't mean I don't love you.

1075
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,956
Well, call me crazy, but I'd like
my fiancé's feet to be warm,

1076
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:59,167
especially when we're hours
from going down the aisle.

1077
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:04,005
I'm sorry, Hal. Really, I am.

1078
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:10,887
Whatever it is that you're holding on to,
please just let it go.

1079
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,682
Please.

1080
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,352
I think it already let go of me, okay?

1081
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,191
Wait. Wait one second.

1082
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,405
- What's this?
- What do you think?

1083
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:31,241
It's the traditional groom's gift.

1084
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,827
I got yours, and I forgot to bring it.

1085
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,203
I know. It's okay.

1086
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:37,122
Open it.

1087
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,714
It's a first edition.

1088
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,259
It's just that every time
we go into a bookstore,

1089
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,177
you're always flipping through it.

1090
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,805
And I checked this week.
You don't even have a copy.

1091
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,988
What's wrong?
Don't you like it?

1092
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,409
It's perfect.

1093
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,329
It's an excellent choice.

1094
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,933
What's going on?
Are you all right?

1095
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:42,187
- Her name's Sara Thomas.
- What?

1096
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,899
How did...

1097
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,363
Halley gave it to me as a wedding gift.

1098
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,045
Sally?

1099
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,049
It's Dean from Obits. Hey.

1100
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,176
Uh, I need an address
for a Sara Thomas.

1101
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,970
S-a-r-a T-h-o-m-a-s.

1102
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,597
Uh, I got an old phone number.

1103
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,394
Yeah, we'll hold.

1104
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:27,107
Hang on.
Sir, can you pull this thing over?

1105
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,483
I can't hear a thing.

1106
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,445
Honey, just one second.
Okay, go. What?

1107
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,531
What?

1108
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:40,245
We have to cancel Dusseldorf.
Why?

1109
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,123
We have to cancel Stockholm?

1110
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:19,242
Oh. Look at those stars.

1111
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,911
They all have names, you know.

1112
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,457
I don't know what that is.

1113
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,724
It's Cassiopeia.

1114
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,355
The... stars in the sky.

1115
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:53,234
It's... It's Cassiopeia.

1116
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,121
You realize with the time delay,

1117
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,373
if our return flight takes off
more than ten minutes late,

1118
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,293
I miss my own wedding, okay?
Does that bother you in the slightest?

1119
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,129
You are a jackass.

1120
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:17,383
- Well, thank you.
- You are. You...

1121
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:20,303
Y-Y-You're my hero, you know?

1122
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:23,098
You're like my oracle and shit,
you know?

1123
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,975
You're out there, man,
and you're making it happen.

1124
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:29,729
Courtney moved out.

1125
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,737
- What?
- Yeah. It's... Look, man.

1126
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:41,074
We'd been fighting for a really long time.

1127
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,663
- Why didn't you tell me?
- We didn't want to ruin your wedding, man.

1128
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:48,832
It would just... Didn't want
to rain on your parade, man.

1129
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,750
What the...
What the hell happened?

1130
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,504
We just...
We let it slip away, you know?

1131
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,798
That's the point. It...

1132
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,883
You know, it died.

1133
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,845
- We died.
- What was the cause of death?

1134
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:07,600
Not enough of all of this, of this, of this.

1135
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:10,937
And not enough, you know? Do you...

1136
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,106
Do you remember
the philosopher Epictetus?

1137
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,482
- You remember what he said?
- No, of course not.

1138
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,067
He said, "If you want to improve,

1139
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,945
be content to be thought
foolish and stupid."

1140
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,446
That's what you've done.

1141
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:26,077
- I work hard at it.
- Now I want to be a jackass.

1142
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:28,204
You know?

1143
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,874
You're the shit!

1144
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,793
That would be me, the shit.

1145
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,588
Yeah. He's the shit. Okay.

1146
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,173
You know what, old buddy?

1147
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,175
On second thought,
maybe you should call first.

1148
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,260
- What are you talking about?
- Give her a ring. It's more polite that way.

1149
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,638
Calling her gives her a chance
to clean up, you know.

1150
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,431
I don't care how clean her house is!

1151
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,433
- She might. She might.
- What are you talking about?

1152
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,477
- You told me to go! You said I was your hero!
- I forbid you to look.

1153
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:34,229
I forbid you to look. You can't look.

1154
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:36,564
Why are you Van Gundy?

1155
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,858
- I don't want you to get hurt. Don't get hurt!
- I won't get hurt.

1156
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,818
- Listen, don't get hurt!
- You're hurting me! Oof!

1157
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:22,277
- I think that went very well.
- [Sighs]

1158
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:25,822
Didn't... Didn't she say that everything
happens for a reason?

1159
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:29,033
- Yeah, she did.
- Well, maybe we're laying here because...

1160
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:30,285
Because why?

1161
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:34,289
Because you don't want to be
standing somewhere else.

1162
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,886
I see. Yeah. We're crawling.

1163
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,138
We're crawling.

1164
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,932
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.

1165
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,518
I'm sorry to report that we're gonna be
on the ground a little longer

1166
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,520
due to some bad weather
heading this way.

1167
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,440
The air traffic controller has put us on hold,
so in the meantime,

1168
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,817
I've asked the cabin attendants
to start the movie.

1169
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,863
- Hey, you getting ready?
- Yeah.

1170
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:09,157
You know me.
I love a good wedding.

1171
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:12,493
- So have you talked to Lars?
- Yeah.

1172
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:15,163
We spoke this morning before he left.

1173
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:18,958
I think he's gonna be okay.
At least I hope so.

1174
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,209
You know, of course he's gonna be okay,

1175
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,628
and I gotta tell you something,
you're gonna be okay too.

1176
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:24,213
Yeah?

1177
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,301
Oh, you know what?
Um, there's a lady glaring at me.

1178
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,969
I don't think I'm supposed to be
on the phone.

1179
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,554
Um, can I call you when I get home?

1180
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,598
Have a safe flight, okay?

1181
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,768
- Lots of love. Bye.
- Headsets?

1182
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,520
- Yes, I will.
- $3.00, please.

1183
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,066
What the hell is this?

1184
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:44,901
Something the matter?

1185
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:49,155
Yes. I think I've mixed up my wallet
with my friend's.

1186
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,656
Yes, I have. See? Prado.

1187
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,158
Oh.

1188
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,285
Well, is there any money in it?

1189
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:55,953
I'll have a look.

1190
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,708
Yes, there is. Thank you.

1191
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:22,647
Two ones... and a five.

1192
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:24,941
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you.

1193
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:28,694
- Uh, sorry. Excuse me.
- That's the gentleman's change.

1194
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,239
- Jonathan.
- Excuse me. I just...

1195
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,198
Jonathan.

1196
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,659
Sorry. You know what? I'm gonna...

1197
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:38,079
Thank you. Excuse me.
Sorry. Whoo! I'm sorry!

1198
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,875
Hi. Yeah. It's in New York City.

1199
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:46,462
Um, I need the address of a Jonathan Trager.

1200
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:49,257
Yeah. T-r-a-g-e-r.

1201
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:54,303
34 Charles Street?
Thank you.

1202
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:55,888
34 Charles Street.

1203
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,107
Okay.
Hi.

1204
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,609
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- I'm looking for a Jonathan Trager.

1205
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:09,569
Is this his building?

1206
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,112
You must be late.

1207
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:12,196
Late for what?

1208
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,407
The wedding.
Waldorf-Astoria.

1209
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,830
- He's getting married?
- Yeah. Might be already.

1210
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:25,001
Wait! Hey, wait! Wait!

1211
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:26,544
Excuse me!

1212
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,339
Sorry. Can you take me
to the Waldorf-Astoria

1213
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:31,716
as fast as you can go, please?

1214
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,555
Can you see what it is?

1215
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,909
Oh! Sorry. Sorry!

1216
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,334
Oh. Oh, please, God, no.

1217
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:11,005
Stop!

1218
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,174
Stop?

1219
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,926
Is it over?

1220
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:16,886
- The wedding?
- Yeah.

1221
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:19,847
Oh, yeah.
It's over, all right.

1222
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:30,733
But don't worry.

1223
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,069
You'll get your present back.

1224
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:38,241
- Excuse me?
- They always return the presents.

1225
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,285
You asked if it was over.

1226
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:45,122
The truth is, it never even began.

1227
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:46,874
What?

1228
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:49,961
Yeah, he called the whole thing off
this morning.

1229
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,924
He called it off?

1230
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,601
That's terrible.

1231
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:09,272
Were you a friend of the bride...

1232
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:13,568
or the groom?

1233
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,245
- What's up with this weather, huh?
- Yeah, what happened to spring?

1234
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:27,039
So, all right, let's get into it.

1235
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:28,499
What kind of pep talk
do you want?

1236
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,542
What do you got?

1237
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,711
Well, I've got the inspirational,

1238
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:33,713
"You can achieve anything
you dream about."

1239
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,048
It's very popular,
but not appropriate for this.

1240
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:39,552
Of course, there's the "Don't worry.
There's more fish in the sea" pap.

1241
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:40,595
No.

1242
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,097
Uh, we can always fall back on the classic,

1243
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:47,018
"When God shuts a door,
he opens a window."

1244
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:50,313
How about telling me
I did the right thing?

1245
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:52,481
I don't have to tell you.

1246
01:16:54,234 --> 01:16:55,234
I wrote it.

1247
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,154
- What's this?
- It's your obituary.

1248
01:16:58,196 --> 01:16:59,947
Nice.

1249
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:02,617
Turns out I had writer's block
penning your best man speech,

1250
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:03,951
and that's what ended up coming out.

1251
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:06,245
Blame it on the day job.

1252
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,749
- 20, right?
- Thanks.

1253
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,171
You going to see Courtney?

1254
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:17,256
Absolutely.

1255
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:19,842
I needed this.

1256
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:25,890
You know, the Greeks
didn't write obituaries.

1257
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,393
They only asked one question
after a man died:

1258
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:33,481
"Did he have passion?"

1259
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:39,028
How do I look?

1260
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,660
Like a jackass.

1261
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,914
- Good luck, man.
- Thank you.

1262
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,428
Jonathan Trager,

1263
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:07,682
prominent television producer for ESPN,

1264
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:13,312
died last night from complications
of losing his soul mate and his fiancée.

1265
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,774
He was 35 years old

1266
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,192
and soft-spoken

1267
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:19,568
and obsessive.

1268
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:22,405
Trager never looked the part
of a hopeless romantic.

1269
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:25,700
But in the final days of his life,

1270
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:28,661
he revealed an unknown side
of his psyche.

1271
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:32,248
This hidden quasi-Jungian persona

1272
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:35,209
surfaced during
the Agatha Christie-like pursuit

1273
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:37,503
for his long-reputed soul mate,

1274
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,881
a woman whom he only spent
a few precious hours with.

1275
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,803
Sadly, the protracted search
ended late Saturday night

1276
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:49,140
in complete and utter failure.

1277
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:52,101
Yet even in certain defeat,

1278
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:54,937
the courageous Trager
secretly clung to the belief

1279
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,147
that life is not merely

1280
01:18:56,189 --> 01:18:58,983
a series of meaningless
accidents or coincidences.

1281
01:18:59,025 --> 01:19:02,445
Uh-uh. But rather
it's a tapestry of events

1282
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:06,407
that culminate in an exquisite,
sublime plan.

1283
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,618
Asked about the loss
of his dear friend,

1284
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:10,870
Dean Kansky,

1285
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,288
the Pulitzer Prize-winning author

1286
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,039
and executive editor
of the New York Times,

1287
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:16,500
described Jonathan
as a changed man

1288
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:18,252
in the last days of his life.

1289
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:21,672
"Things were clearer for him,"
Kansky noted.

1290
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:24,633
Ultimately, Jonathan concluded
that if we are to live life

1291
01:19:24,676 --> 01:19:25,968
in harmony with the universe,

1292
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,345
we must all possess a powerful faith

1293
01:19:28,388 --> 01:19:30,431
in what the ancients
used to call fatum,

1294
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,267
what we currently refer to...

1295
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:35,770
...as destiny.
- Destiny.

1296
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:49,825
So what are you gonna do?

1297
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,745
I don't know. I guess I'm just gonna
try and find him or something.

1298
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:53,913
Oh, you know what?
I don't think you should do that.

1299
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:54,914
I really don't.

1300
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:56,749
- Well, what do you think I should do?
- I think you should just be here.

1301
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,543
I feel it. I feel it in the air.

1302
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:00,795
Eve, what's happened to you?

1303
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:04,006
You've become your own worst
nightmare right there.

1304
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:07,635
Bye.

1305
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:14,892
But please put a jacket on.
It's freezing out here.

1306
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:49,356
I'm Jon.

1307
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:52,860
I'm Sara.

1308
01:24:43,536 --> 01:24:45,204
Happy anniversary.

1309
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:48,332
When did you get to be
so unabashedly romantic?

1310
01:24:48,374 --> 01:24:52,586
I think it's good luck we return each year
to the scene of the crime.

1311
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:56,632
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1312
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:02,054
Oh, I don't think so!
No beverages on the premises!

1313
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:04,389
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- Hey, how you doing?

1314
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:05,641
- Don't you remember me?
- Yes, I do.

1315
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:07,601
- This is the girl.
- Miss Carbon Copy?

1316
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:08,602
- Yes.
- I see.

1317
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:11,271
- This is the guy who helped me...
- If you're not gonna purchase anything,

1318
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:12,731
please make room
for paying customers.

1319
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,109
We do. We want some gloves.
Black cashmere gloves.

1320
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:17,569
Oh, I'm sorry.
That'll be the closing bell.

1321
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,029
- Perhaps tomorrow.
- Oh, you're not serious.

1322
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,697
- Come on.
- Store hours 10:00 to 7:00,

1323
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:23,117
- except Sundays and holidays...
- He warms up.

1324
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:24,618
...at the discretion
of the management

1325
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:27,287
or the possible exception
of visiting dignitaries.

1326
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:30,916
Oh, no, no, no! Don't... please, please!
On the other side of the counter.

1327
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:34,169
You cannot come back here.
This is for authorized personnel only.

1328
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:36,130
Please remain on the other side
of the counter.

1329
01:25:36,172 --> 01:25:37,214
Thank you very much.
