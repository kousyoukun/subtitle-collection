Rushing home to

00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,159
to listen to the automatic laundry
and the electric dishwasher

65
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,916

<i>Jeff, wives don't nag
anymore, they discuss.</i>

68
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,914
Well, maybe in the high-rent
district they discuss.

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,150

news the next time, huh?

72
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,835

75
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,314
You're giving them
far too much water.

you shut up?

77
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,075

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,430

00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,680
And they got no windows

82
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,754
You know, in the old days, they used to
put your eyes out with a red-hot poker.

83

94

95

I predicted that.

96
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,110
(MUMBLING) Just how did
you do that, Stella?

97
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,474
Oh, simple.

98
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,076
I was nursing a director
of General Motors.

99
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,279
"Kidney ailment," they said.
"Nerves," I said.

100
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,513
Then I asked myself, "What's General
Motors got to be nervous about?"

101
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,791
"Overproduction,"
I says. "Collapse."

102
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,475
When General Motors has to go
to the bathroom 10 times a day,

103
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,074
the whole country's
ready to let go.

104
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,438
You know, Stella,
in economics,

105
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,239
a kidney ailment has no
relationship to the stock market.

didn't it?

108
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,718

here in this apartment.

109
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,397
First you <i>smash</i> your leg, then you
get to looking out the window,

110
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,154
see things you shouldn't see.
Trouble.

111
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,398
I can see you

112
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,950
surrounded by a bunch of lawyers
in double-breasted suits.

113
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,240
You're pleading. You say, "Judge, it
was only a little bit of innocent fun.

114
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,312
"I love my neighbours,

115
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,437
And the judge says,
"Well, congratulations.

116
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,871
"You've just given birth
to three years in Dannemora."

117
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,634

118
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,233
You've got a
hormone deficiency.

119
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,033
How can you tell
from a thermometer?

120
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,031
Those bathing beauties
you've been watching

121
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,590
haven't raised your temperature
one degree in a month.

122
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,794
Here we go.

123
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,358
One more week.

124
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,232
No, I think you're right. I think there
is gonna be trouble around here.

125
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,754
I knew it.

126
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,115
Ooh!

127
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,396
Do you ever
heat that stuff?

128
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,232
Gives your circulation
something to fight.

129
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,310
Oh, I see.

130
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,959
What kind
of trouble?

131
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,792
Lisa Fremont.

132
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,075
You kidding?

133
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,836
She's a beautiful young girl, and
you're a reasonably healthy young man.

134
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,240
She expects me
to marry her.

135
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,355
That's normal.

136
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,635
I don't want to.

137
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,710
That's abnormal.

138
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,440
I just... I'm not
ready for marriage.

139
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,672
Every man's ready for marriage
when the right girl comes along.

140
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,673
And Lisa Fremont is the right girl
for any man with half a brain

141
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,194
who can get
one eye open.

142
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,873
She's all right.

143
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,871

No.

144

What?

146
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,909
Please, Stella.

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,513
It's happened

151
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,389
Yeah, she's
only perfect.

152
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,515
She's too perfect. She's too talented. She's
too beautiful. She's too sophisticated.

153
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,637
She's too everything

simple, Stella.

156
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,753
She belongs to that rarefied
atmosphere of Park Avenue, you know.

157
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,037
Expensive restaurants and
literary cocktail parties.

158
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,157
People with sense belong
wherever they're put.

159
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,153
Can you imagine her traveling
around the world with a camera bum

160
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,311
who never has more than a
week's salary in the bank?

161
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,074
If she was
only ordinary.

162
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,433
You never gonna
get married?

163
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,989
I'll probably get married
one of these days,

164
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,549
but when I do, it's gonna be
to someone who thinks of life

165
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,271
not just <i>as</i> a new dress
and a lobster dinner

166
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,431
or latest scandal.

167
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,512
I need a woman who's
willing to... Hold it.

168
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,480
Who's willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it.

169
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,159
So the honest thing for me to do
is just call the whole thing off.

170
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,231
Let her find
somebody else.

171
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,231
Yeah, I can
hear you now.

172
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,550
"Get out of my life, you
perfectly wonderful woman.

173
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,313
"You're too
good for me."

174
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,755
Look, Mr. Jefferies, I'm
not an educated woman,

175
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,598
but I can tell
you one thing.

176
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,036
When a man and a woman see each
other and like each other,

177
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,432
they ought to come together, wham,
like a couple of taxis on Broadway,

178
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,753
and not sit around analyzing each
other like two specimens in a bottle.

179
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,958
There's an intelligent way
to approach marriage.

180
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,155
Intelligence.

181
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,199
Nothing has caused the human race
so much trouble as intelligence.

get excited, get married."

186
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,394
Now it's, "Read a lot of books, fence
with a lot of four-syllable words,

When I married Myles, we were both
a couple of maladjusted misfits.

192
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,999
We are still maladjusted misfits, and
we have loved every minute of it.

193
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,070
Well, that's
fine, Stella.

194
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,151
Now, would you fix me
a sandwich, please?

195
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,469
Yes, I will.

196
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,439
And I'll spread a little
common sense on the bread.

197

Lisa's loaded to her
fingertips with love for you.

198
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,478
I got two words of advice for you.
Marry her.

199
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,789
She pay you much?

200
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,915
Oh!

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,313
There.

202
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,471
Here's the key. Thank you.

203
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,159
Well, if you want
anything, just ring.

It's right off the Paris plane.
Do you think it'll sell?

That depends on the quote,
you know. Let's see now.

Eleven hundred?

228
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,035
They ought to list that dress
on the stock exchange.

229
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,158
Why, we sell a dozen a
day in this price range.

230

Who buys them,

Why, is something big
going on somewhere?

It's going on right here.
It's a big night.

234
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,753
It's just an old run-of-the-mill Wednesday.
The calendar's full of them.

It's opening night of the last depressing
week of I.B. Jefferies in a cast.

236
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,550
Well I haven't noticed a big
demand for tickets or anything.

237
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,439
That's because I
bought out the house.

238
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,319
You know, this cigarette
box has seen better days.

239
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,951
I picked that up in Shanghai,
which has also seen better days.

240
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,352
It's cracked and you never use it.
It's too ornate.

I'm sending up a plain, flat, silver
one with just your initials engraved.

That's no way to spend
your hard-earned money.

243
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,554
Well, I wanted to.

No, better
than that. '21 .'

Yes, madam. Let's
open the wine now.

Yeah, they're fine.

I can't think of anything more boring or
tiresome than what you've been through,

Yeah, I want to get this

269
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,590
All right.
Good night.

00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,079
Good night.

(SIGHS) What a day
I've had.

272
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,876
Are you tired?

273
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,030
Not a bit.

274
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,316
I was all morning
in a sales meeting,

275
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,870
then I had to dash to the Waldorf for
a quick drink with Madame Dufresne,

276
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,157
who's just over from Paris
with some spy reports.

277
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,279
And then I had to go to '21' and have
lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people.

278
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,357
And that's when
I ordered dinner.

279
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,193
Then I had two fall
showings 20 blocks apart.

280
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,874
Then I had to have a cocktail
with Leland and Slim Hayward.

281
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,678
We're trying to
get his new show.

282
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,797
And then I had to
dash back and change.

283
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,431
Well, now, tell me. Tell me. Now,
what was Mrs. Hayward wearing?

284
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,392
Oh, she looked wonderfully cool.
She did.

285
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,359
She had on the most
divine Italian hand-print

286
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,437

Oh, Italian?

287
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,551
Oh, you.

in the columns about you today.

289
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,190
You did?

290
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,714
You can't buy that
kind of publicity.

291
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,393
I know.

292
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,360
Someday you may want to open
up a studio of your own here.

293
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,115
How would I run it
from, say, Pakistan?

could pick your assignment.

was one I wanted.

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,989
Make the one
you want.

298
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,918
You mean leave the magazine?
Yes.

299
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,956
For what?

300
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,917
For yourself
and me.

301
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,272
I could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow.

302
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,357
Don't laugh.
I could do it.

303
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,238
That's what
I'm afraid of.

304
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,551
Can you see me driving down to
the fashion salon in a jeep,

305
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,758
wearing combat boots
and a three-day beard?

306
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,239
Wouldn't that
make a hit?

307
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,991
I could see you looking very handsome and
successful in a dark blue flannel suit.

308
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,630
Let's stop talking

I'm not stubborn.
I'm just truthful.

I know, a lesser man would have
told me it was one long holiday,

409
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,189
and I would have been awakened
to a rude disillusionment.

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,237
Must have been watching out
that window for hours.

462
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,799
Yeah, I was.

463
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,473
What are you gonna do if
one of them catches you?

464
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,073
It depends
which one.

465
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,673
Miss Torso,
for example...

466

You keep your
mind off her.

467
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,469
She sure is the "Eat,
drink and be merry" girl.

468
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,712
Yeah, she'll wind up fat,
alcoholic and miserable.

Yeah.

Oh, well.

Maybe one day she'll
find her happiness.

473
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,593
Yeah, and some man
will lose his.

474
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,275
Isn't there anybody in the neighbourhood
who could cast an eye in her direction?

475
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,759
I don't know.

476
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,515
It just might be that the
salesman will be available soon.

477
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,478
Oh, him and his wife
splitting up?

478
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,273
I just can't
figure it.

479
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:18,036
He went out several times last night
in the rain, carrying his sample case.

480
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,315
Well, he's a
salesman, isn't he?

481
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,795
What would he be selling
at 3:00 in the morning?

on her, the coward.

Yeah.

Sometimes it's worse
to stay than it is to run.

491
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,836
Yeah, well, it takes a particularly low
type of man to do a thing like that.

How about this morning?
Any further developments?

Why...

Why would a man leave his apartment three
times on a rainy night with a suitcase,

538
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,873
and come back
three times?

No, no. No, no.

No, no. Not this

And why didn't he
go to work today?

more interesting.

He went out a few minutes ago in his

What's the matter?

564
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,520
Sitting around looking out of the
window to kill time is one thing,

565
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,719
but doing it the way you are,
with binoculars and wild opinions

566
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,394
about every little thing
you see, is diseased!

What is it you're
looking for?

572
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,679
I just want to find out what's the matter
with the salesman's wife, that's all.

573
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,433
Does that make me
sound like a madman?

What makes you think there's
something the matter with her?

575
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,990
A lot of things. She's an invalid.
She demands constant care.

576
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,353
Yet neither the husband or anybody else
has been in to see her all day. Why?

577
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,440
Maybe she died.

He's in there now.
There's nothing to see.

581
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,674
There is something... I've
seen it through that window.

582

I've seen bickering
and family quarrels

583
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,911
and mysterious trips at night
and knives and saws and ropes.

584
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,877
And now, since last evening,
not a sign of the wife.

585
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,314
All right. Now you
tell me where she is.

586
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,391
I don't know. What's she doing?
Where is she?

587
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,438
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know.
I don't care!

588
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,638
Lots of people have knives and saws
and ropes around their houses.

589
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,678
And lots of men don't speak
to their wives all day.

590
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,354
Lots of wives nag and men
hate them and trouble starts,

591
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,559
but very, very few of them end up in
murder, if that's what you're thinking.

00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,995
It's pretty hard for you to keep
away from that word, isn't it?

593
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,760
You could see all that he did,
couldn't you? Of course...

594
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,473
You could see because
the shades were up

595
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,871
and he walked along the corridor
and the street and the backyard.

596
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,314
I've seen him in the backyard,
fixing the flowers...

597
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,392
Oh, Jeff, do you think a murderer
would let you see all that?

598
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,199
That he wouldn't pull the shades
down and hide behind them?

599
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,396
Just where he's being clever.
He's being nonchalant about it.

600
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,318
And that's where you're
not being clever.

601
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,234
A murderer would never parade his
crime in front of an open window.

you know,

00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,996
<i>rear mail box reads,
"Mr. and Mrs. Lars."</i>

616
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,435
<i>That's I-A-R-S.</i>

617
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,477
<i>Lars Thorwald.</i>

618
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,233
What's the number of
the apartment house?

619
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,880
<i>125 West
9th Street.</i>

620
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,479
Thank you, dear.

621
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,830
<i>Okay, chief. What's
my next assignment?</i>

622
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,910
Just go home.

623
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,719
<i>All right, but
what's he doing now?</i>

624
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,236
He's just sitting in the
living room in the dark.

625
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,600
Hasn't gone
near the bedroom.

626
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,353
Now you go home
and get some sleep.

627
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,397
<i>Good night.
Good night.</i>

628
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,554
<i>DOYLE: All right.
What's it all about, Jeff?</i>

629
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,996
Now look, Doyle, it's just something
I can't tell you over the telephone.

630
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,957
You have to be here
and see the whole setup.

631
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,030
<i>Important, huh?</i>

632
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,599
Well, it's probably
nothing important at all.

633
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,791
It's just a little neighbourhood
murder, that's all.

634
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,870
<i>Did you say
"murder," Jeff?</i>

635
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,598
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I did say "murder."

636
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,034
<i>Oh, come now.</i>

637
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,476
My only thought was throwing a little
business your way, that's all.

638
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,518
I figured a good detective would jump
at the chance of something to detect.

639
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,199
<i>I'm not working. What'?</i>

640
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,953
<i>This happens to
be my day off.</i>

641
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,998
Well, l usually took my best
pictures on my day off.

642
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,155
<i>I'll drop by.</i>

643
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,874
Okay, Doyle. All right.
As soon as you can.

644
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,109
Bless your heart, Stella.
Gee whiz, look at this.

645
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,157
I can't tell you what a
welcome sight this is.

646
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,231
No wonder your husband
still loves you.

647
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,913
The police.
What?

648
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,990
You called
the police.

649
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,991
Well, not exactly.

650
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,789
Not an official call. It's
just an old friend of mine.

651
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,918
An old, ornery
friend of mine.

652
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,833
Just where do you
suppose he cut her up?

653
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,994
Of course.
The bathtub.

654
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,919
That's the only place where he
could have washed away the blood.

655
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,680
He better get that trunk out of
there before it starts to leak.

656
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,634
WOMAN: Harry?

657
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,037
Look, look,
Mr. Jefferies.

658
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,990
I thought Doyle would be here
by the time the trunk left,

659
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,549
or I'd have called the police.
Now we're gonna lose it.

660
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,193
Hold everything. Don't
do anything foolish.

661
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,118
I'm just gonna get the name
off that freight truck.

662
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,470
I'll keep an eye on the alley.

663
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,633
Long distance.

664
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,395
You didn't see the killing or the body.
How do you know there was a murder?

665
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,518
Because everything this fellow's
done has been suspicious.

666
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,355
Trips at night in the rain, and
knives and saws and trunks with rope

667
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,670
and now this wife that
isn't there anymore.

668
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,550
I admit it all has a mysterious sound.
It could be any number of things.

669
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,994
Murder's the
least plausible.

670
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,469
Doyle, don't tell me he's
an unemployed magician,

671
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,598
amusing the neighbourhood with his
sleight of hand. Don't tell me that.

672
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,069
It's too obvious and stupid
a way to commit murder.

673
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,798
In full view
of 50 windows?

674
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,075
Then sit over there
smoking a cigar,

675
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,753
waiting for the police
to come and pick him up?

676
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,229
All right, Officer, do your duty.
Go over and pick him up.

677
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,591
Jeff, you've got a lot
to learn about homicide.

678
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,876
Why, morons have committed
murder so shrewdly,

679
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,237
it's taken a hundred trained
police minds to catch them.

680
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,914
That salesman wouldn't just
knock his wife off after dinner

681
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,514
and toss her in the trunk
and put her in storage.

682
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,920
I'll bet it's
been done.

683
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,237
Most everything's
been done, under panic.

684
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,391
This is a thousand-to-one shot

685
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,791
He's still sitting around the apartment.
That man's not panicked.

686
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,951
You think I
made all this up?

687
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,951
Well, I think
you saw something.

688
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,680
There's probably a very
simple explanation for that.

689
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,273
For instance?

690
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,919
Wife took a trip.

691
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,991
His wife was
sick in bed.

692
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,232
Yeah, so
you told me.

693
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,309
Well, Jeff, I've
got to run along.

694
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:09,794
I won't report this to the department.
Let me poke into it a little on my own.

695
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,633
No sense in your getting a
lot of ridiculous publicity.

696
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,074
Thank you.

697
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,238
We know the wife is gone,
so I'll see if I can find out 
where

698
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,549
Do that.

699
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,274
You had any
headaches lately?

700
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,714
Not until you
showed up.

701
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,792
It'll wear off, along
with the hallucinations.

702
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,439
See you around.

703
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,873
(DOG WHINING)

704
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,319
Get along.

705
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,754
(DOG BARKING)

706
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,079
He has a
six months' lease.

707
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,118
Used up a little more than
five and a half months of it.

708
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,635
He's quiet, drinks,
but not to drunkenness.

709
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,633
Pays his bills promptly with money
earned as a costume jewelry salesman.

710
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,040
Wholesale.

711
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,438
Kept to himself. None of his neighbours
got close to him or his wife.

712
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,352
Yeah, well, I think they
missed their chance with her.

713
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,475
She never left
the apartment...

714
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,278
Where is she? The icebox?
...until yesterday morning.

715
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,710
What time?
6:00 a.m.

716
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,154
6:00 a.m.

717
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,999
I think that's about
the time I fell asleep.

718
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,309
Too bad.

719
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,474
Thorwalds were leaving their
apartment at just that time.

720
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,511
Feel a little foolish?

721
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,473
No, not yet.

722
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,918
How's your wife?

723
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,149
Oh, she's fine.

724
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,877
Who said
they left then?

725
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,510
Who left where?

726
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,671
The Thorwalds,
at 6:00 in the morning.

727
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,434
Oh, the building superintendent
and two tenants.

728
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,558
Flat statements, no hesitation.
They jived with the letter.

729
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,075
Thorwalds were on their way
to the railroad station.

730
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,676
Well, now, Tom, how could
anybody possibly guess that?

731
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,919
What, did they have signs on their
luggage, saying, "Grand Central or bust?"

732
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,753
The superintendent met
Thorwald on his way back.

733
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,958
Thorwald told him that he'd put his
wife on a train to the country.

734
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,192
I see. I'd say this is a pretty
convenient guy, this superintendent.

735
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,193
Have you checked his
bank statements lately?

736
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,470
Huh?

737
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,074
Well, what good's
his information?

738
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,549
It's a secondhand version
of an unsupported story

739
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,392
by the murderer
himself, Thorwald.

740
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,030
Now did anybody actually see
the wife get on the train?

741
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,996
I hate to
remind you,

742
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,833
but this all started because
you said she was murdered.

743
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,078
Now, did anyone, including you,
actually see her murdered?

744
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,992
What are you doing?

745
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:16,119
Are you interested in solving this
case or in making me look foolish?

746
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,316
Well, if possible, both.

747
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,913
Well, then, do a
good job of it.

748
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,877
Go over there and search
Thorwald's apartment.

749
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,837
It must be knee-deep
in evidence.

750
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,354
I can't do that.

751
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,710
Well, no, I don't mean right now,
but when he goes out for a drink,

752
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,030
or a paper, or something. What
he doesn't know won't hurt him.

753
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,509
I can't do that,
even if he isn't there.

754
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,356
What's he... Does he have a courtesy card
from the police department, or something?

755
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,272
Now don't
get me mad.

756
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,598
Not even a detective can walk
into an apartment and search it.

757
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,752
If I were caught in there, they'd
have my badge within 10 minutes.

758
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,354
All right. Make sure you don't
get caught, that's all.

759
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,670
What? If you find something,
you've got a murderer,

760
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,876
and they don't care anything
about a couple of house rules.

761
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,031
If you don't find anything,
the fellow's clear.

762
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:59,512
At the risk of sounding stuffy, I'd
like to remind you of the Constitution

763
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,473
and the phrase, "Search
warrant issued by a judge

764
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,637
"who knows his Bill
of Rights verbatim."

765
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,279
He must ask for evidence.

766
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,714
Give him evidence.

767
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,511
Yeah, I can
hear myself.

768
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,639
"Your Honour, I have a friend
who's an amateur sleuth.

769
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,395
"Welll, the other night after
having a heavy dinner, he..."

770
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,915
He'd throw the New York State
penal code right in my face.

771
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,071
And there's
six volumes.

772
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,519
You know, by tomorrow morning there
may not be any evidence left

773
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,716
over in that apartment.
You know that.

774
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,110
It's a detective's
nightmare.

775
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,909
What do you need
before you can search?

776
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,195
Tell me. Now,
what do you need?

777
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,794
Bloody footsteps leading
up to the door?

778
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,510
One thing I don't need is heckling.
You called me and asked for help.

779
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,154
Now you're behaving

each other in that plane

for three years
during the war?

782
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,318
I guess I'll go over to the railroad
station and check on Thorwald's story.

783
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,073
Oh, forget
about the story.

784
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,834
Find the trunk.
Mrs. Thorwald's in it.

785
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,435
Oh, I almost forgot.

786
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,876
There was a postcard in
Thorwald's mailbox. It was

787
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,159
mailed 3:30 yesterday
afternoon from Merritsville.

788
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,311
That's 80 miles
north of here.

789
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,189
Message went, "Arrived okay.
Already feeling better.

790
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,714
"Love, Anna."

Anna... Is that
who I think it is?

794
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,199
Mrs. Thorwald.

you need, Jeff?

Oh, well, I just sort of...
Take a look at Thorwald.

01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:29,030
He's getting ready to pull out for good.
Look at him.

841
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,992
He doesn't seem
to be in any hurry.

842
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,549
He's been laying out all his
things on one of the beds.

843
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,910
Shirts, suits,
coats, socks.

844
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,116
Even his wife's...
That alligator handbag

845
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,550
his wife had on the bedpost.
What about it?

846
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,359
He had it hidden in the dresser.
At least, it was there.

847
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,394
He took it out, went to the telephone
and made a long-distance call.

848
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,154
He had his wife's
jewelry in the handbag.

849
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,310
Seemed worried
about it.

850
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,152
Asked somebody's advice
over the telephone.

851
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,873
Someone not his wife.

852
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,156
Well, I never saw
him ask her for advice.

853
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,074
She volunteered plenty, but I
never saw him ask her for any.

854
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,839
I wonder where
he's going.

855
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,240
I don't know.

856
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,718
Suppose he doesn't
come back again?

857
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,394
He'll be back. His
things are still there.

858
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,551
Well, I guess it's safe
to put on some lights now.

01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,119
No, not yet!

860
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:38,557
Okay, you can turn it on now. He must
have gone someplace to the right.

861
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,991
All day long, I've been trying
to keep my mind on my work.

862
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,713

863
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,996
And you and your
friend, Doyle.

864
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,471
Did you hear from him
again, since he left?

865
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,550
Not a word.

866
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,234
He said he was gonna check the
railroad station and the trunk.

867
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,197
He must be
still at it.

868
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,837
Something on
your mind?

869
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,079
It doesn't make
sense to me.

01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,198
Well, I can't guess
what you're thinking.

874
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,669
A woman has a
favourite handbag

875
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,879
and it always hangs on her bedpost,
where she can get at it easily.

876
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,954
And then, all of a sudden, she goes away
on a trip and leaves it behind. Why?

877
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,713
Because she didn't know
she was going on a trip.

878
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,791
And where she's going, she
wouldn't need the handbag.

879
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,759
Yes, but only her husband
would know that.

880
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,269
And that jewelry.

881
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,158
Women don't keep their
jewelry in a purse

882
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,709
getting all twisted and
scratched and tangled up.

883
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,393
Well, do they hide it in
their husband's clothes?

884
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,073
They do not.

885
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,879
And they don't leave it
behind, either.

886
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,317
Why, a woman going
anywhere but the hospital

887
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,392
would always take makeup,
perfume and jewelry.

888
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,877
Put that over there.
That's inside stuff, huh?

889
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,598
It's basic
equipment.

890
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,559
And you don't leave it behind
in your husband's drawer

891
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,074
in your favourite handbag.

892
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,470
Well, I'm with you,
sweetie. I'm with you.

893
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,517
Tom Doyle has a pat
answer for that, though.

894
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,557
That Mrs. Thorwald
left at 6:00 a.m.

895
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,710
yesterday with
her husband?

896
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,473
According to
those witnesses.

897
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,790
Well, I have a pat
rebuttal for Mr. Doyle.

898
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,714
That couldn't have been Mrs.
Thorwald, or I don't know women.

899
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,837
What about
the witnesses?

900
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,190
We'll agree they
saw a woman,

901
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,996
but she was not
Mrs. Thorwald.

902
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,636
That is, not yet.

903
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:21,750
Is that so?

904
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,319
Come here.

905
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,151
I'd like to see your friend's
face when we tell him.

906
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,470
He doesn't sound like
much of a detective.

907
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,996
Oh, don't be too hard on him.
He's a steady worker.

908
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,596
I sure wish
he'd show up.

909
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,274
Don't rush him.
We have all night.

910
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,877
We have all what?
Night.

911
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,590
I'm going to
stay with you.

912
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,837
Well,you will have to clear
that with my landlord.

913
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,950
I have the whole
weekend off.

914
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,833
That's very nice, but
I just have one bed.

915
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,150
If you say anything else, I'll
stay tomorrow night, too.

916
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,118
I won't be able to
give you any pajamas.

917
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,678
You said I'll have to
live out of one suitcase.

918
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,077
I'll bet yours
isn't this small.

919
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,793
This is a suitcase?

to write a song like that?

creating difficult situations.

Jewelry?

978
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,196
He's got his wife's jewelry hidden in
his clothes in the bedroom over there.

979
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,435
You sure it belonged
to his wife?

It was in her
favoutite handbag.

981
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,314
Mr. Doyle, that can only
lead to one conclusion.

982
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,435
Namely?

983
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:44,479
That it was not Mrs. Thorwald that
left with him yesterday morning.

984

You figured
that out, eh?

985
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,515
Well, it's simply that women
don't leave their jewelry behind

when they go
on a trip.

Come on, come on, Tom.

988
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,595
Now you don't really need any
of this information, do you?

989
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,756
As a matter
of fact, I don't.

Lars Thorwald is no more
a murderer than I am.

991
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,520
You mean to say you can explain
everything that's gone on over there,

992
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,874
and is still
going on?

No, neither
can you.

That's a secret, private world
you're looking into out there.

People do a lot of things in private they
couldn't possibly explain in public.

996
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,957
Like disposing
of their wives?

997
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,759
You get that idea out of your mind.
It'll only lead in the wrong direction.

998
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,315
What about the
knife and the saw?

999

Did you ever
own a saw?

1000
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,754
Well, at home in
the garage I had...

1001
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,116
How many people
did you cut up with it?

1002
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:47,637
Or with the couple of hundred knives
you've probably owned in your lifetime?

1003
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,033
Well, your logic
is backward.

1004

You can't ignore the wife disappearing
and the trunk and the jewelry.

He bought a ticket.

1006

Ten minutes later, he put
his wife on a train.

1007
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,078
Destination, Merritsville.
The witnesses are that deep.

1008
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,238
That might have been a woman, but it
couldn't have been Mrs. Thorvvald.

Look, Miss Fremont.

1010

That feminine intuition
stuff sells magazines.

1011
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,758
But in real life,
it's still a fairy tale.

on female intuition.

1014
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,960
All right. I take it you
didn't find the trunk,

1015
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:23,510
and all this is from an old speech you
once made at the Policemen's Ball.

1016
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,109
I found the trunk a half-hour
after I left here.

1017
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,875
I suppose it's normal for a man to
tie up a trunk with heavy rope?

1018
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,951
Well, if the lock
is broken, yes.

1019
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,158
And what did you find inside the trunk?
A surly note to me?

1020
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,356
Mrs. Thorwald's clothes.

1021
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,831
Clean, well packed.
Not stylish, but presentable.

1022
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,752
Didn't you take them
off to the crime lab?

1023

I sent them on their
merry and legal way.

1024

Why, when a woman is taking
a simple, short trip,

1025
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,591
does she take
everything she owns?

1026
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,389
Let's let the female psychology
department handle that one.

1027
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,829
I would say it looked as
if she wasn't coming back.

1028
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,593
That's what's known
as a family problem.

1029
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,513
And if she wasn't coming back,
why didn't he tell his landlord?

1030
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:07,390
I'll tell you why he didn't tell his
landlord. Because he was hiding something.

1031
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,989
Do you tell your
landlord everything?

1032
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,798
I told you to
be careful, Tom.

1033

Look, if I'd have been careful piloting
that reconnaissance plane during the war,

1034

you wouldn't have had the
chance to take the pictures

1035

good job, and fame and money.

good old days during the war.

with the case?

through with, Miss Fremont.

you're right.

01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,713
Of course, they can
do the same thing to me.

1073
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,270
Watch me like a bug under
a glass, if they want to.

1074
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,876
Jeff, you know, if someone came in here,
they wouldn't believe what they'd see.

1075
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,950
What?

1076
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,235
You and me
with long faces.

1077
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,837
Plunged into despair because we find
out a man didn't kill his wife.

1078
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,390
We're two of the most frightening
ghouls I've ever known.

1079
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:37,429
You'd think we could be a little bit happy
that the poor woman is alive and well.

1080
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:43,316
Whatever happened to that old
saying, "Love thy neighbour"?

(JEFF CHUCKLES)

1082
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,356
You know, I think I'll start
reviving that tomorrow.

1083
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,995
Yeah, I'll begin
with Miss Torso.

1084
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:56,720
Not if I have to move into
an apartment across the way

1085
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,517
and do the Dance of the
Seven <i>Veils</i> every hour.

1086
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,471
Show's over
for tonight.

Preview of coming
attractions.

1088
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,034
Did Mr. Doyle think
I stole this case?

1089
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,399
No, Lisa, I don't
think he did.

1090
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,311
What do you think?

1091
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,390
Well...

1092
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,751
I will rephrase
the question.

1093
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,069
Thank you.

1094
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,753
Do you like it?

1095
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:50,914
Yes, I like it.

(CHATTERING)

1100
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,117
MAN 1: Somebody's hurt?
WOMAN 2: It's the dog.

1101
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,669
Something's happened to the dog.

1102
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,671
MAN 2: What's the trouble?
Somebody fall out a window?

1103
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,630
MAN 3: See, it's a dog
down there.

1104
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,954
It's dead.

1105
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:26,359
It's been strangled.
The neck is broken.

1106
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,998
Which one of
you did it?

1107
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,515
Which one of you
killed my dog?

1108
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,999
You don't know the meaning
of the word "neighbours."

1109
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:40,036
neighbours like each other,
speak to each other,

1110
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,470
care if anybody
lives or dies.

1111
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,952
But none of you do!

1112
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,349
But I couldn't imagine
any of you being so low

1113
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,831
that you'd kill a little
helpless, friendly dog.

1114
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,880
The only thing in this whole
neighbourhood who liked anybody.

1115
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,913
Did you kill him
because he liked you?

1116
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,150
Just because
he liked you?

1117
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,633
Let's go inside.

1118
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,713
Come on. Let's go back in.
It's only a dog.

1119
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,074
You know, for a minute, that Tom Doyle
almost had me convinced I was wrong.

1120
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,071
But you're not?
Look.

1121
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:48,358
In the whole courtyard, only one
person didn't come to the window.

1122
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,669
Look.

1123
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,431
Why would Thorwald want
to kill a little dog?

1124
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,311
Because it
knew too much?

1125
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:13,398
You think this is worth
waiting all day to see?

1126
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,433
LISA: Is he
cleaning house?

1127
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,114
He's washing down
the bathroom walls.

1128
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,235
Hmm.

1129
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,436
Must have splattered a lot.

1130
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,719
Well, why not? That's
what we're all thinking.

1131
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,633
He killed her in there, he has to clean
up those stains before he leaves.

1132
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,360
Oh, Stella, your
choice of words.

1133
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:34,871
STELLA: Nobody ever invented a
polite word for a killing yet.

1134
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,955
Lisa? Lisa, back there, on that shelf,
there's a little yellow box. You see it?

1135
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,792
Top one?
Right on top, yeah.

1136
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,394
Bring it. And bring
me the viewer there.

1137
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,839
I just got a...

1138
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:54,313
Now, these are
about two weeks old.

1139
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:58,075
I hope I took something else
besides leg art. Now which one...

1140
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,515
What are you looking for? Here.

1141
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,197
There's something, and if I'm right,
I think I've solved a murder.

1142
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,078
Mrs. Thorwald?
No.

1143
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,277
No, the dog.

1144
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,635
Uh-huh.

1145
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:14,712
I think I know why
Thorwald killed that dog.

1146
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:18,392
Here, now you take a look.
Tell me what you see.

1147
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,358
Now take it down.

1148
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,470
Now look again. Now take it down.
You see?

1149
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,160
But it's just a picture
of the backyard, that's all.

1150
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:32,234
One important change.
One important change.

1151
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,277
Those flowers in
Thorwald's pet flower bed.

1152
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,271
You mean where the dog
was sniffing around?

1153
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,830
Where the dog was digging.
Now look at those flowers.

1154
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,995
Look, right? Those two
yellow zinnias on this end

1155
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,912
aren't as tall
as they were.

1156
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,311
Now, since when do flowers
grow shorter in two weeks?

1157
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,879
There's something
buried there.

1158
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,678
Mrs. Thorwald.

1159
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:59,557
You haven't spent much time
around cemeteries, have you?

1160
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:02,678
Mr. Thorwald could scarcely
put his wife's body

1161
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,718
in a plot of ground
about one foot square.

1162
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,633
Unless, of course, he put
her in standing on end,

1163
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,439
and then he wouldn't
need a knife and saw.

1164
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:15,195
No, my idea is she's
scattered all over town.

1165
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,556
Leg in the East River...
Oh, Stella, please!

1166
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,074
No, no, no. There's
something in there.

1167
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,720
Those flowers have been
taken out and put back in.

1168
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,672
Maybe it's the knife and saw.
Yeah.

1169
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:24,835
Call Lieutenant Doyle.

1170
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,069
No, let's wait.

1171
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:29,915
Let's wait till it gets a little darker,
and I'll go over there and dig them up.

1172
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,994
You'll go? You won't dig anything
up and get your neck broken.

1173
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,278
No, no, we've...

1174
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:40,116
We're not gonna call Doyle until I
can produce Mrs. Thorwald's body.

1175
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,033
What we've got to do is find a
way to get into that apartment.

1176
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,599
He's packing.

1177
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:46,955
Uh-oh.

1178
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,350
Here, get me
a pencil.

1179
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,557
Stella, get me some note paper.
It's up here someplace.

1180
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,199
There it is.

1181
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,673
You did it, Thorwald.
You did it.

1182
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,790
Look out, Lisa.
He's coming.

1183
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,996
You never should have let her do it.
If he ever...

1184
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,354
Look. Look. Look.

1185
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,349
(SIGHS)

1186
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,715
Well, thank heaven
that's over.

1187
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:49,916
All right if I
have a drink?

1188
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,593
Sure, go ahead.

1189
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:04,074
There's no doubt about it. He's leaving.
It's just a question of when.

1190
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,800
Mind if I use that
portable keyhole?

1191
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:12,000
Go ahead, just as long <i>as</i> you
tell me what you're looking at.

1192
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:18,990
STELLA: I wonder...

1193
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,195
JEFF: Wonder what?

1194
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,157
Miss Lonelyheart's
just laid out something

1195
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,880
that looks like rhodium
tri-eckonal capsules.

1196
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,234
You can tell
from here?

1197
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,278
I've handled enough of those red
pills to put everybody in Hackensack

1198
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:30,674
to sleep for the winter.

1199
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,433
Well, does she have
enough of them to...

1200
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,511
No. It will make
the rest easy to...

1201
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,998
Wasn't that close?

1202
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,758
What was his reaction. I mean,
when he looked at the note?

1203
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:44,754
Well, it wasn't the kind of an expression
that would get him a quick loan at the bank.

1204
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,672
Jeff, the handbag!

1205
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,355
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's
wedding ring

1206
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,432
is among the jewelry
he has in that handbag?

1207
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,114
Now, during the phone conversation
he held up three rings.

1208
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:23,511
One with a diamond, one with
a big stone of some sort

1209
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,477
and then just
a plain gold band.

1210
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:29,633
And the last thing she would leave
behind would be a wedding ring.

1211
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,950
Stella, do you ever
leave yours at home?

1212
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:36,477
The only way anybody could get that
ring would be to chop off my finger.

1213
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:42,677
Let's go down and find out
what's buried in the garden.

1214
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:47,118
Why not? I've always wanted to meet Mrs.
Thorvvald.

1215
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,833
What are you two talking about?
You got a shovel?

1216
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,149
A shovel? Of course I
don't have a shovel.

1217
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,038
There's probably
one in the basement.

1218
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:54,157
Jeff, if you're
squeamish, just don%look.

1219
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,560
Squeamish?
I'm not squeamish.

1220
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:59,190
I just don't want you two to end up
like that dog ended up. That's all.

1221
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,511
Oh, you know, Miss Fremont, he
might just have something there.

1222
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,671
Just hold on.
Here, take this.

1223
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,115
No sense taking any
chances in this thing.

Here, give me
the phone book.

What for?

1226
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,557
Maybe I can get him
out of that apartment.

1227
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:16,153
We only need
a few minutes.

1228
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,958
I'll see if I can
get about 15 minutes.

We scared him once, maybe
we can scare him again.

1235
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,872
Well, I guess I'm using that
word "we" a little freely.

1236
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,917
I mean, you're taking
all the chances.

him in, Stella?

A little business

To settle the estate
of your late wife.

<i>I don't know
what you mean.</i>

Come on. Quit stalling, Thorwald, or
I'll hang up and call the police.

I'm at the Albert now.
I'll be looking for you.

Come on, Stella,

One of you keep an
eye on this window.

When do you
expect them in?

1271
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:24,151
<i>Well, I'm hired till 1:00. They went
to dinner and maybe a nightclub.</i>

I see.

1273
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:29,990
If he calls in, would you have him get
in touch with L.B. Jefferies right away?

1274
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,991
I might have quite
a surprise for him.

01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,993
<i>Well, do we have your number, Mr.
Jefferies?</i>

1276

Get out of there!

1283

She said ring Thorwald's phone the
second you see him come back.

1284
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,236
I'm gonna ring

get herself arrested.

is, he won't wait until his lease is up.

Your <i>Lisa?</i>
My Lisa.

1349
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:30,074
Boy, you should have seen her. She
got into Thorwald's apartment.

1350
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:33,312
But then he came back, and the only way I
could get her out was to call the police.

1351
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:35,038
<i>I told you...</i>
I <i>know you told me!</i>

1352
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:38,192
She went in to get evidence and
she came out with evidence.

1353
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:39,918
<i>Like what?
Like</i> what?

1354
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,913
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring.
That's like what.

1355
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,789
If that woman was alive, she'd
be wearing that ring. Right?

1356
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,997
<i>A possibility.</i> A <i>possibility.
It's</i> a <i>fact!</i>

1357
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:54,119
He killed a dog last night because the
dog was scratching around in the garden.

1358
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:58,353
You know why? Because he had something
buried in that garden that the dog scented.

1359
01:43:58,440 --> 01:43:59,555
<i>Like an old
ham bone?</i>

1360
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:02,712
Look, I don't know what pet names
Thorwald had for his wife,

1361
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,194
but I'll tell you this,

1362
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:07,511
all those trips at night
with that metal suitcase,

1363
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,238
he wasn't taking
out his possessions,

1364
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:12,756
because his possessions
are still up in the apartment.

1365
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,478
<i>Perhaps it was
old "ham bone."</i>

Yeah, in sections.

1367
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:17,634
And I'll tell you
something else.

1368
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:20,792
All the telephone calls he made
were long distance, all right?

1369
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,635
Now, if he called his wife long
distance on the day she left,

1370
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,916
after she arrived
in Merritsville,

1371
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,277
why did she write a card to him saying
that she'd arrived in Merritsville?

1372
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,192

I sent somebody over

won't need it.</i>

All right. All right.
Now hurry up, will you?

01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,352
This fellow knows
he's being watched.

1380

He's not gonna wait around forever.
Hurry up.

Your friend, the girl,

No.

Did he say what was
buried in the flower bed?

1417
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:25,919
Yeah. He said the dog got too
inquisitive, so he dug it up.

01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:29,353
It's in a hat box

No, thanks.
