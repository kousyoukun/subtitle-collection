175
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,138
以前的人只要见个面，觉得心动，就结婚

Now, it's read a lot of books,

难怪他写得这么费劲

如果你有难言之隐

I made a simple statement, a true statement,
也许我没说清楚，但那是事实

You don't think either one of us could ever change?

Right now it doesn't seem so.

397
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,990
I'd just like to be part of it somehow.
我只想成为你生活的一部分

398
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,990
It's deflating to find out...
真遗憾...

399
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:26,690
the only way I can be part of it is to take out a subscription to your magazine.
看来只能靠订阅你的杂志来了解你的工作了

400
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,890
I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
看来我没有想像中坚强

401
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:34,890
There's nothing wrong with you. You've got this town in the palm of your hand.
不是你的错，丽莎，你已经适应了这里的生活

402
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,690
Not quite, it seems.
不完全是

403
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,090
Good-bye, Jeff.
再见，杰夫

404
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,090
You mean good night.
你是说晚安

405
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,190
I mean what I said. 
不，是再见

406
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,537
Well, Lisa...
丽莎

407
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,890
couldn't we just...
为什么我们不能…

408
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:54,790
Couldn't we just... keep things status quo?
为什么我们不能维持现状呢？

409
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,890
Without any future?
不考虑将来？

410
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,090
Well, when am I gonna see you again?
几时能再见你？

411
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,990
Not for a long time.
不会太久

412
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:10,590
At least... not until tomorrow night.
至少在明晚之前

413
00:31:45,658 --> 00:31:48,660
[女人尖叫，摔杯子的声音]

414
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,790
Hey, rain.
下雨了

415
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,690
Wait, I'll get the clock. Oh, no.
等等，还有闹钟，噢，见鬼

416
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,690
Pull it...
拉一下

417
00:32:32,354 --> 00:32:33,314


418
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,490
In you go.
快进去

419
00:32:36,857 --> 00:32:37,982
噢…

420
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:17,007
[01:55]

421
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:21,301
[02:35]

422
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,390
You can't come in. It's much too late.
你不能进来，太晚了

423
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,690
No, not now.
不，现在不行

424
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,690
No, I said good night.
不，我说：“晚安”了

425
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,390
What's that supposed to be, ma'am?
那是什么？夫人

426
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,390
It's called "Hunger."
我叫它“饥饿”

427
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,590
You'd think the rain would have cooled things off.
你以为下雨后会降温？

428
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,390
- All it did was make the heat wet. - That's it, that's it.
- 只会变得更闷热 - 就是那儿

429
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,690
That's stiff right there. Right there.
就是那儿酸痛

430
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,890
The insurance company would be much happier...
保险公司会很高兴的

431
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,090
if you'd sleep in bed at night instead of in that wheelchair.
如果你每晚睡在床上，而不是在轮椅上

432
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,690
- How do you know? - Eyes are all bloodshot.
- 你怎么知道的？ - 你满眼都是血丝

433
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:29,190
- Must have been watching out that window for hours. - Yeah, I was.
- 一定是盯着窗外看了好几个钟头 - 的确

434
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,390
What are you gonna do if one of them catches you?
要是被人发现了怎么办？

435
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,990
It depends which one. Miss Torso, for example...
那得看是谁发现了，如果是多索小姐…

436
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,190
You keep your mind off her.
别乱想了

437
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,990
She sure is the "eat, drink and be merry" girl.
她肯定是个及时行乐的人

438
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,390
Yeah, she'll wind up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
对，酗酒、发胖，最后晚景凄凉

439
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,390
Yeah.
可能吧

440
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,890
Speaking of misery, poor Miss Lonelyhearts...
说到凄凉，可怜的单身小姐，

441
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,890
She drank herself to sleep again, alone.
她又一个人喝到睡着

442
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:54,490
Poor soul. Maybe one day she'll find her happiness.
可怜人，有一天她会找到幸福的

443
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,090
Yeah, and some man will lose his.
对，不知道谁这么倒霉

444
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,790
Isn't there anybody in the neighborhood who could cast an eye in her direction?
附近有人适合她吗？

445
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,790
I don't know.
不知道

446
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,090
It might be that the salesman will be available soon.
那个推销员可能会

447
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,190
Oh, him and his wife splitting up?
跟他妻子闹翻的那个？

448
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,190
I just can't figure it.
我不太明白

449
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,390
He went out several times last night in the rain,
昨晚下雨时他出去了好几次

450
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,490
carrying his sample case.
带着他的推销箱子

451
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,390
- He's a salesman, isn't he? - What would he be selling at 3:00 in the morning?
- 他是个推销员，不是吗？ - 早上三点出去推销什么？

452
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,890
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches.
手电筒、夜光手表

453
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,090
House numbers that light up.
能发光的门牌号码

454
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,890
I don't think so. I don't think so.
我看不像

455
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,590
I think he was taking something out of the apartment.
我看他是在往外搬东西

456
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:34,890
Uh-huh. His personal effects.
那是他自己的事

457
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,390
He's gonna run out on her, the coward.
他想抛弃她，这个懦夫

458
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,390
Yeah. Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
走为上策

459
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:47,890
Yeah, well, it takes a particularly low type of man to do a thing like that.
没种的男人才那样

460
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,390
How about this morning?
今天早上怎么样？

461
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,190
- Any further developments? - No.
- 有什么进展吗？ - 没有

462
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,390
The shades are all drawn in the apartment.
他们的窗帘一直拉着

463
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,990
- In this heat? - Yeah.

464
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,090
They're up now.
可是，现在打开了

465
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:08,290
- Get back, get back. - Where do you want me to go?
- 退后，退后 - 去哪儿？

466
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,790
- Get out of sight. Get out of sight. - What's the matter?
- 怎么啦？ - 别让他看见

467
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,190
The salesman's looking out of his window. You see?
那家伙在看窗外，你瞧

468
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:17,890
- Get back. He'll see you. - I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
- 退后，他会看见你的 - 我又不害羞，我经常被人看

469
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,190
That's no ordinary look.
他的表情很怪

470
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,590
That's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching.
只有担心别人发现自己的秘密，才会有这种表情

471
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,090
Get away from there. Get away from there.
走开，走开，

472
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,690
He'll be after you. Go on, into the house.
他会来抓你的，进屋去，

473
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,890
Into the house. Shoo, shoo.
进屋去，唏，唏…

474
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,190
Good-bye, Mr. Jefferies. See you tomorrow.
再见，杰弗利先生，明天见

475
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,590
Uh-huh.

476
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,095
And don't sleep in that chair again. 
别再睡在轮椅上了

477
00:40:05,095 --> 00:40:06,054
Uh-huh.

00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,390
"Uh-huh. Uh-huh." Great conversationalist.

479
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:14,190
Stella...
斯泰拉

480
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:14,290


481
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:18,590
take those binoculars out and bring them here, will you?
把望远镜拿给我，好吗？

482
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,890
Trouble.
麻烦，

483
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,190
I can smell it.
我闻到了

484
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,390
I'll be glad when they crack that cast, and I can get outta here.
真希望你早点拆石膏，我就不用再来了

485
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,390
Uh-huh.
嗯哈

486
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:06,790
How far does a girl have to go before you'll notice her?
一个女孩要怎样做才能让你动心？

只要她足够漂亮，什么也不用做

488
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,290

Well, ain't I? Pay attention to me.
我不够吗？注意一下我吧

490
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:23,090
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
这样还不够注意吗？

491
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:28,590
Your mind is... and when I want a man, I want all of him.
我还要你的心，我要你的全部

492
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:35,090
Don't you ever have any problems?

So do I.

498
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,290
on a rainy night with a suitcase...

499
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,890
and come back three times?

He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.

501
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,090
No, no. No, no.
不，不… 

502
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,190
No, no. Not this salesman's wife.
推销员的妻子可不会

503
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,390
And why didn't he go to work today?
为什么他今天不去工作？

504
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:08,990
Homework. It's more interesting.

505
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:13,790
What's interesting about a butcher knife...

and a small saw...
还有一把锯子

507
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:18,990
wrapped in newspaper?
用报纸包着，嗯？

508
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,490
Nothing, thank heaven.
但愿没什么

Well, listen. I'll answer it, Lisa.
我来回答，

512
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,790
There's something terribly wrong.
一定发生了什么可怕的事

513
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:40,490
- And I'm afraid it's with me. - What do you think?
- 恐怕是发生在我身上了 [指杰夫心不在焉] - 你认为呢？

514
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:45,190
Something too frightful to utter.
我不想谈论恐怖的事

515

He went out a few minutes ago in his undershirt, hasn't come back.
他几分钟前穿着汗衫出去了，现在还没回来

516
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:05,490
That would be a terriblejob.
那可不是件容易处理的事

517
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:14,090
Just how would you start to cut up a human body?
如果要你分尸，你会从哪下手？

00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:20,690
Jeff, I'll be honest with you. You're beginning to scare me.
杰夫，说实话，你开始吓着我了

Jeff, did you hear what I said?
杰夫，你听见了吗？

- 你开始吓着… -唏，唏，他回来了…

- Jeff, if you could only see yourself! - What's the matter?
- 杰夫，管好你自己吧 - 怎么啦？

522
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:03,190
Sitting around looking out of the window to kill time is one thing,
看窗外消磨时间是一回事

523
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,890
but doing it the way you are with binoculars...
但像你这样用望远镜偷窥

524
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:10,090
and wild opinions about every little thing you see is diseased!
而且满脑子胡思乱想是变态

525
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,790
Do you think I consider it recreation?

526
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,790
I don't know what you consider it,
我不管你叫它什么

527
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:17,090
but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
如果你不停止，我马上就走 

528
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,590
- What's the... - What is it you're looking for?
- 为什么？ - 你到底在看什么？

529
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,290
I just want to find out what's the matter with the salesman's wife.
我只想知道推销员的妻子怎么了

530
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,290
Does that make me sound like a madman?
这有何不对？

531
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,790
- What makes you think there's something the matter with her? - A lot of things.
- 你怎么知道她出事了？ - 太不正常了

532
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:29,690
She's an invalid. She demands constant care.
她有病在身，需要人贴身照顾

533
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:33,290
Yet not the husband or anybody else has been in to see her all day. Why?
可一整天来，没人去过她的房间，为什么？

534
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,190
Maybe she died. 
也许她病故了

535
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,690
Where's the doctor?
怎么没看见医生，

536
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,790
Where's the undertaker?
还有殡仪馆的人呢？

537
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,790
She could be sleeping, under sedatives.
她可能服了镇静剂，睡着了

538
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:45,690
He's in there now. There's nothing to see.
他回来了，没什么可看的

539
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,490
There is something. I've seen it through that window.
有，我都从窗户里看见了

540
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:50,790
I've seen bickering and family quarrels...
我看到他们争吵，

541
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:52,790
and mysterious trips at night...
丈夫午夜外出，

542
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,790
and knives and saws and rope.
还有刀、锯和绳子

543
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:57,990
Now, since last evening, not a sign of the wife. Tell me where she is.
而妻子却从此不见踪影，你说她在哪？

544
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,990
- I don't know. - What's she doing? Where is she?
- 我不知道 - 她在干嘛，她在哪？

545
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,990
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know. I don't care!
也许他们分居了，我不知道，我不管

546
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:06,290
Lots of people have knives and saws and ropes around their houses.
很多人家里有刀、锯和绳子

547
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:09,190
And lots of men don't speak to their wives all day.
而且很多丈夫整天都不与妻子讲话

548
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,890
Lots of wives nag and men hate them and trouble starts,
很多妻子唠叨，丈夫心烦，所以吵架

549
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:15,690
but few of them end up in murder, if that's what you're thinking.
但没人会因此杀人，别胡思乱想了

550
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,690
It's pretty hard for you to keep away from that word, isn't it?
看，你也想到谋杀了，不是吗？

551
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,090
You could see all that he did, couldn't you?
你看到了他所做的一切，对吗？

552
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,190
- Of course, I... - You could see because the shades were up...
- 当然你看到了，我... - 因为窗帘是开着的

553
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,390
and he walked along the corridor and the street and the backyard.
而且你看到他在走廊、后院和街上的活动

554
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:30,990
- I've seen him... - Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that?
杰夫，你觉得凶手会让你看到这些吗？

555
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,490
- That he wouldn't pull the shades and hide behind them? - He's being clever.
- 难道他不知道拉上窗帘，掩人耳目？ - 这正是他聪明的地方

556
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,990
- He's being nonchalant. - And that's where you're not being clever.
- 他装作若无其事… - 这正是你糊涂的地方

557
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:42,790
- A murderer would never parade his crime in front of an open window. - Why not?
- 凶手绝不会开窗炫耀犯罪过程 - 为何不可？

558
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:46,690
For all you know, there's something sinister going on.
照你的说法，那扇窗子里也有人在犯罪？

559
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,790
Where? Oh.
哪儿？噢

560
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,890
No comment.
我不知道

561
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,390
Let's start from the beginning again, Jeff.
从头再说一遍，杰夫

562
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,690
Tell me everything you saw...
告诉我你看到的一切

563
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,890
and what you think it means.
和你对整件事的看法

564
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:39,390
Yeah?
喂

565
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,390
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads...
二楼邮箱的名字是

566
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:44,590
"Mr. and Mrs. Lars..."
拉兹先生和太太

567
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,890
That's L-a-r-s. "Lars Thorwald."
拉兹.索沃德

568
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,890
What's the number of the apartment?
门牌号码是多少？

569
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:54,090
125 W. Ninth Street.
西九大街125号

570
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,090
Thank you, dear.
谢谢，亲爱的

571
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,190
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment?
好的，长官，下一个任务是什么？

572
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,190
Just go home.
回家去

573
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,590
All right, but what's he doing now?
好的，现在他在干什么？

574
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:07,590
He's just sitting in the living room in the dark.
他坐这黑暗的客厅里

575
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,690
Hasn't gone near the bedroom.
还没靠近过卧室

576
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:13,090
Now you go home and get some sleep. Good night.
你回去休息吧，晚安

577
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,190
Good night.
晚安

578
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:28,690
- What's it all about, Jeff? - Look, Doyle, I can't tell you over the telephone.
- 什么事？杰夫 - 瞧，多尤，这事不能在电话里谈

579
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:31,290
- You have to be here and see the whole setup. - Important?
- 你得过来亲眼看看 - 很重要吗？

580
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,390
It's probably nothing important at all.
可能什么都不是

581
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,490
It's just a little neighborhood murder.
可能是个谋杀案

582
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,490
- Did you say, "murder?" - Yes, as a matter of fact, I did say murder.
- 你是说“谋杀”？- 是，我是说“谋杀”

583
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:42,990
- Come now. - My only thought was throwing a little business your way.
- 噢，别逗了 - 我只想帮你的忙

584
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,190
I figured a detective would jump at the chance of something to detect.
我想一个称职的侦探不会放过任何机会

585
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,190
- I'm not working. - What?
- 我下班了 - 什么？

586
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:50,190
This happens to be my day off.
我今天休息

587
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:53,690
- I usually took my best pictures on my day off. - I'll drop by.
- 我最好的照片都是休息时拍的 - 我会来的

588
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,190
Okay, Doyle. As soon as you can.
好的，多尤，快点

589
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:59,690
Bless your heart, Stella.
太谢谢你了，斯泰拉

590
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,790
Gee whiz, look at this.
啧，啧，瞧瞧

591
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,190
I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is.
这真是太棒了！

592
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,790
- No wonder your husband still loves you. - The police?
- 难怪你丈夫还爱你 - 警察？

593
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,790
What? You called the police?
什么？你打电话给警察了？

594
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:10,890
Not exactly. Not exactly.
不完全是.不完全是

595
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:14,590
Not an official call. It's an old friend of mine.
不算正式报警，他是我的朋友

596
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:17,090
An old, ornery friend of mine.
一个普通的老朋友

597
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:21,090
Just where do you suppose he cut her up?
你认为他会在哪儿分尸？

598
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:25,190
Of course. The bathtub.
当然，是在浴缸里

599
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,890
That's the only place where he could have washed away the blood.
只有在那，他才能洗去血迹

600
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:41,990
He better get that trunk out of there before it starts to leak.
他最好在血流出来之前，把那箱子弄走

601
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,690
Harry?
哈利？

602
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:12,590
Look, look, Mr. Jefferies.
瞧，瞧，杰弗利先生

603
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,090
I thought Doyle would be here...
早知道多尤赶不过来

604
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:53,990
by the time the trunk left, or I'd have called the police.
我该报警的，现在全完了

605
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:56,090
- Now we're gonna lose it. - Hold everything.
- 别急 - 别干傻事

606
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:59,090
Don't do anything foolish. I'm just gonna get the name off that freight truck.
我去看看搬运车的车牌

607
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:01,990
I'll keep an eye on the alley.
我会盯着小巷

608
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,290
Long distance.
长途电话

609
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,090
You didn't see the killing or the body. 
你没看到杀人或尸体

610
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,566
How do you know there was a murder?
怎么知道是谋杀？

611
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:48,490
Everything this fellow's done has been suspicious:
因为他行迹可疑

612
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:52,090
trips at night in the rain, knives and saws and trunks with rope,
雨夜外出，还有刀、锯和用绳子捆绑的箱子

613
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,290
and now this wife that isn't there anymore.
而现在妻子又不见了

614
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:57,092
I admit it all has a mysterious sound.
我得承认是有点可疑

615
00:53:57,217 --> 00:54:00,595
It could be any number of things. Murder's the least possible.
但有许多可能性，不一定是谋杀

616
00:54:00,721 --> 00:54:03,139
Doyle, don't tell me he's an unemployed magician,
噢，多尤，别告诉我他是个失业的魔术师

617
00:54:03,223 --> 00:54:05,141
amusing the neighborhood with his sleight of hand.
用他的技巧取悦邻居

618
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:08,519
- Don't tell me that. - It's too obvious and stupid a way to commit murder.
- 我才不信 - 这样杀人太明目张胆了

619
00:54:08,603 --> 00:54:10,521
In full view of 50 windows?
在50个窗口的注视下？

620
00:54:10,605 --> 00:54:13,149
Then sit there smoking a cigar, waiting for the police to come and pick him up?
然后坐下来抽雪茄，等警察来抓他

621
00:54:13,232 --> 00:54:15,859
All right, officer, do your duty. Go over and pick him up.
好吧，警官，尽你的职责，去抓他吧

622
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:18,820
Jeff, you've got a lot to learn about homicide.
杰夫，你太不了解杀人犯了

623
00:54:18,946 --> 00:54:21,406
Morons have committed murder so shrewdly...
为了抓住杀人犯摩伦

624
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:24,409
it's taken a hundred trained police minds to catch them.
我们动用了超过100个训练有素的警察

625
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:27,412
That salesman wouldn't just knock his wife off after dinner...
那推销员不会在晚饭后打昏妻子

626
00:54:27,537 --> 00:54:29,914
and toss her in the trunk and put her in storage.
把她扔进箱子藏起来

627
00:54:29,914 --> 00:54:31,887
I'll bet it's been done. 
我打赌他已经这么做了

628
00:54:31,887 --> 00:54:34,668
Most everything's been done, under panic.
所有凶手做案后都会惊慌失措

629
00:54:34,668 --> 00:54:37,046
This is a thousand-to-one shot.
例外的概率只有千分之一

630
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:39,673
He's still sitting around the apartment. That man's not panicked.
可他还坐着那，一点儿也不惊慌

631
00:54:40,173 --> 00:54:42,884
You think I made all this up?
你觉得这都是我编的？

632
00:54:42,968 --> 00:54:44,844
Well, I think you saw something...
我觉得你所看到的一切

633
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:47,263
there's probably a very simple explanation for.
很容易解释

634
00:54:47,263 --> 00:54:50,474
- For instance? - Wife took a trip.
-比方说？ -妻子去旅行了

635
00:54:50,558 --> 00:54:52,476
His wife was sick in bed.
他妻子有病在床

636
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:56,772
Yeah, so you told me.
对，你说过

637
00:54:56,855 --> 00:55:00,067
Well, Jeff, I've got to run along.
呃，杰夫，我得走了

638
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,570
I won't report this to the department.
我不会向上面报告

639
00:55:03,653 --> 00:55:06,489
Let me poke into it a little on my own.
我会私下调查一下

640
00:55:06,489 --> 00:55:10,910
- No sense in your getting a lot of ridiculous publicity. - Thank you.
- 免得你又写些荒唐报道 - 多谢

641
00:55:12,286 --> 00:55:14,413
We know the wife is gone.
他妻子不见了

642
00:55:14,413 --> 00:55:17,708
- I'll see if I can find out where. - Do that.
- 看能不能找到她 - 一定要找

643
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:21,002
You had any headaches lately?
你最近有头痛吗？

644
00:55:21,086 --> 00:55:22,585
Not until you showed up. 
见到你之后才有

645
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:25,712
It will wear off, along with the hallucinations.
会好的，等你的幻觉消失后

646
00:55:25,965 --> 00:55:27,967
See you around.
再见

647
00:55:52,198 --> 00:55:55,409
Get along.
去吧

648
00:56:15,636 --> 00:56:19,973
He has a six months' lease. Used up a little more than five and a half months of it.
他的公寓租期六个月，已经住五个半月了

649
00:56:19,973 --> 00:56:22,767
He's quiet, drinks, but not to drunkenness.
不太健谈，喝酒，但从不喝醉

650
00:56:22,767 --> 00:56:27,146

准时付账，靠推销和批发人造珠宝为生

651
00:56:27,272 --> 00:56:30,358
Kept to himself. No neighbors got close to him or his wife.
不太交际，邻居与他和他妻子接触不多

652
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:32,360
Yeah, well, I think they missed their chance with her.
我想他们再也没机会和她接触了

653
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:35,362
- She never left the apartment, until yesterday morning. - Where is she...
- 她很少离家，不过昨天早上离开了 - 她在哪儿？

654
00:56:35,487 --> 00:56:37,739
- What time? - 6:00 a.m.
- 什么时间？ - 早上六点

655
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:40,158
6:00 a.m.
早上6:00

656
00:56:40,158 --> 00:56:43,286
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
我猜我正好睡着了

657
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:47,665
Too bad. Thorwalds were leaving their apartment at just that time.
太糟了，当时索沃德夫妇正离开

658
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:51,794
Feel a little foolish?
觉得自己有点傻？

659
00:56:51,877 --> 00:56:53,796
Oh, not yet.
还没有

660
00:57:04,264 --> 00:57:06,182
How's your wife?
你妻子还好吗？

661
00:57:06,266 --> 00:57:08,601
Oh, she's fine.
噢，她很好

662
00:57:11,312 --> 00:57:13,314
Who said they left then?
谁说他们那时离开了？

663
00:57:13,439 --> 00:57:17,734
- W-Who left where? - The Thorwalds at 6:00 in the morning.
- 谁，离开哪？ - 索沃德夫妇，早上六点

664
00:57:17,943 --> 00:57:20,028
Oh, the building superintendent and two tenants.
噢，大厦管理员和两个房客

665
00:57:20,153 --> 00:57:23,740
Flat statements, no hesitation. They jibe to the letter.
而且脱口而出，说法完全一致

666
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,289
Thorwalds were on their way to the railroad station.
他们去了火车站

668
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:29,829
Well now, Tom, how could anybody possibly guess that?
汤姆，人们怎会那样猜想？

669
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:33,082
What, did they have signs on their luggage saying, "Grand Central or bust?"
难道他们行李上写着去火车站吗？

670
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:36,794
The superintendent met Thorwald on his way back.
管理员在他回来时碰上他了

671
00:57:36,794 --> 00:57:39,921
Thorwald told him that he'd put his wife on a train to the country.
他说送妻子去了乡下

672
00:57:40,005 --> 00:57:43,216
I see. I'd say this is a pretty convenient guy, this superintendent.
我明白了，这个管理员可真容易利用

673
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:48,346
Have you checked his bank statements lately? - Huh?
- 有查过他最近的银行帐户吗？- 啊？

674
00:57:48,346 --> 00:57:48,446


675
00:57:48,446 --> 00:57:51,349
Well, what good's his information?
这些消息有什么用？

676
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:55,561
It's a secondhand version of an unsupported story by the murderer himself.
都是凶手编造的对自己有利的二手信息

677
00:57:55,644 --> 00:57:59,147
Now did anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
有人看到他妻子上火车了吗？

678
00:57:59,147 --> 00:58:03,318
I hate to remind you, but this all started because you said she was murdered.
我得提醒你，你说她被害了

679
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,738
Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
但有任何人，包括你在内看到她被害了吗？

680
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:08,948
What are you doing?
你…你在干什么？

681
00:58:09,073 --> 00:58:12,451
Are you interested in solving this case or in making me look foolish?
你到底是想破这个案子，还是想嘲笑我？

682
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:15,162
Well, if possible, both.
呃，可能二者兼有之

683
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:18,832
Then do a good job of it. Go over there and search Thorwald's apartment.
那么动手吧，去搜搜他的公寓

684
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:22,252
- It must be knee-deep in evidence. - I can't do that.
- 肯定会有确凿的证据 - 我做不到

685
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:25,004
I don't mean right now, but when he goes out for a drink or a paper.
我不是说现在，等他出去喝酒或买报时候

686
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,131
What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
对他也没坏处

687
00:58:27,131 --> 00:58:29,133
I can't do that even if he isn't there.
他不在时也不行

688
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:31,344
What's he...


689
00:58:31,427 --> 00:58:34,346
Does he have a courtesy card from the police department or something?
难道他有警察局的优待券吗？

690
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:36,557
Now don't get me mad.
你快让我发疯了

691
00:58:36,557 --> 00:58:39,601
Not even a detective can walk into an apartment and search it.
即使探长也不能随便搜查别人的公寓

692
00:58:39,685 --> 00:58:42,771
If I were caught in there, they'd have my badge within ten minutes.
如果我被发现，十分钟内就会被撤职

693
00:58:42,854 --> 00:58:45,148
Make sure you don't get caught, that's all.
那就别让人发现

694
00:58:45,148 --> 00:58:49,902
If you find something, you've got a murderer, and they don't care anything about house rules.
如果找到证据，你就抓到一个凶手，他们才不在乎搜查的事呢

695
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,029
If you don't find anything, the fellow's clear.
如果没找到，那人就是清白的

696
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:57,826
At the risk of sounding stuffy, I'd like to remind you of the Constitution...
虽然很乏味，但我还是要提醒你宪法规定...

697
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:57,827


698
00:58:57,837 --> 00:59:01,663
and the phrase, "search warrant issued by a judge" who knows his Bill of Rights verbatim.
只有法官有权派发搜查令

699
00:59:01,763 --> 00:59:03,166
He must ask for evidence. 
他必须要有证据

700
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:06,776
Give him evidence.
给他证据

701
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,836
Yeah, I can hear myself,
像这样？

702
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:13,299
"Your Honor, I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth.
“大人，我有个朋友是业余侦探”

703
00:59:13,382 --> 00:59:16,677
The other night, after having a heavy dinner, he..."
“一天晚饭吃多了，

704
00:59:16,677 --> 00:59:21,723
He'd throw the New York State penal code in my face, and it's six volumes.
他说纽约州的刑法是狗屁”

705
00:59:21,807 --> 00:59:26,436
By tomorrow morning, there may not be any evidence left over in that apartment.
你知道，到明天早上，可能什么证据都不剩了

706
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:29,122
- You know that. - It's a detective's nightmare.
- 你明白的 - 那是侦探的噩梦

708
00:59:29,122 --> 00:59:33,025
What do you need before you can search?
到底要怎么样，你才肯去搜查？

709
00:59:33,025 --> 00:59:36,695
Tell me now, what do you need? Bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
告诉我，要怎么样，一定要鲜血四溅吗？

710
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,615
One thing I don't need is heckling. You called me and asked for help.
我不想被质问，是你打电话找我帮忙

711
00:59:40,741 --> 00:59:43,326
Now you're behaving like a taxpayer.
现在却苛刻得像个纳税人

712
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:47,580
How did we ever stand each other in that plane for three years during the war?
在战争中，我们怎么在那架飞机上彼此忍受三年的？

713
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:53,586
I guess I'll go over to the railroad station, check on Thorwald's story.
我还是去火车站看看得了

714
00:59:53,711 --> 00:59:57,673
Forget about the story. Find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it.
算了吧，去找那箱子，索沃德太太在里面

715
00:59:57,798 --> 01:00:02,177
Oh, I almost forgot. There was a postcard in Thorwald's mailbox.
差点忘了，他家的信箱中有封明信片

716
01:00:02,302 --> 01:00:06,097
It was mailed 3:30 yesterday afternoon from Merritsville.
是昨天下午3:30从梅利斯维尔寄来的

717
01:00:06,222 --> 01:00:08,099
That's 80 miles north of here.
离这儿有80英里远

718
01:00:08,224 --> 01:00:10,601
The message went: "Arrived okay.
上面说：“安全到达，

719
01:00:10,726 --> 01:00:15,231
Already feeling better. Love, Anna."
觉得好多了，爱你的安娜”

720
01:00:16,732 --> 01:00:19,985
Uh... is that, um...
安娜，就是，是…

721
01:00:20,068 --> 01:00:22,571
Anna... Is that who I think it is?
额...是像我认为的那样吗？

722
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:26,366
- Mrs. Thorwald. - Uh-huh.
- 索沃德太太

723
01:00:28,493 --> 01:00:30,661
Oh, so anything you need, Jeff?
哦，你还需要什么吗，杰夫？

724
01:00:30,786 --> 01:00:33,289
You might send me a good detective.
你最好送个好探长来

725
01:02:33,107 --> 01:02:36,610
- Oh, by the way, where's the gin? - I'll get the gin.
- 噢，对了，杜松子酒在哪儿？ - 我去拿

726
01:02:43,742 --> 01:02:46,452
Much faster, and swing the left arm up.
快了点，把左臂抬高

727
01:02:46,536 --> 01:02:47,013
<i>Many dreams ago

728
01:02:47,113 --> 01:02:48,239
Try it again.
再来一次

729
01:02:51,082 --> 01:02:54,752
<i>I dreamed many dreams

730
01:02:57,671 --> 01:02:59,548
<i>Waiting for

731
01:02:59,673 --> 01:03:03,260
<i>My true love

732
01:03:03,385 --> 01:03:07,263
<i>To appear

733
01:03:08,348 --> 01:03:10,766
<i>Though each night

734
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:14,270
<i>It seems

735
01:03:14,353 --> 01:03:16,271
<i>Someone filled

736
01:03:16,355 --> 01:03:19,775
<i>My dreams

737
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:24,988
<i>Still the face that I kissed

738
01:03:24,988 --> 01:03:29,033
<i>Wasn't clear

739
01:03:31,202 --> 01:03:36,957
<i>So I let my heart dance

740
01:03:37,082 --> 01:03:42,379
<i>Through many sweet refrains

741
01:03:42,504 --> 01:03:48,009
<i>But now just one song

742
01:03:48,009 --> 01:03:53,639
<i>And just one dream remains

744
01:03:53,739 --> 01:03:58,435
<i>That one song is you

745
01:03:58,519 --> 01:04:03,940
<i>And at last I know

746
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:04,065

747
01:04:04,065 --> 01:04:08,820
<i>You're the one I dreamed of

748
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:13,908
<i>Many dreams ago

750
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,334
- Hello. Yes. - Hello, Miss Doyle?
- 喂 - 喂，多尤太太吗？

751
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:26,462
- This is Jeff again. Has Tom come in yet? - Not yet, Jeff.
- 是的 -还是我，杰夫，汤姆回来了吗？- 还没有，杰夫

752
01:04:26,545 --> 01:04:30,173
- You mean you haven't even heard from him? - Not a word.
- 他也没打电话回来吗？ - 没有

754
01:04:30,173 --> 01:04:33,843
- Is it something really important, Jeff? - I'm afraid it is, Tess.
- 有什么重要的事吗，杰夫？ - 恐怕是的，苔丝

755
01:04:33,927 --> 01:04:35,845
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
我一联系上他，就让他打电话给你

756
01:04:35,929 --> 01:04:39,849
No, don't bother to do that. Just have him get over here as soon as he can.
不必了，让他尽快来我这儿

757
01:04:39,974 --> 01:04:43,019
- Looks like Thorwald's pulling out tonight. - Who's Thorwald?
- 看样子索沃德打算今晚逃跑 - 谁是索沃德？

758
01:04:43,019 --> 01:04:46,230
He'll know, he'll know. And Thorwald's a man, Tess. Don't worry.
他会明白的，索沃德是个男人，苔丝，别担心

759
01:04:47,355 --> 01:04:48,273
Good night, you idiot.
晚安,你这傻瓜[笑]

760
01:04:48,398 --> 01:04:51,400
Good night. 
晚安

761
01:05:05,956 --> 01:05:07,624
Long distance again.
又是长途电话

762
01:05:44,033 --> 01:05:49,329
There's somebody at the door. Who's at the door?
有人敲门，是谁？

763
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:53,791
- Hi.
- 你好 

765
01:06:14,561 --> 01:06:16,479
Hello.
你好

767
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:21,108
- What'd you do to your hair? - Oh, I just...
- 你头发怎么了？ - 我…

768
01:06:21,192 --> 01:06:24,487
Take a look at Thorwald. He's getting ready to pull out for good. Look at him.
看看索沃德先生，他正准备逃跑

769
01:06:28,282 --> 01:06:30,701
He doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
他好像不太着急

771
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:33,286
He's been laying out all his things on one of the beds:
他已经把东西都放在床上了

772
01:06:33,411 --> 01:06:35,705
shirts, suits, coats, socks.
衬衫，西装，外套，袜子

773
01:06:35,789 --> 01:06:39,500
- Even that alligator handbag his wife left on the bedpost. - What about it?
- 还有他妻子留在床头的鳄鱼皮手提包 - 包在哪？

775
01:06:39,584 --> 01:06:43,295
He had it hidden in the dresser. At least, it was there.
他藏在梳妆台里，之前一直在那

777
01:06:43,295 --> 01:06:47,091
He took it out, went to the telephone and made a long-distance call.
他刚才把它拿了出来，打了个长途电话

779
01:06:47,216 --> 01:06:50,135
He had his wife's jewelry in the handbag.
包里有他妻子的手饰

780
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:53,054
Seemed worried about it. Asked someone's advice over the telephone.
看起来他有些担心，打电话找人商量

781
01:06:53,138 --> 01:06:57,016
- Someone not his wife. - Well, I never saw him ask her for advice.
- 那人肯定不是他妻子. - 对，我从未见过他找妻子商量

783
01:06:57,016 --> 01:07:00,394
She volunteered plenty, but I never saw him ask her for any.
她到是很主动，但他从不找她

785
01:07:10,988 --> 01:07:14,155
- I wonder where he's going. - I don't know.
- 他会去哪儿？ - 不知道

786
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:18,074
- Suppose he doesn't come back? - He'll be back. His things are still there.
- 万一他不回来呢？ - 不会的，他的东西还在

788
01:07:19,575 --> 01:07:22,994
- I guess it's safe to put on some lights now. - No, not yet.
- 我想现在可以开灯了 - 不，等一会

790
01:07:29,957 --> 01:07:33,709
Okay, you can turn it on now. He must have gone someplace to the right.
好的，开吧，他往右边去了

792
01:07:35,793 --> 01:07:39,912
All day long, I've been trying to keep my mind on my work.
我一整天都没法集中精力工作

793
01:07:39,002 --> 01:07:40,639
Thinking about Thorwald? 
想着索沃德的事？

794
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:43,090
And you and your friend, Doyle.
还有你和你的朋友多尤

795
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:46,550
- Did you hear from him again since he left? - Not a word.
- 有他的消息吗？ - 没有

797
01:07:46,592 --> 01:07:48,479
He said he was gonna check the railroad station and the trunk.
他去查火车站和箱子了

798
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:50,982
He must be still at it.
大概还没忙完

799
01:07:52,107 --> 01:07:54,567
Something on your mind?
你在想什么？

800
01:07:54,651 --> 01:07:57,070
- It doesn't make sense to me. - What doesn't?
- 这很不对劲 - 什么？

802
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:01,560
Women aren't that unpredictable.
女人不会这么粗心

804
01:08:02,701 --> 01:08:05,312
Hmm. Well, I can't guess what you're thinking.
我不明白你的意思

805
01:08:05,312 --> 01:08:08,772
A woman has a favorite handbag,
一个女人很喜欢她的手提包

806
01:08:08,772 --> 01:08:11,858
and it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it easily.
总是把它带在身边

808
01:08:11,858 --> 01:08:15,860
Then, all of a sudden, she goes away on a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
有一天她出远门，却没带它，为什么？

810
01:08:15,902 --> 01:08:17,778
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip,
因为她不知道自己要出远门

811
01:08:17,906 --> 01:08:19,466
and where she's going, she wouldn't need the handbag.
或者她要去的地方不需要带包

812
01:08:19,991 --> 01:08:22,676
Yes, but only her husband would know that.
对，可他丈夫知道

814
01:08:23,949 --> 01:08:26,786
And that jewelry... Women don't keep their jewelry in a purse 
还有手饰，女人不会把手饰胡乱堆放在包中

815
01:08:26,786 --> 01:08:28,833
getting all twisted and scratched and tangled up.
还有手饰，女人不会把手饰胡乱堆放在包中

816
01:08:28,933 --> 01:08:32,602
- Well, do they hide it in their husband's clothes? - They do not.
- 那放在丈夫衣服里？ - 不会

817
01:08:32,602 --> 01:08:35,730
And they don't leave it behind either.
而且她们不会把手饰放在家里的

818
01:08:35,813 --> 01:08:40,983
Why, a woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
除了上医院，女人都要化妆，喷香水，戴手饰的

821
01:08:43,377 --> 01:08:45,739
Put that over there. That's inside stuff, huh? 
放那儿，这是你们的内部秘密？

822
01:08:45,739 --> 01:08:47,242
It's basic equipment.
这是基本的要求

823
01:08:47,504 --> 01:08:50,840
And you don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
绝不会放在手提包里，留在丈夫的抽屉中

825
01:08:51,007 --> 01:08:53,342
I'm with you, sweetie. I'm with you.
我也很怀疑，亲爱的

826
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:55,249
Tom Doyle has a pat answer for that though.
但汤姆.多尤说…

827
01:08:55,374 --> 01:08:59,459
That Mrs. Thorwald left yesterday with her husband? 
说索沃德太太昨天早上和她丈夫一起离开的？

828
01:08:59,543 --> 01:09:01,379
According to those witnesses.
目击者说的

829
01:09:01,379 --> 01:09:04,674
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle.
我听多尤先生说过了

830
01:09:04,806 --> 01:09:06,850
- Couldn't have been Mrs. Thorwald, or I don't know women. - Oh?
- 那肯定不是索沃德太太 - 真的？

832
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,852
- What about the witnesses?  
怎么解释目击者呢？

833
01:09:08,852 --> 01:09:12,890
We'll agree they saw a woman,
他们确实见到一个女人

834
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:14,226
but she was not Mrs. Thorwald.
可那不是索沃德太太

835
01:09:14,522 --> 01:09:16,198
That is, not yet. 
不是她本人

836
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:19,813
Is that so? 
是吗？

837
01:09:21,735 --> 01:09:23,694
Come here.
过来

839
01:09:26,654 --> 01:09:29,948
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him.
真想看看你朋友听到这些后的表情

840
01:09:29,948 --> 01:09:33,199
He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
他可不太像个探长

841
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:36,451
Oh, don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker.
别难为他，他是个老实的公务员

843
01:09:36,486 --> 01:09:39,512
I sure wish he'd show up.
真希望他快点到

844
01:09:39,581 --> 01:09:42,583
Don't rush him. We have all night.
别着急，我们有一整晚的时间

846
01:09:44,999 --> 01:09:47,317
- We have all what? - Night.
- 有什么？ - 整晚

847
01:09:47,371 --> 01:09:49,465
I am going to stay with you.
我会留下陪你

848
01:09:51,466 --> 01:09:55,678
You'll have to clear that with my landlord.
那你得和我的房东说清楚

849
01:09:55,803 --> 01:09:59,098
I have the whole weekend off.
我整个周末都不用上班

850
01:09:59,098 --> 01:10:02,308
That's very nice, but I just have one bed.
很好，可我只有一张床

851
01:10:02,726 --> 01:10:07,939
If you say anything else, I'll... stay tomorrow night too.
你再说话，明晚我也住这儿

852
01:10:07,939 --> 01:10:12,442
I won't be able to give you any... pajamas.
我没有多的…睡衣给你

854
01:10:15,018 --> 01:10:19,962
You said I'll have to live out of one suitcase.
你说过，野外生存只能带一个箱子

855
01:10:20,202 --> 01:10:23,204
I'll bet yours isn't this small.
我打赌，你的肯定比这个大

856
01:10:23,329 --> 01:10:24,533
This is a suitcase? 
这是个衣箱？

857
01:10:24,691 --> 01:10:28,501
Well, a Mark Cross overnight case anyway.
“马克.克洛斯”牌短途旅行箱

858
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:30,545
- Ooh, wow. - Compact, but, uh... ample enough.
- 噢 - 小巧紧凑，但足够用了

859
01:10:30,628 --> 01:10:33,547
Looks like you packed in a hurry.
你好像收拾得很匆忙

860
01:10:33,547 --> 01:10:36,133
Look at this. Isn't that amazing?
这个很有意思

861
01:10:36,258 --> 01:10:42,054
I'll trade you... my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
为了奖励我的女性直觉，留我过夜如何？

862
01:10:42,179 --> 01:10:45,265
I'll go along with that.
我同意

863
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:00,529
There's that song again.
又是那首曲子

864
01:11:06,243 --> 01:11:10,539
Where does a man get inspiration to write a song like that?
他哪来的灵感，能写出这样的曲子？

865
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:15,042
Well, he gets it from the landlady once a month.
每个月从房东太太那儿得到的

866
01:11:15,961 --> 01:11:18,797
It's utterly beautiful.
真是太美了

867
01:11:18,797 --> 01:11:21,509
I wish I could be creative.
真希望我也有创作才能

868
01:11:21,634 --> 01:11:24,804
Oh, sweetie, you are.
噢，亲爱的，你有

869
01:11:24,804 --> 01:11:27,405
Y-Y-You have a great talent for creating difficult situations.
你在制造麻烦方面很有天赋

870
01:11:27,405 --> 01:11:31,725
- I do? - Sure. Staying here all night, uninvited.
- 真的？- 当然. 不请自来，还擅自留下过夜

871
01:11:31,725 --> 01:11:34,936
Surprise is the most important element of attack.
出其不意，攻其不备

872
01:11:35,019 --> 01:11:37,730
Besides, you're not up on your private eye literature.
你没读过那本私家侦探小说吗？

873
01:11:37,855 --> 01:11:41,734
When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
当他们有麻烦时，总是女助手帮侦探摆脱困境

874
01:11:41,817 --> 01:11:44,529
Is she the girl that saves them from the clutches of the seductive showgirls...
也是她把他从艳舞女郎

875
01:11:44,529 --> 01:11:47,448
and the over-passionate daughters of the rich?
还有富翁女儿的魔爪下救出来的？

876
01:11:47,532 --> 01:11:49,951
- The same. - That's the one, huh?
- 就是那一部 - 就是那一部，啊

877
01:11:50,076 --> 01:11:53,037
It's funny. He never ends up marrying her, does he?
有趣，可他俩从未结婚，是吗？

878
01:11:53,162 --> 01:11:55,456
- That's strange. - Weird.
- 真奇怪 - 奇怪

879
01:11:58,917 --> 01:12:02,979
Why don't I slip into something more comfortable? 
我为何不钻进更舒服点的地方？

880
01:12:02,979 --> 01:12:03,627
By all means.
请便

881
01:12:03,627 --> 01:12:05,465
I mean, like the kitchen and make us some coffee.
比如去厨房煮点咖啡

882
01:12:06,465 --> 01:12:08,592
Oh, and some brandy too, huh?
还有白兰地

883
01:12:17,643 --> 01:12:20,771
Harry.
哈利

884
01:12:28,361 --> 01:12:30,780
- Jeff. - Hi.
- 杰夫 - 嗨

885
01:13:23,327 --> 01:13:25,204
What else have you got on this man Thorwald?
你对这个索沃德还知道些什么？

886
01:13:25,329 --> 01:13:28,749
Enough to scare me you wouldn't show up in time and we'd lose him.
很多，你再不来，他就跑了

887
01:13:28,749 --> 01:13:31,251
Think he's getting out of here? He's got everything he owns...
他要离开？

888
01:13:31,251 --> 01:13:35,547
laid out over there in the bedroom, waiting to be packed.
他已经在床上收拾行李了

889
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:40,301
I'm just warming some brandy. Mr. Doyle, I presume?
我正在热白兰地，我猜这就是多尤先生

891
01:13:43,095 --> 01:13:45,264
Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont.
汤姆，这是丽莎.弗里蒙特小姐

892
01:13:44,264 --> 01:13:48,934
- How do you do? - We think Thorwald's guilty.
-你好 -我们认为索沃德有罪

893
01:13:55,648 --> 01:13:58,359
Careful, Tom.
别瞎猜，汤姆

894
01:14:02,904 --> 01:14:03,906
Hello.
喂

896
01:14:03,494 --> 01:14:07,121
- Lieutenant Doyle. - Yeah, he's right here. For you.
-多尤中尉在吗？ -对，他在，找你的

897
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:09,870
- Hello. - Lieutenant Doyle, sir?
-你好 -多尤中尉吗？

898
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:13,081
Speaking. Yeah.
对，你说吧，好

899
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:20,046
All right. I see. Thank you. Good-bye.
好的，我知道了，多谢，再见

900
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:22,173
Coffee will be ready soon.
咖啡很快就好

901
01:14:22,256 --> 01:14:26,176
- Jeff, aren't you going to tell him about the jewelry? - Jewelry?
- 杰夫，为什么不告诉他手饰的事？- 手饰？

903
01:14:26,176 --> 01:14:28,885
He's got his wife's jewelry hidden in his clothes in the bedroom there.
他把妻子的手饰藏在卧室的衣服里

904
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:30,974
You sure it belonged to his wife? 
你确定是他妻子的？

905
01:14:30,974 --> 01:14:32,687
It was in her favorite handbag.
在她最喜欢的手提包里

906
01:14:32,689 --> 01:14:36,853
- Mr. Doyle, that can only lead to one conclusion. - Namely?
- 多尤先生，这只能得出一个结论 - 什么？

907
01:14:36,978 --> 01:14:40,898
That it was not Mrs. Thorwald that left with him yesterday morning.
昨天早上离开的不是索沃德太太

908
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:42,693
You figured that out, eh?
你怎么知道？

909
01:14:42,693 --> 01:14:46,604
It's simply that women don't leave their jewelry behind when they go on a trip.
很简单，女人不会不带手饰去旅行

911
01:14:46,604 --> 01:14:51,783
Come on, Tom. You don't really need any of this information, do you?
噢，汤姆，你早知道了对不对？

912
01:14:57,122 --> 01:14:59,599
As a matter of fact, I don't.
的确

913
01:15:05,171 --> 01:15:09,509
Lars Thorwald is no more a murderer than I am.
拉兹.索沃德不是杀人犯

914
01:15:12,595 --> 01:15:16,390
You can explain everything that's going on over there and is still going on?
你能解释这里发生的一切？

915
01:15:16,473 --> 01:15:18,975
No, neither can you.
不能，你也不能

916
01:15:18,975 --> 01:15:21,920
That's a secret, private world you're looking into out there.
你看到的是别人的私生活

917
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,897
People do a lot of things in private they couldn't possibly explain in public.
人们的隐私很难在公开场合下解释

918
01:15:24,897 --> 01:15:27,316
Like disposing of their wives?
例如谋杀妻子？

919
01:15:27,441 --> 01:15:30,318
Get that idea out of your mind. It'll only lead in the wrong direction.
忘掉这想法吧，那只会引出错误结论

920
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:32,320
What about the knife and the saw?
怎么解释刀和锯子呢？

921
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:34,941
Did you ever own a saw?  
你自己有锯子吗？

922
01:15:34,941 --> 01:15:37,602
Well, at home in the garage, I had...
有，在车库里，我有…

923
01:15:37,602 --> 01:15:39,152
How many people did you cut up with it?
你用它杀了多少人？

924
01:15:39,152 --> 01:15:43,455
Or with the couple hundred knives you've owned in your lifetime?
你这辈子用过多少刀？

925
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,582
Your logic is backward.
不能就凭这些作出判断

926
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:49,904
You can't ignore the disappearance and the trunk and the jewelry.
可妻子失踪了，还有箱子和手饰怎么解释？

928
01:15:49,987 --> 01:15:53,256
I checked the railroad station. He bought a ticket.
我查过火车站，他买了张票

929
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,425
Ten minutes later, he put his wife on the train.
十点钟后，他送妻子上了火车

930
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:58,636
Destination: Merritsville. The witnesses are that deep.
目的地：梅利斯维尔.目击者堆成山

931
01:15:58,636 --> 01:16:01,639
That might have been a woman, but it couldn't have been Mrs. Thorwald.
那可能是另一个女人，而不是索沃德太太

932
01:16:01,806 --> 01:16:06,185
- That jewelry... - Miss Fremont, that feminine intuition stuff sells magazines,
-那些手饰… -瞧，弗里蒙特小姐，靠女性直觉破案的故事是能提高杂志销量

933
01:16:06,185 --> 01:16:09,271
but in real life, it's still a fairy tale.
可在现实生活里，那行不通

934
01:16:09,354 --> 01:16:13,691
I don't know how many wasted years I've spent, tracking down leads based on female intuition.
我记不清浪费了多少时间，追查靠女性直觉提供的线索

935
01:16:13,775 --> 01:16:16,569
All right, I take it you didn't find the trunk.
够了，我知道你没找到箱子

936
01:16:16,653 --> 01:16:20,072
All this is from an old speech you made at the policemen's ball.
别背诵你在警局用过的发言稿了

937
01:16:20,072 --> 01:16:22,616
I found the trunk a half-hour after I left here.
离开火车站一个半小时后，我找到了箱子

938
01:16:22,616 --> 01:16:26,537
I suppose it's normal for a man to tie up a trunk with heavy rope?
难道用绳子绑箱子正常吗？

939
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:28,497
If the lock is broken, yes.
若锁坏了，就正常

940
01:16:28,622 --> 01:16:31,708
What did you find inside the trunk, a surly note to me?
你在箱子里找到了什么？ 傲慢的语气

941
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:33,918
Mrs. Thorwald's clothes;
索沃德太太的衣服

942
01:16:34,002 --> 01:16:37,130
clean, well-packed, not stylish, but presentable.
干净，整齐，不太时髦，但还拿得出手

943
01:16:37,213 --> 01:16:39,340
Didn't you take them off to the crime lab?
你没送去实验室化验

944
01:16:39,423 --> 01:16:42,343
I sent them on their merry and legal way.
我送去了

945
01:16:42,343 --> 01:16:44,970
Why, when a woman is taking a simple, short trip,
为什么一个短途旅行的女人

946
01:16:45,137 --> 01:16:47,264
does she take everything she owns?
要带上所有的东西？

947
01:16:47,347 --> 01:16:50,600
Let's let the female psychology department handle that one.
这个问题还是留给女性心理分析专家来解释吧

948
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:54,395
I would say it looked as if she wasn't coming back.
也许她不打算回来了

949
01:16:54,395 --> 01:16:56,397
That's what's known as a family problem.
这就是所谓的家庭纠纷

950
01:16:56,481 --> 01:16:59,150
If she wasn't coming back, why didn't he tell his landlord?
如果她不回来了，为什么不告诉房东？

951
01:16:59,275 --> 01:17:02,319
I'll tell you why he didn't tell his landlord, because he was hiding something.
我告诉你为什么，因为他隐藏了什么

952
01:17:05,906 --> 01:17:07,824
Do you tell your landlord everything?
你什么事都告诉房东吗？

953
01:17:07,908 --> 01:17:10,410
Ah, I told you to be careful, Tom.
我说过小心点，别瞎猜，汤姆

954
01:17:10,535 --> 01:17:13,830
If I'd have been careful piloting that recognizance plane during the war,
如果那次作战时，我小心点开飞机

955
01:17:13,955 --> 01:17:17,333
you wouldn't have had the chance to take the pictures 
你就不会碰巧拍到获奖照片,

956
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:19,669
that won you a medal and a good job and fame and money.
找到好工作,名利双收

957
01:17:21,046 --> 01:17:26,259
What do you say, we all sit down and have a nice friendly drink or two?
不如我们坐下来好好喝两杯吧

958
01:17:26,384 --> 01:17:28,928
Forget all about this.
忘了这一切吧

959
01:17:29,053 --> 01:17:32,515
We can tell lies about the good old days during the war.
我们可以随便聊聊当兵时的好时光

960
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,517
You mean you're through with the case?
你对这案子了如指掌了？

961
01:17:35,643 --> 01:17:39,604
There is no case to be through with, Miss Fremont. How about that drink?
根本就没有什么案子，弗里蒙特小姐，再来一杯吧

962
01:17:43,817 --> 01:17:49,322
Yeah, I guess you're right.

963
01:17:47,968 --> 01:17:50,803
好吧

964
01:17:52,241 --> 01:17:55,077
I think I better get home and get some sleep.
呃，我想我该回家睡觉了

965
01:17:56,703 --> 01:18:00,332
Cheers.
干杯

966
01:18:00,415 --> 01:18:04,794
I, uh... I'm not much of a snifter.

967
01:18:02,602 --> 01:18:04,728
我有点不胜酒力

968
01:18:09,215 --> 01:18:11,801
Oh, Jeff, if you need any more help...
噢，杰夫，如果需要帮助，就查黄页本吧

969
01:18:11,801 --> 01:18:15,512
consult the Yellow Pages in your telephone directory.

970
01:18:15,638 --> 01:18:19,683
Oh, I love funny exiting lines.
我喜欢滑稽的退场台词

971
01:18:19,808 --> 01:18:21,811
Who was that trunk addressed to?  
那箱子是寄给谁的？

972
01:18:21,811 --> 01:18:23,240
Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
安娜.索沃德太太

973
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,450
Then let's wait and find out who picks it up.
那么我们查查是谁领取的？

974
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:29,941
Oh, that telephone call... I gave them your number. Hope you don't mind.
噢，刚才那个电话… 我把你电话号码留给了他们，希望你不介意

975
01:18:29,941 --> 01:18:31,068
Depends on who they were.
得看他们是谁？

976
01:18:31,152 --> 01:18:33,455
The police at Merritsville. They reported the trunk was just picked up...
梅利斯维尔的警察

977
01:18:33,455 --> 01:18:35,499
他们说箱子刚被安娜.

978
01:18:35,499 --> 01:18:38,075
by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
索沃德太太领走了

979
01:18:38,075 --> 01:18:41,620
Don't stay up too late.
别熬得太晚了

980
01:18:57,885 --> 01:19:00,887
- Look. - What?
-看 -什么？

981
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:36,378
He's kind of young, isn't he?
他很年轻，不是吗？

982
01:20:10,826 --> 01:20:13,621
What are you doing?
你干什么？

983
01:20:16,331 --> 01:20:20,877
Orjust a cold and lonely

984
01:20:20,961 --> 01:20:23,838
Lovely work of art

985
01:20:39,394 --> 01:20:44,107
You know, much as I hate to give Thomas J. Doyle too much credit,
你知道，我不是不愿相信多尤的话

986
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:46,526
he might have gotten ahold of something when he said...
他说这只是别人的隐私，

987
01:20:46,526 --> 01:20:51,405
that was pretty private stuff going on out there.
确实有些道理

988
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:53,741
I wonder if it's ethical to watch a man...
我怀疑用望远镜观察别人是否道德？

989
01:20:53,824 --> 01:20:57,828
with binoculars and a long-focus lens.
我怀疑用望远镜观察别人是否道德？

990
01:20:57,953 --> 01:20:19,580
Do you...

991
01:20:19,580 --> 01:21:04,042
Do you suppose it's ethical, even if you prove that he didn't commit a crime?
仅仅因为我们证明他是清白的，就情有可原吗?

992
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:08,504
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
我不知道

993
01:21:08,588 --> 01:21:13,175
Of course, they can do the same thing to me, watch me like a bug under a glass if they want to.
当然，他们也可以观察我，就像看玻璃杯下面的小虫子

994
01:21:13,175 --> 01:21:17,888
Jeff, you know if someone came in here, they wouldn't believe what they'd see.
杰夫，如果有人进来，他们不会相信所见到的一切

995
01:21:18,013 --> 01:21:21,391
- What? - You and me with long faces, plunged into despair...
-见到什么？ -我们俩拉长了脸，失望沮丧

996
01:21:21,516 --> 01:21:24,602
because we find out a man didn't kill his wife.
因为我们发现一个男人没有杀害他妻子

997
01:21:24,728 --> 01:21:28,189
We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
我们真是两个冷血动物

998
01:21:28,314 --> 01:21:33,068
You'd think we could be a little bit happy the poor woman is alive and well.
那可怜的女人还活着，我们应高兴点

999
01:21:36,071 --> 01:21:40,534
Whatever happened to that old saying, "Love the neighbor?"
那句老话怎么说的：“爱你的邻居”？

1000
01:21:40,617 --> 01:21:44,329
You know, I think I'll start reviving that tomorrow.
[笑]我明天就去实践这句话

1001
01:21:44,454 --> 01:21:48,666
Yeah, I'll begin with Miss Torso.
对，先从多索小姐开始

1002
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:52,253
Not if I have to move into an apartment across the way...
那我也搬到对面去

1003
01:21:52,378 --> 01:21:56,965
and do the Dance of the Seven Veils every hour.
每天跳肚皮舞

1005
01:22:00,469 --> 01:22:02,971
Show's over for tonight.
今晚的演出结束了

1006
01:22:07,558 --> 01:22:10,061
Preview of coming attractions.
先让你饱饱眼福

1007
01:22:12,355 --> 01:22:14,857
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case?
多尤先生怀疑这箱子是我偷来的？

1008
01:22:14,857 --> 01:22:19,778
No, Lisa, I don't think he did.
不，丽莎，我想他没有

1009
01:22:33,332 --> 01:22:38,545
- What do you think? - Well, uh...
- 你觉得怎么样？ - 呃…

1010
01:22:38,629 --> 01:22:42,465
- I will rephrase the question. - Thank you.
- 那我换个问法 - 谢谢

1011
01:22:42,549 --> 01:22:45,468
Do you like it?  Yes,I like it.
- 你喜欢吗？ - 是的，我喜欢

1012
01:22:59,231 --> 01:23:01,650
What's the matter?
怎么了？

1013
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:05,028
- Somebody's hurt? - It's the dog.
- 有人受伤了？ - 是狗

1014
01:23:05,028 --> 01:23:10,533
Something's happened to the dog.
小狗出事了

1015
01:23:10,658 --> 01:23:14,453
- Somebody fall out a window? - I don't know.
- 有人坠楼了？ - 不知道

1016
01:23:14,537 --> 01:23:16,372
I think it's a dog.
好像是狗

1017
01:23:16,455 --> 01:23:21,418
It's dead. It's been strangled. The neck is broken.
它死了，是被掐死的，脖子都断了

1018
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:27,048
Which one of you did it? Which one of you killed my dog?
是谁干的？是谁害死我的小狗？

1020
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,466
You don't know the meaning of the word neighbor!
远亲不如近邻

1021
01:23:31,552 --> 01:23:33,762
Neighbors like each other,
邻居应该互敬互爱

1023
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:37,853
speak to each other, care if anybody lives or dies!
互相倾述，互相关心，在乎别人的生活

1024
01:23:38,267 --> 01:23:42,646
But none of you do!
难道你们不明白？

1025
01:23:44,898 --> 01:23:50,653
But I couldn't imagine any of you being so low that you'd kill a little helpless, friendly dog.
想不到你们会杀死一只友善无辜的小狗

1026
01:23:52,655 --> 01:23:57,993
The only thing in this whole neighborhood who liked anybody!
只有它喜欢这儿的所有人

1027
01:24:04,749 --> 01:24:10,004
Did you kill him because he liked you? Just because he liked you?
你杀死它，就因为它喜欢你？

1028
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,467
Let's go inside.
进去吧

1029
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:20,972
Come on. Let's go back in. It's only a dog.
回去吧，只是一条狗

1030
01:24:34,068 --> 01:24:38,197
You know, for a minute, that Tom Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
你知道，刚才汤姆.多尤差点就让我认为自己错了

1031
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,323
- But you're not? - Look.
-你没有吗？ -看

1032
01:24:40,323 --> 01:24:45,036
In the courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. Look.
整个院子里，只有一个人没走到窗边，看

1033
01:24:51,042 --> 01:24:56,130
Why would Thorwald want to kill a little dog?
索沃德为什么要杀一只小狗？

1034
01:24:56,255 --> 01:24:58,632
Because it knew too much?
因它知道的太多？

1035
01:25:06,347 --> 01:25:08,474
You think this is worth waiting all day to see?
你们觉得这值得等一整天吗？

1036
01:25:08,599 --> 01:25:11,269
Is he cleaning house?
他在清扫房间吗？

1037
01:25:11,352 --> 01:25:13,854
He's washing down the bathroom walls.

1038
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:17,566
Hmm, must have splattered a lot.
嗯，血一定溅得到处都是

1039
01:25:19,151 --> 01:25:21,778
Well, why not? That's what we're all thinking.
怎么啦？我们不就是这么想的吗？

1040
01:25:21,778 --> 01:25:24,739
He killed her in there, he has to clean up those stains.
他在那儿杀了她，离开前要清理现场

1041
01:25:24,823 --> 01:25:27,158
Oh, Stella, your choice of words.
噢，斯泰拉，看你说的

1042
01:25:27,241 --> 01:25:30,453
Nobody ever invented a polite word for a killing yet.
杀人还有什么好听的说法？

1043
01:25:33,247 --> 01:25:38,919
Lisa, back there on that shelf, there's a little yellow box. You see it?
丽莎，后面架子上有个小黄盒子，看见了吗？

1044
01:25:39,127 --> 01:25:41,129
- Top one? - Right on top, yeah.
-最上面？ -在右上边，对

1045
01:25:41,129 --> 01:25:44,132
And bring me the viewer there.
把看片器拿给我

1046
01:25:45,633 --> 01:25:50,596
I just got a... These are about two weeks old.
我刚刚…这些是两周前拍的

1047
01:25:50,721 --> 01:25:52,890
I hope I took something else besides leg art.
希望我拍的东西有用，

1048
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:57,186
- Now which one... - What are you looking for?
- 哪一张 - 你找什么？

1049
01:25:57,269 --> 01:26:00,105
I'm looking for something and if I'm right, I think I've solved a murder.
如果没错的话，我想我可以找出凶手

1050
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:03,400
- Mrs. Thorwald? - No.
- 杀人凶手？ - 不是

1051
01:26:03,483 --> 01:26:07,779
No, the dog. Uh-huh.
不，是杀狗的凶手

1052
01:26:07,904 --> 01:26:11,324
I think I know why Thorwald killed that dog.
我明白他为什么要杀狗了

1053
01:26:11,324 --> 01:26:14,285
Here, now you take a look. Tell me what you see.
你看，告诉我你看到什么？

1054
01:26:14,368 --> 01:26:18,205
Now take it down. Now look again.
把它移下来，再看一下，

1055
01:26:18,205 --> 01:26:20,791
Now take it down. You see?
移下来，看到了？

1056
01:26:22,918 --> 01:26:24,919
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
只是后院的照片

1057
01:26:24,919 --> 01:26:29,132
One important change. One important change.

1058
01:26:29,215 --> 01:26:33,344
Those flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
是花坛里的花

1059
01:26:33,427 --> 01:26:35,554
You mean where the dog was sniffing around?
你指狗在花坛中找什么？

1060
01:26:35,638 --> 01:26:39,266
Where the dog was digging. Now look at those flowers.
狗一直在挖那儿，看那些花

1061
01:26:39,349 --> 01:26:43,478
Look, those two yellow zinnias on this end...
看，那两朵黄色的百日菊，在边上…

1062
01:26:43,561 --> 01:26:45,480
aren't as tall as they were.
没有以前高了.

1063
01:26:45,563 --> 01:26:48,191
Since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
什么时候开始花越长越矮了？

1064
01:26:48,316 --> 01:26:50,234
There's something buried there.
下面埋着东西

1065
01:26:50,318 --> 01:26:52,486
Mrs. Thorwald.
索沃德太太

1066
01:26:52,611 --> 01:26:55,698
You haven't spent much time around cemeteries, have you?
你最近很少去上坟吧？

1067
01:26:55,823 --> 01:26:58,867
Mr. Thorwald could scarcely put his wife's body...
他绝不可能把妻子埋在一尺见方的地方

1068
01:26:58,992 --> 01:27:01,953
in a plot of ground about one foot square.
他绝不可能把妻子埋在一尺见方的地方

1069
01:27:02,078 --> 01:27:04,831
Unless, of course, he put her in standing on end.
除非他把她竖着埋下去

1070
01:27:04,831 --> 01:27:07,625
Then he wouldn't need a knife and saw.
如果那样，他就不需刀和锯子了

1071
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:12,046
No, my idea is she's scattered all over town. Leg in the East River...
不，我看她已经被扔得遍布满城了

1072
01:27:12,171 --> 01:27:14,466
- Oh, Stella, please. - No, there's something in there though.
-腿在东河里… -噢，斯泰拉，够了

1073
01:27:14,571 --> 01:27:17,990
Those flowers have been taken out and put back in.
不，有东西在那儿，花被挖出来又栽回去

1075

- Maybe it's the knife and saw. - Yeah...
- 可能是刀和锯子 - 也许

1076
01:27:20,178 --> 01:27:22,514
- Call Lieutenant Doyle. - No, let's wait.
- 通知多尤中尉吧 - 不，等一下

1077
01:27:22,514 --> 01:27:24,808
Let's wait till it gets a little darker,
等天黑一点，

1078
01:27:24,933 --> 01:27:26,851
and I'll go over there and dig them up. 
我去挖

1079
01:27:26,935 --> 01:27:30,996
You'll go? You won't dig anything up and get your neck broken.
你去？你还没开挖，脖子就断了.

1080
01:27:31,022 --> 01:27:33,149
No, we've...

I'm not gonna call Doyle until I can produce Mrs. Thorwald's body.
我不会通知多尤，除非找到尸体

He's packing.
他在收拾东西

1084
01:27:40,864 --> 01:27:42,991

Here, get me a pencil.
拿着，给我支笔

Stella, get me some note paper. It's up here someplace.
斯泰拉，拿张信笺纸，在那上面，好的

1087
01:27:49,914 --> 01:27:51,916
There it is.

1088
01:28:13,067 --> 01:28:16,986
[拉兹.索沃德 你对她做了些什么？]

You did it, Thorwald. You did it.

It's just a question of when.

1096
01:30:00,534 --> 01:30:03,787
Mind if I use that portable keyhole?
我可以看一下那个“移动钥匙孔”[指相机]吗？

Go ahead, just as long as you tell me...

01:30:16,924 --> 01:30:19,092
Miss Lonelyhearts just laid out something that looks like...

rodium tri-eckonal capsules.

- 你看清楚了吗？ - 我吃过那种药

to put everybody in Hackensack to sleep for the winter.

Wasn't that close?

1106
01:30:33,397 --> 01:30:36,817
What was his reaction when he looked at the note?
他有什么反应？我指看了纸条后

1107
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:40,904
It wasn't the kind of expression that would get him a quick loan at the bank.

1108
01:30:41,029 --> 01:30:43,406
Jeff, the handbag!

假如索沃德太太的结婚戒指在手提包里

During the phone conversation he held up three rings:
他打电话时拿出了三个戒指

1112
01:31:16,812 --> 01:31:20,023
one with a diamond, one with a big stone of some sort,

1113
01:31:20,148 --> 01:31:22,234
and then just a plain gold band.

would be her wedding ring.

1117
01:31:28,114 --> 01:31:33,119
The only way anybody could get that ring would be to chop off my finger.
除非有人切断我的手指

1118
01:31:35,121 --> 01:31:39,333
Let's go down and find out what's buried in the garden.
我们去看看花坛里埋的是什么吧

- 当然没有 - 地下室可能有

1122

If you're squeamish, just don't look.
-等等 -杰夫，如果你觉得恶心，就别看

我才不怕？我只是不想看到你俩与小狗一样下场

Just hold on. Here, take this.
先等等，拿着，

1126
01:32:01,394 --> 01:32:03,855
No sense taking any chances in this thing.

1127
01:32:03,855 --> 01:32:07,191
Give me the phone book.

也许我们可以再吓他一次

I guess I'm using that word "we" a little freely.
也许说“我们”不恰当.

1138
01:32:34,976 --> 01:32:37,052
You're taking all the chances.
一切都看你们的了

1139
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:42,015
- Shall we vote him in, Stella? - Unanimously.
