1
00:02:20,044 --> 00:02:23,013
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is now ready for boarding at --

2
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:27,744
Inmate number 87645 --
Cole, James.

3
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:48,301
- Jose, what's going on?
- Bad news, man.

4
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:52,205
- Volunteers?
- Yeah. And they said your name.

5
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:04,108
Maybe they'll give you
a pardon, man.

6
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:08,123
Yeah. That's why none of the volunteers
come back. They all get a pardon.

7
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:11,058
Some come back, I heard.

8
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:15,120
Please put me back!
Don't take me!

9
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:21,467
They got'em up on the seventh floor.
They hide'em up there.

10
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:23,596
They're all messed up in the head.

11
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:26,436
You don't know they're all messed up.
Nobody's seen'em.

12
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,976
And maybe they're not messed up.
That's a rumor. Nobody knows that.

13
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:31,479
I don't believe that.

14
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:34,615
Good luck, man.

15
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:38,950
- Volunteer duty!
- I didn't volunteer.

16
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:41,683
You causing trouble again?

17
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:44,988
No, no trouble.

18
00:03:48,164 --> 00:03:51,964
These are the instructions
for the first time probe.

19
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:55,993
Listen Carefully,
They must be following exactly.

20
00:03:56,072 --> 00:04:00,634
All openings of your garment
must be sealed completely.

21
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:05,203
If the integrity of the suit
is compromised in any way...

22
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:09,580
if the fabric is torn
or a zipper not closed...

23
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:11,847
readmittance will be denied.

24
00:08:45,294 --> 00:08:48,695
If there are any indications
of contamination by germs...

25
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:51,756
the subject will be denied
reentry to secure population.

26
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:55,736
Please place blood sample
in receptacle provided.

27
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:59,535
There will be a socialization
class in room 700...

28
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:04,170
for citizens cited
for deviations 23-A and 96-A...

29
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,681
per Subchapter 6
of the Permanent Emergency Code.

30
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,311
James Cole
cleared from quarantine.

31
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:16,185
Thank you.
You two wait outside.

32
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:19,056
He's got a history, Doctor.
Violence.

33
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:21,426
Antisocial six.

34
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:24,898
Repeated violations of
the Permanent Emergency Code.

35
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,901
Insolence. Defiance.

36
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:28,766
Disregard of authority.

37
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:30,964
Doing 25 to life.

38
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:33,303
I don't think
he's gonna hurt us.

39
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:36,503
You aren't gonna hurt us,
are you, Mr. Cole?

40
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,648
No, sir.

41
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,723
Why don't you sit down,
Mr. Cole?

42
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:22,254
We appreciate your volunteering.
You're a very good observer.

43
00:10:22,324 --> 00:10:25,589
- Thank you.
- We have a very advanced program.

44
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:29,825
- Something very different.
- A chance to reduce your sentence.

45
00:10:29,898 --> 00:10:32,093
And possibly play
an important role...

46
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,761
in returning the human race
to the surface of the Earth.

47
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:38,671
We want tough-minded people.
Strong mentally.

48
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,940
We've had some misfortunes
with unstable types.

49
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:49,109
For a man in your position,
an opportunity.

50
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:53,211
Not to volunteer
could be a real mistake.

51
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:56,018
Definitely a mistake.

52
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:02,386
"Yet among
the myriad microwaves...

53
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:07,060
the infrared messages,
the gigabytes of ones and zeros...

54
00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:10,003
we find words, byte-sized now...

55
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:12,438
tinier even than science...

56
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,374
Iurking in some
vague electricity.

57
00:11:15,444 --> 00:11:17,605
But if we but listen...

58
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:21,046
we hear the solitary voice
of that poet telling us...

59
00:11:23,018 --> 00:11:27,114
yesterday this day's madness
did prepare...

60
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:32,183
tomorrow's silent
triumph of despair.

61
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:35,923
Drink, for you know not
whence you came, nor why.

62
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:39,297
Drink, for you know not
why you go, nor where."

63
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,606
Wandering around in nothing
but his underpants...

64
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,116
and one of those plastic,
see-through lady's raincoats.

65
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:58,984
So, they get there, they ask the guy
real nice for some kind of ID.

66
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:02,080
He gets agitated,
starts screaming about viruses.

67
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:04,387
Totally irrational,
totally disoriented.

68
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,328
Doesn't know where he is,
what day of the week it is.

69
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:10,627
All they got was his name.

70
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:15,227
They figured he's stoned out of his
mind. Some kind of psychotic episode.

71
00:12:15,304 --> 00:12:18,569
- He's been tested for drugs?
- Negative for drugs.

72
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:22,474
But he took on five cops
like he was dusted to the eyeballs.

73
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:26,173
- No drugs. You believe that?
- He's in restraints.

74
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:31,550
Yeah. Weren¡¯t you listenin'? I've got
two police officers in the hospital!

75
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,023
The medic gave him enough Stelazine
to kill a horse. He's rarin' to go.

76
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:40,027
That would explain the bruises, I guess.
The struggle.

77
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:43,553
Yeah. You wanna go in there,
examine him?

78
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:45,896
Yes, please.

79
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:49,699
Is this all you have?
Ran it through your system?

80
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:55,005
No matchup. No license, no prints,
no warrants. Nothing.

81
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,773
- I should probably go in with you.
- No, Thank you.

82
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,974
- That won't be necessary.
- All right.

83
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:04,678
He'll be right here,
just in case.

84
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:19,459
Mr. Cole, my name is Kathryn Railly.
I'm a psychiatrist.

85
00:13:19,535 --> 00:13:22,129
I work for the county.
I don't work for the police.

86
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:24,764
So my concern is for your well-being.
Do you understand that?

87
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:27,933
Need to go!
Need to go!

88
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:31,637
I can't make the police
let you go.

89
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:34,910
But I do wanna help you,
so I--

90
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:37,918
I need you to tell me exactly
what happened tonight.

91
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:41,478
Do you think
you can do that,James?

92
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,081
May I call you James?

93
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:50,197
James.
Nobody ever calls me that.

94
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:54,429
- Have you been a patient at County?
- No.

95
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:58,564
- Have I seen you someplace?
- Not possible.

96
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:02,735
I need to go! I'm supposed
to be gathering information.

97
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:06,178
- What kind of information?
- Won't help you.

98
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:09,342
Won't help anyone.
Won't change anything.

99
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,921
James, do you know
why you¡¯re here?

100
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,620
'Cause I'm a good observer.
I've got a tough mind.

101
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:23,461
You don't remember
assaulting a police officer?

102
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:27,696
Why am I chained?
Why are these chains on me?

103
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,101
You've been in an institution
before, haven¡¯t you?

104
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:33,369
- Or hospital?
- No! Now I need to go. Need to go!

105
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:36,342
- Have you been in prison,James?
- Underground.

106
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:38,208
Hiding?

107
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:42,308
I love this air.

108
00:14:42,384 --> 00:14:46,411
Oh, it's such wonderful air.

109
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:51,323
- What's wonderful about the air,James?
- Very fresh. No germs.

110
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:58,762
Why do you think there aren't
any germs in the air?

111
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:01,394
- This is October, right?
- April.

112
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,429
- What year is this?
- What year do you think it is?

113
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:07,407
1 996.

114
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:11,412
That's the future,James. Do you
think you¡¯re living in the future?

115
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:13,413
1 996 is the past.

116
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:17,578
No, 1 996 is the future.

117
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:19,848
This is 1 990.

118
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:28,193
- Shut up, ladies.
- Where¡¯re you taking me?

119
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:30,754
South of France, buddy.
Fancy hotel. You'll love it.

120
00:15:30,832 --> 00:15:33,494
I can't go to France. I just need
to make a telephone call.

121
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:38,028
Yeah, yeah. Zip it, Daisy. You fooled
the shrink, but you don't fool us.

122
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:44,913
Let's go, ace.

123
00:16:12,908 --> 00:16:15,502
All right.
Come on, come on.

124
00:16:17,112 --> 00:16:21,105
There you go.
Now, lemme see your head,Jimbo.

125
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:24,845
- See if you got any creepy crawlers.
- I need to make a telephone call.

126
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,856
Got to get to a doctor,Jimbo. Can't
make no calls till the doctor says.

127
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:30,357
It's very important!

128
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:36,022
What you gotta do,Jimbo,
is take it easy. Relax into things.

129
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:38,293
And we'll all get along fine
if you just relax.

130
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:50,174
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.

131
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:57,113
Hey, Goines!

132
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:58,914
Yo, Goines!

133
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:00,955
Yo,Jeffrey!

134
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:06,751
- What?
- Look here.

135
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:10,992
This here's James. Now, do me a favor.
Why don't you show him around?

136
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:13,591
Tell him the TV rules.
Show him the games and stuff. Okay?

137
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:16,569
How much you gonna pay me?
How much? I'd be doin' your job.

138
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:19,334
- Five thousand dollars. That enough?
- Five thousand?

139
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:21,432
I'll wire a cheque
to your account as usual.

140
00:17:24,813 --> 00:17:28,146
I'll give him the deluxe
mental hospital tour.

141
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:30,844
Kid around, makes'em feel good.
We're pals.

142
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:33,648
You're the prisoners.
No, you're the guards.

143
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:35,553
Now you got it.

144
00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:39,287
Okay, it's all in good fun.
Here's some games here.

145
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:42,853
And there's--
Get out! Get out!

146
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,960
He was in my chair.

147
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:50,766
Games. Games.
Here's some games.

148
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,171
Games that wanna get out.

149
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:55,903
See? More games.

150
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:59,605
Games, they¡¯ve getize you.
See?

151
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:03,172
If you play the games, you're
voluntarily taking a tranquillizer.

152
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:06,880
I guess they gave you
some chemical restraints. Drugs!

153
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:10,254
What'd they give you? Thorazine?
Haldol? How much? How much?

154
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:12,486
Learn your drugs. Know your dosages.
It's elementary.

155
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:16,224
- I need to make a telephone call.
- A telephone call?

156
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:20,598
That's communication with the outside
world. Doctor's discretion.

157
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:23,263
If all of these nuts
could just make phone calls...

158
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:26,171
it could spread insanity
oozing through telephone cables...

159
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:30,108
oozing to the ears of all these
poor, sane people, infecting them.

160
00:18:30,178 --> 00:18:32,942
Wackos everywhere.
A plague of madness.

161
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:37,781
In fact, very few,Jim-- Jim, very few
of us here are actually mentally ill.

162
00:18:37,853 --> 00:18:40,117
I'm not saying
you're not mentally ill.

163
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:44,249
For all I know, you're crazy as a loon.
But that's not why you¡¯re here.

164
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:50,855
You're here
because of the system.

165
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:53,835
There's the television.

166
00:18:53,902 --> 00:18:56,029
It's all right there.
All right there.

167
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:58,095
Look, listen, kneel, pray.

168
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:01,108
The commercials!

169
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:04,269
We're not productive any more.
Don't make things. It's all automated.

170
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:07,507
What are we for then?
We're consumers,Jim.

171
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:10,483
Okay, okay. Buy a lot of stuff,
you're a good citizen.

172
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:13,544
But if you don't buy a lot of stuff,
what are you then?

173
00:19:13,622 --> 00:19:16,284
What?
You're mentally ill.

174
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:20,556
Fact,Jim. Fact! If you don't
buy things: toilet paper, new cars...

175
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:22,358
electrically operated
sexual devices...

176
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,694
stereo systems
with brain-implanted headphones...

177
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:28,634
screwdrivers with built-in radar
devices, voice-activated computers--

178
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:30,705
Take it easy,Jeffrey.

179
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:33,138
Be calm!

180
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:38,575
Right. That's right.
You're a very attractive woman.

181
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:44,681
If you want to watch a particular
TV program, like All My Children...

182
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:48,519
go to the nurse, tell her the day,
the time the show you wanna see is on.

183
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:50,887
But you have to tell her before
the show is scheduled to be on.

184
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:54,417
This guy was always requesting shows
that had already played.

185
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,624
Yes. No.
You have to tell her before.

186
00:19:57,699 --> 00:20:01,465
He couldn't grasp the idea that
the nurse couldn't make it be yesterday.

187
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,868
She couldn't turn back time!
Thank you, Einstein.

188
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:07,067
Now he, he was nuts.
He was a fruitcake,Jim.

189
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:11,635
Okay, that's it,Jeffrey.
You're gonna get a shot.

190
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:14,510
- I warned you.
- Right.

191
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:18,644
I got a little carried away...

192
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,713
explaining the inner workings
of the institution to Jim.

193
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,118
I don't really come
from outer space.

194
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:31,927
Oh. L.J. Washington.
He doesn't really come from outer space.

195
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
Don't mock me, my friend.

196
00:20:37,005 --> 00:20:39,769
Get outta my chair!

197
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:42,934
It's a condition
of mental divergence.

198
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:46,480
I find myself
on the planet Ogo.

199
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:49,345
Part of an intellectual elite...

200
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:54,980
preparing to subjugate
the barbarian hordes on Pluto.

201
00:20:55,056 --> 00:21:00,016
But even though this is a totally
convincing reality for me in all ways...

202
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:04,998
nevertheless, Ogo is actually
a construct of my psyche.

203
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:08,593
I am mentally divergent...

204
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,766
in that I am escaping
certain unnamed realities...

205
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:15,342
that plague my life here.

206
00:21:15,443 --> 00:21:19,607
When I stop going there,
I will be well.

207
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:25,452
are you also divergent,
friend?

208
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:33,822
This is a place
for crazy people.

209
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:37,160
I'm not crazy.

210
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:40,167
We don't use that term, "crazy,"
Mr. Cole.

211
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,170
You've got
some real nuts here!

212
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:51,207
I know some things
that you don't know.

213
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,043
It's gonna be very difficult
for you to understand it.

214
00:21:56,484 --> 00:22:00,045
I'm not gonna hurt anyone!

215
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:02,487
All right.

216
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:08,252
Look,
have any of you heard...

217
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,289
of the Army
of the Twelve Monkeys?

218
00:22:13,902 --> 00:22:17,338
They stencil this on the sides
of buildings everywhere.

219
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:20,238
Have you seen this?
Have you seen this?

220
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:22,503
Why don't you just
Take your time...

221
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,101
and try to explain this
from the beginning?

222
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:27,613
Right, right.
It's 1 990.

223
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:31,516
Okay, that makes sense.
They wouldn¡¯t have been active yet.

224
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:48,599
Five billion people
died in 1 996 and 1 997.

225
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,504
Almost the entire population
of the world.

226
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:56,976
Only about one percent
of us survived.

227
00:22:57,045 --> 00:23:00,947
- are you going to save us?
- How can I? This already happened.

228
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:04,712
I can't save you.
Nobody can.

229
00:23:04,786 --> 00:23:09,485
I am simply trying to gather information
to help the people in the present...

230
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:11,422
trace the path of the virus.

231
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:16,260
We're not in the present now,
Mr. Cole?

232
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:20,233
1 990 is the past. This already happened.
That's what I'm trying--

233
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:26,398
You believe 1 996 is the present then,
is that it?

234
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:30,444
No! 1 996 is the past too.
Listen to me. What I--

235
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:37,514
What I-- What I need to do
is make a telephone call.

236
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:41,954
I can straighten this out
If I make a telephone call.

237
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:45,117
Who would you call?
Who would straighten everything out?

238
00:23:45,193 --> 00:23:49,653
The scientists. They'll want to know
that they sent me to the wrong time.

239
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:54,759
I can leave a voice mail message
that they monitor from the present.

240
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,631
Can I just make
one telephone call, please?

241
00:23:59,741 --> 00:24:01,641
Please?

242
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:09,483
What are you doin' in the dog bowl?
Get outta there!

243
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:13,180
Who put those Doritos
in there anyway?

244
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:16,690
Yes? What?
Voice mail?

245
00:24:16,758 --> 00:24:19,124
Look, I don't know--
Stop makin' that noise!

246
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:21,458
I don't know
what you¡¯re talkin' about.

247
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:25,659
Is this a joke?
I don't know any scientists.

248
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:27,724
Duanne, get out--
James who?

249
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:33,870
Wasn't who you expected?

250
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:39,242
No. It was some lady.
She didn't know anything.

251
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:43,546
Well, maybe it was
the wrong number.

252
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:48,385
No. That's why they chose me.
I remember things.

253
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:50,720
James, where did you grow up?

254
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,851
Dr. Railly.

255
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:56,021
I have the strangest feeling
I've met you before.

256
00:24:56,097 --> 00:25:00,261
Wait. This is 1 990. I'm supposed
to be leaving messages in 1 996!

257
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:03,030
It's not the right number yet!
That's the problem!

258
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:06,767
I have a message for them.

259
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:45,035
Won¡¯t work.
Can't open it.

260
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:47,842
You think you can remove the grill,
but you can't. It's welded.

261
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:53,910
See? Told you.
All the doors are locked too.

262
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:56,422
They're protecting the people
on the outside from us...

263
00:25:56,491 --> 00:25:58,982
when the people on the outside
are as crazy as us.

264
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:24,280
Do you know what "crazy" is?
Crazy is "majority rules." Yeah.

265
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:26,320
Take germs, for example.

266
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:28,878
Germs?

267
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,756
In the 1 8th century, no such thing.
Nada. Nothing.

268
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:35,159
No one ever imagined such a thing!
No sane person, anyway.

269
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,363
Along comes this doctor.

270
00:26:41,035 --> 00:26:42,263
Semmelweis!

271
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:48,706
Semmelweis comes along, trying to
convince people, other doctors mainly...

272
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,779
that there are these teeny, tiny,
invisible bad things called germs...

273
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:54,347
that get into your body
and make you sick.

274
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:57,043
He's trying to get doctors
to wash their hands.

275
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:59,086
What is this guy?
Crazy?

276
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:02,748
Teeny, tiny, invisible--
"What do you call'em? Germs? What?"

277
00:27:02,824 --> 00:27:05,588
Now, cut to the 20th century.

278
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,757
Last week, in fact, right before
I got dragged into this hellhole!

279
00:27:10,832 --> 00:27:13,733
I go in to order a burger
in this fast-food joint.

280
00:27:13,835 --> 00:27:15,632
The guy drops it on the floor.

281
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:18,001
Jim, he picks it up,
wipes it off.

282
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:20,199
He hands it to me
like it was all okay.

283
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:23,505
"What about the germs?" I say.
He says, "I don't believe in germs.

284
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:27,741
Germs are a plot they made up so they
can sell you disinfectants and soaps."

285
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:31,911
Now, he's crazy, right?
See?

286
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:39,757
There's no right. There's no wrong.
There's only popular opinion.

287
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:42,387
You, you, you believe in germs,
right?

288
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:45,330
I'm not crazy.

289
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,428
Of course not! You wanna escape, right?
That's very sane.

290
00:27:52,273 --> 00:27:55,674
I can help you.
You want me to, don'tya? Get you out?

291
00:27:57,512 --> 00:27:59,844
You know how
to get outta here?

292
00:28:02,116 --> 00:28:03,344
Yes, my son!

293
00:28:03,418 --> 00:28:06,979
- Then why don't ya?
- Why don't I try to escape?

294
00:28:07,055 --> 00:28:10,821
Good question. Very good question.
Intelligent.

295
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:15,090
Because I would be crazy to escape.
I have sent out word.

296
00:28:15,163 --> 00:28:18,564
- I am all taken care of.
- What does that mean?

297
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:21,659
I've managed to contact
certain underlings, evil spirits...

298
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:24,398
secretaries of secretaries
and other assorted minions...

299
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:26,463
who will contact my father.

300
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:29,510
And when my father finds out
I'm in this kind of place...

301
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,376
he'll have them transfer me
to one of those classyjoints...

302
00:28:33,448 --> 00:28:36,417
where they treat you properly,
like a person, a guest!

303
00:28:36,484 --> 00:28:38,952
With sheets and towels
like a big hotel...

304
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,515
with great drugs for all of us
nut-case, lunatic, maniac devils!

305
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:49,454
Sorry. Sorry.

306
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,590
I got a little agitated.
The thought of escape crossed my mind.

307
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:55,101
And suddenly--

308
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:58,434
Suddenly I felt like bending
the fucking bars back!

309
00:28:58,506 --> 00:29:03,443
And ripping out the window frames
and eating them! Yes, eating them!

310
00:29:03,544 --> 00:29:05,876
And leaping, leaping, leaping!

311
00:29:05,947 --> 00:29:08,780
Colonics for everyone!

312
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:13,451
I'm a mental patient.
I'm supposed to act out.

313
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:16,649
Wait'll you morons find out who I am!
My father's gonna be really upset.

314
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:19,420
And when my father gets upset,
the ground shakes.

315
00:29:19,494 --> 00:29:24,659
My father is God!
I worship my father!

316
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,972
These dramatic videotapes, secretly
Obtained by animal rights activists...

317
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:35,167
have aroused public indignation.

318
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:38,871
But many scientists
vehemently disagree,

319
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:45,015
Torture experiments.

320
00:29:46,454 --> 00:29:50,185
- We're all monkeys.
- They hurt you?

321
00:29:53,094 --> 00:29:55,927
Not as bad as what they're doing
to the Easter Bunny.

322
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,702
Look at them.
They're just askin' for it.

323
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:07,904
Maybe the human race
deserves to be wiped out.

324
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,004
Wiping out the human race?

325
00:30:12,113 --> 00:30:15,344
It's a great idea.
It's great.

326
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:17,509
But more of a long-term thing.

327
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:19,917
First we have to focus
on more immediate goals.

328
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:22,455
I didn't say a word
about you-know-what.

329
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:28,987
- What are you talking about?
- Your plan. Emancipation.

330
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:35,266
What are you writing?
You a reporter?

331
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:37,429
It's private.

332
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:40,865
A lawsuit?
You gonna sue'em?

333
00:30:40,975 --> 00:30:44,502
Yo,Jimbo.
Time for your meds.

334
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:50,844
Take a chance,
Live the moment,

335
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:54,319
Sunshine,
Gorgeous beaches,

336
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:57,255
The Florida Keys!

337
00:30:57,325 --> 00:30:59,759
We'll return you to the Marx Brothers
in Monkey Business.

338
00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:02,523
Monkey business!

339
00:31:04,765 --> 00:31:06,665
Fetch!

340
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:14,000
Get it?
Monkey. Monk key.

341
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,241
What?

342
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:21,514
If you see a bearish future
in the decade ahead...

343
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:25,279
consider the changes sweeping the world
and the opportunities they offer.

344
00:31:25,353 --> 00:31:28,914
"And the opportunities
they offer." Ooh!

345
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,754
They really dosed you.
J im!

346
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:34,351
Major load.
Danger, Will Robinson, danger.

347
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:37,864
You gotta get it together.
Focus, focus, focus.

348
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:40,992
Remember the plan.
I did my part!

349
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:42,262
What?

350
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:46,272
Not "what." When.

351
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:48,342
- When?
- Yes. When.

352
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:49,773
Now. Now,Jim.

353
00:31:51,212 --> 00:31:53,806
Yes! Now!
Buy! Sell!

354
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:57,146
Stocks! Bonds!
Purchase! Sell!

355
00:31:57,218 --> 00:32:00,016
Yes!
No more monkey business!

356
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:02,749
No... more...

357
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:05,519
monkey business!

358
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:07,527
Yes, enhance your portfolio now.

359
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:10,462
Five hundred dollars.
I got $500. I'm insured!

360
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:14,126
Yeah! A window of opportunity
is opening now.

361
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:18,001
Now is the time for all good men
to seize the moment. The moment!

362
00:32:18,072 --> 00:32:20,506
Now is the time for all good men
to seize the day!

363
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:23,634
Goddamn it,Jeffrey!
Quit playin' the fool!

364
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:26,008
MasterCard!
Visa!

365
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,140
The key to happiness!

366
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:32,811
Jim, seize the moment!

367
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:34,650
Jeffrey, come back here!

368
00:32:44,098 --> 00:32:45,087
Go,Jim!

369
00:32:49,804 --> 00:32:53,934
- Get out. Out!
- Come here,Jeffrey!

370
00:33:05,086 --> 00:33:09,216
The future can beyours!
Last chance! Last chance!

371
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,671
Best place to go
would be Florida.

372
00:33:29,777 --> 00:33:33,304
The Keys are lovely
this time of year.

373
00:33:54,402 --> 00:33:58,634
Two's not working today.
Use one.

374
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:27,127
Kathryn,
this was in my box!

375
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:29,226
But I have a slight suspicion
it wasn't meant for me.

376
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:33,171
"You are the most bootiful
woman I have ever seen.

377
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:36,869
You live in a bootiful world,
but you don't know it.

378
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:40,447
You have freedom, sunshine,
air you can breathe--"

379
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:43,108
James Cole, right?

380
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:48,144
"I would do anything to stay here
but I must leave. Please help me."

381
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:50,850
Okay, okay, okay.
Poor man.

382
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:53,985
Hey, Kathryn?
James Cole is one of yours, right?

383
00:34:54,061 --> 00:34:56,723
He eloped.
Last seen, he was up on two.

384
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:58,389
Shit!

385
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:06,930
We have to know exactly
what's there so we can fix it.

386
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:09,441
Doctor, we have a visitor.

387
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,037
May I help you?
Excuse me?

388
00:35:22,423 --> 00:35:26,086
Hey,Jimbo.
What's up, man?

389
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,067
All right, it's okay.
Take it easy.

390
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:38,731
- It'll be all right.
- Take care.

391
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:42,264
Take it easy.
We'll work this out, okay?

392
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:46,677
Send you back to your room. A little
milk and cookies, you'll be all right.

393
00:35:46,747 --> 00:35:49,477
Just take it easy, okay?

394
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:53,009
Calm down!

395
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:02,957
Take him down!
Take him the fuck down!

396
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:11,705
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
Dr. Railly, help me, please.

397
00:36:11,772 --> 00:36:15,230
- We'll give you something to calm you.
- No! No more drugs!

398
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,810
James, we have to do this.
You're very confused.

399
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:33,355
Kathryn, we've been working
together for four years.

400
00:36:33,427 --> 00:36:35,861
I've never seen you
like this before.

401
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:40,060
So please stop being so defensive.
This isn't an inquisition.

402
00:36:40,134 --> 00:36:43,467
I didn't think I was being defensive.
I was trying to explain exactly what--

403
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:46,438
He should've been in restraints.

404
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,135
It was bad judgment on your part,
plain and simple. Why not own up to it?

405
00:36:50,244 --> 00:36:53,179
Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have
the strangest feeling about him.

406
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:56,808
- I've seen him before and I'm trying--
- Two policemen are in the hospital.

407
00:36:56,884 --> 00:37:00,115
Now we've got a security guard
with a skull fracture.

408
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:03,520
I said it was bad judgment!
What else do you want me to say?

409
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:06,116
You see that?
See what I mean?

410
00:37:06,193 --> 00:37:09,253
You're being defensive.
Isn't she being defensive?

411
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:14,267
We have another situation.

412
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:22,599
- He was fully restrained?
- Yes, sir. I did it myself.

413
00:37:24,078 --> 00:37:26,410
And he was fully sedated?

414
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,641
He was fully sedated.

415
00:37:40,995 --> 00:37:44,988
are you trying to tell me a fully
sedated, fully restrained patient...

416
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:49,297
somehow slipped out that vent,
replaced the grill behind him...

417
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:53,568
and is wriggling his way
through the ventilation system?

418
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:13,156
Watch it!

419
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:15,661
You sure fucked up!

420
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:23,996
- Where are you?
- Ah, you can talk!

421
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,480
My name's not Bob.

422
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:39,645
Not a prob, Bob.
Where'd they send you?

423
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:43,749
- Where are you?
- Another cell.

424
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:48,151
Maybe.

425
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:50,526
What do you mean "maybe"?
What's that supposed to mean?

426
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:53,327
Maybe means...

427
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,392
maybe I'm in the next cell.

428
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,099
Another volunteer like you.

429
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:03,540
Or maybe I'm in
the Central Office...

430
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:07,046
spying on ya
for all those science bozos.

431
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,580
Or, hey...

432
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,983
maybe I'm not even here.

433
00:39:13,053 --> 00:39:17,251
Maybe I'm just in your head.

434
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:21,788
No way to confirm anything.

435
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:27,227
- Where'd they send ya?
- 1 990.

436
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:32,830
'90! How was it?
Good drugs? Lots of pussy?

437
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,603
Hey, Bob, you do the job?

438
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,043
You find out the big info?

439
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:42,776
Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

440
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,375
It was supposed to be 1 996.

441
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:49,388
Science ain't an exact science
with these clowns.

442
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:52,118
But they're getting better.

443
00:39:52,192 --> 00:39:56,652
You're lucky you didn't end up
in ancient Egypt.

444
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,220
Shh! They're comin'.

445
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:03,392
The Freedom for Animals Association
on Second Avenue...

446
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:06,303
is the secret headquarters
of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys,

447
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:10,070
They are the ones
who are going to do it,

448
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:13,146
I can't do any more,
I have to go now.

449
00:40:13,213 --> 00:40:15,875
Have a merry Christmas.

450
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:20,144
- Wel l?
- What?

451
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,451
Did you or did you not
record that message?

452
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:27,790
It's a reconstruction
of a deteriorated recording.

453
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:32,457
Weak signal. We have to put them
together one word at a time.

454
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:34,557
We just finished
rebuilding this.

455
00:40:34,635 --> 00:40:38,332
Did you or did you not
make this call?

456
00:40:38,405 --> 00:40:43,866
I couldn't make any call. You sent me
to the wrong year. It was 1 990.

457
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:50,048
- You're certain of that?
- What'd you do with your time, Cole?

458
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:52,915
Did you waste it on drugs?
Women?

459
00:40:52,986 --> 00:40:55,011
- They forced me to take drugs.
- Forced you?

460
00:40:55,088 --> 00:40:58,455
Why would someone
force you to take drugs?

461
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:05,095
I was in trouble.
I got arrested.

462
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:12,231
I did what you wanted.
I got a specimen, a spider.

463
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:16,367
I didn't have anyplace
to put it, so I ate it.

464
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:20,243
But you sent me to the wrong year,
so it really doesn't matter.

465
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:23,340
Did you see this
when you went back?

466
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:25,885
No, sir, I don't think so.

467
00:41:25,953 --> 00:41:29,514
What about these people?
Did you see any of these people?

468
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,616
No.

469
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:35,594
Oh, wait, wait.

470
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:39,828
Him?
You saw that man?

471
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:43,595
Maybe in the mental institution.

472
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,538
You were in a mental institution?
Oh, God.

473
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:51,770
Cole, you were sent back to make
some very important observations.

474
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:53,813
You could've made
a real contribution.

475
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:56,748
Helped us
to reclaim the planet.

476
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:59,251
As well as reducing
your sentence.

477
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:03,756
The question is, Cole,
do you want another chance?

478
00:42:29,149 --> 00:42:32,778
Last connection going on.

479
00:43:16,163 --> 00:43:19,428
No mistakes this time, Cole.

480
00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:22,491
Stay alert.
Keep your eyes open.

481
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:26,300
We're thinking about the spider, Cole.
Try and do something like that again.

482
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,431
Just relax now.
Don't fight it.

483
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:31,602
We're sending you
to the third quarter of 1 996.

484
00:43:31,712 --> 00:43:34,146
Right on the money.

485
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:12,642
I don't understand!

486
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:16,782
What?

487
00:44:16,857 --> 00:44:18,688
I don't understand!

488
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:23,258
- Where am I?
- I gotta find'em! I gotta find'em!

489
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,696
Help me!
I don't know where I am.

490
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:29,799
- You gotta help me find'em!
- Jose?

491
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,838
- Jose!
- Cole!

492
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:34,635
Cole, where are we?

493
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:38,902
- Help me, Cole!
- Oh, God, wait!

494
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:55,457
"In a season of great pestilence...

495
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:59,124
there are omens and divinations.

496
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:01,258
And one of the four beasts
gave unto the seven angels...

497
00:45:01,334 --> 00:45:04,462
seven golden vials
full of the wrath of God...

498
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:07,632
who liveth forever and ever."

499
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:09,231
Revelations.

500
00:45:09,342 --> 00:45:12,971
In the 1 4th century, according to
accounts of officials of that time...

501
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,516
this man appeared suddenly in
the village of Wyle near Stonehenge...

502
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:18,584
in April of 1 362.

503
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:22,215
Using unfamiliar words
and speaking in a strange accent...

504
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:25,190
the man made dire prognostications
about a pestilence...

505
00:45:25,258 --> 00:45:29,854
which he said would wipe out humanity
in approximately 600 years.

506
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:34,230
Obviously this plague-doomsday scenario
is considerably more compelling...

507
00:45:34,301 --> 00:45:36,326
when reality supports it
with a virulent disease...

508
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:39,566
whether it's the bubonic plague,
smallpox or AIDS.

509
00:45:39,673 --> 00:45:41,834
Nowwe have technological horrors
as well...

510
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:44,638
such as chemical warfare,
which first reared its ugly head...

511
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:47,543
during the deadly mustard gas attacks
of World War I.

512
00:45:47,614 --> 00:45:51,050
During such an attack in the French
trenches in October of 1 91 7...

513
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:52,914
we have an account
of this soldier...

514
00:45:52,986 --> 00:45:55,580
who, during an assault,
was wounded by shrapnel...

515
00:45:55,655 --> 00:45:58,749
and hospitalized, apparently
in a state of hysteria.

516
00:45:58,825 --> 00:46:01,851
Doctors found he had lost
all comprehension of French...

517
00:46:01,928 --> 00:46:04,294
but that he spoke English fluently...

518
00:46:04,364 --> 00:46:07,527
albeit in a regional dialect
they didn't recognize.

519
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:11,128
The man, though physically
unaffected by the gas...

520
00:46:11,204 --> 00:46:13,536
was beside himself.

521
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,507
He claimed that he
had come from the future...

522
00:46:16,576 --> 00:46:18,567
that he was looking
for a pure germ...

523
00:46:18,678 --> 00:46:21,647
that would ultimately wipe mankind
off the face of the Earth...

524
00:46:21,748 --> 00:46:24,683
starting in the year 1 996.

525
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:30,752
Though injured, the young soldier
disappeared from the hospital...

526
00:46:30,824 --> 00:46:33,520
no doubt trying to carry on
his mission toward others...

527
00:46:33,593 --> 00:46:36,061
and substituting
for the agony of war...

528
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:39,565
a self-inflicted agony
we call "the Cassandra complex."

529
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:43,262
Cassandra, in Greek legend,
was condemned to know the future...

530
00:46:43,336 --> 00:46:46,271
but to be disbelieved
when she foretold it.

531
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:50,469
Hence, the agony of foreknowledge, plus
the impotence to do anything about it.

532
00:47:03,623 --> 00:47:07,354
I'm going right out
to get vaccinated.

533
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,691
I think, Dr. Railly,
you've given alarmists a bad name.

534
00:47:10,764 --> 00:47:12,527
I have?

535
00:47:12,632 --> 00:47:17,626
There's real data that the planet cannot
survive the excesses of the human race.

536
00:47:17,704 --> 00:47:20,468
- This is true.
- Proliferation of atomic devices.

537
00:47:20,574 --> 00:47:22,769
Uncontrolled breeding habits.

538
00:47:22,876 --> 00:47:26,403
Pollution of land, sea and air.
The rape of the environment.

539
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:31,348
In this context, it's obvious Chicken
Little represents the sane vision...

540
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:35,184
and that Homosapiens' motto,
" Let's go shopping"...

541
00:47:35,255 --> 00:47:38,224
is the cry of the true lunatic.

542
00:47:41,661 --> 00:47:45,097
Please, Dr. Railly. I wonder
if you¡¯re aware of my own studies.

543
00:47:52,606 --> 00:47:55,632
See you at work tomorrow.

544
00:47:55,742 --> 00:47:58,438
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

545
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:16,756
Get in the car!

546
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:19,765
I've got a gun. Get in the car.

547
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:26,372
Drive.

548
00:48:26,473 --> 00:48:28,873
Take my purse.
I've got a lot of cash, credit cards.

549
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:31,570
- Take my keys.
- Start the car!

550
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:47,450
Here, turn right.
Turn right here.

551
00:48:52,832 --> 00:48:55,801
- Where are we going?
- Philadelphia.

552
00:48:55,902 --> 00:48:59,736
- That's more than a hundred miles.
- That's why I can't walk there.

553
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:02,331
- Just let me go.
- Just drive!

554
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:04,876
- You can take the car.
- I don't know how to drive.

555
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:10,313
I went underground when I was eight.
I told you that before.

556
00:49:10,383 --> 00:49:11,850
At the next--

557
00:49:11,918 --> 00:49:16,753
- At the next corner, turn right.
- Cole.James Cole.

558
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:20,554
You escaped from a locked room
six years ago.

559
00:49:20,627 --> 00:49:23,596
Six years for you.
Come on.

560
00:49:23,663 --> 00:49:25,392
Turn around! Get goin'.

561
00:49:36,176 --> 00:49:39,942
I can't believe that this
is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.

562
00:49:40,013 --> 00:49:43,107
- Have you been following me?
- You said you would help me.

563
00:49:43,183 --> 00:49:46,482
I know this isn't what you meant,
but...

564
00:49:46,553 --> 00:49:48,646
I don't have any money.

565
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:52,556
I hurt my leg.
I've been sleeping on the street.

566
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,217
I'm sure I smell bad.

567
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:58,355
Do you have any food in this car?

568
00:49:58,465 --> 00:50:02,231
- You have been following me?
- No.

569
00:50:02,302 --> 00:50:05,032
No, I saw this...

570
00:50:06,506 --> 00:50:09,373
in a store window.

571
00:50:09,442 --> 00:50:12,377
I can read, remember?

572
00:50:15,181 --> 00:50:17,206
Why do you want to go
to Philadelphia?

573
00:50:17,283 --> 00:50:21,583
I checked out the Baltimore information.
It was nothing.

574
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:26,552
It's in Philadelphia.
That's where the ones who did it are.

575
00:50:26,626 --> 00:50:29,595
The Twelve Monkeys.

576
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:34,359
Is that a radio?
Can you turn it on?

577
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,869
This is apersonal message to you,

578
00:50:40,974 --> 00:50:43,135
are you at the end of your rope?

579
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:45,837
are you dying to get away?

580
00:50:45,945 --> 00:50:49,608
The Florida Keys are waiting for you,
Ocean waves--

581
00:50:49,682 --> 00:50:51,912
I've never seen the ocean.

582
00:50:51,985 --> 00:50:55,682
It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole.

583
00:50:55,755 --> 00:50:58,519
What?

584
00:50:58,591 --> 00:51:01,321
It's an advertisement.
You understand that, don't you?

585
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:05,296
It's not really
a special message to you.

586
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,397
Mr. Cole.

587
00:51:11,037 --> 00:51:13,801
- You used to call me James.
- You prefer that?

588
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:19,041
James, you don't really
have a gun--

589
00:51:19,112 --> 00:51:22,275
Can you turn this up?
Can you make this louder?

590
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:26,613
I found my thrill

591
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:31,620
On Blueberry Hill

592
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:41,460
When I found you

593
00:51:44,003 --> 00:51:46,938
I love the music
of the 20th century.

594
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:52,910
I love this air.
Love to breathe this air!

595
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:08,587
WXBX news break,

596
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:10,891
News as it happens,
Roger Pratt reporting,

597
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:14,525
A story breaking now is emergency crews
are converging on a corn field...

598
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:16,762
where playmates of nine-year-old
Ricky Neuman say...

599
00:52:16,836 --> 00:52:18,929
he disappeared before their eyes,

600
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:21,872
Young Neuman apparently stepped
into an abandoned well shaft...

601
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:24,535
and is lodged somewhere
in the narrow 1 50-foot pipe,

602
00:52:24,644 --> 00:52:29,274
Possibly alive, possibly badly injured,
playmates heard him cry out faintly,

603
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:32,682
- Never cry wolf.
- What?

604
00:52:32,785 --> 00:52:36,050
My father said that to me.
He said, " Never cry wolf."

605
00:52:36,122 --> 00:52:39,990
Then people won't believe you
if something really happens.

606
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:43,995
If something really happens
like what,James?

607
00:52:44,063 --> 00:52:46,088
Something bad.

608
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:48,430
Can we have some more music, please?
I don't wanna hear this stuff.

609
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:51,368
Can we hear more music?

610
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:57,301
- I see trees of green
- Oh, that's good. That's good.

611
00:52:59,612 --> 00:53:02,775
I¡¯ve seen them bloom

612
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:04,976
Forme and you

613
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:09,613
And I think to myself

614
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:13,284
What a wonderful world

615
00:53:17,163 --> 00:53:20,621
Hello, Dr. Railly?
This is Wikke from Psych Admitting,

616
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,828
Do you remember James Cole?

617
00:53:23,903 --> 00:53:26,838
The paranoid who pulled
the Houdini back in'90?

618
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,067
Well, he's back, and he's--

619
00:53:29,175 --> 00:53:32,542
Sorry about that, He's looking for you,
I thought you ought to know.

620
00:53:32,612 --> 00:53:34,170
Take care,

621
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,841
It's just like I told you.
Me and my husband went ahead.

622
00:53:37,917 --> 00:53:42,013
I don't know. She never showed.
That is totally unlike her.

623
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:45,148
Do you happen to know
the make of her car?

624
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:47,489
Cherokee.'94 Cherokee.

625
00:53:49,162 --> 00:53:53,656
Silver,

626
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:55,360
I have done "doed"it, ja.

627
00:53:55,435 --> 00:53:59,531
I, Professor Grosse fibber,
have invented the time tunnel!

628
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:00,697
Oh, boy!

629
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:08,203
Oh, excuse me, mister,
Have a cigar,

630
00:54:12,885 --> 00:54:15,547
Excuse me, mister,
Have a cigar,

631
00:54:25,798 --> 00:54:30,428
Now my time machine
is ready for experiments,

632
00:54:34,307 --> 00:54:36,969
Ah, the woodpecker!

633
00:54:37,076 --> 00:54:39,704
Yoo-hoo, woodpecker!

634
00:55:05,371 --> 00:55:08,340
You were i n my dream just now.

635
00:55:10,076 --> 00:55:13,307
Hai r is different.
Different color.

636
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:17,915
I'm sure it was you.

637
00:55:19,752 --> 00:55:22,414
What was the dream about?

638
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:27,221
About an airport...

639
00:55:27,293 --> 00:55:29,761
before everything happened.

640
00:55:30,663 --> 00:55:33,359
It's the same dream
I always have.

641
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:36,402
When I was a kid.

642
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:38,460
And I was in it?

643
00:55:38,538 --> 00:55:40,972
What did I do?

644
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:43,536
You were very upset.

645
00:55:46,245 --> 00:55:49,146
You're always very upset
in the dream.

646
00:55:49,215 --> 00:55:51,240
Just never knew it was you.

647
00:55:51,317 --> 00:55:53,444
It wasn't me before,James.

648
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:57,250
It's become me now
because of what¡¯s happening.

649
00:55:59,325 --> 00:56:01,793
Could you please untie me?

650
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,964
No, I think it was always you.

651
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:11,765
Very strange.

652
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:14,102
You're flushed
and you were moaning.

653
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:17,699
I think you¡¯re running a fever.

654
00:56:26,185 --> 00:56:28,415
What are you doing?

655
00:56:39,932 --> 00:56:44,562
In Fresno, California, crews continue
to attempt to rescue Ricky Neuman,

656
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:53,142
Closer to home, in Baltimore,
Kathryn Railly...

657
00:56:53,212 --> 00:56:56,841
prominent psychiatrist and author of
a newly released book on insanity...

658
00:56:56,916 --> 00:57:01,012
disappeared mysteriously last night
after a lecture at the university,

659
00:57:01,087 --> 00:57:04,454
Former mental patient James Cole
is wanted for questioning...

660
00:57:04,524 --> 00:57:06,958
regarding Dr. Railly's disappearance,

661
00:57:07,026 --> 00:57:09,358
Authorities warn that Cole
has a history of violence...

662
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:12,125
and advise anyone spotting him
to notify authorities at once,

663
00:57:22,909 --> 00:57:25,434
I love this music.

664
00:57:25,545 --> 00:57:28,173
We don't have this.
We don't have anything like this.

665
00:57:28,247 --> 00:57:30,681
What are all those?

666
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,081
These?

667
00:57:32,151 --> 00:57:35,052
My notes, clues.

668
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:37,112
What kind of clues?

669
00:57:37,223 --> 00:57:39,214
It's about the secret army.

670
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:41,522
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
They're the ones that spread the virus.

671
00:57:41,594 --> 00:57:44,654
That's why I'm here.
I have to find them. That's my mission.

672
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:47,756
Have to locate them because they
have the virus in its pure form...

673
00:57:47,867 --> 00:57:49,562
before it mutates.

674
00:57:49,635 --> 00:57:52,536
When I locate them,
they'll send a scientist back here.

675
00:57:52,605 --> 00:57:54,630
That scientist will study the virus.

676
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,767
When he goes back to the present,
he and the scientists will make a cure.

677
00:57:58,845 --> 00:58:01,040
Police officers
from three jurisdictions...

678
00:58:01,113 --> 00:58:04,378
apparently including
special tactical unit personnel...

679
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:08,648
have now been mobilized to control
the growing thousands of onlookers...

680
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:10,985
here in Fresno, California,

681
00:58:11,057 --> 00:58:12,718
Does that disturb you?

682
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:16,523
No. Thought it was about us.

683
00:58:16,596 --> 00:58:20,498
Thought maybe they'd captured us
and arrested me.

684
00:58:21,634 --> 00:58:22,896
Just a joke.

685
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,341
I remember being very afraid
for that little boy.

686
00:58:31,444 --> 00:58:33,309
All alone, down that well...

687
00:58:33,379 --> 00:58:35,472
not knowing if anybody's
gonna get him out.

688
00:58:37,049 --> 00:58:39,210
First time I was really afraid
when I was a kid.

689
00:58:39,285 --> 00:58:41,276
What do you mean,
"when you were a kid"?

690
00:58:41,354 --> 00:58:44,118
Never mind.
Just a prank, a hoax.

691
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:46,283
That boy's hiding in a barn.

692
00:58:58,804 --> 00:59:01,705
"There are omens and divinations.

693
00:59:01,774 --> 00:59:05,266
One of the four beasts
gave unto the seven angels...

694
00:59:05,378 --> 00:59:09,144
seven golden vials
full of the wrath of God...

695
00:59:09,215 --> 00:59:12,878
who liveth forever and ever."

696
00:59:12,952 --> 00:59:16,149
You won't think I'm crazy
when people start dying next month.

697
00:59:17,723 --> 00:59:20,817
First they'll think
it's just some weird fever.

698
00:59:24,163 --> 00:59:26,461
Then they'll find out.

699
00:59:26,532 --> 00:59:29,399
They'll catch on.

700
00:59:30,703 --> 00:59:33,672
Wait. Stop here! Stop the car!
Stop right here!

701
00:59:37,877 --> 00:59:41,108
I was right. They're here!

702
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,775
You see? Twelve Monkeys!
Twelve Monkeys!

703
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:48,081
You believe me now?
Come on!

704
00:59:50,856 --> 00:59:53,017
Come on!

705
00:59:53,092 --> 00:59:55,390
They're here, you see?

706
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:57,895
Twelve Monkeys!

707
00:59:57,964 --> 01:00:00,023
Twelve Monkeys. Come on!

708
01:00:02,134 --> 01:00:04,034
Twelve Monkeys.

709
01:00:04,103 --> 01:00:06,663
Wait, wait. Wait, here.

710
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:09,207
Here, do you see it?
Do you see?

711
01:00:09,275 --> 01:00:11,743
I see some red paint,
some marks.

712
01:00:11,844 --> 01:00:14,677
- Marks? You think that--
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

713
01:00:16,515 --> 01:00:20,246
Don't--
Don¡¯t you do anything crazy.

714
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,150
Or I'll hurt somebody.

715
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:25,452
I am not gonna do anything crazy, but
none of this is what you think it is!

716
01:00:25,524 --> 01:00:28,084
You can't hide from them, Bob.

717
01:00:29,195 --> 01:00:32,824
I said, you can't hide from them.

718
01:00:34,467 --> 01:00:36,731
No, sir, ol' Bob.

719
01:00:36,802 --> 01:00:39,635
Don't even try.

720
01:00:42,575 --> 01:00:45,408
They hear everything.

721
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:48,845
They got that tracking device on ya.

722
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,849
They can find you anywhere,
anytime!

723
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,480
It's in the tooth.

724
01:00:57,556 --> 01:01:00,047
Right, Bob?

725
01:01:00,126 --> 01:01:02,754
But I fooled'em, old buddy.

726
01:01:08,034 --> 01:01:11,800
They don't have to spy on me.
I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

727
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:14,806
You see? Here it is again. See?

728
01:01:14,907 --> 01:01:17,967
Here, follow this paint trail.

729
01:01:18,077 --> 01:01:19,408
Here. It's here, see?

730
01:01:20,713 --> 01:01:22,374
I am not going--

731
01:01:23,716 --> 01:01:28,016
Come with me!
The paint trail goes here.

732
01:01:30,156 --> 01:01:33,683
Let go of my arm!
James, we shouldn't be here.

733
01:01:33,759 --> 01:01:35,750
Goddamn it!

734
01:01:44,437 --> 01:01:45,734
Leave me alone!

735
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,703
Let's get out of here.
James, we shouldn't be here.

736
01:02:05,524 --> 01:02:08,254
Please don't kill me.
Don't kill me, please!

737
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,386
Don't kill me, don't kill me!

738
01:02:16,669 --> 01:02:18,330
Stick around, bitch.

739
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,388
are you all right?

740
01:02:46,966 --> 01:02:50,231
Is he alive?

741
01:02:50,302 --> 01:02:53,328
Go ahead.
We're runnin' out of time.

742
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,407
- You can't help him.
- Oh,Jesus!

743
01:02:55,508 --> 01:02:57,066
James, you killed him!

744
01:02:57,176 --> 01:02:59,974
All I see are dead people.
Come on.

745
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,015
- Come on.
- You never had a gun before!

746
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:06,950
I have one now.
Come on. Come on!

747
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,881
" Dragons in their pleasant palaces.

748
01:03:10,956 --> 01:03:15,052
The seventh angel poured out
his vial into the air...

749
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:17,960
and there came--"
You!

750
01:03:19,331 --> 01:03:21,799
You're one of us.

751
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,449
This is it.

752
01:03:39,518 --> 01:03:41,315
Come on.

753
01:03:55,367 --> 01:03:58,131
Can we help you?

754
01:04:02,374 --> 01:04:04,808
It's just a tape.

755
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:10,706
I'm looking for
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

756
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:18,619
We don't know anything about an Army
of the Twelve Monkeys so just disappear.

757
01:04:18,691 --> 01:04:20,591
- Just want some information.
- Didn¡¯t you hear me?

758
01:04:20,659 --> 01:04:23,628
Don't hurt her!

759
01:04:25,231 --> 01:04:27,563
Please, I'm a psychiatrist.

760
01:04:27,633 --> 01:04:31,660
Just do whatever he tells you to do.
He's disturbed. He's dangerous.

761
01:04:31,737 --> 01:04:34,205
- Please just cooperate.
- You want money?

762
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,570
- We only got a few bucks.
- I told you what I want.

763
01:04:36,675 --> 01:04:40,111
Get down. Lock that door.
Lock it now!

764
01:04:42,047 --> 01:04:45,414
- I told you that Goines would get us--
- Shut up!

765
01:04:46,852 --> 01:04:50,083
- Goines?
- Jeffrey Goines?

766
01:04:52,191 --> 01:04:55,718
Jeffrey becomes this big star,
and the media latch onto him...

767
01:04:55,794 --> 01:04:57,887
because he's picketing
his own father...

768
01:04:57,963 --> 01:04:59,988
a famous
Nobel-prize-winning virologist.

769
01:05:00,065 --> 01:05:02,431
You must have seen all that on TV.

770
01:05:02,501 --> 01:05:05,265
I don't watch TV.

771
01:05:05,337 --> 01:05:06,668
Is this him?

772
01:05:06,739 --> 01:05:09,264
Yeah, that's him, that's him.

773
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:12,674
What are you gonna do to us?

774
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,747
Tell me more about Jeffrey.

775
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:20,077
Jeffrey started getting bored
with the shit we do--

776
01:05:20,185 --> 01:05:22,813
picketing, leafleting,
letter-writing stuff.

777
01:05:22,888 --> 01:05:25,721
He said we were ineffectual,
liberal jerk offs.

778
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:30,694
He wanted to do guerrilla actions
in order to educate the public.

779
01:05:30,763 --> 01:05:33,891
- Like this?
- He let 1 00 snakes loose in the Senate.

780
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,727
But we weren't into that kind of stuff.
It's counterproductive. We told him.

781
01:05:38,804 --> 01:05:42,171
So he and 1 1 guys,
they split off...

782
01:05:42,274 --> 01:05:44,401
and formed this underground army.

783
01:05:45,844 --> 01:05:49,245
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
See?

784
01:05:51,517 --> 01:05:53,917
They started planning
a "human hunt."

785
01:05:53,986 --> 01:05:56,284
They bought stun guns,
nets and bear traps.

786
01:05:56,355 --> 01:05:58,789
They were gonna go to Wall Street
and trap lawyers and bankers.

787
01:05:58,857 --> 01:06:01,348
They didn't do it, of course.
They didn't do any of it.

788
01:06:01,427 --> 01:06:05,124
Like always, Mr. Big Shot
sold his friends out.

789
01:06:05,197 --> 01:06:07,495
What does that mean?

790
01:06:07,566 --> 01:06:10,501
He goes on TV and gives this big
news conference, tells the world...

791
01:06:10,569 --> 01:06:13,561
he just realized his dad's experiments
are vital for humanity...

792
01:06:13,672 --> 01:06:16,573
and that the use of animals
is absolutely necessary...

793
01:06:16,642 --> 01:06:21,579
that from now on, he,Jeffrey Goines,
will personally supervise the labs...

794
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,581
to make sure all the little animals
aren't going to suffer.

795
01:06:30,022 --> 01:06:31,683
What is this?

796
01:06:40,766 --> 01:06:44,258
People like that aren't accessible.
You can¡¯t just barge in on them.

797
01:06:44,336 --> 01:06:47,203
- It's not how the world works.
- Be quiet and drive the car.

798
01:06:47,306 --> 01:06:49,274
- I know what I'm doing.
- No, you don't.

799
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:53,038
This car is stolen,
and we are in big trouble.

800
01:06:53,145 --> 01:06:55,113
Big trouble.

801
01:06:55,214 --> 01:06:58,741
If you don't turn yourself over to
the police, they're going to kill you.

802
01:06:58,817 --> 01:07:01,081
They're going to shoot me, too,
because I'm an accessory to murder.

803
01:07:01,153 --> 01:07:05,351
- You're all going to die.
- Nobody is going to die.

804
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,857
You're not going to save the world,
okay? You're delusional.

805
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:14,956
You've made all this up
out of bits and pieces in your head.

806
01:07:15,034 --> 01:07:17,366
- No.
- Yes!

807
01:07:17,436 --> 01:07:19,427
Let me give you an example.

808
01:07:19,505 --> 01:07:22,963
You know Jeffrey Goines. You were
both patients at County Hospital.

809
01:07:23,075 --> 01:07:27,409
Jeffrey Goines was a fruitcake.

810
01:07:27,479 --> 01:07:31,643
He told you that his father was a famous
scientist who worked with viruses...

811
01:07:31,717 --> 01:07:34,686
so you incorporated that information
to this cockeyed fantasy.

812
01:07:34,753 --> 01:07:37,313
He didn't say his father was
a scientist. He said his father was God.

813
01:07:37,389 --> 01:07:38,981
This is insane.

814
01:07:39,058 --> 01:07:42,323
Prominent psychiatrist and author
Dr. Kathryn Railly has been abducted...

815
01:07:42,394 --> 01:07:45,522
by a dangerous mental patient,
James Cole,

816
01:07:45,597 --> 01:07:47,497
Cole was under Railly's care
six years ago...

817
01:07:47,566 --> 01:07:50,763
when he made
a dramatic escape--

818
01:07:57,643 --> 01:08:01,943
- What is the matter with your leg?
- I got shot.

819
01:08:02,014 --> 01:08:03,345
Shot?

820
01:08:03,415 --> 01:08:04,848
Who shot you?

821
01:08:06,257 --> 01:08:08,987
I don't know.
It was some kind of war. Never mind.

822
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:11,459
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

823
01:08:11,528 --> 01:08:13,257
What are you doing?

824
01:08:15,399 --> 01:08:18,493
- We don't need gas.
- I thought you didn't know how to drive.

825
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:21,436
I said I was too young to drive.
I didn't say I was stupid.

826
01:08:23,274 --> 01:08:25,174
This can't go on.

827
01:08:25,242 --> 01:08:28,268
if you have a bullet in your leg,
I have to take care of it.

828
01:08:28,379 --> 01:08:31,371
I'm a doctor.
I need some supplies.

829
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,472
Meanwhile,
in Fresno, California...

830
01:08:55,572 --> 01:08:58,006
where mining engineers
continue their attempt...

831
01:08:58,075 --> 01:09:03,138
to sink a shaft parallel to the one
in which Ricky is believed trapped...

832
01:09:03,247 --> 01:09:05,807
authorities say there is still a chance
the boy might be alive,

833
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:10,046
You shouldn't put your weight on it.
You need stitches and antibiotics.

834
01:09:11,488 --> 01:09:14,616
Lucky for you,
it's near the surface.

835
01:09:19,596 --> 01:09:22,121
I love seeing the sun.

836
01:09:26,403 --> 01:09:29,031
Wait.

837
01:09:29,106 --> 01:09:31,734
Let me help you.

838
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:38,614
You smell so good.

839
01:09:40,684 --> 01:09:43,448
You have to give yourself up.

840
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:47,690
You know that?

841
01:09:53,997 --> 01:09:56,397
What are you doing? James?

842
01:09:56,467 --> 01:09:59,197
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

843
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,268
- Stop it! What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

844
01:10:04,341 --> 01:10:05,638
Let go of me!

845
01:10:12,383 --> 01:10:14,351
- They find him?
- Who?

846
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:16,976
- That kid, the one in the pipe.
- You believe that?

847
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,180
They're lowering a monkey
down there...

848
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:21,451
with an infrared camera
strapped on him...

849
01:10:21,525 --> 01:10:24,358
and a roast beef sandwich
wrapped up in tin foil.

850
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,521
- You're makin' it up.
- I shit you not, man.

851
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:30,693
- Life is really weird.
- A monkey and a roast beef sandwich.

852
01:10:40,377 --> 01:10:43,505
Would that I could enjoy
this opulent dinner...

853
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:47,948
and this most stimulating
and exciting company...

854
01:10:48,018 --> 01:10:52,182
for itself,
with no sense of purpose.

855
01:10:52,256 --> 01:10:55,851
But, alas, I am burdened.

856
01:10:57,428 --> 01:11:01,194
For with all this excess of public
attention and cacophony of praise...

857
01:11:01,265 --> 01:11:05,497
there comes great responsibility.

858
01:11:05,569 --> 01:11:09,801
I don't have to tell you all
that the dangers of science...

859
01:11:09,873 --> 01:11:12,501
are a timeworn threat.

860
01:11:12,576 --> 01:11:15,136
From Prometheus stealing fire
from the gods--

861
01:11:15,245 --> 01:11:18,942
What friend?
I'm not expecting anyone.

862
01:11:19,082 --> 01:11:21,846
But never before--

863
01:11:21,919 --> 01:11:24,080
This is ridiculous.

864
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:27,612
My father's giving
a major address.

865
01:11:27,691 --> 01:11:29,955
...to fear the power...

866
01:11:31,295 --> 01:11:33,320
we have at hand.

867
01:11:34,798 --> 01:11:36,959
Normally, if we caught a guy...

868
01:11:37,034 --> 01:11:39,127
sneaking around with no ID,
we'd bust his ass.

869
01:11:39,203 --> 01:11:41,603
Excuse my French.

870
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,663
This one says he knows you.

871
01:11:43,774 --> 01:11:47,141
Since you seem to have had
a few unusual associates...

872
01:11:47,211 --> 01:11:50,442
we certainly would not want
to arrest one of your closest pals.

873
01:12:07,598 --> 01:12:09,691
Never seen him before
in my life.

874
01:12:09,766 --> 01:12:12,428
Feel free to torture this man,
or whatever it is you do.

875
01:12:12,503 --> 01:12:15,870
I'm going back to listen to my father's
eloquent discourse on the perils of--

876
01:12:15,939 --> 01:12:19,136
I'm here about some monkeys.

877
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:22,110
- Monkeys?
- Monkeys, yes.

878
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:25,147
Twelve of them.

879
01:12:28,252 --> 01:12:30,015
Arnold.

880
01:12:30,087 --> 01:12:32,351
- You look like shit.
- You know this man?

881
01:12:32,422 --> 01:12:36,483
Of course I know this man.
Arnold Pettibone.

882
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,791
Gee, Arnie, it's black tie.
I said, " Drop by."

883
01:12:39,863 --> 01:12:43,799
But it's Dad's big do--
VI Ps, senators, secret service.

884
01:12:43,867 --> 01:12:46,802
You hungry, Arnie?

885
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:48,963
Real killer feast we're putting on.

886
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:51,633
Lots of dead lamb, dead cow,
dead pig.

887
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:53,608
Shall we?

888
01:12:53,677 --> 01:12:55,941
Hi. How are you? Hello.

889
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:59,480
Very attractive.
"The Great Escape," 1 990.

890
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:02,485
Watch it! Huh?
County Hospital? Am I right?

891
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:05,316
I can't do anything
About what you're going to do.

892
01:13:05,389 --> 01:13:08,415
I can't change anything.
I won't stop you. I can't stop you.

893
01:13:08,525 --> 01:13:11,289
- I just want the information.
- Come on.

894
01:13:11,361 --> 01:13:14,922
Hi, ladies. So nice to see you again.
Watch your step on the way down.

895
01:13:14,998 --> 01:13:17,990
All right. Who blabbed?
Bruhns? Weller?

896
01:13:18,068 --> 01:13:20,093
I just want access
to the pure virus.

897
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:23,503
- Virus?
- I need to know where and what it is.

898
01:13:23,574 --> 01:13:27,442
I get it. I see what you¡¯re up to.
It's your old plan, isn't it?

899
01:13:27,511 --> 01:13:29,502
- What plan?
- Your plan.

900
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:32,047
-I don't know what you¡¯re talking about.
-Yes, you do.

901
01:13:32,115 --> 01:13:34,174
We were in the dayroom
watching television...

902
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:37,048
and you were upset about the desecration
of the planet, which I understand.

903
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,180
Then you said, "Wouldn't it be great
to have a germ or virus...

904
01:13:40,257 --> 01:13:43,055
that would wipe out mankind
and leave the animals and trees?"

905
01:13:43,126 --> 01:13:45,390
- You're trying to confuse me.
- You were so funny.

906
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:47,692
I told you my father
was this famous virologist.

907
01:13:47,764 --> 01:13:52,064
You said, " He could make a germ,
and we could steal it."

908
01:13:52,135 --> 01:13:55,070
- You were so funny.
- They mutate! We live underground!

909
01:13:55,138 --> 01:13:57,663
The world belongs
to the dogs and cats.

910
01:13:57,741 --> 01:14:01,837
We live like worms.
I just need the information!

911
01:14:01,945 --> 01:14:05,506
-Take it easy.
-You are a nutcase, completely deranged!

912
01:14:05,616 --> 01:14:10,144
Delusional, paranoid.
Your process is all fucked up.

913
01:14:10,253 --> 01:14:13,017
Your information tray
is jammed, man.

914
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:15,388
Do you know what it is,
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

915
01:14:15,459 --> 01:14:18,292
It's a collection of space-case
do-gooders saving rain forests.

916
01:14:18,395 --> 01:14:20,590
I have nothing to do
with those bozos anymore.

917
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:25,067
I've quit being the rich-kid fall guy
for a bunch of ineffective fanatics!

918
01:14:25,135 --> 01:14:27,865
So much for your grand plot,
asshole!

919
01:14:27,938 --> 01:14:30,202
My father has warned people
about the dangers...

920
01:14:30,273 --> 01:14:32,503
of experimenting with DNA viruses
for years.

921
01:14:32,576 --> 01:14:36,171
You processed that information through
your addled, paranoid infrastructure.

922
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:38,770
Lo and behold,
a nonprofit organization...

923
01:14:38,882 --> 01:14:41,749
becomes a sinister,
revolutionary cabal!

924
01:14:41,818 --> 01:14:43,945
This man is complete bat shit!

925
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:45,648
Ladies and gentlemen...

926
01:14:45,722 --> 01:14:48,987
do you realize where he thinks
he comes from?

927
01:14:51,495 --> 01:14:54,430
Captain Dan Miller, the man
in charge of the rescue operation...

928
01:14:54,498 --> 01:14:56,625
says he has consulted with experts...

929
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,895
and they assure us
there will be no negative--

930
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:02,564
If you ask me, the monkey's gonna eat
that goddamn sandwich himself.

931
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:05,403
Did a man just come
running through here?

932
01:15:05,475 --> 01:15:09,571
His primary responsibility
was to the missing boy,

933
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,841
Police say
that the body of a woman...

934
01:15:11,948 --> 01:15:14,212
found strangled
in Knutson State Park...

935
01:15:14,284 --> 01:15:16,252
could be kidnapping victim...

936
01:15:16,353 --> 01:15:18,321
Dr. Kathryn Railly,

937
01:15:21,158 --> 01:15:24,025
Anybody see someone
come through here?

938
01:15:24,127 --> 01:15:27,324
The body was discovered
less than an hour ago by hikers,

939
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:30,230
But we have an unconfirmed report
that the victim...

940
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:32,563
a woman in her late 20s
or early 30s...

941
01:15:32,636 --> 01:15:34,604
was savagely mutilated,

942
01:15:34,671 --> 01:15:37,834
Earlier in the day, police located
Railly's abandoned car,

943
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:40,570
It was found not far from--

944
01:15:42,546 --> 01:15:43,808
Any sign of him?

945
01:15:44,948 --> 01:15:46,415
Nothing.

946
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,643
He can't just disappear.

947
01:16:09,906 --> 01:16:12,033
You bastard!

948
01:16:14,544 --> 01:16:18,605
I could have died in there,
you son of a bitch!

949
01:16:18,715 --> 01:16:21,047
What are you thinking of...

950
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:24,053
you twisted sack of shit?

951
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:29,054
Sorry I locked you in the trunk.

952
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:31,560
I'm sick of you.

953
01:16:37,567 --> 01:16:40,832
What have you done?
Did you kill somebody?

954
01:16:40,904 --> 01:16:42,496
Yes.

955
01:16:42,572 --> 01:16:45,973
- A million people, five billion people.
- What?

956
01:16:46,042 --> 01:16:51,173
Jeffrey Goines said that it
was my idea about the virus.

957
01:16:51,281 --> 01:16:56,548
We were in the institution.
It was all so fuzzy with the drugs.

958
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,713
Do you think It was my idea?

959
01:16:58,789 --> 01:17:01,519
Do you think maybe
I wiped out the human race?

960
01:17:01,591 --> 01:17:04,651
Nobody is gonna wipe out
the human race.

961
01:17:04,728 --> 01:17:07,788
Not you or Jeffrey
or anybody else.

962
01:17:07,864 --> 01:17:11,163
You've created something
in your mind.

963
01:17:11,234 --> 01:17:14,032
- Mentally divergent?
- Whatever.

964
01:17:14,104 --> 01:17:17,596
A substitute reality...

965
01:17:17,707 --> 01:17:21,370
because you don't want
to deal with anything.

966
01:17:21,444 --> 01:17:25,005
I would love it
if that was true.

967
01:17:25,115 --> 01:17:27,879
It can be dealt with,
but only if you want to.

968
01:17:27,951 --> 01:17:30,351
I can help you.

969
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:34,752
- They're after me.
- Who is after you?

970
01:17:34,825 --> 01:17:38,921
We have to get out of here.
There were policemen at that party.

971
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:43,094
Party? You went to a--

972
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:44,963
Never mind.

973
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:48,095
It's important you surrender instead
of them catching you running away.

974
01:17:48,171 --> 01:17:51,231
Wouldn't it be great if I was crazy?
Then the world would be okay.

975
01:17:51,308 --> 01:17:53,299
- Give me the gun. Where is the gun?
- I lost the gun.

976
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:55,606
I could live right here.

977
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:59,148
You got water, air, stars.

978
01:17:59,249 --> 01:18:01,410
- I'm gonna attract their attention.
- Debris.

979
01:18:01,484 --> 01:18:04,476
I'm gonna attract their attention
so they know where we are.

980
01:18:06,156 --> 01:18:07,783
I love this world!

981
01:18:07,858 --> 01:18:10,292
They're gonna tell you to put your hands
on your head. Do what they say.

982
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,419
I love the frogs, the spiders.

983
01:18:12,495 --> 01:18:14,087
I'll be with you.

984
01:18:14,164 --> 01:18:17,258
I'll help you. I won't let them--

985
01:18:28,144 --> 01:18:31,136
Then I said something about cooperating,
and he said he would do that.

986
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:34,706
So I got in the car.

987
01:18:34,818 --> 01:18:37,912
Thanks. And when I--

988
01:18:38,021 --> 01:18:42,321
I started honking the horn,
and when I got out, he was gone.

989
01:18:42,392 --> 01:18:44,690
I tell you something.
You lucked out.

990
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:47,696
For a while we thought you were a body
found down state, mutilated.

991
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:51,256
- He wouldn't do that.
- This the man he attacked?

992
01:18:55,338 --> 01:18:57,704
I want to be clear
about this, okay?

993
01:18:57,774 --> 01:19:00,106
This man and the other one
were severely beating us.

994
01:19:00,176 --> 01:19:04,135
James Cole didn't start it.
In fact, he saved me.

995
01:19:06,349 --> 01:19:07,748
Funny thing, Doctor.

996
01:19:07,817 --> 01:19:12,254
Maybe you can help explain it to me,
you being a psychiatrist and all.

997
01:19:12,355 --> 01:19:17,520
Why do kidnap victims always tell us
about the guys that grabbed 'em...

998
01:19:17,594 --> 01:19:20,654
and they try
to make us understand...

999
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:23,756
how kind these bastards really were.

1000
01:19:23,867 --> 01:19:27,098
It's a normal reaction
to a life-threatening situation.

1001
01:19:30,106 --> 01:19:32,540
He's sick, okay?

1002
01:19:33,743 --> 01:19:36,268
He thinks he comes
from the future.

1003
01:19:36,413 --> 01:19:39,382
He lives in a meticulously constructed
fantasy world that's disintegrating.

1004
01:19:39,482 --> 01:19:41,916
He needs help.

1005
01:19:49,793 --> 01:19:53,229
Exhausted but apparently unharmed
by her 30-hour ordeal...

1006
01:19:53,296 --> 01:19:57,528
Dr. Railly returned to Baltimore
without making a public statement,

1007
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,331
The author and psychiatrist
is currently in seclusion at her home,

1008
01:20:01,438 --> 01:20:05,204
Meantime, police have pieced together
a scenario of the series of events...

1009
01:20:05,275 --> 01:20:08,642
that began with escaped
mental patient James Cole--

1010
01:20:08,778 --> 01:20:10,746
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1011
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:14,374
I 'm just hyper-alert.
I can't sleep.

1012
01:20:14,484 --> 01:20:19,114
- Did you take a sedative?
- I hate those things. They mess me up.

1013
01:20:21,891 --> 01:20:24,621
With the kidnapping
of the Baltimore woman,James Cole...

1014
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:26,719
is now also wanted in connection...

1015
01:20:26,796 --> 01:20:30,288
with the brutal slaying of Rodney
Wiggins, an ex-convict from Ardmore,

1016
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:33,393
His body was discovered
in an abandoned theater...

1017
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:36,928
not far from where Cole left 3 animal
rights activists bound and gagged...

1018
01:20:37,007 --> 01:20:39,567
in their Second A venue headquarters,

1019
01:20:39,642 --> 01:20:43,806
Now, do they real ly bel ieve that he's
going to show up here? Please.

1020
01:20:43,913 --> 01:20:46,973
In Fresno, California, the cornfield
that was jammed with spectators--

1021
01:20:47,083 --> 01:20:49,278
He's dead, isn't he?
That little boy.

1022
01:20:49,352 --> 01:20:52,810
He's fine. It was just a prank
he and his friends pulled.

1023
01:20:52,922 --> 01:20:56,221
The dramatic attempts to rescue Ricky
Neumann from an abandoned mine shaft...

1024
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:58,692
ended abruptly
when playmates confessed...

1025
01:20:58,762 --> 01:21:00,787
that Neuman's disappearance
was a prank,

1026
01:21:00,864 --> 01:21:04,095
In fact, the missing child
was hiding in a nearby barn,

1027
01:21:13,176 --> 01:21:17,135
I found my thrill

1028
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:20,978
On Blueberry Hill

1029
01:21:21,051 --> 01:21:23,019
On Blueberry Hill

1030
01:21:25,055 --> 01:21:27,114
When I found you

1031
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:29,658
Congratulations, Cole.

1032
01:21:29,726 --> 01:21:32,024
Well done. Well done.

1033
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:34,893
During your interview,
while you were under the influence...

1034
01:21:34,964 --> 01:21:36,363
you told us you liked music.

1035
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,560
- This isn't a prison,James.
- This is a hospital.

1036
01:21:38,635 --> 01:21:41,695
- Until you recover your equilibrium.
- You're still a little disoriented.

1037
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:45,969
- Time travel is a very stressful thing.
- You stood up very well, considering.

1038
01:21:46,042 --> 01:21:49,068
You connected the Twelve Monkeys
with a famous virologist and his son.

1039
01:21:49,179 --> 01:21:51,704
- Others will take over now.
- We'll be back in service in months.

1040
01:21:51,815 --> 01:21:52,907
We'll retake the planet.

1041
01:21:53,016 --> 01:21:55,541
This is what you¡¯ve been working for.

1042
01:21:55,652 --> 01:21:58,143
- A full pardon.
- You'll be out of here in no time.

1043
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:01,257
- Women will want to get to know you.
- I don't want your women!

1044
01:22:01,357 --> 01:22:03,848
I want to get well!

1045
01:22:07,931 --> 01:22:10,365
And you will be well, James.

1046
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,265
Soon.

1047
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:19,904
You know, you people don't exist.
You're not real.

1048
01:22:19,976 --> 01:22:22,410
We can't travel back in time.

1049
01:22:24,447 --> 01:22:28,315
You're not here.
You can't trick me.

1050
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,817
You're in my mind.

1051
01:22:35,258 --> 01:22:39,251
I am insane,
and you are my insanity.

1052
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:51,464
He not only
used the word "prank"...

1053
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:53,634
he said the boy
was hiding in a barn.

1054
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:57,476
Kathryn, Kathryn,
he kidnapped you.

1055
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:00,140
You saw him murder somebody...

1056
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:02,310
and you knew there was
a real possibility...

1057
01:23:02,418 --> 01:23:04,852
he could kill you too.

1058
01:23:04,954 --> 01:23:07,422
You're under tremendous
emotional stress.

1059
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:09,924
For God's sake, Owen,
listen to me.

1060
01:23:09,993 --> 01:23:11,893
He knew about the boy in Fresno...

1061
01:23:11,961 --> 01:23:14,122
and he says five billion people
are gonna die.

1062
01:23:14,197 --> 01:23:16,791
No way he could possibly know that.

1063
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:22,767
You're a rational person.
You're a trained psychiatrist.

1064
01:23:22,839 --> 01:23:25,899
You know the difference
between what's real and what's not.

1065
01:23:25,975 --> 01:23:28,967
What we say is the truth
is what everybody accepts, right?

1066
01:23:29,078 --> 01:23:31,512
Psychiatry is the latest religion.

1067
01:23:31,581 --> 01:23:35,312
We decide what's right and wrong.
We decide who's crazy or not.

1068
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,847
I'm in trouble here.

1069
01:23:39,923 --> 01:23:41,857
I'm losing my faith.

1070
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:46,195
You sure fucked up, Bob,

1071
01:23:46,262 --> 01:23:48,287
But I can understand,

1072
01:23:48,364 --> 01:23:51,356
You don't want your mistakes
pointed out to you,

1073
01:23:51,434 --> 01:23:54,096
I can relate to that, old Bob,

1074
01:23:56,072 --> 01:23:58,165
I know what you¡¯re thinking',

1075
01:23:58,241 --> 01:24:02,473
You're thinking' I don't exist
except in your head,

1076
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:04,570
I can see that point of view,

1077
01:24:04,681 --> 01:24:08,583
But you could still talk to me,
couldn't ya?

1078
01:24:08,651 --> 01:24:10,516
I saw you...

1079
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:14,182
in 1 996, in the real world.

1080
01:24:14,257 --> 01:24:18,284
- You pulled out your teeth.
- Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?

1081
01:24:18,361 --> 01:24:20,454
That's a no-no,

1082
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:23,658
And when did you say you saw me?

1083
01:24:23,733 --> 01:24:26,531
- In 1 872?
- Leave me alone!

1084
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:30,198
Yellin' won't get you
what you want,

1085
01:24:30,273 --> 01:24:34,073
You have to be smart
to get what you want,

1086
01:24:36,546 --> 01:24:40,607
- What do I want?
- You don't know what you want?

1087
01:24:40,717 --> 01:24:43,686
Sure you do, Bob,

1088
01:24:43,753 --> 01:24:46,017
You know what you want,

1089
01:24:46,089 --> 01:24:49,149
You tell me.
Tell me what I want.

1090
01:24:49,259 --> 01:24:53,753
To see the sky and the ocean...

1091
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:56,458
to be topside...

1092
01:24:56,566 --> 01:24:59,057
breathe the air...

1093
01:24:59,135 --> 01:25:02,468
to be with her,

1094
01:25:02,538 --> 01:25:04,972
Isn't that right?

1095
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:08,204
Isn't that what you want?

1096
01:25:08,278 --> 01:25:10,109
Bob?

1097
01:25:27,063 --> 01:25:31,557
J im Halperin, Philly PD.
Sorry to call you so early.

1098
01:25:31,634 --> 01:25:35,195
You found him? Is he okay?

1099
01:25:35,271 --> 01:25:37,569
No, no.
Au contraire, Doctor.

1100
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,665
No sign of your good friend,
the kidnapper.

1101
01:25:39,742 --> 01:25:42,040
However, the plot does thicken.

1102
01:25:42,145 --> 01:25:44,409
I got a ballistics report here
on my desk.

1103
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:47,039
It says the bullet you claim
you removed from Cole's thigh...

1104
01:25:47,150 --> 01:25:49,118
is, in fact, an antique.

1105
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:51,085
And all indications are...

1106
01:25:51,154 --> 01:25:54,885
it was fired sometime
prior to the 1 920s,

1107
01:25:54,957 --> 01:25:57,187
- How about I take a spin down there?
- This can't be.

1108
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,251
You and I can grab a bite to eat...

1109
01:25:59,329 --> 01:26:01,593
and maybe you could revise
or amplify your statement.

1110
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:41,702
You can't trick us, you know.
It wouldn't work,

1111
01:26:41,771 --> 01:26:43,102
No, sir.

1112
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,407
You haven't become addicted,
have you...

1113
01:26:47,477 --> 01:26:49,308
to that dying world?

1114
01:26:49,412 --> 01:26:51,812
No, sir.

1115
01:26:51,881 --> 01:26:54,281
I just want to do my part
to get us back on top...

1116
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:56,409
in charge of the planet.

1117
01:26:56,519 --> 01:27:00,114
And I have the experience.
I know the people involved.

1118
01:27:01,124 --> 01:27:03,217
He really is the most qualified.

1119
01:27:03,292 --> 01:27:05,351
But all that behavior.

1120
01:27:05,428 --> 01:27:08,022
You said we weren't real.

1121
01:27:08,831 --> 01:27:11,891
I don't think the human mind
is meant to exist...

1122
01:27:11,968 --> 01:27:13,868
in two different...

1123
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:17,462
whatever you called it,
dimensions?

1124
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:20,737
It's just too stressful.
You said that yourself.

1125
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:23,438
It's very confusing. You don't know
what's real and what's not.

1126
01:27:23,546 --> 01:27:26,640
But you know what's real now.

1127
01:27:26,749 --> 01:27:28,512
Yes, sir, I do.

1128
01:27:30,987 --> 01:27:33,319
No, I don't know anything about...

1129
01:27:33,389 --> 01:27:35,983
a monkey army, Doctor.

1130
01:27:36,058 --> 01:27:38,822
No, nothing whatsoever.

1131
01:27:38,895 --> 01:27:43,229
Good Lord, if my son was ever
involved in something like that--

1132
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:47,328
Yeah? Well, I'm sorry.

1133
01:27:47,403 --> 01:27:51,601
I think it's doubly inappropriate
to discuss...

1134
01:27:51,674 --> 01:27:55,940
security matters with you,
Dr. Railly.

1135
01:27:56,045 --> 01:27:59,481
But if it will ease your mind...

1136
01:27:59,582 --> 01:28:01,982
rest assured that neither my son...

1137
01:28:02,051 --> 01:28:04,349
nor any other unauthorized person...

1138
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:09,483
has access to potentially
dangerous organisms in my laboratory.

1139
01:28:09,559 --> 01:28:13,757
Is that clear to you now?
Thank you so much for your concern.

1140
01:28:18,568 --> 01:28:21,196
Women psychiatrists!

1141
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,968
I attended a lecture
of hers once.

1142
01:28:27,043 --> 01:28:30,672
"Apocalyptic Visions."

1143
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:33,874
She was suddenly struck...

1144
01:28:33,983 --> 01:28:37,942
by the most preposterous notion
about Jeffrey.

1145
01:28:39,722 --> 01:28:42,919
Has she succumbed to her own...

1146
01:28:42,992 --> 01:28:46,985
"theoretical" Cassandra disease?

1147
01:28:49,332 --> 01:28:53,632
Maybe we ought to review
our security procedures.

1148
01:28:54,403 --> 01:28:57,270
Perhaps upgrade 'em,
you know?

1149
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:59,331
Beef'em up.

1150
01:29:04,447 --> 01:29:06,813
Let's consider again
our current information.

1151
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:09,977
If the symptoms were
first detected in Philadelphia...

1152
01:29:10,086 --> 01:29:13,783
on December 27, 1 996,
that makes us know that--

1153
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:17,417
It was released in Philadelphia
probably on December 1 3, 1 996.

1154
01:29:17,493 --> 01:29:21,429
And was seen sequentially
after that in--

1155
01:29:21,497 --> 01:29:23,431
San Francisco, New Orleans...

1156
01:29:23,499 --> 01:29:26,024
Rio deJaneiro...

1157
01:29:26,102 --> 01:29:28,730
Rome, Kinshasa...

1158
01:29:28,804 --> 01:29:30,829
Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.

1159
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:36,401
That was very well done.

1160
01:29:47,323 --> 01:29:49,689
if you're in there,
I have to talk to you!

1161
01:29:51,193 --> 01:29:55,095
It's the kidnap woman. The one
who was with the guy who tied us up.

1162
01:29:55,164 --> 01:29:57,724
Turn off the lights.
Turn off the light!

1163
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,735
- What's she doin'?
- She's drawing attention to us.

1164
01:30:00,836 --> 01:30:05,637
I don't know what you're up to,
But you're gonna get us in deep shit.

1165
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:08,905
Walkies ready,
batteries charged?

1166
01:30:08,978 --> 01:30:12,505
I saw you!
I saw somebody in there!

1167
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:16,779
Secret experiments.
That's what they do.

1168
01:30:16,852 --> 01:30:20,652
Secret, weird stuff.

1169
01:30:20,723 --> 01:30:23,487
- Not just on animals.
- I know you.

1170
01:30:23,559 --> 01:30:27,120
- Do 'em on people too down at--
- Have you seen James Cole?

1171
01:30:27,196 --> 01:30:29,357
They're watching you.

1172
01:30:29,432 --> 01:30:31,627
- Takin' pictures.
- The police.

1173
01:30:31,701 --> 01:30:33,692
I know. Look.

1174
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:38,229
I have to contact James.

1175
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:42,209
It's very, very important that
he's really careful when he reaches me.

1176
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:43,938
Do you understand that?

1177
01:30:44,046 --> 01:30:46,014
- Good.
- Who's James?

1178
01:30:46,082 --> 01:30:50,075
He was with me.
He spoke to you several weeks ago.

1179
01:30:50,186 --> 01:30:54,247
He said that you were from the future
and that you were watching him.

1180
01:31:01,263 --> 01:31:04,664
Bolt cutters.
Did you get the bolt cutters?

1181
01:31:04,734 --> 01:31:06,725
One dozen. They're in the van.

1182
01:31:06,802 --> 01:31:11,501
- The plans for the security system?
- All right here, committed to memory.

1183
01:31:11,574 --> 01:31:14,668
- You know what she's doin' out there?
- What's it say?

1184
01:31:14,744 --> 01:31:16,177
I can't see it.

1185
01:31:16,278 --> 01:31:19,645
Forget about my psychiatrist
and concentrate on the task at hand.

1186
01:31:21,617 --> 01:31:23,517
Your psychiatrist?

1187
01:31:23,586 --> 01:31:28,114
- Did you just say your psychiatrist?
- Ex-psychiatrist.

1188
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:30,055
This woman was your psychiatrist...

1189
01:31:30,126 --> 01:31:31,354
and now she's spray-painting
our building?

1190
01:31:40,136 --> 01:31:42,127
What's it say?

1191
01:31:54,817 --> 01:31:56,978
- What?
- There's a policeman over there.

1192
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,283
- Pretend you don't know me.
- I want to turn myself in.

1193
01:31:59,355 --> 01:32:02,756
- Where is he?
- James! Down!

1194
01:32:02,825 --> 01:32:05,919
No, it's okay.
I'm not crazy any more.

1195
01:32:05,995 --> 01:32:09,795
I mean, I am. I'm mentally divergent.
I know that now.

1196
01:32:09,865 --> 01:32:13,198
I want you to help me.
I want to get better.

1197
01:32:17,106 --> 01:32:19,074
Let's get outta here.

1198
01:32:19,141 --> 01:32:21,006
He's going. Go!

1199
01:32:32,555 --> 01:32:35,319
- I've seen that before.
- No, you haven't.

1200
01:32:39,261 --> 01:32:42,162
A guy in a Ford is chasing her
and some other guy I can't see.

1201
01:32:42,231 --> 01:32:45,496
No problem. It's probably
just another kidnapping...

1202
01:32:45,568 --> 01:32:47,661
featuring Jeffrey's shrink.

1203
01:32:47,737 --> 01:32:50,934
Pardon me.
Make that ex-shrink.

1204
01:32:51,006 --> 01:32:54,942
This is your leader?
A certifiable lunatic...

1205
01:32:55,044 --> 01:32:57,035
who told his former psychiatrist
all his plans...

1206
01:32:57,146 --> 01:32:59,546
for God knows what
wacko irresponsible schemes?

1207
01:32:59,615 --> 01:33:01,549
God knows what she's written
on that wall!

1208
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:04,778
Who cares what psychiatrists
write on walls?

1209
01:33:04,854 --> 01:33:07,482
You think I told her about
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

1210
01:33:07,556 --> 01:33:10,855
Impossible! Do you know why?
Do you know why?

1211
01:33:10,926 --> 01:33:13,417
Because,
you pathetically ineffectual...

1212
01:33:13,496 --> 01:33:17,193
and pusillanimous pretend friend
to animals, I'll tell you why.

1213
01:33:17,266 --> 01:33:19,700
Because when I had anything
to do with her six years ago...

1214
01:33:19,769 --> 01:33:22,033
there was no such thing,
I hadn't thought of it yet.

1215
01:33:22,104 --> 01:33:24,299
Then how come she knows
what's going on?

1216
01:33:24,373 --> 01:33:27,467
Well, here's my theory on that.

1217
01:33:27,543 --> 01:33:30,478
When I was institutionalized,
my brain was studied exhaustively...

1218
01:33:30,579 --> 01:33:32,342
in the guise of mental health.

1219
01:33:32,448 --> 01:33:35,781
I was interrogated, x-rayed.
I was examined thoroughly.

1220
01:33:37,586 --> 01:33:40,214
Then they took everything about me
and put it into a computer...

1221
01:33:40,289 --> 01:33:42,814
where they created
this model of my mind.

1222
01:33:42,925 --> 01:33:44,984
Yes! Using that model...

1223
01:33:45,094 --> 01:33:47,528
they managed to generate
every thought...

1224
01:33:47,596 --> 01:33:49,757
I could possibly have
in the next ten years...

1225
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:53,529
which they then filtered through
a probability matrix of some kind...

1226
01:33:53,602 --> 01:33:57,595
to determine everything
I was gonna do in that period.

1227
01:33:57,673 --> 01:33:59,664
So, you see...

1228
01:33:59,742 --> 01:34:01,767
she knew I was gonna lead
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...

1229
01:34:01,844 --> 01:34:04,972
into the pages of history
before it even occurred to me.

1230
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:08,516
She knows everything I'm ever gonna do
before I know it myself.

1231
01:34:08,617 --> 01:34:10,585
How's that?

1232
01:34:12,888 --> 01:34:15,413
Kweskin, you finish here.
I'll meet you there.

1233
01:34:15,491 --> 01:34:19,427
And if you forget one thing, I'll have
you shaved, sterilized and destroyed.

1234
01:34:19,495 --> 01:34:21,053
- Jeff?
- What?

1235
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:23,724
You're a great man.

1236
01:34:23,799 --> 01:34:25,790
Fuck the bozos!

1237
01:34:28,938 --> 01:34:31,964
He's seriously crazy.
You know that.

1238
01:35:02,137 --> 01:35:03,161
There. Over there.

1239
01:35:04,506 --> 01:35:06,167
Okay. Come on.

1240
01:35:18,821 --> 01:35:20,982
- I need a room.
- Thirty-five bucks an hour.

1241
01:35:21,056 --> 01:35:24,219
- An hour?
- You want quarter hours?

1242
01:35:24,293 --> 01:35:25,988
Go someplace else.

1243
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:36,833
Here's...

1244
01:35:36,906 --> 01:35:39,932
twenty-five, six, seven
for an hour.

1245
01:35:40,009 --> 01:35:41,806
Deal?

1246
01:35:46,715 --> 01:35:49,684
One hour, honey babe.
Number 64.

1247
01:35:49,752 --> 01:35:52,687
Sixth floor.
Up the stairs, end of the hall.

1248
01:35:52,755 --> 01:35:55,553
Elevator's busted.

1249
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:57,319
She's not "honey babe."

1250
01:35:57,393 --> 01:36:00,954
She's a doctor.
My psychiatrist.

1251
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:02,793
Understand?

1252
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:07,698
Whatever gets it up for you,Jack.

1253
01:36:16,345 --> 01:36:19,143
Tommy, this is Charlie
over at the Globe.

1254
01:36:20,349 --> 01:36:22,408
You know if Wallace
has a new girl?

1255
01:36:22,518 --> 01:36:26,955
Sort of a rookie type?
A little weird? Does fantasy acts?

1256
01:36:27,022 --> 01:36:30,788
Okay, you were standing there
looking up at the moon.

1257
01:36:30,859 --> 01:36:33,919
You were splashing through the water,
and then what?

1258
01:36:35,597 --> 01:36:37,792
I thought I was in prison again.

1259
01:36:37,866 --> 01:36:40,300
Just like that,
you were in prison?

1260
01:36:40,369 --> 01:36:42,963
No, not really.

1261
01:36:43,038 --> 01:36:45,734
Like you said,
It was all in my mind.

1262
01:36:47,409 --> 01:36:49,138
You disappeared.

1263
01:36:49,244 --> 01:36:52,475
One minute you were there,
the next minute you were gone.

1264
01:36:52,581 --> 01:36:54,879
Did you run through the woods, or--

1265
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:58,977
I don't know.
I don't remember.

1266
01:37:00,456 --> 01:37:03,948
The boy in the well.
How did you know that was just a hoax?

1267
01:37:04,927 --> 01:37:08,488
It was?
I didn't know.

1268
01:37:08,564 --> 01:37:10,259
You said he was hiding
in a barn!

1269
01:37:10,366 --> 01:37:12,459
I think I maybe saw a TV show
about that...

1270
01:37:12,534 --> 01:37:14,729
when I was a kid where a boy--

1271
01:37:14,803 --> 01:37:16,998
It wasn't a TV show!
It was real!

1272
01:37:17,072 --> 01:37:20,200
Maybe this boy saw
the same TV show that I did...

1273
01:37:20,275 --> 01:37:22,209
and he copied it.

1274
01:37:22,277 --> 01:37:26,179
Look, you were right.
I am mentally ill.

1275
01:37:26,248 --> 01:37:28,546
I imagined all these things,
these people.

1276
01:37:28,617 --> 01:37:31,142
I know they're not real.

1277
01:37:31,286 --> 01:37:33,880
I can trick them.

1278
01:37:33,956 --> 01:37:36,356
I can make them do what I want.
I worked on 'em a little bit.

1279
01:37:36,425 --> 01:37:38,620
I got back here to get better.

1280
01:37:38,694 --> 01:37:43,324
- I can stay here.
- What does this mean to you?

1281
01:37:51,373 --> 01:37:54,865
I think I had a dream
about this.

1282
01:37:56,645 --> 01:38:00,513
You had a bullet from World War I
in your leg. How did it get there?

1283
01:38:00,582 --> 01:38:04,382
I don't know. You said I had delusions,
that I created this world.

1284
01:38:04,453 --> 01:38:07,854
- You said you could explain.
- I can't!

1285
01:38:07,923 --> 01:38:11,188
I'm trying to, and--

1286
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:14,923
I can't believe that everything
we say or do has already happened.

1287
01:38:16,098 --> 01:38:18,123
We can't change
what's gonna happen.

1288
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:22,102
And if five billion people
are gonna die, it's--

1289
01:38:22,171 --> 01:38:24,366
I want the future to be unknown.

1290
01:38:27,876 --> 01:38:29,867
I want to become
a whole person again.

1291
01:38:31,513 --> 01:38:33,481
I want this to be the present.

1292
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:39,149
I want to stay here this time...

1293
01:38:39,221 --> 01:38:40,518
with you.

1294
01:39:09,351 --> 01:39:14,186
Do you remember six years ago
you had a phone number?

1295
01:39:14,256 --> 01:39:16,918
- It was the wrong number then.
- A woman answered.

1296
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:21,122
It was the wrong number in 1 990.
It should be the right number now.

1297
01:39:21,196 --> 01:39:23,391
Do you remember it?

1298
01:39:24,733 --> 01:39:26,394
The number.

1299
01:39:29,938 --> 01:39:33,999
This is my territory, bitch!

1300
01:39:35,344 --> 01:39:38,677
- Is this real or one of my delusions?
- This is definitely real.

1301
01:39:39,915 --> 01:39:45,717
Excuse me. I think we've got
a little misunderstanding here.

1302
01:39:45,787 --> 01:39:48,779
- Yeah. We--
- Gee, really?

1303
01:39:48,891 --> 01:39:51,883
Now, you just sit tight, chief.

1304
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,088
You listen to me,
little Miss Understanding.

1305
01:39:55,164 --> 01:39:58,497
You think you can go around me and
Peddle your ass in this part of town?

1306
01:39:58,567 --> 01:40:00,762
You bet your life we got
what I would call...

1307
01:40:00,836 --> 01:40:02,997
a major fuckin' misunderstanding.

1308
01:40:06,408 --> 01:40:08,399
James, no! Don't!

1309
01:40:11,346 --> 01:40:13,405
Put him in the closet.
Take his money first!

1310
01:40:14,383 --> 01:40:18,479
- You want me to rob him?
- We need cash!

1311
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:21,955
Call the cops!
Call the cops!

1312
01:40:22,024 --> 01:40:24,788
What's goin' on?

1313
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:27,260
I've got friends, man.

1314
01:40:27,329 --> 01:40:29,729
Don't fuckin' kill me.

1315
01:40:29,798 --> 01:40:32,232
No,James!

1316
01:40:34,236 --> 01:40:35,999
Open the door!

1317
01:40:36,071 --> 01:40:38,801
What the fuck are you doing?

1318
01:40:38,874 --> 01:40:41,968
Please don't hurt him.
Open the door.

1319
01:40:42,044 --> 01:40:44,035
James, come on.

1320
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,654
Just in case--

1321
01:40:53,722 --> 01:40:57,715
Just in case I'm not crazy,
this is how they find us.

1322
01:40:57,793 --> 01:41:00,728
By our teeth.

1323
01:41:00,796 --> 01:41:03,458
I don't want them to find me ever.

1324
01:41:05,367 --> 01:41:06,959
I don't want to go back.

1325
01:41:14,543 --> 01:41:17,808
Step back.
You'd better load.

1326
01:41:19,681 --> 01:41:23,048
Police! Throw your weapons out
and come on out!

1327
01:41:29,024 --> 01:41:32,323
Hey! Is that the cops?

1328
01:41:32,394 --> 01:41:34,191
I'm the innocent victim here.

1329
01:41:34,263 --> 01:41:36,993
I was attacked
by a coked-up whore...

1330
01:41:37,065 --> 01:41:39,158
and a fuckin' crazy dentist.

1331
01:41:53,315 --> 01:41:55,249
Try to blend in.

1332
01:41:55,317 --> 01:41:58,684
Oh,Jesus!
Come on.

1333
01:42:00,188 --> 01:42:03,385
There's gotta be a phone
around here somewhere.

1334
01:42:03,458 --> 01:42:05,824
Over there. Look.

1335
01:42:05,894 --> 01:42:08,021
I'm gonna try that number, okay?

1336
01:42:08,096 --> 01:42:10,087
Let's hope it's nothing.

1337
01:42:38,994 --> 01:42:41,360
It's okay! We're insane.

1338
01:42:41,430 --> 01:42:43,625
We're crazy.
It's a carpet cleaning company.

1339
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:46,190
- A carpet cleaning company?
- Yeah. No superiors.

1340
01:42:46,268 --> 01:42:49,396
No scientists.
No men from the future.

1341
01:42:49,471 --> 01:42:52,372
It's just a carpet cleaning company.
They have voice mail.

1342
01:42:52,474 --> 01:42:55,500
You leave a message telling
Where you want your carpet cleaned.

1343
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:58,078
- You left them a message?
- Yeah, I couldn't resist.

1344
01:42:58,146 --> 01:43:00,239
Wait till they hearth is nutty woman
telling them to watch out...

1345
01:43:00,349 --> 01:43:03,614
For the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

1346
01:43:03,685 --> 01:43:07,451
I said, "The Freedom for Animals
Association on Second Avenue--"

1347
01:43:07,522 --> 01:43:11,390
"Is the secret headquarters of
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

1348
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:14,054
They're the ones
who are gonna do it.

1349
01:43:14,129 --> 01:43:17,030
I can't do anything more now.
I have to go.

1350
01:43:17,099 --> 01:43:19,533
Have a merry Christmas."

1351
01:43:24,106 --> 01:43:26,097
You couldn't have heard me.

1352
01:43:31,179 --> 01:43:33,147
They got your message.

1353
01:43:34,816 --> 01:43:37,614
They played it for me.

1354
01:43:37,686 --> 01:43:40,917
It was a bad recording, distorted.

1355
01:43:42,824 --> 01:43:44,815
I didn't recognize your voice.

1356
01:44:03,245 --> 01:44:06,078
This.

1357
01:44:06,181 --> 01:44:07,944
And this.

1358
01:44:10,819 --> 01:44:13,481
And this.

1359
01:44:13,555 --> 01:44:15,546
Is everything okay?
You want anything?

1360
01:44:20,395 --> 01:44:22,420
Shall I put this
on your account, ma'am?

1361
01:44:22,497 --> 01:44:24,727
No. That'll be cash.

1362
01:44:29,237 --> 01:44:31,228
Can you tell me what floor
the wigs are on?

1363
01:44:42,117 --> 01:44:44,779
You turned the thing
into a fucking computer.

1364
01:44:44,853 --> 01:44:47,447
- And Fale believed it.
- You know Fale.

1365
01:44:47,522 --> 01:44:51,959
He's like, "if you guys get nailed,
which I'm pretty sure you will...

1366
01:44:52,027 --> 01:44:54,962
I've never seen you before
in my fuckin' life."

1367
01:44:59,034 --> 01:45:01,298
Come on, come on.

1368
01:45:01,369 --> 01:45:03,166
Bring him through.

1369
01:45:06,241 --> 01:45:07,401
Drive!

1370
01:45:12,447 --> 01:45:15,678
What's the harm in openin' up the bag?
His eyes are taped, right?

1371
01:45:17,219 --> 01:45:18,709
Right?

1372
01:45:25,927 --> 01:45:27,861
Hello. Hello.

1373
01:45:29,464 --> 01:45:31,455
Wanna hear the monkey speak?

1374
01:45:34,102 --> 01:45:36,332
Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, I know that's you.

1375
01:45:36,404 --> 01:45:38,702
- I recognize your voice.
- No, you don't.

1376
01:45:38,773 --> 01:45:42,174
I also know all about
Your warped little plan.

1377
01:45:42,244 --> 01:45:44,371
That lady, your psychiatrist?

1378
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:46,947
She told me.
I didn't believe her.

1379
01:45:47,015 --> 01:45:50,348
It just seemed too crazy,
even for you.

1380
01:45:50,418 --> 01:45:52,886
But just in case, I took steps...

1381
01:45:52,988 --> 01:45:55,354
to make sure that
you couldn't go through with it.

1382
01:45:55,423 --> 01:45:58,620
I don't have the code any more.

1383
01:45:58,693 --> 01:46:00,854
I don't have access
to the virus.

1384
01:46:00,929 --> 01:46:04,092
I took myself out of the loop.

1385
01:46:04,199 --> 01:46:07,032
Too late! Too late!

1386
01:46:07,102 --> 01:46:09,127
We've got plans for you, Dad.

1387
01:46:18,179 --> 01:46:21,615
I never let myself believe it.
Now I know it's true.

1388
01:46:21,683 --> 01:46:23,674
Jeffrey?

1389
01:46:23,785 --> 01:46:26,276
You're completely insane.

1390
01:46:30,859 --> 01:46:32,292
No, I'm not.

1391
01:46:36,598 --> 01:46:40,625
There's a cross section of one of
the old trees that's been cut down,

1392
01:46:49,444 --> 01:46:51,435
Here I was born,

1393
01:46:53,014 --> 01:46:55,608
And there I died,

1394
01:46:55,717 --> 01:46:58,208
It was only a moment for you,

1395
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,220
You took no notice,

1396
01:47:05,026 --> 01:47:07,756
I think I 've seen this movie before.

1397
01:47:07,829 --> 01:47:11,629
- When I was a kid, I saw it on TV.
- Don't talk.

1398
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:14,726
- I did see it before.
- Tall trees,

1399
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:16,600
have you been here before?

1400
01:47:16,671 --> 01:47:18,332
- Yes,
- When?

1401
01:47:19,941 --> 01:47:23,274
- But I don't recognize this--
- When were you born?

1402
01:47:23,345 --> 01:47:25,142
- Long ago,
- Where?

1403
01:47:25,246 --> 01:47:27,146
What's the matter?

1404
01:47:27,215 --> 01:47:29,479
Tell me,
Madeleine, tell me,

1405
01:47:29,551 --> 01:47:32,679
It's just like
what's happening with us.

1406
01:47:32,754 --> 01:47:34,551
Like the past.

1407
01:47:36,057 --> 01:47:38,491
The movie never changes.
It can't change.

1408
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:43,156
But every time you see it, it seems
different because you're different.

1409
01:47:43,231 --> 01:47:45,791
You see different things.

1410
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:47,595
Please don't ask me,

1411
01:47:47,669 --> 01:47:50,638
if you can't change anything
because it's already happened...

1412
01:47:50,705 --> 01:47:52,696
you may as well
smell the flowers.

1413
01:47:52,774 --> 01:47:54,435
What flowers?

1414
01:47:56,177 --> 01:47:58,042
It's an expression.

1415
01:48:12,027 --> 01:48:14,757
Why are you doing this?

1416
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:17,422
I want to know why.

1417
01:48:17,499 --> 01:48:20,366
What ifI'm wrong?
What if you're wrong?

1418
01:48:20,435 --> 01:48:22,528
What if I am crazy?

1419
01:48:22,604 --> 01:48:26,370
In a few weeks,
it will have started or it won't.

1420
01:48:26,441 --> 01:48:28,068
If there's still...

1421
01:48:30,045 --> 01:48:32,639
football games, traffic jams...

1422
01:48:32,747 --> 01:48:34,806
TV shows
and armed robberies...

1423
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:36,816
we're going to be so glad...

1424
01:48:36,885 --> 01:48:38,944
that we'll be thrilled
to see the police.

1425
01:48:39,054 --> 01:48:40,919
I'm responsible for you now.

1426
01:48:40,989 --> 01:48:44,083
The Chinese say
Once you've saveda person's life...

1427
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:46,184
you're responsible for it forever,
so I'm committed,

1428
01:48:46,261 --> 01:48:47,819
Do you have a plan?

1429
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:49,921
I have to know.

1430
01:48:49,998 --> 01:48:51,989
There's so little that I know.

1431
01:48:54,269 --> 01:48:56,931
You said
you'd never seen the ocean.

1432
01:48:58,573 --> 01:49:00,666
Hurry up. Come on.

1433
01:49:11,052 --> 01:49:12,747
Jeffrey?

1434
01:49:13,488 --> 01:49:15,888
You know I can't see.
Where are we?

1435
01:49:15,957 --> 01:49:18,983
Jeffrey? Please.

1436
01:49:46,521 --> 01:49:48,512
We have 9:30 reservations
for KeyWest.

1437
01:50:01,569 --> 01:50:04,902
I just didn't recognize you.

1438
01:50:06,141 --> 01:50:08,473
Well, you look
pretty different yourself.

1439
01:50:13,348 --> 01:50:15,316
It was always you.

1440
01:50:15,416 --> 01:50:17,475
In my dream.

1441
01:50:21,356 --> 01:50:23,347
It was always you.

1442
01:50:27,061 --> 01:50:28,995
I remember you like this.

1443
01:50:29,063 --> 01:50:30,860
You do?

1444
01:50:30,932 --> 01:50:33,366
I felt I've known you before.

1445
01:50:36,738 --> 01:50:38,933
I feel like I've always known you.

1446
01:50:50,785 --> 01:50:52,753
I'm so scared.

1447
01:51:26,421 --> 01:51:28,412
What time's your flight, friends?

1448
01:51:28,489 --> 01:51:30,889
- 9:30.
- Might be tight.

1449
01:51:30,959 --> 01:51:34,588
Tight? No.
My watch says 7:30.

1450
01:51:34,662 --> 01:51:38,120
On your normal mornin', okay.
Plenty of time.

1451
01:51:38,199 --> 01:51:42,226
But today you gotta take into account
your Army of the Twelve Monkeys factor.

1452
01:51:42,303 --> 01:51:44,897
What? What'd you say?

1453
01:51:44,973 --> 01:51:46,634
Twelve Monkeys.

1454
01:51:46,708 --> 01:51:49,734
In case you folks didn't turn on
your radio this mornin'.

1455
01:51:49,811 --> 01:51:53,269
Bunch of weirdos let
all the animals out of the zoo.

1456
01:51:53,381 --> 01:51:56,316
Then they locked up this
big-shot scientist in one of the cages.

1457
01:51:56,384 --> 01:51:58,875
Scientist's own kid
one of the ones did it.

1458
01:51:58,987 --> 01:52:02,582
They've got animals
all over the place.

1459
01:52:02,657 --> 01:52:05,455
Bunch of zebras closed down
the thruway about an hour ago.

1460
01:52:05,526 --> 01:52:07,858
And they got some thing
called an emu.

1461
01:52:07,929 --> 01:52:12,059
It's got traffic blocked
for miles on 676.

1462
01:52:12,166 --> 01:52:14,600
What do they think they're accomplishing
By releasing an animal like this...

1463
01:52:14,669 --> 01:52:17,638
into a city like this one?

1464
01:52:17,705 --> 01:52:20,105
That's what they were up to--
freeing animals.

1465
01:52:20,174 --> 01:52:24,668
On the walls. It said, "We did it."
They meant the animals.

1466
01:52:33,755 --> 01:52:36,519
I think it's gonna be all right.

1467
01:52:39,928 --> 01:52:43,625
Tell your people if they spot either one
of them not to try and apprehend them.

1468
01:52:43,698 --> 01:52:46,326
They should notify us.
We have people all over the airport.

1469
01:52:46,401 --> 01:52:47,527
We'll take care of it.

1470
01:53:14,329 --> 01:53:16,991
- I know this place.
- Airports all look the same.

1471
01:53:18,199 --> 01:53:20,030
This is my dream.

1472
01:53:24,906 --> 01:53:27,340
- Your mustache.
- It's not just my dream.

1473
01:53:28,943 --> 01:53:31,605
I was actually here.
I remember now.

1474
01:53:33,281 --> 01:53:37,581
About a week or two
before everyone started dying.

1475
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:42,687
Careful.
They might be looking for us.

1476
01:53:42,757 --> 01:53:46,193
- I was here as a kid.
- Use this.

1477
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:49,821
I think you were here then too.

1478
01:53:51,232 --> 01:53:53,564
If they identify us,
they're going to send us someplace...

1479
01:53:53,634 --> 01:53:55,625
but it won't be KeyWest.

1480
01:54:00,108 --> 01:54:01,769
I'll go fix this.

1481
01:54:01,843 --> 01:54:05,244
I'm gonna get the tickets.
I'll meet you in the newspaper stand.

1482
01:54:17,325 --> 01:54:20,385
Judy Simmons.
I have reservations for KeyWest.

1483
01:54:31,339 --> 01:54:34,934
- I don't see a lot of this. It's cash.
- It's a long story.

1484
01:54:35,009 --> 01:54:37,341
We'll begin boarding
in about 20 minutes.

1485
01:54:37,445 --> 01:54:39,675
- You have a nice flight, Miss Simmons.
- Thank you.

1486
01:54:44,519 --> 01:54:46,646
Hello. How are you today?

1487
01:54:49,157 --> 01:54:51,421
I don't know whether
you're there or not.

1488
01:54:51,492 --> 01:54:53,585
Maybe you just clean carpets.

1489
01:54:53,661 --> 01:54:56,755
if you do, you're lucky.
You're gonna live a long, happy life.

1490
01:54:56,831 --> 01:54:59,299
But if you other guys are out there,
if you're picking this up...

1491
01:54:59,367 --> 01:55:01,426
forget about
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

1492
01:55:01,502 --> 01:55:04,562
They didn't do it. It was a mistake.
Someone else did it.

1493
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:06,937
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys
is just a bunch of dumb kids...

1494
01:55:07,008 --> 01:55:09,101
playing revolutionaries.

1495
01:55:12,213 --> 01:55:16,650
Listen, I've done my job.
I did what you wanted.

1496
01:55:16,717 --> 01:55:19,185
Good luck.
I'm not coming back.

1497
01:55:20,688 --> 01:55:22,781
San Francisco, New Orleans...

1498
01:55:22,857 --> 01:55:25,792
Rio deJaneiro, Rome...

1499
01:55:25,860 --> 01:55:29,227
Kinshasa, Karachi,
Bangkok and Peking.

1500
01:55:29,297 --> 01:55:32,460
This is some trip you're taking, sir.
Is this all in one week?

1501
01:55:32,533 --> 01:55:34,694
Business.

1502
01:55:35,736 --> 01:55:38,204
Have a good one, sir.

1503
01:55:52,286 --> 01:55:55,050
Got yourself prob, Bob?

1504
01:55:57,091 --> 01:55:58,683
Leave me alone!

1505
01:55:58,759 --> 01:56:00,954
I made a report.
I didn't have to do that.

1506
01:56:01,028 --> 01:56:02,723
Point of fact:

1507
01:56:02,797 --> 01:56:05,163
You don't belong here.

1508
01:56:05,233 --> 01:56:08,327
It's not permitted to let you stay.

1509
01:56:08,402 --> 01:56:10,632
This is the present.

1510
01:56:10,705 --> 01:56:13,970
This is not the past.
This is not the future.

1511
01:56:14,041 --> 01:56:15,565
This is right now!

1512
01:56:15,643 --> 01:56:18,305
I'm not leaving! Get that?

1513
01:56:18,412 --> 01:56:21,279
You can't stop me.

1514
01:56:21,349 --> 01:56:23,840
Anything you say, chief.
It's none of my business.

1515
01:56:34,562 --> 01:56:36,826
- Hey, Cole.
- Leave me alone!

1516
01:56:36,898 --> 01:56:38,889
Calm down, Cole. It's me.

1517
01:56:38,966 --> 01:56:40,957
Cole, it's me.

1518
01:56:42,637 --> 01:56:46,903
- Jose?
- Yeah, right,Jose.

1519
01:56:46,974 --> 01:56:50,535
Why'd you pull out the tooth?
That was nuts.

1520
01:56:50,645 --> 01:56:53,671
- Here, take this.
- What for? are you crazy?

1521
01:56:53,781 --> 01:56:55,248
Me? are you kidding?

1522
01:56:55,349 --> 01:56:59,080
You're the one.
You're a hero, man.

1523
01:56:59,153 --> 01:57:02,020
They pardoned you, and you
come back and fuck with your teeth.

1524
01:57:02,089 --> 01:57:05,286
- How did you find me?
- The phone call, man.

1525
01:57:05,359 --> 01:57:07,884
They did their
reconstruction thing on it.

1526
01:57:07,962 --> 01:57:12,058
The phone--
The phone call I just made?

1527
01:57:12,133 --> 01:57:14,533
- Five minutes ago.
- Yeah, five minutes ago.

1528
01:57:14,602 --> 01:57:17,469
Thirty years ago.
They just put it together.

1529
01:57:17,538 --> 01:57:19,529
" Uh, hey, this is Cole,James.

1530
01:57:19,607 --> 01:57:22,132
I don't know whether you're there
or not. Maybe you just clean carpets."

1531
01:57:22,210 --> 01:57:24,075
Where'd you get that from?

1532
01:57:24,178 --> 01:57:27,705
" Forget about the Army
of the Twelve Monkeys."

1533
01:57:27,815 --> 01:57:30,682
Man, if only they could've
got your message earlier.

1534
01:57:30,751 --> 01:57:33,117
Take it. You could still be
a hero if you cooperate!

1535
01:57:34,755 --> 01:57:36,746
Come on,James.
It's okay.

1536
01:57:49,503 --> 01:57:52,267
- $6.50's your change. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1537
01:58:03,017 --> 01:58:07,511
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is ready for boarding at gate 38,

1538
01:58:11,892 --> 01:58:14,224
Oh, my God!

1539
01:58:14,295 --> 01:58:18,288
I got orders to shoot the lady
if you don't go along this time.

1540
01:58:18,366 --> 01:58:20,095
- What?
- Yeah, you got that?

1541
01:58:20,167 --> 01:58:22,795
- They said, "If Cole don't obey--"
- I'll break your fuckin' head!

1542
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:24,667
You hear me?

1543
01:58:25,973 --> 01:58:29,204
Volunteers now boarding
at gate 37,

1544
01:58:30,878 --> 01:58:33,244
You see?
I had no choice.

1545
01:58:33,314 --> 01:58:36,613
These are my orders, man.
Just take it.

1546
01:58:36,684 --> 01:58:37,912
Take it!

1547
01:58:42,056 --> 01:58:45,184
This part isn't about
the virus at all, is it?

1548
01:58:45,259 --> 01:58:49,252
It's about following orders,
about doing what you¡¯re told.

1549
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:52,458
Hey, man, you got a pardon.
What do you want?

1550
01:58:52,533 --> 01:58:55,696
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Who am I supposed to shoot?

1551
01:58:55,770 --> 01:58:58,170
James! It's Dr. Goines' assistant.

1552
01:58:58,239 --> 01:59:01,470
He's an apocalypse nut.
I think he's involved.

1553
01:59:01,542 --> 01:59:04,204
The next flight to San Francisco
leaves from gate 38.

1554
01:59:04,312 --> 01:59:05,574
If he's there,
I'm sure he's part of it.

1555
01:59:17,058 --> 01:59:19,219
Mr. Holtz, you wanna have
a look at this, please?

1556
01:59:21,262 --> 01:59:25,665
Sir, would you mind letting me have
a look at the contents of your bag?

1557
01:59:25,733 --> 01:59:27,826
We don't have time for this.

1558
01:59:27,902 --> 01:59:30,393
Excuse me.

1559
01:59:34,742 --> 01:59:37,404
Biological samples.

1560
01:59:37,545 --> 01:59:39,570
I have the papers right here.

1561
01:59:40,648 --> 01:59:44,277
I'm gonna have to ask you
to open this up, sir.

1562
01:59:44,385 --> 01:59:46,512
Open it?

1563
01:59:46,587 --> 01:59:48,817
Why, yes, of course.

1564
01:59:49,890 --> 01:59:53,519
What could be better?
Look at the planes. Hurry up.

1565
01:59:53,594 --> 01:59:56,859
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am, you have to get in the line.

1566
01:59:56,931 --> 01:59:58,694
You see?

1567
01:59:58,766 --> 02:00:01,564
Biological.
Check the papers.

1568
02:00:01,635 --> 02:00:04,604
It's all proper.
I have a permit.

1569
02:00:09,844 --> 02:00:13,177
- It's empty.
- Well, yes, to be sure.

1570
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:18,217
It looks empty,
but I assure you, it's not.

1571
02:00:18,319 --> 02:00:20,287
- You don't understand.
- I don't have to.

1572
02:00:20,388 --> 02:00:24,552
This is very important.
There's a man carrying a deadly virus.

1573
02:00:24,625 --> 02:00:29,528
There, you see?
Also invisible to the naked eye.

1574
02:00:31,832 --> 02:00:36,292
It doesn't even have an odor.

1575
02:00:36,370 --> 02:00:39,771
That's not necessary, sir.
There you go.

1576
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:43,071
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a good flight.

1577
02:00:51,452 --> 02:00:54,649
- Who are you calling a moron?
- I am calling you a fucking moron!

1578
02:00:54,722 --> 02:00:57,190
- A fucking moron?
- Get your hands off her!

1579
02:01:00,327 --> 02:01:02,318
Hold it!
Wait a moment.

1580
02:01:18,379 --> 02:01:21,109
There he is! That man!
He's carrying a deadly virus!

1581
02:01:21,215 --> 02:01:24,082
Stop him!
Somebody, please stop him!

1582
02:01:24,852 --> 02:01:27,412
Police officer.

1583
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:34,751
He's got a gun!

1584
02:01:42,970 --> 02:01:44,733
Watch it!

1585
02:01:55,349 --> 02:01:57,317
Freeze!

1586
02:04:14,722 --> 02:04:16,485
Excuse me.

1587
02:04:16,557 --> 02:04:18,491
It's obscene.

1588
02:04:18,559 --> 02:04:20,993
All the violence,
all the lunacy.

1589
02:04:21,729 --> 02:04:24,926
Shootings even at airports now.

1590
02:04:24,999 --> 02:04:28,765
You might say that we're
the next endangered species.

1591
02:04:28,836 --> 02:04:30,804
Human beings.

1592
02:04:33,540 --> 02:04:35,940
I think you¡¯re right, ma'am.

1593
02:04:37,277 --> 02:04:40,246
I think you've hit the nail
on the head.

1594
02:04:42,483 --> 02:04:44,451
Jones is my name.

1595
02:04:49,556 --> 02:04:52,116
I'm in insurance.

1596
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:37,440
Thank you
