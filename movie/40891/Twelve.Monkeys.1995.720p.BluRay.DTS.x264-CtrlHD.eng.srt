1
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:21,115
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is now ready for boarding at --

2
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:25,846
Inmate number 87645 --
Cole, James.

3
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:46,403
- Jose, what's going on?
- Bad news, man.

4
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:50,307
- Volunteers?
- Yeah. And they said your name.

5
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,210
Maybe they'll giveyou
a pardon, man.

6
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:06,225
Yeah. That's why none ofthe volunteers
come back. They all get a pardon.

7
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:09,160
Some come back, I heard.

8
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:13,222
Please put me back!
Don't take me!

9
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:19,569
They got'em up on the seventh floor.
They hide'em up there.

10
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,698
They're all messed up in the head.

11
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:24,538
You don't know they're all messed up.
Nobody's seen'em.

12
00:03:24,644 --> 00:03:27,078
And maybe they're not messed up.
That's a rumor. Nobody knows that.

13
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:29,581
I don't believe that.

14
00:03:30,817 --> 00:03:32,717
Good luck, man.

15
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:37,052
- Volunteer duty!
- I didn't volunteer.

16
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:39,785
You causing trouble again?

17
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:43,090
No, no trouble.

18
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:50,066
These are the instructions
for the first time probe.

19
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:54,095
Listen Carefully,
They must be following exactly.

20
00:03:54,174 --> 00:03:58,736
All openings of your garment
must be sealed completely.

21
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:03,305
If the integrity of the suit
is compromised in any way...

22
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:07,682
if the fabric is torn
or a zipper not closed...

23
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:09,949
readmittance will be denied.

24
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:46,797
If there are any indications
of contamination by germs...

25
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:49,858
the subject will be denied
reentry to secure population.

26
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:53,838
Please place blood sample
in receptacle provided.

27
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:57,637
There will be a socialization
class in room 700...

28
00:08:57,744 --> 00:09:02,272
for citizens cited
for deviations 23-A and 96-A...

29
00:09:02,382 --> 00:09:05,783
per Subchapter 6
of the Permanent Emergency Code.

30
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:09,413
James Cole
cleared from quarantine.

31
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,287
Thank you.
You two wait outside.

32
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,158
He's got a history, Doctor.
Violence.

33
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,528
Antisocial six.

34
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:23,000
Repeated violations of
the Permanent Emergency Code.

35
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:25,003
Insolence. Defiance.

36
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:26,868
Disregard of authority.

37
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:29,066
Doing 25 to life.

38
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:31,405
I don't think
he's gonna hurt us.

39
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:34,605
You aren't gonna hurt us,
are you, Mr. Cole?

40
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,750
No, sir.

41
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:52,825
Why don'tyou sit down,
Mr. Cole?

42
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:20,356
We appreciateyourvolunteering.
You're a very good observer.

43
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:23,691
- Thank you.
- We have a very advanced program.

44
00:10:23,763 --> 00:10:27,927
- Something very different.
- A chance to reduceyour sentence.

45
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,195
And possibly play
an important role...

46
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,863
in returning the human race
to the surface ofthe Earth.

47
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:36,773
We want tough-minded people.
Strong mentally.

48
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:44,042
We've had some misfortunes
with unstable types.

49
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:47,211
For a man in your position,
an opportunity.

50
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:51,313
Not to volunteer
could be a real mistake.

51
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,120
Definitely a mistake.

52
00:10:57,997 --> 00:11:00,488
"Yet among
the myriad microwaves...

53
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:05,162
the infrared messages,
the gigabytes of ones and zeros...

54
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:08,105
we find words, byte-sized now...

55
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:10,540
tinier even than science...

56
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:13,476
Iurking in some
vague electricity.

57
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:15,707
But ifwe but listen...

58
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:19,148
we hear the solitaryvoice
ofthat poet telling us...

59
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,216
yesterday this day's madness
did prepare...

60
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:30,285
tomorrow's silent
triumph of despair.

61
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:34,025
Drink, for you know not
whenceyou came, norwhy.

62
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,399
Drink, for you know not
whyyou go, norwhere."

63
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:49,708
Wandering around in nothing
but his underpants...

64
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:53,218
and one ofthose plastic,
see-through lady's raincoats.

65
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:57,086
So, they get there, they ask the guy
real nice for some kind of ID.

66
00:11:57,156 --> 00:12:00,182
He gets agitated,
starts screaming about viruses.

67
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:02,489
Totally irrational,
totally disoriented.

68
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:06,430
Doesn't know where he is,
what day ofthe week it is.

69
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:08,729
All they got was his name.

70
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:13,329
They figured he's stoned out ofhis
mind. Some kind of psychotic episode.

71
00:12:13,406 --> 00:12:16,671
- He's been tested for drugs?
- Negative for drugs.

72
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:20,576
But he took on five cops
like he was dusted to the eyeballs.

73
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:24,275
- No drugs. You believe that?
- He's in restraints.

74
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,652
Yeah. Weren'tyou listenin'? I've got
two police officers in the hospital!

75
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:34,125
The medic gave him enough Stelazine
to kill a horse. He's rarin' to go.

76
00:12:34,193 --> 00:12:38,129
That would explain the bruises, I guess.
The struggle.

77
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:41,655
Yeah. You wanna go in there,
examine him?

78
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:43,998
Yes, please.

79
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,801
Is this all you have?
Ran it through your system?

80
00:12:47,874 --> 00:12:53,107
No matchup. No license, no prints,
no warrants. Nothing.

81
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:56,875
- I should probably go in with you.
- No, Thank you.

82
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:59,076
- That won't be necessary.
- All right.

83
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:02,780
He'll be right here,
just in case.

84
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:17,561
Mr. Cole, my name is Kathryn Railly.
I'm a psychiatrist.

85
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:20,231
I work for the county.
I don't work for the police.

86
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:22,866
So my concern is for yourwell-being.
Doyou understand that?

87
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:26,035
Need to go!
Need to go!

88
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:29,739
I can't make the police
letyou go.

89
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:33,012
But I do wanna help you,
so I--

90
00:13:33,085 --> 00:13:36,020
I need you to tell me exactly
what happened tonight.

91
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:39,580
Doyou think
you can do that,James?

92
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:42,183
May I call you James?

93
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:48,299
James.
Nobody ever calls me that.

94
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:52,531
- Haveyou been a patient at County?
- No.

95
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:56,666
- Have I seen you someplace?
- Not possible.

96
00:13:56,776 --> 00:14:00,837
I need to go! I'm supposed
to be gathering information.

97
00:14:00,947 --> 00:14:04,280
- What kind ofinformation?
- Won't help you.

98
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,444
Won't help anyone.
Won't change anything.

99
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:13,023
James, doyou know
whyyou're here?

100
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:17,722
'Cause I'm a good observer.
I've got a tough mind.

101
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:21,563
You don't remember
assaulting a police officer?

102
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:25,798
Why am I chained?
Why are these chains on me?

103
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:28,203
You've been in an institution
before, haven'tyou?

104
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:31,471
- Or hospital?
- No! Now I need to go. Need to go!

105
00:14:31,577 --> 00:14:34,444
- Haveyou been in prison,James?
- Underground.

106
00:14:34,513 --> 00:14:36,310
Hiding?

107
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,410
I love this air.

108
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:44,513
Oh, it's such wonderful air.

109
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,425
- What's wonderful about the air,James?
- Very fresh. No germs.

110
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:56,864
Why doyou think there aren't
any germs in the air?

111
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:59,496
- This is October, right?
- April.

112
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:03,531
- Whatyear is this?
- Whatyear doyou think it is?

113
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:05,509
1 996.

114
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:09,514
That's the future,James. Doyou
thinkyou're living in the future?

115
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:11,515
1 996 is the past.

116
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:15,680
No, 1 996 is the future.

117
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:17,950
This is 1 990.

118
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:26,295
- Shut up, ladies.
- Where'reyou taking me?

119
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:28,856
South of France, buddy.
Fancy hotel. You'll love it.

120
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:31,596
I can't go to France. I just need
to make a telephone call.

121
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,130
Yeah, yeah. Zip it, Daisy. You fooled
the shrink, butyou don't fool us.

122
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:43,015
Let's go, ace.

123
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,604
All right.
Come on, come on.

124
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:19,207
Thereyou go.
Now, lemme seeyour head,Jimbo.

125
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:22,947
- See ifyou got any creepy crawlers.
- I need to make a telephone call.

126
00:16:23,022 --> 00:16:26,958
Got to get to a doctor,Jimbo. Can't
make no calls till the doctor says.

127
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:28,459
It's very important!

128
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:34,124
Whatyou gotta do,Jimbo,
is take it easy. Relax into things.

129
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,395
And we'll all get along fine
ifyou just relax.

130
00:16:45,978 --> 00:16:48,276
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.

131
00:16:52,485 --> 00:16:55,215
Hey, Goines!

132
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:57,016
Yo, Goines!

133
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:59,057
Yo,Jeffrey!

134
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:04,853
- What?
- Look here.

135
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:09,094
This here's James. Now, do me a favor.
Why don'tyou show him around?

136
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:11,693
Tell him the TV rules.
Show him the games and stuff. Okay?

137
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,671
How much you gonna pay me?
How much? I'd be doin' yourjob.

138
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,436
- Five thousand dollars. That enough?
- Five thousand?

139
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:19,534
I'll wire a cheque
toyour account as usual.

140
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:26,248
I'll give him the deluxe
mental hospital tour.

141
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:28,946
Kid around, makes'em feel good.
We're pals.

142
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:31,750
You're the prisoners.
No, you're the guards.

143
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:33,655
Nowyou got it.

144
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:37,389
Okay, it's all in good fun.
Here's some games here.

145
00:17:37,463 --> 00:17:40,955
And there's--
Get out! Get out!

146
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:45,062
He was in my chair.

147
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:48,868
Games. Games.
Here's some games.

148
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:51,273
Games that wanna get out.

149
00:17:51,377 --> 00:17:54,005
See? More games.

150
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:57,707
Games, theyvegetizeyou.
See?

151
00:17:57,816 --> 00:18:01,274
Ifyou play the games, you're
voluntarily taking a tranquillizer.

152
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:04,982
I guess they gaveyou
some chemical restraints. Drugs!

153
00:18:05,057 --> 00:18:08,356
What'd they giveyou? Thorazine?
Haldol? How much? How much?

154
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:10,588
Learn your drugs. Knowyour dosages.
It's elementary.

155
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:14,326
- I need to make a telephone call.
- A telephone call?

156
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,700
That's communication with the outside
world. Doctor's discretion.

157
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:21,365
Ifall ofthese nuts
could just make phone calls...

158
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,273
it could spread insanity
oozing through telephone cables...

159
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:28,210
oozing to the ears ofall these
poor, sane people, infecting them.

160
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,044
Wackos everywhere.
A plague of madness.

161
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:35,883
In fact, very few,Jim-- Jim, very few
of us here are actually mentally ill.

162
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:38,219
I'm not saying
you're not mentally ill.

163
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,351
For all I know, you're crazy as a loon.
But that's not whyyou're here.

164
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:48,957
You're here
because ofthe system.

165
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:51,937
There's the television.

166
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:54,131
It's all right there.
All right there.

167
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:56,197
Look, listen, kneel, pray.

168
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:59,210
The commercials!

169
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:02,371
We're not productive any more.
Don't make things. It's all automated.

170
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:05,609
What are we for then?
We're consumers,Jim.

171
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:08,585
Okay, okay. Buy a lot ofstuff,
you're a good citizen.

172
00:19:08,654 --> 00:19:11,646
But ifyou don't buy a lot of stuff,
what are you then?

173
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:14,386
What?
You're mentally ill.

174
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,658
Fact,Jim. Fact! Ifyou don't
buy things: toilet paper, new cars...

175
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:20,460
electrically operated
sexual devices...

176
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:22,796
stereo systems
with brain-implanted headphones...

177
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:26,736
screwdrivers with built-in radar
devices, voice-activated computers--

178
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,807
Take it easy,Jeffrey.

179
00:19:28,874 --> 00:19:31,240
Be calm!

180
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:36,677
Right. That's right.
You're a very attractive woman.

181
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:42,783
Ifyou want to watch a particular
TV program, like All My Children...

182
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:46,621
go to the nurse, tell her the day,
the time the showyou wanna see is on.

183
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,989
Butyou have to tell her before
the show is scheduled to be on.

184
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:52,519
This guywas always requesting shows
that had already played.

185
00:19:52,598 --> 00:19:55,726
Yes. No.
You have to tell her before.

186
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:59,567
He couldn't grasp the idea that
the nurse couldn't make it beyesterday.

187
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:01,970
She couldn't turn back time!
Thank you, Einstein.

188
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,169
Now he, he was nuts.
He was a fruitcake,Jim.

189
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:09,737
Okay, that's it,Jeffrey.
You're gonna get a shot.

190
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:12,612
- I warned you.
- Right.

191
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:16,746
I got a little carried away...

192
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:20,815
explaining the innerworkings
ofthe institution toJim.

193
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:27,220
I don't really come
from outer space.

194
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,029
Oh. L.J. Washington.
He doesn't really come from outer space.

195
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:32,502
Don't mock me, my friend.

196
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:37,871
Get outta my chair!

197
00:20:37,976 --> 00:20:41,036
It's a condition
of mental divergence.

198
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:44,582
I find myself
on the planet Ogo.

199
00:20:44,683 --> 00:20:47,447
Part of an intellectual elite...

200
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:53,082
preparing to subjugate
the barbarian hordes on Pluto.

201
00:20:53,158 --> 00:20:58,118
But even though this is a totally
convincing reality for me in all ways...

202
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:03,100
nevertheless, Ogo is actually
a construct of my psyche.

203
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:06,695
I am mentally divergent...

204
00:21:06,772 --> 00:21:10,868
in that I am escaping
certain unnamed realities...

205
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:13,444
that plague my life here.

206
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:17,709
When I stop going there,
I will be well.

207
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:23,554
are you also divergent,
friend?

208
00:21:29,194 --> 00:21:31,924
This is a place
for crazy people.

209
00:21:31,997 --> 00:21:35,262
I'm not crazy.

210
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:38,269
We don't use that term, "crazy,"
Mr. Cole.

211
00:21:39,872 --> 00:21:42,272
You've got
some real nuts here!

212
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:49,309
I know some things
that you don't know.

213
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:52,145
It's gonna be very difficult
for you to understand it.

214
00:21:54,586 --> 00:21:58,147
I'm not gonna hurt anyone!

215
00:21:58,223 --> 00:22:00,589
All right.

216
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:06,354
Look,
have any ofyou heard...

217
00:22:06,432 --> 00:22:10,391
ofthe Army
ofthe Twelve Monkeys?

218
00:22:12,004 --> 00:22:15,440
They stencil this on the sides
ofbuildings everywhere.

219
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:18,340
Haveyou seen this?
Haveyou seen this?

220
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:20,605
Why don'tyou just
takeyour time...

221
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:23,203
and try to explain this
from the beginning?

222
00:22:23,315 --> 00:22:25,715
Right, right.
It's 1 990.

223
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:29,618
Okay, that makes sense.
Theywouldn't have been activeyet.

224
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:46,701
Five billion people
died in 1 996 and 1 997.

225
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:50,606
Almost the entire population
ofthe world.

226
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:55,078
Only about one percent
of us survived.

227
00:22:55,147 --> 00:22:59,049
- are you going to save us?
- How can I? This already happened.

228
00:22:59,151 --> 00:23:02,814
I can't saveyou.
Nobody can.

229
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:07,587
I am simply trying to gather information
to help the people in the present...

230
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:09,524
trace the path ofthe virus.

231
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:14,362
We're not in the present now,
Mr. Cole?

232
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:18,335
1 990 is the past. This already happened.
That's what I'm trying--

233
00:23:21,406 --> 00:23:24,500
You believe 1 996 is the present then,
is that it?

234
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,546
No! 1 996 is the past too.
Listen to me. What I--

235
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:35,616
What I-- What I need to do
is make a telephone call.

236
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:40,056
I can straighten this out
ifl make a telephone call.

237
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,219
Who would you call?
Who would straighten everything out?

238
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:47,755
The scientists. They'll want to know
that they sent me to the wrong time.

239
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:52,861
I can leave a voice mail message
that they monitor from the present.

240
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:57,733
Can I just make
one telephone call, please?

241
00:23:57,843 --> 00:23:59,743
Please?

242
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:07,585
What are you doin' in the dog bowl?
Get outta there!

243
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:11,282
Who put those Doritos
in there anyway?

244
00:24:11,356 --> 00:24:14,792
Yes? What?
Voice mail?

245
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,226
Look, I don't know--
Stop makin' that noise!

246
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:19,560
I don't know
whatyou're talkin' about.

247
00:24:19,631 --> 00:24:23,761
Is this a joke?
I don't know any scientists.

248
00:24:23,835 --> 00:24:25,826
Duanne, get out--
James who?

249
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:31,972
Wasn't whoyou expected?

250
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:37,344
No. It was some lady.
She didn't know anything.

251
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:41,648
Well, maybe it was
the wrong number.

252
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,487
No. That's why they chose me.
I remember things.

253
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:48,822
James, where did you grow up?

254
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:50,953
Dr. Railly.

255
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:54,123
I have the strangest feeling
I've metyou before.

256
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:58,363
Wait. This is 1 990. I'm supposed
to be leaving messages in 1 996!

257
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,132
It's not the right numberyet!
That's the problem!

258
00:25:01,206 --> 00:25:04,869
I have a message forthem.

259
00:25:40,145 --> 00:25:43,137
Won'twork.
Can't open it.

260
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:45,944
You thinkyou can remove the grill,
butyou can't. It's welded.

261
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,012
See? Told you.
All the doors are locked too.

262
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,524
They're protecting the people
on the outside from us...

263
00:25:54,593 --> 00:25:57,084
when the people on the outside
are as crazy as us.

264
00:26:17,683 --> 00:26:22,382
Do you know what "crazy" is?
Crazy is "majority rules." Yeah.

265
00:26:22,454 --> 00:26:24,422
Take germs, for example.

266
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:26,980
Germs?

267
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:30,858
In the 1 8th century, no such thing.
Nada. Nothing.

268
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:33,261
No one ever imagined such a thing!
No sane person, anyway.

269
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:37,465
Along comes this doctor.

270
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:40,365
Semmelweis!

271
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:46,808
Semmelweis comes along, trying to
convince people, other doctors mainly...

272
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,881
that there are these teeny, tiny,
invisible bad things called germs...

273
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:52,449
that get intoyour body
and makeyou sick.

274
00:26:52,517 --> 00:26:55,145
He's trying to get doctors
to wash their hands.

275
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,188
What is this guy?
Crazy?

276
00:26:57,255 --> 00:27:00,850
Teeny, tiny, invisible--
"What doyou call'em? Germs? What?"

277
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:03,690
Now, cut to the 20th century.

278
00:27:03,762 --> 00:27:08,859
Last week, in fact, right before
I got dragged into this hellhole!

279
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:11,835
I go in to order a burger
in this fast-food joint.

280
00:27:11,937 --> 00:27:13,734
The guy drops it on the floor.

281
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:16,103
Jim, he picks it up,
wipes it off.

282
00:27:16,174 --> 00:27:18,301
He hands it to me
like it was all okay.

283
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,607
"What about the germs?" I say.
He says, "I don't believe in germs.

284
00:27:21,713 --> 00:27:25,843
Germs are a plot they made up so they
can sell you disinfectants and soaps."

285
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:30,013
Now, he's crazy, right?
See?

286
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:37,859
There's no right. There's no wrong.
There's only popular opinion.

287
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:40,489
You, you, you believe in germs,
right?

288
00:27:40,565 --> 00:27:43,432
I'm not crazy.

289
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:48,530
Of course not! You wanna escape, right?
That's very sane.

290
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:53,776
I can help you.
You want me to, don'tya? Getyou out?

291
00:27:55,614 --> 00:27:57,946
You know how
to get outta here?

292
00:28:00,218 --> 00:28:01,446
Yes, my son!

293
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,081
- Then why don'tya?
- Why don't I try to escape?

294
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:08,923
Good question. Very good question.
Intelligent.

295
00:28:08,994 --> 00:28:13,192
Because I would be crazy to escape.
I have sent out word.

296
00:28:13,265 --> 00:28:16,666
- I am all taken care of.
- What does that mean?

297
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:19,761
I've managed to contact
certain underlings, evil spirits...

298
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:22,500
secretaries of secretaries
and other assorted minions...

299
00:28:22,574 --> 00:28:24,565
who will contact my father.

300
00:28:24,643 --> 00:28:27,612
And when my father finds out
I'm in this kind of place...

301
00:28:27,712 --> 00:28:31,478
he'll have them transfer me
to one ofthose classyjoints...

302
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,519
where they treatyou properly,
like a person, a guest!

303
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:37,054
With sheets and towels
like a big hotel...

304
00:28:37,122 --> 00:28:42,617
with great drugs for all of us
nut-case, lunatic, maniac devils!

305
00:28:45,463 --> 00:28:47,556
Sorry. Sorry.

306
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:50,692
I got a little agitated.
The thought of escape crossed my mind.

307
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:53,203
And suddenly--

308
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:56,536
Suddenly I felt like bending
the fucking bars back!

309
00:28:56,608 --> 00:29:01,545
And ripping out the window frames
and eating them! Yes, eating them!

310
00:29:01,646 --> 00:29:03,978
And leaping, leaping, leaping!

311
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:06,882
Colonics for everyone!

312
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,553
I'm a mental patient.
I'm supposed to act out.

313
00:29:11,623 --> 00:29:14,751
Wait'll you morons find out who I am!
My father's gonna be really upset.

314
00:29:14,826 --> 00:29:17,522
And when my father gets upset,
the ground shakes.

315
00:29:17,596 --> 00:29:22,761
My father is God!
I worship my father!

316
00:29:27,172 --> 00:29:31,074
These dramatic videotapes, secretly
obtainedbyanimal rights activists...

317
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:33,269
have arousedpublic indignation.

318
00:29:33,378 --> 00:29:36,973
But manyscientists
vehemently disagree,

319
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:43,117
Torture experiments.

320
00:29:44,556 --> 00:29:48,287
- We're all monkeys.
- They hurt you?

321
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:54,029
Not as bad as what they're doing
to the Easter Bunny.

322
00:29:56,902 --> 00:30:00,804
Look at them.
They're just askin' for it.

323
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:06,006
Maybe the human race
deserves to be wiped out.

324
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:10,106
Wiping out the human race?

325
00:30:10,215 --> 00:30:13,446
It's a great idea.
It's great.

326
00:30:13,518 --> 00:30:15,611
But more of a long-term thing.

327
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:18,019
First we have to focus
on more immediate goals.

328
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:20,557
I didn't say a word
aboutyou-know-what.

329
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:27,089
- What are you talking about?
- Your plan. Emancipation.

330
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:33,368
What are you writing?
You a reporter?

331
00:30:33,438 --> 00:30:35,531
It's private.

332
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:38,967
A lawsuit?
You gonna sue'em?

333
00:30:39,077 --> 00:30:42,604
Yo,Jimbo.
Time for your meds.

334
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:48,946
Take a chance,
Live the moment,

335
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,421
Sunshine,
Gorgeous beaches,

336
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,357
The Florida Keys!

337
00:30:55,427 --> 00:30:57,861
We'll returnyou to the Marx Brothers
in Monkey Business.

338
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:00,625
Monkey business!

339
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,767
Fetch!

340
00:31:08,974 --> 00:31:12,102
Get it?
Monkey. Monk key.

341
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:16,343
What?

342
00:31:17,148 --> 00:31:19,616
Ifyou see a bearish future
in the decade ahead...

343
00:31:19,684 --> 00:31:23,381
consider the changes sweeping the world
and the opportunities they offer.

344
00:31:23,455 --> 00:31:27,016
"And the opportunities
they offer." Ooh!

345
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:29,856
They really dosed you.
J im!

346
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:32,453
Major load.
Danger, Will Robinson, danger.

347
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,966
You gotta get it together.
Focus, focus, focus.

348
00:31:36,034 --> 00:31:39,094
Remember the plan.
I did my part!

349
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,364
What?

350
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,374
Not "what." When.

351
00:31:44,476 --> 00:31:46,444
- When?
- Yes. When.

352
00:31:46,544 --> 00:31:47,875
Now. Now,Jim.

353
00:31:49,314 --> 00:31:51,908
Yes! Now!
Buy! Sell!

354
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:55,248
Stocks! Bonds!
Purchase! Sell!

355
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,118
Yes!
No more monkey business!

356
00:31:58,189 --> 00:32:00,851
No... more...

357
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:03,621
monkey business!

358
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:05,629
Yes, enhanceyour portfolio now.

359
00:32:05,697 --> 00:32:08,564
Five hundred dollars.
I got $500. I'm insured!

360
00:32:08,633 --> 00:32:12,228
Yeah! A window of opportunity
is opening now.

361
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:16,103
Now is the time for all good men
to seize the moment. The moment!

362
00:32:16,174 --> 00:32:18,608
Now is the time for all good men
to seize the day!

363
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,736
Goddamn it,Jeffrey!
Quit playin' the fool!

364
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:24,110
MasterCard!
Visa!

365
00:32:24,182 --> 00:32:27,242
The key to happiness!

366
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:30,913
Jim, seize the moment!

367
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:32,752
Jeffrey, come back here!

368
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,189
Go,Jim!

369
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:52,036
- Get out. Out!
- Come here,Jeffrey!

370
00:33:03,188 --> 00:33:07,318
The future can beyours!
Last chance! Last chance!

371
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:27,773
Best place to go
would be Florida.

372
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:31,406
The Keys are lovely
this time ofyear.

373
00:33:52,504 --> 00:33:56,736
Two's not working today.
Use one.

374
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:25,229
Kathryn,
this was in my box!

375
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:27,328
But I have a slight suspicion
it wasn't meant for me.

376
00:34:27,405 --> 00:34:31,273
"You are the most bootiful
woman I have ever seen.

377
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:34,971
You live in a bootiful world,
butyou don't know it.

378
00:34:35,113 --> 00:34:38,549
You have freedom, sunshine,
airyou can breathe--"

379
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:41,210
James Cole, right?

380
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:46,246
"I would do anything to stay here
but I must leave. Please help me."

381
00:34:46,324 --> 00:34:48,952
Okay, okay, okay.
Poor man.

382
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:52,087
Hey, Kathryn?
James Cole is one ofyours, right?

383
00:34:52,163 --> 00:34:54,825
He eloped.
Last seen, he was up on two.

384
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,491
Shit!

385
00:35:02,507 --> 00:35:05,032
We have to know exactly
what's there so we can fix it.

386
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:07,543
Doctor, we have a visitor.

387
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:11,139
May I help you?
Excuse me?

388
00:35:20,525 --> 00:35:24,188
Hey,Jimbo.
What's up, man?

389
00:35:30,802 --> 00:35:34,169
All right, it's okay.
Take it easy.

390
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:36,833
- It'll be all right.
- Take care.

391
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:40,366
Take it easy.
We'll work this out, okay?

392
00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:44,779
Send you back toyour room. A little
milk and cookies, you'll be all right.

393
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:47,579
Just take it easy, okay?

394
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,111
Calm down!

395
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:01,059
Take him down!
Take him the fuck down!

396
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:09,807
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
Dr. Railly, help me, please.

397
00:36:09,874 --> 00:36:13,332
- We'll giveyou something to calm you.
- No! No more drugs!

398
00:36:13,444 --> 00:36:15,912
James, we have to do this.
You're very confused.

399
00:36:28,693 --> 00:36:31,457
Kathryn, we've been working
together for fouryears.

400
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:33,963
I've never seen you
like this before.

401
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:38,162
So please stop being so defensive.
This isn't an inquisition.

402
00:36:38,236 --> 00:36:41,569
I didn't think I was being defensive.
I was trying to explain exactlywhat--

403
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:44,540
He should've been in restraints.

404
00:36:44,642 --> 00:36:48,237
It was bad judgment on your part,
plain and simple. Why not own up to it?

405
00:36:48,346 --> 00:36:51,281
Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have
the strangest feeling about him.

406
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:54,910
- I've seen him before and I'm trying--
- Two policemen are in the hospital.

407
00:36:54,986 --> 00:36:58,217
Now we've got a security guard
with a skull fracture.

408
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:01,622
I said it was bad judgment!
What else doyou want me to say?

409
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:04,218
You see that?
See what I mean?

410
00:37:04,295 --> 00:37:07,355
You're being defensive.
Isn't she being defensive?

411
00:37:08,933 --> 00:37:12,369
We have another situation.

412
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:20,701
- He was fully restrained?
- Yes, sir. I did it myself.

413
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,512
And he was fully sedated?

414
00:37:24,582 --> 00:37:26,743
He was fully sedated.

415
00:37:39,097 --> 00:37:43,090
are you trying to tell me a fully
sedated, fully restrained patient...

416
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:47,399
somehow slipped out that vent,
replaced the grill behind him...

417
00:37:47,472 --> 00:37:51,670
and is wriggling his way
through the ventilation system?

418
00:38:08,926 --> 00:38:11,258
Watch it!

419
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:13,763
You sure fucked up!

420
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:22,098
- Where are you?
- Ah, you can talk!

421
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:33,582
My name's not Bob.

422
00:38:33,651 --> 00:38:37,747
Not a prob, Bob.
Where'd they send you?

423
00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:41,851
- Where are you?
- Another cell.

424
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:46,253
Maybe.

425
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:48,628
What doyou mean "maybe"?
What's that supposed to mean?

426
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:51,429
Maybe means...

427
00:38:51,502 --> 00:38:54,494
maybe I'm in the next cell.

428
00:38:54,572 --> 00:38:58,201
Anothervolunteer likeyou.

429
00:38:58,309 --> 00:39:01,642
Or maybe I'm in
the Central Office...

430
00:39:01,712 --> 00:39:05,148
spying on ya
for all those science bozos.

431
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:07,682
Or, hey...

432
00:39:07,752 --> 00:39:11,085
maybe I'm not even here.

433
00:39:11,155 --> 00:39:15,353
Maybe I'm just in your head.

434
00:39:16,727 --> 00:39:19,890
No way to confirm anything.

435
00:39:21,165 --> 00:39:25,329
- Where'd they send ya?
- 1 990.

436
00:39:25,403 --> 00:39:30,932
'90! How was it?
Good drugs? Lots of pussy?

437
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:34,705
Hey, Bob, you do the job?

438
00:39:34,812 --> 00:39:38,145
You find out the big info?

439
00:39:38,216 --> 00:39:40,878
Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys?

440
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:43,477
It was supposed to be 1 996.

441
00:39:43,554 --> 00:39:47,490
Science ain't an exact science
with these clowns.

442
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:50,220
But they're getting better.

443
00:39:50,294 --> 00:39:54,754
You're luckyyou didn't end up
in ancient Egypt.

444
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:56,322
Shh! They're comin'.

445
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:01,494
The Freedom for Animals Association
on SecondAvenue...

446
00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:04,405
is the secret headquarters
ofthe Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys,

447
00:40:04,509 --> 00:40:08,172
They are the ones
who are going to do it,

448
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:11,248
I can't do any more,
I have to go now.

449
00:40:11,315 --> 00:40:13,977
Have a merry Christmas.

450
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:18,246
- Wel l?
- What?

451
00:40:18,322 --> 00:40:21,553
Did you or did you not
record that message?

452
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:25,892
It's a reconstruction
of a deteriorated recording.

453
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:30,559
Weak signal. We have to put them
together one word at a time.

454
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:32,659
We just finished
rebuilding this.

455
00:40:32,737 --> 00:40:36,434
Did you or did you not
make this call?

456
00:40:36,507 --> 00:40:41,968
I couldn't make any call. You sent me
to thewrong year. It was 1 990.

457
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:48,150
- You're certain ofthat?
- What'd you do with your time, Cole?

458
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:51,017
Did you waste it on drugs?
Women?

459
00:40:51,088 --> 00:40:53,113
- Theyforced me to take drugs.
- Forced you?

460
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,557
Whywould someone
forceyou to take drugs?

461
00:40:57,895 --> 00:41:03,197
I was in trouble.
I got arrested.

462
00:41:06,237 --> 00:41:10,333
I did whatyou wanted.
I got a specimen, a spider.

463
00:41:10,408 --> 00:41:14,469
I didn't have anyplace
to put it, so I ate it.

464
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:18,345
Butyou sent me to the wrong year,
so it really doesn't matter.

465
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:21,442
Did you see this
when you went back?

466
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:23,987
No, sir, I don't think so.

467
00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:27,616
What about these people?
Did you see any ofthese people?

468
00:41:27,692 --> 00:41:30,718
No.

469
00:41:30,795 --> 00:41:33,696
Oh, wait, wait.

470
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:37,930
Him?
You saw that man?

471
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,697
Maybe in the mental institution.

472
00:41:41,772 --> 00:41:45,640
You were in a mental institution?
Oh, God.

473
00:41:45,776 --> 00:41:49,872
Cole, you were sent back to make
some very important observations.

474
00:41:49,981 --> 00:41:51,915
You could've made
a real contribution.

475
00:41:51,983 --> 00:41:54,850
Helped us
to reclaim the planet.

476
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:57,353
As well as reducing
your sentence.

477
00:41:57,421 --> 00:42:01,858
The question is, Cole,
doyou want another chance?

478
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:30,880
Last connection going on.

479
00:43:14,265 --> 00:43:17,530
No mistakes this time, Cole.

480
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:20,593
Stay alert.
Keepyour eyes open.

481
00:43:20,671 --> 00:43:24,402
We're thinking about the spider, Cole.
Try and do something like that again.

482
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:26,533
Just relax now.
Don't fight it.

483
00:43:26,644 --> 00:43:29,704
We're sending you
to the third quarter of 1 996.

484
00:43:29,814 --> 00:43:32,248
Right on the money.

485
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,744
I don't understand!

486
00:44:12,757 --> 00:44:14,884
What?

487
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:16,790
I don't understand!

488
00:44:18,095 --> 00:44:21,360
- Where am I?
- I gotta find'em! I gotta find'em!

489
00:44:21,432 --> 00:44:23,798
Help me!
I don't know where I am.

490
00:44:24,568 --> 00:44:27,901
- You gotta help me find'em!
- Jose?

491
00:44:27,972 --> 00:44:29,940
- Jose!
- Cole!

492
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:32,737
Cole, where are we?

493
00:44:34,979 --> 00:44:37,004
- Help me, Cole!
- Oh, God, wait!

494
00:44:51,295 --> 00:44:53,559
"In a season ofgreat pestilence...

495
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:57,226
there are omens and divinations.

496
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:59,360
And one of the four beasts
gave unto the seven angels...

497
00:44:59,436 --> 00:45:02,564
seven golden vials
full of the wrath of God...

498
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,734
who liveth forever and ever."

499
00:45:05,843 --> 00:45:07,333
Revelations.

500
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:11,073
In the 1 4th century, according to
accounts of officials ofthat time...

501
00:45:11,182 --> 00:45:14,618
this man appeared suddenly in
the village ofWyle near Stonehenge...

502
00:45:14,718 --> 00:45:16,686
in April of 1 362.

503
00:45:17,621 --> 00:45:20,317
Using unfamiliarwords
and speaking in a strange accent...

504
00:45:20,391 --> 00:45:23,292
the man made dire prognostications
about a pestilence...

505
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,956
which he said would wipe out humanity
in approximately 600 years.

506
00:45:28,032 --> 00:45:32,332
Obviously this plague-doomsday scenario
is considerably more compelling...

507
00:45:32,403 --> 00:45:34,428
when reality supports it
with a virulent disease...

508
00:45:34,505 --> 00:45:37,668
whether it's the bubonic plague,
smallpox or AIDS.

509
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:39,936
Nowwe have technological horrors
as well...

510
00:45:40,044 --> 00:45:42,740
such as chemical warfare,
which first reared its ugly head...

511
00:45:42,847 --> 00:45:45,645
during the deadly mustard gas attacks
ofWorld War I.

512
00:45:45,716 --> 00:45:49,152
During such an attack in the French
trenches in October of 1 91 7...

513
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:51,016
we have an account
ofthis soldier...

514
00:45:51,088 --> 00:45:53,682
who, during an assault,
was wounded by shrapnel...

515
00:45:53,757 --> 00:45:56,851
and hospitalized, apparently
in a state ofhysteria.

516
00:45:56,927 --> 00:45:59,953
Doctors found he had lost
all comprehension of French...

517
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,396
but that he spoke English fluently...

518
00:46:02,466 --> 00:46:05,629
albeit in a regional dialect
they didn't recognize.

519
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:09,230
The man, though physically
unaffected by the gas...

520
00:46:09,306 --> 00:46:11,638
was beside himself.

521
00:46:11,742 --> 00:46:14,609
He claimed that he
had come from the future...

522
00:46:14,678 --> 00:46:16,669
that he was looking
for a pure germ...

523
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,749
that would ultimatelywipe mankind
offthe face ofthe Earth...

524
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:22,785
starting in theyear 1 996.

525
00:46:24,588 --> 00:46:28,854
Though injured, theyoung soldier
disappeared from the hospital...

526
00:46:28,926 --> 00:46:31,622
no doubt trying to carry on
his mission towarn others...

527
00:46:31,695 --> 00:46:34,163
and substituting
for the agony ofwar...

528
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:37,667
a self-inflicted agony
we call "the Cassandra complex."

529
00:46:37,735 --> 00:46:41,364
Cassandra, in Greek legend,
was condemned to know the future...

530
00:46:41,438 --> 00:46:44,373
but to be disbelieved
when she foretold it.

531
00:46:44,475 --> 00:46:48,571
Hence, the agony offoreknowledge, plus
the impotence to do anything about it.

532
00:47:01,725 --> 00:47:05,456
I'm going right out
to get vaccinated.

533
00:47:05,562 --> 00:47:08,793
I think, Dr. Railly,
you've given alarmists a bad name.

534
00:47:08,866 --> 00:47:10,629
I have?

535
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:15,728
There's real data that the planet cannot
survive the excesses ofthe human race.

536
00:47:15,806 --> 00:47:18,570
- This is true.
- Proliferation of atomic devices.

537
00:47:18,676 --> 00:47:20,871
Uncontrolled breeding habits.

538
00:47:20,978 --> 00:47:24,505
Pollution ofland, sea and air.
The rape ofthe environment.

539
00:47:24,615 --> 00:47:29,450
In this context, it's obvious Chicken
Little represents the sane vision...

540
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,286
and that Homosapiens' motto,
" Let's go shopping"...

541
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:36,326
is the cry ofthe true lunatic.

542
00:47:39,763 --> 00:47:43,199
Please, Dr. Railly. I wonder
ifyou're aware of my own studies.

543
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:53,734
Seeyou at work tomorrow.

544
00:47:53,844 --> 00:47:56,540
I'll giveyou a call tomorrow.

545
00:48:13,163 --> 00:48:14,858
Get in the car!

546
00:48:14,932 --> 00:48:17,867
I've got a gun. Get in the car.

547
00:48:23,007 --> 00:48:24,474
Drive.

548
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,975
Take my purse.
I've got a lot of cash, credit cards.

549
00:48:27,044 --> 00:48:29,672
- Take my keys.
- Start the car!

550
00:48:43,027 --> 00:48:45,552
Here, turn right.
Turn right here.

551
00:48:50,934 --> 00:48:53,903
- Where are we going?
- Philadelphia.

552
00:48:54,004 --> 00:48:57,838
- That's more than a hundred miles.
- That's why I can't walk there.

553
00:48:57,908 --> 00:49:00,433
- Just let me go.
- Just drive!

554
00:49:00,544 --> 00:49:02,978
- You can take the car.
- I don't know how to drive.

555
00:49:04,581 --> 00:49:08,415
I went underground when I was eight.
I told you that before.

556
00:49:08,485 --> 00:49:09,952
At the next--

557
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,855
- At the next corner, turn right.
- Cole.James Cole.

558
00:49:14,925 --> 00:49:18,656
You escaped from a locked room
six years ago.

559
00:49:18,729 --> 00:49:21,698
Six years for you.
Come on.

560
00:49:21,765 --> 00:49:23,494
Turn around! Get goin'.

561
00:49:34,278 --> 00:49:38,044
I can't believe that this
is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.

562
00:49:38,115 --> 00:49:41,209
- Haveyou been following me?
- You said you would help me.

563
00:49:41,285 --> 00:49:44,584
I know this isn't whatyou meant,
but...

564
00:49:44,655 --> 00:49:46,748
I don't have any money.

565
00:49:46,824 --> 00:49:50,658
I hurt my leg.
I've been sleeping on the street.

566
00:49:50,727 --> 00:49:52,319
I'm sure I smell bad.

567
00:49:53,397 --> 00:49:56,457
Doyou have any food in this car?

568
00:49:56,567 --> 00:50:00,333
- You have been following me?
- No.

569
00:50:00,404 --> 00:50:03,134
No, I saw this...

570
00:50:04,608 --> 00:50:07,475
in a store window.

571
00:50:07,544 --> 00:50:10,479
I can read, remember?

572
00:50:13,283 --> 00:50:15,308
Why doyou want to go
to Philadelphia?

573
00:50:15,385 --> 00:50:19,685
I checked out the Baltimore information.
It was nothing.

574
00:50:20,991 --> 00:50:24,654
It's in Philadelphia.
That's where the ones who did it are.

575
00:50:24,728 --> 00:50:27,697
TheTwelve Monkeys.

576
00:50:28,832 --> 00:50:32,461
Is that a radio?
Can you turn it on?

577
00:50:35,672 --> 00:50:38,971
This is apersonal message toyou,

578
00:50:39,076 --> 00:50:41,237
are you at the end ofyourrope?

579
00:50:41,345 --> 00:50:43,939
are you dying to get away?

580
00:50:44,047 --> 00:50:47,710
The Florida Keys are waiting for you,
Ocean waves--

581
00:50:47,784 --> 00:50:50,014
I've never seen the ocean.

582
00:50:50,087 --> 00:50:53,784
It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole.

583
00:50:53,857 --> 00:50:56,621
What?

584
00:50:56,693 --> 00:50:59,423
It's an advertisement.
You understand that, don't you?

585
00:50:59,496 --> 00:51:03,398
It's not really
a special message toyou.

586
00:51:05,702 --> 00:51:07,499
Mr. Cole.

587
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:11,903
- You used to call meJames.
- You prefer that?

588
00:51:13,844 --> 00:51:17,143
James, you don't really
have a gun--

589
00:51:17,214 --> 00:51:20,377
Can you turn this up?
Can you make this louder?

590
00:51:21,518 --> 00:51:24,715
I foundmythrill

591
00:51:26,423 --> 00:51:29,722
On Blueberry Hill

592
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,562
When I foundyou

593
00:51:42,105 --> 00:51:45,040
I love the music
ofthe 20th century.

594
00:51:47,144 --> 00:51:51,012
I love this air.
Love to breathe this air!

595
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:06,689
WXBXnews break,

596
00:52:06,763 --> 00:52:08,993
News as it happens,
Roger Pratt reporting,

597
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:12,627
A story breaking now is emergency crews
are converging on a corn field...

598
00:52:12,703 --> 00:52:14,864
where playmates ofnine-year-old
Ricky Neuman say...

599
00:52:14,938 --> 00:52:17,031
he disappeared before their eyes,

600
00:52:17,107 --> 00:52:19,974
Young Neuman apparently stepped
into an abandoned well shaft...

601
00:52:20,077 --> 00:52:22,637
and is lodged somewhere
in the narrow 1 50-foot pipe,

602
00:52:22,746 --> 00:52:27,376
Possibly alive, possibly badly injured,
playmates heard him cry out faintly,

603
00:52:27,451 --> 00:52:30,784
- Never cry wolf.
- What?

604
00:52:30,887 --> 00:52:34,152
My father said that to me.
He said, " Never cry wolf."

605
00:52:34,224 --> 00:52:38,092
Then people won't believe you
if something really happens.

606
00:52:38,161 --> 00:52:42,097
If something really happens
like what,James?

607
00:52:42,165 --> 00:52:44,190
Something bad.

608
00:52:44,268 --> 00:52:46,532
Can we have some more music, please?
I don'twanna hearthis stuff.

609
00:52:46,603 --> 00:52:49,470
Can we hear more music?

610
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:55,403
- Isee trees ofgreen
- Oh, that's good. That's good.

611
00:52:57,714 --> 00:53:00,877
I'veseen them bloom

612
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:03,078
Forme andyou

613
00:53:03,153 --> 00:53:07,715
And I think to myself

614
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:11,386
What a wonderful world

615
00:53:15,265 --> 00:53:18,723
Hello, Dr. Railly?
This is Wikke from Psych Admitting,

616
00:53:18,802 --> 00:53:21,930
Do you rememberJames Cole?

617
00:53:22,005 --> 00:53:24,940
The paranoid who pulled
the Houdini back in'90?

618
00:53:25,042 --> 00:53:27,169
Well, he's back, and he's--

619
00:53:27,277 --> 00:53:30,644
Sorry about that, He's looking for you,
I thoughtyou oughta know.

620
00:53:30,714 --> 00:53:32,272
Take care,

621
00:53:32,382 --> 00:53:35,943
I t's just I i ke I told you.
Me and my husband went ahead.

622
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:40,115
I don't know. She never showed.
That is totally unlike her.

623
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:43,250
Do you happen to know
the make ofher car?

624
00:53:43,327 --> 00:53:45,591
Cherokee.'94 Cherokee.

625
00:53:47,264 --> 00:53:51,758
Silver,

626
00:53:51,835 --> 00:53:53,462
I have done "doed"it, ja.

627
00:53:53,537 --> 00:53:57,633
I, Professor Grossenfibber,
have invented the time tunnel!

628
00:53:57,741 --> 00:53:58,799
Oh, boy!

629
00:54:02,312 --> 00:54:06,305
Oh, excuse me, mister,
Have a cigar,

630
00:54:10,987 --> 00:54:13,649
Excuse me, mister,
Have a cigar,

631
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:28,530
Now my time machine
is ready for experiments,

632
00:54:32,409 --> 00:54:35,071
Ah, the woodpecker!

633
00:54:35,178 --> 00:54:37,806
Yoo-hoo, woodpecker!

634
00:55:03,473 --> 00:55:06,442
You were i n my dream just now.

635
00:55:08,178 --> 00:55:11,409
Hai r is different.
Different color.

636
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:16,017
I'm sure it was you.

637
00:55:17,854 --> 00:55:20,516
What was the dream about?

638
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,323
About an airport...

639
00:55:25,395 --> 00:55:27,863
before everything happened.

640
00:55:28,765 --> 00:55:31,461
It's the same dream
I always have.

641
00:55:31,535 --> 00:55:34,504
When I was a kid.

642
00:55:34,571 --> 00:55:36,562
And I was in it?

643
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,074
What did I do?

644
00:55:40,444 --> 00:55:41,638
You were very upset.

645
00:55:44,347 --> 00:55:47,248
You're always very upset
in the dream.

646
00:55:47,317 --> 00:55:49,342
Just never knew it was you.

647
00:55:49,419 --> 00:55:51,546
It wasn't me before,James.

648
00:55:51,621 --> 00:55:55,352
It's become me now
because ofwhat's happening.

649
00:55:57,427 --> 00:55:59,895
Could you please untie me?

650
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:07,066
No, I think it was always you.

651
00:56:07,137 --> 00:56:09,867
Very strange.

652
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,204
You're flushed
and you were moaning.

653
00:56:12,309 --> 00:56:15,801
I thinkyou're running a fever.

654
00:56:24,287 --> 00:56:26,517
What are you doing?

655
00:56:38,034 --> 00:56:42,664
In Fresno, California, crews continue
to attempt to rescue Ricky Neuman,

656
00:56:48,411 --> 00:56:51,244
Closer to home, in Baltimore,
Kathryn Railly...

657
00:56:51,314 --> 00:56:54,943
prominent psychiatrist and author of
a newly released book on insanity...

658
00:56:55,018 --> 00:56:59,114
disappeared mysteriously last night
after a lecture at the university,

659
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:02,556
Former mental patientJames Cole
is wanted for questioning...

660
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:05,060
regarding Dr. Railly's disappearance,

661
00:57:05,128 --> 00:57:07,460
Authorities warn that Cole
has a history of violence...

662
00:57:07,531 --> 00:57:10,227
and advise anyone spotting him
to notify authorities at once,

663
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:23,536
I love this m usic.

664
00:57:23,647 --> 00:57:26,275
We don't have this.
We don't have anything like this.

665
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:28,783
What are all those?

666
00:57:28,852 --> 00:57:30,183
These?

667
00:57:30,253 --> 00:57:33,154
My notes, clues.

668
00:57:33,223 --> 00:57:35,214
What kind of clues?

669
00:57:35,325 --> 00:57:37,316
It's about the secret army.

670
00:57:37,394 --> 00:57:39,624
The Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys.
They're the ones that spread the virus.

671
00:57:39,696 --> 00:57:42,756
That's why I'm here.
I have to find them. That's my mission.

672
00:57:42,832 --> 00:57:45,858
Have to locate them because they
have the virus in its pure form...

673
00:57:45,969 --> 00:57:47,664
before it mutates.

674
00:57:47,737 --> 00:57:50,638
When I locate them,
they'll send a scientist back here.

675
00:57:50,707 --> 00:57:52,732
That scientist will study the virus.

676
00:57:52,842 --> 00:57:56,869
When he goes back to the present,
he and the scientists will make a cure.

677
00:57:56,947 --> 00:57:59,142
Police officers
from threejurisdictions...

678
00:57:59,215 --> 00:58:02,480
apparentlyincluding
special tactical unit personnel...

679
00:58:02,552 --> 00:58:06,750
have now been mobilized to control
the growing thousands of onlookers...

680
00:58:06,823 --> 00:58:09,087
here in Fresno, California,

681
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,820
Does that disturb you?

682
00:58:10,894 --> 00:58:14,625
No. Thought it was about us.

683
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:18,600
Thought maybe they'd captured us
and arrested me.

684
00:58:19,736 --> 00:58:20,998
J ust a joke.

685
00:58:26,042 --> 00:58:29,443
I remember being very afraid
for that little boy.

686
00:58:29,546 --> 00:58:31,411
All alone, down that well...

687
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:33,574
not knowing if anybody's
gonna get him out.

688
00:58:35,151 --> 00:58:37,312
First time I was really afraid
when I was a kid.

689
00:58:37,387 --> 00:58:39,378
What doyou mean,
"when you were a kid"?

690
00:58:39,456 --> 00:58:42,220
Never mind.
Just a prank, a hoax.

691
00:58:42,292 --> 00:58:44,385
That boy's hiding in a barn.

692
00:58:56,906 --> 00:58:59,807
"There are omens and divinations.

693
00:58:59,876 --> 00:59:03,368
One ofthe four beasts
gave unto the seven angels...

694
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:07,246
seven golden vials
full ofthe wrath ofGod...

695
00:59:07,317 --> 00:59:10,980
who liveth forever and ever."

696
00:59:11,054 --> 00:59:14,251
You won't think I'm crazy
when people start dying next month.

697
00:59:15,825 --> 00:59:18,919
First they'll think
it's just some weird fever.

698
00:59:22,265 --> 00:59:24,563
Then they'll find out.

699
00:59:24,634 --> 00:59:27,501
They'll catch on.

700
00:59:28,805 --> 00:59:31,774
Wait. Stop here! Stop the car!
Stop right here!

701
00:59:35,979 --> 00:59:39,210
I was right. They're here!

702
00:59:39,282 --> 00:59:42,877
You see? Twelve Monkeys!
Twelve Monkeys!

703
00:59:42,952 --> 00:59:46,183
You believe me now?
Come on!

704
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:51,119
Come on!

705
00:59:51,194 --> 00:59:53,492
They're here, you see?

706
00:59:53,563 --> 00:59:55,997
Twelve Monkeys!

707
00:59:56,066 --> 00:59:58,125
Twelve Monkeys. Come on!

708
01:00:00,236 --> 01:00:02,136
Twelve Monkeys.

709
01:00:02,205 --> 01:00:04,765
Wait, wait. Wait, here.

710
01:00:04,841 --> 01:00:07,309
Here, do you see it?
Do you see?

711
01:00:07,377 --> 01:00:09,845
I see some red paint,
some marks.

712
01:00:09,946 --> 01:00:12,779
- Marks? You think that--
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

713
01:00:14,617 --> 01:00:18,348
Don't--
Don'tyou do anything crazy.

714
01:00:18,421 --> 01:00:20,252
Or I'll hurt somebody.

715
01:00:20,323 --> 01:00:23,554
I am not gonna do anything crazy, but
none ofthis is whatyou think it is!

716
01:00:23,626 --> 01:00:26,186
You can't hide from them, Bob.

717
01:00:27,297 --> 01:00:30,926
I said, you can't hide from them.

718
01:00:32,569 --> 01:00:34,833
No, sir, ol' Bob.

719
01:00:34,904 --> 01:00:37,737
Don't even try.

720
01:00:40,677 --> 01:00:43,510
They hear everything.

721
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,947
They got that tracking device on ya.

722
01:00:49,652 --> 01:00:52,951
They can find you anywhere,
anytime!

723
01:00:53,022 --> 01:00:55,582
It's in the tooth.

724
01:00:55,658 --> 01:00:58,149
Right, Bob?

725
01:00:58,228 --> 01:01:00,856
But I fooled'em, old buddy.

726
01:01:06,136 --> 01:01:09,902
They don't have to spy on me.
I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

727
01:01:09,973 --> 01:01:12,908
You see? Here it is again. See?

728
01:01:13,009 --> 01:01:16,069
Here, follow this paint trail.

729
01:01:16,179 --> 01:01:17,510
Here. It's here, see?

730
01:01:18,815 --> 01:01:20,476
I am not going--

731
01:01:21,818 --> 01:01:26,118
Come with me!
The paint trail goes here.

732
01:01:28,258 --> 01:01:31,785
Let go of my arm!
James, we shouldn't be here.

733
01:01:31,861 --> 01:01:33,852
Goddamn it!

734
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:43,836
Leave me alone!

735
01:01:46,142 --> 01:01:49,805
Let's get out ofhere.
James, we shouldn't be here.

736
01:02:03,626 --> 01:02:06,356
Please don't kill me.
Don't kill me, please!

737
01:02:06,462 --> 01:02:09,488
Don't kill me, don't kill me!

738
01:02:14,771 --> 01:02:16,432
Stick around, bitch.

739
01:02:38,862 --> 01:02:41,490
are you all right?

740
01:02:45,068 --> 01:02:48,333
Is he alive?

741
01:02:48,404 --> 01:02:51,430
Go ahead.
We're runnin' out oftime.

742
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,509
- You can't help him.
- Oh,Jesus!

743
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:55,168
James, you killed him!

744
01:02:55,278 --> 01:02:58,076
All I see are dead people.
Come on.

745
01:02:59,182 --> 01:03:02,117
- Come on.
- You never had a gun before!

746
01:03:02,185 --> 01:03:05,052
I have one now.
Come on. Come on!

747
01:03:06,389 --> 01:03:08,983
" Dragons in their pleasant palaces.

748
01:03:09,058 --> 01:03:13,154
The seventh angel poured out
his vial into the air...

749
01:03:13,229 --> 01:03:16,062
and there came--"
You!

750
01:03:17,433 --> 01:03:19,901
You're one of us.

751
01:03:36,152 --> 01:03:37,551
This is it.

752
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,417
Come on.

753
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:56,233
Can we help you?

754
01:04:00,476 --> 01:04:02,910
It's just a tape.

755
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:08,808
I'm looking for
the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys.

756
01:04:12,455 --> 01:04:16,721
We don't know anything about an Army
ofthe Twelve Monkeys so just disappear.

757
01:04:16,793 --> 01:04:18,693
- Just want some information.
- Didn'tyou hear me?

758
01:04:18,761 --> 01:04:21,730
Don't hurt her!

759
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,665
Please, I'm a psychiatrist.

760
01:04:25,735 --> 01:04:29,762
Just do whatever he tells you to do.
He's disturbed. He's dangerous.

761
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:32,307
- Please just cooperate.
- You want money?

762
01:04:32,442 --> 01:04:34,672
- We only got a few bucks.
- I told you what I want.

763
01:04:34,777 --> 01:04:38,213
Get down. Lock that door.
Lock it now!

764
01:04:40,149 --> 01:04:43,516
- I told you that Goines would get us--
- Shut up!

765
01:04:44,954 --> 01:04:48,185
- Goines?
- Jeffrey Goines?

766
01:04:50,293 --> 01:04:53,820
Jeffrey becomes this big star,
and the media latch onto him...

767
01:04:53,896 --> 01:04:55,989
because he's picketing
his own father...

768
01:04:56,065 --> 01:04:58,090
a famous
Nobel-prize-winning virologist.

769
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:00,533
You must have seen all that on TV.

770
01:05:00,603 --> 01:05:03,367
I don't watch TV.

771
01:05:03,439 --> 01:05:04,770
Is this him?

772
01:05:04,841 --> 01:05:07,366
Yeah, that's him, that's him.

773
01:05:07,477 --> 01:05:10,776
What are you gonna do to us?

774
01:05:12,382 --> 01:05:13,849
Tell me more aboutJeffrey.

775
01:05:15,551 --> 01:05:18,179
Jeffrey started getting bored
with the shit we do--

776
01:05:18,287 --> 01:05:20,915
picketing, leafleting,
letter-writing stuff.

777
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:23,823
He said we were ineffectual,
liberal jerkoffs.

778
01:05:23,893 --> 01:05:28,796
He wanted to do guerrilla actions
in order to educate the public.

779
01:05:28,865 --> 01:05:31,993
- Like this?
- He let 1 00 snakes loose in the Senate.

780
01:05:33,302 --> 01:05:36,829
But we weren't into that kind of stuff.
It's counterproductive. We told him.

781
01:05:36,906 --> 01:05:40,273
So he and 1 1 guys,
they split off...

782
01:05:40,376 --> 01:05:42,503
and formed this underground army.

783
01:05:43,946 --> 01:05:47,347
The Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys.
See?

784
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:52,019
They started planning
a "human hunt."

785
01:05:52,088 --> 01:05:54,386
They bought stun guns,
nets and bear traps.

786
01:05:54,457 --> 01:05:56,891
Theywere gonna go to Wall Street
and trap lawyers and bankers.

787
01:05:56,959 --> 01:05:59,450
They didn't do it, of course.
They didn't do any ofit.

788
01:05:59,529 --> 01:06:03,226
Like always, Mr. Big Shot
sold his friends out.

789
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:05,597
What does that mean?

790
01:06:05,668 --> 01:06:08,603
He goes on TV and gives this big
news conference, tells the world...

791
01:06:08,671 --> 01:06:11,663
he just realized his dad's experiments
are vital for humanity...

792
01:06:11,774 --> 01:06:14,675
and that the use of animals
is absolutely necessary...

793
01:06:14,744 --> 01:06:19,681
that from now on, he,Jeffrey Goines,
will personally supervise the labs...

794
01:06:19,782 --> 01:06:22,683
to make sure all the little animals
aren't going to suffer.

795
01:06:28,124 --> 01:06:29,785
What is this?

796
01:06:38,868 --> 01:06:42,360
People like that aren't accessible.
You can'tjust barge in on them.

797
01:06:42,438 --> 01:06:45,305
- It's not how theworld works.
- Be quiet and drive the car.

798
01:06:45,408 --> 01:06:47,376
- I know what I'm doing.
- No, you don't.

799
01:06:47,477 --> 01:06:51,140
This car is stolen,
and we are in big trouble.

800
01:06:51,247 --> 01:06:53,215
Big trouble.

801
01:06:53,316 --> 01:06:56,843
Ifyou don't turn yourself over to
the police, they're going to kill you.

802
01:06:56,919 --> 01:06:59,183
They're going to shoot me, too,
because I'm an accessory to murder.

803
01:06:59,255 --> 01:07:03,453
- You're all going to die.
- Nobody is going to die.

804
01:07:06,262 --> 01:07:09,959
You're not going to save the world,
okay? You're delusional.

805
01:07:10,032 --> 01:07:13,058
You've made all this up
out ofbits and pieces in your head.

806
01:07:13,136 --> 01:07:15,468
- No.
- Yes!

807
01:07:15,538 --> 01:07:17,529
Let me giveyou an example.

808
01:07:17,607 --> 01:07:21,065
You knowJeffrey Goines. You were
both patients at County Hospital.

809
01:07:21,177 --> 01:07:25,511
Jeffrey Goines was a fruitcake.

810
01:07:25,581 --> 01:07:29,745
He told you that his fatherwas a famous
scientist who worked with viruses...

811
01:07:29,819 --> 01:07:32,788
soyou incorporated that information
to this cockeyed fantasy.

812
01:07:32,855 --> 01:07:35,415
He didn't say his fatherwas
a scientist. He said his fatherwas God.

813
01:07:35,491 --> 01:07:37,083
This is insane.

814
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,425
Prominentpsychiatrist andauthor
Dr. Kathryn Raillyhas been abducted...

815
01:07:40,496 --> 01:07:43,624
by a dangerous mental patient,
James Cole,

816
01:07:43,699 --> 01:07:45,599
Cole was under Railly's care
sixyears ago...

817
01:07:45,668 --> 01:07:48,865
when he made
a dramatic escape--

818
01:07:55,745 --> 01:08:00,045
- What is the matter with your leg?
- I got shot.

819
01:08:00,116 --> 01:08:01,447
Shot?

820
01:08:01,517 --> 01:08:02,950
Who shot you?

821
01:08:04,359 --> 01:08:07,089
I don't know.
It was some kind of war. Never mind.

822
01:08:07,161 --> 01:08:09,561
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

823
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,359
What are you doing?

824
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:16,595
- We don't need gas.
- I thoughtyou didn't know how to drive.

825
01:08:16,671 --> 01:08:19,538
I said I was tooyoung to drive.
I didn't say I was stupid.

826
01:08:21,376 --> 01:08:23,276
This can't go on.

827
01:08:23,344 --> 01:08:26,370
if you have a bullet in your leg,
I have to take care ofit.

828
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:29,473
I'm a doctor.
I need some supplies.

829
01:08:51,606 --> 01:08:53,574
Meanwhile,
in Fresno, California...

830
01:08:53,674 --> 01:08:56,108
where mining engineers
continue their attempt...

831
01:08:56,177 --> 01:09:01,240
to sink a shaft parallel to the one
in which Ricky is believed trapped...

832
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:03,909
authorities say there is still a chance
the boy might be alive,

833
01:09:04,018 --> 01:09:08,148
You shouldn't put your weight on it.
You need stitches and antibiotics.

834
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:12,718
Lucky for you,
it's near the surface.

835
01:09:17,698 --> 01:09:20,223
I love seeing the sun.

836
01:09:24,505 --> 01:09:27,133
Wait.

837
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:29,836
Let me help you.

838
01:09:34,282 --> 01:09:36,716
You smell so good.

839
01:09:38,786 --> 01:09:41,550
You have to give yourself up.

840
01:09:44,325 --> 01:09:45,792
You know that?

841
01:09:52,099 --> 01:09:54,499
What are you doing? James?

842
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:57,299
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

843
01:09:59,674 --> 01:10:02,370
- Stop it! What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

844
01:10:02,443 --> 01:10:03,740
Let go of me!

845
01:10:10,485 --> 01:10:12,453
- They find him?
- Who?

846
01:10:12,553 --> 01:10:15,078
- That kid, the one in the pipe.
- You believe that?

847
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:17,282
They're lowering a monkey
down there...

848
01:10:17,358 --> 01:10:19,553
with an infrared camera
strapped on him...

849
01:10:19,627 --> 01:10:22,460
and a roast beef sandwich
wrapped up in tin foil.

850
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:24,623
- You're makin' it up.
- I shityou not, man.

851
01:10:24,699 --> 01:10:28,795
- Life is reallyweird.
- A monkey and a roast beefsandwich.

852
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:41,607
Would that I could enjoy
this opulent dinner...

853
01:10:41,716 --> 01:10:46,050
and this most stimulating
and exciting company...

854
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:50,284
for itself,
with no sense of purpose.

855
01:10:50,358 --> 01:10:53,953
But, alas, I am burdened.

856
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:59,296
Forwith all this excess of public
attention and cacophony of praise...

857
01:10:59,367 --> 01:11:03,599
there comes great responsibility.

858
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:07,903
I don't have to tell you all
that the dangers ofscience...

859
01:11:07,975 --> 01:11:10,603
are a timeworn threat.

860
01:11:10,678 --> 01:11:13,238
From Prometheus stealing fire
from the gods--

861
01:11:13,347 --> 01:11:17,044
What friend?
I'm not expecting anyone.

862
01:11:17,184 --> 01:11:19,948
But never before--

863
01:11:20,021 --> 01:11:22,182
This is ridiculous.

864
01:11:22,256 --> 01:11:25,714
My father's giving
a major address.

865
01:11:25,793 --> 01:11:28,057
...to fear the power...

866
01:11:29,397 --> 01:11:31,422
we have at hand.

867
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:35,061
Normally, ifwe caught a guy...

868
01:11:35,136 --> 01:11:37,229
sneaking around with no ID,
we'd bust his ass.

869
01:11:37,305 --> 01:11:39,705
Excuse my French.

870
01:11:39,774 --> 01:11:41,765
This one says he knows you.

871
01:11:41,876 --> 01:11:45,243
Sinceyou seem to have had
a few unusual associates...

872
01:11:45,313 --> 01:11:48,544
we certainlywould not want
to arrest one of your closest pals.

873
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,793
Never seen him before
in my life.

874
01:12:07,868 --> 01:12:10,530
Feel free to torture this man,
orwhatever it is you do.

875
01:12:10,605 --> 01:12:13,972
I'm going back to listen to my father's
eloquent discourse on the perils of--

876
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:17,238
I'm here about some monkeys.

877
01:12:17,311 --> 01:12:20,212
- Monkeys?
- Monkeys, yes.

878
01:12:20,314 --> 01:12:23,249
Twelve ofthem.

879
01:12:26,354 --> 01:12:28,117
Arnold.

880
01:12:28,189 --> 01:12:30,453
- You look like shit.
- You know this man?

881
01:12:30,524 --> 01:12:34,585
Of course I know this man.
Arnold Pettibone.

882
01:12:34,662 --> 01:12:37,893
Gee, Arnie, it's black tie.
I said, " Drop by."

883
01:12:37,965 --> 01:12:41,901
But it's Dad's big do--
VI Ps, senators, secret service.

884
01:12:41,969 --> 01:12:44,904
You hungry, Arnie?

885
01:12:44,972 --> 01:12:47,065
Real killer feast we're putting on.

886
01:12:47,141 --> 01:12:49,735
Lots of dead lamb, dead cow,
dead pig.

887
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:51,710
Shall we?

888
01:12:51,779 --> 01:12:54,043
Hi. How are you? Hello.

889
01:12:54,181 --> 01:12:57,582
Very attractive.
"The Great Escape," 1 990.

890
01:12:57,652 --> 01:13:00,587
Watch it! Huh?
County Hospital? Am I right?

891
01:13:00,688 --> 01:13:03,418
I can't do anything
aboutwhatyou're going to do.

892
01:13:03,491 --> 01:13:06,517
I can't change anything.
I won't stopyou. I can't stopyou.

893
01:13:06,627 --> 01:13:09,391
- I justwant the information.
- Come on.

894
01:13:09,463 --> 01:13:13,024
Hi, ladies. So nice to seeyou again.
Watch your step on the way down.

895
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:16,092
All right. Who blabbed?
Bruhns? Weller?

896
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:18,195
I justwant access
to the pure virus.

897
01:13:18,272 --> 01:13:21,605
- Virus?
- I need to know where and what it is.

898
01:13:21,676 --> 01:13:25,544
I get it. I see whatyou're up to.
It's your old plan, isn't it?

899
01:13:25,613 --> 01:13:27,604
- What plan?
- Your plan.

900
01:13:27,715 --> 01:13:30,149
-I don't know whatyou're talking about.
-Yes, you do.

901
01:13:30,217 --> 01:13:32,276
We were in the dayroom
watching television...

902
01:13:32,386 --> 01:13:35,150
and you were upset about the desecration
ofthe planet, which I understand.

903
01:13:35,222 --> 01:13:38,282
Then you said, "Wouldn't it be great
to have a germ orvirus...

904
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:41,157
that would wipe out mankind
and leave the animals and trees?"

905
01:13:41,228 --> 01:13:43,492
- You're trying to confuse me.
- You were so funny.

906
01:13:43,564 --> 01:13:45,794
I told you my father
was this famous virologist.

907
01:13:45,866 --> 01:13:50,166
You said, " He could make a germ,
and we could steal it."

908
01:13:50,237 --> 01:13:53,172
- You were so funny.
- They mutate! We live underground!

909
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,765
The world belongs
to the dogs and cats.

910
01:13:55,843 --> 01:13:59,939
We live like worms.
I just need the information!

911
01:14:00,047 --> 01:14:03,608
-Take it easy.
-You are a nutcase, completely deranged!

912
01:14:03,718 --> 01:14:08,246
Delusional, paranoid.
Your process is all fucked up.

913
01:14:08,355 --> 01:14:11,119
Your information tray
is jammed, man.

914
01:14:11,192 --> 01:14:13,490
Doyou know what it is,
the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys?

915
01:14:13,561 --> 01:14:16,394
It's a collection of space-case
do-gooders saving rain forests.

916
01:14:16,497 --> 01:14:18,692
I have nothing to do
with those bozos anymore.

917
01:14:18,766 --> 01:14:23,169
I've quit being the rich-kid fall guy
for a bunch ofineffective fanatics!

918
01:14:23,237 --> 01:14:25,967
So much for your grand plot,
asshole!

919
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,304
My father has warned people
about the dangers...

920
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:30,605
of experimenting with DNA viruses
foryears.

921
01:14:30,678 --> 01:14:34,273
You processed that information through
your addled, paranoid infrastructure.

922
01:14:34,381 --> 01:14:36,872
Lo and behold,
a nonprofit organization...

923
01:14:36,984 --> 01:14:39,851
becomes a sinister,
revolutionary cabal!

924
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,047
This man is complete bat shit!

925
01:14:42,123 --> 01:14:43,750
Ladies and gentlemen...

926
01:14:43,824 --> 01:14:47,089
doyou realize where he thinks
he comes from?

927
01:14:49,597 --> 01:14:52,532
Captain Dan Miller, the man
in charge ofthe rescue operation...

928
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,727
says he has consulted with experts...

929
01:14:54,802 --> 01:14:56,997
and they assure us
there will be no negative--

930
01:14:57,071 --> 01:15:00,666
If you ask me, the monkey's gonna eat
that goddamn sandwich himself.

931
01:15:00,741 --> 01:15:03,505
Did a man just come
running through here?

932
01:15:03,577 --> 01:15:07,673
His primaryresponsibility
was to the missing boy,

933
01:15:07,782 --> 01:15:09,943
Police say
that the body of a woman...

934
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:12,314
foundstrangled
in Knutson State Park...

935
01:15:12,386 --> 01:15:14,354
could be kidnapping victim...

936
01:15:14,455 --> 01:15:16,423
Dr. Kathryn Railly,

937
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:22,127
Anybody see someone
come through here?

938
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:25,426
The body was discovered
less than an hour ago by hikers,

939
01:15:25,499 --> 01:15:28,332
But we have an unconfirmed report
that the victim...

940
01:15:28,435 --> 01:15:30,665
a woman in her late 20s
or early 30s...

941
01:15:30,738 --> 01:15:32,706
was savagely mutilated,

942
01:15:32,773 --> 01:15:35,936
Earlier in the day, police located
Railly's abandoned car,

943
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:38,672
It was found not far from--

944
01:15:40,648 --> 01:15:41,910
Any sign of him?

945
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,517
Nothing.

946
01:15:46,187 --> 01:15:47,745
He can't just disappear.

947
01:16:08,008 --> 01:16:10,135
You bastard!

948
01:16:12,646 --> 01:16:16,707
I could have died in there,
you son of a bitch!

949
01:16:16,817 --> 01:16:19,149
What are you thinking of...

950
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:22,155
you twisted sack of shit?

951
01:16:23,891 --> 01:16:27,156
Sorry I locked you in the trunk.

952
01:16:27,228 --> 01:16:29,662
I'm sick of you.

953
01:16:35,669 --> 01:16:38,934
What have you done?
Did you kill somebody?

954
01:16:39,006 --> 01:16:40,598
Yes.

955
01:16:40,674 --> 01:16:44,075
- A million people, five billion people.
- What?

956
01:16:44,144 --> 01:16:49,275
Jeffrey Goines said that it
was my idea about the virus.

957
01:16:49,383 --> 01:16:54,650
We were in the institution.
It was all so fuzzy with the drugs.

958
01:16:54,722 --> 01:16:56,815
Doyou think It was my idea?

959
01:16:56,891 --> 01:16:59,621
Doyou think maybe
I wiped out the human race?

960
01:16:59,693 --> 01:17:02,753
Nobody is gonna wipe out
the human race.

961
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:05,890
Notyou orJeffrey
or anybody else.

962
01:17:05,966 --> 01:17:09,265
You've created something
in your mind.

963
01:17:09,336 --> 01:17:12,134
- Mentally divergent?
- Whatever.

964
01:17:12,206 --> 01:17:15,698
A substitute reality...

965
01:17:15,809 --> 01:17:19,472
because you don't want
to deal with anything.

966
01:17:19,546 --> 01:17:23,107
I would love it
ifthat was true.

967
01:17:23,217 --> 01:17:25,981
It can be dealt with,
but only if you want to.

968
01:17:26,053 --> 01:17:28,453
I can help you.

969
01:17:30,624 --> 01:17:32,854
- They're after me.
- Who is after you?

970
01:17:32,927 --> 01:17:37,023
We have to get out of here.
There were policemen at that party.

971
01:17:38,432 --> 01:17:41,196
Party? You went to a--

972
01:17:41,268 --> 01:17:43,065
Never mind.

973
01:17:43,137 --> 01:17:46,197
It's important you surrender instead
ofthem catching you running away.

974
01:17:46,273 --> 01:17:49,333
Wouldn't it be great ifl was crazy?
Then the world would be okay.

975
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:51,401
- Give me the gun. Where is the gun?
- I lost the gun.

976
01:17:51,478 --> 01:17:53,708
I could live right here.

977
01:17:53,814 --> 01:17:57,250
You got water, air, stars.

978
01:17:57,351 --> 01:17:59,512
- I'm gonna attract their attention.
- Debris.

979
01:17:59,586 --> 01:18:02,578
I'm gonna attract their attention
so they know where we are.

980
01:18:04,258 --> 01:18:05,885
I love this world!

981
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,394
They're gonna tell you to putyour hands
on your head. Do what they say.

982
01:18:08,462 --> 01:18:10,521
I love the frogs, the spiders.

983
01:18:10,597 --> 01:18:12,189
I'll be with you.

984
01:18:12,266 --> 01:18:15,360
I'll help you. I won't let them--

985
01:18:26,246 --> 01:18:29,238
Then I said something about cooperating,
and he said he would do that.

986
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:32,808
So I got in the car.

987
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,014
Thanks. And when I--

988
01:18:36,123 --> 01:18:40,423
I started honking the horn,
and when I got out, he was gone.

989
01:18:40,494 --> 01:18:42,792
I tell you something.
You lucked out.

990
01:18:42,863 --> 01:18:45,798
For a while we thoughtyou were a body
found down state, mutilated.

991
01:18:45,866 --> 01:18:49,358
- He wouldn't do that.
- This the man he attacked?

992
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,806
I want to be clear
about this, okay?

993
01:18:55,876 --> 01:18:58,208
This man and the other one
were severely beating us.

994
01:18:58,278 --> 01:19:02,237
James Cole didn't start it.
In fact, he saved me.

995
01:19:04,451 --> 01:19:05,850
Funny thing, Doctor.

996
01:19:05,919 --> 01:19:10,356
Maybeyou can help explain it to me,
you being a psychiatrist and all.

997
01:19:10,457 --> 01:19:15,622
Why do kidnap victims always tell us
about the guys that grabbed 'em...

998
01:19:15,696 --> 01:19:18,756
and they try
to make us understand...

999
01:19:18,832 --> 01:19:21,858
how kind these bastards reallywere.

1000
01:19:21,969 --> 01:19:25,200
It's a normal reaction
to a life-threatening situation.

1001
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:30,642
He's sick, okay?

1002
01:19:31,845 --> 01:19:34,370
He thinks he comes
from the future.

1003
01:19:34,515 --> 01:19:37,484
He lives in a meticulously constructed
fantasyworld that's disintegrating.

1004
01:19:37,584 --> 01:19:40,018
He needs help.

1005
01:19:47,895 --> 01:19:51,331
Exhaustedbut apparently unharmed
byher 30-hour ordeal...

1006
01:19:51,398 --> 01:19:55,630
Dr. Railly returned to Baltimore
without making a public statement,

1007
01:19:55,702 --> 01:19:59,433
The author and psychiatrist
is currently in seclusion at her home,

1008
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:03,306
Meantime, police have pieced together
a scenario ofthe series of events...

1009
01:20:03,377 --> 01:20:06,744
that began with escaped
mental patientJames Cole--

1010
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,848
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1011
01:20:08,949 --> 01:20:12,476
I 'm just hyper-alert.
I can't sleep.

1012
01:20:12,586 --> 01:20:17,216
- Did you take a sedative?
- I hate those things. They mess me up.

1013
01:20:19,993 --> 01:20:22,723
With the kidnapping
ofthe Baltimore woman,James Cole...

1014
01:20:22,796 --> 01:20:24,821
is now also wanted in connection...

1015
01:20:24,898 --> 01:20:28,390
with the brutal slaying ofRodney
Wiggins, an ex-convict from Ardmore,

1016
01:20:28,469 --> 01:20:31,495
His body was discovered
in an abandoned theater...

1017
01:20:31,572 --> 01:20:35,030
not far from where Cole left 3 animal
rights activists bound and gagged...

1018
01:20:35,109 --> 01:20:37,669
in their SecondA venue headquarters,

1019
01:20:37,744 --> 01:20:41,908
Now, do they real ly bel ieve that he's
going to show up here? Please.

1020
01:20:42,015 --> 01:20:45,075
In Fresno, California, the cornfield
that wasjammed with spectators--

1021
01:20:45,185 --> 01:20:47,380
He's dead, isn't he?
That little boy.

1022
01:20:47,454 --> 01:20:50,912
He's fine. It was just a prank
he and his friends pulled.

1023
01:20:51,024 --> 01:20:54,323
The dramatic attempts to rescue Ricky
Neuman from an abandoned mine shaft...

1024
01:20:54,394 --> 01:20:56,794
endedabruptly
when playmates confessed...

1025
01:20:56,864 --> 01:20:58,889
that Neuman's disappearance
was a prank,

1026
01:20:58,966 --> 01:21:02,197
In fact, the missing child
was hiding in a nearby barn,

1027
01:21:11,278 --> 01:21:15,237
I found my thrill

1028
01:21:15,349 --> 01:21:19,080
On Blueberry Hill

1029
01:21:19,153 --> 01:21:21,121
On Blueberry Hill

1030
01:21:23,157 --> 01:21:25,216
When I foundyou

1031
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:27,760
Congratulations, Cole.

1032
01:21:27,828 --> 01:21:30,126
Wel I done. Wel I done.

1033
01:21:30,197 --> 01:21:32,995
During your interview,
while you were under the influence...

1034
01:21:33,066 --> 01:21:34,465
you told us you liked music.

1035
01:21:34,535 --> 01:21:36,662
- This isn't a prison,James.
- This is a hospital.

1036
01:21:36,737 --> 01:21:39,797
- Until you recoveryour equilibrium.
- You're still a little disoriented.

1037
01:21:39,873 --> 01:21:44,071
- Time travel is a very stressful thing.
- You stood up verywell, considering.

1038
01:21:44,144 --> 01:21:47,170
You connected theTwelve Monkeys
with a famous virologist and his son.

1039
01:21:47,281 --> 01:21:49,806
- Others will take over now.
- We'll be back in service in months.

1040
01:21:49,917 --> 01:21:51,009
We'll retake the planet.

1041
01:21:51,118 --> 01:21:53,643
This is whatyou've been working for.

1042
01:21:53,754 --> 01:21:56,245
- A full pardon.
- You'll be out of here in no time.

1043
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:59,359
- Women will want to get to knowyou.
- I don't wantyourwomen!

1044
01:21:59,459 --> 01:22:01,950
I want to get well!

1045
01:22:06,033 --> 01:22:08,467
And you will be well,James.

1046
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:11,367
Soon.

1047
01:22:15,242 --> 01:22:18,006
You know, you people don't exist.
You're not real.

1048
01:22:18,078 --> 01:22:20,512
We can't travel back in time.

1049
01:22:22,549 --> 01:22:26,417
You're not here.
You can't trick me.

1050
01:22:28,222 --> 01:22:31,919
You're in my mind.

1051
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:37,353
I am insane,
and you are my insanity.

1052
01:22:47,541 --> 01:22:49,566
He not only
used the word "prank"...

1053
01:22:49,643 --> 01:22:51,736
he said the boy
was hiding in a barn.

1054
01:22:51,812 --> 01:22:55,578
Kathryn, Kathryn,
he kidnapped you.

1055
01:22:55,682 --> 01:22:58,242
You saw him murder somebody...

1056
01:22:58,285 --> 01:23:00,412
and you knew there was
a real possibility...

1057
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,954
he could kill you too.

1058
01:23:03,056 --> 01:23:05,524
You're under tremendous
emotional stress.

1059
01:23:05,592 --> 01:23:08,026
For God's sake, Owen,
listen to me.

1060
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:09,995
He knew about the boy in Fresno...

1061
01:23:10,063 --> 01:23:12,224
and he says five billion people
are gonna die.

1062
01:23:12,299 --> 01:23:14,893
No way he could possibly know that.

1063
01:23:17,638 --> 01:23:20,869
You're a rational person.
You're a trained psychiatrist.

1064
01:23:20,941 --> 01:23:24,001
You know the difference
between what's real and what's not.

1065
01:23:24,077 --> 01:23:27,069
What we say is the truth
is what everybody accepts, right?

1066
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:29,614
Psychiatry is the latest religion.

1067
01:23:29,683 --> 01:23:33,414
We decide what's right and wrong.
We decide who's crazy or not.

1068
01:23:35,822 --> 01:23:37,949
I'm in trouble here.

1069
01:23:38,025 --> 01:23:39,959
I'm losing my faith.

1070
01:23:41,328 --> 01:23:44,297
Yousure fuckedup, Bob,

1071
01:23:44,364 --> 01:23:46,389
But I can understand,

1072
01:23:46,466 --> 01:23:49,458
You don't wantyour mistakes
pointed out toyou,

1073
01:23:49,536 --> 01:23:52,198
I can relate to that, old Bob,

1074
01:23:54,174 --> 01:23:56,267
I know whatyou're thinkin',

1075
01:23:56,343 --> 01:24:00,575
You're thinkin' I don't exist
except in your head,

1076
01:24:00,681 --> 01:24:02,672
I can see that point ofview,

1077
01:24:02,783 --> 01:24:06,685
Butyou could still talk to me,
couldn'tya?

1078
01:24:06,753 --> 01:24:08,618
I saw you...

1079
01:24:08,689 --> 01:24:12,284
in 1 996, in the real world.

1080
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:16,386
- You pulled out your teeth.
- Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?

1081
01:24:16,463 --> 01:24:18,556
That's a no-no,

1082
01:24:18,632 --> 01:24:21,760
And when didyou sayyou saw me?

1083
01:24:21,835 --> 01:24:24,633
- In 1 872?
- Leave me alone!

1084
01:24:24,705 --> 01:24:28,300
Yellin' won't getyou
whatyou want,

1085
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:32,175
You have to be smart
to get whatyou want,

1086
01:24:34,648 --> 01:24:38,709
- What do I want?
- You don't know whatyou want?

1087
01:24:38,819 --> 01:24:41,788
Sure you do, Bob,

1088
01:24:41,855 --> 01:24:44,119
You know whatyou want,

1089
01:24:44,191 --> 01:24:47,251
You tell me.
Tell me what I want.

1090
01:24:47,361 --> 01:24:51,855
To see the sky and the ocean...

1091
01:24:51,932 --> 01:24:54,560
to be topside...

1092
01:24:54,668 --> 01:24:57,159
breathe the air...

1093
01:24:57,237 --> 01:25:00,570
to be with her,

1094
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:03,074
Isn't that right?

1095
01:25:03,143 --> 01:25:06,306
Isn't that whatyou want?

1096
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:08,211
Bob?

1097
01:25:25,165 --> 01:25:29,659
J im Halperin, Philly PD.
Sorry to call you so early.

1098
01:25:29,736 --> 01:25:33,297
You found him? Is he okay?

1099
01:25:33,373 --> 01:25:35,671
No, no.
Au contraire, Doctor.

1100
01:25:35,742 --> 01:25:37,767
No sign of your good friend,
the kidnapper.

1101
01:25:37,844 --> 01:25:40,142
However, the plot does thicken.

1102
01:25:40,247 --> 01:25:42,511
I got a ballistics report here
on my desk.

1103
01:25:42,616 --> 01:25:45,141
It says the bullet you claim
you removed from Cole's thigh...

1104
01:25:45,252 --> 01:25:47,220
is, in fact, an antique.

1105
01:25:47,287 --> 01:25:49,187
Andall indications are...

1106
01:25:49,256 --> 01:25:52,987
it was firedsometime
prior to the 1 920s,

1107
01:25:53,059 --> 01:25:55,289
- How about I take a spin down there?
- This can't be.

1108
01:25:55,362 --> 01:25:57,353
You and I can grab a bite to eat...

1109
01:25:57,431 --> 01:25:59,695
and maybe you could revise
or amplify your statement.

1110
01:26:35,435 --> 01:26:39,804
You can't trick us,you know.
It wouldn't work,

1111
01:26:39,873 --> 01:26:41,204
No, sir.

1112
01:26:42,142 --> 01:26:45,509
You haven't become addicted,
have you...

1113
01:26:45,579 --> 01:26:47,410
to that dying world?

1114
01:26:47,514 --> 01:26:49,914
No, sir.

1115
01:26:49,983 --> 01:26:52,383
I just want to do my part
to get us back on top...

1116
01:26:52,452 --> 01:26:54,511
in charge of the planet.

1117
01:26:54,621 --> 01:26:58,216
And I have the experience.
I know the people involved.

1118
01:26:59,226 --> 01:27:01,319
He really is the most qualified.

1119
01:27:01,394 --> 01:27:03,453
But all that behavior.

1120
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:06,124
You said we weren't real.

1121
01:27:06,933 --> 01:27:09,993
I don't think the human mind
is meant to exist...

1122
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:11,970
in two different...

1123
01:27:12,072 --> 01:27:15,564
whateveryou called it,
dimensions?

1124
01:27:15,642 --> 01:27:18,839
It's just too stressful.
You said thatyourself.

1125
01:27:18,912 --> 01:27:21,540
It's very confusing. You don't know
what's real and what's not.

1126
01:27:21,648 --> 01:27:24,742
Butyou know what's real now.

1127
01:27:24,851 --> 01:27:26,614
Yes, sir, I do.

1128
01:27:29,089 --> 01:27:31,421
No, I don't know anything about...

1129
01:27:31,491 --> 01:27:34,085
a monkey army, Doctor.

1130
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,924
No, nothing whatsoever.

1131
01:27:36,997 --> 01:27:41,331
Good Lord, if my son was ever
involved in something like that--

1132
01:27:42,802 --> 01:27:45,430
Yeah? Well, I'm sorry.

1133
01:27:45,505 --> 01:27:49,703
I think it's doubly inappropriate
to discuss...

1134
01:27:49,776 --> 01:27:54,042
security matters with you,
Dr. Railly.

1135
01:27:54,147 --> 01:27:57,583
But ifit will easeyour mind...

1136
01:27:57,684 --> 01:28:00,084
rest assured that neither my son...

1137
01:28:00,153 --> 01:28:02,451
nor any other unauthorized person...

1138
01:28:02,522 --> 01:28:07,585
has access to potentially
dangerous organisms in my laboratory.

1139
01:28:07,661 --> 01:28:11,859
Is that clear toyou now?
Thank you so much for your concern.

1140
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:19,298
Women psychiatrists!

1141
01:28:21,942 --> 01:28:25,070
I attended a lecture
ofhers once.

1142
01:28:25,145 --> 01:28:28,774
"Apocalyptic Visions."

1143
01:28:28,882 --> 01:28:31,976
She was suddenly struck...

1144
01:28:32,085 --> 01:28:36,044
by the most preposterous notion
about Jeffrey.

1145
01:28:37,824 --> 01:28:41,021
Has she succumbed to her own...

1146
01:28:41,094 --> 01:28:45,087
"theoretical" Cassandra disease?

1147
01:28:47,434 --> 01:28:51,734
Maybe we ought to review
our security procedures.

1148
01:28:52,505 --> 01:28:55,372
Perhaps upgrade 'em,
you know?

1149
01:28:55,442 --> 01:28:57,433
Beef'em up.

1150
01:29:02,549 --> 01:29:04,915
Let's consider again
our current information.

1151
01:29:04,985 --> 01:29:08,079
Ifthe symptoms were
first detected in Philadelphia...

1152
01:29:08,188 --> 01:29:11,885
on December 27, 1 996,
that makes us know that--

1153
01:29:11,992 --> 01:29:15,519
It was released in Philadelphia
probably on December 1 3, 1 996.

1154
01:29:15,595 --> 01:29:19,531
And was seen sequentially
after that in--

1155
01:29:19,599 --> 01:29:21,533
San Francisco, New Orleans...

1156
01:29:21,601 --> 01:29:24,126
Rio deJaneiro...

1157
01:29:24,204 --> 01:29:26,832
Rome, Kinshasa...

1158
01:29:26,906 --> 01:29:28,931
Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.

1159
01:29:32,512 --> 01:29:34,503
That was verywell done.

1160
01:29:45,425 --> 01:29:47,791
if you're in there,
I have to talk toyou!

1161
01:29:49,295 --> 01:29:53,197
It's the kidnap woman. The one
who was with the guywho tied us up.

1162
01:29:53,266 --> 01:29:55,826
Turn offthe lights.
Turn offthe light!

1163
01:29:55,902 --> 01:29:58,837
- What's she doin'?
- She's drawing attention to us.

1164
01:29:58,938 --> 01:30:03,739
I don't knowwhatyou're up to,
butyou're gonna get us in deep shit.

1165
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:07,007
Walkies ready,
batteries charged?

1166
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:10,607
I sawyou!
I saw somebody in there!

1167
01:30:10,717 --> 01:30:14,881
Secret experiments.
That's what they do.

1168
01:30:14,954 --> 01:30:18,754
Secret, weird stuff.

1169
01:30:18,825 --> 01:30:21,589
- Not just on animals.
- I know you.

1170
01:30:21,661 --> 01:30:25,222
- Do 'em on people too down at--
- Have you seen James Cole?

1171
01:30:25,298 --> 01:30:27,459
They're watching you.

1172
01:30:27,534 --> 01:30:29,729
- Takin' pictures.
- The police.

1173
01:30:29,803 --> 01:30:31,794
I know. Look.

1174
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:36,331
I have to contact James.

1175
01:30:36,409 --> 01:30:40,311
It's very, very important that
he's really careful when he reaches me.

1176
01:30:40,413 --> 01:30:42,040
Doyou understand that?

1177
01:30:42,148 --> 01:30:44,116
- Good.
- Who's James?

1178
01:30:44,184 --> 01:30:48,177
He was with me.
He spoke toyou several weeks ago.

1179
01:30:48,288 --> 01:30:52,349
He said thatyou were from the future
and thatyou were watching him.

1180
01:30:59,365 --> 01:31:02,766
Bolt cutters.
Did you get the bolt cutters?

1181
01:31:02,836 --> 01:31:04,827
One dozen. They're in the van.

1182
01:31:04,904 --> 01:31:09,603
- The plans for the security system?
- All right here, committed to memory.

1183
01:31:09,676 --> 01:31:12,770
- You know what she's doin' out there?
- What's it say?

1184
01:31:12,846 --> 01:31:14,279
I can't see it.

1185
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:17,747
Forget about my psychiatrist
and concentrate on the task at hand.

1186
01:31:19,719 --> 01:31:21,619
Your psychiatrist?

1187
01:31:21,688 --> 01:31:26,216
- Did you just sayyour psychiatrist?
- Ex-psychiatrist.

1188
01:31:26,292 --> 01:31:28,157
This woman was your psychiatrist...

1189
01:31:28,228 --> 01:31:29,456
and now she's spray-painting
our building?

1190
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:40,229
What's it say?

1191
01:31:52,919 --> 01:31:55,080
- What?
- There's a policeman over there.

1192
01:31:55,155 --> 01:31:57,385
- Pretend you don't know me.
- I want to turn myselfin.

1193
01:31:57,457 --> 01:32:00,858
- Where is he?
- James! Down!

1194
01:32:00,927 --> 01:32:04,021
No, it's okay.
I'm not crazy any more.

1195
01:32:04,097 --> 01:32:07,897
I mean, I am. I'm mentally divergent.
I know that now.

1196
01:32:07,967 --> 01:32:11,300
I wantyou to help me.
I want to get better.

1197
01:32:15,208 --> 01:32:17,176
Let's get outta here.

1198
01:32:17,243 --> 01:32:19,108
He's going. Go!

1199
01:32:30,657 --> 01:32:33,421
- I've seen that before.
- No, you haven't.

1200
01:32:37,363 --> 01:32:40,264
A guy in a Ford is chasing her
and some other guy I can't see.

1201
01:32:40,333 --> 01:32:43,598
No problem. It's probably
just another kidnapping...

1202
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:45,763
featuring Jeffrey's shrink.

1203
01:32:45,839 --> 01:32:49,036
Pardon me.
Make that ex-shrink.

1204
01:32:49,108 --> 01:32:53,044
This is your leader?
A certifiable lunatic...

1205
01:32:53,146 --> 01:32:55,137
who told his former psychiatrist
all his plans...

1206
01:32:55,248 --> 01:32:57,648
for God knows what
wacko irresponsible schemes?

1207
01:32:57,717 --> 01:32:59,651
God knows what she's written
on that wall!

1208
01:32:59,752 --> 01:33:02,880
Who cares what psychiatrists
write on walls?

1209
01:33:02,956 --> 01:33:05,584
You think I told her about
the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys?

1210
01:33:05,658 --> 01:33:08,957
Impossible! Doyou know why?
Doyou know why?

1211
01:33:09,028 --> 01:33:11,519
Because,
you pathetically ineffectual...

1212
01:33:11,598 --> 01:33:15,295
and pusillanimous pretend friend
to animals, I'll tell you why.

1213
01:33:15,368 --> 01:33:17,802
Because when I had anything
to do with her sixyears ago...

1214
01:33:17,871 --> 01:33:20,135
there was no such thing,
I hadn't thought ofityet.

1215
01:33:20,206 --> 01:33:22,401
Then how come she knows
what's going on?

1216
01:33:22,475 --> 01:33:25,569
Well, here's my theory on that.

1217
01:33:25,645 --> 01:33:28,580
When I was institutionalized,
my brain was studied exhaustively...

1218
01:33:28,681 --> 01:33:30,444
in the guise of mental health.

1219
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:33,883
I was interrogated, x-rayed.
I was examined thoroughly.

1220
01:33:35,688 --> 01:33:38,316
Then they took everything about me
and put it into a computer...

1221
01:33:38,391 --> 01:33:40,916
where they created
this model of my mind.

1222
01:33:41,027 --> 01:33:43,086
Yes! Using that model...

1223
01:33:43,196 --> 01:33:45,630
they managed to generate
every thought...

1224
01:33:45,698 --> 01:33:47,859
I could possibly have
in the next ten years...

1225
01:33:47,934 --> 01:33:51,631
which they then filtered through
a probability matrix of some kind...

1226
01:33:51,704 --> 01:33:55,697
to determine everything
I was gonna do in that period.

1227
01:33:55,775 --> 01:33:57,766
So, you see...

1228
01:33:57,844 --> 01:33:59,869
she knew I was gonna lead
the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys...

1229
01:33:59,946 --> 01:34:03,074
into the pages ofhistory
before it even occurred to me.

1230
01:34:03,182 --> 01:34:06,618
She knows everything I'm ever gonna do
before I know it myself.

1231
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:08,687
How's that?

1232
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:13,515
Kweskin, you finish here.
I'll meet you there.

1233
01:34:13,593 --> 01:34:17,529
And if you forget one thing, I'll have
you shaved, sterilized and destroyed.

1234
01:34:17,597 --> 01:34:19,155
- Jeff?
- What?

1235
01:34:19,232 --> 01:34:21,826
You're a great man.

1236
01:34:21,901 --> 01:34:23,892
Fuck the bozos!

1237
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:30,066
He's seriously crazy.
You know that.

1238
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:01,263
There. Over there.

1239
01:35:02,608 --> 01:35:04,269
Okay. Come on.

1240
01:35:16,923 --> 01:35:19,084
- I need a room.
- Thirty-five bucks an hour.

1241
01:35:19,158 --> 01:35:22,321
- An hour?
- You want quarter hours?

1242
01:35:22,395 --> 01:35:24,090
Go someplace else.

1243
01:35:33,172 --> 01:35:34,935
Here's...

1244
01:35:35,008 --> 01:35:38,034
twenty-five, six, seven
for an hour.

1245
01:35:38,111 --> 01:35:39,908
Deal?

1246
01:35:44,817 --> 01:35:47,786
One hour, honey babe.
Number 64.

1247
01:35:47,854 --> 01:35:50,789
Sixth floor.
Up the stairs, end ofthe hall.

1248
01:35:50,857 --> 01:35:53,655
Elevator's busted.

1249
01:35:53,726 --> 01:35:55,421
She's not "honey babe."

1250
01:35:55,495 --> 01:35:59,056
She's a doctor.
My psychiatrist.

1251
01:35:59,132 --> 01:36:00,895
Understand?

1252
01:36:03,002 --> 01:36:05,800
Whatever gets it up for you,Jack.

1253
01:36:14,447 --> 01:36:17,245
Tommy, this is Charlie
over at the Globe.

1254
01:36:18,451 --> 01:36:20,510
You know ifWallace
has a new girl?

1255
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:25,057
Sort of a rookie type?
A little weird? Does fantasy acts?

1256
01:36:25,124 --> 01:36:28,890
Okay, you were standing there
looking up at the moon.

1257
01:36:28,961 --> 01:36:32,021
You were splashing through the water,
and then what?

1258
01:36:33,699 --> 01:36:35,894
I thought I was in prison again.

1259
01:36:35,968 --> 01:36:38,402
Just like that,
you were in prison?

1260
01:36:38,471 --> 01:36:41,065
No, not really.

1261
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:43,836
Likeyou said,
It was all in my mind.

1262
01:36:45,511 --> 01:36:47,240
You disappeared.

1263
01:36:47,346 --> 01:36:50,577
One minuteyou were there,
the next minuteyou were gone.

1264
01:36:50,683 --> 01:36:52,981
Did you run through thewoods, or--

1265
01:36:53,052 --> 01:36:57,079
I don't know.
I don't remember.

1266
01:36:58,558 --> 01:37:02,050
The boy in the well.
How did you know that was just a hoax?

1267
01:37:03,029 --> 01:37:06,590
It was?
I didn't know.

1268
01:37:06,666 --> 01:37:08,361
You said he was hiding
in a barn!

1269
01:37:08,468 --> 01:37:10,561
I think I maybe saw a TV show
about that...

1270
01:37:10,636 --> 01:37:12,831
when I was a kid where a boy--

1271
01:37:12,905 --> 01:37:15,100
It wasn't a TV show!
It was real!

1272
01:37:15,174 --> 01:37:18,302
Maybe this boy saw
the same TV show that I did...

1273
01:37:18,377 --> 01:37:20,311
and he copied it.

1274
01:37:20,379 --> 01:37:24,281
Look, you were right.
I am mentally ill.

1275
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:26,648
I imagined all these things,
these people.

1276
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:29,244
I know they're not real.

1277
01:37:29,388 --> 01:37:31,982
I can trick them.

1278
01:37:32,058 --> 01:37:34,458
I can make them do what I want.
I worked on 'em a little bit.

1279
01:37:34,527 --> 01:37:36,722
I got back here to get better.

1280
01:37:36,796 --> 01:37:41,426
- I can stay here.
- What does this mean to you?

1281
01:37:49,475 --> 01:37:52,967
I think I had a dream
about this.

1282
01:37:54,747 --> 01:37:58,615
You had a bullet from World War I
in your leg. How did it get there?

1283
01:37:58,684 --> 01:38:02,484
I don't know. You said I had delusions,
that I created this world.

1284
01:38:02,555 --> 01:38:05,956
- You said you could explain.
- I can't!

1285
01:38:06,025 --> 01:38:09,290
I'm trying to, and--

1286
01:38:09,362 --> 01:38:13,025
I can't believe that everything
we say or do has already happened.

1287
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:16,225
We can't change
what's gonna happen.

1288
01:38:16,302 --> 01:38:20,204
And iffive billion people
are gonna die, it's--

1289
01:38:20,273 --> 01:38:22,468
I want the future to be unknown.

1290
01:38:25,978 --> 01:38:27,969
I want to become
a whole person again.

1291
01:38:29,615 --> 01:38:31,583
I want this to be the present.

1292
01:38:33,019 --> 01:38:37,251
I want to stay here this time...

1293
01:38:37,323 --> 01:38:38,620
with you.

1294
01:39:07,453 --> 01:39:12,288
Doyou remember sixyears ago
you had a phone number?

1295
01:39:12,358 --> 01:39:15,020
- It was the wrong number then.
- A woman answered.

1296
01:39:15,094 --> 01:39:19,224
It was the wrong number in 1 990.
It should be the right number now.

1297
01:39:19,298 --> 01:39:21,493
Doyou remember it?

1298
01:39:22,835 --> 01:39:24,496
The number.

1299
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:32,101
This is myterritory, bitch!

1300
01:39:33,446 --> 01:39:36,779
- Is this real or one ofmy delusions?
- This is definitely real.

1301
01:39:38,017 --> 01:39:43,819
Excuse me. I thinkwe've got
a little misunderstanding here.

1302
01:39:43,889 --> 01:39:46,881
- Yeah. We--
- Gee, really?

1303
01:39:46,993 --> 01:39:49,985
Now, you just sit tight, chief.

1304
01:39:50,062 --> 01:39:53,190
You listen to me,
little Miss Understanding.

1305
01:39:53,266 --> 01:39:56,599
You thinkyou can go around me and
peddleyour ass in this part oftown?

1306
01:39:56,669 --> 01:39:58,864
You betyour lifewe got
what I would call...

1307
01:39:58,938 --> 01:40:01,099
a majorfuckin' misunderstanding.

1308
01:40:04,510 --> 01:40:06,501
James, no! Don't!

1309
01:40:09,448 --> 01:40:11,507
Put him in the closet.
Take his money first!

1310
01:40:12,485 --> 01:40:16,581
- You want me to rob him?
- We need cash!

1311
01:40:16,656 --> 01:40:20,057
Call the cops!
Call the cops!

1312
01:40:20,126 --> 01:40:22,890
What's goin' on?

1313
01:40:22,962 --> 01:40:25,362
I've got friends, man.

1314
01:40:25,431 --> 01:40:27,831
Don't fuckin' kill me.

1315
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:30,334
No,James!

1316
01:40:32,338 --> 01:40:34,101
Open the door!

1317
01:40:34,173 --> 01:40:36,903
What the fuck are you doing?

1318
01:40:36,976 --> 01:40:40,070
Please don't hurt him.
Open the door.

1319
01:40:40,146 --> 01:40:42,137
James, come on.

1320
01:40:49,822 --> 01:40:51,756
Just in case--

1321
01:40:51,824 --> 01:40:55,817
Just in case I'm not crazy,
this is how they find us.

1322
01:40:55,895 --> 01:40:58,830
By our teeth.

1323
01:40:58,898 --> 01:41:01,560
I don't want them to find me ever.

1324
01:41:03,469 --> 01:41:05,061
I don't want to go back.

1325
01:41:12,645 --> 01:41:15,910
Step back.
You'd better load.

1326
01:41:17,783 --> 01:41:21,150
Police! Throw yourweapons out
and come on out!

1327
01:41:27,126 --> 01:41:30,425
Hey! Is that the cops?

1328
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,293
I'm the innocent victim here.

1329
01:41:32,365 --> 01:41:35,095
I was attacked
by a coked-up whore...

1330
01:41:35,167 --> 01:41:37,260
and a fuckin' crazy dentist.

1331
01:41:51,417 --> 01:41:53,351
Try to blend in.

1332
01:41:53,419 --> 01:41:56,786
Oh,Jesus!
Come on.

1333
01:41:58,290 --> 01:42:01,487
There's gotta be a phone
around here somewhere.

1334
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:03,926
Over there. Look.

1335
01:42:03,996 --> 01:42:06,123
I'm gonna try that number, okay?

1336
01:42:06,198 --> 01:42:08,189
Let's hope it's nothing.

1337
01:42:37,096 --> 01:42:39,462
It's okay! We're insane.

1338
01:42:39,532 --> 01:42:41,727
We're crazy.
It's a carpet cleaning company.

1339
01:42:41,801 --> 01:42:44,292
- A carpet cleaning company?
- Yeah. No superiors.

1340
01:42:44,370 --> 01:42:47,498
No scientists.
No men from the future.

1341
01:42:47,573 --> 01:42:50,474
It's just a carpet cleaning company.
They have voice mail.

1342
01:42:50,576 --> 01:42:53,602
You leave a message telling
whereyou wantyour carpet cleaned.

1343
01:42:53,712 --> 01:42:56,180
- You left them a message?
- Yeah, I couldn't resist.

1344
01:42:56,248 --> 01:42:58,341
Wait till they hearthis nuttywoman
telling them towatch out...

1345
01:42:58,451 --> 01:43:01,716
forthe Army oftheTwelve Monkeys.

1346
01:43:01,787 --> 01:43:05,553
I said, "The Freedom for Animals
Association on Second Avenue--"

1347
01:43:05,624 --> 01:43:09,492
"Is the secret headquarters of
the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys.

1348
01:43:09,562 --> 01:43:12,156
They're the ones
who are gonna do it.

1349
01:43:12,231 --> 01:43:15,132
I can't do anything more now.
I have to go.

1350
01:43:15,201 --> 01:43:17,635
Have a merry Christmas."

1351
01:43:22,208 --> 01:43:24,199
You couldn't have heard me.

1352
01:43:29,281 --> 01:43:31,249
They gotyour message.

1353
01:43:32,918 --> 01:43:35,716
They played it for me.

1354
01:43:35,788 --> 01:43:39,019
It was a bad recording, distorted.

1355
01:43:40,926 --> 01:43:42,917
I didn't recognizeyourvoice.

1356
01:44:01,347 --> 01:44:04,180
This.

1357
01:44:04,283 --> 01:44:06,046
And this.

1358
01:44:08,921 --> 01:44:11,583
And this.

1359
01:44:11,657 --> 01:44:13,648
Is everything okay?
You want anything?

1360
01:44:18,497 --> 01:44:20,522
Shall I put this
on your account, ma'am?

1361
01:44:20,599 --> 01:44:22,829
No. That'll be cash.

1362
01:44:27,339 --> 01:44:29,330
Can you tell mewhat floor
the wigs are on?

1363
01:44:40,219 --> 01:44:42,881
You turned the thing
into a fucking computer.

1364
01:44:42,955 --> 01:44:45,549
- And Fale believed it.
- You know Fale.

1365
01:44:45,624 --> 01:44:50,061
He's like, "if you guys get nailed,
which I'm pretty sureyou will...

1366
01:44:50,129 --> 01:44:53,064
I've never seen you before
in my fuckin' life."

1367
01:44:57,136 --> 01:44:59,400
Come on, come on.

1368
01:44:59,471 --> 01:45:01,268
Bring him through.

1369
01:45:04,343 --> 01:45:05,503
Drive!

1370
01:45:10,549 --> 01:45:13,780
What's the harm in openin' up the bag?
His eyes are taped, right?

1371
01:45:15,321 --> 01:45:16,811
Right?

1372
01:45:24,029 --> 01:45:25,963
Hello. Hello.

1373
01:45:27,566 --> 01:45:29,557
Wanna hearthe monkey speak?

1374
01:45:32,204 --> 01:45:34,434
Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, I know that's you.

1375
01:45:34,506 --> 01:45:36,804
- I recognizeyourvoice.
- No, you don't.

1376
01:45:36,875 --> 01:45:40,276
I also know all about
yourwarped little plan.

1377
01:45:40,346 --> 01:45:42,473
That lady, your psychiatrist?

1378
01:45:42,581 --> 01:45:45,049
She told me.
I didn't believe her.

1379
01:45:45,117 --> 01:45:48,450
It just seemed too crazy,
even for you.

1380
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,988
But just in case, I took steps...

1381
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:53,456
to make sure that
you couldn't go through with it.

1382
01:45:53,525 --> 01:45:56,722
I don't have the code any more.

1383
01:45:56,795 --> 01:45:58,956
I don't have access
to the virus.

1384
01:45:59,031 --> 01:46:02,194
I took myself out ofthe loop.

1385
01:46:02,301 --> 01:46:05,134
Too late! Too late!

1386
01:46:05,204 --> 01:46:07,229
We've got plans for you, Dad.

1387
01:46:16,281 --> 01:46:19,717
I never let myselfbelieve it.
Now I know it's true.

1388
01:46:19,785 --> 01:46:21,776
Jeffrey?

1389
01:46:21,887 --> 01:46:24,378
You're completely insane.

1390
01:46:28,961 --> 01:46:30,394
No, I'm not.

1391
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:38,727
There's a cross section ofone of
the old trees that's been cut down,

1392
01:46:47,546 --> 01:46:49,537
Here I was born,

1393
01:46:51,116 --> 01:46:53,710
And there I died,

1394
01:46:53,819 --> 01:46:56,310
It was only a moment for you,

1395
01:46:56,422 --> 01:46:58,322
You took no notice,

1396
01:47:03,128 --> 01:47:05,858
I think I 've seen this movie before.

1397
01:47:05,931 --> 01:47:09,731
- When I was a kid, I saw it on TV.
- Don't talk.

1398
01:47:09,802 --> 01:47:12,828
- I did see it before.
- Tall trees,

1399
01:47:12,905 --> 01:47:14,702
have you been here before?

1400
01:47:14,773 --> 01:47:16,434
- Yes,
- When?

1401
01:47:18,043 --> 01:47:21,376
- But I don't recognize this--
- When wereyou born?

1402
01:47:21,447 --> 01:47:23,244
- Long ago,
- Where?

1403
01:47:23,348 --> 01:47:25,248
What's the matter?

1404
01:47:25,317 --> 01:47:27,581
Tell me,
Madeleine, tell me,

1405
01:47:27,653 --> 01:47:30,781
It's just like
what's happening with us.

1406
01:47:30,856 --> 01:47:32,653
Like the past.

1407
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:36,593
The movie never changes.
It can't change.

1408
01:47:36,662 --> 01:47:41,258
But every timeyou see it, it seems
different because you're different.

1409
01:47:41,333 --> 01:47:43,893
You see different things.

1410
01:47:44,002 --> 01:47:45,697
Please don't ask me,

1411
01:47:45,771 --> 01:47:48,740
if you can't change anything
because it's already happened...

1412
01:47:48,807 --> 01:47:50,798
you may as well
smell the flowers.

1413
01:47:50,876 --> 01:47:52,537
What flowers?

1414
01:47:54,279 --> 01:47:56,144
It's an expression.

1415
01:48:10,129 --> 01:48:12,859
Why are you doing this?

1416
01:48:13,932 --> 01:48:15,524
I want to know why.

1417
01:48:15,601 --> 01:48:18,468
What ifI'm wrong?
What if you're wrong?

1418
01:48:18,537 --> 01:48:20,630
What ifl am crazy?

1419
01:48:20,706 --> 01:48:24,472
In a few weeks,
it will have started or it won't.

1420
01:48:24,543 --> 01:48:26,170
Ifthere's still...

1421
01:48:28,147 --> 01:48:30,741
football games, traffic jams...

1422
01:48:30,849 --> 01:48:32,908
TV shows
and armed robberies...

1423
01:48:33,018 --> 01:48:34,918
we're going to be so glad...

1424
01:48:34,987 --> 01:48:37,046
that we'll be thrilled
to see the police.

1425
01:48:37,156 --> 01:48:39,021
I'm responsible for you now.

1426
01:48:39,091 --> 01:48:42,185
The Chinese say
onceyou've saveda person's life...

1427
01:48:42,261 --> 01:48:44,286
you're responsible for it forever,
so I'm committed,

1428
01:48:44,363 --> 01:48:45,921
Do you have a plan?

1429
01:48:45,998 --> 01:48:48,023
I have to know.

1430
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:50,091
There's so little that I know.

1431
01:48:52,371 --> 01:48:55,033
You said
you'd never seen the ocean.

1432
01:48:56,675 --> 01:48:58,768
Hurry up. Come on.

1433
01:49:09,154 --> 01:49:10,849
Jeffrey?

1434
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:13,990
You know I can't see.
Where are we?

1435
01:49:14,059 --> 01:49:17,085
Jeffrey? Please.

1436
01:49:44,623 --> 01:49:46,614
We have 9:30 reservations
for KeyWest.

1437
01:49:59,671 --> 01:50:03,004
I just didn't recognizeyou.

1438
01:50:04,243 --> 01:50:06,575
Well, you look
pretty differentyourself.

1439
01:50:11,450 --> 01:50:13,418
It was always you.

1440
01:50:13,518 --> 01:50:15,577
In my dream.

1441
01:50:19,458 --> 01:50:21,449
It was always you.

1442
01:50:25,163 --> 01:50:27,097
I rememberyou like this.

1443
01:50:27,165 --> 01:50:28,962
You do?

1444
01:50:29,034 --> 01:50:31,468
I felt I've known you before.

1445
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:37,035
I feel like I've always known you.

1446
01:50:48,887 --> 01:50:50,855
I'm so scared.

1447
01:51:24,523 --> 01:51:26,514
What time's your flight, friends?

1448
01:51:26,591 --> 01:51:28,991
- 9:30.
- Might be tight.

1449
01:51:29,061 --> 01:51:32,690
Tight? No.
Mywatch says 7:30.

1450
01:51:32,764 --> 01:51:36,222
On your normal mornin', okay.
Plenty oftime.

1451
01:51:36,301 --> 01:51:40,328
But todayyou gotta take into account
your Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys factor.

1452
01:51:40,405 --> 01:51:42,999
What? What'd you say?

1453
01:51:43,075 --> 01:51:44,736
Twelve Monkeys.

1454
01:51:44,810 --> 01:51:47,836
In case you folks didn't turn on
your radio this mornin'.

1455
01:51:47,913 --> 01:51:51,371
Bunch ofweirdos let
all the animals out ofthe zoo.

1456
01:51:51,483 --> 01:51:54,418
Then they locked up this
big-shot scientist in one ofthe cages.

1457
01:51:54,486 --> 01:51:56,977
Scientist's own kid
one ofthe ones did it.

1458
01:51:57,089 --> 01:52:00,684
They've got animals
all over the place.

1459
01:52:00,759 --> 01:52:03,557
Bunch ofzebras closed down
the thruway about an hour ago.

1460
01:52:03,628 --> 01:52:05,960
And they got some thing
called an emu.

1461
01:52:06,031 --> 01:52:10,161
It's got traffic blocked
for miles on 676.

1462
01:52:10,268 --> 01:52:12,702
What do theythink they're accomplishing
byreleasing an animal like this...

1463
01:52:12,771 --> 01:52:15,740
into a city like this one?

1464
01:52:15,807 --> 01:52:18,207
That's what they were up to--
freeing animals.

1465
01:52:18,276 --> 01:52:22,770
On the walls. It said, "We did it."
They meant the animals.

1466
01:52:31,857 --> 01:52:34,621
I think it's gonna be all right.

1467
01:52:38,030 --> 01:52:41,727
Tell your people ifthey spot either one
ofthem not to try and apprehend them.

1468
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,428
They should notify us.
We have people all over the airport.

1469
01:52:44,503 --> 01:52:45,629
We'll take care ofit.

1470
01:53:12,431 --> 01:53:15,093
- I know this place.
- Airports all look the same.

1471
01:53:16,301 --> 01:53:18,132
This is my dream.

1472
01:53:23,008 --> 01:53:25,442
- Your mustache.
- It's not just my dream.

1473
01:53:27,045 --> 01:53:29,707
I was actually here.
I remember now.

1474
01:53:31,383 --> 01:53:35,683
About a week or two
before everyone started dying.

1475
01:53:37,422 --> 01:53:40,789
Careful.
They might be looking for us.

1476
01:53:40,859 --> 01:53:44,295
- I was here as a kid.
- Use this.

1477
01:53:44,362 --> 01:53:47,923
I thinkyou were here then too.

1478
01:53:49,334 --> 01:53:51,666
Ifthey identify us,
they're going to send us someplace...

1479
01:53:51,736 --> 01:53:53,727
but it won't be KeyWest.

1480
01:53:58,210 --> 01:53:59,871
I'll go fix this.

1481
01:53:59,945 --> 01:54:03,346
I'm gonna get the tickets.
I'll meetyou in the newspaper stand.

1482
01:54:15,427 --> 01:54:18,487
Judy Simmons.
I have reservations for KeyWest.

1483
01:54:29,441 --> 01:54:33,036
- I don't see a lot ofthis. It's cash.
- It's a long story.

1484
01:54:33,111 --> 01:54:35,443
We'll begin boarding
in about 20 minutes.

1485
01:54:35,547 --> 01:54:37,777
- You have a nice flight, Miss Simmons.
- Thank you.

1486
01:54:42,621 --> 01:54:44,748
Hello. How are you today?

1487
01:54:47,259 --> 01:54:49,523
I don't knowwhether
you're there or not.

1488
01:54:49,594 --> 01:54:51,687
Maybeyou just clean carpets.

1489
01:54:51,763 --> 01:54:54,857
if you do, you're lucky.
You're gonna live a long, happy life.

1490
01:54:54,933 --> 01:54:57,401
But if you other guys are out there,
if you're picking this up...

1491
01:54:57,469 --> 01:54:59,528
forget about
the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys.

1492
01:54:59,604 --> 01:55:02,664
They didn't do it. It was a mistake.
Someone else did it.

1493
01:55:02,741 --> 01:55:05,039
The Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys
is just a bunch of dumb kids...

1494
01:55:05,110 --> 01:55:07,203
playing revolutionaries.

1495
01:55:10,315 --> 01:55:14,752
Listen, I've done myjob.
I did whatyou wanted.

1496
01:55:14,819 --> 01:55:17,287
Good luck.
I'm not coming back.

1497
01:55:18,790 --> 01:55:20,883
San Francisco, New Orleans...

1498
01:55:20,959 --> 01:55:23,894
Rio deJaneiro, Rome...

1499
01:55:23,962 --> 01:55:27,329
Kinshasa, Karachi,
Bangkok and Peking.

1500
01:55:27,399 --> 01:55:30,562
This is some tripyou're taking, sir.
Is this all in one week?

1501
01:55:30,635 --> 01:55:32,796
Business.

1502
01:55:33,838 --> 01:55:36,306
Have a good one, sir.

1503
01:55:50,388 --> 01:55:53,152
Gotyourselfa prob, Bob?

1504
01:55:55,193 --> 01:55:56,785
Leave me alone!

1505
01:55:56,861 --> 01:55:59,056
I made a report.
I didn't have to do that.

1506
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:00,825
Point offact:

1507
01:56:00,899 --> 01:56:03,265
You don't belong here.

1508
01:56:03,335 --> 01:56:06,429
It's not permitted to letyou stay.

1509
01:56:06,504 --> 01:56:08,734
This is the present.

1510
01:56:08,807 --> 01:56:12,072
This is not the past.
This is not the future.

1511
01:56:12,143 --> 01:56:13,667
This is right now!

1512
01:56:13,745 --> 01:56:16,407
I'm not leaving! Get that?

1513
01:56:16,514 --> 01:56:19,381
You can't stop me.

1514
01:56:19,451 --> 01:56:21,942
Anything you say, chief.
It's none of my business.

1515
01:56:32,664 --> 01:56:34,928
- Hey, Cole.
- Leave me alone!

1516
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,991
Calm down, Cole. It's me.

1517
01:56:37,068 --> 01:56:39,059
Cole, it's me.

1518
01:56:40,739 --> 01:56:45,005
- Jose?
- Yeah, right,Jose.

1519
01:56:45,076 --> 01:56:48,637
Why'd you pull out the tooth?
That was nuts.

1520
01:56:48,747 --> 01:56:51,773
- Here, take this.
- What for? are you crazy?

1521
01:56:51,883 --> 01:56:53,350
Me? are you kidding?

1522
01:56:53,451 --> 01:56:57,182
You're the one.
You're a hero, man.

1523
01:56:57,255 --> 01:57:00,122
They pardoned you, and you
come back and fuckwith your teeth.

1524
01:57:00,191 --> 01:57:03,388
- How did you find me?
- The phone call, man.

1525
01:57:03,461 --> 01:57:05,986
They did their
reconstruction thing on it.

1526
01:57:06,064 --> 01:57:10,160
The phone--
The phone call I just made?

1527
01:57:10,235 --> 01:57:12,635
- Five minutes ago.
- Yeah, five minutes ago.

1528
01:57:12,704 --> 01:57:15,571
Thirtyyears ago.
Theyjust put it together.

1529
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:17,631
" Uh, hey, this is Cole,James.

1530
01:57:17,709 --> 01:57:20,234
I don't know whetheryou're there
or not. Maybeyou just clean carpets."

1531
01:57:20,312 --> 01:57:22,177
Where'd you get that from?

1532
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:25,807
" Forget about the Army
ofthe Twelve Monkeys."

1533
01:57:25,917 --> 01:57:28,784
Man, if only they could've
got your message earlier.

1534
01:57:28,853 --> 01:57:31,219
Take it. You could still be
a hero if you cooperate!

1535
01:57:32,857 --> 01:57:34,848
Come on,James.
It's okay.

1536
01:57:47,605 --> 01:57:50,369
- $6.50's your change. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1537
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:05,613
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is readyforboarding at gate 38,

1538
01:58:09,994 --> 01:58:12,326
Oh, my God!

1539
01:58:12,397 --> 01:58:16,390
I got orders to shoot the lady
if you don't go along this time.

1540
01:58:16,468 --> 01:58:18,197
- What?
- Yeah, you got that?

1541
01:58:18,269 --> 01:58:20,897
- They said, "IfCole don't obey--"
- I'll breakyour fuckin' head!

1542
01:58:20,972 --> 01:58:22,769
You hear me?

1543
01:58:24,075 --> 01:58:27,306
Volunteers nowboarding
at gate 37,

1544
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:31,346
You see?
I had no choice.

1545
01:58:31,416 --> 01:58:34,715
These are my orders, man.
Just take it.

1546
01:58:34,786 --> 01:58:36,014
Take it!

1547
01:58:40,158 --> 01:58:43,286
This part isn't about
the virus at all, is it?

1548
01:58:43,361 --> 01:58:47,354
It's about following orders,
about doing whatyou're told.

1549
01:58:47,432 --> 01:58:50,560
Hey, man, you got a pardon.
What doyou want?

1550
01:58:50,635 --> 01:58:53,798
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Who am I supposed to shoot?

1551
01:58:53,872 --> 01:58:56,272
James! It's Dr. Goines' assistant.

1552
01:58:56,341 --> 01:58:59,572
He's an apocalypse nut.
I think he's involved.

1553
01:58:59,644 --> 01:59:02,306
The next flight to San Francisco
leaves from gate 38.

1554
01:59:02,414 --> 01:59:03,676
Ifhe's there,
I'm sure he's part ofit.

1555
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:17,321
Mr. Holtz, you wanna have
a look at this, please?

1556
01:59:19,364 --> 01:59:23,767
Sir, would you mind letting me have
a look at the contents of your bag?

1557
01:59:23,835 --> 01:59:25,928
We don't have time for this.

1558
01:59:26,004 --> 01:59:28,495
Excuse me.

1559
01:59:32,844 --> 01:59:35,506
Biological samples.

1560
01:59:35,647 --> 01:59:37,672
I have the papers right here.

1561
01:59:38,750 --> 01:59:42,379
I'm gonna have to askyou
to open this up, sir.

1562
01:59:42,487 --> 01:59:44,614
Open it?

1563
01:59:44,689 --> 01:59:46,919
Why, yes, of course.

1564
01:59:47,992 --> 01:59:51,621
What could be better?
Look at the planes. Hurry up.

1565
01:59:51,696 --> 01:59:54,961
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am, you have to get in the line.

1566
01:59:55,033 --> 01:59:56,796
You see?

1567
01:59:56,868 --> 01:59:59,666
Biological.
Check the papers.

1568
01:59:59,737 --> 02:00:02,706
It's all proper.
I have a permit.

1569
02:00:07,946 --> 02:00:11,279
- It's empty.
- Well, yes, to be sure.

1570
02:00:11,382 --> 02:00:16,319
It looks empty,
but I assureyou, it's not.

1571
02:00:16,421 --> 02:00:18,389
- You don't understand.
- I don't have to.

1572
02:00:18,490 --> 02:00:22,654
This is very important.
There's a man carrying a deadlyvirus.

1573
02:00:22,727 --> 02:00:27,630
There, you see?
Also invisible to the naked eye.

1574
02:00:29,934 --> 02:00:34,394
It doesn't even have an odor.

1575
02:00:34,472 --> 02:00:37,873
That's not necessary, sir.
Thereyou go.

1576
02:00:37,942 --> 02:00:41,173
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a good flight.

1577
02:00:49,554 --> 02:00:52,751
- Who are you calling a moron?
- I am calling you a fucking moron!

1578
02:00:52,824 --> 02:00:55,292
- A fucking moron?
- Getyour hands offher!

1579
02:00:58,429 --> 02:01:00,420
Hold it!
Wait a moment.

1580
02:01:16,481 --> 02:01:19,211
There he is! That man!
He's carrying a deadlyvirus!

1581
02:01:19,317 --> 02:01:22,184
Stop him!
Somebody, please stop him!

1582
02:01:22,954 --> 02:01:25,514
Police officer.

1583
02:01:30,862 --> 02:01:32,853
He's got a gun!

1584
02:01:41,072 --> 02:01:42,835
Watch it!

1585
02:01:53,451 --> 02:01:55,419
Freeze!

1586
02:04:12,824 --> 02:04:14,587
Excuse me.

1587
02:04:14,659 --> 02:04:16,593
It's obscene.

1588
02:04:16,661 --> 02:04:19,095
All the violence,
all the lunacy.

1589
02:04:19,831 --> 02:04:23,028
Shootings even at airports now.

1590
02:04:23,101 --> 02:04:26,867
You might say that we're
the next endangered species.

1591
02:04:26,938 --> 02:04:28,906
Human beings.

1592
02:04:31,642 --> 02:04:34,042
I thinkyou're right, ma'am.

1593
02:04:35,379 --> 02:04:38,348
I thinkyou've hit the nail
on the head.

1594
02:04:40,585 --> 02:04:42,553
Jones is my name.

1595
02:04:47,658 --> 02:04:50,218
I'm in insurance.

1596
02:05:30,542 --> 02:05:35,542
Thank you
