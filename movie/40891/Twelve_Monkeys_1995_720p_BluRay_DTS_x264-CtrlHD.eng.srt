1
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:28,862
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is now ready for boarding.

2
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:09,169
Passengers for flight 841
to Rome, come to gate seven.

3
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:24,650
Flight 784 to San Francisco
is now ready for boarding at...

4
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:30,188
Inmate number 87645: Cole, James.

5
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:34,395
27631: Johnson.

6
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,303
84743: Innis.

7
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:45,071
Jose. Psst.

8
00:02:45,147 --> 00:02:48,514
- Jose, what's going on?
- Bad news, man.

9
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:52,452
- Volunteers?
- Yeah. And they said your name.

10
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:04,355
Hey, maybe they'll give you
a pardon, man.

11
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:08,369
Yeah. That's why none of the volunteers
come back. They all get a pardon.

12
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:11,270
- Some come back, I heard.
- Yeah.

13
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,367
Please put me back!
Don't take me!

14
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:20,711
Yeah, they got 'em up on the
seventh floor. They hide 'em up there.

15
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,843
They're all messed up in the head.
Brains don't work.

16
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,683
You don't know they're all messed up.
Nobody's seen 'em.

17
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:29,189
And maybe they're not messed up.
That's a rumor. Nobody knows that.

18
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:32,091
I don't believe that.

19
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:34,823
Good luck, man.

20
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:39,163
- Volunteer duty!
- I didn't volunteer.

21
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:41,896
You causing trouble again?

22
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,201
No, no trouble.

23
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:52,177
These are the instructions
for the first time probe.

24
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:56,206
Listen carefully.
They must be followed exactly.

25
00:03:56,285 --> 00:04:00,915
All openings of your garment
must be sealed completely.

26
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,449
If the integrity of the suit
is compromised in any way,

27
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:09,827
if the fabric is torn
or a zipper not closed,

28
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:12,093
readmittance will be denied.

29
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,907
If there are any
indications of contamination by germs,

30
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:52,003
the subject will be denied
reentry to secure population.

31
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,982
Please place
blood sample in receptacle provided.

32
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:59,782
There will be a socialization
class in room 700...

33
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:04,485
for citizens cited
for deviations 23-A and 96-A...

34
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,960
per subchapter six
of the Permanent Emergency Code.

35
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,761
James Cole cleared from quarantine.

36
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:16,468
Thank you. You two wait outside.

37
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:19,336
He's got a history, Doctor.
Violence.

38
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,706
Antisocial six.

39
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:25,338
Repeated violations of
the Permanent Emergency Code.

40
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:29,043
Insolence. Defiance.
Disregard of authority.

41
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:31,244
Doing 25 to life.

42
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,583
I don't think he's gonna hurt us.

43
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:36,818
You aren't gonna hurt us,
are you, Mr. Cole?

44
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:39,894
No, sir.

45
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:55,004
Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole?

46
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:22,467
We appreciate your volunteering.
You're a very good observer.

47
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:25,802
- Thank you.
- We have a very advanced program.

48
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:30,038
- Something very different.
- Opportunity to reduce your sentence.

49
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:32,307
And possibly play an important role...

50
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,974
in returning the human race
to the surface of the Earth.

51
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,918
We want tough-minded people.
Strong mentally.

52
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,120
We've had some misfortunes
with... unstable types.

53
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:50,392
For a man
in your position, an opportunity.

54
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:53,400
Not to volunteer
could be a real mistake.

55
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:56,198
Definitely a mistake.

56
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:02,635
"Yet among the myriad microwaves,

57
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:07,307
the infrared messages,
the gigabytes of ones and zeros,

58
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:10,249
we find words, byte-sized now,

59
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:12,684
tinier even than science,

60
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:15,587
lurking in some
vague electricity.

61
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:17,852
But if we but listen,

62
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:21,293
we hear the solitary voice
of that poet telling us...

63
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:27,327
yesterday this day's madness
did prepare...

64
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:32,430
tomorrow's silent triumph of despair.

65
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:36,136
Drink, for you know not
whence you came, nor why.

66
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:39,510
Drink, for you know not
why you go, nor where."

67
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:51,752
...wandering around
in nothing but his underpants...

68
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:55,262
and one of those plastic,
see-through lady's raincoats.

69
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,164
So, they get there, they ask the guy
real nice for some kind of I.D.

70
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:02,328
He gets agitated,
starts screaming about viruses.

71
00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:04,634
Totally irrational,
totally disoriented.

72
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:08,608
- Doesn't know where he is, what day of the week it is.
- Lemme see.

73
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:10,838
- All they got was his name.
- Thanks.

74
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:15,440
Of course, they figured he's stoned out of
his mind. Some kind of psychotic episode.

75
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:18,782
- He's been tested for drugs?
- Negative for drugs.

76
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:22,687
But he took on five cops
like he was dusted to the eyeballs.

77
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:26,386
- No drugs. You believe that?
- He's in restraints.

78
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:31,763
Yeah. Weren't you listenin'? I've got
two police officers in the hospital!

79
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:36,236
The medic gave him enough stellazine to
kill a horse. Look at him. Rarin' to go.

80
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:40,240
That would explain the bruises,
I guess. The struggle.

81
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:43,766
Yeah. You wanna go in there,
examine him, what?

82
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:46,109
Yes, please.

83
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:49,912
Is this all you have?
Ran it through your system?

84
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:55,218
No matchup. No license, no prints,
no warrants. Nothing.

85
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,953
- I should probably go in with you.
- No, thank you.

86
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:01,222
- That won't be necessary.
- All right.

87
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:04,925
He'll be right here...
just in case.

88
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:19,671
Mr. Cole, my name is Kathryn Railly.
I'm a psychiatrist.

89
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:22,376
I work for the county.
I don't work for the police.

90
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,044
So my concern is for your well-being.
Do you understand that?

91
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,214
Need to go! Need to go!

92
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,885
I can't make the police let you go.

93
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,123
But I do wanna help you, so I...

94
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:38,131
I need you to tell me exactly
what happened tonight.

95
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:41,726
Do you think
you can do that, James?

96
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:44,294
May I call you James?

97
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:50,400
James.
Nobody ever calls me that.

98
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:54,642
- Have you been a patient at County?
- No.

99
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:58,777
- Have I seen you someplace?
- Not possible.

100
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:03,017
I need to go! I need to... I'm
supposed to be gathering information.

101
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:06,424
- What kind of information?
- Won't help you.

102
00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:09,622
Won't help anyone.
Won't change anything.

103
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:15,168
James, do you know
why you're here?

104
00:14:15,236 --> 00:14:19,866
- 'Cause I'm a good observer. Got a tough mind.
- I see.

105
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:23,707
You don't remember assaulting
a police officer?

106
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:27,908
Why am I chained?
Why are these chains on me?

107
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:30,348
You've been in an institution before,
haven't you?

108
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:33,615
- Or hospital?
- No! Now I need to go. Need to go!

109
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:36,555
- Have you been in prison, James?
- Underground.

110
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:40,253
Hiding?

111
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,523
I love this air.

112
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:46,624
Oh, it's such wonderful air.

113
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:51,570
- What's wonderful about the air, James?
- Very fresh. No germs.

114
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:58,977
Why do you think there aren't
any germs in the air?

115
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:01,675
- This is October, right?
- April.

116
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,686
- What year is this?
- What year do you think it is?

117
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:07,585
1996.

118
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:11,682
That's the future, James. Do you
think you're living in the future?

119
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,660
1996 is the past.

120
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:17,789
No, 1996 is the future.

121
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:20,096
This is 1990.

122
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:28,440
- Shut up, ladies.
- Where're you taking me?

123
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,001
South of France, buddy.
Fancy hotel. You'll love it.

124
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,741
I can't go. I just need
to make a telephone call.

125
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:38,275
Yeah, yeah. Zip it, daisy. You fooled
the shrink, but you don't fool us.

126
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:45,126
Let's go, ace.

127
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:15,816
All right.
Come on, come on.

128
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:21,355
There you go.
Now, lemme see your head, Jimbo.

129
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:25,092
- See if you got any creepy crawlers.
- I need to make a telephone call.

130
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,134
Got to take you over
to the doctor, Jimbo.

131
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:30,467
- Can't make no calls 'til the doctor says.
- It's very important!

132
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:36,272
What you gotta do, Jimbo,
is take it easy. Relax into things.

133
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:39,472
And we'll all get along fine
if you just relax.

134
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:42,015
Wow! Whoo-oo!

135
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:50,421
Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

136
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,326
Hey, Goines!

137
00:16:57,398 --> 00:16:59,127
Yo, Goines!

138
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,399
Yo, Jeffrey!
Goines!

139
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:07,032
- What?
- Look here.

140
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:11,272
This here's James. Now, do me a favor.
Why don't you show him around?

141
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:13,871
Tell him the TV rules.
Show him the games and stuff. Okay?

142
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:16,849
How much you gonna pay me?
How much? I'd be doin' your job.

143
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:19,819
- Five thousand dollars, my man. That enough?
- Five thousand?

144
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:21,549
I'll wire a check
to your account as usual.

145
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,990
- Five thousand dollars! Five thousand dollars!
- Five thousand dollars.

146
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,392
- I'll give him the deluxe mental hospital tour.
- My man!

147
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:31,125
- Kid around, makes 'em feel good. We're pals.
- I love you.

148
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:35,795
- You're the prisoners. No, you're the guards.
- Now you got it.

149
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,533
Okay, it's all in good fun.
Here's some games here.

150
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:43,134
And there's...
Get out! Get out!

151
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:47,204
He was in my chair.

152
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:51,013
Games. Games.
Here's some games.

153
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:53,417
Games that wanna get out.

154
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:56,184
See? More games.

155
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:59,852
Games. They vegetize you.
See? Aah.

156
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:03,455
If you play the games, you're
voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.

157
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:07,126
I guess they gave you
some chemical restraints. Drugs!

158
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:10,534
What'd they give you? Thorazine?
Haldol? How much? How much?

159
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:12,766
Learn your drugs.
Know your dosages. It's elementary.

160
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,469
- I need to make a telephone call.
- A telephone call?

161
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:20,878
That's communication with the outside
world. Doctor's discretion. No.

162
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:23,543
If all of these nuts
could just make phone calls,

163
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:26,451
it could spread insanity
oozing through telephone cables,

164
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:30,321
oozing to the ears of all these poor,
sane people, infecting them.

165
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:33,189
Wackos everywhere.
A plague of madness.

166
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:37,994
In fact, very few, Jim... Jim, very few
of us here are actually mentally ill.

167
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:40,364
I'm not saying
you're not mentally ill.

168
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:44,166
For all I know, you're... crazy as a
loon. But that's not why you're here.

169
00:18:44,238 --> 00:18:48,004
That's not why you're here!
That's not why you're here!

170
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,102
You're here
because of the system.

171
00:18:52,113 --> 00:18:54,081
There's the television.

172
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:56,275
It's all right there.
All right there.

173
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:58,319
Look, listen, kneel, pray.

174
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:01,412
The commercials!

175
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:04,583
We're not productive anymore. Don't
make things anymore. It's all automated.

176
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:07,787
What are we for then?
We're consumers, Jim.

177
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:10,763
Okay, okay. Buy a lot of stuff,
you're a good citizen.

178
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:13,824
But if you don't buy a lot of stuff,
what are you then?

179
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:16,529
What?
You're mentally ill.

180
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:20,836
Fact, Jim. Fact! If you don't
buy things: toilet paper, new cars,

181
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:24,969
electrically-operated sexual devices, stereo
systems with brain-implanted headphones,

182
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:28,948
screwdrivers with miniature built-in
radar devices, voice-activated computers...

183
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:30,985
Take it easy, Jeffrey.

184
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:33,452
Be calm!

185
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:35,785
Right.

186
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:38,826
That's right.
You're a very attractive woman.

187
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:40,554
Hah!

188
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:44,928
If you want to watch a particular
television program, like All My Children,

189
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:48,799
you can go to the charge nurse and tell her
the day, the time the show you wanna see is on.

190
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,134
But you have to tell her
before the show is scheduled to be on.

191
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:54,663
There was this guy, and he was always
requesting shows that had already played.

192
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:57,870
Yes. No.
You have to tell her before.

193
00:19:57,945 --> 00:20:01,711
He couldn't quite grasp the idea that the
charge nurse couldn't make it be yesterday.

194
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,081
She couldn't turn back time!
Thank you, Einstein.

195
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:07,315
Now he, he was nuts.
He was a fruitcake, Jim.

196
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:11,882
Okay, that's it, Jeffrey.
You're gonna get a shot.

197
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:16,726
- I warned you.
- Right. Right, right, right.

198
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,857
I got a little carried away...

199
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:22,926
explaining the inner workings
of the institution to Jim.

200
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:25,802
Hmm? Hmm?

201
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:29,331
I don't really come
from outer space.

202
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,106
Oh. L.J. Washington.
He doesn't really come from outer space.

203
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,741
Don't mock me, my friend.

204
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,949
Get outta my chair!

205
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:43,149
It's a condition
of mental divergence.

206
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:46,682
I find myself
on the planet Ogo.

207
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:49,525
Part of
an intellectual elite...

208
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:55,126
preparing to subjugate
the barbarian hordes on Pluto.

209
00:20:55,203 --> 00:21:00,266
But even though this is a totally
convincing reality for me in every way,

210
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:05,244
nevertheless, Ogo is actually
a construct of my psyche.

211
00:21:05,313 --> 00:21:08,840
I am mentally divergent...

212
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,977
in that I am escaping
certain unnamed realities...

213
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:15,579
that plague my life here.

214
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:19,854
When I stop going there,
I will be well.

215
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:25,699
Are you also divergent, friend?

216
00:21:31,305 --> 00:21:34,001
This is a place
for crazy people.

217
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:37,374
I'm not crazy.

218
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:40,414
We don't use that term,
"crazy," Mr. Cole.

219
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:44,417
You've got some real nuts here!

220
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:51,353
I know some things
that you don't know.

221
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:54,258
It's gonna be very difficult
for you to understand it.

222
00:21:54,328 --> 00:21:56,592
- Hey!
- Hey, hey.

223
00:21:56,664 --> 00:22:00,293
I'm not gonna hurt anyone!

224
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:02,768
All right.

225
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,499
Look, have any of you heard...

226
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:12,535
of the Army
of the Twelve Monkeys?

227
00:22:12,613 --> 00:22:14,774
They, they paint this.

228
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:17,579
They stencil this on the sides
of buildings everywhere.

229
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:20,485
- Have you seen this?
- Mr. Cole?

230
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:25,356
Why don't you take your time and try
to explain this from the beginning?

231
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:27,826
Right, right.
It's 1990.

232
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:31,763
Okay, that makes sense.
They wouldn't've been active yet.

233
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:35,929
Um...

234
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:48,812
Five billion people died
in 1996 and 1997.

235
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:53,343
Almost the entire population
of the world.

236
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:57,149
Only about one percent
of us survived.

237
00:22:57,225 --> 00:23:01,218
- Are you going to save us?
- How can I save you? This already happened.

238
00:23:01,295 --> 00:23:04,924
I can't save you.
Nobody can.

239
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:09,732
I am simply trying to gather information
to help the people in the present...

240
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:11,669
trace the path of the virus.

241
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:16,506
- We're not in the present now, Mr. Cole?
- No.

242
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:20,513
1990 is the past. This already
happened. That's what I'm trying...

243
00:23:20,581 --> 00:23:23,448
Mr. Cole? Mr. Cole?

244
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:26,645
You believe 1996
is the present then, is that it?

245
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:30,680
No! 1996 is the past too.
Listen to me. What I...

246
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:37,727
What I... What I need to do
is make a telephone call.

247
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:42,167
I can straighten this out
if I make a telephone call.

248
00:23:42,236 --> 00:23:45,296
Who would you call?
Who would straighten everything out?

249
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:49,867
The scientists. They'll want to know
that they sent me to the wrong time.

250
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:55,007
I can leave a voice mail message
that they monitor from the present.

251
00:23:55,082 --> 00:23:59,849
Can I just make
one telephone call, please?

252
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:01,912
Please?

253
00:24:07,261 --> 00:24:09,729
What are you doin' in the dog bowl?
Get outta there!

254
00:24:09,797 --> 00:24:13,426
Who put those Doritos in there anyway?

255
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:16,937
Yes? What?
Voice mail?

256
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:19,370
Look, I don't know...
Stop makin' that noise!

257
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,704
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

258
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:25,906
Is this a joke?
I don't know any scientists.

259
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,971
Duanne, get out...
James who?

260
00:24:30,851 --> 00:24:34,116
Wasn't who you expected?

261
00:24:34,188 --> 00:24:39,455
No. It was some lady.
She didn't know anything.

262
00:24:39,527 --> 00:24:43,759
Well, maybe it was
the wrong number.

263
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:48,598
No. That's why they chose me.
I remember things.

264
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:50,933
James, where did you grow up?

265
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:53,064
Dr. Railly.

266
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,234
- I have the strangest feeling
I've met you before.

267
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:00,542
Wait. This is 1990. I'm supposed to be
leaving messages in 1996!

268
00:25:00,614 --> 00:25:03,310
It's not the right number yet!
That's the problem!

269
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:07,081
We have a message for them.

270
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,320
No!

271
00:25:42,256 --> 00:25:45,248
Won't work.
Can't open it.

272
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:48,056
You think you can remove the grill,
but you can't. It's welded.

273
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:54,123
See? Told you.
All the doors are locked too.

274
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:56,635
They're protecting the people
on the outside from us...

275
00:25:56,704 --> 00:25:59,195
when the people on the outside
are as crazy as us.

276
00:26:19,827 --> 00:26:24,526
Do you know what "crazy" is?
Crazy is majority rules. Yeah.

277
00:26:24,598 --> 00:26:26,566
Take germs for example.

278
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:29,125
- Germs?
- Uh-huh.

279
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:32,969
In the eighteenth century,
no such thing. Nada. Nothing.

280
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,406
No one ever imagined such a thing!
No sane person anyway.

281
00:26:35,476 --> 00:26:39,606
Along comes this doctor.
Uh, uh...

282
00:26:40,614 --> 00:26:42,605
Semmelweis!

283
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:44,617
Semmelweis.

284
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:48,951
Semmelweis comes along and he's trying
to convince people, other doctors mainly,

285
00:26:49,023 --> 00:26:51,992
that there are these teeny, tiny,
invisible bad things called germs...

286
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:54,550
that get into your body
and make you sick.

287
00:26:54,628 --> 00:26:57,256
He's trying to get doctors
to wash their hands.

288
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:59,299
What is this guy?
Crazy?

289
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:03,029
Teeny, tiny, invisible "what do you
call 'em? Germs? Huh? What?"

290
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:05,834
Now, cut to
the twentieth century.

291
00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:11,037
Last week as a matter of fact, right
before I got dragged into this hellhole!

292
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:15,913
I go in to order a burger in this fast-food
joint. The guy drops it on the floor.

293
00:27:15,983 --> 00:27:18,281
Jim, he picks it up,
wipes it off.

294
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:20,479
He hands it to me
like it was all okay.

295
00:27:20,554 --> 00:27:23,785
"What about the germs?" I say.
He says, "I don't believe in germs.

296
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:27,988
Germs are a plot they made up so they
can sell you disinfectants and soaps."

297
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:32,158
Now, he's crazy, right? See?

298
00:27:35,202 --> 00:27:40,003
There's no right. There's no wrong.
There's only popular opinion.

299
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:42,634
You, you, you believe in germs, right?

300
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,577
I'm not crazy.

301
00:27:45,646 --> 00:27:50,811
Of course not! You wanna
escape, right? That's very sane.

302
00:27:52,386 --> 00:27:55,913
I can help you. You want me
to, don't ya? Get you out?

303
00:27:57,725 --> 00:28:00,091
You know how to get outta here?

304
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:03,619
Yes, my son!

305
00:28:03,697 --> 00:28:07,258
- Then why don't ya?
- Why don't I try to escape? That's what you were gonna ask.

306
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:11,100
Good question.
Very good question. Intelligent.

307
00:28:11,172 --> 00:28:15,370
Because I would be crazy to escape.
I have sent out word.

308
00:28:15,442 --> 00:28:18,843
- I am all taken care of.
- What does that mean?

309
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:21,905
I've managed to contact
certain underlings, evil spirits,

310
00:28:21,982 --> 00:28:26,715
secretaries of secretaries, and other
assorted minions who will contact my father.

311
00:28:26,787 --> 00:28:29,756
And when my father finds out
I'm in this kind of place,

312
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:33,623
he'll have them transfer me
to one of those classy joints...

313
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:36,663
where they treat you properly,
like a person, a guest!

314
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,198
With sheets and towels
like a big hotel,

315
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:44,761
with great drugs for all of us
nut-case, lunatic, maniac devils!

316
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,709
Sorry. Uh, sorry.

317
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:52,837
I got a little agitated.
The thought of escape crossed my mind.

318
00:28:52,913 --> 00:28:55,347
And suddenly...

319
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:58,681
Suddenly I felt like bending
the fucking bars back!

320
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:03,746
And ripping out the goddamn window
frames and eating them! Yes, eating them!

321
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:06,122
And leaping, leaping, leaping!

322
00:29:06,193 --> 00:29:09,060
Colonics for everyone!

323
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:11,154
Ahh, all right!

324
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:13,723
You dumb assholes, I'm a mental patient.
I'm supposed to act out.

325
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:16,929
Wait'll you morons find out who I am!
My father's gonna be really upset.

326
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:19,700
And when my father gets upset,
the ground shakes.

327
00:29:19,773 --> 00:29:24,938
My father is God!
I worship my father!

328
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:30,882
These dramatic videotapes,

329
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:35,445
secretly obtained by animal rights
activists, have aroused public indignation.

330
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:39,151
But many scientists
vehemently disagree.

331
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:46,627
Torture experiments.

332
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,431
- We're all monkeys.
- They hurt you?

333
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,207
Not as bad as what
they're doing to the Easter Bunny.

334
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:02,948
Look at them.
They're just askin' for it.

335
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:04,814
Animals inside the lab...

336
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:08,150
Maybe the human race
deserves to be wiped out.

337
00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:12,318
Wiping out the human race?

338
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,521
It's a great idea!
It's great!

339
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:20,124
But more of a long-term thing. First we
have to focus on more immediate goals.

340
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,569
I didn't say a word
about you-know-what.

341
00:30:24,638 --> 00:30:29,234
- What are you talking about?
- Your plan. Emancipation.

342
00:30:32,112 --> 00:30:35,479
What are you writing?
You a reporter?

343
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:38,916
It's private.

344
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:41,045
- A lawsuit? You gonna sue 'em?
- It's private!

345
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:44,716
Yo, Jimbo.
Time for your meds.

346
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:51,023
Take a chance. Live the moment.

347
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:54,499
Sunshine. Gorgeous beaches.

348
00:30:54,568 --> 00:30:57,435
The Florida Keys!

349
00:30:57,504 --> 00:30:59,938
We'll return you
to the Marx Brothers in Monkey Business.

350
00:31:00,007 --> 00:31:04,935
Monkey business!

351
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:06,946
Fetch!

352
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,250
Get it?
Monkey. Monk key.

353
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:16,551
Monk key!

354
00:31:16,623 --> 00:31:19,183
- What?
- Shh.

355
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:21,727
If you see
a bearish future in the decade ahead,

356
00:31:21,795 --> 00:31:25,492
consider the changes sweeping the world
and the opportunities they offer.

357
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:29,127
"And the opportunities
they offer." Ooh!

358
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:31,967
They really dosed you. Jim!

359
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,564
Major load.
Danger, Will Robinson, danger.

360
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:38,077
You gotta get it together.
Focus, focus, focus.

361
00:31:38,145 --> 00:31:41,205
Remember the plan.
I did my part!

362
00:31:41,281 --> 00:31:43,977
- What?
- Shh!

363
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:46,485
Not "what," when.

364
00:31:46,553 --> 00:31:48,544
- When?
- Yes. When.

365
00:31:48,622 --> 00:31:51,284
Now. Now, Jim. Now!

366
00:31:51,358 --> 00:31:53,986
Yes! Now!
Buy! Sell!

367
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:57,326
Stocks! Bonds!
Purchase! Sell!

368
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:00,265
Yes!
No more monkey business!

369
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:02,996
No... more...

370
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,766
monkey business!

371
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,773
Yes, enhance your portfolio now.

372
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:10,708
Five hundred dollars. I got
five hundred dollars. I'm insured!

373
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:14,373
Yeah! Window of opportunity
is opening now.

374
00:32:14,448 --> 00:32:18,248
Now is the time for all good men
to seize the moment. The moment!

375
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:20,752
Now is the time for all good men
to seize the day!

376
00:32:20,821 --> 00:32:23,881
- Aha!
- Goddamn it, Jeffrey! Quit playin' the fool!

377
00:32:23,957 --> 00:32:26,221
MasterCard!
Visa!

378
00:32:26,293 --> 00:32:29,353
The key to happiness!

379
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:33,025
Jim, seize the moment!

380
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,897
Jeffrey, come back here!

381
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:37,300
- For God's sake!
- Jeffrey!

382
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:46,236
Go, Jim!

383
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:49,942
Ohh.

384
00:32:50,017 --> 00:32:54,147
- Get out. Out!
- Come here, Jeffrey!

385
00:33:05,332 --> 00:33:09,462
The future can be yours!
Last chance! Last chance!

386
00:33:09,536 --> 00:33:12,130
Last chance!
Last...

387
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:29,918
Best place to go
would be Florida.

388
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,756
The Keys are lovely
this time of year.

389
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:38,156
...it's the only way to travel.

390
00:33:38,232 --> 00:33:41,690
I was gonna bring along the wife and kiddies,
but the grocer couldn't spare another barrel.

391
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:45,727
I was gonna bring my grandfather,
but there's no room for...

392
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,044
Two's not working today.

393
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:58,846
Use one.

394
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:27,380
Kathryn, this was in my box!

395
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:29,472
But I have a slight suspicion
it wasn't meant for me.

396
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,418
"You are the most bootiful
woman I have ever seen.

397
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:37,150
You live in a bootiful world,
but you don't know it.

398
00:34:37,224 --> 00:34:40,625
You have freedom, sunshine,
air you can breathe..."

399
00:34:40,694 --> 00:34:43,288
James Cole, right?

400
00:34:43,363 --> 00:34:48,357
"I would do anything to stay her
but I must leave. Please help me."

401
00:34:48,435 --> 00:34:51,063
Okay, okay, okay.
Poor man.

402
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:54,198
Hey, Kathryn?
James Cole is one of yours, right?

403
00:34:54,274 --> 00:34:56,936
He eloped.
Last seen, he was up on two.

404
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,602
Shit!

405
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,210
We have to know exactly
what's there so we can fix it.

406
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:09,687
Doctor, we have a visitor.

407
00:35:09,756 --> 00:35:13,351
Um, may I help you? Excuse me?

408
00:35:13,427 --> 00:35:16,260
May I help you?
Excuse me?

409
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,891
Excuse me?

410
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:22,595
Jim? Jim?

411
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:26,366
Hey, Jimbo.
What's up, man?

412
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:31,943
Hey, Jimbo.

413
00:35:32,012 --> 00:35:36,312
All right, it's okay.
Take it easy.

414
00:35:36,383 --> 00:35:38,977
- It'll be all right.
- Take care. Take it easy.

415
00:35:39,052 --> 00:35:42,488
Take it easy.
We'll work this out, okay?

416
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:46,856
Send you back to your room. A little
milk and cookies, you'll be all right.

417
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:49,725
Just take it easy, okay?

418
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:54,233
Come on. Calm down!

419
00:35:59,673 --> 00:36:03,268
Take him down!
Take him the fuck down!

420
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:11,974
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
Dr. Railly, help me please.

421
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:15,510
- We're gonna give you something to calm you, James.
- No! No more drugs!

422
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:18,080
James, we have to do this.
You're very confused.

423
00:36:18,158 --> 00:36:20,524
No drugs! Stop it!

424
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:36,067
Kathryn, we've been working together for
four years. I've never seen you like this.

425
00:36:36,143 --> 00:36:40,307
So please stop being so defensive.
This isn't an inquisition.

426
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,713
I didn't think I was being defensive.
I was trying to explain exactly what...

427
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,685
He should've been in restraints.

428
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:50,382
It was bad judgment on your part,
plain and simple. Why not own up to it?

429
00:36:50,457 --> 00:36:53,392
Okay, it was bad judgment, but I have
the strangest feeling about him.

430
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,021
- I've seen him someplace, and I'm trying...
- Two policemen are in the hospital.

431
00:36:57,097 --> 00:37:00,396
Now we've got a security guard
with a skull fracture.

432
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:03,800
I said it was bad judgment!
What else do you want me to say?

433
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,395
You see that?
See what I mean?

434
00:37:06,473 --> 00:37:09,465
- You're being defensive. Isn't she being defensive?
- Dr. Fletcher?

435
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:14,537
- What?
- Ah, we have... another situation.

436
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:22,879
- He was fully restrained and the door was locked?
- Yes, sir. I did it myself.

437
00:37:22,956 --> 00:37:26,619
And he was fully sedated?

438
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:30,151
He was fully sedated.

439
00:37:40,006 --> 00:37:45,239
Then, are you trying to tell me a fully
sedated, fully restrained patient...

440
00:37:45,312 --> 00:37:48,975
somehow slipped out that vent,
replaced the grill behind him...

441
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:53,816
and is wriggling his way
through the ventilation system?

442
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:13,437
Watch it!

443
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:17,238
You sure fucked up!

444
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:24,275
- Where are you?
- Ah, you can talk!

445
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:32,154
What'd you do, Bobby boy?

446
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:35,717
My name's not Bob.

447
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:39,926
Not a prob, Bob.
Where'd they send you?

448
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,867
Where are you?

449
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:45,803
Another cell.

450
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:48,432
Maybe.

451
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:50,772
What do you mean "maybe"?
What's that supposed to mean?

452
00:38:50,844 --> 00:38:53,574
Maybe means...

453
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:56,639
maybe I'm in the next cell.

454
00:38:56,716 --> 00:39:00,379
Another volunteer like you.

455
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:03,820
Or maybe I'm in
the Central Office...

456
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:07,326
spying on ya
for all those science bozos.

457
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:09,862
Or hey,

458
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,229
maybe I'm not even here.

459
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,566
Maybe I'm just in your head.

460
00:39:18,805 --> 00:39:23,401
No way to confirm anything.

461
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:27,503
- Where'd they send ya?
- 1990.

462
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:33,110
'90! How was it?
Good drugs? Lots of pussy?

463
00:39:33,186 --> 00:39:36,883
Hey, Bob, you do the job?

464
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,256
You find out the big info?

465
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:43,023
Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

466
00:39:43,096 --> 00:39:45,587
It was supposed to be 1996.

467
00:39:45,665 --> 00:39:49,624
Science ain't an exact science
with these clowns,

468
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:52,365
but they're getting better.

469
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:56,899
You're lucky you didn't end up
in ancient Egypt.

470
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,535
Shh! They're comin'.

471
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:03,647
The Freedom for Animals
Association on Second Avenue...

472
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:06,550
is the secret headquarters
of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

473
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,317
They are the ones
who are going to do it.

474
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,359
I can't do any more.
I have to go now.

475
00:40:13,426 --> 00:40:16,361
Have a merry Christmas.

476
00:40:18,565 --> 00:40:20,362
- Well?
- What?

477
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:23,664
Did you or did you not
record that message?

478
00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:28,003
It's a reconstruction
of a deteriorated recording.

479
00:40:28,074 --> 00:40:32,704
Weak signal. We have to
put them together one word at a time.

480
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:34,770
We just finished rebuilding this.

481
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:38,545
Did you or did you not
make this call?

482
00:40:38,618 --> 00:40:44,079
I couldn't make any call. You sent me
to the wrong year. It was 1990.

483
00:40:44,157 --> 00:40:46,751
- 1990?
- 1990?

484
00:40:46,826 --> 00:40:50,227
- You're certain of that?
- What'd you do with your time, Cole?

485
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:53,095
Did you waste it on drugs? Women?

486
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:55,191
- They forced me to take drugs.
- Forced you?

487
00:40:55,268 --> 00:40:58,669
Why would someone
force you to take drugs?

488
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:05,344
I was in trouble.
I... got arrested.

489
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:09,746
I... I did what you wanted.

490
00:41:09,816 --> 00:41:12,478
I got a specimen, a spider.

491
00:41:12,552 --> 00:41:16,613
I didn't have anyplace
to put it, so I ate it.

492
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,456
But you sent me to the wrong year,
so it really doesn't matter.

493
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:23,553
Did you see this when you went back?

494
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,098
No, sir, I don't think so.

495
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:30,728
What about these people?
Did you see any of these people?

496
00:41:30,804 --> 00:41:32,829
No. No.

497
00:41:32,906 --> 00:41:35,841
Oh, wait, wait.

498
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:40,075
Him? You saw that man?

499
00:41:40,146 --> 00:41:43,809
Maybe in the... maybe in
the mental institution.

500
00:41:43,883 --> 00:41:47,785
You were
in a mental institution? Oh, God.

501
00:41:47,854 --> 00:41:51,984
Cole, you were sent back to make
some very important observations.

502
00:41:52,058 --> 00:41:53,992
You could've made a real contribution.

503
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,927
Helped us to reclaim the planet.

504
00:41:56,997 --> 00:41:59,397
As well as reducing your sentence.

505
00:41:59,466 --> 00:42:03,994
The question is, Cole,
do you want another chance?

506
00:42:25,225 --> 00:42:28,194
Good.

507
00:42:28,261 --> 00:42:32,960
- Last connection going on.
- Stand clear.

508
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:41,437
- He was your choice.
- Nothing we can do about that now.

509
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:19,644
No mistakes this time, Cole.

510
00:43:19,712 --> 00:43:22,909
Stay alert.
Keep your eyes open.

511
00:43:22,982 --> 00:43:26,713
Good thinking about the spider.
Try and do something like that again.

512
00:43:26,786 --> 00:43:28,651
Just relax now.
Don't fight it.

513
00:43:28,721 --> 00:43:31,849
We're sending you
to the third quarter of 1996.

514
00:43:31,925 --> 00:43:34,621
Right on the money.

515
00:44:10,196 --> 00:44:12,858
What? I don't understand!

516
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:16,993
What? I don't understand!

517
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:20,096
Where am I?

518
00:44:20,173 --> 00:44:24,303
I gotta find 'em!
I gotta find 'em!

519
00:44:24,377 --> 00:44:26,572
Help! I don't know where I am!

520
00:44:26,646 --> 00:44:30,013
- You gotta help me find 'em!
- Jose?

521
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:32,051
- Jose!
- Cole!

522
00:44:32,118 --> 00:44:34,848
Cole, where are we?
Where are we?

523
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:36,980
- Jose!
- Help me, Cole!

524
00:44:37,056 --> 00:44:39,149
Oh, God! Wait!

525
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:59,275
"In a season of great pestilence,
there are omens and divinations.

526
00:44:59,345 --> 00:45:01,609
And one of the four beasts
gave unto the seven angels...

527
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:04,844
seven golden vials
full of the wrath of God,

528
00:45:04,918 --> 00:45:09,446
who liveth forever and ever."
Revelations.

529
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:13,219
In the fourteenth century, according to the
accounts of local officials of that time,

530
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:16,729
this man appeared suddenly in
the village of Wyle near Stonehenge...

531
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:18,787
in April of 1362.

532
00:45:18,865 --> 00:45:22,323
Using unfamiliar words
and speaking in a strange accent,

533
00:45:22,402 --> 00:45:25,132
the man made dire prognostications
about a pestilence...

534
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:30,074
which he said would wipe out humanity
in approximately 600 years.

535
00:45:30,143 --> 00:45:34,443
Obviously, this plague-doomsday scenario
is more compelling...

536
00:45:34,514 --> 00:45:37,108
when reality supports it
with a virulent disease,

537
00:45:37,183 --> 00:45:39,947
whether it's the bubonic plague,
smallpox or AIDS.

538
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:43,352
Now we have technological horrors,
such as chemical warfare,

539
00:45:43,423 --> 00:45:47,723
which reared its ugly head during the
deadly mustard gas attacks of World War I.

540
00:45:47,794 --> 00:45:51,491
During such an attack in
the French trenches in October of 1917,

541
00:45:51,564 --> 00:45:55,762
we have an account of this soldier, who,
during an assault, was wounded by shrapnel...

542
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:59,066
and hospitalized,
apparently in a state of hysteria.

543
00:45:59,138 --> 00:46:02,107
Doctors found that he had lost
all comprehension of French,

544
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:04,473
but that he spoke
English fluently,

545
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:07,775
albeit in a regional dialect
they didn't recognize.

546
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:11,442
The man, though physically
unaffected by the gas,

547
00:46:11,517 --> 00:46:13,849
was beside himself.

548
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,684
He claimed that he had come
from the future...

549
00:46:16,756 --> 00:46:18,815
that he was looking
for a pure germ...

550
00:46:18,891 --> 00:46:21,917
that would ultimately wipe mankind
off the face of the Earth...

551
00:46:21,995 --> 00:46:26,830
starting in the year 1996.

552
00:46:26,899 --> 00:46:31,029
Though injured, the young soldier
disappeared from the hospital,

553
00:46:31,104 --> 00:46:33,504
no doubt trying to carry on
his mission to warn others,

554
00:46:33,573 --> 00:46:36,064
and substituting
for the agony of war...

555
00:46:36,142 --> 00:46:40,545
a self-inflicted agony
we call the "Cassandra Complex."

556
00:46:40,613 --> 00:46:43,582
Cassandra, in Greek legend,
was condemned to know the future...

557
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,483
but to be disbelieved
when she foretold it.

558
00:46:46,552 --> 00:46:50,682
Hence, the agony of foreknowledge combined
with the impotence to do anything about it.

559
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,896
I'm going right out
to get vaccinated.

560
00:47:06,973 --> 00:47:11,205
- Hi.
- I think, Dr. Railly, you've given the alarmists a bad name.

561
00:47:11,277 --> 00:47:14,940
- I have? - Mm-hmm. Surely there's
very real and convincing data...

562
00:47:15,014 --> 00:47:18,814
- that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race.
- This is true.

563
00:47:18,885 --> 00:47:23,049
Proliferation of atomic devices,
uncontrolled breeding habits,

564
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:26,717
pollution of land, sea and air,
the rape of the environment.

565
00:47:26,793 --> 00:47:31,662
In this context, isn't it obvious that
Chicken Little represents the sane vision,

566
00:47:31,731 --> 00:47:35,531
and that Homo sapiens' motto,
"Let's go shopping,"

567
00:47:35,601 --> 00:47:39,367
is the cry of the true lunatic?

568
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,930
- Kathryn, it's time.
- My name is Troy.

569
00:47:42,008 --> 00:47:46,240
Please, Dr. Railly. I wonder
if you're aware of my own studies.

570
00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:56,113
See you at work tomorrow.

571
00:47:56,189 --> 00:47:59,989
Give you a call tomorrow.

572
00:48:12,705 --> 00:48:15,970
No! No! Get in the car.

573
00:48:16,042 --> 00:48:20,035
Get in the car!
I've got a gun! Get in the car.

574
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:26,612
All right, drive.

575
00:48:26,686 --> 00:48:29,587
Take my purse. I've got a lot of cash
and credit cards. Take my keys!

576
00:48:29,655 --> 00:48:33,113
Start the car!

577
00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:39,764
No!

578
00:48:45,138 --> 00:48:48,574
Here, turn right.
Turn right here!

579
00:48:53,045 --> 00:48:55,309
Wh-Where are we going?

580
00:48:55,381 --> 00:48:58,145
- Philadelphia.
- That's more than a hundred miles!

581
00:48:58,217 --> 00:49:00,777
- That's why I can't walk there.
- Just let me go.

582
00:49:00,853 --> 00:49:03,515
- Just drive!
- You can take the car.

583
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:06,956
I don't know how to drive.

584
00:49:07,026 --> 00:49:10,792
I went underground when I was eight
years old. I told you that before.

585
00:49:10,863 --> 00:49:13,798
At the next corner, turn right.

586
00:49:13,866 --> 00:49:16,994
Cole. James Cole.

587
00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:20,800
You escaped from
a locked room six years ago.

588
00:49:20,873 --> 00:49:23,842
Six years for you.

589
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:25,639
- Turn around. Get goin'!
- Okay.

590
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:40,325
I can't believe that
this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.

591
00:49:40,393 --> 00:49:43,328
- Have you been following me?
- You said you would help me.

592
00:49:43,396 --> 00:49:46,593
I know this isn't what you meant,

593
00:49:46,666 --> 00:49:48,861
but I don't have any money.

594
00:49:48,935 --> 00:49:52,962
I hurt my leg,
and I've been sleeping on the street.

595
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:56,702
I'm sure I smell bad.
Do you have any food in this car?

596
00:49:56,776 --> 00:50:00,234
You have been following me,
haven't you?

597
00:50:00,313 --> 00:50:02,645
No.

598
00:50:02,715 --> 00:50:06,583
No, I saw this...

599
00:50:06,652 --> 00:50:09,553
in a store window.

600
00:50:09,622 --> 00:50:12,557
- I can read, remember?
- Uh-huh.

601
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:17,528
Yeah. Why do you want
to go to Philadelphia?

602
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:21,761
I checked out the Baltimore information.
It was nothing.

603
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:26,737
It's in Philadelphia. That's where
they are, the ones who did it.

604
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:29,775
The Twelve Monkeys.

605
00:50:29,842 --> 00:50:32,675
- Is that a radio?
- Yeah.

606
00:50:32,745 --> 00:50:34,542
Can you... turn it on?

607
00:50:36,949 --> 00:50:41,215
This is a personal message to you.

608
00:50:41,287 --> 00:50:46,224
Are you at the end of your rope?
Are you dying to get away?

609
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:49,750
The Florida Keys are waiting for you.
Ocean waves...

610
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:52,127
I've never seen the ocean!

611
00:50:52,198 --> 00:50:55,998
It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole.

612
00:50:56,068 --> 00:50:58,161
What is?

613
00:50:58,237 --> 00:51:01,400
It's an advertisement.
You do understand that?

614
00:51:01,474 --> 00:51:05,274
It's not really
a special message to you.

615
00:51:07,947 --> 00:51:09,938
Mr. Cole.

616
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:14,045
- You used to call me James.
- You prefer that?

617
00:51:16,022 --> 00:51:19,389
James, uh,
you don't really have a gun.

618
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:22,450
Can you turn this up?
Can you make this louder?

619
00:51:44,183 --> 00:51:47,778
Ah, I love the music
of the twentieth century!

620
00:51:49,388 --> 00:51:52,983
I love this air!
Love to breathe this air!

621
00:52:06,172 --> 00:52:08,800
WXBX news break.

622
00:52:08,874 --> 00:52:11,172
News as it happens.
Roger Pratt reporting.

623
00:52:11,243 --> 00:52:14,610
A story breaking with us now is emergency
crews are converging on a cornfield...

624
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,648
where playmates
of nine-year-old Ricky Neuman...

625
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,480
say they saw him disappear
right before their eyes.

626
00:52:19,552 --> 00:52:22,112
Young Neuman apparently stepped
into an abandoned well shaft,

627
00:52:22,188 --> 00:52:24,952
and is lodged somewhere
in the narrow 150-foot pipe.

628
00:52:25,024 --> 00:52:27,356
Possibly alive,
possibly seriously injured,

629
00:52:27,426 --> 00:52:29,485
playmates claim
they heard him cry out faintly.

630
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:32,963
- Never cry wolf.
- What?

631
00:52:33,032 --> 00:52:36,524
My father said that to me.
He said, "Never cry wolf."

632
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:39,799
'Cause then people won't believe you
if something really happens.

633
00:52:39,872 --> 00:52:44,434
If something really happens
like what, James?

634
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:48,640
Something bad. Can we have some more
music? I don't wanna hear this stuff.

635
00:52:48,714 --> 00:52:52,878
Can we hear more music?

636
00:52:52,952 --> 00:52:56,615
Oh, that's good!

637
00:53:17,576 --> 00:53:21,808
Hello, Dr. Railly? Yeah, this is
Wikke from Psyche Admitting.

638
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:24,372
Do you remember James Cole?

639
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,180
The paranoid who pulled
the Houdini back in '90?

640
00:53:27,253 --> 00:53:29,278
Well, he's back and...

641
00:53:29,355 --> 00:53:32,756
Sorry about that. He's looking for you.
I thought you ought to know.

642
00:53:32,825 --> 00:53:36,158
All right, take care.
- It's like I told you.

643
00:53:36,228 --> 00:53:40,187
Me and my husband went ahead
and she never showed.

644
00:53:40,266 --> 00:53:42,393
That is totally unlike her.

645
00:53:42,468 --> 00:53:45,494
- Do you know the make of her car?
- Um...

646
00:53:45,571 --> 00:53:49,063
Cherokee.
'94 Cherokee, silver.

647
00:53:51,343 --> 00:53:53,868
I have "doed-it!"

648
00:53:53,946 --> 00:53:55,573
I have "done doed-it"!
Ja!

649
00:53:55,648 --> 00:54:00,984
I, Professor Grossenfibber, have
invented the time tunnel! Oh, boy!

650
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:08,483
Oh, excuse me, mister.

651
00:54:13,132 --> 00:54:15,794
Excuse me, mister. Have a cigar.

652
00:54:22,675 --> 00:54:25,974
No!

653
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:30,675
Now my time machine
is ready for experiments.

654
00:54:34,653 --> 00:54:38,680
Ah, the woodpecker! Ja!
Yo-hoo, Woodpecker!

655
00:55:05,684 --> 00:55:09,120
You were in my dream just now.

656
00:55:10,389 --> 00:55:14,052
Your hair's different.
Different color.

657
00:55:15,828 --> 00:55:18,353
I'm sure it was you.

658
00:55:20,032 --> 00:55:22,933
What was the dream about?

659
00:55:24,703 --> 00:55:27,604
About an airport...

660
00:55:27,673 --> 00:55:30,005
before everything happened.

661
00:55:30,075 --> 00:55:33,636
It's the same dream
I always have.

662
00:55:33,712 --> 00:55:36,681
When I was a kid.

663
00:55:36,749 --> 00:55:38,717
And I was in it?

664
00:55:38,784 --> 00:55:41,275
What did I do?

665
00:55:41,353 --> 00:55:43,821
You were very upset.

666
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:49,355
You're always very upset
in the dream.

667
00:55:49,428 --> 00:55:53,660
- Just never knew it was you.
- It wasn't me before, James.

668
00:55:53,732 --> 00:55:59,432
It's become me now because of
what's happening.

669
00:55:59,505 --> 00:56:02,599
Could you please untie me?

670
00:56:05,978 --> 00:56:09,414
No, I think it was always you.

671
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:12,177
Very strange.

672
00:56:12,251 --> 00:56:17,154
You're flushed, and you were moaning.
I think you're running a fever.

673
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:28,692
What are you doing?

674
00:56:40,946 --> 00:56:44,814
In Fresno, California, crews continue to
attempt to rescue nine-year-old Ricky Neuman.

675
00:56:50,089 --> 00:56:53,320
And closer to home,
in Baltimore, Kathryn Railly,

676
00:56:53,392 --> 00:56:57,055
prominent psychiatrist and the author
of a newly released book on insanity,

677
00:56:57,129 --> 00:57:01,293
disappeared mysteriously last night
after a lecture at the university.

678
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:04,734
Former mental patient, James Cole,
is wanted for questioning...

679
00:57:04,803 --> 00:57:07,237
regarding Dr. Railly's disappearance.

680
00:57:07,306 --> 00:57:09,467
Authorities warn that Cole
has a history of violence...

681
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:13,307
and advise anyone spotting him
to notify authorities at once.

682
00:57:23,355 --> 00:57:25,755
Love this music.

683
00:57:25,824 --> 00:57:28,486
We don't have this.
We don't have anything like this.

684
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:32,326
- What are all those?
- These?

685
00:57:32,398 --> 00:57:35,299
My notes. Clues.

686
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:38,427
- What kind of clues?
- It's about the secret army.

687
00:57:38,504 --> 00:57:41,769
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
They're the ones that spread the virus.

688
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,866
That's why I'm here.
I have to find them. That's my mission.

689
00:57:44,944 --> 00:57:49,643
I just have to locate them because they have
the virus in its pure form before it mutates.

690
00:57:49,715 --> 00:57:52,707
When I locate them,
they'll send a scientist here.

691
00:57:52,785 --> 00:57:54,844
That scientist
will study the virus.

692
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,981
Then when he goes back to the present,
he and the scientists will make a cure.

693
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,117
...police officers
from three jurisdictions,

694
00:58:01,193 --> 00:58:04,651
including special
tactical unit personnel,

695
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:08,894
have now been mobilized to control
the growing thousands of onlookers...

696
00:58:08,968 --> 00:58:12,995
- in Fresno, California...
- Does that disturb you?

697
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:16,940
No. I thought it was about us.

698
00:58:17,009 --> 00:58:20,809
I thought maybe they'd captured us
and arrested me.

699
00:58:20,879 --> 00:58:23,177
Just a joke.

700
00:58:23,248 --> 00:58:25,409
Hmm.

701
00:58:28,153 --> 00:58:31,680
I remember being very afraid
for that little boy.

702
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:35,750
All alone, down that well, not knowing
if anybody's gonna get him out.

703
00:58:35,828 --> 00:58:39,264
The first time I was ever
really afraid when I was a kid.

704
00:58:39,331 --> 00:58:41,526
What do you mean,
when you were a kid?

705
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,659
Never mind.

706
00:58:43,736 --> 00:58:46,534
Just a prank, a hoax.
That boy's hiding in a barn.

707
00:58:59,018 --> 00:59:01,953
"There are omens and divinations.

708
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:05,684
One of the four beasts
gave unto the seven angels...

709
00:59:05,758 --> 00:59:09,421
seven golden vials
full of the wrath of God,

710
00:59:09,495 --> 00:59:13,124
who liveth forever and ever."

711
00:59:13,198 --> 00:59:17,999
You won't think I'm crazy
when people start dying next month.

712
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:21,096
First they'll think
it's just some weird fever.

713
00:59:24,443 --> 00:59:26,911
Then they'll find out.

714
00:59:26,979 --> 00:59:29,709
They'll catch on.

715
00:59:29,782 --> 00:59:31,545
Wait!

716
00:59:31,617 --> 00:59:34,450
Stop here! Stop the car!
Stop right here!

717
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:41,487
I was right!
They're here!

718
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:45,223
You see? Twelve Monkeys.
Twelve Monkeys.

719
00:59:45,297 --> 00:59:49,597
Do you believe me now?
Come on!

720
00:59:51,136 --> 00:59:53,400
Come on!

721
00:59:53,472 --> 00:59:55,633
They're here!
You see?

722
00:59:55,707 --> 00:59:58,175
Twelve Monkeys!

723
00:59:58,243 --> 01:00:00,268
Twelve Monkeys.
Come on!

724
01:00:02,714 --> 01:00:04,443
Twelve Monkeys.

725
01:00:04,516 --> 01:00:07,110
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, here.

726
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,518
Here. Do you see it?
Do you see?

727
01:00:09,588 --> 01:00:12,056
I see some red paint, some marks.

728
01:00:12,124 --> 01:00:14,592
- Marks? Marks? Do you think that...
- Oh, this is ridicu...

729
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,753
- Hey! Hey!
- What?

730
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:22,324
Don't you do anything crazy...
or I'll hurt somebody!

731
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:25,802
I am not gonna do anything crazy, but
none of this is what you think it is.

732
01:00:25,871 --> 01:00:28,305
You can't hide from them, Bob.

733
01:00:29,475 --> 01:00:33,036
I said,
you can't hide from them.

734
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,114
No, sir, ol' Bob.

735
01:00:37,182 --> 01:00:39,844
Don't even try.

736
01:00:42,888 --> 01:00:45,652
They hear everything.

737
01:00:45,724 --> 01:00:49,558
They got that tracking device on ya.

738
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:55,024
They can find you anywhere,
anytime!

739
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,796
It's in the tooth.

740
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:00,361
Right, Bob?

741
01:01:00,439 --> 01:01:04,808
But I fooled 'em, old buddy.

742
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,182
They don't have to spy on me.
I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

743
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:15,152
You see?
Here it is again.

744
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:18,451
Here, follow this paint trail.

745
01:01:18,524 --> 01:01:20,515
Here. It's here.
See?

746
01:01:20,592 --> 01:01:24,858
- It's so awful! I...
- No, no, no! Come with me!

747
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:27,763
- Damn it!
- The paint trail goes here.

748
01:01:30,369 --> 01:01:33,896
Let go! Let go of my arm.
James, we shouldn't be here.

749
01:01:33,972 --> 01:01:36,600
Goddamn it.

750
01:01:42,748 --> 01:01:45,945
Leave me alone!

751
01:01:48,387 --> 01:01:51,914
Let's get outta here.
James, we shouldn't be here.

752
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:55,050
Hey!

753
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,965
Please, don't kill me!

754
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,031
Don't kill me. Please!
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

755
01:02:16,882 --> 01:02:18,577
Stick around, bitch.

756
01:02:40,973 --> 01:02:43,601
Are you all right?

757
01:02:47,179 --> 01:02:49,147
Is he alive?

758
01:02:50,515 --> 01:02:53,313
Come on.
We're runnin' out of time.

759
01:02:53,385 --> 01:02:57,287
- You can't help him.
- Oh, Jesus! James, you killed him!

760
01:02:57,356 --> 01:03:00,189
All I see are dead people.
Come on.

761
01:03:00,259 --> 01:03:04,389
- Come on.
- You never had a gun before.

762
01:03:04,463 --> 01:03:08,456
I have one now.
Come on. Come on!

763
01:03:08,533 --> 01:03:11,366
"...dragons in
their pleasant palaces.

764
01:03:11,436 --> 01:03:16,874
The seventh angel poured out
his vial into the air, and there came..."

765
01:03:16,942 --> 01:03:19,502
You! You!

766
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:22,046
You're one of us!

767
01:03:37,429 --> 01:03:39,659
This is it.

768
01:03:39,731 --> 01:03:41,699
Come on.

769
01:03:53,912 --> 01:03:58,349
Um... can we help you?

770
01:04:02,688 --> 01:04:05,213
It's just a tape.

771
01:04:08,226 --> 01:04:10,990
I'm looking for
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

772
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:17,201
We don't know anything about
any Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

773
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:19,829
- So you and your friend just disappear.
- I just want some information.

774
01:04:19,905 --> 01:04:23,864
- Didn't you hear me? I sa...
- Don't hurt her.

775
01:04:23,942 --> 01:04:29,005
Please, I'm a psychiatrist.
J-Just do whatever he tells you to do.

776
01:04:29,081 --> 01:04:31,914
He's disturbed.
He's dangerous.

777
01:04:31,983 --> 01:04:33,917
Please, just cooperate.

778
01:04:33,985 --> 01:04:36,783
- What do you want, money? We only got a few bucks.
- I told you what I want.

779
01:04:36,855 --> 01:04:38,880
- Get down. Lock that door.
- James, don't...

780
01:04:38,957 --> 01:04:42,757
Lock it now!

781
01:04:42,828 --> 01:04:45,626
- I told you fucking Goines would get us...
- Shut up!

782
01:04:45,697 --> 01:04:47,631
Goines?

783
01:04:49,101 --> 01:04:52,298
Jeffrey Goines?

784
01:04:52,371 --> 01:04:57,206
Then Jeffrey becomes this big star,
and the media latch onto him because...

785
01:04:57,275 --> 01:05:00,472
he's picketing his own father,
a famous Nobel prize-winning virologist.

786
01:05:00,545 --> 01:05:04,914
- You must've seen all that on TV.
- I don't watch TV.

787
01:05:04,983 --> 01:05:06,951
Is this him?

788
01:05:07,018 --> 01:05:09,543
Yeah, that's him. That's him.

789
01:05:09,621 --> 01:05:12,920
What are you gonna do to us?

790
01:05:14,526 --> 01:05:17,723
Tell me more about Jeffrey.

791
01:05:17,796 --> 01:05:20,162
Jeffrey started getting bored
with the shit we do.

792
01:05:20,232 --> 01:05:23,258
Picketing, leafleting,
letter-writing stuff.

793
01:05:23,335 --> 01:05:26,168
He said we were ineffectual,
liberal jerk-offs.

794
01:05:26,238 --> 01:05:30,937
He wanted to do guerrilla actions
in order to educate the public.

795
01:05:31,009 --> 01:05:34,137
- Like this?
- Yeah. That's when he let 100 snakes loose in the Senate.

796
01:05:34,212 --> 01:05:36,976
But we weren't
into that kind of stuff.

797
01:05:37,048 --> 01:05:40,745
- It's counterproductive. We told him.
- So he and 11 guys,

798
01:05:40,819 --> 01:05:44,653
they split off and formed
this underground army.

799
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:49,454
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
See?

800
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:54,164
They started planning a "Human Hunt."

801
01:05:54,232 --> 01:05:56,700
They bought
stun guns, nets and bear traps.

802
01:05:56,768 --> 01:05:58,998
They were gonna go to Wall Street
and trap lawyers and bankers...

803
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:01,766
They didn't do it, of course.
They didn't do any of it.

804
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,606
Like always, Mr. Big Shot
sold his friends out.

805
01:06:05,677 --> 01:06:07,907
What does that mean?

806
01:06:07,979 --> 01:06:10,812
He goes on TV and gives a news
conference. Tells the whole world...

807
01:06:10,882 --> 01:06:13,851
he just realized his daddy's experiments
are vital for humanity...

808
01:06:14,238 --> 01:06:17,503
and that the use of animals
is absolutely necessary.

809
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:22,102
And that from now on he, Jeffrey Goines,
is going to personally supervise the labs...

810
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:25,148
to make sure the little animals
aren't going to suffer.

811
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:33,180
What is this?

812
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:44,825
People like that aren't accessible,
okay? You can't just barge in on them.

813
01:06:44,902 --> 01:06:48,668
- It's not how the world works.
- Be quiet and drive the car. I know what I'm doing.

814
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:51,572
No, you don't.
This car is stolen.

815
01:06:51,642 --> 01:06:55,601
And we are in big trouble.
Big trouble.

816
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:00,173
If you don't turn yourself over, the police are
going to kill you. They're going to shoot me too,

817
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,980
- 'cause I'm going to be the accessory to murder.
- You're all going to die.

818
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:06,887
Nobody is going to die.

819
01:07:06,957 --> 01:07:10,358
You're not going to save the world.

820
01:07:10,427 --> 01:07:12,691
Okay? You're delusional.

821
01:07:12,763 --> 01:07:16,324
- You've made all this up out of bits and pieces in your head.
- No.

822
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,029
Yes. Let me give you an example.

823
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:25,700
You know Jeffrey Goines. You were
both patients at County Hospital.

824
01:07:25,776 --> 01:07:27,937
Jeffrey Goines was a fruitcake.

825
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:32,846
He told you then his father was a
famous scientist who worked with viruses.

826
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:35,578
You've incorporated that bit
of information to this cockeyed fantasy.

827
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:38,450
He didn't say his father was a
scientist. He said his father was God.

828
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:41,548
- This is insane.
- ...prominent psychiatrist and author,

829
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:46,187
Dr. Kathryn Railly, has been abducted by
a dangerous mental patient, James Cole.

830
01:07:46,263 --> 01:07:51,360
Cole was under Railly's care six years
ago when he made a dramatic escape from...

831
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:02,542
- What is the matter with your leg?
- I got shot.

832
01:08:02,613 --> 01:08:05,446
Shot! Who shot you?

833
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:09,417
I don't know.
It was some kind of war. Never mind.

834
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:11,886
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

835
01:08:11,955 --> 01:08:13,718
What are you doing?

836
01:08:15,826 --> 01:08:18,989
- We don't need gas.
- I thought you didn't know how to drive.

837
01:08:19,062 --> 01:08:23,158
I said I was too young to drive.
I didn't say I was stupid.

838
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:28,671
This can't go on. If you have a bullet
in your leg, I have to take care of it.

839
01:08:28,739 --> 01:08:32,732
I'm a doctor.
I need some supplies.

840
01:08:53,897 --> 01:08:56,058
Meanwhile, in Fresno, California,

841
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:59,398
where mining engineers continue their
desperate attempt to sink a shaft...

842
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:03,803
parallel to the one in which nine-year-old
Ricky Neuman is believed trapped.

843
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:06,274
Authorities say there is
still a chance the boy might be...

844
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:09,005
You shouldn't put
your weight on it.

845
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:12,014
You need stitches
and antibiotics.

846
01:09:12,082 --> 01:09:14,880
Lucky for you
it's near the surface.

847
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:23,351
I love seeing the sun.

848
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:28,089
- Ooh!
- Wait.

849
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:32,162
Let me help you.

850
01:09:36,573 --> 01:09:39,974
You smell so good.

851
01:09:41,111 --> 01:09:43,739
You have to give yourself up.

852
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:50,119
Y-You know that, don't you?

853
01:09:54,391 --> 01:09:56,791
W-What are you doing? James?

854
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,590
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

855
01:09:59,663 --> 01:10:04,623
- James, stop it! What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

856
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,896
- Let go of me!
- I have to do this.

857
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:14,810
- They find him?
- Who?

858
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:17,438
- That kid. The one in the pipe.
- You believe that?

859
01:10:17,514 --> 01:10:21,848
They're lowering a monkey down there and a
miniature infrared camera strapped on him,

860
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:24,751
and a roast beef sandwich
wrapped up in tin foil.

861
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:28,348
- You're making it up.
- No, I shit you not. Life is really weird.

862
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:31,394
A monkey
and a roast beef sandwich.

863
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:43,806
W-W-Would that I
could enjoy this opulent dinner...

864
01:10:43,874 --> 01:10:48,470
and this most, uh, stimulatin'
and excitin' company...

865
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:52,481
for itself
with no sense of purpose.

866
01:10:52,549 --> 01:10:57,714
But, alas, I am burdened.

867
01:10:57,788 --> 01:11:01,588
For with all this excess of public
attention and cacophony of praise...

868
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:05,992
there comes
great responsibility.

869
01:11:06,063 --> 01:11:10,466
- I don't have to tell you all
that the dangers of science...

870
01:11:10,534 --> 01:11:13,162
are a timeworn threat.

871
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:16,603
- From Prometheus stealin' fire from the gods...
- What friend?

872
01:11:16,673 --> 01:11:19,801
- I'm not expectin' anyone.
- to the Cold War era of the Dr. Strangelove terror.

873
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:24,540
- But never before...
- This is ridiculous.

874
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:28,175
My father's giving
a major address.

875
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:33,689
...to fear the power...
we have at hand.

876
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:39,559
Normally, if we caught a guy sneakin' around
like this with no I.D., we'd bust his ass.

877
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,563
Excuse my French.

878
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,997
This one says he knows you.

879
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:47,696
Since you seem to have had
a few unusual associates,

880
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:50,797
we certainly would not want
to arrest one of your closest pals.

881
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:09,758
Never seen him before in my life.

882
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:13,125
Feel free to torture this man,
or whatever it is you do.

883
01:12:13,196 --> 01:12:16,256
I'm going to listen to my father's
eloquent discourse on...

884
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:19,700
I'm here about some monkeys.

885
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:22,499
- Monkeys?
- Monkeys. Yes.

886
01:12:22,572 --> 01:12:25,507
Twelve of them.

887
01:12:28,378 --> 01:12:30,369
Arnold.

888
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:33,007
- You look like shit.
- You know this man?

889
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:36,849
I know this man.
Arnold... Pettibone. Mm-hmm.

890
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,151
Gee, Arnie. It's black tie.
I said drop by,

891
01:12:40,223 --> 01:12:44,319
but it's Dad's big do...
V.I.P.s, senators, Secret Service.

892
01:12:44,394 --> 01:12:47,886
You hungry, Arnie?

893
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:51,991
Killer feast we're putting on tonight.
Lots of dead lamb, dead cow, dead pig.

894
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:53,933
Shall we?

895
01:12:54,004 --> 01:12:56,268
Hi. How are you?
Hello.

896
01:12:56,339 --> 01:12:59,934
Very attractive.
"The Great Escape," 1990.

897
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:03,138
Watch it! Huh?
County Hospital? Am I right?

898
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:07,309
I can't do anything about what you're
going to do. I can't change anything.

899
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:11,320
- I can't stop you. I just want the information.
- We need to talk. C'mon.

900
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:15,518
Hi, ladies. Nice to see you again.
Watch your step on the way down.

901
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:18,652
Who blabbed?
Bruhns? Weller?

902
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:21,219
- I just want access to the pure virus.
- Virus?

903
01:13:21,298 --> 01:13:23,892
For the future. I need to know
where it is and exactly what it is.

904
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,265
Ahh, I get it.
I see what you're up to.

905
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:28,600
- It's your old plan, isn't it?
- What plan?

906
01:13:28,672 --> 01:13:31,004
- Your plan. Remember?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

907
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:34,566
Yes, you do. We were in the dayroom
watching television...

908
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:37,545
and you were upset about the desecration
of the planet, which I understand.

909
01:13:37,614 --> 01:13:40,606
Then you said to me, "Wouldn't it
be great if there was a germ or virus...

910
01:13:40,684 --> 01:13:43,847
that would wipe out all of mankind
and leave the animals and trees?"

911
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,911
- You're trying to confuse me.
- You were so funny.

912
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:48,583
I told you my father was
this famous virologist, and you said,

913
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:52,424
"He could make a germ, and we could
steal it." Coo-coo-ka-roo, you were.

914
01:13:52,495 --> 01:13:55,487
They mutate!
We live underground!

915
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:59,934
The world belongs to the dogs and cats.
We live like worms.

916
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:02,267
I just need the information.

917
01:14:02,339 --> 01:14:06,036
- Take it easy.
- You are a total nutcase! Completely deranged!

918
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:10,671
Delusional, paranoid.
Your process is all fucked up.

919
01:14:10,747 --> 01:14:13,307
Your information tray
is jammed, man!

920
01:14:13,383 --> 01:14:16,045
Do you know what it is,
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

921
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:19,054
It's a collection of space-case
do-gooders saving rain forests.

922
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:21,090
I have nothing to do
with those bozos.

923
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:23,091
I quit being
the rich kid fall guy...

924
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:25,457
for a bunch
of ineffective fanatics!

925
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:28,258
So much for your grand plot,
asshole!

926
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:33,030
Father's been warning people about dangers of
experimentation with D.N.A. viruses for years.

927
01:14:33,103 --> 01:14:36,539
You've processed that information through
your addled, paranoid infrastructure.

928
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:42,101
Lo and behold, a nonprofit organization
becomes some sinister, revolutionary cabal!

929
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:44,305
This man is complete bat shit!

930
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:47,373
Ladies and gentlemen,
do you realize where he thinks...

931
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:49,884
he comes from?

932
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:54,756
Capt. Dan Miller, the man
in charge of the rescue operation,

933
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:59,056
says he has consulted with experts,
and they assure us...

934
01:14:59,129 --> 01:15:03,088
If you ask me, the monkey's gonna eat
that goddamn sandwich himself.

935
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:05,600
Did a man just come running
through here?

936
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:10,003
...saying his primary
responsibility was to the missing boy.

937
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:14,567
Police say that the body of a woman found
strangled in the Knutson State Park...

938
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:16,669
could be kidnapping victim...

939
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:19,180
Dr. Kathryn Railly.

940
01:15:21,318 --> 01:15:24,412
Anybody see someone
come through here?

941
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:28,014
...discovered less than
an hour ago by hikers.

942
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:30,616
But we have an unconfirmed report
that the victim,

943
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:35,063
a woman in her late twenties or early
thirties, was savagely mutilated.

944
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:38,396
Earlier in the day, police located
Railly's abandoned car.

945
01:15:38,468 --> 01:15:40,993
It was found not far...

946
01:15:41,071 --> 01:15:44,199
Any sign of him?

947
01:15:44,274 --> 01:15:46,765
Nothing.

948
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:50,939
He can't just disappear.

949
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:12,461
You bastard!

950
01:16:14,938 --> 01:16:19,238
I could've died in there!
You son of a bitch!

951
01:16:19,309 --> 01:16:21,436
What were you thinking of,

952
01:16:21,511 --> 01:16:25,948
- you twisted sack of shit?
- I'm sorry.

953
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:29,212
Sorry I locked you
in the trunk.

954
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:33,813
I'm sick of you.

955
01:16:38,128 --> 01:16:41,154
What have you done?
Did you kill somebody?

956
01:16:41,231 --> 01:16:46,533
- Yes. A million people. Five billion people.
- What?

957
01:16:46,603 --> 01:16:51,597
Jeffrey Goines said
it was my idea about the virus.

958
01:16:51,674 --> 01:16:56,043
We were in the institution. It was
all... so fuzzy, and the drugs and all.

959
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:59,013
Do you think it was my idea?

960
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:02,142
Do you think maybe
I've wiped out the human race?

961
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:05,187
Nobody is gonna wipe out
the human race.

962
01:17:05,255 --> 01:17:08,247
Not you or Jeffrey
or anybody else.

963
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:11,657
You've created something
in your mind. A... Oh.

964
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:14,822
- Mentally divergent?
- A... Whatever!

965
01:17:14,898 --> 01:17:17,799
A substitute reality...

966
01:17:17,867 --> 01:17:21,598
because you don't want
to deal with anything.

967
01:17:21,671 --> 01:17:25,573
I would love it if that was true.

968
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:28,406
It can be dealt with,
but only if you want to.

969
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:32,642
I can help you.

970
01:17:32,715 --> 01:17:36,811
- They're after me. We have to get outta here.
- Who is after you?

971
01:17:36,886 --> 01:17:40,617
I think there were
some policemen at that party.

972
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:43,488
Party? You went to a par...

973
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,494
Never mind.

974
01:17:45,562 --> 01:17:48,395
It's important you surrender
instead of their catching you running.

975
01:17:48,465 --> 01:17:51,525
Wouldn't it be great if I was crazy?
The world would be okay.

976
01:17:51,601 --> 01:17:53,694
- Gimme the gun.
- I wouldn't live underground. I lost the gun.

977
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,931
I could live right here.

978
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:59,736
You got water, air, stars.

979
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:02,539
- I'm gonna attract their attention...
- Debris.

980
01:18:02,612 --> 01:18:05,581
so they know where we are.

981
01:18:05,648 --> 01:18:08,208
Oh, I love this world!

982
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:10,616
They're gonna tell you to put your hands
on your head. Do what they say.

983
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,848
I love the frogs, the spiders.

984
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:17,086
Remember, I'll be with you.
I'll help you. I won't let them...

985
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:31,537
Then I said something about cooperating,
and he said he would do that.

986
01:18:31,608 --> 01:18:35,271
So, I, um...
I got in the car.

987
01:18:35,345 --> 01:18:39,645
Thanks. And when I...
I started honking the horn.

988
01:18:39,716 --> 01:18:43,880
- Then when I got out, he was gone.
- I'll tell you somethin'.

989
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:48,083
You lucked out. For a while, we thought
you were a body found downstate mutilated.

990
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:51,684
- He wouldn't do that.
- This the man he attacked?

991
01:18:55,832 --> 01:18:58,062
I wanna be clear about this, okay?

992
01:18:58,134 --> 01:19:00,568
This man and the other one
were severely beating us.

993
01:19:00,637 --> 01:19:05,336
James Cole didn't start it.
In fact, he saved me.

994
01:19:05,408 --> 01:19:08,138
Funny thing, Doctor.

995
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:12,705
Maybe you can explain it to me,
you being a psychiatrist and all.

996
01:19:12,782 --> 01:19:18,049
Why is it that kidnap victims always try
to tell us about the guys that grabbed 'em?

997
01:19:18,121 --> 01:19:21,022
And they try
to make us understand...

998
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:24,218
how kind these bastards
really were.

999
01:19:24,294 --> 01:19:27,752
It's a normal reaction
to a life-threatening situation.

1000
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:32,957
He's sick. Okay?

1001
01:19:33,036 --> 01:19:36,733
He thinks he comes from the future.
He's been living in...

1002
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:40,242
a meticulously constructed fantasy world,
and that world is starting to disintegrate.

1003
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:43,711
He needs help.

1004
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:48,784
Okay.

1005
01:19:48,851 --> 01:19:53,652
Exhausted but apparently
unharmed by her thirty-hour ordeal,

1006
01:19:53,723 --> 01:19:57,955
Dr. Railly returned to Baltimore this
morning without making a public statement.

1007
01:19:58,027 --> 01:20:01,861
The author and psychiatrist
is currently in seclusion at her home.

1008
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:05,765
Meantime, police have pieced together
a scenario of the series of events...

1009
01:20:05,835 --> 01:20:08,998
that began with
escaped mental patient James Cole...

1010
01:20:09,072 --> 01:20:12,599
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay. I'm just... hyperalert.

1011
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:14,870
I can't sleep.

1012
01:20:14,944 --> 01:20:19,938
- Did you take your sedative? - I hate
those things. They mess my head up. Uh-uh.

1013
01:20:20,016 --> 01:20:22,450
...where he went
on a rampage of violence.

1014
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:24,986
With the kidnapping
of the Baltimore woman, James Cole...

1015
01:20:25,054 --> 01:20:28,854
is now also wanted in connection with
the brutal slaying of Rodney Wiggins,

1016
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:31,553
an ex-convict from Ardmore.

1017
01:20:31,628 --> 01:20:33,721
His body was discovered
in an abandoned theater...

1018
01:20:33,796 --> 01:20:37,288
not far from where Cole left three animal
rights activists bound and gagged...

1019
01:20:37,367 --> 01:20:40,029
in their Second Avenue headquarters.

1020
01:20:40,103 --> 01:20:44,164
Do they really believe
he's going to show up here? Please.

1021
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:47,437
And in Fresno, California, the cornfield
that was jammed with spectators...

1022
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,705
He's dead, isn't he,
that little boy?

1023
01:20:49,779 --> 01:20:53,180
He's fine. It was just a prank
he and his friends pulled.

1024
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:56,548
The dramatic attempt to rescue Ricky
Neuman from an abandoned mine shaft...

1025
01:20:56,619 --> 01:21:01,181
ended abruptly when playmates confessed
that Neuman's disappearance was a prank...

1026
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:05,387
and that, in fact, the missing child
was hiding in a nearby barn.

1027
01:21:27,517 --> 01:21:30,008
Congratulations, Cole!

1028
01:21:30,086 --> 01:21:32,384
- Well done. Well done!
- Congratulations.

1029
01:21:32,455 --> 01:21:35,253
During your interview,
while under the influence,

1030
01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:38,054
- you told us that you liked music.
- This isn't a prison.

1031
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:40,857
- This is a hospital.
- Until you recover your equilibrium.

1032
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:43,524
- You're still disoriented.
- It is a stressful thing.

1033
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:46,295
- Time travel.
- You stood up very well, considering.

1034
01:21:46,369 --> 01:21:49,668
You connected the Army of the Twelve
Monkeys with a famous virologist and his son.

1035
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:52,071
- Others will take over now.
- We'll be back on service in months.

1036
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:56,043
- We'll retake the planet.
- This is it, James. What you've been working for.

1037
01:21:56,112 --> 01:21:59,138
- A full pardon.
- You'll be out of here in no time.

1038
01:21:59,215 --> 01:22:04,243
- Women will want to know you.
- I don't want your women! I want to get well!

1039
01:22:07,957 --> 01:22:10,755
And you will be well, James.

1040
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:15,056
Soon.

1041
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:20,301
You know, you people don't exist.
You're not real.

1042
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:24,738
We can't travel back in time.
Whoop! Whoop! Uh-uh.

1043
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:28,675
You're not here.
You can't trick me.

1044
01:22:28,745 --> 01:22:32,181
You're in my... You're in my mind.

1045
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:37,083
I am insane.

1046
01:22:37,153 --> 01:22:39,621
And you are my insanity.

1047
01:22:49,766 --> 01:22:54,203
He not only used the word "prank,"
he said the boy was hiding in a barn.

1048
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:57,831
Kathryn, Kathryn.
He kidnapped you.

1049
01:22:57,907 --> 01:23:00,501
You saw him murder somebody,

1050
01:23:00,576 --> 01:23:05,343
and you knew there was a real
possibility he could kill you too.

1051
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:07,814
You're under
tremendous emotional stress.

1052
01:23:07,884 --> 01:23:10,648
For God's sake, Owen,
listen to me.

1053
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,382
He knew about the boy in Fresno,
and he says five billion people...

1054
01:23:13,456 --> 01:23:14,889
are gonna die.

1055
01:23:14,957 --> 01:23:17,187
No way he could possibly know that!

1056
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:19,023
Kathryn!

1057
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:23,259
You're a rational person.
You're a trained psychiatrist.

1058
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:26,358
You know the difference between
what's real and what's not.

1059
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:29,370
What we say is the truth
is what everybody accepts. Right?

1060
01:23:29,438 --> 01:23:31,963
Psychiatry...
it's the latest religion.

1061
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:35,670
We decide what's right and wrong.
We decide who's crazy or not.

1062
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,310
I'm in trouble here.

1063
01:23:40,383 --> 01:23:43,147
I'm losing my faith.

1064
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:46,746
You sure fucked up, Bob.

1065
01:23:46,823 --> 01:23:51,783
But I can understand. You don't want
your mistakes pointed out to you.

1066
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:55,092
I can relate to that, old Bob.

1067
01:23:55,164 --> 01:23:58,600
Hey, I know what you're thinkin'.

1068
01:23:58,668 --> 01:24:02,604
You're thinkin' I don't exist
except in your head.

1069
01:24:02,672 --> 01:24:05,004
I see that point of view.

1070
01:24:05,074 --> 01:24:10,910
- But you could still talk to me, couldn't ya?
- I saw you...

1071
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:14,746
in 1996, in the real world.

1072
01:24:14,817 --> 01:24:19,015
- You pulled out your teeth.
- Why would I pull out my teeth?

1073
01:24:19,088 --> 01:24:24,048
That's a no-no.
And when did you say you saw me?

1074
01:24:24,126 --> 01:24:26,959
- In 1872?
- Leave me alone!

1075
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:30,726
Yellin' won't get you
what you want.

1076
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,736
You have to be smart
to get what you want.

1077
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:38,330
And what do I want?

1078
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:41,240
You don't know what you want?

1079
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:46,304
Sure you do, Bob.
You know what you want.

1080
01:24:46,382 --> 01:24:49,749
You tell me.
You tell me what I want.

1081
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:54,279
To see the sky and the ocean.

1082
01:24:54,357 --> 01:24:56,882
To be topside.

1083
01:24:56,959 --> 01:24:59,359
Breathe the air.

1084
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:02,955
To be with... her.

1085
01:25:03,032 --> 01:25:08,664
Isn't that right?
Isn't that what you want?

1086
01:25:08,738 --> 01:25:10,729
Bob?

1087
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:27,281
Hello.

1088
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:30,152
Dr. Railly,
Jim Halperin, Philly P.D.

1089
01:25:30,226 --> 01:25:35,596
- Sorry to call you so early this mornin'.
- You found him? Is he okay?

1090
01:25:35,665 --> 01:25:38,133
No, no.
Au contraire, Doctor.

1091
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:42,466
No sign of your good friend, the
kidnapper. However, the plot does thicken.

1092
01:25:42,538 --> 01:25:44,699
I've got a ballistics report
on my desk.

1093
01:25:44,774 --> 01:25:49,473
It says the bullet you claim you removed
from Mr. Cole's thigh is, in fact, an antique.

1094
01:25:49,545 --> 01:25:51,638
And all indications are...

1095
01:25:51,714 --> 01:25:55,309
it was fired sometime prior
to the 1920s.

1096
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:57,614
- How 'bout I take a spin down there?
- This can't be.

1097
01:25:57,687 --> 01:25:59,621
Maybe you and I can grab
a bite to eat.

1098
01:25:59,689 --> 01:26:04,149
Maybe you could revise or amplify
your statement. Dr. Railly?

1099
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,086
No!

1100
01:26:37,393 --> 01:26:39,987
You can't trick us, you know.

1101
01:26:40,062 --> 01:26:43,498
- It wouldn't work.
- No, sir.

1102
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:47,764
You haven't become addicted,
have you, Cole,

1103
01:26:47,837 --> 01:26:49,771
to that dying world?

1104
01:26:49,839 --> 01:26:52,171
No, sir.

1105
01:26:52,241 --> 01:26:54,801
I just want to do my part
to get us back on top,

1106
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:56,936
in charge of the planet.

1107
01:26:57,013 --> 01:27:00,505
And I have the experience.
I know the people involved.

1108
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:03,609
He really is
the most qualified.

1109
01:27:03,686 --> 01:27:05,745
But all that behavior.

1110
01:27:05,821 --> 01:27:08,415
You said we weren't real, Cole.

1111
01:27:08,491 --> 01:27:14,293
I don't think the human mind is meant
to exist in... t-two different...

1112
01:27:14,363 --> 01:27:17,890
uh, whatever you called it...
dimensions?

1113
01:27:17,967 --> 01:27:21,232
It's just too stressful.
You said that yourself.

1114
01:27:21,303 --> 01:27:23,771
It's very confusing. You don't know
what's real and what's not.

1115
01:27:23,839 --> 01:27:28,902
But you know what's real now.
- Yes, sir. I do.

1116
01:27:28,978 --> 01:27:33,711
No, no. I don't know anything about...

1117
01:27:33,783 --> 01:27:36,547
a monkey army, Doctor.

1118
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:39,315
No, no.
Nothing whatsoever.

1119
01:27:39,388 --> 01:27:44,587
Good Lord, if my son was ever involved
in something like that...

1120
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:48,027
Yeah? Well, I'm sorry.

1121
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:52,033
I think it's
doubly inappropriate to discuss...

1122
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:56,299
security matters with you,
Doctor, uh, Railly.

1123
01:27:56,372 --> 01:28:00,001
But, uh, if it will ease
your mind,

1124
01:28:00,076 --> 01:28:04,911
rest assured that neither my son
nor any other unauthorized person...

1125
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:09,974
has access to potentially dangerous
organisms in my laboratory.

1126
01:28:10,052 --> 01:28:14,182
Is that clear to you now?
Thank you so much for your concern.

1127
01:28:18,761 --> 01:28:21,628
Women psychiatrists!

1128
01:28:24,266 --> 01:28:27,497
I attended a lecture of hers once.

1129
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:31,131
"Apocalyptic Visions."

1130
01:28:31,207 --> 01:28:34,438
Yes. She was suddenly struck...

1131
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:38,469
by the most preposterous notion
about Jeffrey.

1132
01:28:40,082 --> 01:28:43,483
Has she succumbed to her own...

1133
01:28:43,552 --> 01:28:47,386
"theoretical" Cassandra disease?

1134
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:54,152
Maybe we ought to review
our security procedures.

1135
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:57,666
Yeah. Perhaps upgrade 'em,
you know?

1136
01:28:57,733 --> 01:29:00,031
Beef 'em up, hmm?

1137
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:07,202
Let's consider again
our current information.

1138
01:29:07,276 --> 01:29:10,404
If the symptoms were first detected
in Philadelphia...

1139
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:14,210
on December 27, 1996,
that makes us know that...

1140
01:29:14,283 --> 01:29:17,844
It was released in Philadelphia,
probably on December 13, 1996.

1141
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:21,913
And was seen sequentially
after that in...

1142
01:29:21,991 --> 01:29:23,856
San Francisco, New Orleans,

1143
01:29:23,926 --> 01:29:26,417
Rio de Janeiro, uh,

1144
01:29:26,495 --> 01:29:29,157
Rome, Kinshasa,

1145
01:29:29,231 --> 01:29:31,324
Karachi, Bangkok,
then Peking.

1146
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:36,829
That was very well done, Cole.

1147
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:45,547
Hello!

1148
01:29:45,614 --> 01:29:50,074
Is somebody in there? If you're
in there, I have to talk to you.

1149
01:29:50,152 --> 01:29:52,985
- It's the kidnap woman.
- Hello?

1150
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:55,285
The one who was with the guy
who tied us up.

1151
01:29:55,357 --> 01:29:58,087
- I have to talk.
- Turn off the lights. Turn off the light!

1152
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:01,254
- What's she doin'?
- She's drawing attention to us, that's what.

1153
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:06,063
I don't know what you're up to this time,
Goines, but you're gonna get us in deep shit.

1154
01:30:06,135 --> 01:30:09,263
- Walkies ready? Batteries charged?
- Mmm.

1155
01:30:09,338 --> 01:30:12,796
I saw you!
I saw somebody in there!

1156
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:15,275
- Come on.
Secret experiments.

1157
01:30:15,344 --> 01:30:17,539
That's what they do.

1158
01:30:17,613 --> 01:30:21,014
Secret weird stuff.

1159
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:23,984
- Not just on animals.
- I know you.

1160
01:30:24,053 --> 01:30:27,454
- Do 'em on people too, down at...
- Have you seen James Cole?

1161
01:30:27,523 --> 01:30:29,923
- The man who...
- They're watching you.

1162
01:30:29,992 --> 01:30:31,960
- Takin' pictures.
- The police.

1163
01:30:32,027 --> 01:30:34,120
I know. Look.

1164
01:30:34,196 --> 01:30:38,656
I have to contact James.

1165
01:30:38,734 --> 01:30:42,500
It's very, very important that he's
really careful when he reaches me.

1166
01:30:42,571 --> 01:30:46,337
- Do you understand that? Good.
- Yeah. Yeah. Who's James?

1167
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:50,435
He was with me.
He spoke to you... several weeks ago.

1168
01:30:50,512 --> 01:30:54,573
He said that you were from the future
and that you were watching him.

1169
01:31:01,657 --> 01:31:03,591
Bolt cutters.
Bolt cutters.

1170
01:31:03,659 --> 01:31:06,992
- Did you get bolt cutters?
- One dozen. They're in the van.

1171
01:31:07,062 --> 01:31:09,292
- Got the plans for the security system?
- Right here.

1172
01:31:09,365 --> 01:31:11,993
- Committed to memory.
- Hey! Hey!

1173
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:15,036
- You know what she's doin' out there?
- What's it say?

1174
01:31:15,104 --> 01:31:20,599
- I don't know. I can't see it.
- Forget about my psychiatrist and concentrate on the task at hand.

1175
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:23,935
Your psychiatrist?

1176
01:31:24,013 --> 01:31:28,541
- Did you just say your psychiatrist?
- Ex-psychiatrist.

1177
01:31:28,617 --> 01:31:32,644
This woman was your psychiatrist, and
now she's spray-painting our building?

1178
01:31:40,362 --> 01:31:42,455
What's it say?

1179
01:31:45,267 --> 01:31:47,201
Kathryn!

1180
01:31:47,269 --> 01:31:49,169
James?

1181
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,031
James!

1182
01:31:53,909 --> 01:31:56,139
- James.
- What? What?

1183
01:31:56,211 --> 01:31:59,544
- There's a policeman over there. Pretend you don't know me.
- No. I want to turn myself in.

1184
01:31:59,615 --> 01:32:02,607
- Where is he? Where is he?
- James! Down!

1185
01:32:02,685 --> 01:32:06,348
- Come on.
- No, no. It's okay. I'm not crazy anymore.

1186
01:32:06,422 --> 01:32:10,518
I mean, I am. I'm mentally
divergent. I know that now.

1187
01:32:10,592 --> 01:32:13,584
I want you to help me.
I want to get better.

1188
01:32:13,662 --> 01:32:15,630
James!

1189
01:32:17,466 --> 01:32:19,434
Let's get outta here.

1190
01:32:19,501 --> 01:32:21,401
He's goin'.
He's goin'.

1191
01:32:33,115 --> 01:32:35,675
- I've seen that before.
- No, James, you haven't.

1192
01:32:39,288 --> 01:32:42,485
A guy in a Ford is chasing her
and some other guy I can't see.

1193
01:32:42,558 --> 01:32:45,857
No problem. It's probably
just another kidnapping...

1194
01:32:45,928 --> 01:32:48,123
featuring Jeffrey's shrink.

1195
01:32:48,197 --> 01:32:51,325
Pardon me.
Make that ex-shrink.

1196
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,493
This is your leader?

1197
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:55,503
A certifiable lunatic...

1198
01:32:55,571 --> 01:33:00,099
who told his former psychiatrist all his plans
for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes?

1199
01:33:00,175 --> 01:33:02,268
God knows what she's written
on that wall!

1200
01:33:02,344 --> 01:33:05,313
Who cares what psychiatrists
write on walls?

1201
01:33:05,381 --> 01:33:08,282
You think I told her about
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, huh?

1202
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:11,319
Impossible! Do you know why?
Do you know why?

1203
01:33:11,387 --> 01:33:16,723
Because, you pathetically ineffectual and
pusillanimous pretend friend to animals,

1204
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:20,193
I'll tell you why. Because when I had
anything to do with her six years ago,

1205
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:22,492
there was no such thing,
I hadn't thought of it yet.

1206
01:33:22,564 --> 01:33:27,900
- Then how come she knows what's goin' on?
- Here's my theory on that.

1207
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:32,771
When I was institutionalized, my brain was studied
inexhaustibly in the guise of mental health.

1208
01:33:32,841 --> 01:33:35,969
I was interrogated, x-rayed.
I was examined thoroughly.

1209
01:33:38,046 --> 01:33:43,074
They took everything about me and put it into a
computer where they created a model of my mind.

1210
01:33:43,152 --> 01:33:45,450
Yes! Using that model,

1211
01:33:45,521 --> 01:33:50,220
they managed to generate every thought I
could possibly have in the next ten years,

1212
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:54,490
which they then filtered through
a probability matrix of some kind...

1213
01:33:54,563 --> 01:33:58,158
to determine everything
I was gonna do in that period.

1214
01:33:58,233 --> 01:34:03,796
So you see, she knew I was gonna lead the
Army of the Twelve Monkeys into history...

1215
01:34:03,872 --> 01:34:05,806
before it even occurred to me.

1216
01:34:05,874 --> 01:34:08,934
She knows everything I'm ever gonna do
before I know it myself.

1217
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:11,002
How's that?

1218
01:34:12,781 --> 01:34:15,909
Kweskin, you finish here.
I'll meet you there.

1219
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:19,442
And if you forget one thing, I will have
you shaved, sterilized and destroyed.

1220
01:34:19,521 --> 01:34:21,455
- Jeff?
- What?

1221
01:34:21,523 --> 01:34:24,117
You're a great man.

1222
01:34:24,193 --> 01:34:26,684
Ahh, fuck the bozos!

1223
01:34:27,963 --> 01:34:31,660
He's seriously crazy.

1224
01:34:31,733 --> 01:34:33,758
You know that.

1225
01:34:35,384 --> 01:34:38,217
On the lookout for...

1226
01:34:38,286 --> 01:34:41,449
The name is Cole.

1227
01:35:02,677 --> 01:35:04,542
There. Over there.

1228
01:35:04,612 --> 01:35:07,080
Okay. Come on.

1229
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:20,559
- I need a room.
- Thirty-five bucks an hour.

1230
01:35:20,628 --> 01:35:26,396
- An hour?
- You want quarter hours? Go someplace else.

1231
01:35:34,642 --> 01:35:37,338
Uh, here's...

1232
01:35:37,411 --> 01:35:40,278
twenty-five, six, seven
for an hour.

1233
01:35:40,348 --> 01:35:45,615
- Deal?
- Hey! Turn it off!

1234
01:35:47,054 --> 01:35:50,023
One hour, honey babe.
Number sixty-four.

1235
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:53,060
Sixth floor.
Up the stairs, end of the hall.

1236
01:35:53,127 --> 01:35:55,652
Elevator's busted.

1237
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:57,664
She's not honey babe.

1238
01:35:57,732 --> 01:36:01,395
She's a doctor.
My psychiatrist.

1239
01:36:01,469 --> 01:36:03,232
Understand?

1240
01:36:05,339 --> 01:36:08,274
Whatever gets it up for you, Jack.

1241
01:36:16,717 --> 01:36:19,584
Tommy, this is Charlie
over at the Globe.

1242
01:36:19,654 --> 01:36:22,885
You know if Wallace has a new girl?

1243
01:36:22,957 --> 01:36:27,326
Sort of a rookie type?
A little weird? Does fantasy acts?

1244
01:36:27,395 --> 01:36:31,161
Okay, you were standing there
looking up at the moon.

1245
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:34,326
You were splashing
through the water, and then what?

1246
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:38,197
I thought I was
in prison again.

1247
01:36:38,272 --> 01:36:40,832
Just like that,
you were in prison?

1248
01:36:40,908 --> 01:36:43,035
No, not really.

1249
01:36:43,110 --> 01:36:46,136
Like you said.
It was all in my mind.

1250
01:36:46,213 --> 01:36:49,478
You disappeared.

1251
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:53,008
One minute you were there,
the next minute you were gone.

1252
01:36:53,087 --> 01:36:55,453
Did you run through
the woods, or...

1253
01:36:55,523 --> 01:36:59,391
I don't know.
I don't remember.

1254
01:37:00,962 --> 01:37:04,398
The boy in the well.
How did you know that was just a hoax?

1255
01:37:04,465 --> 01:37:08,902
It was?
I d-didn't know.

1256
01:37:08,970 --> 01:37:10,699
You said he was hiding
in the barn!

1257
01:37:10,771 --> 01:37:13,740
I think I maybe saw a TV show
about that when I was a kid,

1258
01:37:13,808 --> 01:37:15,332
where a boy...

1259
01:37:15,409 --> 01:37:17,400
It wasn't a TV show!
It was real!

1260
01:37:17,478 --> 01:37:20,641
M-Maybe this boy saw
the same TV show that I did,

1261
01:37:20,715 --> 01:37:23,206
and he c-copied it.

1262
01:37:23,284 --> 01:37:26,412
Look, you were right.
I, I am mentally ill.

1263
01:37:26,487 --> 01:37:28,921
I imagined all these things,
these people.

1264
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:31,754
- Ooh.
- I know they're not real.

1265
01:37:31,826 --> 01:37:34,260
I can trick them. I, I...

1266
01:37:34,328 --> 01:37:36,728
I can make them do what I want.
I worked on 'em a little bit.

1267
01:37:36,797 --> 01:37:39,027
- I got back here to get better.
- Ah!

1268
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:43,332
- I can stay here.
- What does this mean to you?

1269
01:37:51,712 --> 01:37:56,911
- I think I had a dream
like... about this.

1270
01:37:56,984 --> 01:38:00,920
You had a bullet from World War I in
your leg, James. How did it get there?

1271
01:38:00,988 --> 01:38:03,149
I don't know. Look, you sa...
You said I had delusions.

1272
01:38:03,224 --> 01:38:08,457
- That I created this world. You said you could explain.
- I can't!

1273
01:38:08,529 --> 01:38:11,362
I'm trying to, and...

1274
01:38:11,432 --> 01:38:15,368
I, I can't believe that everything
we say or do has already happened.

1275
01:38:15,436 --> 01:38:18,564
We can't change
what's gonna happen.

1276
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:22,541
And if five billion people
are gonna die, it's...

1277
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:26,808
I want the future
to be unknown.

1278
01:38:28,282 --> 01:38:31,877
I want to become
a whole person again.

1279
01:38:31,952 --> 01:38:35,388
I want this to be
the present.

1280
01:38:35,456 --> 01:38:38,892
I want to stay here...
this time...

1281
01:38:38,959 --> 01:38:40,927
with you.

1282
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:09,819
James,

1283
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:14,691
do you remember six years ago
you had a phone number?

1284
01:39:14,762 --> 01:39:17,492
- It was the wrong number then.
- A woman answered.

1285
01:39:17,565 --> 01:39:21,865
It was the wrong number in 1990.
It should be the right number now.

1286
01:39:21,936 --> 01:39:24,029
Do you remember it?

1287
01:39:24,105 --> 01:39:26,170
The number? Do you...

1288
01:39:30,344 --> 01:39:34,440
This is my territory, bitch!

1289
01:39:34,515 --> 01:39:39,111
- Is this real, or is this one of my delusions?
- This is definitely real.

1290
01:39:39,186 --> 01:39:41,154
Uh, excuse me.

1291
01:39:41,222 --> 01:39:46,125
- I, I think we've got a little misunderstanding here.
- Oh?

1292
01:39:46,193 --> 01:39:49,185
- Yeah. We...
- Gee, really?

1293
01:39:49,263 --> 01:39:52,027
Now, you just sit tight!

1294
01:39:52,099 --> 01:39:55,500
You listen to me,
little Miss Understanding.

1295
01:39:55,569 --> 01:39:58,868
You think you can go around me and
peddle your ass in this part of town?

1296
01:39:58,939 --> 01:40:03,399
You bet your life we got what I would
call a major fuckin' misunderstanding.

1297
01:40:03,477 --> 01:40:05,945
Hey!

1298
01:40:06,781 --> 01:40:10,547
James, no! Don't!

1299
01:40:10,618 --> 01:40:15,715
- Uh, put him in the closet. Take his money first!
- You want me to rob him?

1300
01:40:15,790 --> 01:40:18,850
- We need cash, James!
- No, no!

1301
01:40:18,926 --> 01:40:22,327
Call the cops!
Call the cops!

1302
01:40:22,396 --> 01:40:25,160
What's goin' on?

1303
01:40:25,232 --> 01:40:27,598
I've got friends, man.

1304
01:40:27,668 --> 01:40:30,102
- Don't fuckin' kill me.
- James! James!

1305
01:40:30,171 --> 01:40:32,605
No, James! No!

1306
01:40:32,673 --> 01:40:34,538
No, James!

1307
01:40:34,608 --> 01:40:36,371
No! Open the door!

1308
01:40:36,443 --> 01:40:39,173
What the fuck are you doin'?

1309
01:40:39,246 --> 01:40:42,613
Please don't hurt him.
Open the door.

1310
01:40:42,683 --> 01:40:45,709
James, come on.

1311
01:40:52,026 --> 01:40:53,994
Just in case...

1312
01:40:54,061 --> 01:40:58,054
Just in case I'm not crazy.
This is how they find us.

1313
01:40:58,132 --> 01:41:01,101
By our teeth.

1314
01:41:01,168 --> 01:41:04,865
I don't want them
to find me... ever.

1315
01:41:04,939 --> 01:41:07,373
I don't want to go back.

1316
01:41:07,441 --> 01:41:10,968
...calling in a domestic incident.
- Get out!

1317
01:41:14,515 --> 01:41:18,212
Get back.
You'd better load.

1318
01:41:19,854 --> 01:41:24,723
Police! Throw your weapons out
and come on out!

1319
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:32,661
Hey! Is that the cops?

1320
01:41:32,733 --> 01:41:35,429
Hey, I'm the innocent victim here.

1321
01:41:35,502 --> 01:41:40,462
I was attacked by a coked-up whore
and a, a fuckin' crazy dentist.

1322
01:41:53,654 --> 01:41:55,588
Try to blend in.

1323
01:41:55,656 --> 01:41:59,023
Oh, Jesus!
Come on.

1324
01:42:00,561 --> 01:42:03,792
There's gotta be a phone
around here somewhere.

1325
01:42:03,864 --> 01:42:06,196
There.
O-Over there. Look.

1326
01:42:06,267 --> 01:42:09,134
- I'm gonna try that number, okay?
- Okay.

1327
01:42:09,203 --> 01:42:12,138
- Let's hope it's nothing.
- Okay.

1328
01:42:37,464 --> 01:42:41,025
James! James!
It's okay!

1329
01:42:41,101 --> 01:42:44,002
We're insane. We're crazy.
It's a carpet cleaning company.

1330
01:42:44,071 --> 01:42:47,165
- A carpet cleaning company?
- Yeah. No superiors.

1331
01:42:47,241 --> 01:42:49,766
No scientists.
No men from the future.

1332
01:42:49,843 --> 01:42:52,835
It's just a carpet cleaning company.
They have voice mail.

1333
01:42:52,913 --> 01:42:55,905
You leave a message telling
where you want your carpet cleaned.

1334
01:42:55,983 --> 01:42:58,611
- You left them a message?
- Yeah. I couldn't resist.

1335
01:42:58,686 --> 01:43:03,988
Wait 'til they hear this nutty woman telling
them to watch for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

1336
01:43:04,058 --> 01:43:07,926
I said, "The Freedom for Animals
Association on Second Avenue...

1337
01:43:07,995 --> 01:43:11,829
...is the secret headquarters
of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys."

1338
01:43:11,899 --> 01:43:14,424
They're the ones
who are gonna do it.

1339
01:43:14,501 --> 01:43:17,402
I can't do anything more now.
I have to go.

1340
01:43:17,471 --> 01:43:19,939
Have a merry Christmas."

1341
01:43:24,545 --> 01:43:27,207
You couldn't have heard me.
I...

1342
01:43:31,518 --> 01:43:35,113
They got your message, Kathryn.

1343
01:43:35,189 --> 01:43:38,056
They played it for me.

1344
01:43:38,125 --> 01:43:43,188
It was a bad recording,
distorted.

1345
01:43:43,263 --> 01:43:46,198
I didn't recognize your voice.

1346
01:44:08,756 --> 01:44:13,523
For the perfect Christmas gift...
- Mmm, and this.

1347
01:44:13,594 --> 01:44:17,655
Is everything okay?
You want anything?

1348
01:44:20,901 --> 01:44:22,835
Shall I
put this on your account, ma'am?

1349
01:44:22,903 --> 01:44:26,532
No. That'll be cash.

1350
01:44:26,607 --> 01:44:28,575
Uh...

1351
01:44:29,743 --> 01:44:33,338
Can you tell me what floor
the wigs are on?

1352
01:44:41,121 --> 01:44:45,558
You turned the thing
into a fucking computer.

1353
01:44:45,626 --> 01:44:47,821
- And Fale believed it.
- You know Fale.

1354
01:44:47,895 --> 01:44:52,093
If you guys get nailed,
which I'm pretty sure you will,

1355
01:44:52,166 --> 01:44:56,694
I've never seen you before
in my fuckin' life.

1356
01:44:56,770 --> 01:44:59,364
- Aha!
- Yeah!

1357
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,772
C'mon, c'mon.

1358
01:45:01,842 --> 01:45:04,242
Bring 'im through.
C'mon.

1359
01:45:05,946 --> 01:45:07,880
Okay, drive!

1360
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:16,120
What's the harm in openin'
the bag? His eyes are taped, right?

1361
01:45:17,224 --> 01:45:19,192
Right?

1362
01:45:21,595 --> 01:45:23,529
Okay. Okay.

1363
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,291
Hello. Hello.

1364
01:45:29,736 --> 01:45:32,830
- Wanna hear the monkey speak?
- Yeah!

1365
01:45:32,906 --> 01:45:36,740
Ahh! Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, I know that's you.

1366
01:45:36,810 --> 01:45:39,142
- I recognize your voice.
- No, you don't.

1367
01:45:39,213 --> 01:45:42,808
I also know all about
your warped little plan.

1368
01:45:42,883 --> 01:45:47,343
That lady, your psychiatrist?
She told me. I didn't believe her.

1369
01:45:47,421 --> 01:45:50,788
It just seemed too crazy,
even for you.

1370
01:45:50,858 --> 01:45:55,727
But just in case, I took steps to make
sure you couldn't go through with it.

1371
01:45:55,796 --> 01:45:59,095
I don't have the code anymore,
Jeffrey.

1372
01:45:59,166 --> 01:46:01,327
I don't have access
to the virus.

1373
01:46:01,401 --> 01:46:03,528
I took myself...

1374
01:46:03,604 --> 01:46:07,631
- out of the loop.
- Too late! Too late!

1375
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:11,235
We've got plans for you, Dad.

1376
01:46:11,311 --> 01:46:14,280
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!
Agh! Agh! Agh!

1377
01:46:17,684 --> 01:46:22,144
I never let myself believe it.
Now I know it's true.

1378
01:46:22,222 --> 01:46:24,122
- Jeffrey?
- Hmm?

1379
01:46:24,191 --> 01:46:26,751
You're completely insane.

1380
01:46:30,931 --> 01:46:33,627
No, I'm not.

1381
01:46:37,004 --> 01:46:41,065
There's a cross section of one
of the old trees that's been cut down.

1382
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:52,480
Here I was born.

1383
01:46:53,453 --> 01:46:56,217
And there I died.

1384
01:46:56,290 --> 01:46:59,123
It was only a moment for you.

1385
01:46:59,193 --> 01:47:01,957
Y-You took no notice.

1386
01:47:05,499 --> 01:47:08,297
- I think I've seen this movie before.
- Shh.

1387
01:47:08,368 --> 01:47:12,202
- When I was a kid, I saw it on TV.
- Don't talk.

1388
01:47:12,272 --> 01:47:15,173
- I did see it before.
- Tall trees.

1389
01:47:15,242 --> 01:47:17,142
Have you been here before?

1390
01:47:17,211 --> 01:47:18,803
- Yes.
- When?

1391
01:47:18,879 --> 01:47:23,816
- I don't... recognize this.
- When were you born?

1392
01:47:23,884 --> 01:47:25,818
- Long ago.
- Where?

1393
01:47:25,886 --> 01:47:27,581
What's the matter?

1394
01:47:27,654 --> 01:47:29,918
- Tell me. Madeleine, tell me.
- No!

1395
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:33,221
It's just like
what's happening with us.

1396
01:47:33,293 --> 01:47:36,456
Like the past.

1397
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:40,227
The movie never changes.
It can't change.

1398
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:43,701
But every time you see it, it seems
different because you're different.

1399
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:48,002
- You see different things.
- Please don't ask me.

1400
01:47:48,075 --> 01:47:50,839
If you can't change anything
because it's already happened,

1401
01:47:50,911 --> 01:47:53,141
you may as well
smell the flowers.

1402
01:47:53,213 --> 01:47:54,874
What flowers?

1403
01:47:54,948 --> 01:47:58,475
- That's an expression.
- Shh.

1404
01:47:58,552 --> 01:48:02,318
Promise me
you won't ask me again. Please?

1405
01:48:03,991 --> 01:48:06,050
Kathryn,

1406
01:48:11,665 --> 01:48:14,225
why are you doing this?

1407
01:48:16,003 --> 01:48:17,937
I want to know why.

1408
01:48:18,005 --> 01:48:20,838
What if I'm wrong?
What if you're wrong?

1409
01:48:20,907 --> 01:48:23,000
What if I am crazy?

1410
01:48:23,076 --> 01:48:26,842
In a few weeks,
it will have started or it won't.

1411
01:48:26,913 --> 01:48:30,405
If there's still...

1412
01:48:30,484 --> 01:48:35,251
football games, traffic jams,
TV shows and armed robberies,

1413
01:48:35,322 --> 01:48:39,383
we're going to be so glad that we'll
be thrilled to see the police.

1414
01:48:39,459 --> 01:48:41,359
I'm responsible for you now.

1415
01:48:41,428 --> 01:48:44,522
- The Chinese say once you've saved a person's life,
- Shh.

1416
01:48:44,598 --> 01:48:48,227
- you're responsible for it forever, so I'm committed.
- Do you have a plan?

1417
01:48:48,302 --> 01:48:50,361
I have to know.

1418
01:48:50,437 --> 01:48:54,396
There's so little that I know.

1419
01:48:54,474 --> 01:48:57,375
You said you'd never seen the ocean.

1420
01:48:57,444 --> 01:49:00,811
Hurry up. Come on.

1421
01:49:00,881 --> 01:49:04,476
What?

1422
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:16,361
Jeffrey? You know I can't see.

1423
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:19,456
Where are we?
Jeffrey? Please.

1424
01:49:36,383 --> 01:49:38,408
Kathryn?

1425
01:49:46,059 --> 01:49:48,960
We have 9:30 reservations
for Key West.

1426
01:50:02,008 --> 01:50:06,240
I, uh...
just didn't recognize you.

1427
01:50:06,313 --> 01:50:10,943
Well, you look pretty different
yourself.

1428
01:50:12,819 --> 01:50:15,913
It was always you.

1429
01:50:15,989 --> 01:50:19,789
In my dream.
It was al...

1430
01:50:21,895 --> 01:50:24,728
It was always you.

1431
01:50:27,033 --> 01:50:29,365
I remember you like this.

1432
01:50:29,436 --> 01:50:31,267
You do?

1433
01:50:31,338 --> 01:50:35,172
I felt I've known you before.

1434
01:50:37,144 --> 01:50:40,409
I feel I've always known you.

1435
01:50:51,191 --> 01:50:54,285
I'm so scared.

1436
01:51:26,793 --> 01:51:28,818
What time's your flight?

1437
01:51:28,895 --> 01:51:31,261
- 9:30.
- Might be tight.

1438
01:51:31,331 --> 01:51:34,926
Tight? No.
My watch says 7:30.

1439
01:51:35,001 --> 01:51:38,562
On your normal mornin', okay.
Plenty of time.

1440
01:51:38,638 --> 01:51:42,631
But today you gotta take into account
your Army of the Twelve Monkeys factor.

1441
01:51:42,709 --> 01:51:45,507
What? What'd you say?

1442
01:51:45,579 --> 01:51:50,107
Twelve Monkeys. In case you folks
didn't turn on your radio this mornin'.

1443
01:51:50,183 --> 01:51:53,778
Bunch of weirdos let all
of the animals out of the zoo.

1444
01:51:53,854 --> 01:51:56,550
They locked up this big-shot scientist
in one of the cages.

1445
01:51:56,623 --> 01:51:59,251
Scientist's own kid
one of the ones did it.

1446
01:51:59,326 --> 01:52:03,023
They've got animals
all over the place.

1447
01:52:03,096 --> 01:52:05,963
Bunch of zebras closed down
the thruway 'bout an hour ago.

1448
01:52:06,032 --> 01:52:08,364
And they got some thing
called an emu.

1449
01:52:08,435 --> 01:52:12,531
It's got traffic blocked
for miles on 676.

1450
01:52:12,606 --> 01:52:15,905
...what they think they're accomplishing
by releasing an animal like this...

1451
01:52:15,976 --> 01:52:18,103
- into a city like this one.
- Oh.

1452
01:52:18,178 --> 01:52:21,944
- That's what they were up to, freeing animals.
- On the walls.

1453
01:52:22,015 --> 01:52:25,109
- It said, "We did it." They meant the animals.
- The animals, yeah.

1454
01:52:25,185 --> 01:52:28,985
If I could interrupt
for a moment, Mr. Ginger...

1455
01:52:29,055 --> 01:52:33,321
- There is going to be
a press conference from City Hall.

1456
01:52:33,393 --> 01:52:36,920
I think it's gonna be all right.

1457
01:52:40,166 --> 01:52:44,125
Tell your people if they spot either one
of them, not to try and apprehend them.

1458
01:52:44,204 --> 01:52:48,834
They should notify us. We have people all
over the airport. We'll take care of 'em.

1459
01:52:52,579 --> 01:52:55,878
Skycap to gate 47, please.

1460
01:53:02,989 --> 01:53:07,926
...for Chicago
is now ready for boarding at gate 17.

1461
01:53:09,829 --> 01:53:13,663
Flight 623 to Minneapolis
is now boarding at gate...

1462
01:53:13,733 --> 01:53:17,430
- I know this place.
- Airports all look the same.

1463
01:53:17,504 --> 01:53:20,473
This is my dream.

1464
01:53:23,109 --> 01:53:26,203
Your mustache.

1465
01:53:26,279 --> 01:53:29,510
It's not just my dream.

1466
01:53:29,583 --> 01:53:32,051
I was actually here.
I remember now.

1467
01:53:32,118 --> 01:53:37,988
I... About a week or two before the...
before everyone started dying.

1468
01:53:38,058 --> 01:53:40,458
Oh. Uh, careful.

1469
01:53:40,527 --> 01:53:43,052
They might be looking for us.

1470
01:53:43,129 --> 01:53:47,862
- I was here... as a kid.
- Use this.

1471
01:53:47,934 --> 01:53:50,232
- I think you were here then too.
- James!

1472
01:53:50,303 --> 01:53:53,830
If they identify us,
they're going to send us someplace,

1473
01:53:53,907 --> 01:53:57,138
but it won't be Key West.

1474
01:53:57,210 --> 01:53:59,838
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1475
01:53:59,913 --> 01:54:02,245
- I'll go fix this.
- Okay.

1476
01:54:02,315 --> 01:54:05,716
I'm gonna get the tickets.
I'll meet you in the newspaper stand.

1477
01:54:05,785 --> 01:54:08,481
- Okay.
- Okay.

1478
01:54:13,259 --> 01:54:17,093
This is a general
information announcement.

1479
01:54:17,163 --> 01:54:20,826
- Judy Simmons. I have reservations for Key West.
- Okay.

1480
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:25,064
Flight 623 to Minneapolis...

1481
01:54:25,138 --> 01:54:28,266
is now boarding at gate 44.

1482
01:54:31,411 --> 01:54:35,370
- I don't see a lot of this. It's cash.
- It's a long story.

1483
01:54:35,448 --> 01:54:37,746
We'll begin boarding
in about 20 minutes.

1484
01:54:37,817 --> 01:54:41,719
- You have a nice flight, Miss Simmons.
- Thank you.

1485
01:54:44,858 --> 01:54:47,827
Hello. How are you today?

1486
01:54:49,529 --> 01:54:51,929
I don't know whether
you're there or not.

1487
01:54:51,998 --> 01:54:54,023
Maybe you just clean carpets.

1488
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:57,297
If you do, you're lucky.
You're gonna live a long, happy life.

1489
01:54:57,370 --> 01:54:59,600
But if you other guys are out there,
if you're picking this up,

1490
01:54:59,673 --> 01:55:02,005
forget about
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

1491
01:55:02,075 --> 01:55:05,135
They didn't do it. It was a mistake.
Someone else did it.

1492
01:55:05,211 --> 01:55:09,580
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys is just a
bunch of dumb kids playin' revolutionaries.

1493
01:55:12,652 --> 01:55:17,146
Listen. I've done my job.
I did what you wanted.

1494
01:55:17,223 --> 01:55:19,657
Good luck.
I'm not coming back.

1495
01:55:19,726 --> 01:55:23,162
Whoo-ee!
San Francisco, New Orleans,

1496
01:55:23,229 --> 01:55:26,255
Rio de Janeiro, Rome,

1497
01:55:26,332 --> 01:55:29,597
Kinshasa, Karachi,
Bangkok and Peking.

1498
01:55:29,669 --> 01:55:32,968
This is some trip you're taking, sir.
Is this all in one week?

1499
01:55:33,039 --> 01:55:35,439
- Business.
- Hmm.

1500
01:55:36,276 --> 01:55:38,642
Have a good one, sir.

1501
01:55:41,981 --> 01:55:46,884
Any luggage found unattended
will be removed and destroyed.

1502
01:55:52,792 --> 01:55:56,284
Got yourself a prob, Bob?

1503
01:55:56,362 --> 01:55:58,330
Leave me alone!

1504
01:55:58,398 --> 01:56:03,165
- I made a report. I didn't have to do that.
- Point of fact.

1505
01:56:03,236 --> 01:56:05,830
You don't belong here.

1506
01:56:05,905 --> 01:56:09,102
It's not permitted
to let you stay.

1507
01:56:09,175 --> 01:56:11,473
This is the present.

1508
01:56:11,544 --> 01:56:14,479
This is not the past.
This is not the future.

1509
01:56:14,547 --> 01:56:19,109
This is right now!
I'm not leaving'! Get that?

1510
01:56:19,185 --> 01:56:21,847
You can't stop me.

1511
01:56:21,921 --> 01:56:25,254
Anything you say, Chief.
It's none of my business.

1512
01:56:30,597 --> 01:56:33,327
Passengers for flight...

1513
01:56:34,968 --> 01:56:37,801
- Hey, Cole.
- Leave me alone!

1514
01:56:37,871 --> 01:56:41,637
Calm down, Cole. It's me.
Cole, it's me.

1515
01:56:43,076 --> 01:56:47,445
- Jose?
- Yeah, right. Jose.

1516
01:56:47,514 --> 01:56:51,075
Why'd you pull out the tooth?
That was nuts.

1517
01:56:51,151 --> 01:56:54,143
- Here, take this.
- What? What for? Are you crazy?

1518
01:56:54,220 --> 01:56:59,385
Me? Are you kidding?
You're the one. You're a hero, man.

1519
01:56:59,459 --> 01:57:02,485
They gave you a pardon. What do you do?
You come back and fuck with your teeth.

1520
01:57:02,562 --> 01:57:05,895
- How did you find me?
- The phone call, man.

1521
01:57:05,965 --> 01:57:08,263
They did their
reconstruction thing on it.

1522
01:57:08,334 --> 01:57:12,532
The phone?
The phone call I just made?

1523
01:57:12,605 --> 01:57:15,005
- Five minutes ago.
- Yeah, five minutes ago.

1524
01:57:15,074 --> 01:57:17,702
Thirty years ago.
They just put it together.

1525
01:57:17,777 --> 01:57:20,007
"Uh, hey, this is Cole, James.

1526
01:57:20,079 --> 01:57:23,207
I don't know whether you're there
or not. Maybe you just clean carpets."

1527
01:57:23,283 --> 01:57:28,186
Where'd you get that from? "Forget
about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys."

1528
01:57:28,254 --> 01:57:31,087
Man, if only they could've
got your message earlier.

1529
01:57:31,157 --> 01:57:33,557
Take it. You could still be
a hero if you cooperate!

1530
01:57:35,061 --> 01:57:38,121
Come on, James.
It's okay.

1531
01:57:49,876 --> 01:57:54,245
- Here's your change. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1532
01:57:54,314 --> 01:57:57,374
- Sorry.
- No problem.

1533
01:58:00,987 --> 01:58:03,421
- Hi.
- Hi.

1534
01:58:03,489 --> 01:58:07,983
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is ready for boarding at gate 38.

1535
01:58:08,061 --> 01:58:12,259
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is ready for boarding...

1536
01:58:12,332 --> 01:58:14,664
Oh, my God!

1537
01:58:14,734 --> 01:58:18,761
I got orders. You know what I'm supposed
to do if you don't go along? Shoot the lady.

1538
01:58:18,838 --> 01:58:21,898
- What?
- You got that? They said, "If Cole don't obey..."

1539
01:58:21,975 --> 01:58:26,344
- I'll break your fuckin'...
You hear me?

1540
01:58:26,412 --> 01:58:29,677
Volunteers now boarding at gate 37.

1541
01:58:31,384 --> 01:58:33,784
You see?
I had no choice.

1542
01:58:33,853 --> 01:58:38,347
These are my orders, man.
Just take it. Take it!

1543
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:45,656
- This part isn't about
the virus at all, is it?

1544
01:58:45,732 --> 01:58:49,668
It's about followin' orders.
About doin' what you're told.

1545
01:58:49,736 --> 01:58:53,001
Hey, man. You got a pardon.
What do you want?

1546
01:58:53,072 --> 01:58:57,839
- Who am I supposed to shoot? Who am I supposed to shoot?
- James! James!

1547
01:58:57,911 --> 01:59:02,575
Dr. Goines's assistant. He's an
apocalypse nut. I think he's involved.

1548
01:59:02,649 --> 01:59:04,913
The next flight to San Francisco
leaves from gate 38.

1549
01:59:04,984 --> 01:59:06,975
If he's there,
I'm sure he's part of it.

1550
01:59:07,053 --> 01:59:12,719
...please go to gate 13.

1551
01:59:16,596 --> 01:59:20,692
Mr. Holtz, you wanna have
a look at this, please?

1552
01:59:20,767 --> 01:59:23,201
Excuse me, sir.
Would you mind...

1553
01:59:23,269 --> 01:59:26,136
- letting me have a look at the contents of your bag?
- Me?

1554
01:59:26,205 --> 01:59:28,298
We don't have time for this.

1555
01:59:28,374 --> 01:59:30,865
Excuse me.

1556
01:59:34,847 --> 01:59:37,873
Biological samples.

1557
01:59:37,951 --> 01:59:41,011
- I have the papers right here.
- Yeah.

1558
01:59:41,087 --> 01:59:44,818
I'm gonna have to ask you
to open this up, sir.

1559
01:59:44,891 --> 01:59:46,916
Open it?

1560
01:59:46,993 --> 01:59:49,257
Why, yes, of course.

1561
01:59:49,329 --> 01:59:51,923
What could be better?
Look over here.

1562
01:59:51,998 --> 01:59:53,932
Look at the planes.
Hurry up.

1563
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,265
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am, you have to get in the line.

1564
01:59:57,337 --> 02:00:01,740
See? Biological.
Check the papers.

1565
02:00:01,808 --> 02:00:05,039
It's all proper.
I have a permit.

1566
02:00:10,283 --> 02:00:13,912
- It's empty.
- Well, yes, to be sure.

1567
02:00:13,987 --> 02:00:18,617
It looks empty;
but I assure you, it's not.

1568
02:00:18,691 --> 02:00:22,092
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't have to understand. You have to get in line.

1569
02:00:22,161 --> 02:00:24,925
This is very important. There's a man.
He's carrying a deadly virus.

1570
02:00:24,998 --> 02:00:29,935
There, you see?
Also invisible to the naked eye.

1571
02:00:31,904 --> 02:00:36,705
It doesn't...
even have an odor.

1572
02:00:36,776 --> 02:00:40,268
That's not necessary, sir.
There you go.

1573
02:00:40,346 --> 02:00:43,474
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a good flight.

1574
02:00:44,584 --> 02:00:46,518
Yeah.

1575
02:00:51,824 --> 02:00:55,282
- Who are you calling a moron?
- I am calling you a fucking moron!

1576
02:00:55,361 --> 02:00:57,556
- Fucking moron?
- Get your hands off her!

1577
02:00:58,698 --> 02:01:00,666
Hold it.

1578
02:01:00,733 --> 02:01:03,668
Wait a moment.

1579
02:01:10,309 --> 02:01:13,836
Fuckin' moron? You're not
gettin' through. Now get in the line!

1580
02:01:13,913 --> 02:01:16,074
I said stop!

1581
02:01:18,418 --> 02:01:21,512
There he is! That man!
He's carrying a deadly virus!

1582
02:01:21,587 --> 02:01:24,488
Stop him!
Somebody, please stop him!

1583
02:01:25,224 --> 02:01:27,818
Police Offi...

1584
02:01:33,132 --> 02:01:36,499
He's got a gun!

1585
02:01:43,376 --> 02:01:46,038
Watch it!

1586
02:01:51,384 --> 02:01:54,217
No!

1587
02:01:54,287 --> 02:01:57,688
Freeze!

1588
02:04:15,127 --> 02:04:17,061
Excuse me.

1589
02:04:17,129 --> 02:04:22,089
It's obscene,
all the violence, all the lunacy.

1590
02:04:22,168 --> 02:04:25,501
Shootings even at airports now.

1591
02:04:25,571 --> 02:04:29,234
You might say that we're
the next endangered species.

1592
02:04:29,308 --> 02:04:32,209
Human beings.

1593
02:04:32,278 --> 02:04:36,408
I think you're right, ma'am.

1594
02:04:37,717 --> 02:04:40,652
I think you've hit
the nail on the head.

1595
02:04:42,888 --> 02:04:45,448
Jones is my name.

1596
02:04:50,029 --> 02:04:52,520
I'm in insurance.
