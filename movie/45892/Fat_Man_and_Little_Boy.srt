1
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,654
At ease.

2
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,330
Move it, move it, move it!

3
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,268
One, two, three.

4
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,008
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

5
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:03,713
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
<i>Which nobody can deny! Hoorah!</i>

6
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,155
Boy, those Japs better watch out
for you, sir. Good luck.

7
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,727
The Corps of Engineers
is gonna miss you, sir.

8
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,592
- Thank you, gentlemen. Bronson.
- Sir.

9
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:16,060
I built this place,
so I'll be glad to eat it.

10
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,507
Well done, sir.

11
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,239
You're a lucky man.
Give those Japs hell.

12
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,310
Thank you, Thomas.

13
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,811
Indeed, I will.

14
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,815
Sir!

15
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,980
I'm losing my chance
to get out from behind a desk

16
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,117
- and lead men in combat!
- Colonel Groves, forget it. This has...

17
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,661
Even Bronson
wants to head for the front.

18
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,265
Forget about the front.
You're an engineer.

19
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,231
You're gonna fight your war here.

20
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:55,136
Is this what you're assigning me to,
this boondoggle? Dead end?

21
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,072
This dead end, Groves, has the
personal backing of the president.

22
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:02,180
This is not what I was promised,
not what I expected.

23
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,875
Then bone up on it.
Head to Chicago, talk to the scientist.

24
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,111
If it looks possible, run with it.

25
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:12,554
Take whoever you want. Have
whatever you need. Just make it work.

26
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,751
Who knows, you might just win
this war on your own.

27
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,557
Pick up a star on the way.

28
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,031
<i>...fighting for, and they are reported</i>
<i>to be giving the Germans hell.</i>

29
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:59,331
<i>Though these losses represent the</i>
<i>most serious setbacks for the Allies</i>

30
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,507
<i>in this war</i>
<i>against the Nazi enemy.</i>

31
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,838
<i>Bad news, too,</i>
<i>from the war in the Pacific.</i>

32
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:10,005
<i>We have just had confirmation of</i>
<i>the sinking of three US cruisers.</i>

33
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,016
<i>Names are being withheld.</i>
<i>The casualties are high.</i>

34
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,676
Come in!

35
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:19,257
<i>Reports of an early-morning raid</i>
<i>by Japanese dive-bombers...</i>

36
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,021
In here.
In here!

37
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,029
- Szard?
- Szilard.

38
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,965
General Groves, I was expecting you.
Come in! Come in!

39
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:44,012
Forgive me.
Sometimes I get stuck in here.

40
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,208
Metaphorically.

41
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,217
I've read this.

42
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,653
- Is it possible?
- You couldn't put a little more hot in,

43
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,485
could you?

44
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,899
And I'm not very good at fairy tales,
so just give me the happy ending.

45
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:13,109
What I wrote is possible,
probably inevitable.

46
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,414
Separate uranium 235,
then arrange for two portions

47
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:23,078
of the element to be brought together
suddenly, so that the resulting mass,

48
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,349
no bigger than this, general,

49
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:29,291
undergoes a spontaneous
self-generating reaction.

50
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:34,161
And if this was the epicenter
of that explosion...

51
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:39,970
...all of Chicago you could see
from here would disintegrate.

52
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,474
Hallelujah.

53
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:47,578
At the moment, all we have
are theories, concepts, inspirations,

54
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,183
- inconclusive results...
- Now, if we can make this device,

55
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,444
- so can the Krauts.
- Yes.

56
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,019
Germany has the scientific capability.

57
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,818
And, general,
we need leadership here.

58
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,516
- I can help!
- Thank you.

59
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,594
You need an ally, general!

60
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,836
- So tell us about this general.
- Why?

61
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,665
Because it's so mysterious.

62
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,242
''Meet me in the middle
of God-knows-where.

63
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:24,873
''Be there no earlier than 4:20,
no later than 4:29.''

64
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,042
Well, word has it

65
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,120
he's a provincial windbag

66
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,849
who's spent most of his life
digging holes in Latin America.

67
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,856
- Graves for the natives, no doubt.
- Oh, Frank.

68
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,861
Seriously, Kitty, after all,
Robert's a scientist.

69
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,159
If the Army wants him,
they'll want all of him.

70
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,099
All of him?
Why not take all of him?

71
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,273
Look, I have to at least hear
what he has to offer.

72
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,410
- Robert, must we go so fast?
- Yes!

73
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:55,511
- It's crazy.
- Yes! Yes!

74
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,822
This way, Dr. Oppenheimer.

75
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,374
Doctor!

76
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,212
Up here!

77
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,047
Groves, Leslie. Friends call me Dick.
Sit down.

78
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,084
Ingenuity.

79
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:46,493
I love it.
Created out of nothing but up here.

80
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,327
Clear!

81
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,470
The old man likes his privacy,
doesn't he?

82
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,763
Guess what.

83
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:23,834
- The egghead wants a carrot juice.
- Get him what he wants, Bronson!

84
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,264
Get used to it.

85
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,565
What an eight ball this guy is.

86
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,743
Seems this Oppenheimer's
a hot number.

87
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,211
Says here, he's got more damn brains
than are decent.

88
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:40,648
He knows it too. Temperamental. He
ain't gonna be an easy horse to corral.

89
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,017
Oh, I think the general
knows what he's doing.

90
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,254
Oppenheimer ain't one of us.

91
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,519
The general picks that guy,
he'll be making a mistake.

92
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:58,001
It needs to get pulled together.

93
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,435
So I think you're the man for the job.

94
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,309
And I got a weakness for good men.

95
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,245
The Krauts are working on this,
full bore.

96
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,755
If they get it before we do,
I don't have to spell it out.

97
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,951
Where would you start?

98
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,819
Focus.

99
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,664
You have great minds,
but all dancing to a different tune.

100
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,963
You bring them together in one place,
isolate them, no distractions.

101
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,731
You create an atmosphere
of creative stress.

102
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,001
Everyone competing
to solve one problem.

103
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,007
And you have one ringmaster.

104
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:45,313
Right now, it's all over the place.
You centralize everything.

105
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,418
There is a hitch.

106
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,045
There are people out there
don't like the color of your politics.

107
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,453
My politics...

108
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,526
...are an open book.

109
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,554
Well, I hope so.

110
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,634
You could win a war
and the Nobel Prize, God willing.

111
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,102
Sir, Major de Silva
wanted me to remind you

112
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,774
you've got a train to catch
at 1800 hours.

113
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,001
No rest for the wicked.

114
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,380
Oh, doctor.

115
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:22,819
If you take this on,
I say this in all humility, intellect...

116
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,556
...don't outrank that.

117
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,855
This general is a meatball,
a cipher.

118
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,125
He'd be eating out of the palm
of my hand in a week.

119
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,292
So will you accept?

120
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:44,202
There are questions.
There are a kaleidoscope of questions.

121
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,741
I see.

122
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:52,244
Well, I'm a star
at breakfast small talk.

123
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,684
You'll have to save some for evenings if
you're gonna be wife of the big cheese.

124
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,449
Would this mean moving?

125
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,055
Oh, you have to say yes.

126
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,720
You're too brilliant for Berkeley.

127
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:12,770
Michelangelo's <i>The Creation</i>
<i>of Adam</i>. Origin and destiny.

128
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,141
Origins and destiny.

129
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,710
The struggle to unearth the one
and to discover the other.

130
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,711
That is science!

131
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,181
And as I leave here
to unravel my own small destiny,

132
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,753
I congratulate each of you
on being the best of the best.

133
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,822
I have faith in you all.

134
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:36,451
God keep you, and may your lives
be rich and sweet.

135
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,688
- Thank you.
- We'll miss you, Oppie!

136
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,695
We'll miss you, Oppie!

137
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,834
Good luck, Oppie!

138
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:09,027
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!

139
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,393
Let's move that thing out back.

140
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,206
Sir!

141
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,976
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Give me the good news, Jack.

142
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,475
We've got utilities on
throughout camp.

143
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:04,605
We've got the sewage problem taken
care of. We have water throughout.

144
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,776
- Got the two science buildings...
- Not good enough.

145
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,217
We gotta be
a couple of weeks behind.

146
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,153
You know, I got a bunch
of scientists up there.

147
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,055
They're just wandering,
bumping into each other.

148
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,823
Get some bodies in here. In a week,
I wanna be two weeks ahead.

149
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,297
I don't think we have
accommodations, sir.

150
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,459
Why would they want
accommodations?

151
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,968
You think they'll sleep?

152
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,932
All right, get some tents,
but put it on your EOR.

153
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,377
Didn't I ask for dogs
around that perimeter fence?

154
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,242
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see any.

155
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,178
They're coming, general.

156
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,549
So...

157
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:51,823
...whatever goes on around here
is privileged information.

158
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:58,334
No exceptions. No wives, no barbers.
No exceptions!

159
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,006
What you see,

160
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:06,267
what you hear, what you read,
what you dream about,

161
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,446
whatever...

162
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,376
...gives you heartburn or feeds your
ulcers, whatever gives you the sweats,

163
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,316
keeps you up at night, whatever,

164
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,285
all of that...

165
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,950
...belongs to the United States Army.

166
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:28,156
Or to me, if that makes you feel
more comfortable.

167
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,631
Now, you gotta come down
out of the clouds, gentlemen,

168
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:37,070
and get into the business
of winning a war.

169
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:41,702
I'm gonna say it once.
I'm only gonna say it once.

170
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,372
Those of you who know, know.
Those of you who don't, don't.

171
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,511
You are not here to be comfortable.

172
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,881
All right?

173
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,190
You are here

174
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,060
to go beyond the theoretical,

175
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,098
the speculative, the fanciful.

176
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:11,675
You are here to harness
your God-given talents,

177
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,142
your minds, your energy,

178
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:18,773
in the practical pursuit of one thing:

179
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,311
A military weapon.

180
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,284
Nuclear one.

181
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,713
An atomic bomb.

182
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:30,658
Keep the muttering
to just a minimum, gentlemen.

183
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:34,555
Why bother with a bomb?
Why not just drop that man on Berlin?

184
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,930
- When you talk about it...
- It will have the same effect.

185
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:43,234
...it will be referred to as ''the gadget''
or ''the device''.

186
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,171
Is that clear?

187
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,470
There is one word
that I don't wanna hear.

188
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,147
And that's the word ''impossible''.

189
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,081
- You're two days late.
- I went to 109 East Palace Street

190
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,987
to report to Mrs. McKibben,
but there was nobody there.

191
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,564
So I hopped a construction bus, and it
damn near drove me back to Chicago.

192
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:11,965
I've been sitting on trains, buses,

193
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:16,504
railway stations for 60 hours.

194
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,044
I asked about this place in Santa Fe,
and they said it didn't exist.

195
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,909
It doesn't.

196
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,613
So where does a fellow
get some chow around here, huh?

197
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,352
- We already ate.
- Oh, great.

198
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,929
Oh, if you wanna take a shower,
I'd take one now.

199
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
They turn off the water at 2:00.

200
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,834
Keep those two men back there.
We still gotta run the power through.

201
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,476
Yeah, you two men there!

202
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,351
Higher! A little more.

203
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,388
All right, that'll do it.

204
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,252
Open this door, now!

205
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,628
Sorry. I couldn't get in.

206
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,233
Give it a month, you'll do that
because you can't get out.

207
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,663
- You Merriman?
- Yeah.

208
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,236
Richard Schoenfield.
I'm the doctor around here.

209
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,500
You're just what I'm looking for
in a roommate, a little brute strength.

210
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,945
Holy shit!

211
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,514
- What in God's name is this?
- It looks like a fridge.

212
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,514
Oh, yeah, it does.

213
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,482
It looks stuck.

214
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,215
I guess you arrived just in time then.
Thank God you're here.

215
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,450
Which end would you like?

216
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,793
Are you ready?

217
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,762
- You want me to get it myself?
- Lift.

218
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,914
Oppie's boys.
No problem left unsolved.

219
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:15,424
Gentlemen, this project
has been separated into three areas.

220
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,960
The physics.
How much material do we need?

221
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,928
Should it be plutonium
or uranium 235?

222
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,501
Second, manufacture of material,
but that's out of our hands.

223
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,672
That's Oak Ridge, Tennessee
and Hanford. And third,

224
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,239
our responsibility,
and this is a cinch...

225
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,070
Yeah, sure.

226
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:36,544
...build the device, test it,
and just hope that we can control it.

227
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,945
Gentlemen, we are here...

228
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:44,850
...at the beginning.
Our objective is here.

229
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,583
We have a deadline of 19 months.

230
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,960
19 months?
It seems such a short time.

231
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,363
19 months coincides
with our anticipated delivery date

232
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,834
from Oak Ridge. Gentlemen,
we have 19 months, that's it...

233
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,667
...to box, wrap
and deliver this package.

234
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,805
Are there any dissenters?

235
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,403
No?

236
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,477
Good.

237
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,752
<i>Nineteen months</i>
<i>and starting from scratch, Jesus.</i>

238
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:20,517
<i>Still, Oppie's got the best theoreticians</i>
<i>and engineers in the world.</i>

239
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:25,322
<i>Some of these guys are legends and</i>
<i>so young. The place is a hothouse.</i>

240
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,988
<i>Doc, he seems like</i>
<i>he's gonna be a good man.</i>

241
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,536
<i>Reckons we'll be working with funny</i>
<i>stuff. He's gonna be looking out for us.</i>

242
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:36,435
<i>He's got a whole wing of the hospital</i>
<i>that looks like Noah's Ark.</i>

243
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,834
<i>I think of Jimmy fighting in the</i>
<i>Philippines, and I can't complain.</i>

244
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,482
<i>I love you, but I gotta go.</i>
<i>General wants a progress report.</i>

245
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,210
<i>When Groves wants something,</i>
<i>he wants it now.</i>

246
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,013
Again.

247
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,519
We build a cannon, and at the end

248
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,855
weld a stopper
made from a subcritical mass.

249
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,125
We fabricate a shell
made from another subcritical mass

250
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,291
and fire it down the barrel.

251
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,105
- How much of both materials?
- Projecting 30 pounds.

252
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,298
30 pounds is as far away
as the moon.

253
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,637
<i>We're trying to tap the energy</i>
<i>that fuels the universe.</i>

254
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,975
<i>It's petrifying. All we've got</i>
<i>so far are problems,</i>

255
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,550
<i>and that doesn't include the ones</i>
<i>we haven't thought about.</i>

256
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,483
Shake down the bad news.
I'm getting used to it.

257
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,681
At the moment, there are
two problems. Pre-detonation.

258
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,383
The gadget disintegrates
before it explodes.

259
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,927
Second, it's the weight problem.

260
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,759
For the slug to travel at the velocity
we need,

261
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,367
the gun barrel
would be so heavy, so thick,

262
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,165
I don't think we'd get the gadget
off the ground with a crane.

263
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,774
If they're talking about a slug
with a seven-inch diameter,

264
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:48,845
then you'd have to have a barrel
thickness of at least four inches.

265
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,351
I hope you guys find the music.

266
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,082
The way things are,
we can't even hum the tune.

267
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,954
Free discussion.
Two groups...

268
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,493
- I'm not comfortable with...
- Excuse me.

269
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:08,622
Seth, Deke, the gun barrel.
Robert, Michael, pre-detonation.

270
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:16,074
Damn it! Just, damn it!
Maybe it's the altitude.

271
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,775
But we're still just chalk
on a blackboard.

272
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,844
We're dead in the water.

273
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,547
Maybe we cast a lighter
gun barrel, find a new alloy.

274
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,411
The force would be too great.

275
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,919
We gotta smack these atoms together
to trigger a chain reaction.

276
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:35,287
We gotta concentrate the energy
and crush the mass.

277
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,428
All right, let's rethink this.

278
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:41,362
We have a gun barrel that's so heavy
we can't lift it with a plane.

279
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,593
To get the explosive power we need,
it's gotta be heavy.

280
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,937
Michael, come here!

281
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,301
When I squeeze this...

282
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,343
- ...what do I get?
- Juice.

283
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:57,471
No. I squeeze it, I get compression.

284
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,482
We get a hollow sphere
of plutonium,

285
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,985
and we compress it
with an explosion that goes in.

286
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,454
- An implosion.
- Chain reaction.

287
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,422
Boom!

288
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,323
- But, Seth, explosives go out.
- I know.

289
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,432
But we make one that goes in.

290
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,330
Jesus.

291
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,301
- Michael.
- Let's get the boys.

292
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,565
We'll meet down here in the canteen.

293
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:28,439
It's brilliant. The device is gonna be so
light that we don't need a gun barrel!

294
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,142
Got a match, soldier?

295
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,288
Sir, it's Michael and Seth!

296
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,432
I'm sorry to bother you.

297
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,536
But Seth had an idea.
He was thinking of an orange.

298
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:56,037
Yes, I was thinking of jumping
up and down on an orange.

299
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,142
- Crushing an orange.
- Crushing!

300
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,438
Crushing...the core.

301
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,411
Oh, God.
This could be very sweet.

302
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,178
- Where are the others?
- Canteen, they wanna kick it around.

303
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:11,550
- Perhaps it can wait till later?
- No, you go ahead.

304
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,556
- I'd have lost you anyway.
- Thank you.

305
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,630
Goddamn it.

306
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,078
Doctor!

307
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,949
- Come on!
- Double up, over here!

308
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:51,960
I'm sorry. We were looking for testing
sites and the bus got stuck.

309
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,191
You had a meeting last night.
You discussed the work in public.

310
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,461
We were discussing
Neddermeyer's...

311
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,537
- In public!
- A table in the back of the canteen.

312
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:05,437
- We were having a free discussion.
- Let's just talk about that.

313
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,977
I don't want free discussion.
I want compartmentalization.

314
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,981
I don't want theoreticians
knowing what engineers know.

315
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,609
- Listen to me...
- It is a security problem!

316
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,417
These kids are used to pinning
their best ideas on a board.

317
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:24,289
Ideas are community property.
It's a matter of principle.

318
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:28,064
You force my hand and there
won't be any free discussion

319
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,634
because there won't be anybody left
to have it!

320
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:35,998
If you'd been there you'd understand.
Neddermeyer's idea was brilliant.

321
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,005
An explosion that goes inwards,

322
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,839
producing uniform compression
in a core and it'd be lightweight.

323
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,811
No gun barrel,
no velocity and weight problem.

324
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,611
And all of that
out of free discussion.

325
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,346
You've got to give us room
to breathe.

326
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,919
- Bronson?
- Sir?

327
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,653
Just don't give it to the waitresses.

328
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,731
<i>Oppie's quite a match</i>
<i>for the general.</i>

329
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,468
<i>I'm worried it's not in Groves' nature</i>
<i>to rest until he gets the upper hand.</i>

330
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,805
<i>We're terrified the Germans</i>
<i>are ahead.</i>

331
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:19,849
<i>Working with restrictions</i>
<i>and regulations is setting us on edge.</i>

332
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,454
This is typical.
We are people, not numbers!

333
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,886
It's not part of the agreement,
general.

334
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:29,254
I apologize for complaints,
but barbed wire,

335
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,190
dogs, guards!

336
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,558
- Security badges!
- Secrets!

337
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,792
I hoped to leave these things in Italy
with Mussolini!

338
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,801
Openness is a principle
matter for scientists!

339
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:44,101
And there are many other things.
I resent my letters are being censored.

340
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:48,211
The FBI talking to me, that's one
thing. But my wife, my family,

341
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,372
that's a little much.
Don't you think?

342
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,781
We cannot continue work
under these conditions!

343
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,387
- Doctor.
- And what about...?

344
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,867
Well, that is some monkey house
in there.

345
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,572
A mess.
What are you gonna do about it?

346
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,833
I warned you about this.

347
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:24,382
Look, you give me responsibility
for security inside the lab.

348
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,074
We go where we like, as we like,
when we like.

349
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,743
Outside the lab, that's yours.

350
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,889
I will sell them on that.

351
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:40,465
I don't like it.
But I will live with it, for now.

352
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,031
<i>The 8th Air Force today</i>

353
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:54,644
<i>carried out its heaviest bombing</i>
<i>of the war against Germany.</i>

354
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,271
Michael! Michael. What do you say?
Good to see you.

355
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,317
- How are you?
- I brought Kathleen with me.

356
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:05,582
I was afraid this party would be
a little short on the beauty side,

357
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:10,353
so I took the appropriate precautions,
if you know what I'm saying.

358
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,831
- I mean, she is my favorite nurse.
- You two gonna get together?

359
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:20,894
No. No, we're not.
Actually, I'm gonna get a drink.

360
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:26,373
That's what I'm gonna get. A good
stiff drink, that's all I'm gonna get.

361
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,943
- Two bucks...
- It's a short bet.

362
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,081
- Like I said...
- This is stuck.

363
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,451
...it can be pretty lonely here.

364
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,489
There's a war on.

365
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,686
Not everybody can go to Acapulco.

366
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,639
- Oh, my.
- Are you OK?

367
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,475
Good.
Thank you.

368
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,580
Look, they're perfect.

369
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,082
Another minute,
they would have been overdone.

370
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,916
Well, I'll put this in the sink.

371
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,148
- Would you like some orange juice?
- Yes, kindly.

372
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:18,489
- I am sorry.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

373
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,764
- This will be taken care of.
- It's OK.

374
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:28,998
Anyway, I'm sure
we're going to be allies, general.

375
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,008
We're both trying to seduce
the same man.

376
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,583
So is there a Mrs. Groves?

377
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,714
Yes, there is.

378
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:49,150
And she has the courage
to stay in the background.

379
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:53,520
Some men are on the planet
for a purpose, Mrs. Oppenheimer.

380
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:58,863
A good wife recognizes that
and is happy to smooth the way.

381
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,971
Read my theory
on degenerate matter, did you?

382
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,113
It didn't generate
much enthusiasm elsewhere.

383
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,114
But what do you think we'll find
at the end of the tunnel, Michael?

384
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,685
- A martini.
- Probably.

385
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,419
Hey!

386
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:41,074
- <i>Operator.</i>
- Berkeley 5558, please.

387
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,343
Hello, Jean.
It's me.

388
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,082
- Jean, I know you're there.
- <i>I'd given up waiting.</i>

389
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,426
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to manage...

390
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:59,062
<i>Oppie, I've been so frightened.</i>

391
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,324
<i>You don't phone. You don't write.</i>
<i>Not even a message.</i>

392
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,263
- <i>I can't.</i>
- <i>You can't?</i>

393
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,063
<i>No, Jean, I can't.</i>

394
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,864
- <i>Are you coming?</i>
- <i>Well...</i>

395
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,871
- <i>When are you coming?</i>
- <i>Jean.</i>

396
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,547
<i>This isn't talking.</i>
<i>This is just making noises.</i>

397
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,909
<i>Why don't we just grunt</i>
<i>at each other?</i>

398
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,847
- <i>''I gotta run. There's a war to win.''</i>
- <i>Jean.</i>

399
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,456
<i>I can't remember a day</i>
<i>I wasn't hurting, except with you.</i>

400
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:29,457
Jean, listen to me.
You've got to understand, please.

401
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,512
Yes?

402
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,390
I won't keep you, general.

403
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,186
Well, you better had.

404
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,387
Banging on my door
at 2:00 in the morning.

405
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,263
I had this typed up, sir.
I thought you'd wanna see it.

406
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,340
She's working him over, general.
I've seen this before.

407
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,070
That grunting at each other,
could be a code.

408
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,648
- The cipher clerk said it's not code.
- Who is this woman?

409
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:29,218
Jean Tatlock, sir.
She's a known communist.

410
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,685
Get me her background.

411
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,624
And maybe I am missing some stuff
on the good doctor.

412
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,762
- Get it for me.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,889
This must throw Oppenheimer's
position on this project into doubt, sir.

414
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,366
- Dr. Oppenheimer is the project.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,566
All due respect, sir, though, doesn't
this make him an unacceptable risk?

416
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,745
No! Failure's a risk.

417
00:31:56,381 --> 00:32:00,511
The thing that concerns me is,
if he's with her, he's not with us.

418
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,921
It might be a good time
to put the screws to the doctor.

419
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,255
Yes, sir. May I ask,
how do you intend to do that, sir?

420
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,863
No, colonel, you may not.

421
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,460
- Compression not uniform.
- Stand by!

422
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,360
If we had a thinner wall, we could
increase the compression, yes?

423
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,228
Seth, there's an answer here.

424
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,892
Oppie, maybe implosion's
just a blind alley.

425
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,799
- Are we going again?
- Yes!

426
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,442
- That's an excuse for not thinking...
- We'll get reset.

427
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:04,741
All clear!
Reset the charges!

428
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,749
Reset the charges!

429
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,979
- We got all clear! Let's go!
- Let's move!

430
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:15,387
- Move it!
- On the double! On the double! Go!

431
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:19,758
- Move it! Move it!
- Bring it in! Left side! Left side!

432
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,458
Come on!
Get the lead out!

433
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,363
On the double, guys!
Let's go!

434
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,071
Canyon to Los Alamos.

435
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,674
Come in, Los Alamos.

436
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,972
Canyon to Los Alamos.

437
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,181
Come in, Los Alamos. Come in.

438
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:47,956
- Something set off the detonators.
- Stay back! They're wired in series.

439
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,889
Get out of there!

440
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,524
- No, Oppie.
- Shit.

441
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,508
It's all right.

442
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,951
Take it easy, brother.

443
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,884
Thanks a lot.

444
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,657
Do me a favor.
Jump in the ambulance.

445
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,527
Let me give you
the once-over.

446
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,828
You guys are playing
with some funny stuff out here.

447
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,599
Let's go. Start them up.

448
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,290
Did they teach you that at high school?

449
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,786
You took a risk.

450
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,931
I ran out and grabbed the guy.
I didn't even think.

451
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,126
- Just instinct.
- Instinct, huh?

452
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,736
You know, I wonder,
with this war...

453
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,502
...if it's instinct to save a man,
what makes us want to kill one?

454
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,903
Is that instinct?

455
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,284
You sound like my old man.

456
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:21,849
Why, what's he like?

457
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,283
- My old man?
- Yeah.

458
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,387
He's a preacher.

459
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,552
In Jackson, Illinois.

460
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:35,425
And I got an older brother,
Jimmy, and he's a soldier.

461
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,659
My mom's dead.

462
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:41,635
I don't know, I guess he's kind of
hurt that I'm not at the front.

463
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,068
- Why?
- Well, Jackson is a small town.

464
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,643
- He said, ''Where you going?''
- I said, ''Santa Fe, New Mexico.''

465
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,909
- I know.
- So that didn't quite hack it.

466
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,818
He said,
''lf you're not gonna be a soldier,

467
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,478
''you better be a good scientist.
The best.''

468
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,554
- Are you the best?
- I was in Chicago.

469
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,459
But these guys are so bright.

470
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,098
Sometimes I feel like
I'm in over my head.

471
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,430
But I guess I can handle
anything they throw at me.

472
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,070
But can you dance?

473
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,764
Pardon me?

474
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,808
I said, can you dance?

475
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:25,978
- Yeah.
- Well, do it.

476
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,544
- Are you serious?
- Can't handle it?

477
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,876
Very nice.

478
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,455
- Something like that.
- Very good.

479
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,977
Jean Tatlock, graduated in 1932.

480
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:39,418
They had a thing together
before Oppenheimer was married.

481
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,182
Seems Tatlock ran off.

482
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,487
Things went on the back burner
between them till 1942.

483
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,357
Then it all started up again.

484
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,864
His associate said, ''lf the wife's
his ambition, Tatlock's his conscience.''

485
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:55,199
She introduced him to a number of
anti-fascist groups, anti-Franco groups

486
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,896
and a number of communists.

487
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,370
- Bronson.
- Sir.

488
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:02,273
Little less muscle on the gas here.
Colonel's starting a mission.

489
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,708
I'd like him alive.

490
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,310
Yes, sir.

491
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,452
This makes Oppenheimer
a sitting duck for blackmail.

492
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,019
I'm gonna insist on his removal.

493
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,588
No, you're not. Just relax.

494
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:18,388
You know, major, if you want
to lead a man in a certain direction,

495
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,156
you don't drag him by the nose.

496
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,632
You just close off his options.

497
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,996
Simple as a truck.

498
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,842
<i>Here we are in the top of the ninth.</i>

499
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,478
<i>The Army down</i>
<i>to the Scientists by one run.</i>

500
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:40,377
<i>Dugan shakes it off.</i>
<i>Here's Merriman's pitch.</i>

501
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,212
<i>That's a hit.</i>

502
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,150
<i>Dugan digging for first base,</i>
<i>gonna go for two.</i>

503
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,884
<i>Look out. Here's the throw.</i>
<i>Safe at second base on a slide.</i>

504
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,961
<i>Apple scores.</i>
<i>That ties the game.</i>

505
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,203
Yes?

506
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,731
Yes?!

507
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,437
Bad time?

508
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:14,243
The velocity's still presenting us
with something of a problem.

509
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,486
Who's this bimbo
you're running around with?

510
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,292
- What?
- Do I have to tell you?

511
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,630
I got it on the q.t.
from somebody who owes me.

512
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,927
What if the next guy
doesn't owe me?

513
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,764
Takes that kind of information
to the wrong guy?

514
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:39,375
That could be the end of you.
Could be the end of this project.

515
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,044
I don't understand you.

516
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:47,010
You think you're some kind
of bohemian or something.

517
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,912
Blind-sided.

518
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,583
I never expected to get
blind-sided like this.

519
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,528
<i>And there it is.</i>
<i>A line drive.</i>

520
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:12,576
Doctor, might I be of assistance?

521
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,201
What about me in all this?
This looks bad.

522
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,043
Reflects on me.
Reflects on my ability to choose men.

523
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:24,119
I was with this woman before
this project. This is not a new thing.

524
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,254
It's no matter.

525
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:31,055
I am not comfortable with the idea
that you could sink me.

526
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,633
This is someone that I care about.

527
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,032
She's a communist.

528
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,029
A communist.

529
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,507
Oh, my God.

530
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:48,338
It would be bad enough if she
were just some...

531
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,343
...sweet young thing from Indiana.

532
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,505
She's a card-carrying communist.

533
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:57,721
And your job, classified job. What do
I have to do, draw you a map?

534
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:01,255
Get on the phone, a secure line,
tell her...goodbye!

535
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,222
<i>The pitch. It's a line drive!</i>

536
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,929
<i>It's out of there! It's gone!</i>
<i>Home run for Merriman.</i>

537
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,063
Home run!

538
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,403
- It's all right, Bronson, we'll live.
- Yes, sir.

539
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:18,064
<i>Well, that's it, folks,</i>
<i>Scientists win the game.</i>

540
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,833
It's in your court.

541
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,123
Bridges, next time keep your head up.

542
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,024
<i>All hail the conquering hero.</i>

543
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,964
<i>Pencil pushers defeat</i>
<i>the doughboys.</i>

544
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:35,713
Robert!

545
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,981
- Frank.
- Good to see you, bro.

546
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,928
- Are we being followed or something?
- Don't joke.

547
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,087
I nearly asked you for your ID.

548
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:52,227
- That's ridiculous.
- Let's just leave as soon as we can.

549
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:05,073
They've been hounding me
for names of every person I've known

550
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,876
who had communist sympathies.

551
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:11,253
They monitor every move I make.
They listen to my phone conversations.

552
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,946
Why stay?

553
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:15,091
There's an order to it.

554
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,251
An order in some part of my life,
at least.

555
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,956
I'm sorry, I didn't get your message
till about 5.

556
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:27,160
I was still at the hospital, and I got
all whizzed up into a huge panic.

557
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,032
You look wonderful.

558
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,901
You look so serious.
What's the matter?

559
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,410
I don't have much time.
I have to go back tonight.

560
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,104
Tonight?

561
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,250
I cooked us dinner.

562
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,250
This can't be about dinner, Jean.

563
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,988
I didn't want to tell you
on the telephone.

564
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,496
And that's why I'm here tonight.

565
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,773
Is it because of what you're doing?

566
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,056
Fine.

567
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:25,919
We're going to spill the blood
before we get to the cocktails.

568
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,837
Jean?

569
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:46,037
Please...stay tonight.

570
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,484
Please.

571
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,280
Please.

572
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,951
Please.

573
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,526
Please.

574
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,845
What you're working on,
it's something bad, isn't it?

575
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,992
That's why you can't tell me.

576
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,855
I can't tell you
because it's a secret.

577
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,564
Tell me one good thing
that's a secret.

578
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,633
We were a good thing.

579
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,326
No, we weren't.

580
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,664
Not when you got married.

581
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,970
Give me up for something
I can understand.

582
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,635
Your wife or your child
or your conscience,

583
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,576
something alive.

584
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,445
Not something
that you have to hide.

585
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,777
Robert.

586
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,615
Oh, Robert, I dreamt you'd gone.

587
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,866
So that's what the silences were.

588
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:47,870
No letters, no contact.

589
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,201
I thought it was me,
something I'd done.

590
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:56,641
- I've told you it has nothing to do...
- Yes, but you didn't tell me...

591
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:02,079
What is it you're working on?
What is so important?

592
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,743
That's right. It is important.

593
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,186
So don't be so goddamn arrogant.

594
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:10,019
Is it arrogant to want
to know where you are?

595
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:14,062
What's happening to you? To want
to be close to you? To understand?

596
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,725
This was the man I loved.

597
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:23,705
I loved his dreams.
I loved what he saw but couldn't prove.

598
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,638
I loved the goodness in him.

599
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:30,541
He was my proof that the world
could be made better.

600
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,906
And if he's dead, I don't want to live.

601
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:40,219
The world is...different.

602
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,690
It's just not what we
wanted it to be.

603
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,556
It's just not.

604
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,837
You mattered to me so much.

605
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:59,238
You really did.

606
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:15,820
She told me that I had
a penchant for destruction.

607
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,225
That I'd lost faith.

608
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,223
Is she wrong?

609
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,159
No.

610
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,766
She's not wrong.

611
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:31,229
When this war's over, I want
to ride the mesa for six months.

612
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:32,931
No deadlines.

613
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,175
Nothing.

614
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,177
Thanks, Frank.

615
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,445
He just kissed his brother.

616
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,521
Gotta be a communist.

617
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:04,966
Set that over there.

618
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:11,572
Look at it, Oppie, it's twisted.
It's got to be flat.

619
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:16,151
I think implosion's nothing but a pipe
dream. I'm sorry I thought of it.

620
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,947
I can't do it.

621
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:22,422
Oppie, some way I have to focus...
I have to focus the shock waves.

622
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,159
Look at me!
God, I'm running out of ideas.

623
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:29,265
That's an excuse for not thinking.
If you can't, I'll find somebody else.

624
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:32,596
Oppie? Serber needs
you back at the lab right now.

625
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,760
- Oppie?
- You said it yourself.

626
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:38,840
Focus. Somebody's working on a way
to focus an explosive shock wave.

627
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,807
- I'm gonna find him. Keep working.
- Jesus!

628
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:52,417
You know, if Oppie doesn't let up,
he's going to implode.

629
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,568
Inside. Inside.

630
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:15,467
Good news is the new plutonium
makes lots of neutrons.

631
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,547
But the bad news is the spontaneous
fission rate is way too high.

632
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:23,482
The reaction will run away with itself.
There will just be a fizzle.

633
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,816
- No explosion.
- You're certain of that, Edward?

634
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,049
- Who did the calculations?
- Serber.

635
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:32,059
- Himself?
- Serber, personally.

636
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:37,059
So now plutonium is a problem. That
shifts the emphasis back to U-235.

637
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:41,330
Of course, Oak Ridge is not able
to produce that in sufficient quantity.

638
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:45,030
We must go with implosion, but
Neddermeyer has just announced to me

639
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,700
that he and implosion
have just reached a brick wall.

640
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,845
We can't fall behind.

641
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,748
Are you all right, Oppie?

642
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,878
You have a deadline to meet.

643
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:05,995
Banked almost a billion dollars on you
guys. That's not working on the cheap.

644
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,964
Only thing I want to hear is, ''Yes, sir.''

645
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:13,262
Don't talk to me like I haven't given
eight days a week to this project.

646
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,062
I've given up everything.

647
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,240
Don't... Don't give me that.

648
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,532
I don't want to hear
that from the...

649
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,540
I've given up everything.

650
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,145
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

651
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,814
I don't give a goddamn
that travel was restricted.

652
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:31,647
It had to be done face to face,
and that's the way I did it.

653
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,692
<i>Latest news</i>
<i>from the fighting front.</i>

654
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:46,061
<i>American armies are pushing the</i>

655
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,726

658
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:55,906
Who's the Lone Ranger?

659
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,172
Explosives wiz.
I don't know about Tonto.

660
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,908
<i>Neddermeyer gave up</i>
<i>on his explosion that goes in.</i>

661
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,346

You want a ride, doc?

666
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:22,034
Hey, Seth. When did you
get your driver's license?

667
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,143
- You come to see the boys at play?
- Yes.

668
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,609
- Oh, bad news, beautiful.
- Oh, no.

669
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,340
I'm not gonna be able to make
that movie tonight.

670
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,142
I can join you both for a drink.
It would make you happy.

671
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,254
- Sound good?
- Perfect.

672
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:42,187
Right, right.

673
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:46,318
Well, I promised the monkey
we'd be cutting a rug anyway.

674
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,396
It's just as well.

675
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:51,226
Michael, what's wrong with you?

676
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,363
Do you see much of him?

677
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,471
Yes, I like him.

678
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:02,068
Are you jealous?

679
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:06,243
Yeah.

680
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,450
You better do something about it.

681
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:27,361
Tell them I ain't buying.
White House said

682
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,404
there wouldn't be
any account till after the war.

683
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,741
It's so damn tough
to get through to you,

684
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:37,141
I decided to bring
you my problem.

685
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:40,681
See the tread on that tire?
Because I sure as hell don't.

686
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:43,375
Yet that's what my men
are riding around on.

687
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:48,016
I don't know what kind of deal
you got yourself into, Groves,

688
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,887
but I do care when it cuts
in on my territory.

689
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,724
If I'm gonna move supplies around
the country, I need trucks.

690
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,957
Those trucks run on tires, Dick.

691
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:01,297
When I hear they ain't moving because
of some tire shortage, I get mad.

692
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:04,405
When I hear you're the cause
of it, I want to kill.

693
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:08,510
- We gotta work something...
- No dice. We got a triple-A priority.

694
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:11,840
White House authority.
We need the product.

695
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:16,375
You need to know something.

696
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,919
You're getting a lot
of people's backs up.

697
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:22,117
Let me remind you of something else.
See this?

698
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,657
I count two. You got one.

699
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,262
When this war's over,
that will amount to something.

700
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:33,865
And, Dick, I hope you get my meaning.

701
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,664
Because, by all that's holy...

702
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,539
...you better have
your ass well-covered.

703
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,814
- Well, Bronson.
- Sir?

704
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:56,022
- It's all about ass, isn't it?
- Sir?

705
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,717
You kick it or you lick it.

706
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:01,125
That's what it's all about.

707
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,858
I'm sorry about
my language, Bronson.

708
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,729
But I'm on the limb.

709
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,369
My prima donnas
better come through...

710
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:12,731
...or you are looking
at a piece of dead meat.

711
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,538
Yes, sir.

712
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,457
- What's this?
- I don't know, sir.

713
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,391
God, almighty.

714
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,323
Is this a stop?

715
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,225
What time is it?
There's no scheduled stop here.

716
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:47,505
Message for General Groves.

717
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:52,737
- I'll see what the problem is, sir.
- Message for General Groves.

718
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,146
- Message for General Groves.
- In this way.

719
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,491
General Groves, sir.
This is from Germany.

720
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:08,188
It was flown in. We wired
ahead to have the train stopped.

721
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,299
Excuse me, gentlemen.

722
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,811
- Colonel.
- General.

723
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:34,222
Put it in my safe, in the back.

724
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,153
Don't bring it out.

725
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:42,029
That means the Germans don't
have the bomb. Weren't close.

726
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:45,326
Sir, is it wise?
I mean, suppressing this?

727
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,560
Well, you tell me, colonel.

728
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:51,135
It's delicate stuff.

729
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:56,039
I'm talking about my longhairs,
my prima donnas.

730
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,839
The Jewish element.

731
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:02,847
Take Hitler out of the equation...
they might just run out of stink.

732
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:05,010
Why chance it?

733
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:09,314
We can give this country
the biggest stick in the playground.

734
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:11,289
And I intend to do that.

735
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:16,189
And I'll tell you something
about our bunch.

736
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:17,856
Get them close.

737
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:21,032
Then they'll go all the way.

738
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,339
They're just not close enough yet.

739
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:26,099
Yes, sir.

740
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:38,077
Perhaps you should think of these
wedges as forming part of a shell.

741
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:43,586
They do redirect the shock waves in
the same way as a lens redirects light.

742
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,389
As a matter of interest, we've
already used the idea in England

743
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,794
for armor-piercing shells.

744
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,095
Pray it works.
We'll be back on schedule.

745
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,705
Heads up.

746
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,002
Watch your backs.

747
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:29,438
No one ever used high explosives...

748
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:32,973
...as a precision instrument before.

749
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,105
It's so simple.

750
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:38,770
It just swings the shock waves
from convex to concave.

751
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,974
- Some orange, hey, Oppie?
- No, after the explosion.

752
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:49,418
Dr. Oppenheimer.

753
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,288
Dr. Oppenheimer.

754
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:52,758
A letter for you, sir.

755
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,489
- They said it was important.
- Thank you.

756
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,911
Good luck.
