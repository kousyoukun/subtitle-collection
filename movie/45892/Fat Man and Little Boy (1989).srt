1
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:34,613
At ease.

2
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:41,016
Move it, move it, move it!

3
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,629
One, two, three.

4
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:53,174
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

5
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:58,646
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny! Hoorah!</i>

6
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:01,947
Boy, those Japs better watch out
for you, sir. Good luck.

7
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,413
The Corps of Engineers
is gonna miss you, sir.

8
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:07,161
- Thank you, gentlemen. Bronson.
- Sir.

9
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:10,487
I built this place,
so I'll be glad to eat it.

10
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:15,711
Well done, sir.

11
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,331
You're a lucky man.
Give those Japs hell.

12
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:20,317
Thank you, Thomas.

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,716
Indeed, I will.

14
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:28,474
Sir!

15
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,509
I'm losing my chance
to get out from behind a desk

16
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,477
- and lead men in combat!
- Colonel Groves, forget it. This has...

17
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:37,916
Even Bronson
wants to head for the front.

18
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,414
Forget about the front.
You're an engineer.

19
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:43,258
You're gonna fight your war here.

20
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:47,962
Is this what you're assigning me to,
this boondoggle? Dead end?

21
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,737
This dead end, Groves, has the
personal backing of the president.

22
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:54,718
This is not what I was promised,
not what I expected.

23
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,262
Then bone up on it.
Head to Chicago, talk to the scientist.

24
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:00,406
If it looks possible, run with it.

25
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:04,667
Take whoever you want. Have
whatever you need. Just make it work.

26
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:07,733
Who knows, you might just win
this war on your own.

27
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,424
Pick up a star on the way.

28
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,404
<i>...fighting for, and they are reported
to be giving the Germans hell.</i>

29
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:49,528
<i>Though these losses represent the
most serious setbacks for the Allies</i>

30
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:51,615
<i>in this war
against the Nazi enemy.</i>

31
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:55,768
<i>Bad news, too,
from the war in the Pacific.</i>

32
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:59,765
<i>We have just had confirmation of
the sinking of three US cruisers.</i>

33
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:02,652
<i>Names are being withheld.
The casualties are high.</i>

34
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:04,244
Come in!

35
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:08,638
<i>Reports of an early-morning raid
by Japanese dive-bombers...</i>

36
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:12,248
In here.
In here!

37
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:15,132
- Szard?
- Szilard.

38
00:04:15,295 --> 00:04:18,907
General Groves, I was expecting you.
Come in! Come in!

39
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:32,379
Forgive me.
Sometimes I get stuck in here.

40
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:34,485
Metaphorically.

41
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,412
I've read this.

42
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,707
- Is it possible?
- You couldn't put a little more hot in,

43
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,464
could you?

44
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:54,328
And I'm not very good at fairy tales,
so just give me the happy ending.

45
00:04:56,607 --> 00:05:00,284
What I wrote is possible,
probably inevitable.

46
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:05,372
Separate uranium 235,
then arrange for two portions

47
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:09,845
of the element to be brought together
suddenly, so that the resulting mass,

48
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,023
no bigger than this, general,

49
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:15,803
undergoes a spontaneous
self-generating reaction.

50
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:20,474
And if this was the epicenter
of that explosion...

51
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:26,045
...all of Chicago you could see
from here would disintegrate.

52
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,446
Hallelujah.

53
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,341
At the moment, all we have
are theories, concepts, inspirations,

54
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:36,799
- inconclusive results...
- Now, if we can make this device,

55
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,967
- so can the Krauts.
- Yes.

56
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:41,436
Germany has the scientific capability.

57
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:45,080
And, general,
we need leadership here.

58
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:46,708
- I can help!
- Thank you.

59
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,701
You need an ally, general!

60
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,524
- So tell us about this general.
- Why?

61
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:01,237
Because it's so mysterious.

62
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,708
''Meet me in the middle
of God-knows-where.

63
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:09,109
''Be there no earlier than 4:20,
no later than 4:29.''

64
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,189
Well, word has it

65
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,182
he's a provincial windbag

66
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:16,758
who's spent most of his life
digging holes in Latin America.

67
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:19,642
- Graves for the natives, no doubt.
- Oh, Frank.

68
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:22,524
Seriously, Kitty, after all,
Robert's a scientist.

69
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:25,687
If the Army wants him,
they'll want all of him.

70
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:28,506
All of him?
Why not take all of him?

71
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:31,550
Look, I have to at least hear
what he has to offer.

72
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:34,559
- Robert, must we go so fast?
- Yes!

73
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:38,492
- It's crazy.
- Yes! Yes!

74
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:48,380
This way, Dr. Oppenheimer.

75
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,886
Doctor!

76
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:14,648
Up here!

77
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,285
Groves, Leslie. Friends call me Dick.
Sit down.

78
00:07:21,663 --> 00:07:23,157
Ingenuity.

79
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:27,385
I love it.
Created out of nothing but up here.

80
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:29,144
Clear!

81
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:36,954
The old man likes his privacy,
doesn't he?

82
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:58,334
Guess what.

83
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:03,197
- The egghead wants a carrot juice.
- Get him what he wants, Bronson!

84
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:04,568
Get used to it.

85
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,734
What an eight ball this guy is.

86
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,741
Seems this Oppenheimer's
a hot number.

87
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:15,067
Says here, he's got more damn brains
than are decent.

88
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:19,322
He knows it too. Temperamental. He
ain't gonna be an easy horse to corral.

89
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:22,553
Oh, I think the general
knows what he's doing.

90
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:24,699
Oppenheimer ain't one of us.

91
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:27,830
The general picks that guy,
he'll be making a mistake.

92
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:35,964
It needs to get pulled together.

93
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:42,135
So I think you're the man for the job.

94
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:47,768
And I got a weakness for good men.

95
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,461
The Krauts are working on this,
full bore.

96
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:56,827
If they get it before we do,
I don't have to spell it out.

97
00:08:56,991 --> 00:08:58,933
Where would you start?

98
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:00,725
Focus.

99
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:04,412
You have great minds,
but all dancing to a different tune.

100
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:08,535
You bring them together in one place,
isolate them, no distractions.

101
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:11,190
You create an atmosphere
of creative stress.

102
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:14,326
Everyone competing
to solve one problem.

103
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:16,250
And you have one ringmaster.

104
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:21,339
Right now, it's all over the place.
You centralize everything.

105
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:23,357
There is a hitch.

106
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,836
There are people out there
don't like the color of your politics.

107
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:29,145
My politics...

108
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:31,133
...are an open book.

109
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:34,996
Well, I hope so.

110
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:38,909
You could win a war
and the Nobel Prize, God willing.

111
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,235
Sir, Major de Silva
wanted me to remind you

112
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:44,798
you've got a train to catch
at 1800 hours.

113
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,933
No rest for the wicked.

114
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,133
Oh, doctor.

115
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:57,308
If you take this on,
I say this in all humility, intellect...

116
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,933
...don't outrank that.

117
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:05,974
This general is a meatball,
a cipher.

118
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:09,110
He'd be eating out of the palm
of my hand in a week.

119
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,189
So will you accept?

120
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,815
There are questions.
There are a kaleidoscope of questions.

121
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:21,210
I see.

122
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,528
Well, I'm a star
at breakfast small talk.

123
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:29,786
You'll have to save some for evenings if
you're gonna be wife of the big cheese.

124
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:32,438
Would this mean moving?

125
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,896
Oh, you have to say yes.

126
00:10:36,063 --> 00:10:38,452
You're too brilliant for Berkeley.

127
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:45,213
<i>Michelangelo's The Creation
of Adam. Origin and destiny.</i>

128
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:49,405
Origins and destiny.

129
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,828
The struggle to unearth the one
and to discover the other.

130
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:54,747
That is science!

131
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:58,075
And as I leave here
to unravel my own small destiny,

132
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:01,501
I congratulate each of you
on being the best of the best.

133
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:03,485
I have faith in you all.

134
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:07,924
God keep you, and may your lives
be rich and sweet.

135
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:10,070
- Thank you.
- We'll miss you, Oppie!

136
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,995
We'll miss you, Oppie!

137
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,046
Good luck, Oppie!

138
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:39,166
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!

139
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:42,394
Let's move that thing out back.

140
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:50,846
Sir!

141
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:26,110
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Give me the good news, Jack.

142
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:28,507
We've got utilities on
throughout camp.

143
00:12:28,671 --> 00:12:32,468
We've got the sewage problem taken
care of. We have water throughout.

144
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,509
- Got the two science buildings...
- Not good enough.

145
00:12:35,678 --> 00:12:37,850
We gotta be
a couple of weeks behind.

146
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,665
You know, I got a bunch
of scientists up there.

147
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,449
They're just wandering,
bumping into each other.

148
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:47,062
Get some bodies in here. In a week,
I wanna be two weeks ahead.

149
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,435
I don't think we have
accommodations, sir.

150
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,508
Why would they want
accommodations?

151
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,956
You think they'll sleep?

152
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,716
All right, get some tents,
but put it on your EOR.

153
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:01,020
Didn't I ask for dogs
around that perimeter fence?

154
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:02,809
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see any.

155
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,665
They're coming, general.

156
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,694
So...

157
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:17,752
...whatever goes on around here
is privileged information.

158
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:23,996
No exceptions. No wives, no barbers.
No exceptions!

159
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,558
What you see,

160
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:31,604
what you hear, what you read,
what you dream about,

161
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:33,694
whatever...

162
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,422
...gives you heartburn or feeds your
ulcers, whatever gives you the sweats,

163
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,241
keeps you up at night, whatever,

164
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:43,130
all of that...

165
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,604
...belongs to the United States Army.

166
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:52,596
Or to me, if that makes you feel
more comfortable.

167
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,888
Now, you gotta come down
out of the clouds, gentlemen,

168
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:01,145
and get into the business
of winning a war.

169
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:05,587
I'm gonna say it once.
I'm only gonna say it once.

170
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:09,107
Those of you who know, know.
Those of you who don't, don't.

171
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,036
You are not here to be comfortable.

172
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:16,309
All right?

173
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:21,400
You are here

174
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:25,112
to go beyond the theoretical,

175
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:28,025
the speculative, the fanciful.

176
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:34,333
You are here to harness
your God-given talents,

177
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,699
your minds, your energy,

178
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:41,140
in the practical pursuit of one thing:

179
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,574
A military weapon.

180
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:45,466
Nuclear one.

181
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,796
An atomic bomb.

182
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:52,538
Keep the muttering
to just a minimum, gentlemen.

183
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,276
Why bother with a bomb?
Why not just drop that man on Berlin?

184
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:59,512
- When you talk about it...
- It will have the same effect.

185
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:04,599
...it will be referred to as ''the gadget''
or ''the device''.

186
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,457
Is that clear?

187
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:11,539
There is one word
that I don't wanna hear.

188
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:14,106
And that's the word ''impossible''.

189
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,879
- You're two days late.
- I went to 109 East Palace Street

190
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:21,625
to report to Mrs. McKibben,
but there was nobody there.

191
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:26,974
So I hopped a construction bus, and it
damn near drove me back to Chicago.

192
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:32,153
I've been sitting on trains, buses,

193
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:36,506
railway stations for 60 hours.

194
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:41,819
I asked about this place in Santa Fe,
and they said it didn't exist.

195
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,608
It doesn't.

196
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:51,956
So where does a fellow
get some chow around here, huh?

197
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:55,541
- We already ate.
- Oh, great.

198
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,972
Oh, if you wanna take a shower,
I'd take one now.

199
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:01,982
They turn off the water at 2:00.

200
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:11,348
Keep those two men back there.
We still gotta run the power through.

201
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:13,882
Yeah, you two men there!

202
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:19,516
Higher! A little more.

203
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:22,429
All right, that'll do it.

204
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:26,135
Open this door, now!

205
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:29,373
Sorry. I couldn't get in.

206
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:32,830
Give it a month, you'll do that
because you can't get out.

207
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,201
- You Merriman?
- Yeah.

208
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:37,628
Richard Schoenfield.
I'm the doctor around here.

209
00:16:37,823 --> 00:16:41,717
You're just what I'm looking for
in a roommate, a little brute strength.

210
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,021
Holy shit!

211
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:48,444
- What in God's name is this?
- It looks like a fridge.

212
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:50,362
Oh, yeah, it does.

213
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:52,249
It looks stuck.

214
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:55,830
I guess you arrived just in time then.
Thank God you're here.

215
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:57,973
Which end would you like?

216
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,015
Are you ready?

217
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,822
- You want me to get it myself?
- Lift.

218
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,312
Oppie's boys.
No problem left unsolved.

219
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:30,555
Gentlemen, this project
has been separated into three areas.

220
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,988
The physics.
How much material do we need?

221
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:35,834
Should it be plutonium
or uranium 235?

222
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,261
Second, manufacture of material,
but that's out of our hands.

223
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:42,302
That's Oak Ridge, Tennessee
and Hanford. And third,

224
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,764
our responsibility,
and this is a cinch...

225
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:46,520
Yeah, sure.

226
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:50,810
...build the device, test it,
and just hope that we can control it.

227
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:53,113
Gentlemen, we are here...

228
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:58,776
...at the beginning.
Our objective is here.

229
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,397
We have a deadline of 19 months.

230
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,554
19 months?
It seems such a short time.

231
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,818
19 months coincides
with our anticipated delivery date

232
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:13,146
from Oak Ridge. Gentlemen,
we have 19 months, that's it...

233
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,863
...to box, wrap
and deliver this package.

234
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:18,873
Are there any dissenters?

235
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:22,323
No?

236
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,312
Good.

237
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,412
<i>Nineteen months
and starting from scratch, Jesus.</i>

238
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,982
<i>Still, Oppie's got the best theoreticians
and engineers in the world.</i>

239
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,590
<i>Some of these guys are legends and
so young. The place is a hothouse.</i>

240
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:40,147
<i>Doc, he seems like
he's gonna be a good man.</i>

241
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,509
<i>Reckons we'll be working with funny
stuff. He's gonna be looking out for us.</i>

242
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:48,248
<i>He's got a whole wing of the hospital
that looks like Noah's Ark.</i>

243
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,467
<i>I think of Jimmy fighting in the
Philippines, and I can't complain.</i>

244
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,966
<i>I love you, but I gotta go.
General wants a progress report.</i>

245
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,582
<i>When Groves wants something,
he wants it now.</i>

246
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:00,311
Again.

247
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:04,632
We build a cannon, and at the end

248
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:07,832
weld a stopper
made from a subcritical mass.

249
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:11,927
We fabricate a shell
made from another subcritical mass

250
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:14,004
and fire it down the barrel.

251
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,621
- How much of both materials?
- Projecting 30 pounds.

252
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,724
30 pounds is as far away
as the moon.

253
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,926
<i>We're trying to tap the energy
that fuels the universe.</i>

254
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:27,128
<i>It's petrifying. All we've got
so far are problems,</i>

255
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:30,556
<i>and that doesn't include the ones
we haven't thought about.</i>

256
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:33,369
Shake down the bad news.
I'm getting used to it.

257
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:36,436
At the moment, there are
two problems. Pre-detonation.

258
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:39,027
The gadget disintegrates
before it explodes.

259
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:41,467
Second, it's the weight problem.

260
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,183
For the slug to travel at the velocity
we need,

261
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,684
the gun barrel
would be so heavy, so thick,

262
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:50,327
I don't think we'd get the gadget
off the ground with a crane.

263
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:53,788
If they're talking about a slug
with a seven-inch diameter,

264
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,692
then you'd have to have a barrel
thickness of at least four inches.

265
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:05,850
I hope you guys find the music.

266
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:08,469
The way things are,
we can't even hum the tune.

267
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,264
Free discussion.
Two groups...

268
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,699
- I'm not comfortable with...
- Excuse me.

269
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:16,659
Seth, Deke, the gun barrel.
Robert, Michael, pre-detonation.

270
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,806
Damn it! Just, damn it!
Maybe it's the altitude.

271
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:26,396
But we're still just chalk
on a blackboard.

272
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,381
We're dead in the water.

273
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,932
Maybe we cast a lighter
gun barrel, find a new alloy.

274
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:33,720
The force would be too great.

275
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:38,043
We gotta smack these atoms together
to trigger a chain reaction.

276
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:42,232
We gotta concentrate the energy
and crush the mass.

277
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:44,285
All right, let's rethink this.

278
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:48,058
We have a gun barrel that's so heavy
we can't lift it with a plane.

279
00:20:48,222 --> 00:20:51,157
To get the explosive power we need,
it's gotta be heavy.

280
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,405
Michael, come here!

281
00:20:54,526 --> 00:20:56,631
When I squeeze this...

282
00:20:57,726 --> 00:20:59,548
- ...what do I get?
- Juice.

283
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:03,507
No. I squeeze it, I get compression.

284
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,395
We get a hollow sphere
of plutonium,

285
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,755
and we compress it
with an explosion that goes in.

286
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,122
- An implosion.
- Chain reaction.

287
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:14,010
Boom!

288
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:17,751
- But, Seth, explosives go out.
- I know.

289
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:20,733
But we make one that goes in.

290
00:21:22,878 --> 00:21:24,471
Jesus.

291
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:26,361
- Michael.
- Let's get the boys.

292
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:28,533
We'll meet down here in the canteen.

293
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:33,207
It's brilliant. The device is gonna be so
light that we don't need a gun barrel!

294
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:36,758
Got a match, soldier?

295
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,366
Sir, it's Michael and Seth!

296
00:21:51,998 --> 00:21:53,340
I'm sorry to bother you.

297
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:56,317
But Seth had an idea.
He was thinking of an orange.

298
00:21:56,511 --> 00:21:59,675
Yes, I was thinking of jumping
up and down on an orange.

299
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,693
- Crushing an orange.
- Crushing!

300
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:04,854
Crushing...the core.

301
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:07,706
Oh, God.
This could be very sweet.

302
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,318
- Where are the others?
- Canteen, they wanna kick it around.

303
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:14,552
- Perhaps it can wait till later?
- No, you go ahead.

304
00:22:14,718 --> 00:22:17,435
- I'd have lost you anyway.
- Thank you.

305
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:26,137
Goddamn it.

306
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:40,953
Doctor!

307
00:22:47,518 --> 00:22:49,460
- Come on!
- Double up, over here!

308
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,307
I'm sorry. We were looking for testing
sites and the bus got stuck.

309
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,365
You had a meeting last night.
You discussed the work in public.

310
00:22:57,534 --> 00:22:59,542
We were discussing
Neddermeyer's...

311
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:02,492
- In public!
- A table in the back of the canteen.

312
00:23:02,654 --> 00:23:06,232
- We were having a free discussion.
- Let's just talk about that.

313
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:09,627
I don't want free discussion.
I want compartmentalization.

314
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,467
I don't want theoreticians
knowing what engineers know.

315
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,946
- Listen to me...
- It is a security problem!

316
00:23:17,118 --> 00:23:20,598
These kids are used to pinning
their best ideas on a board.

317
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:24,312
Ideas are community property.
It's a matter of principle.

318
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,932
You force my hand and there
won't be any free discussion

319
00:23:28,094 --> 00:23:31,356
because there won't be anybody left
to have it!

320
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:35,541
If you'd been there you'd understand.
Neddermeyer's idea was brilliant.

321
00:23:35,743 --> 00:23:37,466
An explosion that goes inwards,

322
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,143
producing uniform compression
in a core and it'd be lightweight.

323
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,993
No gun barrel,
no velocity and weight problem.

324
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:46,678
And all of that
out of free discussion.

325
00:23:46,846 --> 00:23:49,301
You've got to give us room
to breathe.

326
00:23:51,134 --> 00:23:53,687
- Bronson?
- Sir?

327
00:23:53,854 --> 00:23:56,309
Just don't give it to the waitresses.

328
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:06,933
<i>Oppie's quite a match
for the general.</i>

329
00:24:07,134 --> 00:24:11,476
<i>I'm worried it's not in Groves' nature
to rest until he gets the upper hand.</i>

330
00:24:11,678 --> 00:24:13,718
<i>We're terrified the Germans
are ahead.</i>

331
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:17,596
<i>Working with restrictions
and regulations is setting us on edge.</i>

332
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:21,053
This is typical.
We are people, not numbers!

333
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:23,386
It's not part of the agreement,
general.

334
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,616
I apologize for complaints,
but barbed wire,

335
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:28,472
dogs, guards!

336
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:30,743
- Security badges!
- Secrets!

337
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,845
I hoped to leave these things in Italy
with Mussolini!

338
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,731
Openness is a principle
matter for scientists!

339
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:40,855
And there are many other things.
I resent my letters are being censored.

340
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:44,796
The FBI talking to me, that's one
thing. But my wife, my family,

341
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:47,828
that's a little much.
Don't you think?

342
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:51,097
We cannot continue work
under these conditions!

343
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:53,596
- Doctor.
- And what about...?

344
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:08,442
Well, that is some monkey house
in there.

345
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,037
A mess.
What are you gonna do about it?

346
00:25:11,198 --> 00:25:13,205
I warned you about this.

347
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,486
Look, you give me responsibility
for security inside the lab.

348
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:22,067
We go where we like, as we like,
when we like.

349
00:25:22,238 --> 00:25:24,627
Outside the lab, that's yours.

350
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,644
I will sell them on that.

351
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:34,910
I don't like it.
But I will live with it, for now.

352
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,084
<i>The 8th Air Force today</i>

353
00:25:44,286 --> 00:25:48,508
<i>carried out its heaviest bombing
of the war against Germany.</i>

354
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,987
Michael! Michael. What do you say?
Good to see you.

355
00:25:52,158 --> 00:25:54,908
- How are you?
- I brought Kathleen with me.

356
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,998
I was afraid this party would be
a little short on the beauty side,

357
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:03,574
so I took the appropriate precautions,
if you know what I'm saying.

358
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:07,868
- I mean, she is my favorite nurse.
- You two gonna get together?

359
00:26:09,886 --> 00:26:13,683
No. No, we're not.
Actually, I'm gonna get a drink.

360
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:18,938
That's what I'm gonna get. A good
stiff drink, that's all I'm gonna get.

361
00:26:22,174 --> 00:26:24,279
- Two bucks...
- It's a short bet.

362
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,248
- Like I said...
- This is stuck.

363
00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:31,480
...it can be pretty lonely here.

364
00:26:31,678 --> 00:26:33,434
There's a war on.

365
00:26:33,598 --> 00:26:36,500
Not everybody can go to Acapulco.

366
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:46,046
- Oh, my.
- Are you OK?

367
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:51,643
Good.
Thank you.

368
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:54,621
Look, they're perfect.

369
00:26:55,262 --> 00:26:57,979
Another minute,
they would have been overdone.

370
00:26:58,526 --> 00:27:00,697
Well, I'll put this in the sink.

371
00:27:00,862 --> 00:27:03,797
- Would you like some orange juice?
- Yes, kindly.

372
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:08,919
- I am sorry.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

373
00:27:09,342 --> 00:27:13,019
- This will be taken care of.
- It's OK.

374
00:27:14,622 --> 00:27:18,997
Anyway, I'm sure
we're going to be allies, general.

375
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,884
We're both trying to seduce
the same man.

376
00:27:27,774 --> 00:27:30,108
So is there a Mrs. Groves?

377
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,070
Yes, there is.

378
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:38,324
And she has the courage
to stay in the background.

379
00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:42,515
Some men are on the planet
for a purpose, Mrs. Oppenheimer.

380
00:27:42,686 --> 00:27:47,639
A good wife recognizes that
and is happy to smooth the way.

381
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:54,456
Read my theory
on degenerate matter, did you?

382
00:27:54,622 --> 00:27:57,469
It didn't generate
much enthusiasm elsewhere.

383
00:27:57,629 --> 00:28:01,306
But what do you think we'll find
at the end of the tunnel, Michael?

384
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:04,731
- A martini.
- Probably.

385
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:13,107
Hey!

386
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:28,121
<i>- Operator.
- Berkeley 5558, please.</i>

387
00:28:32,158 --> 00:28:35,092
Hello, Jean.
It's me.

388
00:28:35,262 --> 00:28:39,637
<i>- Jean, I know you're there.
- I'd given up waiting.</i>

389
00:28:40,477 --> 00:28:42,844
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to manage...

390
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:45,372
<i>Oppie, I've been so frightened.</i>

391
00:28:45,534 --> 00:28:48,501
<i>You don't phone. You don't write.
Not even a message.</i>

392
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,360
<i>- I can't.
- You can't?</i>

393
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:53,046
<i>No, Jean, I can't.</i>

394
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:54,773
<i>- Are you coming?
- Well...</i>

395
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:57,657
<i>- When are you coming?
- Jean.</i>

396
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:02,141
<i>This isn't talking.
This is just making noises.</i>

397
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:04,406
<i>Why don't we just grunt
at each other?</i>

398
00:29:04,573 --> 00:29:07,224
<i>- ''I gotta run. There's a war to win.''
- Jean.</i>

399
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,685
<i>I can't remember a day
I wasn't hurting, except with you.</i>

400
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:14,522
Jean, listen to me.
You've got to understand, please.

401
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:41,428
Yes?

402
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:45,147
I won't keep you, general.

403
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,870
Well, you better had.

404
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:49,940
Banging on my door
at 2:00 in the morning.

405
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,575
I had this typed up, sir.
I thought you'd wanna see it.

406
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:02,362
She's working him over, general.
I've seen this before.

407
00:30:02,525 --> 00:30:04,980
That grunting at each other,
could be a code.

408
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,412
- The cipher clerk said it's not code.
- Who is this woman?

409
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:11,836
Jean Tatlock, sir.
She's a known communist.

410
00:30:11,998 --> 00:30:14,202
Get me her background.

411
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:18,938
And maybe I am missing some stuff
on the good doctor.

412
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:20,989
- Get it for me.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,947
This must throw Oppenheimer's
position on this project into doubt, sir.

414
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:28,281
- Dr. Oppenheimer is the project.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:33,268
All due respect, sir, though, doesn't
this make him an unacceptable risk?

416
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,317
No! Failure's a risk.

417
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:41,847
The thing that concerns me is,
if he's with her, he's not with us.

418
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:48,953
It might be a good time
to put the screws to the doctor.

419
00:30:49,117 --> 00:30:52,151
Yes, sir. May I ask,
how do you intend to do that, sir?

420
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,652
No, colonel, you may not.

421
00:31:20,734 --> 00:31:23,996
- Compression not uniform.
- Stand by!

422
00:31:24,158 --> 00:31:27,736
If we had a thinner wall, we could
increase the compression, yes?

423
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:29,527
Seth, there's an answer here.

424
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:32,082
Oppie, maybe implosion's
just a blind alley.

425
00:31:32,286 --> 00:31:33,911
- Are we going again?
- Yes!

426
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:37,405
- That's an excuse for not thinking...
- We'll get reset.

427
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:43,446
All clear!
Reset the charges!

428
00:31:43,614 --> 00:31:46,331
Reset the charges!

429
00:31:46,494 --> 00:31:49,428
- We got all clear! Let's go!
- Let's move!

430
00:31:49,597 --> 00:31:53,656
- Move it!
- On the double! On the double! Go!

431
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:57,848
- Move it! Move it!
- Bring it in! Left side! Left side!

432
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,437
Come on!
Get the lead out!

433
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:03,223
On the double, guys!
Let's go!

434
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:05,820
Canyon to Los Alamos.

435
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:11,194
Come in, Los Alamos.

436
00:32:11,358 --> 00:32:13,398
Canyon to Los Alamos.

437
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:19,352
Come in, Los Alamos. Come in.

438
00:32:21,181 --> 00:32:24,891
- Something set off the detonators.
- Stay back! They're wired in series.

439
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:26,745
Get out of there!

440
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:34,067
- No, Oppie.
- Shit.

441
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,396
It's all right.

442
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:53,657
Take it easy, brother.

443
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:59,347
Thanks a lot.

444
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:02,966
Do me a favor.
Jump in the ambulance.

445
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:04,759
Let me give you
the once-over.

446
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:07,925
You guys are playing
with some funny stuff out here.

447
00:33:11,518 --> 00:33:13,460
Let's go. Start them up.

448
00:33:26,174 --> 00:33:28,508
Did they teach you that at high school?

449
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:31,861
You took a risk.

450
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:35,836
I ran out and grabbed the guy.
I didn't even think.

451
00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:38,900
- Just instinct.
- Instinct, huh?

452
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,321
You know, I wonder,
with this war...

453
00:33:43,518 --> 00:33:46,933
...if it's instinct to save a man,
what makes us want to kill one?

454
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:49,236
Is that instinct?

455
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,437
You sound like my old man.

456
00:33:53,662 --> 00:33:54,938
Why, what's he like?

457
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:57,272
- My old man?
- Yeah.

458
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:00,249
He's a preacher.

459
00:34:01,277 --> 00:34:03,285
In Jackson, Illinois.

460
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:07,958
And I got an older brother,
Jimmy, and he's a soldier.

461
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:10,100
My mom's dead.

462
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:13,914
I don't know, I guess he's kind of
hurt that I'm not at the front.

463
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:17,206
- Why?
- Well, Jackson is a small town.

464
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:20,635
- He said, ''Where you going?''
- I said, ''Santa Fe, New Mexico.''

465
00:34:20,798 --> 00:34:24,726
- I know.
- So that didn't quite hack it.

466
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:27,516
He said,
''lf you're not gonna be a soldier,

467
00:34:27,678 --> 00:34:30,067
''you better be a good scientist.
The best.''

468
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,976
- Are you the best?
- I was in Chicago.

469
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,762
But these guys are so bright.

470
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:40,252
Sometimes I feel like
I'm in over my head.

471
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:43,447
But I guess I can handle
anything they throw at me.

472
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,938
But can you dance?

473
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:48,563
Pardon me?

474
00:34:50,237 --> 00:34:52,441
I said, can you dance?

475
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:56,440
- Yeah.
- Well, do it.

476
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:59,860
- Are you serious?
- Can't handle it?

477
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:25,114
Very nice.

478
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:38,137
- Something like that.
- Very good.

479
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:03,572
Jean Tatlock, graduated in 1932.

480
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:06,872
They had a thing together
before Oppenheimer was married.

481
00:36:07,037 --> 00:36:08,564
Seems Tatlock ran off.

482
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:11,734
Things went on the back burner
between them till 1942.

483
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:13,527
Then it all started up again.

484
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:17,849
His associate said, ''lf the wife's
his ambition, Tatlock's his conscience.''

485
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:22,007
She introduced him to a number of
anti-fascist groups, anti-Franco groups

486
00:36:22,205 --> 00:36:23,634
and a number of communists.

487
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:25,048
- Bronson.
- Sir.

488
00:36:25,213 --> 00:36:28,791
Little less muscle on the gas here.
Colonel's starting a mission.

489
00:36:28,957 --> 00:36:30,167
I'd like him alive.

490
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:31,704
Yes, sir.

491
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,717
This makes Oppenheimer
a sitting duck for blackmail.

492
00:36:34,877 --> 00:36:37,179
I'm gonna insist on his removal.

493
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:39,643
No, you're not. Just relax.

494
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:44,246
You know, major, if you want
to lead a man in a certain direction,

495
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:46,901
you don't drag him by the nose.

496
00:36:47,453 --> 00:36:49,275
You just close off his options.

497
00:36:49,437 --> 00:36:51,542
Simple as a truck.

498
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:58,108
<i>Here we are in the top of the ninth.</i>

499
00:36:58,269 --> 00:37:00,636
<i>The Army down
to the Scientists by one run.</i>

500
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:05,334
<i>Dugan shakes it off.
Here's Merriman's pitch.</i>

501
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:07,094
<i>That's a hit.</i>

502
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:09,912
<i>Dugan digging for first base,
gonna go for two.</i>

503
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:13,493
<i>Look out. Here's the throw.
Safe at second base on a slide.</i>

504
00:37:13,662 --> 00:37:16,444
<i>Apple scores.
That ties the game.</i>

505
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:25,307
Yes?

506
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:28,691
Yes?!

507
00:37:32,702 --> 00:37:34,163
Bad time?

508
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:37,813
The velocity's still presenting us
with something of a problem.

509
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:44,760
Who's this bimbo
you're running around with?

510
00:37:46,237 --> 00:37:49,369
- What?
- Do I have to tell you?

511
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:52,570
I got it on the q.t.
from somebody who owes me.

512
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:54,773
What if the next guy
doesn't owe me?

513
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,494
Takes that kind of information
to the wrong guy?

514
00:37:57,693 --> 00:38:01,916
That could be the end of you.
Could be the end of this project.

515
00:38:03,101 --> 00:38:04,475
I don't understand you.

516
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:09,238
You think you're some kind
of bohemian or something.

517
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:14,898
Blind-sided.

518
00:38:16,062 --> 00:38:19,378
I never expected to get
blind-sided like this.

519
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:28,916
<i>And there it is.
A line drive.</i>

520
00:38:29,502 --> 00:38:33,757
Doctor, might I be of assistance?

521
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:37,233
What about me in all this?
This looks bad.

522
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:40,918
Reflects on me.
Reflects on my ability to choose men.

523
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,827
I was with this woman before
this project. This is not a new thing.

524
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:46,875
It's no matter.

525
00:38:47,486 --> 00:38:51,479
I am not comfortable with the idea
that you could sink me.

526
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,788
This is someone that I care about.

527
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,088
She's a communist.

528
00:39:01,534 --> 00:39:02,963
A communist.

529
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:05,339
Oh, my God.

530
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:08,054
It would be bad enough if she
were just some...

531
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,977
...sweet young thing from Indiana.

532
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:12,050
She's a card-carrying communist.

533
00:39:12,797 --> 00:39:17,053
And your job, classified job. What do
I have to do, draw you a map?

534
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:20,442
Get on the phone, a secure line,
tell her...goodbye!

535
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:22,328
<i>The pitch. It's a line drive!</i>

536
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:26,843
<i>It's out of there! It's gone!
Home run for Merriman.</i>

537
00:39:27,613 --> 00:39:28,889
Home run!

538
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:34,010
- It's all right, Bronson, we'll live.
- Yes, sir.

539
00:39:34,174 --> 00:39:36,562
<i>Well, that's it, folks,
Scientists win the game.</i>

540
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:38,259
It's in your court.

541
00:39:51,677 --> 00:39:54,841
Bridges, next time keep your head up.

542
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,582
<i>All hail the conquering hero.</i>

543
00:39:59,677 --> 00:40:02,361
<i>Pencil pushers defeat
the doughboys.</i>

544
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:51,031
Robert!

545
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:57,042
- Frank.
- Good to see you, bro.

546
00:40:58,045 --> 00:41:00,828
- Are we being followed or something?
- Don't joke.

547
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:02,898
I nearly asked you for your ID.

548
00:41:03,421 --> 00:41:06,869
- That's ridiculous.
- Let's just leave as soon as we can.

549
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:19,188
They've been hounding me
for names of every person I've known

550
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:20,918
who had communist sympathies.

551
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:25,115
They monitor every move I make.
They listen to my phone conversations.

552
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,739
Why stay?

553
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:28,796
There's an order to it.

554
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:31,827
An order in some part of my life,
at least.

555
00:41:31,997 --> 00:41:35,380
I'm sorry, I didn't get your message
till about 5.

556
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:40,371
I was still at the hospital, and I got
all whizzed up into a huge panic.

557
00:41:40,573 --> 00:41:42,166
You look wonderful.

558
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:44,918
You look so serious.
What's the matter?

559
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:49,242
I don't have much time.
I have to go back tonight.

560
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:50,866
Tonight?

561
00:41:51,037 --> 00:41:52,925
I cooked us dinner.

562
00:42:00,093 --> 00:42:02,515
This can't be about dinner, Jean.

563
00:42:04,637 --> 00:42:07,059
I didn't want to tell you
on the telephone.

564
00:42:08,285 --> 00:42:10,423
And that's why I'm here tonight.

565
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:21,238
Is it because of what you're doing?

566
00:42:30,237 --> 00:42:32,059
Fine.

567
00:42:32,861 --> 00:42:36,723
We're going to spill the blood
before we get to the cocktails.

568
00:42:49,437 --> 00:42:51,030
Jean?

569
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:56,017
Please...stay tonight.

570
00:42:56,957 --> 00:42:58,364
Please.

571
00:42:59,485 --> 00:43:01,045
Please.

572
00:43:03,964 --> 00:43:05,525
Please.

573
00:43:05,693 --> 00:43:07,994
Please.

574
00:43:31,837 --> 00:43:35,153
What you're working on,
it's something bad, isn't it?

575
00:43:35,325 --> 00:43:37,212
That's why you can't tell me.

576
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:39,958
I can't tell you
because it's a secret.

577
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,515
Tell me one good thing
that's a secret.

578
00:43:43,677 --> 00:43:45,500
We were a good thing.

579
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:48,082
No, we weren't.

580
00:43:48,285 --> 00:43:50,324
Not when you got married.

581
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:54,454
Give me up for something
I can understand.

582
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:57,010
Your wife or your child
or your conscience,

583
00:43:57,213 --> 00:43:58,871
something alive.

584
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:01,623
Not something
that you have to hide.

585
00:44:02,365 --> 00:44:03,859
Robert.

586
00:44:37,213 --> 00:44:40,148
Oh, Robert, I dreamt you'd gone.

587
00:44:47,197 --> 00:44:49,979
So that's what the silences were.

588
00:44:50,493 --> 00:44:52,860
No letters, no contact.

589
00:44:54,493 --> 00:44:57,013
I thought it was me,
something I'd done.

590
00:44:57,213 --> 00:45:01,271
- I've told you it has nothing to do...
- Yes, but you didn't tell me...

591
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:06,487
What is it you're working on?
What is so important?

592
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:09,042
That's right. It is important.

593
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:11,384
So don't be so goddamn arrogant.

594
00:45:11,548 --> 00:45:14,101
Is it arrogant to want
to know where you are?

595
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:17,979
What's happening to you? To want
to be close to you? To understand?

596
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,410
This was the man I loved.

597
00:45:23,965 --> 00:45:27,227
I loved his dreams.
I loved what he saw but couldn't prove.

598
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:30,040
I loved the goodness in him.

599
00:45:30,205 --> 00:45:33,783
He was my proof that the world
could be made better.

600
00:45:34,588 --> 00:45:37,010
And if he's dead, I don't want to live.

601
00:45:39,453 --> 00:45:43,064
The world is...different.

602
00:45:44,157 --> 00:45:46,393
It's just not what we
wanted it to be.

603
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:48,183
It's just not.

604
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:58,043
You mattered to me so much.

605
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:01,304
You really did.

606
00:46:13,629 --> 00:46:17,207
She told me that I had
a penchant for destruction.

607
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:19,514
That I'd lost faith.

608
00:46:20,316 --> 00:46:22,389
Is she wrong?

609
00:46:22,653 --> 00:46:24,246
No.

610
00:46:24,412 --> 00:46:25,787
She's not wrong.

611
00:46:28,669 --> 00:46:31,985
When this war's over, I want
to ride the mesa for six months.

612
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:33,617
No deadlines.

613
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,769
Nothing.

614
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:42,485
Thanks, Frank.

615
00:46:42,652 --> 00:46:44,660
He just kissed his brother.

616
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:46,651
Gotta be a communist.

617
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:04,340
Set that over there.

618
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:10,676
Look at it, Oppie, it's twisted.
It's got to be flat.

619
00:47:10,844 --> 00:47:15,067
I think implosion's nothing but a pipe
dream. I'm sorry I thought of it.

620
00:47:15,229 --> 00:47:16,789
I can't do it.

621
00:47:17,437 --> 00:47:21,081
Oppie, some way I have to focus...
I have to focus the shock waves.

622
00:47:21,437 --> 00:47:23,706
Look at me!
God, I'm running out of ideas.

623
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:27,644
That's an excuse for not thinking.
If you can't, I'll find somebody else.

624
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:30,838
Oppie? Serber needs
you back at the lab right now.

625
00:47:31,004 --> 00:47:32,914
- Oppie?
- You said it yourself.

626
00:47:33,085 --> 00:47:36,827
Focus. Somebody's working on a way
to focus an explosive shock wave.

627
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:39,672
- I'm gonna find him. Keep working.
- Jesus!

628
00:47:45,756 --> 00:47:49,848
You know, if Oppie doesn't let up,
he's going to implode.

629
00:48:02,076 --> 00:48:04,378
Inside. Inside.

630
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:11,953
Good news is the new plutonium
makes lots of neutrons.

631
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:15,866
But the bad news is the spontaneous
fission rate is way too high.

632
00:48:16,028 --> 00:48:19,640
The reaction will run away with itself.
There will just be a fizzle.

633
00:48:19,804 --> 00:48:22,838
- No explosion.
- You're certain of that, Edward?

634
00:48:23,004 --> 00:48:24,979
- Who did the calculations?
- Serber.

635
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:27,866
- Himself?
- Serber, personally.

636
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:32,661
So now plutonium is a problem. That
shifts the emphasis back to U-235.

637
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:36,757
Of course, Oak Ridge is not able
to produce that in sufficient quantity.

638
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:40,306
We must go with implosion, but
Neddermeyer has just announced to me

639
00:48:40,509 --> 00:48:43,825
that he and implosion
have just reached a brick wall.

640
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:48,759
We can't fall behind.

641
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,503
Are you all right, Oppie?

642
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:54,545
You have a deadline to meet.

643
00:48:56,157 --> 00:49:00,412
Banked almost a billion dollars on you
guys. That's not working on the cheap.

644
00:49:00,925 --> 00:49:03,259
Only thing I want to hear is, ''Yes, sir.''

645
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,381
Don't talk to me like I haven't given
eight days a week to this project.

646
00:49:07,581 --> 00:49:09,107
I've given up everything.

647
00:49:09,309 --> 00:49:11,196
Don't... Don't give me that.

648
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:13,394
I don't want to hear
that from the...

649
00:49:13,597 --> 00:49:15,320
I've given up everything.

650
00:49:15,484 --> 00:49:17,818
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

651
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,337
I don't give a goddamn
that travel was restricted.

652
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,013
It had to be done face to face,
and that's the way I did it.

653
00:49:30,525 --> 00:49:32,729
<i>Latest news
from the fighting front.</i>

654
00:49:35,356 --> 00:49:38,837
<i>American armies are pushing the
Germans back on their own territory.</i>

655
00:49:39,005 --> 00:49:40,434
<i>But fighting is desperate.</i>

656
00:49:40,637 --> 00:49:43,768
<i>The Germans are building up
for a massive counter thrust.</i>

657
00:49:43,932 --> 00:49:46,867
<i>Though the Allies are determined
to hold this new front...</i>

658
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:48,278
Who's the Lone Ranger?

659
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,452
Explosives wiz.
I don't know about Tonto.

660
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,076
<i>Neddermeyer gave up
on his explosion that goes in.</i>

661
00:49:53,244 --> 00:49:54,455
<i>Not Oppie, though.</i>

662
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:57,654
<i>He brought in two explosive
experts from the outside.</i>

663
00:49:57,853 --> 00:50:00,024
<i>We struggle on here
in our isolation.</i>

664
00:50:00,189 --> 00:50:03,287
<i>And sometimes the war
seems a long way away.</i>

665
00:50:08,413 --> 00:50:10,006
You want a ride, doc?

666
00:50:10,172 --> 00:50:13,336
Hey, Seth. When did you
get your driver's license?

667
00:50:16,828 --> 00:50:19,195
- You come to see the boys at play?
- Yes.

668
00:50:19,389 --> 00:50:21,560
- Oh, bad news, beautiful.
- Oh, no.

669
00:50:21,724 --> 00:50:24,179
I'm not gonna be able to make
that movie tonight.

670
00:50:24,476 --> 00:50:27,825
I can join you both for a drink.
It would make you happy.

671
00:50:27,996 --> 00:50:29,851
- Sound good?
- Perfect.

672
00:50:30,493 --> 00:50:32,664
Right, right.

673
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:36,626
Well, I promised the monkey
we'd be cutting a rug anyway.

674
00:50:36,796 --> 00:50:38,618
It's just as well.

675
00:50:39,293 --> 00:50:41,333
Michael, what's wrong with you?

676
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,341
Do you see much of him?

677
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,363
Yes, I like him.

678
00:50:50,269 --> 00:50:51,730
Are you jealous?

679
00:50:54,524 --> 00:50:55,734
Yeah.

680
00:50:57,981 --> 00:50:59,769
You better do something about it.

681
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:15,987
Tell them I ain't buying.
White House said

682
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:18,906
there wouldn't be
any account till after the war.

683
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:23,065
It's so damn tough
to get through to you,

684
00:51:23,228 --> 00:51:25,367
I decided to bring
you my problem.

685
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:28,762
See the tread on that tire?
Because I sure as hell don't.

686
00:51:28,924 --> 00:51:31,346
Yet that's what my men
are riding around on.

687
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:35,796
I don't know what kind of deal
you got yourself into, Groves,

688
00:51:35,964 --> 00:51:38,550
but I do care when it cuts
in on my territory.

689
00:51:38,717 --> 00:51:42,230
If I'm gonna move supplies around
the country, I need trucks.

690
00:51:42,397 --> 00:51:44,371
Those trucks run on tires, Dick.

691
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:48,533
When I hear they ain't moving because
of some tire shortage, I get mad.

692
00:51:48,732 --> 00:51:51,514
When I hear you're the cause
of it, I want to kill.

693
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:55,451
- We gotta work something...
- No dice. We got a triple-A priority.

694
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:58,645
White House authority.
We need the product.

695
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,994
You need to know something.

696
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:05,434
You're getting a lot
of people's backs up.

697
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,501
Let me remind you of something else.
See this?

698
00:52:08,669 --> 00:52:09,978
I count two. You got one.

699
00:52:10,653 --> 00:52:13,435
When this war's over,
that will amount to something.

700
00:52:17,084 --> 00:52:19,767
And, Dick, I hope you get my meaning.

701
00:52:19,964 --> 00:52:22,452
Because, by all that's holy...

702
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,209
...you better have
your ass well-covered.

703
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,940
- Well, Bronson.
- Sir?

704
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,017
- It's all about ass, isn't it?
- Sir?

705
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,602
You kick it or you lick it.

706
00:52:43,772 --> 00:52:45,911
That's what it's all about.

707
00:52:46,492 --> 00:52:48,532
I'm sorry about
my language, Bronson.

708
00:52:48,701 --> 00:52:50,326
But I'm on the limb.

709
00:52:51,581 --> 00:52:53,817
My prima donnas
better come through...

710
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:57,042
...or you are looking
at a piece of dead meat.

711
00:52:57,564 --> 00:52:58,775
Yes, sir.

712
00:53:09,756 --> 00:53:12,123
- What's this?
- I don't know, sir.

713
00:53:12,604 --> 00:53:13,978
God, almighty.

714
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,831
Is this a stop?

715
00:53:15,996 --> 00:53:18,614
What time is it?
There's no scheduled stop here.

716
00:53:28,253 --> 00:53:30,391
Message for General Groves.

717
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:35,409
- I'll see what the problem is, sir.
- Message for General Groves.

718
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,678
- Message for General Groves.
- In this way.

719
00:53:44,412 --> 00:53:46,681
General Groves, sir.
This is from Germany.

720
00:53:46,844 --> 00:53:50,227
It was flown in. We wired
ahead to have the train stopped.

721
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:52,252
Excuse me, gentlemen.

722
00:54:06,428 --> 00:54:09,046
- Colonel.
- General.

723
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,195
Put it in my safe, in the back.

724
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,047
Don't bring it out.

725
00:54:19,932 --> 00:54:22,682
That means the Germans don't
have the bomb. Weren't close.

726
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:25,844
Sir, is it wise?
I mean, suppressing this?

727
00:54:27,036 --> 00:54:28,945
Well, you tell me, colonel.

728
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,415
It's delicate stuff.

729
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,118
I'm talking about my longhairs,
my prima donnas.

730
00:54:36,284 --> 00:54:37,844
The Jewish element.

731
00:54:38,556 --> 00:54:42,647
Take Hitler out of the equation...
they might just run out of stink.

732
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:44,722
Why chance it?

733
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,849
We can give this country
the biggest stick in the playground.

734
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,743
And I intend to do that.

735
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,443
And I'll tell you something
about our bunch.

736
00:54:55,612 --> 00:54:57,041
Get them close.

737
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:00,087
Then they'll go all the way.

738
00:55:01,437 --> 00:55:03,259
They're just not close enough yet.

739
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,947
Yes, sir.

740
00:55:12,572 --> 00:55:16,434
Perhaps you should think of these
wedges as forming part of a shell.

741
00:55:16,764 --> 00:55:21,718
They do redirect the shock waves in
the same way as a lens redirects light.

742
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:25,365
As a matter of interest, we've
already used the idea in England

743
00:55:25,533 --> 00:55:27,671
for armor-piercing shells.

744
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:33,714
Pray it works.
We'll be back on schedule.

745
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:35,258
Heads up.

746
00:55:36,316 --> 00:55:37,461
Watch your backs.

747
00:56:02,844 --> 00:56:05,691
No one ever used high explosives...

748
00:56:05,853 --> 00:56:09,082
...as a precision instrument before.

749
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:11,126
It's so simple.

750
00:56:11,292 --> 00:56:14,641
It just swings the shock waves
from convex to concave.

751
00:56:14,812 --> 00:56:17,714
- Some orange, hey, Oppie?
- No, after the explosion.

752
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,853
Dr. Oppenheimer.

753
00:56:25,436 --> 00:56:26,646
Dr. Oppenheimer.

754
00:56:26,812 --> 00:56:28,056
A letter for you, sir.

755
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,675
- They said it was important.
- Thank you.

756
00:57:23,836 --> 00:57:25,745
Good luck.

757
00:57:41,844 --> 00:57:44,178
<i>We squeezed it!
Damn it, we got compression!</i>

758
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:47,089
<i>We're on the way!
The right mix and we're home, Oppie!</i>

759
00:57:47,252 --> 00:57:49,618
<i>We're home free, vindicated!
We're vindicated!</i>

760
00:57:49,779 --> 00:57:52,681
- We got a ball game here.
- Seth, come here!

761
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:55,435
Next stop, implosion!

762
00:58:23,984 --> 00:58:26,286
Can I come in?

763
00:58:26,864 --> 00:58:28,587
Where is he?

764
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:30,377
He's out back.

765
00:58:30,992 --> 00:58:33,893
Sitting in the sun
with a blanket on his lap.

766
00:58:34,735 --> 00:58:37,517
Nursing a guilty dick, no doubt.

767
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,966
It is not necessary to be vulgar.

768
00:58:43,246 --> 00:58:45,514
Nothing I say could
approach the vulgarity

769
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,914
of what you're building
in your back yard.

770
00:58:50,221 --> 00:58:53,517
Well, vulgar or not...

771
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,070
...I need him to come
through on this.

772
00:58:56,237 --> 00:59:00,011
He owes it to his country.
He owes it to himself.

773
00:59:00,876 --> 00:59:04,324
He is the best there is. And he
should have whatever he wants.

774
00:59:04,493 --> 00:59:08,006
Don't try to recruit me, general.
You don't need my help.

775
00:59:08,365 --> 00:59:12,258
And spare me your homily on being
a good wife. I know it by heart.

776
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,841
Why did you put up with her
for so long?

777
00:59:17,004 --> 00:59:20,832
Because he's the best there is.
He should have whatever he wants.

778
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,329
I don't live very well alone.

779
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:29,800
Some people don't.

780
00:59:30,315 --> 00:59:33,445
We all have different ways
of defending our territory.

781
00:59:38,122 --> 00:59:42,464
Concha, you're late.
Peter, hurry up. Didn't I say 2:00?

782
00:59:49,672 --> 00:59:51,134
I'm sorry.

783
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:58,597
And I am sorry that the news
took so long to get to you.

784
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,029
It just got lost
in the system censors.

785
01:00:02,728 --> 01:00:03,938
You know...

786
01:00:06,247 --> 01:00:09,923
...you can't be responsible
for keeping somebody else alive.

787
01:00:11,303 --> 01:00:13,855
It isn't possible.
It's not to be expected.

788
01:00:14,759 --> 01:00:17,180
I can't work on this anymore.

789
01:00:24,229 --> 01:00:25,920
I don't want to.

790
01:00:27,174 --> 01:00:28,734
And I don't need to.

791
01:00:28,902 --> 01:00:30,941
Germany is finished.

792
01:00:31,781 --> 01:00:35,043
It's just a matter of time.
They can't pull this together.

793
01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:38,491
- You sure?
- I don't want to hear your arguments.

794
01:00:40,133 --> 01:00:43,034
I already know that everything is a risk.

795
01:00:43,204 --> 01:00:45,659
That the war is not over until it's over.

796
01:00:45,828 --> 01:00:48,861
That they're lobbing rockets
all over London.

797
01:00:49,028 --> 01:00:52,290
That Germany is desperate.
That she's resourceful.

798
01:00:52,484 --> 01:00:55,200
If she doesn't get a device,
she could litter England

799
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:58,624
with radioactive material.
We thought of something similar.

800
01:00:58,787 --> 01:01:00,641
The fact of the matter is...

801
01:01:00,803 --> 01:01:03,869
...they're not as good as we are.
Or are they?

802
01:01:09,986 --> 01:01:12,125
Christ, I've got rats in my skull.

803
01:01:15,554 --> 01:01:19,099
I'm being asked to throw too many
balls in the air at the same time.

804
01:01:22,081 --> 01:01:24,666
When I feel like that,
I get down on my knees...

805
01:01:26,401 --> 01:01:27,677
...and I pray.

806
01:01:28,992 --> 01:01:31,000
And that's how I get conviction.

807
01:01:31,808 --> 01:01:35,321
If you let this slip through your fingers,
through our fingers,

808
01:01:35,488 --> 01:01:37,179
and somebody else gets it...

809
01:01:38,656 --> 01:01:41,819
...you won't be counting how many
balls you throw in the air.

810
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:49,724
If you need the fire, you find it.

811
01:01:50,814 --> 01:01:52,407
Wherever.

812
01:02:00,414 --> 01:02:01,843
<i>At last, some good news.</i>

813
01:02:02,045 --> 01:02:06,103
<i>Apparently, sufficient uranium is
beginning to arrive from Oak Ridge.</i>

814
01:02:06,269 --> 01:02:10,099
<i>But, as brilliant as he is, Oppie's
beginning to show the strain.</i>

815
01:02:10,781 --> 01:02:12,210
<i>We all depend on Oppie.</i>

816
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:14,268
<i>He's our inspiration.</i>

817
01:02:14,428 --> 01:02:17,243
<i>If he were to crack, we'd all fall apart.</i>

818
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:22,450
Beautiful, isn't it, Michael?
Just think...

819
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,914
...a few miles closer to the sun,
a few miles farther away,

820
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,694
none of this would be here.
Just a cloud of gas

821
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:31,193
or a block of ice
and nobody to enjoy it.

822
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:34,674
''Odi et amor'',
''I hate and I love.''

823
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,209
- Catullus. Do you know it?
- No.

824
01:02:39,706 --> 01:02:43,448
<i>I hate and I love
Why, you ask? I don't know</i>

825
01:02:44,314 --> 01:02:47,991
<i>I feel both
And I'm in agony</i>

826
01:02:49,114 --> 01:02:53,718
Maybe General Groves is right. Maybe
we should just banish thinking forever.

827
01:02:57,497 --> 01:02:59,984
Michael, we have to test
the critical mass.

828
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,309
- Are you going to help?
- Of course.

829
01:03:05,272 --> 01:03:07,411
I want to show you something.

830
01:03:24,726 --> 01:03:27,793
Come here to see our little toy, huh?

831
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:33,968
Michael, that's what we call
tickling the dragon's tail.

832
01:03:34,166 --> 01:03:37,613
So a slug of uranium
about two by six inches

833
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,269
will be pulled by this weight.

834
01:03:40,694 --> 01:03:44,752
It begins here, then accelerates
at 32 feet per second per second.

835
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:48,691
It passes between uranium bricks.
We have an instant of criticality.

836
01:03:48,852 --> 01:03:52,016
For a split second,
we have a chain reaction.

837
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:55,147
As close as we come
to an atomic explosion in the lab.

838
01:03:55,316 --> 01:03:57,455
- Without blowing up.
- Exactly.

839
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:01,362
It's essential to determine the amount
of material the device needs.

840
01:04:01,524 --> 01:04:04,393
Ten years ago I could
hardly imagine the stuff.

841
01:04:04,596 --> 01:04:06,003
Ten years.

842
01:04:06,164 --> 01:04:10,025
Each molecule collected
out of the air, one by one.

843
01:04:12,979 --> 01:04:14,505
Hello?

844
01:04:16,211 --> 01:04:17,421
What?

845
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:30,890
<i>I have the rare privilege
of speaking for a victorious army</i>

846
01:04:31,058 --> 01:04:33,129
<i>of almost five million fighting men.</i>

847
01:04:33,297 --> 01:04:35,980
<i>They and the women
who have so ably assisted them</i>

848
01:04:36,177 --> 01:04:38,566
<i>constitute the Allied
Expeditionary Force</i>

849
01:04:38,768 --> 01:04:41,103
<i>that has liberated Western Europe.</i>

850
01:04:41,265 --> 01:04:43,686
<i>They have destroyed
or captured enemy armies</i>

851
01:04:43,888 --> 01:04:45,960
<i>totaling more than their own strength</i>

852
01:04:46,128 --> 01:04:49,576
<i>and swept triumphantly forward
over the hundreds of miles</i>

853
01:04:49,743 --> 01:04:51,566
<i>separating Cherbourg from Lbeck,</i>

854
01:04:51,728 --> 01:04:52,972
<i>Leipzig and Munich.</i>

855
01:04:53,136 --> 01:04:55,655
<i>These startling successes
have not been bought</i>

856
01:04:55,823 --> 01:04:57,481
<i>without sorrow and suffering.</i>

857
01:04:57,647 --> 01:05:00,364
<i>In this theater alone,
80,000 Americans</i>

858
01:05:00,527 --> 01:05:02,632
<i>and comparable numbers
among the allies</i>

859
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,621
<i>have had their lives cut short</i>

860
01:05:04,782 --> 01:05:09,124
<i>so that the rest of us might live
in the sunlight of freedom.</i>

861
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,445
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

862
01:05:21,612 --> 01:05:23,979
What are we gonna do
when this is over?

863
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,245
I don't know.
Probably start another one.

864
01:05:26,412 --> 01:05:30,437
That's what I love about this job.
A guaranteed future. I'm not wrong.

865
01:05:30,603 --> 01:05:34,116
Believe me, we're descended
from a long line of noble predators.

866
01:05:34,795 --> 01:05:36,202
You are irrepressible.

867
01:05:36,715 --> 01:05:39,749
I think I'm gonna go be
irrepressible down with Fuller.

868
01:05:39,947 --> 01:05:41,637
Come on, baby face.

869
01:05:43,275 --> 01:05:46,242
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm irrepressible.

870
01:05:46,666 --> 01:05:48,073
So, what are you writing?

871
01:05:48,267 --> 01:05:50,471
Something Oppie said today.
I don't know.

872
01:05:50,635 --> 01:05:52,391
Well, read it. Go on.

873
01:05:55,561 --> 01:05:57,896
Makes you wonder
if there's an intelligence

874
01:05:58,058 --> 01:06:00,873
that isn't descended
from a long line of predators.

875
01:06:03,306 --> 01:06:04,930
I want to kiss you.

876
01:06:05,897 --> 01:06:07,326
Come here.

877
01:06:13,225 --> 01:06:17,381
Sir, is it true that since we KO'd
Germany, we're gonna go home?

878
01:06:17,544 --> 01:06:20,610
- I'll drink to that.
- That might be true, soldier.

879
01:06:24,488 --> 01:06:27,074
Can I have your attention, please?
Please.

880
01:06:27,432 --> 01:06:28,642
Excuse me.

881
01:06:28,807 --> 01:06:32,603
Seems to me that we have a shortage
of dance partners on the floor.

882
01:06:32,775 --> 01:06:35,164
So as a tribute
to our men in uniform...

883
01:06:36,551 --> 01:06:38,885
...l'd like to make
available the services

884
01:06:39,047 --> 01:06:42,112
of all the longhairs at Los Alamos
on this dance floor.

885
01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:45,126
And to break
the ceremonial ice,

886
01:06:45,286 --> 01:06:48,450
I will choose
the first dance partner.

887
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:58,080
General Groves...
may I have this dance?

888
01:07:00,709 --> 01:07:02,464
Why not?

889
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:33,601
- Why do you have that with you?
- I keep it as a record for my dad.

890
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:36,632
If I wrote him a letter,
all he'd get is black lines.

891
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,972
This way I can tell him
what's going on.

892
01:07:39,137 --> 01:07:41,406
And what are you gonna
write about today?

893
01:07:42,945 --> 01:07:44,734
Besides the war being over?

894
01:07:44,897 --> 01:07:46,107
Yeah.

895
01:07:47,937 --> 01:07:51,449
Well, I met this girl.

896
01:07:55,008 --> 01:07:57,048
Did I just kiss you up there?

897
01:08:04,191 --> 01:08:07,540
You gotta bring your heads in out
of the clouds. Out of the clouds.

898
01:08:09,184 --> 01:08:12,216
Keep the muttering to a minimum,
please, gentlemen.

899
01:08:13,854 --> 01:08:16,604
Some of you dancing...

900
01:08:16,766 --> 01:08:18,773
...close together.

901
01:08:18,942 --> 01:08:22,771
I don't like the look of it.

902
01:08:23,326 --> 01:08:28,214
There are...bosoms in the area.

903
01:08:29,469 --> 01:08:33,146
And this could lead to pregnancy.

904
01:08:33,629 --> 01:08:37,076
Any man getting caught out of hand
or getting caught in hand

905
01:08:37,244 --> 01:08:40,146
will have to turn their peckers
over to the FBI.

906
01:08:48,187 --> 01:08:51,220
They're having fun. That's nice.
They're entitled.

907
01:08:52,539 --> 01:08:55,386
- So long as they don't think it's over.
- Isn't it?

908
01:08:56,987 --> 01:08:59,255
I mean,
what's all the celebration for?

909
01:08:59,706 --> 01:09:02,967
Perhaps we can find
some other use for this work.

910
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:04,308
Fascism's dead.

911
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:06,132
You mean in Europe.

912
01:09:06,298 --> 01:09:09,265
What do they think Japan
is doing, shooting squirrels?

913
01:09:09,434 --> 01:09:12,946
No, they're not shooting squirrels,
and that's not the issue.

914
01:09:13,657 --> 01:09:15,031
What is the issue?

915
01:09:15,897 --> 01:09:19,443
They don't have the technology.
They're not capable of it.

916
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:21,518
So if we don't need it...

917
01:09:21,688 --> 01:09:23,030
...why make it?

918
01:09:24,153 --> 01:09:25,909
I want you to look at something.

919
01:09:26,744 --> 01:09:30,454
It's the largest collection
of nothing in the entire world.

920
01:09:32,312 --> 01:09:34,100
Make them work...

921
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,330
...and you've got something.

922
01:09:38,071 --> 01:09:40,144
An irresistible something.

923
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:41,937
Just the threat...

924
01:09:43,448 --> 01:09:45,137
...and they're ours.

925
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:49,169
You know, sometimes,

926
01:09:49,334 --> 01:09:50,894
just standing here,

927
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:52,917
I keep wondering.

928
01:09:53,494 --> 01:09:56,723
Are we working on them
or are they working on us?

929
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:01,972
Give them dignity, doctor.
Then we can start talking...

930
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,852
...about who can do what...

931
01:10:07,254 --> 01:10:09,424
...and what they mean.

932
01:10:28,755 --> 01:10:31,121
Oh, what time is it?

933
01:10:36,178 --> 01:10:40,521
Even when I sleep, it's like dogs
tearing at a piece of meat.

934
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:43,563
Robert?

935
01:10:45,201 --> 01:10:47,176
Thinking of resigning?

936
01:10:47,346 --> 01:10:49,036
No.

937
01:10:51,762 --> 01:10:53,485
I'd be written off.

938
01:10:53,648 --> 01:10:57,129
They wouldn't understand.
Not in the present climate.

939
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:03,950
I keep obsessing about the device.

940
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:07,623
Yes, it's true, but...

941
01:11:09,871 --> 01:11:11,813
...if you think beyond...

942
01:11:13,072 --> 01:11:16,585
...it's a limitless supply of energy.
Think about it, Kitty.

943
01:11:17,423 --> 01:11:20,106
The power that drives the universe.

944
01:11:22,959 --> 01:11:25,097
It's beyond imagination, really.

945
01:11:25,262 --> 01:11:26,855
And we'd have tamed it.

946
01:11:29,357 --> 01:11:31,081
A new world.

947
01:11:40,205 --> 01:11:41,612
Go get them, cowboy.

948
01:11:56,235 --> 01:11:57,861
What's going on over there?

949
01:11:58,028 --> 01:12:01,737
Cattle destroyed the entire ground
cable run. Ruined two days' work.

950
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:08,294
Why didn't they herd them outside
the site? Anyone suggest that?

951
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:13,160
The ranchers wouldn't move them.
Seems the Army stopped negotiating.

952
01:12:18,313 --> 01:12:21,379
- This is out of control.
- Edward, these estimates...

953
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:24,447
Rush, push, speed, deadlines.

954
01:12:24,618 --> 01:12:27,300
This whole project
has gotten out of control.

955
01:12:27,464 --> 01:12:30,432
We haven't thought about
the consequences, Oppie.

956
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:32,194
- Oppie?
- Wilson!

957
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,143
We've been waiting
for the data for two weeks.

958
01:12:35,305 --> 01:12:37,247
When are we gonna get it?

959
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:42,338
Wilson is correct.

960
01:12:42,504 --> 01:12:45,821
We have to talk about what we're
all thinking but not saying.

961
01:12:46,024 --> 01:12:49,090
This argument is arcane, Edward.

962
01:12:49,255 --> 01:12:51,043
This thing is becoming real.

963
01:12:51,206 --> 01:12:54,622
It's going to affect lives,
thousands of lives.

964
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:56,830
We have to start to talk.

965
01:12:56,999 --> 01:12:59,716
All right. But not here.

966
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:02,813
At my home tonight.

967
01:13:11,813 --> 01:13:14,333
<i>So now we tickle
the tail of the dragon.</i>

968
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:16,289
All right, take her up.

969
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:20,772
<i>I can only hope the uranium
slug doesn't get stuck in the pile.</i>

970
01:13:20,933 --> 01:13:23,998
<i>If it does,
we'll probably all evaporate.</i>

971
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:27,042
- What's the reading?
- 1 .19-K.

972
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:31,714
- Waiting on your word.
- Meter's ready.

973
01:13:31,876 --> 01:13:33,152
Ready when you are.

974
01:13:35,555 --> 01:13:37,148
Let's go.

975
01:13:37,315 --> 01:13:38,657
OK, let's tickle it.

976
01:13:46,531 --> 01:13:48,318
It burst. It burst.

977
01:13:48,738 --> 01:13:50,626
It burst right from here.

978
01:13:51,362 --> 01:13:53,370
All right, add it up.

979
01:13:53,538 --> 01:13:55,131
Cigarette break.

980
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:57,177
Good job.

981
01:14:06,913 --> 01:14:09,499
Michael. Hey, Michael.
You got a moment?

982
01:14:09,665 --> 01:14:12,795
They won't let me in this place.
Still going to Chicago?

983
01:14:12,992 --> 01:14:14,967
Yeah, Frisch can't pick the slugs up.

984
01:14:15,168 --> 01:14:18,877
Great. There's something we'd
like you to pick up, if you can.

985
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,909
You know Leo Szilard, right?
And Ralph Lapp?

986
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:25,113
Well, about 20 of our other
colleagues from Chicago,

987
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:29,240
they're proposing a petition stating
they're opposed to the device.

988
01:14:30,463 --> 01:14:33,626
They're concerned about
what they think's gonna happen.

989
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:38,776
So am I. I got a brother who's
in the Philippines right now.

990
01:14:38,942 --> 01:14:41,081
I read the papers. I'm concerned.

991
01:14:41,246 --> 01:14:44,987
I'm not asking you to endorse
anything. I haven't even read it yet.

992
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:48,663
It should be discussed.
All I'm asking is pick it up,

993
01:14:48,829 --> 01:14:52,244
let us peruse it and make up
our own minds. How tough is that?

994
01:14:52,413 --> 01:14:54,485
- Makes sense.
- It's only fair.

995
01:14:54,653 --> 01:14:56,082
I'll pick it up for you.

996
01:14:56,893 --> 01:14:58,780
- See you later.
- OK.

997
01:15:00,604 --> 01:15:02,993
How can you rationalize
premeditated murder?

998
01:15:03,164 --> 01:15:05,465
Oh, bullshit. Premeditated murder?

999
01:15:05,628 --> 01:15:08,475
- This is a war. It's about winning.
- At what cost?

1000
01:15:08,635 --> 01:15:11,090
You can't just outlaw a weapon.

1001
01:15:11,259 --> 01:15:14,106
The more effective,
the more likely it will be used.

1002
01:15:14,267 --> 01:15:16,602
We didn't use poison gas.
That was stopped.

1003
01:15:16,795 --> 01:15:19,697
You got to speak up.
The generals won't listen to us.

1004
01:15:19,898 --> 01:15:24,153
Yeah, and speak up on behalf
of all those kids hiding in foxholes.

1005
01:15:24,314 --> 01:15:27,610
I know what they'd say. The
Japanese brought this on themselves.

1006
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:29,526
They have themselves to blame.

1007
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:32,340
I wouldn't care if the place
went up in smoke...

1008
01:15:32,506 --> 01:15:34,775
Excuse me,
just for a minute, gentlemen.

1009
01:15:36,409 --> 01:15:38,547
And I resent your suggesting

1010
01:15:38,713 --> 01:15:40,655
I don't recognize a moral argument.

1011
01:15:40,825 --> 01:15:44,119
Why are you still awake?
Aren't you supposed to be sleeping?

1012
01:15:44,281 --> 01:15:48,241
- I don't like sleeping.
- There are lots of things we don't like.

1013
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:52,335
We have to do them if we
want to do the things we do like.

1014
01:15:52,536 --> 01:15:55,437
- What's the treat tomorrow?
- Go horseback riding.

1015
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:59,600
That's right. Now, how are you
going to ride a great big horse

1016
01:15:59,767 --> 01:16:01,677
if you don't get plenty of rest?

1017
01:16:01,847 --> 01:16:03,473
Go to sleep for Daddy?

1018
01:16:04,407 --> 01:16:05,780
That's a good boy.

1019
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,998
It is hot.

1020
01:16:15,478 --> 01:16:18,674
We could go to Carlucci's,
get some ice coffee and donuts.

1021
01:16:18,838 --> 01:16:20,812
The project is beginning to unravel.

1022
01:16:21,014 --> 01:16:23,567
- What?
- There have always been questions.

1023
01:16:23,765 --> 01:16:27,540
We've always avoided the answers.
Now, everything is coming to a head.

1024
01:16:28,469 --> 01:16:30,094
- Bronson?
- Sir?

1025
01:16:30,261 --> 01:16:32,432
- Stop the car.
- Yes, sir.

1026
01:16:32,596 --> 01:16:35,945
- Get out, take a leak or something.
- This is a public park.

1027
01:16:36,117 --> 01:16:39,378
Well, pick some flowers.
I want to do some shouting.

1028
01:16:47,988 --> 01:16:49,264
It's a crisis.

1029
01:16:49,427 --> 01:16:51,151
A crisis of conscience.

1030
01:16:53,043 --> 01:16:55,148
All right. I'm not shouting.

1031
01:16:55,923 --> 01:16:57,810
I'm not even angry.

1032
01:16:58,418 --> 01:17:00,622
I am just stumped.

1033
01:17:02,643 --> 01:17:04,780
You want to sit on your hands,

1034
01:17:04,945 --> 01:17:06,506
polish your conscience,

1035
01:17:06,674 --> 01:17:11,016
when we might be able to end
this whole thing with one shot?

1036
01:17:12,401 --> 01:17:14,124
Crisis of conscience, huh?

1037
01:17:14,289 --> 01:17:15,717
All right.

1038
01:17:15,888 --> 01:17:17,098
Have it.

1039
01:17:17,264 --> 01:17:18,857
Take a bath in it.

1040
01:17:19,024 --> 01:17:20,234
Soak in it.

1041
01:17:21,329 --> 01:17:24,078
Then tell me whether you're
going to deliver them.

1042
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,660
Whether you're gonna finish this job.

1043
01:17:26,863 --> 01:17:31,053
You tell me how I'm gonna face
a senate inquiry

1044
01:17:31,215 --> 01:17:35,471
and say we spent two billion dollars
on a show that's never gonna open.

1045
01:17:36,432 --> 01:17:37,992
Crisis of conscience.

1046
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:42,567
You got one job, doctor.
Give me the bomb. Just give it to me.

1047
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:45,348
Atrocious things have been done
in Germany

1048
01:17:45,519 --> 01:17:47,940
because people didn't speak out.

1049
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:52,103
And we blame them for it. Right,
I think, even though it was dangerous.

1050
01:17:52,269 --> 01:17:54,920
But it's not dangerous
for us to speak out.

1051
01:17:55,086 --> 01:17:57,257
That's what a lot of us in Chicago feel.

1052
01:17:57,454 --> 01:18:00,749
You don't have to agree
with the contents of this petition.

1053
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,177
You have to agree
it should be discussed.

1054
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:05,446
- Yes, sir.
- Good boy, Michael.

1055
01:18:06,828 --> 01:18:08,421
Good seeing you again.

1056
01:18:37,577 --> 01:18:39,301
- It came in on the wire.
- What?

1057
01:18:39,466 --> 01:18:43,459
Japanese are feeling out terms for
surrender. They made a proposition.

1058
01:18:43,626 --> 01:18:46,473
What kind of surrender?
Not unconditional?

1059
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:48,487
Not according to my sources, no.

1060
01:18:48,648 --> 01:18:50,023
Good.

1061
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:52,007
No one will buy it.

1062
01:18:52,488 --> 01:18:55,139
- Sir?
- Nothing.

1063
01:18:55,305 --> 01:18:58,339
Come on. Come on. Right here.

1064
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:03,327
Mr. Secretary, a brutal question.

1065
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,051
Are you and the president

1066
01:19:06,216 --> 01:19:07,525
looking to Russia,

1067
01:19:07,688 --> 01:19:11,102
figuring they'll come into Japan,
assuming there's an invasion?

1068
01:19:11,271 --> 01:19:14,021
If you are, you're not
gonna get that for nothing.

1069
01:19:14,183 --> 01:19:17,478
Russia's gonna want
Manchuria, Sakhalin.

1070
01:19:17,959 --> 01:19:20,414
I can give the president Japan.

1071
01:19:21,607 --> 01:19:23,461
No invasion, no deals.

1072
01:19:23,813 --> 01:19:25,123
Can you guarantee that?

1073
01:19:25,286 --> 01:19:27,936
Some of your scientists
are getting out of line.

1074
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:30,971
I hear they've been maneuvering
to see the president.

1075
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:32,483
I didn't know that.

1076
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:34,785
I will take care of it.

1077
01:19:34,981 --> 01:19:38,658
- Very well. Do that, general.
- Mr. Secretary.

1078
01:19:38,821 --> 01:19:40,511
Good night.

1079
01:19:43,525 --> 01:19:45,247
Panton?

1080
01:19:47,044 --> 01:19:48,451
Dr. Oppenheimer had...

1081
01:19:49,508 --> 01:19:53,883
...on three separate occasions,
meetings with suspected agents,

1082
01:19:54,052 --> 01:19:55,874
communists, whatever.

1083
01:19:56,036 --> 01:19:58,424
- He gave us one name, correct?
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:19:58,595 --> 01:20:00,700
Press him on the others.

1085
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:04,635
- He needs to feel the branch creak.
- Yes, sir.

1086
01:20:04,835 --> 01:20:06,722
- Ready?
- Yeah, we're ready.

1087
01:20:11,649 --> 01:20:14,399
They told me you were down here.
I was having lunch.

1088
01:20:14,562 --> 01:20:17,628
I got a call from Captain Panton.
A security problem again.

1089
01:20:17,794 --> 01:20:20,543
Well, I'm being harassed,
and I'm sick of it.

1090
01:20:20,705 --> 01:20:23,552
I had a security clearance.
This was a dead issue.

1091
01:20:23,713 --> 01:20:26,430
It's never dead with you.

1092
01:20:26,593 --> 01:20:30,270
Though I will try to put a lid on it.
This is not gonna help.

1093
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:33,370
- What's this?
- Some kind of petition

1094
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:38,107
from your boys in Chicago trying to go
around us to see the president.

1095
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,789
That will never happen.

1096
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,764
Do you know about this?

1097
01:20:46,687 --> 01:20:48,542
About the ideas, yes.

1098
01:20:48,703 --> 01:20:51,802
They want to demonstrate
the device, not use it.

1099
01:20:51,967 --> 01:20:54,649
Is it containable?

1100
01:20:54,814 --> 01:20:56,919
Can you stop it?

1101
01:20:59,614 --> 01:21:02,647
My hash is getting cold upstairs.

1102
01:21:02,814 --> 01:21:05,432
- Don't let these dodos distract you.
- How can...?

1103
01:21:05,598 --> 01:21:10,387
Robert, you are this far away
from being the man who won the war.

1104
01:21:10,589 --> 01:21:12,477
These are important people
in Chicago.

1105
01:21:12,669 --> 01:21:15,320
You can't ignore
what they have to say.

1106
01:21:15,485 --> 01:21:19,445
All they want is an opportunity
to talk about the demonstration.

1107
01:21:19,612 --> 01:21:23,027
- What's his name? Szilard.
- Szilard.

1108
01:21:23,196 --> 01:21:24,887
Sitting in the bathtub.

1109
01:21:25,052 --> 01:21:28,947
I should have drowned that
son of a bitch the first day I met him.

1110
01:21:30,171 --> 01:21:33,367
What's wrong with demonstrating?
What's wrong with not killing?

1111
01:21:33,531 --> 01:21:35,419
You vaporize some uninhabited atoll.

1112
01:21:35,579 --> 01:21:38,197
Set terms of surrender,
then send the Japanese home.

1113
01:21:38,619 --> 01:21:41,488
It's mush. It won't work.

1114
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:44,657
They are kamikazes, all of them.

1115
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:49,779
You had money in your background.
That explains it.

1116
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:51,954
- What does that mean?
- Your optimism.

1117
01:21:52,122 --> 01:21:56,115
Faith in human nature.
I never had any. Money, that is.

1118
01:21:56,281 --> 01:21:59,859
Never had a permanent house.
Made me a realist.

1119
01:22:02,777 --> 01:22:04,948
The idea should go to the president.

1120
01:22:06,648 --> 01:22:09,430
Where do you get these ideas?

1121
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:11,981
You know, those boys in security...

1122
01:22:12,184 --> 01:22:15,032
...got a right to ask where
these ideas are coming from.

1123
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:21,399
Demonstrations, stopping work,
sharing with other countries.

1124
01:22:21,975 --> 01:22:24,147
You're gonna have
a tough time proving

1125
01:22:24,312 --> 01:22:27,158
that those ideas
are coming out of Chicago.

1126
01:22:27,318 --> 01:22:29,707
- They are foreign, subversive.
- They're moral.

1127
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:32,114
- Moral?
- Moral.

1128
01:22:32,278 --> 01:22:34,733
Was Pearl Harbor moral?

1129
01:22:34,902 --> 01:22:36,844
Poland, Munich, moral?

1130
01:22:38,103 --> 01:22:41,451
Death March of Bataan,
was that moral?

1131
01:22:41,621 --> 01:22:42,832
Junk!

1132
01:22:43,829 --> 01:22:46,382
Demonstration junk.

1133
01:22:46,581 --> 01:22:49,680
I say you show the enemy
in the harshest terms

1134
01:22:49,845 --> 01:22:54,579
that you can muster, that you play
in the same league that they do.

1135
01:22:55,444 --> 01:23:00,201
At that meeting tomorrow there's
gonna be a vote on this demonstration.

1136
01:23:00,372 --> 01:23:03,470
There's gonna be a recommendation
going to the president.

1137
01:23:03,635 --> 01:23:05,097
Now, listen.

1138
01:23:05,811 --> 01:23:08,626
You can help yourself here.

1139
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:12,269
Steer it in the right direction.

1140
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:16,778
You're either for us or against us.
Ernest, how are you?

1141
01:23:16,978 --> 01:23:20,327
I'd like to introduce
Dr. Oppenheimer here.

1142
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:23,760
Well, rumor has it
that we might owe you

1143
01:23:23,923 --> 01:23:26,475
for shaking those yellow monkeys
out of the trees.

1144
01:23:26,641 --> 01:23:29,990
Save us a lot, not going to Japan.
My boys are gonna be grateful.

1145
01:23:30,161 --> 01:23:34,023
Yes, I'm pleased to shake
your hand. And thank you.

1146
01:23:34,193 --> 01:23:36,909
Doctor, I'd like to add my shake too.

1147
01:23:37,072 --> 01:23:39,112
Nice seeing you.

1148
01:23:42,736 --> 01:23:45,770
Did you hear what they said?

1149
01:23:45,936 --> 01:23:50,692
You keep this on the track,
and we are gonna owe you, soldier.

1150
01:24:32,845 --> 01:24:37,154
<i>''We are in a completely new situation
that cannot be resolved by war.</i>

1151
01:24:38,284 --> 01:24:41,098
<i>''A petition to the president
of the United States.</i>

1152
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,594
<i>''Discoveries of which the people
are not aware</i>

1153
01:24:43,756 --> 01:24:46,821
<i>''may affect the welfare
of this nation in the near future.''</i>

1154
01:24:47,275 --> 01:24:50,853
The Russians are our allies.
If we drop this without telling them,

1155
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:53,834
we could give them a paranoia
that will make us sick.

1156
01:24:53,995 --> 01:24:58,369
The Japanese are on their knees.
All this kamikaze stuff is a load of bull.

1157
01:24:58,569 --> 01:25:03,206
They're wet-pants scared of us just
like we're wet-pants scared of them.

1158
01:25:03,369 --> 01:25:06,631
This war seems to have forced
a lot of guys on both sides

1159
01:25:06,794 --> 01:25:09,281
to resign from the human race.

1160
01:25:09,449 --> 01:25:12,744
- I hope we're not about to do that.
- I agree.

1161
01:25:13,224 --> 01:25:17,981
Our blockade will finish Japan
by autumn, maybe even sooner.

1162
01:25:18,153 --> 01:25:21,600
This device is not an honorable way
to win a war.

1163
01:25:21,736 --> 01:25:23,972
And I was taught to fight with honor.

1164
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:26,143
If Custer...

1165
01:25:26,344 --> 01:25:28,646
...had used the machine-gun...

1166
01:25:28,808 --> 01:25:31,939
...his history would have been
written differently.

1167
01:25:33,638 --> 01:25:35,842
If you go ahead,

1168
01:25:36,006 --> 01:25:40,828
particularly, if you drop this thing
with no prior warning...

1169
01:25:40,999 --> 01:25:44,795
...l, for one, will have to
resign my commission.

1170
01:25:47,781 --> 01:25:50,498
Perhaps you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

1171
01:25:56,516 --> 01:26:02,659
Incidentally, what is the opinion of
the committee on a demonstration?

1172
01:26:05,445 --> 01:26:08,095
Well, if we should agree
to a demonstration

1173
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:10,169
with the attendant
Japanese observers

1174
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:13,820
and that demonstration failed,

1175
01:26:13,988 --> 01:26:17,534
not only would we be unable
to induce the Japanese to surrender,

1176
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,895
we would face a critical
shortage of material.

1177
01:26:23,491 --> 01:26:27,069
The dropping of the device
has always been implicit in this project.

1178
01:26:28,035 --> 01:26:32,060
So that is the advice I shall
pass on to the president.

1179
01:26:32,258 --> 01:26:34,527
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, that's right.

1180
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,479
Yes.

1181
01:27:16,222 --> 01:27:18,393
- Sam.
- Bob, welcome to Trinity.

1182
01:27:18,558 --> 01:27:20,314
- Here she is.
- Can I grab one?

1183
01:27:20,478 --> 01:27:22,420
- It's all right.
- Good trip?

1184
01:27:25,566 --> 01:27:27,802
- Are you the accountable officer?
- Yes.

1185
01:27:27,965 --> 01:27:29,874
- This will be for you.
- What's that?

1186
01:27:30,045 --> 01:27:32,827
It states that the University
of California hands over

1187
01:27:33,021 --> 01:27:36,282
a plutonium core of a nuclear device
to the United States Army.

1188
01:27:36,445 --> 01:27:40,700
Put more simply,
it's a bill for two billion dollars.

1189
01:27:42,908 --> 01:27:45,723
Now, let me show you
what else your money's bought.

1190
01:27:47,644 --> 01:27:49,651
The initiator.

1191
01:27:52,443 --> 01:27:54,745
And the other half.

1192
01:27:56,091 --> 01:27:59,768
Now, all we gotta do
is throw them together and...

1193
01:28:02,874 --> 01:28:05,743
Well, let's begin final assembly.

1194
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,569
OK, Mr. Merriman.

1195
01:28:24,249 --> 01:28:26,452
Well, you're quiet.

1196
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:32,117
It's coming close, what you're
working towards, isn't it?

1197
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,352
Yeah.

1198
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:38,000
I can feel it pressing down
on everybody.

1199
01:28:38,199 --> 01:28:40,916
There's something going on here.

1200
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:46,064
It's got everybody mesmerized,
doesn't it?

1201
01:28:46,231 --> 01:28:48,173
Yeah.

1202
01:28:48,343 --> 01:28:51,887
There's a regular run
on sleeping pills and aspirin.

1203
01:28:52,054 --> 01:28:55,469
And it's not just the work,
it's something else.

1204
01:28:58,678 --> 01:29:02,736
- Look, I know you can't talk about it.
- I can't.

1205
01:29:02,901 --> 01:29:05,901
Well, then talk to Dr. Oppenheimer.

1206
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:09,299
I mean, if anyone has,
he'll have thought it through, right?

1207
01:29:10,549 --> 01:29:12,141
OK.

1208
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:20,367
Touch me.

1209
01:29:35,794 --> 01:29:37,867
Naked.

1210
01:29:38,034 --> 01:29:40,456
Isn't that a beautiful word?

1211
01:29:43,218 --> 01:29:45,585
Tonight.

1212
01:29:45,779 --> 01:29:48,199
I want to make love.

1213
01:29:51,057 --> 01:29:53,294
And I want a future.

1214
01:29:53,458 --> 01:29:55,978
That's what I really want...

1215
01:29:56,145 --> 01:29:58,348
...for you and me.

1216
01:29:58,513 --> 01:30:00,749
So do I.

1217
01:30:03,088 --> 01:30:07,791
- Oh, for chrissake, George.
- This pitting, must be the mold.

1218
01:30:07,953 --> 01:30:10,407
I'm not an explosives expert,
but I've been called

1219
01:30:10,576 --> 01:30:12,648
to look at something
that's unacceptable.

1220
01:30:12,848 --> 01:30:14,157
We must use hand lathings.

1221
01:30:14,351 --> 01:30:16,588
You should have used hand
lathings before.

1222
01:30:16,752 --> 01:30:19,141
- Hand lathings, you know what it is?
- Yes.

1223
01:30:19,984 --> 01:30:23,944
- Michael, what are you doing here?
- Chicago, Leo Szilard.

1224
01:30:24,111 --> 01:30:26,664
I read it on the train.

1225
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:30,475
- Well, what do you think about it?
- It unnerved me.

1226
01:30:31,951 --> 01:30:34,284
Are we gonna discuss this ever?

1227
01:30:34,445 --> 01:30:36,518
Amongst ourselves?

1228
01:30:37,262 --> 01:30:41,157
- Are we going on?
- I don't see anyone stopping.

1229
01:30:41,325 --> 01:30:44,390
Now, look, we've been asked
to solve a technical problem,

1230
01:30:44,589 --> 01:30:48,004
to build this device.
We're not responsible for its use.

1231
01:30:48,205 --> 01:30:51,401
Oppie, it's for you.

1232
01:30:51,564 --> 01:30:54,434
Peter's got revised figures.

1233
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:04,585
Look, let me keep this paper.

1234
01:31:04,748 --> 01:31:08,544
We're expecting the initiator.
We need your lab results, all right?

1235
01:31:08,715 --> 01:31:10,308
All right?

1236
01:31:10,474 --> 01:31:12,329
All right.

1237
01:31:31,497 --> 01:31:33,187
Everybody ready?

1238
01:31:33,352 --> 01:31:35,108
- Meter's ready.
- Here we go.

1239
01:31:54,439 --> 01:31:56,413
Twenty-one.

1240
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,805
Twenty-nine.

1241
01:32:14,246 --> 01:32:16,351
Thirty-one.

1242
01:32:18,693 --> 01:32:20,416
Thirty-eight.

1243
01:32:21,509 --> 01:32:25,437
Got it? Forty.
Everybody back, right now.

1244
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:32,986
Behind the wall.

1245
01:32:44,163 --> 01:32:45,756
Turn it off!

1246
01:32:53,314 --> 01:32:55,169
Nobody move! Don't anybody move!

1247
01:32:58,946 --> 01:33:01,247
Damn it!

1248
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:03,383
Take off everything metal. Drop it.

1249
01:33:03,553 --> 01:33:06,455
Mark the positions
you're standing in and get out.

1250
01:33:10,049 --> 01:33:11,510
The incident never happened.

1251
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:14,549
If anyone should ask,
it did not happen.

1252
01:33:35,007 --> 01:33:37,276
Everybody should make it.

1253
01:33:39,102 --> 01:33:41,589
Except me.

1254
01:33:41,758 --> 01:33:43,646
I'm dead.

1255
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:07,224
Doctor! Doctor!
I've been looking all over for you.

1256
01:34:07,388 --> 01:34:09,843
We've got a problem.

1257
01:34:10,012 --> 01:34:11,223
- Bad allergy.
- When?

1258
01:34:11,388 --> 01:34:13,721
- An hour ago. They're bringing him in.
- Who?

1259
01:34:13,883 --> 01:34:15,093
Mr. Merriman.

1260
01:34:15,259 --> 01:34:16,885
- Michael?
- Yes, sir.

1261
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:18,938
Oh, shit.

1262
01:34:19,099 --> 01:34:21,204
Let's go.

1263
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:24,153
- Come on, let's go!
- Yes, sir.

1264
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:32,566
This one won't do.

1265
01:34:35,385 --> 01:34:38,963
- In here. This one's good.
- Take it easy. All right, all right.

1266
01:34:39,129 --> 01:34:42,424
- Michael, what's the matter?
- Nothing, everything's fine.

1267
01:34:43,193 --> 01:34:46,008
- Doctor, how much did he get?
- More than 1 ,000 rads.

1268
01:34:46,169 --> 01:34:47,892
- Goddamn it.
- What's happening?

1269
01:34:48,056 --> 01:34:51,471
Sweetheart, it's under control.
Everything's under control, OK?

1270
01:34:52,472 --> 01:34:55,155
- Steven, what's going on?
- You should not be here.

1271
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,109
Excuse me, there's no patient here.

1272
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:59,956
No one's to hear about this.
Not Oppenheimer. Nobody.

1273
01:35:00,151 --> 01:35:03,446
- OK?
- Goddamn it, what happened here?

1274
01:35:03,639 --> 01:35:05,778
I want this ward sealed off.
Come with me.

1275
01:35:05,943 --> 01:35:08,594
I want military doctors in here.

1276
01:35:18,134 --> 01:35:20,109
Get the hell out of here!

1277
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:25,964
It's the detonation circuits.

1278
01:35:28,085 --> 01:35:31,827
I don't know.
I would like another 24 hours.

1279
01:35:32,021 --> 01:35:34,867
I think so, but I can't be certain.

1280
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:40,243
I said one more day.
I need one more day.

1281
01:35:41,397 --> 01:35:45,902
No, no, Merriman brought me
a copy from Chicago.

1282
01:35:46,739 --> 01:35:48,649
Some of the physicists
have signed it.

1283
01:35:48,819 --> 01:35:52,562
Pinko fruitcakes. Get that thing
to work, I'm gonna drop it on Chicago.

1284
01:35:52,724 --> 01:35:55,145
I swear I will.

1285
01:35:55,315 --> 01:36:00,202
Yes, I hear you. You hear me?
Finish the damn thing. That's an order.

1286
01:36:01,938 --> 01:36:05,386
Well, I got other business.

1287
01:36:05,586 --> 01:36:08,041
But I got a plane. I'll be there.

1288
01:36:08,241 --> 01:36:10,729
Every time I turn around,
somebody gets to him.

1289
01:36:10,929 --> 01:36:13,777
Now they're talking about postponing.

1290
01:36:18,449 --> 01:36:22,092
- Cleared for Washington?
- Yes, sir. We are.

1291
01:36:26,321 --> 01:36:29,583
''Truman, Stimson arrive Potsdam
for conference with Stalin.

1292
01:36:29,745 --> 01:36:31,915
''Advise results of Trinity Test soonest.''

1293
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,535
Stalin's gonna eat Truman alive
at this meeting.

1294
01:36:34,704 --> 01:36:37,192
- Unless we...
- Yes, unless...

1295
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:40,806
...we give the president something
lethal to stick in his back pocket.

1296
01:36:41,008 --> 01:36:45,033
I'll tell you something
it won't be...postponement.

1297
01:36:51,502 --> 01:36:55,430
Oh, Lord...so close.

1298
01:36:58,221 --> 01:36:59,782
Sir.

1299
01:37:42,665 --> 01:37:46,440
Keep going down slow.

1300
01:37:49,706 --> 01:37:52,836
His heart looks larger. Could be
fluid in the pericardial sac.

1301
01:37:53,001 --> 01:37:54,626
- Radiation induced?
- Probably.

1302
01:37:54,792 --> 01:37:56,996
It's almost doubled in size overnight.

1303
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:59,549
If this continues, his heart will drown.

1304
01:37:59,721 --> 01:38:01,990
- Is he lucid?
- In and out.

1305
01:38:02,153 --> 01:38:05,698
There's tremendous brain swelling
from the radiation.

1306
01:38:05,863 --> 01:38:10,239
- What happens next?
- I don't know. I mean, I have no idea.

1307
01:38:10,407 --> 01:38:13,636
No human being's ever gotten
this dose of radiation before.

1308
01:38:13,832 --> 01:38:15,522
He's dying from the inside out.

1309
01:38:15,719 --> 01:38:20,061
Other problems. His gastrointestinal
tract has been destroyed by radiation.

1310
01:38:20,262 --> 01:38:22,434
Excuse me, doctors.

1311
01:38:27,846 --> 01:38:30,813
You've got to believe
we're doing everything we know how.

1312
01:38:30,982 --> 01:38:32,356
Absolutely everything.

1313
01:38:32,518 --> 01:38:36,031
It's not gonna do any good
to have you ripping yourself apart.

1314
01:38:36,198 --> 01:38:39,710
- You've gotta go home and sleep.
- Richard, I can't.

1315
01:39:36,384 --> 01:39:37,726
- Some orange.
- Sure is.

1316
01:39:37,888 --> 01:39:39,295
Hey, Oppie?

1317
01:39:52,671 --> 01:39:54,078
Look out!

1318
01:39:56,287 --> 01:39:57,880
Hornig?

1319
01:39:58,047 --> 01:40:00,217
- Hornig?
- It's all right.

1320
01:40:00,382 --> 01:40:02,237
The other safety's holding.

1321
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:07,708
Does anybody else need a martini?

1322
01:40:10,461 --> 01:40:13,079
- What's the word?
- Oppie, it doesn't look good.

1323
01:40:13,245 --> 01:40:18,002
We have a chance of thunderstorms
over the next five days. I'm sorry.

1324
01:40:19,517 --> 01:40:22,266
I'm not telling you
what this guy's got up there.

1325
01:40:41,787 --> 01:40:43,642
- Why wasn't I told?
- Too much panic.

1326
01:40:43,803 --> 01:40:45,711
- How is he?
- Difficult to tell.

1327
01:40:45,882 --> 01:40:48,249
- I'd like to see him.
- We're not permitting visits.

1328
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:50,931
But the men who were
with him have been spoken to.

1329
01:40:51,098 --> 01:40:53,270
Security. Delicate time.

1330
01:40:53,466 --> 01:40:56,466
He's a strong young man.
He'll pull through.

1331
01:40:57,657 --> 01:40:59,894
Schoenfield, how is he?

1332
01:41:00,057 --> 01:41:02,991
- Is he conscious?
- He's in and out.

1333
01:41:03,161 --> 01:41:05,463
He wants to know
if you read the petition.

1334
01:41:05,625 --> 01:41:09,486
- It means a lot to him.
- Yes, I have.

1335
01:41:09,656 --> 01:41:12,525
And then, that's it? That's all?

1336
01:41:12,696 --> 01:41:15,446
Yes, I have and then now
I wash my hands of it?

1337
01:41:15,609 --> 01:41:17,202
Now wait a minute, Oppenheimer.

1338
01:41:17,368 --> 01:41:20,215
I got a friend falling apart
who thinks you got the answers.

1339
01:41:20,375 --> 01:41:21,935
That's what you let him think.

1340
01:41:22,103 --> 01:41:26,097
Do you know what the Christ is going
on, or is the whole thing out of control?

1341
01:41:26,295 --> 01:41:28,597
If you're trying to make a point,
what is it?

1342
01:41:28,759 --> 01:41:31,627
I have spent the last
two years of my life

1343
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:36,140
putting up with all your security
and your secrecy and your control.

1344
01:41:36,310 --> 01:41:39,180
I don't think that bullshit
was to keep what was going on

1345
01:41:39,351 --> 01:41:42,001
from the Germans
or the Japanese or the Russians.

1346
01:41:42,166 --> 01:41:44,467
It's to keep it from
American Jacks and Jills

1347
01:41:44,629 --> 01:41:46,768
because they may not
like what's going on.

1348
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:49,716
American people don't
want to know what's going on.

1349
01:41:49,877 --> 01:41:52,179
They want to know
that their sons are alive.

1350
01:41:52,341 --> 01:41:55,057
I'm doing everything in my power
to see that they do.

1351
01:41:55,476 --> 01:41:57,996
Like Oak Ridge, where they're
injecting ill and old

1352
01:41:58,197 --> 01:42:00,433
people with huge doses of plutonium?

1353
01:42:00,596 --> 01:42:03,214
I don't know about Oak Ridge,
but if you want to ask

1354
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:06,227
what's happening, ask this:
Will it be big enough?

1355
01:42:06,739 --> 01:42:09,903
Big enough to scare all of us
and make us stop and think?

1356
01:42:10,068 --> 01:42:13,930
Big enough to stop all war forever?
You want to ask a question, ask that.

1357
01:42:14,099 --> 01:42:17,263
Look, I've seen Oak Ridge, all right?

1358
01:42:17,427 --> 01:42:20,328
That place wasn't built
to make one or two bombs.

1359
01:42:20,498 --> 01:42:23,727
It was built to make
thousands of them. Thousands.

1360
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:26,508
And soon everybody's
gonna have a bomb. They will.

1361
01:42:26,674 --> 01:42:30,285
What do they do with them?
Sit and wait till they go off, until ''boom''?

1362
01:42:30,482 --> 01:42:32,970
Then we got one world
full of Michael Merrimans

1363
01:42:33,169 --> 01:42:36,398
dying from the inside out.
Is that what you're looking for?

1364
01:42:36,561 --> 01:42:40,009
Because that's the future
you've made for us.

1365
01:42:40,785 --> 01:42:44,778
Hey, Oppenheimer! Oppenheimer,
you ought to stop playing God

1366
01:42:44,944 --> 01:42:49,221
because you are not good at it
and the position is taken.

1367
01:43:00,176 --> 01:43:04,266
His pressure's falling fast.
You've got to get that fluid out now.

1368
01:43:08,686 --> 01:43:10,541
Needle, Michael.

1369
01:43:11,470 --> 01:43:14,252
OK, you're in. Start to pull it back.

1370
01:43:14,414 --> 01:43:16,301
Hang in, Michael.

1371
01:43:18,318 --> 01:43:20,140
Hang in, pal.

1372
01:43:21,358 --> 01:43:23,497
Come on, doc.

1373
01:43:24,942 --> 01:43:28,236
Pressure's starting to rise.
It's coming up slowly.

1374
01:43:47,372 --> 01:43:51,233
- Robert, you have to get some sleep.
- God.

1375
01:43:51,403 --> 01:43:53,890
I'm in a dark place.

1376
01:43:55,018 --> 01:43:57,768
We've all cooked this stew.

1377
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:04,575
The Germans and the Japanese
and the Americans and the Brits.

1378
01:44:05,385 --> 01:44:08,866
It's an ugliness that goes back.
It goes way back.

1379
01:44:09,609 --> 01:44:12,456
I'm not a scientist anymore.

1380
01:44:13,352 --> 01:44:17,247
I'm a goddamn functionary.

1381
01:44:18,441 --> 01:44:21,223
I've got to stay in control.

1382
01:44:21,384 --> 01:44:24,166
I've got to control who gets this thing.

1383
01:44:25,031 --> 01:44:29,025
Power and control,
it's all I ever hear about anymore.

1384
01:44:30,023 --> 01:44:32,478
Doesn't life matter to you?

1385
01:44:32,584 --> 01:44:34,973
What about love and understanding?

1386
01:44:35,175 --> 01:44:38,523
I thought that's what science
was all about.

1387
01:44:38,726 --> 01:44:41,574
I just wanted us to work.

1388
01:44:41,767 --> 01:44:46,501
Does everything have to be
sacrificed to this...thing?

1389
01:44:48,582 --> 01:44:51,003
I put up with...

1390
01:44:54,214 --> 01:44:56,516
...Jean,

1391
01:44:56,678 --> 01:44:59,743
because I thought you needed her.

1392
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:04,067
And I thought you'd give
her up because of me.

1393
01:45:05,733 --> 01:45:08,450
But she didn't count.

1394
01:45:08,645 --> 01:45:15,202
I don't count. Nothing counts for you
anymore except this damn bomb.

1395
01:45:15,843 --> 01:45:18,210
That's what it is.

1396
01:45:18,371 --> 01:45:21,535
But it's not your only creation.

1397
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:24,220
There are the children.

1398
01:45:25,602 --> 01:45:30,272
And you need my love and support.
I know.

1399
01:45:31,139 --> 01:45:33,146
I don't...

1400
01:45:33,315 --> 01:45:36,161
I don't know where it is.

1401
01:45:36,450 --> 01:45:38,654
Why me?

1402
01:45:40,961 --> 01:45:43,350
Why did he pick me?

1403
01:46:05,504 --> 01:46:07,446
- Panton!
- Sir?

1404
01:46:07,616 --> 01:46:11,161
Security's a mess. Nobody at
the checkpoint. Nobody up here.

1405
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:14,043
- What do you think this is, a beach?
- No, sir.

1406
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:17,054
We've got to call a halt.
The weather is unpredictable.

1407
01:46:17,215 --> 01:46:19,604
We are not calling a halt
on account of weather.

1408
01:46:19,806 --> 01:46:23,351
With the wind we could send
radioactive junk all the way to Amarillo.

1409
01:46:23,518 --> 01:46:27,130
<i>You The New York Times reporter?
I want three reports.</i>

1410
01:46:27,294 --> 01:46:30,425
One if we succeed, one if we fail
and one if we disintegrate.

1411
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:34,233
With the wind blowing this direction,
Amarillo could get a fallout.

1412
01:46:34,397 --> 01:46:36,786
- Fermi's right.
- No, I'm saying no.

1413
01:46:36,957 --> 01:46:40,121
The decision is mine!

1414
01:46:40,285 --> 01:46:42,194
- Do you understand?
- We can't do it.

1415
01:46:42,365 --> 01:46:45,528
We go ahead with this. Sergeant,
do something about that dog.

1416
01:46:45,724 --> 01:46:48,211
You sound like you're planning
a railway schedule.

1417
01:46:48,412 --> 01:46:51,892
No, you are trying to uninvent this.

1418
01:46:52,188 --> 01:46:53,563
I can do it without you.

1419
01:46:53,724 --> 01:46:59,124
Well, if you do and I've said no
and something goes wrong...

1420
01:47:00,763 --> 01:47:02,389
Get in the car.

1421
01:47:02,555 --> 01:47:04,791
Hurry up.
What are you waiting on?

1422
01:47:29,177 --> 01:47:32,950
Sir, it looks like it's clearing up.

1423
01:47:52,535 --> 01:47:56,757
You know, you build to a moment,

1424
01:47:56,918 --> 01:48:00,431
and then you grab it,
or it will go right by you.

1425
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:05,170
You always thought that
I would do this, didn't you?

1426
01:48:05,333 --> 01:48:07,821
Can you buck your own nature?

1427
01:48:10,133 --> 01:48:12,522
What will it be like?

1428
01:48:14,709 --> 01:48:17,075
Unimaginable.

1429
01:48:19,381 --> 01:48:21,584
It's your baby.

1430
01:48:31,731 --> 01:48:33,902
Do it.

1431
01:48:35,635 --> 01:48:37,196
Hallelujah.

1432
01:48:37,555 --> 01:48:40,205
He said it's a go.

1433
01:48:40,370 --> 01:48:42,280
Let's go.

1434
01:48:42,706 --> 01:48:46,121
Start the countdown.
Come on. It's a go.

1435
01:48:46,290 --> 01:48:49,639
- Let's go! Move it out!
- Wilson, wake up!

1436
01:48:49,810 --> 01:48:53,704
- Wake up the dragon.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1437
01:49:08,752 --> 01:49:10,410
Power on.

1438
01:49:10,865 --> 01:49:14,028
- Power on.
- Synchronization relays one open.

1439
01:49:14,415 --> 01:49:16,204
Synchronization relay one open.

1440
01:49:16,368 --> 01:49:21,638
- Synchronization relays two open.
- Synchronization relays two open.

1441
01:49:37,613 --> 01:49:40,068
I love you, Michael.

1442
01:49:46,894 --> 01:49:48,965
Easy.

1443
01:49:50,477 --> 01:49:52,713
Breathe easy.

1444
01:50:08,972 --> 01:50:11,208
Easy.

1445
01:50:12,170 --> 01:50:14,559
Easy, come back to the ice.

1446
01:50:17,291 --> 01:50:20,225
It's OK, here's the ice.

1447
01:50:26,186 --> 01:50:29,382
Kathleen, what are you doing in here?

1448
01:50:29,578 --> 01:50:32,131
Kathleen? God!

1449
01:50:32,329 --> 01:50:34,663
Come on, come on, sweetheart.

1450
01:50:36,137 --> 01:50:39,879
- You simply can't be here, sweetheart.
- I had to be with him.

1451
01:50:40,041 --> 01:50:44,231
I wanted to tell him I love him,
because he's going to die.

1452
01:50:49,768 --> 01:50:51,361
Detonation relays four open.

1453
01:50:54,728 --> 01:50:57,411
Well, it's armed.

1454
01:50:57,575 --> 01:51:01,219
- Now it's up to the bunker.
- Let's get down from here.

1455
01:51:08,263 --> 01:51:15,070
Well, I've always believed
that the Lord was on our side.

1456
01:51:15,238 --> 01:51:17,823
And I think now we're gonna prove it.

1457
01:51:56,289 --> 01:52:00,152
- Must be from the military base.
- Enrico, what do you bet on the yield?

1458
01:52:00,322 --> 01:52:02,591
I bet we set fire to the atmosphere.

1459
01:52:02,753 --> 01:52:05,022
If we're lucky,
we only wipe out New Mexico.

1460
01:52:05,218 --> 01:52:10,432
If we can ignite the air,
we finish off the planet. Any takers?

1461
01:52:10,817 --> 01:52:13,664
I kind of hope the damn thing
doesn't go off.

1462
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,539
What the hell is that?

1463
01:52:16,993 --> 01:52:19,840
<i>It's The Nutcracker Suite.</i>

1464
01:52:20,672 --> 01:52:22,461
I can't get rid of it.

1465
01:52:23,104 --> 01:52:25,406
- Go to six-five.
- Six-five.

1466
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:28,855
- OK, try seven.
- Seven.

1467
01:52:29,472 --> 01:52:31,446
Charging the device.

1468
01:52:39,967 --> 01:52:42,235
Robert, over here.

1469
01:52:47,838 --> 01:52:50,358
The device is fully charged.

1470
01:52:50,845 --> 01:52:54,619
It is now zero minus 60 seconds.
Fifty-nine, 58,

1473
01:52:58,621 --> 01:53:04,731
- 53, 52, 51 , 50, 49...
- Where is that music coming from?

1474
01:53:04,892 --> 01:53:07,674
It's a ground channel.
I can't get rid of it.

1475
01:53:07,868 --> 01:53:12,658
44, 43, 42, 41 , 40...

1476
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:15,064
Goddamn music.

1477
01:53:15,228 --> 01:53:22,680
37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31 , 30,

four, three, two, one, zero.

1485
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:21,802
<i>Kathleen, my love.
You asked me a question once.</i>

1486
01:56:21,964 --> 01:56:24,811
<i>Was it instinct to save a life
or to take it?</i>

1487
01:56:24,971 --> 01:56:26,859
<i>Well, I don't know, my darling.</i>

1488
01:56:27,083 --> 01:56:30,978
<i>All I do know is that
if we are free to choose,</i>

1489
01:56:31,147 --> 01:56:33,929
<i>I hope to God
we choose life over death.</i>

1490
01:56:34,635 --> 01:56:38,279
<i>Not because I believe the implacable
universe cares a damn,</i>

1491
01:56:38,602 --> 01:56:41,537
<i>but because as I look at you,
my darling,</i>

1492
01:56:41,706 --> 01:56:43,845
<i>I realize how glorious,</i>

<i>how magical life can be.</i>
