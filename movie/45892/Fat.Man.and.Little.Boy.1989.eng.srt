1
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,461
At ease.

2
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:39,863
Move it, move it, move it!

3
00:01:45,088 --> 00:01:47,476
One, two, three.

4
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:52,022
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

5
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,493
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny! Hoorah!</i>

6
00:01:57,663 --> 00:02:00,793
Boy, those Japs better watch out
for you, sir. Good luck.

7
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,260
The Corps of Engineers
is gonna miss you, sir.

8
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:06,008
- Thank you, gentlemen. Bronson.
- Sir.

9
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,334
I built this place,
so I'll be glad to eat it.

10
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:14,557
Well done, sir.

11
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:17,177
You're a lucky man.
Give those Japs hell.

12
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,163
Thank you, Thomas.

13
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,561
Indeed, I will.

14
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:27,319
Sir!

15
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:30,355
I'm losing my chance
to get out from behind a desk

16
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,321
- and lead men in combat!
- Colonel Groves, forget it. This has...

17
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:36,762
Even Bronson
wants to head for the front.

18
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:39,258
Forget about the front.
You're an engineer.

19
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,103
You're gonna fight your war here.

20
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:46,806
Is this what you're assigning me to,
this boondoggle? Dead end?

21
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:50,582
This dead end, Groves, has the
personal backing of the president.

22
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:53,561
This is not what I was promised,
not what I expected.

23
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:57,106
Then bone up on it.
Head to Chicago, talk to the scientist.

24
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:59,249
If it looks possible, run with it.

25
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:03,512
Take whoever you want. Have
whatever you need. Just make it work.

26
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:06,576
Who knows, you might just win
this war on your own.

27
00:03:06,747 --> 00:03:09,267
Pick up a star on the way.

28
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:44,246
<i>...fighting for, and they are reported
to be giving the Germans hell.</i>

29
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:48,369
<i>Though these losses represent the
most serious setbacks for the Allies</i>

30
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,457
<i>in this war
against the Nazi enemy.</i>

31
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,608
<i>Bad news, too,
from the war in the Pacific.</i>

32
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:58,605
<i>We have just had confirmation of
the sinking of three US cruisers.</i>

33
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:01,493
<i>Names are being withheld.
The casualties are high.</i>

34
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,085
Come in!

35
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:07,477
<i>Reports of an early-morning raid
by Japanese dive-bombers...</i>

36
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,087
In here.
In here!

37
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:13,972
- Szard?
- Szilard.

38
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:17,747
General Groves, I was expecting you.
Come in! Come in!

39
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:31,217
Forgive me.
Sometimes I get stuck in here.

40
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:33,324
Metaphorically.

41
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:35,250
I've read this.

42
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:38,545
- Is it possible?
- You couldn't put a little more hot in,

43
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:40,302
could you?

44
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:53,166
And I'm not very good at fairy tales,
so just give me the happy ending.

45
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:59,121
What I wrote is possible,
probably inevitable.

46
00:05:00,564 --> 00:05:04,209
Separate uranium 235,
then arrange for two portions

47
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:08,681
of the element to be brought together
suddenly, so that the resulting mass,

48
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:10,860
no bigger than this, general,

49
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:14,639
undergoes a spontaneous
self-generating reaction.

50
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:19,310
And if this was the epicenter
of that explosion...

51
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:24,881
...all of Chicago you could see
from here would disintegrate.

52
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,282
Hallelujah.

53
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:32,176
At the moment, all we have
are theories, concepts, inspirations,

54
00:05:32,338 --> 00:05:35,633
- inconclusive results...
- Now, if we can make this device,

55
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,802
- so can the Krauts.
- Yes.

56
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,271
Germany has the scientific capability.

57
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:43,915
And, general,
we need leadership here.

58
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:45,543
- I can help!
- Thank you.

59
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:47,536
You need an ally, general!

60
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:57,358
- So tell us about this general.
- Why?

61
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,070
Because it's so mysterious.

62
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:02,541
''Meet me in the middle
of God-knows-where.

63
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:07,942
''Be there no earlier than 4:20,
no later than 4:29.''

64
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:10,021
Well, word has it

65
00:06:10,193 --> 00:06:12,016
he's a provincial windbag

66
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:15,590
who's spent most of his life
digging holes in Latin America.

67
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:18,475
- Graves for the natives, no doubt.
- Oh, Frank.

68
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,357
Seriously, Kitty, after all,
Robert's a scientist.

69
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,519
If the Army wants him,
they'll want all of him.

70
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:27,338
All of him?
Why not take all of him?

71
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:30,382
Look, I have to at least hear
what he has to offer.

72
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:33,391
- Robert, must we go so fast?
- Yes!

73
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:37,324
- It's crazy.
- Yes! Yes!

74
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:47,211
This way, Dr. Oppenheimer.

75
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:11,715
Doctor!

76
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:13,478
Up here!

77
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:18,116
Groves, Leslie. Friends call me Dick.
Sit down.

78
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:21,986
Ingenuity.

79
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:26,215
I love it.
Created out of nothing but up here.

80
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:27,973
Clear!

81
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,782
The old man likes his privacy,
doesn't he?

82
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:57,160
Guess what.

83
00:07:57,322 --> 00:08:02,023
- The egghead wants a carrot juice.
- Get him what he wants, Bronson!

84
00:08:02,217 --> 00:08:03,396
Get used to it.

85
00:08:03,593 --> 00:08:06,562
What an eight ball this guy is.

86
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:10,568
Seems this Oppenheimer's
a hot number.

87
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,894
Says here, he's got more damn brains
than are decent.

88
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:18,149
He knows it too. Temperamental. He
ain't gonna be an easy horse to corral.

89
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:21,379
Oh, I think the general
knows what he's doing.

90
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,524
Oppenheimer ain't one of us.

91
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:26,656
The general picks that guy,
he'll be making a mistake.

92
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,790
It needs to get pulled together.

93
00:08:37,031 --> 00:08:40,960
So I think you're the man for the job.

94
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,593
And I got a weakness for good men.

95
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,286
The Krauts are working on this,
full bore.

96
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:55,651
If they get it before we do,
I don't have to spell it out.

97
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:57,758
Where would you start?

98
00:08:58,087 --> 00:08:59,549
Focus.

99
00:08:59,975 --> 00:09:03,235
You have great minds,
but all dancing to a different tune.

100
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:07,359
You bring them together in one place,
isolate them, no distractions.

101
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,013
You create an atmosphere
of creative stress.

102
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:13,150
Everyone competing
to solve one problem.

103
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,074
And you have one ringmaster.

104
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,162
Right now, it's all over the place.
You centralize everything.

105
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,180
There is a hitch.

106
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,660
There are people out there
don't like the color of your politics.

107
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,967
My politics...

108
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:29,955
...are an open book.

109
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:33,818
Well, I hope so.

110
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:37,731
You could win a war
and the Nobel Prize, God willing.

111
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:41,057
Sir, Major de Silva
wanted me to remind you

112
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:43,618
you've got a train to catch
at 1800 hours.

113
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,755
No rest for the wicked.

114
00:09:48,132 --> 00:09:49,955
Oh, doctor.

115
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:56,129
If you take this on,
I say this in all humility, intellect...

116
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:58,754
...don't outrank that.

117
00:10:02,307 --> 00:10:04,795
This general is a meatball,
a cipher.

118
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:07,930
He'd be eating out of the palm
of my hand in a week.

119
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:10,008
So will you accept?

120
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,634
There are questions.
There are a kaleidoscope of questions.

121
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:20,028
I see.

122
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:24,347
Well, I'm a star
at breakfast small talk.

123
00:10:24,514 --> 00:10:28,605
You'll have to save some for evenings if
you're gonna be wife of the big cheese.

124
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:31,256
Would this mean moving?

125
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:34,714
Oh, you have to say yes.

126
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:37,271
You're too brilliant for Berkeley.

127
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:44,032
<i>Michelangelo's The Creation
of Adam. Origin and destiny.</i>

128
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,224
Origins and destiny.

129
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:51,646
The struggle to unearth the one
and to discover the other.

130
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:53,565
That is science!

131
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:56,892
And as I leave here
to unravel my own small destiny,

132
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:00,318
I congratulate each of you
on being the best of the best.

133
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:02,302
I have faith in you all.

134
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:06,741
God keep you, and may your lives
be rich and sweet.

135
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:08,885
- Thank you.
- We'll miss you, Oppie!

136
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:10,811
We'll miss you, Oppie!

137
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,863
Good luck, Oppie!

138
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,981
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!

139
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:41,209
Let's move that thing out back.

140
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:49,660
Sir!

141
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,923
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Give me the good news, Jack.

142
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:27,318
We've got utilities on
throughout camp.

143
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:31,280
We've got the sewage problem taken
care of. We have water throughout.

144
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,320
- Got the two science buildings...
- Not good enough.

145
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,661
We gotta be
a couple of weeks behind.

146
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:39,478
You know, I got a bunch
of scientists up there.

147
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:42,260
They're just wandering,
bumping into each other.

148
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:45,874
Get some bodies in here. In a week,
I wanna be two weeks ahead.

149
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:48,246
I don't think we have
accommodations, sir.

150
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,319
Why would they want
accommodations?

151
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,766
You think they'll sleep?

152
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:56,527
All right, get some tents,
but put it on your EOR.

153
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:59,831
Didn't I ask for dogs
around that perimeter fence?

154
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:01,619
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see any.

155
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:03,475
They're coming, general.

156
00:13:09,977 --> 00:13:11,503
So...

157
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:16,561
...whatever goes on around here
is privileged information.

158
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:22,805
No exceptions. No wives, no barbers.
No exceptions!

159
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,367
What you see,

160
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:30,413
what you hear, what you read,
what you dream about,

161
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:32,503
whatever...

162
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:37,229
...gives you heartburn or feeds your
ulcers, whatever gives you the sweats,

163
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:40,050
keeps you up at night, whatever,

164
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:41,939
all of that...

165
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:46,412
...belongs to the United States Army.

166
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:51,403
Or to me, if that makes you feel
more comfortable.

167
00:13:52,183 --> 00:13:55,696
Now, you gotta come down
out of the clouds, gentlemen,

168
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:59,953
and get into the business
of winning a war.

169
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:04,395
I'm gonna say it once.
I'm only gonna say it once.

170
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:07,915
Those of you who know, know.
Those of you who don't, don't.

171
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:12,842
You are not here to be comfortable.

172
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,116
All right?

173
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:20,206
You are here

174
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:23,917
to go beyond the theoretical,

175
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:26,832
the speculative, the fanciful.

176
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:33,138
You are here to harness
your God-given talents,

177
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,504
your minds, your energy,

178
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:39,945
in the practical pursuit of one thing:

179
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:42,379
A military weapon.

180
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,271
Nuclear one.

181
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:46,602
An atomic bomb.

182
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:51,343
Keep the muttering
to just a minimum, gentlemen.

183
00:14:51,731 --> 00:14:55,080
Why bother with a bomb?
Why not just drop that man on Berlin?

184
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:58,316
- When you talk about it...
- It will have the same effect.

185
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:03,403
...it will be referred to as ''the gadget''
or ''the device''.

186
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,260
Is that clear?

187
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:10,342
There is one word
that I don't wanna hear.

188
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:12,911
And that's the word ''impossible''.

189
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:16,682
- You're two days late.
- I went to 109 East Palace Street

190
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,428
to report to Mrs. McKibben,
but there was nobody there.

191
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:25,776
So I hopped a construction bus, and it
damn near drove me back to Chicago.

192
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:30,955
I've been sitting on trains, buses,

193
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:35,308
railway stations for 60 hours.

194
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:40,621
I asked about this place in Santa Fe,
and they said it didn't exist.

195
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:42,410
It doesn't.

196
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:50,757
So where does a fellow
get some chow around here, huh?

197
00:15:50,928 --> 00:15:54,343
- We already ate.
- Oh, great.

198
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:57,773
Oh, if you wanna take a shower,
I'd take one now.

199
00:15:57,936 --> 00:16:00,783
They turn off the water at 2:00.

200
00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:10,149
Keep those two men back there.
We still gotta run the power through.

201
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,681
Yeah, you two men there!

202
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:18,315
Higher! A little more.

203
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:21,229
All right, that'll do it.

204
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:24,934
Open this door, now!

205
00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:28,172
Sorry. I couldn't get in.

206
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:31,628
Give it a month, you'll do that
because you can't get out.

207
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,000
- You Merriman?
- Yeah.

208
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:36,426
Richard Schoenfield.
I'm the doctor around here.

209
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:40,516
You're just what I'm looking for
in a roommate, a little brute strength.

210
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:43,819
Holy shit!

211
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,243
- What in God's name is this?
- It looks like a fridge.

212
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:49,159
Oh, yeah, it does.

213
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:51,047
It looks stuck.

214
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:54,628
I guess you arrived just in time then.
Thank God you're here.

215
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,771
Which end would you like?

216
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,813
Are you ready?

217
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:07,619
- You want me to get it myself?
- Lift.

218
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:23,109
Oppie's boys.
No problem left unsolved.

219
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:29,351
Gentlemen, this project
has been separated into three areas.

220
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:31,783
The physics.
How much material do we need?

221
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:34,630
Should it be plutonium
or uranium 235?

222
00:17:34,795 --> 00:17:38,055
Second, manufacture of material,
but that's out of our hands.

223
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:41,097
That's Oak Ridge, Tennessee
and Hanford. And third,

224
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,559
our responsibility,
and this is a cinch...

225
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:45,314
Yeah, sure.

226
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,605
...build the device, test it,
and just hope that we can control it.

227
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,907
Gentlemen, we are here...

228
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:57,570
...at the beginning.
Our objective is here.

229
00:17:57,736 --> 00:18:00,190
We have a deadline of 19 months.

230
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:05,348
19 months?
It seems such a short time.

231
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:08,612
19 months coincides
with our anticipated delivery date

232
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:11,940
from Oak Ridge. Gentlemen,
we have 19 months, that's it...

233
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:14,656
...to box, wrap
and deliver this package.

234
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,667
Are there any dissenters?

235
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:21,117
No?

236
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:23,106
Good.

237
00:18:23,495 --> 00:18:27,205
<i>Nineteen months
and starting from scratch, Jesus.</i>

238
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:31,775
<i>Still, Oppie's got the best theoreticians
and engineers in the world.</i>

239
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:36,382
<i>Some of these guys are legends and
so young. The place is a hothouse.</i>

240
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,940
<i>Doc, he seems like
he's gonna be a good man.</i>

241
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,300
<i>Reckons we'll be working with funny
stuff. He's gonna be looking out for us.</i>

242
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:47,039
<i>He's got a whole wing of the hospital
that looks like Noah's Ark.</i>

243
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:51,257
<i>I think of Jimmy fighting in the
Philippines, and I can't complain.</i>

244
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:54,757
<i>I love you, but I gotta go.
General wants a progress report.</i>

245
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:57,373
<i>When Groves wants something,
he wants it now.</i>

246
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,102
Again.

247
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:03,423
We build a cannon, and at the end

248
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:06,622
weld a stopper
made from a subcritical mass.

249
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:10,716
We fabricate a shell
made from another subcritical mass

250
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,794
and fire it down the barrel.

251
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:17,410
- How much of both materials?
- Projecting 30 pounds.

252
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:19,513
30 pounds is as far away
as the moon.

253
00:19:19,716 --> 00:19:22,716
<i>We're trying to tap the energy
that fuels the universe.</i>

254
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:25,918
<i>It's petrifying. All we've got
so far are problems,</i>

255
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:29,346
<i>and that doesn't include the ones
we haven't thought about.</i>

256
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:32,158
Shake down the bad news.
I'm getting used to it.

257
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:35,225
At the moment, there are
two problems. Pre-detonation.

258
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:37,816
The gadget disintegrates
before it explodes.

259
00:19:37,987 --> 00:19:40,256
Second, it's the weight problem.

260
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:42,972
For the slug to travel at the velocity
we need,

261
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:45,473
the gun barrel
would be so heavy, so thick,

262
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:49,115
I don't think we'd get the gadget
off the ground with a crane.

263
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:52,575
If they're talking about a slug
with a seven-inch diameter,

264
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:56,480
then you'd have to have a barrel
thickness of at least four inches.

265
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,636
I hope you guys find the music.

266
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,256
The way things are,
we can't even hum the tune.

267
00:20:07,425 --> 00:20:09,052
Free discussion.
Two groups...

268
00:20:09,217 --> 00:20:11,485
- I'm not comfortable with...
- Excuse me.

269
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:15,446
Seth, Deke, the gun barrel.
Robert, Michael, pre-detonation.

270
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:22,592
Damn it! Just, damn it!
Maybe it's the altitude.

271
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:25,183
But we're still just chalk
on a blackboard.

272
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:27,165
We're dead in the water.

273
00:20:27,455 --> 00:20:30,717
Maybe we cast a lighter
gun barrel, find a new alloy.

274
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:32,504
The force would be too great.

275
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:36,828
We gotta smack these atoms together
to trigger a chain reaction.

276
00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:41,017
We gotta concentrate the energy
and crush the mass.

277
00:20:41,182 --> 00:20:43,071
All right, let's rethink this.

278
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:46,842
We have a gun barrel that's so heavy
we can't lift it with a plane.

279
00:20:47,006 --> 00:20:49,942
To get the explosive power we need,
it's gotta be heavy.

280
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:52,189
Michael, come here!

281
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:55,416
When I squeeze this...

282
00:20:56,511 --> 00:20:58,333
- ...what do I get?
- Juice.

283
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,291
No. I squeeze it, I get compression.

284
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:05,179
We get a hollow sphere
of plutonium,

285
00:21:05,342 --> 00:21:08,539
and we compress it
with an explosion that goes in.

286
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:10,906
- An implosion.
- Chain reaction.

287
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,793
Boom!

288
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:16,534
- But, Seth, explosives go out.
- I know.

289
00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:19,514
But we make one that goes in.

290
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:23,254
Jesus.

291
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:25,144
- Michael.
- Let's get the boys.

292
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:27,315
We'll meet down here in the canteen.

293
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:31,989
It's brilliant. The device is gonna be so
light that we don't need a gun barrel!

294
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,541
Got a match, soldier?

295
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,147
Sir, it's Michael and Seth!

296
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:52,122
I'm sorry to bother you.

297
00:21:52,284 --> 00:21:55,098
But Seth had an idea.
He was thinking of an orange.

298
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:58,455
Yes, I was thinking of jumping
up and down on an orange.

299
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:00,474
- Crushing an orange.
- Crushing!

300
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:03,635
Crushing...the core.

301
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:06,486
Oh, God.
This could be very sweet.

302
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,099
- Where are the others?
- Canteen, they wanna kick it around.

303
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:13,332
- Perhaps it can wait till later?
- No, you go ahead.

304
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,216
- I'd have lost you anyway.
- Thank you.

305
00:22:22,746 --> 00:22:24,917
Goddamn it.

306
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,732
Doctor!

307
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:48,239
- Come on!
- Double up, over here!

308
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:52,085
I'm sorry. We were looking for testing
sites and the bus got stuck.

309
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:56,143
You had a meeting last night.
You discussed the work in public.

310
00:22:56,313 --> 00:22:58,320
We were discussing
Neddermeyer's...

311
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,268
- In public!
- A table in the back of the canteen.

312
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,009
- We were having a free discussion.
- Let's just talk about that.

313
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,403
I don't want free discussion.
I want compartmentalization.

314
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:12,244
I don't want theoreticians
knowing what engineers know.

315
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:15,723
- Listen to me...
- It is a security problem!

316
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,375
These kids are used to pinning
their best ideas on a board.

317
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:23,089
Ideas are community property.
It's a matter of principle.

318
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:26,708
You force my hand and there
won't be any free discussion

319
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,132
because there won't be anybody left
to have it!

320
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:34,316
If you'd been there you'd understand.
Neddermeyer's idea was brilliant.

321
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:36,242
An explosion that goes inwards,

322
00:23:36,406 --> 00:23:39,918
producing uniform compression
in a core and it'd be lightweight.

323
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,768
No gun barrel,
no velocity and weight problem.

324
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:45,454
And all of that
out of free discussion.

325
00:23:45,622 --> 00:23:48,076
You've got to give us room
to breathe.

326
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:52,462
- Bronson?
- Sir?

327
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:55,083
Just don't give it to the waitresses.

328
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,706
<i>Oppie's quite a match
for the general.</i>

329
00:24:05,907 --> 00:24:10,251
<i>I'm worried it's not in Groves' nature
to rest until he gets the upper hand.</i>

330
00:24:10,452 --> 00:24:12,491
<i>We're terrified the Germans
are ahead.</i>

331
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,370
<i>Working with restrictions
and regulations is setting us on edge.</i>

332
00:24:16,532 --> 00:24:19,827
This is typical.
We are people, not numbers!

333
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:22,158
It's not part of the agreement,
general.

334
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:25,388
I apologize for complaints,
but barbed wire,

335
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:27,245
dogs, guards!

336
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:29,517
- Security badges!
- Secrets!

337
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:32,617
I hoped to leave these things in Italy
with Mussolini!

338
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:35,503
Openness is a principle
matter for scientists!

339
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:39,627
And there are many other things.
I resent my letters are being censored.

340
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:43,568
The FBI talking to me, that's one
thing. But my wife, my family,

341
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:46,600
that's a little much.
Don't you think?

342
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:49,870
We cannot continue work
under these conditions!

343
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:52,368
- Doctor.
- And what about...?

344
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:07,212
Well, that is some monkey house
in there.

345
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,808
A mess.
What are you gonna do about it?

346
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:11,975
I warned you about this.

347
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,256
Look, you give me responsibility
for security inside the lab.

348
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,837
We go where we like, as we like,
when we like.

349
00:25:21,007 --> 00:25:23,398
Outside the lab, that's yours.

350
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,414
I will sell them on that.

351
00:25:27,983 --> 00:25:33,678
I don't like it.
But I will live with it, for now.

352
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:42,853
<i>The 8th Air Force today</i>

353
00:25:43,054 --> 00:25:47,276
<i>carried out its heaviest bombing
of the war against Germany.</i>

354
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:50,755
Michael! Michael. What do you say?
Good to see you.

355
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:53,675
- How are you?
- I brought Kathleen with me.

356
00:25:53,837 --> 00:25:57,766
I was afraid this party would be
a little short on the beauty side,

357
00:25:57,934 --> 00:26:02,340
so I took the appropriate precautions,
if you know what I'm saying.

358
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,636
- I mean, she is my favorite nurse.
- You two gonna get together?

359
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:12,451
No. No, we're not.
Actually, I'm gonna get a drink.

360
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:17,705
That's what I'm gonna get. A good
stiff drink, that's all I'm gonna get.

361
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:23,047
- Two bucks...
- It's a short bet.

362
00:26:25,357 --> 00:26:27,014
- Like I said...
- This is stuck.

363
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,246
...it can be pretty lonely here.

364
00:26:30,444 --> 00:26:32,200
There's a war on.

365
00:26:32,365 --> 00:26:35,267
Not everybody can go to Acapulco.

366
00:26:41,964 --> 00:26:44,812
- Oh, my.
- Are you OK?

367
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:50,408
Good.
Thank you.

368
00:26:50,571 --> 00:26:53,385
Look, they're perfect.

369
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:56,743
Another minute,
they would have been overdone.

370
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,461
Well, I'll put this in the sink.

371
00:26:59,626 --> 00:27:02,561
- Would you like some orange juice?
- Yes, kindly.

372
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,683
- I am sorry.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

373
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:11,784
- This will be taken care of.
- It's OK.

374
00:27:13,386 --> 00:27:17,761
Anyway, I'm sure
we're going to be allies, general.

375
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:20,648
We're both trying to seduce
the same man.

376
00:27:26,536 --> 00:27:28,871
So is there a Mrs. Groves?

377
00:27:29,832 --> 00:27:32,833
Yes, there is.

378
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:37,087
And she has the courage
to stay in the background.

379
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:41,277
Some men are on the planet
for a purpose, Mrs. Oppenheimer.

380
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:46,401
A good wife recognizes that
and is happy to smooth the way.

381
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,217
Read my theory
on degenerate matter, did you?

382
00:27:53,383 --> 00:27:56,230
It didn't generate
much enthusiasm elsewhere.

383
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,067
But what do you think we'll find
at the end of the tunnel, Michael?

384
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:03,493
- A martini.
- Probably.

385
00:28:10,407 --> 00:28:11,868
Hey!

386
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:26,881
<i>- Operator.
- Berkeley 5558, please.</i>

387
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,852
Hello, Jean.
It's me.

388
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:38,397
<i>- Jean, I know you're there.
- I'd given up waiting.</i>

389
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:41,602
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to manage...

390
00:28:41,764 --> 00:28:44,131
<i>Oppie, I've been so frightened.</i>

391
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:47,259
<i>You don't phone. You don't write.
Not even a message.</i>

392
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:49,119
<i>- I can't.
- You can't?</i>

393
00:28:49,284 --> 00:28:51,805
<i>No, Jean, I can't.</i>

394
00:28:52,004 --> 00:28:53,531
<i>- Are you coming?
- Well...</i>

395
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,414
<i>- When are you coming?
- Jean.</i>

396
00:28:58,052 --> 00:29:00,899
<i>This isn't talking.
This is just making noises.</i>

397
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:03,164
<i>Why don't we just grunt
at each other?</i>

398
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:05,982
<i>- ''I gotta run. There's a war to win.''
- Jean.</i>

399
00:29:06,148 --> 00:29:09,442
<i>I can't remember a day
I wasn't hurting, except with you.</i>

400
00:29:09,602 --> 00:29:13,279
Jean, listen to me.
You've got to understand, please.

401
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:40,185
Yes?

402
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:43,903
I won't keep you, general.

403
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:45,625
Well, you better had.

404
00:29:45,793 --> 00:29:48,695
Banging on my door
at 2:00 in the morning.

405
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:54,329
I had this typed up, sir.
I thought you'd wanna see it.

406
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,117
She's working him over, general.
I've seen this before.

407
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,734
That grunting at each other,
could be a code.

408
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:07,166
- The cipher clerk said it's not code.
- Who is this woman?

409
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:10,589
Jean Tatlock, sir.
She's a known communist.

410
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:12,955
Get me her background.

411
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:17,692
And maybe I am missing some stuff
on the good doctor.

412
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,743
- Get it for me.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:23,699
This must throw Oppenheimer's
position on this project into doubt, sir.

414
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,035
- Dr. Oppenheimer is the project.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:32,021
All due respect, sir, though, doesn't
this make him an unacceptable risk?

416
00:30:32,223 --> 00:30:35,069
No! Failure's a risk.

417
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:40,599
The thing that concerns me is,
if he's with her, he's not with us.

418
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:47,705
It might be a good time
to put the screws to the doctor.

419
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,902
Yes, sir. May I ask,
how do you intend to do that, sir?

420
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,404
No, colonel, you may not.

421
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:22,746
- Compression not uniform.
- Stand by!

422
00:31:22,908 --> 00:31:26,486
If we had a thinner wall, we could
increase the compression, yes?

423
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,277
Seth, there's an answer here.

424
00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:30,831
Oppie, maybe implosion's
just a blind alley.

425
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:32,660
- Are we going again?
- Yes!

426
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:36,154
- That's an excuse for not thinking...
- We'll get reset.

427
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:42,195
All clear!
Reset the charges!

428
00:31:42,363 --> 00:31:45,080
Reset the charges!

429
00:31:45,243 --> 00:31:48,177
- We got all clear! Let's go!
- Let's move!

430
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:52,405
- Move it!
- On the double! On the double! Go!

431
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,596
- Move it! Move it!
- Bring it in! Left side! Left side!

432
00:31:57,177 --> 00:31:59,185
Come on!
Get the lead out!

433
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:01,971
On the double, guys!
Let's go!

434
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:04,568
Canyon to Los Alamos.

435
00:32:08,153 --> 00:32:09,941
Come in, Los Alamos.

436
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:12,146
Canyon to Los Alamos.

437
00:32:15,928 --> 00:32:18,099
Come in, Los Alamos. Come in.

438
00:32:19,928 --> 00:32:23,638
- Something set off the detonators.
- Stay back! They're wired in series.

439
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,492
Get out of there!

440
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:32,813
- No, Oppie.
- Shit.

441
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:48,142
It's all right.

442
00:32:50,645 --> 00:32:52,401
Take it easy, brother.

443
00:32:56,597 --> 00:32:58,091
Thanks a lot.

444
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,710
Do me a favor.
Jump in the ambulance.

445
00:33:01,878 --> 00:33:03,503
Let me give you
the once-over.

446
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:06,669
You guys are playing
with some funny stuff out here.

447
00:33:10,262 --> 00:33:12,203
Let's go. Start them up.

448
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:27,250
Did they teach you that at high school?

449
00:33:28,596 --> 00:33:30,603
You took a risk.

450
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:34,579
I ran out and grabbed the guy.
I didn't even think.

451
00:33:34,741 --> 00:33:37,642
- Just instinct.
- Instinct, huh?

452
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,064
You know, I wonder,
with this war...

453
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:45,675
...if it's instinct to save a man,
what makes us want to kill one?

454
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:47,978
Is that instinct?

455
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:52,179
You sound like my old man.

456
00:33:52,403 --> 00:33:53,680
Why, what's he like?

457
00:33:53,843 --> 00:33:56,014
- My old man?
- Yeah.

458
00:33:57,266 --> 00:33:58,990
He's a preacher.

459
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,027
In Jackson, Illinois.

460
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:06,699
And I got an older brother,
Jimmy, and he's a soldier.

461
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:08,842
My mom's dead.

462
00:34:09,011 --> 00:34:12,654
I don't know, I guess he's kind of
hurt that I'm not at the front.

463
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,947
- Why?
- Well, Jackson is a small town.

464
00:34:16,146 --> 00:34:19,375
- He said, ''Where you going?''
- I said, ''Santa Fe, New Mexico.''

465
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:23,466
- I know.
- So that didn't quite hack it.

466
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:26,256
He said,
''lf you're not gonna be a soldier,

467
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:28,807
''you better be a good scientist.
The best.''

468
00:34:29,138 --> 00:34:32,717
- Are you the best?
- I was in Chicago.

469
00:34:33,745 --> 00:34:35,501
But these guys are so bright.

470
00:34:36,656 --> 00:34:38,991
Sometimes I feel like
I'm in over my head.

471
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:42,186
But I guess I can handle
anything they throw at me.

472
00:34:43,888 --> 00:34:45,677
But can you dance?

473
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,302
Pardon me?

474
00:34:48,976 --> 00:34:51,178
I said, can you dance?

475
00:34:52,047 --> 00:34:55,179
- Yeah.
- Well, do it.

476
00:34:55,632 --> 00:34:58,598
- Are you serious?
- Can't handle it?

477
00:35:22,095 --> 00:35:23,850
Very nice.

478
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,873
- Something like that.
- Very good.

479
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:02,308
Jean Tatlock, graduated in 1932.

480
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:05,607
They had a thing together
before Oppenheimer was married.

481
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:07,299
Seems Tatlock ran off.

482
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:10,468
Things went on the back burner
between them till 1942.

483
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,260
Then it all started up again.

484
00:36:12,426 --> 00:36:16,583
His associate said, ''lf the wife's
his ambition, Tatlock's his conscience.''

485
00:36:16,747 --> 00:36:20,741
She introduced him to a number of
anti-fascist groups, anti-Franco groups

486
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,367
and a number of communists.

487
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:23,782
- Bronson.
- Sir.

488
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:27,524
Little less muscle on the gas here.
Colonel's starting a mission.

489
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,900
I'd like him alive.

490
00:36:29,226 --> 00:36:30,436
Yes, sir.

491
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:33,450
This makes Oppenheimer
a sitting duck for blackmail.

492
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:35,911
I'm gonna insist on his removal.

493
00:36:36,073 --> 00:36:38,375
No, you're not. Just relax.

494
00:36:38,538 --> 00:36:42,978
You know, major, if you want
to lead a man in a certain direction,

495
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:45,632
you don't drag him by the nose.

496
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:48,007
You just close off his options.

497
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:50,274
Simple as a truck.

498
00:36:54,984 --> 00:36:56,839
<i>Here we are in the top of the ninth.</i>

499
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,367
<i>The Army down
to the Scientists by one run.</i>

500
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:04,065
<i>Dugan shakes it off.
Here's Merriman's pitch.</i>

501
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:05,825
<i>That's a hit.</i>

502
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:08,643
<i>Dugan digging for first base,
gonna go for two.</i>

503
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:12,223
<i>Look out. Here's the throw.
Safe at second base on a slide.</i>

504
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:15,175
<i>Apple scores.
That ties the game.</i>

505
00:37:22,664 --> 00:37:24,038
Yes?

506
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:27,421
Yes?!

507
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:32,892
Bad time?

508
00:37:33,062 --> 00:37:36,543
The velocity's still presenting us
with something of a problem.

509
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,489
Who's this bimbo
you're running around with?

510
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:48,097
- What?
- Do I have to tell you?

511
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:51,298
I got it on the q.t.
from somebody who owes me.

512
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:53,501
What if the next guy
doesn't owe me?

513
00:37:53,702 --> 00:37:56,222
Takes that kind of information
to the wrong guy?

514
00:37:56,422 --> 00:38:00,644
That could be the end of you.
Could be the end of this project.

515
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:03,203
I don't understand you.

516
00:38:04,453 --> 00:38:07,966
You think you're some kind
of bohemian or something.

517
00:38:11,715 --> 00:38:13,626
Blind-sided.

518
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,105
I never expected to get
blind-sided like this.

519
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:27,642
<i>And there it is.
A line drive.</i>

520
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:32,483
Doctor, might I be of assistance?

521
00:38:32,642 --> 00:38:35,961
What about me in all this?
This looks bad.

522
00:38:36,163 --> 00:38:39,644
Reflects on me.
Reflects on my ability to choose men.

523
00:38:39,811 --> 00:38:43,553
I was with this woman before
this project. This is not a new thing.

524
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,599
It's no matter.

525
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:50,204
I am not comfortable with the idea
that you could sink me.

526
00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:56,513
This is someone that I care about.

527
00:38:56,675 --> 00:38:58,812
She's a communist.

528
00:39:00,259 --> 00:39:01,687
A communist.

529
00:39:02,689 --> 00:39:04,063
Oh, my God.

530
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:06,779
It would be bad enough if she
were just some...

531
00:39:06,946 --> 00:39:08,701
...sweet young thing from Indiana.

532
00:39:08,865 --> 00:39:10,775
She's a card-carrying communist.

533
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:15,778
And your job, classified job. What do
I have to do, draw you a map?

534
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:19,166
Get on the phone, a secure line,
tell her...goodbye!

535
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:21,053
<i>The pitch. It's a line drive!</i>

536
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:25,565
<i>It's out of there! It's gone!
Home run for Merriman.</i>

537
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:27,613
Home run!

538
00:39:29,985 --> 00:39:32,733
- It's all right, Bronson, we'll live.
- Yes, sir.

539
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:35,286
<i>Well, that's it, folks,
Scientists win the game.</i>

540
00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:36,982
It's in your court.

541
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:53,561
Bridges, next time keep your head up.

542
00:39:55,231 --> 00:39:57,303
<i>All hail the conquering hero.</i>

543
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:01,082
<i>Pencil pushers defeat
the doughboys.</i>

544
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,750
Robert!

545
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,761
- Frank.
- Good to see you, bro.

546
00:40:56,764 --> 00:40:59,546
- Are we being followed or something?
- Don't joke.

547
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,616
I nearly asked you for your ID.

548
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:05,586
- That's ridiculous.
- Let's just leave as soon as we can.

549
00:41:14,491 --> 00:41:17,905
They've been hounding me
for names of every person I've known

550
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:19,635
who had communist sympathies.

551
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:23,832
They monitor every move I make.
They listen to my phone conversations.

552
00:41:23,994 --> 00:41:25,455
Why stay?

553
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,512
There's an order to it.

554
00:41:27,675 --> 00:41:30,543
An order in some part of my life,
at least.

555
00:41:30,713 --> 00:41:34,095
I'm sorry, I didn't get your message
till about 5.

556
00:41:34,264 --> 00:41:39,087
I was still at the hospital, and I got
all whizzed up into a huge panic.

557
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,883
You look wonderful.

558
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,633
You look so serious.
What's the matter?

559
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,959
I don't have much time.
I have to go back tonight.

560
00:41:48,121 --> 00:41:49,583
Tonight?

561
00:41:49,754 --> 00:41:51,640
I cooked us dinner.

562
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:01,230
This can't be about dinner, Jean.

563
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:05,773
I didn't want to tell you
on the telephone.

564
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:09,138
And that's why I'm here tonight.

565
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,952
Is it because of what you're doing?

566
00:42:28,951 --> 00:42:30,773
Fine.

567
00:42:31,574 --> 00:42:35,436
We're going to spill the blood
before we get to the cocktails.

568
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,742
Jean?

569
00:42:51,412 --> 00:42:54,729
Please...stay tonight.

570
00:42:55,669 --> 00:42:57,076
Please.

571
00:42:58,196 --> 00:42:59,757
Please.

572
00:43:02,677 --> 00:43:04,236
Please.

573
00:43:04,404 --> 00:43:06,705
Please.

574
00:43:30,547 --> 00:43:33,862
What you're working on,
it's something bad, isn't it?

575
00:43:34,034 --> 00:43:35,922
That's why you can't tell me.

576
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:38,668
I can't tell you
because it's a secret.

577
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:42,225
Tell me one good thing
that's a secret.

578
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:44,210
We were a good thing.

579
00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:46,790
No, we weren't.

580
00:43:46,993 --> 00:43:49,034
Not when you got married.

581
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,163
Give me up for something
I can understand.

582
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,718
Your wife or your child
or your conscience,

583
00:43:55,922 --> 00:43:57,580
something alive.

584
00:43:57,746 --> 00:44:00,331
Not something
that you have to hide.

585
00:44:01,073 --> 00:44:02,567
Robert.

586
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,853
Oh, Robert, I dreamt you'd gone.

587
00:44:45,902 --> 00:44:48,685
So that's what the silences were.

588
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:51,565
No letters, no contact.

589
00:44:53,198 --> 00:44:55,719
I thought it was me,
something I'd done.

590
00:44:55,919 --> 00:44:59,976
- I've told you it has nothing to do...
- Yes, but you didn't tell me...

591
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:05,192
What is it you're working on?
What is so important?

592
00:45:05,356 --> 00:45:07,746
That's right. It is important.

593
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:10,090
So don't be so goddamn arrogant.

594
00:45:10,254 --> 00:45:12,805
Is it arrogant to want
to know where you are?

595
00:45:12,973 --> 00:45:16,684
What's happening to you? To want
to be close to you? To understand?

596
00:45:20,204 --> 00:45:22,113
This was the man I loved.

597
00:45:22,669 --> 00:45:25,930
I loved his dreams.
I loved what he saw but couldn't prove.

598
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:28,743
I loved the goodness in him.

599
00:45:28,909 --> 00:45:32,486
He was my proof that the world
could be made better.

600
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:35,713
And if he's dead, I don't want to live.

601
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:41,767
The world is...different.

602
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:45,096
It's just not what we
wanted it to be.

603
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,885
It's just not.

604
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:56,745
You mattered to me so much.

605
00:45:57,835 --> 00:46:00,006
You really did.

606
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,908
She told me that I had
a penchant for destruction.

607
00:46:16,427 --> 00:46:18,215
That I'd lost faith.

608
00:46:19,017 --> 00:46:21,089
Is she wrong?

609
00:46:21,353 --> 00:46:22,946
No.

610
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,487
She's not wrong.

611
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:30,686
When this war's over, I want
to ride the mesa for six months.

612
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,318
No deadlines.

613
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:34,469
Nothing.

614
00:46:39,623 --> 00:46:41,184
Thanks, Frank.

615
00:46:41,351 --> 00:46:43,359
He just kissed his brother.

616
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:45,350
Gotta be a communist.

617
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:03,039
Set that over there.

618
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:09,373
Look at it, Oppie, it's twisted.
It's got to be flat.

619
00:47:09,542 --> 00:47:13,765
I think implosion's nothing but a pipe
dream. I'm sorry I thought of it.

620
00:47:13,927 --> 00:47:15,486
I can't do it.

621
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:19,778
Oppie, some way I have to focus...
I have to focus the shock waves.

622
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:22,403
Look at me!
God, I'm running out of ideas.

623
00:47:22,566 --> 00:47:26,342
That's an excuse for not thinking.
If you can't, I'll find somebody else.

624
00:47:26,503 --> 00:47:29,536
Oppie? Serber needs
you back at the lab right now.

625
00:47:29,702 --> 00:47:31,611
- Oppie?
- You said it yourself.

626
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:35,523
Focus. Somebody's working on a way
to focus an explosive shock wave.

627
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:38,369
- I'm gonna find him. Keep working.
- Jesus!

628
00:47:44,453 --> 00:47:48,543
You know, if Oppie doesn't let up,
he's going to implode.

629
00:48:00,772 --> 00:48:03,073
Inside. Inside.

630
00:48:07,332 --> 00:48:10,648
Good news is the new plutonium
makes lots of neutrons.

631
00:48:10,852 --> 00:48:14,561
But the bad news is the spontaneous
fission rate is way too high.

632
00:48:14,723 --> 00:48:18,335
The reaction will run away with itself.
There will just be a fizzle.

633
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:21,531
- No explosion.
- You're certain of that, Edward?

634
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,673
- Who did the calculations?
- Serber.

635
00:48:23,843 --> 00:48:26,559
- Himself?
- Serber, personally.

636
00:48:26,914 --> 00:48:31,354
So now plutonium is a problem. That
shifts the emphasis back to U-235.

637
00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:35,450
Of course, Oak Ridge is not able
to produce that in sufficient quantity.

638
00:48:35,649 --> 00:48:38,999
We must go with implosion, but
Neddermeyer has just announced to me

639
00:48:39,202 --> 00:48:42,517
that he and implosion
have just reached a brick wall.

640
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:47,451
We can't fall behind.

641
00:48:49,536 --> 00:48:51,195
Are you all right, Oppie?

642
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:53,238
You have a deadline to meet.

643
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:59,103
Banked almost a billion dollars on you
guys. That's not working on the cheap.

644
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:01,950
Only thing I want to hear is, ''Yes, sir.''

645
00:49:02,112 --> 00:49:06,072
Don't talk to me like I haven't given
eight days a week to this project.

646
00:49:06,272 --> 00:49:07,798
I've given up everything.

647
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,887
Don't... Don't give me that.

648
00:49:10,144 --> 00:49:12,085
I don't want to hear
that from the...

649
00:49:12,288 --> 00:49:14,011
I've given up everything.

650
00:49:14,176 --> 00:49:16,508
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

651
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,027
I don't give a goddamn
that travel was restricted.

652
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,703
It had to be done face to face,
and that's the way I did it.

653
00:49:29,214 --> 00:49:31,419
<i>Latest news
from the fighting front.</i>

654
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:37,527
<i>American armies are pushing the
Germans back on their own territory.</i>

655
00:49:37,694 --> 00:49:39,124
<i>But fighting is desperate.</i>

656
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:42,458
<i>The Germans are building up
for a massive counter thrust.</i>

657
00:49:42,622 --> 00:49:45,557
<i>Though the Allies are determined
to hold this new front...</i>

658
00:49:45,757 --> 00:49:46,967
Who's the Lone Ranger?

659
00:49:47,133 --> 00:49:49,140
Explosives wiz.
I don't know about Tonto.

660
00:49:49,309 --> 00:49:51,765
<i>Neddermeyer gave up
on his explosion that goes in.</i>

661
00:49:51,933 --> 00:49:53,144
<i>Not Oppie, though.</i>

662
00:49:53,309 --> 00:49:56,342
<i>He brought in two explosive
experts from the outside.</i>

663
00:49:56,541 --> 00:49:58,712
<i>We struggle on here
in our isolation.</i>

664
00:49:58,878 --> 00:50:01,976
<i>And sometimes the war
seems a long way away.</i>

665
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:08,694
You want a ride, doc?

666
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,025
Hey, Seth. When did you
get your driver's license?

667
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:17,883
- You come to see the boys at play?
- Yes.

668
00:50:18,076 --> 00:50:20,248
- Oh, bad news, beautiful.
- Oh, no.

669
00:50:20,412 --> 00:50:22,865
I'm not gonna be able to make
that movie tonight.

670
00:50:23,163 --> 00:50:26,512
I can join you both for a drink.
It would make you happy.

671
00:50:26,683 --> 00:50:28,537
- Sound good?
- Perfect.

672
00:50:29,179 --> 00:50:31,351
Right, right.

673
00:50:31,516 --> 00:50:35,312
Well, I promised the monkey
we'd be cutting a rug anyway.

674
00:50:35,483 --> 00:50:37,305
It's just as well.

675
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,020
Michael, what's wrong with you?

676
00:50:41,434 --> 00:50:43,027
Do you see much of him?

677
00:50:43,226 --> 00:50:45,049
Yes, I like him.

678
00:50:48,955 --> 00:50:50,416
Are you jealous?

679
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,420
Yeah.

680
00:50:56,665 --> 00:50:58,454
You better do something about it.

681
00:51:12,217 --> 00:51:14,672
Tell them I ain't buying.
White House said

682
00:51:14,873 --> 00:51:17,590
there wouldn't be
any account till after the war.

683
00:51:19,514 --> 00:51:21,749
It's so damn tough
to get through to you,

684
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,051
I decided to bring
you my problem.

685
00:51:24,217 --> 00:51:27,444
See the tread on that tire?
Because I sure as hell don't.

686
00:51:27,607 --> 00:51:30,029
Yet that's what my men
are riding around on.

687
00:51:31,032 --> 00:51:34,479
I don't know what kind of deal
you got yourself into, Groves,

688
00:51:34,647 --> 00:51:37,233
but I do care when it cuts
in on my territory.

689
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:40,913
If I'm gonna move supplies around
the country, I need trucks.

690
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,053
Those trucks run on tires, Dick.

691
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:47,215
When I hear they ain't moving because
of some tire shortage, I get mad.

692
00:51:47,414 --> 00:51:50,196
When I hear you're the cause
of it, I want to kill.

693
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:54,133
- We gotta work something...
- No dice. We got a triple-A priority.

694
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:57,325
White House authority.
We need the product.

695
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:01,676
You need to know something.

696
00:52:01,846 --> 00:52:04,115
You're getting a lot
of people's backs up.

697
00:52:04,662 --> 00:52:07,182
Let me remind you of something else.
See this?

698
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:08,658
I count two. You got one.

699
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:12,117
When this war's over,
that will amount to something.

700
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,449
And, Dick, I hope you get my meaning.

701
00:52:18,646 --> 00:52:21,133
Because, by all that's holy...

702
00:52:21,653 --> 00:52:23,889
...you better have
your ass well-covered.

703
00:52:34,581 --> 00:52:36,620
- Well, Bronson.
- Sir?

704
00:52:36,979 --> 00:52:39,697
- It's all about ass, isn't it?
- Sir?

705
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,281
You kick it or you lick it.

706
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,590
That's what it's all about.

707
00:52:45,172 --> 00:52:47,212
I'm sorry about
my language, Bronson.

708
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:49,006
But I'm on the limb.

709
00:52:50,259 --> 00:52:52,497
My prima donnas
better come through...

710
00:52:52,852 --> 00:52:55,720
...or you are looking
at a piece of dead meat.

711
00:52:56,243 --> 00:52:57,453
Yes, sir.

712
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,800
- What's this?
- I don't know, sir.

713
00:53:11,283 --> 00:53:12,655
God, almighty.

714
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:14,508
Is this a stop?

715
00:53:14,673 --> 00:53:17,292
What time is it?
There's no scheduled stop here.

716
00:53:26,929 --> 00:53:29,068
Message for General Groves.

717
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:34,085
- I'll see what the problem is, sir.
- Message for General Groves.

718
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:37,355
- Message for General Groves.
- In this way.

719
00:53:43,088 --> 00:53:45,357
General Groves, sir.
This is from Germany.

720
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,902
It was flown in. We wired
ahead to have the train stopped.

721
00:53:49,072 --> 00:53:50,927
Excuse me, gentlemen.

722
00:54:05,103 --> 00:54:07,722
- Colonel.
- General.

723
00:54:11,536 --> 00:54:13,869
Put it in my safe, in the back.

724
00:54:14,511 --> 00:54:15,721
Don't bring it out.

725
00:54:18,607 --> 00:54:21,356
That means the Germans don't
have the bomb. Weren't close.

726
00:54:21,518 --> 00:54:24,517
Sir, is it wise?
I mean, suppressing this?

727
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,619
Well, you tell me, colonel.

728
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,088
It's delicate stuff.

729
00:54:32,174 --> 00:54:34,792
I'm talking about my longhairs,
my prima donnas.

730
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:36,518
The Jewish element.

731
00:54:37,229 --> 00:54:41,320
Take Hitler out of the equation...
they might just run out of stink.

732
00:54:41,485 --> 00:54:43,394
Why chance it?

733
00:54:44,173 --> 00:54:47,522
We can give this country
the biggest stick in the playground.

734
00:54:47,693 --> 00:54:49,416
And I intend to do that.

735
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:54,115
And I'll tell you something
about our bunch.

736
00:54:54,285 --> 00:54:55,713
Get them close.

737
00:54:56,621 --> 00:54:58,759
Then they'll go all the way.

738
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:01,931
They're just not close enough yet.

739
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:03,619
Yes, sir.

740
00:55:11,243 --> 00:55:15,105
Perhaps you should think of these
wedges as forming part of a shell.

741
00:55:15,435 --> 00:55:20,389
They do redirect the shock waves in
the same way as a lens redirects light.

742
00:55:20,556 --> 00:55:24,035
As a matter of interest, we've
already used the idea in England

743
00:55:24,203 --> 00:55:26,342
for armor-piercing shells.

744
00:55:29,963 --> 00:55:32,384
Pray it works.
We'll be back on schedule.

745
00:55:32,587 --> 00:55:33,929
Heads up.

746
00:55:34,987 --> 00:55:36,131
Watch your backs.

747
00:56:01,512 --> 00:56:04,360
No one ever used high explosives...

748
00:56:04,521 --> 00:56:07,750
...as a precision instrument before.

749
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:09,795
It's so simple.

750
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,310
It just swings the shock waves
from convex to concave.

751
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:16,382
- Some orange, hey, Oppie?
- No, after the explosion.

752
00:56:21,928 --> 00:56:23,520
Dr. Oppenheimer.

753
00:56:24,103 --> 00:56:25,313
Dr. Oppenheimer.

754
00:56:25,479 --> 00:56:26,724
A letter for you, sir.

755
00:56:26,888 --> 00:56:29,342
- They said it was important.
- Thank you.

756
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,410
Good luck.

757
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,334
<i>We squeezed it!
Damn it, we got compression!</i>

758
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:45,245
<i>We're on the way!
The right mix and we're home, Oppie!</i>

759
00:57:45,408 --> 00:57:47,775
<i>We're home free, vindicated!
We're vindicated!</i>

760
00:57:47,936 --> 00:57:50,838
- We got a ball game here.
- Seth, come here!

761
00:57:51,488 --> 00:57:53,593
Next stop, implosion!

762
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:24,446
Can I come in?

763
00:58:25,025 --> 00:58:26,748
Where is he?

764
00:58:26,912 --> 00:58:28,538
He's out back.

765
00:58:29,152 --> 00:58:32,054
Sitting in the sun
with a blanket on his lap.

766
00:58:32,896 --> 00:58:35,679
Nursing a guilty dick, no doubt.

767
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,128
It is not necessary to be vulgar.

768
00:58:41,408 --> 00:58:43,677
Nothing I say could
approach the vulgarity

769
00:58:43,873 --> 00:58:46,077
of what you're building
in your back yard.

770
00:58:48,384 --> 00:58:51,679
Well, vulgar or not...

771
00:58:52,193 --> 00:58:54,232
...I need him to come
through on this.

772
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,175
He owes it to his country.
He owes it to himself.

773
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,488
He is the best there is. And he
should have whatever he wants.

774
00:59:02,657 --> 00:59:06,170
Don't try to recruit me, general.
You don't need my help.

775
00:59:06,528 --> 00:59:10,423
And spare me your homily on being
a good wife. I know it by heart.

776
00:59:11,585 --> 00:59:14,006
Why did you put up with her
for so long?

777
00:59:15,169 --> 00:59:18,998
Because he's the best there is.
He should have whatever he wants.

778
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:26,495
I don't live very well alone.

779
00:59:26,657 --> 00:59:27,966
Some people don't.

780
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:31,612
We all have different ways
of defending our territory.

781
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:40,631
Concha, you're late.
Peter, hurry up. Didn't I say 2:00?

782
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:49,302
I'm sorry.

783
00:59:52,097 --> 00:59:56,766
And I am sorry that the news
took so long to get to you.

784
00:59:56,929 --> 00:59:59,199
It just got lost
in the system censors.

785
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,107
You know...

786
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:08,094
...you can't be responsible
for keeping somebody else alive.

787
01:00:09,473 --> 01:00:12,026
It isn't possible.
It's not to be expected.

788
01:00:12,929 --> 01:00:15,351
I can't work on this anymore.

789
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:24,092
I don't want to.

790
01:00:25,345 --> 01:00:26,906
And I don't need to.

791
01:00:27,073 --> 01:00:29,113
Germany is finished.

792
01:00:29,953 --> 01:00:33,215
It's just a matter of time.
They can't pull this together.

793
01:00:33,762 --> 01:00:36,664
- You sure?
- I don't want to hear your arguments.

794
01:00:38,306 --> 01:00:41,208
I already know that everything is a risk.

795
01:00:41,378 --> 01:00:43,833
That the war is not over until it's over.

796
01:00:44,002 --> 01:00:47,035
That they're lobbing rockets
all over London.

797
01:00:47,202 --> 01:00:50,464
That Germany is desperate.
That she's resourceful.

798
01:00:50,657 --> 01:00:53,374
If she doesn't get a device,
she could litter England

799
01:00:53,537 --> 01:00:56,799
with radioactive material.
We thought of something similar.

800
01:00:56,961 --> 01:00:58,816
The fact of the matter is...

801
01:00:58,978 --> 01:01:02,044
...they're not as good as we are.
Or are they?

802
01:01:08,162 --> 01:01:10,301
Christ, I've got rats in my skull.

803
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:17,276
I'm being asked to throw too many
balls in the air at the same time.

804
01:01:20,258 --> 01:01:22,843
When I feel like that,
I get down on my knees...

805
01:01:24,578 --> 01:01:25,855
...and I pray.

806
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:29,178
And that's how I get conviction.

807
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:33,499
If you let this slip through your fingers,
through our fingers,

808
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:35,357
and somebody else gets it...

809
01:01:36,834 --> 01:01:39,998
...you won't be counting how many
balls you throw in the air.

810
01:01:44,707 --> 01:01:47,903
If you need the fire, you find it.

811
01:01:48,995 --> 01:01:50,588
Wherever.

812
01:01:58,595 --> 01:02:00,024
<i>At last, some good news.</i>

813
01:02:00,226 --> 01:02:04,285
<i>Apparently, sufficient uranium is
beginning to arrive from Oak Ridge.</i>

814
01:02:04,451 --> 01:02:08,280
<i>But, as brilliant as he is, Oppie's
beginning to show the strain.</i>

815
01:02:08,962 --> 01:02:10,391
<i>We all depend on Oppie.</i>

816
01:02:10,563 --> 01:02:12,450
<i>He's our inspiration.</i>

817
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:15,425
<i>If he were to crack, we'd all fall apart.</i>

818
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:20,633
Beautiful, isn't it, Michael?
Just think...

819
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:24,098
...a few miles closer to the sun,
a few miles farther away,

820
01:02:24,259 --> 01:02:26,877
none of this would be here.
Just a cloud of gas

821
01:02:27,075 --> 01:02:29,376
or a block of ice
and nobody to enjoy it.

822
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:32,858
''Odi et amor'',
''I hate and I love.''

823
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:35,393
- Catullus. Do you know it?
- No.

824
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:41,633
<i>I hate and I love
Why, you ask? I don't know</i>

825
01:02:42,499 --> 01:02:46,176
<i>I feel both
And I'm in agony</i>

826
01:02:47,299 --> 01:02:51,903
Maybe General Groves is right. Maybe
we should just banish thinking forever.

827
01:02:55,683 --> 01:02:58,171
Michael, we have to test
the critical mass.

828
01:02:59,267 --> 01:03:02,496
- Are you going to help?
- Of course.

829
01:03:03,459 --> 01:03:05,598
I want to show you something.

830
01:03:22,915 --> 01:03:25,981
Come here to see our little toy, huh?

831
01:03:28,163 --> 01:03:32,157
Michael, that's what we call
tickling the dragon's tail.

832
01:03:32,355 --> 01:03:35,803
So a slug of uranium
about two by six inches

833
01:03:36,004 --> 01:03:38,459
will be pulled by this weight.

834
01:03:38,884 --> 01:03:42,942
It begins here, then accelerates
at 32 feet per second per second.

835
01:03:43,107 --> 01:03:46,882
It passes between uranium bricks.
We have an instant of criticality.

836
01:03:47,043 --> 01:03:50,207
For a split second,
we have a chain reaction.

837
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:53,338
As close as we come
to an atomic explosion in the lab.

838
01:03:53,507 --> 01:03:55,646
- Without blowing up.
- Exactly.

839
01:03:55,812 --> 01:03:59,554
It's essential to determine the amount
of material the device needs.

840
01:03:59,716 --> 01:04:02,586
Ten years ago I could
hardly imagine the stuff.

841
01:04:02,788 --> 01:04:04,195
Ten years.

842
01:04:04,356 --> 01:04:08,218
Each molecule collected
out of the air, one by one.

843
01:04:11,172 --> 01:04:12,699
Hello?

844
01:04:14,404 --> 01:04:15,614
What?

845
01:04:25,604 --> 01:04:29,084
<i>I have the rare privilege
of speaking for a victorious army</i>

846
01:04:29,252 --> 01:04:31,324
<i>of almost five million fighting men.</i>

847
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:34,176
<i>They and the women
who have so ably assisted them</i>

848
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:36,761
<i>constitute the Allied
Expeditionary Force</i>

849
01:04:36,964 --> 01:04:39,298
<i>that has liberated Western Europe.</i>

850
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,882
<i>They have destroyed
or captured enemy armies</i>

851
01:04:42,084 --> 01:04:44,157
<i>totaling more than their own strength</i>

852
01:04:44,324 --> 01:04:47,772
<i>and swept triumphantly forward
over the hundreds of miles</i>

853
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:49,762
<i>separating Cherbourg from Lbeck,</i>

854
01:04:49,924 --> 01:04:51,168
<i>Leipzig and Munich.</i>

855
01:04:51,332 --> 01:04:53,853
<i>These startling successes
have not been bought</i>

856
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,679
<i>without sorrow and suffering.</i>

857
01:04:55,845 --> 01:04:58,562
<i>In this theater alone,
80,000 Americans</i>

858
01:04:58,725 --> 01:05:00,830
<i>and comparable numbers
among the allies</i>

859
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:02,819
<i>have had their lives cut short</i>

860
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:07,322
<i>so that the rest of us might live
in the sunlight of freedom.</i>

861
01:05:17,573 --> 01:05:19,645
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

862
01:05:19,812 --> 01:05:22,179
What are we gonna do
when this is over?

863
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,445
I don't know.
Probably start another one.

864
01:05:24,612 --> 01:05:28,638
That's what I love about this job.
A guaranteed future. I'm not wrong.

865
01:05:28,804 --> 01:05:32,317
Believe me, we're descended
from a long line of noble predators.

866
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:34,403
You are irrepressible.

867
01:05:34,916 --> 01:05:37,950
I think I'm gonna go be
irrepressible down with Fuller.

868
01:05:38,148 --> 01:05:39,839
Come on, baby face.

869
01:05:41,477 --> 01:05:44,444
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm irrepressible.

870
01:05:44,868 --> 01:05:46,275
So, what are you writing?

871
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:48,673
Something Oppie said today.
I don't know.

872
01:05:48,837 --> 01:05:50,593
Well, read it. Go on.

873
01:05:53,764 --> 01:05:56,099
Makes you wonder
if there's an intelligence

874
01:05:56,261 --> 01:05:59,076
that isn't descended
from a long line of predators.

875
01:06:01,509 --> 01:06:03,134
I want to kiss you.

876
01:06:04,101 --> 01:06:05,530
Come here.

877
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:15,586
Sir, is it true that since we KO'd
Germany, we're gonna go home?

878
01:06:15,749 --> 01:06:18,815
- I'll drink to that.
- That might be true, soldier.

879
01:06:22,693 --> 01:06:25,279
Can I have your attention, please?
Please.

880
01:06:25,638 --> 01:06:26,848
Excuse me.

881
01:06:27,013 --> 01:06:30,810
Seems to me that we have a shortage
of dance partners on the floor.

882
01:06:30,981 --> 01:06:33,370
So as a tribute
to our men in uniform...

883
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:37,092
...l'd like to make
available the services

884
01:06:37,254 --> 01:06:40,320
of all the longhairs at Los Alamos
on this dance floor.

885
01:06:40,486 --> 01:06:43,333
And to break
the ceremonial ice,

886
01:06:43,493 --> 01:06:46,657
I will choose
the first dance partner.

887
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:56,289
General Groves...
may I have this dance?

888
01:06:58,918 --> 01:07:00,674
Why not?

889
01:07:28,038 --> 01:07:31,813
- Why do you have that with you?
- I keep it as a record for my dad.

890
01:07:31,974 --> 01:07:34,844
If I wrote him a letter,
all he'd get is black lines.

891
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:37,185
This way I can tell him
what's going on.

892
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:39,619
And what are you gonna
write about today?

893
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:42,947
Besides the war being over?

894
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:44,320
Yeah.

895
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:49,663
Well, I met this girl.

896
01:07:53,222 --> 01:07:55,262
Did I just kiss you up there?

897
01:08:02,406 --> 01:08:05,755
You gotta bring your heads in out
of the clouds. Out of the clouds.

898
01:08:07,399 --> 01:08:10,432
Keep the muttering to a minimum,
please, gentlemen.

899
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,820
Some of you dancing...

900
01:08:14,982 --> 01:08:16,989
...close together.

901
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:20,987
I don't like the look of it.

902
01:08:21,543 --> 01:08:26,431
There are...bosoms in the area.

903
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:31,363
And this could lead to pregnancy.

904
01:08:31,847 --> 01:08:35,295
Any man getting caught out of hand
or getting caught in hand

905
01:08:35,462 --> 01:08:38,364
will have to turn their peckers
over to the FBI.

906
01:08:46,406 --> 01:08:49,440
They're having fun. That's nice.
They're entitled.

907
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:53,606
- So long as they don't think it's over.
- Isn't it?

908
01:08:55,206 --> 01:08:57,475
I mean,
what's all the celebration for?

909
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:01,188
Perhaps we can find
some other use for this work.

910
01:09:01,351 --> 01:09:02,529
Fascism's dead.

911
01:09:02,695 --> 01:09:04,353
You mean in Europe.

912
01:09:04,519 --> 01:09:07,486
What do they think Japan
is doing, shooting squirrels?

913
01:09:07,655 --> 01:09:11,168
No, they're not shooting squirrels,
and that's not the issue.

914
01:09:11,878 --> 01:09:13,253
What is the issue?

915
01:09:14,119 --> 01:09:17,664
They don't have the technology.
They're not capable of it.

916
01:09:17,831 --> 01:09:19,741
So if we don't need it...

917
01:09:19,911 --> 01:09:21,252
...why make it?

918
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:24,131
I want you to look at something.

919
01:09:24,967 --> 01:09:28,676
It's the largest collection
of nothing in the entire world.

920
01:09:30,535 --> 01:09:32,324
Make them work...

921
01:09:33,895 --> 01:09:35,554
...and you've got something.

922
01:09:36,295 --> 01:09:38,367
An irresistible something.

923
01:09:38,535 --> 01:09:40,161
Just the threat...

924
01:09:41,671 --> 01:09:43,362
...and they're ours.

925
01:09:45,255 --> 01:09:47,394
You know, sometimes,

926
01:09:47,559 --> 01:09:49,119
just standing here,

927
01:09:49,287 --> 01:09:51,142
I keep wondering.

928
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:54,949
Are we working on them
or are they working on us?

929
01:09:56,424 --> 01:10:00,198
Give them dignity, doctor.
Then we can start talking...

930
01:10:01,224 --> 01:10:03,078
...about who can do what...

931
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,651
...and what they mean.

932
01:10:26,984 --> 01:10:29,351
Oh, what time is it?

933
01:10:34,408 --> 01:10:38,750
Even when I sleep, it's like dogs
tearing at a piece of meat.

934
01:10:40,168 --> 01:10:41,793
Robert?

935
01:10:43,431 --> 01:10:45,406
Thinking of resigning?

936
01:10:45,576 --> 01:10:47,267
No.

937
01:10:49,992 --> 01:10:51,716
I'd be written off.

938
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,360
They wouldn't understand.
Not in the present climate.

939
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,182
I keep obsessing about the device.

940
01:11:02,856 --> 01:11:05,856
Yes, it's true, but...

941
01:11:08,104 --> 01:11:10,046
...if you think beyond...

942
01:11:11,304 --> 01:11:14,817
...it's a limitless supply of energy.
Think about it, Kitty.

943
01:11:15,656 --> 01:11:18,340
The power that drives the universe.

944
01:11:21,192 --> 01:11:23,331
It's beyond imagination, really.

945
01:11:23,496 --> 01:11:25,089
And we'd have tamed it.

946
01:11:27,592 --> 01:11:29,315
A new world.

947
01:11:38,441 --> 01:11:39,848
Go get them, cowboy.

948
01:11:54,472 --> 01:11:56,098
What's going on over there?

949
01:11:56,265 --> 01:11:59,974
Cattle destroyed the entire ground
cable run. Ruined two days' work.

950
01:12:02,408 --> 01:12:06,532
Why didn't they herd them outside
the site? Anyone suggest that?

951
01:12:06,696 --> 01:12:11,398
The ranchers wouldn't move them.
Seems the Army stopped negotiating.

952
01:12:16,552 --> 01:12:19,618
- This is out of control.
- Edward, these estimates...

953
01:12:19,784 --> 01:12:22,686
Rush, push, speed, deadlines.

954
01:12:22,857 --> 01:12:25,541
This whole project
has gotten out of control.

955
01:12:25,705 --> 01:12:28,672
We haven't thought about
the consequences, Oppie.

956
01:12:28,841 --> 01:12:30,434
- Oppie?
- Wilson!

957
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:33,383
We've been waiting
for the data for two weeks.

958
01:12:33,545 --> 01:12:35,487
When are we gonna get it?

959
01:12:38,889 --> 01:12:40,579
Wilson is correct.

960
01:12:40,745 --> 01:12:44,062
We have to talk about what we're
all thinking but not saying.

961
01:12:44,265 --> 01:12:47,331
This argument is arcane, Edward.

962
01:12:47,497 --> 01:12:49,286
This thing is becoming real.

963
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:52,864
It's going to affect lives,
thousands of lives.

964
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:55,073
We have to start to talk.

965
01:12:55,241 --> 01:12:57,958
All right. But not here.

966
01:12:58,601 --> 01:13:01,056
At my home tonight.

967
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:12,577
<i>So now we tickle
the tail of the dragon.</i>

968
01:13:12,778 --> 01:13:14,534
All right, take her up.

969
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:19,016
<i>I can only hope the uranium
slug doesn't get stuck in the pile.</i>

970
01:13:19,177 --> 01:13:22,244
<i>If it does,
we'll probably all evaporate.</i>

971
01:13:22,953 --> 01:13:25,288
- What's the reading?
- 1 .19-K.

972
01:13:27,626 --> 01:13:29,960
- Waiting on your word.
- Meter's ready.

973
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:31,398
Ready when you are.

974
01:13:33,802 --> 01:13:35,395
Let's go.

975
01:13:35,562 --> 01:13:36,904
OK, let's tickle it.

976
01:13:44,777 --> 01:13:46,566
It burst. It burst.

977
01:13:46,986 --> 01:13:48,873
It burst right from here.

978
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:51,617
All right, add it up.

979
01:13:51,786 --> 01:13:53,379
Cigarette break.

980
01:13:53,898 --> 01:13:55,425
Good job.

981
01:14:05,162 --> 01:14:07,748
Michael. Hey, Michael.
You got a moment?

982
01:14:07,914 --> 01:14:11,045
They won't let me in this place.
Still going to Chicago?

983
01:14:11,242 --> 01:14:13,217
Yeah, Frisch can't pick the slugs up.

984
01:14:13,418 --> 01:14:17,127
Great. There's something we'd
like you to pick up, if you can.

985
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:20,160
You know Leo Szilard, right?
And Ralph Lapp?

986
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,364
Well, about 20 of our other
colleagues from Chicago,

987
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:27,491
they're proposing a petition stating
they're opposed to the device.

988
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:31,878
They're concerned about
what they think's gonna happen.

989
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:37,028
So am I. I got a brother who's
in the Philippines right now.

990
01:14:37,194 --> 01:14:39,333
I read the papers. I'm concerned.

991
01:14:39,498 --> 01:14:43,240
I'm not asking you to endorse
anything. I haven't even read it yet.

992
01:14:43,883 --> 01:14:46,916
It should be discussed.
All I'm asking is pick it up,

993
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:50,497
let us peruse it and make up
our own minds. How tough is that?

994
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:52,739
- Makes sense.
- It's only fair.

995
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:54,335
I'll pick it up for you.

996
01:14:55,147 --> 01:14:57,034
- See you later.
- OK.

997
01:14:58,858 --> 01:15:01,247
How can you rationalize
premeditated murder?

998
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:03,720
Oh, bullshit. Premeditated murder?

999
01:15:03,883 --> 01:15:06,730
- This is a war. It's about winning.
- At what cost?

1000
01:15:06,890 --> 01:15:09,346
You can't just outlaw a weapon.

1001
01:15:09,514 --> 01:15:12,362
The more effective,
the more likely it will be used.

1002
01:15:12,523 --> 01:15:14,857
We didn't use poison gas.
That was stopped.

1003
01:15:15,051 --> 01:15:17,953
You got to speak up.
The generals won't listen to us.

1004
01:15:18,154 --> 01:15:22,410
Yeah, and speak up on behalf
of all those kids hiding in foxholes.

1005
01:15:22,571 --> 01:15:25,866
I know what they'd say. The
Japanese brought this on themselves.

1006
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:27,782
They have themselves to blame.

1007
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:30,597
I wouldn't care if the place
went up in smoke...

1008
01:15:30,763 --> 01:15:33,032
Excuse me,
just for a minute, gentlemen.

1009
01:15:34,666 --> 01:15:36,805
And I resent your suggesting

1010
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:38,913
I don't recognize a moral argument.

1011
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:42,378
Why are you still awake?
Aren't you supposed to be sleeping?

1012
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:46,500
- I don't like sleeping.
- There are lots of things we don't like.

1013
01:15:46,699 --> 01:15:50,593
We have to do them if we
want to do the things we do like.

1014
01:15:50,795 --> 01:15:53,697
- What's the treat tomorrow?
- Go horseback riding.

1015
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:57,860
That's right. Now, how are you
going to ride a great big horse

1016
01:15:58,027 --> 01:15:59,936
if you don't get plenty of rest?

1017
01:16:00,107 --> 01:16:01,733
Go to sleep for Daddy?

1018
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:04,041
That's a good boy.

1019
01:16:11,371 --> 01:16:13,259
It is hot.

1020
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:16,936
We could go to Carlucci's,
get some ice coffee and donuts.

1021
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,074
The project is beginning to unravel.

1022
01:16:19,276 --> 01:16:21,829
- What?
- There have always been questions.

1023
01:16:22,027 --> 01:16:25,802
We've always avoided the answers.
Now, everything is coming to a head.

1024
01:16:26,731 --> 01:16:28,357
- Bronson?
- Sir?

1025
01:16:28,524 --> 01:16:30,695
- Stop the car.
- Yes, sir.

1026
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:34,208
- Get out, take a leak or something.
- This is a public park.

1027
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,642
Well, pick some flowers.
I want to do some shouting.

1028
01:16:46,252 --> 01:16:47,528
It's a crisis.

1029
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:49,415
A crisis of conscience.

1030
01:16:51,308 --> 01:16:53,413
All right. I'm not shouting.

1031
01:16:54,188 --> 01:16:56,075
I'm not even angry.

1032
01:16:56,683 --> 01:16:58,887
I am just stumped.

1033
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:03,047
You want to sit on your hands,

1034
01:17:03,212 --> 01:17:04,772
polish your conscience,

1035
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:09,283
when we might be able to end
this whole thing with one shot?

1036
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,391
Crisis of conscience, huh?

1037
01:17:12,556 --> 01:17:13,985
All right.

1038
01:17:14,155 --> 01:17:15,366
Have it.

1039
01:17:15,532 --> 01:17:17,125
Take a bath in it.

1040
01:17:17,292 --> 01:17:18,502
Soak in it.

1041
01:17:19,596 --> 01:17:22,346
Then tell me whether you're
going to deliver them.

1042
01:17:22,539 --> 01:17:24,928
Whether you're gonna finish this job.

1043
01:17:25,132 --> 01:17:29,322
You tell me how I'm gonna face
a senate inquiry

1044
01:17:29,484 --> 01:17:33,739
and say we spent two billion dollars
on a show that's never gonna open.

1045
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,261
Crisis of conscience.

1046
01:17:36,428 --> 01:17:40,836
You got one job, doctor.
Give me the bomb. Just give it to me.

1047
01:17:41,229 --> 01:17:43,618
Atrocious things have been done
in Germany

1048
01:17:43,788 --> 01:17:46,210
because people didn't speak out.

1049
01:17:46,381 --> 01:17:50,374
And we blame them for it. Right,
I think, even though it was dangerous.

1050
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,191
But it's not dangerous
for us to speak out.

1051
01:17:53,357 --> 01:17:55,528
That's what a lot of us in Chicago feel.

1052
01:17:55,725 --> 01:17:59,020
You don't have to agree
with the contents of this petition.

1053
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:01,449
You have to agree
it should be discussed.

1054
01:18:01,612 --> 01:18:03,717
- Yes, sir.
- Good boy, Michael.

1055
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:06,693
Good seeing you again.

1056
01:18:35,852 --> 01:18:37,576
- It came in on the wire.
- What?

1057
01:18:37,741 --> 01:18:41,734
Japanese are feeling out terms for
surrender. They made a proposition.

1058
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:44,748
What kind of surrender?
Not unconditional?

1059
01:18:44,909 --> 01:18:46,763
Not according to my sources, no.

1060
01:18:46,924 --> 01:18:48,299
Good.

1061
01:18:48,461 --> 01:18:50,283
No one will buy it.

1062
01:18:50,764 --> 01:18:53,415
- Sir?
- Nothing.

1063
01:18:53,581 --> 01:18:56,615
Come on. Come on. Right here.

1064
01:18:58,637 --> 01:19:01,605
Mr. Secretary, a brutal question.

1065
01:19:02,157 --> 01:19:04,328
Are you and the president

1066
01:19:04,493 --> 01:19:05,802
looking to Russia,

1067
01:19:05,965 --> 01:19:09,381
figuring they'll come into Japan,
assuming there's an invasion?

1068
01:19:09,549 --> 01:19:12,299
If you are, you're not
gonna get that for nothing.

1069
01:19:12,461 --> 01:19:15,756
Russia's gonna want
Manchuria, Sakhalin.

1070
01:19:16,237 --> 01:19:18,692
I can give the president Japan.

1071
01:19:19,885 --> 01:19:21,740
No invasion, no deals.

1072
01:19:22,093 --> 01:19:23,402
Can you guarantee that?

1073
01:19:23,565 --> 01:19:26,216
Some of your scientists
are getting out of line.

1074
01:19:26,381 --> 01:19:29,250
I hear they've been maneuvering
to see the president.

1075
01:19:29,421 --> 01:19:30,763
I didn't know that.

1076
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:33,065
I will take care of it.

1077
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:36,938
- Very well. Do that, general.
- Mr. Secretary.

1078
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:38,792
Good night.

1079
01:19:41,805 --> 01:19:43,529
Panton?

1080
01:19:45,326 --> 01:19:46,733
Dr. Oppenheimer had...

1081
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:52,165
...on three separate occasions,
meetings with suspected agents,

1082
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:54,156
communists, whatever.

1083
01:19:54,318 --> 01:19:56,707
- He gave us one name, correct?
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:19:56,878 --> 01:19:58,983
Press him on the others.

1085
01:19:59,918 --> 01:20:02,918
- He needs to feel the branch creak.
- Yes, sir.

1086
01:20:03,117 --> 01:20:05,005
- Ready?
- Yeah, we're ready.

1087
01:20:09,933 --> 01:20:12,683
They told me you were down here.
I was having lunch.

1088
01:20:12,846 --> 01:20:15,912
I got a call from Captain Panton.
A security problem again.

1089
01:20:16,078 --> 01:20:18,827
Well, I'm being harassed,
and I'm sick of it.

1090
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:21,837
I had a security clearance.
This was a dead issue.

1091
01:20:21,998 --> 01:20:24,715
It's never dead with you.

1092
01:20:24,878 --> 01:20:28,555
Though I will try to put a lid on it.
This is not gonna help.

1093
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:31,656
- What's this?
- Some kind of petition

1094
01:20:31,822 --> 01:20:36,393
from your boys in Chicago trying to go
around us to see the president.

1095
01:20:36,846 --> 01:20:40,075
That will never happen.

1096
01:20:40,782 --> 01:20:43,051
Do you know about this?

1097
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:46,829
About the ideas, yes.

1098
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:50,089
They want to demonstrate
the device, not use it.

1099
01:20:50,254 --> 01:20:52,937
Is it containable?

1100
01:20:53,102 --> 01:20:55,207
Can you stop it?

1101
01:20:57,902 --> 01:21:00,936
My hash is getting cold upstairs.

1102
01:21:01,102 --> 01:21:03,721
- Don't let these dodos distract you.
- How can...?

1103
01:21:03,887 --> 01:21:08,676
Robert, you are this far away
from being the man who won the war.

1104
01:21:08,878 --> 01:21:10,766
These are important people
in Chicago.

1105
01:21:10,959 --> 01:21:13,609
You can't ignore
what they have to say.

1106
01:21:13,774 --> 01:21:17,735
All they want is an opportunity
to talk about the demonstration.

1107
01:21:17,902 --> 01:21:21,317
- What's his name? Szilard.
- Szilard.

1108
01:21:21,486 --> 01:21:23,177
Sitting in the bathtub.

1109
01:21:23,343 --> 01:21:27,237
I should have drowned that
son of a bitch the first day I met him.

1110
01:21:28,462 --> 01:21:31,659
What's wrong with demonstrating?
What's wrong with not killing?

1111
01:21:31,823 --> 01:21:33,710
You vaporize some uninhabited atoll.

1112
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:36,488
Set terms of surrender,
then send the Japanese home.

1113
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:39,780
It's mush. It won't work.

1114
01:21:39,982 --> 01:21:42,950
They are kamikazes, all of them.

1115
01:21:45,486 --> 01:21:48,072
You had money in your background.
That explains it.

1116
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,246
- What does that mean?
- Your optimism.

1117
01:21:50,415 --> 01:21:54,408
Faith in human nature.
I never had any. Money, that is.

1118
01:21:54,574 --> 01:21:58,152
Never had a permanent house.
Made me a realist.

1119
01:22:01,071 --> 01:22:03,242
The idea should go to the president.

1120
01:22:04,943 --> 01:22:07,725
Where do you get these ideas?

1121
01:22:07,887 --> 01:22:10,276
You know, those boys in security...

1122
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:13,327
...got a right to ask where
these ideas are coming from.

1123
01:22:13,999 --> 01:22:19,695
Demonstrations, stopping work,
sharing with other countries.

1124
01:22:20,271 --> 01:22:22,442
You're gonna have
a tough time proving

1125
01:22:22,607 --> 01:22:25,455
that those ideas
are coming out of Chicago.

1126
01:22:25,615 --> 01:22:28,004
- They are foreign, subversive.
- They're moral.

1127
01:22:28,175 --> 01:22:30,411
- Moral?
- Moral.

1128
01:22:30,575 --> 01:22:33,030
Was Pearl Harbor moral?

1129
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,141
Poland, Munich, moral?

1130
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:39,748
Death March of Bataan,
was that moral?

1131
01:22:39,919 --> 01:22:41,129
Junk!

1132
01:22:42,127 --> 01:22:44,680
Demonstration junk.

1133
01:22:44,879 --> 01:22:47,978
I say you show the enemy
in the harshest terms

1134
01:22:48,143 --> 01:22:52,878
that you can muster, that you play
in the same league that they do.

1135
01:22:53,743 --> 01:22:58,500
At that meeting tomorrow there's
gonna be a vote on this demonstration.

1136
01:22:58,671 --> 01:23:01,770
There's gonna be a recommendation
going to the president.

1137
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:03,397
Now, listen.

1138
01:23:04,111 --> 01:23:06,926
You can help yourself here.

1139
01:23:07,951 --> 01:23:10,569
Steer it in the right direction.

1140
01:23:11,631 --> 01:23:15,079
You're either for us or against us.
Ernest, how are you?

1141
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:18,628
I'd like to introduce
Dr. Oppenheimer here.

1142
01:23:18,832 --> 01:23:22,061
Well, rumor has it
that we might owe you

1143
01:23:22,224 --> 01:23:24,777
for shaking those yellow monkeys
out of the trees.

1144
01:23:24,944 --> 01:23:28,293
Save us a lot, not going to Japan.
My boys are gonna be grateful.

1145
01:23:28,463 --> 01:23:32,326
Yes, I'm pleased to shake
your hand. And thank you.

1146
01:23:32,495 --> 01:23:35,212
Doctor, I'd like to add my shake too.

1147
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:37,415
Nice seeing you.

1148
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:44,073
Did you hear what they said?

1149
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:48,997
You keep this on the track,
and we are gonna owe you, soldier.

1150
01:24:31,153 --> 01:24:35,463
<i>''We are in a completely new situation
that cannot be resolved by war.</i>

1151
01:24:36,592 --> 01:24:39,407
<i>''A petition to the president
of the United States.</i>

1152
01:24:39,568 --> 01:24:41,903
<i>''Discoveries of which the people
are not aware</i>

1153
01:24:42,065 --> 01:24:45,131
<i>''may affect the welfare
of this nation in the near future.''</i>

1154
01:24:45,585 --> 01:24:49,163
The Russians are our allies.
If we drop this without telling them,

1155
01:24:49,329 --> 01:24:52,144
we could give them a paranoia
that will make us sick.

1156
01:24:52,305 --> 01:24:56,680
The Japanese are on their knees.
All this kamikaze stuff is a load of bull.

1157
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,517
They're wet-pants scared of us just
like we're wet-pants scared of them.

1158
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,942
This war seems to have forced
a lot of guys on both sides

1159
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:07,593
to resign from the human race.

1160
01:25:07,761 --> 01:25:11,056
- I hope we're not about to do that.
- I agree.

1161
01:25:11,536 --> 01:25:16,293
Our blockade will finish Japan
by autumn, maybe even sooner.

1162
01:25:16,465 --> 01:25:19,913
This device is not an honorable way
to win a war.

1163
01:25:20,049 --> 01:25:22,286
And I was taught to fight with honor.

1164
01:25:22,481 --> 01:25:24,456
If Custer...

1165
01:25:24,657 --> 01:25:26,959
...had used the machine-gun...

1166
01:25:27,121 --> 01:25:30,252
...his history would have been
written differently.

1167
01:25:31,953 --> 01:25:34,157
If you go ahead,

1168
01:25:34,321 --> 01:25:39,143
particularly, if you drop this thing
with no prior warning...

1169
01:25:39,313 --> 01:25:43,110
...l, for one, will have to
resign my commission.

1170
01:25:46,097 --> 01:25:48,814
Perhaps you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

1171
01:25:54,833 --> 01:26:00,976
Incidentally, what is the opinion of
the committee on a demonstration?

1172
01:26:03,762 --> 01:26:06,412
Well, if we should agree
to a demonstration

1173
01:26:06,577 --> 01:26:08,487
with the attendant
Japanese observers

1174
01:26:08,658 --> 01:26:12,138
and that demonstration failed,

1175
01:26:12,306 --> 01:26:15,851
not only would we be unable
to induce the Japanese to surrender,

1176
01:26:16,017 --> 01:26:19,214
we would face a critical
shortage of material.

1177
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:25,388
The dropping of the device
has always been implicit in this project.

1178
01:26:26,354 --> 01:26:30,380
So that is the advice I shall
pass on to the president.

1179
01:26:30,578 --> 01:26:32,847
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, that's right.

1180
01:26:33,010 --> 01:26:34,798
Yes.

1181
01:27:14,546 --> 01:27:16,718
- Sam.
- Bob, welcome to Trinity.

1182
01:27:16,883 --> 01:27:18,639
- Here she is.
- Can I grab one?

1183
01:27:18,803 --> 01:27:20,745
- It's all right.
- Good trip?

1184
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:26,127
- Are you the accountable officer?
- Yes.

1185
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:28,199
- This will be for you.
- What's that?

1186
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:31,152
It states that the University
of California hands over

1187
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:34,608
a plutonium core of a nuclear device
to the United States Army.

1188
01:27:34,771 --> 01:27:39,026
Put more simply,
it's a bill for two billion dollars.

1189
01:27:41,235 --> 01:27:44,050
Now, let me show you
what else your money's bought.

1190
01:27:45,971 --> 01:27:47,978
The initiator.

1191
01:27:50,771 --> 01:27:53,072
And the other half.

1192
01:27:54,419 --> 01:27:58,096
Now, all we gotta do
is throw them together and...

1193
01:28:01,202 --> 01:28:04,072
Well, let's begin final assembly.

1194
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:10,897
OK, Mr. Merriman.

1195
01:28:22,578 --> 01:28:24,782
Well, you're quiet.

1196
01:28:27,251 --> 01:28:30,447
It's coming close, what you're
working towards, isn't it?

1197
01:28:30,611 --> 01:28:32,683
Yeah.

1198
01:28:32,851 --> 01:28:36,331
I can feel it pressing down
on everybody.

1199
01:28:36,531 --> 01:28:39,248
There's something going on here.

1200
01:28:40,883 --> 01:28:44,396
It's got everybody mesmerized,
doesn't it?

1201
01:28:44,563 --> 01:28:46,505
Yeah.

1202
01:28:46,675 --> 01:28:50,220
There's a regular run
on sleeping pills and aspirin.

1203
01:28:50,387 --> 01:28:53,802
And it's not just the work,
it's something else.

1204
01:28:57,011 --> 01:29:01,070
- Look, I know you can't talk about it.
- I can't.

1205
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:04,235
Well, then talk to Dr. Oppenheimer.

1206
01:29:04,404 --> 01:29:07,633
I mean, if anyone has,
he'll have thought it through, right?

1207
01:29:08,883 --> 01:29:10,476
OK.

1208
01:29:16,563 --> 01:29:18,702
Touch me.

1209
01:29:34,131 --> 01:29:36,204
Naked.

1210
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:38,793
Isn't that a beautiful word?

1211
01:29:41,555 --> 01:29:43,922
Tonight.

1212
01:29:44,116 --> 01:29:46,538
I want to make love.

1213
01:29:49,396 --> 01:29:51,632
And I want a future.

1214
01:29:51,796 --> 01:29:54,316
That's what I really want...

1215
01:29:54,483 --> 01:29:56,687
...for you and me.

1216
01:29:56,852 --> 01:29:59,089
So do I.

1217
01:30:01,428 --> 01:30:06,130
- Oh, for chrissake, George.
- This pitting, must be the mold.

1218
01:30:06,292 --> 01:30:08,747
I'm not an explosives expert,
but I've been called

1219
01:30:08,916 --> 01:30:10,989
to look at something
that's unacceptable.

1220
01:30:11,188 --> 01:30:12,497
We must use hand lathings.

1221
01:30:12,692 --> 01:30:14,928
You should have used hand
lathings before.

1222
01:30:15,092 --> 01:30:17,481
- Hand lathings, you know what it is?
- Yes.

1223
01:30:18,324 --> 01:30:22,285
- Michael, what are you doing here?
- Chicago, Leo Szilard.

1224
01:30:22,452 --> 01:30:25,005
I read it on the train.

1225
01:30:25,172 --> 01:30:28,816
- Well, what do you think about it?
- It unnerved me.

1226
01:30:30,292 --> 01:30:32,627
Are we gonna discuss this ever?

1227
01:30:32,788 --> 01:30:34,860
Amongst ourselves?

1228
01:30:35,605 --> 01:30:39,499
- Are we going on?
- I don't see anyone stopping.

1229
01:30:39,668 --> 01:30:42,734
Now, look, we've been asked
to solve a technical problem,

1230
01:30:42,933 --> 01:30:46,348
to build this device.
We're not responsible for its use.

1231
01:30:46,548 --> 01:30:49,745
Oppie, it's for you.

1232
01:30:49,908 --> 01:30:52,777
Peter's got revised figures.

1233
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:02,930
Look, let me keep this paper.

1234
01:31:03,093 --> 01:31:06,890
We're expecting the initiator.
We need your lab results, all right?

1235
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,653
All right?

1236
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,675
All right.

1237
01:31:29,845 --> 01:31:31,535
Everybody ready?

1238
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,456
- Meter's ready.
- Here we go.

1239
01:31:52,789 --> 01:31:54,764
Twenty-one.

1240
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:03,155
Twenty-nine.

1241
01:32:12,597 --> 01:32:14,702
Thirty-one.

1242
01:32:17,045 --> 01:32:18,769
Thirty-eight.

1243
01:32:19,861 --> 01:32:23,789
Got it? Forty.
Everybody back, right now.

1244
01:32:29,813 --> 01:32:31,340
Behind the wall.

1245
01:32:42,518 --> 01:32:44,111
Turn it off!

1246
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:53,525
Nobody move! Don't anybody move!

1247
01:32:57,301 --> 01:32:59,603
Damn it!

1248
01:32:59,765 --> 01:33:01,740
Take off everything metal. Drop it.

1249
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:04,812
Mark the positions
you're standing in and get out.

1250
01:33:08,405 --> 01:33:09,867
The incident never happened.

1251
01:33:10,038 --> 01:33:12,907
If anyone should ask,
it did not happen.

1252
01:33:33,366 --> 01:33:35,635
Everybody should make it.

1253
01:33:37,462 --> 01:33:39,949
Except me.

1254
01:33:40,118 --> 01:33:42,006
I'm dead.

1255
01:34:02,902 --> 01:34:05,586
Doctor! Doctor!
I've been looking all over for you.

1256
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:08,205
We've got a problem.

1257
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:09,585
- Bad allergy.
- When?

1258
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:12,084
- An hour ago. They're bringing him in.
- Who?

1259
01:34:12,246 --> 01:34:13,457
Mr. Merriman.

1260
01:34:13,623 --> 01:34:15,248
- Michael?
- Yes, sir.

1261
01:34:15,414 --> 01:34:17,302
Oh, shit.

1262
01:34:17,463 --> 01:34:19,568
Let's go.

1263
01:34:19,735 --> 01:34:22,517
- Come on, let's go!
- Yes, sir.

1264
01:34:29,175 --> 01:34:30,931
This one won't do.

1265
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:37,329
- In here. This one's good.
- Take it easy. All right, all right.

1266
01:34:37,494 --> 01:34:40,790
- Michael, what's the matter?
- Nothing, everything's fine.

1267
01:34:41,559 --> 01:34:44,374
- Doctor, how much did he get?
- More than 1 ,000 rads.

1268
01:34:44,535 --> 01:34:46,258
- Goddamn it.
- What's happening?

1269
01:34:46,422 --> 01:34:49,837
Sweetheart, it's under control.
Everything's under control, OK?

1270
01:34:50,839 --> 01:34:53,522
- Steven, what's going on?
- You should not be here.

1271
01:34:53,687 --> 01:34:55,476
Excuse me, there's no patient here.

1272
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:58,324
No one's to hear about this.
Not Oppenheimer. Nobody.

1273
01:34:58,519 --> 01:35:01,814
- OK?
- Goddamn it, what happened here?

1274
01:35:02,007 --> 01:35:04,146
I want this ward sealed off.
Come with me.

1275
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:06,961
I want military doctors in here.

1276
01:35:16,503 --> 01:35:18,478
Get the hell out of here!

1277
01:35:22,839 --> 01:35:24,334
It's the detonation circuits.

1278
01:35:26,455 --> 01:35:30,197
I don't know.
I would like another 24 hours.

1279
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:33,238
I think so, but I can't be certain.

1280
01:35:33,431 --> 01:35:38,614
I said one more day.
I need one more day.

1281
01:35:39,768 --> 01:35:44,274
No, no, Merriman brought me
a copy from Chicago.

1282
01:35:45,111 --> 01:35:47,021
Some of the physicists
have signed it.

1283
01:35:47,192 --> 01:35:50,934
Pinko fruitcakes. Get that thing
to work, I'm gonna drop it on Chicago.

1284
01:35:51,096 --> 01:35:53,517
I swear I will.

1285
01:35:53,687 --> 01:35:58,576
Yes, I hear you. You hear me?
Finish the damn thing. That's an order.

1286
01:36:00,311 --> 01:36:03,759
Well, I got other business.

1287
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,415
But I got a plane. I'll be there.

1288
01:36:06,615 --> 01:36:09,103
Every time I turn around,
somebody gets to him.

1289
01:36:09,303 --> 01:36:12,151
Now they're talking about postponing.

1290
01:36:16,823 --> 01:36:20,468
- Cleared for Washington?
- Yes, sir. We are.

1291
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:27,958
''Truman, Stimson arrive Potsdam
for conference with Stalin.

1292
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:30,291
''Advise results of Trinity Test soonest.''

1293
01:36:30,456 --> 01:36:32,911
Stalin's gonna eat Truman alive
at this meeting.

1294
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:35,568
- Unless we...
- Yes, unless...

1295
01:36:35,767 --> 01:36:39,183
...we give the president something
lethal to stick in his back pocket.

1296
01:36:39,384 --> 01:36:43,410
I'll tell you something
it won't be...postponement.

1297
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:53,808
Oh, Lord...so close.

1298
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,160
Sir.

1299
01:37:41,048 --> 01:37:44,823
Keep going down slow.

1300
01:37:48,089 --> 01:37:51,220
His heart looks larger. Could be
fluid in the pericardial sac.

1301
01:37:51,385 --> 01:37:53,010
- Radiation induced?
- Probably.

1302
01:37:53,176 --> 01:37:55,380
It's almost doubled in size overnight.

1303
01:37:55,544 --> 01:37:57,933
If this continues, his heart will drown.

1304
01:37:58,105 --> 01:38:00,374
- Is he lucid?
- In and out.

1305
01:38:00,537 --> 01:38:04,083
There's tremendous brain swelling
from the radiation.

1306
01:38:04,249 --> 01:38:08,624
- What happens next?
- I don't know. I mean, I have no idea.

1307
01:38:08,793 --> 01:38:12,022
No human being's ever gotten
this dose of radiation before.

1308
01:38:12,217 --> 01:38:13,908
He's dying from the inside out.

1309
01:38:14,105 --> 01:38:18,447
Other problems. His gastrointestinal
tract has been destroyed by radiation.

1310
01:38:18,649 --> 01:38:20,820
Excuse me, doctors.

1311
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:29,200
You've got to believe
we're doing everything we know how.

1312
01:38:29,369 --> 01:38:30,743
Absolutely everything.

1313
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:34,418
It's not gonna do any good
to have you ripping yourself apart.

1314
01:38:34,585 --> 01:38:38,098
- You've gotta go home and sleep.
- Richard, I can't.

1315
01:39:34,778 --> 01:39:36,120
- Some orange.
- Sure is.

1316
01:39:36,282 --> 01:39:37,689
Hey, Oppie?

1317
01:39:51,066 --> 01:39:52,473
Look out!

1318
01:39:54,682 --> 01:39:56,275
Hornig?

1319
01:39:56,442 --> 01:39:58,613
- Hornig?
- It's all right.

1320
01:39:58,778 --> 01:40:00,633
The other safety's holding.

1321
01:40:03,354 --> 01:40:06,104
Does anybody else need a martini?

1322
01:40:08,858 --> 01:40:11,476
- What's the word?
- Oppie, it doesn't look good.

1323
01:40:11,642 --> 01:40:16,399
We have a chance of thunderstorms
over the next five days. I'm sorry.

1324
01:40:17,914 --> 01:40:20,664
I'm not telling you
what this guy's got up there.

1325
01:40:40,186 --> 01:40:42,041
- Why wasn't I told?
- Too much panic.

1326
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:44,112
- How is he?
- Difficult to tell.

1327
01:40:44,283 --> 01:40:46,649
- I'd like to see him.
- We're not permitting visits.

1328
01:40:46,811 --> 01:40:49,331
But the men who were
with him have been spoken to.

1329
01:40:49,499 --> 01:40:51,670
Security. Delicate time.

1330
01:40:51,867 --> 01:40:54,867
He's a strong young man.
He'll pull through.

1331
01:40:56,059 --> 01:40:58,295
Schoenfield, how is he?

1332
01:40:58,458 --> 01:41:01,393
- Is he conscious?
- He's in and out.

1333
01:41:01,563 --> 01:41:03,864
He wants to know
if you read the petition.

1334
01:41:04,027 --> 01:41:07,889
- It means a lot to him.
- Yes, I have.

1335
01:41:08,058 --> 01:41:10,928
And then, that's it? That's all?

1336
01:41:11,099 --> 01:41:13,848
Yes, I have and then now
I wash my hands of it?

1337
01:41:14,011 --> 01:41:15,604
Now wait a minute, Oppenheimer.

1338
01:41:15,771 --> 01:41:18,618
I got a friend falling apart
who thinks you got the answers.

1339
01:41:18,779 --> 01:41:20,339
That's what you let him think.

1340
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:24,500
Do you know what the Christ is going
on, or is the whole thing out of control?

1341
01:41:24,699 --> 01:41:27,001
If you're trying to make a point,
what is it?

1342
01:41:27,163 --> 01:41:30,032
I have spent the last
two years of my life

1343
01:41:30,234 --> 01:41:34,544
putting up with all your security
and your secrecy and your control.

1344
01:41:34,715 --> 01:41:37,585
I don't think that bullshit
was to keep what was going on

1345
01:41:37,755 --> 01:41:40,406
from the Germans
or the Japanese or the Russians.

1346
01:41:40,571 --> 01:41:42,873
It's to keep it from
American Jacks and Jills

1347
01:41:43,035 --> 01:41:45,174
because they may not
like what's going on.

1348
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:48,122
American people don't
want to know what's going on.

1349
01:41:48,283 --> 01:41:50,585
They want to know
that their sons are alive.

1350
01:41:50,747 --> 01:41:53,464
I'm doing everything in my power
to see that they do.

1351
01:41:53,883 --> 01:41:56,403
Like Oak Ridge, where they're
injecting ill and old

1352
01:41:56,604 --> 01:41:58,840
people with huge doses of plutonium?

1353
01:41:59,003 --> 01:42:01,621
I don't know about Oak Ridge,
but if you want to ask

1354
01:42:01,787 --> 01:42:04,635
what's happening, ask this:
Will it be big enough?

1355
01:42:05,147 --> 01:42:08,311
Big enough to scare all of us
and make us stop and think?

1356
01:42:08,476 --> 01:42:12,338
Big enough to stop all war forever?
You want to ask a question, ask that.

1357
01:42:12,508 --> 01:42:15,671
Look, I've seen Oak Ridge, all right?

1358
01:42:15,835 --> 01:42:18,738
That place wasn't built
to make one or two bombs.

1359
01:42:18,907 --> 01:42:22,136
It was built to make
thousands of them. Thousands.

1360
01:42:22,299 --> 01:42:24,918
And soon everybody's
gonna have a bomb. They will.

1361
01:42:25,084 --> 01:42:28,695
What do they do with them?
Sit and wait till they go off, until ''boom''?

1362
01:42:28,892 --> 01:42:31,380
Then we got one world
full of Michael Merrimans

1363
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:34,808
dying from the inside out.
Is that what you're looking for?

1364
01:42:34,971 --> 01:42:38,419
Because that's the future
you've made for us.

1365
01:42:39,196 --> 01:42:43,189
Hey, Oppenheimer! Oppenheimer,
you ought to stop playing God

1366
01:42:43,355 --> 01:42:47,633
because you are not good at it
and the position is taken.

1367
01:42:58,588 --> 01:43:02,679
His pressure's falling fast.
You've got to get that fluid out now.

1368
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:08,954
Needle, Michael.

1369
01:43:09,884 --> 01:43:12,666
OK, you're in. Start to pull it back.

1370
01:43:12,828 --> 01:43:14,715
Hang in, Michael.

1371
01:43:16,732 --> 01:43:18,554
Hang in, pal.

1372
01:43:19,772 --> 01:43:21,911
Come on, doc.

1373
01:43:23,356 --> 01:43:26,652
Pressure's starting to rise.
It's coming up slowly.

1374
01:43:45,789 --> 01:43:49,651
- Robert, you have to get some sleep.
- God.

1375
01:43:49,821 --> 01:43:52,308
I'm in a dark place.

1376
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:56,186
We've all cooked this stew.

1377
01:43:56,349 --> 01:44:02,994
The Germans and the Japanese
and the Americans and the Brits.

1378
01:44:03,804 --> 01:44:07,285
It's an ugliness that goes back.
It goes way back.

1379
01:44:08,028 --> 01:44:10,876
I'm not a scientist anymore.

1380
01:44:11,772 --> 01:44:15,667
I'm a goddamn functionary.

1381
01:44:16,861 --> 01:44:19,643
I've got to stay in control.

1382
01:44:19,804 --> 01:44:22,586
I've got to control who gets this thing.

1383
01:44:23,453 --> 01:44:27,446
Power and control,
it's all I ever hear about anymore.

1384
01:44:28,444 --> 01:44:30,900
Doesn't life matter to you?

1385
01:44:31,005 --> 01:44:33,394
What about love and understanding?

1386
01:44:33,596 --> 01:44:36,945
I thought that's what science
was all about.

1387
01:44:37,149 --> 01:44:39,996
I just wanted us to work.

1388
01:44:40,189 --> 01:44:44,924
Does everything have to be
sacrificed to this...thing?

1389
01:44:47,005 --> 01:44:49,426
I put up with...

1390
01:44:52,637 --> 01:44:54,939
...Jean,

1391
01:44:55,101 --> 01:44:58,167
because I thought you needed her.

1392
01:45:00,125 --> 01:45:02,492
And I thought you'd give
her up because of me.

1393
01:45:04,157 --> 01:45:06,874
But she didn't count.

1394
01:45:07,069 --> 01:45:13,627
I don't count. Nothing counts for you
anymore except this damn bomb.

1395
01:45:14,269 --> 01:45:16,636
That's what it is.

1396
01:45:16,797 --> 01:45:19,961
But it's not your only creation.

1397
01:45:20,126 --> 01:45:22,646
There are the children.

1398
01:45:24,029 --> 01:45:28,699
And you need my love and support.
I know.

1399
01:45:29,566 --> 01:45:31,573
I don't...

1400
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:34,589
I don't know where it is.

1401
01:45:34,878 --> 01:45:37,082
Why me?

1402
01:45:39,389 --> 01:45:41,778
Why did he pick me?

1403
01:46:03,934 --> 01:46:05,876
- Panton!
- Sir?

1404
01:46:06,046 --> 01:46:09,592
Security's a mess. Nobody at
the checkpoint. Nobody up here.

1405
01:46:09,790 --> 01:46:12,474
- What do you think this is, a beach?
- No, sir.

1406
01:46:12,670 --> 01:46:15,485
We've got to call a halt.
The weather is unpredictable.

1407
01:46:15,646 --> 01:46:18,035
We are not calling a halt
on account of weather.

1408
01:46:18,237 --> 01:46:21,783
With the wind we could send
radioactive junk all the way to Amarillo.

1409
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:25,562
<i>You The New York Times reporter?
I want three reports.</i>

1410
01:46:25,726 --> 01:46:28,857
One if we succeed, one if we fail
and one if we disintegrate.

1411
01:46:29,022 --> 01:46:32,666
With the wind blowing this direction,
Amarillo could get a fallout.

1412
01:46:32,830 --> 01:46:35,219
- Fermi's right.
- No, I'm saying no.

1413
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:38,554
The decision is mine!

1414
01:46:38,718 --> 01:46:40,627
- Do you understand?
- We can't do it.

1415
01:46:40,798 --> 01:46:43,962
We go ahead with this. Sergeant,
do something about that dog.

1416
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:46,646
You sound like you're planning
a railway schedule.

1417
01:46:46,846 --> 01:46:50,326
No, you are trying to uninvent this.

1418
01:46:50,623 --> 01:46:51,997
I can do it without you.

1419
01:46:52,158 --> 01:46:57,560
Well, if you do and I've said no
and something goes wrong...

1420
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:00,824
Get in the car.

1421
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:03,227
Hurry up.
What are you waiting on?

1422
01:47:27,614 --> 01:47:31,389
Sir, it looks like it's clearing up.

1423
01:47:50,975 --> 01:47:55,198
You know, you build to a moment,

1424
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:58,872
and then you grab it,
or it will go right by you.

1425
01:48:00,350 --> 01:48:03,612
You always thought that
I would do this, didn't you?

1426
01:48:03,775 --> 01:48:06,263
Can you buck your own nature?

1427
01:48:08,575 --> 01:48:10,964
What will it be like?

1428
01:48:13,151 --> 01:48:15,518
Unimaginable.

1429
01:48:17,823 --> 01:48:20,027
It's your baby.

1430
01:48:30,175 --> 01:48:32,346
Do it.

1431
01:48:34,079 --> 01:48:35,640
Hallelujah.

1432
01:48:35,999 --> 01:48:38,650
He said it's a go.

1433
01:48:38,815 --> 01:48:40,725
Let's go.

1434
01:48:41,151 --> 01:48:44,567
Start the countdown.
Come on. It's a go.

1435
01:48:44,735 --> 01:48:48,084
- Let's go! Move it out!
- Wilson, wake up!

1436
01:48:48,255 --> 01:48:52,150
- Wake up the dragon.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1437
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:08,857
Power on.

1438
01:49:09,312 --> 01:49:12,476
- Power on.
- Synchronization relays one open.

1439
01:49:12,863 --> 01:49:14,652
Synchronization relay one open.

1440
01:49:14,816 --> 01:49:20,086
- Synchronization relays two open.
- Synchronization relays two open.

1441
01:49:36,064 --> 01:49:38,519
I love you, Michael.

1442
01:49:45,345 --> 01:49:47,417
Easy.

1443
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:51,165
Breathe easy.

1444
01:50:07,425 --> 01:50:09,661
Easy.

1445
01:50:10,624 --> 01:50:13,013
Easy, come back to the ice.

1446
01:50:15,745 --> 01:50:18,679
It's OK, here's the ice.

1447
01:50:24,641 --> 01:50:27,837
Kathleen, what are you doing in here?

1448
01:50:28,033 --> 01:50:30,586
Kathleen? God!

1449
01:50:30,784 --> 01:50:33,119
Come on, come on, sweetheart.

1450
01:50:34,593 --> 01:50:38,335
- You simply can't be here, sweetheart.
- I had to be with him.

1451
01:50:38,497 --> 01:50:42,687
I wanted to tell him I love him,
because he's going to die.

1452
01:50:48,225 --> 01:50:49,818
Detonation relays four open.

1453
01:50:53,185 --> 01:50:55,868
Well, it's armed.

1454
01:50:56,032 --> 01:50:59,677
- Now it's up to the bunker.
- Let's get down from here.

1455
01:51:06,721 --> 01:51:13,529
Well, I've always believed
that the Lord was on our side.

1456
01:51:13,697 --> 01:51:16,283
And I think now we're gonna prove it.

1457
01:51:54,753 --> 01:51:58,615
- Must be from the military base.
- Enrico, what do you bet on the yield?

1458
01:51:58,786 --> 01:52:01,055
I bet we set fire to the atmosphere.

1459
01:52:01,217 --> 01:52:03,486
If we're lucky,
we only wipe out New Mexico.

1460
01:52:03,682 --> 01:52:08,897
If we can ignite the air,
we finish off the planet. Any takers?

1461
01:52:09,282 --> 01:52:12,129
I kind of hope the damn thing
doesn't go off.

1462
01:52:13,345 --> 01:52:15,003
What the hell is that?

1463
01:52:15,458 --> 01:52:18,305
<i>It's The Nutcracker Suite.</i>

1464
01:52:19,138 --> 01:52:20,927
I can't get rid of it.

1465
01:52:21,570 --> 01:52:23,872
- Go to six-five.
- Six-five.

1466
01:52:24,865 --> 01:52:27,321
- OK, try seven.
- Seven.

1467
01:52:27,938 --> 01:52:29,913
Charging the device.

1468
01:52:38,434 --> 01:52:40,703
Robert, over here.

1469
01:52:46,306 --> 01:52:48,826
The device is fully charged.

1470
01:52:49,313 --> 01:52:53,088
It is now zero minus 60 seconds.
Fifty-nine, 58,

1471
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:55,006
57, 56,

1472
01:52:55,170 --> 01:52:56,926
55, 54,

1473
01:52:57,090 --> 01:53:03,201
- 53, 52, 51 , 50, 49...
- Where is that music coming from?

1474
01:53:03,362 --> 01:53:06,144
It's a ground channel.
I can't get rid of it.

1475
01:53:06,339 --> 01:53:11,128
44, 43, 42, 41 , 40...

1476
01:53:11,330 --> 01:53:13,534
Goddamn music.

1477
01:53:13,698 --> 01:53:21,151
37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31 , 30,

nine, eight, seven, six, five,

1484

four, three, two, one, zero.

1485
01:56:16,548 --> 01:56:20,290
<i>Kathleen, my love.
You asked me a question once.</i>

1486
01:56:20,452 --> 01:56:23,300
<i>Was it instinct to save a life
or to take it?</i>

1487
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:25,347
<i>Well, I don't know, my darling.</i>

1488
01:56:25,572 --> 01:56:29,466
<i>All I do know is that
if we are free to choose,</i>

1489
01:56:29,636 --> 01:56:32,418
<i>I hope to God
we choose life over death.</i>

1490
01:56:33,124 --> 01:56:36,769
<i>Not because I believe the implacable
universe cares a damn,</i>

1491
01:56:37,092 --> 01:56:40,027
<i>but because as I look at you,
my darling,</i>

1492
01:56:40,196 --> 01:56:42,335
<i>I realize how glorious,</i>

1493
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:45,151
<i>how magical life can be.</i>
