1
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,654
At ease.

2
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,330
Move it, move it, move it!

3
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,268
One, two, three.

4
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,008
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

5
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:03,713
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny! Hoorah!</i>

6
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,155
Boy, those Japs better watch out
for you, sir. Good luck.

7
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,727
The Corps of Engineers
is gonna miss you, sir.

8
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,592
- Thank you, gentlemen. Bronson.
- Sir.

9
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:16,060
I built this place,
so I'll be glad to eat it.

10
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,507
Well done, sir.

11
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,239
You're a lucky man.
Give those Japs hell.

12
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,310
Thank you, Thomas.

13
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,811
Indeed, I will.

14
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,815
Sir!

15
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,980
I'm losing my chance
to get out from behind a desk

16
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,117
- and lead men in combat!
- Colonel Groves, forget it. This has...

17
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,661
Even Bronson
wants to head for the front.

18
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,265
Forget about the front.
You're an engineer.

19
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,231
You're gonna fight your war here.

20
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:55,136
Is this what you're assigning me to,
this boondoggle? Dead end?

21
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,072
This dead end, Groves, has the
personal backing of the president.

22
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:02,180
This is not what I was promised,
not what I expected.

23
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,875
Then bone up on it.
Head to Chicago, talk to the scientist.

24
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,111
If it looks possible, run with it.

25
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:12,554
Take whoever you want. Have
whatever you need. Just make it work.

26
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,751
Who knows, you might just win
this war on your own.

27
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,557
Pick up a star on the way.

28
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,031
<i>...fighting for, and they are reported
to be giving the Germans hell.</i>

29
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:59,331
<i>Though these losses represent the
most serious setbacks for the Allies</i>

30
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,507
<i>in this war
against the Nazi enemy.</i>

31
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,838
<i>Bad news, too,
from the war in the Pacific.</i>

32
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:10,005
<i>We have just had confirmation of
the sinking of three US cruisers.</i>

33
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,016
<i>Names are being withheld.
The casualties are high.</i>

34
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,676
Come in!

35
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:19,257
<i>Reports of an early-morning raid
by Japanese dive-bombers...</i>

36
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,021
In here.
In here!

37
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,029
- Szard?
- Szilard.

38
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,965
General Groves, I was expecting you.
Come in! Come in!

39
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:44,012
Forgive me.
Sometimes I get stuck in here.

40
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,208
Metaphorically.

41
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,217
I've read this.

42
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,653
- Is it possible?
- You couldn't put a little more hot in,

43
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,485
could you?

44
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,899
And I'm not very good at fairy tales,
so just give me the happy ending.

45
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:13,109
What I wrote is possible,
probably inevitable.

46
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,414
Separate uranium 235,
then arrange for two portions

47
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:23,078
of the element to be brought together
suddenly, so that the resulting mass,

48
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,349
no bigger than this, general,

49
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:29,291
undergoes a spontaneous
self-generating reaction.

50
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:34,161
And if this was the epicenter
of that explosion...

51
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:39,970
...all of Chicago you could see
from here would disintegrate.

52
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,474
Hallelujah.

53
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:47,578
At the moment, all we have
are theories, concepts, inspirations,

54
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,183
- inconclusive results...
- Now, if we can make this device,

55
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,444
- so can the Krauts.
- Yes.

56
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,019
Germany has the scientific capability.

57
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,818
And, general,
we need leadership here.

58
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,516
- I can help!
- Thank you.

59
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,594
You need an ally, general!

60
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,836
- So tell us about this general.
- Why?

61
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,665
Because it's so mysterious.

62
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,242
''Meet me in the middle
of God-knows-where.

63
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:24,873
''Be there no earlier than 4:20,
no later than 4:29.''

64
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,042
Well, word has it

65
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,120
he's a provincial windbag

66
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,849
who's spent most of his life
digging holes in Latin America.

67
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,856
- Graves for the natives, no doubt.
- Oh, Frank.

68
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,861
Seriously, Kitty, after all,
Robert's a scientist.

69
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,159
If the Army wants him,
they'll want all of him.

70
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,099
All of him?
Why not take all of him?

71
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,273
Look, I have to at least hear
what he has to offer.

72
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,410
- Robert, must we go so fast?
- Yes!

73
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:55,511
- It's crazy.
- Yes! Yes!

74
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,822
This way, Dr. Oppenheimer.

75
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,374
Doctor!

76
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,212
Up here!

77
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,047
Groves, Leslie. Friends call me Dick.
Sit down.

78
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,084
Ingenuity.

79
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:46,493
I love it.
Created out of nothing but up here.

80
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,327
Clear!

81
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,470
The old man likes his privacy,
doesn't he?

82
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,763
Guess what.

83
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:23,834
- The egghead wants a carrot juice.
- Get him what he wants, Bronson!

84
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,264
Get used to it.

85
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,565
What an eight ball this guy is.

86
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,743
Seems this Oppenheimer's
a hot number.

87
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,211
Says here, he's got more damn brains
than are decent.

88
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:40,648
He knows it too. Temperamental. He
ain't gonna be an easy horse to corral.

89
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,017
Oh, I think the general
knows what he's doing.

90
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,254
Oppenheimer ain't one of us.

91
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,519
The general picks that guy,
he'll be making a mistake.

92
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:58,001
It needs to get pulled together.

93
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,435
So I think you're the man for the job.

94
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,309
And I got a weakness for good men.

95
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,245
The Krauts are working on this,
full bore.

96
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,755
If they get it before we do,
I don't have to spell it out.

97
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,951
Where would you start?

98
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,819
Focus.

99
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,664
You have great minds,
but all dancing to a different tune.

100
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,963
You bring them together in one place,
isolate them, no distractions.

101
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,731
You create an atmosphere
of creative stress.

102
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,001
Everyone competing
to solve one problem.

103
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,007
And you have one ringmaster.

104
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:45,313
Right now, it's all over the place.
You centralize everything.

105
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,418
There is a hitch.

106
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,045
There are people out there
don't like the color of your politics.

107
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,453
My politics...

108
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,526
...are an open book.

109
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,554
Well, I hope so.

110
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,634
You could win a war
and the Nobel Prize, God willing.

111
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,102
Sir, Major de Silva
wanted me to remind you

112
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,774
you've got a train to catch
at 1800 hours.

113
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,001
No rest for the wicked.

114
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,380
Oh, doctor.

115
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:22,819
If you take this on,
I say this in all humility, intellect...

116
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,556
...don't outrank that.

117
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,855
This general is a meatball,
a cipher.

118
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,125
He'd be eating out of the palm
of my hand in a week.

119
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,292
So will you accept?

120
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:44,202
There are questions.
There are a kaleidoscope of questions.

121
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,741
I see.

122
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:52,244
Well, I'm a star
at breakfast small talk.

123
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,684
You'll have to save some for evenings if
you're gonna be wife of the big cheese.

124
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,449
Would this mean moving?

125
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,055
Oh, you have to say yes.

126
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,720
You're too brilliant for Berkeley.

127
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:12,770
<i>Michelangelo's The Creation
of Adam. Origin and destiny.</i>

128
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,141
Origins and destiny.

129
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,710
The struggle to unearth the one
and to discover the other.

130
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,711
That is science!

131
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,181
And as I leave here
to unravel my own small destiny,

132
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,753
I congratulate each of you
on being the best of the best.

133
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,822
I have faith in you all.

134
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:36,451
God keep you, and may your lives
be rich and sweet.

135
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,688
- Thank you.
- We'll miss you, Oppie!

136
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,695
We'll miss you, Oppie!

137
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,834
Good luck, Oppie!

138
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:09,027
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!

139
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,393
Let's move that thing out back.

140
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,206
Sir!

141
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,976
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Give me the good news, Jack.

142
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,475
We've got utilities on
throughout camp.

143
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:04,605
We've got the sewage problem taken
care of. We have water throughout.

144
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,776
- Got the two science buildings...
- Not good enough.

145
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,217
We gotta be
a couple of weeks behind.

146
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,153
You know, I got a bunch
of scientists up there.

147
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,055
They're just wandering,
bumping into each other.

148
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,823
Get some bodies in here. In a week,
I wanna be two weeks ahead.

149
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,297
I don't think we have
accommodations, sir.

150
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,459
Why would they want
accommodations?

151
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,968
You think they'll sleep?

152
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,932
All right, get some tents,
but put it on your EOR.

153
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,377
Didn't I ask for dogs
around that perimeter fence?

154
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,242
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see any.

155
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,178
They're coming, general.

156
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,549
So...

157
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:51,823
...whatever goes on around here
is privileged information.

158
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:58,334
No exceptions. No wives, no barbers.
No exceptions!

159
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,006
What you see,

160
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:06,267
what you hear, what you read,
what you dream about,

161
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,446
whatever...

162
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,376
...gives you heartburn or feeds your
ulcers, whatever gives you the sweats,

163
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,316
keeps you up at night, whatever,

164
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,285
all of that...

165
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,950
...belongs to the United States Army.

166
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:28,156
Or to me, if that makes you feel
more comfortable.

167
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,631
Now, you gotta come down
out of the clouds, gentlemen,

168
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:37,070
and get into the business
of winning a war.

169
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:41,702
I'm gonna say it once.
I'm only gonna say it once.

170
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,372
Those of you who know, know.
Those of you who don't, don't.

171
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,511
You are not here to be comfortable.

172
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,881
All right?

173
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,190
You are here

174
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,060
to go beyond the theoretical,

175
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,098
the speculative, the fanciful.

176
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:11,675
You are here to harness
your God-given talents,

177
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,142
your minds, your energy,

178
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:18,773
in the practical pursuit of one thing:

179
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,311
A military weapon.

180
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,284
Nuclear one.

181
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,713
An atomic bomb.

182
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:30,658
Keep the muttering
to just a minimum, gentlemen.

183
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:34,555
Why bother with a bomb?
Why not just drop that man on Berlin?

184
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,930
- When you talk about it...
- It will have the same effect.

185
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:43,234
...it will be referred to as ''the gadget''
or ''the device''.

186
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,171
Is that clear?

187
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,470
There is one word
that I don't wanna hear.

188
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,147
And that's the word ''impossible''.

189
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,081
- You're two days late.
- I went to 109 East Palace Street

190
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,987
to report to Mrs. McKibben,
but there was nobody there.

191
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,564
So I hopped a construction bus, and it
damn near drove me back to Chicago.

192
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:11,965
I've been sitting on trains, buses,

193
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:16,504
railway stations for 60 hours.

194
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,044
I asked about this place in Santa Fe,
and they said it didn't exist.

195
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,909
It doesn't.

196
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,613
So where does a fellow
get some chow around here, huh?

197
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,352
- We already ate.
- Oh, great.

198
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,929
Oh, if you wanna take a shower,
I'd take one now.

199
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
They turn off the water at 2:00.

200
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,834
Keep those two men back there.
We still gotta run the power through.

201
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,476
Yeah, you two men there!

202
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,351
Higher! A little more.

203
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,388
All right, that'll do it.

204
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,252
Open this door, now!

205
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,628
Sorry. I couldn't get in.

206
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,233
Give it a month, you'll do that
because you can't get out.

207
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,663
- You Merriman?
- Yeah.

208
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,236
Richard Schoenfield.
I'm the doctor around here.

209
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,500
You're just what I'm looking for
in a roommate, a little brute strength.

210
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,945
Holy shit!

211
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,514
- What in God's name is this?
- It looks like a fridge.

212
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,514
Oh, yeah, it does.

213
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,482
It looks stuck.

214
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,215
I guess you arrived just in time then.
Thank God you're here.

215
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,450
Which end would you like?

216
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,793
Are you ready?

217
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,762
- You want me to get it myself?
- Lift.

218
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,914
Oppie's boys.
No problem left unsolved.

219
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:15,424
Gentlemen, this project
has been separated into three areas.

220
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,960
The physics.
How much material do we need?

221
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,928
Should it be plutonium
or uranium 235?

222
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,501
Second, manufacture of material,
but that's out of our hands.

223
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,672
That's Oak Ridge, Tennessee
and Hanford. And third,

224
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,239
our responsibility,
and this is a cinch...

225
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,070
Yeah, sure.

226
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:36,544
...build the device, test it,
and just hope that we can control it.

227
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,945
Gentlemen, we are here...

228
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:44,850
...at the beginning.
Our objective is here.

229
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,583
We have a deadline of 19 months.

230
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,960
19 months?
It seems such a short time.

231
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,363
19 months coincides
with our anticipated delivery date

232
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,834
from Oak Ridge. Gentlemen,
we have 19 months, that's it...

233
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,667
...to box, wrap
and deliver this package.

234
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,805
Are there any dissenters?

235
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,403
No?

236
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,477
Good.

237
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,752
<i>Nineteen months
and starting from scratch, Jesus.</i>

238
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:20,517
<i>Still, Oppie's got the best theoreticians
and engineers in the world.</i>

239
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:25,322
<i>Some of these guys are legends and
so young. The place is a hothouse.</i>

240
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,988
<i>Doc, he seems like
he's gonna be a good man.</i>

241
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,536
<i>Reckons we'll be working with funny
stuff. He's gonna be looking out for us.</i>

242
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:36,435
<i>He's got a whole wing of the hospital
that looks like Noah's Ark.</i>

243
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,834
<i>I think of Jimmy fighting in the
Philippines, and I can't complain.</i>

244
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,482
<i>I love you, but I gotta go.
General wants a progress report.</i>

245
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,210
<i>When Groves wants something,
he wants it now.</i>

246
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,013
Again.

247
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,519
We build a cannon, and at the end

248
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,855
weld a stopper
made from a subcritical mass.

249
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,125
We fabricate a shell
made from another subcritical mass

250
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,291
and fire it down the barrel.

251
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,105
- How much of both materials?
- Projecting 30 pounds.

252
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,298
30 pounds is as far away
as the moon.

253
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,637
<i>We're trying to tap the energy
that fuels the universe.</i>

254
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,975
<i>It's petrifying. All we've got
so far are problems,</i>

255
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,550
<i>and that doesn't include the ones
we haven't thought about.</i>

256
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,483
Shake down the bad news.
I'm getting used to it.

257
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,681
At the moment, there are
two problems. Pre-detonation.

258
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,383
The gadget disintegrates
before it explodes.

259
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,927
Second, it's the weight problem.

260
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,759
For the slug to travel at the velocity
we need,

261
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,367
the gun barrel
would be so heavy, so thick,

262
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,165
I don't think we'd get the gadget
off the ground with a crane.

263
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,774
If they're talking about a slug
with a seven-inch diameter,

264
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:48,845
then you'd have to have a barrel
thickness of at least four inches.

265
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,351
I hope you guys find the music.

266
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,082
The way things are,
we can't even hum the tune.

267
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,954
Free discussion.
Two groups...

268
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,493
- I'm not comfortable with...
- Excuse me.

269
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:08,622
Seth, Deke, the gun barrel.
Robert, Michael, pre-detonation.

270
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:16,074
Damn it! Just, damn it!
Maybe it's the altitude.

271
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,775
But we're still just chalk
on a blackboard.

272
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,844
We're dead in the water.

273
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,547
Maybe we cast a lighter
gun barrel, find a new alloy.

274
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,411
The force would be too great.

275
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,919
We gotta smack these atoms together
to trigger a chain reaction.

276
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:35,287
We gotta concentrate the energy
and crush the mass.

277
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,428
All right, let's rethink this.

278
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:41,362
We have a gun barrel that's so heavy
we can't lift it with a plane.

279
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,593
To get the explosive power we need,
it's gotta be heavy.

280
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,937
Michael, come here!

281
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,301
When I squeeze this...

282
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,343
- ...what do I get?
- Juice.

283
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:57,471
No. I squeeze it, I get compression.

284
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,482
We get a hollow sphere
of plutonium,

285
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,985
and we compress it
with an explosion that goes in.

286
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,454
- An implosion.
- Chain reaction.

287
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,422
Boom!

288
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,323
- But, Seth, explosives go out.
- I know.

289
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,432
But we make one that goes in.

290
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,330
Jesus.

291
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,301
- Michael.
- Let's get the boys.

292
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,565
We'll meet down here in the canteen.

293
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:28,439
It's brilliant. The device is gonna be so
light that we don't need a gun barrel!

294
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,142
Got a match, soldier?

295
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,288
Sir, it's Michael and Seth!

296
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,432
I'm sorry to bother you.

297
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,536
But Seth had an idea.
He was thinking of an orange.

298
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:56,037
Yes, I was thinking of jumping
up and down on an orange.

299
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,142
- Crushing an orange.
- Crushing!

300
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,438
Crushing...the core.

301
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,411
Oh, God.
This could be very sweet.

302
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,178
- Where are the others?
- Canteen, they wanna kick it around.

303
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:11,550
- Perhaps it can wait till later?
- No, you go ahead.

304
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,556
- I'd have lost you anyway.
- Thank you.

305
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,630
Goddamn it.

306
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,078
Doctor!

307
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,949
- Come on!
- Double up, over here!

308
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:51,960
I'm sorry. We were looking for testing
sites and the bus got stuck.

309
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,191
You had a meeting last night.
You discussed the work in public.

310
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,461
We were discussing
Neddermeyer's...

311
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,537
- In public!
- A table in the back of the canteen.

312
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:05,437
- We were having a free discussion.
- Let's just talk about that.

313
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,977
I don't want free discussion.
I want compartmentalization.

314
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,981
I don't want theoreticians
knowing what engineers know.

315
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,609
- Listen to me...
- It is a security problem!

316
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,417
These kids are used to pinning
their best ideas on a board.

317
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:24,289
Ideas are community property.
It's a matter of principle.

318
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:28,064
You force my hand and there
won't be any free discussion

319
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,634
because there won't be anybody left
to have it!

320
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:35,998
If you'd been there you'd understand.
Neddermeyer's idea was brilliant.

321
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,005
An explosion that goes inwards,

322
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,839
producing uniform compression
in a core and it'd be lightweight.

323
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,811
No gun barrel,
no velocity and weight problem.

324
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,611
And all of that
out of free discussion.

325
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,346
You've got to give us room
to breathe.

326
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,919
- Bronson?
- Sir?

327
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,653
Just don't give it to the waitresses.

328
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,731
<i>Oppie's quite a match
for the general.</i>

329
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,468
<i>I'm worried it's not in Groves' nature
to rest until he gets the upper hand.</i>

330
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,805
<i>We're terrified the Germans
are ahead.</i>

331
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:19,849
<i>Working with restrictions
and regulations is setting us on edge.</i>

332
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,454
This is typical.
We are people, not numbers!

333
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,886
It's not part of the agreement,
general.

334
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:29,254
I apologize for complaints,
but barbed wire,

335
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,190
dogs, guards!

336
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,558
- Security badges!
- Secrets!

337
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,792
I hoped to leave these things in Italy
with Mussolini!

338
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,801
Openness is a principle
matter for scientists!

339
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:44,101
And there are many other things.
I resent my letters are being censored.

340
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:48,211
The FBI talking to me, that's one
thing. But my wife, my family,

341
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,372
that's a little much.
Don't you think?

342
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,781
We cannot continue work
under these conditions!

343
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,387
- Doctor.
- And what about...?

344
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,867
Well, that is some monkey house
in there.

345
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,572
A mess.
What are you gonna do about it?

346
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,833
I warned you about this.

347
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:24,382
Look, you give me responsibility
for security inside the lab.

348
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,074
We go where we like, as we like,
when we like.

349
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,743
Outside the lab, that's yours.

350
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,889
I will sell them on that.

351
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:40,465
I don't like it.
But I will live with it, for now.

352
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,031
<i>The 8th Air Force today</i>

353
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:54,644
<i>carried out its heaviest bombing
of the war against Germany.</i>

354
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,271
Michael! Michael. What do you say?
Good to see you.

355
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,317
- How are you?
- I brought Kathleen with me.

356
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:05,582
I was afraid this party would be
a little short on the beauty side,

357
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:10,353
so I took the appropriate precautions,
if you know what I'm saying.

358
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,831
- I mean, she is my favorite nurse.
- You two gonna get together?

359
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:20,894
No. No, we're not.
Actually, I'm gonna get a drink.

360
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:26,373
That's what I'm gonna get. A good
stiff drink, that's all I'm gonna get.

361
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,943
- Two bucks...
- It's a short bet.

362
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,081
- Like I said...
- This is stuck.

363
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,451
...it can be pretty lonely here.

364
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,489
There's a war on.

365
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,686
Not everybody can go to Acapulco.

366
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,639
- Oh, my.
- Are you OK?

367
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,475
Good.
Thank you.

368
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,580
Look, they're perfect.

369
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,082
Another minute,
they would have been overdone.

370
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,916
Well, I'll put this in the sink.

371
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,148
- Would you like some orange juice?
- Yes, kindly.

372
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:18,489
- I am sorry.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

373
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,764
- This will be taken care of.
- It's OK.

374
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:28,998
Anyway, I'm sure
we're going to be allies, general.

375
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,008
We're both trying to seduce
the same man.

376
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,583
So is there a Mrs. Groves?

377
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,714
Yes, there is.

378
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:49,150
And she has the courage
to stay in the background.

379
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:53,520
Some men are on the planet
for a purpose, Mrs. Oppenheimer.

380
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:58,863
A good wife recognizes that
and is happy to smooth the way.

381
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,971
Read my theory
on degenerate matter, did you?

382
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,113
It didn't generate
much enthusiasm elsewhere.

383
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,114
But what do you think we'll find
at the end of the tunnel, Michael?

384
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,685
- A martini.
- Probably.

385
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,419
Hey!

386
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:41,074
<i>- Operator.
- Berkeley 5558, please.</i>

387
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,343
Hello, Jean.
It's me.

388
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,082
<i>- Jean, I know you're there.
- I'd given up waiting.</i>

389
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,426
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to manage...

390
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:59,062
<i>Oppie, I've been so frightened.</i>

391
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,324
<i>You don't phone. You don't write.
Not even a message.</i>

392
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,263
<i>- I can't.
- You can't?</i>

393
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,063
<i>No, Jean, I can't.</i>

394
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,864
<i>- Are you coming?
- Well...</i>

395
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,871
<i>- When are you coming?
- Jean.</i>

396
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,547
<i>This isn't talking.
This is just making noises.</i>

397
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,909
<i>Why don't we just grunt
at each other?</i>

398
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,847
<i>- ''I gotta run. There's a war to win.''
- Jean.</i>

399
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,456
<i>I can't remember a day
I wasn't hurting, except with you.</i>

400
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:29,457
Jean, listen to me.
You've got to understand, please.

401
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,512
Yes?

402
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,390
I won't keep you, general.

403
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,186
Well, you better had.

404
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,387
Banging on my door
at 2:00 in the morning.

405
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,263
I had this typed up, sir.
I thought you'd wanna see it.

406
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,340
She's working him over, general.
I've seen this before.

407
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,070
That grunting at each other,
could be a code.

408
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,648
- The cipher clerk said it's not code.
- Who is this woman?

409
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:29,218
Jean Tatlock, sir.
She's a known communist.

410
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,685
Get me her background.

411
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,624
And maybe I am missing some stuff
on the good doctor.

412
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,762
- Get it for me.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,889
This must throw Oppenheimer's
position on this project into doubt, sir.

414
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,366
- Dr. Oppenheimer is the project.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,566
All due respect, sir, though, doesn't
this make him an unacceptable risk?

416
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,745
No! Failure's a risk.

417
00:31:56,381 --> 00:32:00,511
The thing that concerns me is,
if he's with her, he's not with us.

418
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,921
It might be a good time
to put the screws to the doctor.

419
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,255
Yes, sir. May I ask,
how do you intend to do that, sir?

420
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,863
No, colonel, you may not.

421
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,460
- Compression not uniform.
- Stand by!

422
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,360
If we had a thinner wall, we could
increase the compression, yes?

423
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,228
Seth, there's an answer here.

424
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,892
Oppie, maybe implosion's
just a blind alley.

425
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,799
- Are we going again?
- Yes!

426
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,442
- That's an excuse for not thinking...
- We'll get reset.

427
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:04,741
All clear!
Reset the charges!

428
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,749
Reset the charges!

429
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,979
- We got all clear! Let's go!
- Let's move!

430
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:15,387
- Move it!
- On the double! On the double! Go!

431
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:19,758
- Move it! Move it!
- Bring it in! Left side! Left side!

432
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,458
Come on!
Get the lead out!

433
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,363
On the double, guys!
Let's go!

434
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,071
Canyon to Los Alamos.

435
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,674
Come in, Los Alamos.

436
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,972
Canyon to Los Alamos.

437
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,181
Come in, Los Alamos. Come in.

438
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:47,956
- Something set off the detonators.
- Stay back! They're wired in series.

439
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,889
Get out of there!

440
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,524
- No, Oppie.
- Shit.

441
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,508
It's all right.

442
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,951
Take it easy, brother.

443
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,884
Thanks a lot.

444
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,657
Do me a favor.
Jump in the ambulance.

445
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,527
Let me give you
the once-over.

446
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,828
You guys are playing
with some funny stuff out here.

447
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,599
Let's go. Start them up.

448
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,290
Did they teach you that at high school?

449
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,786
You took a risk.

450
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,931
I ran out and grabbed the guy.
I didn't even think.

451
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,126
- Just instinct.
- Instinct, huh?

452
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,736
You know, I wonder,
with this war...

453
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,502
...if it's instinct to save a man,
what makes us want to kill one?

454
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,903
Is that instinct?

455
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,284
You sound like my old man.

456
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:21,849
Why, what's he like?

457
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,283
- My old man?
- Yeah.

458
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,387
He's a preacher.

459
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,552
In Jackson, Illinois.

460
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:35,425
And I got an older brother,
Jimmy, and he's a soldier.

461
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,659
My mom's dead.

462
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:41,635
I don't know, I guess he's kind of
hurt that I'm not at the front.

463
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,068
- Why?
- Well, Jackson is a small town.

464
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,643
- He said, ''Where you going?''
- I said, ''Santa Fe, New Mexico.''

465
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,909
- I know.
- So that didn't quite hack it.

466
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,818
He said,
''lf you're not gonna be a soldier,

467
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,478
''you better be a good scientist.
The best.''

468
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,554
- Are you the best?
- I was in Chicago.

469
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,459
But these guys are so bright.

470
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,098
Sometimes I feel like
I'm in over my head.

471
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,430
But I guess I can handle
anything they throw at me.

472
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,070
But can you dance?

473
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,764
Pardon me?

474
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,808
I said, can you dance?

475
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:25,978
- Yeah.
- Well, do it.

476
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,544
- Are you serious?
- Can't handle it?

477
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,876
Very nice.

478
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,455
- Something like that.
- Very good.

479
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,977
Jean Tatlock, graduated in 1932.

480
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:39,418
They had a thing together
before Oppenheimer was married.

481
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,182
Seems Tatlock ran off.

482
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,487
Things went on the back burner
between them till 1942.

483
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,357
Then it all started up again.

484
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,864
His associate said, ''lf the wife's
his ambition, Tatlock's his conscience.''

485
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:55,199
She introduced him to a number of
anti-fascist groups, anti-Franco groups

486
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,896
and a number of communists.

487
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,370
- Bronson.
- Sir.

488
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:02,273
Little less muscle on the gas here.
Colonel's starting a mission.

489
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,708
I'd like him alive.

490
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,310
Yes, sir.

491
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,452
This makes Oppenheimer
a sitting duck for blackmail.

492
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,019
I'm gonna insist on his removal.

493
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,588
No, you're not. Just relax.

494
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:18,388
You know, major, if you want
to lead a man in a certain direction,

495
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,156
you don't drag him by the nose.

496
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,632
You just close off his options.

497
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,996
Simple as a truck.

498
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,842
<i>Here we are in the top of the ninth.</i>

499
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,478
<i>The Army down
to the Scientists by one run.</i>

500
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:40,377
<i>Dugan shakes it off.
Here's Merriman's pitch.</i>

501
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,212
<i>That's a hit.</i>

502
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,150
<i>Dugan digging for first base,
gonna go for two.</i>

503
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,884
<i>Look out. Here's the throw.
Safe at second base on a slide.</i>

504
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,961
<i>Apple scores.
That ties the game.</i>

505
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,203
Yes?

506
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,731
Yes?!

507
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,437
Bad time?

508
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:14,243
The velocity's still presenting us
with something of a problem.

509
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,486
Who's this bimbo
you're running around with?

510
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,292
- What?
- Do I have to tell you?

511
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,630
I got it on the q.t.
from somebody who owes me.

512
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,927
What if the next guy
doesn't owe me?

513
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,764
Takes that kind of information
to the wrong guy?

514
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:39,375
That could be the end of you.
Could be the end of this project.

515
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,044
I don't understand you.

516
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:47,010
You think you're some kind
of bohemian or something.

517
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,912
Blind-sided.

518
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,583
I never expected to get
blind-sided like this.

519
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,528
<i>And there it is.
A line drive.</i>

520
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:12,576
Doctor, might I be of assistance?

521
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,201
What about me in all this?
This looks bad.

522
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,043
Reflects on me.
Reflects on my ability to choose men.

523
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:24,119
I was with this woman before
this project. This is not a new thing.

524
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,254
It's no matter.

525
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:31,055
I am not comfortable with the idea
that you could sink me.

526
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,633
This is someone that I care about.

527
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,032
She's a communist.

528
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,029
A communist.

529
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,507
Oh, my God.

530
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:48,338
It would be bad enough if she
were just some...

531
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,343
...sweet young thing from Indiana.

532
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,505
She's a card-carrying communist.

533
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:57,721
And your job, classified job. What do
I have to do, draw you a map?

534
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:01,255
Get on the phone, a secure line,
tell her...goodbye!

535
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,222
<i>The pitch. It's a line drive!</i>

536
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,929
<i>It's out of there! It's gone!
Home run for Merriman.</i>

537
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,063
Home run!

538
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,403
- It's all right, Bronson, we'll live.
- Yes, sir.

539
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:18,064
<i>Well, that's it, folks,
Scientists win the game.</i>

540
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,833
It's in your court.

541
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,123
Bridges, next time keep your head up.

542
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,024
<i>All hail the conquering hero.</i>

543
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,964
<i>Pencil pushers defeat
the doughboys.</i>

544
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:35,713
Robert!

545
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,981
- Frank.
- Good to see you, bro.

546
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,928
- Are we being followed or something?
- Don't joke.

547
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,087
I nearly asked you for your ID.

548
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:52,227
- That's ridiculous.
- Let's just leave as soon as we can.

549
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:05,073
They've been hounding me
for names of every person I've known

550
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,876
who had communist sympathies.

551
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:11,253
They monitor every move I make.
They listen to my phone conversations.

552
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,946
Why stay?

553
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:15,091
There's an order to it.

554
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,251
An order in some part of my life,
at least.

555
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,956
I'm sorry, I didn't get your message
till about 5.

556
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:27,160
I was still at the hospital, and I got
all whizzed up into a huge panic.

557
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,032
You look wonderful.

558
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,901
You look so serious.
What's the matter?

559
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,410
I don't have much time.
I have to go back tonight.

560
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,104
Tonight?

561
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,250
I cooked us dinner.

562
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,250
This can't be about dinner, Jean.

563
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,988
I didn't want to tell you
on the telephone.

564
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,496
And that's why I'm here tonight.

565
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,773
Is it because of what you're doing?

566
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,056
Fine.

567
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:25,919
We're going to spill the blood
before we get to the cocktails.

568
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,837
Jean?

569
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:46,037
Please...stay tonight.

570
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,484
Please.

571
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,280
Please.

572
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,951
Please.

573
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,526
Please.

574
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,845
What you're working on,
it's something bad, isn't it?

575
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,992
That's why you can't tell me.

576
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,855
I can't tell you
because it's a secret.

577
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,564
Tell me one good thing
that's a secret.

578
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,633
We were a good thing.

579
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,326
No, we weren't.

580
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,664
Not when you got married.

581
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,970
Give me up for something
I can understand.

582
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,635
Your wife or your child
or your conscience,

583
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,576
something alive.

584
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,445
Not something
that you have to hide.

585
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,777
Robert.

586
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,615
Oh, Robert, I dreamt you'd gone.

587
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,866
So that's what the silences were.

588
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:47,870
No letters, no contact.

589
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,201
I thought it was me,
something I'd done.

590
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:56,641
- I've told you it has nothing to do...
- Yes, but you didn't tell me...

591
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:02,079
What is it you're working on?
What is so important?

592
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,743
That's right. It is important.

593
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,186
So don't be so goddamn arrogant.

594
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:10,019
Is it arrogant to want
to know where you are?

595
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:14,062
What's happening to you? To want
to be close to you? To understand?

596
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,725
This was the man I loved.

597
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:23,705
I loved his dreams.
I loved what he saw but couldn't prove.

598
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,638
I loved the goodness in him.

599
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:30,541
He was my proof that the world
could be made better.

600
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,906
And if he's dead, I don't want to live.

601
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:40,219
The world is...different.

602
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,690
It's just not what we
wanted it to be.

603
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,556
It's just not.

604
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,837
You mattered to me so much.

605
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:59,238
You really did.

606
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:15,820
She told me that I had
a penchant for destruction.

607
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,225
That I'd lost faith.

608
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,223
Is she wrong?

609
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,159
No.

610
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,766
She's not wrong.

611
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:31,229
When this war's over, I want
to ride the mesa for six months.

612
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:32,931
No deadlines.

613
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,175
Nothing.

614
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,177
Thanks, Frank.

615
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,445
He just kissed his brother.

616
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,521
Gotta be a communist.

617
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:04,966
Set that over there.

618
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:11,572
Look at it, Oppie, it's twisted.
It's got to be flat.

619
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:16,151
I think implosion's nothing but a pipe
dream. I'm sorry I thought of it.

620
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,947
I can't do it.

621
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:22,422
Oppie, some way I have to focus...
I have to focus the shock waves.

622
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,159
Look at me!
God, I'm running out of ideas.

623
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:29,265
That's an excuse for not thinking.
If you can't, I'll find somebody else.

624
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:32,596
Oppie? Serber needs
you back at the lab right now.

625
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,760
- Oppie?
- You said it yourself.

626
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:38,840
Focus. Somebody's working on a way
to focus an explosive shock wave.

627
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,807
- I'm gonna find him. Keep working.
- Jesus!

628
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:52,417
You know, if Oppie doesn't let up,
he's going to implode.

629
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,568
Inside. Inside.

630
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:15,467
Good news is the new plutonium
makes lots of neutrons.

631
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,547
But the bad news is the spontaneous
fission rate is way too high.

632
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:23,482
The reaction will run away with itself.
There will just be a fizzle.

633
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,816
- No explosion.
- You're certain of that, Edward?

634
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,049
- Who did the calculations?
- Serber.

635
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:32,059
- Himself?
- Serber, personally.

636
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:37,059
So now plutonium is a problem. That
shifts the emphasis back to U-235.

637
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:41,330
Of course, Oak Ridge is not able
to produce that in sufficient quantity.

638
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:45,030
We must go with implosion, but
Neddermeyer has just announced to me

639
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,700
that he and implosion
have just reached a brick wall.

640
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,845
We can't fall behind.

641
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,748
Are you all right, Oppie?

642
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,878
You have a deadline to meet.

643
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:05,995
Banked almost a billion dollars on you
guys. That's not working on the cheap.

644
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,964
Only thing I want to hear is, ''Yes, sir.''

645
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:13,262
Don't talk to me like I haven't given
eight days a week to this project.

646
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,062
I've given up everything.

647
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,240
Don't... Don't give me that.

648
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,532
I don't want to hear
that from the...

649
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,540
I've given up everything.

650
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,145
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

651
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,814
I don't give a goddamn
that travel was restricted.

652
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:31,647
It had to be done face to face,
and that's the way I did it.

653
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,692
<i>Latest news
from the fighting front.</i>

654
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:46,061
<i>American armies are pushing the
Germans back on their own territory.</i>

655
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,726
<i>But fighting is desperate.</i>

656
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,203
<i>The Germans are building up
for a massive counter thrust.</i>

657
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:54,434
<i>Though the Allies are determined
to hold this new front...</i>

658
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:55,906
Who's the Lone Ranger?

659
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,172
Explosives wiz.
I don't know about Tonto.

660
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,908
<i>Neddermeyer gave up
on his explosion that goes in.</i>

661
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,346
<i>Not Oppie, though.</i>

662
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,682
<i>He brought in two explosive
experts from the outside.</i>

663
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,153
<i>We struggle on here
in our isolation.</i>

664
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:11,556
<i>And sometimes the war
seems a long way away.</i>

665
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,561
You want a ride, doc?

666
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:22,034
Hey, Seth. When did you
get your driver's license?

667
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,143
- You come to see the boys at play?
- Yes.

668
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,609
- Oh, bad news, beautiful.
- Oh, no.

669
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,340
I'm not gonna be able to make
that movie tonight.

670
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,142
I can join you both for a drink.
It would make you happy.

671
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,254
- Sound good?
- Perfect.

672
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:42,187
Right, right.

673
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:46,318
Well, I promised the monkey
we'd be cutting a rug anyway.

674
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,396
It's just as well.

675
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:51,226
Michael, what's wrong with you?

676
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,363
Do you see much of him?

677
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,471
Yes, I like him.

678
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:02,068
Are you jealous?

679
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:06,243
Yeah.

680
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,450
You better do something about it.

681
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:27,361
Tell them I ain't buying.
White House said

682
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,404
there wouldn't be
any account till after the war.

683
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,741
It's so damn tough
to get through to you,

684
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:37,141
I decided to bring
you my problem.

685
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:40,681
See the tread on that tire?
Because I sure as hell don't.

686
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:43,375
Yet that's what my men
are riding around on.

687
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:48,016
I don't know what kind of deal
you got yourself into, Groves,

688
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,887
but I do care when it cuts
in on my territory.

689
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,724
If I'm gonna move supplies around
the country, I need trucks.

690
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,957
Those trucks run on tires, Dick.

691
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:01,297
When I hear they ain't moving because
of some tire shortage, I get mad.

692
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:04,405
When I hear you're the cause
of it, I want to kill.

693
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:08,510
- We gotta work something...
- No dice. We got a triple-A priority.

694
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:11,840
White House authority.
We need the product.

695
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:16,375
You need to know something.

696
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,919
You're getting a lot
of people's backs up.

697
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:22,117
Let me remind you of something else.
See this?

698
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,657
I count two. You got one.

699
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,262
When this war's over,
that will amount to something.

700
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:33,865
And, Dick, I hope you get my meaning.

701
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,664
Because, by all that's holy...

702
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,539
...you better have
your ass well-covered.

703
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,814
- Well, Bronson.
- Sir?

704
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:56,022
- It's all about ass, isn't it?
- Sir?

705
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,717
You kick it or you lick it.

706
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:01,125
That's what it's all about.

707
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,858
I'm sorry about
my language, Bronson.

708
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,729
But I'm on the limb.

709
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,369
My prima donnas
better come through...

710
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:12,731
...or you are looking
at a piece of dead meat.

711
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,538
Yes, sir.

712
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,457
- What's this?
- I don't know, sir.

713
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,391
God, almighty.

714
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,323
Is this a stop?

715
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,225
What time is it?
There's no scheduled stop here.

716
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:47,505
Message for General Groves.

717
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:52,737
- I'll see what the problem is, sir.
- Message for General Groves.

718
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,146
- Message for General Groves.
- In this way.

719
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,491
General Groves, sir.
This is from Germany.

720
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:08,188
It was flown in. We wired
ahead to have the train stopped.

721
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,299
Excuse me, gentlemen.

722
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,811
- Colonel.
- General.

723
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:34,222
Put it in my safe, in the back.

724
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,153
Don't bring it out.

725
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:42,029
That means the Germans don't
have the bomb. Weren't close.

726
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:45,326
Sir, is it wise?
I mean, suppressing this?

727
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,560
Well, you tell me, colonel.

728
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:51,135
It's delicate stuff.

729
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:56,039
I'm talking about my longhairs,
my prima donnas.

730
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,839
The Jewish element.

731
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:02,847
Take Hitler out of the equation...
they might just run out of stink.

732
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:05,010
Why chance it?

733
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:09,314
We can give this country
the biggest stick in the playground.

734
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:11,289
And I intend to do that.

735
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:16,189
And I'll tell you something
about our bunch.

736
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:17,856
Get them close.

737
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:21,032
Then they'll go all the way.

738
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,339
They're just not close enough yet.

739
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:26,099
Yes, sir.

740
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:38,077
Perhaps you should think of these
wedges as forming part of a shell.

741
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:43,586
They do redirect the shock waves in
the same way as a lens redirects light.

742
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,389
As a matter of interest, we've
already used the idea in England

743
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,794
for armor-piercing shells.

744
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,095
Pray it works.
We'll be back on schedule.

745
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,705
Heads up.

746
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,002
Watch your backs.

747
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:29,438
No one ever used high explosives...

748
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:32,973
...as a precision instrument before.

749
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,105
It's so simple.

750
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:38,770
It just swings the shock waves
from convex to concave.

751
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,974
- Some orange, hey, Oppie?
- No, after the explosion.

752
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:49,418
Dr. Oppenheimer.

753
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,288
Dr. Oppenheimer.

754
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:52,758
A letter for you, sir.

755
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,489
- They said it was important.
- Thank you.

756
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,911
Good luck.

757
01:00:09,697 --> 01:00:12,131
<i>We squeezed it!
Damn it, we got compression!</i>

758
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:15,166
<i>We're on the way!
The right mix and we're home, Oppie!</i>

759
01:00:15,336 --> 01:00:17,803
<i>We're home free, vindicated!
We're vindicated!</i>

760
01:00:17,971 --> 01:00:20,997
- We got a ball game here.
- Seth, come here!

761
01:00:21,674 --> 01:00:23,869
Next stop, implosion!

762
01:00:53,637 --> 01:00:56,037
Can I come in?

763
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,437
Where is he?

764
01:00:58,608 --> 01:01:00,303
He's out back.

765
01:01:00,944 --> 01:01:03,969
Sitting in the sun
with a blanket on his lap.

766
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:07,748
Nursing a guilty dick, no doubt.

767
01:01:09,418 --> 01:01:12,387
It is not necessary to be vulgar.

768
01:01:13,722 --> 01:01:16,087
Nothing I say could
approach the vulgarity

769
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:18,589
of what you're building
in your back yard.

770
01:01:20,995 --> 01:01:24,431
Well, vulgar or not...

771
01:01:24,966 --> 01:01:27,093
...I need him to come
through on this.

772
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:31,203
He owes it to his country.
He owes it to himself.

773
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,700
He is the best there is. And he
should have whatever he wants.

774
01:01:35,876 --> 01:01:39,539
Don't try to recruit me, general.
You don't need my help.

775
01:01:39,913 --> 01:01:43,973
And spare me your homily on being
a good wife. I know it by heart.

776
01:01:45,184 --> 01:01:47,709
Why did you put up with her
for so long?

777
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:52,913
Because he's the best there is.
He should have whatever he wants.

778
01:01:58,296 --> 01:02:00,730
I don't live very well alone.

779
01:02:00,899 --> 01:02:02,264
Some people don't.

780
01:02:02,801 --> 01:02:06,065
We all have different ways
of defending our territory.

781
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:15,469
Concha, you're late.
Peter, hurry up. Didn't I say 2:00?

782
01:02:22,985 --> 01:02:24,509
I'm sorry.

783
01:02:27,423 --> 01:02:32,291
And I am sorry that the news
took so long to get to you.

784
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:34,827
It just got lost
in the system censors.

785
01:02:36,598 --> 01:02:37,860
You know...

786
01:02:40,268 --> 01:02:44,101
...you can't be responsible
for keeping somebody else alive.

787
01:02:45,539 --> 01:02:48,201
It isn't possible.
It's not to be expected.

788
01:02:49,143 --> 01:02:51,668
I can't work on this anymore.

789
01:02:59,018 --> 01:03:00,781
I don't want to.

790
01:03:02,088 --> 01:03:03,715
And I don't need to.

791
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:06,016
Germany is finished.

792
01:03:06,892 --> 01:03:10,293
It's just a matter of time.
They can't pull this together.

793
01:03:10,863 --> 01:03:13,889
- You sure?
- I don't want to hear your arguments.

794
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:18,626
I already know that everything is a risk.

795
01:03:18,803 --> 01:03:21,363
That the war is not over until it's over.

796
01:03:21,539 --> 01:03:24,702
That they're lobbing rockets
all over London.

797
01:03:24,876 --> 01:03:28,277
That Germany is desperate.
That she's resourceful.

798
01:03:28,479 --> 01:03:31,311
If she doesn't get a device,
she could litter England

799
01:03:31,481 --> 01:03:34,882
with radioactive material.
We thought of something similar.

800
01:03:35,051 --> 01:03:36,985
The fact of the matter is...

801
01:03:37,154 --> 01:03:40,351
...they're not as good as we are.
Or are they?

802
01:03:46,729 --> 01:03:48,959
Christ, I've got rats in my skull.

803
01:03:52,535 --> 01:03:56,231
I'm being asked to throw too many
balls in the air at the same time.

804
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,036
When I feel like that,
I get down on my knees...

805
01:04:03,845 --> 01:04:05,175
...and I pray.

806
01:04:06,547 --> 01:04:08,640
And that's how I get conviction.

807
01:04:09,483 --> 01:04:13,146
If you let this slip through your fingers,
through our fingers,

808
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,083
and somebody else gets it...

809
01:04:16,623 --> 01:04:19,921
...you won't be counting how many
balls you throw in the air.

810
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:28,164
If you need the fire, you find it.

811
01:04:29,301 --> 01:04:30,962
Wherever.

812
01:04:39,311 --> 01:04:40,801
<i>At last, some good news.</i>

813
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:45,243
<i>Apparently, sufficient uranium is
beginning to arrive from Oak Ridge.</i>

814
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:49,409
<i>But, as brilliant as he is, Oppie's
beginning to show the strain.</i>

815
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,610
<i>We all depend on Oppie.</i>

816
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:53,756
<i>He's our inspiration.</i>

817
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:56,858
<i>If he were to crack, we'd all fall apart.</i>

818
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:02,288
Beautiful, isn't it, Michael?
Just think...

819
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:05,900
...a few miles closer to the sun,
a few miles farther away,

820
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,798
none of this would be here.
Just a cloud of gas

821
01:05:09,004 --> 01:05:11,404
or a block of ice
and nobody to enjoy it.

822
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:15,034
''Odi et amor'',
''I hate and I love.''

823
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,677
- Catullus. Do you know it?
- No.

824
01:05:20,281 --> 01:05:24,183
<i>I hate and I love
Why, you ask? I don't know</i>

825
01:05:25,086 --> 01:05:28,920
<i>I feel both
And I'm in agony</i>

826
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:34,891
Maybe General Groves is right. Maybe
we should just banish thinking forever.

827
01:05:38,832 --> 01:05:41,425
Michael, we have to test
the critical mass.

828
01:05:42,568 --> 01:05:45,935
- Are you going to help?
- Of course.

829
01:05:46,939 --> 01:05:49,169
I want to show you something.

830
01:06:07,224 --> 01:06:10,421
Come here to see our little toy, huh?

831
01:06:12,696 --> 01:06:16,860
Michael, that's what we call
tickling the dragon's tail.

832
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:20,661
So a slug of uranium
about two by six inches

833
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:23,430
will be pulled by this weight.

834
01:06:23,873 --> 01:06:28,105
It begins here, then accelerates
at 32 feet per second per second.

835
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:32,212
It passes between uranium bricks.
We have an instant of criticality.

836
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:35,679
For a split second,
we have a chain reaction.

837
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:38,944
As close as we come
to an atomic explosion in the lab.

838
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,350
- Without blowing up.
- Exactly.

839
01:06:41,522 --> 01:06:45,424
It's essential to determine the amount
of material the device needs.

840
01:06:45,593 --> 01:06:48,585
Ten years ago I could
hardly imagine the stuff.

841
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,263
Ten years.

842
01:06:50,431 --> 01:06:54,457
Each molecule collected
out of the air, one by one.

843
01:06:57,537 --> 01:06:59,129
Hello?

844
01:07:00,907 --> 01:07:02,169
What?

845
01:07:12,584 --> 01:07:16,213
<i>I have the rare privilege
of speaking for a victorious army</i>

846
01:07:16,388 --> 01:07:18,548
<i>of almost five million fighting men.</i>

847
01:07:18,723 --> 01:07:21,521
<i>They and the women
who have so ably assisted them</i>

848
01:07:21,726 --> 01:07:24,217
<i>constitute the Allied
Expeditionary Force</i>

849
01:07:24,428 --> 01:07:26,862
<i>that has liberated Western Europe.</i>

850
01:07:27,031 --> 01:07:29,556
<i>They have destroyed
or captured enemy armies</i>

851
01:07:29,766 --> 01:07:31,927
<i>totaling more than their own strength</i>

852
01:07:32,102 --> 01:07:35,697
<i>and swept triumphantly forward
over the hundreds of miles</i>

853
01:07:35,872 --> 01:07:37,772
<i>separating Cherbourg from Lbeck,</i>

854
01:07:37,941 --> 01:07:39,238
<i>Leipzig and Munich.</i>

855
01:07:39,409 --> 01:07:42,036
<i>These startling successes
have not been bought</i>

856
01:07:42,211 --> 01:07:43,940
<i>without sorrow and suffering.</i>

857
01:07:44,113 --> 01:07:46,946
<i>In this theater alone,
80,000 Americans</i>

858
01:07:47,116 --> 01:07:49,311
<i>and comparable numbers
among the allies</i>

859
01:07:49,485 --> 01:07:51,385
<i>have had their lives cut short</i>

860
01:07:51,553 --> 01:07:56,080
<i>so that the rest of us might live
in the sunlight of freedom.</i>

861
01:08:06,767 --> 01:08:08,928
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

862
01:08:09,102 --> 01:08:11,570
What are we gonna do
when this is over?

863
01:08:11,738 --> 01:08:13,933
I don't know.
Probably start another one.

864
01:08:14,107 --> 01:08:18,304
That's what I love about this job.
A guaranteed future. I'm not wrong.

865
01:08:18,477 --> 01:08:22,140
Believe me, we're descended
from a long line of noble predators.

866
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:24,315
You are irrepressible.

867
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:28,013
I think I'm gonna go be
irrepressible down with Fuller.

868
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,982
Come on, baby face.

869
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:34,784
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm irrepressible.

870
01:08:35,226 --> 01:08:36,693
So, what are you writing?

871
01:08:36,895 --> 01:08:39,193
Something Oppie said today.
I don't know.

872
01:08:39,364 --> 01:08:41,195
Well, read it. Go on.

873
01:08:44,501 --> 01:08:46,935
Makes you wonder
if there's an intelligence

874
01:08:47,104 --> 01:08:50,039
that isn't descended
from a long line of predators.

875
01:08:52,576 --> 01:08:54,270
I want to kiss you.

876
01:08:55,278 --> 01:08:56,768
Come here.

877
01:09:02,919 --> 01:09:07,252
Sir, is it true that since we KO'd
Germany, we're gonna go home?

878
01:09:07,422 --> 01:09:10,619
- I'll drink to that.
- That might be true, soldier.

879
01:09:14,663 --> 01:09:17,359
Can I have your attention, please?
Please.

880
01:09:17,733 --> 01:09:18,994
Excuse me.

881
01:09:19,166 --> 01:09:23,125
Seems to me that we have a shortage
of dance partners on the floor.

882
01:09:23,304 --> 01:09:25,795
So as a tribute
to our men in uniform...

883
01:09:27,241 --> 01:09:29,675
...l'd like to make
available the services

884
01:09:29,844 --> 01:09:33,040
of all the longhairs at Los Alamos
on this dance floor.

885
01:09:33,213 --> 01:09:36,182
And to break
the ceremonial ice,

886
01:09:36,349 --> 01:09:39,648
I will choose
the first dance partner.

887
01:09:43,922 --> 01:09:49,690
General Groves...
may I have this dance?

888
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:54,261
Why not?

889
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:26,728
- Why do you have that with you?
- I keep it as a record for my dad.

890
01:10:26,896 --> 01:10:29,888
If I wrote him a letter,
all he'd get is black lines.

891
01:10:30,065 --> 01:10:32,328
This way I can tell him
what's going on.

892
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,866
And what are you gonna
write about today?

893
01:10:36,471 --> 01:10:38,336
Besides the war being over?

894
01:10:38,506 --> 01:10:39,768
Yeah.

895
01:10:41,676 --> 01:10:45,338
Well, I met this girl.

896
01:10:49,049 --> 01:10:51,176
Did I just kiss you up there?

897
01:10:58,624 --> 01:11:02,116
You gotta bring your heads in out
of the clouds. Out of the clouds.

898
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:06,992
Keep the muttering to a minimum,
please, gentlemen.

899
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,567
Some of you dancing...

900
01:11:11,736 --> 01:11:13,829
...close together.

901
01:11:14,005 --> 01:11:17,998
I don't like the look of it.

902
01:11:18,576 --> 01:11:23,673
There are...bosoms in the area.

903
01:11:24,982 --> 01:11:28,816
And this could lead to pregnancy.

904
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,914
Any man getting caught out of hand
or getting caught in hand

905
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:36,115
will have to turn their peckers
over to the FBI.

906
01:11:44,499 --> 01:11:47,662
They're having fun. That's nice.
They're entitled.

907
01:11:49,037 --> 01:11:52,006
- So long as they don't think it's over.
- Isn't it?

908
01:11:53,675 --> 01:11:56,040
I mean,
what's all the celebration for?

909
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:59,911
Perhaps we can find
some other use for this work.

910
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:01,309
Fascism's dead.

911
01:12:01,482 --> 01:12:03,211
You mean in Europe.

912
01:12:03,384 --> 01:12:06,478
What do they think Japan
is doing, shooting squirrels?

913
01:12:06,654 --> 01:12:10,316
No, they're not shooting squirrels,
and that's not the issue.

914
01:12:11,057 --> 01:12:12,490
What is the issue?

915
01:12:13,393 --> 01:12:17,090
They don't have the technology.
They're not capable of it.

916
01:12:17,264 --> 01:12:19,254
So if we don't need it...

917
01:12:19,431 --> 01:12:20,830
...why make it?

918
01:12:22,001 --> 01:12:23,832
I want you to look at something.

919
01:12:24,703 --> 01:12:28,571
It's the largest collection
of nothing in the entire world.

920
01:12:30,509 --> 01:12:32,373
Make them work...

921
01:12:34,012 --> 01:12:35,741
...and you've got something.

922
01:12:36,514 --> 01:12:38,675
An irresistible something.

923
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:40,545
Just the threat...

924
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,882
...and they're ours.

925
01:12:45,856 --> 01:12:48,086
You know, sometimes,

926
01:12:48,258 --> 01:12:49,885
just standing here,

927
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:51,994
I keep wondering.

928
01:12:52,596 --> 01:12:55,962
Are we working on them
or are they working on us?

929
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:01,436
Give them dignity, doctor.
Then we can start talking...

930
01:13:02,505 --> 01:13:04,439
...about who can do what...

931
01:13:06,943 --> 01:13:09,206
...and what they mean.

932
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:31,830
Oh, what time is it?

933
01:13:37,103 --> 01:13:41,631
Even when I sleep, it's like dogs
tearing at a piece of meat.

934
01:13:43,109 --> 01:13:44,803
Robert?

935
01:13:46,511 --> 01:13:48,570
Thinking of resigning?

936
01:13:48,747 --> 01:13:50,510
No.

937
01:13:53,352 --> 01:13:55,149
I'd be written off.

938
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:58,948
They wouldn't understand.
Not in the present climate.

939
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:06,061
I keep obsessing about the device.

940
01:14:06,764 --> 01:14:09,891
Yes, it's true, but...

941
01:14:12,235 --> 01:14:14,260
...if you think beyond...

942
01:14:15,572 --> 01:14:19,235
...it's a limitless supply of energy.
Think about it, Kitty.

943
01:14:20,109 --> 01:14:22,907
The power that drives the universe.

944
01:14:25,881 --> 01:14:28,111
It's beyond imagination, really.

945
01:14:28,283 --> 01:14:29,944
And we'd have tamed it.

946
01:14:32,553 --> 01:14:34,350
A new world.

947
01:14:43,864 --> 01:14:45,331
Go get them, cowboy.

948
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,274
What's going on over there?

949
01:15:02,448 --> 01:15:06,316
Cattle destroyed the entire ground
cable run. Ruined two days' work.

950
01:15:08,853 --> 01:15:13,153
Why didn't they herd them outside
the site? Anyone suggest that?

951
01:15:13,324 --> 01:15:18,227
The ranchers wouldn't move them.
Seems the Army stopped negotiating.

952
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,797
- This is out of control.
- Edward, these estimates...

953
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:29,996
Rush, push, speed, deadlines.

954
01:15:30,174 --> 01:15:32,971
This whole project
has gotten out of control.

955
01:15:33,142 --> 01:15:36,236
We haven't thought about
the consequences, Oppie.

956
01:15:36,412 --> 01:15:38,073
- Oppie?
- Wilson!

957
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:41,148
We've been waiting
for the data for two weeks.

958
01:15:41,317 --> 01:15:43,342
When are we gonna get it?

959
01:15:46,888 --> 01:15:48,651
Wilson is correct.

960
01:15:48,824 --> 01:15:52,282
We have to talk about what we're
all thinking but not saying.

961
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:55,691
This argument is arcane, Edward.

962
01:15:55,863 --> 01:15:57,728
This thing is becoming real.

963
01:15:57,898 --> 01:16:01,459
It's going to affect lives,
thousands of lives.

964
01:16:01,635 --> 01:16:03,762
We have to start to talk.

965
01:16:03,938 --> 01:16:06,771
All right. But not here.

966
01:16:07,441 --> 01:16:10,000
At my home tonight.

967
01:16:19,385 --> 01:16:22,012
<i>So now we tickle
the tail of the dragon.</i>

968
01:16:22,221 --> 01:16:24,052
All right, take her up.

969
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:28,726
<i>I can only hope the uranium
slug doesn't get stuck in the pile.</i>

970
01:16:28,894 --> 01:16:32,090
<i>If it does,
we'll probably all evaporate.</i>

971
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:35,264
- What's the reading?
- 1 .19-K.

972
01:16:37,702 --> 01:16:40,136
- Waiting on your word.
- Meter's ready.

973
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:41,635
Ready when you are.

974
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:45,802
Let's go.

975
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:47,375
OK, let's tickle it.

976
01:16:55,585 --> 01:16:57,449
It burst. It burst.

977
01:16:57,887 --> 01:16:59,855
It burst right from here.

978
01:17:00,623 --> 01:17:02,716
All right, add it up.

979
01:17:02,892 --> 01:17:04,553
Cigarette break.

980
01:17:05,094 --> 01:17:06,686
Good job.

981
01:17:16,838 --> 01:17:19,534
Michael. Hey, Michael.
You got a moment?

982
01:17:19,707 --> 01:17:22,971
They won't let me in this place.
Still going to Chicago?

983
01:17:23,177 --> 01:17:25,236
Yeah, Frisch can't pick the slugs up.

984
01:17:25,445 --> 01:17:29,313
Great. There's something we'd
like you to pick up, if you can.

985
01:17:29,483 --> 01:17:32,474
You know Leo Szilard, right?
And Ralph Lapp?

986
01:17:32,652 --> 01:17:35,815
Well, about 20 of our other
colleagues from Chicago,

987
01:17:35,988 --> 01:17:40,118
they're proposing a petition stating
they're opposed to the device.

988
01:17:41,394 --> 01:17:44,692
They're concerned about
what they think's gonna happen.

989
01:17:44,863 --> 01:17:50,062
So am I. I got a brother who's
in the Philippines right now.

990
01:17:50,235 --> 01:17:52,465
I read the papers. I'm concerned.

991
01:17:52,637 --> 01:17:56,538
I'm not asking you to endorse
anything. I haven't even read it yet.

992
01:17:57,208 --> 01:18:00,371
It should be discussed.
All I'm asking is pick it up,

993
01:18:00,544 --> 01:18:04,105
let us peruse it and make up
our own minds. How tough is that?

994
01:18:04,281 --> 01:18:06,442
- Makes sense.
- It's only fair.

995
01:18:06,617 --> 01:18:08,107
I'll pick it up for you.

996
01:18:08,952 --> 01:18:10,920
- See you later.
- OK.

997
01:18:12,822 --> 01:18:15,313
How can you rationalize
premeditated murder?

998
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:17,891
Oh, bullshit. Premeditated murder?

999
01:18:18,061 --> 01:18:21,029
- This is a war. It's about winning.
- At what cost?

1000
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,756
You can't just outlaw a weapon.

1001
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:26,901
The more effective,
the more likely it will be used.

1002
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:29,503
We didn't use poison gas.
That was stopped.

1003
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,730
You got to speak up.
The generals won't listen to us.

1004
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:37,377
Yeah, and speak up on behalf
of all those kids hiding in foxholes.

1005
01:18:37,545 --> 01:18:40,981
I know what they'd say. The
Japanese brought this on themselves.

1006
01:18:41,148 --> 01:18:42,979
They have themselves to blame.

1007
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:45,913
I wouldn't care if the place
went up in smoke...

1008
01:18:46,086 --> 01:18:48,452
Excuse me,
just for a minute, gentlemen.

1009
01:18:50,156 --> 01:18:52,386
And I resent your suggesting

1010
01:18:52,559 --> 01:18:54,584
I don't recognize a moral argument.

1011
01:18:54,761 --> 01:18:58,196
Why are you still awake?
Aren't you supposed to be sleeping?

1012
01:18:58,364 --> 01:19:02,494
- I don't like sleeping.
- There are lots of things we don't like.

1013
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:06,762
We have to do them if we
want to do the things we do like.

1014
01:19:06,972 --> 01:19:09,997
- What's the treat tomorrow?
- Go horseback riding.

1015
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:14,338
That's right. Now, how are you
going to ride a great big horse

1016
01:19:14,512 --> 01:19:16,503
if you don't get plenty of rest?

1017
01:19:16,681 --> 01:19:18,376
Go to sleep for Daddy?

1018
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:20,782
That's a good boy.

1019
01:19:28,425 --> 01:19:30,393
It is hot.

1020
01:19:30,894 --> 01:19:34,226
We could go to Carlucci's,
get some ice coffee and donuts.

1021
01:19:34,397 --> 01:19:36,456
The project is beginning to unravel.

1022
01:19:36,666 --> 01:19:39,328
- What?
- There have always been questions.

1023
01:19:39,535 --> 01:19:43,471
We've always avoided the answers.
Now, everything is coming to a head.

1024
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,134
- Bronson?
- Sir?

1025
01:19:46,308 --> 01:19:48,572
- Stop the car.
- Yes, sir.

1026
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:52,235
- Get out, take a leak or something.
- This is a public park.

1027
01:19:52,414 --> 01:19:55,815
Well, pick some flowers.
I want to do some shouting.

1028
01:20:04,792 --> 01:20:06,123
It's a crisis.

1029
01:20:06,293 --> 01:20:08,090
A crisis of conscience.

1030
01:20:10,063 --> 01:20:12,258
All right. I'm not shouting.

1031
01:20:13,066 --> 01:20:15,034
I'm not even angry.

1032
01:20:15,668 --> 01:20:17,966
I am just stumped.

1033
01:20:20,073 --> 01:20:22,302
You want to sit on your hands,

1034
01:20:22,474 --> 01:20:24,101
polish your conscience,

1035
01:20:24,276 --> 01:20:28,804
when we might be able to end
this whole thing with one shot?

1036
01:20:30,248 --> 01:20:32,045
Crisis of conscience, huh?

1037
01:20:32,217 --> 01:20:33,706
All right.

1038
01:20:33,884 --> 01:20:35,146
Have it.

1039
01:20:35,319 --> 01:20:36,980
Take a bath in it.

1040
01:20:37,154 --> 01:20:38,416
Soak in it.

1041
01:20:39,557 --> 01:20:42,424
Then tell me whether you're
going to deliver them.

1042
01:20:42,626 --> 01:20:45,116
Whether you're gonna finish this job.

1043
01:20:45,328 --> 01:20:49,697
You tell me how I'm gonna face
a senate inquiry

1044
01:20:49,866 --> 01:20:54,303
and say we spent two billion dollars
on a show that's never gonna open.

1045
01:20:55,305 --> 01:20:56,932
Crisis of conscience.

1046
01:20:57,106 --> 01:21:01,702
You got one job, doctor.
Give me the bomb. Just give it to me.

1047
01:21:02,111 --> 01:21:04,602
Atrocious things have been done
in Germany

1048
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:07,305
because people didn't speak out.

1049
01:21:07,483 --> 01:21:11,646
And we blame them for it. Right,
I think, even though it was dangerous.

1050
01:21:11,819 --> 01:21:14,583
But it's not dangerous
for us to speak out.

1051
01:21:14,756 --> 01:21:17,020
That's what a lot of us in Chicago feel.

1052
01:21:17,225 --> 01:21:20,661
You don't have to agree
with the contents of this petition.

1053
01:21:20,828 --> 01:21:23,193
You have to agree
it should be discussed.

1054
01:21:23,363 --> 01:21:25,558
- Yes, sir.
- Good boy, Michael.

1055
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,661
Good seeing you again.

1056
01:21:59,062 --> 01:22:00,859
- It came in on the wire.
- What?

1057
01:22:01,031 --> 01:22:05,195
Japanese are feeling out terms for
surrender. They made a proposition.

1058
01:22:05,369 --> 01:22:08,338
What kind of surrender?
Not unconditional?

1059
01:22:08,505 --> 01:22:10,438
Not according to my sources, no.

1060
01:22:10,606 --> 01:22:12,039
Good.

1061
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:14,108
No one will buy it.

1062
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:17,374
- Sir?
- Nothing.

1063
01:22:17,547 --> 01:22:20,710
Come on. Come on. Right here.

1064
01:22:22,818 --> 01:22:25,912
Mr. Secretary, a brutal question.

1065
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:28,752
Are you and the president

1066
01:22:28,924 --> 01:22:30,289
looking to Russia,

1067
01:22:30,459 --> 01:22:34,019
figuring they'll come into Japan,
assuming there's an invasion?

1068
01:22:34,195 --> 01:22:37,062
If you are, you're not
gonna get that for nothing.

1069
01:22:37,231 --> 01:22:40,667
Russia's gonna want
Manchuria, Sakhalin.

1070
01:22:41,168 --> 01:22:43,728
I can give the president Japan.

1071
01:22:44,972 --> 01:22:46,905
No invasion, no deals.

1072
01:22:47,273 --> 01:22:48,638
Can you guarantee that?

1073
01:22:48,808 --> 01:22:51,572
Some of your scientists
are getting out of line.

1074
01:22:51,744 --> 01:22:54,736
I hear they've been maneuvering
to see the president.

1075
01:22:54,914 --> 01:22:56,313
I didn't know that.

1076
01:22:56,883 --> 01:22:58,713
I will take care of it.

1077
01:22:58,917 --> 01:23:02,751
- Very well. Do that, general.
- Mr. Secretary.

1078
01:23:02,921 --> 01:23:04,684
Good night.

1079
01:23:07,826 --> 01:23:09,622
Panton?

1080
01:23:11,496 --> 01:23:12,963
Dr. Oppenheimer had...

1081
01:23:14,065 --> 01:23:18,627
...on three separate occasions,
meetings with suspected agents,

1082
01:23:18,803 --> 01:23:20,703
communists, whatever.

1083
01:23:20,872 --> 01:23:23,362
- He gave us one name, correct?
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,735
Press him on the others.

1085
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:29,838
- He needs to feel the branch creak.
- Yes, sir.

1086
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:32,014
- Ready?
- Yeah, we're ready.

1087
01:23:37,152 --> 01:23:40,019
They told me you were down here.
I was having lunch.

1088
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:43,386
I got a call from Captain Panton.
A security problem again.

1089
01:23:43,559 --> 01:23:46,425
Well, I'm being harassed,
and I'm sick of it.

1090
01:23:46,594 --> 01:23:49,563
I had a security clearance.
This was a dead issue.

1091
01:23:49,731 --> 01:23:52,564
It's never dead with you.

1092
01:23:52,734 --> 01:23:56,568
Though I will try to put a lid on it.
This is not gonna help.

1093
01:23:57,105 --> 01:23:59,800
- What's this?
- Some kind of petition

1094
01:23:59,973 --> 01:24:04,740
from your boys in Chicago trying to go
around us to see the president.

1095
01:24:05,212 --> 01:24:08,579
That will never happen.

1096
01:24:09,316 --> 01:24:11,681
Do you know about this?

1097
01:24:13,686 --> 01:24:15,620
About the ideas, yes.

1098
01:24:15,788 --> 01:24:19,019
They want to demonstrate
the device, not use it.

1099
01:24:19,191 --> 01:24:21,988
Is it containable?

1100
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,355
Can you stop it?

1101
01:24:27,165 --> 01:24:30,328
My hash is getting cold upstairs.

1102
01:24:30,502 --> 01:24:33,232
- Don't let these dodos distract you.
- How can...?

1103
01:24:33,405 --> 01:24:38,398
Robert, you are this far away
from being the man who won the war.

1104
01:24:38,609 --> 01:24:40,577
These are important people
in Chicago.

1105
01:24:40,778 --> 01:24:43,542
You can't ignore
what they have to say.

1106
01:24:43,714 --> 01:24:47,843
All they want is an opportunity
to talk about the demonstration.

1107
01:24:48,017 --> 01:24:51,578
- What's his name? Szilard.
- Szilard.

1108
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:53,517
Sitting in the bathtub.

1109
01:24:53,690 --> 01:24:57,751
I should have drowned that
son of a bitch the first day I met him.

1110
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:02,360
What's wrong with demonstrating?
What's wrong with not killing?

1111
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:04,499
You vaporize some uninhabited atoll.

1112
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:07,396
Set terms of surrender,
then send the Japanese home.

1113
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:10,827
It's mush. It won't work.

1114
01:25:11,038 --> 01:25:14,132
They are kamikazes, all of them.

1115
01:25:16,777 --> 01:25:19,473
You had money in your background.
That explains it.

1116
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:21,740
- What does that mean?
- Your optimism.

1117
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:26,079
Faith in human nature.
I never had any. Money, that is.

1118
01:25:26,252 --> 01:25:29,983
Never had a permanent house.
Made me a realist.

1119
01:25:33,026 --> 01:25:35,289
The idea should go to the president.

1120
01:25:37,062 --> 01:25:39,963
Where do you get these ideas?

1121
01:25:40,132 --> 01:25:42,623
You know, those boys in security...

1122
01:25:42,835 --> 01:25:45,804
...got a right to ask where
these ideas are coming from.

1123
01:25:46,504 --> 01:25:52,443
Demonstrations, stopping work,
sharing with other countries.

1124
01:25:53,044 --> 01:25:55,308
You're gonna have
a tough time proving

1125
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,448
that those ideas
are coming out of Chicago.

1126
01:25:58,615 --> 01:26:01,106
- They are foreign, subversive.
- They're moral.

1127
01:26:01,284 --> 01:26:03,616
- Moral?
- Moral.

1128
01:26:03,787 --> 01:26:06,347
Was Pearl Harbor moral?

1129
01:26:06,523 --> 01:26:08,548
Poland, Munich, moral?

1130
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:13,351
Death March of Bataan,
was that moral?

1131
01:26:13,529 --> 01:26:14,791
Junk!

1132
01:26:15,831 --> 01:26:18,493
Demonstration junk.

1133
01:26:18,701 --> 01:26:21,932
I say you show the enemy
in the harshest terms

1134
01:26:22,104 --> 01:26:27,040
that you can muster, that you play
in the same league that they do.

1135
01:26:27,942 --> 01:26:32,902
At that meeting tomorrow there's
gonna be a vote on this demonstration.

1136
01:26:33,081 --> 01:26:36,311
There's gonna be a recommendation
going to the president.

1137
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:38,007
Now, listen.

1138
01:26:38,752 --> 01:26:41,687
You can help yourself here.

1139
01:26:42,756 --> 01:26:45,486
Steer it in the right direction.

1140
01:26:46,592 --> 01:26:50,187
You're either for us or against us.
Ernest, how are you?

1141
01:26:50,396 --> 01:26:53,888
I'd like to introduce
Dr. Oppenheimer here.

1142
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:57,467
Well, rumor has it
that we might owe you

1143
01:26:57,637 --> 01:27:00,298
for shaking those yellow monkeys
out of the trees.

1144
01:27:00,472 --> 01:27:03,964
Save us a lot, not going to Japan.
My boys are gonna be grateful.

1145
01:27:04,142 --> 01:27:08,169
Yes, I'm pleased to shake
your hand. And thank you.

1146
01:27:08,346 --> 01:27:11,178
Doctor, I'd like to add my shake too.

1147
01:27:11,348 --> 01:27:13,475
Nice seeing you.

1148
01:27:17,254 --> 01:27:20,417
Did you hear what they said?

1149
01:27:20,591 --> 01:27:25,550
You keep this on the track,
and we are gonna owe you, soldier.

1150
01:28:09,503 --> 01:28:13,996
<i>''We are in a completely new situation
that cannot be resolved by war.</i>

1151
01:28:15,174 --> 01:28:18,109
<i>''A petition to the president
of the United States.</i>

1152
01:28:18,277 --> 01:28:20,711
<i>''Discoveries of which the people
are not aware</i>

1153
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,076
<i>''may affect the welfare
of this nation in the near future.''</i>

1154
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:28,280
The Russians are our allies.
If we drop this without telling them,

1155
01:28:28,453 --> 01:28:31,388
we could give them a paranoia
that will make us sick.

1156
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:36,117
The Japanese are on their knees.
All this kamikaze stuff is a load of bull.

1157
01:28:36,326 --> 01:28:41,161
They're wet-pants scared of us just
like we're wet-pants scared of them.

1158
01:28:41,331 --> 01:28:44,732
This war seems to have forced
a lot of guys on both sides

1159
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:47,495
to resign from the human race.

1160
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:51,106
- I hope we're not about to do that.
- I agree.

1161
01:28:51,607 --> 01:28:56,567
Our blockade will finish Japan
by autumn, maybe even sooner.

1162
01:28:56,746 --> 01:29:00,340
This device is not an honorable way
to win a war.

1163
01:29:00,482 --> 01:29:02,814
And I was taught to fight with honor.

1164
01:29:03,018 --> 01:29:05,077
If Custer...

1165
01:29:05,287 --> 01:29:07,687
...had used the machine-gun...

1166
01:29:07,856 --> 01:29:11,121
...his history would have been
written differently.

1167
01:29:12,893 --> 01:29:15,191
If you go ahead,

1168
01:29:15,362 --> 01:29:20,390
particularly, if you drop this thing
with no prior warning...

1169
01:29:20,568 --> 01:29:24,526
...l, for one, will have to
resign my commission.

1170
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,473
Perhaps you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

1171
01:29:36,748 --> 01:29:43,153
Incidentally, what is the opinion of
the committee on a demonstration?

1172
01:29:46,058 --> 01:29:48,821
Well, if we should agree
to a demonstration

1173
01:29:48,993 --> 01:29:50,984
with the attendant
Japanese observers

1174
01:29:51,162 --> 01:29:54,791
and that demonstration failed,

1175
01:29:54,966 --> 01:29:58,663
not only would we be unable
to induce the Japanese to surrender,

1176
01:29:58,836 --> 01:30:02,168
we would face a critical
shortage of material.

1177
01:30:04,875 --> 01:30:08,606
The dropping of the device
has always been implicit in this project.

1178
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:13,810
So that is the advice I shall
pass on to the president.

1179
01:30:14,016 --> 01:30:16,382
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, that's right.

1180
01:30:16,552 --> 01:30:18,417
Yes.

1181
01:30:59,858 --> 01:31:02,122
- Sam.
- Bob, welcome to Trinity.

1182
01:31:02,294 --> 01:31:04,125
- Here she is.
- Can I grab one?

1183
01:31:04,296 --> 01:31:06,321
- It's all right.
- Good trip?

1184
01:31:09,601 --> 01:31:11,932
- Are you the accountable officer?
- Yes.

1185
01:31:12,102 --> 01:31:14,093
- This will be for you.
- What's that?

1186
01:31:14,271 --> 01:31:17,172
It states that the University
of California hands over

1187
01:31:17,374 --> 01:31:20,775
a plutonium core of a nuclear device
to the United States Army.

1188
01:31:20,945 --> 01:31:25,381
Put more simply,
it's a bill for two billion dollars.

1189
01:31:27,684 --> 01:31:30,619
Now, let me show you
what else your money's bought.

1190
01:31:32,622 --> 01:31:34,715
The initiator.

1191
01:31:37,626 --> 01:31:40,026
And the other half.

1192
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:45,264
Now, all we gotta do
is throw them together and...

1193
01:31:48,502 --> 01:31:51,494
Well, let's begin final assembly.

1194
01:31:56,143 --> 01:31:58,611
OK, Mr. Merriman.

1195
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:13,087
Well, you're quiet.

1196
01:32:15,661 --> 01:32:18,994
It's coming close, what you're
working towards, isn't it?

1197
01:32:19,164 --> 01:32:21,325
Yeah.

1198
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:25,128
I can feel it pressing down
on everybody.

1199
01:32:25,336 --> 01:32:28,169
There's something going on here.

1200
01:32:29,874 --> 01:32:33,537
It's got everybody mesmerized,
doesn't it?

1201
01:32:33,711 --> 01:32:35,736
Yeah.

1202
01:32:35,913 --> 01:32:39,609
There's a regular run
on sleeping pills and aspirin.

1203
01:32:39,783 --> 01:32:43,344
And it's not just the work,
it's something else.

1204
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:50,921
- Look, I know you can't talk about it.
- I can't.

1205
01:32:51,093 --> 01:32:54,221
Well, then talk to Dr. Oppenheimer.

1206
01:32:54,397 --> 01:32:57,764
I mean, if anyone has,
he'll have thought it through, right?

1207
01:32:59,068 --> 01:33:00,728
OK.

1208
01:33:07,075 --> 01:33:09,305
Touch me.

1209
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:27,552
Naked.

1210
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:30,252
Isn't that a beautiful word?

1211
01:33:33,132 --> 01:33:35,600
Tonight.

1212
01:33:35,802 --> 01:33:38,326
I want to make love.

1213
01:33:41,306 --> 01:33:43,638
And I want a future.

1214
01:33:43,809 --> 01:33:46,437
That's what I really want...

1215
01:33:46,611 --> 01:33:48,908
...for you and me.

1216
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:51,412
So do I.

1217
01:33:53,851 --> 01:33:58,754
- Oh, for chrissake, George.
- This pitting, must be the mold.

1218
01:33:58,923 --> 01:34:01,482
I'm not an explosives expert,
but I've been called

1219
01:34:01,658 --> 01:34:03,819
to look at something
that's unacceptable.

1220
01:34:04,027 --> 01:34:05,392
We must use hand lathings.

1221
01:34:05,595 --> 01:34:07,927
You should have used hand
lathings before.

1222
01:34:08,098 --> 01:34:10,589
- Hand lathings, you know what it is?
- Yes.

1223
01:34:11,468 --> 01:34:15,597
- Michael, what are you doing here?
- Chicago, Leo Szilard.

1224
01:34:15,771 --> 01:34:18,433
I read it on the train.

1225
01:34:18,607 --> 01:34:22,407
- Well, what do you think about it?
- It unnerved me.

1226
01:34:23,946 --> 01:34:26,379
Are we gonna discuss this ever?

1227
01:34:26,547 --> 01:34:28,708
Amongst ourselves?

1228
01:34:29,484 --> 01:34:33,545
- Are we going on?
- I don't see anyone stopping.

1229
01:34:33,721 --> 01:34:36,917
Now, look, we've been asked
to solve a technical problem,

1230
01:34:37,124 --> 01:34:40,685
to build this device.
We're not responsible for its use.

1231
01:34:40,894 --> 01:34:44,227
Oppie, it's for you.

1232
01:34:44,397 --> 01:34:47,389
Peter's got revised figures.

1233
01:34:54,106 --> 01:34:57,974
Look, let me keep this paper.

1234
01:34:58,144 --> 01:35:02,102
We're expecting the initiator.
We need your lab results, all right?

1235
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,941
All right?

1236
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,049
All right.

1237
01:35:26,035 --> 01:35:27,798
Everybody ready?

1238
01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:29,801
- Meter's ready.
- Here we go.

1239
01:35:49,957 --> 01:35:52,016
Twenty-one.

1240
01:35:58,832 --> 01:36:00,766
Twenty-nine.

1241
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:12,805
Thirty-one.

1242
01:36:15,247 --> 01:36:17,044
Thirty-eight.

1243
01:36:18,183 --> 01:36:22,279
Got it? Forty.
Everybody back, right now.

1244
01:36:28,559 --> 01:36:30,151
Behind the wall.

1245
01:36:41,805 --> 01:36:43,466
Turn it off!

1246
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:53,281
Nobody move! Don't anybody move!

1247
01:36:57,219 --> 01:36:59,619
Damn it!

1248
01:36:59,788 --> 01:37:01,846
Take off everything metal. Drop it.

1249
01:37:02,023 --> 01:37:05,049
Mark the positions
you're standing in and get out.

1250
01:37:08,796 --> 01:37:10,320
The incident never happened.

1251
01:37:10,498 --> 01:37:13,489
If anyone should ask,
it did not happen.

1252
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:37,186
Everybody should make it.

1253
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:41,684
Except me.

1254
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:43,828
I'm dead.

1255
01:38:05,615 --> 01:38:08,413
Doctor! Doctor!
I've been looking all over for you.

1256
01:38:08,584 --> 01:38:11,144
We've got a problem.

1257
01:38:11,321 --> 01:38:12,583
- Bad allergy.
- When?

1258
01:38:12,755 --> 01:38:15,188
- An hour ago. They're bringing him in.
- Who?

1259
01:38:15,357 --> 01:38:16,619
Mr. Merriman.

1260
01:38:16,792 --> 01:38:18,487
- Michael?
- Yes, sir.

1261
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,628
Oh, shit.

1262
01:38:20,796 --> 01:38:22,991
Let's go.

1263
01:38:23,165 --> 01:38:26,065
- Come on, let's go!
- Yes, sir.

1264
01:38:33,007 --> 01:38:34,838
This one won't do.

1265
01:38:37,777 --> 01:38:41,508
- In here. This one's good.
- Take it easy. All right, all right.

1266
01:38:41,681 --> 01:38:45,117
- Michael, what's the matter?
- Nothing, everything's fine.

1267
01:38:45,919 --> 01:38:48,854
- Doctor, how much did he get?
- More than 1 ,000 rads.

1268
01:38:49,022 --> 01:38:50,818
- Goddamn it.
- What's happening?

1269
01:38:50,989 --> 01:38:54,550
Sweetheart, it's under control.
Everything's under control, OK?

1270
01:38:55,594 --> 01:38:58,392
- Steven, what's going on?
- You should not be here.

1271
01:38:58,564 --> 01:39:00,429
Excuse me, there's no patient here.

1272
01:39:00,566 --> 01:39:03,398
No one's to hear about this.
Not Oppenheimer. Nobody.

1273
01:39:03,601 --> 01:39:07,037
- OK?
- Goddamn it, what happened here?

1274
01:39:07,238 --> 01:39:09,468
I want this ward sealed off.
Come with me.

1275
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:12,404
I want military doctors in here.

1276
01:39:22,352 --> 01:39:24,411
Get the hell out of here!

1277
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:30,516
It's the detonation circuits.

1278
01:39:32,728 --> 01:39:36,630
I don't know.
I would like another 24 hours.

1279
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:39,800
I think so, but I can't be certain.

1280
01:39:40,001 --> 01:39:45,405
I said one more day.
I need one more day.

1281
01:39:46,608 --> 01:39:51,306
No, no, Merriman brought me
a copy from Chicago.

1282
01:39:52,179 --> 01:39:54,170
Some of the physicists
have signed it.

1283
01:39:54,348 --> 01:39:58,250
Pinko fruitcakes. Get that thing
to work, I'm gonna drop it on Chicago.

1284
01:39:58,419 --> 01:40:00,944
I swear I will.

1285
01:40:01,121 --> 01:40:06,217
Yes, I hear you. You hear me?
Finish the damn thing. That's an order.

1286
01:40:08,027 --> 01:40:11,622
Well, I got other business.

1287
01:40:11,831 --> 01:40:14,390
But I got a plane. I'll be there.

1288
01:40:14,599 --> 01:40:17,193
Every time I turn around,
somebody gets to him.

1289
01:40:17,402 --> 01:40:20,371
Now they're talking about postponing.

1290
01:40:25,243 --> 01:40:29,042
- Cleared for Washington?
- Yes, sir. We are.

1291
01:40:33,451 --> 01:40:36,852
''Truman, Stimson arrive Potsdam
for conference with Stalin.

1292
01:40:37,021 --> 01:40:39,284
''Advise results of Trinity Test soonest.''

1293
01:40:39,456 --> 01:40:42,016
Stalin's gonna eat Truman alive
at this meeting.

1294
01:40:42,192 --> 01:40:44,786
- Unless we...
- Yes, unless...

1295
01:40:44,994 --> 01:40:48,555
...we give the president something
lethal to stick in his back pocket.

1296
01:40:48,765 --> 01:40:52,962
I'll tell you something
it won't be...postponement.

1297
01:40:59,708 --> 01:41:03,803
Oh, Lord...so close.

1298
01:41:06,714 --> 01:41:08,341
Sir.

1299
01:41:53,056 --> 01:41:56,992
Keep going down slow.

1300
01:42:00,397 --> 01:42:03,661
His heart looks larger. Could be
fluid in the pericardial sac.

1301
01:42:03,833 --> 01:42:05,528
- Radiation induced?
- Probably.

1302
01:42:05,701 --> 01:42:07,999
It's almost doubled in size overnight.

1303
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:10,661
If this continues, his heart will drown.

1304
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:13,206
- Is he lucid?
- In and out.

1305
01:42:13,376 --> 01:42:17,072
There's tremendous brain swelling
from the radiation.

1306
01:42:17,245 --> 01:42:21,807
- What happens next?
- I don't know. I mean, I have no idea.

1307
01:42:21,983 --> 01:42:25,350
No human being's ever gotten
this dose of radiation before.

1308
01:42:25,554 --> 01:42:27,316
He's dying from the inside out.

1309
01:42:27,521 --> 01:42:32,049
Other problems. His gastrointestinal
tract has been destroyed by radiation.

1310
01:42:32,259 --> 01:42:34,523
Excuse me, doctors.

1311
01:42:40,166 --> 01:42:43,260
You've got to believe
we're doing everything we know how.

1312
01:42:43,436 --> 01:42:44,869
Absolutely everything.

1313
01:42:45,038 --> 01:42:48,701
It's not gonna do any good
to have you ripping yourself apart.

1314
01:42:48,875 --> 01:42:52,537
- You've gotta go home and sleep.
- Richard, I can't.

1315
01:43:51,632 --> 01:43:53,031
- Some orange.
- Sure is.

1316
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:54,667
Hey, Oppie?

1317
01:44:08,614 --> 01:44:10,081
Look out!

1318
01:44:12,385 --> 01:44:14,046
Hornig?

1319
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:16,483
- Hornig?
- It's all right.

1320
01:44:16,655 --> 01:44:18,589
The other safety's holding.

1321
01:44:21,426 --> 01:44:24,293
Does anybody else need a martini?

1322
01:44:27,164 --> 01:44:29,894
- What's the word?
- Oppie, it doesn't look good.

1323
01:44:30,067 --> 01:44:35,027
We have a chance of thunderstorms
over the next five days. I'm sorry.

1324
01:44:36,607 --> 01:44:39,473
I'm not telling you
what this guy's got up there.

1325
01:44:59,828 --> 01:45:01,762
- Why wasn't I told?
- Too much panic.

1326
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:03,920
- How is he?
- Difficult to tell.

1327
01:45:04,098 --> 01:45:06,566
- I'd like to see him.
- We're not permitting visits.

1328
01:45:06,734 --> 01:45:09,362
But the men who were
with him have been spoken to.

1329
01:45:09,537 --> 01:45:11,801
Security. Delicate time.

1330
01:45:12,006 --> 01:45:15,134
He's a strong young man.
He'll pull through.

1331
01:45:16,376 --> 01:45:18,708
Schoenfield, how is he?

1332
01:45:18,878 --> 01:45:21,938
- Is he conscious?
- He's in and out.

1333
01:45:22,115 --> 01:45:24,515
He wants to know
if you read the petition.

1334
01:45:24,684 --> 01:45:28,710
- It means a lot to him.
- Yes, I have.

1335
01:45:28,887 --> 01:45:31,879
And then, that's it? That's all?

1336
01:45:32,057 --> 01:45:34,924
Yes, I have and then now
I wash my hands of it?

1337
01:45:35,094 --> 01:45:36,755
Now wait a minute, Oppenheimer.

1338
01:45:36,929 --> 01:45:39,897
I got a friend falling apart
who thinks you got the answers.

1339
01:45:40,064 --> 01:45:41,691
That's what you let him think.

1340
01:45:41,866 --> 01:45:46,030
Do you know what the Christ is going
on, or is the whole thing out of control?

1341
01:45:46,237 --> 01:45:48,637
If you're trying to make a point,
what is it?

1342
01:45:48,806 --> 01:45:51,797
I have spent the last
two years of my life

1343
01:45:52,008 --> 01:45:56,502
putting up with all your security
and your secrecy and your control.

1344
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:59,672
I don't think that bullshit
was to keep what was going on

1345
01:45:59,850 --> 01:46:02,614
from the Germans
or the Japanese or the Russians.

1346
01:46:02,786 --> 01:46:05,185
It's to keep it from
American Jacks and Jills

1347
01:46:05,354 --> 01:46:07,584
because they may not
like what's going on.

1348
01:46:07,757 --> 01:46:10,658
American people don't
want to know what's going on.

1349
01:46:10,826 --> 01:46:13,226
They want to know
that their sons are alive.

1350
01:46:13,395 --> 01:46:16,227
I'm doing everything in my power
to see that they do.

1351
01:46:16,664 --> 01:46:19,292
Like Oak Ridge, where they're
injecting ill and old

1352
01:46:19,501 --> 01:46:21,833
people with huge doses of plutonium?

1353
01:46:22,003 --> 01:46:24,733
I don't know about Oak Ridge,
but if you want to ask

1354
01:46:24,906 --> 01:46:27,874
what's happening, ask this:
Will it be big enough?

1355
01:46:28,408 --> 01:46:31,707
Big enough to scare all of us
and make us stop and think?

1356
01:46:31,879 --> 01:46:35,906
Big enough to stop all war forever?
You want to ask a question, ask that.

1357
01:46:36,083 --> 01:46:39,382
Look, I've seen Oak Ridge, all right?

1358
01:46:39,553 --> 01:46:42,578
That place wasn't built
to make one or two bombs.

1359
01:46:42,755 --> 01:46:46,122
It was built to make
thousands of them. Thousands.

1360
01:46:46,292 --> 01:46:49,022
And soon everybody's
gonna have a bomb. They will.

1361
01:46:49,195 --> 01:46:52,960
What do they do with them?
Sit and wait till they go off, until ''boom''?

1362
01:46:53,165 --> 01:46:55,759
Then we got one world
full of Michael Merrimans

1363
01:46:55,967 --> 01:46:59,334
dying from the inside out.
Is that what you're looking for?

1364
01:46:59,504 --> 01:47:03,099
Because that's the future
you've made for us.

1365
01:47:03,908 --> 01:47:08,072
Hey, Oppenheimer! Oppenheimer,
you ought to stop playing God

1366
01:47:08,245 --> 01:47:12,705
because you are not good at it
and the position is taken.

1367
01:47:24,127 --> 01:47:28,392
His pressure's falling fast.
You've got to get that fluid out now.

1368
01:47:33,001 --> 01:47:34,935
Needle, Michael.

1369
01:47:35,904 --> 01:47:38,805
OK, you're in. Start to pull it back.

1370
01:47:38,974 --> 01:47:40,941
Hang in, Michael.

1371
01:47:43,044 --> 01:47:44,944
Hang in, pal.

1372
01:47:46,214 --> 01:47:48,444
Come on, doc.

1373
01:47:49,951 --> 01:47:53,386
Pressure's starting to rise.
It's coming up slowly.

1374
01:48:13,339 --> 01:48:17,365
- Robert, you have to get some sleep.
- God.

1375
01:48:17,542 --> 01:48:20,136
I'm in a dark place.

1376
01:48:21,312 --> 01:48:24,179
We've all cooked this stew.

1377
01:48:24,349 --> 01:48:31,277
The Germans and the Japanese
and the Americans and the Brits.

1378
01:48:32,122 --> 01:48:35,751
It's an ugliness that goes back.
It goes way back.

1379
01:48:36,526 --> 01:48:39,495
I'm not a scientist anymore.

1380
01:48:40,429 --> 01:48:44,490
I'm a goddamn functionary.

1381
01:48:45,735 --> 01:48:48,636
I've got to stay in control.

1382
01:48:48,804 --> 01:48:51,705
I've got to control who gets this thing.

1383
01:48:52,607 --> 01:48:56,771
Power and control,
it's all I ever hear about anymore.

1384
01:48:57,812 --> 01:49:00,372
Doesn't life matter to you?

1385
01:49:00,482 --> 01:49:02,973
What about love and understanding?

1386
01:49:03,184 --> 01:49:06,675
I thought that's what science
was all about.

1387
01:49:06,887 --> 01:49:09,856
I just wanted us to work.

1388
01:49:10,057 --> 01:49:14,994
Does everything have to be
sacrificed to this...thing?

1389
01:49:17,163 --> 01:49:19,688
I put up with...

1390
01:49:23,036 --> 01:49:25,436
...Jean,

1391
01:49:25,605 --> 01:49:28,801
because I thought you needed her.

1392
01:49:30,842 --> 01:49:33,310
And I thought you'd give
her up because of me.

1393
01:49:35,047 --> 01:49:37,880
But she didn't count.

1394
01:49:38,083 --> 01:49:44,920
I don't count. Nothing counts for you
anymore except this damn bomb.

1395
01:49:45,589 --> 01:49:48,057
That's what it is.

1396
01:49:48,225 --> 01:49:51,524
But it's not your only creation.

1397
01:49:51,696 --> 01:49:54,323
There are the children.

1398
01:49:55,765 --> 01:50:00,634
And you need my love and support.
I know.

1399
01:50:01,538 --> 01:50:03,631
I don't...

1400
01:50:03,807 --> 01:50:06,775
I don't know where it is.

1401
01:50:07,076 --> 01:50:09,374
Why me?

1402
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:14,271
Why did he pick me?

1403
01:50:37,371 --> 01:50:39,396
- Panton!
- Sir?

1404
01:50:39,573 --> 01:50:43,269
Security's a mess. Nobody at
the checkpoint. Nobody up here.

1405
01:50:43,476 --> 01:50:46,274
- What do you think this is, a beach?
- No, sir.

1406
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:49,414
We've got to call a halt.
The weather is unpredictable.

1407
01:50:49,582 --> 01:50:52,073
We are not calling a halt
on account of weather.

1408
01:50:52,284 --> 01:50:55,980
With the wind we could send
radioactive junk all the way to Amarillo.

1409
01:50:56,154 --> 01:50:59,920
<i>You The New York Times reporter?
I want three reports.</i>

1410
01:51:00,091 --> 01:51:03,356
One if we succeed, one if we fail
and one if we disintegrate.

1411
01:51:03,528 --> 01:51:07,327
With the wind blowing this direction,
Amarillo could get a fallout.

1412
01:51:07,498 --> 01:51:09,989
- Fermi's right.
- No, I'm saying no.

1413
01:51:10,167 --> 01:51:13,466
The decision is mine!

1414
01:51:13,637 --> 01:51:15,628
- Do you understand?
- We can't do it.

1415
01:51:15,806 --> 01:51:19,104
We go ahead with this. Sergeant,
do something about that dog.

1416
01:51:19,308 --> 01:51:21,902
You sound like you're planning
a railway schedule.

1417
01:51:22,111 --> 01:51:25,740
No, you are trying to uninvent this.

1418
01:51:26,049 --> 01:51:27,482
I can do it without you.

1419
01:51:27,650 --> 01:51:33,281
Well, if you do and I've said no
and something goes wrong...

1420
01:51:34,990 --> 01:51:36,685
Get in the car.

1421
01:51:36,858 --> 01:51:39,190
Hurry up.
What are you waiting on?

1422
01:52:04,617 --> 01:52:08,552
Sir, it looks like it's clearing up.

1423
01:52:28,973 --> 01:52:33,375
You know, you build to a moment,

1424
01:52:33,543 --> 01:52:37,206
and then you grab it,
or it will go right by you.

1425
01:52:38,748 --> 01:52:42,148
You always thought that
I would do this, didn't you?

1426
01:52:42,318 --> 01:52:44,912
Can you buck your own nature?

1427
01:52:47,323 --> 01:52:49,814
What will it be like?

1428
01:52:52,094 --> 01:52:54,561
Unimaginable.

1429
01:52:56,965 --> 01:52:59,263
It's your baby.

1430
01:53:09,843 --> 01:53:12,107
Do it.

1431
01:53:13,914 --> 01:53:15,541
Hallelujah.

1432
01:53:15,916 --> 01:53:18,679
He said it's a go.

1433
01:53:18,851 --> 01:53:20,842
Let's go.

1434
01:53:21,287 --> 01:53:24,848
Start the countdown.
Come on. It's a go.

1435
01:53:25,024 --> 01:53:28,516
- Let's go! Move it out!
- Wilson, wake up!

1436
01:53:28,694 --> 01:53:32,754
- Wake up the dragon.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1437
01:53:48,445 --> 01:53:50,174
Power on.

1438
01:53:50,648 --> 01:53:53,946
- Power on.
- Synchronization relays one open.

1439
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:56,215
Synchronization relay one open.

1440
01:53:56,386 --> 01:54:01,881
- Synchronization relays two open.
- Synchronization relays two open.

1441
01:54:18,539 --> 01:54:21,099
I love you, Michael.

1442
01:54:28,216 --> 01:54:30,376
Easy.

1443
01:54:31,952 --> 01:54:34,284
Breathe easy.

1444
01:54:51,237 --> 01:54:53,569
Easy.

1445
01:54:54,572 --> 01:54:57,063
Easy, come back to the ice.

1446
01:54:59,911 --> 01:55:02,971
It's OK, here's the ice.

1447
01:55:09,186 --> 01:55:12,519
Kathleen, what are you doing in here?

1448
01:55:12,723 --> 01:55:15,385
Kathleen? God!

1449
01:55:15,592 --> 01:55:18,025
Come on, come on, sweetheart.

1450
01:55:19,562 --> 01:55:23,464
- You simply can't be here, sweetheart.
- I had to be with him.

1451
01:55:23,633 --> 01:55:28,002
I wanted to tell him I love him,
because he's going to die.

1452
01:55:33,775 --> 01:55:35,436
Detonation relays four open.

1453
01:55:38,947 --> 01:55:41,745
Well, it's armed.

1454
01:55:41,916 --> 01:55:45,715
- Now it's up to the bunker.
- Let's get down from here.

1455
01:55:53,060 --> 01:56:00,158
Well, I've always believed
that the Lord was on our side.

1456
01:56:00,333 --> 01:56:03,029
And I think now we're gonna prove it.

1457
01:56:43,138 --> 01:56:47,165
- Must be from the military base.
- Enrico, what do you bet on the yield?

1458
01:56:47,343 --> 01:56:49,709
I bet we set fire to the atmosphere.

1459
01:56:49,878 --> 01:56:52,244
If we're lucky,
we only wipe out New Mexico.

1460
01:56:52,448 --> 01:56:57,885
If we can ignite the air,
we finish off the planet. Any takers?

1461
01:56:58,286 --> 01:57:01,255
I kind of hope the damn thing
doesn't go off.

1462
01:57:02,523 --> 01:57:04,252
What the hell is that?

1463
01:57:04,726 --> 01:57:07,694
<i>It's The Nutcracker Suite.</i>

1464
01:57:08,562 --> 01:57:10,427
I can't get rid of it.

1465
01:57:11,098 --> 01:57:13,498
- Go to six-five.
- Six-five.

1466
01:57:14,534 --> 01:57:17,094
- OK, try seven.
- Seven.

1467
01:57:17,738 --> 01:57:19,796
Charging the device.

1468
01:57:28,681 --> 01:57:31,046
Robert, over here.

1469
01:57:36,888 --> 01:57:39,516
The device is fully charged.

1470
01:57:40,024 --> 01:57:43,959
It is now zero minus 60 seconds.
Fifty-nine, 58,

1473
01:57:48,132 --> 01:57:54,503
- 53, 52, 51 , 50, 49...
- Where is that music coming from?

1474
01:57:54,670 --> 01:57:57,571
It's a ground channel.
I can't get rid of it.

1475
01:57:57,774 --> 01:58:02,768
44, 43, 42, 41 , 40...

1476
01:58:02,979 --> 01:58:05,277
Goddamn music.

1477
01:58:05,448 --> 01:58:13,218
37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31 , 30,

four, three, two, one, zero.

1485
02:01:16,089 --> 02:01:19,990
<i>Kathleen, my love.
You asked me a question once.</i>

1486
02:01:20,159 --> 02:01:23,128
<i>Was it instinct to save a life
or to take it?</i>

1487
02:01:23,295 --> 02:01:25,263
<i>Well, I don't know, my darling.</i>

1488
02:01:25,497 --> 02:01:29,558
<i>All I do know is that
if we are free to choose,</i>

1489
02:01:29,735 --> 02:01:32,635
<i>I hope to God
we choose life over death.</i>

1490
02:01:33,371 --> 02:01:37,171
<i>Not because I believe the implacable
universe cares a damn,</i>

1491
02:01:37,508 --> 02:01:40,568
<i>but because as I look at you,
my darling,</i>

1492
02:01:40,745 --> 02:01:42,975
<i>I realize how glorious,</i>

<i>how magical life can be.</i>
