1
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,051
Boy, those Japs better watch out
for you, sir. Good luck.

2
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:04,518
The Corps of Engineers
is gonna miss you, sir.

3
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,266
- Thank you, gentlemen. Bronson.
- Sir.

4
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:10,591
I built this place,
so I'll be glad to eat it.

5
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:15,815
Well done, sir.

6
00:02:16,232 --> 00:02:18,435
You're a lucky man.
Give those Japs hell.

7
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,422
Thank you, Thomas.

8
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:22,820
Indeed, I will.

9
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:28,578
Sir!

10
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:31,613
I'm losing my chance
to get out from behind a desk

11
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:35,581
- and lead men in combat!
- Colonel Groves, forget it. This has...

12
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:38,020
Even Bronson
wants to head for the front.

13
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:40,519
Forget about the front.
You're an engineer.

14
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,362
You're gonna fight your war here.

15
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:48,066
Is this what you're assigning me to,
this boondoggle? Dead end?

16
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:51,841
This dead end, Groves, has the
personal backing of the president.

17
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:54,822
This is not what I was promised,
not what I expected.

18
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:58,366
Then bone up on it.
Head to Chicago, talk to the scientist.

19
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:00,511
If it looks possible, run with it.

20
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,771
Take whoever you want. Have
whatever you need. Just make it work.

21
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:07,837
Who knows, you might just win
this war on your own.

22
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,528
Pick up a star on the way.

23
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:45,508
<i>...fighting for, and they are reported
to be giving the Germans hell.</i>

24
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:49,632
<i>Though these losses represent the
most serious setbacks for the Allies</i>

25
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:51,719
<i>in this war
against the Nazi enemy.</i>

26
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:55,873
<i>Bad news, too,
from the war in the Pacific.</i>

27
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,868
<i>We have just had confirmation of
the sinking of three US cruisers.</i>

28
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,756
<i>Names are being withheld.
The casualties are high.</i>

29
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,349
Come in!

30
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,741
<i>Reports of an early-morning raid
by Japanese dive-bombers...</i>

31
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,352
In here.
In here!

32
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,236
- Szard?
- Szilard.

33
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:19,011
General Groves, I was expecting you.
Come in! Come in!

34
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:32,482
Forgive me.
Sometimes I get stuck in here.

35
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:34,588
Metaphorically.

36
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,515
I've read this.

37
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:39,810
- Is it possible?
- You couldn't put a little more hot in,

38
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:41,568
could you?

39
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:54,432
And I'm not very good at fairy tales,
so just give me the happy ending.

40
00:04:56,711 --> 00:05:00,388
What I wrote is possible,
probably inevitable.

41
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:05,475
Separate uranium 235,
then arrange for two portions

42
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,948
of the element to be brought together
suddenly, so that the resulting mass,

43
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,126
no bigger than this, general,

44
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:15,907
undergoes a spontaneous
self-generating reaction.

45
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:20,578
And if this was the epicenter
of that explosion...

46
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:26,148
...all of Chicago you could see
from here would disintegrate.

47
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:28,550
Hallelujah.

48
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:33,444
At the moment, all we have
are theories, concepts, inspirations,

49
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:36,902
- inconclusive results...
- Now, if we can make this device,

50
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:39,070
- so can the Krauts.
- Yes.

51
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,540
Germany has the scientific capability.

52
00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:45,183
And, general,
we need leadership here.

53
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,811
- I can help!
- Thank you.

54
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:48,805
You need an ally, general!

55
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:58,627
- So tell us about this general.
- Why?

56
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:01,340
Because it's so mysterious.

57
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,812
''Meet me in the middle
of God-knows-where.

58
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:09,212
''Be there no earlier than 4:20,
no later than 4:29.''

59
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:11,292
Well, word has it

60
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,285
he's a provincial windbag

61
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:16,861
who's spent most of his life
digging holes in Latin America.

62
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,745
- Graves for the natives, no doubt.
- Oh, Frank.

63
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,627
Seriously, Kitty, after all,
Robert's a scientist.

64
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,790
If the Army wants him,
they'll want all of him.

65
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,610
All of him?
Why not take all of him?

66
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,653
Look, I have to at least hear
what he has to offer.

67
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:34,662
- Robert, must we go so fast?
- Yes!

68
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,595
- It's crazy.
- Yes! Yes!

69
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:48,483
This way, Dr. Oppenheimer.

70
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:12,989
Doctor!

71
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:14,751
Up here!

72
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:19,389
Groves, Leslie. Friends call me Dick.
Sit down.

73
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:23,260
Ingenuity.

74
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:27,489
I love it.
Created out of nothing but up here.

75
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:29,247
Clear!

76
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:37,057
The old man likes his privacy,
doesn't he?

77
00:07:56,614 --> 00:07:58,437
Guess what.

78
00:07:58,597 --> 00:08:03,300
- The egghead wants a carrot juice.
- Get him what he wants, Bronson!

79
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:04,670
Get used to it.

80
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:07,837
What an eight ball this guy is.

81
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:11,843
Seems this Oppenheimer's
a hot number.

82
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:15,170
Says here, he's got more damn brains
than are decent.

83
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:19,424
He knows it too. Temperamental. He
ain't gonna be an easy horse to corral.

84
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,655
Oh, I think the general
knows what he's doing.

85
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,801
Oppenheimer ain't one of us.

86
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:27,933
The general picks that guy,
he'll be making a mistake.

87
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:36,067
It needs to get pulled together.

88
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,237
So I think you're the man for the job.

89
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:47,870
And I got a weakness for good men.

90
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:53,563
The Krauts are working on this,
full bore.

91
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,930
If they get it before we do,
I don't have to spell it out.

92
00:08:57,094 --> 00:08:59,036
Where would you start?

93
00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:00,827
Focus.

94
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:04,515
You have great minds,
but all dancing to a different tune.

95
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,637
You bring them together in one place,
isolate them, no distractions.

96
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:11,292
You create an atmosphere
of creative stress.

97
00:09:11,493 --> 00:09:14,428
Everyone competing
to solve one problem.

98
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:16,352
And you have one ringmaster.

99
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:21,440
Right now, it's all over the place.
You centralize everything.

100
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:23,459
There is a hitch.

101
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:26,937
There are people out there
don't like the color of your politics.

102
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,247
My politics...

103
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:31,235
...are an open book.

104
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:35,098
Well, I hope so.

105
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:39,011
You could win a war
and the Nobel Prize, God willing.

106
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:42,337
Sir, Major de Silva
wanted me to remind you

107
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,899
you've got a train to catch
at 1800 hours.

108
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,035
No rest for the wicked.

109
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:51,235
Oh, doctor.

110
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:57,410
If you take this on,
I say this in all humility, intellect...

111
00:09:58,213 --> 00:10:00,035
...don't outrank that.

112
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:06,076
This general is a meatball,
a cipher.

113
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:09,212
He'd be eating out of the palm
of my hand in a week.

114
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:11,290
So will you accept?

115
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,917
There are questions.
There are a kaleidoscope of questions.

116
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,311
I see.

117
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:25,630
Well, I'm a star
at breakfast small talk.

118
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:29,888
You'll have to save some for evenings if
you're gonna be wife of the big cheese.

119
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:32,540
Would this mean moving?

120
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:35,997
Oh, you have to say yes.

121
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:38,554
You're too brilliant for Berkeley.

122
00:10:38,724 --> 00:10:45,315
<i>Michelangelo's The Creation
of Adam. Origin and destiny.</i>

123
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:49,507
Origins and destiny.

124
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:52,929
The struggle to unearth the one
and to discover the other.

125
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:54,849
That is science!

126
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:58,176
And as I leave here
to unravel my own small destiny,

127
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:01,603
I congratulate each of you
on being the best of the best.

128
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:03,587
I have faith in you all.

129
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:08,026
God keep you, and may your lives
be rich and sweet.

130
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:10,171
- Thank you.
- We'll miss you, Oppie!

131
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,096
We'll miss you, Oppie!

132
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,148
Good luck, Oppie!

133
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:39,267
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!

134
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,496
Let's move that thing out back.

135
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,947
Sir!

136
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:26,211
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Give me the good news, Jack.

137
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:28,608
We've got utilities on
throughout camp.

138
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:32,568
We've got the sewage problem taken
care of. We have water throughout.

139
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,610
- Got the two science buildings...
- Not good enough.

140
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,950
We gotta be
a couple of weeks behind.

141
00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:40,766
You know, I got a bunch
of scientists up there.

142
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:43,549
They're just wandering,
bumping into each other.

143
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:47,163
Get some bodies in here. In a week,
I wanna be two weeks ahead.

144
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,535
I don't think we have
accommodations, sir.

145
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:51,609
Why would they want
accommodations?

146
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,056
You think they'll sleep?

147
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,817
All right, get some tents,
but put it on your EOR.

148
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:01,121
Didn't I ask for dogs
around that perimeter fence?

149
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:02,910
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see any.

150
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,766
They're coming, general.

151
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:12,794
So...

152
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:17,852
...whatever goes on around here
is privileged information.

153
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:24,096
No exceptions. No wives, no barbers.
No exceptions!

154
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,659
What you see,

155
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:31,704
what you hear, what you read,
what you dream about,

156
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:33,794
whatever...

157
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:38,522
...gives you heartburn or feeds your
ulcers, whatever gives you the sweats,

158
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:41,342
keeps you up at night, whatever,

159
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:43,230
all of that...

160
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:47,704
...belongs to the United States Army.

161
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:52,697
Or to me, if that makes you feel
more comfortable.

162
00:13:53,475 --> 00:13:56,988
Now, you gotta come down
out of the clouds, gentlemen,

163
00:13:57,186 --> 00:14:01,245
and get into the business
of winning a war.

164
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,687
I'm gonna say it once.
I'm only gonna say it once.

165
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:09,207
Those of you who know, know.
Those of you who don't, don't.

166
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:14,136
You are not here to be comfortable.

167
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:16,409
All right?

168
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:21,501
You are here

169
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:25,212
to go beyond the theoretical,

170
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:28,125
the speculative, the fanciful.

171
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:34,433
You are here to harness
your God-given talents,

172
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:36,799
your minds, your energy,

173
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:41,240
in the practical pursuit of one thing:

174
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,674
A military weapon.

175
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:45,566
Nuclear one.

176
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,896
An atomic bomb.

177
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:52,638
Keep the muttering
to just a minimum, gentlemen.

178
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:56,376
Why bother with a bomb?
Why not just drop that man on Berlin?

179
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:59,613
- When you talk about it...
- It will have the same effect.

180
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:04,699
...it will be referred to as ''the gadget''
or ''the device''.

181
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:06,557
Is that clear?

182
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:11,639
There is one word
that I don't wanna hear.

183
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:14,206
And that's the word ''impossible''.

184
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:17,979
- You're two days late.
- I went to 109 East Palace Street

185
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:21,725
to report to Mrs. McKibben,
but there was nobody there.

186
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:27,073
So I hopped a construction bus, and it
damn near drove me back to Chicago.

187
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:32,253
I've been sitting on trains, buses,

188
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:36,606
railway stations for 60 hours.

189
00:15:38,242 --> 00:15:41,920
I asked about this place in Santa Fe,
and they said it didn't exist.

190
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:43,707
It doesn't.

191
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:52,055
So where does a fellow
get some chow around here, huh?

192
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:55,641
- We already ate.
- Oh, great.

193
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,071
Oh, if you wanna take a shower,
I'd take one now.

194
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:02,082
They turn off the water at 2:00.

195
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:11,448
Keep those two men back there.
We still gotta run the power through.

196
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,981
Yeah, you two men there!

197
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,616
Higher! A little more.

198
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:22,529
All right, that'll do it.

199
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:26,234
Open this door, now!

200
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:29,472
Sorry. I couldn't get in.

201
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:32,929
Give it a month, you'll do that
because you can't get out.

202
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,301
- You Merriman?
- Yeah.

203
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:37,727
Richard Schoenfield.
I'm the doctor around here.

204
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:41,816
You're just what I'm looking for
in a roommate, a little brute strength.

205
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:45,121
Holy shit!

206
00:16:45,282 --> 00:16:48,543
- What in God's name is this?
- It looks like a fridge.

207
00:16:48,705 --> 00:16:50,462
Oh, yeah, it does.

208
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,349
It looks stuck.

209
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:55,928
I guess you arrived just in time then.
Thank God you're here.

210
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,072
Which end would you like?

211
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,115
Are you ready?

212
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:08,921
- You want me to get it myself?
- Lift.

213
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:24,411
Oppie's boys.
No problem left unsolved.

214
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:30,654
Gentlemen, this project
has been separated into three areas.

215
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,086
The physics.
How much material do we need?

216
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:35,933
Should it be plutonium
or uranium 235?

217
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:39,359
Second, manufacture of material,
but that's out of our hands.

218
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:42,400
That's Oak Ridge, Tennessee
and Hanford. And third,

219
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,862
our responsibility,
and this is a cinch...

220
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:46,619
Yeah, sure.

221
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:50,910
...build the device, test it,
and just hope that we can control it.

222
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:53,212
Gentlemen, we are here...

223
00:17:54,882 --> 00:17:58,875
...at the beginning.
Our objective is here.

224
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,496
We have a deadline of 19 months.

225
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:06,653
19 months?
It seems such a short time.

226
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,916
19 months coincides
with our anticipated delivery date

227
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:13,245
from Oak Ridge. Gentlemen,
we have 19 months, that's it...

228
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,962
...to box, wrap
and deliver this package.

229
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,971
Are there any dissenters?

230
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:22,422
No?

231
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,411
Good.

232
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:28,511
<i>Nineteen months
and starting from scratch, Jesus.</i>

233
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:33,081
<i>Still, Oppie's got the best theoreticians
and engineers in the world.</i>

234
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:37,689
<i>Some of these guys are legends and
so young. The place is a hothouse.</i>

235
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:40,245
<i>Doc, he seems like
he's gonna be a good man.</i>

236
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:44,608
<i>Reckons we'll be working with funny
stuff. He's gonna be looking out for us.</i>

237
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:48,346
<i>He's got a whole wing of the hospital
that looks like Noah's Ark.</i>

238
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:52,566
<i>I think of Jimmy fighting in the
Philippines, and I can't complain.</i>

239
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:56,064
<i>I love you, but I gotta go.
General wants a progress report.</i>

240
00:18:56,225 --> 00:18:58,681
<i>When Groves wants something,
he wants it now.</i>

241
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:00,410
Again.

242
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:04,731
We build a cannon, and at the end

243
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:07,930
weld a stopper
made from a subcritical mass.

244
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:12,025
We fabricate a shell
made from another subcritical mass

245
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,103
and fire it down the barrel.

246
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:18,719
- How much of both materials?
- Projecting 30 pounds.

247
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,822
30 pounds is as far away
as the moon.

248
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:24,025
<i>We're trying to tap the energy
that fuels the universe.</i>

249
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:27,226
<i>It's petrifying. All we've got
so far are problems,</i>

250
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:30,654
<i>and that doesn't include the ones
we haven't thought about.</i>

251
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:33,467
Shake down the bad news.
I'm getting used to it.

252
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,535
At the moment, there are
two problems. Pre-detonation.

253
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:39,125
The gadget disintegrates
before it explodes.

254
00:19:39,297 --> 00:19:41,565
Second, it's the weight problem.

255
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:44,282
For the slug to travel at the velocity
we need,

256
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:46,783
the gun barrel
would be so heavy, so thick,

257
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:50,425
I don't think we'd get the gadget
off the ground with a crane.

258
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:53,886
If they're talking about a slug
with a seven-inch diameter,

259
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:57,790
then you'd have to have a barrel
thickness of at least four inches.

260
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:05,948
I hope you guys find the music.

261
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:08,567
The way things are,
we can't even hum the tune.

262
00:20:08,737 --> 00:20:10,363
Free discussion.
Two groups...

263
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:12,797
- I'm not comfortable with...
- Excuse me.

264
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,758
Seth, Deke, the gun barrel.
Robert, Michael, pre-detonation.

265
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:23,904
Damn it! Just, damn it!
Maybe it's the altitude.

266
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,494
But we're still just chalk
on a blackboard.

267
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:28,478
We're dead in the water.

268
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:32,030
Maybe we cast a lighter
gun barrel, find a new alloy.

269
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:33,817
The force would be too great.

270
00:20:33,985 --> 00:20:38,140
We gotta smack these atoms together
to trigger a chain reaction.

271
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:42,329
We gotta concentrate the energy
and crush the mass.

272
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:44,383
All right, let's rethink this.

273
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:48,156
We have a gun barrel that's so heavy
we can't lift it with a plane.

274
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,255
To get the explosive power we need,
it's gotta be heavy.

275
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,502
Michael, come here!

276
00:20:54,624 --> 00:20:56,729
When I squeeze this...

277
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,646
- ...what do I get?
- Juice.

278
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:03,605
No. I squeeze it, I get compression.

279
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:06,493
We get a hollow sphere
of plutonium,

280
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:09,852
and we compress it
with an explosion that goes in.

281
00:21:10,017 --> 00:21:12,220
- An implosion.
- Chain reaction.

282
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:14,108
Boom!

283
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:17,849
- But, Seth, explosives go out.
- I know.

284
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:20,830
But we make one that goes in.

285
00:21:22,976 --> 00:21:24,569
Jesus.

286
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:26,458
- Michael.
- Let's get the boys.

287
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:28,630
We'll meet down here in the canteen.

288
00:21:28,832 --> 00:21:33,304
It's brilliant. The device is gonna be so
light that we don't need a gun barrel!

289
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:36,856
Got a match, soldier?

290
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:49,463
Sir, it's Michael and Seth!

291
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:53,437
I'm sorry to bother you.

292
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,414
But Seth had an idea.
He was thinking of an orange.

293
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,772
Yes, I was thinking of jumping
up and down on an orange.

294
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,790
- Crushing an orange.
- Crushing!

295
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:04,951
Crushing...the core.

296
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,803
Oh, God.
This could be very sweet.

297
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:11,416
- Where are the others?
- Canteen, they wanna kick it around.

298
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,650
- Perhaps it can wait till later?
- No, you go ahead.

299
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:17,532
- I'd have lost you anyway.
- Thank you.

300
00:22:24,063 --> 00:22:26,234
Goddamn it.

301
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,050
Doctor!

302
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:49,557
- Come on!
- Double up, over here!

303
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:53,403
I'm sorry. We were looking for testing
sites and the bus got stuck.

304
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:57,461
You had a meeting last night.
You discussed the work in public.

305
00:22:57,631 --> 00:22:59,638
We were discussing
Neddermeyer's...

306
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:02,589
- In public!
- A table in the back of the canteen.

307
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:06,328
- We were having a free discussion.
- Let's just talk about that.

308
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:09,723
I don't want free discussion.
I want compartmentalization.

309
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:13,564
I don't want theoreticians
knowing what engineers know.

310
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:17,043
- Listen to me...
- It is a security problem!

311
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:20,695
These kids are used to pinning
their best ideas on a board.

312
00:23:20,863 --> 00:23:24,409
Ideas are community property.
It's a matter of principle.

313
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:28,029
You force my hand and there
won't be any free discussion

314
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:31,453
because there won't be anybody left
to have it!

315
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,638
If you'd been there you'd understand.
Neddermeyer's idea was brilliant.

316
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,563
An explosion that goes inwards,

317
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:41,240
producing uniform compression
in a core and it'd be lightweight.

318
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:44,090
No gun barrel,
no velocity and weight problem.

319
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:46,775
And all of that
out of free discussion.

320
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:49,398
You've got to give us room
to breathe.

321
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,784
- Bronson?
- Sir?

322
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,406
Just don't give it to the waitresses.

323
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,030
<i>Oppie's quite a match
for the general.</i>

324
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:11,573
<i>I'm worried it's not in Groves' nature
to rest until he gets the upper hand.</i>

325
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:13,814
<i>We're terrified the Germans
are ahead.</i>

326
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:17,692
<i>Working with restrictions
and regulations is setting us on edge.</i>

327
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:21,149
This is typical.
We are people, not numbers!

328
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:23,482
It's not part of the agreement,
general.

329
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:26,712
I apologize for complaints,
but barbed wire,

330
00:24:26,878 --> 00:24:28,569
dogs, guards!

331
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:30,840
- Security badges!
- Secrets!

332
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:33,941
I hoped to leave these things in Italy
with Mussolini!

333
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,827
Openness is a principle
matter for scientists!

334
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:40,951
And there are many other things.
I resent my letters are being censored.

335
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:44,892
The FBI talking to me, that's one
thing. But my wife, my family,

336
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:47,924
that's a little much.
Don't you think?

337
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:51,194
We cannot continue work
under these conditions!

338
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,693
- Doctor.
- And what about...?

339
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:08,538
Well, that is some monkey house
in there.

340
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:11,132
A mess.
What are you gonna do about it?

341
00:25:11,294 --> 00:25:13,301
I warned you about this.

342
00:25:15,326 --> 00:25:19,582
Look, you give me responsibility
for security inside the lab.

343
00:25:19,742 --> 00:25:22,164
We go where we like, as we like,
when we like.

344
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:24,723
Outside the lab, that's yours.

345
00:25:25,406 --> 00:25:27,741
I will sell them on that.

346
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:35,006
I don't like it.
But I will live with it, for now.

347
00:25:42,686 --> 00:25:44,180
<i>The 8th Air Force today</i>

348
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:48,604
<i>carried out its heaviest bombing
of the war against Germany.</i>

349
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:52,082
Michael! Michael. What do you say?
Good to see you.

350
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:55,003
- How are you?
- I brought Kathleen with me.

351
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:59,094
I was afraid this party would be
a little short on the beauty side,

352
00:25:59,262 --> 00:26:03,670
so I took the appropriate precautions,
if you know what I'm saying.

353
00:26:04,222 --> 00:26:07,964
- I mean, she is my favorite nurse.
- You two gonna get together?

354
00:26:09,982 --> 00:26:13,779
No. No, we're not.
Actually, I'm gonna get a drink.

355
00:26:13,982 --> 00:26:19,033
That's what I'm gonna get. A good
stiff drink, that's all I'm gonna get.

356
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,375
- Two bucks...
- It's a short bet.

357
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,344
- Like I said...
- This is stuck.

358
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:31,575
...it can be pretty lonely here.

359
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:33,530
There's a war on.

360
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:36,596
Not everybody can go to Acapulco.

361
00:26:43,294 --> 00:26:46,141
- Oh, my.
- Are you OK?

362
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:51,738
Good.
Thank you.

363
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,716
Look, they're perfect.

364
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:58,074
Another minute,
they would have been overdone.

365
00:26:58,622 --> 00:27:00,792
Well, I'll put this in the sink.

366
00:27:00,957 --> 00:27:03,892
- Would you like some orange juice?
- Yes, kindly.

367
00:27:04,061 --> 00:27:09,014
- I am sorry.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

368
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:13,115
- This will be taken care of.
- It's OK.

369
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:19,092
Anyway, I'm sure
we're going to be allies, general.

370
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:21,979
We're both trying to seduce
the same man.

371
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:30,203
So is there a Mrs. Groves?

372
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:34,165
Yes, there is.

373
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:38,419
And she has the courage
to stay in the background.

374
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:42,611
Some men are on the planet
for a purpose, Mrs. Oppenheimer.

375
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:47,735
A good wife recognizes that
and is happy to smooth the way.

376
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:54,551
Read my theory
on degenerate matter, did you?

377
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:57,564
It didn't generate
much enthusiasm elsewhere.

378
00:27:57,724 --> 00:28:01,401
But what do you think we'll find
at the end of the tunnel, Michael?

379
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:04,827
- A martini.
- Probably.

380
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:13,203
Hey!

381
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:28,216
<i>- Operator.
- Berkeley 5558, please.</i>

382
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:35,187
Hello, Jean.
It's me.

383
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:39,732
<i>- Jean, I know you're there.
- I'd given up waiting.</i>

384
00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:42,940
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to manage...

385
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,467
<i>Oppie, I've been so frightened.</i>

386
00:28:45,628 --> 00:28:48,596
<i>You don't phone. You don't write.
Not even a message.</i>

387
00:28:48,764 --> 00:28:50,455
<i>- I can't.
- You can't?</i>

388
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,141
<i>No, Jean, I can't.</i>

389
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:54,868
<i>- Are you coming?
- Well...</i>

390
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:57,751
<i>- When are you coming?
- Jean.</i>

391
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:02,236
<i>This isn't talking.
This is just making noises.</i>

392
00:29:02,396 --> 00:29:04,501
<i>Why don't we just grunt
at each other?</i>

393
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:07,318
<i>- ''I gotta run. There's a war to win.''
- Jean.</i>

394
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:10,780
<i>I can't remember a day
I wasn't hurting, except with you.</i>

395
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,617
Jean, listen to me.
You've got to understand, please.

396
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:41,522
Yes?

397
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,242
I won't keep you, general.

398
00:29:45,404 --> 00:29:46,964
Well, you better had.

399
00:29:47,132 --> 00:29:50,034
Banging on my door
at 2:00 in the morning.

400
00:29:52,636 --> 00:29:55,670
I had this typed up, sir.
I thought you'd wanna see it.

401
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,457
She's working him over, general.
I've seen this before.

402
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,075
That grunting at each other,
could be a code.

403
00:30:05,244 --> 00:30:08,506
- The cipher clerk said it's not code.
- Who is this woman?

404
00:30:08,668 --> 00:30:11,930
Jean Tatlock, sir.
She's a known communist.

405
00:30:12,091 --> 00:30:14,295
Get me her background.

406
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:19,033
And maybe I am missing some stuff
on the good doctor.

407
00:30:19,196 --> 00:30:21,083
- Get it for me.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:30:21,244 --> 00:30:25,041
This must throw Oppenheimer's
position on this project into doubt, sir.

409
00:30:25,212 --> 00:30:28,375
- Dr. Oppenheimer is the project.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,362
All due respect, sir, though, doesn't
this make him an unacceptable risk?

411
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:36,411
No! Failure's a risk.

412
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,941
The thing that concerns me is,
if he's with her, he's not with us.

413
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:49,047
It might be a good time
to put the screws to the doctor.

414
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:52,245
Yes, sir. May I ask,
how do you intend to do that, sir?

415
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:54,746
No, colonel, you may not.

416
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:24,090
- Compression not uniform.
- Stand by!

417
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:27,830
If we had a thinner wall, we could
increase the compression, yes?

418
00:31:27,996 --> 00:31:29,621
Seth, there's an answer here.

419
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,176
Oppie, maybe implosion's
just a blind alley.

420
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:34,005
- Are we going again?
- Yes!

421
00:31:34,203 --> 00:31:37,499
- That's an excuse for not thinking...
- We'll get reset.

422
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:43,540
All clear!
Reset the charges!

423
00:31:43,707 --> 00:31:46,424
Reset the charges!

424
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:49,522
- We got all clear! Let's go!
- Let's move!

425
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:53,749
- Move it!
- On the double! On the double! Go!

426
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:57,941
- Move it! Move it!
- Bring it in! Left side! Left side!

427
00:31:58,524 --> 00:32:00,531
Come on!
Get the lead out!

428
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:03,317
On the double, guys!
Let's go!

429
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:05,914
Canyon to Los Alamos.

430
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:11,287
Come in, Los Alamos.

431
00:32:11,452 --> 00:32:13,491
Canyon to Los Alamos.

432
00:32:17,274 --> 00:32:19,446
Come in, Los Alamos. Come in.

433
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:24,984
- Something set off the detonators.
- Stay back! They're wired in series.

434
00:32:25,148 --> 00:32:26,838
Get out of there!

435
00:32:32,698 --> 00:32:34,161
- No, Oppie.
- Shit.

436
00:32:47,962 --> 00:32:49,490
It's all right.

437
00:32:51,994 --> 00:32:53,751
Take it easy, brother.

438
00:32:57,947 --> 00:32:59,440
Thanks a lot.

439
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:03,059
Do me a favor.
Jump in the ambulance.

440
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:04,853
Let me give you
the once-over.

441
00:33:05,018 --> 00:33:08,018
You guys are playing
with some funny stuff out here.

442
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,552
Let's go. Start them up.

443
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:28,601
Did they teach you that at high school?

444
00:33:29,947 --> 00:33:31,953
You took a risk.

445
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:35,929
I ran out and grabbed the guy.
I didn't even think.

446
00:33:36,091 --> 00:33:38,993
- Just instinct.
- Instinct, huh?

447
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:43,414
You know, I wonder,
with this war...

448
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,026
...if it's instinct to save a man,
what makes us want to kill one?

449
00:33:47,386 --> 00:33:49,328
Is that instinct?

450
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:53,530
You sound like my old man.

451
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:55,031
Why, what's he like?

452
00:33:55,194 --> 00:33:57,365
- My old man?
- Yeah.

453
00:33:58,618 --> 00:34:00,342
He's a preacher.

454
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:03,377
In Jackson, Illinois.

455
00:34:04,123 --> 00:34:08,051
And I got an older brother,
Jimmy, and he's a soldier.

456
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,193
My mom's dead.

457
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:14,006
I don't know, I guess he's kind of
hurt that I'm not at the front.

458
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:17,299
- Why?
- Well, Jackson is a small town.

459
00:34:17,498 --> 00:34:20,727
- He said, ''Where you going?''
- I said, ''Santa Fe, New Mexico.''

460
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:24,818
- I know.
- So that didn't quite hack it.

461
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:27,608
He said,
''lf you're not gonna be a soldier,

462
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:30,159
''you better be a good scientist.
The best.''

463
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:34,068
- Are you the best?
- I was in Chicago.

464
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,854
But these guys are so bright.

465
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,344
Sometimes I feel like
I'm in over my head.

466
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:43,540
But I guess I can handle
anything they throw at me.

467
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:47,030
But can you dance?

468
00:34:47,193 --> 00:34:48,656
Pardon me?

469
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,533
I said, can you dance?

470
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:56,533
- Yeah.
- Well, do it.

471
00:34:56,985 --> 00:34:59,952
- Are you serious?
- Can't handle it?

472
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,206
Very nice.

473
00:35:35,545 --> 00:35:38,228
- Something like that.
- Very good.

474
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,664
Jean Tatlock, graduated in 1932.

475
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:06,964
They had a thing together
before Oppenheimer was married.

476
00:36:07,129 --> 00:36:08,656
Seems Tatlock ran off.

477
00:36:08,826 --> 00:36:11,826
Things went on the back burner
between them till 1942.

478
00:36:11,993 --> 00:36:13,619
Then it all started up again.

479
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:17,942
His associate said, ''lf the wife's
his ambition, Tatlock's his conscience.''

480
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:22,098
She introduced him to a number of
anti-fascist groups, anti-Franco groups

481
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:23,726
and a number of communists.

482
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:25,140
- Bronson.
- Sir.

483
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:28,883
Little less muscle on the gas here.
Colonel's starting a mission.

484
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:30,259
I'd like him alive.

485
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:31,796
Yes, sir.

486
00:36:31,962 --> 00:36:34,809
This makes Oppenheimer
a sitting duck for blackmail.

487
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:37,271
I'm gonna insist on his removal.

488
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:39,734
No, you're not. Just relax.

489
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:44,338
You know, major, if you want
to lead a man in a certain direction,

490
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:46,992
you don't drag him by the nose.

491
00:36:47,545 --> 00:36:49,367
You just close off his options.

492
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:51,635
Simple as a truck.

493
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:58,200
<i>Here we are in the top of the ninth.</i>

494
00:36:58,361 --> 00:37:00,727
<i>The Army down
to the Scientists by one run.</i>

495
00:37:01,913 --> 00:37:05,426
<i>Dugan shakes it off.
Here's Merriman's pitch.</i>

496
00:37:05,593 --> 00:37:07,186
<i>That's a hit.</i>

497
00:37:07,353 --> 00:37:10,003
<i>Dugan digging for first base,
gonna go for two.</i>

498
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,585
<i>Look out. Here's the throw.
Safe at second base on a slide.</i>

499
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:16,535
<i>Apple scores.
That ties the game.</i>

500
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:25,399
Yes?

501
00:37:27,321 --> 00:37:28,782
Yes?!

502
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,255
Bad time?

503
00:37:34,424 --> 00:37:37,905
The velocity's still presenting us
with something of a problem.

504
00:37:41,752 --> 00:37:44,851
Who's this bimbo
you're running around with?

505
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:49,461
- What?
- Do I have to tell you?

506
00:37:49,944 --> 00:37:52,661
I got it on the q.t.
from somebody who owes me.

507
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:54,864
What if the next guy
doesn't owe me?

508
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,585
Takes that kind of information
to the wrong guy?

509
00:37:57,784 --> 00:38:02,007
That could be the end of you.
Could be the end of this project.

510
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:04,567
I don't understand you.

511
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:09,330
You think you're some kind
of bohemian or something.

512
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,989
Blind-sided.

513
00:38:16,153 --> 00:38:19,469
I never expected to get
blind-sided like this.

514
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:29,006
<i>And there it is.
A line drive.</i>

515
00:38:29,593 --> 00:38:33,847
Doctor, might I be of assistance?

516
00:38:34,008 --> 00:38:37,324
What about me in all this?
This looks bad.

517
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:41,009
Reflects on me.
Reflects on my ability to choose men.

518
00:38:41,176 --> 00:38:44,918
I was with this woman before
this project. This is not a new thing.

519
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:46,966
It's no matter.

520
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:51,570
I am not comfortable with the idea
that you could sink me.

521
00:38:56,023 --> 00:38:57,879
This is someone that I care about.

522
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:00,179
She's a communist.

523
00:39:01,624 --> 00:39:03,053
A communist.

524
00:39:04,056 --> 00:39:05,430
Oh, my God.

525
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:08,145
It would be bad enough if she
were just some...

526
00:39:08,311 --> 00:39:10,068
...sweet young thing from Indiana.

527
00:39:10,232 --> 00:39:12,141
She's a card-carrying communist.

528
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:17,143
And your job, classified job. What do
I have to do, draw you a map?

529
00:39:17,303 --> 00:39:20,533
Get on the phone, a secure line,
tell her...goodbye!

530
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:22,420
<i>The pitch. It's a line drive!</i>

531
00:39:23,704 --> 00:39:26,933
<i>It's out of there! It's gone!
Home run for Merriman.</i>

532
00:39:27,704 --> 00:39:28,980
Home run!

533
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:34,101
- It's all right, Bronson, we'll live.
- Yes, sir.

534
00:39:34,264 --> 00:39:36,654
<i>Well, that's it, folks,
Scientists win the game.</i>

535
00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:38,350
It's in your court.

536
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:54,932
Bridges, next time keep your head up.

537
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,672
<i>All hail the conquering hero.</i>

538
00:39:59,768 --> 00:40:02,451
<i>Pencil pushers defeat
the doughboys.</i>

539
00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:51,121
Robert!

540
00:40:54,711 --> 00:40:57,133
- Frank.
- Good to see you, bro.

541
00:40:58,136 --> 00:41:00,918
- Are we being followed or something?
- Don't joke.

542
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,989
I nearly asked you for your ID.

543
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:06,959
- That's ridiculous.
- Let's just leave as soon as we can.

544
00:41:15,863 --> 00:41:19,279
They've been hounding me
for names of every person I've known

545
00:41:19,447 --> 00:41:21,008
who had communist sympathies.

546
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:25,205
They monitor every move I make.
They listen to my phone conversations.

547
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:26,829
Why stay?

548
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:28,886
There's an order to it.

549
00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:31,916
An order in some part of my life,
at least.

550
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:35,470
I'm sorry, I didn't get your message
till about 5.

551
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:40,461
I was still at the hospital, and I got
all whizzed up into a huge panic.

552
00:41:40,663 --> 00:41:42,256
You look wonderful.

553
00:41:42,454 --> 00:41:45,008
You look so serious.
What's the matter?

554
00:41:46,615 --> 00:41:49,332
I don't have much time.
I have to go back tonight.

555
00:41:49,495 --> 00:41:50,956
Tonight?

556
00:41:51,128 --> 00:41:53,014
I cooked us dinner.

557
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:02,604
This can't be about dinner, Jean.

558
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:07,148
I didn't want to tell you
on the telephone.

559
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,513
And that's why I'm here tonight.

560
00:42:18,775 --> 00:42:21,328
Is it because of what you're doing?

561
00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:32,149
Fine.

562
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:36,812
We're going to spill the blood
before we get to the cocktails.

563
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:51,119
Jean?

564
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,106
Please...stay tonight.

565
00:42:57,046 --> 00:42:58,453
Please.

566
00:42:59,574 --> 00:43:01,135
Please.

567
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:05,614
Please.

568
00:43:05,782 --> 00:43:08,084
Please.

569
00:43:31,927 --> 00:43:35,243
What you're working on,
it's something bad, isn't it?

570
00:43:35,414 --> 00:43:37,302
That's why you can't tell me.

571
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:40,048
I can't tell you
because it's a secret.

572
00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:43,604
Tell me one good thing
that's a secret.

573
00:43:43,766 --> 00:43:45,589
We were a good thing.

574
00:43:46,742 --> 00:43:48,171
No, we weren't.

575
00:43:48,374 --> 00:43:50,413
Not when you got married.

576
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,543
Give me up for something
I can understand.

577
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,099
Your wife or your child
or your conscience,

578
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,961
something alive.

579
00:43:59,127 --> 00:44:01,712
Not something
that you have to hide.

580
00:44:02,454 --> 00:44:03,949
Robert.

581
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:40,237
Oh, Robert, I dreamt you'd gone.

582
00:44:47,286 --> 00:44:50,067
So that's what the silences were.

583
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:52,948
No letters, no contact.

584
00:44:54,582 --> 00:44:57,102
I thought it was me,
something I'd done.

585
00:44:57,301 --> 00:45:01,361
- I've told you it has nothing to do...
- Yes, but you didn't tell me...

586
00:45:03,542 --> 00:45:06,575
What is it you're working on?
What is so important?

587
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:09,130
That's right. It is important.

588
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:11,473
So don't be so goddamn arrogant.

589
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:14,190
Is it arrogant to want
to know where you are?

590
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:18,068
What's happening to you? To want
to be close to you? To understand?

591
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:23,498
This was the man I loved.

592
00:45:24,053 --> 00:45:27,315
I loved his dreams.
I loved what he saw but couldn't prove.

593
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:30,128
I loved the goodness in him.

594
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:33,872
He was my proof that the world
could be made better.

595
00:45:34,677 --> 00:45:37,098
And if he's dead, I don't want to live.

596
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:43,153
The world is...different.

597
00:45:44,245 --> 00:45:46,482
It's just not what we
wanted it to be.

598
00:45:46,645 --> 00:45:48,271
It's just not.

599
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:58,131
You mattered to me so much.

600
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:01,392
You really did.

601
00:46:13,718 --> 00:46:17,295
She told me that I had
a penchant for destruction.

602
00:46:17,813 --> 00:46:19,602
That I'd lost faith.

603
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:22,477
Is she wrong?

604
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,334
No.

605
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,875
She's not wrong.

606
00:46:28,757 --> 00:46:32,073
When this war's over, I want
to ride the mesa for six months.

607
00:46:32,277 --> 00:46:33,706
No deadlines.

608
00:46:34,548 --> 00:46:35,857
Nothing.

609
00:46:41,013 --> 00:46:42,573
Thanks, Frank.

610
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,747
He just kissed his brother.

611
00:46:44,917 --> 00:46:46,739
Gotta be a communist.

612
00:47:02,421 --> 00:47:04,428
Set that over there.

613
00:47:07,796 --> 00:47:10,764
Look at it, Oppie, it's twisted.
It's got to be flat.

614
00:47:10,932 --> 00:47:15,155
I think implosion's nothing but a pipe
dream. I'm sorry I thought of it.

615
00:47:15,317 --> 00:47:16,878
I can't do it.

616
00:47:17,524 --> 00:47:21,169
Oppie, some way I have to focus...
I have to focus the shock waves.

617
00:47:21,525 --> 00:47:23,793
Look at me!
God, I'm running out of ideas.

618
00:47:23,957 --> 00:47:27,732
That's an excuse for not thinking.
If you can't, I'll find somebody else.

619
00:47:27,893 --> 00:47:30,926
Oppie? Serber needs
you back at the lab right now.

620
00:47:31,092 --> 00:47:33,002
- Oppie?
- You said it yourself.

621
00:47:33,172 --> 00:47:36,914
Focus. Somebody's working on a way
to focus an explosive shock wave.

622
00:47:37,076 --> 00:47:39,760
- I'm gonna find him. Keep working.
- Jesus!

623
00:47:45,844 --> 00:47:49,936
You know, if Oppie doesn't let up,
he's going to implode.

624
00:48:02,164 --> 00:48:04,466
Inside. Inside.

625
00:48:08,725 --> 00:48:12,041
Good news is the new plutonium
makes lots of neutrons.

626
00:48:12,245 --> 00:48:15,954
But the bad news is the spontaneous
fission rate is way too high.

627
00:48:16,116 --> 00:48:19,728
The reaction will run away with itself.
There will just be a fizzle.

628
00:48:19,891 --> 00:48:22,925
- No explosion.
- You're certain of that, Edward?

629
00:48:23,092 --> 00:48:25,067
- Who did the calculations?
- Serber.

630
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,953
- Himself?
- Serber, personally.

631
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:32,749
So now plutonium is a problem. That
shifts the emphasis back to U-235.

632
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:36,844
Of course, Oak Ridge is not able
to produce that in sufficient quantity.

633
00:48:37,044 --> 00:48:40,393
We must go with implosion, but
Neddermeyer has just announced to me

634
00:48:40,596 --> 00:48:43,912
that he and implosion
have just reached a brick wall.

635
00:48:47,156 --> 00:48:48,847
We can't fall behind.

636
00:48:50,932 --> 00:48:52,590
Are you all right, Oppie?

637
00:48:53,203 --> 00:48:54,632
You have a deadline to meet.

638
00:48:56,244 --> 00:49:00,499
Banked almost a billion dollars on you
guys. That's not working on the cheap.

639
00:49:01,012 --> 00:49:03,346
Only thing I want to hear is, ''Yes, sir.''

640
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:07,469
Don't talk to me like I haven't given
eight days a week to this project.

641
00:49:07,668 --> 00:49:09,195
I've given up everything.

642
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:11,284
Don't... Don't give me that.

643
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,482
I don't want to hear
that from the...

644
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,407
I've given up everything.

645
00:49:15,572 --> 00:49:17,905
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

646
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:21,424
I don't give a goddamn
that travel was restricted.

647
00:49:21,588 --> 00:49:25,101
It had to be done face to face,
and that's the way I did it.

648
00:49:30,612 --> 00:49:32,816
<i>Latest news
from the fighting front.</i>

649
00:49:35,444 --> 00:49:38,923
<i>American armies are pushing the
Germans back on their own territory.</i>

650
00:49:39,092 --> 00:49:40,521
<i>But fighting is desperate.</i>

651
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:43,855
<i>The Germans are building up
for a massive counter thrust.</i>

652
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,954
<i>Though the Allies are determined
to hold this new front...</i>

653
00:49:47,156 --> 00:49:48,366
Who's the Lone Ranger?

654
00:49:48,531 --> 00:49:50,538
Explosives wiz.
I don't know about Tonto.

655
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:53,163
<i>Neddermeyer gave up
on his explosion that goes in.</i>

656
00:49:53,331 --> 00:49:54,541
<i>Not Oppie, though.</i>

657
00:49:54,707 --> 00:49:57,741
<i>He brought in two explosive
experts from the outside.</i>

658
00:49:57,939 --> 00:50:00,111
<i>We struggle on here
in our isolation.</i>

659
00:50:00,276 --> 00:50:03,375
<i>And sometimes the war
seems a long way away.</i>

660
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:10,092
You want a ride, doc?

661
00:50:10,259 --> 00:50:13,423
Hey, Seth. When did you
get your driver's license?

662
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:19,282
- You come to see the boys at play?
- Yes.

663
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,647
- Oh, bad news, beautiful.
- Oh, no.

664
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:24,266
I'm not gonna be able to make
that movie tonight.

665
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,912
I can join you both for a drink.
It would make you happy.

666
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:29,937
- Sound good?
- Perfect.

667
00:50:30,579 --> 00:50:32,751
Right, right.

668
00:50:32,915 --> 00:50:36,712
Well, I promised the monkey
we'd be cutting a rug anyway.

669
00:50:36,883 --> 00:50:38,705
It's just as well.

670
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,419
Michael, what's wrong with you?

671
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:44,427
Do you see much of him?

672
00:50:44,627 --> 00:50:46,450
Yes, I like him.

673
00:50:50,356 --> 00:50:51,817
Are you jealous?

674
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:55,821
Yeah.

675
00:50:58,067 --> 00:50:59,855
You better do something about it.

676
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,074
Tell them I ain't buying.
White House said

677
00:51:16,275 --> 00:51:18,992
there wouldn't be
any account till after the war.

678
00:51:20,915 --> 00:51:23,152
It's so damn tough
to get through to you,

679
00:51:23,315 --> 00:51:25,453
I decided to bring
you my problem.

680
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,848
See the tread on that tire?
Because I sure as hell don't.

681
00:51:29,011 --> 00:51:31,432
Yet that's what my men
are riding around on.

682
00:51:32,435 --> 00:51:35,882
I don't know what kind of deal
you got yourself into, Groves,

683
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,636
but I do care when it cuts
in on my territory.

684
00:51:38,803 --> 00:51:42,316
If I'm gonna move supplies around
the country, I need trucks.

685
00:51:42,483 --> 00:51:44,457
Those trucks run on tires, Dick.

686
00:51:44,626 --> 00:51:48,620
When I hear they ain't moving because
of some tire shortage, I get mad.

687
00:51:48,818 --> 00:51:51,601
When I hear you're the cause
of it, I want to kill.

688
00:51:51,762 --> 00:51:55,537
- We gotta work something...
- No dice. We got a triple-A priority.

689
00:51:55,731 --> 00:51:58,730
White House authority.
We need the product.

690
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:03,080
You need to know something.

691
00:52:03,251 --> 00:52:05,519
You're getting a lot
of people's backs up.

692
00:52:06,066 --> 00:52:08,587
Let me remind you of something else.
See this?

693
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:10,064
I count two. You got one.

694
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:13,521
When this war's over,
that will amount to something.

695
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:19,853
And, Dick, I hope you get my meaning.

696
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,538
Because, by all that's holy...

697
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:25,295
...you better have
your ass well-covered.

698
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:38,026
- Well, Bronson.
- Sir?

699
00:52:38,386 --> 00:52:41,103
- It's all about ass, isn't it?
- Sir?

700
00:52:41,266 --> 00:52:43,688
You kick it or you lick it.

701
00:52:43,858 --> 00:52:45,996
That's what it's all about.

702
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:48,617
I'm sorry about
my language, Bronson.

703
00:52:48,787 --> 00:52:50,412
But I'm on the limb.

704
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:53,903
My prima donnas
better come through...

705
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:57,128
...or you are looking
at a piece of dead meat.

706
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,860
Yes, sir.

707
00:53:09,842 --> 00:53:12,209
- What's this?
- I don't know, sir.

708
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,064
God, almighty.

709
00:53:14,226 --> 00:53:15,916
Is this a stop?

710
00:53:16,082 --> 00:53:18,700
What time is it?
There's no scheduled stop here.

711
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,477
Message for General Groves.

712
00:53:31,697 --> 00:53:35,494
- I'll see what the problem is, sir.
- Message for General Groves.

713
00:53:36,145 --> 00:53:38,763
- Message for General Groves.
- In this way.

714
00:53:44,497 --> 00:53:46,767
General Groves, sir.
This is from Germany.

715
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:50,313
It was flown in. We wired
ahead to have the train stopped.

716
00:53:50,482 --> 00:53:52,337
Excuse me, gentlemen.

717
00:54:06,513 --> 00:54:09,131
- Colonel.
- General.

718
00:54:12,945 --> 00:54:15,280
Put it in my safe, in the back.

719
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:17,131
Don't bring it out.

720
00:54:20,017 --> 00:54:22,768
That means the Germans don't
have the bomb. Weren't close.

721
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:25,929
Sir, is it wise?
I mean, suppressing this?

722
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:29,030
Well, you tell me, colonel.

723
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:31,500
It's delicate stuff.

724
00:54:33,585 --> 00:54:36,203
I'm talking about my longhairs,
my prima donnas.

725
00:54:36,369 --> 00:54:37,930
The Jewish element.

726
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:42,732
Take Hitler out of the equation...
they might just run out of stink.

727
00:54:42,898 --> 00:54:44,806
Why chance it?

728
00:54:45,585 --> 00:54:48,934
We can give this country
the biggest stick in the playground.

729
00:54:49,105 --> 00:54:50,828
And I intend to do that.

730
00:54:52,146 --> 00:54:55,527
And I'll tell you something
about our bunch.

731
00:54:55,698 --> 00:54:57,127
Get them close.

732
00:54:58,034 --> 00:55:00,172
Then they'll go all the way.

733
00:55:01,521 --> 00:55:03,344
They're just not close enough yet.

734
00:55:03,505 --> 00:55:05,032
Yes, sir.

735
00:55:12,657 --> 00:55:16,519
Perhaps you should think of these
wedges as forming part of a shell.

736
00:55:16,849 --> 00:55:21,803
They do redirect the shock waves in
the same way as a lens redirects light.

737
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:25,450
As a matter of interest, we've
already used the idea in England

738
00:55:25,618 --> 00:55:27,756
for armor-piercing shells.

739
00:55:31,377 --> 00:55:33,799
Pray it works.
We'll be back on schedule.

740
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:35,343
Heads up.

741
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,546
Watch your backs.

742
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:05,776
No one ever used high explosives...

743
00:56:05,937 --> 00:56:09,166
...as a precision instrument before.

744
00:56:10,001 --> 00:56:11,211
It's so simple.

745
00:56:11,376 --> 00:56:14,726
It just swings the shock waves
from convex to concave.

746
00:56:14,896 --> 00:56:17,799
- Some orange, hey, Oppie?
- No, after the explosion.

747
00:56:23,344 --> 00:56:24,937
Dr. Oppenheimer.

748
00:56:25,521 --> 00:56:26,731
Dr. Oppenheimer.

749
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:28,141
A letter for you, sir.

750
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:30,760
- They said it was important.
- Thank you.

751
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,830
Good luck.

752
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:43,928
<i>We squeezed it!
Damn it, we got compression!</i>

753
00:57:44,096 --> 00:57:46,963
<i>We're on the way!
The right mix and we're home, Oppie!</i>

754
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:49,601
<i>We're home free, vindicated!
We're vindicated!</i>

755
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:52,795
- We got a ball game here.
- Seth, come here!

756
00:57:53,472 --> 00:57:55,667
Next stop, implosion!

757
00:58:23,138 --> 00:58:25,538
Can I come in?

758
00:58:26,141 --> 00:58:27,938
Where is he?
