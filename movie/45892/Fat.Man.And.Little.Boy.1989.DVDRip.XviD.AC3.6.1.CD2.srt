1
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:07,267
<i>We squeezed it!</i>
<i>Damn it, we got compression!</i>

2
00:00:07,435 --> 00:00:10,302
<i>We're on the way!</i>
<i>The right mix and we're home, Oppie!</i>

3
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:12,940
<i>We're home free, vindicated!</i>
<i>We're vindicated!</i>

4
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:16,134
- We got a ball game here.
- Seth, come here!

5
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:19,006
Next stop, implosion!

6
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:51,177
Can I come in?

7
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,577
Where is he?

8
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:55,443
He's out back.

9
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:59,110
Sitting in the sun
with a blanket on his lap.

10
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:02,889
Nursing a guilty dick, no doubt.

11
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,528
It is not necessary to be vulgar.

12
00:01:08,863 --> 00:01:11,229
Nothing I say could
approach the vulgarity

13
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,731
of what you're building
in your back yard.

14
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:19,573
Well, vulgar or not...

15
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:22,235
...I need him to come
through on this.

16
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,346
He owes it to his country.
He owes it to himself.

17
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:30,843
He is the best there is. And he
should have whatever he wants.

18
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,682
Don't try to recruit me, general.
You don't need my help.

19
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:39,117
And spare me your homily on being
a good wife. I know it by heart.

20
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:42,853
Why did you put up with her
for so long?

21
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:48,058
Because he's the best there is.
He should have whatever he wants.

22
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:55,875
I don't live very well alone.

23
00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:57,409
Some people don't.

24
00:01:57,946 --> 00:02:01,211
We all have different ways
of defending our territory.

25
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:10,615
Concha, you're late.
Peter, hurry up. Didn't I say 2:00?

26
00:02:18,132 --> 00:02:19,656
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,439
And I am sorry that the news
took so long to get to you.

28
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:29,975
It just got lost
in the system censors.

29
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:33,008
You know...

30
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:39,250
...you can't be responsible
for keeping somebody else alive.

31
00:02:40,688 --> 00:02:43,350
It isn't possible.
It's not to be expected.

32
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:46,817
I can't work on this anymore.

33
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:55,931
I don't want to.

34
00:02:57,238 --> 00:02:58,865
And I don't need to.

35
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,167
Germany is finished.

36
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:05,444
It's just a matter of time.
They can't pull this together.

37
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:09,040
- You sure?
- I don't want to hear your arguments.

38
00:03:10,752 --> 00:03:13,778
I already know that everything is a risk.

39
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:16,515
That the war is not over until it's over.

40
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:19,854
That they're lobbing rockets
all over London.

41
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:23,429
That Germany is desperate.
That she's resourceful.

42
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:26,464
If she doesn't get a device,
she could litter England

43
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:30,035
with radioactive material.
We thought of something similar.

44
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:32,138
The fact of the matter is...

45
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:35,504
...they're not as good as we are.
Or are they?

46
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:44,113
Christ, I've got rats in my skull.

47
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:51,386
I'm being asked to throw too many
balls in the air at the same time.

48
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:57,191
When I feel like that,
I get down on my knees...

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,331
...and I pray.

50
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:03,796
And that's how I get conviction.

51
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,302
If you let this slip through your fingers,
through our fingers,

52
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:10,239
and somebody else gets it...

53
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:15,078
...you won't be counting how many
balls you throw in the air.

54
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,321
If you need the fire, you find it.

55
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:26,120
Wherever.

56
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:35,959
<i>At last, some good news.</i>

57
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,402
<i>Apparently, sufficient uranium is</i>
<i>beginning to arrive from Oak Ridge.</i>

58
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,568
<i>But, as brilliant as he is, Oppie's</i>
<i>beginning to show the strain.</i>

59
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,769
<i>We all depend on Oppie.</i>

60
00:04:46,948 --> 00:04:48,916
<i>He's our inspiration.</i>

61
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,018
<i>If he were to crack, we'd all fall apart.</i>

62
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:57,448
Beautiful, isn't it, Michael?
Just think...

63
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:01,061
...a few miles closer to the sun,
a few miles farther away,

64
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:03,959
none of this would be here.
Just a cloud of gas

65
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:06,565
or a block of ice
and nobody to enjoy it.

66
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:10,195
''Odi et amor'',
''I hate and I love.''

67
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:12,839
- Catullus. Do you know it?
- No.

68
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:19,345
<i>I hate and I love</i>
<i>Why, you ask? I don't know</i>

69
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:24,082
<i>I feel both</i>
<i>And I'm in agony</i>

70
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:30,054
Maybe General Groves is right. Maybe
we should just banish thinking forever.

71
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:36,589
Michael, we have to test
the critical mass.

72
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:41,099
- Are you going to help?
- Of course.

73
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:44,333
I want to show you something.

74
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,587
Come here to see our little toy, huh?

75
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:12,026
Michael, that's what we call
tickling the dragon's tail.

76
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:15,828
So a slug of uranium
about two by six inches

77
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:18,597
will be pulled by this weight.

78
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,272
It begins here, then accelerates
at 32 feet per second per second.

79
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:27,380
It passes between uranium bricks.
We have an instant of criticality.

80
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:30,847
For a split second,
we have a chain reaction.

81
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:34,112
As close as we come
to an atomic explosion in the lab.

82
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:36,518
- Without blowing up.
- Exactly.

83
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:40,593
It's essential to determine the amount
of material the device needs.

84
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:43,754
Ten years ago I could
hardly imagine the stuff.

85
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:45,432
Ten years.

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,627
Each molecule collected
out of the air, one by one.

87
00:06:52,707 --> 00:06:54,299
Hello?

88
00:06:56,077 --> 00:06:57,339
What?

89
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:11,384
<i>I have the rare privilege</i>
<i>of speaking for a victorious army</i>

90
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,720
<i>of almost five million fighting men.</i>

91
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:16,693
<i>They and the women</i>
<i>who have so ably assisted them</i>

92
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:19,389
<i>constitute the Allied</i>
<i>Expeditionary Force</i>

93
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,034
<i>that has liberated Western Europe.</i>

94
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:24,728
<i>They have destroyed</i>
<i>or captured enemy armies</i>

95
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:27,100
<i>totaling more than their own strength</i>

96
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:30,870
<i>and swept triumphantly forward</i>
<i>over the hundreds of miles</i>

97
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:32,945
<i>separating Cherbourg from Lübeck,</i>

98
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:34,411
<i>Leipzig and Munich.</i>

99
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:37,210
<i>These startling successes</i>
<i>have not been bought</i>

100
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:39,114
<i>without sorrow and suffering.</i>

101
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:42,120
<i>In this theater alone,</i>
<i>80,000 Americans</i>

102
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,485
<i>and comparable numbers</i>
<i>among the allies</i>

103
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,559
<i>have had their lives cut short</i>

104
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:51,255
<i>so that the rest of us might live</i>
<i>in the sunlight of freedom.</i>

105
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:04,104
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

106
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:06,746
What are we gonna do
when this is over?

107
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:09,109
I don't know.
Probably start another one.

108
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:13,481
That's what I love about this job.
A guaranteed future. I'm not wrong.

109
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:17,317
Believe me, we're descended
from a long line of noble predators.

110
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,492
You are irrepressible.

111
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:23,190
I think I'm gonna go be
irrepressible down with Fuller.

112
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:25,160
Come on, baby face.

113
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:29,962
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm irrepressible.

114
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:31,871
So, what are you writing?

115
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:34,371
Something Oppie said today.
I don't know.

116
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:36,373
Well, read it. Go on.

117
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,114
Makes you wonder
if there's an intelligence

118
00:08:42,283 --> 00:08:45,218
that isn't descended
from a long line of predators.

119
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:49,450
I want to kiss you.

120
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,948
Come here.

121
00:08:58,099 --> 00:09:02,433
Sir, is it true that since we KO'd
Germany, we're gonna go home?

122
00:09:02,603 --> 00:09:05,800
- I'll drink to that.
- That might be true, soldier.

123
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:12,540
Can I have your attention, please?
Please.

124
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:14,176
Excuse me.

125
00:09:14,348 --> 00:09:18,307
Seems to me that we have a shortage
of dance partners on the floor.

126
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:20,977
So as a tribute
to our men in uniform...

127
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:24,857
...l'd like to make
available the services

128
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:28,223
of all the longhairs at Los Alamos
on this dance floor.

129
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:31,365
And to break
the ceremonial ice,

130
00:09:31,532 --> 00:09:34,831
I will choose
the first dance partner.

131
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:44,874
General Groves...
may I have this dance?

132
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:49,446
Why not?

133
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:21,915
- Why do you have that with you?
- I keep it as a record for my dad.

134
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,075
If I wrote him a letter,
all he'd get is black lines.

135
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:27,516
This way I can tell him
what's going on.

136
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:30,054
And what are you gonna
write about today?

137
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,524
Besides the war being over?

138
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:34,956
Yeah.

139
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:40,527
Well, I met this girl.

140
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:46,365
Did I just kiss you up there?

141
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:57,306
You gotta bring your heads in out
of the clouds. Out of the clouds.

142
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,183
Keep the muttering to a minimum,
please, gentlemen.

143
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:06,758
Some of you dancing...

144
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:09,020
...close together.

145
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:13,189
I don't like the look of it.

146
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:18,865
There are...bosoms in the area.

147
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:24,008
And this could lead to pregnancy.

148
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:28,107
Any man getting caught out of hand
or getting caught in hand

149
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:31,308
will have to turn their peckers
over to the FBI.

150
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:42,856
They're having fun. That's nice.
They're entitled.

151
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:47,200
- So long as they don't think it's over.
- Isn't it?

152
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:51,235
I mean,
what's all the celebration for?

153
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:55,106
Perhaps we can find
some other use for this work.

154
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:56,504
Fascism's dead.

155
00:11:56,677 --> 00:11:58,406
You mean in Europe.

156
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:01,673
What do they think Japan
is doing, shooting squirrels?

157
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:05,512
No, they're not shooting squirrels,
and that's not the issue.

158
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:07,686
What is the issue?

159
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:12,286
They don't have the technology.
They're not capable of it.

160
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,451
So if we don't need it...

161
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:16,027
...why make it?

162
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:19,029
I want you to look at something.

163
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,768
It's the largest collection
of nothing in the entire world.

164
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:27,571
Make them work...

165
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,939
...and you've got something.

166
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:33,873
An irresistible something.

167
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:35,743
Just the threat...

168
00:12:37,318 --> 00:12:39,081
...and they're ours.

169
00:12:41,055 --> 00:12:43,285
You know, sometimes,

170
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:45,084
just standing here,

171
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:47,193
I keep wondering.

172
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:51,162
Are we working on them
or are they working on us?

173
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,636
Give them dignity, doctor.
Then we can start talking...

174
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,639
...about who can do what...

175
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:04,407
...and what they mean.

176
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:27,033
Oh, what time is it?

177
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:36,834
Even when I sleep, it's like dogs
tearing at a piece of meat.

178
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:40,007
Robert?

179
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:43,774
Thinking of resigning?

180
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:45,714
No.

181
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:50,353
I'd be written off.

182
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:54,153
They wouldn't understand.
Not in the present climate.

183
00:13:57,364 --> 00:14:01,266
I keep obsessing about the device.

184
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:05,097
Yes, it's true, but...

185
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:09,466
...if you think beyond...

186
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:14,441
...it's a limitless supply of energy.
Think about it, Kitty.

187
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:18,114
The power that drives the universe.

188
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:23,318
It's beyond imagination, really.

189
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,151
And we'd have tamed it.

190
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:29,558
A new world.

191
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:40,540
Go get them, cowboy.

192
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:57,484
What's going on over there?

193
00:14:57,658 --> 00:15:01,526
Cattle destroyed the entire ground
cable run. Ruined two days' work.

194
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:08,364
Why didn't they herd them outside
the site? Anyone suggest that?

195
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:13,438
The ranchers wouldn't move them.
Seems the Army stopped negotiating.

196
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:22,009
- This is out of control.
- Edward, these estimates...

197
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:25,208
Rush, push, speed, deadlines.

198
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:28,184
This whole project
has gotten out of control.

199
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:31,449
We haven't thought about
the consequences, Oppie.

200
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,286
- Oppie?
- Wilson!

201
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,361
We've been waiting
for the data for two weeks.

202
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,555
When are we gonna get it?

203
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:43,865
Wilson is correct.

204
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:47,496
We have to talk about what we're
all thinking but not saying.

205
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,905
This argument is arcane, Edward.

206
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:52,943
This thing is becoming real.

207
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:56,674
It's going to affect lives,
thousands of lives.

208
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,977
We have to start to talk.

209
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:01,986
All right. But not here.

210
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:05,216
At my home tonight.

211
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:17,229
<i>So now we tickle</i>
<i>the tail of the dragon.</i>

212
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:19,269
All right, take her up.

213
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:23,943
<i>I can only hope the uranium</i>
<i>slug doesn't get stuck in the pile.</i>

214
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:27,308
<i>If it does,</i>
<i>we'll probably all evaporate.</i>

215
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:30,482
- What's the reading?
- 1 .19-K.

216
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,354
- Waiting on your word.
- Meter's ready.

217
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:36,853
Ready when you are.

218
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,021
Let's go.

219
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:42,594
OK, let's tickle it.

220
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:52,669
It burst. It burst.

221
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:55,075
It burst right from here.

222
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:57,936
All right, add it up.

223
00:16:58,112 --> 00:16:59,773
Cigarette break.

224
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:01,906
Good job.

225
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,755
Michael. Hey, Michael.
You got a moment?

226
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:18,193
They won't let me in this place.
Still going to Chicago?

227
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:20,458
Yeah, Frisch can't pick the slugs up.

228
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:24,535
Great. There's something we'd
like you to pick up, if you can.

229
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:27,697
You know Leo Szilard, right?
And Ralph Lapp?

230
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,038
Well, about 20 of our other
colleagues from Chicago,

231
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:35,341
they're proposing a petition stating
they're opposed to the device.

232
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:39,916
They're concerned about
what they think's gonna happen.

233
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:45,286
So am I. I got a brother who's
in the Philippines right now.

234
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:47,689
I read the papers. I'm concerned.

235
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:51,763
I'm not asking you to endorse
anything. I haven't even read it yet.

236
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:55,596
It should be discussed.
All I'm asking is pick it up,

237
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:59,330
let us peruse it and make up
our own minds. How tough is that?

238
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:01,667
- Makes sense.
- It's only fair.

239
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:03,332
I'll pick it up for you.

240
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:06,146
- See you later.
- OK.

241
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:10,539
How can you rationalize
premeditated murder?

242
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:13,117
Oh, bullshit. Premeditated murder?

243
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:16,256
- This is a war. It's about winning.
- At what cost?

244
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:18,983
You can't just outlaw a weapon.

245
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:22,128
The more effective,
the more likely it will be used.

246
00:18:22,296 --> 00:18:24,730
We didn't use poison gas.
That was stopped.

247
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:27,958
You got to speak up.
The generals won't listen to us.

248
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:32,605
Yeah, and speak up on behalf
of all those kids hiding in foxholes.

249
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:36,209
I know what they'd say. The
Japanese brought this on themselves.

250
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,207
They have themselves to blame.

251
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:41,142
I wouldn't care if the place
went up in smoke...

252
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:43,681
Excuse me,
just for a minute, gentlemen.

253
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:47,615
And I resent your suggesting

254
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:49,813
I don't recognize a moral argument.

255
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,426
Why are you still awake?
Aren't you supposed to be sleeping?

256
00:18:53,594 --> 00:18:57,724
- I don't like sleeping.
- There are lots of things we don't like.

257
00:18:57,931 --> 00:19:01,992
We have to do them if we
want to do the things we do like.

258
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:05,228
- What's the treat tomorrow?
- Go horseback riding.

259
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:09,569
That's right. Now, how are you
going to ride a great big horse

260
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:11,734
if you don't get plenty of rest?

261
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:13,607
Go to sleep for Daddy?

262
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:16,014
That's a good boy.

263
00:19:23,657 --> 00:19:25,625
It is hot.

264
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:29,459
We could go to Carlucci's,
get some ice coffee and donuts.

265
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,689
The project is beginning to unravel.

266
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:34,561
- What?
- There have always been questions.

267
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:38,704
We've always avoided the answers.
Now, everything is coming to a head.

268
00:19:39,673 --> 00:19:41,368
- Bronson?
- Sir?

269
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,806
- Stop the car.
- Yes, sir.

270
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:47,469
- Get out, take a leak or something.
- This is a public park.

271
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:51,049
Well, pick some flowers.
I want to do some shouting.

272
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:01,358
It's a crisis.

273
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:03,325
A crisis of conscience.

274
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:07,494
All right. I'm not shouting.

275
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:10,270
I'm not even angry.

276
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:13,202
I am just stumped.

277
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:17,539
You want to sit on your hands,

278
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:19,338
polish your conscience,

279
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:24,041
when we might be able to end
this whole thing with one shot?

280
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:27,282
Crisis of conscience, huh?

281
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:28,944
All right.

282
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:30,384
Have it.

283
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:32,218
Take a bath in it.

284
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:33,654
Soak in it.

285
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:37,662
Then tell me whether you're
going to deliver them.

286
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:40,355
Whether you're gonna finish this job.

287
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:44,936
You tell me how I'm gonna face
a senate inquiry

288
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:49,542
and say we spent two billion dollars
on a show that's never gonna open.

289
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:52,171
Crisis of conscience.

290
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:56,942
You got one job, doctor.
Give me the bomb. Just give it to me.

291
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:59,842
Atrocious things have been done
in Germany

292
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,545
because people didn't speak out.

293
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:06,887
And we blame them for it. Right,
I think, even though it was dangerous.

294
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,824
But it's not dangerous
for us to speak out.

295
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:12,261
That's what a lot of us in Chicago feel.

296
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:15,902
You don't have to agree
with the contents of this petition.

297
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:18,435
You have to agree
it should be discussed.

298
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:20,800
- Yes, sir.
- Good boy, Michael.

299
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:23,903
Good seeing you again.

300
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:56,104
- It came in on the wire.
- What?

301
00:21:56,276 --> 00:22:00,440
Japanese are feeling out terms for
surrender. They made a proposition.

302
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:03,583
What kind of surrender?
Not unconditional?

303
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,684
Not according to my sources, no.

304
00:22:05,852 --> 00:22:07,285
Good.

305
00:22:07,454 --> 00:22:09,354
No one will buy it.

306
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:12,620
- Sir?
- Nothing.

307
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:15,956
Come on. Come on. Right here.

308
00:22:18,065 --> 00:22:21,159
Mr. Secretary, a brutal question.

309
00:22:21,735 --> 00:22:23,999
Are you and the president

310
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:25,536
looking to Russia,

311
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:29,267
figuring they'll come into Japan,
assuming there's an invasion?

312
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:32,310
If you are, you're not
gonna get that for nothing.

313
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:35,915
Russia's gonna want
Manchuria, Sakhalin.

314
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,976
I can give the president Japan.

315
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,154
No invasion, no deals.

316
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:43,887
Can you guarantee that?

317
00:22:44,057 --> 00:22:46,821
Some of your scientists
are getting out of line.

318
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:49,985
I hear they've been maneuvering
to see the president.

319
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:51,562
I didn't know that.

320
00:22:52,132 --> 00:22:53,963
I will take care of it.

321
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:58,001
- Very well. Do that, general.
- Mr. Secretary.

322
00:22:58,171 --> 00:22:59,934
Good night.

323
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:04,873
Panton?

324
00:23:06,747 --> 00:23:08,214
Dr. Oppenheimer had...

325
00:23:09,316 --> 00:23:13,878
...on three separate occasions,
meetings with suspected agents,

326
00:23:14,054 --> 00:23:15,954
communists, whatever.

327
00:23:16,123 --> 00:23:18,614
- He gave us one name, correct?
- Yes, sir.

328
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:20,987
Press him on the others.

329
00:23:21,962 --> 00:23:25,090
- He needs to feel the branch creak.
- Yes, sir.

330
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:27,266
- Ready?
- Yeah, we're ready.

331
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:35,272
They told me you were down here.
I was having lunch.

332
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:38,639
I got a call from Captain Panton.
A security problem again.

333
00:23:38,812 --> 00:23:41,679
Well, I'm being harassed,
and I'm sick of it.

334
00:23:41,848 --> 00:23:44,817
I had a security clearance.
This was a dead issue.

335
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:47,818
It's never dead with you.

336
00:23:47,988 --> 00:23:51,822
Though I will try to put a lid on it.
This is not gonna help.

337
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,055
- What's this?
- Some kind of petition

338
00:23:55,228 --> 00:23:59,995
from your boys in Chicago trying to go
around us to see the president.

339
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:03,834
That will never happen.

340
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:06,937
Do you know about this?

341
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:10,876
About the ideas, yes.

342
00:24:11,044 --> 00:24:14,275
They want to demonstrate
the device, not use it.

343
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:17,245
Is it containable?

344
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,612
Can you stop it?

345
00:24:22,422 --> 00:24:25,585
My hash is getting cold upstairs.

346
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,489
- Don't let these dodos distract you.
- How can...?

347
00:24:28,662 --> 00:24:33,656
Robert, you are this far away
from being the man who won the war.

348
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:35,835
These are important people
in Chicago.

349
00:24:36,036 --> 00:24:38,800
You can't ignore
what they have to say.

350
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:43,102
All they want is an opportunity
to talk about the demonstration.

351
00:24:43,276 --> 00:24:46,837
- What's his name? Szilard.
- Szilard.

352
00:24:47,013 --> 00:24:48,776
Sitting in the bathtub.

353
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:53,010
I should have drowned that
son of a bitch the first day I met him.

354
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:57,620
What's wrong with demonstrating?
What's wrong with not killing?

355
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:59,759
You vaporize some uninhabited atoll.

356
00:24:59,926 --> 00:25:02,656
Set terms of surrender,
then send the Japanese home.

357
00:25:03,096 --> 00:25:06,088
It's mush. It won't work.

358
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,393
They are kamikazes, all of them.

359
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:14,734
You had money in your background.
That explains it.

360
00:25:14,908 --> 00:25:17,001
- What does that mean?
- Your optimism.

361
00:25:17,177 --> 00:25:21,341
Faith in human nature.
I never had any. Money, that is.

362
00:25:21,514 --> 00:25:25,245
Never had a permanent house.
Made me a realist.

363
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:30,552
The idea should go to the president.

364
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:35,226
Where do you get these ideas?

365
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:37,886
You know, those boys in security...

366
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:41,067
...got a right to ask where
these ideas are coming from.

367
00:25:41,768 --> 00:25:47,707
Demonstrations, stopping work,
sharing with other countries.

368
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:50,572
You're gonna have
a tough time proving

369
00:25:50,744 --> 00:25:53,713
that those ideas
are coming out of Chicago.

370
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,371
- They are foreign, subversive.
- They're moral.

371
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:58,881
- Moral?
- Moral.

372
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:01,612
Was Pearl Harbor moral?

373
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:03,813
Poland, Munich, moral?

374
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,617
Death March of Bataan,
was that moral?

375
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:10,057
Junk!

376
00:26:11,097 --> 00:26:13,759
Demonstration junk.

377
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:17,198
I say you show the enemy
in the harshest terms

378
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:22,307
that you can muster, that you play
in the same league that they do.

379
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:28,169
At that meeting tomorrow there's
gonna be a vote on this demonstration.

380
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:31,579
There's gonna be a recommendation
going to the president.

381
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:33,275
Now, listen.

382
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,955
You can help yourself here.

383
00:26:38,024 --> 00:26:40,754
Steer it in the right direction.

384
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:45,456
You're either for us or against us.
Ernest, how are you?

385
00:26:45,665 --> 00:26:49,157
I'd like to introduce
Dr. Oppenheimer here.

386
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:52,736
Well, rumor has it
that we might owe you

387
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:55,568
for shaking those yellow monkeys
out of the trees.

388
00:26:55,742 --> 00:26:59,234
Save us a lot, not going to Japan.
My boys are gonna be grateful.

389
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:03,439
Yes, I'm pleased to shake
your hand. And thank you.

390
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:06,449
Doctor, I'd like to add my shake too.

391
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:08,746
Nice seeing you.

392
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:15,688
Did you hear what they said?

393
00:27:15,862 --> 00:27:20,822
You keep this on the track,
and we are gonna owe you, soldier.

394
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:09,272
<i>''We are in a completely new situation</i>
<i>that cannot be resolved by war.</i>

395
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,385
<i>''A petition to the president</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

396
00:28:13,553 --> 00:28:15,987
<i>''Discoveries of which the people</i>
<i>are not aware</i>

397
00:28:16,156 --> 00:28:19,353
<i>''may affect the welfare</i>
<i>of this nation in the near future.''</i>

398
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:23,557
The Russians are our allies.
If we drop this without telling them,

399
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,665
we could give them a paranoia
that will make us sick.

400
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:31,395
The Japanese are on their knees.
All this kamikaze stuff is a load of bull.

401
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:36,439
They're wet-pants scared of us just
like we're wet-pants scared of them.

402
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:40,010
This war seems to have forced
a lot of guys on both sides

403
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,774
to resign from the human race.

404
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:46,385
- I hope we're not about to do that.
- I agree.

405
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:51,846
Our blockade will finish Japan
by autumn, maybe even sooner.

406
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:55,620
This device is not an honorable way
to win a war.

407
00:28:55,762 --> 00:28:58,094
And I was taught to fight with honor.

408
00:28:58,298 --> 00:29:00,357
If Custer...

409
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,967
...had used the machine-gun...

410
00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:06,401
...his history would have been
written differently.

411
00:29:08,174 --> 00:29:10,472
If you go ahead,

412
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:15,671
particularly, if you drop this thing
with no prior warning...

413
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:19,808
...l, for one, will have to
resign my commission.

414
00:29:22,922 --> 00:29:25,755
Perhaps you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

415
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:38,436
Incidentally, what is the opinion of
the committee on a demonstration?

416
00:29:41,341 --> 00:29:44,105
Well, if we should agree
to a demonstration

417
00:29:44,277 --> 00:29:46,268
with the attendant
Japanese observers

418
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:50,075
and that demonstration failed,

419
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,947
not only would we be unable
to induce the Japanese to surrender,

420
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,453
we would face a critical
shortage of material.

421
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,891
The dropping of the device
has always been implicit in this project.

422
00:30:04,898 --> 00:30:09,096
So that is the advice I shall
pass on to the president.

423
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:11,668
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, that's right.

424
00:30:11,838 --> 00:30:13,703
Yes.

425
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:57,412
- Sam.
- Bob, welcome to Trinity.

426
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:59,415
- Here she is.
- Can I grab one?

427
00:30:59,586 --> 00:31:01,611
- It's all right.
- Good trip?

428
00:31:04,891 --> 00:31:07,223
- Are you the accountable officer?
- Yes.

429
00:31:07,393 --> 00:31:09,384
- This will be for you.
- What's that?

430
00:31:09,562 --> 00:31:12,463
It states that the University
of California hands over

431
00:31:12,665 --> 00:31:16,066
a plutonium core of a nuclear device
to the United States Army.

432
00:31:16,236 --> 00:31:20,673
Put more simply,
it's a bill for two billion dollars.

433
00:31:22,976 --> 00:31:25,911
Now, let me show you
what else your money's bought.

434
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:30,007
The initiator.

435
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:35,319
And the other half.

436
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:40,557
Now, all we gotta do
is throw them together and...

437
00:31:43,796 --> 00:31:46,788
Well, let's begin final assembly.

438
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:53,905
OK, Mr. Merriman.

439
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:08,383
Well, you're quiet.

440
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:14,290
It's coming close, what you're
working towards, isn't it?

441
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,621
Yeah.

442
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:20,425
I can feel it pressing down
on everybody.

443
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:23,466
There's something going on here.

444
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:28,834
It's got everybody mesmerized,
doesn't it?

445
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:31,033
Yeah.

446
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,907
There's a regular run
on sleeping pills and aspirin.

447
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:38,642
And it's not just the work,
it's something else.

448
00:32:41,988 --> 00:32:46,220
- Look, I know you can't talk about it.
- I can't.

449
00:32:46,392 --> 00:32:49,520
Well, then talk to Dr. Oppenheimer.

450
00:32:49,696 --> 00:32:53,063
I mean, if anyone has,
he'll have thought it through, right?

451
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:56,028
OK.

452
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,605
Touch me.

453
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:22,854
Naked.

454
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:25,554
Isn't that a beautiful word?

455
00:33:28,434 --> 00:33:30,902
Tonight.

456
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:33,629
I want to make love.

457
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:38,941
And I want a future.

458
00:33:39,112 --> 00:33:41,740
That's what I really want...

459
00:33:41,914 --> 00:33:44,212
...for you and me.

460
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:46,716
So do I.

461
00:33:49,155 --> 00:33:54,058
- Oh, for chrissake, George.
- This pitting, must be the mold.

462
00:33:54,227 --> 00:33:56,787
I'm not an explosives expert,
but I've been called

463
00:33:56,963 --> 00:33:59,124
to look at something
that's unacceptable.

464
00:33:59,332 --> 00:34:00,697
We must use hand lathings.

465
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,232
You should have used hand
lathings before.

466
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:05,894
- Hand lathings, you know what it is?
- Yes.

467
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:10,903
- Michael, what are you doing here?
- Chicago, Leo Szilard.

468
00:34:11,077 --> 00:34:13,739
I read it on the train.

469
00:34:13,913 --> 00:34:17,713
- Well, what do you think about it?
- It unnerved me.

470
00:34:19,252 --> 00:34:21,686
Are we gonna discuss this ever?

471
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:24,015
Amongst ourselves?

472
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:28,852
- Are we going on?
- I don't see anyone stopping.

473
00:34:29,028 --> 00:34:32,225
Now, look, we've been asked
to solve a technical problem,

474
00:34:32,432 --> 00:34:35,993
to build this device.
We're not responsible for its use.

475
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:39,535
Oppie, it's for you.

476
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:42,697
Peter's got revised figures.

477
00:34:49,415 --> 00:34:53,283
Look, let me keep this paper.

478
00:34:53,453 --> 00:34:57,412
We're expecting the initiator.
We need your lab results, all right?

479
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,251
All right?

480
00:34:59,425 --> 00:35:01,359
All right.

481
00:35:21,347 --> 00:35:23,110
Everybody ready?

482
00:35:23,282 --> 00:35:25,113
- Meter's ready.
- Here we go.

483
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:47,330
Twenty-one.

484
00:35:54,146 --> 00:35:56,080
Twenty-nine.

485
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:08,120
Thirty-one.

486
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:12,360
Thirty-eight.

487
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:17,595
Got it? Forty.
Everybody back, right now.

488
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:25,468
Behind the wall.

489
00:36:37,123 --> 00:36:38,784
Turn it off!

490
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:48,600
Nobody move! Don't anybody move!

491
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:54,938
Damn it!

492
00:36:55,107 --> 00:36:57,166
Take off everything metal. Drop it.

493
00:36:57,343 --> 00:37:00,369
Mark the positions
you're standing in and get out.

494
00:37:04,116 --> 00:37:05,640
The incident never happened.

495
00:37:05,818 --> 00:37:08,810
If anyone should ask,
it did not happen.

496
00:37:30,142 --> 00:37:32,508
Everybody should make it.

497
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:37,007
Except me.

498
00:37:37,183 --> 00:37:39,151
I'm dead.

499
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,738
Doctor! Doctor!
I've been looking all over for you.

500
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:06,469
We've got a problem.

501
00:38:06,646 --> 00:38:07,908
- Bad allergy.
- When?

502
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,514
- An hour ago. They're bringing him in.
- Who?

503
00:38:10,683 --> 00:38:11,945
Mr. Merriman.

504
00:38:12,118 --> 00:38:13,813
- Michael?
- Yes, sir.

505
00:38:13,986 --> 00:38:15,954
Oh, shit.

506
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:18,317
Let's go.

507
00:38:18,491 --> 00:38:21,392
- Come on, let's go!
- Yes, sir.

508
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:30,165
This one won't do.

509
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:36,836
- In here. This one's good.
- Take it easy. All right, all right.

510
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:40,445
- Michael, what's the matter?
- Nothing, everything's fine.

511
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:44,182
- Doctor, how much did he get?
- More than 1 ,000 rads.

512
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,147
- Goddamn it.
- What's happening?

513
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:49,879
Sweetheart, it's under control.
Everything's under control, OK?

514
00:38:50,923 --> 00:38:53,721
- Steven, what's going on?
- You should not be here.

515
00:38:53,893 --> 00:38:55,758
Excuse me, there's no patient here.

516
00:38:55,895 --> 00:38:58,728
No one's to hear about this.
Not Oppenheimer. Nobody.

517
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:02,367
- OK?
- Goddamn it, what happened here?

518
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:04,798
I want this ward sealed off.
Come with me.

519
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,734
I want military doctors in here.

520
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:19,742
Get the hell out of here!

521
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,848
It's the detonation circuits.

522
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,962
I don't know.
I would like another 24 hours.

523
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:35,133
I think so, but I can't be certain.

524
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:40,738
I said one more day.
I need one more day.

525
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:46,640
No, no, Merriman brought me
a copy from Chicago.

526
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:49,504
Some of the physicists
have signed it.

527
00:39:49,682 --> 00:39:53,584
Pinko fruitcakes. Get that thing
to work, I'm gonna drop it on Chicago.

528
00:39:53,753 --> 00:39:56,278
I swear I will.

529
00:39:56,455 --> 00:40:01,552
Yes, I hear you. You hear me?
Finish the damn thing. That's an order.

530
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:06,957
Well, I got other business.

531
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,726
But I got a plane. I'll be there.

532
00:40:09,935 --> 00:40:12,529
Every time I turn around,
somebody gets to him.

533
00:40:12,738 --> 00:40:15,707
Now they're talking about postponing.

534
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,379
- Cleared for Washington?
- Yes, sir. We are.

535
00:40:28,788 --> 00:40:32,189
''Truman, Stimson arrive Potsdam
for conference with Stalin.

536
00:40:32,358 --> 00:40:34,622
''Advise results of Trinity Test soonest.''

537
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:37,354
Stalin's gonna eat Truman alive
at this meeting.

538
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,124
- Unless we...
- Yes, unless...

539
00:40:40,332 --> 00:40:43,893
...we give the president something
lethal to stick in his back pocket.

540
00:40:44,103 --> 00:40:48,301
I'll tell you something
it won't be...postponement.

541
00:40:55,047 --> 00:40:59,143
Oh, Lord...so close.

542
00:41:02,054 --> 00:41:03,681
Sir.

543
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,336
Keep going down slow.

544
00:41:55,741 --> 00:41:59,006
His heart looks larger. Could be
fluid in the pericardial sac.

545
00:41:59,178 --> 00:42:00,873
- Radiation induced?
- Probably.

546
00:42:01,046 --> 00:42:03,344
It's almost doubled in size overnight.

547
00:42:03,515 --> 00:42:06,006
If this continues, his heart will drown.

548
00:42:06,185 --> 00:42:08,551
- Is he lucid?
- In and out.

549
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:12,418
There's tremendous brain swelling
from the radiation.

550
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:17,153
- What happens next?
- I don't know. I mean, I have no idea.

551
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:20,696
No human being's ever gotten
this dose of radiation before.

552
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,663
He's dying from the inside out.

553
00:42:22,868 --> 00:42:27,396
Other problems. His gastrointestinal
tract has been destroyed by radiation.

554
00:42:27,606 --> 00:42:29,870
Excuse me, doctors.

555
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:38,608
You've got to believe
we're doing everything we know how.

556
00:42:38,784 --> 00:42:40,217
Absolutely everything.

557
00:42:40,386 --> 00:42:44,049
It's not gonna do any good
to have you ripping yourself apart.

558
00:42:44,223 --> 00:42:47,886
- You've gotta go home and sleep.
- Richard, I can't.

559
00:43:46,986 --> 00:43:48,385
- Some orange.
- Sure is.

560
00:43:48,554 --> 00:43:50,021
Hey, Oppie?

561
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:05,436
Look out!

562
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,401
Hornig?

563
00:44:09,575 --> 00:44:11,839
- Hornig?
- It's all right.

564
00:44:12,011 --> 00:44:13,945
The other safety's holding.

565
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:19,649
Does anybody else need a martini?

566
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:25,251
- What's the word?
- Oppie, it doesn't look good.

567
00:44:25,424 --> 00:44:30,384
We have a chance of thunderstorms
over the next five days. I'm sorry.

568
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:34,831
I'm not telling you
what this guy's got up there.

569
00:44:55,187 --> 00:44:57,121
- Why wasn't I told?
- Too much panic.

570
00:44:57,289 --> 00:44:59,280
- How is he?
- Difficult to tell.

571
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:01,926
- I'd like to see him.
- We're not permitting visits.

572
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:04,722
But the men who were
with him have been spoken to.

573
00:45:04,897 --> 00:45:07,161
Security. Delicate time.

574
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:10,494
He's a strong young man.
He'll pull through.

575
00:45:11,737 --> 00:45:14,069
Schoenfield, how is he?

576
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:17,299
- Is he conscious?
- He's in and out.

577
00:45:17,476 --> 00:45:19,876
He wants to know
if you read the petition.

578
00:45:20,045 --> 00:45:24,072
- It means a lot to him.
- Yes, I have.

579
00:45:24,249 --> 00:45:27,241
And then, that's it? That's all?

580
00:45:27,419 --> 00:45:30,286
Yes, I have and then now
I wash my hands of it?

581
00:45:30,456 --> 00:45:32,117
Now wait a minute, Oppenheimer.

582
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:35,260
I got a friend falling apart
who thinks you got the answers.

583
00:45:35,427 --> 00:45:37,054
That's what you let him think.

584
00:45:37,229 --> 00:45:41,393
Do you know what the Christ is going
on, or is the whole thing out of control?

585
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,000
If you're trying to make a point,
what is it?

586
00:45:44,169 --> 00:45:47,161
I have spent the last
two years of my life

587
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:51,866
putting up with all your security
and your secrecy and your control.

588
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:55,036
I don't think that bullshit
was to keep what was going on

589
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,978
from the Germans
or the Japanese or the Russians.

590
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,550
It's to keep it from
American Jacks and Jills

591
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:02,949
because they may not
like what's going on.

592
00:46:03,122 --> 00:46:06,023
American people don't
want to know what's going on.

593
00:46:06,191 --> 00:46:08,591
They want to know
that their sons are alive.

594
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,593
I'm doing everything in my power
to see that they do.

595
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,658
Like Oak Ridge, where they're
injecting ill and old

596
00:46:14,867 --> 00:46:17,199
people with huge doses of plutonium?

597
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:20,099
I don't know about Oak Ridge,
but if you want to ask

598
00:46:20,272 --> 00:46:23,241
what's happening, ask this:
Will it be big enough?

599
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:27,074
Big enough to scare all of us
and make us stop and think?

600
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:31,273
Big enough to stop all war forever?
You want to ask a question, ask that.

601
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,749
Look, I've seen Oak Ridge, all right?

602
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,946
That place wasn't built
to make one or two bombs.

603
00:46:38,123 --> 00:46:41,490
It was built to make
thousands of them. Thousands.

604
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,390
And soon everybody's
gonna have a bomb. They will.

605
00:46:44,563 --> 00:46:48,329
What do they do with them?
Sit and wait till they go off, until ''boom''?

606
00:46:48,534 --> 00:46:51,128
Then we got one world
full of Michael Merrimans

607
00:46:51,336 --> 00:46:54,703
dying from the inside out.
Is that what you're looking for?

608
00:46:54,873 --> 00:46:58,468
Because that's the future
you've made for us.

609
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:03,442
Hey, Oppenheimer! Oppenheimer,
you ought to stop playing God

610
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:08,075
because you are not good at it
and the position is taken.

611
00:47:19,498 --> 00:47:23,764
His pressure's falling fast.
You've got to get that fluid out now.

612
00:47:28,373 --> 00:47:30,307
Needle, Michael.

613
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:34,177
OK, you're in. Start to pull it back.

614
00:47:34,346 --> 00:47:36,314
Hang in, Michael.

615
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:40,317
Hang in, pal.

616
00:47:41,587 --> 00:47:43,817
Come on, doc.

617
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:48,760
Pressure's starting to rise.
It's coming up slowly.

618
00:48:08,714 --> 00:48:12,741
- Robert, you have to get some sleep.
- God.

619
00:48:12,918 --> 00:48:15,512
I'm in a dark place.

620
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:19,555
We've all cooked this stew.

621
00:48:19,725 --> 00:48:26,654
The Germans and the Japanese
and the Americans and the Brits.

622
00:48:27,499 --> 00:48:31,128
It's an ugliness that goes back.
It goes way back.

623
00:48:31,903 --> 00:48:34,872
I'm not a scientist anymore.

624
00:48:35,807 --> 00:48:39,868
I'm a goddamn functionary.

625
00:48:41,113 --> 00:48:44,014
I've got to stay in control.

626
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:47,083
I've got to control who gets this thing.

627
00:48:47,986 --> 00:48:52,150
Power and control,
it's all I ever hear about anymore.

628
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:55,751
Doesn't life matter to you?

629
00:48:55,861 --> 00:48:58,352
What about love and understanding?

630
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:02,055
I thought that's what science
was all about.

631
00:49:02,267 --> 00:49:05,236
I just wanted us to work.

632
00:49:05,437 --> 00:49:10,374
Does everything have to be
sacrificed to this...thing?

633
00:49:12,544 --> 00:49:15,069
I put up with...

634
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,817
...Jean,

635
00:49:20,986 --> 00:49:24,183
because I thought you needed her.

636
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:28,692
And I thought you'd give
her up because of me.

637
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:33,262
But she didn't count.

638
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:40,303
I don't count. Nothing counts for you
anymore except this damn bomb.

639
00:49:40,972 --> 00:49:43,440
That's what it is.

640
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:46,907
But it's not your only creation.

641
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:49,707
There are the children.

642
00:49:51,149 --> 00:49:56,018
And you need my love and support.
I know.

643
00:49:56,922 --> 00:49:59,015
I don't...

644
00:49:59,191 --> 00:50:02,160
I don't know where it is.

645
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:04,759
Why me?

646
00:50:07,165 --> 00:50:09,656
Why did he pick me?

647
00:50:32,758 --> 00:50:34,783
- Panton!
- Sir?

648
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,657
Security's a mess. Nobody at
the checkpoint. Nobody up here.

649
00:50:38,864 --> 00:50:41,662
- What do you think this is, a beach?
- No, sir.

650
00:50:41,867 --> 00:50:44,802
We've got to call a halt.
The weather is unpredictable.

651
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,461
We are not calling a halt
on account of weather.

652
00:50:47,672 --> 00:50:51,369
With the wind we could send
radioactive junk all the way to Amarillo.

653
00:50:51,543 --> 00:50:55,309
You <i>The New York Times</i> reporter?
I want three reports.

654
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,745
One if we succeed, one if we fail
and one if we disintegrate.

655
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:02,717
With the wind blowing this direction,
Amarillo could get a fallout.

656
00:51:02,888 --> 00:51:05,379
- Fermi's right.
- No, I'm saying no.

657
00:51:05,557 --> 00:51:08,856
The decision is mine!

658
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:11,018
- Do you understand?
- We can't do it.

659
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:14,495
We go ahead with this. Sergeant,
do something about that dog.

660
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:17,293
You sound like you're planning
a railway schedule.

661
00:51:17,502 --> 00:51:21,131
No, you are trying to uninvent this.

662
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,873
I can do it without you.

663
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:28,673
Well, if you do and I've said no
and something goes wrong...

664
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:32,077
Get in the car.

665
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,582
Hurry up.
What are you waiting on?

666
00:52:00,011 --> 00:52:03,947
Sir, it looks like it's clearing up.

667
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:28,772
You know, you build to a moment,

668
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,603
and then you grab it,
or it will go right by you.

669
00:52:34,145 --> 00:52:37,546
You always thought that
I would do this, didn't you?

670
00:52:37,716 --> 00:52:40,310
Can you buck your own nature?

671
00:52:42,721 --> 00:52:45,212
What will it be like?

672
00:52:47,492 --> 00:52:49,960
Unimaginable.

673
00:52:52,364 --> 00:52:54,662
It's your baby.

674
00:53:05,243 --> 00:53:07,507
Do it.

675
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:10,941
Hallelujah.

676
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:14,080
He said it's a go.

677
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:16,243
Let's go.

678
00:53:16,688 --> 00:53:20,249
Start the countdown.
Come on. It's a go.

679
00:53:20,425 --> 00:53:23,917
- Let's go! Move it out!
- Wilson, wake up!

680
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:28,156
- Wake up the dragon.
- Let's go. Let's go.

681
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:45,577
Power on.

682
00:53:46,051 --> 00:53:49,350
- Power on.
- Synchronization relays one open.

683
00:53:49,754 --> 00:53:51,619
Synchronization relay one open.

684
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:57,285
- Synchronization relays two open.
- Synchronization relays two open.

685
00:54:13,945 --> 00:54:16,505
I love you, Michael.

686
00:54:23,622 --> 00:54:25,783
Easy.

687
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,691
Breathe easy.

688
00:54:46,645 --> 00:54:48,977
Easy.

689
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:52,472
Easy, come back to the ice.

690
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,380
It's OK, here's the ice.

691
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:07,929
Kathleen, what are you doing in here?

692
00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:10,795
Kathleen? God!

693
00:55:11,002 --> 00:55:13,436
Come on, come on, sweetheart.

694
00:55:14,973 --> 00:55:18,875
- You simply can't be here, sweetheart.
- I had to be with him.

695
00:55:19,044 --> 00:55:23,413
I wanted to tell him I love him,
because he's going to die.

696
00:55:29,187 --> 00:55:30,848
Detonation relays four open.

697
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:37,157
Well, it's armed.

698
00:55:37,328 --> 00:55:41,128
- Now it's up to the bunker.
- Let's get down from here.

699
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:55,572
Well, I've always believed
that the Lord was on our side.

700
00:55:55,747 --> 00:55:58,443
And I think now we're gonna prove it.

701
00:56:38,556 --> 00:56:42,583
- Must be from the military base.
- Enrico, what do you bet on the yield?

702
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:45,127
I bet we set fire to the atmosphere.

703
00:56:45,296 --> 00:56:47,662
If we're lucky,
we only wipe out New Mexico.

704
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:53,304
If we can ignite the air,
we finish off the planet. Any takers?

705
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:56,674
I kind of hope the damn thing
doesn't go off.

706
00:56:57,942 --> 00:56:59,671
What the hell is that?

707
00:57:00,145 --> 00:57:03,114
It's <i>The Nutcracker Suite</i>.

708
00:57:03,982 --> 00:57:05,847
I can't get rid of it.

709
00:57:06,518 --> 00:57:08,918
- Go to six-five.
- Six-five.

710
00:57:09,954 --> 00:57:12,514
- OK, try seven.
- Seven.

711
00:57:13,158 --> 00:57:15,217
Charging the device.

712
00:57:24,102 --> 00:57:26,468
Robert, over here.

713
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,938
The device is fully charged.

714
00:57:35,446 --> 00:57:39,382
It is now zero minus 60 seconds.
Fifty-nine, 58,

00:57:43,555 --> 00:57:49,926
- 53, 52, 51 , 50, 49...
- Where is that music coming from?

718
00:57:50,094 --> 00:57:52,995
It's a ground channel.
I can't get rid of it.

719
00:57:53,198 --> 00:57:58,192
44, 43, 42, 41 , 40...

720
00:57:58,403 --> 00:58:00,701
Goddamn music.

721

<i>Kathleen, my love.</i>
<i>You asked me a question once.</i>

730
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,569
<i>Was it instinct to save a life</i>
<i>or to take it?</i>

<i>Well, I don't know, my darling.</i>
