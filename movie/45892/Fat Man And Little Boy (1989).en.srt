1
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,424
At ease.

2
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:45,099
Move it, move it, move it!

3
00:01:50,548 --> 00:01:53,038
One, two, three.

4
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:57,779
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

5
00:01:57,954 --> 00:02:03,482
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny! Hoorah!

6
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,924
Boy, those Japs better watch out
for you, sir. Good luck.

7
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:09,495
The Corps of Engineers
is gonna miss you, sir.

8
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:12,362
- Thank you, gentlemen. Bronson.
- Sir.

9
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,830
I built this place,
so I'll be glad to eat it.

10
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:21,277
Well done, sir.

11
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,007
You're a lucky man.
Give those Japs hell.

12
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:26,077
Thank you, Thomas.

13
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,579
Indeed, I will.

14
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,582
Sir!

15
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,750
I'm losing my chance
to get out from behind a desk

16
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:41,885
- and lead men in combat!
- Colonel Groves, forget it. This has...

17
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:44,429
Even Bronson
wants to head for the front.

18
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,033
Forget about the front.
You're an engineer.

19
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,999
You're gonna fight your war here.

20
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:54,901
Is this what you're assigning me to,
this boondoggle? Dead end?

21
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:58,839
This dead end, Groves, has the
personal backing of the president.

22
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,946
This is not what I was promised,
not what I expected.

23
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:05,643
Then bone up on it.
Head to Chicago, talk to the scientist.

24
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,879
If it looks possible, run with it.

25
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:12,322
Take whoever you want. Have
whatever you need. Just make it work.

26
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:15,517
Who knows, you might just win
this war on your own.

27
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,323
Pick up a star on the way.

28
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:54,798
...fighting for, and they are reported
to be giving the Germans hell.

29
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:59,097
Though these losses represent the
most serious setbacks for the Allies

30
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,274
in this war
against the Nazi enemy.

31
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:05,602
Bad news, too,
from the war in the Pacific.

32
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:09,769
We have just had confirmation of
the sinking of three US cruisers.

33
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:12,782
Names are being withheld.
The casualties are high.

34
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,441
Come in!

35
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:19,021
Reports of an early-morning raid
by Japanese dive-bombers...

36
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:22,785
In here.
In here!

37
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,793
- Szard?
- Szilard.

38
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:29,730
General Groves, I was expecting you.
Come in! Come in!

39
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:43,775
Forgive me.
Sometimes I get stuck in here.

40
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:45,972
Metaphorically.

41
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:47,980
I've read this.

42
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:51,417
- Is it possible?
- You couldn't put a little more hot in,

43
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,248
could you?

44
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:06,662
And I'm not very good at fairy tales,
so just give me the happy ending.

45
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,871
What I wrote is possible,
probably inevitable.

46
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:18,177
Separate uranium 235,
then arrange for two portions

47
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:22,840
of the element to be brought together
suddenly, so that the resulting mass,

48
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,113
no bigger than this, general,

49
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:29,052
undergoes a spontaneous
self-generating reaction.

50
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:33,924
And if this was the epicenter
of that explosion...

51
00:05:34,863 --> 00:05:39,733
...all of Chicago you could see
from here would disintegrate.

52
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:42,236
Hallelujah.

53
00:05:42,435 --> 00:05:47,339
At the moment, all we have
are theories, concepts, inspirations,

54
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:50,944
- inconclusive results...
- Now, if we can make this device,

55
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:53,206
- so can the Krauts.
- Yes.

56
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:55,781
Germany has the scientific capability.

57
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,581
And, general,
we need leadership here.

58
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:01,278
- I can help!
- Thank you.

59
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:03,356
You need an ally, general!

60
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:13,598
- So tell us about this general.
- Why?

61
00:06:13,902 --> 00:06:16,425
Because it's so mysterious.

62
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:19,003
"Meet me in the middle
of God-knows-where.

63
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:24,633
"Be there no earlier than 4:20,
no later than 4:29."

64
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:26,801
Well, word has it

65
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:28,882
he's a provincial windbag

66
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:32,608
who's spent most of his life
digging holes in Latin America.

67
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:35,616
- Graves for the natives, no doubt.
- Oh, Frank.

68
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:38,622
Seriously, Kitty, after all,
Robert's a scientist.

69
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:41,919
If the Army wants him,
they'll want all of him.

70
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:44,859
All of him?
Why not take all of him?

71
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:48,033
Look, I have to at least hear
what he has to offer.

72
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:51,170
- Robert, must we go so fast?
- Yes!

73
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:55,272
- It's crazy.
- Yes! Yes!

74
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:05,581
This way, Dr. Oppenheimer.

75
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,133
Doctor!

76
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,970
Up here!

77
00:07:33,277 --> 00:07:37,806
Groves, Leslie. Friends call me Dick.
Sit down.

78
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:41,841
Ingenuity.

79
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:46,251
I love it.
Created out of nothing but up here.

80
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,084
Clear!

81
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:56,229
The old man likes his privacy,
doesn't he?

82
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,519
Guess what.

83
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:23,589
- The egghead wants a carrot juice.
- Get him what he wants, Bronson!

84
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:25,022
Get used to it.

85
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:28,321
What an eight ball this guy is.

86
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:32,500
Seems this Oppenheimer's
a hot number.

87
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:35,968
Says here, he's got more damn brains
than are decent.

88
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:40,406
He knows it too. Temperamental. He
ain't gonna be an easy horse to corral.

89
00:08:40,577 --> 00:08:43,773
Oh, I think the general
knows what he's doing.

90
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:46,009
Oppenheimer ain't one of us.

91
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,276
The general picks that guy,
he'll be making a mistake.

92
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,757
It needs to get pulled together.

93
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:04,190
So I think you're the man for the job.

94
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:10,065
And I got a weakness for good men.

95
00:09:12,473 --> 00:09:16,000
The Krauts are working on this,
full bore.

96
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:19,510
If they get it before we do,
I don't have to spell it out.

97
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:21,705
Where would you start?

98
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:23,574
Focus.

99
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:27,418
You have great minds,
but all dancing to a different tune.

100
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:31,718
You bring them together in one place,
isolate them, no distractions.

101
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:34,485
You create an atmosphere
of creative stress.

102
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:37,756
Everyone competing
to solve one problem.

103
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:39,762
And you have one ringmaster.

104
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:45,068
Right now, it's all over the place.
You centralize everything.

105
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:47,171
There is a hitch.

106
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,801
There are people out there
don't like the color of your politics.

107
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:53,207
My politics...

108
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,280
...are an open book.

109
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:59,307
Well, I hope so.

110
00:09:59,486 --> 00:10:03,387
You could win a war
and the Nobel Prize, God willing.

111
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:06,855
Sir, Major de Silva
wanted me to remind you

112
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:09,526
you've got a train to catch
at 1800 hours.

113
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:11,754
No rest for the wicked.

114
00:10:14,232 --> 00:10:16,134
Oh, doctor.

115
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:22,571
If you take this on,
I say this in all humility, intellect...

116
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:25,309
...don't outrank that.

117
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:31,608
This general is a meatball,
a cipher.

118
00:10:31,783 --> 00:10:34,877
He'd be eating out of the palm
of my hand in a week.

119
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:37,043
So will you accept?

120
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:43,954
There are questions.
There are a kaleidoscope of questions.

121
00:10:45,764 --> 00:10:47,492
I see.

122
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:51,995
Well, I'm a star
at breakfast small talk.

123
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,435
You'll have to save some for evenings if
you're gonna be wife of the big cheese.

124
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:59,199
Would this mean moving?

125
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:02,806
Oh, you have to say yes.

126
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,473
You're too brilliant for Berkeley.

127
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:12,522
Michelangelo's The Creation
of Adam. Origin and destiny.

128
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,893
Origins and destiny.

129
00:11:17,058 --> 00:11:20,461
The struggle to unearth the one
and to discover the other.

130
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:22,461
That is science!

131
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:25,931
And as I leave here
to unravel my own small destiny,

132
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,504
I congratulate each of you
on being the best of the best.

133
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:31,572
I have faith in you all.

134
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:36,201
God keep you, and may your lives
be rich and sweet.

135
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,437
- Thank you.
- We'll miss you, Oppie!

136
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:40,445
We'll miss you, Oppie!

137
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,584
Good luck, Oppie!

138
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:08,776
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!

139
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:12,142
Let's move that thing out back.

140
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,955
Sir!

141
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:57,724
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Give me the good news, Jack.

142
00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:00,220
We've got utilities on
throughout camp.

143
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:04,353
We've got the sewage problem taken
care of. We have water throughout.

144
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:07,522
- Got the two science buildings...
- Not good enough.

145
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,964
We gotta be
a couple of weeks behind.

146
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:12,900
You know, I got a bunch
of scientists up there.

147
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:15,801
They're just wandering,
bumping into each other.

148
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:19,569
Get some bodies in here. In a week,
I wanna be two weeks ahead.

149
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:22,042
I don't think we have
accommodations, sir.

150
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:24,205
Why would they want
accommodations?

151
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:25,713
You think they'll sleep?

152
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:30,679
All right, get some tents,
but put it on your EOR.

153
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:34,123
Didn't I ask for dogs
around that perimeter fence?

154
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:35,987
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see any.

155
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,923
They're coming, general.

156
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:46,294
So...

157
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,568
...whatever goes on around here
is privileged information.

158
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:58,079
No exceptions. No wives, no barbers.
No exceptions!

159
00:13:58,783 --> 00:14:00,750
What you see,

160
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:06,012
what you hear, what you read,
what you dream about,

161
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,191
whatever...

162
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:13,119
...gives you heartburn or feeds your
ulcers, whatever gives you the sweats,

163
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:16,062
keeps you up at night, whatever,

164
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:18,032
all of that...

165
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:22,694
...belongs to the United States Army.

166
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:27,899
Or to me, if that makes you feel
more comfortable.

167
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:32,376
Now, you gotta come down
out of the clouds, gentlemen,

168
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:36,813
and get into the business
of winning a war.

169
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:41,447
I'm gonna say it once.
I'm only gonna say it once.

170
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:45,117
Those of you who know, know.
Those of you who don't, don't.

171
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:50,254
You are not here to be comfortable.

172
00:14:51,101 --> 00:14:52,626
All right?

173
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:57,933
You are here

174
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,803
to go beyond the theoretical,

175
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:04,842
the speculative, the fanciful.

176
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:11,418
You are here to harness
your God-given talents,

177
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:13,885
your minds, your energy,

178
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:18,515
in the practical pursuit of one thing:

179
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,052
A military weapon.

180
00:15:21,229 --> 00:15:23,026
Nuclear one.

181
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,457
An atomic bomb.

182
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:30,401
Keep the muttering
to just a minimum, gentlemen.

183
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:34,298
Why bother with a bomb?
Why not just drop that man on Berlin?

184
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,672
- When you talk about it...
- It will have the same effect.

185
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,976
...it will be referred to as "the gadget"
or "the device".

186
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:44,912
Is that clear?

187
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:50,212
There is one word
that I don't wanna hear.

188
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:52,890
And that's the word "impossible".

189
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:56,823
- You're two days late.
- I went to 109 East Palace Street

190
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,729
to report to Mrs. McKibben,
but there was nobody there.

191
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:06,304
So I hopped a construction bus, and it
damn near drove me back to Chicago.

192
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:11,705
I've been sitting on trains, buses,

193
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:16,245
railway stations for 60 hours.

194
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,784
I asked about this place in Santa Fe,
and they said it didn't exist.

195
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:23,650
It doesn't.

196
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:32,353
So where does a fellow
get some chow around here, huh?

197
00:16:32,531 --> 00:16:36,092
- We already ate.
- Oh, great.

198
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:39,669
Oh, if you wanna take a shower,
I'd take one now.

199
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,808
They turn off the water at 2:00.

200
00:16:48,546 --> 00:16:52,573
Keep those two men back there.
We still gotta run the power through.

201
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:55,214
Yeah, you two men there!

202
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,089
Higher! A little more.

203
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,128
All right, that'll do it.

204
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:07,992
Open this door, now!

205
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:11,368
Sorry. I couldn't get in.

206
00:17:11,537 --> 00:17:14,972
Give it a month, you'll do that
because you can't get out.

207
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:16,401
- You Merriman?
- Yeah.

208
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:19,974
Richard Schoenfield.
I'm the doctor around here.

209
00:17:20,178 --> 00:17:24,239
You're just what I'm looking for
in a roommate, a little brute strength.

210
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,683
Holy shit!

211
00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:31,254
- What in God's name is this?
- It looks like a fridge.

212
00:17:31,422 --> 00:17:33,251
Oh, yeah, it does.

213
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:35,220
It looks stuck.

214
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:38,954
I guess you arrived just in time then.
Thank God you're here.

215
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,188
Which end would you like?

216
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,531
Are you ready?

217
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,500
- You want me to get it myself?
- Lift.

218
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:08,653
Oppie's boys.
No problem left unsolved.

219
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:15,161
Gentlemen, this project
has been separated into three areas.

220
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:17,698
The physics.
How much material do we need?

221
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:20,665
Should it be plutonium
or uranium 235?

222
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:24,236
Second, manufacture of material,
but that's out of our hands.

223
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:27,408
That's Oak Ridge, Tennessee
and Hanford. And third,

224
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,975
our responsibility,
and this is a cinch...

225
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:31,805
Yeah, sure.

226
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:36,280
...build the device, test it,
and just hope that we can control it.

227
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:38,680
Gentlemen, we are here...

228
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:44,585
...at the beginning.
Our objective is here.

229
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:47,317
We have a deadline of 19 months.

230
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:52,696
19 months?
It seems such a short time.

231
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:56,099
19 months coincides
with our anticipated delivery date

232
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:59,569
from Oak Ridge. Gentlemen,
we have 19 months, that's it...

233
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,401
...to box, wrap
and deliver this package.

234
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:05,541
Are there any dissenters?

235
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,139
No?

236
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,213
Good.

237
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:15,487
Nineteen months
and starting from scratch, Jesus.

238
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:20,252
Still, Oppie's got the best theoreticians
and engineers in the world.

239
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:25,055
Some of these guys are legends and
so young. The place is a hothouse.

240
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,723
Doc, he seems like
he's gonna be a good man.

241
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:32,269
Reckons we'll be working with funny
stuff. He's gonna be looking out for us.

242
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:36,169
He's got a whole wing of the hospital
that looks like Noah's Ark.

243
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:40,567
I think of Jimmy fighting in the
Philippines, and I can't complain.

244
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,217
I love you, but I gotta go.
General wants a progress report.

245
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:46,944
When Groves wants something,
he wants it now.

246
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,746
Again.

247
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,253
We build a cannon, and at the end

248
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:56,588
weld a stopper
made from a subcritical mass.

249
00:19:56,763 --> 00:20:00,858
We fabricate a shell
made from another subcritical mass

250
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:03,023
and fire it down the barrel.

251
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,838
- How much of both materials?
- Projecting 30 pounds.

252
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:10,030
30 pounds is as far away
as the moon.

253
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:13,369
We're trying to tap the energy
that fuels the universe.

254
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:16,710
It's petrifying. All we've got
so far are problems,

255
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,284
and that doesn't include the ones
we haven't thought about.

256
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,216
Shake down the bad news.
I'm getting used to it.

257
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,413
At the moment, there are
two problems. Pre-detonation.

258
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:29,116
The gadget disintegrates
before it explodes.

259
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,660
Second, it's the weight problem.

260
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:34,491
For the slug to travel at the velocity
we need,

261
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,099
the gun barrel
would be so heavy, so thick,

262
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:40,897
I don't think we'd get the gadget
off the ground with a crane.

263
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:44,505
If they're talking about a slug
with a seven-inch diameter,

264
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:48,576
then you'd have to have a barrel
thickness of at least four inches.

265
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:57,081
I hope you guys find the music.

266
00:20:57,252 --> 00:20:59,813
The way things are,
we can't even hum the tune.

267
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:01,685
Free discussion.
Two groups...

268
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:04,223
- I'm not comfortable with...
- Excuse me.

269
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:08,353
Seth, Deke, the gun barrel.
Robert, Michael, pre-detonation.

270
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:15,804
Damn it! Just, damn it!
Maybe it's the altitude.

271
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,506
But we're still just chalk
on a blackboard.

272
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:20,572
We're dead in the water.

273
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,277
Maybe we cast a lighter
gun barrel, find a new alloy.

274
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:26,140
The force would be too great.

275
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:30,649
We gotta smack these atoms together
to trigger a chain reaction.

276
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,017
We gotta concentrate the energy
and crush the mass.

277
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:37,159
All right, let's rethink this.

278
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:41,090
We have a gun barrel that's so heavy
we can't lift it with a plane.

279
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:44,322
To get the explosive power we need,
it's gotta be heavy.

280
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:46,667
Michael, come here!

281
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:50,032
When I squeeze this...

282
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:53,073
- ... what do I get?
- Juice.

283
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:57,200
No. I squeeze it, I get compression.

284
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:00,211
We get a hollow sphere
of plutonium,

285
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,715
and we compress it
with an explosion that goes in.

286
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:06,182
- An implosion.
- Chain reaction.

287
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:08,150
Boom!

288
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:12,052
- But, Seth, explosives go out.
- I know.

289
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:15,159
But we make one that goes in.

290
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:19,059
Jesus.

291
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:21,030
- Michael.
- Let's get the boys.

292
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:23,294
We'll meet down here in the canteen.

293
00:22:23,504 --> 00:22:28,167
It's brilliant. The device is gonna be so
light that we don't need a gun barrel!

294
00:22:28,742 --> 00:22:31,871
Got a match, soldier?

295
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:45,016
Sir, it's Michael and Seth!

296
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:49,160
I'm sorry to bother you.

297
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:52,263
But Seth had an idea.
He was thinking of an orange.

298
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:55,764
Yes, I was thinking of jumping
up and down on an orange.

299
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:57,869
- Crushing an orange.
- Crushing!

300
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:01,164
Crushing... the core.

301
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,139
Oh, God.
This could be very sweet.

302
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:07,906
- Where are the others?
- Canteen, they wanna kick it around.

303
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,278
- Perhaps it can wait till later?
- No, you go ahead.

304
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,284
- I'd have lost you anyway.
- Thank you.

305
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:23,357
Goddamn it.

306
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,805
Doctor!

307
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:47,675
- Come on!
- Double up, over here!

308
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:51,686
I'm sorry. We were looking for testing
sites and the bus got stuck.

309
00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:55,916
You had a meeting last night.
You discussed the work in public.

310
00:23:56,094 --> 00:23:58,188
We were discussing
Neddermeyer's...

311
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:01,261
- In public!
- A table in the back of the canteen.

312
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,161
- We were having a free discussion.
- Let's just talk about that.

313
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:08,701
I don't want free discussion.
I want compartmentalization.

314
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,706
I don't want theoreticians
knowing what engineers know.

315
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:16,334
- Listen to me...
- It is a security problem!

316
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:20,142
These kids are used to pinning
their best ideas on a board.

317
00:24:20,318 --> 00:24:24,015
Ideas are community property.
It's a matter of principle.

318
00:24:24,388 --> 00:24:27,788
You force my hand and there
won't be any free discussion

319
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:31,358
because there won't be anybody left
to have it!

320
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:35,720
If you'd been there you'd understand.
Neddermeyer's idea was brilliant.

321
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,730
An explosion that goes inwards,

322
00:24:37,901 --> 00:24:41,564
producing uniform compression
in a core and it'd be lightweight.

323
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:44,534
No gun barrel,
no velocity and weight problem.

324
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:47,335
And all of that
out of free discussion.

325
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:50,070
You've got to give us room
to breathe.

326
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,642
- Bronson?
- Sir?

327
00:24:54,817 --> 00:24:57,376
Just don't give it to the waitresses.

328
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:08,453
Oppie's quite a match
for the general.

329
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:13,192
I'm worried it's not in Groves' nature
to rest until he gets the upper hand.

330
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:15,527
We're terrified the Germans
are ahead.

331
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:19,572
Working with restrictions
and regulations is setting us on edge.

332
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:23,177
This is typical.
We are people, not numbers!

333
00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:25,607
It's not part of the agreement,
general.

334
00:25:25,778 --> 00:25:28,977
I apologize for complaints,
but barbed wire,

335
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,912
dogs, guards!

336
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:33,281
- Security badges!
- Secrets!

337
00:25:33,455 --> 00:25:36,514
I hoped to leave these things in Italy
with Mussolini!

338
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:39,523
Openness is a principle
matter for scientists!

339
00:25:39,726 --> 00:25:43,822
And there are many other things.
I resent my letters are being censored.

340
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,931
The FBI talking to me, that's one
thing. But my wife, my family,

341
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,094
that's a little much.
Don't you think?

342
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:54,504
We cannot continue work
under these conditions!

343
00:25:54,676 --> 00:25:57,108
- Doctor.
- And what about...?

344
00:26:08,288 --> 00:26:12,585
Well, that is some monkey house
in there.

345
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:15,295
A mess.
What are you gonna do about it?

346
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:17,554
I warned you about this.

347
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:24,103
Look, you give me responsibility
for security inside the lab.

348
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,795
We go where we like, as we like,
when we like.

349
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:29,465
Outside the lab, that's yours.

350
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:32,608
I will sell them on that.

351
00:26:34,245 --> 00:26:40,184
I don't like it.
But I will live with it, for now.

352
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,751
The 8th Air Force today

353
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:54,362
carried out its heaviest bombing
of the war against Germany.

354
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:57,990
Michael! Michael. What do you say?
Good to see you.

355
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:01,034
- How are you?
- I brought Kathleen with me.

356
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:05,301
I was afraid this party would be
a little short on the beauty side,

357
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:10,071
so I took the appropriate precautions,
if you know what I'm saying.

358
00:27:10,648 --> 00:27:14,550
- I mean, she is my favorite nurse.
- You two gonna get together?

359
00:27:16,654 --> 00:27:20,613
No. No, we're not.
Actually, I'm gonna get a drink.

360
00:27:20,826 --> 00:27:26,092
That's what I'm gonna get. A good
stiff drink, that's all I'm gonna get.

361
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:31,663
- Two bucks...
- It's a short bet.

362
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:35,800
- Like I said...
- This is stuck.

363
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:39,169
...it can be pretty lonely here.

364
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,206
There's a war on.

365
00:27:41,378 --> 00:27:44,404
Not everybody can go to Acapulco.

366
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:54,358
- Oh, my.
- Are you OK?

367
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,193
Good.
Thank you.

368
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:03,297
Look, they're perfect.

369
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:06,799
Another minute,
they would have been overdone.

370
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,633
Well, I'll put this in the sink.

371
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:12,865
- Would you like some orange juice?
- Yes, kindly.

372
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,206
- I am sorry.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

373
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:22,482
- This will be taken care of.
- It's OK.

374
00:28:24,153 --> 00:28:28,715
Anyway, I'm sure
we're going to be allies, general.

375
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,724
We're both trying to seduce
the same man.

376
00:28:37,864 --> 00:28:40,300
So is there a Mrs. Groves?

377
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,431
Yes, there is.

378
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:48,866
And she has the courage
to stay in the background.

379
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:53,235
Some men are on the planet
for a purpose, Mrs. Oppenheimer.

380
00:28:53,413 --> 00:28:58,577
A good wife recognizes that
and is happy to smooth the way.

381
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:05,686
Read my theory
on degenerate matter, did you?

382
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:08,828
It didn't generate
much enthusiasm elsewhere.

383
00:29:08,995 --> 00:29:12,828
But what do you think we'll find
at the end of the tunnel, Michael?

384
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:16,400
- A martini.
- Probably.

385
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:25,132
Hey!

386
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:40,788
- Operator.
- Berkeley 5558, please.

387
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:48,056
Hello, Jean.
It's me.

388
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:52,797
- Jean, I know you're there.
- I'd given up waiting.

389
00:29:53,674 --> 00:29:56,138
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to manage...

390
00:29:56,307 --> 00:29:58,776
Oppie, I've been so frightened.

391
00:29:58,945 --> 00:30:02,038
You don't phone. You don't write.
Not even a message.

392
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:03,977
- I can't.
- You can't?

393
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:06,777
No, Jean, I can't.

394
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:08,576
- Are you coming?
- Well...

395
00:30:08,785 --> 00:30:11,583
- When are you coming?
- Jean.

396
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,260
This isn't talking.
This is just making noises.

397
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:18,622
Why don't we just grunt
at each other?

398
00:30:18,796 --> 00:30:21,560
- "I gotta run. There's a war to win."
- Jean.

399
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:25,167
I can't remember a day
I wasn't hurting, except with you.

400
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:29,169
Jean, listen to me.
You've got to understand, please.

401
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,224
Yes?

402
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:01,101
I won't keep you, general.

403
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:02,897
Well, you better had.

404
00:31:03,072 --> 00:31:06,098
Banging on my door
at 2:00 in the morning.

405
00:31:08,812 --> 00:31:11,974
I had this typed up, sir.
I thought you'd wanna see it.

406
00:31:15,718 --> 00:31:19,051
She's working him over, general.
I've seen this before.

407
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,780
That grunting at each other,
could be a code.

408
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:25,359
- The cipher clerk said it's not code.
- Who is this woman?

409
00:31:25,528 --> 00:31:28,929
Jean Tatlock, sir.
She's a known communist.

410
00:31:29,098 --> 00:31:31,396
Get me her background.

411
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,335
And maybe I am missing some stuff
on the good doctor.

412
00:31:36,505 --> 00:31:38,473
- Get it for me.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:42,598
This must throw Oppenheimer's
position on this project into doubt, sir.

414
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,075
- Dr. Oppenheimer is the project.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:31:46,747 --> 00:31:51,275
All due respect, sir, though, doesn't
this make him an unacceptable risk?

416
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:54,454
No! Failure's a risk.

417
00:31:56,091 --> 00:32:00,221
The thing that concerns me is,
if he's with her, he's not with us.

418
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:07,630
It might be a good time
to put the screws to the doctor.

419
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,963
Yes, sir. May I ask,
how do you intend to do that, sir?

420
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,573
No, colonel, you may not.

421
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:44,169
- Compression not uniform.
- Stand by!

422
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:48,069
If we had a thinner wall, we could
increase the compression, yes?

423
00:32:48,242 --> 00:32:49,935
Seth, there's an answer here.

424
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:52,599
Oppie, maybe implosion's
just a blind alley.

425
00:32:52,811 --> 00:32:54,506
- Are we going again?
- Yes!

426
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:58,148
- That's an excuse for not thinking...
- We'll get reset.

427
00:33:00,821 --> 00:33:04,448
All clear!
Reset the charges!

428
00:33:04,624 --> 00:33:07,456
Reset the charges!

429
00:33:07,627 --> 00:33:10,686
- We got all clear! Let's go!
- Let's move!

430
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:15,095
- Move it!
- On the double! On the double! Go!

431
00:33:16,267 --> 00:33:19,465
- Move it! Move it!
- Bring it in! Left side! Left side!

432
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,164
Come on!
Get the lead out!

433
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:25,068
On the double, guys!
Let's go!

434
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,778
Canyon to Los Alamos.

435
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:33,380
Come in, Los Alamos.

436
00:33:33,552 --> 00:33:35,680
Canyon to Los Alamos.

437
00:33:39,623 --> 00:33:41,887
Come in, Los Alamos. Come in.

438
00:33:43,794 --> 00:33:47,662
- Something set off the detonators.
- Stay back! They're wired in series.

439
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:49,596
Get out of there!

440
00:33:55,705 --> 00:33:57,230
- No, Oppie.
- Shit.

441
00:34:11,622 --> 00:34:13,213
It's all right.

442
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:17,654
Take it easy, brother.

443
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,587
Thanks a lot.

444
00:34:25,235 --> 00:34:27,362
Do me a favor.
Jump in the ambulance.

445
00:34:27,537 --> 00:34:29,231
Let me give you
the once-over.

446
00:34:29,404 --> 00:34:32,532
You guys are playing
with some funny stuff out here.

447
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:38,302
Let's go. Start them up.

448
00:34:51,558 --> 00:34:53,993
Did they teach you that at high school?

449
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:57,489
You took a risk.

450
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:01,635
I ran out and grabbed the guy.
I didn't even think.

451
00:35:01,803 --> 00:35:04,829
- Just instinct.
- Instinct, huh?

452
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:09,440
You know, I wonder,
with this war...

453
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:13,204
...if it's instinct to save a man,
what makes us want to kill one?

454
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:15,607
Is that instinct?

455
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:19,987
You sound like my old man.

456
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,552
Why, what's he like?

457
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:23,985
- My old man?
- Yeah.

458
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,089
He's a preacher.

459
00:35:28,164 --> 00:35:30,257
In Jackson, Illinois.

460
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:35,127
And I got an older brother,
Jimmy, and he's a soldier.

461
00:35:35,303 --> 00:35:37,362
My mom's dead.

462
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:41,337
I don't know, I guess he's kind of
hurt that I'm not at the front.

463
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,771
- Why?
- Well, Jackson is a small town.

464
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:48,344
- He said, "Where you going?"
- I said, "Santa Fe, New Mexico."

465
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:52,611
- I know.
- So that didn't quite hack it.

466
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:55,521
He said,
"If you're not gonna be a soldier,

467
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:58,181
"you better be a good scientist.
The best."

468
00:35:58,525 --> 00:36:02,257
- Are you the best?
- I was in Chicago.

469
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,160
But these guys are so bright.

470
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,798
Sometimes I feel like
I'm in over my head.

471
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:12,131
But I guess I can handle
anything they throw at me.

472
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,772
But can you dance?

473
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:17,466
Pardon me?

474
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,507
I said, can you dance?

475
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:25,678
- Yeah.
- Well, do it.

476
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:29,243
- Are you serious?
- Can't handle it?

477
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,575
Very nice.

478
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,155
- Something like that.
- Very good.

479
00:37:32,616 --> 00:37:35,676
Jean Tatlock, graduated in 1932.

480
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:39,117
They had a thing together
before Oppenheimer was married.

481
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:40,881
Seems Tatlock ran off.

482
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:44,185
Things went on the back burner
between them till 1942.

483
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:46,053
Then it all started up again.

484
00:37:46,227 --> 00:37:50,561
His associate said, "If the wife's
his ambition, Tatlock's his conscience."

485
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:54,898
She introduced him to a number of
anti-fascist groups, anti-Franco groups

486
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:56,593
and a number of communists.

487
00:37:56,805 --> 00:37:58,068
- Bronson.
- Sir.

488
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:01,970
Little less muscle on the gas here.
Colonel's starting a mission.

489
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:03,405
I'd like him alive.

490
00:38:03,745 --> 00:38:05,007
Yes, sir.

491
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,148
This makes Oppenheimer
a sitting duck for blackmail.

492
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:10,716
I'm gonna insist on his removal.

493
00:38:10,884 --> 00:38:13,283
No, you're not. Just relax.

494
00:38:13,454 --> 00:38:18,085
You know, major, if you want
to lead a man in a certain direction,

495
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:20,851
you don't drag him by the nose.

496
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:23,329
You just close off his options.

497
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:25,691
Simple as a truck.

498
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:32,538
Here we are in the top of the ninth.

499
00:38:32,705 --> 00:38:35,173
The Army down
to the Scientists by one run.

500
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:40,073
Dugan shakes it off.
Here's Merriman's pitch.

501
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:41,909
That's a hit.

502
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:44,847
Dugan digging for first base,
gonna go for two.

503
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,580
Look out. Here's the throw.
Safe at second base on a slide.

504
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:51,658
Apple scores.
That ties the game.

505
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:00,899
Yes?

506
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:04,428
Yes?!

507
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,132
Bad time?

508
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:13,939
The velocity's still presenting us
with something of a problem.

509
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,181
Who's this bimbo
you're running around with?

510
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:25,987
- What?
- Do I have to tell you?

511
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:29,323
I got it on the Q.T.
from somebody who owes me.

512
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:31,621
What if the next guy
doesn't owe me?

513
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:34,458
Takes that kind of information
to the wrong guy?

514
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:39,069
That could be the end of you.
Could be the end of this project.

515
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:41,737
I don't understand you.

516
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:46,704
You think you're some kind
of bohemian or something.

517
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:52,606
Blind-sided.

518
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,277
I never expected to get
blind-sided like this.

519
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:07,220
And there it is.
A line drive.

520
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:12,268
Doctor, might I be of assistance?

521
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:15,896
What about me in all this?
This looks bad.

522
00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:19,737
Reflects on me.
Reflects on my ability to choose men.

523
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:23,813
I was with this woman before
this project. This is not a new thing.

524
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:25,945
It's no matter.

525
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:30,748
I am not comfortable with the idea
that you could sink me.

526
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,325
This is someone that I care about.

527
00:40:37,494 --> 00:40:39,724
She's a communist.

528
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,720
A communist.

529
00:40:43,766 --> 00:40:45,199
Oh, my God.

530
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:48,030
It would be bad enough if she
were just some...

531
00:40:48,205 --> 00:40:50,035
...sweet young thing from Indiana.

532
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:52,197
She's a card-carrying communist.

533
00:40:52,975 --> 00:40:57,414
And your job, classified job. What do
I have to do, draw you a map?

534
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:00,946
Get on the phone, a secure line,
tell her... goodbye!

535
00:41:01,116 --> 00:41:02,914
The pitch. It's a line drive!

536
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:07,620
It's out of there! It's gone!
Home run for Merriman.

537
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:09,755
Home run!

538
00:41:12,229 --> 00:41:15,093
- It's all right, Bronson, we'll live.
- Yes, sir.

539
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:17,755
Well, that's it, folks,
Scientists win the game.

540
00:41:17,967 --> 00:41:19,524
It's in your court.

541
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:36,812
Bridges, next time keep your head up.

542
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:40,714
All hail the conquering hero.

543
00:41:41,856 --> 00:41:44,654
Pencil pushers defeat
the doughboys.

544
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,402
Robert!

545
00:42:39,144 --> 00:42:41,669
- Frank.
- Good to see you, bro.

546
00:42:42,716 --> 00:42:45,617
- Are we being followed or something?
- Don't joke.

547
00:42:45,784 --> 00:42:47,775
I nearly asked you for your ID.

548
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,915
- That's ridiculous.
- Let's just leave as soon as we can.

549
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,760
They've been hounding me
for names of every person I've known

550
00:43:04,937 --> 00:43:06,563
who had communist sympathies.

551
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:10,940
They monitor every move I make.
They listen to my phone conversations.

552
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:12,632
Why stay?

553
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,777
There's an order to it.

554
00:43:14,947 --> 00:43:17,936
An order in some part of my life,
at least.

555
00:43:18,114 --> 00:43:21,641
I'm sorry, I didn't get your message
till about 5.

556
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:26,847
I was still at the hospital, and I got
all whizzed up into a huge panic.

557
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:28,720
You look wonderful.

558
00:43:28,925 --> 00:43:31,587
You look so serious.
What's the matter?

559
00:43:33,264 --> 00:43:36,098
I don't have much time.
I have to go back tonight.

560
00:43:36,268 --> 00:43:37,791
Tonight?

561
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:39,937
I cooked us dinner.

562
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:49,935
This can't be about dinner, Jean.

563
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,674
I didn't want to tell you
on the telephone.

564
00:43:55,951 --> 00:43:58,182
And that's why I'm here tonight.

565
00:44:06,796 --> 00:44:09,457
Is it because of what you're doing?

566
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:20,741
Fine.

567
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:25,604
We're going to spill the blood
before we get to the cocktails.

568
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:40,521
Jean?

569
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,721
Please... stay tonight.

570
00:44:46,702 --> 00:44:48,169
Please.

571
00:44:49,337 --> 00:44:50,964
Please.

572
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:55,634
Please.

573
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:58,209
Please.

574
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,525
What you're working on,
it's something bad, isn't it?

575
00:45:26,705 --> 00:45:28,675
That's why you can't tell me.

576
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:31,539
I can't tell you
because it's a secret.

577
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:35,248
Tell me one good thing
that's a secret.

578
00:45:35,417 --> 00:45:37,317
We were a good thing.

579
00:45:38,517 --> 00:45:40,006
No, we weren't.

580
00:45:40,218 --> 00:45:42,347
Not when you got married.

581
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:46,652
Give me up for something
I can understand.

582
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,315
Your wife or your child
or your conscience,

583
00:45:49,528 --> 00:45:51,258
something alive.

584
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:54,127
Not something
that you have to hide.

585
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,458
Robert.

586
00:46:31,237 --> 00:46:34,294
Oh, Robert, I dreamt you'd gone.

587
00:46:41,645 --> 00:46:44,547
So that's what the silences were.

588
00:46:45,082 --> 00:46:47,551
No letters, no contact.

589
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:51,881
I thought it was me,
something I'd done.

590
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:56,320
- I've told you it has nothing to do...
- Yes, but you didn't tell me...

591
00:46:58,595 --> 00:47:01,759
What is it you're working on?
What is so important?

592
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:04,422
That's right. It is important.

593
00:47:04,601 --> 00:47:06,866
So don't be so goddamn arrogant.

594
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:09,698
Is it arrogant to want
to know where you are?

595
00:47:09,873 --> 00:47:13,742
What's happening to you? To want
to be close to you? To understand?

596
00:47:17,413 --> 00:47:19,403
This was the man I loved.

597
00:47:19,982 --> 00:47:23,384
I loved his dreams.
I loved what he saw but couldn't prove.

598
00:47:23,553 --> 00:47:26,316
I loved the goodness in him.

599
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:30,219
He was my proof that the world
could be made better.

600
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,584
And if he's dead, I don't want to live.

601
00:47:36,132 --> 00:47:39,897
The world is... different.

602
00:47:41,035 --> 00:47:43,368
It's just not what we
wanted it to be.

603
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:45,234
It's just not.

604
00:47:52,614 --> 00:47:55,515
You mattered to me so much.

605
00:47:56,653 --> 00:47:58,915
You really did.

606
00:48:11,766 --> 00:48:15,497
She told me that I had
a penchant for destruction.

607
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:17,903
That I'd lost faith.

608
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:20,900
Is she wrong?

609
00:48:21,175 --> 00:48:22,836
No.

610
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,442
She's not wrong.

611
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:30,906
When this war's over, I want
to ride the mesa for six months.

612
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:32,608
No deadlines.

613
00:48:33,486 --> 00:48:34,851
Nothing.

614
00:48:40,225 --> 00:48:41,853
Thanks, Frank.

615
00:48:42,027 --> 00:48:44,121
He just kissed his brother.

616
00:48:44,298 --> 00:48:46,199
Gotta be a communist.

617
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:04,643
Set that over there.

618
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:11,247
Look at it, Oppie, it's twisted.
It's got to be flat.

619
00:49:11,424 --> 00:49:15,826
I think implosion's nothing but a pipe
dream. I'm sorry I thought of it.

620
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,621
I can't do it.

621
00:49:18,295 --> 00:49:22,096
Oppie, some way I have to focus...
I have to focus the shock waves.

622
00:49:22,468 --> 00:49:24,833
Look at me!
God, I'm running out of ideas.

623
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:28,941
That's an excuse for not thinking.
If you can't, I'll find somebody else.

624
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:32,272
Oppie? Serber needs
you back at the lab right now.

625
00:49:32,445 --> 00:49:34,435
- Oppie?
- You said it yourself.

626
00:49:34,612 --> 00:49:38,515
Focus. Somebody's working on a way
to focus an explosive shock wave.

627
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,482
- I'm gonna find him. Keep working.
- Jesus!

628
00:49:47,826 --> 00:49:52,090
You know, if Oppie doesn't let up,
he's going to implode.

629
00:50:04,841 --> 00:50:07,242
Inside. Inside.

630
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:15,140
Good news is the new plutonium
makes lots of neutrons.

631
00:50:15,353 --> 00:50:19,220
But the bad news is the spontaneous
fission rate is way too high.

632
00:50:19,389 --> 00:50:23,155
The reaction will run away with itself.
There will just be a fizzle.

633
00:50:23,326 --> 00:50:26,488
- No explosion.
- You're certain of that, Edward?

634
00:50:26,662 --> 00:50:28,721
- Who did the calculations?
- Serber.

635
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,731
- Himself?
- Serber, personally.

636
00:50:32,101 --> 00:50:36,730
So now plutonium is a problem. That
shifts the emphasis back to U-235.

637
00:50:36,905 --> 00:50:41,002
Of course, Oak Ridge is not able
to produce that in sufficient quantity.

638
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:44,702
We must go with implosion, but
Neddermeyer has just announced to me

639
00:50:44,914 --> 00:50:48,371
that he and implosion
have just reached a brick wall.

640
00:50:51,754 --> 00:50:53,515
We can't fall behind.

641
00:50:55,689 --> 00:50:57,419
Are you all right, Oppie?

642
00:50:58,059 --> 00:50:59,550
You have a deadline to meet.

643
00:51:01,229 --> 00:51:05,666
Banked almost a billion dollars on you
guys. That's not working on the cheap.

644
00:51:06,202 --> 00:51:08,635
Only thing I want to hear is, "Yes, sir."

645
00:51:08,803 --> 00:51:12,932
Don't talk to me like I haven't given
eight days a week to this project.

646
00:51:13,141 --> 00:51:14,732
I've given up everything.

647
00:51:14,942 --> 00:51:16,910
Don't... Don't give me that.

648
00:51:17,178 --> 00:51:19,203
I don't want to hear
that from the...

649
00:51:19,415 --> 00:51:21,211
I've given up everything.

650
00:51:21,383 --> 00:51:23,813
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

651
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:27,484
I don't give a goddamn
that travel was restricted.

652
00:51:27,654 --> 00:51:31,317
It had to be done face to face,
and that's the way I did it.

653
00:51:37,064 --> 00:51:39,363
Latest news
from the fighting front.

654
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:45,731
American armies are pushing the
Germans back on their own territory.

655
00:51:45,905 --> 00:51:47,396
But fighting is desperate.

656
00:51:47,607 --> 00:51:50,873
The Germans are building up
for a massive counter thrust.

657
00:51:51,044 --> 00:51:54,105
Though the Allies are determined
to hold this new front...

658
00:51:54,314 --> 00:51:55,576
Who's the Lone Ranger?

659
00:51:55,748 --> 00:51:57,841
Explosives wiz.
I don't know about Tonto.

660
00:51:58,017 --> 00:52:00,578
Neddermeyer gave up
on his explosion that goes in.

661
00:52:00,754 --> 00:52:02,015
Not Oppie, though.

662
00:52:02,187 --> 00:52:05,350
He brought in two explosive
experts from the outside.

663
00:52:05,558 --> 00:52:07,821
We struggle on here
in our isolation.

664
00:52:07,995 --> 00:52:11,224
And sometimes the war
seems a long way away.

665
00:52:16,569 --> 00:52:18,231
You want a ride, doc?

666
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:21,704
Hey, Seth. When did you
get your driver's license?

667
00:52:25,344 --> 00:52:27,813
- You come to see the boys at play?
- Yes.

668
00:52:28,013 --> 00:52:30,278
- Oh, bad news, beautiful.
- Oh, no.

669
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:33,006
I'm not gonna be able to make
that movie tonight.

670
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:36,809
I can join you both for a drink.
It would make you happy.

671
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,921
- Sound good?
- Perfect.

672
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:41,856
Right, right.

673
00:52:42,027 --> 00:52:45,987
Well, I promised the monkey
we'd be cutting a rug anyway.

674
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:48,065
It's just as well.

675
00:52:48,768 --> 00:52:50,895
Michael, what's wrong with you?

676
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,031
Do you see much of him?

677
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:56,139
Yes, I like him.

678
00:53:00,212 --> 00:53:01,734
Are you jealous?

679
00:53:04,649 --> 00:53:05,911
Yeah.

680
00:53:08,252 --> 00:53:10,116
You better do something about it.

681
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,027
Tell them I ain't buying.
White House said

682
00:53:27,236 --> 00:53:30,071
there wouldn't be
any account till after the war.

683
00:53:32,077 --> 00:53:34,408
It's so damn tough
to get through to you,

684
00:53:34,577 --> 00:53:36,807
I decided to bring
you my problem.

685
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:40,346
See the tread on that tire?
Because I sure as hell don't.

686
00:53:40,516 --> 00:53:43,040
Yet that's what my men
are riding around on.

687
00:53:44,086 --> 00:53:47,681
I don't know what kind of deal
you got yourself into, Groves,

688
00:53:47,855 --> 00:53:50,553
but I do care when it cuts
in on my territory.

689
00:53:50,729 --> 00:53:54,391
If I'm gonna move supplies around
the country, I need trucks.

690
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,622
Those trucks run on tires, Dick.

691
00:53:56,797 --> 00:54:00,962
When I hear they ain't moving because
of some tire shortage, I get mad.

692
00:54:01,169 --> 00:54:04,070
When I hear you're the cause
of it, I want to kill.

693
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:08,174
- We gotta work something...
- No dice. We got a triple-A priority.

694
00:54:08,377 --> 00:54:11,502
White House authority.
We need the product.

695
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:16,041
You need to know something.

696
00:54:16,218 --> 00:54:18,584
You're getting a lot
of people's backs up.

697
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:21,783
Let me remind you of something else.
See this?

698
00:54:21,957 --> 00:54:23,321
I count two. You got one.

699
00:54:24,024 --> 00:54:26,928
When this war's over,
that will amount to something.

700
00:54:30,731 --> 00:54:33,529
And, Dick, I hope you get my meaning.

701
00:54:33,735 --> 00:54:36,328
Because, by all that's holy...

702
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:39,203
...you better have
your ass well-covered.

703
00:54:50,352 --> 00:54:52,478
- Well, Bronson.
- Sir?

704
00:54:52,851 --> 00:54:55,687
- It's all about ass, isn't it?
- Sir?

705
00:54:55,856 --> 00:54:58,380
You kick it or you lick it.

706
00:54:58,557 --> 00:55:00,789
That's what it's all about.

707
00:55:01,394 --> 00:55:03,522
I'm sorry about
my language, Bronson.

708
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:05,393
But I'm on the limb.

709
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,034
My prima donnas
better come through...

710
00:55:09,403 --> 00:55:12,393
...or you are looking
at a piece of dead meat.

711
00:55:12,939 --> 00:55:14,202
Yes, sir.

712
00:55:25,651 --> 00:55:28,119
- What's this?
- I don't know, sir.

713
00:55:28,622 --> 00:55:30,053
God, almighty.

714
00:55:30,223 --> 00:55:31,984
Is this a stop?

715
00:55:32,157 --> 00:55:34,887
What time is it?
There's no scheduled stop here.

716
00:55:44,936 --> 00:55:47,166
Message for General Groves.

717
00:55:48,439 --> 00:55:52,398
- I'll see what the problem is, sir.
- Message for General Groves.

718
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:55,808
- Message for General Groves.
- In this way.

719
00:56:01,785 --> 00:56:04,152
General Groves, sir.
This is from Germany.

720
00:56:04,322 --> 00:56:07,848
It was flown in. We wired
ahead to have the train stopped.

721
00:56:08,025 --> 00:56:09,959
Excuse me, gentlemen.

722
00:56:24,741 --> 00:56:27,473
- Colonel.
- General.

723
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,881
Put it in my safe, in the back.

724
00:56:34,552 --> 00:56:35,813
Don't bring it out.

725
00:56:38,822 --> 00:56:41,690
That means the Germans don't
have the bomb. Weren't close.

726
00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:44,984
Sir, is it wise?
I mean, suppressing this?

727
00:56:46,229 --> 00:56:48,220
Well, you tell me, colonel.

728
00:56:49,032 --> 00:56:50,795
It's delicate stuff.

729
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:55,699
I'm talking about my longhairs,
my prima donnas.

730
00:56:55,872 --> 00:56:57,499
The Jewish element.

731
00:56:58,241 --> 00:57:02,506
Take Hitler out of the equation...
they might just run out of stink.

732
00:57:02,678 --> 00:57:04,669
Why chance it?

733
00:57:05,481 --> 00:57:08,974
We can give this country
the biggest stick in the playground.

734
00:57:09,152 --> 00:57:10,949
And I intend to do that.

735
00:57:12,323 --> 00:57:15,847
And I'll tell you something
about our bunch.

736
00:57:16,026 --> 00:57:17,514
Get them close.

737
00:57:18,462 --> 00:57:20,690
Then they'll go all the way.

738
00:57:22,097 --> 00:57:23,997
They're just not close enough yet.

739
00:57:24,164 --> 00:57:25,758
Yes, sir.

740
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:37,735
Perhaps you should think of these
wedges as forming part of a shell.

741
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:43,245
They do redirect the shock waves in
the same way as a lens redirects light.

742
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:47,047
As a matter of interest, we've
already used the idea in England

743
00:57:47,222 --> 00:57:49,452
for armor-piercing shells.

744
00:57:53,228 --> 00:57:55,753
Pray it works.
We'll be back on schedule.

745
00:57:55,964 --> 00:57:57,364
Heads up.

746
00:57:58,466 --> 00:57:59,660
Watch your backs.

747
00:58:26,124 --> 00:58:29,094
No one ever used high explosives...

748
00:58:29,262 --> 00:58:32,630
...as a precision instrument before.

749
00:58:33,498 --> 00:58:34,762
It's so simple.

750
00:58:34,934 --> 00:58:38,426
It just swings the shock waves
from convex to concave.

751
00:58:38,605 --> 00:58:41,631
- Some orange, hey, Oppie?
- No, after the explosion.

752
00:58:47,413 --> 00:58:49,074
Dr. Oppenheimer.

753
00:58:49,681 --> 00:58:50,943
Dr. Oppenheimer.

754
00:58:51,116 --> 00:58:52,415
A letter for you, sir.

755
00:58:52,585 --> 00:58:55,145
- They said it was important.
- Thank you.

756
00:59:50,573 --> 00:59:52,566
Good luck.

757
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:11,255
We squeezed it!
Damn it, we got compression!

758
01:00:11,423 --> 01:00:14,291
We're on the way!
The right mix and we're home, Oppie!

759
01:00:14,461 --> 01:00:16,930
We're home free, vindicated!
We're vindicated!

760
01:00:17,097 --> 01:00:20,123
- We got a ball game here.
- Seth, come here!

761
01:00:20,801 --> 01:00:22,995
Next stop, implosion!

762
01:00:52,768 --> 01:00:55,166
Can I come in?

763
01:00:55,771 --> 01:00:57,567
Where is he?

764
01:00:57,738 --> 01:00:59,433
He's out back.

765
01:01:00,075 --> 01:01:03,100
Sitting in the sun
with a blanket on his lap.

766
01:01:03,978 --> 01:01:06,880
Nursing a guilty dick, no doubt.

767
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:11,519
It is not necessary to be vulgar.

768
01:01:12,853 --> 01:01:15,219
Nothing I say could
approach the vulgarity

769
01:01:15,424 --> 01:01:17,722
of what you're building
in your back yard.

770
01:01:20,127 --> 01:01:23,564
Well, vulgar or not...

771
01:01:24,099 --> 01:01:26,225
...I need him to come
through on this.

772
01:01:26,401 --> 01:01:30,337
He owes it to his country.
He owes it to himself.

773
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:34,835
He is the best there is. And he
should have whatever he wants.

774
01:01:35,011 --> 01:01:38,673
Don't try to recruit me, general.
You don't need my help.

775
01:01:39,048 --> 01:01:43,109
And spare me your homily on being
a good wife. I know it by heart.

776
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,845
Why did you put up with her
for so long?

777
01:01:48,057 --> 01:01:52,051
Because he's the best there is.
He should have whatever he wants.

778
01:01:57,434 --> 01:01:59,868
I don't live very well alone.

779
01:02:00,035 --> 01:02:01,401
Some people don't.

780
01:02:01,937 --> 01:02:05,203
We all have different ways
of defending our territory.

781
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:14,607
Concha, you're late.
Peter, hurry up. Didn't I say 2:00?

782
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:23,649
I'm sorry.

783
01:02:26,564 --> 01:02:31,432
And I am sorry that the news
took so long to get to you.

784
01:02:31,602 --> 01:02:33,968
It just got lost
in the system censors.

785
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,001
You know...

786
01:02:39,409 --> 01:02:43,244
...you can't be responsible
for keeping somebody else alive.

787
01:02:44,682 --> 01:02:47,343
It isn't possible.
It's not to be expected.

788
01:02:48,285 --> 01:02:50,811
I can't work on this anymore.

789
01:02:58,161 --> 01:02:59,924
I don't want to.

790
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:02,859
And I don't need to.

791
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:05,161
Germany is finished.

792
01:03:06,037 --> 01:03:09,439
It's just a matter of time.
They can't pull this together.

793
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:13,034
- You sure?
- I don't want to hear your arguments.

794
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:17,772
I already know that everything is a risk.

795
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:20,510
That the war is not over until it's over.

796
01:03:20,686 --> 01:03:23,849
That they're lobbing rockets
all over London.

797
01:03:24,023 --> 01:03:27,424
That Germany is desperate.
That she's resourceful.

798
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:30,459
If she doesn't get a device,
she could litter England

799
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:34,030
with radioactive material.
We thought of something similar.

800
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,134
The fact of the matter is...

801
01:03:36,304 --> 01:03:39,499
...they're not as good as we are.
Or are they?

802
01:03:45,879 --> 01:03:48,109
Christ, I've got rats in my skull.

803
01:03:51,684 --> 01:03:55,382
I'm being asked to throw too many
balls in the air at the same time.

804
01:03:58,492 --> 01:04:01,187
When I feel like that,
I get down on my knees...

805
01:04:02,996 --> 01:04:04,328
...and I pray.

806
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:07,792
And that's how I get conviction.

807
01:04:08,635 --> 01:04:12,299
If you let this slip through your fingers,
through our fingers,

808
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,236
and somebody else gets it...

809
01:04:15,775 --> 01:04:19,075
...you won't be counting how many
balls you throw in the air.

810
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:27,318
If you need the fire, you find it.

811
01:04:28,457 --> 01:04:30,118
Wherever.

812
01:04:38,466 --> 01:04:39,958
At last, some good news.

813
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:44,401
Apparently, sufficient uranium is
beginning to arrive from Oak Ridge.

814
01:04:44,575 --> 01:04:48,566
But, as brilliant as he is, Oppie's
beginning to show the strain.

815
01:04:49,277 --> 01:04:50,767
We all depend on Oppie.

816
01:04:50,946 --> 01:04:52,913
He's our inspiration.

817
01:04:53,081 --> 01:04:56,016
If he were to crack, we'd all fall apart.

818
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,446
Beautiful, isn't it, Michael?
Just think...

819
01:05:01,623 --> 01:05:05,061
...a few miles closer to the sun,
a few miles farther away,

820
01:05:05,228 --> 01:05:07,959
none of this would be here.
Just a cloud of gas

821
01:05:08,165 --> 01:05:10,564
or a block of ice
and nobody to enjoy it.

822
01:05:12,101 --> 01:05:14,194
"Odi et amor",
"I hate and I love."

823
01:05:14,404 --> 01:05:16,836
- Catullus. Do you know it?
- No.

824
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:23,344
I hate and I love
Why, you ask? I don't know

825
01:05:24,247 --> 01:05:28,082
I feel both
And I'm in agony

826
01:05:29,252 --> 01:05:34,053
Maybe General Groves is right. Maybe
we should just banish thinking forever.

827
01:05:37,994 --> 01:05:40,589
Michael, we have to test
the critical mass.

828
01:05:41,731 --> 01:05:45,099
- Are you going to help?
- Of course.

829
01:05:46,103 --> 01:05:48,333
I want to show you something.

830
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:09,587
Come here to see our little toy, huh?

831
01:06:11,863 --> 01:06:16,027
Michael, that's what we call
tickling the dragon's tail.

832
01:06:16,233 --> 01:06:19,829
So a slug of uranium
about two by six inches

833
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:22,598
will be pulled by this weight.

834
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:27,274
It begins here, then accelerates
at 32 feet per second per second.

835
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:31,381
It passes between uranium bricks.
We have an instant of criticality.

836
01:06:31,549 --> 01:06:34,848
For a split second,
we have a chain reaction.

837
01:06:35,019 --> 01:06:38,113
As close as we come
to an atomic explosion in the lab.

838
01:06:38,289 --> 01:06:40,521
- Without blowing up.
- Exactly.

839
01:06:40,694 --> 01:06:44,595
It's essential to determine the amount
of material the device needs.

840
01:06:44,764 --> 01:06:47,757
Ten years ago I could
hardly imagine the stuff.

841
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:49,434
Ten years.

842
01:06:49,602 --> 01:06:53,629
Each molecule collected
out of the air, one by one.

843
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:58,302
Hello?

844
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,340
What?

845
01:07:11,759 --> 01:07:15,386
I have the rare privilege
of speaking for a victorious army

846
01:07:15,561 --> 01:07:17,723
of almost five million fighting men.

847
01:07:17,899 --> 01:07:20,696
They and the women
who have so ably assisted them

848
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,392
constitute the Allied
Expeditionary Force

849
01:07:23,603 --> 01:07:26,037
that has liberated Western Europe.

850
01:07:26,205 --> 01:07:28,732
They have destroyed
or captured enemy armies

851
01:07:28,943 --> 01:07:31,104
totaling more than their own strength

852
01:07:31,278 --> 01:07:34,873
and swept triumphantly forward
over the hundreds of miles

853
01:07:35,048 --> 01:07:36,948
separating Cherbourg from Lbeck,

854
01:07:37,117 --> 01:07:38,414
Leipzig and Munich.

855
01:07:38,584 --> 01:07:41,215
These startling successes
have not been bought

856
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:43,119
without sorrow and suffering.

857
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:46,124
In this theater alone,
80,000 Americans

858
01:07:46,294 --> 01:07:48,490
and comparable numbers
among the allies

859
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:50,563
have had their lives cut short

860
01:07:50,731 --> 01:07:55,258
so that the rest of us might live
in the sunlight of freedom.

861
01:08:05,947 --> 01:08:08,109
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

862
01:08:08,283 --> 01:08:10,750
What are we gonna do
when this is over?

863
01:08:10,918 --> 01:08:13,113
I don't know.
Probably start another one.

864
01:08:13,287 --> 01:08:17,487
That's what I love about this job.
A guaranteed future. I'm not wrong.

865
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:21,322
Believe me, we're descended
from a long line of noble predators.

866
01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:23,497
You are irrepressible.

867
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:27,195
I think I'm gonna go be
irrepressible down with Fuller.

868
01:08:27,402 --> 01:08:29,164
Come on, baby face.

869
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:33,967
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm irrepressible.

870
01:08:34,408 --> 01:08:35,876
So, what are you writing?

871
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:38,375
Something Oppie said today.
I don't know.

872
01:08:38,546 --> 01:08:40,378
Well, read it. Go on.

873
01:08:43,685 --> 01:08:46,121
Makes you wonder
if there's an intelligence

874
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:49,225
that isn't descended
from a long line of predators.

875
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:53,456
I want to kiss you.

876
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:55,954
Come here.

877
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:06,440
Sir, is it true that since we KO'd
Germany, we're gonna go home?

878
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:09,807
- I'll drink to that.
- That might be true, soldier.

879
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:16,547
Can I have your attention, please?
Please.

880
01:09:16,922 --> 01:09:18,182
Excuse me.

881
01:09:18,356 --> 01:09:22,314
Seems to me that we have a shortage
of dance partners on the floor.

882
01:09:22,493 --> 01:09:24,983
So as a tribute
to our men in uniform...

883
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:28,864
...I'd like to make
available the services

884
01:09:29,034 --> 01:09:32,230
of all the longhairs at Los Alamos
on this dance floor.

885
01:09:32,403 --> 01:09:35,372
And to break
the ceremonial ice,

886
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:38,838
I will choose
the first dance partner.

887
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:48,881
General Groves...
may I have this dance?

888
01:09:51,623 --> 01:09:53,454
Why not?

889
01:10:21,988 --> 01:10:25,924
- Why do you have that with you?
- I keep it as a record for my dad.

890
01:10:26,092 --> 01:10:29,085
If I wrote him a letter,
all he'd get is black lines.

891
01:10:29,261 --> 01:10:31,524
This way I can tell him
what's going on.

892
01:10:31,697 --> 01:10:34,063
And what are you gonna
write about today?

893
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:37,535
Besides the war being over?

894
01:10:37,703 --> 01:10:38,964
Yeah.

895
01:10:40,873 --> 01:10:44,537
Well, I met this girl.

896
01:10:48,247 --> 01:10:50,375
Did I just kiss you up there?

897
01:10:57,824 --> 01:11:01,317
You gotta bring your heads in out
of the clouds. Out of the clouds.

898
01:11:03,031 --> 01:11:06,194
Keep the muttering to a minimum,
please, gentlemen.

899
01:11:07,902 --> 01:11:10,769
Some of you dancing...

900
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:13,031
...close together.

901
01:11:13,207 --> 01:11:17,200
I don't like the look of it.

902
01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:22,876
There are... bosoms in the area.

903
01:11:24,184 --> 01:11:28,019
And this could lead to pregnancy.

904
01:11:28,524 --> 01:11:32,120
Any man getting caught out of hand
or getting caught in hand

905
01:11:32,293 --> 01:11:35,319
will have to turn their peckers
over to the FBI.

906
01:11:43,703 --> 01:11:46,868
They're having fun. That's nice.
They're entitled.

907
01:11:48,243 --> 01:11:51,211
- So long as they don't think it's over.
- Isn't it?

908
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,247
I mean,
what's all the celebration for?

909
01:11:55,718 --> 01:11:59,118
Perhaps we can find
some other use for this work.

910
01:11:59,289 --> 01:12:00,517
Fascism's dead.

911
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:02,419
You mean in Europe.

912
01:12:02,592 --> 01:12:05,685
What do they think Japan
is doing, shooting squirrels?

913
01:12:05,862 --> 01:12:09,524
No, they're not shooting squirrels,
and that's not the issue.

914
01:12:10,266 --> 01:12:11,698
What is the issue?

915
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:16,298
They don't have the technology.
They're not capable of it.

916
01:12:16,473 --> 01:12:18,465
So if we don't need it...

917
01:12:18,642 --> 01:12:20,039
...why make it?

918
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:23,041
I want you to look at something.

919
01:12:23,914 --> 01:12:27,781
It's the largest collection
of nothing in the entire world.

920
01:12:29,719 --> 01:12:31,585
Make them work...

921
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:34,954
...and you've got something.

922
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,885
An irresistible something.

923
01:12:38,061 --> 01:12:39,755
Just the threat...

924
01:12:41,331 --> 01:12:43,095
...and they're ours.

925
01:12:45,068 --> 01:12:47,300
You know, sometimes,

926
01:12:47,471 --> 01:12:49,098
just standing here,

927
01:12:49,273 --> 01:12:51,208
I keep wondering.

928
01:12:51,808 --> 01:12:55,176
Are we working on them
or are they working on us?

929
01:12:56,714 --> 01:13:00,650
Give them dignity, doctor.
Then we can start talking...

930
01:13:01,721 --> 01:13:03,653
...about who can do what...

931
01:13:06,157 --> 01:13:08,421
...and what they mean.

932
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:31,049
Oh, what time is it?

933
01:13:36,322 --> 01:13:40,849
Even when I sleep, it's like dogs
tearing at a piece of meat.

934
01:13:42,328 --> 01:13:44,021
Robert?

935
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:47,790
Thinking of resigning?

936
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:49,730
No.

937
01:13:52,573 --> 01:13:54,369
I'd be written off.

938
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:58,170
They wouldn't understand.
Not in the present climate.

939
01:14:01,381 --> 01:14:05,282
I keep obsessing about the device.

940
01:14:05,984 --> 01:14:09,114
Yes, it's true, but...

941
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:13,482
...if you think beyond...

942
01:14:14,794 --> 01:14:18,457
...it's a limitless supply of energy.
Think about it, Kitty.

943
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:22,131
The power that drives the universe.

944
01:14:25,106 --> 01:14:27,335
It's beyond imagination, really.

945
01:14:27,507 --> 01:14:29,169
And we'd have tamed it.

946
01:14:31,779 --> 01:14:33,575
A new world.

947
01:14:43,091 --> 01:14:44,559
Go get them, cowboy.

948
01:14:59,807 --> 01:15:01,502
What's going on over there?

949
01:15:01,676 --> 01:15:05,544
Cattle destroyed the entire ground
cable run. Ruined two days' work.

950
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:12,382
Why didn't they herd them outside
the site? Anyone suggest that?

951
01:15:12,552 --> 01:15:17,456
The ranchers wouldn't move them.
Seems the Army stopped negotiating.

952
01:15:22,829 --> 01:15:26,027
- This is out of control.
- Edward, these estimates...

953
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:29,226
Rush, push, speed, deadlines.

954
01:15:29,406 --> 01:15:32,204
This whole project
has gotten out of control.

955
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:35,468
We haven't thought about
the consequences, Oppie.

956
01:15:35,644 --> 01:15:37,305
- Oppie?
- Wilson!

957
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:40,380
We've been waiting
for the data for two weeks.

958
01:15:40,549 --> 01:15:42,574
When are we gonna get it?

959
01:15:46,122 --> 01:15:47,884
Wilson is correct.

960
01:15:48,057 --> 01:15:51,516
We have to talk about what we're
all thinking but not saying.

961
01:15:51,727 --> 01:15:54,925
This argument is arcane, Edward.

962
01:15:55,098 --> 01:15:56,964
This thing is becoming real.

963
01:15:57,134 --> 01:16:00,694
It's going to affect lives,
thousands of lives.

964
01:16:00,871 --> 01:16:02,997
We have to start to talk.

965
01:16:03,172 --> 01:16:06,006
All right. But not here.

966
01:16:06,676 --> 01:16:09,236
At my home tonight.

967
01:16:18,622 --> 01:16:21,249
So now we tickle
the tail of the dragon.

968
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,290
All right, take her up.

969
01:16:24,529 --> 01:16:27,964
I can only hope the uranium
slug doesn't get stuck in the pile.

970
01:16:28,132 --> 01:16:31,330
If it does,
we'll probably all evaporate.

971
01:16:32,068 --> 01:16:34,504
- What's the reading?
- 1.19-K.

972
01:16:36,941 --> 01:16:39,374
- Waiting on your word.
- Meter's ready.

973
01:16:39,543 --> 01:16:40,875
Ready when you are.

974
01:16:43,383 --> 01:16:45,044
Let's go.

975
01:16:45,217 --> 01:16:46,616
OK, let's tickle it.

976
01:16:54,826 --> 01:16:56,690
It burst. It burst.

977
01:16:57,129 --> 01:16:59,096
It burst right from here.

978
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,957
All right, add it up.

979
01:17:02,134 --> 01:17:03,794
Cigarette break.

980
01:17:04,336 --> 01:17:05,929
Good job.

981
01:17:16,081 --> 01:17:18,778
Michael. Hey, Michael.
You got a moment?

982
01:17:18,951 --> 01:17:22,215
They won't let me in this place.
Still going to Chicago?

983
01:17:22,421 --> 01:17:24,480
Yeah, Frisch can't pick the slugs up.

984
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:28,558
Great. There's something we'd
like you to pick up, if you can.

985
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:31,720
You know Leo Szilard, right?
And Ralph Lapp?

986
01:17:31,898 --> 01:17:35,062
Well, about 20 of our other
colleagues from Chicago,

987
01:17:35,235 --> 01:17:39,366
they're proposing a petition stating
they're opposed to the device.

988
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,938
They're concerned about
what they think's gonna happen.

989
01:17:44,109 --> 01:17:49,308
So am I. I got a brother who's
in the Philippines right now.

990
01:17:49,482 --> 01:17:51,713
I read the papers. I'm concerned.

991
01:17:51,885 --> 01:17:55,788
I'm not asking you to endorse
anything. I haven't even read it yet.

992
01:17:56,457 --> 01:17:59,620
It should be discussed.
All I'm asking is pick it up,

993
01:17:59,793 --> 01:18:03,355
let us peruse it and make up
our own minds. How tough is that?

994
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:05,691
- Makes sense.
- It's only fair.

995
01:18:05,865 --> 01:18:07,356
I'll pick it up for you.

996
01:18:08,203 --> 01:18:10,170
- See you later.
- OK.

997
01:18:12,072 --> 01:18:14,563
How can you rationalize
premeditated murder?

998
01:18:14,741 --> 01:18:17,142
Oh, bullshit. Premeditated murder?

999
01:18:17,312 --> 01:18:20,280
- This is a war. It's about winning.
- At what cost?

1000
01:18:20,447 --> 01:18:23,008
You can't just outlaw a weapon.

1001
01:18:23,184 --> 01:18:26,154
The more effective,
the more likely it will be used.

1002
01:18:26,321 --> 01:18:28,755
We didn't use poison gas.
That was stopped.

1003
01:18:28,957 --> 01:18:31,984
You got to speak up.
The generals won't listen to us.

1004
01:18:32,193 --> 01:18:36,629
Yeah, and speak up on behalf
of all those kids hiding in foxholes.

1005
01:18:36,798 --> 01:18:40,233
I know what they'd say. The
Japanese brought this on themselves.

1006
01:18:40,401 --> 01:18:42,233
They have themselves to blame.

1007
01:18:42,404 --> 01:18:45,168
I wouldn't care if the place
went up in smoke...

1008
01:18:45,341 --> 01:18:47,707
Excuse me,
just for a minute, gentlemen.

1009
01:18:49,411 --> 01:18:51,641
And I resent your suggesting

1010
01:18:51,813 --> 01:18:53,838
I don't recognize a moral argument.

1011
01:18:54,016 --> 01:18:57,452
Why are you still awake?
Aren't you supposed to be sleeping?

1012
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:01,749
- I don't like sleeping.
- There are lots of things we don't like.

1013
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:06,019
We have to do them if we
want to do the things we do like.

1014
01:19:06,229 --> 01:19:09,256
- What's the treat tomorrow?
- Go horseback riding.

1015
01:19:09,465 --> 01:19:13,595
That's right. Now, how are you
going to ride a great big horse

1016
01:19:13,769 --> 01:19:15,760
if you don't get plenty of rest?

1017
01:19:15,938 --> 01:19:17,633
Go to sleep for Daddy?

1018
01:19:18,608 --> 01:19:20,041
That's a good boy.

1019
01:19:27,684 --> 01:19:29,654
It is hot.

1020
01:19:30,153 --> 01:19:33,487
We could go to Carlucci's,
get some ice coffee and donuts.

1021
01:19:33,658 --> 01:19:35,716
The project is beginning to unravel.

1022
01:19:35,927 --> 01:19:38,589
- What?
- There have always been questions.

1023
01:19:38,796 --> 01:19:42,731
We've always avoided the answers.
Now, everything is coming to a head.

1024
01:19:43,701 --> 01:19:45,395
- Bronson?
- Sir?

1025
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:47,834
- Stop the car.
- Yes, sir.

1026
01:19:48,005 --> 01:19:51,496
- Get out, take a leak or something.
- This is a public park.

1027
01:19:51,675 --> 01:19:55,078
Well, pick some flowers.
I want to do some shouting.

1028
01:20:04,055 --> 01:20:05,387
It's a crisis.

1029
01:20:05,557 --> 01:20:07,353
A crisis of conscience.

1030
01:20:09,327 --> 01:20:11,522
All right. I'm not shouting.

1031
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:14,298
I'm not even angry.

1032
01:20:14,932 --> 01:20:17,230
I am just stumped.

1033
01:20:19,337 --> 01:20:21,569
You want to sit on your hands,

1034
01:20:21,741 --> 01:20:23,368
polish your conscience,

1035
01:20:23,542 --> 01:20:28,070
when we might be able to end
this whole thing with one shot?

1036
01:20:29,514 --> 01:20:31,312
Crisis of conscience, huh?

1037
01:20:31,484 --> 01:20:32,973
All right.

1038
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:34,414
Have it.

1039
01:20:34,587 --> 01:20:36,247
Take a bath in it.

1040
01:20:36,422 --> 01:20:37,684
Soak in it.

1041
01:20:38,824 --> 01:20:41,693
Then tell me whether you're
going to deliver them.

1042
01:20:41,893 --> 01:20:44,384
Whether you're gonna finish this job.

1043
01:20:44,597 --> 01:20:48,967
You tell me how I'm gonna face
a senate inquiry

1044
01:20:49,135 --> 01:20:53,571
and say we spent two billion dollars
on a show that's never gonna open.

1045
01:20:54,574 --> 01:20:56,201
Crisis of conscience.

1046
01:20:56,375 --> 01:21:00,972
You got one job, doctor.
Give me the bomb. Just give it to me.

1047
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:03,872
Atrocious things have been done
in Germany

1048
01:21:04,049 --> 01:21:06,577
because people didn't speak out.

1049
01:21:06,755 --> 01:21:10,917
And we blame them for it. Right,
I think, even though it was dangerous.

1050
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:13,854
But it's not dangerous
for us to speak out.

1051
01:21:14,028 --> 01:21:16,291
That's what a lot of us in Chicago feel.

1052
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:19,933
You don't have to agree
with the contents of this petition.

1053
01:21:20,099 --> 01:21:22,466
You have to agree
it should be discussed.

1054
01:21:22,636 --> 01:21:24,830
- Yes, sir.
- Good boy, Michael.

1055
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,934
Good seeing you again.

1056
01:21:58,338 --> 01:22:00,137
- It came in on the wire.
- What?

1057
01:22:00,309 --> 01:22:04,472
Japanese are feeling out terms for
surrender. They made a proposition.

1058
01:22:04,646 --> 01:22:07,615
What kind of surrender?
Not unconditional?

1059
01:22:07,783 --> 01:22:09,716
Not according to my sources, no.

1060
01:22:09,884 --> 01:22:11,318
Good.

1061
01:22:11,487 --> 01:22:13,386
No one will buy it.

1062
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:16,652
- Sir?
- Nothing.

1063
01:22:16,826 --> 01:22:19,989
Come on. Come on. Right here.

1064
01:22:22,098 --> 01:22:25,192
Mr. Secretary, a brutal question.

1065
01:22:25,769 --> 01:22:28,031
Are you and the president

1066
01:22:28,204 --> 01:22:29,569
looking to Russia,

1067
01:22:29,739 --> 01:22:33,300
figuring they'll come into Japan,
assuming there's an invasion?

1068
01:22:33,475 --> 01:22:36,343
If you are, you're not
gonna get that for nothing.

1069
01:22:36,512 --> 01:22:39,948
Russia's gonna want
Manchuria, Sakhalin.

1070
01:22:40,449 --> 01:22:43,010
I can give the president Japan.

1071
01:22:44,254 --> 01:22:46,188
No invasion, no deals.

1072
01:22:46,556 --> 01:22:47,921
Can you guarantee that?

1073
01:22:48,091 --> 01:22:50,855
Some of your scientists
are getting out of line.

1074
01:22:51,027 --> 01:22:54,018
I hear they've been maneuvering
to see the president.

1075
01:22:54,196 --> 01:22:55,597
I didn't know that.

1076
01:22:56,166 --> 01:22:57,996
I will take care of it.

1077
01:22:58,201 --> 01:23:02,035
- Very well. Do that, general.
- Mr. Secretary.

1078
01:23:02,205 --> 01:23:03,969
Good night.

1079
01:23:07,111 --> 01:23:08,908
Panton?

1080
01:23:10,783 --> 01:23:12,248
Dr. Oppenheimer had...

1081
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:17,913
...on three separate occasions,
meetings with suspected agents,

1082
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:19,989
communists, whatever.

1083
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:22,648
- He gave us one name, correct?
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:23:22,827 --> 01:23:25,023
Press him on the others.

1085
01:23:25,996 --> 01:23:29,126
- He needs to feel the branch creak.
- Yes, sir.

1086
01:23:29,334 --> 01:23:31,302
- Ready?
- Yeah, we're ready.

1087
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:39,307
They told me you were down here.
I was having lunch.

1088
01:23:39,478 --> 01:23:42,675
I got a call from Captain Panton.
A security problem again.

1089
01:23:42,848 --> 01:23:45,714
Well, I'm being harassed,
and I'm sick of it.

1090
01:23:45,884 --> 01:23:48,853
I had a security clearance.
This was a dead issue.

1091
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,853
It's never dead with you.

1092
01:23:52,024 --> 01:23:55,858
Though I will try to put a lid on it.
This is not gonna help.

1093
01:23:56,395 --> 01:23:59,091
- What's this?
- Some kind of petition

1094
01:23:59,266 --> 01:24:04,030
from your boys in Chicago trying to go
around us to see the president.

1095
01:24:04,503 --> 01:24:07,869
That will never happen.

1096
01:24:08,608 --> 01:24:10,973
Do you know about this?

1097
01:24:12,978 --> 01:24:14,913
About the ideas, yes.

1098
01:24:15,079 --> 01:24:18,312
They want to demonstrate
the device, not use it.

1099
01:24:18,484 --> 01:24:21,282
Is it containable?

1100
01:24:21,454 --> 01:24:23,649
Can you stop it?

1101
01:24:26,459 --> 01:24:29,622
My hash is getting cold upstairs.

1102
01:24:29,795 --> 01:24:32,526
- Don't let these dodos distract you.
- How can...?

1103
01:24:32,699 --> 01:24:37,692
Robert, you are this far away
from being the man who won the war.

1104
01:24:37,904 --> 01:24:39,871
These are important people
in Chicago.

1105
01:24:40,073 --> 01:24:42,837
You can't ignore
what they have to say.

1106
01:24:43,009 --> 01:24:47,139
All they want is an opportunity
to talk about the demonstration.

1107
01:24:47,313 --> 01:24:50,875
- What's his name? Szilard.
- Szilard.

1108
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:52,814
Sitting in the bathtub.

1109
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:57,048
I should have drowned that
son of a bitch the first day I met him.

1110
01:24:58,324 --> 01:25:01,657
What's wrong with demonstrating?
What's wrong with not killing?

1111
01:25:01,829 --> 01:25:03,796
You vaporize some uninhabited atoll.

1112
01:25:03,963 --> 01:25:06,694
Set terms of surrender,
then send the Japanese home.

1113
01:25:07,134 --> 01:25:10,127
It's mush. It won't work.

1114
01:25:10,337 --> 01:25:13,433
They are kamikazes, all of them.

1115
01:25:16,076 --> 01:25:18,774
You had money in your background.
That explains it.

1116
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:21,039
- What does that mean?
- Your optimism.

1117
01:25:21,215 --> 01:25:25,379
Faith in human nature.
I never had any. Money, that is.

1118
01:25:25,552 --> 01:25:29,284
Never had a permanent house.
Made me a realist.

1119
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,591
The idea should go to the president.

1120
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:39,266
Where do you get these ideas?

1121
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:41,926
You know, those boys in security...

1122
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:45,107
...got a right to ask where
these ideas are coming from.

1123
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:51,747
Demonstrations, stopping work,
sharing with other countries.

1124
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:54,613
You're gonna have
a tough time proving

1125
01:25:54,785 --> 01:25:57,754
that those ideas
are coming out of Chicago.

1126
01:25:57,921 --> 01:26:00,412
- They are foreign, subversive.
- They're moral.

1127
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:02,921
- Moral?
- Moral.

1128
01:26:03,092 --> 01:26:05,652
Was Pearl Harbor moral?

1129
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:07,854
Poland, Munich, moral?

1130
01:26:09,165 --> 01:26:12,657
Death March of Bataan,
was that moral?

1131
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:14,096
Junk!

1132
01:26:15,137 --> 01:26:17,799
Demonstration junk.

1133
01:26:18,008 --> 01:26:21,239
I say you show the enemy
in the harshest terms

1134
01:26:21,411 --> 01:26:26,348
that you can muster, that you play
in the same league that they do.

1135
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:32,209
At that meeting tomorrow there's
gonna be a vote on this demonstration.

1136
01:26:32,389 --> 01:26:35,620
There's gonna be a recommendation
going to the president.

1137
01:26:35,792 --> 01:26:37,316
Now, listen.

1138
01:26:38,061 --> 01:26:40,996
You can help yourself here.

1139
01:26:42,066 --> 01:26:44,795
Steer it in the right direction.

1140
01:26:45,902 --> 01:26:49,498
You're either for us or against us.
Ernest, how are you?

1141
01:26:49,706 --> 01:26:53,199
I'd like to introduce
Dr. Oppenheimer here.

1142
01:26:53,411 --> 01:26:56,777
Well, rumor has it
that we might owe you

1143
01:26:56,947 --> 01:26:59,610
for shaking those yellow monkeys
out of the trees.

1144
01:26:59,783 --> 01:27:03,276
Save us a lot, not going to Japan.
My boys are gonna be grateful.

1145
01:27:03,453 --> 01:27:07,482
Yes, I'm pleased to shake
your hand. And thank you.

1146
01:27:07,658 --> 01:27:10,491
Doctor, I'd like to add my shake too.

1147
01:27:10,661 --> 01:27:12,788
Nice seeing you.

1148
01:27:16,567 --> 01:27:19,731
Did you hear what they said?

1149
01:27:19,905 --> 01:27:24,865
You keep this on the track,
and we are gonna owe you, soldier.

1150
01:28:08,822 --> 01:28:13,316
"We are in a completely new situation
that cannot be resolved by war.

1151
01:28:14,494 --> 01:28:17,430
"A petition to the president
of the United States.

1152
01:28:17,598 --> 01:28:20,032
"Discoveries of which the people
are not aware

1153
01:28:20,201 --> 01:28:23,398
"may affect the welfare
of this nation in the near future."

1154
01:28:23,871 --> 01:28:27,603
The Russians are our allies.
If we drop this without telling them,

1155
01:28:27,776 --> 01:28:30,710
we could give them a paranoia
that will make us sick.

1156
01:28:30,878 --> 01:28:35,441
The Japanese are on their knees.
All this kamikaze stuff is a load of bull.

1157
01:28:35,648 --> 01:28:40,485
They're wet-pants scared of us just
like we're wet-pants scared of them.

1158
01:28:40,654 --> 01:28:44,056
This war seems to have forced
a lot of guys on both sides

1159
01:28:44,226 --> 01:28:46,819
to resign from the human race.

1160
01:28:46,994 --> 01:28:50,431
- I hope we're not about to do that.
- I agree.

1161
01:28:50,931 --> 01:28:55,892
Our blockade will finish Japan
by autumn, maybe even sooner.

1162
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:59,666
This device is not an honorable way
to win a war.

1163
01:28:59,807 --> 01:29:02,141
And I was taught to fight with honor.

1164
01:29:02,343 --> 01:29:04,403
If Custer...

1165
01:29:04,612 --> 01:29:07,013
...had used the machine-gun...

1166
01:29:07,182 --> 01:29:10,446
...his history would have been
written differently.

1167
01:29:12,221 --> 01:29:14,520
If you go ahead,

1168
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:19,717
particularly, if you drop this thing
with no prior warning...

1169
01:29:19,895 --> 01:29:23,854
...I, for one, will have to
resign my commission.

1170
01:29:26,967 --> 01:29:29,803
Perhaps you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

1171
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:42,484
Incidentally, what is the opinion of
the committee on a demonstration?

1172
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:48,152
Well, if we should agree
to a demonstration

1173
01:29:48,324 --> 01:29:50,315
with the attendant
Japanese observers

1174
01:29:50,494 --> 01:29:54,124
and that demonstration failed,

1175
01:29:54,299 --> 01:29:57,995
not only would we be unable
to induce the Japanese to surrender,

1176
01:29:58,168 --> 01:30:01,502
we would face a critical
shortage of material.

1177
01:30:04,208 --> 01:30:07,939
The dropping of the device
has always been implicit in this project.

1178
01:30:08,947 --> 01:30:13,145
So that is the advice I shall
pass on to the president.

1179
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:15,717
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, that's right.

1180
01:30:15,887 --> 01:30:17,752
Yes.

1181
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:01,463
- Sam.
- Bob, welcome to Trinity.

1182
01:31:01,634 --> 01:31:03,466
- Here she is.
- Can I grab one?

1183
01:31:03,637 --> 01:31:05,663
- It's all right.
- Good trip?

1184
01:31:08,941 --> 01:31:11,274
- Are you the accountable officer?
- Yes.

1185
01:31:11,444 --> 01:31:13,435
- This will be for you.
- What's that?

1186
01:31:13,613 --> 01:31:16,513
It states that the University
of California hands over

1187
01:31:16,715 --> 01:31:20,117
a plutonium core of a nuclear device
to the United States Army.

1188
01:31:20,286 --> 01:31:24,724
Put more simply,
it's a bill for two billion dollars.

1189
01:31:27,027 --> 01:31:29,963
Now, let me show you
what else your money's bought.

1190
01:31:31,966 --> 01:31:34,059
The initiator.

1191
01:31:36,971 --> 01:31:39,370
And the other half.

1192
01:31:40,774 --> 01:31:44,609
Now, all we gotta do
is throw them together and...

1193
01:31:47,848 --> 01:31:50,840
Well, let's begin final assembly.

1194
01:31:55,489 --> 01:31:57,957
OK, Mr. Merriman.

1195
01:32:10,137 --> 01:32:12,435
Well, you're quiet.

1196
01:32:15,009 --> 01:32:18,343
It's coming close, what you're
working towards, isn't it?

1197
01:32:18,514 --> 01:32:20,675
Yeah.

1198
01:32:20,850 --> 01:32:24,478
I can feel it pressing down
on everybody.

1199
01:32:24,687 --> 01:32:27,520
There's something going on here.

1200
01:32:29,224 --> 01:32:32,888
It's got everybody mesmerized,
doesn't it?

1201
01:32:33,062 --> 01:32:35,087
Yeah.

1202
01:32:35,264 --> 01:32:38,960
There's a regular run
on sleeping pills and aspirin.

1203
01:32:39,134 --> 01:32:42,695
And it's not just the work,
it's something else.

1204
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:50,273
- Look, I know you can't talk about it.
- I can't.

1205
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:53,574
Well, then talk to Dr. Oppenheimer.

1206
01:32:53,751 --> 01:32:57,117
I mean, if anyone has,
he'll have thought it through, right?

1207
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:00,081
OK.

1208
01:33:06,429 --> 01:33:08,660
Touch me.

1209
01:33:24,746 --> 01:33:26,909
Naked.

1210
01:33:27,084 --> 01:33:29,609
Isn't that a beautiful word?

1211
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:34,958
Tonight.

1212
01:33:35,158 --> 01:33:37,686
I want to make love.

1213
01:33:40,664 --> 01:33:42,997
And I want a future.

1214
01:33:43,168 --> 01:33:45,794
That's what I really want...

1215
01:33:45,968 --> 01:33:48,267
...for you and me.

1216
01:33:48,439 --> 01:33:50,771
So do I.

1217
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:58,114
- Oh, for chrissake, George.
- This pitting, must be the mold.

1218
01:33:58,283 --> 01:34:00,842
I'm not an explosives expert,
but I've been called

1219
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:03,181
to look at something
that's unacceptable.

1220
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:04,753
We must use hand lathings.

1221
01:34:04,956 --> 01:34:07,287
You should have used hand
lathings before.

1222
01:34:07,459 --> 01:34:09,950
- Hand lathings, you know what it is?
- Yes.

1223
01:34:10,829 --> 01:34:14,959
- Michael, what are you doing here?
- Chicago, Leo Szilard.

1224
01:34:15,133 --> 01:34:17,796
I read it on the train.

1225
01:34:17,971 --> 01:34:21,769
- Well, what do you think about it?
- It unnerved me.

1226
01:34:23,309 --> 01:34:25,743
Are we gonna discuss this ever?

1227
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:28,072
Amongst ourselves?

1228
01:34:28,848 --> 01:34:32,908
- Are we going on?
- I don't see anyone stopping.

1229
01:34:33,085 --> 01:34:36,282
Now, look, we've been asked
to solve a technical problem,

1230
01:34:36,489 --> 01:34:40,050
to build this device.
We're not responsible for its use.

1231
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:43,593
Oppie, it's for you.

1232
01:34:43,763 --> 01:34:46,754
Peter's got revised figures.

1233
01:34:53,473 --> 01:34:57,341
Look, let me keep this paper.

1234
01:34:57,510 --> 01:35:01,469
We're expecting the initiator.
We need your lab results, all right?

1235
01:35:01,646 --> 01:35:03,308
All right?

1236
01:35:03,482 --> 01:35:05,417
All right.

1237
01:35:25,405 --> 01:35:27,168
Everybody ready?

1238
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:29,172
- Meter's ready.
- Here we go.

1239
01:35:49,331 --> 01:35:51,390
Twenty-one.

1240
01:35:58,207 --> 01:36:00,141
Twenty-nine.

1241
01:36:09,985 --> 01:36:12,180
Thirty-one.

1242
01:36:14,623 --> 01:36:16,421
Thirty-eight.

1243
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:21,657
Got it? Forty.
Everybody back, right now.

1244
01:36:27,937 --> 01:36:29,529
Behind the wall.

1245
01:36:41,184 --> 01:36:42,846
Turn it off!

1246
01:36:50,727 --> 01:36:52,662
Nobody move! Don't anybody move!

1247
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,998
Damn it!

1248
01:36:59,167 --> 01:37:01,228
Take off everything metal. Drop it.

1249
01:37:01,406 --> 01:37:04,430
Mark the positions
you're standing in and get out.

1250
01:37:08,177 --> 01:37:09,702
The incident never happened.

1251
01:37:09,881 --> 01:37:12,872
If anyone should ask,
it did not happen.

1252
01:37:34,205 --> 01:37:36,571
Everybody should make it.

1253
01:37:38,476 --> 01:37:41,070
Except me.

1254
01:37:41,246 --> 01:37:43,215
I'm dead.

1255
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:07,802
Doctor! Doctor!
I've been looking all over for you.

1256
01:38:07,973 --> 01:38:10,533
We've got a problem.

1257
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:11,972
- Bad allergy.
- When?

1258
01:38:12,144 --> 01:38:14,578
- An hour ago. They're bringing him in.
- Who?

1259
01:38:14,746 --> 01:38:16,009
Mr. Merriman.

1260
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:17,878
- Michael?
- Yes, sir.

1261
01:38:18,051 --> 01:38:20,020
Oh, shit.

1262
01:38:20,187 --> 01:38:22,383
Let's go.

1263
01:38:22,557 --> 01:38:25,456
- Come on, let's go!
- Yes, sir.

1264
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:34,230
This one won't do.

1265
01:38:37,169 --> 01:38:40,901
- In here. This one's good.
- Take it easy. All right, all right.

1266
01:38:41,073 --> 01:38:44,511
- Michael, what's the matter?
- Nothing, everything's fine.

1267
01:38:45,312 --> 01:38:48,248
- Doctor, how much did he get?
- More than 1,000 rads.

1268
01:38:48,416 --> 01:38:50,212
- Goddamn it.
- What's happening?

1269
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:53,944
Sweetheart, it's under control.
Everything's under control, OK?

1270
01:38:54,989 --> 01:38:57,786
- Steven, what's going on?
- You should not be here.

1271
01:38:57,958 --> 01:38:59,824
Excuse me, there's no patient here.

1272
01:38:59,961 --> 01:39:02,793
No one's to hear about this.
Not Oppenheimer. Nobody.

1273
01:39:02,997 --> 01:39:06,434
- OK?
- Goddamn it, what happened here?

1274
01:39:06,634 --> 01:39:08,865
I want this ward sealed off.
Come with me.

1275
01:39:09,037 --> 01:39:11,800
I want military doctors in here.

1276
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:23,809
Get the hell out of here!

1277
01:39:28,356 --> 01:39:29,916
It's the detonation circuits.

1278
01:39:32,128 --> 01:39:36,030
I don't know.
I would like another 24 hours.

1279
01:39:36,232 --> 01:39:39,200
I think so, but I can't be certain.

1280
01:39:39,402 --> 01:39:44,805
I said one more day.
I need one more day.

1281
01:39:46,009 --> 01:39:50,708
No, no, Merriman brought me
a copy from Chicago.

1282
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:53,572
Some of the physicists
have signed it.

1283
01:39:53,751 --> 01:39:57,653
Pinko fruitcakes. Get that thing
to work, I'm gonna drop it on Chicago.

1284
01:39:57,822 --> 01:40:00,345
I swear I will.

1285
01:40:00,523 --> 01:40:05,621
Yes, I hear you. You hear me?
Finish the damn thing. That's an order.

1286
01:40:07,429 --> 01:40:11,025
Well, I got other business.

1287
01:40:11,235 --> 01:40:13,794
But I got a plane. I'll be there.

1288
01:40:14,004 --> 01:40:16,597
Every time I turn around,
somebody gets to him.

1289
01:40:16,805 --> 01:40:19,776
Now they're talking about postponing.

1290
01:40:24,648 --> 01:40:28,448
- Cleared for Washington?
- Yes, sir. We are.

1291
01:40:32,856 --> 01:40:36,258
"Truman, Stimson arrive Potsdam
for conference with Stalin.

1292
01:40:36,427 --> 01:40:38,690
"Advise results of Trinity Test soonest."

1293
01:40:38,862 --> 01:40:41,422
Stalin's gonna eat Truman alive
at this meeting.

1294
01:40:41,598 --> 01:40:44,194
- Unless we...
- Yes, unless...

1295
01:40:44,401 --> 01:40:47,963
...we give the president something
lethal to stick in his back pocket.

1296
01:40:48,173 --> 01:40:52,371
I'll tell you something
it won't be... postponement.

1297
01:40:59,117 --> 01:41:03,213
Oh, Lord... so close.

1298
01:41:06,124 --> 01:41:07,751
Sir.

1299
01:41:52,471 --> 01:41:56,407
Keep going down slow.

1300
01:41:59,813 --> 01:42:03,078
His heart looks larger. Could be
fluid in the pericardial sac.

1301
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,944
- Radiation induced?
- Probably.

1302
01:42:05,117 --> 01:42:07,417
It's almost doubled in size overnight.

1303
01:42:07,588 --> 01:42:10,077
If this continues, his heart will drown.

1304
01:42:10,257 --> 01:42:12,622
- Is he lucid?
- In and out.

1305
01:42:12,792 --> 01:42:16,491
There's tremendous brain swelling
from the radiation.

1306
01:42:16,664 --> 01:42:21,226
- What happens next?
- I don't know. I mean, I have no idea.

1307
01:42:21,402 --> 01:42:24,769
No human being's ever gotten
this dose of radiation before.

1308
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:26,735
He's dying from the inside out.

1309
01:42:26,941 --> 01:42:31,468
Other problems. His gastrointestinal
tract has been destroyed by radiation.

1310
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,942
Excuse me, doctors.

1311
01:42:39,586 --> 01:42:42,680
You've got to believe
we're doing everything we know how.

1312
01:42:42,857 --> 01:42:44,290
Absolutely everything.

1313
01:42:44,459 --> 01:42:48,122
It's not gonna do any good
to have you ripping yourself apart.

1314
01:42:48,296 --> 01:42:51,958
- You've gotta go home and sleep.
- Richard, I can't.

1315
01:43:51,061 --> 01:43:52,461
- Some orange.
- Sure is.

1316
01:43:52,629 --> 01:43:54,097
Hey, Oppie?

1317
01:44:08,046 --> 01:44:09,511
Look out!

1318
01:44:11,816 --> 01:44:13,477
Hornig?

1319
01:44:13,651 --> 01:44:15,915
- Hornig?
- It's all right.

1320
01:44:16,087 --> 01:44:18,021
The other safety's holding.

1321
01:44:20,859 --> 01:44:23,726
Does anybody else need a martini?

1322
01:44:26,598 --> 01:44:29,327
- What's the word?
- Oppie, it doesn't look good.

1323
01:44:29,501 --> 01:44:34,461
We have a chance of thunderstorms
over the next five days. I'm sorry.

1324
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:38,909
I'm not telling you
what this guy's got up there.

1325
01:44:59,264 --> 01:45:01,198
- Why wasn't I told?
- Too much panic.

1326
01:45:01,366 --> 01:45:03,358
- How is he?
- Difficult to tell.

1327
01:45:03,536 --> 01:45:06,004
- I'd like to see him.
- We're not permitting visits.

1328
01:45:06,173 --> 01:45:08,801
But the men who were
with him have been spoken to.

1329
01:45:08,975 --> 01:45:11,239
Security. Delicate time.

1330
01:45:11,445 --> 01:45:14,573
He's a strong young man.
He'll pull through.

1331
01:45:15,816 --> 01:45:18,146
Schoenfield, how is he?

1332
01:45:18,317 --> 01:45:21,377
- Is he conscious?
- He's in and out.

1333
01:45:21,555 --> 01:45:23,954
He wants to know
if you read the petition.

1334
01:45:24,124 --> 01:45:28,151
- It means a lot to him.
- Yes, I have.

1335
01:45:28,327 --> 01:45:31,321
And then, that's it? That's all?

1336
01:45:31,498 --> 01:45:34,365
Yes, I have and then now
I wash my hands of it?

1337
01:45:34,536 --> 01:45:36,196
Now wait a minute, Oppenheimer.

1338
01:45:36,371 --> 01:45:39,338
I got a friend falling apart
who thinks you got the answers.

1339
01:45:39,507 --> 01:45:41,133
That's what you let him think.

1340
01:45:41,308 --> 01:45:45,473
Do you know what the Christ is going
on, or is the whole thing out of control?

1341
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:48,079
If you're trying to make a point,
what is it?

1342
01:45:48,248 --> 01:45:51,240
I have spent the last
two years of my life

1343
01:45:51,450 --> 01:45:55,945
putting up with all your security
and your secrecy and your control.

1344
01:45:56,125 --> 01:45:59,117
I don't think that bullshit
was to keep what was going on

1345
01:45:59,293 --> 01:46:02,058
from the Germans
or the Japanese or the Russians.

1346
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:04,629
It's to keep it from
American Jacks and Jills

1347
01:46:04,798 --> 01:46:07,030
because they may not
like what's going on.

1348
01:46:07,203 --> 01:46:10,103
American people don't
want to know what's going on.

1349
01:46:10,271 --> 01:46:12,671
They want to know
that their sons are alive.

1350
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:15,673
I'm doing everything in my power
to see that they do.

1351
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:18,739
Like Oak Ridge, where they're
injecting ill and old

1352
01:46:18,948 --> 01:46:21,280
people with huge doses of plutonium?

1353
01:46:21,451 --> 01:46:24,179
I don't know about Oak Ridge,
but if you want to ask

1354
01:46:24,352 --> 01:46:27,322
what's happening, ask this:
Will it be big enough?

1355
01:46:27,856 --> 01:46:31,155
Big enough to scare all of us
and make us stop and think?

1356
01:46:31,326 --> 01:46:35,353
Big enough to stop all war forever?
You want to ask a question, ask that.

1357
01:46:35,530 --> 01:46:38,829
Look, I've seen Oak Ridge, all right?

1358
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,028
That place wasn't built
to make one or two bombs.

1359
01:46:42,204 --> 01:46:45,572
It was built to make
thousands of them. Thousands.

1360
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:48,473
And soon everybody's
gonna have a bomb. They will.

1361
01:46:48,646 --> 01:46:52,410
What do they do with them?
Sit and wait till they go off, until "boom"?

1362
01:46:52,616 --> 01:46:55,209
Then we got one world
full of Michael Merrimans

1363
01:46:55,416 --> 01:46:58,784
dying from the inside out.
Is that what you're looking for?

1364
01:46:58,955 --> 01:47:02,549
Because that's the future
you've made for us.

1365
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:07,523
Hey, Oppenheimer! Oppenheimer,
you ought to stop playing God

1366
01:47:07,697 --> 01:47:12,158
because you are not good at it
and the position is taken.

1367
01:47:23,581 --> 01:47:27,845
His pressure's falling fast.
You've got to get that fluid out now.

1368
01:47:32,456 --> 01:47:34,390
Needle, Michael.

1369
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,260
OK, you're in. Start to pull it back.

1370
01:47:38,428 --> 01:47:40,396
Hang in, Michael.

1371
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:44,400
Hang in, pal.

1372
01:47:45,670 --> 01:47:47,901
Come on, doc.

1373
01:47:49,405 --> 01:47:52,843
Pressure's starting to rise.
It's coming up slowly.

1374
01:48:12,798 --> 01:48:16,826
- Robert, you have to get some sleep.
- God.

1375
01:48:17,003 --> 01:48:19,596
I'm in a dark place.

1376
01:48:20,773 --> 01:48:23,640
We've all cooked this stew.

1377
01:48:23,811 --> 01:48:30,738
The Germans and the Japanese
and the Americans and the Brits.

1378
01:48:31,584 --> 01:48:35,213
It's an ugliness that goes back.
It goes way back.

1379
01:48:35,987 --> 01:48:38,956
I'm not a scientist anymore.

1380
01:48:39,891 --> 01:48:43,955
I'm a goddamn functionary.

1381
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:48,099
I've got to stay in control.

1382
01:48:48,267 --> 01:48:51,168
I've got to control who gets this thing.

1383
01:48:52,072 --> 01:48:56,237
Power and control,
it's all I ever hear about anymore.

1384
01:48:57,276 --> 01:48:59,838
Doesn't life matter to you?

1385
01:48:59,947 --> 01:49:02,438
What about love and understanding?

1386
01:49:02,647 --> 01:49:06,141
I thought that's what science
was all about.

1387
01:49:06,354 --> 01:49:09,322
I just wanted us to work.

1388
01:49:09,524 --> 01:49:14,461
Does everything have to be
sacrificed to this... thing?

1389
01:49:16,631 --> 01:49:19,154
I put up with...

1390
01:49:22,503 --> 01:49:24,903
...Jean,

1391
01:49:25,073 --> 01:49:28,269
because I thought you needed her.

1392
01:49:30,311 --> 01:49:32,780
And I thought you'd give
her up because of me.

1393
01:49:34,516 --> 01:49:37,349
But she didn't count.

1394
01:49:37,551 --> 01:49:44,390
I don't count. Nothing counts for you
anymore except this damn bomb.

1395
01:49:45,059 --> 01:49:47,527
That's what it is.

1396
01:49:47,696 --> 01:49:50,994
But it's not your only creation.

1397
01:49:51,166 --> 01:49:53,793
There are the children.

1398
01:49:55,236 --> 01:50:00,106
And you need my love and support.
I know.

1399
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:03,104
I don't...

1400
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:06,248
I don't know where it is.

1401
01:50:06,549 --> 01:50:08,847
Why me?

1402
01:50:11,253 --> 01:50:13,744
Why did he pick me?

1403
01:50:36,846 --> 01:50:38,872
- Panton!
- Sir?

1404
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:42,748
Security's a mess. Nobody at
the checkpoint. Nobody up here.

1405
01:50:42,954 --> 01:50:45,752
- What do you think this is, a beach?
- No, sir.

1406
01:50:45,956 --> 01:50:48,892
We've got to call a halt.
The weather is unpredictable.

1407
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:51,551
We are not calling a halt
on account of weather.

1408
01:50:51,761 --> 01:50:55,459
With the wind we could send
radioactive junk all the way to Amarillo.

1409
01:50:55,633 --> 01:50:59,399
You The New York Times reporter?
I want three reports.

1410
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:02,835
One if we succeed, one if we fail
and one if we disintegrate.

1411
01:51:03,007 --> 01:51:06,807
With the wind blowing this direction,
Amarillo could get a fallout.

1412
01:51:06,978 --> 01:51:09,468
- Fermi's right.
- No, I'm saying no.

1413
01:51:09,648 --> 01:51:12,946
The decision is mine!

1414
01:51:13,118 --> 01:51:15,109
- Do you understand?
- We can't do it.

1415
01:51:15,286 --> 01:51:18,586
We go ahead with this. Sergeant,
do something about that dog.

1416
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:21,384
You sound like you're planning
a railway schedule.

1417
01:51:21,592 --> 01:51:25,220
No, you are trying to uninvent this.

1418
01:51:25,530 --> 01:51:26,963
I can do it without you.

1419
01:51:27,131 --> 01:51:32,765
Well, if you do and I've said no
and something goes wrong...

1420
01:51:34,474 --> 01:51:36,167
Get in the car.

1421
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:38,674
Hurry up.
What are you waiting on?

1422
01:52:04,103 --> 01:52:08,038
Sir, it looks like it's clearing up.

1423
01:52:28,461 --> 01:52:32,865
You know, you build to a moment,

1424
01:52:33,033 --> 01:52:36,695
and then you grab it,
or it will go right by you.

1425
01:52:38,237 --> 01:52:41,640
You always thought that
I would do this, didn't you?

1426
01:52:41,808 --> 01:52:44,404
Can you buck your own nature?

1427
01:52:46,815 --> 01:52:49,305
What will it be like?

1428
01:52:51,585 --> 01:52:54,054
Unimaginable.

1429
01:52:56,457 --> 01:52:58,755
It's your baby.

1430
01:53:09,338 --> 01:53:11,601
Do it.

1431
01:53:13,408 --> 01:53:15,035
Hallelujah.

1432
01:53:15,410 --> 01:53:18,174
He said it's a go.

1433
01:53:18,346 --> 01:53:20,337
Let's go.

1434
01:53:20,782 --> 01:53:24,344
Start the countdown.
Come on. It's a go.

1435
01:53:24,519 --> 01:53:28,010
- Let's go! Move it out!
- Wilson, wake up!

1436
01:53:28,188 --> 01:53:32,252
- Wake up the dragon.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1437
01:53:47,942 --> 01:53:49,672
Power on.

1438
01:53:50,147 --> 01:53:53,446
- Power on.
- Synchronization relays one open.

1439
01:53:53,848 --> 01:53:55,715
Synchronization relay one open.

1440
01:53:55,886 --> 01:54:01,381
- Synchronization relays two open.
- Synchronization relays two open.

1441
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:20,602
I love you, Michael.

1442
01:54:27,721 --> 01:54:29,879
Easy.

1443
01:54:31,455 --> 01:54:33,788
Breathe easy.

1444
01:54:50,742 --> 01:54:53,074
Easy.

1445
01:54:54,078 --> 01:54:56,570
Easy, come back to the ice.

1446
01:54:59,418 --> 01:55:02,477
It's OK, here's the ice.

1447
01:55:08,695 --> 01:55:12,027
Kathleen, what are you doing in here?

1448
01:55:12,231 --> 01:55:14,894
Kathleen? God!

1449
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:17,534
Come on, come on, sweetheart.

1450
01:55:19,072 --> 01:55:22,973
- You simply can't be here, sweetheart.
- I had to be with him.

1451
01:55:23,142 --> 01:55:27,511
I wanted to tell him I love him,
because he's going to die.

1452
01:55:33,286 --> 01:55:34,947
Detonation relays four open.

1453
01:55:38,459 --> 01:55:41,256
Well, it's armed.

1454
01:55:41,427 --> 01:55:45,227
- Now it's up to the bunker.
- Let's get down from here.

1455
01:55:52,572 --> 01:55:59,672
Well, I've always believed
that the Lord was on our side.

1456
01:55:59,847 --> 01:56:02,542
And I think now we're gonna prove it.

1457
01:56:42,657 --> 01:56:46,685
- Must be from the military base.
- Enrico, what do you bet on the yield?

1458
01:56:46,863 --> 01:56:49,229
I bet we set fire to the atmosphere.

1459
01:56:49,397 --> 01:56:51,763
If we're lucky,
we only wipe out New Mexico.

1460
01:56:51,967 --> 01:56:57,405
If we can ignite the air,
we finish off the planet. Any takers?

1461
01:56:57,807 --> 01:57:00,776
I kind of hope the damn thing
doesn't go off.

1462
01:57:02,044 --> 01:57:03,771
What the hell is that?

1463
01:57:04,246 --> 01:57:07,216
It's The Nutcracker Suite.

1464
01:57:08,085 --> 01:57:09,950
I can't get rid of it.

1465
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:13,020
- Go to six-five.
- Six-five.

1466
01:57:14,056 --> 01:57:16,616
- OK, try seven.
- Seven.

1467
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:19,320
Charging the device.

1468
01:57:28,204 --> 01:57:30,571
Robert, over here.

1469
01:57:36,413 --> 01:57:39,041
The device is fully charged.

1470
01:57:39,549 --> 01:57:43,484
It is now zero minus 60 seconds.
Fifty-nine, 58,

1471
01:57:43,653 --> 01:57:45,484
57, 56,

1472
01:57:45,655 --> 01:57:47,485
55, 54,

1473
01:57:47,657 --> 01:57:54,030
- 53, 52, 51, 50, 49...
- Where is that music coming from?

1474
01:57:54,197 --> 01:57:57,100
It's a ground channel.
I can't get rid of it.

1475
01:57:57,302 --> 01:58:02,296
44, 43, 42, 41, 40...

1476
01:58:02,507 --> 01:58:04,805
Goddamn music.

1477
01:58:04,976 --> 01:58:12,747
37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30,

1478
01:58:13,284 --> 01:58:15,150
29, 28,

1479
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:18,414
27, 26, 25,

1480
01:58:18,990 --> 01:58:24,191
24, 23, 22, 21, 20,

1481
01:58:24,363 --> 01:58:30,529
19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14,

1482
01:58:30,735 --> 01:58:35,173
13, 12, 11, ten,

1483
01:58:35,341 --> 01:58:40,243
nine, eight, seven, six, five,

1484
01:58:40,411 --> 01:58:45,782
four, three, two, one, zero.

1485
02:01:15,639 --> 02:01:19,540
Kathleen, my love.
You asked me a question once.

1486
02:01:19,709 --> 02:01:22,679
Was it instinct to save a life
or to take it?

1487
02:01:22,846 --> 02:01:24,813
Well, I don't know, my darling.

1488
02:01:25,048 --> 02:01:29,108
All I do know is that
if we are free to choose,

1489
02:01:29,286 --> 02:01:32,187
I hope to God
we choose life over death.

1490
02:01:32,924 --> 02:01:36,725
Not because I believe the implacable
universe cares a damn,

1491
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:40,123
but because as I look at you,
my darling,

1492
02:01:40,298 --> 02:01:42,528
I realize how glorious,

1493
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:45,464
how magical life can be.
