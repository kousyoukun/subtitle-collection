1
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,898
CHARLES EAMES: An artist is
a title that you earn.
 “艺术家”的名头是靠自己赢得的

2
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,458
And it's a little embarrassing
to hear
当人们自称“艺术家”的时候

3
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,094
people refer to themselves
听上去有点

4
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,399
as artists.
让人尴尬


5
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:42,305
It's like referring to
themselves as a genius.
就好像你自称“天才”一样

6
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:49,679
MAN: This was a man who was
a Merlin of curiosity.
这个男人对事物有着极大的好奇心

7
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,740
He was driven by his curiosity.
他亦被这种好奇心所驱使

8
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,647
MAN: We weren't sure
quite what he was.
我们尚且不知该如何定义他的身份

9
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,917
Was he an architect?
一位建筑家

10
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,083
Was he a designer?
一位设计师

11
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,319
Was he a filmmaker?
还是电影制作人

12
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,520
But what he was, obviously,
但可以肯定的是

13
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,563
was something
we all wanted to be.
他是那种我们大家都想成为的人

14
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,729
RAY EAMES: I had been trained
as a painter,
我之前是学习绘画的

15
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:12,499
but when we were working
on furniture,
但当我们制作家俱

16
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,403
and again in film,
以及拍摄电影时

17
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,910
it never seemed like leaving
painting in any way,

18
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,002
because it was
just anotherform.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,709
WOMAN: She made paintings out of
what she was surrounded by.

20
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:27,617
Everything she touched, she
turned into something magical.

21
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,656
MAN: Everything that they did
in design, she saw as

22
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,281
an extension of her painting.

23
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,588
And everything they did in
design, he saw as an extension

24
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,629
of his architecture.

25
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,460
For them, these names like
painter and architect,

26
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,193
they weren't job descriptions.

27
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,666
They were ways of looking
at the world.

28
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,932
WOMAN: They were
introducing people

29
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,099
to look at the world
differently.

30
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,372
Life was fun, was work, was fun,
was life.

31
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:56,245
WOMAN: People would say
it was childlike behavior,

32
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,045
butwhat's wrong with that?

33
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,417
The Eameses have put
all this joy back in life.

34
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,319
You know that modernism,
let's face it,

35
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,415
was getting boring.

36
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,961
MAN: Had they just designed
the furniture,

37
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,928
they'd be in the pantheon.

38
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,899
It's the multifaceted nature
of the career

39
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,369
that is extraordinary.

40
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:22,169
They give shape to America's
20th century.

41
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,700
MAN: I came from
an architectural office

42
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:57,641
where there were individual
tables with a conference room,

43
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,144
and there was carpet
on the floor.

44
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,373
There were lights.

45
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,608
We had drafting tables,
and all the equipment

46
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,776
that you needed,
et cetera, et cetera.

47
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,047
I walk into Eames Office,

48
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,055
and it was like walking
into a circus.

49
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:17,361
WOMAN: I walked in the door, and
of course I immediately thought,

50
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,126
"Got any jobs here?'

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,161
MAN: I'm just totally blown away
by the patina on every surface

52
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,231
of graphics, and there were
models everywhere,

53
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,799
and there was just stuff.

54
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,242
I was just overwhelmed.

55
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:36,476
MAN: I saw this incredible
apparition

56
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,915
of animation stands

57
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,476
and photographs
spread out on tables.

58
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,022
Models being lit
for photography,

59
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,455
a screening room,

60
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,425
and a wonderful wood shop.

61
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,290
Saltwater tanks.

62
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:53,128
WOMAN: There were Eames chairs
with Steinberg drawings on them.

63
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,794
Every kind of visual treat
you can imagine.

64
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,667
And I thought, "I've come
to work in Disneyland."

65
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,809
ASHBY: If you had taken
the roof off of it,

66
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,639
you would see that place

67
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,202
changing constantly.

68
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,714
So we'd just go around

69
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,273
and take everything
out of the middle

70
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,513
ofthe studio,
to put up a movie set

71
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,385
to take pictures tomorrow,
and then the next day,

72
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,392
you'd take out all the movie set
and put the tables all back up,

73
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,155
and everybody's
back at work again.

74
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,127
WOMAN: It was very informal.

75
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,497
I mean, there wasn't ever
any kind

76
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,762
of routine.

77
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,396
There were no
"regular meetings."

78
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,737
WOMAN: Because I did not have
a design degree,

79
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,835
many of the people
in the Office thought

80
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,903
I probably shouldn't bethere,

81
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,973
but Charles had
a different attitude.

82
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,645
And he said this to me --

83
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,656
"l can teach you
how to draw.

84
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:56,058
"lf you can think
and you can see,

85
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,223
and you can prove that to me,
you can work here."

86
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,702
[Tune chiming]

87
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,070
FRANCO: For four decades,
901 Washington Boulevard

88
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,006
in Venice Beach, California,
was one of the most

89
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,772
creative addresses on Earth.

90
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,177
Dozens of gifted young designers

91
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,046
cuttheirteeth within the walls
ofthe studio.

92
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:22,850
But the vision for the Office
came from the top.

93
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,756
CHARLES EAMES: We have to have
a place where you can recognize

94
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,487
where you're going
when you start out.

95
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,358
FRANCO:
Modern design was born

96
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,625
from the marriage
of art and industry.

97
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,100
The Eames Office was born
from the marriage

98
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,070
of Ray Kaiser --
a painter who rarely painted --

99
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,505
and Charles Eames --
an architecture school dropout

100
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,167
who never got his license.

101
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:48,703
"Eventually, everything
connects," Charles said.

102
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,477
Furniture, toys, architecture,

103
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,849
exhibitions, photography,

104
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,785
and film were all connected

105
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,222
in the wild, whimsical world
of the Eames Office.

106
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:04,161
MAN: Charles and Ray Eames
wanted to bring

107
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,528
the most magnificent experiences

108
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,261
that you could have
with your eyes

109
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,634
to the largest number of people.

110
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,969
I don'tthinkthere's anything
more important

111
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,372
for an artist to want to do.

112
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:19,309
FRANCO: It was a career
that defined

113
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,711
what it means to be a designer.

114
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,182
And it all began with a chair.

115
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:29,153
MAN: Charles, where did the
classic Eames chair come from?

116
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,122
Did it come to you
in a flash,

117
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,215
as you were shaving
one morning?

118
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,692
It sort of came to me

119
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,721
in a 30-year flash,
if you want.

120
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,097
FRANCO: TIME magazine called it

121
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,433
"the greatest design
ofthe 20th century."

122
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,803
But it didn't start out
that way.

123
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,638
It began as a failure.

124
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,905
Responding to a competition

125
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,073
at the museum of modern art
in 1940,

126
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,117
two unknown young architects --

127
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,517
Charles Eames and his friend,
Eero Saarinen,

128
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,318
set out to reinvent
the very idea of the chair.

129
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,485
MAN: The goal is to create
an inexpensive,

130
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,689
mass-produced chair
which is well designed,

131
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,291
and which is molded to the body,
because it doesn't need a lot

132
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,996
of upholstery, which is,
"a," old-fashioned,

133
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,004
and "b," expensive.

134
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,233
Upholstery is what
Louis XlV did.

135
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:27,507
FRANCO: Working at the Cranbrook
Academy of Art near Detroit,

136
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,639
Eames and Saarinen thought they
could mold

137
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,444
the new miracle material,
plywood,

138
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,779
into two directions at once

139
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,548
to make a comfortable,
form-fitting shell.

140
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,851
WOMAN: The critical point

141
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,018
is where that back
becomes the seat.

142
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,358
ALBRECHT: The glues aren't good
enough, and the chair splinters,

143
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,658
which means,
when you'd sit on it,

144
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,993
itwould be a little
uncomfortable.

145
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,057
So they have to upholster it.

146
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,864
FRANCO: Despite failing

147
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:54,373
at their goal of creating
a single-piece plywood shell,

148
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,672
Charles and Eero
won the competition.

149
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,475
WOMAN: The irony is that

150
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,346
the chairthat
Eames and Saarinen designed,

151
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,716
they couldn't really
manufacture.

152
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,848
FRANCO: Even with the upholstery
to cover the cracked surface,

153
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:15,553
no existing machine could
successfully mold the plywood

154
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,823
into the shape of the chair.

155
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,125
MAN: It couldn't be made

156
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,758
in the way that they claimed
it could be made.

157
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,529
They had designed
the look of it

158
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,537
without designing
the substance of it.

159
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,371
FRANCO: After many unsuccessful
attempts,

160
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,501
Eero Saarinen scrapped
the project.

161
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,704
But Charles wasn't ready
to give up --

162
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,475
this time, with a new partner.

163
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:36,582
At Cranbrook, he had become
friendly with Ray Kaiser,

164
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:40,575
At Cranbrook, he had become
friendly with Ray Kaiser,

165
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,783
a talented young artist who had
helped with the chair project.

166
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,518
MARlLYN NEUHART:
I said to Ray one day,

167
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,390
"How did you and Charles
get together?'

168
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,397
"Oh! I can't talk about it."

169
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,523
I said, "Well, why not?'

170
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,658
"Well, we just did."

171
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,501
DEMETRlOS: They sparked, and
the rest is literally history.

172
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,062
And I think in Ray,

173
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,937
he really found his complement.

174
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,500
FRANCO: But there was a problem.

175
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,274
Charles was already married.

176
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:11,282
He had moved up to Cranbrook
from St. Louis

177
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,013
with his wife, Catherine,
and his young daughter, Lucia.

178
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:22,994
KlRKHAM: The love letters are
Charles's letters to Ray,

179
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,623
because the letters that Ray
wrote back to Charles,

180
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,634
Charles destroyed,
because he was married.

181
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,468
They show Charles madly in love
with her.

182
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,370
There's no doubt about that.

183
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,841
He talks about walking past

184
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,571
the building
that she used to live in

185
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,839
and looking up at her window,

186
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,108
and they are very moving.

187
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:47,619
These letters are talking about

188
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:54,115
a joined future
as artists together.

189
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,458
I think
his decision feels made.

190
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:02,433
Ray certainly felt uncomfortable
enough to leave Cranbrook

191
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,799
and go away and think about

192
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,135
what she was going to do
thereafter.

193
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,537
DEMETRlOS: Catherine was
a very impressive person.

194
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,877
Knowing them both, as I did,

195
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,782
you can see why
they didn't stay together.

196
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:24,118
He really thought he had
something to offer the world,

197
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,387
and this was going to be
a journey

198
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,361
with a lot
of unexpectedness.

199
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:34,024
This was a journey that might
not lead to, uh, success.

200
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,193
And I think that maybe
at that point in her life,

201
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,633
this was not necessarily

202
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:41,969
the place that Catherine
wanted to go.

203
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,236
But I think that maybe
in Charles's mind

204
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,974
that he had wanted a life
where love and work

205
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,778
and life and work
were all blended together.

206
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,511
FRANCO: Charles quit his job
at Cranbrook,

207
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:01,583
and, in one last letterto Ray,
asked for her hand in marriage.

208
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,298
His future with his new bride

209
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:11,860
now depended
on making the chairwork.

210
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,406
Broke and short on options,

211
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,310
Charles and Ray
headed from Michigan to L.A.

212
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,315
to finish what he had started.

213
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,977
DEMETRlOS: Part of this journey
to California was

214
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,953
they were both
going to figure out

215
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,252
how to mass-produce molded
plywood and compound curves --

216
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,656
which sounds very unromantic,
but I think it probably

217
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,752
was pretty romantic,
underthe circumstances.

218
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,458
FRANCO: In their two-bedroom
apartment in Westwood Village,

219
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,991
Charles and Ray set up
a makeshift workshop.

220
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,538
RAY EAMES: The --
the first to --

221
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,197
that did the molding,

222
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,765
which was so magic,

223
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,403
we called it by a magic name.

224
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,709
So we called it "Kazam!"

225
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,979
FRANCO: The "Kazam!" machine was
a jury-rigged molding device

226
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,714
made out of heating coils
and a bicycle pump.

227
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,554
But in 1942,
with the nation atwar,

228
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:11,528
raw materials were scarce,
and the "Kazam!" lay silent.

229
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,134
Butwith the setback,
there was also opportunity.

230
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:23,369
The U.S. military
needed better splints.

231
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,639
DEMETRlOS: The standard-issue
splintwas metallic,

232
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,509
and so the vibration of
the two people carrying them

233
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,845
actually would make
the wound worse.

234
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,213
Theywould actually be
better off

235
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,252
if you grabbed a stick
off the ground and tied it to it

236
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,480
than with this
amplification.

237
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,784
So Charles and Ray said,
"Well, you know,

238
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,087
we're experimenting
with molded plywood.

239
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,423
Why don't we try
and design a new splint?'

240
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,987
They're trying to make
a three-dimensional curve,

241
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,293
kind of a bowl, you might say.

242
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,129
They can't quite do it yet.

243
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,761
So they need holes
in the plywood

244
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:52,963
in order to release the tension,

245
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,471
'cause otherwise
it's going to splinter

246
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,529
where they try to do it.

247
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,132
Butworking within
the constraints,

248
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,200
what's nice is that this is
exactly what you need

249
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,678
for a splint, 'cause you need
a place for the bandages to go.

250
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:05,615
FRANCO: In a rented warehouse
space,

251
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,551
their team of skilled designers
and craftspeople

252
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,988
made 150,000 splints.

253
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,117
With peace approaching,
Charles and Ray

254
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,492
had one thing on their minds --

255
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,327
applying the lessons
of the splints

256
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,867
to the failed
plywood chairs.

257
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:26,962
Thistime, they wouldn't design
the look of the chairfirst.

258
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,837
DEMETRlOS: They would never make
that mistake again.

259
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,810
They would let the design flow
from the learning.

260
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,041
FRANCO: That meant
knowing who they were serving.

261
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,275
In Charles's words,

262
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,146
it was always about being

263
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,209
a good host to their guests.

264
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:45,280
CHARLES EAMES: The people we
wanted to serve were varied,

265
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,849
and to begin with we studied
the shape and postures

266
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,125
of many types --
averages and extremes.

267
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,758
FRANCO: But it was more
than just a search

268
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,304
for the best chair design.

269
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,499
Itwas the beginning
of the Eames design process,

270
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,272
a process of learning by doing.

271
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,007
CHARLES EAMES: In the design
of any structure,

272
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,946
it is often the connection

273
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,452
that provides the key
to the solution.

274
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,081
FRANCO: "Never delegate
understanding," Charles said.

275
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,649
It would become a hallmark
of Eames design,

276
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,558
their secret ingredient.

277
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,995
MAN: Charles said,
yeah, there's a secret.

278
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,057
First you have an idea,
then you discard the idea,

279
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,900
then you have 50 other ideas
and you discard them,

280
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:36,430
and then you do several models,
and they don'twork,

281
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,066
and you throwthem out.

282
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,579
And the secret is work and work
and work and work and work.

283
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:47,085
FRANCO: The plywood furniture
was good to go in 1946.

284
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,279
Charles said of the furniture,

285
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:54,520
"We wanted to make the best
for the most for the least."

286
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,288
That sentiment struck a chord

287
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,922
with the Herman Miller
furniture company.

288
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:02,195
Honest and simple
in its use of materials,

289
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:06,204
the plywood furniture was also
affordable for the common man.

290
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,901
Together, they would become one
of the great success stories

291
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,840
of the postwar era.

292
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,785
ALBRECHT: Charles and Ray Eames
provide much of the furniture

293
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,688
for a kind of
Upper-middle-class,

294
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,191
educated audience

295
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,124
moving to suburbia.

296
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,594
When the Second World War ended,

297
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,656
itwasn't just five years
of pent-up demand.

298
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,633
Itwas actually almost 15 years,

299
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,000
because you also have 10 years
of the Depression.

300
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,063
And people have much more money,

301
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,972
so if you wanted to sort of
do something

302
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,706
differentthan your parents,
you boughtthat Eamesfurniture.

303
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:53,142
And itwas promoted that way.

304
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,209
Everything around the marketing
suggested,

305
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,552
"Here is something new
for a new society."

306
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,616
And America was a new society
in '45.

307
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,058
FRANCO: In the decades
to follow,

308
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,293
Charles and Ray scored success

309
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,462
with line after line
of Eames furniture.

310
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,971
And their unmistakable designs

311
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,906
became a ubiquitous part
of American culture,

312
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,969
right up to today.

313
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,537
Sold for $900, 232.

314
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:28,177
I think the work retains
a real freshness.

315
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,984
Elements of it still inform
contemporary design today.

316
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,082
AUCTlONEER: $700.

317
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,285
AUCTlONEER: $2,000.

318
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,350
$2, 100.

319
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,861
AUCTlONEER: $2, 100.

320
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,522
AUCTlONEER: $7,000.

321
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,998
AUCTlONEER: Fair warning,
selling...$13,000.

322
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,398
Are we done?

323
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,800
Sold for $13,000.

324
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,132
WRlGHT: The rightness
of thefurniture

325
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,299
will continue to appeal

326
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,276
to new generations.

327
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,780
MAN: The word "Eames" has now
become a generic word.

328
00:16:55,848 --> 00:17:00,182
I mean, if you go on eBay,
it always says, "Eames era"

329
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,345
blah, blah, blah.

330
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,184
So it's become
a word like "Victorian."

331
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,417
Maybe it's, in a way, accurate,

332
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,756
because just like Queen Victoria

333
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,352
represents an attitude,

334
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,059
Eames also embodies
a certain approach

335
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,830
to life and to thinking.

336
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,531
FRANCO: By the early '50s,
Charles had grown

337
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:24,235
an outsized reputation
as an icon of modernism,

338
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,005
fighting to inject
an ethical dimension

339
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,740
into American capitalism.

340
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,475
At that price,
the customer knows

341
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,948
exactly what
he's going to get.

342
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,006
This!

343
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:37,146
FRANCO: In MGM's
"Executive Suite,"

344
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,348
William Holden stars

345
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,018
as a curiously
Charles Eames-like

346
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,720
furniture designer.

347
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,262
We'll have a line
of low-priced furniture,

348
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,388
a new and different line,

349
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,933
as differentfrom anything
we're making today

350
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,561
as a modern automobile is
different from a covered wagon.

351
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,902
FRANCO: In the outside world,
Charles's reputation

352
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,964
may have grown larger than life,

353
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,907
butwithin the Eames Office,

354
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,413
there was always the lingering
question of credit.

355
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,575
SUSSMAN: There are still
some sore issues

356
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:09,678
among certain people who feel
they never were recognized

357
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,848
as much as they should,

358
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,654
but it's a very delicate issue.

359
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:19,959
FRANCO: The issue came to a head
back in 1946

360
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,899
atthe unveiling
of the original Eames chair

361
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:27,667
when the museum of modern art
gave Charles a one-man show.

362
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:32,802
ALBRECHT: MOMA gives the name
Charles Eames,

363
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,712
and this causes a certain
tension in the Office,

364
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,478
because it was thought to be
a collaborative effort.

365
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:44,011
MAN: It's not that he's swooping
in or is doing nothing

366
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,580
and scarfing up all the credit,

367
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,456
but he is not the only designer
that was involved.

368
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,554
SUSSMAN: This happens
all the time.

369
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,122
Agroup of young people
co-creating

370
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,727
and influencing each other
and inspiring each other,

371
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,795
and then the question is,
"Who did what?'

372
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,603
One of the last projects

373
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,906
I worked on was
"Day of the Dead," the film.

374
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,948
I was down in Mexico
helping with thatfilm,

375
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,006
shooting, gathering objects,

376
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,279
and setting the type.

377
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,548
And I wrote,
"Assistance in Mexico,"

378
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,352
and I wrote the names
ofthe people.

379
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:24,987
So Charles came by my desk
and said, "What is that?!"

380
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:29,090
And I said, "But we worked
on it, didn't we?'

381
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,233
ASHBY: I went to New York
many, many times,

382
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,673
putting the time life
lobbies together,

383
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,643
and Charles never went
and saw them

384
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,804
while the things
were being constructed,

385
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,781
but I could never say

386
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,114
that I designed anything
at the Eames Office.

387
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,917
I never saw anything
come out of there that was not

388
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,584
signatured, you know,
by him and Ray.

389
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,097
OPPEWALL: When a product
comes out,

390
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,256
it's a river.

391
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,390
It starts at one point,

392
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,058
and it ends at another point.

393
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:07,401
Many people jump into it
along the way.

394
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:12,102
BEEBE: And everybody contributes
a small piece,

395
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,769
but only if they go on
after that

396
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,972
to produce
a stunning amount ofwork,

397
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,016
I think, are they
capable of saying,

398
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,573
"l did this, this, and this

399
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,812
in the Eames Office
with no credit."

400
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:27,553
WOMAN: I think he ran the Office
a bit like a Renaissance studio.

401
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,059
You know, there's
a master painter,

402
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,322
butthen there are
all the other people

403
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,761
who help realize the work.

404
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,666
OPPEWALL: He may have been
exploiting us,

405
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,332
but if you were not stupid,

406
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:46,343
you were also exploiting
that relationship.

407
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,174
I was happy,

408
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,307
being exploited

409
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,511
by a proper master.

410
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,725
MAN: The most
wonderful work is --

411
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,955
is the conscience
and the talents of a person

412
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,190
who have every right
to have their name on it,

413
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,563
even though it's done
by minions of other people.

414
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,603
Things good and bad,

415
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,265
he rightfully has his name
on them, and they rightfully

416
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,208
are Charles Eames or
Charles and Ray Eames products.

417
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:19,578
ARLENE FRANClS: Almost always,
when there's a successful man,

418
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:24,538
ARLENE FRANClS: Almost always,
when there's a successful man,

419
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,676
there is a very interesting
and able woman behind him.

420
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,221
And a better case
could seldom befound

421
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,086
than in Ray and Charles Eames.

422
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,681
Come on in, Ray.

423
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,693
Hello,
I'm so happy to see you.

424
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,127
This is Mrs. Eames,
and she's going to tell us

425
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,061
how she helps Charles
design these chairs.

426
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,394
How do you manage that?

427
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,060
Well, uh, aside from serving

428
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,832
as an extreme in the testing,

429
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,874
there are a million things,

430
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:53,934
but, uh, I think
the most difficult thing

431
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,310
is to keep the big idea,

432
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,646
to be able to look
critically at the work.

433
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:04,451
ALBRECHT: Arlene Francis is
clearly having a hard time

434
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:08,357
with this husband and wife
working together.

435
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,157
You know, this is the era
of "Mad Men,"

436
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,787
as we're watching now.

437
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,525
This is not fitting.

438
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,536
And Charles Eames is trying
to promote Ray Eames,

439
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:22,129
as saying that,
"We collaborated on this."

440
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,835
CHARLES EAMES: Well, uh, Ray --
Ray was a painter.

441
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,107
Ray worked here in New York with
Hans Hofmann for a long time,

442
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,670
which is a pretty good start.

443
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,978
KlRKHAM: I actually thought
Charles was more embarrassed

444
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,074
than Ray.

445
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,982
Ray is hidden away.

446
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:39,490
Charles is being highlighted,
the great male designer.

447
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,753
It's a very interesting moment

448
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:45,024
of American sexual politics
in the 1950s.

449
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,588
Uh, I wonder if you're going
to maybe take us through

450
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,032
and show how -- how the Eames
chair has developed.

451
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,865
And, Ray, shall we
let Charles do it,

452
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,029
or do you want
to help with it?

453
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,367
Please, please.

454
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,805
No, you see, as I told you,
she is behind the man,

455
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,933
but terribly important.

456
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,670
Thank you, Ray.
All right, Charles --

457
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,976
SUSSMAN: The feminist conscience
had not been yet raised.

458
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:08,111
Ray would always stand
behind Charles.

459
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:12,714
And on camera or in interviews,
she said hardly anything.

460
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,624
EDWARD P. MORGAN: Her warm
but quiet conversation

461
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,162
shrank to total silence
before the camera,

462
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,063
but her impact on Eames' work
spoke for her.

463
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,261
She sat like a delicious
dumpling in a doll's dress,

464
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,566
concentrating
on a sweep of subjects

465
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:30,005
which would seemingly
choke a computer.

466
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,906
ASHBY: People always made
the mistake

467
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:35,435
that Charles and Ray,
it was two brothers.

468
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,573
They were a married couple,

469
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,447
while at the same time,
they were partners

470
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,919
in whatever
their design effort was.

471
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:47,254
OPPEWALL: Ray felt, I think,

472
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,692
deeply enraged
and hurt, on occasion,

473
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,721
when it was assumed that it was

474
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,566
actually just Charles's business

475
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,696
and it was the office
of Charles Eames,

476
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,570
not the office
of Charles and Ray Eames.

477
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,442
It was Charles
who was in charge,

478
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,878
but the body of work
would not have been the same

479
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,916
without Ray's contributions,

480
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:16,215
and how you separate that out,
I don't know.

481
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,451
FRANCO: If the public saw Ray
as little more

482
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,084
than the devoted wife
supporting her husband,

483
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,652
Charles saw a talented artist
who had participated

484
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,790
in the birth of abstract art
in America.

485
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,995
Her mentor was the German
abstract expressionist

486
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,799
Hans Hofmann.

487
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:37,000
PERL: Hofmann is one
of the great catalytic figures

488
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,702
in American art.

489
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:43,214
He starts a school
in New York City in '33

490
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:46,444
with at times no more than
a dozen or two students.

491
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:50,477
They, together, are the seed
out of which

492
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,115
the new American art
really grows.

493
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,695
He was getting ideas from people

494
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,859
Iike Mondrian, Paul Klee,
Kandinsky,

495
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,631
but he was communicating them

496
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:12,007
not as textbook learning, but as
this incredibly visceral

497
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,806
sensation.

498
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:18,339
And I have talked to people
who remember him

499
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,579
walking into the studio and
looking at a drawing of theirs

500
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,883
and tearing it down the middle

501
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:27,686
and then taking the two parts
and moving them.

502
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,626
And then suddenly something
that had been very static

503
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,992
was dynamic.

504
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,699
KlRKHAM: So I think it's there
that Ray learned

505
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,101
some, at least, of this
wonderful capacity that she had

506
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,334
for collaging,
for juxtaposition.

507
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,275
She could move things around
very, very easily

508
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:49,802
and beautifully and find form,

509
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:54,045
and find form
in relation to other form.

510
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:02,023
SUSSMAN: Ray knew what was art

511
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,720
and what was not.

512
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:09,290
And Charles depended
on her aesthetic genius.

513
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:14,395
OPPEWALL: And she would put
objects on shoots

514
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:18,101
that would just bring
the whole thing to life.

515
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:24,644
By putting the stack
of black wire chairs

516
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,844
naked with the wooden bird

517
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,784
with the little wire legs,

518
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:34,188
gave you a very different
feeling about those chairs.

519
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,956
ASHBY: Charles could not deal
with the idea

520
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,692
that any of the furniture
would have color on it.

521
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,791
If you put a palette of colors
in front of him,

522
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,859
they just-- like he couldn't
handle it.

523
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,371
It just went
over his head.

524
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,965
He deferred to her completely
on color sense.

525
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:54,034
BEEBE: She saw everything
as a painting.

526
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,637
She had these enormous eyes
that were --

527
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,081
they were open like this
all the time.

528
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,347
And I think Charles
was very dependent on that.

529
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,820
SUSSMAN: You could just
hear him say,

530
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,789
"Ra-ay!"

531
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,723
Which meant, "Come and help!"

532
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,023
FRANCO: At the Library
of Congress,

533
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,588
Ray's letters
to a traveling Charles

534
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,691
show herfastidious attention
to every detail

535
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,395
of their life and work.

536
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,234
MAN: When she writes to Charles
in Paris

537
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,673
and she's talking about
the slides that he's just taken,

538
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,234
and she has this sketch
showing how she

539
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,907
and Sandro and Don Albinson
have changed the chair.

540
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,473
And then she's going on
about thefilms,

541
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,485
and she's going on
about Elmer Bernstein.

542
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,147
Then she tells him all
the places to shop in Paris

543
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,656
and where to get his shoes

544
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,952
and where to get her gloves

545
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,085
and whatthe stitching
should be like on the gloves

546
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:47,120
and howthis perfume
by Balmain is $55 an ounce here,

547
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,463
but it's cheaper in Paris,
"and please get it for me."

548
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,669
SELlGSOHN: It's as if
they were one individual

549
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,572
with two different
special areas,

550
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,473
and a lot of it was unspoken,

551
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,774
just eye -- eye contact.

552
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,473
A nodding of something --
an idea

553
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,516
thatthey both would agree on.

554
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:09,246
PEATROSS: So that's how
you begin to separate

555
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,084
their artistic personalities
and their contributions.

556
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,751
Butthe separating them
isn't the important part.

557
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,886
It's what they created together.

558
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:20,658
That's why it's so good.

559
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,271
FRANCO: Perhaps the greatest
Eames design of all

560
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,536
was the image
of Charles and Ray.

561
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,372
Their playful self-portraits,
eccentric dress,

562
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,213
and quotable quotes
all contributed

563
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,118
to the endearing picture
of a happy, modern couple

564
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,622
absorbed in the challenges
of their work.

565
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,683
Charles and Ray
were cultural icons,

566
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:55,597
buttheir public face masked
a deep desire for privacy.

567
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:59,364
After long hours at 901,

568
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,769
they would retreat
to the home they built

569
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,308
in Pacific Palisades.

570
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:08,072
SUSSMAN: Charles and Ray were
their own community,

571
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:12,105
and we were
in the satellite group.

572
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,810
And so was everybody else.

573
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:21,849
ASHBY: I had no sense that they
were trying to keep out

574
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,895
the outside world
or anything else.

575
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,057
They had created a world
and a lifestyle

576
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:31,000
thatjust required them to go

577
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:34,095
in this tunnel from their house

578
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,073
to the work, you know,
back home again,

579
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,373
sowhat you surround yourself
with and the choices you make

580
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,606
about where you live
and how you live

581
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,240
and the artifacts you have,

582
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,409
they're all based upon
trying to create

583
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:52,047
a seamless environment
and a seamless life.

584
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:57,584
FRANCO: Originally, the house
was designed by Charles

585
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,562
with Eero Saarinen as part of

586
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,328
the influential case study
housing program in 1945.

587
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:08,202
But Charles and Ray were not
ones to let a good design rest.

588
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,936
DEMETRlOS: Charles Eames and
Eero Saarinen designed a house

589
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,308
that we now call
the Bridge House,

590
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,869
and it was forthis site.

591
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,414
It would have cantilevered
from the hillside

592
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,315
out into the middle
of the meadow.

593
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,683
One of the ideas of the house
was to use technologies

594
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,381
that had come
out of the war effort.

595
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,582
So all the parts of this house

596
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,626
were off the shelf.

597
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:32,356
FRANCO: But the Bridge House
was never built.

598
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,522
DEMETRlOS: After World War ll,

599
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,065
there were major
material shortages,

600
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,566
and it took about
two or three years

601
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,363
to even get the parts
thatthey had ordered.

602
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,563
And in that time,
Charles and Ray

603
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,798
fell in love with this meadow.

604
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:50,371
RAY EAMES: We spent all --
all our spare time here.

605
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:54,009
Began to think itwould be
criminal to put that house

606
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,076
in the middle
ofthe field.

607
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,652
WOMAN: Charles realized,

608
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:04,388
"Oh, we're making the classic
architect's mistake."

609
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,327
You find
a beautiful site,

610
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,889
and you plunk a house
in the middle of it.

611
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,163
FRANCO:
With the meadow in mind,

612
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:15,035
Charles and Ray redesigned
the Bridge House

613
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,768
and began construction.

614
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,106
MAN: It was relatively quick,

615
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:25,377
because they were relying on
some form of prefabrication,

616
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,886
of bringing materials
to the site

617
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,945
and assembling them.

618
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:36,460
FRANCO: On Christmas Eve, 1949,

619
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,927
Charles and Ray moved in.

620
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:46,168
Hines: The Eames house
in Los Angeles

621
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,035
on that bluff
overlooking the Pacific Ocean

622
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:54,044
is surely one of the great
buildings ofthe 20th century.

623
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,979
FRANCO: Known to architectural
historians

624
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,209

ASHBY: Charles had a terrible
time interacting with people.

782
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,447
Several times, I hired people,

783
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,073
and they would be there
like three days,

784
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,311
and he'd come to me and say,
"l just can't stand that guy.

785
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:22,545
Get him out of here."

786
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,145
And I never did know what it was

787
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,349
that he saw in that person

788
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,188
that he could just not
work with them.

789
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,788
ROCHE: I happen to have
a sort of interest in language

790
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:38,028
as a means of communication,
which I like to believe

791
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,229
can be simple and direct.

792
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:44,673
Charles, I would say,
didn't subscribetothat.

793
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:50,339
Uh, no, we have to -- you know,
the only thing is, uh, Perry,

794
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:54,783
we have to have some sort of
a background before we do this,

795
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,184
because one sort of begins to --

796
00:40:57,254 --> 00:41:01,122
SUSSMAN: His speech wasn't
yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda.

797
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,956
It was stop and go,
and stop and go.

798
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,623
No, you -- you let me -- cut
this, let me re-- let me --

799
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:11,794
ROCHE: He had
this incredible ability

800
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,167
to surround every subject

801
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,605
with a little cloud ofwords.

802
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,540
We -- we were hoping to --

803
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,545
there were two --
there were several things.

804
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,739
There was, uh...

805
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,042
ROCHE: You finally
got the message

806
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:29,017
at the end of about
15 or 20 minutes of wondering,

807
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,951
"Whatthe hell is he
talking about?'

808
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:34,752
It finally dawned on you
that he was telling you

809
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,156
you were an absolute clown

810
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,024
becausethere's something wrong.

811
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:41,622
CHARLES EAMES: This one is
going to have something to do

812
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,497
with what I think of
as the new covetables.

813
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:49,505
JOHN NEUHART: He appeared
one day at a conference at UCLA,

814
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:55,011
and he started to speak, and it
just ran right off the track.

815
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,775
Looked up, and he said,
"I'm sorry.

816
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,646
I just --
isn't going to work today."

817
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,016
And somebody said, "No, no!"

818
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,952
So he said,
"Well, give me a minute."

819
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,990
He put his head down.

820
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:10,083
And everybody waited.

821
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,957
And it took about two minutes.

822
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,826
And he raised up.

823
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,059
And he just took off.
Boom.

824
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,601
CHARLES EAMES: Reams of paper.

825
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,899
What you do with a ream of paper

826
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:25,931
can never quite come up
to what the paper offers.

827
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,341
[Cheers and applause]

828
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:30,107
JOHN NEUHART: He knew
where his center was.

829
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,081
And there are not a lot of
people that can do that.

830
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,345
I -- I have buttons
that get pushed,

831
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:38,217
but I don't know
where my center is.

832
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,918
FRANCO: For Charles,
knowing where his center was

833
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,586
meant working
for powerful clients

834
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:47,096
without compromising his ideals.

835
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:50,565
And making a film to represent
the United States

836
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,535
in communist Russia in 1959

837
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,539
would put that philosophy
to the test.

838
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,974
ALBRECHT: At the height
of the Cold War,

839
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,105
the American government

840
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,546
and the government
of the Soviet Union

841
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,712
decided to hold
joint expositions.

842
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:13,780
The United States would show
what America was about

843
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,449
to the Soviet public,

844
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:19,963
and the Soviet Union would show
what they were about to America.

845
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,521
And one of the centerpieces
were a series

846
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,591
of American kitchens,

847
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,295
and it was there
that Khrushchev and Nixon

848
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,066
had their so-called
Kitchen Debate.

849
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:32,939
There are some instances
where you may be ahead of us.

850
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,978
There may be some instances --
for example,

851
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,104
color television --
where we're ahead of you.

852
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:39,206
But in order
for both of us --

853
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,341
[Speaking Russian]

854
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:41,714
For both of us
to benefit --

855
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,082
for both of us to benefit --

856
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:46,179
FRANCO: But the U.S.
Information Agency

857
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:49,623
decided that they had to show
Russians more about America

858
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:52,389
than just cars
and household appliances.

859
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:58,026
KlRKHAM: The idea is that
Charles and Ray will make a film

860
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:02,038
about life in the USA:
"Glimpses of the USA."

861
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,437
How could you make the world

862
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,338
as we see it
in the United States --

863
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,274
how could you make it
really credible

864
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,141
to an audience like that?

865
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:13,013
We could've shown the greatest
freeway in the United States.

866
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,711
If we'd shown one picture
and they'd gone,

867
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,117
they'd say, you know,

868
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,587
"They've got the great
freeway interchange,

869
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,919
but we've got one at Minsk,

870
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,016
and we're going to build one
at Smolensk,

871
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,061
and we'll have two,
and they have one."

872
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:28,565
But in the redundancy
of the multi-imagetechnique,

873
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,691
in something like 12 seconds,

874
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:34,761
I think we showed
120 freeway interchanges.

875
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,972
ALBRECHT: People were sent
all overthe country.

876
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,808
Friends were called
to take images

877
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,940
so that it looked
nationalistic.

878
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,950
It couldn't look specific
and regional.

879
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:51,112
It had to be
national and egalitarian.

880
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,122
LUClA EAMES: Charles said --
wanted pictures

881
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,523
of people setting off for work,

882
00:44:56,593 --> 00:45:00,120
children coming from school,
coming up from the subway.

883
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,062
And freeways.

884
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,997
So I did my first,

885
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,366
you know, helicopterflights,

886
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,405
sort of strapped in,
leaning way out.

887
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:17,614
I think the State Department
had sort of envisioned

888
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:20,172
having lots of troop marches.

889
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,740
And Charles said
he'd do the film,

890
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:27,155
but he didn'twant to have it
reviewed before it was shown.

891
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,715
JOHN NEUHART: The government
really didn't have any idea

892
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,260
whatwas happening.

893
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,125
We would have these showings

894
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:36,598
for the guy who would represent
the government, coming out.

895
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,601
It seemed like each time,

896
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:42,264
itwould just get going,
and then it'd go blank.

897
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:46,435
And we'd say, "That's as far
as we are right now."

898
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,843
And he'd say, "Well...

899
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,404
Yeah, I guess it looks okay.

900
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,882
I don't know."

901
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,612
So he'd go away.

902
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,322
DEMETRlOS: Well, as Charles
said, sometimes

903
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,484
if you don't ask
for people's opinions,

904
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,857
then they don't
give them to you.

905
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,122
They just got there
the day before,

906
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:07,288
and I think by that time,

907
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:08,558
the USlAwas just relieved

908
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:12,193
that there'd be anything
to show.

909
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,898
ASHBY: You know, and here you
have this giant effort

910
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,133
that'd gone into
building the building

911
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,834
and putting the screens up,

912
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,470
and tickets being --
all of that happening.

913
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,741
And he's waiting
till the very last minute.

914
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,510
It's just kind of his nature.

915
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,346
JOHN NEUHART:
Right at the end,

916
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:29,942
he would suddenly appear,

917
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,580
and itwould look
like itwas effortless.

918
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:33,918
He'd say, you know,

919
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:37,290
"This is just a little something
we've been doing."

920
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,522
You know, and there'd be
blood all over the floor

921
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,791
from the thing, you know?

922
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,828
CHARLES EAMES: When we look
atthe night sky,

923
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:49,668
these are the stars we see --

924
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,733
the same stars that shine down
upon Russia each night.

925
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,907
We see the same clusters,
the same nebulae.

926
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,541
And from the sky, it would be
difficult to distinguish

927
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:02,915
the Russian city
from the American city.

928
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:06,046
DEMETRlOS: If you're
going to communicate

929
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:08,785
with 3 million Soviet citizens,
you need to say something true.

930
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:10,952
You can't just show off
you've got

931
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,996
better weapons
or this or that.

932
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,896
You've got to try to speak
from the heart, and they did.

933
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,470
Was it propaganda?

934
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:29,671
Goodness, yes, have you seen it?

935
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:32,374
Yes, it's, it's selling
the U.S.,

936
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:36,613
and it's selling, I think,
a very sanitized USA.

937
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,182
ALBRECHT: Of course
it was propaganda.

938
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:48,027
They were Cold Warriors.

939
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:49,429
The difference is they --

940
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:51,558
I believe they genuinely
believed it.

941
00:47:57,107 --> 00:48:01,373
KlRKHAM: One of the interesting
things was how to end this.

942
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:04,608
Charles had this idea
of a jet plane.

943
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:08,845
Ray still felt this might be
a bit hard-edged, a bit --

944
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:11,479
could have
military implications.

945
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,047
We never had an ending,
and one day Ray walked in

946
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:18,060
and said, "Forget-me-nots."

947
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,392
Charles said,
"Okay, forget-me-nots."

948
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,331
FRANCO: Forget-me-nots,

949
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,873
the universal symbol
of friendship,

950
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:34,342
translates directly
into Russian,

951
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,936
Nezabudki, "forget me not."

952
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,505
KlRKHAM: They described
Nikita Khrushchev

953
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,916
with tears
running down his cheeks.

954
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:48,754
So you have this wonderful
sort of double ending

955
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:53,353
of the simplicity of a flower,
butthen this "Forget me not."

956
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,127
And it worked
like the best Hollywood movie.

957
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,432
FRANCO: The Moscow show made
Charles and Ray newly famous,

958
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:05,464
not as designers of furniture,
but as communicators.

959
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:09,638
Communicators who used images
ratherthan words.

960
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,049
WECHSLER: Charles was
very wary of words.

961
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,320
It's not about writing a script.

962
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,828
It's about a sequence of images

963
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,159
that can tell a story.

964
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,689
FRANCO: In the Eames film
"Tops,"

965
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,862
there are no words,
just pictures.

966
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:42,175
OPPEWALL: In a way,
the film is a kind of an essay

967
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:45,976
aboutthe nature and meaning
of a top.

968
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,619
In the beginning,
it's all aboutwinding up,

969
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:56,716
getting started,
putting it together,

970
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,023
assembling the materials.

971
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:01,587
And then it's
aboutthrowing them,

972
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,792
seeing how they work,
what they do,

973
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:07,428
how they dance,
how they spin, how they sing,

974
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:11,304
whatever it is
that their meaning is.

975
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,510
But then you come to one moment

976
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,981
where there's an architectural
plan on thetabletop,

977
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:24,487
a blueprint,
and what spins

978
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:27,990
is a thumbtack, and you realize

979
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:32,995
you have suddenly gotten
directly into the essence

980
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:36,499
of what it means to be a top.

981
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:43,739
Things have meaning,
things have personality,

982
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:48,506
things express ideas.

983
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:53,880
Many designers were
and still are happy with

984
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:57,716
the manipulation of objects.

985
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:02,088
Hewas only truly deeply happy

986
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,322
manipulating an idea.

987
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:11,425
FRANCO: Beginning in the 1950s,
the idea ofthe computer

988
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:14,868
triggered fear in the minds
of Americans.

989
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:17,873
ALBRECHT: People were seeing
computers,

990
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,704
and there was a worry
about them.

991
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,802
And this notion
of the electronic brain

992
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:24,312
feeds into fears that we're

993
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,576
going to be taken over
by machines.

994
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:31,912
FRANCO: At the time, computers
were synonymous

995
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:34,980
with just one company -- lBM.

996
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:36,685
SELlGSOHN:
What was lBM's product?

997
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,991
Big vacuum tube machines,
huge room-size machines,

998
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:42,657
building-size machines, so that

999
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:45,929
the average individual
was feeling an alien,

1000
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:50,063
science-fiction type
invasion of my privacy.

1001
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,573
How do you combat that?

1002
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,408
FRANCO: lBM turned
to the Eames Office.

1003
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,644
To overcome the computer's
PR problem,

1004
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:04,778
Charles and Ray set out
to humanize it.

1005
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:08,256
NARRATOR: Properly related,
it can maintain a balance

1006
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:11,385
between man's needs
and his resources.

1007
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,792
ALBRECHT: It's done in this,

1008
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,694
what to us today
looks really corny --

1009
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:19,531
but at the time, this was
thoughtto be radical --

1010
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:23,095
to do a film for a science
company, like a cartoon.

1011
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:26,199
NARRATOR: Something has now
emerged that might make

1012
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:29,040
even our most elegant theories
workable.

1013
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,376
ALBRECHT: And you go
from the abacus.

1014
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,884
As human problems
become more complex,

1015
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,681
people invent
more complicated machines

1016
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,016
to solve those problems,

1017
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:42,923
and the culmination of that is
the computer.

1018
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,788
NARRATOR: This is a story
of a technique

1019
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,923
in the service of mankind.

1020
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,798
ALBRECHT: It's not
going to take over the world,

1021
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,530
it's not going to be robots.

1022
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:57,334
It's the logical
evolutionary progression

1023
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:02,003
of man developing products
to solve problems.

1024
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:05,605
FRANCO: Charles's visionary
interest in computers

1025
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:09,174
helped to bring lBM into
the Eames Office stables.

1026
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,278
But it was not expertise
that made Charles and Ray

1027
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,983
indispensible to
the rapidly growing company.

1028
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:15,559
WURMAN: You sell your expertise,

1029
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,119
WURMAN: You sell your expertise,

1030
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,186
you have a limited repertoire.

1031
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:23,664
You sell your ignorance,
it's an unlimited repertoire.

1032
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,132
He was selling his ignorance

1033
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,636
and his desire to learn
about a subject.

1034
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,103
And the journey --

1035
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:32,141
of him not knowing to knowing --
was his work.

1036
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:40,111
FRANCO: Over two decades,
Charles and Ray would complete

1037
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:44,415
dozens of projects,
large and small, for lBM.

1038
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:48,218
But perhaps the most bold was
their pavilion

1039
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,658
for the 1964 New York
World's Fair,

1040
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:55,129
a 1.2-acre experimental space

1041
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:59,191
celebrating the role
of computers in everyday life.

1042
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,067
ASHBY: I was drawing the stuff

1043
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,701
as fast as he
could conjure it up,

1044
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,472
and they came up with this idea

1045
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:13,744
of putting thattheater
up on top of these trees.

1046
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,081
And so I knew they were going to
have these plungers

1047
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:18,279
going into the ground --
they are going to move,

1048
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,220
you know,
400 people up on this ramp.

1049
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,952
And I knew, as a designer,
I knew I was going to

1050
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:26,621
have to figure out some way
to make all that happen.

1051
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:31,065
And he's just so excited
about this thing.

1052
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:33,728
And I'm just standing there
like that.

1053
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:35,498
And I said,
"Charles, this is just nuts."

1054
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:38,598
And he says, "Yeah, and no one
had told us not to do it."

1055
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:45,504
FRANCO: For the show in Moscow,
they had used seven screens.

1056
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:51,248
But at the lBM Pavilion,
there were 22.

1057
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,552
CAPLAN: Charles was very big on
making people feel welcome.

1058
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:58,287
You don'tjust get them in
an auditorium and showthe film.

1059
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:00,226
You have a host.

1060
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,822
But, uh, it was very hard.

1061
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:11,100
Everything you said not only had
to be memorized and rehearsed,

1062
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:12,607
but it had to be timed,

1063
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,667
so when you pointed
to this screen,

1064
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,611
what you were talking about
appeared on this screen.

1065
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:20,149
And the same with that screen
and all the others.

1066
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:24,380
Butthe problem was,

1067
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:27,150
the host
had a nervous breakdown.

1068
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:31,824
FRANCO: As Charles and Ray's
reputation

1069
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,522
as visual communicators grew,

1070
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:36,258
so did their list
of corporate clients.

1071
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,391
MAN: N is for...

1072
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,163
SlNGERS:
# Navigation equipment #

1073
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,397
# Network protectors #

1074
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,667
# Nuclear plant control #

1075
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:46,936
# Nuclear reactor plants #

1076
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,468
# For surface ships
and submarines #

1077
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,846
FRANCO: Westinghouse,
Boeing, and Polaroid

1078
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:56,044
all trusted the Eames Office

1079
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,917
to solve their problems.

1080
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:22,534
When the Office was hired
by Alcoa

1081
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:23,874
to show off the uses
of aluminum,

1082
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:27,110
they built a solar-powered
Do-Nothing Machine,

1083
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:30,380
which did exactly that.

1084
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,445
SUSSMAN: That was
in the golden years,

1085
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:36,549
when the heads of corporations
would speak,

1086
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:39,186
a chair away from the designer.

1087
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:41,924
So that if you needed
to talk to somebody,

1088
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:44,091
you talked
to the decision maker.

1089
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:48,570
You didn't talk to a manager
who talked to a director

1090
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,265
who talked to a chief director

1091
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,001
who talked to a vice president

1092
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,838
who talked to
a senior vice president

1093
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,935
who talked to
an executive vice president

1094
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,503
who was allowed to talk to God.

1095
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:02,950
SELlGSOHN: Almost never
was there a dissenting voice.

1096
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:05,817
We trusted his decision making
entirely.

1097
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,949
So his freedom to do
and to explain

1098
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,652
and to conceive and execute

1099
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,287
was almost unparalleled.

1100
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:16,298
BEEBE: They didn't have
contracts.

1101
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:17,833
They had a handshake.

1102
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:21,632
All those huge projects
were done on a handshake.

1103
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:24,104
"We're going to give you
the best product,

1104
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:27,109
butwe can't tell you
what it's going to cost."

1105
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:28,974
And for lBM

1106
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:32,378
and for Polaroid,
and for Herman Miller,

1107
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,746
it was okay.

1108
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:37,150
FRANCO: And for Charles,

1109
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,621
these gentlemen's agreements
went both ways.

1110
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:46,287
ASHBY: The budget for
"Mathematica" was $150,000.

1111
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:50,298
It actually ended up
costing $300,000,

1112
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:53,699
and Charles paid
for the $150,000

1113
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,465
that itwent over budget.

1114
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,938
Sothe whole thing
aboutwhatthings cost

1115
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,066
and trying to keep it
within the budget

1116
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,872
and meet the clients,
he didn't care about --

1117
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:06,041
he cared about it, but he just,
he couldn't stop himself.

1118
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:12,114
FRANCO: Charles and Ray's career
began with a utopian notion

1119
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:15,589
of providing low-cost,
high-quality goods to the masses

1120
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,626
through industrial production.

1121
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,662
But they never viewed their work

1122
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:22,163
for corporate titans
as selling out.

1123
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,099
ALBRECHT: They wanted to work
for the Google of their time,

1124
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,331
and they did, and it allowed
them incredible experimentation.

1125
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,702
And they believed they could
have a bigger impact

1126
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,867
on everyday life by working
forthe bigger company.

1127
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,052
FRANCO:
lBM shared Charles's concern

1128
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:50,388
that American kids were falling
behind in math and science.

1129
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,190
And as usual, they gave
the Office free rein

1130
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:54,696
to address the problem.

1131
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,959
Maybe, Charles felt,

1132
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,898
a film could help.

1133
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:01,903
NARRATOR: We begin
with a scene one meter wide,

1134
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,939
which we view from just
one meter away.

1135
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:06,339
Now, every ten seconds,
we will look

1136
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,070
from ten times farther away,

1137
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,977
and our field of view will be
ten times wider.

1138
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,607
FRANCO: "Powers of Ten" would
become the best known

1139
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:17,949
of all the Eames films,
viewed in countless classrooms

1140
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:21,320
and copied freely by
filmmakers around the world.

1141
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,383
SCHRADER: Everyone has seen
"Powers of Ten."

1142
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,758
They may not have seen
the version Charles did,

1143
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,091
but they have seen

1144
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:31,065
one of the countless rip-offs
ofthat film.

1145
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,297
NARRATOR: Ten to the sixth,
a one with six zeros,

1146
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,100
a million meters --
soon the earth will show

1147
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,333
as a solid sphere.

1148
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,775
TONDREAU: Nobody had done
a movie like that.

1149
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:45,610
How can you fail,
doing a cosmic zoom

1150
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:48,344
in and out from all that is?

1151
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,852
And so the concept is,
all by itself, mind-blowing.

1152
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,218
NARRATOR: The trip back to
the picnic on the lakefront

1153
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:56,087
will be a sped-up version,
reducing the distance

1154
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,595
to the Earth's surface by one
power of ten every two seconds.

1155
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:01,721
It's "Ch-ch-ch-ch-shoo,"

1156
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,323
excessive information,
dizzying information.

1157
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,834
NARRATOR: Ten to the ninth
meters,

1158
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,030
ten to the eighth...

1159
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,869
SCHRADER: Like in a chase
sequence in a movie,

1160
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,932
everything is going by so fast,

1161
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,478
it forces the observer to choose
the information

1162
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:17,535
that's truly important,

1163
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,138
which is the car
or the person

1164
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,409
that is running away from you --

1165
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:21,950
i.e., the idea.

1166
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:25,010
NARRATOR: One. We are back
at our starting point.

1167
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,079
SCHRADER: Eames was aware that,
in fact,

1168
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:28,646
that this was somewhat dizzying,

1169
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:29,987
and that it wasn't possible

1170
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,890
to get all
of this information across

1171
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,293
in a single viewing,
and that was fine.

1172
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:37,026
What he probably didn't know

1173
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,331
was that he was also looking
into the future

1174
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,303
of audio-visual perception.

1175
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:45,432
The pace at which we receive
information today

1176
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:51,378
is as fast as he was doing
back then.

1177
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:55,042
NARRATOR: As a single proton
fills our scene,

1178
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:57,313
we reach the edge
of present understanding.

1179
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:00,584
SUSSMAN: As time went on,

1180
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:05,720
Charles became more and more
and more interested in ideas,

1181
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,559
especially science
and mathematics.

1182
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:14,433
Ray was less engaged.

1183
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:20,170
I mean, I'm no mathematician,
and I'm no -- not an architect,

1184
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:23,406
I'm not -- I haven't had
certain training,

1185
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:29,816
so I just try to help in the way
that I -- in any way I can.

1186
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,616
I don't stop to think
whether I can.

1187
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,123
I just go as far as I can.

1188
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:38,354
And if I --

1189
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:43,957
if I can't, I can't.

1190
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,933
TONDREAU: I think Ray
may have suffered

1191
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,697
from a feeling
of marginalization,

1192
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,534
because some
of those last projects

1193
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:54,508
were heavy on ideas
and not as heavy

1194
01:01:54,577 --> 01:02:00,106
on the kind of visual richness
that was Ray's forte.

1195
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,845
GlOVANNlNl: She's no longer
as instrumental

1196
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,216
in the entire thing.

1197
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,811
She can apply an aesthetic,

1198
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,651
she can dress a set, and so on,

1199
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:11,490
but, um, she's no longer
as central.

1200
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:15,930
FRANCO: Ray's exquisite taste,
her eye for form and color,

1201
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,330
made her indispensible
to the Office.

1202
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,700
But it could also be
aterrible burden.

1203
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:31,769
OPPEWALL: I remember peering
into Ray's office

1204
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:33,748
only once or twice,

1205
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:37,650
because when the door opened
and I looked into it,

1206
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:44,523
I thought, "l don't everwant
to look in there again,

1207
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,722
because it's a little
frightening."

1208
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:55,162
ASHBY: Ray had a little room,
smallerthan Charles's,

1209
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,365
directly across the hall
from his,

1210
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,273
thatwas just
absolutely jammed

1211
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:02,903
with all of her little
pieces of paper

1212
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:04,571
and all of her little slides

1213
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:05,944
and all of the little notes

1214
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:07,812
that people had mailed to her

1215
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,318
and that she was mailing
to them.

1216
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,411
BEEBE: And she would go in
and find things.

1217
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:13,716
She would say, "Oh, I have one,"

1218
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,519
and she would disappear
into the room

1219
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:18,219
and come out
with the perfect kite.

1220
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:22,162
Or she'd go in and find
the perfect scarf or something.

1221
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,756
Shewould go,
and she would fuss with it,

1222
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:26,995
and change it one day,

1223
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,060
and the next day,
she would look at it again

1224
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,765
and change
a little something else.

1225
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,468
And I think over the years,

1226
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:36,876
the perfectionism
did get in the way.

1227
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:40,006
In a way, it crippled her.

1228
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:44,075
WOMAN: Here is oh, a picnic
basket, a drawing of a basket.

1229
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,984
Up in Seaview Village,

1230
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,545
so probably Deborah Sussman.

1231
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:51,150
It's a letter
from Lily Saarinen.

1232
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,353
That's cool.

1233
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:53,759
Look at that,
I've never seen that.

1234
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,854
There we go --

1235
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:58,196
"Dearest Queen
of all Pack Rats."

1236
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:01,031
I think it was almost
a nervous tic with her.

1237
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:03,196
She was constantly
making notes,

1238
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:06,571
and usually on the back of
Benson & Hedges wrappers.

1239
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:08,633
This is one of the wrappers,

1240
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:10,269
and on this side

1241
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,371
she designed something
that looks very reminiscent

1242
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:14,916
of some
of herfabric designs.

1243
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:17,452
And you turn it over, and you
see it's a Benson & Hedges.

1244
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,318
And on this side
are notes she made

1245
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:24,052
for lighting ofthe puppet shows

1246
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,923
at the lBM pavilion.

1247
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:28,429
CAPLAN: You'd find them
everywhere.

1248
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:30,021
They'd drive you crazy.

1249
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,761
And they could say, "Buy soap,"

1250
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,769
or "Liver and onions
for dinner,'

1251
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:37,829
or they'd have
very elaborate ideas.

1252
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:40,137
MARlLYN NEUHART:
She had her suits made,

1253
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:43,201
and they had pockets that went
all the way to the hem.

1254
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:44,712
So whatever she wanted to keep,

1255
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,611
she would just shove
in the pockets.

1256
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:49,708
MAN: So what would happen
with these notes?

1257
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,582
McALEER: Well, for a time,
she asked the staff

1258
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,747
to try to type them up,
and I think it became

1259
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,882
too overwhelming
forthe staff.

1260
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:58,358
It was such an avalanche
of notes.

1261
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:02,227
TONDREAU: Ray didn't communicate
like everybody else does.

1262
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,425
She expected that you

1263
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,162
pre-understood
what she was talking about.

1264
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,034
The people who didn't
make the effort

1265
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:13,075
would sometimes use
the epithet "Crazy Rayzy,"

1266
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:15,736
simply because they
didn't understand her.

1267
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:19,508
But Ray is not crazy.
She's brilliant.

1268
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,176
BEEBE: And Ray had
a lot of competition

1269
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,809
for Charles's attention,

1270
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:30,587
which I don't think anybody ever
really gave her credit for.

1271
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,790
That everybody wanted Charles
and not Ray.

1272
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:41,200
OPPEWALL: He was the guy that
the lBM executives would call.

1273
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,795
He was the guy that you went to

1274
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:45,932
to discuss the projects
intellectually.

1275
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:50,138
He was very charismatic.

1276
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,908
Charles was extremely
charismatic.

1277
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:54,176
He was very charismatic.

1278
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,342
He was very handsome.

1279
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:58,717
He was very handsome
and very charismatic.

1280
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,382
I know that word is really
overused, but he was.

1281
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,688
And especially very charismatic
to women.

1282
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:11,663
BLAlCH: He reminded me
of Henry Fonda,

1283
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:15,966
and I met Henry Fonda one time,
and I told Henry Fonda this,

1284
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,300
that I thought
they looked alike,

1285
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,000
and he said,
"That's a compliment."

1286
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:22,374
SUSSMAN: I mean, he had
these dimples,

1287
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,572
and he -- "Aw, shucks,"
kind of guy.

1288
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:30,183
SCHRADER: He was handsome
and smart, and cool.

1289
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,720
So, you know, that's a kind of
lethal combination.

1290
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:34,983
WECHSLER: It was the vision.

1291
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,922
It was the personality.

1292
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,426
It was the charm.

1293
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,394
It was the unexpected.

1294
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:41,589
It was the person.

1295
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:45,430
This is just a small selection

1296
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,492
of letters that I went through

1297
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:52,405
to find things that pertain
particularly to the work.

1298
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:56,571
"ln the next few weeks, I must
pull together a preliminary film

1299
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:59,409
for the 'Franklin and Jefferson'
show."

1300
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,913
And then the rest is personal.

1301
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:16,125
BEEBE: I think their marriage,

1302
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:21,500
it was a mystery to everybody,
in a way.

1303
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:25,870
They were emotionally
extremely bonded.

1304
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:32,642
But he found excitement
and thrills outside of Ray,

1305
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,513
and outside of the Office,

1306
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:40,647
which was really
crushing to her.

1307
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:47,223
WECHSLER: I met him when he was
on the visiting committee

1308
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:49,526
forthe architecture department
at M.I.T.

1309
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:52,658
and I was a young
assistant professor.

1310
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,431
Charles said, "Let's experiment

1311
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,972
with some films on art."

1312
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:06,874
I have many, many letters,
extraordinary letters.

1313
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:09,474
Because we didn't live
in the same city,

1314
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:12,885
we tried to see each other
as we could.

1315
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,219
He had come to London,

1316
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:18,658
and I was there,
and I could not get away.

1317
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:21,059
And he said, "l will come
and stand in front of the house

1318
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:24,361
at a certain time," and l
slipped out of this

1319
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,458
ratherformal dinner,

1320
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:30,266
and there he was, and we just
looked at each other.

1321
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:41,373
We had a very profound love
for each other.

1322
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:49,022
He wanted very much
for us to get married

1323
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:52,390
and to have a child,

1324
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,554
and to close --
he wanted to close

1325
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,154
the Eames Office in Venice,

1326
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:58,097
which he found very burdensome,

1327
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:01,659
and for us to open an office
together in New York.

1328
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:09,104
And I made a decision --

1329
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,078
and I don't know if was
the right decision --

1330
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,581
that I couldn't do it to Ray.

1331
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:15,583
Because I had a friendship
with her,

1332
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,449
but above all because they had
been together so long,

1333
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:22,651
and I knew how much
she depended on him.

1334
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:26,092
And I said, "l can't do it."

1335
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,797
BEEBE: Ray dealtwith it
very privately.

1336
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,964
Shewas hurt deeply,

1337
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,873
but shewasn't
the kind of person

1338
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:44,470
who would have said,
"It's me or her."

1339
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:49,382
OPPEWALL: I don't think
she wanted to leave.

1340
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:54,548
I think itwas something
that she had to accept.

1341
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,318
This wasn't the era

1342
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:59,623
of easy-come, easy-go
relationships.

1343
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:04,632
There was too much
shared life and community,

1344
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,965
and the fact that he, you know,

1345
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,473
had other relationships outside
of the Office...

1346
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:16,836
he seemed to be constructed
that way.

1347
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:21,474
KlRKHAM: But there is a position
that I think is nonsense,

1348
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,678
which is to say that because
Charles was having

1349
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:27,313
a relationship
with somebody else

1350
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,949
that he couldn't then carry on
a collaboration with Ray.

1351
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:31,890
I mean,
that clearly didn't happen.

1352
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,827
FRANCO: In fact, Charles and Ray
were about to collaborate

1353
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,959
on the largest,
most complex project

1354
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:42,731
the Office would
ever undertake.

1355
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:48,035
For the nation's bicentennial
celebration in 1976,

1356
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,305
the Eames Office designed

1357
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,574
"The World
of Franklin and Jefferson,"

1358
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,549
a traveling show made up
of three films,

1359
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:59,577
40,000 words
translated into four languages,

1360
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:02,715
and thousands of photographs
and objects,

1361
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:06,591
including a stuffed bison.

1362
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,961
When "Franklin and Jefferson"
opened in Paris,

1363
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:13,559
it was seen by 50,000 people
in two months.

1364
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:17,037
More than a thousand visitors
saw it each day

1365
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,835
in London and Warsaw.

1366
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,841
But when it came to New York,

1367
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:24,470
the reception was different.

1368
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:28,141
ALBRECHT: When it appeared at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art,

1369
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:31,744
The New Yotk Times reviewed it,
and the headline was,

1370
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:36,018
"What Is This Stuff
Doing at the Met?'

1371
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:37,183
It was one of the first times

1372
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,523
the Eameses were ever
criticized.

1373
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:44,022
It had an enormous
amount of text.

1374
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:47,193
Nobody could have possibly read
it all, it was so dense.

1375
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:52,200
WURMAN: This show was
a bit picky for me,

1376
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:54,242
too many little objects
that I would remember none.

1377
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,743
It was too many things to see.

1378
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:57,278
I can remember about ten things.

1379
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:01,848
He knew so much
about all these things,

1380
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,852
he couldn't edit out something.

1381
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,912
These are things
of the period

1382
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,083
and of the time,
from MountVernon.

1383
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,287
WURMAN: They were all
so interesting to him,

1384
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:15,125
and he was familiarwith them,

1385
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:17,165
and he could see all these
connections.

1386
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:19,496
But you can't keep it all
in your head

1387
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,001
if you're not
that familiarwith it.

1388
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:26,437
OPPEWALL: You could
call it clutter, butthat's not

1389
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:27,907
what Charles
would have called it,

1390
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:30,638
because clutter is
just stuff that's

1391
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:34,410
dropped and abandoned
and forgotten and leftthere.

1392
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:35,950
It was dense,

1393
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,009
and it was complex,

1394
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,681
but there was a mind at work

1395
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,155
placing itthere.

1396
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:45,250
Whether you as the recipient

1397
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:48,319
were willing and able to accept
that is another question.

1398
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,464
ALBRECHT: They're pushing up
against the envelope

1399
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,331
ofwhattechnology could do,

1400
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:57,429
because they're trying to give
the visitor

1401
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:00,669
a hypertext experience,

1402
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,371
but they're doing it
in physical space.

1403
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:04,776
And it doesn'twork.

1404
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:08,214
They are anticipating

1405
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:09,910
what the computer can do today
very easily

1406
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:13,386
with layering text and giving
you at different levels.

1407
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:17,186
So it's a failure,
but it's an honest failure.

1408
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:24,060
The criticism of
"Franklin and Jefferson"

1409
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,896
hit Charles hard.

1410
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:28,869
DEMETRlOS: The
"Franklin and Jefferson" show

1411
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:30,837
was an exhausting show

1412
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,669
because it was huge,

1413
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:36,575
and I think sort of
the machinery of doing that

1414
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:38,840
was just tiring.

1415
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:39,982
TONDREAU: I saw Charles
at his happiest

1416
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:42,644
TONDREAU: I saw Charles
at his happiest

1417
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:45,209
when he was getting to do
a lot of photography.

1418
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:49,087
And he was very engaged directly
on the creative process

1419
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,591
of doing the photographs --

1420
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:53,856
which led me to the idea
that maybe he felt

1421
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:56,591
he was missing something,
you know,

1422
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:58,292
because he had had
the transition

1423
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:01,234
to more of an executive
position at the Office.

1424
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:04,966
BEEBE: It was very hard for him,
because he didn't really have

1425
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,167
a successor,

1426
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:11,008
and for the years
that I was there, he was always

1427
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,274
Iooking for the perfect person.

1428
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,509
It was a battle one day

1429
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:19,680
with the lBM representative,
Mike Sullivan,

1430
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:22,656
and Mike said,
"Why don't you shutthis down?'

1431
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,021
And he said, "I'd like to."

1432
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:25,821
And Sullivan said,
"Whatwould you do?'

1433
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:30,524
And he said, "I'd just travel
and shoot."

1434
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:34,160
"But," he said, "l don't know
what to do about Ray,

1435
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,830
and closing the Office."

1436
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:39,874
BEEBE: He was tired, and he was,

1437
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:42,376
I don't know if it was his
heart, but he was cold a lot.

1438
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:45,106
I brought him one morning --
it was a Saturday morning,

1439
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,977
and I'd made applesauce cake
or something,

1440
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,539
and I brought it to the office,

1441
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:51,279
and I handed it to Charles
wrapped in tin foil,

1442
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:53,844
and itwas still warm,
and he took it,

1443
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,412
pressed it to his chest,

1444
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,288
and he was thrilled
to have that warmth

1445
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:00,021
just sort of on his chest.

1446
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:20,343
JOHN NEUHART: I was out of
the office the day that he died.

1447
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:25,148
It was, in a way,
it was expected.

1448
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:31,188
SUSSMAN: It just didn't
seem possible.

1449
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,024
I mean, I knew that some people
that Charles worked with,

1450
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:36,690
men in the East, wept.

1451
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:47,368
He was such a dominant force in
the lives of designers that...

1452
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:53,843
it was like there was suddenly
a big empty hole.

1453
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:00,378
OPPEWALL: There are still days

1454
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:02,889
when I'm driving
down the highway,

1455
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,223
thinking about things,
and I think,

1456
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:08,786
"Why did you die?

1457
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:11,958
I'm notthrough with you yet!

1458
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:16,664
I haven't finished asking you
the questions I wanted to ask."

1459
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:27,646
He was the most important person
in my life.

1460
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:33,448
I mean, he could be, he could
really be tough, you know,

1461
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:35,990
but he...

1462
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,962
he was an extraordinary
person.

1463
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,263
BEEBE: After Charles died,

1464
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:53,968
suddenly Ray was

1465
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,805
the head of the Office.

1466
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,348
She gathered everybody around,

1467
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:04,044
and she talked about her goals
and what she wanted to do,

1468
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:07,555
and how she needed
our help.

1469
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:10,615
And it was really very powerful,

1470
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,489
because she had never
donethat before.

1471
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:17,021
But she feltthis huge burden
about carrying on the name

1472
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:18,862
and carrying on the Office.

1473
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:22,893
And I think itwas killing her.

1474
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,235
And I said, "Come on, Ray,
why don't you

1475
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,333
just close the Office,
and let's go and paint."

1476
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,810
And she said
"No, that's all in the past.

1477
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:32,744
I can't do that anymore."

1478
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,717
FRANCO: Without Charles,

1479
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:41,119
activity in the Eames Office
dwindled,

1480
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:44,556
until it was time
to finally close 901.

1481
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,559
Ray focused
on the painstaking work

1482
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:52,623
of cataloguing the voluminous
40-year output

1483
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:55,795
of the Eames Office.

1484
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:59,432
Nearly 350,000 photographs

1485
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,999
and half a million documents
had to be organized for shipment

1486
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:05,376
to the Library of Congress.

1487
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,817
But over the years,
a new generation

1488
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:14,549
Iifted Ray
from Charles's shadow,

1489
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:17,683
discovering in her
exuberant design sense

1490
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:21,490
a refreshing alternative
to the austerity of modernism.

1491
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:26,529
And Ray seemed to finally
find her voice

1492
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:31,732
as one of the most influential
women of American design.

1493
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:34,571
Best for the most for the least,

1494
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,634
that was always the principle.

1495
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,646
That's why we became interested

1496
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:39,976
in mass production.

1497
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:43,950
SUSSMAN: At that point,

1498
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,954
women began to point to Ray.

1499
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:48,512
You know, "lf there are
two Eameses,

1500
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,057
why aren't they both credited?'

1501
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,422
And now, of course, they are.

1502
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:15,516
BEEBE: She kept saying, in
the hospital, "What day is it?'

1503
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:19,543
And I would say,
"It's Wednesday the 18th."

1504
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,646
And she would say, "Oh."

1505
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:23,156
And then the next time
I would come,

1506
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:25,557
then she would say,
"What day is it?'

1507
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:26,719
"It's Thursday."

1508
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:28,126
"Oh."

1509
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:36,969
I think she wanted to die
on the same day as Charles

1510
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:41,407
because it sort of symbolized
their being one.

1511
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:52,409
Her last statement was one
of being with Charles.

1512
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:14,403
This guy and that guy
could trade places.

1513
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:17,070
There's probably an Eames chair

1514
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:19,773
Iiterally in every single issue
thatwe've published.

1515
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:20,872
You know, you could go

1516
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:22,780
from the DAX to the DSS
to the LCW,

1517
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,682
you know, you'll get
thiswhole range.

1518
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,550
MAN:
Clockwise just a little.

1519
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:27,610
Just a little.

1520
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:31,318
Thefurniture still has
a quality

1521
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:32,655
that every young designer

1522
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:34,661
is searching for,
because of the amount of thought

1523
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:36,424
that's been put into it

1524
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:40,628
by everyone whose hands touch
the project.

1525
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:43,762
I think you see that optimism
of the American spirit

1526
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,069
in their design.

1527
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:47,870
It provided
just a great blueprint

1528
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:49,638
for how we could live our lives.

1529
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,810
PEATROSS: What furniture
designers

1530
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:56,817
ever have produced
40 to 50 pieces of furniture

1531
01:20:56,885 --> 01:21:00,321
that have been in production
for five decades?

1532
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:03,687
Butthe other thing is
the sheer joy,

1533
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,623
that aspect of play.

1534
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:09,289
No one else, I think,
had that combination

1535
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:12,299
of the pragmatic
and the aesthetic.

1536
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,528
NARRATOR: Seven...

1537
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:17,572
SUSSMAN: They loved to say,
"We don't do art.

1538
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:19,664
We solve problems."

1539
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:20,799
It's the process.

1540
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,537
It's, how do we get
from where we are

1541
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:25,273
to where we want to be?

1542
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:26,905
NARRATOR: Grasp the rear
of the viewfinder...

1543
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:29,507
DEMETRlOS: Charles and Ray were
always looking to the future.

1544
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:31,074
They weren't
sort of sitting around,

1545
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:33,052
telling war stories about
organic furniture.

1546
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:34,349
What they were doing is like,

1547
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:36,583
"What's the nextthing?'

1548
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:39,627
ALBRECHT: They were there

1549
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:41,719
for the major moments
in American history,

1550
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:44,196
and they were really the
pioneers of the information age.

1551
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:47,064
NARRATOR: The visitor
can try out the computer

1552
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:48,796
as a carrier of information.

1553
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:51,498
ALBRECHT: The breadth
of the work is extraordinary,

1554
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:55,475
but there is also a unifying
theme of beauty

1555
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:58,774
and a desire to reach
a broad audience.

1556
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:01,577
So if it was pulled forward
a little bit?

1557
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:04,175
Every designer owes them
some amount of debt,

1558
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:08,188
but at the same time, part of
that debt should be to kind of

1559
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:12,556
take what they did
and move beyond it.
