CHARLES EAMES: An artist is
a title that you earn.
 “艺术家”的名头是靠自己赢得的

2
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,458
And it's a little embarrassing
to hear
当人们自称“艺术家”的时候

3
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,094
people refer to themselves
听上去有点

4
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,399
as artists.
让人尴尬


5
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:42,305
It's like referring to
themselves as a genius.
就好像你自称“天才”一样

was something
we all wanted to be.

and again in film,

17
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,910
it never seemed like leaving
painting in any way,
却从未感觉与绘画完全脱离了关系

18
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,002
because it was
just anotherform.
因为这只是绘画的另一种形式

what she was surrounded by.
她总是以身遭事物为题创作绘画

00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,460
For them, these names like
painter and architect,

26
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,193
they weren't job descriptions.
并不是他们工作的准确描述

27
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,666
They were ways of looking
at the world.

WOMAN: They were

all this joy back in life.

34
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,319
You know that modernism,
let's face it,
我们不得不承认时至今日

35
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,415
was getting boring.
现代主义已经越来越无聊了

36

MAN: Had they just designed
the furniture,
仅靠家俱设计的成就

37
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,928
they'd be in the pantheon.
伊姆斯夫妇就可以扬名立万了

38
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,899
It's the multifaceted nature
of the career

that is extraordinary.

20th century.

I walk into Eames Office,

00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,233
Upholstery is what
Louis XlV did.
家俱上的繁复装饰代表着路易十四式的陈旧暮气

135
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:27,507
FRANCO: Working at the Cranbrook
Academy of Art near Detroit,
在底特律近郊的克兰布鲁克艺术学院

136
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,639
Eames and Saarinen thought they
could mold
Eames和Saarinen想到一种可以

137
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,444
the new miracle material,
plywood,
通过模具成型的神奇材料 胶合板

138
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,779
into two directions at once
它可以向两个不同方向弯曲

139
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,548
to make a comfortable,
form-fitting shell.
而形成舒适、合体的形状

140
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,851
WOMAN: The critical point
关键问题在于

141
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,018
is where that back
becomes the seat.
椅背的处理

142
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,358
ALBRECHT: The glues aren't good
enough, and the chair splinters,
胶水粘合的效果并不好
椅身容易有裂缝

143
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,658
which means,
when you'd sit on it,
这就意味着你坐上去时

144
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,993
itwould be a little
uncomfortable.
会有些不舒服

145
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,057
So they have to upholster it.
所以必须装上椅套

146
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,864
FRANCO: Despite failing
尽管整块胶合板成型的

147
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:54,373
at their goal of creating
a single-piece plywood shell,
理念失败了

148
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,672
Charles and Eero
won the competition.
Charles和Saarinen最终还是赢得了竞赛

149
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,475
WOMAN: The irony is that
具有讽刺意味的是

150
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,346
the chairthat
Eames and Saarinen designed,
Charles和Saarinen设计的椅子

151
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,716
they couldn't really
manufacture.
无法真正地加工制造出来

152
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,848
FRANCO: Even with the upholstery
to cover the cracked surface,
尽管可以用椅套掩盖表面的裂缝

153
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:15,553
no existing machine could
successfully mold the plywood
却不存在可以成功地将胶合板

154
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,823
into the shape of the chair.
塑压成型的机器

155
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,125
MAN: It couldn't be made
因为无法像他们声称的那样
156
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,758
in the way that they claimed
it could be made.
制造出这把椅子

157
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,529
They had designed
the look of it
他们只创造了椅子的外形

158
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,537
without designing
the substance of it.
而无法制造出它的实体

159
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,371
FRANCO: After many unsuccessful
attempts,
经过多次失败的尝试

160
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,501
Eero Saarinen scrapped
the project.
Eero Saarinen放弃了这个项目

161
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,704
But Charles wasn't ready
to give up --
但Charles并没有完全心灰意冷

162
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,475
this time, with a new partner.
这一次 他有了新的搭档

163
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:36,582
At Cranbrook, he had become
friendly with Ray Kaiser,
在克兰布鲁克 他与Ray Kaiser关系亲近起来

164
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:40,575
At Cranbrook, he had become
friendly with Ray Kaiser,
在克兰布鲁克 他与Ray Kaiser关系亲近起来

a talented young artist who had
helped with the chair project.
她年轻而极具天赋 协助他完成椅子的设计项目

166
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,518
MARlLYN NEUHART:
I said to Ray one day,
某天我问Ray

167
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,390
"How did you and Charles
get together?'

168
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,397
"Oh! I can't talk about it."

169
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,523
I said, "Well, why not?'
我问她 为什么呢

170
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,658
"Well, we just did."
我们就是自然而然地在一起了

171
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,501
DEMETRlOS: They sparked, and
the rest is literally history.
他们之间擦出了火花
之后种种已写进历史

172
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,062
And I think in Ray,
我觉得有了Ray

173
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,937
he really found his complement.
他才真正地完整起来

174
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,500
FRANCO: But there was a problem.
可是问题在于

175
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,274
Charles was already married.
Charles已经结婚了

176
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:11,282
He had moved up to Cranbrook
from St. Louis

177
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,013
with his wife, Catherine,
and his young daughter, Lucia.
从圣路易斯搬到克兰布鲁克的

178
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:22,994
KlRKHAM: The love letters are
Charles's letters to Ray,
现存的情书都是Charles写给Ray的

179
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,623
because the letters that Ray
wrote back to Charles,
由于Charles的已婚状态

180
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,634
Charles destroyed,
because he was married.
Ray的回信都被Charles销毁了

181
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,468
They show Charles madly in love
with her.
这些书信表达了Charles对Ray近乎疯狂的爱

182
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,370
There's no doubt about that.
这是毫无疑问的

183
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,841
He talks about walking past
信中他说起路过
184
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,571
the building
that she used to live in
Ray曾经住过的房子

185
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,839
and looking up at her window,

186
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,108
and they are very moving.
让他们内心触动不已

187
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:47,619
These letters are talking about
这些书信中 谈起他们

188
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:54,115
a joined future
as artists together.

189
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,458
I think
his decision feels made.
我认为他已下定决心

190
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:02,433
Ray certainly felt uncomfortable
enough to leave Cranbrook
可以肯定Ray并不愿意离开克兰布鲁克

191
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,799
and go away and think about
远走他乡并对今后

192
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,135
what she was going to do
thereafter.
的选择加以考量

193
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,537
DEMETRlOS: Catherine was
a very impressive person.
Catherine是那种容易给人留下深刻印象的人

194
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,877
Knowing them both, as I did,
同我一样知道他们俩的存在

195
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,782
you can see why
they didn't stay together.
可以想像她后来并没有和Charles在一起

196
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:24,118
He really thought he had
something to offer the world,
Charles真的认为他能给世界带来不同

197
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,387
and this was going to be
a journey
而这过程将是一场充满未知

198
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,361
with a lot
of unexpectedness.
的伟大旅程

199
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:34,024
This was a journey that might
not lead to, uh, success.
这旅程的终点或许并不是“成功”

200
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,193
And I think that maybe
at that point in her life,
我认为就此而言 对于Catherine来说

201
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,633
this was not necessarily
这个旅程的终点

202
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:41,969
the place that Catherine
wanted to go.
并不是她想到达的彼岸

203
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,236
But I think that maybe
in Charles's mind
但我想对Charles来说

204
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,974
that he had wanted a life
where love and work
他梦想拥有的 是爱情与事业

205
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,778
and life and work
were all blended together.
生活与事业 可以紧密地相连

206
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,511
FRANCO: Charles quit his job
at Cranbrook,
Charles辞去了克兰布鲁克的工作

207
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:01,583
and, in one last letterto Ray,
asked for her hand in marriage.
在给Ray的最后一封信中
向她求了婚

208
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,298
His future with his new bride
他和他新婚妻子的未来

209
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:11,860
now depended
on making the chairwork.
如今都取决于怎样造出那把椅子

210
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,406
Broke and short on options,
在经济拮据且无路可走的情况下

211
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,310
Charles and Ray
headed from Michigan to L.A.
Charles和Ray从密歇根搬到了洛杉矶

212
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,315
to finish what he had started.
去完成他最初的野望

213
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,977
DEMETRlOS: Part of this journey
to California was
对他们来说这场加州之旅

214
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,953
they were both
going to figure out
的意义一部分在于

215
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,252
how to mass-produce molded
plywood and compound curves --
解决怎样大批量生产模塑胶合板
及其复杂曲线的问题

216
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,656
which sounds very unromantic,
but I think it probably
听上去一点也不浪漫
但我认为

217
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,752
was pretty romantic,
underthe circumstances.
在这种困境之下
也许正好相反


218
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,458
FRANCO: In their two-bedroom
apartment in Westwood Village,
在他们位于西木区只有两间卧室的公寓里

219
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,991
Charles and Ray set up
a makeshift workshop.
Charles和Ray建起一个临时工坊

220
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,538
RAY EAMES: The --
the first to --
当时 第一次

221
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,197
that did the molding,
的模压成品

222
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,765
which was so magic,
真的很神奇

223
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,403
we called it by a magic name.
我们给它起了个充满魔力的名字

224
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,709
So we called it "Kazam!"
我们叫它"Kazam!"

225
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,979
FRANCO: The "Kazam!" machine was
a jury-rigged molding device
制造"Kazam!"的机器是一台临时装配的塑模机

226
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,714
made out of heating coils
and a bicycle pump.
由加热线圈和暖气管加工而成

227
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,554
But in 1942,
with the nation atwar,
但在战时的1942年

228
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:11,528
raw materials were scarce,
and the "Kazam!" lay silent.
原材料稀缺
"Kazam!"也无人问津

229
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,134
Butwith the setback,
there was also opportunity.
纵然难免遭遇挫折
机会却并非渺茫

230
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:23,369
The U.S. military
needed better splints.
当时美国军方需要更好使的医用夹板

231
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,639
DEMETRlOS: The standard-issue
splintwas metallic,
由于普通夹板为金属材料制成

232
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,509
and so the vibration of
the two people carrying them
在两人搬运伤员时造成的振动

233
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,845
actually would make
the wound worse.
往往使伤口情况恶化

234
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,213
Theywould actually be
better off
但如果从地下捡根树枝

235
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,252
if you grabbed a stick
off the ground and tied it to it
绑上作为固定 的确会比用金属夹板固定

236
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,480
than with this
amplification.
造成的振动要少得多

237
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,784
So Charles and Ray said,
"Well, you know,
所以Charles和Ray表示

238
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,087
we're experimenting
with molded plywood.
我们既然在塑压胶合板上
反复实验

239
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,423
Why don't we try
and design a new splint?'
为什么不去设计一种新的医用夹板呢

240
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,987
They're trying to make
a three-dimensional curve,
他们试着制造出 有着三维曲面

241
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,293
kind of a bowl, you might say.
可以说有点像碗状的器具

242
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,129
They can't quite do it yet.
开始他们并没有成功地造出来

243
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,761
So they need holes
in the plywood
胶合板上必须有洞

244
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:52,963
in order to release the tension,
才能释放压力

245
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,471
'cause otherwise
it's going to splinter
否则当你试图弯曲时

246
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,529
where they try to do it.
夹板会开裂

247
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,132
Butworking within
the constraints,
但是这些不利因素

248
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,200
what's nice is that this is
exactly what you need
却成为制造夹板的优势

249
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,678
for a splint, 'cause you need
a place for the bandages to go.
因为夹板需要可以绑绷带的地方

250
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:05,615
FRANCO: In a rented warehouse
space,
Eames夫妇在租来的仓库里

251
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,551
their team of skilled designers
and craftspeople
集合起经验丰富的设计师和手工工匠

252
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,988
made 150,000 splints.
制造出15万个医用夹板

253
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,117
With peace approaching,
Charles and Ray
随着时间推移

254
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,492
had one thing on their minds --
Charles与Ray考虑着同一件事 
即

255
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,327
applying the lessons
of the splints
把从制造医用夹板中获得的经验

256
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,867
to the failed
plywood chairs.
应用到历经失败的胶合板椅中去

257
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:26,962
Thistime, they wouldn't design
the look of the chairfirst.
这一次 他们将不再从椅子的外形着手

258
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,837
DEMETRlOS: They would never make
that mistake again.
他们不会再犯相同的错误

259
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,810
They would let the design flow
from the learning.
而是将习得的经验运用到设计中去

260
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,041
FRANCO: That meant
knowing who they were serving.

it's a river.
都好比一条河流

391
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,390

and it ends at another point.

dumpling in a doll's dress,
她就好像一只美味的

actually just Charles's business

as little more

当时只有十几二十个学生

491
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:50,477

out of which

00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,115
the new American art

Iike Mondrian, Paul Klee,

495

but he was communicating them
但并非当作教科书一样

496
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:12,007
not as textbook learning, but as
this incredibly visceral
生搬硬套
而是总其内在的

497
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,806
sensation.

that had been very static
让人觉得原本凝滞的画面

503
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,992
was dynamic.

that Ray learned

00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:09,290
And Charles depended
on her aesthetic genius.
Charles则依赖于她的美学天赋

513

like that.
我就那么在一边旁观着

Everything you said not only had

主持时所说的不一定非得是记过台本和排练过的

1062
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:12,607
but it had to be timed,

Maybe, Charles felt,

1132
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,898
a film could help.
拍摄一部影片是不错的应对方法

1133
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:01,903
NARRATOR: We begin
with a scene one meter wide,

1134
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,939
which we view from just
one meter away.

1135
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:06,339
Now, every ten seconds,
we will look

1136
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,070
from ten times farther away,

1137
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,977
and our field of view will be
ten times wider.

1138
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,607
FRANCO: "Powers of Ten" would
become the best known

1139
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:17,949
of all the Eames films,
viewed in countless classrooms

1140
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:21,320
and copied freely by
filmmakers around the world.

1141
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,383
SCHRADER: Everyone has seen
"Powers of Ten."

1142
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,758
They may not have seen
the version Charles did,

1143
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,091
but they have seen

1144
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:31,065
one of the countless rip-offs
ofthat film.

1145
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,297
NARRATOR: Ten to the sixth,
a one with six zeros,

1146
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,100
a million meters --
soon the earth will show

1147
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,333
as a solid sphere.

1148
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,775
TONDREAU: Nobody had done
a movie like that.

1149
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:45,610
How can you fail,
doing a cosmic zoom

1150
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:48,344
in and out from all that is?

1151
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,852
And so the concept is,
all by itself, mind-blowing.

1152
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,218
NARRATOR: The trip back to
the picnic on the lakefront

1153
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:56,087
will be a sped-up version,
reducing the distance

1154
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,595
to the Earth's surface by one
power of ten every two seconds.

1155
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:01,721
It's "Ch-ch-ch-ch-shoo,"

1156
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,323
excessive information,
dizzying information.

1157
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,834
NARRATOR: Ten to the ninth
meters,

1158
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,030
ten to the eighth...

1159
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,869
SCHRADER: Like in a chase
sequence in a movie,

1160
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,932
everything is going by so fast,

1161
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,478
it forces the observer to choose
the information

1162
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:17,535
that's truly important,

1163
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,138
which is the car
or the person

1164
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,409
that is running away from you --

1165
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:21,950
i.e., the idea.

1166
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:25,010
NARRATOR: One. We are back
at our starting point.

1167
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,079
SCHRADER: Eames was aware that,
in fact,

1168
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:28,646
that this was somewhat dizzying,

1169
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:29,987
and that it wasn't possible

1170
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,890
to get all
of this information across

1171
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,293
in a single viewing,
and that was fine.

1172
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:37,026
What he probably didn't know

1173
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,331
was that he was also looking
into the future

1174
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,303
of audio-visual perception.

1175
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:45,432
The pace at which we receive
information today

1176
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:51,378
is as fast as he was doing
back then.

1177
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:55,042
NARRATOR: As a single proton
fills our scene,

1178
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:57,313
we reach the edge
of present understanding.

1179
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:00,584
SUSSMAN: As time went on,

1180
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:05,720
Charles became more and more
and more interested in ideas,

1181
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,559
especially science
and mathematics.

1182
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:14,433
Ray was less engaged.

1183
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:20,170
I mean, I'm no mathematician,
and I'm no -- not an architect,

1184
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:23,406
I'm not -- I haven't had
certain training,

1185
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:29,816
so I just try to help in the way
that I -- in any way I can.

1186
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,616
I don't stop to think
whether I can.

1187
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,123
I just go as far as I can.

1188
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:38,354
And if I --

1189
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:43,957
if I can't, I can't.

1190
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,933
TONDREAU: I think Ray
may have suffered

1191
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,697
from a feeling
of marginalization,

1192
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,534
because some
of those last projects

1193
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:54,508
were heavy on ideas
and not as heavy

1194
01:01:54,577 --> 01:02:00,106
on the kind of visual richness
that was Ray's forte.

1195
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,845
GlOVANNlNl: She's no longer
as instrumental

1196
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,216
in the entire thing.

1197
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,811
She can apply an aesthetic,

1198
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,651
she can dress a set, and so on,

1199
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:11,490
but, um, she's no longer
as central.

1200
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:15,930
FRANCO: Ray's exquisite taste,
her eye for form and color,

1201
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,330
made her indispensible
to the Office.

1202
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,700
But it could also be
aterrible burden.

1203
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:31,769
OPPEWALL: I remember peering
into Ray's office

1204
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:33,748
only once or twice,

1205
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:37,650
because when the door opened
and I looked into it,

1206
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:44,523
I thought, "l don't everwant
to look in there again,

1207
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,722
because it's a little
frightening."

1208
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:55,162
ASHBY: Ray had a little room,
smallerthan Charles's,

1209
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,365
directly across the hall
from his,

1210
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,273
thatwas just
absolutely jammed

1211
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:02,903
with all of her little
pieces of paper

1212
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:04,571
and all of her little slides

1213
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:05,944
and all of the little notes

1214
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:07,812
that people had mailed to her

1215
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,318
and that she was mailing
to them.

1216
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,411
BEEBE: And she would go in
and find things.

1217
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:13,716
She would say, "Oh, I have one,"

1218
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,519
and she would disappear
into the room

1219
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:18,219
and come out
with the perfect kite.

1220
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:22,162
Or she'd go in and find
the perfect scarf or something.

1221
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,756
Shewould go,
and she would fuss with it,

1222
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:26,995
and change it one day,

1223
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,060
and the next day,
she would look at it again

1224
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,765
and change
a little something else.

1225
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,468
And I think over the years,

1226
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:36,876
the perfectionism
did get in the way.

1227
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:40,006
In a way, it crippled her.

1228
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:44,075
WOMAN: Here is oh, a picnic
basket, a drawing of a basket.

1229
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,984
Up in Seaview Village,

1230
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,545
so probably Deborah Sussman.

1231
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:51,150
It's a letter
from Lily Saarinen.

1232
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,353
That's cool.

1233
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:53,759
Look at that,
I've never seen that.

1234
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,854
There we go --

1235
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:58,196
"Dearest Queen
of all Pack Rats."

1236
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:01,031
I think it was almost
a nervous tic with her.

1237
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:03,196
She was constantly
making notes,

1238
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:06,571
and usually on the back of
Benson & Hedges wrappers.

1239
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:08,633
This is one of the wrappers,

1240
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:10,269
and on this side

1241
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,371
she designed something
that looks very reminiscent

1242
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:14,916
of some
of herfabric designs.

1243
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:17,452
And you turn it over, and you
see it's a Benson & Hedges.

1244
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,318
And on this side
are notes she made

1245
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:24,052
for lighting ofthe puppet shows

1246
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,923
at the lBM pavilion.

1247
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:28,429
CAPLAN: You'd find them
everywhere.

1248
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:30,021
They'd drive you crazy.

1249
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,761
And they could say, "Buy soap,"

1250
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,769
or "Liver and onions
for dinner,'

1251
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:37,829
or they'd have
very elaborate ideas.

1252
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:40,137
MARlLYN NEUHART:
She had her suits made,

1253
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:43,201
and they had pockets that went
all the way to the hem.

1254
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:44,712
So whatever she wanted to keep,

1255
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,611
she would just shove
in the pockets.

1256
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:49,708
MAN: So what would happen
with these notes?

1257
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,582
McALEER: Well, for a time,
she asked the staff

1258
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,747
to try to type them up,
and I think it became

1259
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,882
too overwhelming
forthe staff.

1260
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:58,358
It was such an avalanche
of notes.

1261
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:02,227
TONDREAU: Ray didn't communicate
like everybody else does.

1262
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,425
She expected that you

1263
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,162
pre-understood
what she was talking about.

1264
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,034
The people who didn't
make the effort

1265
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:13,075
would sometimes use
the epithet "Crazy Rayzy,"

1266
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:15,736
simply because they
didn't understand her.

1267
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:19,508
But Ray is not crazy.
She's brilliant.

1268
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,176
BEEBE: And Ray had
a lot of competition

1269
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,809
for Charles's attention,

1270
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:30,587
which I don't think anybody ever
really gave her credit for.

1271
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,790
That everybody wanted Charles
and not Ray.

1272
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:41,200
OPPEWALL: He was the guy that
the lBM executives would call.

1273
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,795
He was the guy that you went to

1274
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:45,932
to discuss the projects
intellectually.

1275
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:50,138
He was very charismatic.

1276
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,908
Charles was extremely
charismatic.

1277
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:54,176
He was very charismatic.

1278
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,342
He was very handsome.

1279
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:58,717
He was very handsome
and very charismatic.

1280
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,382
I know that word is really
overused, but he was.

1281
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,688
And especially very charismatic
to women.

1282
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:11,663
BLAlCH: He reminded me
of Henry Fonda,

1283
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:15,966
and I met Henry Fonda one time,
and I told Henry Fonda this,

1284
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,300
that I thought
they looked alike,

1285
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,000
and he said,
"That's a compliment."

1286
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:22,374
SUSSMAN: I mean, he had
these dimples,

1287
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,572
and he -- "Aw, shucks,"
kind of guy.

1288
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:30,183
SCHRADER: He was handsome
and smart, and cool.

1289
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,720
So, you know, that's a kind of
lethal combination.

1290
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:34,983
WECHSLER: It was the vision.

1291
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,922
It was the personality.

1292
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,426
It was the charm.

1293
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,394
It was the unexpected.

1294
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:41,589
It was the person.

1295
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:45,430
This is just a small selection

1296
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,492
of letters that I went through

1297
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:52,405
to find things that pertain
particularly to the work.

1298
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:56,571
"ln the next few weeks, I must
pull together a preliminary film

1299
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:59,409
for the 'Franklin and Jefferson'
show."

1300
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,913
And then the rest is personal.

1301
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:16,125
BEEBE: I think their marriage,

1302
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:21,500
it was a mystery to everybody,
in a way.

1303
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:25,870
They were emotionally
extremely bonded.

1304
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:32,642
But he found excitement
and thrills outside of Ray,

1305
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,513
and outside of the Office,

1306
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:40,647
which was really
crushing to her.

1307
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:47,223
WECHSLER: I met him when he was
on the visiting committee

1308
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:49,526
forthe architecture department
at M.I.T.

1309
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:52,658
and I was a young
assistant professor.

1310
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,431
Charles said, "Let's experiment

1311
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,972
with some films on art."

1312
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:06,874
I have many, many letters,
extraordinary letters.

1313
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:09,474
Because we didn't live
in the same city,

1314
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:12,885
we tried to see each other
as we could.

1315
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,219
He had come to London,

1316
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:18,658
and I was there,
and I could not get away.

1317
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:21,059
And he said, "l will come
and stand in front of the house

1318
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:24,361
at a certain time," and l
slipped out of this

1319
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,458
ratherformal dinner,

1320
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:30,266
and there he was, and we just
looked at each other.

1321
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:41,373
We had a very profound love
for each other.

1322
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:49,022
He wanted very much
for us to get married

1323
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:52,390
and to have a child,

1324
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,554
and to close --
he wanted to close

1325
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,154
the Eames Office in Venice,

1326
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:58,097
which he found very burdensome,

1327
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:01,659
and for us to open an office
together in New York.

1328
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:09,104
And I made a decision --

1329
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,078
and I don't know if was
the right decision --

1330
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,581
that I couldn't do it to Ray.

1331
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:15,583
Because I had a friendship
with her,

1332
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,449
but above all because they had
been together so long,

1333
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:22,651
and I knew how much
she depended on him.

1334
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:26,092
And I said, "l can't do it."

1335
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,797
BEEBE: Ray dealtwith it
very privately.

1336
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,964
Shewas hurt deeply,

1337
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,873
but shewasn't
the kind of person

1338
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:44,470
who would have said,
"It's me or her."

1339
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:49,382
OPPEWALL: I don't think
she wanted to leave.

1340
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:54,548
I think itwas something
that she had to accept.

1341
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,318
This wasn't the era

1342
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:59,623
of easy-come, easy-go
relationships.

1343
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:04,632
There was too much
shared life and community,

1344
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,965
and the fact that he, you know,

1345
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,473
had other relationships outside
of the Office...

1346
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:16,836
he seemed to be constructed
that way.

1347
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:21,474
KlRKHAM: But there is a position
that I think is nonsense,

1348
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,678
which is to say that because
Charles was having

1349
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:27,313
a relationship
with somebody else

1350
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,949
that he couldn't then carry on
a collaboration with Ray.

1351
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:31,890
I mean,
that clearly didn't happen.

1352
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,827
FRANCO: In fact, Charles and Ray
were about to collaborate

1353
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,959
on the largest,
most complex project

1354
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:42,731
the Office would
ever undertake.

1355
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:48,035
For the nation's bicentennial
celebration in 1976,

1356
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,305
the Eames Office designed

1357
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,574
"The World
of Franklin and Jefferson,"

1358
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,549
a traveling show made up
of three films,

1359
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:59,577
40,000 words
translated into four languages,

1360
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:02,715
and thousands of photographs
and objects,

1361
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:06,591
including a stuffed bison.

1362
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,961
When "Franklin and Jefferson"
opened in Paris,

1363
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:13,559
it was seen by 50,000 people
in two months.

1364
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:17,037
More than a thousand visitors
saw it each day

1365
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,835
in London and Warsaw.

1366
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,841
But when it came to New York,

1367
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:24,470
the reception was different.

1368
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:28,141
ALBRECHT: When it appeared at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art,

1369
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:31,744
The New Yotk Times reviewed it,
and the headline was,

1370
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:36,018
"What Is This Stuff
Doing at the Met?'

1371
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:37,183
It was one of the first times

1372
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,523
the Eameses were ever
criticized.

1373
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:44,022
It had an enormous
amount of text.

1374
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:47,193
Nobody could have possibly read
it all, it was so dense.

1375
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:52,200
WURMAN: This show was
a bit picky for me,

1376
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:54,242
too many little objects
that I would remember none.

1377
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,743
It was too many things to see.

1378
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:57,278
I can remember about ten things.

1379
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:01,848
He knew so much
about all these things,

1380
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,852
he couldn't edit out something.

1381
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,912
These are things
of the period

1382
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,083
and of the time,
from MountVernon.

1383
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,287
WURMAN: They were all
so interesting to him,

1384
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:15,125
and he was familiarwith them,

1385
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:17,165
and he could see all these
connections.

1386
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:19,496
But you can't keep it all
in your head

1387
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,001
if you're not
that familiarwith it.

1388
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:26,437
OPPEWALL: You could
call it clutter, butthat's not

1389
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:27,907
what Charles
would have called it,

1390
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:30,638
because clutter is
just stuff that's

1391
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:34,410
dropped and abandoned
and forgotten and leftthere.

1392
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:35,950
It was dense,

1393
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,009
and it was complex,

1394
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,681
but there was a mind at work

1395
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,155
placing itthere.

1396
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:45,250
Whether you as the recipient

1397
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:48,319
were willing and able to accept
that is another question.

1398
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,464
ALBRECHT: They're pushing up
against the envelope

1399
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,331
ofwhattechnology could do,

1400
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:57,429
because they're trying to give
the visitor

1401
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:00,669
a hypertext experience,

1402
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,371
but they're doing it
in physical space.

1403
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:04,776
And it doesn'twork.

1404
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:08,214
They are anticipating

1405
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:09,910
what the computer can do today
very easily

1406
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:13,386
with layering text and giving
you at different levels.

1407
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:17,186
So it's a failure,
but it's an honest failure.

1408
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:24,060
The criticism of
"Franklin and Jefferson"

1409
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,896
hit Charles hard.

1410
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:28,869
DEMETRlOS: The
"Franklin and Jefferson" show

1411
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:30,837
was an exhausting show

1412
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,669
because it was huge,

1413
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:36,575
and I think sort of
the machinery of doing that

1414
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:38,840
was just tiring.

1415
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:39,982
TONDREAU: I saw Charles
at his happiest

1416
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:42,644
TONDREAU: I saw Charles
at his happiest

1417
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:45,209
when he was getting to do
a lot of photography.

1418
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:49,087
And he was very engaged directly
on the creative process

1419
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,591
of doing the photographs --

1420
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:53,856
which led me to the idea
that maybe he felt

1421
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:56,591
he was missing something,
you know,

1422
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:58,292
because he had had
the transition

1423
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:01,234
to more of an executive
position at the Office.

1424
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:04,966
BEEBE: It was very hard for him,
because he didn't really have

1425
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,167
a successor,

1426
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:11,008
and for the years
that I was there, he was always

1427
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,274
Iooking for the perfect person.

1428
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,509
It was a battle one day

1429
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:19,680
with the lBM representative,
Mike Sullivan,

1430
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:22,656
and Mike said,
"Why don't you shutthis down?'

1431
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,021
And he said, "I'd like to."

1432
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:25,821
And Sullivan said,
"Whatwould you do?'

1433
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:30,524
And he said, "I'd just travel
and shoot."

1434
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:34,160
"But," he said, "l don't know
what to do about Ray,

1435
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,830
and closing the Office."

1436
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:39,874
BEEBE: He was tired, and he was,

1437
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:42,376
I don't know if it was his
heart, but he was cold a lot.

1438
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:45,106
I brought him one morning --
it was a Saturday morning,

1439
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,977
and I'd made applesauce cake
or something,

1440
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,539
and I brought it to the office,

1441
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:51,279
and I handed it to Charles
wrapped in tin foil,

1442
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:53,844
and itwas still warm,
and he took it,

1443
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,412
pressed it to his chest,

1444
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,288
and he was thrilled
to have that warmth

1445
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:00,021
just sort of on his chest.

1446
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:20,343
JOHN NEUHART: I was out of
the office the day that he died.

1447
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:25,148
It was, in a way,
it was expected.

1448
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:31,188
SUSSMAN: It just didn't
seem possible.

1449
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,024
I mean, I knew that some people
that Charles worked with,

1450
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:36,690
men in the East, wept.

1451
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:47,368
He was such a dominant force in
the lives of designers that...

1452
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:53,843
it was like there was suddenly
a big empty hole.

1453
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:00,378
OPPEWALL: There are still days

1454
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:02,889
when I'm driving
down the highway,

1455
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,223
thinking about things,
and I think,

1456
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:08,786
"Why did you die?

1457
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:11,958
I'm notthrough with you yet!

1458
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:16,664
I haven't finished asking you
the questions I wanted to ask."

1459
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:27,646
He was the most important person
in my life.

1460
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:33,448
I mean, he could be, he could
really be tough, you know,

1461
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:35,990
but he...

1462
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,962
he was an extraordinary
person.

1463
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,263
BEEBE: After Charles died,

1464
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:53,968
suddenly Ray was

1465
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,805
the head of the Office.

1466
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,348
She gathered everybody around,

1467
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:04,044
and she talked about her goals
and what she wanted to do,

1468
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:07,555
and how she needed
our help.

1469
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:10,615
And it was really very powerful,

1470
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,489
because she had never
donethat before.

1471
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:17,021
But she feltthis huge burden
about carrying on the name

1472
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:18,862
and carrying on the Office.

1473
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:22,893
And I think itwas killing her.

1474
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,235
And I said, "Come on, Ray,
why don't you

1475
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,333
just close the Office,
and let's go and paint."

1476
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,810
And she said
"No, that's all in the past.

1477
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:32,744
I can't do that anymore."

1478
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,717
FRANCO: Without Charles,

1479
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:41,119
activity in the Eames Office
dwindled,

1480
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:44,556
until it was time
to finally close 901.

1481
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,559
Ray focused
on the painstaking work

1482
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:52,623
of cataloguing the voluminous
40-year output

1483
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:55,795
of the Eames Office.

1484
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:59,432
Nearly 350,000 photographs

1485
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,999
and half a million documents
had to be organized for shipment

1486
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:05,376
to the Library of Congress.

1487
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,817
But over the years,
a new generation

1488
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:14,549
Iifted Ray
from Charles's shadow,

1489
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:17,683
discovering in her
exuberant design sense

1490
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:21,490
a refreshing alternative
to the austerity of modernism.

1491
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:26,529
And Ray seemed to finally
find her voice

1492
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:31,732
as one of the most influential
women of American design.

1493
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:34,571
Best for the most for the least,

1494
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,634
that was always the principle.

1495
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,646
That's why we became interested

1496
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:39,976
in mass production.

1497
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:43,950
SUSSMAN: At that point,

1498
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,954
women began to point to Ray.

1499
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:48,512
You know, "lf there are
two Eameses,

1500
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,057
why aren't they both credited?'

1501
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,422
And now, of course, they are.

1502
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:15,516
BEEBE: She kept saying, in
the hospital, "What day is it?'

1503
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:19,543
And I would say,
"It's Wednesday the 18th."

1504
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,646
And she would say, "Oh."

1505
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:23,156
And then the next time
I would come,

1506
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:25,557
then she would say,
"What day is it?'

1507
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:26,719
"It's Thursday."

1508
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:28,126
"Oh."

1509
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:36,969
I think she wanted to die
on the same day as Charles

1510
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:41,407
because it sort of symbolized
their being one.

1511
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:52,409
Her last statement was one
of being with Charles.

1512
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:14,403
This guy and that guy
could trade places.

1513
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:17,070
There's probably an Eames chair

1514
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:19,773
Iiterally in every single issue
thatwe've published.

1515
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:20,872
You know, you could go

1516
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:22,780
from the DAX to the DSS
to the LCW,

1517
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,682
you know, you'll get
thiswhole range.

1518
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,550
MAN:
Clockwise just a little.

1519
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:27,610
Just a little.

1520
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:31,318
Thefurniture still has
a quality

1521
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:32,655
that every young designer

1522
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:34,661
is searching for,
because of the amount of thought

1523
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:36,424
that's been put into it

1524
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:40,628
by everyone whose hands touch
the project.

1525
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:43,762
I think you see that optimism
of the American spirit

1526
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,069
in their design.

1527
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:47,870
It provided
just a great blueprint

1528
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:49,638
for how we could live our lives.

1529
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,810
PEATROSS: What furniture
designers

1530
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:56,817
ever have produced
40 to 50 pieces of furniture

1531
01:20:56,885 --> 01:21:00,321
that have been in production
for five decades?

1532
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:03,687
Butthe other thing is
the sheer joy,

1533
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,623
that aspect of play.

1534
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:09,289
No one else, I think,
had that combination

1535
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:12,299
of the pragmatic
and the aesthetic.

1536
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,528
NARRATOR: Seven...

1537
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:17,572
SUSSMAN: They loved to say,
"We don't do art.

1538
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:19,664
We solve problems."

1539
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:20,799
It's the process.

1540
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,537
It's, how do we get
from where we are

1541
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:25,273
to where we want to be?

1542
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:26,905
NARRATOR: Grasp the rear
of the viewfinder...

1543
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:29,507
DEMETRlOS: Charles and Ray were
always looking to the future.

1544
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:31,074
They weren't
sort of sitting around,

1545
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:33,052
telling war stories about
organic furniture.

1546
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:34,349
What they were doing is like,

1547
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:36,583
"What's the nextthing?'

1548
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:39,627
ALBRECHT: They were there

1549
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:41,719
for the major moments
in American history,

1550
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:44,196
and they were really the
pioneers of the information age.

1551
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:47,064
NARRATOR: The visitor
can try out the computer

1552
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:48,796
as a carrier of information.

1553
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:51,498
ALBRECHT: The breadth
of the work is extraordinary,

1554
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:55,475
but there is also a unifying
theme of beauty

1555
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:58,774
and a desire to reach
a broad audience.

1556
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:01,577
So if it was pulled forward
a little bit?

1557
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:04,175
Every designer owes them
some amount of debt,

1558
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:08,188
but at the same time, part of
that debt should be to kind of

1559
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:12,556
take what they did
and move beyond it.
