1
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,303
Nice fat deposit. You're sure
in the right business, Sally.

2
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,182
Thank you. Well, good morning.

3
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,060
Deposit.

4
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,237
Another nice deposit.

5
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,610
You and Sally are in
the right business.

6
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:07,140
I'm in a hurry, please.

7
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,000
Hi, Kate.

8
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,291
Have you cleaned the
house across the way?

9
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,626
I haven't had time yet.

10
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,920
You should always do that one first.

11
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,012
Anne!

12
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,565
Come here.

13
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,402
Did you ever see that kid
out there before?

14
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,946
I think maybe he was
in the bar last night.

15
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,281
Send Joe in.

16
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,449
Joe.

17
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,874
Hello, Pretty Boy.

18
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,382
Call me, Kate?
- Yeah. Take a look out the window.

19
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,261
There's a kid who's been following me
all the way to the bank and back.

20
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,247
Come here, you young squirt, come here.

21
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,334
You want me?

22
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,212
What's the idea
of throwing that stone, huh?

23
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,048
Any law against throwing stones?

24
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,884
Oh, you're tough, huh? Come here!

25
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,474
What are you hanging around here for,
anyway? Huh?

26
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,436
- Would she talk to me?
- Kate?

27
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:27,274
What for? What do you want? Huh?

28
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,569
Just wanna talk to her.

29
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,989
- What do you want, you?
- Nothing.

30
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,493
You live around here?

31
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,247
- Huh? In Monterey?
- Salinas.

32
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,915
What's your name?

33
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,752
You're not talking, huh? Now, look...

34
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,004
why are you following Kate around?

35
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,839
What's the idea, squirt?

36
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,926
Any law against following
around the town...

37
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,887
madam, whatever you call her?

38
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,224
I don't know if there's any law
against it, but she don't like it.

39
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,518
She owns that house over there too,
don't she?

40
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,938
But don't you go hanging around there,
squirt. You're too young.

41
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,399
Now come on. Now beat it.

42
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,234
Well, is that her real name?

43
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,402
Huh?

44
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,240
- Kate. Is that her real name?
- Sure, as far as I know. Why?

45
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,285
Well, what's her last name?

46
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,830
Nobody's got any last name
around here, kid. Why?

47
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,707
Huh?

48
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,503
Well, you tell her I hate her.

49
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,030
I should have gone right on in there.

50
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,867
Should have gone right on in there
and talked to her.

51
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,517
Cal wasn't home all night.
Boy, is he gonna catch it from Dad.

52
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,228
- You know what girls in class call him?
- No, what?

53
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,938
- The Prowler.
- Ha-ha-ha.

54
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,024
- I'll tell him that.
- You better not, Aron.

55
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,484
- Promise me.
- Why not?

56
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,903
Please don't. I don't want you...

57
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,906
- Hi, Cal.
- Hi.

58
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,574
Hello, Cal.

59
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,118
Excuse me for talking.

60
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,579
We're going down to see the icehouse
that Dad's gonna buy.

61
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,289
- Do you wanna come?
- What icehouse?

62
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,666
The one he's buying
to freeze the vegetables with.

63
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,127
He's been talking about it
every night for the last week.

64
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,837
Dad gonna be there?

65
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,006
Why, sure, he's gonna buy it.

66
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,468
Well, I'll skip it.

67
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,429
You're gonna have
to see him sometime, Cal.

68
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,349
Come on.
Hey, Aron.

69
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:09,144
Yeah?
Why don't you ask me where I've been?

70
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,562
Would you tell me?

71
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,024
No.
- Then what's the use of my asking?

72
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,196
- Is Dad mad at me?
- Well, you were out all night.

73
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,490
He was worried.

74
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,742
Yeah, I bet.

75
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,579
Well, you gonna come or not?

76
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,709
Okay. I'll see you at supper.

77
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:37,005
He's coming.

78
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,515
You see, Will, I got the idea
from an article I read.

79
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,268
They dug up a mastodon
somewhere in Siberia.

80
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,855
Been in the ice for thousands of years
and the meat was still good.

81
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,106
Mastodon?

82
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,488
Well, what have you got
to say for yourself?

83
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,743
This is my son, Cal.

84
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,747
When you were his age,
I imagine you thought it only right...

85
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,459
to let your father know
before you stayed out all night.

86
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,254
Or at least to offer some kind
of apology when you did come home.

87
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,797
Well, times change.

88
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,802
Well, as I was saying,
a mastodon is a kind of elephant.

89
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,054
Hasn't lived on the
Earth for a long while.

90
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,308
- And the meat was still fresh?
- Sweet as a pork chop.

91
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,811
You're more excited about this
than you've been for a long time.

92
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,646
Now, I seem to be, don't I?

93
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,816
See, Will, I've been sort of
in a rut out there in the ranch.

94
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,636
Sixteen, 17 years,
I've kept out of things.

95
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:41,677
I know.

96
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,115
But now I feel that
if I could only do something...

97
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:50,329
some little thing for, before I die,
some little thing for progress, uh...

98
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,831
for people, maybe.
Call it anything you want.

99
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,210
I might make up for all the years
I've been lying fallow.

100
00:13:56,377 --> 00:14:00,255
So lately I've been reading up all I can
about refrigeration.

101
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,926
And I can't get it out of my head
that you can keep anything good...

102
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,679
as long as you can get it cold
enough. Like that mastodon there.

103
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,887
- Good afternoon, Abra.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Trask.

104
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,475
Hello, Mr. Hamilton.
Hello.

105
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,851
Hello, son.
Hi, Dad.

106
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,980
Now my son, uh, Aron, that is,
thinks I may have a good idea here.

107
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,149
Dad wrapped a head of lettuce
in wax paper...

108
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,485
and kept it in our icebox
for over three weeks...

109
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,738
and it still came out fresh and
good. Right? - Quite right, son.

110
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,094
Dad, is it all right
if we look around?

111
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,141
Course, Aron.
Belongs to us now.

112
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:34,081
Do you know where the biggest market
for vegetables is in the winter?

113
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,916
Where?
New York City.

114
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,876
And they can't raise them there.

115
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,462
But the railroad had promised me
those fruit cars.

116
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,841
Don't you have anything
to say to me, Cal?

117
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,386
Yeah.
It's about time. Well?

118
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:52,057
Well, I read in the
Monterey newspaper...

119
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,102
that if we get into this war...

120
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,938
there are gonna be
some fortunes made.

121
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:02,651
But you're gonna make them
in beans and corn, and stuff like that.

122
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,572
- You don't need all this ice.
- You're perfectly right.

123
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,284
Beans are up to 3 cents. You wanna
make a profit, you plant beans.

124
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,369
And they keep too, don't they?

125
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:16,415
But I'm not particularly interested
in making a profit, Cal.

126
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,255
Look here, Will.

127
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,300
I'm not an inventor nor a scientist...

128
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,552
but I know I have an idea here.

129
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,306
I come from a family of inventors.
People full of ideas like this one.

130
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,438
I'm the only one that
didn't have an idea

131
00:15:34,463 --> 00:15:36,334
and the only one that
ever made a dime.

132
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,562
You wanna make a profit,
you plant beans.

133
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,690
Put out that cigarette!
That place is full of sawdust!

134
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:49,531
- Come on, Adam, he's just thoughtless.
- Thoughtless? He's inconsiderate.

135
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,200
I don't know.
I'm at my rope's end with that boy.

136
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,161
I don't understand him. I never have.

137
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,039
Aron I've understood
since he was a child.

138
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,336
Help me up.

139
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,759
- He doesn't like anybody, does he?
- Who, Dad?

140
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,510
- No, Cal.
- Oh.

141
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,263
It's dark in here and spooky.

142
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,141
Why is he so alone all the time?

143
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,394
He wants to be.
- Nobody wants to be alone all the time.

144
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,564
Dad's made a wonderful buy,
hasn't he? We'll freeze vegetables.

145
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,816
It'll really give him something
to live for now.

146
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,704
What's the matter, Abra,
don't you like Cal?

147
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,412
Oh, I guess I don't
know him very well.

148
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:30,513
I love him.

149
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,076
Well, naturally, he's your brother.
He's scary.

150
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,828
- Scary?
- When he looks at you.

151
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,247
Sort of like an animal.

152
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,166
I don't know, he scares me.

153
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,586
- Aron, when are we gonna get married?
- Hm?

154
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,131
Oh, just as soon as I get through
with that darned school.

155
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,051
Oh, I wish it... I
wish it was right now.

156
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,846
- So do I.
- Do you?

157
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,607
Abra. Abra.

158
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,175
- When we get...
- I love you, Aron.

159
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,861
When we get married,
it's going to be perfect.

160
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,739
Everything about it is
going to be perfect.

161
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,017
You're gonna make
a wonderful mother, Abra.

162
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,937
- I hope so.
- You are.

163
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,398
A perfect one.

164
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,944
You don't remember your mother at all,
do you, Aron?

165
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,072
No, she died
right after Cal and I were born.

166
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,534
Must be hard never to have had a mother.

167
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,289
- What's that?
- Look, what's he doing up there?

168
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,083
- Ha-ha-ha. Crazy guy.
- He's watching us.

169
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,169
No, he isn't.
Yes, he is too.

170
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,007
Let's move over here. Aron. Aron!

171
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,811
- He's not watching us.
- I feel as if he can still see us.

172
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,274
Oh, Abra. Abra.

173
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,152
I love you, Aron.

174
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,322
Really, I do. Really.

175
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,909
Sure. I love you too.

176
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,639
Cal, stop! Stop that, Cal!

177
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,641
What are you doing? Stop it!

178
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,480
"Blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven...

179
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,190
whose sin is covered.

180
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:15,028
Blessed is the man unto whom
the Lord imputeth not iniquity...

181
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,074
and in whose spirit
there is no guile."

182
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,869
And you are forgiven, Cal.

183
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,958
I think there is no iniquity
in your actions...

184
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,377
only something I do not know.

185
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,840
Why did you push that ice down?

186
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,011
I don't know.

187
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,389
Was it?

188
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:46,393
Was it vengeance? Anger?

189
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,939
Fear that I would punish you
for not coming home last night?

190
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:52,816
What was it?

191
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,529
I wanted to see it
slide down the chute.

192
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,312
Perhaps you had better
read from here on.

193
00:20:01,337 --> 00:20:02,516
I'll read it, Dad.

194
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,870
No, it's for Cal to read.

195
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,163
Start at the fifth verse.

196
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,749
Verse 5.

197
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,021
"I acknowledge my sin unto thee,
and mine iniquity have I not hid.

198
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,857
I said, I will confess my transgressions
unto the Lord...

199
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,484
and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin. Selah."

200
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,153
Go on.

201
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,284
Six.

202
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,578
And I suggest a little slower, Cal.

203
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,247
And you don't have to read
the verse numbers.

204
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:53,585
"For this shall every one that is godly
pray unto thee.

205
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,754
And surely in the floods
of great waters...

206
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:59,090
they shall not come nigh unto him.
Selah."

207
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,801
- Seven.
- Not the numbers, Cal.

208
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,889
"Thou art my hiding place,
thou shalt preserve me from trouble...

209
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:09,893
thou shalt compass me about
with songs of deliverance. Selah."

210
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,648
- Eight.
- You have no repentance! You're bad!

211
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,232
Through and through, bad.

212
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,194
Excuse me. I'll go out
and wait for Abra.

213
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,665
You're right. I am bad.
I knew that for a long time.

214
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,709
I didn't mean that, Cal.
I spoke in anger.

215
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,003
Well, it's true.

216
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,881
Aron's the good one.

217
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,008
I guess there's just a certain amount...

218
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,094
of good and bad you get
from your parents...

219
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,596
and I just got the bad.
- That's not true.

220
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,181
Cal, listen to me.

221
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,850
You can make of yourself
anything you want.

222
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,269
It's up to you. A man has a choice.

223
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,981
That's where he's
different from an animal.

224
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,027
You don't listen. You'll never remember.

225
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:08,910
My mother...

226
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,709
she's not dead and gone to heaven...

227
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:17,794
is she?

228
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,339
Why do you ask that?

229
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,717
She's not dead at all.

230
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,679
She's not buried in the east
like you said either.

231
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,472
She's alive.

232
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,891
- What makes you think so?
- I heard from a guy.

233
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,518
- Who?
- I don't know his name.

234
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,270
He was just passing through.

235
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,858
How come you told Aron and me she died?

236
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,569
- I thought it would save you pain.
- Pain?

237
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:52,037
If she... If she was still alive,
where do you think she'd be?

238
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,206
I have no idea. She went east.

239
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,791
How do you know?

240
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,588
When she left the ranch we lived on
when you and Aron were born...

241
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,090
I heard she went east.

242
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,218
What was she like? Was she bad?

243
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,138
I guess she...

244
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:14,601
I never really knew what she was like.
She wasn't like other people.

245
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,103
There was something she seemed to lack.

246
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,982
Kindness, maybe. Conscience.

247
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,195
I never knew what she was after.

248
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,406
- How come she left you?
- I never knew that either.

249
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,077
She was so full of hate.

250
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,121
- Hate for you?
- For everything.

251
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,961
You won't tell Aron that she didn't die?

252
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:43,713
No.

253
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,257
Must not do anything to hurt Aron.

254
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,015
Where'd you get that scar
you got on your shoulder, Father?

255
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,892
I've told you, Cal.

256
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,938
It's an old wound I got
in the Indian campaigns.

257
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,109
- Why do you ask that now?
- What'd she look like? Was she pretty?

258
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,780
She had the most lovely hands.

259
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,323
Like ivory.

260
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,618
She took such good care of them.

261
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,329
Her mother had arthritis.

262
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,707
She was always afraid
it would come to her in her hands.

263
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,674
Talk to me, Father.

264
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,306
I gotta know who I am.
I gotta know who I'm like.

265
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,766
I gotta know...

266
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,602
Where is she?

267
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,022
I'm telling you, truthfully, Cal...

268
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:46,151
after she left, I
never heard from her.

269
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,796
Cal, wait. I want to talk more with you.

270
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,428
If you leave this room now,
we may never be able to talk again.

271
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,828
You coming home tonight, Cal?

272
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,039
What's the difference?
You're home. You're the one he wants.

273
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,750
Good evening, Cal.

274
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,254
High-strung. Very high-strung.

275
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,549
Good evening, Abra.
Where is my chess victim?

276
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,885
He's waiting for you.
Ah, good.

277
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,304
What do you suppose he meant by that?

278
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,278
Go on, beat it!

279
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,282
Your wife has called up three times.

280
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,369
My wife's a...
I know she is. Now beat it.

281
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,672
Joe!

282
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,180
All right, fella, you've
run out of money.

283
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,182
Mr. Hawks.

284
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,605
What do you want?
- I want, uh...

285
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:09,275
- What do you want to drink?
- Beer.

286
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,205
Hey!

287
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,667
Where's my drink?
All right.

288
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:28,253
That's not very neat, is...

289
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,171
It's okay.

290
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,634
- You'd better get out of here.
- How come?

291
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,928
You're the one who followed Kate
this morning.

292
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,514
- It's a free country, isn't it?
- It's a free country.

293
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:42,600
Only Joe said if I saw you again,
I was supposed to tell him.

294
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,769
You can tell him if you want to.

295
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,481
You're just a kid, ain't you?

296
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,193
- I'm older than you are.
- Sure, but that isn't...

297
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,903
Hey!
All right.

298
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,614
Kid, please...

299
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,982
you oughtn't to go around
throwing stones and things.

300
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,744
That isn't nice. And drinking beer.

301
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,331
There's Joe.

302
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:09,669
Look, kid, please go.
You don't wanna get yourself hurt.

303
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,798
You could tell him now, if you want to.
There's your chance.

304
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,760
You sure have got a nerve, haven't you?

305
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,271
- Hey. Do you know Kate?
- This is Kate's place.

306
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,482
- She's treating you okay?
- Sure.

307
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,318
I gotta go now, kid.

308
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,819
Is she nice?

309
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,654
Don't let Joe see you, please.

310
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,073
She doesn't treat you rough
or anything, does she?

311
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:42,076
Please, kid, I gotta go now.
It was nice meeting you.

312
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,829
Isn't there anything
nice about her at all?

313
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,540
What's the matter, kid?

314
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,876
She had pretty hands. Did you see them?

315
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,211
- Hands?
- Did you look at them?

316
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,590
No, I don't think I ever saw them.
She always wears gloves.

317
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,220
Where is she?

318
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,181
- You mean now?
- Yeah.

319
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,225
- Back in her office, probably.
- Where's that?

320
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,019
Back that way.

321
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,479
Will you show me?

322
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,777
Look, kid, please don't
start any trouble.

323
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,613
I'm not gonna start any trouble.
Come on.

324
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,616
We... You can just point the door to me,
and I'll go there.

325
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:22,867
No, honest.

326
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,912
This is a tough place.
I can't lose this job.

327
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,240
- I'm not very good at it, anyway.
- You won't lose it.

328
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,583
If I step out of line,
Kate will throw me out on my ear.

329
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:34,921
Come on. Come on, will you?

330
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,131
You can just show me where the door is.

331
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,258
Come on.

332
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,595
Be a sport.

333
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,225
Come on.

334
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,324
There's the door.

335
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,743
Thank you. You can go back now.

336
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,329
What are you gonna do?

337
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,373
Please, kid, don't make any trouble.

338
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:11,874
Shh!

339
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:17,839
I'm not gonna make any trouble.
I'm gonna wait till you're gone. Okay?

340
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:13,728
Will you let me talk to you? Please.

341
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,523
I gotta talk to you.

342
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:24,989
Joe? Joe!

343
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:29,368
Get out of here! Joe! Tex!

344
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,707
Call the sheriff! Get him out!

345
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,878
Call the sheriff! Get him out of here!

346
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,297
Get him out of here!

347
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,716
I wanna talk to her!

348
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,977
I wanna talk to you!
I wanna talk to you!

349
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,023
I wanna talk to you! Talk to me!

350
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,735
Talk to me, please! Mother!

351
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:07,698
Is there any law against a guy
trying to see his own mother?

352
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,076
No, I guess there isn't.

353
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,036
Here.

354
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,248
Put this on your cheek. Here.

355
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,296
Drink some coffee.

356
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,967
How'd you find out about Kate, anyway?

357
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,970
That guy I saw you talking to
in the bar the other night?

358
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,722
The one they call Rabbit?

359
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:35,518
I thought so. He never was any good.

360
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,688
I remember when he used
to work on your father's ranch.

361
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,734
Well, he won't be around anymore, Cal.
He's left town for good.

362
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,657
- What do you hang around bars for?
- Any law against hanging...

363
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,118
Yes, there is. I'm the law.

364
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,245
Get that through your head.

365
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,123
Shut up!

366
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,549
Does Adam know that you...

367
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,759
roam around over here at night?

368
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:16,142
Adam's an old friend of mine,
you know, Cal, from...

369
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,603
way back in his ranch days.

370
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,898
I was afraid when you moved here
last year...

371
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,485
that you might find out something
about Kate.

372
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,364
But then she was over here on the bay...

373
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,332
and you were way over on the other
side of the mountains in Salinas.

374
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,910
So I figured it'd be all right.

375
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,913
You think he'll ever
find out about her?

376
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:40,625
He'd never come over here.

377
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,673
Here. You might as
well look at this now.

378
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:51,636
It's a picture of your father
and your mother on their wedding day.

379
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,139
You're the first person
I've ever showed it to.

380
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:01,937
I knew it.

381
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,858
Oh, I knew it was true.

382
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,863
When that old guy told me in the bar,
I knew it.

383
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,910
How did you know it was true?

384
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:19,246
Because she ain't no good
and I ain't no good.

385
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,041
I knew there was a reason why I wasn't.

386
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,217
I hate her.

387
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,803
And I hate him too.

388
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,223
Come on, I'll take you home.

389
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,934
You don't have to drive me home.

390
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,436
I know I don't have to take you home!

391
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:44,814
Here.

392
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,401
A little bit of the hair
of the dog that bit you.

393
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,152
Come on now.

394
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,584
How did Dad meet her?

395
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,629
Where'd she come from?

396
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,091
Nobody ever knew
where she come from, really.

397
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:16,220
There were a lot of
drifters in those days.

398
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:21,684
Of all the people...

399
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,311
How come he married her?

400
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,606
You have no idea how
pretty she was, Cal.

401
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,984
Young and full of spirit.

402
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,778
And your father hadn't been
off the ranch much, you know.

403
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,905
He's not a worldly man.

404
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:48,335
- Did she shoot him?
- Yes, she did.

405
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,505
How come?

406
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,341
I don't know.

407
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,971
Did he do something to her?

408
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,307
- Did he hurt her?
- No.

409
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,809
It wasn't in him to hurt her.

410
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:08,647
After she left him, he died.
He walked around, but he died.

411
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,779
He must have done something to hurt her.

412
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,198
No. No, sir.

413
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,659
He gave her everything
that any woman could ask for.

414
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,373
You see, your father
has more kindness...

415
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,795
and more conscience
than any man that I've ever known.

416
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,643
He's a good man, Cal.
Don't sell him short, boy.

417
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,671
It's going to work...

418
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,882
if only I can keep them
cold enough long enough.

419
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,144
It's going to work.

420
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:48,497
All right, there she is. Let's try it.
Step back, girls.

421
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,008
All right, bring her on. Come on.

422
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:06,140
Now do you think it'll work? Ha-ha-ha.
It sure will!

423
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,078
Good morning, Mr. Trask.
Good morning.

424
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,250
Somebody swiped our coal chute
right off the wagon.

425
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,628
Dear, dear.
Times are getting pretty lawless.

426
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,004
It's this war in Europe.

427
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:40,674
There's a wave of lawlessness
spreading through the country.

428
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,718
Anyway, somebody swiped our chute.

429
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,470
Is that where you're loading?
- Yeah.

430
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:46,347
We'll move on, then. Good day, Mr.
Trask.

431
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,973
It's this war in Europe.

432
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,274
Cal!

433
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,115
- Do you know where Aron is?
- Uh...

434
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,242
He's out in the fields. He's checking.

435
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,661
Can I do something for you?

436
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,956
No. There were just some matters
I want to talk over with him.

437
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,791
What have you got there?

438
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:17,711
Oh, well, I figured it would
save some time. So I...

439
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,966
It's very ingenious, Cal. Very
ingenious. Did you think of it?

440
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,676
Yep.

441
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,220
I'm very pleased
with the way you're taking hold...

442
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:27,972
and are working so well, Cal.

443
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,848
Thanks. Thanks, Dad.

444
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:38,315
Think you better
have your lunch now. It's time.

445
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,860
Hi, Cal.

446
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,824
- Aron's out in the field.
- I brought his lunch.

447
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,786
- Well... Okay, I'll take it to him.
- Cal.

448
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,967
Lydia, vamoose.

449
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,232
He'll be here in a minute.

450
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,028
I've been fixing Aron's lunch. I'll
fix yours too if you like after this.

451
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,738
No, thanks.

452
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,992
Would you be eating with her
if I weren't here?

453
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Who?

454
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,207
No, I didn't ask her to come up here.

455
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,255
Girls follow you around, don't they?

456
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:46,383
- Does she bother you?
- She doesn't bother me.

457
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,427
Who is she?

458
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,457
I never saw her before in my life.

459
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,185
I'll bet.

460
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:02,232
You're really working at this
lettuce business, aren't you, Cal?

461
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,504
Do you think it'll turn out all right?

462
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,321
Your father will lose quite a
lot of money if it doesn't.

463
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:09,114
Just about all he's got.

464
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,825
I like your father.

465
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,078
Do you?

466
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,543
I threw away about $3,000 once.

467
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,170
Yeah?

468
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,799
- When I was 13.
- You threw it away?

469
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,675
It was a diamond ring worth about that.

470
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,345
At least my father told me
that's what he paid for it.

471
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:34,890
I threw it in the river.
Made Dad terribly angry.

472
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,936
I reckon it would.

473
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,730
But I forgave him.
And it's been all right ever since.

474
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,398
- You forgave him?
- Yes.

475
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:49,863
You forgave him because you threw a ring
of his worth $3,000 into the river?

476
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,740
- That's right.
- You forgave him?

477
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,283
That's right. Ha-ha-ha.

478
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,536
Is there an egg in this basket?

479
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,791
You see, I thought he didn't love me.
That made me feel awful.

480
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,628
Girls love their fathers terribly.

481
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,505
Do they?

482
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,466
My mother died when I was 13...

483
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,761
and Dad got married again soon
after that. Did you know that?

484
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,847
No, I didn't know that.

485
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,328
Are you interested
in hearing about me?

486
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:19,376
Yeah.

487
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:26,608
When Dad got married again,
it made me sick.

488
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,361
I just hated everybody.

489
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,239
I used to sit and just
glare at people...

490
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,159
or I wouldn't even answer
when they spoke to me.

491
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:40,330
- Why you telling me all this?
- I want to.

492
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:44,376
I was that way for months.
I just hated everybody.

493
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,837
And I thought nobody
in the world loved me.

494
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:51,049
And it was awful.

495
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,221
Then I found this ring
that Dad gave my new mother...

496
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,350
so I took it and threw
it in the river. - Good.

497
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,770
I thought you'd like that.

498
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,982
- Did he ever find it?
- Never.

499
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,652
They tried.

500
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,238
What'd they do to you?

501
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,158
Dad punished me. Not badly, I guess.

502
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,869
But I felt he shouldn't have
punished me at all.

503
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:22,497
I felt he should have loved me more
because I did it.

504
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,041
But he didn't.

505
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,127
Isn't it funny?

506
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,963
I'm grown up now...

507
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,633
but I still understand kids
better than I do grownups.

508
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,884
You're not so grown-up.

509
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,053
- I'm very grown-up.
- That's a matter of opinion.

510
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,804
I'm very grown-up.

511
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,433
More so than Dad, because I forgave him
for not understanding.

512
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,647
And the minute I forgave
him in my mind...

513
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:48,941
I felt better.

514
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,200
Now we get along fine.

515
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:03,247
We love each other.
Not like we did when I was 13...

516
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,375
but enough so we can live together
till I get married.

517
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,632
He's just my father now.
Nothing to rave about.

518
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,636
I still don't like her much,
but then, she's a woman.

519
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,610
Why, that girl just
hates me, doesn't she?

520
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,863
You better tell her I'm
your brother's girl.

521
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,700
I don't have to explain anything
to anybody.

522
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:45,038
I'll go now and leave the field to her.

523
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,211
My, your hair's in a mess.

524
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,717
Hey, Dad, what's that?

525
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,137
That's something Cal rigged up.
It's a good idea.

526
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,306
Aron! I brought your lunch.

527
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,100
Looks like a coal chute.

528
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,644
Coal chute?

529
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,859
Okay, woman, where's the beans?
Cal!

530
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,324
What makes you think you have the right
to come and take something like this?

531
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,785
You probably lost those men their jobs.
Now, you take it back.

532
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:34,629
He's praising Cal and
Cal is lapping it up.

533
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,341
Aron! Look, have one of those
made of wood.

534
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,593
- It'll save a lot of time.
- Yes, sir!

535
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,349
Good waste of time and money.
- And lettuce.

536
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,602
What'd you say?
I said, it's a good idea if it works.

537
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,146
It's gonna work because it's gotta work.

538
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,398
It's gotta work because I said so.

539
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,444
Well, if it don't work, it
ain't that kid's fault.

540
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,905
I never saw anybody work
so hard in my life.

541
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,911
Let's go, Pete. Now, Leonard!

542
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,291
Good luck, Adam.

543
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,786
Do you know the principle
of the internal combustion engine?

544
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:50,414
No, I'm afraid not.
Will, I'll never be able to...

545
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,582
Oh, sure you will. You
just listen to Roy.

546
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,918
He's been to the automobile school
in Chicago.

547
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,921
Mr. Trask has just revolutionized
the entire vegetable market.

548
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,715
- Wait till those cars get to New York.
- Don't you worry.

549
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,884
It's about time he owned
his own automobile...

550
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,719
and about time he
learned to drive it.

551
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,347
- Now don't you think so, Roy?
- I'll do my best.

552
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,099
Well, now pay strict attention, boys.

553
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,560
Don't touch that!

554
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,270
Wait till it's explained to you.

555
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,897
No, now for heaven's sake,
don't touch anything, anybody.

556
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:20,235
Now, the power of the explosion
is exerted on a piston...

557
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:23,947
and through connecting rod
and crankshaft...

558
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:27,868
through transmission,
thence to rear wheels.

559
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,662
- Got that so far?
- Sure, he's got that.

560
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,832
Now, we go on
to the operation of the automobile.

561
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,877
This here's the ignition key.

562
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,505
Would you mind putting out
that cigarette, please?

563
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,842
Turn this doohickey here to the left.
That puts her on battery.

564
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,969
- See where it says "bat"?
- Oh, yes, yes.

565
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:49,556
- Bat, short for battery.
- That's right. Good boy.

566
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,475
Thank you. Thank you very much.

567
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,101
First you gotta retard the spark.

568
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:56,521
If you don't retard the spark, she'll
probably kick your blasted arm off.

569
00:46:56,689 --> 00:47:00,275
- Oh, now remember that.
- Now, this here is the spark.

570
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,403
You push her way up. Listen.

571
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:08,158
- This here's the gas. You push her...
- Down.

572
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,245
- You had lessons before.
- No, no, I just saw you do it.

573
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:15,916
- Oh. You're a smart old buzzard.
- Thank you very much.

574
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,543
- Keep your eyes open, don't you?
- Try to.

575
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,921
Now, this here is the crank.

576
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,216
See this wire sticking out of
the radiator? That's the choke.

577
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,135
Now watch careful.
Grab hold of the crank like this.

578
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,678
Push in till she catches.

579
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,180
See how my thumb is turned down?

580
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,890
I noticed that. Why do you do that?

581
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,809
If you put her around this way
with my thumb around her...

582
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,895
she'd probably knock
my blasted thumb off.

583
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:39,068
Oh, dear, dear. First
you lose your blasted

584
00:47:39,093 --> 00:47:41,006
arm and then you lose
your blasted thumb.

585
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,817
- That's wrong way around.
- How's that?

586
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,571
He made a joke.
I never did see him so happy.

587
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,116
You pull out this choke,
turn her around to suck gas in.

588
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,786
Then you give her a hard spin.

589
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:56,414
- She caught, first time!
- Oh! Caught on what?

590
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,042
Advance the spark and retard the gas.

591
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,795
Reach over real quick and switch
to mag. That's magneto.

592
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,755
So there you are.

593
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,383
Indeed. Now, isn't that wonderful?

594
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:09,010
Of course, it isn't exactly
going anywhere, is it?

595
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,178
That's the easy part.

596
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,097
- Adam.
- I want you all to repeat after me.

597
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:14,766
Spark up, gas down.
Spark up, gas down.

598
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,226
Switch to bat.
Switch to bat.

599
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,194
- Crank to compression, thumb down.
- Crank to compression, thumb down.

600
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:21,106
- You got that? Let's have it again.
- Uh-huh.

601
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:23,275
Spark up, gas down.
Spark up, gas down.

602
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,569
- What's the matter?
- Big snow slide.

603
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,613
Closed the pass and stopped the cars
about 100 miles out.

604
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,449
Can see water running out of the cars.

605
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,382
Well, it's still a good idea.
Cold can preserve things.

606
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,094
- Someday somebody'll prove it.
- Dad.

607
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,597
- It was your idea.
- No.

608
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,558
It was presumptuous of me
to think it would be I.

609
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,479
Guess we bit off more lettuce
than we could chew.

610
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:06,735
What do you know about that?
I thought he'd really be hurt.

611
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,904
Aw, you don't understand him.

612
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,994
You can't go in there.
I gotta see Will Hamilton.

613
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,286
He won't be through for an hour.
They just started.

614
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,455
- Let me see him.
- There's a war in Europe.

615
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:21,541
These boys are trying
to get themselves in shape. So beat it.

616
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:25,086
Right, left. Right, left.

617
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:33,421
Right, left. Right, left.

618
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,559
Now, deep knee bends, follow me.

619
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:53,948
- What's that?
- That's the fire bell.

620
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,742
We better have a look.

621
00:49:57,912 --> 00:50:01,206
- It may be the Germans.
- Fire, Germans, who cares? I surrender.

622
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,793
Howdy, Mr. Albrecht.
Hello, Cal.

623
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,753
- Mr. Hamilton.
- There's a fire somewhere.

624
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,361
- No. I rang the bell.
- You rang it?

625
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:09,506
Yeah. I had to see you.

626
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,508
You know, you're crazy.
You're really crazy.

627
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,927
I knew it when you pushed that ice
down the chute.

628
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,930
Let's get out of here
before they start up that pianist again.

629
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:20,308
There must be some easier way
to stop the Germans than this, anyway.

630
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,686
- I gotta make some money.
- Sure, everybody's got to.

631
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,688
No, I gotta.

632
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:28,566
Remember, you said that
if you wanna make money...

633
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:29,943
you ought to raise beans?

634
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,237
Yeah, beans are up 3.5 cents now.

635
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:34,614
Now, the way I figure
it, it's like you said.

636
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,866
The country's gonna get
into war, isn't it?

637
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,827
I don't see any way out.

638
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,414
- War's good for business.
- The best there is.

639
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:46,042
Well, see, that's why I
wanna go into beans.

640
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:50,088
See, I gotta get enough money
to give my father back what he lost.

641
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,882
Oh. I see.

642
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,636
You think you can make
all that money back, huh?

643
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,096
I gotta.

644
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,140
You know, you're crazy.

645
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,892
Look, Cal, don't you know...

646
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,812
that you gotta have money
in order to make money?

647
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,231
- I'll get some money.
- How?

648
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,608
- I'll get it.
- Heh, heh.

649
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:14,237
Look, don't get so near me.
I don't wanna get all hot again.

650
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,198
- How much money could you get?
- What do you think I need?

651
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,492
Well, if you had 5,000...

652
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,749
- Five thousand dollars?
- Mm.

653
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,961
It's a little different when you start
putting it into figures, isn't it?

654
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:32,464
Yeah.

655
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,382
I know you wanna help your father...

656
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:37,594
but a kid your age can't be expected
to put his hands on $5,000.

657
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:40,972
Maybe if you could raise 100 or so,
we could let you have a little share.

658
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,550
No, I don't want a little share,
I want the whole thing.

659
00:51:43,718 --> 00:51:44,755
I'll get the 5,000.

660
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,602
Maybe if you and Aron
went in together...

661
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:50,190
Aron ain't got nothing to do with this.
This is my deal. I'll get the 5,000.

662
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,108
What are you gonna do, borrow it?

663
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,571
Yeah.

664
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,491
All right. If you can borrow $5,000...

665
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,327
I know a farmer who's
got over 800 acres.

666
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:05,371
- It's under cultivation.
- All right. What do we do?

667
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,750
If we can guarantee him
5 cents a pound...

668
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:11,294
and make him a seed loan,
he'll plant beans.

669
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,837
So will a lot of other farmers.

670
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:15,840
Why, we can contract
all the bean acreage you want.

671
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:21,304
That's it. That's it. That's great.
When do we start?

672
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,682
How do you know the price
is gonna go above 5, though?

673
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,684
Did you read the newspapers
this morning?

674
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,020
We're apt to be in war any minute.

675
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:32,816
You know, I got a contract
with the British Purchasing Agency...

676
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,235
and I got a friend in
the Quartermaster Corps.

677
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,737
Do you know
that we could sell all the dry beans...

678
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,989
that we can find
at 10 cents a pound or more?

679
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,909
That's what I want. That's it. See?

680
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:46,412
- How much will I make?
- Oh, enough for what you want.

681
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,463
- What does Cal stand for?
- Caleb.

682
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,049
It's in the Bible.

683
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,346
- What's your brother's name?
- Aron.

684
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,224
Now, that's in the Bible too.

685
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,813
What's he like?

686
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,901
Oh, he looks like you.

687
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,696
Well, is he like me?

688
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,615
No. He's good.

689
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:09,454
I'm more like you.

690
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,667
How's Adam?

691
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:16,961
How's your father?

692
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,465
I don't wanna talk about him.

693
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,517
- Oh, you don't, huh?
- No.

694
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,570
I didn't know who you were
when you were here before.

695
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:44,989
I knew you didn't.

696
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,954
Aren't you afraid
to come around here again?

697
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,623
Yeah, I am. No. Well, kind of.

698
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,004
What do you want?

699
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,300
Just to look at me?

700
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,766
I want $5,000.

701
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,782
All right, come on in. Sit down.

702
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:29,659
Come in.

703
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,662
Try that chair.

704
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,375
You got your father's eyes.

705
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,712
That's all I can see of him.

706
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:45,049
- You're a nice-looking boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

707
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,889
- I was very beautiful once.
- Yes, ma'am.

708
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,935
- Caleb.
- Yes, ma'am?

709
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,271
- Caleb and Aron.
- Yeah.

710
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:01,190
Your father still thinks
he's living in the Bible, huh?

711
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,692
Them's just names.

712
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:05,820
Joe says that you go
to school in Salinas.

713
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,864
Are you good in your studies?

714
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,617
Oh, I get by with them.

715
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,703
Does Aron get by with them?

716
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:14,996
He's bright.

717
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,209
What are you gonna do when you finish?
You're going to college?

718
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:21,711
Maybe.

719
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:25,089
Or back to some ranch?

720
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:28,051
No, I don't like the ranch.

721
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,720
Well, you take after me.

722
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,932
Makes me mad just to
think about a ranch.

723
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:37,643
Sit down.

724
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,025
Thanks.

725
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:53,534
Now, what do you want with $5,000?

726
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:55,995
I wanna go into business.

727
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,955
You're a little young for that,
aren't you?

728
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,457
I'm old enough.

729
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,502
Well, yeah, I guess you're right.
I guess you are.

730
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,236
What kind of business
do you wanna go into?

731
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:06,321
Beans.

732
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:11,803
See, beans are up to 3.5 cents now.

733
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,347
And we get into war,
they're gonna go up to 10, 12.

734
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:16,915
- If we get into the war.
- That's a gamble you have to take.

735
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,435
- Now, Will Hamilton says that...
- Will?

736
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,854
You going into business
with Will Hamilton?

737
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,356
You see...

738
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:28,778
my father, he lost
about all he had in...

739
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:31,906
Yeah, I know. I heard about that.

740
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,661
I wanna make enough to pay him back.

741
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:40,748
What's the matter with him?
Can't he make any money?

742
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,416
Yeah.

743
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,628
Only...

744
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:50,508
Only he's too good to bother
with money, huh?

745
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:54,846
Okay.

746
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:02,520
What makes you think
I'd give you $5,000?

747
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:09,360
Well, I don't know who else to ask.

748
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,573
You got a lot of nerve coming to me.

749
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:16,576
Why? I didn't do anything to you.

750
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,622
Well...

751
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,625
It's a good business venture.

752
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,381
And I'll pay you back.
I'll give you interest.

753
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:33,134
You're a business woman, ain't you?

754
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:34,760
One of the best, son.

755
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:41,100
You know, Sam told me that
you think I ought to be run out of town.

756
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:48,274
You're afraid that your father and Aron
might find out about me, is that it?

757
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:54,447
This $5,000 now.

758
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:57,366
That wouldn't be
any kind of blackmail, would it?

759
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,660
- Oh, I never thought about that.
- Heh.

760
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,538
But now that you do,
it's a good idea, huh?

761
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,334
- Maybe.
- Well, it's not.

762
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:13,841
Anyway, I'm not gonna hurt
your precious father or your brother.

763
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,844
- Do they know anything about me?
- No.

764
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:19,347
Father thinks you're in the east...

765
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,266
and Aron thinks you're dead.

766
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:27,563
Well, then there's no reason to think
that they ever will find out about me.

767
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,858
We don't exactly move
in the same circles.

768
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,783
What are you staring at?

769
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:42,453
How come you did it?

770
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:44,455
Did what?

771
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,333
Shot my father.

772
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,585
Did he tell you that?

773
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:56,509
How come you ran away from all of us?
How come you shot him...

774
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:59,971
ran away and did all that stuff?
- None of your business.

775
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:04,016
I shot him because he tried to stop me.

776
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:06,852
I could have killed him if
I'd wanted to, but I didn't.

777
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,647
I just wanted him to let me go.

778
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:13,818
- Why?
- Because he tried to hold me.

779
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,779
He wanted to tie me down.

780
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:19,490
He wanted to keep me
on a stinking little ranch...

781
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,617
away from everybody.
Keep me all to himself.

782
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,161
Well, nobody holds me.

783
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,706
- But he loved you.
- Love.

784
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,376
He wanted to own me. He wanted to...

785
01:00:31,003 --> 01:00:33,587
bring me up like a snot-nosed kid...

786
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:37,425
and tell me what to do.
Well, nobody tells me what to do.

787
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:42,263
Always so right himself.
Knowing everything.

788
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,182
Reading the Bible at me.

789
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:48,352
- What are you grinning at?
- Nothing.

790
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:52,023
Maybe you know what I'm
talking about, huh?

791
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:55,359
- Ha, ha.
- Always so right himself?

792
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:56,902
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

793
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:02,408
Maybe like you said out there,
maybe you are more like me. Huh?

794
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,954
Yeah, you got sense.

795
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,708
Maybe you don't fall for that slop
any more than I do.

796
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:14,545
Maybe you know what people
are really like, what they want.

797
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:17,715
I got the toughest house on the coast...

798
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:22,094
and the finest clientele. Yeah.

799
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:24,889
Half the stinking city hall go there.

800
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,100
They sneak in at night...

801
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:31,145
and I walk in this front door
in the daytime, see.

802
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,981
And I built it up from nothing.

803
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,401
Now you want $5,000 of my money...

804
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:40,363
to go into business
to pay your father back what he lost.

805
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:41,781
You know, that's funny.

806
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:44,617
Oh, well, I don't think
he'll know where I got it.

807
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:48,287
No, but it's funny just the same.

808
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:50,581
Your father.

809
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:54,710
He's the purest man there is,
isn't he? Oh...

810
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:58,255
He thought he had me all tied up
with his purity.

811
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:02,176
And now I give you $5,000
of the money that I made...

812
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,053
to save him his purity.

813
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:08,849
If you don't think that's funny,
you'd better not go to college.

814
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:19,652
Okay.

815
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:26,075
You tell Will Hamilton
to come and see me.

816
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:30,454
He's a good businessman.

817
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:37,503
How'd he ever happen to let you go
into this bean business, anyway?

818
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,255
I don't know.

819
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,925
I do. Maybe he likes you.

820
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:45,136
Maybe.

821
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:50,099
You're... You're a likable kid.

822
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:59,358
Okay.

823
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,318
You give this to him.

824
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:05,698
If he wants to gamble
that we get into the war...

825
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:07,199
it's okay with me.

826
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,304
You're a likable kid.

827
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,063
Go on, go on, get out of here.

828
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:43,486
Go on, get out. I'm running a business.

829
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:28,113
- Them Germans can't fight.
- No.

830
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:56,934
Hi, partner.

831
01:04:57,102 --> 01:05:00,437
Boy, every day in every way,
we're getting richer and richer.

832
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:08,153
- Kaiser.
- All we have to do is call his bluff.

833
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,947
He'll come to heel like a dog.

834
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,164
We'll be over there and
clean up this mess

835
01:05:18,189 --> 01:05:20,148
for those foreigners
in a couple of weeks.

836
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,266
Cal, stop it.

837
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,394
There's Cal.

838
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:49,445
Hi, boy. Hey, want some?
Hello, Cal.

839
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,779
Thanks.

840
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:03,542
Your own Woodrow Wilson said you gotta
make the country safe for democracy.

841
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,588
- Didn't he say that?
- Yes, he said that. Will you go?

842
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:09,596
I think the war will be over.
I don't think...

843
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:13,010
If you believe in all this, why don't
you? If you really think it's right.

844
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:14,928
I didn't say it was right, Aron.

845
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,056
No, I guess you didn't.

846
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,310
Why don't you go back
and join the parade?

847
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:27,566
Oh!

848
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:31,945
Nothing'll ever make me go. Nothing.

849
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:35,491
I just don't believe it's right.

850
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,551
Did you water them good?
Oh, sure, lots of water.

851
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,887
Not too much, though.
Oh, no, just right.

852
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:18,075
Marty Hopps got a telegram today.
His boy was killed.

853
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:20,285
I remember the day we sent him off.

854
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:25,165
A lot of troops' ships have been sunk
they don't tell us about.

855
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:28,168
- It's gonna be a long war.
- Those Germans got an army.

856
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,003
They're a military nation.

857
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,423
Go back where you came from, German!

858
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,174
Go on home, German!

859
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:43,392
This is just the start.

860
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:45,728
That rock through the window
is just the beginning.

861
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,415
The German people don't want this war.

862
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,732
The stories they tell
of what the Germans are doing...

863
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,317
it simply is not true.
Not the good ones.

864
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,738
I've been wondering lately if we
shouldn't all go back to the ranch.

865
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,157
You can't get away from it there, Dad.

866
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:02,369
I don't know. Somehow, on a ranch...
I don't know.

867
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:05,998
War seems to be
city people's business somehow.

868
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:10,294
Farmers. What's a farmer got to do
with war?

869
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:11,462
Oh, Dad.

870
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,090
You tired, Dad?
No, son.

871
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:18,761
My eyes, I guess.
I work too hard at the draft board.

872
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:23,140
Better have my glasses looked at,
see if they're all right.

873
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:26,059
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Well, anyway...

874
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:29,021
I had a look at the bank account
the other day.

875
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,774
Not much left after my great fiasco.

876
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,318
Ah...

877
01:08:34,486 --> 01:08:39,448
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

878
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,953
Don't worry about money.

879
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,048
Hey, Rantani!

880
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,259
Ain't this some sight?

881
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:00,844
Beans!

882
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,597
Yeah, boy, some beans.

883
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:06,391
You come here every day, boy.
What do you think...

884
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,602
you gonna make them grow quicker?

885
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,363
He's crazy.

886
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:29,498
Hey, where have you been?

887
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:32,417
Come on. Come on. Come on.

888
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,503
We're gonna have lots of fun tonight.

889
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:49,142
- You won another cigar.
- Wait a minute.

890
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,105
You wanna try one? No?

891
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,150
Pick up my cigar.

892
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,692
- I'm waiting for somebody.
- You're waiting for me.

893
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:00,779
No, I'm not.

894
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,906
Why don't you let me
take you for a nice ride?

895
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:05,394
If you don't stop bothering me,
I'll have to call somebo...

896
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:07,286
- Hi. What's the matter?
- Hello, Cal.

897
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:11,248
Well, I was just trying to tell this
gentleman that I was waiting for somebody.

898
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:14,084
This is a lousy place
to keep your girlfriend waiting for you.

899
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,253
- Sir, it won't happen again.
- Yeah, I hope not.

900
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:19,214
Lots of lousy characters around here.
Sorry, miss.

901
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:21,508
Here I am, lady.

902
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:25,470
Ha-ha-ha. That's the first time
that ever happened to me.

903
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,265
- What are you doing out here?
- I'm meeting Aron.

904
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:31,310
I thought I'd come out early
and look around.

905
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,938
- You never been out here before?
- Not at night, no.

906
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,066
- What time are you gonna meet him?
- At 8.

907
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,978
Thought I'd try and cheer him up.
He's been so depressed lately.

908
01:10:41,146 --> 01:10:42,177
Yeah, I know it.

909
01:10:42,202 --> 01:10:44,347
I'm so glad you
happened to be here, Cal.

910
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,574
Yeah.

911
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,663
Eight, huh?

912
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,541
You got a half-hour?

913
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,673
How are you, Cal?
We never see you around anymore.

914
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:02,841
I'm around.

915
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:06,261
I've been over to the house several
times, but you were never there.

916
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:09,723
- I never go home anymore.
- Aron says he hardly ever sees you.

917
01:11:11,059 --> 01:11:12,976
I feel awfully sorry for him.

918
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:21,109
- You're terrible.
- Ha-ha-ha.

919
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,321
That's the first time that ever
happened to me too. Ha-ha-ha.

920
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:27,532
Wonder if we can see Aron from here.

921
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:31,328
I feel awfully sorry for him.
He's right, you know.

922
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:34,539
I mean, it's awful, the war
and people killing each other.

923
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,459
Why feel sorry for Aron?
Feel sorry for the people.

924
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,427
But it just seems to affect him
so personally.

925
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:42,255
Three shots for a dime.
Oh, well, I'll agree with that.

926
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:44,716
He's right.

927
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,803
He's always right.

928
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:49,972
And he has always been right.

929
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,807
Now let's talk about something else.

930
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:53,350
- All right.
- Okay?

931
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:55,769
Eight o'clock.

932
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,646
We got a lot to see.

933
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:00,983
- Will we be back in time for Aron?
- Yeah.

934
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:06,154
All right. I'd love to.

935
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:14,913
Easy.

936
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,807
Ooh...

937
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,437
Oop...

938
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:43,066
Here's your cigar,
and where have you been hiding?

939
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:47,821
Who was that?
Who?

940
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:50,032
- That girl.
- I don't see nobody.

941
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,952
She was standing right...
Girls follow you around, don't they?

942
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,914
- What are girls like that like?
- Huh?

943
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,332
Oh, all right, never mind.

944
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,335
Huns have been the aggressors
in every war in Europe...

945
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,920
since the time of Julius Caesar.

946
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:07,591
I couldn't attempt to describe to you
the horrors committed by the Germans.

947
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:08,842
Look.

948
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:10,385
Do we have time?

949
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:12,637
- After the Germans had been through...

950
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:15,182
the women of the town...
That German's here again.

951
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:18,602
It is not true. It is lies, all lies.

952
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:22,272
Come on, Cal. Is it scary?

953
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,984
Here we go.

954
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,330
It is lies, all lies.

955
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:40,999
I'd like to give that guy
a piece of my mind.

956
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,168
See over there. That's Castroville.

957
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:44,711
Everything looks so small.

958
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:46,880
Higher and higher
And higher and higher

959
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:48,048
What?

960
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:50,467
Growing and growing
And growing and growing

961
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:54,471
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you sometime.

962
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:01,019
Cal. Does Aron really love me?

963
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:05,107
- Um...
- I seem to have sort of lost him.

964
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:08,985
I mean, we're going
to be married someday, but...

965
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,655
Well, if he does love me, he doesn't...

966
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,157
I can't tell anymore.

967
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,912
Cal, can I ask you something?

968
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:21,123
Yeah, go ahead.

969
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:25,335
These girls that you always
go around with.

970
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:28,797
You know, remember there was
that little Mexican girl once.

971
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,882
What are girls like that like?

972
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:36,930
I mean, you don't really
love them, do you?

973
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:41,977
Well, then why do you go out with them?
Is it because you're bad?

974
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,147
You're not angry, are you?

975
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:50,314
Well, why do you, then?
Are you bad, Cal?

976
01:14:50,339 --> 01:14:51,677
Do you think I'm bad?

977
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:55,407
I don't know.

978
01:14:56,659 --> 01:15:00,036
I guess I don't know
what is good and what's bad.

979
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:02,455
I mean, Aron is so good...

980
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,583
and I'm not.

981
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,751
Not good enough for Aron, anyway.

982
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,254
Because sometimes when I'm with Aron...

983
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,215
Aron likes to talk about
our being in love...

984
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:15,010
and think about it
and that's all right, but...

985
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:19,306
These girls that you go out with, do...?

986
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:23,185
Maybe I don't know what love is exactly.

987
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:27,439
I know love is good the
way Aron says, but...

988
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,902
well, it's more than
that, it's got to be.

989
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:36,198
Oh, I shouldn't talk to you
this way, Cal, I shouldn't...

990
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,575
but I don't know who else to talk to.

991
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,536
And sometimes I think I'm really bad.

992
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:45,040
Sometimes I don't know what to think.

993
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:50,503
- Well, Aron'll knock that out of you.
- Will he?

994
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:52,672
He's got to.

995
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:55,884
The way I figure it out...

996
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,887
Aron never having had a mother...

997
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:03,099
well, he's made her everything good
that he can think of...

998
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:05,518
and that's what he thinks I am.

999
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:08,480
And that's who he's in love with.
It's not me at all.

1000
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:13,235
Because I'm not a bit like
that made-up one. Not a bit.

1001
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:16,488
I don't mean I think I'm really bad.

1002
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,076
Look at that star.

1003
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,871
It must be a planet, it's so bright.

1004
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:26,873
Probably.

1005
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:35,257
I bet that girl's waiting for you
down there somewhere.

1006
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,760
Well, she can just wait.

1007
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:40,762
She was pretty.

1008
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,644
You've been awfully nice, Cal,
taking care of me.

1009
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,875
I love Aron. I do, really I do.

1010
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:17,625
I do, I do. I do.

1011
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:24,689
- To give these fiends a lesson that...
- Have you seen Abra?

1012
01:17:24,857 --> 01:17:25,933
Lies. All lies.

1013
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:28,584
What's the matter
with you tonight, Gus?

1014
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:31,771
- Gus, come on. Let me talk to you.
- Hey, there's Aron.

1015
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:35,317
I've never seen him like this before.
You're a good shoemaker.

1016
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:39,154
There's Aron down there.

1017
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:41,239
Why don't you stay out of politics?

1018
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:42,574
Mr. Albrecht.

1019
01:17:43,451 --> 01:17:46,745
They're pushing him around.
What are they doing?

1020
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,831
That'd kill Dad if he knew that.

1021
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:52,334
Hey, operator,
when does this thing move again?

1022
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:55,795
Hey! Hey!

1023
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,137
Cal, don't! Cal.

1024
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:06,097
Hey, watch yourself, get back!

1025
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,642
Please. Somebody pull him back.

1026
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:12,145
Will you stop bothering me?

1027
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:13,980
Come on.

1028
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:24,532
- Hey, Gus, come on, have a drink.
- No, Charlie, no drink. Please.

1029
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,832
What are you waiting for?

1030
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,088
Mr. Albrecht, calm down.
They're not bad fellows.

1031
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:40,215
Aron, you are a child.

1032
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:47,764
All I tried to do was buy him a drink.

1033
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,600
Gustav.

1034
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,759
You all loved him a few weeks ago.
What's gotten into you?

1035
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:56,534
I'm sick of him sticking up
for the Germans.

1036
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:59,090
- You a friend of the Germans?
- I'm a friend of this German.

1037
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:02,404
Aron, there are rose plants in that
border. Please be careful where you step.

1038
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:06,866
We liked him. He made us laugh
because of his funny German accent.

1039
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:09,536
Let him read this
in his funny German accent.

1040
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,622
What is it?
Let him come down and read it.

1041
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:15,417
- He doesn't have to read anything.
- I will read it.

1042
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,544
Give it to me.

1043
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:25,677
"The government, with deep regret,
informs...

1044
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:36,813
that your son was killed in action,
15th of April.

1045
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,357
He died a hero and an American."

1046
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,195
I'm sor... I'm sorry, Luca. I'm sorry.

1047
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:46,614
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopps. I did not...

1048
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,283
You're not sorry enough.

1049
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:51,411
I don't think he's sorry.
He's not sorry at all.

1050
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:54,914
Why don't we all go on home...
You're not sorry enough.

1051
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:57,083
Why aren't you in the war?

1052
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:58,918
This will make you sorry!

1053
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:30,492
Hello, Charlie.

1054
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,786
Danny, what are you fellows
doing here, anyway?

1055
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:38,166
Get up, Billy. Well, Loretta,
I didn't expect to find you here.

1056
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,043
Evening, Rose.

1057
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:44,756
Looks like they messed up
your rose garden a little here, Gus.

1058
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,050
Somebody owes you an apology.

1059
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,894
Well, how about you folks
all going home now?

1060
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:00,021
I think this'll do for tonight.

1061
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:07,403
Good evening, Mrs. Albrecht.

1062
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:09,697
May I?
Come in.

1063
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:13,117
Hello, Cal.

1064
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,497
This place will be fixed up
just like it was before.

1065
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:18,748
I'm gonna see to it.

1066
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:30,426
Where were you?

1067
01:21:33,264 --> 01:21:35,098
Where did you get his coat?

1068
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:47,986
You all right?

1069
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:52,991
You had to start slugging, didn't you?
Were you showing off for her?

1070
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:55,493
- Huh?
- You had to start slugging.

1071
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:58,246
- I was trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

1072
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,039
I was trying to help you, Aron.

1073
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:03,459
If you wanna slug people,
do it for yourself and not for me.

1074
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:07,797
- And don't lie to me about trying to...
- Aron, I tried to help you!

1075
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:16,306
- Great big Aron.
- You finished?

1076
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:21,811
- No!
- Cal, stop it! Don't.

1077
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:23,146
- Don't.
- Don't do that.

1078
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:25,773
- Don't.
- Abra, don't do that!

1079
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,781
Cal.
Abra.

1080
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:36,367
Wait here.

1081
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,414
- Wait.
- Aron...

1082
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:17,575
I was trying to help him.

1083
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,789
Who am I kidding? I...

1084
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,208
tried to kill him.

1085
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:29,295
Give me a drink.

1086
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:33,841
- Don't drink any more.
- Why?

1087
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:37,011
- No, please. It's not good for you.
- It's good for me.

1088
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:42,141
- No, you're gonna get drunk.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get drunk.

1089
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:46,562
Oh, Cal, please forget it, what
happened up on the Ferris wheel.

1090
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:49,232
It didn't mean anything, really.

1091
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,901
Please, forget it. It
didn't mean anything.

1092
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:55,405
Say it didn't. Please say it didn't.

1093
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:02,829
Someday he's gonna know
who his real son is.

1094
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:04,914
What?

1095
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,501
Someday he's gonna know.

1096
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:14,173
I don't understand you, Cal.
You scare me.

1097
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:20,221
I know. I scare myself.
Abra.

1098
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:42,285
Fix me another drink.

1099
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,789
I want that money.
Now you give it to me.

1100
01:24:50,814 --> 01:24:52,861
You know I haven't
any money here.

1101
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,800
Okay.

1102
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,429
- When will you get it?
- In the morning, I suppose.

1103
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:05,391
Okay. I'll sleep here.

1104
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:10,229
Cal, come on. You've gotta go home.

1105
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:12,277
If you still feel the same way
in the morning...

1106
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:14,039
you come back, we'll
go to the bank...

1107
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:16,593
and I'll see that you get everything
that's coming to you.

1108
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:20,448
I'll buy out your share and
I'll go on and make a fortune with it.

1109
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:25,912
Okay. That seems fair to me, Will.

1110
01:25:52,523 --> 01:25:53,523
Abra.

1111
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,237
What?
- Hey.

1112
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,155
- Who is it?
- Cal.

1113
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:04,617
Cal?
- Yeah.

1114
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:09,247
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I wanna see you.

1115
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:12,458
Wait till I put something on.

1116
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,308
Cal.

1117
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:33,938
I gotta tell you something.
Can you keep a secret?

1118
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:37,441
Yes. What is it, Cal?

1119
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:40,862
What's the matter? You look terrible.

1120
01:26:43,991 --> 01:26:46,242
- I got it.
- What?

1121
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:52,623
Remember that money Dad lost?

1122
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,500
On that lettuce business?

1123
01:26:57,296 --> 01:27:00,923
- I got it.
- You mean you earned it all back?

1124
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:03,843
- I got every cent.
- Well, that's wonderful, Cal.

1125
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:11,475
You got any time off tomorrow
from the hospital?

1126
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:15,146
I get an hour at lunchtime. Why?

1127
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:17,982
Thursday's Dad's birthday.

1128
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:23,279
And I'm gonna give a party for him.

1129
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:31,245
And I want you and me,
you and Aron and me...

1130
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:33,789
to be there.

1131
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:39,629
And I'm gonna give him that money
just like it was a birthday present.

1132
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:42,882
You could come
and help me get some junk...

1133
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:45,843
and we could decorate the house.
- Sure.

1134
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:50,848
And we'll get balloons and...

1135
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:56,687
- Oh, what? Kid stuff, birthday stuff.
- We can go to the five and 10.

1136
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:01,651
- Will you do it?
- I'd like to.

1137
01:28:18,377 --> 01:28:21,462
I'm sort of... Sort of...

1138
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:30,262
Why did I hit Aron?

1139
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:35,017
Why did I hit him so hard?

1140
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:47,822
Will you help me?

1141
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,450
Will you? Will you really help me?

1142
01:28:53,704 --> 01:28:55,204
I'll help you, Cal.

1143
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,335
Be careful.

1144
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:09,093
How'd I get up here? Oh. Oh.

1145
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:21,939
Is your father coming?
- Yeah.

1146
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:25,109
- Cal, don't get nervous.
- Oh, I think it looks beautiful.

1147
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:27,327
- Don't you? I love the way it looks.
- Mm-hm.

1148
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:29,739
- It looks festive, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

1149
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:31,490
Oh, yes, Cal, it looks very pretty.

1150
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:33,993
- Do you think this is childish?
- No, not a bit.

1151
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:37,163
The room looks lovely.
Your father's gonna love it.

1152
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,416
- Hey, how's the turkey?
- It's a good turkey.

1153
01:29:40,584 --> 01:29:42,668
- Smells ready.
- It'll be ready.

1154
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:46,130
- Aron didn't get him anything, huh?
- Well, he told me he had something.

1155
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:57,600
- What?
- Well, he didn't tell me what it was.

1156
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,168
It won't stack up
against mine, will it?

1157
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:08,259
No.

1158
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,488
- Do you wanna see mine?
- I'd like to.

1159
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,198
- I got it wrapped up.
- Show it to me.

1160
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:13,365
- Wanna see it?
- Yes.

1161
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:14,533
Okay.

1162
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:18,120
- You like it?
- It's pretty.

1163
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:19,830
- You think it's pretty?
- Mm-hm.

1164
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,292
Cal, don't drink any more wine.

1165
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,832
Did Aron tell you
what the present was?

1166
01:30:28,857 --> 01:30:29,907
No.

1167
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:34,011
- You sure?
- Honestly, he didn't.

1168
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:36,931
Cal, I'd tell you if he did.
Honestly, I would.

1169
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:41,852
Now everything's gonna go off fine.
Here.

1170
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,980
Oh, the brooms.

1171
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:47,942
- Don't do anything to give me away.
- I wouldn't.

1172
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:50,736
We'll let him come in here
and let the house speak for itself.

1173
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:53,656
We'll just act like
it's any other old day.

1174
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:54,931
Yes. Wait, Cal.

1175
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:58,702
There. Cal.

1176
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,247
Cal.

1177
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,209
You look wonderful.

1178
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:07,878
Thanks.

1179
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:19,890
But I need my son, Mr. Trask.

1180
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:22,893
It isn't that he doesn't want
to fight for his country. He does.

1181
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:24,311
I need him to work the farm.

1182
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,814
Oh, things can't be as bad as you say,
Mr. Piscora.

1183
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:29,400
You must be making plenty of money
out of your crops.

1184
01:31:29,568 --> 01:31:32,987
No money. I sold this year's crop
for 5 cents before I even planted it.

1185
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:34,321
Everything cost so much now.

1186
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:37,074
And now I got to sell next year crop.
So I need my boy.

1187
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:39,160
I can do nothing about it, Mr. Piscora.

1188
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,704
In all conscience,
I cannot excuse your son.

1189
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:44,874
Come on, Papa.
- I don't like it.

1190
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:48,544
I'm telling you. I don't like it.

1191
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:54,842
Oh, hello, Abra. Nice to see you.

1192
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:58,179
- Gonna stay for dinner?
- Yes, I am. Is something the matter?

1193
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:02,224
Oh, no, nothing. I guess I shouldn't
have taken that job in the draft board.

1194
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,804
Oh, did you notice the
snow on Mount Toro?

1195
01:32:04,829 --> 01:32:05,835
Yes, I saw it.

1196
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:08,230
Say, that means we got
a good year coming in.

1197
01:32:08,398 --> 01:32:11,859
- Well, we could use it.
- Hey, let's go in.

1198
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:35,007
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Happy birthday, Mr. Trask.

1199
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:37,635
Is it possible? I'm very touched.

1200
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:38,886
Are you surprised?

1201
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:41,055
I had no idea. I'd forgotten completely.

1202
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:42,431
We knew you had, didn't we?

1203
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:44,975
Completely. I don't know what to say.

1204
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,481
We got... Hey, we got turkey.

1205
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:54,193
And champagne.
Champagne. Oh, we got all the trimmings.

1206
01:32:54,736 --> 01:32:56,820
Champagne.

1207
01:32:57,072 --> 01:33:00,616
We got the trimmings here.
Oh, isn't that pretty? Yes.

1208
01:33:00,784 --> 01:33:02,117
I, uh...

1209
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:07,414
got something for you.

1210
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:11,043
Oh, presents too. Isn't that nice? Look.

1211
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,342
- Ain't you gonna open it up?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

1212
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:22,846
Dad, Abra and I have one for you too,
only we can't exactly give it to you.

1213
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:28,102
I didn't tell Abra I was going
to do this, but we're engaged.

1214
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:34,692
I couldn't have wished
for anything nicer.

1215
01:33:35,986 --> 01:33:38,946
A lovely birthday present.

1216
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:42,491
You have my blessing.
Thank you, Dad.

1217
01:33:43,827 --> 01:33:46,447
But you haven't opened
Cal's present yet.

1218
01:33:46,472 --> 01:33:47,478
No, no.

1219
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:52,584
But I can't imagine having
anything better than this.

1220
01:33:53,003 --> 01:33:54,086
Excuse me.

1221
01:33:55,588 --> 01:33:59,842
Of course I suspected it right along.
But, Cal, coming on my birthday.

1222
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:05,306
What's this?

1223
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:08,851
What is this?

1224
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:14,315
Well, uh, I made it. And it's for you.

1225
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:16,317
It's all the money you
lost on the lettuce.

1226
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:18,736
- You made it? But how?
- Yup.

1227
01:34:21,031 --> 01:34:22,072
Go on.

1228
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:24,950
- Beans.
- Beans?

1229
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:29,872
Yes, we bought futures at 5 cents...

1230
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:35,377
and the war came along
and the price went sky-high.

1231
01:34:36,713 --> 01:34:40,049
So, um, that's for you.

1232
01:34:41,301 --> 01:34:44,219
It's all the money you lost
in the lettuce business.

1233
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,805
That's for you.

1234
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:51,685
- I made it for you.
- Cal, you will have to give it back.

1235
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:58,984
No, I made it for you, Dad.
I want you to have it.

1236
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:03,030
You will have to give it back.
- Who? I can't give it...

1237
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:06,825
- To the people you got it from.
- No, the British Purchasing Agency?

1238
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:09,703
- I can't give it back to them.
- Give it to the farmers you robbed.

1239
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:11,372
We didn't rob anybody, Dad.

1240
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:14,875
We paid 2 cents a pound,
2 cents over market for that stuff.

1241
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:16,085
Cal.

1242
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:19,755
I sign my name
and boys go out and some die...

1243
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:22,508
and some live helpless
without arms and legs.

1244
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:24,551
Not one will come back untorn.

1245
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:28,055
Do you think I could take
a profit from that?

1246
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:33,435
I don't want the money, Cal!
I couldn't take it!

1247
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,814
- I thank you for the thought, but...
- I'll keep it for you.

1248
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:39,775
I'll wrap it up
and we'll just keep it in here...

1249
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:41,276
I'll never take it.

1250
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:44,696
Son, I'd be happy if you'd give me...

1251
01:35:44,864 --> 01:35:47,866
something like...
Well, like your brother's given me.

1252
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:51,954
Something honest and human
and good. Don't be angry, son.

1253
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:55,749
If you want to give me a present,
give me a good life.

1254
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:57,876
That's something I could value.

1255
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:22,060
Cal!

1256
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:28,198
I hate you!

1257
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:44,673
Abra?

1258
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:48,010
What are you doing?

1259
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:54,141
Cal. Oh, Cal.

1260
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:56,643
He doesn't want anything from me.

1261
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:59,938
Cal, don't. Don't.

1262
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:02,483
Please, don't.

1263
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:06,737
Cal. Cal.

1264
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:12,451
Abra!

1265
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:36,183
Don't you ever touch her again.

1266
01:37:38,937 --> 01:37:40,312
I don't trust you.

1267
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:44,483
You're no good.

1268
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:49,738
You're mean and vicious and wild,
and you always have been.

1269
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:51,740
You know it too, don't you?

1270
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:54,576
Father and I have put up
with every vicious thing...

1271
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:58,872
you could think of since you were a
child, and we've always forgiven you.

1272
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:01,792
But now I don't want you
to go near Abra.

1273
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:05,170
I don't want you to talk with her.
Just stay away from her!

1274
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:36,243
You wanna go some place with me, Aron?
Why should I?

1275
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:40,956
I got something to show you.

1276
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:46,295
Think you'll find it very interesting.
What are you talking about?

1277
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:50,757
Maybe our mother didn't die
and go to heaven after all, Aron.

1278
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:54,386
What do you mean by that?
Maybe she didn't.

1279
01:38:54,554 --> 01:38:56,388
Maybe she's alive someplace.

1280
01:38:58,516 --> 01:39:00,142
What are you up to now?

1281
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:03,854
Remember when we were kids,
we used to make up stories about her?

1282
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:09,401
You said she must have looked like
heaven's youngest angel, remember that?

1283
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:12,738
Remember that time I shot that rabbit?

1284
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:15,365
You cried and you said...

1285
01:39:15,533 --> 01:39:18,619
that she would have cried too,
because she was so tenderhearted.

1286
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:21,580
And you said I was bad,
you remember that?

1287
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:25,834
I just wanna show you something.
It's not gonna take very long.

1288
01:39:26,002 --> 01:39:27,461
What's the matter, you afraid?

1289
01:39:27,629 --> 01:39:30,005
I'm not afraid to look at anything
you could show me.

1290
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:35,552
Can you look at the
truth, just once? Huh?

1291
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:41,975
Come on, you can look
at the truth just once. Can't you? Huh?

1292
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:43,727
Come on.

1293
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:48,398
Come on, I wanna show you something.
It won't take very long.

1294
01:40:23,685 --> 01:40:24,893
Oh, Cal.

1295
01:40:27,105 --> 01:40:28,105
Hello.

1296
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:34,277
Oh, Cal.

1297
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:57,134
Mother, this is your other son, Aron.

1298
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,638
Aron is everything that's good, Mother.

1299
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:12,482
Aron. Say hello to your mother.

1300
01:41:19,615 --> 01:41:20,824
Cal.

1301
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:29,833
Say hello to your mother, Aron!
Oh!

1302
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:34,588
Joe! No! No!

1303
01:41:44,724 --> 01:41:46,725
Play another song!
Quiet!

1304
01:41:48,895 --> 01:41:49,936
Five!

1305
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:54,691
I'm thinking of the lilac trees
That shook their purple plumes

1306
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:59,070
I'm thinking of the rivulet
With its cool and silvery flow

1307
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:03,458
Of the old gray rock that shadowed it
And the peppermint below

1308
01:42:09,299 --> 01:42:10,343
Where is Aron?

1309
01:42:10,368 --> 01:42:12,900
I don't know. I'm not
my brother's keeper.

1310
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:14,628
- Where did you go?
- For a ride.

1311
01:42:14,796 --> 01:42:16,963
- What did you quarrel about?
- You.

1312
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:20,133
- You're angry about the money.
- No, I'm not angry.

1313
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:22,385
I like it. I think it's great.

1314
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:25,222
I'm gonna go away
and take that money with me.

1315
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:28,767
I think I'll start me a little business.
Just like my mother did.

1316
01:42:28,935 --> 01:42:33,063
- What do you know about your mother?
- I know where she is and what she is.

1317
01:42:33,231 --> 01:42:36,024
And I know why she left you.
Couldn't stand it.

1318
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:39,402
You didn't really love her
any more than you do me.

1319
01:42:40,112 --> 01:42:42,614
Because of your goodness,
your rightness.

1320
01:42:42,782 --> 01:42:45,450
You never gave either one of us
an inch ever...

1321
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:47,369
from what you thought was right.

1322
01:42:47,537 --> 01:42:51,414
You kept on forgiving us,
but you never really loved us.

1323
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,292
I know why you didn't love me.

1324
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:55,836
Because I'm like my mother...

1325
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:58,922
and you never forgave yourself
for having loved her.

1326
01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:00,590
Oh, yeah.

1327
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:05,053
I'm not gonna forgive him.
I'm never gonna forgive him.

1328
01:43:05,221 --> 01:43:09,975
- Where is Aron?
- He's with her, with his mother.

1329
01:43:10,643 --> 01:43:13,144
She's over there in Monterey,
if you wanna know.

1330
01:43:13,312 --> 01:43:15,063
She owns one of them houses.

1331
01:43:16,524 --> 01:43:19,234
I took Aron there tonight
because I was jealous.

1332
01:43:19,944 --> 01:43:24,489
I've been jealous all my life.
Jealous, I couldn't even stand it.

1333
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:31,371
Tonight, I even tried to buy your love.

1334
01:43:33,499 --> 01:43:35,625
But now I don't want it anymore.

1335
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:39,445
I can't use it anymore.

1336
01:43:39,470 --> 01:43:41,989
Cal, don't talk to
your father like that.

1337
01:43:45,761 --> 01:43:48,054
I don't want any kind of love anymore.

1338
01:43:49,974 --> 01:43:51,474
It doesn't pay off.

1339
01:43:52,018 --> 01:43:53,351
No future in it.

1340
01:43:53,519 --> 01:43:54,853
Don't want it anymore.

1341
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:58,106
Let him go if he wants to.

1342
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:01,526
No.

1343
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:04,988
No, I won't.

1344
01:44:17,835 --> 01:44:19,669
You hate me too, don't you?

1345
01:44:21,172 --> 01:44:22,589
I'm afraid of you.

1346
01:44:27,678 --> 01:44:31,264
What you did to Aron tonight,
I don't know what it will do to him.

1347
01:44:33,935 --> 01:44:36,478
I feel like I'm to blame too.

1348
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:42,525
Adam! Adam! Adam!
Here. What is it?

1349
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:46,029
Drunk and had a couple fights.
He's gone kind of crazy.

1350
01:44:46,197 --> 01:44:50,241
He's at the station now.
I'll drive you down in my car. Cal!

1351
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:55,246
Cal.

1352
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:59,751
- What happened between you and Aron?
- Why?

1353
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:02,921
He's gone kind of crazy.
He's drunk and had a couple of fights...

1354
01:45:03,089 --> 01:45:05,215
and seemed determined
to get himself hurt.

1355
01:45:05,383 --> 01:45:07,300
He's leaving on that
troop train tonight...

1356
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:09,803
and says he's gonna enlist tomorrow
at King City.

1357
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:13,556
Adam's on his way down there now
to talk to him before the train leaves.

1358
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:16,101
I think you better get down there.

1359
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:19,104
Yeah.
- My car's downstairs.

1360
01:45:21,524 --> 01:45:23,233
Aron!

1361
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:26,361
Aron!

1362
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:32,033
'Cause I love from head to toesie

1363
01:45:32,201 --> 01:45:35,704
Lovey mine

1364
01:46:18,247 --> 01:46:20,540
Do you know what a stroke is, exactly?

1365
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:28,006
This one is a leakage of blood
in the brain caused by shock.

1366
01:46:28,174 --> 01:46:30,258
There's been earlier, smaller leakages.

1367
01:46:30,426 --> 01:46:33,595
The left side is paralyzed,
and the right side partly.

1368
01:46:34,013 --> 01:46:36,723
In other words,
your father is nearly helpless.

1369
01:46:37,933 --> 01:46:41,102
- Will he die?
- He might live a week or a year.

1370
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:43,280
He might die tonight.

1371
01:46:50,246 --> 01:46:51,290
Will he know me?

1372
01:46:51,315 --> 01:46:53,847
You'll have to find
that out for yourself.

1373
01:46:58,496 --> 01:46:59,954
Good day.

1374
01:47:00,664 --> 01:47:01,873
Thank you.

1375
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:05,502
Good day, doctor. Good day, Sam.

1376
01:47:07,505 --> 01:47:10,423
Cain rose up against his brother Abel,
and slew him.

1377
01:47:10,966 --> 01:47:15,095
And Cain went away and dwelt
in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

1378
01:47:17,181 --> 01:47:19,516
Now why don't you go away some place?

1379
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:37,200
He's right.
- No.

1380
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:41,704
Yes, he is. He's right.
That's what I'll do.

1381
01:47:42,873 --> 01:47:43,915
That's what I'll do.

1382
01:47:51,757 --> 01:47:54,008
Who's gonna wash these things for me?

1383
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:57,011
Thank you.

1384
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:01,266
- Oh, there you are.
- How is he?

1385
01:48:01,433 --> 01:48:04,310
Oh, he's fine. He's my darling.

1386
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:06,271
Washed his face, combed his hair.

1387
01:48:06,438 --> 01:48:07,981
Can I go in there now?

1388
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:11,943
Just for a minute. I want him to rest.
Gotta get lots of sleep.

1389
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:17,699
- How is he really?
- Haven't I seen you at the hospital?

1390
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:20,285
- Not part of the family, are you?
- No.

1391
01:48:20,452 --> 01:48:22,036
I didn't think so.

1392
01:48:22,204 --> 01:48:25,373
Well, I can tell you,
I won't have this job for long.

1393
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:29,711
That's my luck. Always seem to get them
when they're old and ready to die off.

1394
01:48:44,435 --> 01:48:48,313
Now doesn't he look nice?
He's gonna be a darling patient.

1395
01:48:48,981 --> 01:48:51,858
Even tried to smile at me,
didn't you, my dear?

1396
01:48:53,068 --> 01:48:55,068
- I don't want you to tire my patient.
- Please go.

1397
01:48:55,154 --> 01:48:58,156
Now listen, miss,
don't you try to order me about.

1398
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:00,783
I'll report you to the doctor.

1399
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:03,745
Will you go out of the room
and shut the door?

1400
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:40,240
Father.

1401
01:49:43,661 --> 01:49:44,994
Can you hear me?

1402
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:52,460
I did an awful thing.

1403
01:49:56,632 --> 01:49:57,715
I'm sorry.

1404
01:50:02,221 --> 01:50:03,596
I'm... I'm...

1405
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,122
Mr. Trask.

1406
01:50:32,418 --> 01:50:34,502
Mr. Trask, can you hear me?

1407
01:50:35,587 --> 01:50:37,714
Is it just Cal you won't answer?

1408
01:50:38,924 --> 01:50:40,341
Can you answer?

1409
01:50:42,594 --> 01:50:44,887
I think you can understand me, though.

1410
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:49,475
I think behind your eyes
you're just as alert as ever.

1411
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:53,688
You understand everything I say,
only you can't show it.

1412
01:50:58,110 --> 01:51:00,153
Mr. Trask.

1413
01:51:01,322 --> 01:51:05,158
Excuse me, Mr. Trask,
for daring to speak to you this way...

1414
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:09,829
but it's awful not to be loved.
It's the worst thing in the world.

1415
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:14,584
Don't ask me how I know that.
I just know it.

1416
01:51:14,918 --> 01:51:18,588
It makes you mean and violent and cruel.

1417
01:51:18,756 --> 01:51:21,591
And that's the way
Cal has always felt, all his life.

1418
01:51:22,926 --> 01:51:26,054
I know you didn't mean it to
be that way, but it's true.

1419
01:51:27,848 --> 01:51:32,602
You never gave him your love.
You never asked him for his.

1420
01:51:33,854 --> 01:51:35,772
You never asked him for one thing.

1421
01:51:37,107 --> 01:51:41,069
Cal is going away, Mr. Trask.
But before he goes, well...

1422
01:51:43,155 --> 01:51:47,158
Well, he did something very bad,
and I'm not asking you to forgive him.

1423
01:51:47,618 --> 01:51:50,495
You have to give him some sign
that you love him...

1424
01:51:50,829 --> 01:51:52,747
or else he'll never be a man.

1425
01:51:53,457 --> 01:51:57,710
He'll just keep on feeling guilty
and alone unless you release him.

1426
01:51:59,338 --> 01:52:00,713
Please help him.

1427
01:52:01,256 --> 01:52:04,926
I love Cal, Mr. Trask,
and I want him to be whole and strong...

1428
01:52:05,094 --> 01:52:07,637
and you're the only
one who can do it.

1429
01:52:07,805 --> 01:52:10,223
So try, please try.

1430
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,811
If you could ask him for something...

1431
01:52:15,604 --> 01:52:18,523
Let him help you so that he knows
that you love him.

1432
01:52:19,441 --> 01:52:21,109
Let him do for you.

1433
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:29,492
Excuse me, Mr. Trask, for daring to speak
to you this way, but I just had to.

1434
01:52:34,873 --> 01:52:36,332
You've tired my patient...

1435
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:40,044
and I most certainly shall report it
to the doctor in the morning.

1436
01:52:42,339 --> 01:52:46,259
You don't know that he accuses you.
You don't know what he's thinking about.

1437
01:52:46,552 --> 01:52:49,262
Stop it, Cal.
You gonna cry for the rest of your life?

1438
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:51,556
- No. No.
- Well, then stop it.

1439
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:54,809
Go in there and talk to him
before it's too late.

1440
01:52:54,977 --> 01:52:58,146
- I can't.
- Please try.

1441
01:52:58,522 --> 01:52:59,856
Get it straight.

1442
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:05,027
Get through to him somehow.
Please try, Cal, before it's too late.

1443
01:53:05,863 --> 01:53:08,823
Please. Please.

1444
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:15,621
Is there any coffee around here?
I'll get you some in a minute.

1445
01:53:19,334 --> 01:53:23,629
Cal. Try. Try.

1446
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:26,090
Is there anything to read around here?

1447
01:53:27,885 --> 01:53:29,051
What would you like?

1448
01:53:29,219 --> 01:53:33,389
- Something to get my mind off my feet.
- There's something in there.

1449
01:53:48,322 --> 01:53:52,033
I tried to believe it was born in me...

1450
01:53:52,201 --> 01:53:55,912
and that I couldn't help it,
but that's not so.

1451
01:53:58,290 --> 01:54:00,166
A man has a choice.

1452
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:03,044
You used to say that was where
he was different from an animal.

1453
01:54:03,212 --> 01:54:04,712
You see, I remember.

1454
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:09,342
A man has a choice, and the choice
is what makes him a man, see.

1455
01:54:10,886 --> 01:54:12,178
You see, I do remember.

1456
01:54:12,971 --> 01:54:14,889
- Look, I can't find any coffee.
- Shh.

1457
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:16,682
Get out!

1458
01:54:27,528 --> 01:54:28,528
Look.

1459
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,283
Cal.

1460
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:40,122
Do something...

1461
01:54:42,334 --> 01:54:43,501
for me.

1462
01:54:43,669 --> 01:54:44,919
Yes.

1463
01:54:49,049 --> 01:54:52,093
That woman...

1464
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:57,848
the nurse, can't stand her.

1465
01:54:59,268 --> 01:55:00,935
Get me another.

1466
01:55:16,785 --> 01:55:18,828
I can't stand her either.

1467
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:24,917
And Cal...

1468
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:12,590
What did he say?

1469
01:56:19,306 --> 01:56:22,725
He said, "Don't get anybody else."

1470
01:56:24,269 --> 01:56:26,812
He said, "You stay with me...

1471
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:30,566
and you take care of me."
- Oh.
