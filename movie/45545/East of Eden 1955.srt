1
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:46,473
Nice fat deposit.
You're sure in the right business, Sally.

2
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:47,801
Thank you.

3
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:50,469
Good morning.

4
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:52,814
Deposit.

5
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,441
Another nice deposit.

6
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:05,692
You and Sally are sure
in the right business.

7
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:07,378
I'm in a hurry, please.

8
00:06:57,078 --> 00:06:58,278
Hi, Kate.

9
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:39,325
Have you cleaned up the house
across the way?

10
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:40,819
I haven't had time yet.

11
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,079
You should always do that one first.

12
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:52,289
Anne!

13
00:07:58,596 --> 00:07:59,796
Come here.

14
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:06,626
Did you ever see that kid out there before?

15
00:08:07,146 --> 00:08:09,146
I think maybe he was in the bar last night.

16
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
Send Joe in.

17
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:12,734
Joe.

18
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:20,015
Hello, Pretty Boy.

19
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:28,497
-Call me, Kate?
-Yeah. Take a look out the window.

20
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:32,434
There's a kid who's been following me
all the way to the bank and back.

21
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:00,429
Come here, you young squirt, come here.

22
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:06,008
-You want me?
-What's the idea of throwing that stone?

23
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:09,204
Any law against throwing stones?

24
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:12,115
You're tough? Come here!

25
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:18,354
What are you hanging around here for,
anyway?

26
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:22,351
-Would she talk to me?
-Kate?

27
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,662
What for? What do you want?

28
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:30,684
Just wanna talk to her.

29
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:34,195
-What do you want, you?
-Nothing.

30
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:37,791
You live around here?

31
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:41,702
-In Monterey?
-Salinas.

32
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:43,221
What's your name?

33
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:46,915
You're not talking? Now, look...

34
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:49,243
why are you following Kate around?

35
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:51,154
What's the idea, squirt?

36
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:54,006
Any law against following
around the town...

37
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:57,185
madam, whatever you call her?

38
00:09:57,253 --> 00:10:00,453
I don't know if there's any law against it,
but she don't like it.

39
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,790
She owns that house over there, too,
don't she?

40
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:06,084
But don't you go hanging
around there, squirt. You're too young.

41
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:08,629
Now come on. Now beat it.

42
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,523
Is that her real name?

43
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:16,259
-Kate. Is that her real name?
-Sure, as far as I know. Why?

44
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:19,498
What's her last name?

45
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,375
Nobody's got any last name
around here, kid. Why?

46
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:29,657
You tell her I hate her.

47
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:56,167
I should have gone right on in there.

48
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:59,503
Should have gone right on in there
and talked to her.

49
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:25,762
Cal wasn't home all night.
Boy, is he gonna catch it from Dad.

50
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:28,481
-You know what the girls in class call him?
-No, what?

51
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:30,192
The Prowler.

52
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,260
-I'll tell him that.
-You better not, Aron.

53
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:33,746
-Promise me you won't.
-Why not?

54
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:36,005
Please don't. I don't want you....

55
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,159
-Hi, Cal.
-Hi.

56
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:40,827
Hello, Cal.

57
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:42,921
Excuse me for talking.

58
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,790
We're going down to see the icehouse
that Dad's gonna buy.

59
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:47,501
-Do you want to come?
-What icehouse?

60
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:49,977
The one he's buying
to freeze the vegetables with.

61
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,671
He's been talking about it every night
for the last week.

62
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:54,191
Is Dad gonna be there?

63
00:11:54,242 --> 00:11:56,242
Why sure, he's gonna buy it.

64
00:11:58,204 --> 00:11:59,604
I'll skip it.

65
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:02,698
You're gonna have
to see him sometime, Cal.

66
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:05,592
-Come on.
-Hey, Aron.

67
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:06,712
Yeah?

68
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,780
-Why don't you ask me where I've been?
-Would you tell me?

69
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,159
-No.
-Then what's the use of my asking?

70
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:19,381
-Is Dad mad at me?
-Well, you were out all night.

71
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:21,683
He was worried.

72
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:24,012
Yeah, I bet.

73
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:27,748
You gonna come or not?

74
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,927
Okay. I'll see you at supper.

75
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:34,438
He's coming.

76
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,149
He's coming.

77
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,691
You see, Will, I got the idea
from an article I read.

78
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:49,402
They dug up a mastodon
somewhere in Siberia.

79
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:53,113
Been in the ice for thousands of years
and the meat was still good.

80
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:54,258
Mastodon?

81
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:01,705
What have you got to say for yourself?

82
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:06,953
This is my son, Cal.

83
00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:10,864
When you were his age,
I imagine you thought it only right...

84
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:13,592
to let your father know
before you stayed out all night.

85
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:17,303
Or at least to offer some kind
of apology when you did come home.

86
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,465
Well, times change.

87
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:23,985
As I was saying,
a mastodon is a kind of elephant.

88
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,321
Hasn't lived on the Earth for a long while.

89
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:29,415
-And the meat was still fresh?
-Sweet as a pork chop.

90
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:32,952
You're more excited about this
than you've been for a long time.

91
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:34,897
Now, I seem to be, don't l?

92
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:37,965
See, Will, I've been sort of
in a rut out there in the ranch.

93
00:13:38,302 --> 00:13:41,902
-Sixteen, 17 years, I've kept out of things.
-I know.

94
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:45,255
But now I feel that
if I could only do something...

95
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,200
some little thing for, before I die,
some little thing for progress...

96
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:53,014
for people, maybe.
Call it anything you want.

97
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:56,316
I might make up for all the years
I've been lying fallow.

98
00:13:56,653 --> 00:14:00,453
So, lately I've been reading up all I can
about refrigeration.

99
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:04,015
And I can't get it out of my head
that you can keep anything good...

100
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:07,769
as long as you can get it cold enough.
Like that mastodon there.

101
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:10,322
-Good afternoon, Abra.
-Good afternoon, Mr. Trask.

102
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,816
-Hello, Mr. Hamilton.
-Hello.

103
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:13,076
-Hello, Son.
-Hi, Dad.

104
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:17,127
Now my son, Aron, that is,
thinks I may have a good idea here.

105
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:19,298
Dad wrapped a head of lettuce
in wax paper...

106
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,792
and kept it in our icebox
for over three weeks...

107
00:14:21,886 --> 00:14:23,886
and it still came out fresh and good.
Right?

108
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:24,971
Quite right, Son.

109
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:29,222
-Dad, is it all right if we look around?
-'Course, Aron. Belongs to us now.

110
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:34,261
Do you know where the biggest market
for vegetables is in the winter?

111
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:36,198
-Where?
-New York City.

112
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,075
And they can't raise them there.

113
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,960
But the railroad had promised me
those fruit cars.

114
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:45,339
Don't you have anything to say to me, Cal?

115
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,650
-Yeah.
-It's about time. Well?

116
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:52,195
I read in the Monterey newspaper...

117
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,341
that if we get into this war...

118
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,060
there are gonna be some fortunes made.

119
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,780
But you're gonna make them
in beans and corn, and stuff like that.

120
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:06,819
-You don't need all this ice.
-You're perfectly right.

121
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,530
Beans are up to 3 cents.

122
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:10,598
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

123
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:12,683
And they keep, too, don't they?

124
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:15,969
But I'm not particularly interested
in making a profit, Cal.

125
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:23,544
Look here, Will.

126
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:26,413
I'm not an inventor nor a scientist...

127
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:28,741
but I know I have an idea here.

128
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:32,434
I come from a whole family of inventors.
People full of ideas like this one.

129
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:34,788
I'm the only one that didn't have an idea...

130
00:15:34,873 --> 00:15:36,473
and the only one that ever made a dime.

131
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,750
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

132
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:41,844
Put out that cigarette!
That place is full of sawdust!

133
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:49,692
-Come on, Adam, he's just thoughtless.
-Thoughtless? He's inconsiderate.

134
00:15:49,888 --> 00:15:52,488
I don't know.
I'm at my rope's end with that boy.

135
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,399
I don't understand him. I never have.

136
00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:57,276
Aron I've understood since he was a child.

137
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:02,566
Help me up.

138
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:08,971
-He doesn't like anybody, does he?
-Who, Dad?

139
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:10,673
No, Cal.

140
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:13,384
It's dark in here and spooky.

141
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:16,304
Why is he so alone all the time?

142
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:19,581
-He wants to be.
-Nobody wants to be alone all the time.

143
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,709
Dad's made a wonderful buy, hasn't he?
We'll freeze vegetables.

144
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:25,045
It'll really give him something
to live for now.

145
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,139
What's the matter, Abra,
don't you like Cal?

146
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:30,667
-I guess I don't know him very well.
-I love him.

147
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,170
Well, naturally, he's your brother.
He's scary.

148
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:36,932
-Scary?
-When he looks at you.

149
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:39,443
Sort of like an animal.

150
00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:41,328
I don't know, he scares me.

151
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:44,822
Aron, when are we gonna get married?

152
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:48,776
Just as soon as I get through
with that darned school.

153
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:51,338
I wish it was right now.

154
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:55,092
-So do I.
-Do you?

155
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,910
Abra.

156
00:17:06,004 --> 00:17:07,404
-When we get--
-I love you, Aron.

157
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:10,064
When we get married,
it's going to be perfect.

158
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:12,992
Everything about it is going to be perfect.

159
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:41,144
You're gonna make
a wonderful mother, Abra.

160
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:44,098
-I hope so.
-You are.

161
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:46,609
A perfect one.

162
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:51,137
You don't remember your mother at all,
do you, Aron?

163
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:54,273
No, she died
right after Cal and I were born.

164
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,610
Must be hard never to have had a mother.

165
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:02,415
-What's that?
-Look, what's he doing up there?

166
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,360
-Crazy guy.
-He's watching us.

167
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:07,437
-No, he isn't.
-Yes, he is, too.

168
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:10,331
Let's move over here. Aron.

169
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:25,311
-He's not watching us.
-I feel as if he can still see us.

170
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,695
I love you, Aron.

171
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:35,598
Really, I do. Really.

172
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:39,126
Sure. I love you, too.

173
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,805
Cal, stop! Stop that, Cal!

174
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:02,916
What are you doing? Stop it!

175
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:08,695
"Blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven...

176
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:10,432
"whose sin is covered.

177
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:15,143
"Blessed is the man unto whom
the Lord imputeth not iniquity...

178
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:19,165
"and in whose spirit there is no guile."

179
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:23,135
And you are forgiven, Cal.

180
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:28,081
I think there is no iniquity
in your actions...

181
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,634
only something I do not know.

182
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:35,205
Why did you push that ice down?

183
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,270
I don't know.

184
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:42,572
Was it....

185
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,449
Was it vengeance? Anger?

186
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:51,011
Fear that I would punish you
for not coming home last night?

187
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:52,999
What was it?

188
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,727
I wanted to see it slide down the chute.

189
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:02,706
-Perhaps you had better read from here on.
-I'll read it, Dad.

190
00:20:02,843 --> 00:20:05,043
No, it's for Cal to read.

191
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:07,345
Start at the fifth verse.

192
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,090
Verse 5.

193
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:31,276
"l acknowledge my sin unto thee,
and mine iniquity have I not hid.

194
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:34,012
"I said, I will confess my transgressions
unto the Lord...

195
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,732
"and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin. Selah."

196
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:37,834
Go on.

197
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:44,507
Six.

198
00:20:44,758 --> 00:20:46,758
And I suggest a little slower, Cal.

199
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:49,452
And you don't have to read
the verse numbers.

200
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:53,772
"For this shall every one that is godly
pray unto thee.

201
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:55,934
"And surely in the floods of great waters...

202
00:20:56,228 --> 00:20:59,228
"they shall not come nigh unto him.
Selah."

203
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:00,365
Seven.

204
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:02,007
Not the numbers, Cal.

205
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:06,076
"Thou art my hiding place,
thou shalt preserve me from trouble...

206
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:10,038
"thou shalt compass me about
with songs of deliverance. Selah."

207
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:14,868
-Eight.
-You have no repentance! You're bad!

208
00:21:14,996 --> 00:21:16,396
Through and through, bad.

209
00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:19,265
Excuse me. I'll go out and wait for Abra.

210
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:31,751
You're right. I am bad.
I knew that for a long time.

211
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:34,896
I didn't mean that, Cal. I spoke in anger.

212
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:37,216
Well, it's true.

213
00:21:38,352 --> 00:21:40,152
Aron's the good one.

214
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:42,238
I guess there's just a certain amount...

215
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:44,314
of good and bad you get
from your parents...

216
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,800
-and I just got the bad.
-That's not true.

217
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:48,302
Cal, listen to me.

218
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:50,988
You can make of yourself
anything you want.

219
00:21:51,282 --> 00:21:53,482
It's up to you. A man has a choice.

220
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:56,175
That's where he's different from an animal.

221
00:21:58,997 --> 00:22:01,197
You don't listen. You'll never remember.

222
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:09,164
My mother...

223
00:22:13,803 --> 00:22:15,803
she's not dead and gone to heaven...

224
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,940
is she?

225
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,460
Why do you ask that?

226
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:23,945
She's not dead at all.

227
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:27,864
She's not buried in the East
like you said, either.

228
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:29,801
She's alive.

229
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:32,061
-What makes you think so?
-I heard from a guy.

230
00:22:32,363 --> 00:22:33,763
-Who?
-I don't know his name.

231
00:22:33,823 --> 00:22:36,023
He was just passing through.

232
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:39,968
How come you told Aron and me she died?

233
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:42,688
-I thought it would save you pain.
-Pain?

234
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:52,272
If she was still alive,
where do you think she'd be?

235
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:55,383
I have no idea. She went East.

236
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:56,919
How do you know?

237
00:22:57,596 --> 00:23:01,596
When she left the ranch we lived on
when you and Aron were born...

238
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,210
I heard she went East.

239
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,320
What was she like? Was she bad?

240
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:10,231
I guess she....

241
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,760
I never really knew what she was like.
She wasn't like other people.

242
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:17,313
There was something she seemed to lack.

243
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:21,067
Kindness, maybe. Conscience.

244
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:25,455
I never knew what she was after.

245
00:23:25,957 --> 00:23:28,557
-How come she left you?
-I never knew that, either.

246
00:23:28,877 --> 00:23:32,477
She was so full of hate.

247
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,230
-Hate for you?
-For everything.

248
00:23:39,512 --> 00:23:42,112
You won't tell Aron that she didn't die?

249
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:43,857
No.

250
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:47,125
Must not do anything to hurt Aron.

251
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:54,207
Where'd you get that scar
you got on your shoulder, Father?

252
00:23:54,318 --> 00:23:56,118
I've told you, Cal.

253
00:23:56,612 --> 00:24:00,012
It's an old wound I got
in the lndian campaigns.

254
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:04,174
-Why do you ask that now?
-What'd she look like? Was she pretty?

255
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:08,987
She had the most lovely hands.

256
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:10,524
Like ivory.

257
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:13,835
She took such good care of them.

258
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:16,572
Her mother had arthritis.

259
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:19,831
She was always afraid
it would come to her in her hands.

260
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:27,824
Talk to me, Father.

261
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:35,489
I got to know who I am.
I got to know who I'm like.

262
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,008
I got to know....

263
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:39,728
Where is she?

264
00:24:40,822 --> 00:24:43,222
I'm telling you, truthfully, Cal...

265
00:24:44,158 --> 00:24:46,358
after she left, I never heard from her.

266
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:51,372
Cal, wait. I want to talk more with you.

267
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:54,657
If you leave this room now
we may never be able to talk again.

268
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:57,028
You coming home tonight, Cal?

269
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,296
What's the difference?
You're home. You're the one he wants.

270
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:02,824
Good evening, Cal.

271
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:06,386
High strung. Very high strung.

272
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:09,689
Good evening, Abra.
Where is my chess victim?

273
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:12,017
-He's waiting for you, Mr. Albrecht.
-Good.

274
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,511
What do you suppose he meant by that?

275
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,376
Go on, beat it!

276
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:34,547
Your wife has called up three times.

277
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:38,424
-My wife's a--
-I know she is. Now beat it.

278
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,779
Joe!

279
00:25:54,643 --> 00:25:57,443
All right, fella, you've run out of money.

280
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:59,363
Mr. Hawks.

281
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:05,811
-What do you want?
-I want--

282
00:26:05,904 --> 00:26:09,304
-What do you want to drink?
-Beer.

283
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:22,328
Hey!

284
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:25,821
-Where's my drink?
-All right.

285
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,350
That's not very neat, is....

286
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,460
It's okay.

287
00:26:33,014 --> 00:26:34,814
-You'd better get out of here.
-How come?

288
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
You're the one who followed Kate
this morning.

289
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:39,793
-It's a free country, isn't it?
-It's a free country.

290
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:42,696
Only, Joe said if I saw you again,
I was supposed to tell him.

291
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:45,024
You can tell him if you want to.

292
00:26:46,152 --> 00:26:48,552
You're just a kid, ain't you?

293
00:26:49,906 --> 00:26:52,306
-I'm older than you are.
-Yeah, sure, but that isn't--

294
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:54,017
-Hey!
-All right.

295
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:56,945
Kid, please...

296
00:26:56,996 --> 00:26:59,396
you oughtn't to go around
throwing stones and things.

297
00:26:59,707 --> 00:27:02,107
That isn't nice. And drinking beer.

298
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:05,503
There's Joe.

299
00:27:06,588 --> 00:27:09,788
Look, kid, please go.
You don't want to get yourself hurt.

300
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:13,959
You could tell him now, if you want to.
There's your chance.

301
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:17,947
You sure have got a nerve, haven't you?

302
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:28,357
-Do you know Kate?
-This is Kate's place.

303
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:31,693
-She's treating you okay?
-Sure.

304
00:27:31,821 --> 00:27:33,621
I gotta go now, kid.

305
00:27:33,698 --> 00:27:35,098
Is she nice?

306
00:27:35,575 --> 00:27:36,975
Don't let Joe see you, please.

307
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:39,235
She doesn't treat you rough
or anything, does she?

308
00:27:39,537 --> 00:27:42,337
Please, kid, I gotta go now.
It was nice meeting you.

309
00:27:42,457 --> 00:27:45,057
Isn't there anything nice about her at all?

310
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,810
What's the matter, kid?

311
00:27:48,713 --> 00:27:51,113
-She had pretty hands. Did you see them?
-Hands?

312
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,424
Did you look at them?

313
00:27:52,675 --> 00:27:55,675
No, I don't think I ever saw them.
She always wears gloves.

314
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:01,391
Where is she?

315
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:03,442
-You mean now?
-Yeah.

316
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,319
-Back in her office, probably.
-Where's that?

317
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:08,247
Back that way.

318
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:09,715
Will you show me?

319
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,120
Look, kid, please don't start any trouble.

320
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,840
I'm not gonna start any trouble. Come on.

321
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:21,751
We.... You can just point the door to me,
and I'll go there.

322
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,079
No, honest.

323
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,130
This is a tough place. I can't lose this job.

324
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:28,649
-I'm not very good at it, anyway.
-You won't lose it.

325
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:31,952
If I step out of line
Kate will throw me out on my ear.

326
00:28:32,923 --> 00:28:35,323
Come on, will you?

327
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:37,825
You can just show me where the door is.

328
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:39,544
Come on.

329
00:28:41,264 --> 00:28:42,864
Be a sport.

330
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,460
Come on.

331
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:03,509
There's the door.

332
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:05,994
Thank you. You can go back now.

333
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:08,514
What are you gonna do?

334
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,608
Please, kid, don't make any trouble.

335
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,770
I'm not gonna make any trouble.
I'm gonna wait till you're gone. Okay?

336
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:13,935
Will you let me talk to you? Please.

337
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,131
I gotta talk to you.

338
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,221
Joe!

339
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,549
Get out of here! Joe! Tex!

340
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,805
Call the sheriff! Get him out!

341
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,942
Call the sheriff! Get him out of here!

342
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,998
I want to talk to her!

343
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,050
I want to talk to you!

344
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,213
Please, talk to me!

345
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,915
Talk to me, please! Mother!

346
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,937
Is there any law against a guy
trying to see his own mother?

347
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,274
No, I guess there isn't.

348
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,202
Here.

349
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,453
Put this on your cheek. Here.

350
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:22,411
Drink some coffee.

351
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:26,131
How did you find out about Kate, anyway?

352
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:29,225
That guy I saw you talking to
in the bar the other night?

353
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:31,944
The one they call "Rabbit."

354
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:35,672
I thought so. He never was any good.

355
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:38,809
I remember when he used
to work on your father's ranch.

356
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,780
Well, he won't be around anymore, Cal.
He's left town for good.

357
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:49,861
-What do you hang around bars for?
-Any law against hanging--

358
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:52,189
Yes, there is! I'm the law.

359
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,500
Get that through your head.

360
00:31:55,828 --> 00:31:57,428
Shut up!

361
00:32:03,544 --> 00:32:06,744
Does Adam know that you...

362
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:08,881
roam around over here at night?

363
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:16,345
Adam's an old friend of mine,
you know, Cal, from...

364
00:32:16,473 --> 00:32:18,673
way back in his ranch days.

365
00:32:19,602 --> 00:32:23,002
I was afraid when you moved here
last year...

366
00:32:23,772 --> 00:32:26,572
that you might find out something
about Kate.

367
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:30,534
But then she was over here on the Bay...

368
00:32:30,654 --> 00:32:33,854
and you were way over on the other side
of the mountains in Salinas.

369
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:37,999
-So I figured it'd be all right.
-You think he'll ever find out about her?

370
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:40,778
He'd never come over here.

371
00:32:46,086 --> 00:32:47,886
Here. You might as well look at this now.

372
00:32:47,962 --> 00:32:51,762
It's a picture of your father
and your mother on their wedding day.

373
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:55,359
You're the first person
I've ever showed it to.

374
00:33:00,683 --> 00:33:02,083
I knew it.

375
00:33:04,228 --> 00:33:06,028
I knew it was true.

376
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,999
When that old guy told me in the bar,
I knew it.

377
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:16,029
How did you know it was true?

378
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:19,323
'Cause she ain't no good
and I ain't no good.

379
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,260
I knew there was a reason why I wasn't.

380
00:33:30,295 --> 00:33:31,495
I hate her.

381
00:33:31,755 --> 00:33:33,955
And I hate him, too.

382
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,300
Come on, I'll take you home.

383
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:42,445
-You don't have to drive me home!
-I know I don't have to take you home!

384
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,050
Here.

385
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:48,536
A little bit of the hair
of the dog that bit you.

386
00:33:49,272 --> 00:33:50,272
Come on now.

387
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:05,678
How did Dad meet her?

388
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:08,806
Where did she come from?

389
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:12,309
Nobody ever knew
where she come from, really.

390
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:16,454
There were a lot of drifters in those days.

391
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,990
Of all the people.

392
00:34:23,055 --> 00:34:24,655
How come he married her?

393
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,740
You have no idea how pretty she was, Cal.

394
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,260
Young and full of spirit.

395
00:34:30,354 --> 00:34:32,954
And your father hadn't been
off the ranch much, you know.

396
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:35,065
He's not a worldly man.

397
00:34:44,743 --> 00:34:48,343
-Did she shoot him?
-Yes, she did.

398
00:34:50,373 --> 00:34:51,773
How come?

399
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:54,493
I don't know.

400
00:34:57,255 --> 00:34:59,055
Did he do something to her?

401
00:34:59,966 --> 00:35:01,766
-Did he hurt her?
-No.

402
00:35:02,051 --> 00:35:04,051
It wasn't in him to hurt her.

403
00:35:04,554 --> 00:35:08,754
After she left him, he died.
He walked around, but he died.

404
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:14,878
He must have done something to hurt her.

405
00:35:15,398 --> 00:35:17,398
No. No, sir.

406
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:20,683
He gave her everything
that any woman could ask for.

407
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:26,556
You see, your father has more kindness...

408
00:35:27,284 --> 00:35:31,284
and more conscience
than any man that I've ever known.

409
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,690
He's a good man, Cal.
Don't sell him short, boy.

410
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:13,911
It's going to work.

411
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:16,996
If only I can keep them
cold enough long enough.

412
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,160
It's going to work.

413
00:36:45,485 --> 00:36:48,685
All right, there she is. Let's try it.
Step back, girls.

414
00:36:56,955 --> 00:36:59,155
All right, bring her on. Come on.

415
00:37:02,794 --> 00:37:04,594
Now do you think it'll work?

416
00:37:25,733 --> 00:37:28,133
-Good morning, Mr. Trask.
-Good morning.

417
00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:33,355
Somebody swiped our coal chute
right off the wagon.

418
00:37:33,657 --> 00:37:36,057
Dear, dear.
Times are getting pretty lawless.

419
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
It's this war in Europe.

420
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:40,811
There's a wave of lawlessness
spreading through the country.

421
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:42,956
Anyway, somebody swiped our chute.

422
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,641
-Is that where you're loading?
-Yes.

423
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,510
We'll move on, then. Good day, Mr. Trask.

424
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,395
It's this war in Europe.

425
00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:04,244
Do you know where Aron is?

426
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:07,563
He's out in the fields. He's checking.

427
00:38:07,857 --> 00:38:08,857
Can I do something for you?

428
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:12,108
No. There were just some matters
I want to talk over with him.

429
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:14,036
What have you got there?

430
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:18,347
I figured it would save some time. So I....

431
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:22,093
It's very ingenious, Cal. Very ingenious.
Did you think of it?

432
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:23,846
Yep.

433
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:26,323
I'm very pleased
with the way you're taking hold...

434
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:28,225
and are working so well, Cal.

435
00:38:28,294 --> 00:38:30,094
Thanks. Thanks, Dad.

436
00:38:35,384 --> 00:38:38,384
Think you better have your lunch now.
It's time.

437
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:42,014
Hi, Cal.

438
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:46,951
-Aron's out in the field.
-I brought his lunch.

439
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:50,922
-Okay, I'll take it to him.
-Cal.

440
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,119
Lydia, vamoose.

441
00:39:19,177 --> 00:39:20,377
He'll be here in a minute.

442
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:24,236
I've been fixing Aron's lunch.
I'll fix yours, too, if you like, after this.

443
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,990
No, thanks.

444
00:39:28,144 --> 00:39:30,144
Would you be eating with her
if I weren't here?

445
00:39:30,438 --> 00:39:31,438
Who?

446
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:37,434
No, I didn't ask her to come up here.

447
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,490
Girls follow you around, don't they?

448
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:46,575
-Does she bother you?
-She doesn't bother me.

449
00:39:47,538 --> 00:39:48,538
Who is she?

450
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,491
I never saw her before in my life.

451
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:56,445
I'll bet.

452
00:39:59,216 --> 00:40:02,416
You're really working
at this lettuce business, aren't you, Cal?

453
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:04,769
Do you think it'll turn out all right?

454
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:07,446
Your father will lose quite a lot of money
if it doesn't.

455
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:09,366
Just about all he's got.

456
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:12,059
I like your father.

457
00:40:13,396 --> 00:40:14,196
Do you?

458
00:40:19,027 --> 00:40:21,627
I threw away about $3,000 once.

459
00:40:22,363 --> 00:40:23,363
Yeah?

460
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:27,074
-When I was 13.
-You threw it away?

461
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,959
It was a diamond ring worth about that.

462
00:40:29,036 --> 00:40:31,436
At least, my father told me
that's what he paid for it.

463
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:34,947
I threw it in the river.
Made Dad terribly angry.

464
00:40:37,378 --> 00:40:39,178
I reckon it would.

465
00:40:39,255 --> 00:40:41,855
But I forgave him.
And it's been all right ever since.

466
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:43,574
-You forgave him?
-Yes.

467
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:49,945
You forgave him 'cause you threw
a ring of his worth $3,000 into the river?

468
00:40:50,307 --> 00:40:51,707
-That's right.
-And you forgave him?

469
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:53,575
That's right.

470
00:40:53,644 --> 00:40:55,644
Is there an egg in this basket?

471
00:40:57,397 --> 00:41:00,797
You see, I thought he didn't love me.
That made me feel awful.

472
00:41:02,611 --> 00:41:04,811
Girls love their fathers terribly.

473
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,730
Do they?

474
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:09,633
My mother died when I was 13...

475
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:12,909
and Dad got married again soon after that.
Did you know that?

476
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,037
No, I didn't know that.

477
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,374
Are you interested in hearing about me?

478
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:19,459
Yeah.

479
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:26,664
When Dad got married again,
it made me sick.

480
00:41:27,844 --> 00:41:29,444
I just hated everybody.

481
00:41:30,346 --> 00:41:32,346
I used to sit and just glare at people...

482
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,240
or I wouldn't even answer
when they spoke to me.

483
00:41:37,436 --> 00:41:40,436
-Why you telling me all this?
-I want to.

484
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,590
I was that way for months.
I just hated everybody.

485
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,935
I thought nobody in the world loved me.

486
00:41:49,114 --> 00:41:51,114
And it was awful.

487
00:41:53,493 --> 00:41:56,293
Then I found this ring
that Dad gave my new mother...

488
00:41:57,873 --> 00:42:00,473
-so I took it and threw it in the river.
-Good.

489
00:42:02,043 --> 00:42:03,843
I thought you'd like that.

490
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,180
-Did he ever find it?
-Never.

491
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:10,742
They tried.

492
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:13,453
What'd they do to you?

493
00:42:13,513 --> 00:42:16,313
Dad punished me. Not badly, I guess.

494
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:19,032
But I felt
he shouldn't have punished me at all.

495
00:42:19,143 --> 00:42:22,543
I felt he should have loved me more
because I did it.

496
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:24,306
But he didn't.

497
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:27,191
Isn't it funny?

498
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,119
I'm grown up now...

499
00:42:30,404 --> 00:42:32,804
but I still understand kids better
than I do grownups.

500
00:42:32,907 --> 00:42:34,107
You're not so grown-up.

501
00:42:34,158 --> 00:42:36,358
-I'm very grown-up.
-That's a matter of opinion.

502
00:42:36,661 --> 00:42:38,061
I'm very grown-up.

503
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,520
More so than Dad, because I forgave him
for not understanding.

504
00:42:44,376 --> 00:42:46,776
And the minute I forgave him in my mind...

505
00:42:47,504 --> 00:42:49,104
I felt better.

506
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,280
Now we get along fine.

507
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,400
We love each other.
Not like we did when I was 13...

508
00:43:03,562 --> 00:43:06,562
but enough so we can live together
till I get married.

509
00:43:10,443 --> 00:43:13,643
He's just my father now.
Nothing to rave about.

510
00:43:14,614 --> 00:43:17,814
I still don't like her much,
but then, she's a woman.

511
00:43:30,671 --> 00:43:33,671
My, that girl just hates me, doesn't she?

512
00:43:34,842 --> 00:43:37,042
You better tell her I'm your brother's girl.

513
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:39,736
I don't have to explain anything
to anybody.

514
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:45,175
I'll go now and leave the field to her.

515
00:43:49,231 --> 00:43:51,431
My, your hair's in a mess.

516
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,870
Dad, what's that?

517
00:43:57,156 --> 00:44:00,356
That's something Cal rigged up.
It's a good idea.

518
00:44:00,492 --> 00:44:02,492
Aron! I brought your lunch.

519
00:44:03,203 --> 00:44:05,603
Looks like a coal chute.

520
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:07,723
Coal chute?

521
00:44:11,336 --> 00:44:12,936
Okay, woman, where's the beans?

522
00:44:13,004 --> 00:44:14,004
Cal!

523
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:20,358
What makes you think you have the right
to come and take something like this?

524
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,920
You probably lost those men their jobs.
Now, you take it back.

525
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:34,764
He's praising Cal and Cal is lapping it up.

526
00:44:34,901 --> 00:44:37,501
Aron! Look, have one of those
made of wood.

527
00:44:37,612 --> 00:44:39,812
-It'll save a lot of time.
-Yes, sir!

528
00:44:43,451 --> 00:44:45,451
-Good waste of time and money.
-And lettuce.

529
00:44:45,744 --> 00:44:48,744
-What'd you say?
-I said, it's a good idea if it works.

530
00:44:48,873 --> 00:44:51,273
It's gonna work, 'cause it's gotta work.

531
00:44:51,584 --> 00:44:53,584
It's gotta work, 'cause I said so.

532
00:44:55,546 --> 00:44:57,546
If it don't work, it ain't that kid's fault.

533
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,040
I never saw anybody work
so hard in my life.

534
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:06,079
Let's go, Pete. Now, Leonard!

535
00:45:09,101 --> 00:45:11,501
Good luck, Adam.

536
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:47,969
Do you know the principle
of the internal combustion engine?

537
00:45:48,097 --> 00:45:50,497
No, I'm afraid not.
Will, I'll never be able to--

538
00:45:50,808 --> 00:45:52,808
Sure you will. You just listen to Roy.

539
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:55,093
He's been to the automobile school
in Chicago.

540
00:45:55,187 --> 00:45:57,987
Mr. Trask has just revolutionized
the entire vegetable market.

541
00:45:58,315 --> 00:46:00,915
-Wait till those cars get to New York.
-Don't you worry.

542
00:46:01,026 --> 00:46:03,026
It's about time he owned
his own automobile...

543
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,920
and about time he learned to drive it.

544
00:46:04,988 --> 00:46:07,588
-Now don't you think so, Roy?
-I'll do my best.

545
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:09,699
Now pay strict attention, boys.

546
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:11,819
Don't touch that!

547
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,470
Wait till it's explained to you.

548
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:16,538
No, now for heaven's sake,
don't touch anything, anybody.

549
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,300
The power of the explosion
is exerted on a piston...

550
00:46:20,629 --> 00:46:24,029
and through connecting rod
and crankshaft...

551
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:27,982
through transmission,
thence to rear wheels.

552
00:46:28,136 --> 00:46:30,736
-Got that so far?
-Sure, he's got that.

553
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:33,855
Now, we go on
to the operation of the automobile.

554
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:37,026
This here's the ignition key.

555
00:46:37,937 --> 00:46:40,737
Would you mind putting out
that cigarette, please.

556
00:46:40,857 --> 00:46:44,057
Turn this doohickey here to the left.
That puts her on battery.

557
00:46:44,193 --> 00:46:46,193
-See where it says "bat"?
-Yes.

558
00:46:46,278 --> 00:46:49,678
-Bat, short for battery.
-That's right. Good boy.

559
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:51,641
Thank you. Thank you very much.

560
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,309
First you gotta retard the spark.

561
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:56,969
If you don't retard the spark,
she'll probably kick your blasted arm off.

562
00:46:57,331 --> 00:46:58,731
Now remember that.

563
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:00,399
This here is the spark.

564
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:03,667
You push her way up. Listen.

565
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:08,255
-This here's the gas. You push her--
-Down.

566
00:47:09,217 --> 00:47:12,417
-You had lessons before.
-No, I just saw you do it.

567
00:47:13,388 --> 00:47:15,988
-You're a pretty smart old buzzard.
-Thank you very much.

568
00:47:16,308 --> 00:47:18,708
-Keep your eyes open, don't you?
-Try to.

569
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,036
Now, this here is the crank.

570
00:47:21,313 --> 00:47:24,313
See this wire sticking out of the radiator?
That's the choke.

571
00:47:24,649 --> 00:47:27,249
Now watch careful.
Grab hold of the crank like this.

572
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:28,969
Push in till she catches.

573
00:47:29,028 --> 00:47:30,428
See how my thumb is turned down?

574
00:47:30,697 --> 00:47:32,097
I noticed that. Why do you do that?

575
00:47:32,156 --> 00:47:34,956
If you put her around this way
with my thumb around her...

576
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:37,076
she'd probably knock
my blasted thumb off.

577
00:47:37,161 --> 00:47:41,161
Dear, dear. First you lose your blasted arm
and then you lose your blasted thumb.

578
00:47:41,332 --> 00:47:43,332
-That's kind of wrong way around.
-How's that?

579
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:46,617
He made a joke.
I never did see him so happy.

580
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:50,171
You pull out this choke
turn her around to suck gas in.

581
00:47:50,925 --> 00:47:52,925
Then you give her a hard spin.

582
00:47:53,427 --> 00:47:56,427
-She caught, first time!
-Caught on what?

583
00:47:57,389 --> 00:47:59,189
Advance the spark and retard the gas.

584
00:47:59,475 --> 00:48:01,875
Reach over real quick and switch
to mag. That's magneto.

585
00:48:02,186 --> 00:48:03,986
So, there you are.

586
00:48:04,063 --> 00:48:06,463
Isn't that wonderful?

587
00:48:06,774 --> 00:48:09,174
Of course, it isn't exactly
going anywhere, is it?

588
00:48:09,276 --> 00:48:10,276
That's the easy part.

589
00:48:10,527 --> 00:48:12,327
-Adam.
-I want you all to repeat after me.

590
00:48:12,404 --> 00:48:15,004
Spark up, gas down.

591
00:48:15,115 --> 00:48:16,515
Switch to bat.

592
00:48:16,575 --> 00:48:19,175
Crank to compression, thumb down.

593
00:48:19,494 --> 00:48:21,294
You get that? Let's have it again.

594
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:23,371
Spark up, gas down.

595
00:48:23,665 --> 00:48:25,665
-What's the matter?
-Big snow slide.

596
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:28,759
Closed the pass and stopped the cars
about 100 miles out.

597
00:48:28,878 --> 00:48:31,478
Can see water running out of the cars.

598
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:47,519
It's still a good idea.
Cold can preserve things.

599
00:48:47,647 --> 00:48:49,647
Someday, somebody'll prove it.

600
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,800
-It was your idea.
-No!

601
00:48:53,903 --> 00:48:56,703
It was presumptuous of me
to think it would be I.

602
00:48:58,908 --> 00:49:01,508
Guess we bit off more lettuce
than we could chew.

603
00:49:03,495 --> 00:49:06,895
What do you know about that?
I thought he'd really be hurt.

604
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:10,492
You don't understand him.

605
00:49:11,837 --> 00:49:14,037
-You can't go in there.
-I gotta see Will Hamilton.

606
00:49:14,131 --> 00:49:16,531
He won't be through for an hour.
They just started.

607
00:49:16,633 --> 00:49:18,633
-Let me see him.
-There's a war in Europe.

608
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:21,719
These boys are trying
to get themselves in shape. So beat it.

609
00:49:21,847 --> 00:49:23,447
Right, left.

610
00:49:37,695 --> 00:49:39,495
Now, deep knee bends, follow me.

611
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:54,101
-What's that?
-That's the fire bell.

612
00:49:54,378 --> 00:49:55,978
We better have a look.

613
00:49:58,132 --> 00:50:01,532
-It may be the Germans.
-Fire, Germans, who cares? I surrender.

614
00:50:03,554 --> 00:50:04,954
-Howdy, Mr. Albrecht.
-Hello, Cal.

615
00:50:05,222 --> 00:50:07,022
-Mr. Hamilton.
-There's a fire somewhere.

616
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:08,499
-No. I rang the bell.
-You rang it?

617
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,767
Yeah. I had to see you.

618
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,610
You know, you're crazy.
You're really crazy.

619
00:50:11,895 --> 00:50:14,095
I knew it when you pushed that ice
down the chute.

620
00:50:14,398 --> 00:50:16,998
Let's get out of here
before they start up that piano again.

621
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:20,517
There must be some easier way
to stop the Germans than this, anyway.

622
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:24,054
-You see, I gotta make some money.
-Sure, everybody's got to.

623
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:28,659
Remember, you said that
if you wanna make money...

624
00:50:28,995 --> 00:50:30,195
you ought to raise beans?

625
00:50:30,247 --> 00:50:32,447
Yeah, beans are up 3.5 cents now.

626
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,740
Now, the way I figure it, it's like you said.

627
00:50:35,043 --> 00:50:37,043
The country's gonna get into war, isn't it?

628
00:50:37,128 --> 00:50:38,928
I don't see any way out.

629
00:50:39,214 --> 00:50:42,614
-War's good for business.
-The best there is.

630
00:50:42,759 --> 00:50:46,159
See, that's why I wanna go into beans.

631
00:50:46,721 --> 00:50:50,121
See, I gotta get enough money
to give my father back what he lost.

632
00:50:52,143 --> 00:50:53,543
I see.

633
00:50:54,645 --> 00:50:56,845
You think you can make
all that money back?

634
00:50:56,939 --> 00:50:58,339
I gotta.

635
00:50:58,399 --> 00:51:00,199
You know, you're crazy.

636
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:03,101
Look, Cal, don't you know...

637
00:51:03,195 --> 00:51:05,995
that you gotta have money
in order to make money?

638
00:51:06,532 --> 00:51:08,332
-I'll get some money.
-How?

639
00:51:09,243 --> 00:51:10,443
I'll get it.

640
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:14,311
Look, don't get so near to me.
I don't wanna get all hot again.

641
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:17,265
-How much money could you get?
-What do you think I need?

642
00:51:17,584 --> 00:51:19,584
If you had $5,000....

643
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:25,249
$5,000?

644
00:51:26,134 --> 00:51:29,934
It's a little different when you start
putting it into figures, isn't it?

645
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:34,607
I know you wanna help your father...

646
00:51:34,684 --> 00:51:37,684
but a kid your age can't be expected
to put his hands on $5,000.

647
00:51:38,021 --> 00:51:41,421
Maybe if you could raise $100 or so,
we could let you have a little share.

648
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:43,966
I don't want a little share,
I want the whole thing.

649
00:51:44,277 --> 00:51:46,877
-I'll get $5,000.
-Maybe if you and Aron went in together--

650
00:51:46,988 --> 00:51:49,588
Aron ain't got nothing to do with this.
This is my deal.

651
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:50,907
I'll get the $5,000.

652
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,950
What're you gonna do, borrow it?

653
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:56,329
Yeah.

654
00:51:57,415 --> 00:51:59,615
All right. If you can borrow $5,000...

655
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:02,517
I know a farmer who's got over 800 acres.

656
00:52:02,628 --> 00:52:05,428
-It's under cultivation.
-All right. What do we do?

657
00:52:06,173 --> 00:52:08,973
If we can guarantee him 5 cents a pound...

658
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:11,493
and make him a seed loan,
he'll plant beans.

659
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:12,995
So will a lot of other farmers.

660
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:15,863
Why, we can contract
all the bean acreage you want.

661
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,460
That's it. That's great. When do we start?

662
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,839
How do you know the price
will go above 5, though?

663
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:26,950
Did you read the newspapers
this morning?

664
00:52:27,027 --> 00:52:29,227
We're apt to be in war any minute.

665
00:52:29,321 --> 00:52:32,921
You know I got a contract
with the British Purchasing Agency...

666
00:52:33,074 --> 00:52:35,474
and I got a friend in
the Quartermaster Corps.

667
00:52:35,577 --> 00:52:37,977
Do you know
that we could sell all the dry beans...

668
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,079
that we can find
at 10 cents a pound or more?

669
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:42,973
That's what I want. That's it. See?

670
00:52:43,918 --> 00:52:46,318
-How much will I make?
-Enough for what you want.

671
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,610
-What does Cal stand for?
-Caleb.

672
00:53:38,555 --> 00:53:40,155
It's in the Bible.

673
00:53:42,934 --> 00:53:45,534
-What's your brother's name?
-Aron.

674
00:53:46,688 --> 00:53:48,288
That's in the Bible, too.

675
00:53:52,735 --> 00:53:53,935
What's he like?

676
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,080
He looks like you.

677
00:54:00,243 --> 00:54:01,843
Is he like me?

678
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:04,119
No. He's good.

679
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:09,567
I'm more like you.

680
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:14,789
How's Adam?

681
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:17,074
How's your father?

682
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:20,602
I don't wanna talk about him.

683
00:54:29,229 --> 00:54:31,629
-You don't?
-No.

684
00:54:39,864 --> 00:54:42,664
I didn't know who you were
when you were here before.

685
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,210
I knew you didn't.

686
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,040
Aren't you afraid
to come around here again?

687
00:54:51,334 --> 00:54:53,734
Yeah, I am. No. Well, kind of.

688
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:00,241
What do you want?

689
00:55:02,595 --> 00:55:04,395
Just to look at me?

690
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:11,902
I want $5,000.

691
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:27,925
All right, come on in. Sit down.

692
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:29,862
Come in.

693
00:55:31,581 --> 00:55:32,781
Try that chair.

694
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:37,561
You got your father's eyes.

695
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,880
That's all I can see of him.

696
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:45,217
-You're a nice looking boy.
-Yes, ma'am.

697
00:55:49,307 --> 00:55:51,907
-I was very beautiful once.
-Yes, ma'am.

698
00:55:56,606 --> 00:55:58,206
Caleb and Aron.

699
00:55:58,691 --> 00:56:01,291
Your father still thinks
he's living in the Bible, huh?

700
00:56:01,611 --> 00:56:02,811
Them's just names.

701
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:05,888
Joe says that you go to school in Salinas.

702
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:07,999
Are you good in your studies?

703
00:56:09,952 --> 00:56:11,752
I get by with them.

704
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:13,838
Does Aron get by with them?

705
00:56:14,123 --> 00:56:15,123
He's bright.

706
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:19,817
What are you gonna do when you finish?
You're going to college?

707
00:56:21,005 --> 00:56:21,805
Maybe.

708
00:56:22,464 --> 00:56:25,264
Or back to some ranch?

709
00:56:25,384 --> 00:56:28,184
No, I don't like the ranch.

710
00:56:29,138 --> 00:56:30,938
You take after me.

711
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,040
Makes me mad just to think about a ranch.

712
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:38,053
Sit down.

713
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:43,909
Thanks.

714
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:53,651
What do you want with $5,000?

715
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,179
I want to go into business.

716
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:59,447
-You're a little young for that, aren't you?
-I'm old enough.

717
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:02,609
Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess you are.

718
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:05,946
-What business do you wanna go into?
-Beans.

719
00:57:09,177 --> 00:57:11,777
Beans are up to 3.5 cents now.

720
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:14,487
And if we get into war,
they're gonna go up to 10, 12.

721
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,398
-If we get into the war.
-That's a gamble you have to take.

722
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:19,518
-Will Hamilton says that--
-Will?

723
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:22,012
You going into business
with Will Hamilton?

724
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,506
You see...

725
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,842
my father, he lost about all he had in--

726
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,996
Yeah, I know. I heard about that.

727
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,784
I wanna make enough to pay him back.

728
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:40,946
What's the matter with him?
Can't he make any money?

729
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:42,083
Yeah.

730
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:45,836
Only....

731
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,530
Only he's too good to bother with money.

732
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,012
Okay.

733
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,642
What makes you think I'd give you $5,000?

734
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,567
I don't know who else to ask.

735
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,746
You got a lot of nerve coming to me.

736
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,623
Why? I didn't do anything to you.

737
00:58:22,581 --> 00:58:24,781
It's a good business venture.

738
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:30,595
I'll pay you back. I'll give you interest.

739
00:58:30,714 --> 00:58:33,314
You're a business woman, ain't you?

740
00:58:33,425 --> 00:58:34,825
One of the best, Son.

741
00:58:36,345 --> 00:58:40,945
You know, Sam told me that you think
I ought to be run out of town.

742
00:58:44,478 --> 00:58:48,278
You're afraid that your father and Aron
might find out about me, is that it?

743
00:58:52,402 --> 00:58:54,602
This $5,000, now.

744
00:58:54,696 --> 00:58:57,496
That wouldn't be
any kind of blackmail, would it?

745
00:58:57,615 --> 00:58:59,415
I never thought about that.

746
00:59:00,326 --> 00:59:02,726
But now that you do, it's a good idea, huh?

747
00:59:04,289 --> 00:59:06,089
-I guess, maybe.
-It's not.

748
00:59:10,545 --> 00:59:13,945
Anyway, I'm not gonna hurt
your precious father or your brother.

749
00:59:14,715 --> 00:59:16,915
-Do they know anything about me?
-No.

750
00:59:17,426 --> 00:59:19,426
Father thinks you're in the East...

751
00:59:20,971 --> 00:59:22,771
and Aron thinks you're dead.

752
00:59:23,891 --> 00:59:27,691
Then, there's no reason to think
that they ever will find out about me.

753
00:59:27,853 --> 00:59:30,853
We don't exactly move in the same circles.

754
00:59:37,446 --> 00:59:39,046
What are you staring at?

755
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:42,599
How come you did it?

756
00:59:43,702 --> 00:59:44,702
Did what?

757
00:59:46,413 --> 00:59:47,613
Shot my father?

758
00:59:48,498 --> 00:59:50,898
Did he tell you that?

759
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,720
How come you ran away from all of us?
How come you shot him?

760
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,040
-Ran away and did all that kind of stuff?
-None of your business.

761
01:00:01,636 --> 01:00:03,836
I shot him because he tried to stop me.

762
01:00:04,973 --> 01:00:07,373
I could have killed him if I'd wanted to,
but I didn't.

763
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:09,684
I just wanted him to let me go.

764
01:00:10,603 --> 01:00:13,803
-Why?
-Because he tried to hold me.

765
01:00:15,817 --> 01:00:17,017
He wanted to tie me down.

766
01:00:17,068 --> 01:00:19,668
He wanted to keep me
on a stinking little ranch...

767
01:00:19,779 --> 01:00:21,979
away from everybody.
Keep me all to himself.

768
01:00:22,073 --> 01:00:24,273
Nobody holds me.

769
01:00:24,992 --> 01:00:26,792
-But he loved you.
-Love.

770
01:00:28,537 --> 01:00:30,537
He wanted to own me.

771
01:00:31,248 --> 01:00:33,648
He wanted to bring me up
like a snot-nosed kid...

772
01:00:33,959 --> 01:00:37,559
and tell me what to do.
Nobody tells me what to do.

773
01:00:39,173 --> 01:00:42,373
Always so right himself.
Knowing everything.

774
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:45,343
Reading the Bible at me.

775
01:00:46,263 --> 01:00:48,463
-What are you grinning at?
-Nothing.

776
01:00:50,016 --> 01:00:52,216
Maybe you know what I'm talking about?

777
01:00:53,562 --> 01:00:55,162
Always so right himself?

778
01:00:55,855 --> 01:00:57,055
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

779
01:00:58,566 --> 01:01:01,766
Maybe like you said out there,
maybe you are more like me.

780
01:01:05,448 --> 01:01:07,048
Yeah, you got sense.

781
01:01:07,742 --> 01:01:10,742
Maybe you don't fall for that slop
any more than I do.

782
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:14,679
Maybe you know what people
are really like. What they want.

783
01:01:14,832 --> 01:01:17,832
I got the toughest house on the coast...

784
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,360
and the finest clientele.

785
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:24,948
Half the stinking city hall go there.

786
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:28,319
They sneak in at night...

787
01:01:28,387 --> 01:01:31,187
and I walk in this front door
in the daytime, see.

788
01:01:32,141 --> 01:01:34,141
And I built it up from nothing.

789
01:01:35,477 --> 01:01:37,477
Now you want $5,000 of my money...

790
01:01:37,771 --> 01:01:40,371
to go into business
to pay your father back what he lost.

791
01:01:40,691 --> 01:01:42,291
You know, that's funny.

792
01:01:43,193 --> 01:01:45,993
I don't think he'll know where I got it.

793
01:01:46,113 --> 01:01:48,313
No, but it's funny just the same.

794
01:01:49,449 --> 01:01:50,649
Your father.

795
01:01:51,535 --> 01:01:53,735
He's the purest man there is, isn't he?

796
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,280
He thought he had me all tied up
with his purity.

797
01:01:59,042 --> 01:02:02,242
And now I give you $5,000
of the money that I made...

798
01:02:02,587 --> 01:02:04,587
to save him his purity.

799
01:02:05,507 --> 01:02:08,907
If you don't think that's funny,
you'd better not go to college.

800
01:02:18,853 --> 01:02:19,853
Okay.

801
01:02:24,066 --> 01:02:26,266
Tell Will Hamilton to come and see me.

802
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,663
He's a good businessman.

803
01:02:34,076 --> 01:02:37,476
How'd he ever happen to let you go
into this bean business, anyway?

804
01:02:38,247 --> 01:02:39,447
I don't know.

805
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:42,958
I do. Maybe he likes you.

806
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:45,294
Maybe.

807
01:02:48,257 --> 01:02:50,257
You're a likeable kid.

808
01:02:59,726 --> 01:03:01,526
You give this to him.

809
01:03:02,854 --> 01:03:05,854
If he wants to gamble
that we get into the war...

810
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,382
it's okay with me.

811
01:03:27,044 --> 01:03:28,444
You're a likeable kid.

812
01:03:36,428 --> 01:03:38,228
Go on, get out of here.

813
01:03:41,016 --> 01:03:43,616
Go on, get out. I'm running a business.

814
01:04:26,269 --> 01:04:28,269
-Them Germans can't fight.
-No.

815
01:04:55,881 --> 01:04:56,881
Hi, partner.

816
01:04:57,549 --> 01:05:00,549
Every day in every way,
we're getting richer and richer.

817
01:05:05,682 --> 01:05:06,682
Kaiser.

818
01:05:06,933 --> 01:05:09,933
All we have to do is call his bluff.
He'll come to heel like a dog.

819
01:05:16,317 --> 01:05:20,117
We'll be there to clean up this mess
for those foreigners in a couple of weeks.

820
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,320
Cal, stop it.

821
01:05:39,673 --> 01:05:40,673
There's Cal.

822
01:05:46,555 --> 01:05:49,355
-Hi, boy. Hey, want some?
-Hello, Cal.

823
01:05:49,892 --> 01:05:50,892
Thanks.

824
01:05:59,693 --> 01:06:03,493
Your own Woodrow Wilson said you gotta
make the country safe for democracy.

825
01:06:04,072 --> 01:06:06,272
-Didn't he say that?
-Yes, he said that.

826
01:06:06,366 --> 01:06:07,566
Will you go?

827
01:06:07,617 --> 01:06:09,617
I think the war will be over. I don't think--

828
01:06:09,911 --> 01:06:13,311
If you believe in all this, why don't you?
If you really think it's right.

829
01:06:13,456 --> 01:06:15,056
I didn't say it was right, Aron.

830
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:17,133
No, I guess you didn't.

831
01:06:19,504 --> 01:06:21,904
Why don't you go back
and join the parade?

832
01:06:28,262 --> 01:06:31,862
Nothing'll ever make me go. Nothing.

833
01:06:33,476 --> 01:06:35,676
I just don't believe it's right.

834
01:06:52,453 --> 01:06:54,653
-Did you water them good?
-Sure, lots of water.

835
01:06:54,955 --> 01:06:56,955
-Not too much, though.
-No, just right.

836
01:07:15,392 --> 01:07:18,192
Marty Hopps got a telegram today.
His boy was killed.

837
01:07:18,311 --> 01:07:20,311
I remember the day we sent him off.

838
01:07:23,107 --> 01:07:25,707
A lot of troop ships have sunk
they don't tell us about.

839
01:07:25,818 --> 01:07:28,218
-It's gonna be a long war.
-Those Germans got an army.

840
01:07:28,529 --> 01:07:30,129
They're a military nation.

841
01:07:30,615 --> 01:07:32,615
Go back where you came from, German!

842
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,300
Go on home, German!

843
01:07:41,876 --> 01:07:43,076
This is just the start.

844
01:07:43,335 --> 01:07:45,535
That rock through the window
is just the beginning.

845
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:47,438
The German people don't want this war.

846
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:50,315
And the stories they tell
of what the Germans are doing...

847
01:07:50,426 --> 01:07:52,426
it simply is not true. Not the good ones.

848
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,920
I've been wondering lately
if we shouldn't all go back to the ranch.

849
01:07:56,056 --> 01:07:58,256
You can't get away from it there, Dad.

850
01:07:59,184 --> 01:08:02,384
I don't know, somehow, on a ranch,
I don't know....

851
01:08:02,729 --> 01:08:06,129
War seems to be
city people's business somehow.

852
01:08:07,526 --> 01:08:10,326
Farmers. What's a farmer got to do
with war?

853
01:08:12,531 --> 01:08:13,731
You tired, Dad?

854
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:18,850
My eyes, I guess.
I work too hard at the Draft Board.

855
01:08:20,455 --> 01:08:23,655
Better have my glasses looked at,
see if they're all right.

856
01:08:26,294 --> 01:08:29,094
I had a look at the bank account
the other day...

857
01:08:29,422 --> 01:08:31,822
not much left after my great fiasco.

858
01:08:34,635 --> 01:08:37,435
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

859
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:44,985
Let's don't worry about money.

860
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,455
Hey, Rantani!

861
01:08:57,574 --> 01:08:59,374
Ain't this some sight?

862
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,060
Beans!

863
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:03,754
Yeah, boy, some beans.

864
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:06,430
You come here everyday, boy,
what do you think...

865
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,750
you gonna make them grow quicker?

866
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,420
He's crazy.

867
01:09:26,352 --> 01:09:29,552
Hey, where have you been?

868
01:09:29,898 --> 01:09:32,498
Come on.

869
01:09:32,817 --> 01:09:34,617
We're gonna have lots of fun tonight.

870
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:49,189
-You won another cigar.
-Wait a minute.

871
01:09:50,543 --> 01:09:53,143
You wanna try one? No?

872
01:09:56,173 --> 01:09:57,373
Pick up my cigar.

873
01:09:57,424 --> 01:09:59,824
-I'm waiting for somebody.
-You're waiting for me.

874
01:09:59,927 --> 01:10:00,927
No, I'm not.

875
01:10:00,969 --> 01:10:02,969
Why don't you let me
take you for a nice ride?

876
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,863
If you don't stop bothering me,
I'll have to call someone.

877
01:10:05,974 --> 01:10:07,974
-Hello, Cal.
-What's the matter?

878
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:11,260
I was trying to tell this gentleman
that I was waiting for somebody.

879
01:10:11,605 --> 01:10:14,405
This is a lousy place
to keep your girlfriend waiting for you.

880
01:10:14,524 --> 01:10:16,324
-Sir, it won't happen again.
-I hope not.

881
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:19,210
Lots of lousy characters around here.
Sorry, miss.

882
01:10:20,363 --> 01:10:21,563
Here I am, lady.

883
01:10:23,491 --> 01:10:25,691
That's the first time
that ever happened to me.

884
01:10:25,785 --> 01:10:28,385
-What're you doing out here?
-I'm meeting Aron.

885
01:10:28,496 --> 01:10:31,496
I thought I'd come out early
and look around.

886
01:10:31,624 --> 01:10:35,024
-You never been out here before?
-Not at night, no.

887
01:10:36,421 --> 01:10:38,221
-What time you gonna meet him?
-At 8:00.

888
01:10:38,297 --> 01:10:41,297
Thought I'd try and cheer him up.
He's been so depressed lately.

889
01:10:41,634 --> 01:10:42,634
Yeah, I know.

890
01:10:42,677 --> 01:10:44,877
I'm so glad you happened to be here.

891
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:51,810
8:00?

892
01:10:53,104 --> 01:10:54,704
You got a half hour?

893
01:10:59,568 --> 01:11:01,768
How are you, Cal?
We never see you around anymore.

894
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:03,071
I'm around.

895
01:11:03,113 --> 01:11:06,313
I've been over to the house several times,
but you were never there.

896
01:11:06,658 --> 01:11:09,858
-I never go home anymore.
-Aron says he hardly ever sees you.

897
01:11:11,246 --> 01:11:13,046
I feel awfully sorry for him.

898
01:11:18,962 --> 01:11:21,162
You're terrible.

899
01:11:21,464 --> 01:11:24,264
That's the first time
that ever happened to me, too.

900
01:11:25,427 --> 01:11:27,627
Wonder if we can see Aron from here.

901
01:11:28,763 --> 01:11:31,363
I feel awfully sorry for him.
He's right, you know.

902
01:11:31,683 --> 01:11:34,683
I mean, it's awful, the war and people
killing each other.

903
01:11:34,811 --> 01:11:37,611
Why feel sorry for Aron?
Feel sorry for the people.

904
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:40,330
But it just seems to affect him
so personally.

905
01:11:40,441 --> 01:11:42,441
I'll agree with that.

906
01:11:43,569 --> 01:11:44,769
He's right.

907
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,880
He's always right.

908
01:11:48,157 --> 01:11:50,157
And he has always been right.

909
01:11:50,242 --> 01:11:52,042
Now let's talk about something else.

910
01:11:52,119 --> 01:11:53,119
All right.

911
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:55,830
8:00.

912
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:57,690
We got a lot to see.

913
01:11:59,001 --> 01:12:01,001
Will we be back in time for Aron?

914
01:12:04,631 --> 01:12:06,231
All right. I'd love to.

915
01:12:14,016 --> 01:12:15,016
Easy.

916
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:43,066
Here's your cigar,
and where have you been hiding?

917
01:12:46,756 --> 01:12:47,956
-Who was that?
-Who?

918
01:12:48,216 --> 01:12:50,216
-That girl.
-I don't see nobody.

919
01:12:50,301 --> 01:12:53,901
She was standing right....
Girls follow you around, don't they?

920
01:12:55,723 --> 01:12:57,723
What are girls like that like?

921
01:12:58,434 --> 01:12:59,434
All right, never mind.

922
01:12:59,685 --> 01:13:02,485
These Huns have been the aggressors
in every war in Europe...

923
01:13:02,605 --> 01:13:04,005
since the time of Julius Caesar.

924
01:13:04,273 --> 01:13:07,673
I couldn't attempt to describe to you
the horrors committed by the Germans.

925
01:13:08,027 --> 01:13:09,027
Look.

926
01:13:09,069 --> 01:13:10,469
Would we have time?

927
01:13:10,946 --> 01:13:12,746
...after the Germans had been through...

928
01:13:13,031 --> 01:13:15,231
-the women of the town....
-That German's here again.

929
01:13:15,534 --> 01:13:18,534
It is not true. It is lies, all lies.

930
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:22,279
Come on, Cal. Is it scary?

931
01:13:24,918 --> 01:13:26,118
Here we go.

932
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:38,379
It is lies, all lies.

933
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:41,081
I'd like to give that guy
a piece of my mind.

934
01:13:41,601 --> 01:13:43,401
See over there. That's Castroville.

935
01:13:43,478 --> 01:13:45,078
Everything looks so small down there.

936
01:13:45,355 --> 01:13:46,955
{y:i}Higher and higher and higher and higher

937
01:13:47,231 --> 01:13:48,231
What?

938
01:13:48,274 --> 01:13:50,674
{y:i}Growing and growing
{y:i}and growing and growing

939
01:13:50,776 --> 01:13:54,576
-What are you talking about?
-I'll tell you sometime.

940
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:01,135
Does Aron really love me?

941
01:14:03,289 --> 01:14:05,289
I seem to have sort of lost him.

942
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:08,974
I mean, we're going
to be married someday, but....

943
01:14:09,336 --> 01:14:11,736
Well, if he does love me, he doesn't....

944
01:14:12,673 --> 01:14:14,273
I can't tell anymore.

945
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:19,052
Cal, can I ask you something?

946
01:14:19,972 --> 01:14:21,172
Yeah, go ahead.

947
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,500
These girls that you always
go around with.

948
01:14:25,602 --> 01:14:28,802
You know, remember there was
that little Mexican girl once.

949
01:14:29,147 --> 01:14:30,947
What are girls like that like?

950
01:14:34,986 --> 01:14:36,986
You don't really love them, do you?

951
01:14:38,948 --> 01:14:41,948
Why do you go out with them?
Is it because you're bad?

952
01:14:43,536 --> 01:14:45,336
You're not angry, are you?

953
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:51,733
-Well, why do you, then? Are you bad?
-Do you think I'm bad?

954
01:14:54,172 --> 01:14:55,572
I don't know.

955
01:14:56,882 --> 01:15:00,082
I guess I don't know
what is good and what's bad.

956
01:15:00,428 --> 01:15:02,628
I mean, Aron is so good...

957
01:15:03,139 --> 01:15:04,739
and I'm not.

958
01:15:04,807 --> 01:15:06,807
Not good enough for Aron, anyway.

959
01:15:07,101 --> 01:15:09,301
Because sometimes when I'm with Aron....

960
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:12,420
Aron likes to talk about our being in love...

961
01:15:12,523 --> 01:15:15,123
and think about it
and that's all right, but....

962
01:15:16,276 --> 01:15:19,276
These girls that you go out with, do you....

963
01:15:20,656 --> 01:15:23,256
Maybe I don't know what love is, exactly.

964
01:15:24,201 --> 01:15:27,401
I know love is good the way Aron says...

965
01:15:29,623 --> 01:15:32,023
but it's more than that, it's got to be.

966
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:36,410
I shouldn't talk to you this way...

967
01:15:36,504 --> 01:15:38,704
but I don't know who else to talk to.

968
01:15:39,424 --> 01:15:41,624
Sometimes I think I'm really bad.

969
01:15:42,969 --> 01:15:45,169
Sometimes I don't know what to think.

970
01:15:47,974 --> 01:15:50,574
-Aron'll knock that out of you.
-Will he?

971
01:15:51,936 --> 01:15:53,136
He's got to.

972
01:15:54,021 --> 01:15:56,021
The way I figure it out...

973
01:15:56,941 --> 01:15:58,941
Aron never having had a mother...

974
01:16:00,278 --> 01:16:03,078
he's made her everything good
that he can think of...

975
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:05,631
and that's what he thinks I am.

976
01:16:05,908 --> 01:16:08,508
That's who he's in love with.
It's not me at all.

977
01:16:10,287 --> 01:16:13,287
'Cause I'm not a bit like that made-up one.
Not a bit.

978
01:16:13,832 --> 01:16:16,632
I don't mean I think I'm really bad.

979
01:16:19,671 --> 01:16:21,271
Look at that star.

980
01:16:22,799 --> 01:16:24,999
It must be a planet, it's so bright.

981
01:16:26,136 --> 01:16:26,936
Probably.

982
01:16:32,392 --> 01:16:35,392
I bet that girl's waiting for you
down there somewhere.

983
01:16:37,188 --> 01:16:38,788
She can just wait.

984
01:16:39,482 --> 01:16:40,882
She was pretty.

985
01:16:45,113 --> 01:16:47,713
You've been awfully nice, Cal,
taking care of me.

986
01:17:08,677 --> 01:17:10,877
I love Aron. I do, really I do.

987
01:17:15,351 --> 01:17:16,751
I do.

988
01:17:22,858 --> 01:17:24,058
To give these fiends a lesson that....

989
01:17:24,109 --> 01:17:25,509
Have you seen Abra, Mr. Albrecht?

990
01:17:25,777 --> 01:17:26,777
Lies. All lies.

991
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:28,620
What's the matter with you tonight, Gus?

992
01:17:28,905 --> 01:17:30,505
Gus, come on.

993
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,399
There's Aron.

994
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:35,510
You're a good shoemaker.

995
01:17:37,664 --> 01:17:39,264
There's Aron, down there.

996
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:41,341
Major, why don't you stay out of politics?

997
01:17:41,626 --> 01:17:42,626
Mr. Albrecht.

998
01:17:43,712 --> 01:17:46,712
They're pushing him around.
What are they doing?

999
01:17:48,299 --> 01:17:49,899
That'd kill Dad if he knew that.

1000
01:17:50,176 --> 01:17:52,776
Hey, operator,
when does this thing move again.

1001
01:17:52,887 --> 01:17:53,887
Hey!

1002
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,280
Cal, don't!

1003
01:18:04,357 --> 01:18:06,157
Watch yourself, get back!

1004
01:18:07,693 --> 01:18:09,693
Please. Somebody pull him back.

1005
01:18:10,821 --> 01:18:12,221
Don't bother me!

1006
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:14,090
Come on.

1007
01:18:21,665 --> 01:18:24,665
-Gus, come on, have a drink.
-No, Charlie, no drink.

1008
01:18:31,258 --> 01:18:32,858
What are you waiting for?

1009
01:18:35,846 --> 01:18:38,046
Mr. Albrecht, calm down.
They're not bad fellows.

1010
01:18:38,348 --> 01:18:40,348
Aron, you are a child.

1011
01:18:45,647 --> 01:18:47,847
All I tried to do was buy him a drink.

1012
01:18:49,818 --> 01:18:50,818
Gustav.

1013
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:51,860
Silence.

1014
01:18:52,111 --> 01:18:54,711
You all loved him a few weeks ago,
what's gotten into you?

1015
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:56,831
I'm sick of him sticking up
for the Germans.

1016
01:18:57,116 --> 01:18:59,716
-You a friend of the Germans?
-I'm a friend of this German.

1017
01:18:59,827 --> 01:19:03,627
There are rose plants in that border there.
Please be careful where you step.

1018
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:06,990
We liked him. He made us laugh
because of his funny German accent.

1019
01:19:07,126 --> 01:19:09,526
Let him read this
in his funny German accent.

1020
01:19:10,254 --> 01:19:12,654
-What is it?
-Let him come down and read it.

1021
01:19:12,965 --> 01:19:15,765
-He doesn't have to read anything.
-I will read it.

1022
01:19:16,302 --> 01:19:17,702
Here, give it to me.

1023
01:19:22,975 --> 01:19:25,775
"The Government, with deep regret,
informs...

1024
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:35,950
"that your son was killed in action,
15th of April.

1025
01:19:37,364 --> 01:19:39,364
"He died a hero and an American."

1026
01:19:44,454 --> 01:19:46,654
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopps. I did not....

1027
01:19:46,957 --> 01:19:48,357
You're not sorry enough.

1028
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:51,825
-I don't think he's sorry.
-He's not sorry at all.

1029
01:19:51,961 --> 01:19:54,961
-Listen, why don't we all go on home--
-You're not sorry enough.

1030
01:19:55,298 --> 01:19:57,298
Why aren't you in the war?

1031
01:19:57,383 --> 01:19:58,983
This will make you sorry.

1032
01:20:29,289 --> 01:20:30,689
Hello, Charlie.

1033
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:33,975
Danny, what are you fellows
doing here, anyway?

1034
01:20:34,086 --> 01:20:35,086
Get up.

1035
01:20:35,754 --> 01:20:38,154
Loretta, I didn't expect to find you here.

1036
01:20:38,882 --> 01:20:40,082
Evening, Rose.

1037
01:20:41,593 --> 01:20:44,793
Looks like they messed up
your rose garden a little here, Gus.

1038
01:20:45,347 --> 01:20:47,147
Somebody owes you an apology.

1039
01:20:54,939 --> 01:20:57,939
How about you folks all going home now?

1040
01:20:58,276 --> 01:21:00,076
I think this'll do for tonight.

1041
01:21:05,575 --> 01:21:07,575
Good evening, Mrs. Albrecht.

1042
01:21:08,286 --> 01:21:09,686
-May I?
-Come in.

1043
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:17,550
This place will be fixed up
just like it was before.

1044
01:21:17,878 --> 01:21:20,878
-I'm gonna see to it.
-Ja. He will see to it.

1045
01:21:29,348 --> 01:21:30,548
Where were you?

1046
01:21:33,519 --> 01:21:35,119
Where did you get his coat?

1047
01:21:46,865 --> 01:21:48,065
You all right?

1048
01:21:49,784 --> 01:21:53,384
You had to start slugging, didn't you?
Were you showing off for her?

1049
01:21:53,955 --> 01:21:55,555
You had to start slugging.

1050
01:21:56,249 --> 01:21:59,249
-I was trying to help you.
-I don't need your help.

1051
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,620
If you want to slug people,
do it for yourself and not for me.

1052
01:22:03,756 --> 01:22:07,756
-And don't lie to me about trying to--
-Aron, I tried to help you!

1053
01:22:12,932 --> 01:22:16,332
-Great big Aron.
-You finished?

1054
01:22:17,937 --> 01:22:21,937
-No!
-Cal, stop it! Don't.

1055
01:22:22,108 --> 01:22:23,308
-Don't.
-Don't do that.

1056
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:25,759
-Don't.
-Abra, don't do that!

1057
01:22:35,454 --> 01:22:36,454
Wait here.

1058
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:17,710
I was trying to help him.

1059
01:23:20,915 --> 01:23:22,915
Who am I kidding?

1060
01:23:23,626 --> 01:23:25,226
I tried to kill him.

1061
01:23:27,796 --> 01:23:29,396
Mike, give me a drink.

1062
01:23:32,384 --> 01:23:33,984
-Don't drink any more.
-Why?

1063
01:23:34,053 --> 01:23:37,053
-No, please. It's not good for you.
-It's good for me.

1064
01:23:37,598 --> 01:23:41,598
-No, you're gonna get drunk.
-Yeah, I'm gonna get drunk.

1065
01:23:43,437 --> 01:23:46,637
Please forget it, what happened up
on the ferris wheel.

1066
01:23:46,982 --> 01:23:49,382
It didn't mean anything, really.

1067
01:23:49,484 --> 01:23:51,884
Please, forget it. It didn't mean anything.

1068
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:55,446
Say it didn't. Please, say it didn't.

1069
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:02,851
Someday he's gonna know
who his real son is.

1070
01:24:04,082 --> 01:24:05,082
What?

1071
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:08,601
Someday he's gonna know.

1072
01:24:12,006 --> 01:24:14,206
I don't understand you. You scare me.

1073
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:20,645
-I know. I scare myself.
-Abra.

1074
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:42,384
Fix me another drink.

1075
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:52,909
-I want that money. Now you give it to me.
-You know I haven't any money here.

1076
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:57,850
Okay.

1077
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:01,518
-When will you get it?
-In the morning, I suppose.

1078
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:05,289
Okay. I'll sleep here.

1079
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:09,868
Come on. You've gotta go home.

1080
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:12,188
If you still feel the same way
in the morning...

1081
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,082
you come back, we'll go to the bank...

1082
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:16,959
and I'll see that you get everything
that's coming to you.

1083
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:20,470
I'll buy out your share.
I'll go on and make a fortune with it.

1084
01:25:21,657 --> 01:25:25,857
Okay. That seems fair to me, Will.

1085
01:25:52,729 --> 01:25:53,529
Abra.

1086
01:25:57,109 --> 01:25:58,509
What?

1087
01:26:00,028 --> 01:26:01,228
-Who is it?
-Cal.

1088
01:26:03,573 --> 01:26:04,773
-Cal?
-Yeah.

1089
01:26:06,284 --> 01:26:09,284
-What on earth are you doing here?
-I want to see you.

1090
01:26:10,455 --> 01:26:12,455
Wait till I put something on.

1091
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,900
I gotta tell you something.
Can you keep a secret?

1092
01:26:34,645 --> 01:26:36,645
Yes. What is it?

1093
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:40,790
What's the matter? You look terrible.

1094
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:46,238
-I got it.
-What?

1095
01:26:49,451 --> 01:26:52,651
Remember that money? Dad lost?

1096
01:26:52,996 --> 01:26:54,596
On that lettuce business?

1097
01:26:57,376 --> 01:27:00,976
-I got it.
-You mean you earned it all back?

1098
01:27:01,129 --> 01:27:03,929
-I've earned every cent.
-That's wonderful, Cal.

1099
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:11,419
You got any time off tomorrow
from the hospital?

1100
01:27:13,433 --> 01:27:15,433
I get an hour at lunchtime. Why?

1101
01:27:16,352 --> 01:27:18,152
Thursday's Dad's birthday.

1102
01:27:21,357 --> 01:27:23,357
And I'm gonna give a party for him.

1103
01:27:26,571 --> 01:27:31,171
And I want you and me,
you and Aron and me...

1104
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:33,810
to be there.

1105
01:27:36,163 --> 01:27:39,563
I'm gonna give him that money
just like it was a birthday present.

1106
01:27:40,334 --> 01:27:42,934
You could come
and help me get some junk...

1107
01:27:43,253 --> 01:27:45,853
-and we could decorate the house.
-Sure.

1108
01:27:47,424 --> 01:27:49,624
And we'll get balloons...

1109
01:27:52,429 --> 01:27:56,429
-and all that kid stuff, birthday stuff.
-We can go to the five and 10.

1110
01:27:59,311 --> 01:28:01,511
-Will you do it?
-I'd like to.

1111
01:28:18,496 --> 01:28:21,096
I'm sort of....

1112
01:28:28,714 --> 01:28:30,114
Why did I hit Aron?

1113
01:28:32,885 --> 01:28:35,085
Why did I hit him so hard?

1114
01:28:46,649 --> 01:28:49,049
Will you help me?

1115
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,560
Will you really help me?

1116
01:28:53,947 --> 01:28:55,347
I'll help you, Cal.

1117
01:29:00,412 --> 01:29:01,412
Be careful.

1118
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:07,442
How'd I get up here?

1119
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:21,980
-Is your father coming?
-Yeah.

1120
01:29:22,308 --> 01:29:25,108
-Cal, don't get nervous.
-I think it looks beautiful.

1121
01:29:25,853 --> 01:29:27,453
Don't you? I love the way it looks.

1122
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:29,930
-It looks festive, doesn't it?
-Yes, it does.

1123
01:29:30,024 --> 01:29:31,624
Yes, Cal, it looks very pretty.

1124
01:29:31,692 --> 01:29:34,092
-Do you think this is childish?
-Not a bit.

1125
01:29:34,195 --> 01:29:37,195
The room looks lovely.
Your father's going to love it.

1126
01:29:38,366 --> 01:29:40,566
-How's the turkey?
-It's a good turkey.

1127
01:29:40,659 --> 01:29:42,859
-Smells ready.
-lt'll be ready.

1128
01:29:42,953 --> 01:29:46,153
-Aron didn't get him anything?
-He told me he had something.

1129
01:29:55,048 --> 01:29:57,648
-What?
-He didn't tell me what it was.

1130
01:30:05,684 --> 01:30:08,284
-It won't stack up against mine, will it?
-No.

1131
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:10,620
-Do you wanna see mine?
-I'd like to.

1132
01:30:10,689 --> 01:30:12,289
-I got it wrapped up.
-Show it to me.

1133
01:30:12,566 --> 01:30:13,566
-Wanna see it?
-Yes.

1134
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:14,608
Okay.

1135
01:30:16,945 --> 01:30:18,345
-You like it?
-It's pretty.

1136
01:30:18,405 --> 01:30:20,005
You think it's pretty?

1137
01:30:21,741 --> 01:30:23,341
Don't drink any more wine.

1138
01:30:26,955 --> 01:30:29,955
-Did Aron tell you what the present was?
-No.

1139
01:30:31,334 --> 01:30:34,134
-You sure?
-Honestly, he didn't.

1140
01:30:34,879 --> 01:30:37,279
I'd tell you if he did. Honestly, I would.

1141
01:30:38,633 --> 01:30:41,833
Now everything's gonna go off fine. Here.

1142
01:30:43,637 --> 01:30:45,037
The brooms.

1143
01:30:45,514 --> 01:30:48,114
-Don't you do anything to give me away.
-I wouldn't.

1144
01:30:48,225 --> 01:30:50,825
We'll let him come in
and let the house speak for itself.

1145
01:30:50,936 --> 01:30:54,936
-We'll act like it was any other old day.
-Yes. Wait, Cal.

1146
01:30:57,609 --> 01:30:58,809
Cal.

1147
01:31:03,657 --> 01:31:05,257
You look wonderful.

1148
01:31:06,993 --> 01:31:07,993
Thanks.

1149
01:31:18,254 --> 01:31:19,854
But I need my son.

1150
01:31:19,923 --> 01:31:22,923
It isn't that he doesn't want
to fight for his country. He does.

1151
01:31:23,259 --> 01:31:24,459
I need him to work the farm.

1152
01:31:24,511 --> 01:31:26,911
Things can't be as bad as you say,
Mr. Piscora.

1153
01:31:27,013 --> 01:31:29,413
You must be making plenty of money
out of your crops.

1154
01:31:29,724 --> 01:31:33,124
No money. I sold this year's crop
for 5 cents before I even planted it.

1155
01:31:33,269 --> 01:31:34,469
Everything cost so much now.

1156
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,120
And now I got to sell next year crop.
So I need my boy.

1157
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,240
I can do nothing about it, Mr. Piscora.

1158
01:31:39,525 --> 01:31:41,725
In all conscience,
I cannot excuse your son.

1159
01:31:42,028 --> 01:31:44,828
-Come on, Poppa.
-I don't like it.

1160
01:31:45,781 --> 01:31:48,381
I'm telling you. I don't like it.

1161
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,880
Hello, Abra. Nice to see you.

1162
01:31:55,165 --> 01:31:58,165
-Gonna stay to dinner?
-Yes, I am. Is something the matter?

1163
01:31:58,502 --> 01:32:02,302
No, nothing. I guess I shouldn't
have taken that job in the Draft Board.

1164
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:05,890
-Did you notice the snow on Mount Toro?
-Yes, I saw it.

1165
01:32:06,009 --> 01:32:08,409
Say, that means we got
a good year coming in.

1166
01:32:08,512 --> 01:32:11,912
-We could use it.
-Let's go in.

1167
01:32:32,702 --> 01:32:35,102
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Happy birthday, Mr. Trask.

1168
01:32:35,204 --> 01:32:37,804
Is it possible? I'm very touched.

1169
01:32:37,915 --> 01:32:41,115
-Are you surprised?
-I had no idea. I'd forgotten completely.

1170
01:32:41,252 --> 01:32:45,052
-We knew you had, didn't we?
-Completely. I don't know what to say.

1171
01:32:48,968 --> 01:32:50,568
We got turkey.

1172
01:32:50,845 --> 01:32:54,245
-And champagne.
-Champagne, and we got all the things.

1173
01:32:57,309 --> 01:32:59,709
-We got the trimmings here.
-Isn't that pretty?

1174
01:33:05,025 --> 01:33:08,025
Got something for you.

1175
01:33:08,153 --> 01:33:11,153
Presents, too. Isn't that nice. Look.

1176
01:33:16,077 --> 01:33:18,477
-Ain't you gonna open it up?
-Yes.

1177
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:22,780
Dad, Abra and I have one for you, too,
only we can't exactly give it to you.

1178
01:33:24,627 --> 01:33:28,027
I didn't tell Abra I was going to do this,
but we're engaged.

1179
01:33:31,718 --> 01:33:34,518
I couldn't have wished for anything nicer.

1180
01:33:36,097 --> 01:33:38,897
A lovely birthday present.

1181
01:33:40,268 --> 01:33:42,468
-You have my blessings.
-Thank you, Dad.

1182
01:33:44,021 --> 01:33:46,621
-But you haven't opened Cal's present yet.
-No.

1183
01:33:49,026 --> 01:33:51,826
But I can't imagine having
anything better than this.

1184
01:33:53,197 --> 01:33:54,197
Excuse me.

1185
01:33:55,699 --> 01:33:59,899
'Course I suspected it right along.
But, Cal, coming on my birthday.

1186
01:34:04,249 --> 01:34:05,449
What's this?

1187
01:34:07,586 --> 01:34:08,986
What is this?

1188
01:34:12,174 --> 01:34:16,374
I made it. And it's for you.
It's all the money you lost on the lettuce.

1189
01:34:16,553 --> 01:34:18,753
You made it? But how?

1190
01:34:21,141 --> 01:34:22,141
Go on.

1191
01:34:23,852 --> 01:34:25,052
-Beans.
-Beans?

1192
01:34:26,771 --> 01:34:29,971
Yes, we bought futures at 5 cents...

1193
01:34:30,733 --> 01:34:35,333
and the war came along
and the price went sky-high.

1194
01:34:36,781 --> 01:34:39,981
So, that's for you.

1195
01:34:41,369 --> 01:34:44,169
It's all the money you lost
in the lettuce business.

1196
01:34:45,748 --> 01:34:46,948
It's for you.

1197
01:34:48,876 --> 01:34:51,676
-I made it for you.
-You will have to give it back.

1198
01:34:54,298 --> 01:34:59,098
No, I made it for you, Dad.
I want you to have it.

1199
01:34:59,929 --> 01:35:03,129
-You will have to give it back.
-Who? I can't give it--

1200
01:35:03,265 --> 01:35:06,865
-To the people you got it from.
-No, the British Purchasing Agency?

1201
01:35:07,019 --> 01:35:09,819
-I can't give it back.
-Give it to the farmers you robbed.

1202
01:35:09,938 --> 01:35:11,538
We didn't rob anybody, Dad.

1203
01:35:11,607 --> 01:35:15,407
We paid 2 cents a pound,
2 cents over market for that stuff.

1204
01:35:16,403 --> 01:35:19,803
I sign my name
and boys go out and some die...

1205
01:35:20,365 --> 01:35:22,565
and some live helpless
without arms and legs.

1206
01:35:22,868 --> 01:35:24,668
Not one will come back untorn.

1207
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:28,170
Do you think I could take
a profit from that?

1208
01:35:30,792 --> 01:35:33,392
I don't want the money, Cal!
I couldn't take it!

1209
01:35:34,129 --> 01:35:36,929
-I thank you for the thought, but--
-I'll keep it for you.

1210
01:35:37,048 --> 01:35:39,848
I'll wrap it up
and we'll just keep it in here--

1211
01:35:39,968 --> 01:35:41,368
I'll never take it!

1212
01:35:41,636 --> 01:35:44,836
Son, I'd be happy if you'd give me...

1213
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:47,972
something like your brother's given me.

1214
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:51,900
Something honest and human and good.
Don't be angry, Son.

1215
01:35:52,897 --> 01:35:55,897
If you want to give me a present,
give me a good life.

1216
01:35:56,025 --> 01:35:58,025
That's something I could value.

1217
01:36:26,888 --> 01:36:28,288
I hate you!

1218
01:36:46,491 --> 01:36:48,091
What are you doing?

1219
01:36:54,624 --> 01:36:56,624
He doesn't want anything from me.

1220
01:36:57,126 --> 01:36:58,526
Cal, don't.

1221
01:37:01,297 --> 01:37:02,297
Please, don't.

1222
01:37:11,515 --> 01:37:12,515
Abra!

1223
01:37:34,245 --> 01:37:36,245
Don't you ever touch her again.

1224
01:37:39,042 --> 01:37:40,442
I don't trust you.

1225
01:37:43,421 --> 01:37:44,621
You're no good.

1226
01:37:45,506 --> 01:37:49,506
You're mean and vicious and wild.
And you always have been.

1227
01:37:50,094 --> 01:37:51,894
You know it, too, don't you?

1228
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:54,580
Father and I have put up
with every vicious thing...

1229
01:37:54,891 --> 01:37:58,891
you could think of since you were a child.
And we've always forgiven you.

1230
01:37:59,687 --> 01:38:01,887
But now I don't want you to go near Abra.

1231
01:38:01,981 --> 01:38:05,181
I don't want you to talk with her.
Just stay away from her!

1232
01:38:33,053 --> 01:38:35,853
-You want to go some place with me?
-Why should I?

1233
01:38:39,309 --> 01:38:41,109
I got something to show you.

1234
01:38:42,645 --> 01:38:46,245
-Think you'll find it very interesting.
-What are you talking about?

1235
01:38:47,650 --> 01:38:50,850
Maybe our mother didn't die
and go to heaven after all, Aron.

1236
01:38:51,612 --> 01:38:54,412
-What do you mean by that?
-Maybe she didn't.

1237
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:56,540
Maybe she's alive someplace.

1238
01:38:58,703 --> 01:39:00,303
What are you up to now?

1239
01:39:00,371 --> 01:39:03,771
Remember when we were kids,
we used to make up stories about her?

1240
01:39:04,542 --> 01:39:09,142
You said she must have looked
like heaven's youngest angel, remember?

1241
01:39:10,589 --> 01:39:12,789
Remember that time I shot that rabbit?

1242
01:39:13,509 --> 01:39:15,509
You cried and you said...

1243
01:39:15,594 --> 01:39:18,594
that she would have cried, too,
'cause she was so tenderhearted.

1244
01:39:18,931 --> 01:39:21,531
And you said I was bad,
you remember that?

1245
01:39:22,684 --> 01:39:26,084
I just want to show you something.
It's not gonna take very long.

1246
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:27,629
What's the matter, you afraid?

1247
01:39:27,689 --> 01:39:30,089
I'm not afraid to look at anything
you could show me.

1248
01:39:30,192 --> 01:39:34,192
Can you look at the truth, just once?

1249
01:39:36,865 --> 01:39:41,065
Come on, you can look
at the truth just once. Can't you?

1250
01:39:42,912 --> 01:39:43,912
Come on.

1251
01:39:45,623 --> 01:39:48,623
I want to show you something.
It won't take very long.

1252
01:40:23,785 --> 01:40:24,985
Oh, Cal.

1253
01:40:27,331 --> 01:40:28,131
Hello.

1254
01:40:52,772 --> 01:40:57,172
Mother, this is your other son, Aron.

1255
01:40:59,445 --> 01:41:01,645
Aron is everything that's good, Mother.

1256
01:41:10,706 --> 01:41:12,506
Say hello to your mother.

1257
01:41:27,389 --> 01:41:29,189
Say hello to your mother, Aron!

1258
01:41:30,517 --> 01:41:32,717
Joe!

1259
01:41:44,906 --> 01:41:46,706
-Play another song!
-Quiet!

1260
01:41:49,494 --> 01:41:50,494
Five!

1261
01:41:50,954 --> 01:41:54,754
"I'm thinking of the lilac trees
that shook their purple plumes

1262
01:41:55,959 --> 01:41:59,159
"I'm thinking of the rivulet
with its cool and silvery flow

1263
01:41:59,712 --> 01:42:03,712
"Of the old gray rock that shadowed it
and the peppermint below"

1264
01:42:09,722 --> 01:42:12,922
-Where is Aron?
-I don't know. I'm not my brother's keeper.

1265
01:42:13,059 --> 01:42:14,659
-Where did you go?
-For a ride.

1266
01:42:14,935 --> 01:42:16,935
-What did you quarrel about?
-You.

1267
01:42:17,438 --> 01:42:20,238
-You're angry about the money.
-No, I'm not angry.

1268
01:42:20,566 --> 01:42:22,366
I like it. I think it's great.

1269
01:42:23,277 --> 01:42:25,277
I'm gonna go away
and take that money with me.

1270
01:42:25,571 --> 01:42:28,971
I think I'll start me a little business.
Just like my mother did.

1271
01:42:29,116 --> 01:42:33,116
-What do you know about your mother?
-I know where she is and what she is.

1272
01:42:33,287 --> 01:42:36,087
And I know why she left you.
Couldn't stand it.

1273
01:42:36,623 --> 01:42:39,423
You didn't really love her
any more than you do me.

1274
01:42:40,168 --> 01:42:42,768
Because of your goodness, your rightness.

1275
01:42:42,879 --> 01:42:45,479
You never gave either one of us
an inch, ever...

1276
01:42:45,799 --> 01:42:47,399
from what you thought was right.

1277
01:42:47,676 --> 01:42:51,476
You kept on forgiving us,
but you never really loved us.

1278
01:42:52,472 --> 01:42:54,472
I know why you didn't love me.

1279
01:42:54,557 --> 01:42:55,957
Because I'm like my mother...

1280
01:42:56,017 --> 01:42:59,017
and you never forgave yourself
for having loved her.

1281
01:43:01,230 --> 01:43:05,030
I'm not gonna forgive him.
I'm never gonna forgive him.

1282
01:43:05,401 --> 01:43:09,801
-Where is Aron?
-He's with her, with his mother.

1283
01:43:10,823 --> 01:43:13,223
She's over there in Monterey,
if you want to know.

1284
01:43:13,326 --> 01:43:15,126
She owns one of them houses.

1285
01:43:16,662 --> 01:43:19,262
I took Aron there tonight
because I was jealous.

1286
01:43:20,416 --> 01:43:24,416
I've been jealous all my life.
Jealous, I couldn't even stand it.

1287
01:43:29,174 --> 01:43:31,374
Tonight, I even tried to buy your love.

1288
01:43:33,554 --> 01:43:35,554
But now I don't want it anymore.

1289
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:41,950
-I can't use it anymore.
-Don't talk to your father like that.

1290
01:43:45,857 --> 01:43:48,057
I don't want any kind of love anymore.

1291
01:43:50,028 --> 01:43:51,628
It doesn't pay off.

1292
01:43:52,113 --> 01:43:53,913
No future in it.

1293
01:43:56,493 --> 01:43:58,093
Let him go if he wants to.

1294
01:44:03,374 --> 01:44:04,974
No, I won't.

1295
01:44:17,972 --> 01:44:19,772
You hate me, too, don't you?

1296
01:44:21,308 --> 01:44:22,708
I'm afraid of you.

1297
01:44:27,773 --> 01:44:31,373
What you did to Aron tonight,
I don't know what it will do to him.

1298
01:44:34,029 --> 01:44:36,429
I feel like I'm to blame, too.

1299
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:43,000
-Adam!
-Here. What is it?

1300
01:44:43,205 --> 01:44:46,005
...drunk and had a couple of fights.
He's gone kind of crazy.

1301
01:44:46,333 --> 01:44:49,133
He's at the station now.
Wait, I'll drive you down in my car.

1302
01:44:49,252 --> 01:44:50,252
Cal!

1303
01:44:57,177 --> 01:44:59,777
-What happened between you and Aron?
-Why?

1304
01:44:59,888 --> 01:45:02,888
He's gone kind of crazy.
He's drunk and had a couple of fights...

1305
01:45:03,224 --> 01:45:05,224
and seemed determined
to get himself hurt.

1306
01:45:05,518 --> 01:45:07,318
He's leaving on that troop train tonight...

1307
01:45:07,603 --> 01:45:10,003
and says he's gonna enlist tomorrow
at King City.

1308
01:45:10,106 --> 01:45:13,506
Adam's on his way down there now
to talk to him before the train leaves.

1309
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:16,060
I think you better get down there.

1310
01:45:17,405 --> 01:45:19,205
-Yeah.
-My car's downstairs.

1311
01:46:18,297 --> 01:46:20,497
Do you know what a stroke is, exactly?

1312
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:27,970
This one is a leakage of blood in the brain
caused by shock.

1313
01:46:28,307 --> 01:46:30,307
There have been earlier, smaller leakages.

1314
01:46:30,601 --> 01:46:33,401
The left side is paralyzed,
and the right side partly.

1315
01:46:34,146 --> 01:46:36,746
In other words,
your father is nearly helpless.

1316
01:46:38,108 --> 01:46:41,108
-Will he die?
-He might live a week or a year.

1317
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:43,470
He might die tonight.

1318
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:53,820
-Will he know me?
-You'll have to find that out for yourself.

1319
01:46:58,545 --> 01:46:59,945
Good day.

1320
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:05,490
Good day, Doctor. Good day, Sam.

1321
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:10,520
"Cain rose up against his brother Abel,
and slew him.

1322
01:47:11,057 --> 01:47:15,057
"And Cain went away and dwelt
in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."

1323
01:47:17,313 --> 01:47:19,913
Now why don't you go away some place?

1324
01:47:34,413 --> 01:47:37,213
-He's right.
-No.

1325
01:47:39,209 --> 01:47:41,809
Yes, he is. He's right. That's what I'll do.

1326
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:54,130
Who's gonna wash these things for me?

1327
01:47:56,101 --> 01:47:57,101
Thank you.

1328
01:47:59,437 --> 01:48:01,437
-There you are.
-How is he?

1329
01:48:01,523 --> 01:48:04,323
He's fine. He's my darling.

1330
01:48:04,651 --> 01:48:06,451
Washed his face, combed his hair.

1331
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:08,128
Can I go in there now?

1332
01:48:08,613 --> 01:48:12,013
Just for a minute. I want him to rest.
Gotta get lots of sleep.

1333
01:48:14,035 --> 01:48:17,635
-How is he, really?
-Haven't I seen you at the hospital?

1334
01:48:18,623 --> 01:48:20,623
-Not part of the family, are you?
-No.

1335
01:48:20,917 --> 01:48:22,117
I didn't think so.

1336
01:48:22,376 --> 01:48:25,376
I can tell you,
I won't have this job for long.

1337
01:48:25,713 --> 01:48:29,713
That's my luck. Always seem to get them
when they're old and ready to die off.

1338
01:48:44,481 --> 01:48:48,481
Now doesn't he look nice?
He's going to be a darling patient.

1339
01:48:49,278 --> 01:48:51,878
Even tried to smile at me,
didn't you, my dear?

1340
01:48:52,823 --> 01:48:55,023
-I don't want you to tire my patient.
-Please go.

1341
01:48:55,117 --> 01:48:58,117
Now listen, miss,
don't you try to order me about.

1342
01:48:59,079 --> 01:49:00,879
I'll report you to the doctor.

1343
01:49:01,164 --> 01:49:03,764
Will you go out of the room
and shut the door?

1344
01:49:39,326 --> 01:49:40,326
Father.

1345
01:49:43,706 --> 01:49:45,106
Can you hear me?

1346
01:49:50,796 --> 01:49:52,596
I did an awful thing.

1347
01:49:56,843 --> 01:49:57,843
I'm sorry.

1348
01:50:32,503 --> 01:50:34,503
Mr. Trask, can you hear me?

1349
01:50:35,631 --> 01:50:38,431
Is it just Cal you won't answer?

1350
01:50:38,968 --> 01:50:40,368
Can you answer?

1351
01:50:42,721 --> 01:50:44,921
I think you can understand me, though.

1352
01:50:45,849 --> 01:50:49,449
I think behind your eyes
you're just as alert as ever.

1353
01:50:50,646 --> 01:50:53,646
You understand everything I say
only you can't show it.

1354
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:05,090
Excuse me, Mr. Trask,
for daring to speak to you this way...

1355
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:09,860
but it's awful not to be loved.
It's the worst thing in the world.

1356
01:51:12,125 --> 01:51:14,525
Don't ask me how I know that.
I just know it.

1357
01:51:15,044 --> 01:51:18,644
It makes you mean and violent and cruel.

1358
01:51:18,798 --> 01:51:21,598
And that's the way
Cal has always felt, all his life.

1359
01:51:22,969 --> 01:51:25,969
I know you didn't mean it to be that way,
but it's true.

1360
01:51:27,974 --> 01:51:32,574
You never gave him your love.
You never asked him for his.

1361
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:36,021
You never asked him for one thing.

1362
01:51:37,149 --> 01:51:40,749
Cal is going away, Mr. Trask.
But before he goes....

1363
01:51:43,197 --> 01:51:47,197
He did something very bad,
and I'm not asking you to forgive him.

1364
01:51:47,785 --> 01:51:50,585
You have to give him some sign
that you love him...

1365
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:52,713
or else he'll never be a man.

1366
01:51:53,624 --> 01:51:57,624
He'll just keep on feeling guilty
and alone, unless you release him.

1367
01:51:59,463 --> 01:52:00,863
Please, help him.

1368
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:04,940
I love Cal, Mr. Trask,
and I want him to be whole and strong...

1369
01:52:05,093 --> 01:52:07,693
and you're the only one who can do it.

1370
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:09,604
So try, please try.

1371
01:52:11,766 --> 01:52:14,766
If you could ask him for something.

1372
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:18,529
Let him help you so that he knows
that you love him.

1373
01:52:19,482 --> 01:52:21,082
Let him do for you.

1374
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:29,496
Excuse me, Mr. Trask, for daring
to speak to you this way, but I just had to.

1375
01:52:35,331 --> 01:52:36,531
You've tired my patient...

1376
01:52:36,582 --> 01:52:39,982
and I most certainly shall report it
to the doctor in the morning.

1377
01:52:42,421 --> 01:52:46,221
You don't know that he accuses you.
You don't know what he's thinking about.

1378
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:49,392
Stop it, Cal.
You gonna cry for the rest of your life?

1379
01:52:49,511 --> 01:52:50,911
-No.
-Then stop it.

1380
01:52:51,805 --> 01:52:54,805
Go in there and talk to him
before it's too late.

1381
01:52:55,142 --> 01:52:57,742
-I can't.
-Please try.

1382
01:52:58,687 --> 01:52:59,887
Get it straight.

1383
01:53:00,981 --> 01:53:04,981
Get through to him, somehow.
Please try, Cal, before it's too late.

1384
01:53:11,825 --> 01:53:15,625
-Is there any coffee around here?
-I'll get you some in a minute.

1385
01:53:21,626 --> 01:53:22,626
Try.

1386
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:26,120
Is there anything to read around here?

1387
01:53:27,674 --> 01:53:29,074
What would you like?

1388
01:53:29,342 --> 01:53:33,142
-Something to get my mind off my feet.
-There's something in there.

1389
01:53:48,527 --> 01:53:52,127
I tried to believe it was born in me...

1390
01:53:52,281 --> 01:53:55,881
and that I couldn't help it,
but that's not so.

1391
01:53:58,328 --> 01:53:59,728
A man has a choice.

1392
01:54:00,205 --> 01:54:03,005
You used to say that was where
he was different from an animal.

1393
01:54:03,333 --> 01:54:04,733
You see, I remember.

1394
01:54:05,002 --> 01:54:08,602
A man has a choice,
and the choice is what makes him a man.

1395
01:54:11,049 --> 01:54:12,649
You see, I do remember.

1396
01:54:13,134 --> 01:54:16,734
-Look, I can't find any coffee.
-Get out!

1397
01:54:27,732 --> 01:54:28,532
Look.

1398
01:54:36,908 --> 01:54:40,108
Do something...

1399
01:54:42,538 --> 01:54:43,538
for me.

1400
01:54:43,789 --> 01:54:44,989
Yes.

1401
01:54:49,211 --> 01:54:52,011
That woman...

1402
01:54:52,756 --> 01:54:56,956
the nurse, can't stand her.

1403
01:54:59,430 --> 01:55:01,030
Get me another.

1404
01:55:16,947 --> 01:55:18,947
I can't stand her, either.

1405
01:56:11,375 --> 01:56:12,575
What did he say?

1406
01:56:19,507 --> 01:56:22,707
He said, "Don't get anybody else."

1407
01:56:24,304 --> 01:56:26,904
He said, "You stay with me...

1408
01:56:28,266 --> 01:56:30,066
"and you take care of me."
