1
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,348
Nice fat deposit.
You're sure in the right business, Sally.

2
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,579
Thank you.

3
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,026
Good morning.

4
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,385
Deposit.

5
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,585
Another nice deposit.

6
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:48,662
You and Sally are sure
in the right business.

7
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,263
I'm in a hurry, please.

8
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,060
Hi, Kate.

9
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:18,547
Have you cleaned up the house
across the way?

10
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:19,984
I haven't had time yet.

11
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:22,141
You should always do that one first.

12
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:30,867
Anne!

13
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:38,061
Come here.

14
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:44,666
Did you ever see that kid out there before?

15
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,148
I think maybe he was in the bar last night.

16
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:48,381
Send Joe in.

17
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:50,467
Joe.

18
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:57,590
Hello, Pretty Boy.

19
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:05,783
- Call me, Kate?
- Yeah. Take a look out the window.

20
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:09,546
There's a kid who's been following me
all the way to the bank and back.

21
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:36,301
Come here, you young squirt, come here.

22
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:41,621
- You want me?
- What's the idea of throwing that stone?

23
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,748
Any law against throwing stones?

24
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,428
You're tough? Come here!

25
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:53,586
What are you hanging around here for,
anyway?

26
00:08:55,592 --> 00:08:57,310
- Would she talk to me?
- Kate?

27
00:08:58,032 --> 00:09:00,593
What for? What do you want?

28
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:05,388
Just wanna talk to her.

29
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:08,665
- What do you want, you?
- Nothing.

30
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:12,026
You live around here?

31
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:15,866
- In Monterey?
- Salinas.

32
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:17,227
What's your name?

33
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:20,951
You're not talking? Now, look...

34
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:23,068
why are you following Kate around?

35
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:24,861
What's the idea, squirt?

36
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:27,786
Any law against following
around the town...

37
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:30,671
madam, whatever you call her?

38
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:33,870
I don't know if there's any law against it,
but she don't like it.

39
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:36,069
She owns that house over there, too,
don't she?

40
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:39,384
But don't you go hanging
around there, squirt. You're too young.

41
00:09:39,473 --> 00:09:41,703
Now come on. Now beat it.

42
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:43,465
Is that her real name?

43
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:49,185
- Kate. Is that her real name?
- Sure, as far as I know. Why?

44
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:52,151
What's her last name?

45
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:54,912
Nobody's got any last name
around here, kid. Why?

46
00:09:58,993 --> 00:10:01,905
You tell her I hate her.

47
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,348
I should have gone right on in there.

48
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,583
Should have gone right on in there
and talked to her.

49
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:55,667
Cal wasn't home all night.
Boy, is he gonna catch it from Dad.

50
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:58,268
- You know what the girls in class call him?
- No, what?

51
00:10:58,354 --> 00:10:59,911
The Prowler.

52
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,905
- I'll tell him that.
- You better not, Aron.

53
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,313
- Promise me you won't.
- Why not?

54
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:05,589
Please don't. I don't want you...

55
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:08,512
- Hi, Cal.
- Hi.

56
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:10,073
Hello, Cal.

57
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,153
Excuse me for talking.

58
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:14,907
We're going down to see the icehouse
that Dad's gonna buy.

59
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:16,552
- Do you want to come?
- What icehouse?

60
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,829
The one he's buying
to freeze the vegetables with.

61
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:21,553
He's been talking about it every night
for the last week.

62
00:11:21,634 --> 00:11:22,828
Is Dad gonna be there?

63
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:24,870
Why sure, he's gonna buy it.

64
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,187
I'll skip it.

65
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:31,064
You're gonna have
to see him sometime, Cal.

66
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:33,873
- Come on.
- Hey, Aron.

67
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:34,864
Yeah?

68
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:38,824
- Why don't you ask me where I've been?
- Would you tell me?

69
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:42,148
- No.
- Then what's the use of my asking?

70
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:47,145
- Is Dad mad at me?
- Well, you were out all night.

71
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:49,305
He was worried.

72
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:51,468
Yeah, I bet.

73
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:55,146
You gonna come or not?

74
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:00,069
Okay. I'll see you at supper.

75
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:01,509
He's coming.

76
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:04,187
He's coming.

77
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:13,349
You see, Will, I got the idea
from an article I read.

78
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,995
They dug up a mastodon
somewhere in Siberia.

79
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:19,430
Been in the ice for thousands of years
and the meat was still good.

80
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:20,425
Mastodon?

81
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:27,664
What have you got to say for yourself?

82
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:32,706
This is my son, Cal.

83
00:12:33,715 --> 00:12:36,593
When you were his age,
I imagine you thought it only right...

84
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:39,189
to let your father know
before you stayed out all night.

85
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:42,790
Or at least to offer some kind
of apology when you did come home.

86
00:12:43,035 --> 00:12:44,674
Well, times change.

87
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:49,111
As I was saying,
a mastodon is a kind of elephant.

88
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:51,265
Hasn't lived on the Earth for a long while.

89
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:54,393
- And the meat was still fresh?
- Sweet as a pork chop.

90
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:57,751
You're more excited about this
than you've been for a long time.

91
00:12:57,836 --> 00:12:59,507
Now, I seem to be, don't I?

92
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:02,553
See, Will, I've been sort of
in a rut out there in the ranch.

93
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:06,230
- Sixteen, 17 years, I've kept out of things.
- I know.

94
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:09,547
But now I feel that
if I could only do something...

95
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:14,232
some little thing for, before I die,
some little thing for progress...

96
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:16,950
for people, maybe.
Call it anything you want.

97
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:20,186
I might make up for all the years
I've been lying fallow.

98
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:24,064
So, lately I've been reading up all I can
about refrigeration.

99
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:27,591
And I can't get it out of my head
that you can keep anything good...

100
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:31,190
as long as you can get it cold enough.
Like that mastodon there.

101
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:33,506
- Good afternoon, Abra.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Trask.

102
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:34,823
- Hello, Mr. Hamilton.
- Hello.

103
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,031
- Hello, Son.
- Hi, Dad.

104
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:40,109
Now my son, Aron, that is,
thinks I may have a good idea here.

105
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,187
Dad wrapped a head of lettuce
in wax paper...

106
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:44,425
and kept it in our icebox
for over three weeks...

107
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:46,427
and it still came out fresh and good.
Right?

108
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:47,551
Quite right, Son.

109
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:51,708
- Dad, is it all right if we look around?
- 'Course, Aron. Belongs to us now.

110
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:56,507
Do you know where the biggest market
for vegetables is in the winter?

111
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:58,268
- Where?
- New York City.

112
00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:00,153
And they can't raise them there.

113
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:02,909
But the railroad had promised me
those fruit cars.

114
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:07,030
Don't you have anything to say to me, Cal?

115
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:09,232
- Yeah.
- It's about time. Well?

116
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:13,753
I read in the Monterey newspaper...

117
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:16,669
that if we get into this war...

118
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,350
there are gonna be some fortunes made.

119
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:23,874
But you're gonna make them
in beans and corn, and stuff like that.

120
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:27,677
- You don't need all this ice.
- You're perfectly right.

121
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:29,270
Beans are up to 3 cents.

122
00:14:29,356 --> 00:14:31,233
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

123
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:33,228
And they keep, too, don't they?

124
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:36,467
But I'm not particularly interested
in making a profit, Cal.

125
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:43,676
Look here, Will.

126
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:46,589
I'm not an inventor nor a scientist...

127
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:48,746
but I know I have an idea here.

128
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:52,351
I come from a whole family of inventors.
People full of ideas like this one.

129
00:14:52,437 --> 00:14:54,428
I'm the only one that didn't have an idea...

130
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:56,188
and the only one that ever made a dime.

131
00:14:56,277 --> 00:14:58,346
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

132
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:01,315
Put out that cigarette!
That place is full of sawdust!

133
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:08,868
- Come on, Adam, he's just thoughtless.
- Thoughtless? He's inconsiderate.

134
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:11,425
I don't know.
I'm at my rope's end with that boy.

135
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:13,314
I don't understand him. I never have.

136
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:16,036
Aron I've understood since he was a child.

137
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:21,106
Help me up.

138
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:27,306
- He doesn't like anybody, does he?
- Who, Dad?

139
00:15:27,397 --> 00:15:28,955
No, Cal.

140
00:15:29,957 --> 00:15:31,595
It's dark in here and spooky.

141
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:34,389
Why is he so alone all the time?

142
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:37,514
- He wants to be.
- Nobody wants to be alone all the time.

143
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:40,555
Dad's made a wonderful buy, hasn't he?
We'll freeze vegetables.

144
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:42,787
It'll really give him something
to live for now.

145
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:45,755
What's the matter, Abra,
don't you like Cal?

146
00:15:45,838 --> 00:15:48,146
- I guess I don't know him very well.
- I love him.

147
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:51,548
Well, naturally, he's your brother.
He's scary.

148
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,194
- Scary?
- When he looks at you.

149
00:15:54,677 --> 00:15:56,554
Sort of like an animal.

150
00:15:56,637 --> 00:15:58,355
I don't know, he scares me.

151
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:01,636
Aron, when are we gonna get married?

152
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:05,429
Just as soon as I get through
with that darned school.

153
00:16:06,238 --> 00:16:07,876
I wish it was right now.

154
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:11,469
- So do I.
- Do you?

155
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:21,828
Abra.

156
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:23,316
- When we get...
- I love you, Aron.

157
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,866
When we get married,
it's going to be perfect.

158
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:28,672
Everything about it is going to be perfect.

159
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:55,752
You're gonna make
a wonderful mother, Abra.

160
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:58,556
- I hope so.
- You are.

161
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:00,917
A perfect one.

162
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,271
You don't remember your mother at all,
do you, Aron?

163
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,266
No, she died
right after Cal and I were born.

164
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,597
Must be hard never to have had a mother.

165
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:16,152
- What's that?
- Look, what's he doing up there?

166
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:18,870
- Crazy guy.
- He's watching us.

167
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,950
- No, he isn't.
- Yes, he is, too.

168
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,712
Let's move over here. Aron.

169
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,028
- He's not watching us.
- I feel as if he can still see us.

170
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,067
I love you, Aron.

171
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:47,831
Really, I do. Really.

172
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:51,275
Sure. I love you, too.

173
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:12,152
Cal, stop! Stop that, Cal!

174
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,036
What are you doing? Stop it!

175
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:19,670
"Blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven..."

176
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,272
"whose sin is covered."

177
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:25,914
"Blessed is the man unto whom
the Lord imputeth not iniquity..."

178
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,794
"and in whose spirit there is no guile."

179
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,595
And you are forgiven, Cal.

180
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,356
I think there is no iniquity
in your actions...

181
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:40,630
only something I do not know.

182
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,039
Why did you push that ice down?

183
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:49,873
I don't know.

184
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,149
Was it...

185
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,992
Was it vengeance? Anger?

186
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,349
Fear that I would punish you
for not coming home last night?

187
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,155
What was it?

188
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,674
I wanted to see it slide down the chute.

189
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,436
- Perhaps you had better read from here on.
- I'll read it, Dad.

190
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,750
No, it's for Cal to read.

191
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,909
Start at the fifth verse.

192
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,553
Verse 5.

193
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:38,837
"I acknowledge my sin unto thee,
and mine iniquity have I not hid."

194
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,559
"I said, I will confess my transgressions
unto the Lord..."

195
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,074
"and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin. Selah."

196
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,115
Go on.

197
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,555
Six.

198
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,756
And I suggest a little slower, Cal.

199
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,274
And you don't have to read
the verse numbers.

200
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,475
"For this shall every one that is godly
pray unto thee."

201
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,551
"And surely in the floods of great waters..."

202
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,757
"they shall not come nigh unto him.
Selah."

203
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,796
Seven.

204
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,313
Not the numbers, Cal.

205
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,275
"Thou art my hiding place,
thou shalt preserve me from trouble..."

206
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,070
"thou shalt compass me about
with songs of deliverance. Selah."

207
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:20,633
- Eight.
- You have no repentance! You're bad!

208
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:22,199
Through and through, bad.

209
00:20:22,281 --> 00:20:24,999
Excuse me. I'll go out and wait for Abra.

210
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,991
You're right. I am bad.
I knew that for a long time.

211
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:39,914
I didn't mean that, Cal. I spoke in anger.

212
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:42,071
Well, it's true.

213
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:44,833
Aron's the good one.

214
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,918
I guess there's just a certain amount...

215
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:48,911
of good and bad you get
from your parents...

216
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,310
- and I just got the bad.
- That's not true.

217
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:52,799
Cal, listen to me.

218
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:55,391
You can make of yourself
anything you want.

219
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:57,711
It's up to you. A man has a choice.

220
00:20:57,801 --> 00:21:00,269
That's where he's different from an animal.

221
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,116
You don't listen. You'll never remember.

222
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:12,795
My mother...

223
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:19,191
she's not dead and gone to heaven...

224
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:21,196
is she?

225
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:24,594
Why do you ask that?

226
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:26,874
She's not dead at all.

227
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:30,674
She's not buried in the East
like you said, either.

228
00:21:31,162 --> 00:21:32,435
She's alive.

229
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:34,751
- What makes you think so?
- I heard from a guy.

230
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:36,320
- Who?
- I don't know his name.

231
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:38,518
He was just passing through.

232
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:42,401
How come you told Aron and me she died?

233
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:44,950
- I thought it would save you pain.
- Pain?

234
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:54,075
If she was still alive,
where do you think she'd be?

235
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:57,073
I have no idea. She went East.

236
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:58,601
How do you know?

237
00:21:59,122 --> 00:22:03,195
When she left the ranch we lived on
when you and Aron were born...

238
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:05,594
I heard she went East.

239
00:22:06,682 --> 00:22:08,592
What was she like? Was she bad?

240
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,398
I guess she...

241
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:15,718
I never really knew what she was like.
She wasn't like other people.

242
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:18,072
There was something she seemed to lack.

243
00:22:19,562 --> 00:22:21,792
Kindness, maybe. Conscience.

244
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,833
I never knew what she was after.

245
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:28,956
- How come she left you?
- I never knew that, either.

246
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:32,717
She was so full of hate.

247
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:35,362
- Hate for you?
- For everything.

248
00:22:39,322 --> 00:22:41,916
You won't tell Aron that she didn't die?

249
00:22:42,642 --> 00:22:43,597
No.

250
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,631
Must not do anything to hurt Aron.

251
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:53,515
Where'd you get that scar
you got on your shoulder, Father?

252
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:55,274
I've told you, Cal.

253
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:59,158
It's an old wound I got
in the Indian campaigns.

254
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:03,158
- Why do you ask that now?
- What'd she look like? Was she pretty?

255
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:07,674
She had the most lovely hands.

256
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,115
Like ivory.

257
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:12,278
She took such good care of them.

258
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,921
Her mother had arthritis.

259
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:18,120
She was always afraid
it would come to her in her hands.

260
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:25,755
Talk to me, Father.

261
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:33,116
I got to know who I am.
I got to know who I'm like.

262
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,477
I got to know...

263
00:23:36,002 --> 00:23:37,196
Where is she?

264
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:40,478
I'm telling you, truthfully, Cal...

265
00:23:41,283 --> 00:23:43,478
after she left, I never heard from her.

266
00:23:46,403 --> 00:23:48,314
Cal, wait. I want to talk more with you.

267
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:51,600
If you leave this room now
we may never be able to talk again.

268
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:53,762
You coming home tonight, Cal?

269
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:56,835
What's the difference?
You're home. You're the one he wants.

270
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:59,391
Good evening, Cal.

271
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:02,759
High strung. Very high strung.

272
00:24:03,123 --> 00:24:05,921
Good evening, Abra.
Where is my chess victim?

273
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:08,193
- He's waiting for you, Mr. Albrecht.
- Good.

274
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:10,478
What do you suppose he meant by that?

275
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:25,800
Go on, beat it!

276
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:29,675
Your wife has called up three times.

277
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:33,551
- My wife's a...
- I know she is. Now beat it.

278
00:24:42,803 --> 00:24:44,395
Joe!

279
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:51,637
All right, fella, you've run out of money.

280
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,521
Mr. Hawks.

281
00:24:57,603 --> 00:24:59,720
- What do you want?
- I want...

282
00:24:59,803 --> 00:25:03,194
- What do you want to drink?
- Beer.

283
00:25:14,284 --> 00:25:15,603
Hey!

284
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:18,918
- Where's my drink?
- All right.

285
00:25:19,604 --> 00:25:21,401
That's not very neat, is...

286
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:23,239
It's okay.

287
00:25:25,764 --> 00:25:27,561
- You'd better get out of here.
- How come?

288
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:29,760
You're the one who followed Kate
this morning.

289
00:25:29,844 --> 00:25:32,233
- It's a free country, isn't it?
- It's a free country.

290
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:35,202
Only, Joe said if I saw you again,
I was supposed to tell him.

291
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,240
You can tell him if you want to.

292
00:25:38,284 --> 00:25:40,798
You're just a kid, ain't you?

293
00:25:41,924 --> 00:25:44,393
- I'm older than you are.
- Yeah, sure, but that isn't...

294
00:25:44,485 --> 00:25:45,997
- Hey!
- All right.

295
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:48,639
Kid, please...

296
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:51,159
you oughtn't to go around
throwing stones and things.

297
00:25:51,244 --> 00:25:53,713
That isn't nice. And drinking beer.

298
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:56,959
There's Joe.

299
00:25:58,004 --> 00:26:01,121
Look, kid, please go.
You don't want to get yourself hurt.

300
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:05,076
You could tell him now, if you want to.
There's your chance.

301
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,878
You sure have got a nerve, haven't you?

302
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:18,997
- Do you know Kate?
- This is Kate's place.

303
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:22,077
- She's treating you okay?
- Sure.

304
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,837
I gotta go now, kid.

305
00:26:23,925 --> 00:26:25,243
Is she nice?

306
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:27,044
Don't let Joe see you, please.

307
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,355
She doesn't treat you rough
or anything, does she?

308
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:32,243
Please, kid, I gotta go now.
It was nice meeting you.

309
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:34,839
Isn't there anything nice about her at all?

310
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,443
What's the matter, kid?

311
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:40,799
- She had pretty hands. Did you see them?
- Hands?

312
00:26:40,885 --> 00:26:41,954
Did you look at them?

313
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:45,162
No, I don't think I ever saw them.
She always wears gloves.

314
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,594
Where is she?

315
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:52,482
- You mean now?
- Yeah.

316
00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:55,398
- Back in her office, probably.
- Where's that?

317
00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:57,123
Back that way.

318
00:26:57,205 --> 00:26:58,479
Will you show me?

319
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:04,678
Look, kid, please don't start any trouble.

320
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:07,280
I'm not gonna start any trouble. Come on.

321
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:10,164
We... You can just point the door to me,
and I'll go there.

322
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:11,360
No, honest.

323
00:27:11,445 --> 00:27:14,278
This is a tough place. I can't lose this job.

324
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:16,721
- I'm not very good at it, anyway.
- You won't lose it.

325
00:27:16,805 --> 00:27:19,923
If I step out of line
Kate will throw me out on my ear.

326
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,115
Come on, will you?

327
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:25,435
You can just show me where the door is.

328
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:27,034
Come on.

329
00:27:28,686 --> 00:27:30,243
Be a sport.

330
00:27:33,366 --> 00:27:34,685
Come on.

331
00:27:48,526 --> 00:27:50,118
There's the door.

332
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:52,437
Thank you. You can go back now.

333
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:54,923
What are you gonna do?

334
00:27:55,485 --> 00:27:57,920
Please, kid, don't make any trouble.

335
00:27:59,406 --> 00:28:03,843
I'm not gonna make any trouble.
I'm gonna wait till you're gone. Okay?

336
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:57,639
Will you let me talk to you? Please.

337
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,637
I gotta talk to you.

338
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:08,442
Joe!

339
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:12,642
Get out of here! Joe! Tex!

340
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,761
Call the sheriff! Get him out!

341
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:21,763
Call the sheriff! Get him out of here!

342
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:26,442
I want to talk to her!

343
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:37,197
I want to talk to you!

344
00:29:38,807 --> 00:29:41,116
Please, talk to me!

345
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:44,643
Talk to me, please! Mother!

346
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:49,438
Is there any law against a guy
trying to see his own mother?

347
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:51,678
No, I guess there isn't.

348
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:53,597
Here.

349
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:56,645
Put this on your cheek. Here.

350
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:03,400
Drink some coffee.

351
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:06,958
How did you find out about Kate, anyway?

352
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:09,846
That guy I saw you talking to
in the bar the other night?

353
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:12,441
The one they call "Rabbit."

354
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:16,118
I thought so. He never was any good.

355
00:30:16,207 --> 00:30:19,120
I remember when he used
to work on your father's ranch.

356
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:24,000
Well, he won't be around anymore, Cal.
He's left town for good.

357
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:29,686
- What do you hang around bars for?
- Any law against hanging...

358
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,998
Yes, there is! I'm the law.

359
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:34,046
Get that through your head.

360
00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:36,840
Shut up!

361
00:30:42,768 --> 00:30:45,885
Does Adam know that you...

362
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:47,959
roam around over here at night?

363
00:30:52,048 --> 00:30:55,085
Adam's an old friend of mine,
you know, Cal, from...

364
00:30:55,168 --> 00:30:57,398
way back in his ranch days.

365
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:01,518
I was afraid when you moved here
last year...

366
00:31:02,088 --> 00:31:04,966
that you might find out something
about Kate.

367
00:31:06,008 --> 00:31:08,727
But then she was over here on the Bay...

368
00:31:08,808 --> 00:31:12,005
and you were way over on the other side
of the mountains in Salinas.

369
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:15,923
- So I figured it'd be all right.
- You think he'll ever find out about her?

370
00:31:16,328 --> 00:31:18,524
He'd never come over here.

371
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,325
Here. You might as well look at this now.

372
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:29,084
It's a picture of your father
and your mother on their wedding day.

373
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:32,442
You're the first person
I've ever showed it to.

374
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:38,962
I knew it.

375
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:42,725
I knew it was true.

376
00:31:44,928 --> 00:31:47,522
When that old guy told me in the bar,
I knew it.

377
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,399
How did you know it was true?

378
00:31:52,488 --> 00:31:55,605
'Cause she ain't no good
and I ain't no good.

379
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:58,248
I knew there was a reason why I wasn't.

380
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:07,044
I hate her.

381
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,525
And I hate him, too.

382
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:12,805
Come on, I'll take you home.

383
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:17,803
- You don't have to drive me home!
- I know I don't have to take you home!

384
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:20,078
Here.

385
00:32:20,889 --> 00:32:23,528
A little bit of the hair
of the dog that bit you.

386
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:25,204
Come on now.

387
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,001
How did Dad meet her?

388
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:42,927
Where did she come from?

389
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:46,243
Nobody ever knew
where she come from, really.

390
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:50,246
There were a lot of drifters in those days.

391
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:52,763
Of all the people.

392
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,082
How come he married her?

393
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:01,163
You have no idea how pretty she was, Cal.

394
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,445
Young and full of spirit.

395
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:06,123
And your father hadn't been
off the ranch much, you know.

396
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,120
He's not a worldly man.

397
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,005
- Did she shoot him?
- Yes, she did.

398
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,049
How come?

399
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,764
I don't know.

400
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,206
Did he do something to her?

401
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,682
- Did he hurt her?
- No.

402
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,846
It wasn't in him to hurt her.

403
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,481
After she left him, he died.
He walked around, but he died.

404
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,364
He must have done something to hurt her.

405
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,726
No. No, sir.

406
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,007
He gave her everything
that any woman could ask for.

407
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,485
You see, your father has more kindness...

408
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,049
and more conscience
than any man that I've ever known.

409
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,960
He's a good man, Cal.
Don't sell him short, boy.

410
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,888
It's going to work.

411
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,928
If only I can keep them
cold enough long enough.

412
00:34:56,051 --> 00:34:57,484
It's going to work.

413
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:16,248
All right, there she is. Let's try it.
Step back, girls.

414
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:26,326
All right, bring her on. Come on.

415
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:31,483
Now do you think it'll work?

416
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,205
- Good morning, Mr. Trask.
- Good morning.

417
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:59,201
Somebody swiped our coal chute
right off the wagon.

418
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:01,681
Dear, dear.
Times are getting pretty lawless.

419
00:36:01,772 --> 00:36:02,807
It's this war in Europe.

420
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:06,327
There's a wave of lawlessness
spreading through the country.

421
00:36:06,412 --> 00:36:08,243
Anyway, somebody swiped our chute.

422
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,844
- Is that where you're loading?
- Yes.

423
00:36:09,932 --> 00:36:11,762
We'll move on, then. Good day, Mr. Trask.

424
00:36:11,852 --> 00:36:13,444
It's this war in Europe.

425
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,770
Do you know where Aron is?

426
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:32,008
He's out in the fields. He's checking.

427
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:33,161
Can I do something for you?

428
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:36,324
No. There were just some matters
I want to talk over with him.

429
00:36:36,412 --> 00:36:38,050
What have you got there?

430
00:36:38,852 --> 00:36:42,288
I figured it would save some time. So I...

431
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:45,921
It's very ingenious, Cal. Very ingenious.
Did you think of it?

432
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:47,571
Yep.

433
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:50,007
I'm very pleased
with the way you're taking hold...

434
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:51,684
and are working so well, Cal.

435
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:53,444
Thanks. Thanks, Dad.

436
00:36:58,572 --> 00:37:01,564
Think you better have your lunch now.
It's time.

437
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:04,968
Hi, Cal.

438
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:09,727
- Aron's out in the field.
- I brought his lunch.

439
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:13,526
- Okay, I'll take it to him.
- Cal.

440
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:27,124
Lydia, vamoose.

441
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:41,801
He'll be here in a minute.

442
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:45,442
I've been fixing Aron's lunch.
I'll fix yours, too, if you like, after this.

443
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:47,046
No, thanks.

444
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:51,169
Would you be eating with her
if I weren't here?

445
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:52,242
Who?

446
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:58,047
No, I didn't ask her to come up here.

447
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:03,889
Girls follow you around, don't they?

448
00:38:03,973 --> 00:38:06,851
- Does she bother you?
- She doesn't bother me.

449
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:08,802
Who is she?

450
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:13,443
I never saw her before in my life.

451
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:16,241
I'll bet.

452
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:22,045
You're really working
at this lettuce business, aren't you, Cal?

453
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,252
Do you think it'll turn out all right?

454
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,972
Your father will lose quite a lot of money
if it doesn't.

455
00:38:27,053 --> 00:38:28,645
Just about all he's got.

456
00:38:29,293 --> 00:38:31,249
I like your father.

457
00:38:32,453 --> 00:38:33,409
Do you?

458
00:38:37,974 --> 00:38:40,567
I threw away about $3,000 once.

459
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:42,128
Yeah?

460
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:45,644
- When I was 13.
- You threw it away?

461
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:47,451
It was a diamond ring worth about that.

462
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,001
At least, my father told me
that's what he paid for it.

463
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:53,369
I threw it in the river.
Made Dad terribly angry.

464
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:57,285
I reckon it would.

465
00:38:57,373 --> 00:38:59,968
But I forgave him.
And it's been all right ever since.

466
00:39:00,054 --> 00:39:01,533
- You forgave him?
- Yes.

467
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:07,763
You forgave him 'cause you threw
a ring of his worth $3,000 into the river?

468
00:39:07,854 --> 00:39:09,411
- That's right.
- And you forgave him?

469
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:11,051
That's right.

470
00:39:11,134 --> 00:39:13,170
Is there an egg in this basket?

471
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:18,204
You see, I thought he didn't love me.
That made me feel awful.

472
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:21,889
Girls love their fathers terribly.

473
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:23,682
Do they?

474
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:26,572
My mother died when I was 13...

475
00:39:26,654 --> 00:39:29,726
and Dad got married again soon after that.
Did you know that?

476
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:31,691
No, I didn't know that.

477
00:39:32,854 --> 00:39:34,890
Are you interested in hearing about me?

478
00:39:34,974 --> 00:39:36,009
Yeah.

479
00:39:39,654 --> 00:39:42,964
When Dad got married again,
it made me sick.

480
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:45,612
I just hated everybody.

481
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:48,405
I used to sit and just glare at people...

482
00:39:48,494 --> 00:39:51,168
or I wouldn't even answer
when they spoke to me.

483
00:39:53,214 --> 00:39:56,126
- Why you telling me all this?
- I want to.

484
00:39:56,734 --> 00:40:00,045
I was that way for months.
I just hated everybody.

485
00:40:00,135 --> 00:40:02,365
I thought nobody in the world loved me.

486
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:06,404
And it was awful.

487
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:11,372
Then I found this ring
that Dad gave my new mother...

488
00:40:12,735 --> 00:40:15,373
- so I took it and threw it in the river.
- Good.

489
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:18,532
I thought you'd like that.

490
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:21,687
- Did he ever find it?
- Never.

491
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:25,207
They tried.

492
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:27,728
What'd they do to you?

493
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:30,534
Dad punished me. Not badly, I guess.

494
00:40:30,614 --> 00:40:33,129
But I felt
he shouldn't have punished me at all.

495
00:40:33,214 --> 00:40:36,571
I felt he should have loved me more
because I did it.

496
00:40:36,975 --> 00:40:38,169
But he didn't.

497
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:41,011
Isn't it funny?

498
00:40:41,895 --> 00:40:43,772
I'm grown up now...

499
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:46,323
but I still understand kids better
than I do grownups.

500
00:40:46,415 --> 00:40:47,530
You're not so grown-up.

501
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:49,765
- I'm very grown-up.
- That's a matter of opinion.

502
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:51,288
I'm very grown-up.

503
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:54,731
More so than Dad, because I forgave him
for not understanding.

504
00:40:57,335 --> 00:40:59,724
And the minute I forgave him in my mind...

505
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:01,928
I felt better.

506
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:10,807
Now we get along fine.

507
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:15,689
We love each other.
Not like we did when I was 13...

508
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:18,653
but enough so we can live together
till I get married.

509
00:41:22,256 --> 00:41:25,611
He's just my father now.
Nothing to rave about.

510
00:41:26,415 --> 00:41:29,452
I still don't like her much,
but then, she's a woman.

511
00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:44,772
My, that girl just hates me, doesn't she?

512
00:41:45,696 --> 00:41:47,926
You better tell her I'm your brother's girl.

513
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:50,610
I don't have to explain anything
to anybody.

514
00:41:53,455 --> 00:41:55,730
I'll go now and leave the field to her.

515
00:41:59,615 --> 00:42:01,651
My, your hair's in a mess.

516
00:42:05,136 --> 00:42:06,967
Dad, what's that?

517
00:42:07,056 --> 00:42:10,253
That's something Cal rigged up.
It's a good idea.

518
00:42:10,336 --> 00:42:12,406
Aron! I brought your lunch.

519
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:15,371
Looks like a coal chute.

520
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:17,414
Coal chute?

521
00:42:20,736 --> 00:42:22,328
Okay, woman, where's the beans?

522
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:23,371
Cal!

523
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:29,605
What makes you think you have the right
to come and take something like this?

524
00:42:29,696 --> 00:42:32,894
You probably lost those men their jobs.
Now, you take it back.

525
00:42:40,136 --> 00:42:43,333
He's praising Cal and Cal is lapping it up.

526
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:45,930
Aron! Look, have one of those
made of wood.

527
00:42:46,016 --> 00:42:48,212
- It'll save a lot of time.
- Yes, sir!

528
00:42:51,456 --> 00:42:53,606
- Good waste of time and money.
- And lettuce.

529
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,734
- What'd you say?
- I said, it's a good idea if it works.

530
00:42:56,816 --> 00:42:59,172
It's gonna work, 'cause it's gotta work.

531
00:42:59,256 --> 00:43:01,292
It's gotta work, 'cause I said so.

532
00:43:03,217 --> 00:43:05,208
If it don't work, it ain't that kid's fault.

533
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:07,527
I never saw anybody work
so hard in my life.

534
00:43:10,857 --> 00:43:13,291
Let's go, Pete. Now, Leonard!

535
00:43:16,217 --> 00:43:18,447
Good luck, Adam.

536
00:43:50,617 --> 00:43:53,495
Do you know the principle
of the internal combustion engine?

537
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:56,011
No, I'm afraid not.
Will, I'll never be able to...

538
00:43:56,097 --> 00:43:58,088
Sure you will. You just listen to Roy.

539
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,328
He's been to the automobile school
in Chicago.

540
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:03,215
Mr. Trask has just revolutionized
the entire vegetable market.

541
00:44:03,297 --> 00:44:05,891
- Wait till those cars get to New York.
- Don't you worry.

542
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,968
It's about time he owned
his own automobile...

543
00:44:08,057 --> 00:44:09,729
and about time he learned to drive it.

544
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:12,251
- Now don't you think so, Roy?
- I'll do my best.

545
00:44:12,338 --> 00:44:14,248
Now pay strict attention, boys.

546
00:44:15,177 --> 00:44:16,292
Don't touch that!

547
00:44:16,377 --> 00:44:17,936
Wait till it's explained to you.

548
00:44:18,017 --> 00:44:20,930
No, now for heaven's sake,
don't touch anything, anybody.

549
00:44:21,737 --> 00:44:24,615
The power of the explosion
is exerted on a piston...

550
00:44:24,697 --> 00:44:28,168
and through connecting rod
and crankshaft...

551
00:44:28,257 --> 00:44:31,932
through transmission,
thence to rear wheels.

552
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:34,612
- Got that so far?
- Sure, he's got that.

553
00:44:34,698 --> 00:44:37,610
Now, we go on
to the operation of the automobile.

554
00:44:38,697 --> 00:44:40,529
This here's the ignition key.

555
00:44:41,418 --> 00:44:44,137
Would you mind putting out
that cigarette, please.

556
00:44:44,218 --> 00:44:47,255
Turn this doohickey here to the left.
That puts her on battery.

557
00:44:47,337 --> 00:44:49,294
- See where it says "bat"?
- Yes.

558
00:44:49,377 --> 00:44:52,688
- Bat, short for battery.
- That's right. Good boy.

559
00:44:53,138 --> 00:44:54,571
Thank you. Thank you very much.

560
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,137
First you gotta retard the spark.

561
00:44:56,218 --> 00:44:59,767
If you don't retard the spark,
she'll probably kick your blasted arm off.

562
00:44:59,858 --> 00:45:01,371
Now remember that.

563
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,011
This here is the spark.

564
00:45:03,097 --> 00:45:06,215
You push her way up. Listen.

565
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:10,530
- This here's the gas. You push her...
- Down.

566
00:45:11,258 --> 00:45:14,455
- You had lessons before.
- No, I just saw you do it.

567
00:45:15,298 --> 00:45:18,017
- You're a pretty smart old buzzard.
- Thank you very much.

568
00:45:18,098 --> 00:45:20,487
- Keep your eyes open, don't you?
- Try to.

569
00:45:21,098 --> 00:45:22,817
Now, this here is the crank.

570
00:45:22,898 --> 00:45:25,970
See this wire sticking out of the radiator?
That's the choke.

571
00:45:26,058 --> 00:45:28,777
Now watch careful.
Grab hold of the crank like this.

572
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,257
Push in till she catches.

573
00:45:30,338 --> 00:45:31,771
See how my thumb is turned down?

574
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:33,337
I noticed that. Why do you do that?

575
00:45:33,418 --> 00:45:36,137
If you put her around this way
with my thumb around her...

576
00:45:36,218 --> 00:45:38,130
she'd probably knock
my blasted thumb off.

577
00:45:38,218 --> 00:45:42,052
Dear, dear. First you lose your blasted arm
and then you lose your blasted thumb.

578
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,130
- That's kind of wrong way around.
- How's that?

579
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:47,336
He made a joke.
I never did see him so happy.

580
00:45:47,818 --> 00:45:50,777
You pull out this choke
turn her around to suck gas in.

581
00:45:51,378 --> 00:45:53,335
Then you give her a hard spin.

582
00:45:53,698 --> 00:45:56,816
- She caught, first time!
- Caught on what?

583
00:45:57,619 --> 00:45:59,371
Advance the spark and retard the gas.

584
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:02,019
Reach over real quick and switch
to mag. That's magneto.

585
00:46:02,098 --> 00:46:03,896
So, there you are.

586
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:06,412
Isn't that wonderful?

587
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:08,933
Of course, it isn't exactly
going anywhere, is it?

588
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,008
That's the easy part.

589
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:11,896
- Adam.
- I want you all to repeat after me.

590
00:46:11,979 --> 00:46:14,447
Spark up, gas down.

591
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:15,858
Switch to bat.

592
00:46:15,938 --> 00:46:18,578
Crank to compression, thumb down.

593
00:46:18,658 --> 00:46:20,536
You get that? Let's have it again.

594
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:22,610
Spark up, gas down.

595
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:24,814
- What's the matter?
- Big snow slide.

596
00:46:24,899 --> 00:46:27,732
Closed the pass and stopped the cars
about 100 miles out.

597
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:30,412
Can see water running out of the cars.

598
00:46:42,819 --> 00:46:45,731
It's still a good idea.
Cold can preserve things.

599
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:47,650
Someday, somebody'll prove it.

600
00:46:49,419 --> 00:46:51,694
- It was your idea.
- No!

601
00:46:51,779 --> 00:46:54,498
It was presumptuous of me
to think it would be I.

602
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,219
Guess we bit off more lettuce
than we could chew.

603
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:04,255
What do you know about that?
I thought he'd really be hurt.

604
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:07,815
You don't understand him.

605
00:47:08,899 --> 00:47:11,049
- You can't go in there.
- I gotta see Will Hamilton.

606
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,448
He won't be through for an hour.
They just started.

607
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,530
- Let me see him.
- There's a war in Europe.

608
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:18,497
These boys are trying
to get themselves in shape. So beat it.

609
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,059
Right, left.

610
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,532
Now, deep knee bends, follow me.

611
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,577
- What's that?
- That's the fire bell.

612
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,252
We better have a look.

613
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,696
- It may be the Germans.
- Fire, Germans, who cares? I surrender.

614
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,973
- Howdy, Mr. Albrecht.
- Hello, Cal.

615
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,857
- Mr. Hamilton.
- There's a fire somewhere.

616
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,373
- No. I rang the bell.
- You rang it?

617
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,449
Yeah. I had to see you.

618
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,417
You know, you're crazy.
You're really crazy.

619
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,730
I knew it when you pushed that ice
down the chute.

620
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,614
Let's get out of here
before they start up that piano again.

621
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,851
There must be some easier way
to stop the Germans than this, anyway.

622
00:48:14,941 --> 00:48:18,330
- You see, I gotta make some money.
- Sure, everybody's got to.

623
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,772
Remember, you said that
if you wanna make money...

624
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,088
you ought to raise beans?

625
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,330
Yeah, beans are up 3.5 cents now.

626
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,571
Now, the way I figure it, it's like you said.

627
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:30,730
The country's gonna get into war, isn't it?

628
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:32,618
I don't see any way out.

629
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,056
- War's good for business.
- The best there is.

630
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,496
See, that's why I wanna go into beans.

631
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,376
See, I gotta get enough money
to give my father back what he lost.

632
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,493
I see.

633
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:49,691
You think you can make
all that money back?

634
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:51,100
I gotta.

635
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,012
You know, you're crazy.

636
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,695
Look, Cal, don't you know...

637
00:48:55,781 --> 00:48:58,454
that you gotta have money
in order to make money?

638
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,772
- I'll get some money.
- How?

639
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:02,655
I'll get it.

640
00:49:03,221 --> 00:49:06,577
Look, don't get so near to me.
I don't wanna get all hot again.

641
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,414
- How much money could you get?
- What do you think I need?

642
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:11,571
If you had $5,000...

643
00:49:15,741 --> 00:49:17,015
$5,000?

644
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:21,620
It's a little different when you start
putting it into figures, isn't it?

645
00:49:24,181 --> 00:49:25,899
I know you wanna help your father...

646
00:49:25,981 --> 00:49:28,973
but a kid your age can't be expected
to put his hands on $5,000.

647
00:49:29,061 --> 00:49:32,531
Maybe if you could raise $100 or so,
we could let you have a little share.

648
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:34,976
I don't want a little share,
I want the whole thing.

649
00:49:35,061 --> 00:49:37,735
- I'll get $5,000.
- Maybe if you and Aron went in together...

650
00:49:37,821 --> 00:49:40,382
Aron ain't got nothing to do with this.
This is my deal.

651
00:49:40,461 --> 00:49:41,450
I'll get the $5,000.

652
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:43,452
What're you gonna do, borrow it?

653
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:46,657
Yeah.

654
00:49:47,782 --> 00:49:49,976
All right. If you can borrow $5,000...

655
00:49:50,061 --> 00:49:52,701
I know a farmer who's got over 800 acres.

656
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,580
- It's under cultivation.
- All right. What do we do?

657
00:49:56,142 --> 00:49:58,861
If we can guarantee him 5 cents a pound...

658
00:49:58,941 --> 00:50:01,297
and make him a seed loan,
he'll plant beans.

659
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:02,780
So will a lot of other farmers.

660
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:05,614
Why, we can contract
all the bean acreage you want.

661
00:50:07,502 --> 00:50:10,857
That's it. That's great. When do we start?

662
00:50:11,782 --> 00:50:14,136
How do you know the price
will go above 5, though?

663
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:16,058
Did you read the newspapers
this morning?

664
00:50:16,142 --> 00:50:18,292
We're apt to be in war any minute.

665
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:21,931
You know I got a contract
with the British Purchasing Agency...

666
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:24,251
and I got a friend in
the Quartermaster Corps.

667
00:50:24,342 --> 00:50:26,651
Do you know
that we could sell all the dry beans...

668
00:50:26,742 --> 00:50:28,812
that we can find
at 10 cents a pound or more?

669
00:50:28,902 --> 00:50:31,575
That's what I want. That's it. See?

670
00:50:32,381 --> 00:50:34,737
- How much will I make?
- Enough for what you want.

671
00:51:21,303 --> 00:51:23,897
- What does Cal stand for?
- Caleb.

672
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:26,374
It's in the Bible.

673
00:51:28,983 --> 00:51:31,450
- What's your brother's name?
- Aron.

674
00:51:32,543 --> 00:51:34,214
That's in the Bible, too.

675
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,576
What's he like?

676
00:51:41,662 --> 00:51:43,493
He looks like you.

677
00:51:45,622 --> 00:51:47,181
Is he like me?

678
00:51:47,262 --> 00:51:49,253
No. He's good.

679
00:51:53,223 --> 00:51:54,576
I'm more like you.

680
00:51:58,263 --> 00:51:59,582
How's Adam?

681
00:52:00,343 --> 00:52:01,776
How's your father?

682
00:52:03,343 --> 00:52:05,140
I don't wanna talk about him.

683
00:52:13,343 --> 00:52:15,732
- You don't?
- No.

684
00:52:23,503 --> 00:52:26,336
I didn't know who you were
when you were here before.

685
00:52:26,903 --> 00:52:28,655
I knew you didn't.

686
00:52:32,303 --> 00:52:34,419
Aren't you afraid
to come around here again?

687
00:52:34,503 --> 00:52:36,937
Yeah, I am. No. Well, kind of.

688
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:43,056
What do you want?

689
00:52:45,303 --> 00:52:47,180
Just to look at me?

690
00:52:52,504 --> 00:52:54,335
I want $5,000.

691
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,698
All right, come on in. Sit down.

692
00:53:10,383 --> 00:53:11,499
Come in.

693
00:53:13,104 --> 00:53:14,378
Try that chair.

694
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:18,902
You got your father's eyes.

695
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:22,100
That's all I can see of him.

696
00:53:23,384 --> 00:53:26,261
- You're a nice looking boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

697
00:53:30,224 --> 00:53:32,817
- I was very beautiful once.
- Yes, ma'am.

698
00:53:37,104 --> 00:53:38,696
Caleb and Aron.

699
00:53:39,104 --> 00:53:41,777
Your father still thinks
he's living in the Bible, huh?

700
00:53:41,864 --> 00:53:43,183
Them's just names.

701
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:46,218
Joe says that you go to school in Salinas.

702
00:53:46,304 --> 00:53:48,135
Are you good in your studies?

703
00:53:49,904 --> 00:53:51,781
I get by with them.

704
00:53:51,864 --> 00:53:53,776
Does Aron get by with them?

705
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:54,979
He's bright.

706
00:53:56,224 --> 00:53:59,580
What are you gonna do when you finish?
You're going to college?

707
00:54:00,464 --> 00:54:01,419
Maybe.

708
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:04,697
Or back to some ranch?

709
00:54:04,785 --> 00:54:07,503
No, I don't like the ranch.

710
00:54:08,424 --> 00:54:10,062
You take after me.

711
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:14,101
Makes me mad just to think about a ranch.

712
00:54:15,745 --> 00:54:16,972
Sit down.

713
00:54:21,665 --> 00:54:22,619
Thanks.

714
00:54:29,745 --> 00:54:31,939
What do you want with $5,000?

715
00:54:32,664 --> 00:54:34,337
I want to go into business.

716
00:54:34,425 --> 00:54:37,622
- You're a little young for that, aren't you?
- I'm old enough.

717
00:54:38,105 --> 00:54:40,539
Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess you are.

718
00:54:41,265 --> 00:54:43,699
- What business do you wanna go into?
- Beans.

719
00:54:46,705 --> 00:54:49,344
Beans are up to 3.5 cents now.

720
00:54:49,425 --> 00:54:51,939
And if we get into war,
they're gonna go up to 10, 12.

721
00:54:52,025 --> 00:54:54,697
- If we get into the war.
- That's a gamble you have to take.

722
00:54:54,785 --> 00:54:56,821
- Will Hamilton says that...
- Will?

723
00:54:56,905 --> 00:54:59,135
You going into business
with Will Hamilton?

724
00:54:59,225 --> 00:55:00,544
You see...

725
00:55:02,425 --> 00:55:05,781
my father, he lost about all he had in...

726
00:55:05,865 --> 00:55:08,743
Yeah, I know. I heard about that.

727
00:55:10,345 --> 00:55:13,303
I wanna make enough to pay him back.

728
00:55:14,105 --> 00:55:17,256
What's the matter with him?
Can't he make any money?

729
00:55:17,345 --> 00:55:18,255
Yeah.

730
00:55:20,945 --> 00:55:21,900
Only...

731
00:55:23,225 --> 00:55:26,581
Only he's too good to bother with money.

732
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:30,741
Okay.

733
00:55:35,225 --> 00:55:38,103
What makes you think I'd give you $5,000?

734
00:55:42,665 --> 00:55:44,656
I don't know who else to ask.

735
00:55:46,946 --> 00:55:48,743
You got a lot of nerve coming to me.

736
00:55:48,825 --> 00:55:51,579
Why? I didn't do anything to you.

737
00:55:57,106 --> 00:55:59,300
It's a good business venture.

738
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:04,865
I'll pay you back. I'll give you interest.

739
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:07,506
You're a business woman, ain't you?

740
00:56:07,585 --> 00:56:09,018
One of the best, Son.

741
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:14,895
You know, Sam told me that you think
I ought to be run out of town.

742
00:56:18,066 --> 00:56:21,979
You're afraid that your father and Aron
might find out about me, is that it?

743
00:56:25,826 --> 00:56:27,942
This $5,000, now.

744
00:56:28,026 --> 00:56:30,745
That wouldn't be
any kind of blackmail, would it?

745
00:56:30,826 --> 00:56:32,498
I never thought about that.

746
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,695
But now that you do, it's a good idea, huh?

747
00:56:37,066 --> 00:56:39,022
- I guess, maybe.
- It's not.

748
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:46,502
Anyway, I'm not gonna hurt
your precious father or your brother.

749
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:49,381
- Do they know anything about me?
- No.

750
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,777
Father thinks you're in the East...

751
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:54,863
and Aron thinks you're dead.

752
00:56:55,906 --> 00:56:59,695
Then, there's no reason to think
that they ever will find out about me.

753
00:56:59,787 --> 00:57:02,823
We don't exactly move in the same circles.

754
00:57:09,006 --> 00:57:10,644
What are you staring at?

755
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:13,960
How come you did it?

756
00:57:14,926 --> 00:57:15,881
Did what?

757
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,761
Shot my father?

758
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:21,962
Did he tell you that?

759
00:57:24,687 --> 00:57:27,485
How come you ran away from all of us?
How come you shot him?

760
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:30,764
- Ran away and did all that kind of stuff?
- None of your business.

761
00:57:32,087 --> 00:57:34,361
I shot him because he tried to stop me.

762
00:57:35,287 --> 00:57:37,801
I could have killed him if I'd wanted to,
but I didn't.

763
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:40,037
I just wanted him to let me go.

764
00:57:40,686 --> 00:57:44,043
- Why?
- Because he tried to hold me.

765
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,921
He wanted to tie me down.

766
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,521
He wanted to keep me
on a stinking little ranch...

767
00:57:49,607 --> 00:57:51,757
away from everybody.
Keep me all to himself.

768
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:53,963
Nobody holds me.

769
00:57:54,526 --> 00:57:56,404
- But he loved you.
- Love.

770
00:57:58,047 --> 00:57:59,924
He wanted to own me.

771
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:03,041
He wanted to bring me up
like a snot-nosed kid...

772
00:58:03,127 --> 00:58:06,676
and tell me what to do.
Nobody tells me what to do.

773
00:58:08,127 --> 00:58:11,324
Always so right himself.
Knowing everything.

774
00:58:12,087 --> 00:58:14,123
Reading the Bible at me.

775
00:58:14,927 --> 00:58:17,157
- What are you grinning at?
- Nothing.

776
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:20,683
Maybe you know what I'm talking about?

777
00:58:21,887 --> 00:58:23,559
Always so right himself?

778
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,361
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

779
00:58:26,848 --> 00:58:29,964
Maybe like you said out there,
maybe you are more like me.

780
00:58:33,328 --> 00:58:34,999
Yeah, you got sense.

781
00:58:35,528 --> 00:58:38,645
Maybe you don't fall for that slop
any more than I do.

782
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:42,323
Maybe you know what people
are really like. What they want.

783
00:58:42,407 --> 00:58:45,366
I got the toughest house on the coast...

784
00:58:45,447 --> 00:58:47,677
and the finest clientele.

785
00:58:49,768 --> 00:58:52,202
Half the stinking city hall go there.

786
00:58:53,728 --> 00:58:55,320
They sneak in at night...

787
00:58:55,408 --> 00:58:58,206
and I walk in this front door
in the daytime, see.

788
00:58:59,048 --> 00:59:00,925
And I built it up from nothing.

789
00:59:02,128 --> 00:59:04,244
Now you want $5,000 of my money...

790
00:59:04,328 --> 00:59:07,047
to go into business
to pay your father back what he lost.

791
00:59:07,248 --> 00:59:08,680
You know, that's funny.

792
00:59:09,648 --> 00:59:12,286
I don't think he'll know where I got it.

793
00:59:12,368 --> 00:59:14,643
No, but it's funny just the same.

794
00:59:15,488 --> 00:59:16,841
Your father.

795
00:59:17,568 --> 00:59:19,843
He's the purest man there is, isn't he?

796
00:59:20,968 --> 00:59:24,199
He thought he had me all tied up
with his purity.

797
00:59:24,848 --> 00:59:27,999
And now I give you $5,000
of the money that I made...

798
00:59:28,088 --> 00:59:30,238
to save him his purity.

799
00:59:31,048 --> 00:59:34,358
If you don't think that's funny,
you'd better not go to college.

800
00:59:43,768 --> 00:59:44,724
Okay.

801
00:59:48,688 --> 00:59:50,884
Tell Will Hamilton to come and see me.

802
00:59:53,409 --> 00:59:55,080
He's a good businessman.

803
00:59:58,329 --> 01:00:01,844
How'd he ever happen to let you go
into this bean business, anyway?

804
01:00:02,329 --> 01:00:03,523
I don't know.

805
01:00:05,008 --> 01:00:07,044
I do. Maybe he likes you.

806
01:00:08,209 --> 01:00:09,164
Maybe.

807
01:00:11,968 --> 01:00:13,925
You're a likeable kid.

808
01:00:22,969 --> 01:00:24,686
You give this to him.

809
01:00:26,049 --> 01:00:28,927
If he wants to gamble
that we get into the war...

810
01:00:29,009 --> 01:00:30,327
it's okay with me.

811
01:00:49,129 --> 01:00:50,642
You're a likeable kid.

812
01:00:58,089 --> 01:00:59,920
Go on, get out of here.

813
01:01:02,649 --> 01:01:05,117
Go on, get out. I'm running a business.

814
01:01:46,049 --> 01:01:47,926
- Them Germans can't fight.
- No.

815
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,439
Hi, partner.

816
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:18,928
Every day in every way,
we're getting richer and richer.

817
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:24,805
Kaiser.

818
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:28,041
All we have to do is call his bluff.
He'll come to heel like a dog.

819
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,838
We'll be there to clean up this mess
for those foreigners in a couple of weeks.

820
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:54,249
Cal, stop it.

821
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:57,406
There's Cal.

822
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:05,729
- Hi, boy. Hey, want some?
- Hello, Cal.

823
01:03:06,251 --> 01:03:07,205
Thanks.

824
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:19,450
Your own Woodrow Wilson said you gotta
make the country safe for democracy.

825
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,967
- Didn't he say that?
- Yes, he said that.

826
01:03:22,051 --> 01:03:23,120
Will you go?

827
01:03:23,211 --> 01:03:25,202
I think the war will be over. I don't think...

828
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:28,761
If you believe in all this, why don't you?
If you really think it's right.

829
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,409
I didn't say it was right, Aron.

830
01:03:30,491 --> 01:03:32,402
No, I guess you didn't.

831
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:37,006
Why don't you go back
and join the parade?

832
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:46,487
Nothing'll ever make me go. Nothing.

833
01:03:48,011 --> 01:03:50,081
I just don't believe it's right.

834
01:04:06,251 --> 01:04:08,401
- Did you water them good?
- Sure, lots of water.

835
01:04:08,492 --> 01:04:10,607
- Not too much, though.
- No, just right.

836
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:30,970
Marty Hopps got a telegram today.
His boy was killed.

837
01:04:31,051 --> 01:04:33,042
I remember the day we sent him off.

838
01:04:35,492 --> 01:04:38,131
A lot of troop ships have sunk
they don't tell us about.

839
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:40,646
- It's gonna be a long war.
- Those Germans got an army.

840
01:04:40,732 --> 01:04:42,370
They're a military nation.

841
01:04:42,732 --> 01:04:44,723
Go back where you came from, German!

842
01:04:44,812 --> 01:04:46,369
Go on home, German!

843
01:04:53,572 --> 01:04:54,846
This is just the start.

844
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:57,241
That rock through the window
is just the beginning.

845
01:04:57,332 --> 01:04:59,004
The German people don't want this war.

846
01:04:59,092 --> 01:05:01,731
And the stories they tell
of what the Germans are doing...

847
01:05:01,812 --> 01:05:03,803
it simply is not true. Not the good ones.

848
01:05:03,892 --> 01:05:07,089
I've been wondering lately
if we shouldn't all go back to the ranch.

849
01:05:07,172 --> 01:05:09,367
You can't get away from it there, Dad.

850
01:05:10,093 --> 01:05:13,448
I don't know, somehow, on a ranch,
I don't know...

851
01:05:13,532 --> 01:05:16,888
War seems to be
city people's business somehow.

852
01:05:18,132 --> 01:05:21,044
Farmers. What's a farmer got to do
with war?

853
01:05:22,973 --> 01:05:24,200
You tired, Dad?

854
01:05:25,772 --> 01:05:29,129
My eyes, I guess.
I work too hard at the Draft Board.

855
01:05:30,532 --> 01:05:33,683
Better have my glasses looked at,
see if they're all right.

856
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:39,011
I had a look at the bank account
the other day...

857
01:05:39,092 --> 01:05:41,606
not much left after my great fiasco.

858
01:05:44,213 --> 01:05:46,886
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

859
01:05:46,973 --> 01:05:48,964
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

860
01:05:52,413 --> 01:05:54,243
Let's don't worry about money.

861
01:06:03,373 --> 01:06:05,090
Hey, Rantani!

862
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,005
Ain't this some sight?

863
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:09,491
Beans!

864
01:06:10,293 --> 01:06:12,170
Yeah, boy, some beans.

865
01:06:12,253 --> 01:06:14,847
You come here everyday, boy,
what do you think...

866
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:16,924
you gonna make them grow quicker?

867
01:06:26,013 --> 01:06:27,241
He's crazy.

868
01:06:33,813 --> 01:06:37,010
Hey, where have you been?

869
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,812
Come on.

870
01:06:39,893 --> 01:06:41,770
We're gonna have lots of fun tonight.

871
01:06:53,413 --> 01:06:55,802
- You won another cigar.
- Wait a minute.

872
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:59,613
You wanna try one? No?

873
01:07:02,293 --> 01:07:03,522
Pick up my cigar.

874
01:07:03,614 --> 01:07:05,888
- I'm waiting for somebody.
- You're waiting for me.

875
01:07:05,974 --> 01:07:06,963
No, I'm not.

876
01:07:07,054 --> 01:07:09,045
Why don't you let me
take you for a nice ride?

877
01:07:09,134 --> 01:07:11,772
If you don't stop bothering me,
I'll have to call someone.

878
01:07:11,854 --> 01:07:13,731
- Hello, Cal.
- What's the matter?

879
01:07:13,853 --> 01:07:17,051
I was trying to tell this gentleman
that I was waiting for somebody.

880
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,966
This is a lousy place
to keep your girlfriend waiting for you.

881
01:07:20,054 --> 01:07:21,851
- Sir, it won't happen again.
- I hope not.

882
01:07:21,933 --> 01:07:24,652
Lots of lousy characters around here.
Sorry, miss.

883
01:07:25,534 --> 01:07:26,852
Here I am, lady.

884
01:07:28,613 --> 01:07:30,684
That's the first time
that ever happened to me.

885
01:07:30,774 --> 01:07:33,368
- What're you doing out here?
- I'm meeting Aron.

886
01:07:33,454 --> 01:07:36,287
I thought I'd come out early
and look around.

887
01:07:36,374 --> 01:07:39,730
- You never been out here before?
- Not at night, no.

888
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,771
- What time you gonna meet him?
- At 8:00.

889
01:07:42,854 --> 01:07:45,845
Thought I'd try and cheer him up.
He's been so depressed lately.

890
01:07:45,934 --> 01:07:46,923
Yeah, I know.

891
01:07:47,014 --> 01:07:49,084
I'm so glad you happened to be here.

892
01:07:54,814 --> 01:07:55,769
8:00?

893
01:07:57,014 --> 01:07:58,527
You got a half hour?

894
01:08:03,214 --> 01:08:05,409
How are you, Cal?
We never see you around anymore.

895
01:08:05,495 --> 01:08:06,529
I'm around.

896
01:08:06,614 --> 01:08:09,811
I've been over to the house several times,
but you were never there.

897
01:08:09,894 --> 01:08:13,091
- I never go home anymore.
- Aron says he hardly ever sees you.

898
01:08:14,374 --> 01:08:16,205
I feel awfully sorry for him.

899
01:08:21,854 --> 01:08:24,049
You're terrible.

900
01:08:24,135 --> 01:08:26,887
That's the first time
that ever happened to me, too.

901
01:08:28,054 --> 01:08:30,170
Wonder if we can see Aron from here.

902
01:08:31,255 --> 01:08:33,849
I feel awfully sorry for him.
He's right, you know.

903
01:08:33,934 --> 01:08:36,927
I mean, it's awful, the war and people
killing each other.

904
01:08:37,015 --> 01:08:39,734
Why feel sorry for Aron?
Feel sorry for the people.

905
01:08:39,814 --> 01:08:42,375
But it just seems to affect him
so personally.

906
01:08:42,455 --> 01:08:44,285
I'll agree with that.

907
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,648
He's right.

908
01:08:47,935 --> 01:08:49,652
He's always right.

909
01:08:49,775 --> 01:08:51,730
And he has always been right.

910
01:08:51,815 --> 01:08:53,486
Now let's talk about something else.

911
01:08:53,575 --> 01:08:54,610
All right.

912
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:57,244
8:00.

913
01:08:57,535 --> 01:08:59,048
We got a lot to see.

914
01:09:00,215 --> 01:09:02,206
Will we be back in time for Aron?

915
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:07,212
All right. I'd love to.

916
01:09:14,655 --> 01:09:15,610
Easy.

917
01:09:39,255 --> 01:09:42,611
Here's your cigar,
and where have you been hiding?

918
01:09:45,975 --> 01:09:47,203
- Who was that?
- Who?

919
01:09:47,295 --> 01:09:49,331
- That girl.
- I don't see nobody.

920
01:09:49,416 --> 01:09:53,045
She was standing right...
Girls follow you around, don't they?

921
01:09:54,616 --> 01:09:56,652
What are girls like that like?

922
01:09:57,216 --> 01:09:58,250
All right, never mind.

923
01:09:58,336 --> 01:10:01,133
These Huns have been the aggressors
in every war in Europe...

924
01:10:01,216 --> 01:10:02,649
since the time of Julius Caesar.

925
01:10:02,736 --> 01:10:06,251
I couldn't attempt to describe to you
the horrors committed by the Germans.

926
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,371
Look.

927
01:10:07,455 --> 01:10:08,809
Would we have time?

928
01:10:09,095 --> 01:10:11,007
...after the Germans had been through...

929
01:10:11,096 --> 01:10:13,450
- the women of the town...
- That German's here again.

930
01:10:13,536 --> 01:10:16,493
It is not true. It is lies, all lies.

931
01:10:16,895 --> 01:10:20,206
Come on, Cal. Is it scary?

932
01:10:22,496 --> 01:10:23,770
Here we go.

933
01:10:33,456 --> 01:10:35,650
It is lies, all lies.

934
01:10:35,736 --> 01:10:38,170
I'd like to give that guy
a piece of my mind.

935
01:10:38,536 --> 01:10:40,288
See over there. That's Castroville.

936
01:10:40,376 --> 01:10:42,048
Everything looks so small down there.

937
01:10:42,136 --> 01:10:43,854
"Higher and higher and higher and higher"

938
01:10:43,936 --> 01:10:44,971
What?

939
01:10:45,056 --> 01:10:47,286
"Growing and growing
and growing and growing"

940
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:51,085
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you sometime.

941
01:10:55,736 --> 01:10:57,374
Does Aron really love me?

942
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:01,327
I seem to have sort of lost him.

943
01:11:01,416 --> 01:11:05,045
I mean, we're going
to be married someday, but...

944
01:11:05,137 --> 01:11:07,571
Well, if he does love me, he doesn't...

945
01:11:08,456 --> 01:11:09,969
I can't tell anymore.

946
01:11:12,656 --> 01:11:14,533
Cal, can I ask you something?

947
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:16,644
Yeah, go ahead.

948
01:11:18,376 --> 01:11:20,732
These girls that you always
go around with.

949
01:11:20,816 --> 01:11:24,047
You know, remember there was
that little Mexican girl once.

950
01:11:24,136 --> 01:11:26,013
What are girls like that like?

951
01:11:29,736 --> 01:11:31,807
You don't really love them, do you?

952
01:11:33,657 --> 01:11:36,649
Why do you go out with them?
Is it because you're bad?

953
01:11:38,057 --> 01:11:39,695
You're not angry, are you?

954
01:11:42,577 --> 01:11:45,933
- Well, why do you, then? Are you bad?
- Do you think I'm bad?

955
01:11:48,217 --> 01:11:49,536
I don't know.

956
01:11:50,737 --> 01:11:54,013
I guess I don't know
what is good and what's bad.

957
01:11:54,097 --> 01:11:56,291
I mean, Aron is so good...

958
01:11:56,857 --> 01:11:58,370
and I'm not.

959
01:11:58,457 --> 01:12:00,448
Not good enough for Aron, anyway.

960
01:12:00,537 --> 01:12:02,812
Because sometimes when I'm with Aron...

961
01:12:03,377 --> 01:12:05,686
Aron likes to talk about our being in love...

962
01:12:05,777 --> 01:12:08,337
and think about it
and that's all right, but...

963
01:12:09,457 --> 01:12:12,449
These girls that you go out with, do you...

964
01:12:13,657 --> 01:12:16,171
Maybe I don't know what love is, exactly.

965
01:12:16,897 --> 01:12:20,253
I know love is good the way Aron says...

966
01:12:22,257 --> 01:12:24,533
but it's more than that, it's got to be.

967
01:12:26,618 --> 01:12:28,687
I shouldn't talk to you this way...

968
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,928
but I don't know who else to talk to.

969
01:12:31,497 --> 01:12:33,772
Sometimes I think I'm really bad.

970
01:12:34,937 --> 01:12:37,133
Sometimes I don't know what to think.

971
01:12:39,778 --> 01:12:42,371
- Aron'll knock that out of you.
- Will he?

972
01:12:43,578 --> 01:12:44,693
He's got to.

973
01:12:45,577 --> 01:12:47,534
The way I figure it out...

974
01:12:48,378 --> 01:12:50,414
Aron never having had a mother...

975
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,450
he's made her everything good
that he can think of...

976
01:12:55,098 --> 01:12:56,815
and that's what he thinks I am.

977
01:12:56,898 --> 01:12:59,617
That's who he's in love with.
It's not me at all.

978
01:13:01,258 --> 01:13:04,169
'Cause I'm not a bit like that made-up one.
Not a bit.

979
01:13:04,538 --> 01:13:07,291
I don't mean I think I'm really bad.

980
01:13:10,257 --> 01:13:11,691
Look at that star.

981
01:13:13,178 --> 01:13:15,328
It must be a planet, it's so bright.

982
01:13:16,297 --> 01:13:17,253
Probably.

983
01:13:22,338 --> 01:13:25,296
I bet that girl's waiting for you
down there somewhere.

984
01:13:26,938 --> 01:13:28,656
She can just wait.

985
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:30,571
She was pretty.

986
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:37,171
You've been awfully nice, Cal,
taking care of me.

987
01:13:57,139 --> 01:13:59,447
I love Aron. I do, really I do.

988
01:14:03,579 --> 01:14:05,058
I do.

989
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:11,887
To give these fiends a lesson that...

990
01:14:11,978 --> 01:14:13,412
Have you seen Abra, Mr. Albrecht?

991
01:14:13,498 --> 01:14:14,568
Lies. All lies.

992
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,456
What's the matter with you tonight, Gus?

993
01:14:16,538 --> 01:14:18,097
Gus, come on.

994
01:14:18,698 --> 01:14:20,051
There's Aron.

995
01:14:21,338 --> 01:14:22,931
You're a good shoemaker.

996
01:14:24,939 --> 01:14:26,610
There's Aron, down there.

997
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:28,610
Major, why don't you stay out of politics?

998
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:29,847
Mr. Albrecht.

999
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:33,849
They're pushing him around.
What are they doing?

1000
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,851
That'd kill Dad if he knew that.

1001
01:14:36,938 --> 01:14:39,533
Hey, operator,
when does this thing move again.

1002
01:14:39,619 --> 01:14:40,529
Hey!

1003
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:50,569
Cal, don't!

1004
01:14:50,659 --> 01:14:52,411
Watch yourself, get back!

1005
01:14:53,779 --> 01:14:55,815
Please. Somebody pull him back.

1006
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:58,258
Don't bother me!

1007
01:14:58,339 --> 01:14:59,977
Come on.

1008
01:15:07,099 --> 01:15:10,217
- Gus, come on, have a drink.
- No, Charlie, no drink.

1009
01:15:16,419 --> 01:15:18,057
What are you waiting for?

1010
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:23,054
Mr. Albrecht, calm down.
They're not bad fellows.

1011
01:15:23,139 --> 01:15:25,130
Aron, you are a child.

1012
01:15:30,179 --> 01:15:32,375
All I tried to do was buy him a drink.

1013
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,135
Gustav.

1014
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:36,255
Silence.

1015
01:15:36,339 --> 01:15:39,012
You all loved him a few weeks ago,
what's gotten into you?

1016
01:15:39,099 --> 01:15:41,011
I'm sick of him sticking up
for the Germans.

1017
01:15:41,099 --> 01:15:43,773
- You a friend of the Germans?
- I'm a friend of this German.

1018
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:47,488
There are rose plants in that border there.
Please be careful where you step.

1019
01:15:47,579 --> 01:15:50,731
We liked him. He made us laugh
because of his funny German accent.

1020
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:53,254
Let him read this
in his funny German accent.

1021
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,260
- What is it?
- Let him come down and read it.

1022
01:15:56,339 --> 01:15:59,093
- He doesn't have to read anything.
- I will read it.

1023
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:00,939
Here, give it to me.

1024
01:16:06,059 --> 01:16:08,733
"The Government, with deep regret,
informs..."

1025
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:18,488
"that your son was killed in action,
15th of April."

1026
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,851
"He died a hero and an American."

1027
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:28,850
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopps. I did not...

1028
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,453
You're not sorry enough.

1029
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:33,738
- I don't think he's sorry.
- He's not sorry at all.

1030
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:36,812
- Listen, why don't we all go on home...
- You're not sorry enough.

1031
01:16:36,901 --> 01:16:38,892
Why aren't you in the war?

1032
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:40,618
This will make you sorry.

1033
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:10,894
Hello, Charlie.

1034
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:14,089
Danny, what are you fellows
doing here, anyway?

1035
01:17:14,181 --> 01:17:15,136
Get up.

1036
01:17:15,701 --> 01:17:18,261
Loretta, I didn't expect to find you here.

1037
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:20,060
Evening, Rose.

1038
01:17:21,301 --> 01:17:24,577
Looks like they messed up
your rose garden a little here, Gus.

1039
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:26,778
Somebody owes you an apology.

1040
01:17:34,101 --> 01:17:37,173
How about you folks all going home now?

1041
01:17:37,421 --> 01:17:39,218
I think this'll do for tonight.

1042
01:17:44,421 --> 01:17:46,298
Good evening, Mrs. Albrecht.

1043
01:17:46,981 --> 01:17:48,300
- May I?
- Come in.

1044
01:17:53,221 --> 01:17:56,019
This place will be fixed up
just like it was before.

1045
01:17:56,101 --> 01:17:59,093
- I'm gonna see to it.
- Ja. He will see to it.

1046
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:08,375
Where were you?

1047
01:18:11,102 --> 01:18:12,854
Where did you get his coat?

1048
01:18:24,022 --> 01:18:25,216
You all right?

1049
01:18:26,781 --> 01:18:30,331
You had to start slugging, didn't you?
Were you showing off for her?

1050
01:18:30,742 --> 01:18:32,414
You had to start slugging.

1051
01:18:32,981 --> 01:18:35,894
- I was trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

1052
01:18:36,902 --> 01:18:40,178
If you want to slug people,
do it for yourself and not for me.

1053
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:44,220
- And don't lie to me about trying to...
- Aron, I tried to help you!

1054
01:18:48,942 --> 01:18:52,378
- Great big Aron.
- You finished?

1055
01:18:53,702 --> 01:18:57,695
- No!
- Cal, stop it! Don't.

1056
01:18:57,781 --> 01:18:58,975
- Don't.
- Don't do that.

1057
01:18:59,062 --> 01:19:01,451
- Don't.
- Abra, don't do that!

1058
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:11,611
Wait here.

1059
01:19:49,463 --> 01:19:51,135
I was trying to help him.

1060
01:19:54,142 --> 01:19:56,133
Who am I kidding?

1061
01:19:56,742 --> 01:19:58,461
I tried to kill him.

1062
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:02,376
Mike, give me a drink.

1063
01:20:05,183 --> 01:20:06,775
- Don't drink any more.
- Why?

1064
01:20:06,863 --> 01:20:09,775
- No, please. It's not good for you.
- It's good for me.

1065
01:20:10,103 --> 01:20:14,176
- No, you're gonna get drunk.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get drunk.

1066
01:20:15,822 --> 01:20:18,939
Please forget it, what happened up
on the ferris wheel.

1067
01:20:19,263 --> 01:20:21,492
It didn't mean anything, really.

1068
01:20:21,663 --> 01:20:24,052
Please, forget it. It didn't mean anything.

1069
01:20:25,303 --> 01:20:27,419
Say it didn't. Please, say it didn't.

1070
01:20:30,183 --> 01:20:34,540
Someday he's gonna know
who his real son is.

1071
01:20:35,583 --> 01:20:36,538
What?

1072
01:20:38,303 --> 01:20:39,975
Someday he's gonna know.

1073
01:20:43,263 --> 01:20:45,413
I don't understand you. You scare me.

1074
01:20:48,704 --> 01:20:51,537
- I know. I scare myself.
- Abra.

1075
01:21:10,703 --> 01:21:12,376
Fix me another drink.

1076
01:21:18,424 --> 01:21:22,497
- I want that money. Now you give it to me.
- You know I haven't any money here.

1077
01:21:26,303 --> 01:21:27,258
Okay.

1078
01:21:28,024 --> 01:21:30,743
- When will you get it?
- In the morning, I suppose.

1079
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:34,338
Okay. I'll sleep here.

1080
01:21:36,264 --> 01:21:38,824
Come on. You've gotta go home.

1081
01:21:38,904 --> 01:21:41,020
If you still feel the same way
in the morning...

1082
01:21:41,103 --> 01:21:42,822
you come back, we'll go to the bank...

1083
01:21:42,903 --> 01:21:45,543
and I'll see that you get everything
that's coming to you.

1084
01:21:45,624 --> 01:21:48,980
I'll buy out your share.
I'll go on and make a fortune with it.

1085
01:21:49,944 --> 01:21:54,222
Okay. That seems fair to me, Will.

1086
01:22:19,704 --> 01:22:20,659
Abra.

1087
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:25,339
What?

1088
01:22:26,745 --> 01:22:28,018
- Who is it?
- Cal.

1089
01:22:30,264 --> 01:22:31,334
- Cal?
- Yeah.

1090
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,776
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I want to see you.

1091
01:22:36,745 --> 01:22:38,860
Wait till I put something on.

1092
01:22:56,505 --> 01:22:59,463
I gotta tell you something.
Can you keep a secret?

1093
01:22:59,984 --> 01:23:02,055
Yes. What is it?

1094
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:05,905
What's the matter? You look terrible.

1095
01:23:09,105 --> 01:23:11,255
- I got it.
- What?

1096
01:23:14,104 --> 01:23:17,415
Remember that money? Dad lost?

1097
01:23:17,505 --> 01:23:19,177
On that lettuce business?

1098
01:23:21,865 --> 01:23:25,380
- I got it.
- You mean you earned it all back?

1099
01:23:25,465 --> 01:23:28,138
- I've earned every cent.
- That's wonderful, Cal.

1100
01:23:32,105 --> 01:23:35,461
You got any time off tomorrow
from the hospital?

1101
01:23:37,105 --> 01:23:39,255
I get an hour at lunchtime. Why?

1102
01:23:40,065 --> 01:23:41,703
Thursday's Dad's birthday.

1103
01:23:44,705 --> 01:23:46,776
And I'm gonna give a party for him.

1104
01:23:49,705 --> 01:23:54,415
And I want you and me,
you and Aron and me...

1105
01:23:55,425 --> 01:23:56,858
to be there.

1106
01:23:59,026 --> 01:24:02,462
I'm gonna give him that money
just like it was a birthday present.

1107
01:24:02,985 --> 01:24:05,625
You could come
and help me get some junk...

1108
01:24:05,705 --> 01:24:08,424
- and we could decorate the house.
- Sure.

1109
01:24:09,706 --> 01:24:12,015
And we'll get balloons...

1110
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:18,619
- and all that kid stuff, birthday stuff.
- We can go to the five and 10.

1111
01:24:21,106 --> 01:24:23,381
- Will you do it?
- I'd like to.

1112
01:24:39,506 --> 01:24:42,099
I'm sort of...

1113
01:24:49,426 --> 01:24:50,825
Why did I hit Aron?

1114
01:24:53,386 --> 01:24:55,581
Why did I hit him so hard?

1115
01:25:06,506 --> 01:25:09,020
Will you help me?

1116
01:25:09,106 --> 01:25:11,336
Will you really help me?

1117
01:25:13,506 --> 01:25:14,939
I'll help you, Cal.

1118
01:25:19,746 --> 01:25:20,815
Be careful.

1119
01:25:25,187 --> 01:25:26,620
How'd I get up here?

1120
01:25:37,787 --> 01:25:40,620
- Is your father coming?
- Yeah.

1121
01:25:40,706 --> 01:25:43,619
- Cal, don't get nervous.
- I think it looks beautiful.

1122
01:25:44,107 --> 01:25:45,858
Don't you? I love the way it looks.

1123
01:25:45,946 --> 01:25:48,097
- It looks festive, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

1124
01:25:48,187 --> 01:25:49,779
Yes, Cal, it looks very pretty.

1125
01:25:49,867 --> 01:25:52,175
- Do you think this is childish?
- Not a bit.

1126
01:25:52,267 --> 01:25:55,178
The room looks lovely.
Your father's going to love it.

1127
01:25:56,187 --> 01:25:58,336
- How's the turkey?
- It's a good turkey.

1128
01:25:58,427 --> 01:26:00,497
- Smells ready.
- It'll be ready.

1129
01:26:00,586 --> 01:26:03,784
- Aron didn't get him anything?
- He told me he had something.

1130
01:26:12,147 --> 01:26:14,786
- What?
- He didn't tell me what it was.

1131
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,988
- It won't stack up against mine, will it?
- No.

1132
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:27,185
- Do you wanna see mine?
- I'd like to.

1133
01:26:27,267 --> 01:26:28,825
- I got it wrapped up.
- Show it to me.

1134
01:26:28,907 --> 01:26:29,896
- Wanna see it?
- Yes.

1135
01:26:29,987 --> 01:26:31,022
Okay.

1136
01:26:33,147 --> 01:26:34,500
- You like it?
- It's pretty.

1137
01:26:34,588 --> 01:26:36,100
You think it's pretty?

1138
01:26:37,747 --> 01:26:39,419
Don't drink any more wine.

1139
01:26:42,867 --> 01:26:45,745
- Did Aron tell you what the present was?
- No.

1140
01:26:46,947 --> 01:26:49,700
- You sure?
- Honestly, he didn't.

1141
01:26:50,387 --> 01:26:52,776
I'd tell you if he did. Honestly, I would.

1142
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:57,217
Now everything's gonna go off fine. Here.

1143
01:26:58,867 --> 01:27:00,220
The brooms.

1144
01:27:00,628 --> 01:27:03,095
- Don't you do anything to give me away.
- I wouldn't.

1145
01:27:03,188 --> 01:27:05,782
We'll let him come in
and let the house speak for itself.

1146
01:27:05,867 --> 01:27:09,746
- We'll act like it was any other old day.
- Yes. Wait, Cal.

1147
01:27:12,187 --> 01:27:13,381
Cal.

1148
01:27:17,947 --> 01:27:19,620
You look wonderful.

1149
01:27:21,227 --> 01:27:22,183
Thanks.

1150
01:27:32,028 --> 01:27:33,507
But I need my son.

1151
01:27:33,588 --> 01:27:36,625
It isn't that he doesn't want
to fight for his country. He does.

1152
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:37,982
I need him to work the farm.

1153
01:27:38,068 --> 01:27:40,377
Things can't be as bad as you say,
Mr. Piscora.

1154
01:27:40,468 --> 01:27:42,857
You must be making plenty of money
out of your crops.

1155
01:27:42,948 --> 01:27:46,304
No money. I sold this year's crop
for 5 cents before I even planted it.

1156
01:27:46,388 --> 01:27:47,582
Everything cost so much now.

1157
01:27:47,668 --> 01:27:50,228
And now I got to sell next year crop.
So I need my boy.

1158
01:27:50,308 --> 01:27:52,219
I can do nothing about it, Mr. Piscora.

1159
01:27:52,308 --> 01:27:54,663
In all conscience,
I cannot excuse your son.

1160
01:27:54,748 --> 01:27:57,660
- Come on, Poppa.
- I don't like it.

1161
01:27:58,308 --> 01:28:00,981
I'm telling you. I don't like it.

1162
01:28:05,308 --> 01:28:07,265
Hello, Abra. Nice to see you.

1163
01:28:07,348 --> 01:28:10,465
- Gonna stay to dinner?
- Yes, I am. Is something the matter?

1164
01:28:10,548 --> 01:28:14,302
No, nothing. I guess I shouldn't
have taken that job in the Draft Board.

1165
01:28:14,988 --> 01:28:17,786
- Did you notice the snow on Mount Toro?
- Yes, I saw it.

1166
01:28:17,868 --> 01:28:20,099
Say, that means we got
a good year coming in.

1167
01:28:20,189 --> 01:28:23,545
- We could use it.
- Let's go in.

1168
01:28:43,429 --> 01:28:45,784
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Happy birthday, Mr. Trask.

1169
01:28:45,868 --> 01:28:48,303
Is it possible? I'm very touched.

1170
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:51,585
- Are you surprised?
- I had no idea. I'd forgotten completely.

1171
01:28:51,669 --> 01:28:55,298
- We knew you had, didn't we?
- Completely. I don't know what to say.

1172
01:28:59,069 --> 01:29:00,627
We got turkey.

1173
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:04,145
- And champagne.
- Champagne, and we got all the things.

1174
01:29:06,909 --> 01:29:09,469
- We got the trimmings here.
- Isn't that pretty?

1175
01:29:14,309 --> 01:29:17,346
Got something for you.

1176
01:29:17,429 --> 01:29:20,307
Presents, too. Isn't that nice. Look.

1177
01:29:25,069 --> 01:29:27,345
- Ain't you gonna open it up?
- Yes.

1178
01:29:27,429 --> 01:29:31,628
Dad, Abra and I have one for you, too,
only we can't exactly give it to you.

1179
01:29:33,109 --> 01:29:36,658
I didn't tell Abra I was going to do this,
but we're engaged.

1180
01:29:39,909 --> 01:29:42,787
I couldn't have wished for anything nicer.

1181
01:29:44,230 --> 01:29:47,063
A lovely birthday present.

1182
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:50,464
- You have my blessings.
- Thank you, Dad.

1183
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:54,344
- But you haven't opened Cal's present yet.
- No.

1184
01:29:56,509 --> 01:29:59,422
But I can't imagine having
anything better than this.

1185
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:01,585
Excuse me.

1186
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:07,103
'Course I suspected it right along.
But, Cal, coming on my birthday.

1187
01:30:11,230 --> 01:30:12,344
What's this?

1188
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:15,749
What is this?

1189
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:22,942
I made it. And it's for you.
It's all the money you lost on the lettuce.

1190
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:25,225
You made it? But how?

1191
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:28,419
Go on.

1192
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:31,184
- Beans.
- Beans?

1193
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:35,907
Yes, we bought futures at 5 cents...

1194
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:41,180
and the war came along
and the price went sky-high.

1195
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:45,668
So, that's for you.

1196
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:49,668
It's all the money you lost
in the lettuce business.

1197
01:30:50,911 --> 01:30:52,138
It's for you.

1198
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:56,823
- I made it for you.
- You will have to give it back.

1199
01:30:59,230 --> 01:31:03,907
No, I made it for you, Dad.
I want you to have it.

1200
01:31:04,591 --> 01:31:07,741
- You will have to give it back.
- Who? I can't give it...

1201
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:11,380
- To the people you got it from.
- No, the British Purchasing Agency?

1202
01:31:11,471 --> 01:31:14,144
- I can't give it back.
- Give it to the farmers you robbed.

1203
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:15,743
We didn't rob anybody, Dad.

1204
01:31:15,831 --> 01:31:19,506
We paid 2 cents a pound,
2 cents over market for that stuff.

1205
01:31:20,391 --> 01:31:23,747
I sign my name
and boys go out and some die...

1206
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,421
and some live helpless
without arms and legs.

1207
01:31:26,511 --> 01:31:28,342
Not one will come back untorn.

1208
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:31,704
Do you think I could take
a profit from that?

1209
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:36,865
I don't want the money, Cal!
I couldn't take it!

1210
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:40,149
- I thank you for the thought, but...
- I'll keep it for you.

1211
01:31:40,231 --> 01:31:42,983
I'll wrap it up
and we'll just keep it in here...

1212
01:31:43,071 --> 01:31:44,424
I'll never take it!

1213
01:31:44,511 --> 01:31:47,708
Son, I'd be happy if you'd give me...

1214
01:31:47,791 --> 01:31:50,749
something like your brother's given me.

1215
01:31:50,831 --> 01:31:54,619
Something honest and human and good.
Don't be angry, Son.

1216
01:31:55,431 --> 01:31:58,309
If you want to give me a present,
give me a good life.

1217
01:31:58,431 --> 01:32:00,342
That's something I could value.

1218
01:32:28,031 --> 01:32:29,384
I hate you!

1219
01:32:46,711 --> 01:32:48,384
What are you doing?

1220
01:32:54,511 --> 01:32:56,662
He doesn't want anything from me.

1221
01:32:57,072 --> 01:32:58,300
Cal, don't.

1222
01:33:00,912 --> 01:33:02,061
Please, don't.

1223
01:33:10,872 --> 01:33:11,827
Abra!

1224
01:33:32,672 --> 01:33:34,583
Don't you ever touch her again.

1225
01:33:37,232 --> 01:33:38,551
I don't trust you.

1226
01:33:41,312 --> 01:33:42,540
You're no good.

1227
01:33:43,472 --> 01:33:47,385
You're mean and vicious and wild.
And you always have been.

1228
01:33:47,752 --> 01:33:49,504
You know it, too, don't you?

1229
01:33:49,873 --> 01:33:52,262
Father and I have put up
with every vicious thing...

1230
01:33:52,353 --> 01:33:56,345
you could think of since you were a child.
And we've always forgiven you.

1231
01:33:56,912 --> 01:33:59,187
But now I don't want you to go near Abra.

1232
01:33:59,272 --> 01:34:02,389
I don't want you to talk with her.
Just stay away from her!

1233
01:34:29,033 --> 01:34:31,752
- You want to go some place with me?
- Why should I?

1234
01:34:34,953 --> 01:34:36,705
I got something to show you.

1235
01:34:38,193 --> 01:34:41,822
- Think you'll find it very interesting.
- What are you talking about?

1236
01:34:42,913 --> 01:34:46,110
Maybe our mother didn't die
and go to heaven after all, Aron.

1237
01:34:46,793 --> 01:34:49,626
- What do you mean by that?
- Maybe she didn't.

1238
01:34:49,713 --> 01:34:51,510
Maybe she's alive someplace.

1239
01:34:53,553 --> 01:34:55,145
What are you up to now?

1240
01:34:55,233 --> 01:34:58,669
Remember when we were kids,
we used to make up stories about her?

1241
01:34:59,274 --> 01:35:03,789
You said she must have looked
like heaven's youngest angel, remember?

1242
01:35:04,993 --> 01:35:07,189
Remember that time I shot that rabbit?

1243
01:35:07,873 --> 01:35:09,750
You cried and you said...

1244
01:35:09,873 --> 01:35:12,865
that she would have cried, too,
'cause she was so tenderhearted.

1245
01:35:12,953 --> 01:35:15,672
And you said I was bad,
you remember that?

1246
01:35:16,633 --> 01:35:19,989
I just want to show you something.
It's not gonna take very long.

1247
01:35:20,073 --> 01:35:21,347
What's the matter, you afraid?

1248
01:35:21,433 --> 01:35:23,789
I'm not afraid to look at anything
you could show me.

1249
01:35:23,873 --> 01:35:27,832
Can you look at the truth, just once?

1250
01:35:30,153 --> 01:35:34,466
Come on, you can look
at the truth just once. Can't you?

1251
01:35:35,953 --> 01:35:36,909
Come on.

1252
01:35:38,594 --> 01:35:41,505
I want to show you something.
It won't take very long.

1253
01:36:15,234 --> 01:36:16,383
Oh, Cal.

1254
01:36:18,514 --> 01:36:19,469
Hello.

1255
01:36:42,955 --> 01:36:47,312
Mother, this is your other son, Aron.

1256
01:36:49,395 --> 01:36:51,625
Aron is everything that's good, Mother.

1257
01:37:00,195 --> 01:37:02,026
Say hello to your mother.

1258
01:37:16,154 --> 01:37:18,066
Say hello to your mother, Aron!

1259
01:37:19,155 --> 01:37:21,430
Joe!

1260
01:37:32,955 --> 01:37:34,866
- Play another song!
- Quiet!

1261
01:37:37,355 --> 01:37:38,344
Five!

1262
01:37:38,835 --> 01:37:42,510
"I'm thinking of the lilac trees
that shook their purple plumes"

1263
01:37:43,595 --> 01:37:46,713
"I'm thinking of the rivulet
with its cool and silvery flow"

1264
01:37:47,276 --> 01:37:51,109
"Of the old gray rock that shadowed it
and the peppermint below"

1265
01:37:56,715 --> 01:37:59,992
- Where is Aron?
- I don't know. I'm not my brother's keeper.

1266
01:38:00,075 --> 01:38:01,667
- Where did you go?
- For a ride.

1267
01:38:01,755 --> 01:38:03,871
- What did you quarrel about?
- You.

1268
01:38:04,195 --> 01:38:06,914
- You're angry about the money.
- No, I'm not angry.

1269
01:38:07,235 --> 01:38:09,066
I like it. I think it's great.

1270
01:38:09,795 --> 01:38:11,831
I'm gonna go away
and take that money with me.

1271
01:38:11,915 --> 01:38:15,306
I think I'll start me a little business.
Just like my mother did.

1272
01:38:15,396 --> 01:38:19,355
- What do you know about your mother?
- I know where she is and what she is.

1273
01:38:19,435 --> 01:38:22,154
And I know why she left you.
Couldn't stand it.

1274
01:38:22,675 --> 01:38:25,395
You didn't really love her
any more than you do me.

1275
01:38:26,076 --> 01:38:28,510
Because of your goodness, your rightness.

1276
01:38:28,595 --> 01:38:31,235
You never gave either one of us
an inch, ever...

1277
01:38:31,315 --> 01:38:33,067
from what you thought was right.

1278
01:38:33,156 --> 01:38:36,909
You kept on forgiving us,
but you never really loved us.

1279
01:38:37,716 --> 01:38:39,707
I know why you didn't love me.

1280
01:38:39,796 --> 01:38:41,194
Because I'm like my mother...

1281
01:38:41,276 --> 01:38:44,109
and you never forgave yourself
for having loved her.

1282
01:38:46,196 --> 01:38:50,030
I'm not gonna forgive him.
I'm never gonna forgive him.

1283
01:38:50,115 --> 01:38:54,507
- Where is Aron?
- He's with her, with his mother.

1284
01:38:55,356 --> 01:38:57,745
She's over there in Monterey,
if you want to know.

1285
01:38:57,836 --> 01:38:59,588
She owns one of them houses.

1286
01:39:00,996 --> 01:39:03,590
I took Aron there tonight
because I was jealous.

1287
01:39:04,516 --> 01:39:08,634
I've been jealous all my life.
Jealous, I couldn't even stand it.

1288
01:39:12,956 --> 01:39:15,231
Tonight, I even tried to buy your love.

1289
01:39:17,276 --> 01:39:19,232
But now I don't want it anymore.

1290
01:39:21,796 --> 01:39:25,391
- I can't use it anymore.
- Don't talk to your father like that.

1291
01:39:29,037 --> 01:39:31,231
I don't want any kind of love anymore.

1292
01:39:33,076 --> 01:39:34,509
It doesn't pay off.

1293
01:39:35,037 --> 01:39:36,789
No future in it.

1294
01:39:39,196 --> 01:39:40,869
Let him go if he wants to.

1295
01:39:45,717 --> 01:39:47,469
No, I won't.

1296
01:39:59,796 --> 01:40:01,549
You hate me, too, don't you?

1297
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,350
I'm afraid of you.

1298
01:40:09,236 --> 01:40:12,707
What you did to Aron tonight,
I don't know what it will do to him.

1299
01:40:15,197 --> 01:40:17,665
I feel like I'm to blame, too.

1300
01:40:19,157 --> 01:40:23,912
- Adam!
- Here. What is it?

1301
01:40:23,997 --> 01:40:26,875
...drunk and had a couple of fights.
He's gone kind of crazy.

1302
01:40:26,957 --> 01:40:29,755
He's at the station now.
Wait, I'll drive you down in my car.

1303
01:40:29,837 --> 01:40:30,872
Cal!

1304
01:40:37,357 --> 01:40:39,951
- What happened between you and Aron?
- Why?

1305
01:40:40,037 --> 01:40:43,075
He's gone kind of crazy.
He's drunk and had a couple of fights...

1306
01:40:43,157 --> 01:40:45,273
and seemed determined
to get himself hurt.

1307
01:40:45,357 --> 01:40:47,269
He's leaving on that troop train tonight...

1308
01:40:47,357 --> 01:40:49,747
and says he's gonna enlist tomorrow
at King City.

1309
01:40:49,837 --> 01:40:53,273
Adam's on his way down there now
to talk to him before the train leaves.

1310
01:40:53,358 --> 01:40:55,666
I think you better get down there.

1311
01:40:56,757 --> 01:40:58,555
- Yeah.
- My car's downstairs.

1312
01:41:55,278 --> 01:41:57,473
Do you know what a stroke is, exactly?

1313
01:42:01,638 --> 01:42:04,676
This one is a leakage of blood in the brain
caused by shock.

1314
01:42:04,758 --> 01:42:06,829
There have been earlier, smaller leakages.

1315
01:42:06,918 --> 01:42:09,796
The left side is paralyzed,
and the right side partly.

1316
01:42:10,398 --> 01:42:12,992
In other words,
your father is nearly helpless.

1317
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:17,195
- Will he die?
- He might live a week or a year.

1318
01:42:17,958 --> 01:42:19,471
He might die tonight.

1319
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:29,389
- Will he know me?
- You'll have to find that out for yourself.

1320
01:42:33,879 --> 01:42:35,278
Good day.

1321
01:42:37,279 --> 01:42:40,588
Good day, Doctor. Good day, Sam.

1322
01:42:42,519 --> 01:42:45,316
"Cain rose up against his brother Abel,
and slew him."

1323
01:42:45,839 --> 01:42:49,798
"And Cain went away and dwelt
in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."

1324
01:42:51,799 --> 01:42:54,312
Now why don't you go away some place?

1325
01:43:08,119 --> 01:43:10,997
- He's right.
- No.

1326
01:43:12,879 --> 01:43:15,313
Yes, he is. He's right. That's what I'll do.

1327
01:43:24,959 --> 01:43:27,109
Who's gonna wash these things for me?

1328
01:43:28,919 --> 01:43:29,988
Thank you.

1329
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:34,116
- There you are.
- How is he?

1330
01:43:34,199 --> 01:43:37,032
He's fine. He's my darling.

1331
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:38,916
Washed his face, combed his hair.

1332
01:43:38,999 --> 01:43:40,513
Can I go in there now?

1333
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,315
Just for a minute. I want him to rest.
Gotta get lots of sleep.

1334
01:43:46,199 --> 01:43:49,828
- How is he, really?
- Haven't I seen you at the hospital?

1335
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,629
- Not part of the family, are you?
- No.

1336
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:54,038
I didn't think so.

1337
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:57,237
I can tell you,
I won't have this job for long.

1338
01:43:57,319 --> 01:44:01,359
That's my luck. Always seem to get them
when they're old and ready to die off.

1339
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:19,359
Now doesn't he look nice?
He's going to be a darling patient.

1340
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,594
Even tried to smile at me,
didn't you, my dear?

1341
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,595
- I don't want you to tire my patient.
- Please go.

1342
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:28,638
Now listen, miss,
don't you try to order me about.

1343
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:31,151
I'll report you to the doctor.

1344
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:33,994
Will you go out of the room
and shut the door?

1345
01:45:08,041 --> 01:45:08,995
Father.

1346
01:45:12,281 --> 01:45:13,554
Can you hear me?

1347
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,718
I did an awful thing.

1348
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:25,755
I'm sorry.

1349
01:45:59,041 --> 01:46:01,032
Mr. Trask, can you hear me?

1350
01:46:02,081 --> 01:46:04,720
Is it just Cal you won't answer?

1351
01:46:05,281 --> 01:46:06,634
Can you answer?

1352
01:46:08,801 --> 01:46:10,996
I think you can understand me, though.

1353
01:46:11,841 --> 01:46:15,390
I think behind your eyes
you're just as alert as ever.

1354
01:46:16,481 --> 01:46:19,439
You understand everything I say
only you can't show it.

1355
01:46:26,762 --> 01:46:30,437
Excuse me, Mr. Trask,
for daring to speak to you this way...

1356
01:46:30,841 --> 01:46:34,914
but it's awful not to be loved.
It's the worst thing in the world.

1357
01:46:37,042 --> 01:46:39,476
Don't ask me how I know that.
I just know it.

1358
01:46:39,802 --> 01:46:43,350
It makes you mean and violent and cruel.

1359
01:46:43,441 --> 01:46:46,195
And that's the way
Cal has always felt, all his life.

1360
01:46:47,482 --> 01:46:50,473
I know you didn't mean it to be that way,
but it's true.

1361
01:46:52,201 --> 01:46:56,753
You never gave him your love.
You never asked him for his.

1362
01:46:57,961 --> 01:46:59,997
You never asked him for one thing.

1363
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:04,677
Cal is going away, Mr. Trask.
But before he goes...

1364
01:47:06,882 --> 01:47:10,716
He did something very bad,
and I'm not asking you to forgive him.

1365
01:47:11,162 --> 01:47:13,915
You have to give him some sign
that you love him...

1366
01:47:14,241 --> 01:47:16,073
or else he'll never be a man.

1367
01:47:16,762 --> 01:47:20,835
He'll just keep on feeling guilty
and alone, unless you release him.

1368
01:47:22,402 --> 01:47:23,721
Please, help him.

1369
01:47:24,242 --> 01:47:27,791
I love Cal, Mr. Trask,
and I want him to be whole and strong...

1370
01:47:27,882 --> 01:47:30,396
and you're the only one who can do it.

1371
01:47:30,482 --> 01:47:32,279
So try, please try.

1372
01:47:34,162 --> 01:47:37,234
If you could ask him for something.

1373
01:47:38,002 --> 01:47:40,800
Let him help you so that he knows
that you love him.

1374
01:47:41,682 --> 01:47:43,274
Let him do for you.

1375
01:47:46,603 --> 01:47:51,313
Excuse me, Mr. Trask, for daring
to speak to you this way, but I just had to.

1376
01:47:56,842 --> 01:47:57,912
You've tired my patient...

1377
01:47:58,002 --> 01:48:01,438
and I most certainly shall report it
to the doctor in the morning.

1378
01:48:03,642 --> 01:48:07,397
You don't know that he accuses you.
You don't know what he's thinking about.

1379
01:48:07,683 --> 01:48:10,322
Stop it, Cal.
You gonna cry for the rest of your life?

1380
01:48:10,402 --> 01:48:11,881
- No.
- Then stop it.

1381
01:48:12,643 --> 01:48:15,634
Go in there and talk to him
before it's too late.

1382
01:48:15,722 --> 01:48:18,476
- I can't.
- Please try.

1383
01:48:19,162 --> 01:48:20,437
Get it straight.

1384
01:48:21,442 --> 01:48:25,402
Get through to him, somehow.
Please try, Cal, before it's too late.

1385
01:48:31,803 --> 01:48:35,556
- Is there any coffee around here?
- I'll get you some in a minute.

1386
01:48:41,123 --> 01:48:42,112
Try.

1387
01:48:43,402 --> 01:48:45,598
Is there anything to read around here?

1388
01:48:47,043 --> 01:48:48,476
What would you like?

1389
01:48:48,563 --> 01:48:52,396
- Something to get my mind off my feet.
- There's something in there.

1390
01:49:06,923 --> 01:49:10,518
I tried to believe it was born in me...

1391
01:49:10,603 --> 01:49:14,199
and that I couldn't help it,
but that's not so.

1392
01:49:16,483 --> 01:49:17,882
A man has a choice.

1393
01:49:18,123 --> 01:49:21,082
You used to say that was where
he was different from an animal.

1394
01:49:21,163 --> 01:49:22,677
You see, I remember.

1395
01:49:22,763 --> 01:49:26,312
A man has a choice,
and the choice is what makes him a man.

1396
01:49:28,563 --> 01:49:30,122
You see, I do remember.

1397
01:49:30,563 --> 01:49:34,112
- Look, I can't find any coffee.
- Get out!

1398
01:49:44,524 --> 01:49:45,478
Look.

1399
01:49:53,483 --> 01:49:56,600
Do something...

1400
01:49:58,724 --> 01:49:59,873
for me.

1401
01:49:59,964 --> 01:50:01,192
Yes.

1402
01:50:05,164 --> 01:50:08,076
That woman...

1403
01:50:08,684 --> 01:50:12,836
the nurse, can't stand her.

1404
01:50:14,964 --> 01:50:16,556
Get me another.

1405
01:50:31,764 --> 01:50:33,720
I can't stand her, either.

1406
01:51:23,965 --> 01:51:25,284
What did he say?

1407
01:51:31,725 --> 01:51:35,001
He said, "Don't get anybody else."

1408
01:51:36,485 --> 01:51:38,919
He said, "You stay with me..."

1409
01:51:40,245 --> 01:51:41,917
"and you take care of me."
