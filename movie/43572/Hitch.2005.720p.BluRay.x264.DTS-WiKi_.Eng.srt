1
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,897
Basic principles:

2
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:49,061
No woman wakes up saying:

3
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:52,330
"God, I hope I don't get
swept off my feet today."

4
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,804
Now, she might say,
"This is a really bad time for me."

5
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:06,282
Or something like, "I just need some space."

6
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:10,451
Or my personal favorite:

7
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:13,288
"I'm really into my career right now."

8
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:18,956
You believe that? Neither does she.

9
00:01:19,134 --> 00:01:23,002
You know why?
Because she's lying to you, that's why.

10
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:26,265
You understand me? Lying.

11
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:30,840
It's not a bad time for her.
She doesn't need any space.

12
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:32,844
She may be into her career...

13
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:36,644
but what she's really saying is,
"Get away from me now."

14
00:01:37,052 --> 00:01:39,612
Or possibly, "Try harder, stupid."

15
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:44,420
Well, which one is it?

16
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:48,758
60% of all human communication
is nonverbal.

17
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:50,621
Body language.

18
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:52,757
30% is your tone.

19
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:56,998
So that means that
90% of what you're saying...

20
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,605
ain't coming out of your mouth.

21
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:03,670
Toby!

22
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:06,305
Shit!

23
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:07,712
Of course she'll lie to you.

24
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:10,613
She's a nice person,
she doesn't wanna hurt your feelings.

25
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,347
What else is she gonna say?
She doesn't even know you.

26
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:14,546
Yet.

27
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:20,225
Luckily, the fact is
that just like the rest of us...

28
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:24,731
even a beautiful woman doesn't know
what she wants until she sees it.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,661
And that's where I come in.

30
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:28,963
My job is to open her eyes.

31
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:32,805
Oh, my God!

32
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:39,069
Is this what you're looking for?

33
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:43,082
Basic principles: No matter what,
no matter when, no matter who...

34
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:46,710
any man has a chance
to sweep any woman off her feet.

35
00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:48,919
Just needs the right broom.

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,664
You cannot use what you do not have.

37
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:03,761
So if you're shy, be shy.
If you're outgoing, be outgoing.

38
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:06,339
- I'm not outgoing.
- That's okay.

39
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:09,899
She may not want the whole truth,
but she does want the real you.

40
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:13,412
She may not want to see it all at once,
but she does want to see it.

41
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:18,349
So tonight, when you're wondering what
to say, how you look, or if she likes you...

42
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:21,422
just remember, she is already out with you.

43
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:25,920
That means she said yes
when she could have said no.

44
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:30,063
That means she made a plan
when she could have just blown you off.

45
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:34,259
So that means it is no longer your job
to try to make her like you.

46
00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:37,337
It is your job not to mess it up.

47
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:43,202
The shoes are hot.
You went to the place I told you?

48
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:47,839
Yeah, but I don't think they're really me.

49
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:51,683
"You" is a very fluid concept right now.

50
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:55,347
You bought the shoes.
You look great in the shoes.

51
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:57,254
That's the you I'm talking about.

52
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:02,859
The key tonight is hang back.

53
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:05,924
Give her plenty of space.

54
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:09,593
If she lingers at a photograph, move on.

55
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:13,564
But maintain the visual.

56
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:22,280
It's supposed to be 64 and clear tonight.
So when you leave the club, walk a little.

57
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,715
Ask her what she thought about the show...

58
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,549
what was her favorite photograph,
why that one.

59
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:31,057
And when she answers,
don't be looking at her mouth.

60
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:33,821
Don't be wondering
what she looks like naked.

61
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:37,420
Listen to what she is saying and respond.

62
00:04:37,832 --> 00:04:40,323
Listen and respond.

63
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:42,799
That way, when it's your turn to talk...

64
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:45,839
you'll have something better to say than,
"I like your mouth."

65
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:48,238
What was your favorite one?

66
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,137
The elephant, definitely.

67
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,941
And all of a sudden,
we're on date number two.

68
00:04:57,786 --> 00:04:58,946
Ready.

69
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,154
No way.

70
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:10,922
We're going back in there.
You have to smile.

71
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:14,827
In case you didn't go to high school,
hitting is a good thing.

72
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,495
So how does it happen, great love?

73
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,663
Are you okay?

74
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:20,434
- Nobody knows.
- I'm good.

75
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:23,875
Let me get a Bomb Pop
and a Screwball for the lady.

76
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:28,278
But what I can tell you,
is that it happens in the blink of an eye.

77
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:33,143
One moment, you're enjoying your life.

78
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:37,451
And the next, you're wondering
how you ever lived without them.

79
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,786
Three dates is all I need.

80
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:45,355
Three dates, and I'll get you here,
to the high-stakes medal round...

81
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,492
where eight out of 10 women
believe that the first kiss...

82
00:05:48,603 --> 00:05:52,471
will tell them everything they need to know
about the relationship.

83
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,370
After that, you're on your own.

84
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,905
But always remember...

85
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:30,234
life is not the amount of breaths you take.

86
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:34,939
It's the moments that take your breath away.

87
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:41,619
Did I call it or did I call it?

88
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:43,916
I mean, what did I say, six months?

89
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:45,788
And when was her first date?

90
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:48,919
So five-and-a-half?
God, I hate it when I'm right.

91
00:06:49,064 --> 00:06:52,693
What is it about guys that makes them
want to screw anything that walks...

92
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:56,134
even when they're going out with
someone as awesome as Allegra Cole?

93
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:59,035
She's only the most fabulous thing
walking around New York.

94
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,198
Thanks, Young.

95
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:02,606
Are you kidding?
Of course I'm gonna run it.

96
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:06,144
Why should she waste her heart
on some Swedish aristo-brat?

97
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:08,249
Even if he is gorgeous.

98
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:10,083
If he's stupid enough to cheat...

99
00:07:10,185 --> 00:07:12,619
the world should know
he's dumb enough to get caught.

100
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:15,154
Exactly. I'm in the elevator.
See you in a minute.

101
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,417
Good morning, how are you?

102
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,590
Bitter, party of one.

103
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,224
You should try it sometime.

104
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,595
Barbados by myself?
I wouldn't last five minutes.

105
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,497
It was just what the doctor ordered.

106
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:31,093
I slept in, I did my yoga,
I read a couple of books...

107
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:32,901
flirted with my scuba instructor.

108
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:36,101
- And apparently never left the office.
- I know, isn't that great?

109
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:38,338
You should've taken someone with you.

110
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,607
Who am I gonna take with me?

111
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:42,979
This is where a boyfriend comes in handy.

112
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:47,578
- I don't have time for a boyfriend.
- You said that two years ago.

113
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:50,658
Yes, and it's as true today as it was then.

114
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:52,686
I thought you were on vacation.

115
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:56,160
See if these are in focus
and have them in my desk in an hour.

116
00:07:56,297 --> 00:08:00,666
Besides, relationships are for people
waiting for something better to come along.

117
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:03,100
Spoken like a true cynic.

118
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:05,336
I'm not a cynic. I'm a realist.

119
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:09,933
You are a realist masquerading as a cynic
who is secretly an optimist.

120
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:12,672
What are you doing here?
What is she doing here?

121
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:14,338
She works here, remember?

122
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:17,110
No, she doesn't. Not for another four days.

123
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:19,015
- This couldn't wait.
- It could.

124
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:21,019
What are you doing? Go back to the beach.

125
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:23,989
- I don't want you here.
- No, really, you do.

126
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,117
You are becoming
a sick, workaholic lunatic...

127
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:28,923
and this is exactly...

128
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,194
the kind of nervous, overwrought behavior
that leads to...

129
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:36,167
Pictures of Sebby with a busty brunette.

130
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:39,201
A very big raise.

131
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:42,808
Jesus. You could find dirt in a snowstorm.

132
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:44,844
Comes with the job.

133
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:49,643
You know, kiddo, there is more to life
than watching other people live it.

134
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:52,550
Can I help he was cheating on my beach?

135
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:55,212
I think it's great
that you're so good at your job.

136
00:08:55,356 --> 00:08:57,984
I'm just a little worried as to why.

137
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:01,452
Let me worry about that.

138
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,822
Okay. I want that column on my desk
by lunch.

139
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:06,298
So you'll pay for my hotel?

140
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:09,837
For you to sip mai tais?
I don't think so. Get out.

141
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,749
- Come on.
- What?

142
00:09:23,885 --> 00:09:25,318
- That's good, right?
- No.

143
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,012
No, it was in and it freaked out.

144
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:31,148
You know what your problem is, Hitch?
You're all about the short game.

145
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,059
You pick your shots
based on what you see first...

146
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:39,729
not what's necessarily best for you...

147
00:09:40,902 --> 00:09:42,529
in the long run.

148
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:47,673
All of us are not married to the woman
of our dreams and about to have a baby.

149
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,336
You know, I'm very happy for you.
Just not meant for everybody.

150
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:54,381
So please just leave me to my hot, sweaty...

151
00:09:54,482 --> 00:09:57,713
totally varied, wildly experimental
short game.

152
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,919
- I was talking about pool, but whatever.
- Yeah, okay.

153
00:10:02,056 --> 00:10:04,786
Honestly, I just hope one day
you're able to experience...

154
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:08,623
the unconditional love, trust,
and openness...

155
00:10:08,763 --> 00:10:10,628
that I share with Grace every single day.

156
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:14,394
- Is this really barroom talk?
- You need to listen to me. I'm serious.

157
00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:17,198
Because when you get to a place
with a woman like that...

158
00:10:17,305 --> 00:10:19,136
it's so beyond anything physical that...

159
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:21,936
when I think back to
when I used to run around with you...

160
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:25,045
and chase all these really gorgeous
but shallow women...

161
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:30,116
I don't know, it's kind of ridiculous
and vaguely pathetic.

162
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:40,284
Yeah, I see what you mean. That's pathetic.

163
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:46,131
So, how'd you meet him?

164
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:49,168
I was in La Perla
just buying some weekend thongs.

165
00:10:49,304 --> 00:10:51,829
- And he was doing likewise?
- No.

166
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:55,242
Actually, he said he was buying something
for his mom.

167
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:56,640
His mom?

168
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:59,607
Casey, who buys high-priced lingerie
for their mother?

169
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:02,012
Well, maybe he was looking for a robe.

170
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,684
Casey, he was hitting on you while
he was buying lingerie for another woman.

171
00:11:07,722 --> 00:11:11,351
- I prefer the mother story.
- I know you do, but that's not the point.

172
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:14,757
No, the point is I'm not gonna start out
assuming the guy's a liar.

173
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:17,490
- Why not?
- Because that's how you wind up...

174
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,825
Like me? Is that what you were gonna say?

175
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:23,437
No. I was gonna say, "Like you."

176
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:25,772
- What's his name?
- Why?

177
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,641
- I'm gonna Google him.
- No. Google your own guy.

178
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:30,711
Let's just see if his mother's still alive.

179
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:33,780
- So when is Grace due again?
- Soon.

180
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:36,775
- You excited?
- What'd you say?

181
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:39,679
Do you want me to go get them
and bring them over here?

182
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:40,981
No, don't do that.

183
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:45,116
Are you saying you don't wanna talk to them
because you can't go home with them?

184
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:47,456
I'm just trying to keep my head above water.

185
00:11:47,562 --> 00:11:50,292
- Have you heard of the Date Doctor?
- Urban myth.

186
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:51,660
- Really?
- Absolutely.

187
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:53,393
I was hoping he also helped women.

188
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:56,560
Casey, you're not sick. You're single.

189
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:59,170
You just have to relax and enjoy the ride.

190
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:01,503
I haven't been ridden in months.

191
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:09,539
On that happy note, I'm gonna go see
if anybody interesting came in tonight.

192
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:11,879
- You mean, besides me.
- Right.

193
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,509
Bye.

194
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:16,021
I'll go get those girls,
bring them over here...

195
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:18,354
and we'll have a conversation
like human beings.

196
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:22,190
Then you're gonna home,
and I'll take them back to my apartment.

197
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:26,756
Well, that sounds like fun for me.
But you might want to get in line, pal.

198
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:29,768
- Hey, girl.
- Hey, how are you?

199
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:35,737
Hey, baby, can I get a couple Coronas
at the pool table, please? Thanks.

200
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:37,242
Excuse me.

201
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:41,745
Lime wedges in the bottle's fine.

202
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:44,249
Hey, asshole, I don't work here.

203
00:12:48,556 --> 00:12:53,493
I'm sorry. The paramedics will have to come
to get my foot out of my mouth, sweetheart.

204
00:12:53,594 --> 00:12:55,892
Just don't let it happen again.

205
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,555
- I knew you didn't work here.
- You did?

206
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:02,157
How else was I supposed to get you away
from all those guys?

207
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,168
Why would you want to do that?

208
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,076
Some guys naturally develop a comfort
with the opposite sex.

209
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:13,111
They like women, women like them.
Everything flows naturally.

210
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:17,509
Back in college, I was just not one of them.

211
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:24,891
I seemed to lack the basic understanding...

212
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:27,552
that my peers just intuitively grasped.

213
00:13:27,662 --> 00:13:32,224
But like any late bloomer,
I was eager to make up for lost time.

214
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,197
Her name was Cressida Baylor.

215
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:42,301
Can you tell me
where the registration building is?

216
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:48,247
And my life would never be the same.

217
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:50,817
- I'm Alex.
- Cressida.

218
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:56,554
What we had was beautiful.

219
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:03,762
I love you.

220
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:08,297
I love you so much.

221
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:11,168
I love you, too, Alex.

222
00:14:17,545 --> 00:14:20,605
I know you don't love me
as much as I love you.

223
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:24,583
But that's okay.
I'm just glad you love me at all.

224
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:28,018
In retrospect,
I guess I may have come on a little strong.

225
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:34,626
But the experience taught me a lot.

226
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:36,026
Cressida!

227
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:41,596
What are you doing?

228
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:43,101
I'm sorry, Alex.

229
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:47,607
But I love you. What did I do wrong?
Just tell me what I did wrong.

230
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:49,867
You're doing it right now.

231
00:14:50,878 --> 00:14:52,505
Alex, I'm sorry.

232
00:14:56,083 --> 00:15:00,281
And it's an education
I feel obliged to pass on to my fellow men.

233
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:08,322
Because with no guile and no game,
there's no girl.

234
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,357
If ever a man born was without game...

235
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:14,993
it was Albert Brennaman.

236
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:45,329
My business is 100% referral
and, thus far, untraceable.

237
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:47,264
And if there's one thing I've learned...

238
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:51,098
when you orchestrate, coordinate,
and otherwise mess with fate...

239
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:53,707
it's best to fly under the radar.

240
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:34,145
I hope she's single
'cause I don't do break-ups.

241
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:36,250
Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

242
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,808
Yeah, no.
I mean, she just got out of a relationship.

243
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:43,314
Is that a problem?
Because if it is, that's fine.

244
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:45,755
I'm a little uncomfortable with this anyway.

245
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,092
Definitely been hurt a lot.
I had a lot of bad experiences.

246
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:53,655
Some good ones.
But definitely a lot of bad ones.

247
00:16:54,368 --> 00:16:58,464
I'm desperate, basically.
I mean, not in general, you understand?

248
00:16:58,606 --> 00:17:02,303
You know, not just for anybody.
But, man, for her... Yeah.

249
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:05,143
Why don't you tell me about her?

250
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,407
Let's see, what can I say?

251
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:12,413
My company handles her finances.
I'm her tax consultant.

252
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:16,252
Well, I'm one of them.
I'm the junior man on the account.

253
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:18,791
- So does she know you're interested?
- No.

254
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:24,123
Alive?

255
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,666
I lent her my pen once.

256
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:29,466
Shoot. Does anyone have a pen?

257
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:33,095
- Here, take mine.
- Albert, you're crushing my arm.

258
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:35,732
Sorry about that. Here you go, Allegra.

259
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:41,642
Allegra? As in Allegra Cole?

260
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:44,512
Yeah, I realize that I'm not her usual type.

261
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:48,452
Well, her last boyfriend owned Sweden
or something.

262
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:50,285
And that guy was a bum.

263
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:53,451
He didn't seem like
a very nice person to me.

264
00:17:54,495 --> 00:17:56,520
You swing for the fence.

265
00:17:56,697 --> 00:18:00,098
Look, you don't think I tried
talking myself out of this?

266
00:18:00,201 --> 00:18:04,035
I mean, you don't think I know
how ridiculous this is? I know, okay?

267
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:07,607
I just thought that maybe with your help...

268
00:18:09,677 --> 00:18:13,670
You know what?
I'm really sorry I wasted your time.

269
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:27,151
Hold on a second, Albert.

270
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:33,793
You know what it's like
getting up every morning feeling hopeless?

271
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:37,493
Feeling like the love of your life
is waking up with the wrong man?

272
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:42,508
But at the same time,
hoping that she still finds happiness...

273
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,843
even if it's never gonna be with you?

274
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:50,012
You are flat-out...

275
00:18:50,885 --> 00:18:54,048
out of your mind. You know that?

276
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,391
That's good.

277
00:19:00,528 --> 00:19:01,688
It is?

278
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,996
You ever heard of Michelangelo?

279
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:07,329
Heard of the Sistine Chapel?

280
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:10,336
Michelangelo.

281
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:12,830
Sistine Chapel.

282
00:19:13,073 --> 00:19:14,836
You saying you can do this?

283
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:18,503
My name is Alex Hitchens.
Let's go paint that ceiling.

284
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,475
Take it easy.

285
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:52,278
Oh, my God!

286
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:40,683
Well, it looks like I'm still rich.

287
00:20:44,331 --> 00:20:48,665
But what I would really like,
and what I was wondering is...

288
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,031
if I could have $500,000
to invest on my own.

289
00:20:56,043 --> 00:21:00,139
And what were you thinking
of investing in, Allegra?

290
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:06,279
Well, it's something
that I really have a passion for.

291
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,691
Daydreams are for private time.

292
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:17,293
When you're in the room, be in the room.

293
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:21,027
Concentrate. Focus.
Women respond when you respond to them.

294
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:24,068
My friend Maggie is a talented designer.

295
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:28,839
I've seen the business plan
and the samples look fantastic.

296
00:21:29,877 --> 00:21:33,973
And I would really like to get involved.

297
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:40,247
I'll tell you what.

298
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:45,051
Let us come up with a range of investments
that we think you might be interested in...

299
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:48,787
and next month,
we'll run the whole lot of them by you.

300
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:52,888
Okay.

301
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:55,524
Fine. Thank you. All right, gentlemen.

302
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,664
Let's go over this one more time.
What is the objective?

303
00:21:58,772 --> 00:22:00,205
Shock and awe.

304
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:03,208
That was shockingly awful.
What is the objective?

305
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:04,504
Shock and awe.

306
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:06,978
What is the objective?

307
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:10,579
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, Albert?

308
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:21,491
I don't really agree with that.

309
00:22:21,595 --> 00:22:24,086
You don't really agree with what?

310
00:22:30,771 --> 00:22:34,172
I think if you want to invest $500,000
in your friend's business...

311
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:35,764
that's exactly what you should do.

312
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:38,707
You don't need us to tell you what to do.

313
00:22:38,812 --> 00:22:41,872
We're a board of advisers,
not your kindergarten teachers.

314
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:44,212
If you want to be taken seriously
as an adult...

315
00:22:44,318 --> 00:22:46,684
then start taking yourself seriously
as an adult...

316
00:22:46,787 --> 00:22:49,756
instead of asking for permission
to invest your own money...

317
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,586
from a boardroom
full of your daddy's golf buddies.

318
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:54,455
- That's quite enough!
- I'm not finished.

319
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:58,793
I'd like to see anybody in this room
handle the attention and publicity...

320
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:02,595
that she's had to deal with her whole life,
with half her class.

321
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:09,035
We should be taking advice from you,
Miss Cole. Not the other way around.

322
00:23:09,143 --> 00:23:11,907
- Sit down...
- No! You know what? I quit!

323
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:23,654
Oh, my God.

324
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:36,497
Just breathe. How'd it go?

325
00:23:36,637 --> 00:23:40,164
I yelled at her. I screamed at my boss!
I quit my job!

326
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,471
- What?
- You said...

327
00:23:42,843 --> 00:23:45,403
- I gotta go back.
- No, I didn't tell you to quit.

328
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:47,275
Relax. Okay, listen, we're fine.

329
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:49,849
- Would you let me go?
- Albert, no!

330
00:23:51,218 --> 00:23:54,085
Just relax! Okay?

331
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:57,988
- Just let it marinate for a second. Trust me.
- No!

332
00:24:08,302 --> 00:24:10,327
Relax.

333
00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:12,598
- It's Allegra Cole.
- Answer it.

334
00:24:12,706 --> 00:24:16,267
- Could I speak to you a second?
- Answer the door, Albert.

335
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:21,976
Yes. Hi.

336
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,149
What's up?

337
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:26,385
Listen, Albert, right?

338
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:32,158
- People don't usually talk to me like that.
- Close your mouth, man.

339
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:34,853
Let me rephrase that.

340
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:37,828
People never talk to me like that.

341
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:40,627
Stand up.

342
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:43,498
I guess it's kind of scary for them.

343
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:48,206
But that's why I really appreciate
what you did in there.

344
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,510
But I was wondering...

345
00:24:51,612 --> 00:24:55,844
do you think that you and I could
get together sometime this week?

346
00:24:57,918 --> 00:25:00,580
You know, to go over things.

347
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:03,318
Financial things.

348
00:25:03,423 --> 00:25:07,553
I'd like to see the areas
where I can afford to take some risks.

349
00:25:07,694 --> 00:25:10,026
- Check your schedule.
- I'll check my schedule.

350
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,566
Great. Let me give you my number.
Do you have a pen?

351
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:15,894
I don't think I have one.

352
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:22,571
- Yes, I do.
- Great.

353
00:25:34,788 --> 00:25:36,585
And call me Allegra.

354
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:41,890
- You're done.
- Goodbye.

355
00:25:45,632 --> 00:25:46,929
Good job.

356
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:50,861
Oh, damn.

357
00:26:12,326 --> 00:26:16,729
She's some kind of newspaper columnist.
Comes in here once in a while. Great tipper.

358
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,888
What's her drink?

359
00:26:17,998 --> 00:26:21,297
Usually beer.
Tonight, Grey Goose martini, dirty.

360
00:26:31,612 --> 00:26:32,636
Hi.

361
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:36,276
I noticed your glass was getting low...

362
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,283
so I took the liberty
of bringing you another apple martini.

363
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:40,408
Thank you.

364
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,547
And I couldn't help but notice
you look a lot like my next girlfriend.

365
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,616
- What's your name?
- They call me Chip.

366
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:49,922
You can't get them to stop?

367
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:52,292
That was funny.

368
00:26:52,432 --> 00:26:55,924
Listen, I understand the courage it takes
to walk across a room...

369
00:26:56,036 --> 00:26:58,561
and try to generate a relationship
out of thin air.

370
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:02,472
- So don't take the following personally.
- You have fantastic eyes.

371
00:27:03,877 --> 00:27:05,811
Thanks. Try to listen.

372
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:09,905
This is no reflection on you.
I'm just not interested.

373
00:27:10,217 --> 00:27:12,685
But thank you for the compliment
of coming over.

374
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:15,686
You're welcome.
So do you like Cuban food?

375
00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:20,358
Chip, seriously, that was not code for,
"I wish you'd try harder."

376
00:27:20,494 --> 00:27:24,624
Are you always so shut-down and afraid
that the right man might make you...

377
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:26,824
Feel like a natural woman?

378
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:30,831
Sorry I'm late, honey.
I couldn't get a cab. How was the meeting?

379
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:34,634
Well, there was a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

380
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:37,043
Nice to meet you, Chip.

381
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:43,680
You, too.

382
00:27:46,753 --> 00:27:49,381
On the one hand,
it is very difficult for a man...

383
00:27:49,523 --> 00:27:52,219
to even speak to someone
who looks like you.

384
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:55,556
But on the other hand,
should that be your problem?

385
00:27:55,696 --> 00:27:58,187
So life's kind of hard all around.

386
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:01,164
Not if you pay attention.

387
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:04,971
You're sending all the right signals:

388
00:28:05,072 --> 00:28:08,530
No earrings, heels under two inches,
your hair is pulled back...

389
00:28:08,675 --> 00:28:12,304
wearing reading glasses with no book,
drinking a Grey Goose martini...

390
00:28:12,412 --> 00:28:15,677
which means you had a hell of a week
and a beer just wouldn't do it.

391
00:28:15,782 --> 00:28:17,147
If that wasn't clear enough...

392
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,380
there's always the "fuck off"
that you have stamped on your forehead.

393
00:28:21,521 --> 00:28:25,821
Who'd believe there's a man out there
that can sit by a woman he doesn't know...

394
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:30,022
and genuinely be interested in who she is,
what she does, without his own agenda?

395
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,065
I wouldn't even know
what that would look like.

396
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:35,224
So what would a guy like that say?

397
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:38,770
He'd say, "My name is Alex Hitchens
and I'm a consultant."

398
00:28:38,905 --> 00:28:40,736
But she wouldn't be interested in that...

399
00:28:40,874 --> 00:28:43,342
because she'd be counting the seconds
until he left.

400
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:45,934
Thinking he was like every other guy.

401
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,276
Which, life experience has taught her,
is a virtual certainty.

402
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:52,214
But then he'd ask her name
and what she did for a living...

403
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,514
and she might blow him off.

404
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:56,518
Or she might say...

405
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:04,963
I'm Sara Melas.
I run the gossip column at the Standard.

406
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:08,067
And then he'd ask
all these penetrating questions about her...

407
00:29:08,168 --> 00:29:11,399
because he was sincerely,
if atypically, interested.

408
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:12,563
No.

409
00:29:12,939 --> 00:29:15,373
- No?
- He'd be interested.

410
00:29:16,777 --> 00:29:18,938
But he'd see that there was no way...

411
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:22,879
he could possibly make her realize
that he was for real.

412
00:29:22,983 --> 00:29:28,114
Well, he could be funny and charming
and refreshingly original.

413
00:29:28,955 --> 00:29:30,422
Wouldn't help.

414
00:29:30,524 --> 00:29:33,652
- Don't you hate it when that happens?
- Not really.

415
00:29:33,794 --> 00:29:37,491
They'd both probably go on
to lead the lives they were headed toward.

416
00:29:37,631 --> 00:29:40,429
My guess is they'd do just fine.

417
00:29:42,536 --> 00:29:45,596
It's a pleasure to have met you, Sara Melas.

418
00:29:50,644 --> 00:29:54,102
Grey Goose martini
from the gentleman who just left.

419
00:29:59,486 --> 00:30:01,078
Is that for me?

420
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,016
What?

421
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:22,537
Vance Munson. Sorry I'm late.

422
00:30:23,543 --> 00:30:26,444
No, not a problem.

423
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:29,478
Wow, you're the...

424
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:34,148
- Can I get you something to drink, Mr...
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

425
00:30:34,254 --> 00:30:36,119
So, tell me about her.

426
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,287
Have you ever met someone...

427
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:43,191
and you knew right away
she was gonna be important to you?

428
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,731
Not just because of her looks,
but that X factor.

429
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:49,291
How'd you meet her?

430
00:30:49,402 --> 00:30:52,803
Actually, I was in a shop
buying pajamas for my mom.

431
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:54,806
And by that, of course, you mean...

432
00:30:54,908 --> 00:30:57,843
you were buying lingerie
for another woman.

433
00:30:59,212 --> 00:31:02,841
Yes. You can't help
where you meet somebody.

434
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,075
And the lingerie is for a woman
I'm no longer seeing.

435
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:09,086
But anyway, the girl I met,
the one I was talking about...

436
00:31:09,222 --> 00:31:11,918
she's so sweet, funny, Southern.

437
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:15,084
She gives me her number.
Now she won't return my phone calls.

438
00:31:15,228 --> 00:31:18,891
I don't know what it is about her.
I just can't get her out of my mind.

439
00:31:19,032 --> 00:31:23,059
You know, food has lost its taste.
Colors, they seem dull.

440
00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:26,934
Things that used to matter...
I don't know, they just no longer do.

441
00:31:27,073 --> 00:31:30,042
I think things aren't gonna snap back
unless I...

442
00:31:31,945 --> 00:31:33,674
Unless I bang her.

443
00:31:35,882 --> 00:31:37,247
Excuse me?

444
00:31:38,985 --> 00:31:42,443
You know, bang her. Clear my head.
Get in, get off, get out.

445
00:31:45,225 --> 00:31:48,524
I think you may have misunderstood
what I do exactly.

446
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:51,358
No, I was told you help guys get in there.

447
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:53,398
Right. But, see, here's the thing.

448
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,901
My clients actually like women.

449
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:02,073
Hit it and quit it is not my thing.

450
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:06,111
Let me make one thing clear to you, rabbi.
I need professional help.

451
00:32:06,246 --> 00:32:09,044
Well, that is for damn certain.

452
00:32:09,482 --> 00:32:14,044
And I'm glad you can admit it
because generally that's the hardest part.

453
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,118
You see what I'm doing?
This is what I'm about.

454
00:32:21,027 --> 00:32:23,291
Power suit, power tie, power steering.

455
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:27,457
People can wince, cry, beg,
but eventually they do what I want.

456
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:31,462
So that's, like, a metaphor.

457
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,907
Well, I'm more of a literal kind of guy.

458
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,807
So when I do this...

459
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:45,113
this is more like me saying
that I will literally break your shit off...

460
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:48,085
if you ever touch me again. Okay, pumpkin?

461
00:32:48,188 --> 00:32:49,416
Got it.

462
00:32:57,464 --> 00:32:59,432
No.

463
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:03,798
Pablo, I can't just mention your restaurant.
Somebody has to eat there.

464
00:33:03,903 --> 00:33:06,838
No, somebody famous. You know that.

465
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,767
- Sara Melas?
- No.

466
00:33:09,676 --> 00:33:11,268
Okay. Bye.

467
00:33:13,346 --> 00:33:15,177
I need your signature.

468
00:33:29,396 --> 00:33:34,060
I hate it when a guy calls a girl
who did not give him her number.

469
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,634
So this is me not calling. Over.

470
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:39,705
Yes, you're right.
This is much less invasive.

471
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:42,706
I've been thinking about
that sign on your forehead.

472
00:33:42,842 --> 00:33:46,835
And I was wondering if you'd mind
taking it down for dinner Friday night. Over.

473
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,579
I can't. I have a couple of parties
I have to hit.

474
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:52,912
Gossip never sleeps.

475
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,411
Not till about 4:00 a.m.

476
00:33:55,922 --> 00:33:57,219
Saturday.

477
00:34:00,226 --> 00:34:01,716
I have a date.

478
00:34:03,263 --> 00:34:06,164
Do you know the definition
of "perseverance," Miss Melas?

479
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:08,359
An excuse to be obnoxious?

480
00:34:08,535 --> 00:34:10,526
Continuing in a course of action...

481
00:34:10,637 --> 00:34:14,903
without regard to discouragement,
opposition or previous failure. Over.

482
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:17,368
Okay, Webster, how do I get rid of you?

483
00:34:17,477 --> 00:34:20,446
Breakfast, Sunday.
And you can barely even call that a date.

484
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,448
You do that with out-of-town relatives
that you don't even like. Over.

485
00:34:28,455 --> 00:34:29,717
Come on.

486
00:34:32,225 --> 00:34:34,591
Okay, I guess I could do Sunday.

487
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:37,527
You forgot to say "over." Over.

488
00:34:37,997 --> 00:34:41,057
This conversation's over
as soon as you tell me when and where.

489
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:44,136
7:00 a.m., North Cove Marina. Over and out.

490
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:48,472
7:00 a.m.? Are you crazy?
I don't do 7:00 a.m.

491
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:51,808
- Hello?
- Sign here.

492
00:34:52,245 --> 00:34:53,872
- What?
- You said Sunday, right?

493
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,106
Yeah.

494
00:34:58,084 --> 00:35:00,552
What if I would have said Friday?

495
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:01,881
Sunday.

496
00:35:06,092 --> 00:35:08,822
So I guess you're not going to church.

497
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:24,337
Do you really expect me to wear this?

498
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:28,404
Lt'll be awful cold out there without it.

499
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:31,643
- Good morning.
- "Good" would have been at 10:00.

500
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:38,353
You're a lot taller than I remember.

501
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:40,425
You ever ride one of these?

502
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:42,188
Not on the Hudson.

503
00:35:42,328 --> 00:35:45,320
So, what do you wanna do?
Race me around the Statue of Liberty?

504
00:35:45,465 --> 00:35:47,092
If there's time.

505
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:50,162
- But you might need these.
- All right.

506
00:35:50,303 --> 00:35:51,668
- Bam.
- Wow.

507
00:35:52,872 --> 00:35:54,362
How do I look?

508
00:35:55,642 --> 00:35:56,939
Fabulous.

509
00:35:58,745 --> 00:36:00,474
All right, I give.

510
00:36:01,314 --> 00:36:02,941
Where do I change?

511
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:08,513
So we'll go past the wall, then take a left.
It's pretty much a straight shot from there.

512
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:11,886
- Straight shot to where?
- That's for me to know and you to find out.

513
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:13,686
What you do with these babies is...

514
00:36:13,827 --> 00:36:17,024
Yeah, what I do with this baby
is kick your ass.

515
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:31,602
- What happened? You change your mind?
- It just died.

516
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:34,399
Did you put gas in it?

517
00:37:34,974 --> 00:37:38,933
No. You know, I think it must have
sucked up a diaper or something.

518
00:37:39,045 --> 00:37:41,513
Gross. Try it again.

519
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:46,910
You want me to call AAA?

520
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,511
Come on around
and let me hop on with you.

521
00:37:49,656 --> 00:37:53,353
I don't know. What if you break mine, too?
Then we'll both be sitting ducks.

522
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:57,156
- I didn't break it. It just died.
- Yeah, yeah.

523
00:37:57,297 --> 00:37:59,288
All right, hop on.

524
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,664
- Scoot back.
- Hitch, I'm already here.

525
00:38:04,237 --> 00:38:06,000
But you don't know where we're going.

526
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:08,835
Why don't you tell me?
Then we'll both know.

527
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:13,271
Man, male egos.

528
00:38:13,379 --> 00:38:16,212
I don't know how you guys
make it through the day with them.

529
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:18,442
What? It is not my ego.

530
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:21,315
I just don't want to ruin the surprise.

531
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:34,161
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

532
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:39,204
There. I always keep a few of those around.

533
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:40,363
Thank you.

534
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:44,465
I have lower back trouble.
I just shove the ice packs right down there.

535
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:46,911
No. That's a fresh one.

536
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:50,476
So, Ellis Island.

537
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,880
I have to admit, I have lived in New York
my whole life and I've never been here.

538
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:56,545
I figured that. Most people haven't.

539
00:38:56,689 --> 00:38:59,249
So I got my man Larry here
to set us up a private tour.

540
00:38:59,392 --> 00:39:01,383
- Great!
- Anything for Hitch.

541
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:06,260
It was originally known as Oyster Island.

542
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:09,061
The island was expanded
to its present size...

543
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:13,332
with dirt removed during the construction
of the New York subway system.

544
00:39:14,073 --> 00:39:15,665
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

545
00:39:15,775 --> 00:39:19,006
- Did you know this?
- Yeah. That's why I brought you here.

546
00:39:19,112 --> 00:39:23,913
In fact, over 100 million Americans
can trace their ancestry...

547
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:28,077
back to a single man, woman, or child
on the ship's manifest...

548
00:39:28,221 --> 00:39:30,246
to an inspector's ledger.

549
00:39:30,823 --> 00:39:35,783
By 1910, 75%% of the residents of New York...

550
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:39,227
Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Boston...

551
00:39:39,332 --> 00:39:42,130
were immigrants,
or the children of immigrants.

552
00:39:42,268 --> 00:39:45,795
They generally lived
in the poorest sections of the cities...

553
00:39:45,938 --> 00:39:50,034
in Little Italys, Chinatowns
and other ethnic enclaves.

554
00:39:50,443 --> 00:39:52,638
It's called The Kissing Post.

555
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:57,548
The plaque explains how different cultures
kiss after long absences.

556
00:39:58,451 --> 00:40:01,750
Now, what exactly would qualify
as a long absence?

557
00:40:02,288 --> 00:40:03,653
I mean...

558
00:40:04,524 --> 00:40:06,958
- That count?
- No.

559
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:14,796
I actually had a relative come through here.

560
00:40:15,368 --> 00:40:16,892
- Really?
- Yeah.

561
00:40:19,105 --> 00:40:20,231
What?

562
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,303
- What?
- What was that thing?

563
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:28,947
No. You know, I was just thinking...

564
00:40:29,382 --> 00:40:33,250
you can't really know where you're going
until you know where you've been.

565
00:40:33,352 --> 00:40:36,253
- Ain't that right, Larry?
- Amen, brother.

566
00:40:36,456 --> 00:40:39,983
That's kind of deep for a first date,
don't you think?

567
00:40:43,463 --> 00:40:44,930
What is that?

568
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:05,279
Oh, my God!

569
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:16,523
That's my great-great-grandfather.
That's his signature.

570
00:41:16,662 --> 00:41:18,653
Jesus, it's right here!

571
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:23,726
How did you know?

572
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,696
Hitch did the search. I just found the page.

573
00:41:51,397 --> 00:41:52,728
I'm sorry.

574
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:05,272
I saw that going differently in my mind.

575
00:42:07,713 --> 00:42:12,173
So my family never saw him again.
Well, except for on the Wanted posters.

576
00:42:12,552 --> 00:42:14,918
Look, I'm really sorry.

577
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:19,380
When I saw it on the computer,
it said, "the Butcher of Cadiz."

578
00:42:21,093 --> 00:42:25,860
I thought it was a profession,
not a headline.

579
00:42:27,266 --> 00:42:31,930
It's just one of those horrible family legacies
we've all tried to forget.

580
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:34,103
But thank you.

581
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,571
No, it was...

582
00:42:35,675 --> 00:42:37,768
- A train wreck.
- No.

583
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,377
Let me get you a cab.

584
00:42:44,183 --> 00:42:45,445
Thanks.

585
00:42:47,753 --> 00:42:49,653
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

586
00:42:59,465 --> 00:43:00,591
Taxi!

587
00:43:04,303 --> 00:43:06,863
Poor guy.
Sounds like he went to a lot of trouble.

588
00:43:06,973 --> 00:43:11,808
It was fun. In a disastrous kind of way.
I mean, this isn't exactly a hickey.

589
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:16,073
At least you got a good story
out of it, right?

590
00:43:18,517 --> 00:43:19,575
Right?

591
00:43:19,685 --> 00:43:23,246
- You should try mine, it's great.
- Wait. You're seeing him again?

592
00:43:24,824 --> 00:43:28,590
Well, look, you said that
I'm always expecting men...

593
00:43:28,694 --> 00:43:31,754
to let me down, right?
Assuming that they're gonna fail?

594
00:43:31,864 --> 00:43:33,331
Which he did.

595
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:37,158
Yeah, but he did it with flair.

596
00:43:39,405 --> 00:43:42,203
I mean, Case, he really tanked.

597
00:43:42,308 --> 00:43:44,538
And that's a desirable trait?

598
00:43:45,311 --> 00:43:48,109
Yeah. Weird, huh?

599
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,244
Now, just keep it simple.
Just like we practiced.

600
00:43:53,386 --> 00:43:54,876
We're just leaving a message.

601
00:43:54,987 --> 00:43:58,218
Women like Allegra Cole
don't pick up numbers they don't recognize.

602
00:44:01,761 --> 00:44:02,921
Hello?

603
00:44:03,562 --> 00:44:05,291
She's on the phone!

604
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,868
- Yes. Hello, Miss Cole?
- Yeah.

605
00:44:09,969 --> 00:44:12,062
Hi, I have Albert Brennaman for you.

606
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:14,639
- One moment, please.
- No. Tell her I'm at lunch.

607
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,675
We called her to tell her you're at lunch?

608
00:44:22,315 --> 00:44:26,376
Allegra. Hi, it's Albert Brennaman.

609
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,147
Hi, how are you?

610
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:31,585
Good. I'm doing good.

611
00:44:31,991 --> 00:44:35,051
The reason I'm calling
is about our appointment this Wednesday.

612
00:44:35,728 --> 00:44:37,525
Not gonna be able to make it.

613
00:44:38,631 --> 00:44:40,724
Well, when can you make it?

614
00:44:41,367 --> 00:44:42,800
When can I do it?

615
00:44:46,272 --> 00:44:49,571
I don't even know,
because my whole next week is slammed.

616
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:52,971
Right. But it's all good.

617
00:44:55,381 --> 00:44:58,009
No, we're gonna make it happen though,
that's for sure.

618
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:00,516
We're going to make it happen. Yes.

619
00:45:09,295 --> 00:45:10,762
What's going on over there?

620
00:45:10,863 --> 00:45:13,263
Just moving some things around.

621
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:16,631
Sky Studios.

622
00:45:16,736 --> 00:45:20,137
Tonight I'm actually going
to this fashion thing at Sky Studios.

623
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:21,501
Designer friend.

624
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,701
I just thought it might be something
your designer friend would be interested in.

625
00:45:25,845 --> 00:45:27,176
Yeah, definitely.

626
00:45:27,313 --> 00:45:31,044
Well, great.
Then I will put you back on with my...

627
00:45:49,668 --> 00:45:51,966
- Allegra, over here, please.
- Miss Cole, this way.

628
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:53,402
Great. One more.

629
00:45:53,506 --> 00:45:56,634
- Hi, there.
- This was a fantastic idea.

630
00:45:56,942 --> 00:45:59,308
I suppose. Hey, where's Maggie?

631
00:45:59,845 --> 00:46:01,369
Late as usual.

632
00:46:03,549 --> 00:46:07,315
Tonight I want you to meditate
on the image of an iceberg.

633
00:46:07,686 --> 00:46:09,517
Do you know why I want you to do that?

634
00:46:09,789 --> 00:46:11,484
Because I'm cool?

635
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,421
- No.
- I know, I'm not.

636
00:46:14,193 --> 00:46:16,058
I'm saying that you are an iceberg...

637
00:46:16,195 --> 00:46:20,188
in that over 90%% of your mass
is below the surface.

638
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,993
I know I'm heavy. I am.

639
00:46:23,102 --> 00:46:26,538
I'm talking about who you are.
It's a metaphor.

640
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:28,004
Accounting, business...

641
00:46:28,107 --> 00:46:32,703
all of that is just a small part
of a much deeper, richer Albert.

642
00:46:33,946 --> 00:46:35,243
One more.

643
00:46:36,615 --> 00:46:37,912
It's gonna be loud in there...

644
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,678
so this is our opportunity
to break the touch barrier...

645
00:46:40,786 --> 00:46:42,048
in a non-sleazy way.

646
00:46:42,154 --> 00:46:45,180
So get to where it's loudest.
Ask her if she'd like a drink.

647
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:47,725
Lean in, place your hand
on the small of her back...

648
00:46:47,827 --> 00:46:49,624
and say it in her ear like a secret.

649
00:46:49,762 --> 00:46:53,163
Watch your hand placement.
Too high says, "I just wanna be friends."

650
00:46:53,265 --> 00:46:55,631
Too low says, "I just wanna grab some ass."

651
00:46:56,735 --> 00:46:59,363
Friends. Ass. Me.

652
00:47:04,643 --> 00:47:07,134
Special issues: Allegra Cole is a celebrity...

653
00:47:07,279 --> 00:47:10,737
which means that when people talk to her,
they'll ignore you completely.

654
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,613
She's classy, so she'll introduce you.

655
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:16,278
When she does, shake hands hard
and speak up. Let them know you're there.

656
00:47:16,388 --> 00:47:18,253
Show her you can handle being her escort.

657
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:21,554
- Egon, this is Albert.
- How you doing?

658
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,990
- Albert, this is Zak.
- Nice to see you.

659
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,295
These guys are friends with Maggie.

660
00:47:26,532 --> 00:47:29,592
- Been to that new Brazilian restaurant?
- No, but I am...

661
00:47:29,702 --> 00:47:32,296
It's disgusting.
I'm writing an article about it.

662
00:47:33,472 --> 00:47:35,599
Did you see the new installation at MOMA?

663
00:47:35,841 --> 00:47:38,571
- Yes, did you think...
- Disgusting.

664
00:47:40,179 --> 00:47:43,410
Women can always tell
when you're not being real with them.

665
00:47:43,716 --> 00:47:47,208
Worst thing you can do is try to fake it,
because you are a great guy.

666
00:47:47,553 --> 00:47:50,920
And you do have something
to offer Allegra that no other man does.

667
00:47:51,824 --> 00:47:53,291
What was your name? Eggnog?

668
00:47:55,127 --> 00:47:56,253
Egon.

669
00:47:56,762 --> 00:48:00,698
What do you think of the design of the Jets'
new football stadium on the West Side?

670
00:48:01,233 --> 00:48:03,531
Let me guess. Disgusting?

671
00:48:04,436 --> 00:48:06,336
Think it over. We'll be back.

672
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:11,869
Thank you. I can't stand those guys.

673
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:14,206
Really? I kind of liked them.

674
00:48:14,346 --> 00:48:16,143
But when all is said and done...

675
00:48:16,348 --> 00:48:18,942
tonight is not about Allegra.

676
00:48:19,752 --> 00:48:22,448
- It's not?
- No. Tonight is about Maggie.

677
00:48:22,821 --> 00:48:26,780
A woman's best friend has to sign off
on all big relationship decisions.

678
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:28,654
So you can't afford to mess this up.

679
00:48:28,761 --> 00:48:31,229
Albert, I want you to meet
my friend, Maggie.

680
00:48:31,764 --> 00:48:34,597
Hi, Maggie.
It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.

681
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:36,098
I'm Maggie.

682
00:48:37,036 --> 00:48:40,164
- No, you're not.
- Actually, I am.

683
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,075
Magnus Forester.
Thank you so much for inviting us.

684
00:48:46,345 --> 00:48:48,472
- You have very soft hands.
- Thank you.

685
00:48:50,783 --> 00:48:53,183
- Wow. So do you.
- Thank you.

686
00:48:53,285 --> 00:48:57,221
So tonight, you focus on one thing
and one thing only.

687
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:58,488
Maggie.

688
00:48:58,657 --> 00:49:02,184
- Where does your inspiration come from?
- Oh, my God.

689
00:49:03,062 --> 00:49:04,586
Anything I see.

690
00:49:05,064 --> 00:49:08,761
Something in a magazine,
out on the street...

691
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:10,459
in an old movie.

692
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:15,065
The receptive nature of the creative facility
just astounds me.

693
00:49:15,908 --> 00:49:17,466
Anybody want any spring rolls?

694
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:20,909
That's a beautiful tie, by the way.
This whole thing, it just works.

695
00:49:21,247 --> 00:49:22,612
Thank you.

696
00:49:24,283 --> 00:49:27,047
- Is he gay?
- I don't think so.

697
00:49:28,721 --> 00:49:29,710
I like him.

698
00:49:29,822 --> 00:49:34,555
About the deejay.
Generally, I have a firm no-dancing policy.

699
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,561
But if she asks, you cannot say no.

700
00:49:37,663 --> 00:49:40,530
I'm not worried about dancing.
But if there are people there...

701
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:45,093
I'm sorry, I hate to be a stickler,
but I need to be thorough.

702
00:49:46,338 --> 00:49:48,863
Show me what you mean
by you're not worried about it.

703
00:49:48,974 --> 00:49:51,204
Trust me. You know what I'm gonna do.

704
00:49:54,313 --> 00:49:56,406
That's what it's all about, right there.

705
00:49:57,149 --> 00:49:58,446
See how it gets bigger?

706
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,244
Now I'm gonna start the fire.

707
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:07,389
But the feet are going.
I start the fire, I make the pizza.

708
00:50:07,693 --> 00:50:08,955
Hips are always going.

709
00:50:10,663 --> 00:50:11,925
Can't get enough hip.

710
00:50:12,164 --> 00:50:14,632
From there, the Q-Tip.

711
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:19,034
Q-Tip. Throw it away.

712
00:50:19,772 --> 00:50:21,797
That's not working, hit them with this.

713
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:33,313
Don't ever...

714
00:50:34,253 --> 00:50:35,345
do that again.

715
00:50:37,056 --> 00:50:38,216
Do you hear me?

716
00:50:39,058 --> 00:50:40,923
- Just expressing myself.
- No.

717
00:50:42,394 --> 00:50:45,591
Not like that, you're not, all right?

718
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,033
This is where you live.

719
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:52,335
Right here.

720
00:50:52,438 --> 00:50:55,430
You live right here, okay? This is home.

721
00:50:56,075 --> 00:50:57,099
None of this.

722
00:50:57,743 --> 00:50:59,404
I don't wanna see none of that.

723
00:50:59,511 --> 00:51:01,604
Don't need no pizza. They got food there.

724
00:51:09,822 --> 00:51:12,916
Elbows, 6 inches from the waist,
90-degree angles.

725
00:51:13,492 --> 00:51:15,756
Don't you bite your lip. Stop it.

726
00:51:35,447 --> 00:51:38,439
Women relate dancing to sex, all right?

727
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,542
Even a great dancer can lose it
with one of these.

728
00:51:42,654 --> 00:51:45,214
Okay, now that's what I need to be learning.

729
00:51:56,335 --> 00:51:57,632
Can't stop it.

730
00:51:58,303 --> 00:52:00,168
You cannot stop it.

731
00:52:02,608 --> 00:52:03,768
Next subject.

732
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:06,867
Get out.

733
00:52:12,017 --> 00:52:13,245
Thanks.

734
00:52:13,685 --> 00:52:15,778
So, are you a Knicks fan?

735
00:52:17,823 --> 00:52:19,518
When they're good.

736
00:52:26,064 --> 00:52:28,225
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, God. Why?

737
00:52:29,535 --> 00:52:31,901
- She was there?
- I left you a bunch of messages.

738
00:52:32,404 --> 00:52:34,031
My phone fell in the Hudson.

739
00:52:34,173 --> 00:52:35,538
Yeah, well, it gets worse.

740
00:52:39,478 --> 00:52:40,536
I don't believe this.

741
00:52:40,646 --> 00:52:44,582
- I thought he was a bodyguard.
- I'm the only one who will need protection.

742
00:52:44,983 --> 00:52:47,383
- Max is gonna...
- Gonna be really irritated.

743
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,512
When I got the train this morning,
I thought it was gonna be a good day.

744
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:54,959
Who the hell is Albert Brennaman?

745
00:52:55,494 --> 00:52:58,691
- Tell me how this happened.
- What? There were some photographers.

746
00:52:58,831 --> 00:53:00,890
Does this even look like dancing to you?

747
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,200
That's just a little bit of me being me.

748
00:53:03,335 --> 00:53:07,897
No, that's you being a lot of something
you don't need to ever be again.

749
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,764
- It's just one dance.
- No.

750
00:53:10,442 --> 00:53:14,936
One dance, one look, one kiss.
That's all we get, Albert.

751
00:53:15,147 --> 00:53:17,809
Just one shot to make the difference...

752
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:20,407
between happily ever after and:

753
00:53:20,652 --> 00:53:24,281
"Oh, he's just some guy
I went to some thing with once."

754
00:53:25,257 --> 00:53:26,246
All right?

755
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,660
- What?
- You said "kiss."

756
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:38,859
Is that a problem?

757
00:53:39,771 --> 00:53:42,399
It's not a problem, but this is Allegra Cole.

758
00:53:42,508 --> 00:53:44,840
Eight out of 10 women believe
that the first kiss...

759
00:53:44,943 --> 00:53:47,969
will tell them everything they need to know
about a relationship.

760
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,516
And believe me,
she has definitely thought about it.

761
00:53:51,984 --> 00:53:54,316
- She has?
- Of course.

762
00:53:54,419 --> 00:53:58,048
Not that she's gonna act on it.
So it's no real big deal.

763
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:01,282
- All right, it's no big deal then.
- It's a very big deal!

764
00:54:01,393 --> 00:54:02,860
- Huge.
- Monumental!

765
00:54:02,961 --> 00:54:04,929
You are not listening...

766
00:54:06,398 --> 00:54:08,525
I need you to wrap your head around this.

767
00:54:08,634 --> 00:54:11,432
Tomorrow night, Allegra Cole...

768
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:15,433
could have her last first kiss.

769
00:54:26,418 --> 00:54:28,716
All right, come on,
just show me what you got.

770
00:54:29,555 --> 00:54:32,217
- What do you mean?
- Just show me how you would kiss me.

771
00:54:32,991 --> 00:54:34,151
I wouldn't kiss you.

772
00:54:34,626 --> 00:54:36,059
I'm not me, I'm Allegra.

773
00:54:38,931 --> 00:54:40,558
But you're really not, so...

774
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:44,534
Okay, Albert, end of the night,
you're dropping me off at home.

775
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:47,364
- Show me the magic.
- I'm not comfortable with this.

776
00:54:47,472 --> 00:54:51,067
God, Albert,
I had such a wonderful time with you.

777
00:54:51,176 --> 00:54:52,871
Yeah, how about those Knicks?

778
00:54:53,845 --> 00:54:58,407
You see what I'm doing?
This is a signal. I'm fiddling with my keys.

779
00:54:58,517 --> 00:55:00,109
A woman that doesn't want a kiss...

780
00:55:00,252 --> 00:55:03,085
takes her keys out, puts them in the door,
goes in the house.

781
00:55:03,188 --> 00:55:05,281
A woman that wants to kiss, she fiddles.

782
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:07,990
I'm fiddling.

783
00:55:08,126 --> 00:55:09,957
Okay, you have a good night now...

784
00:55:11,296 --> 00:55:13,526
- You see what I'm doing?
- Robbing me?

785
00:55:13,632 --> 00:55:14,690
No.

786
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:17,797
This is what most guys do.
They rush in to take the kiss.

787
00:55:18,136 --> 00:55:19,694
But you're not most guys.

788
00:55:20,505 --> 00:55:24,601
See, the secret to a kiss
is to go 90%% of the way...

789
00:55:25,744 --> 00:55:26,938
and then hold.

790
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:34,111
- For how long?
- As long as it takes...

791
00:55:34,686 --> 00:55:36,517
for her to come the other 10%% .

792
00:55:36,655 --> 00:55:38,520
Okay, 90%% -10%% . Got it.

793
00:55:38,657 --> 00:55:41,956
Okay, come on. Shake it off. It's your turn.

794
00:55:45,731 --> 00:55:48,063
I had a really nice time tonight, Albert.

795
00:55:50,669 --> 00:55:53,900
I had a great time tonight, too, Allegra...

796
00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:57,341
with a beard.

797
00:56:30,842 --> 00:56:31,809
What's up?

798
00:56:32,711 --> 00:56:35,544
- I'm not feeling it.
- What do you mean? I came 90%% .

799
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:37,706
I'm not feeling like you want it.

800
00:56:37,816 --> 00:56:42,310
Look, I'm Allegra Cole,
the woman of your dreams.

801
00:56:42,421 --> 00:56:46,187
The woman whose green eyes
are limpid pools of desire.

802
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:48,589
Now, show me the magic, Albert.

803
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:51,461
- What the hell was that?
- I'm showing you the magic!

804
00:56:51,596 --> 00:56:53,689
No, I said come 90%% and then I come 10%%!

805
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:55,357
You don't go the whole 100%%!

806
00:56:55,467 --> 00:56:58,959
My mouth was open, Albert.
You overeager son of a...

807
00:57:02,507 --> 00:57:03,974
Other than that, how was it?

808
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:08,173
They came together, they danced together,
and they left together.

809
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,148
He's cute, in a sheepdog kind of way.

810
00:57:11,316 --> 00:57:13,307
For all I know, he's adorable.

811
00:57:13,652 --> 00:57:15,882
But him dating her is...

812
00:57:16,054 --> 00:57:17,578
You seem stressed.

813
00:57:17,723 --> 00:57:19,452
You and I had an understanding.

814
00:57:19,558 --> 00:57:22,049
If you invite Allegra,
you're supposed to call me.

815
00:57:22,227 --> 00:57:23,717
I didn't invite her.

816
00:57:23,929 --> 00:57:26,489
Honestly, sweetie,
I thought she was still in Europe.

817
00:57:26,598 --> 00:57:28,896
- So you invited Albert?
- No.

818
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:33,595
Look, it says here the tickets
went to some guy named Alex Hitchens.

819
00:57:33,705 --> 00:57:34,729
What?

820
00:57:46,218 --> 00:57:47,480
Machine.

821
00:57:50,856 --> 00:57:52,483
Hi, it's Sara.

822
00:57:55,827 --> 00:57:58,694
I just wanted to say thank you...

823
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:03,529
for an unforgettable experience...

824
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:04,995
the other day.

825
00:58:06,505 --> 00:58:08,905
And if you ever want to see
your shirt again...

826
00:58:09,007 --> 00:58:12,966
you can come by
the Fulton Fish Market tonight, around 8:00.

827
00:58:13,345 --> 00:58:15,313
Okay, bye.

828
00:58:18,884 --> 00:58:21,216
- Do you think he'll show?
- Yeah.

829
00:58:21,553 --> 00:58:24,386
He's too much of a player
to have a bad date on his record.

830
00:58:24,689 --> 00:58:27,556
Is this a source or a date?

831
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,057
A source.

832
00:58:31,062 --> 00:58:32,723
Well, it sounded like a date.

833
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:35,232
Well, it was supposed to.

834
00:58:38,403 --> 00:58:41,600
So it looks like a date
and it sounds like a date...

835
00:58:42,007 --> 00:58:45,101
- but it's not a date.
- Yeah. Right.

836
00:58:46,311 --> 00:58:47,471
Just checking.

837
00:59:07,666 --> 00:59:10,328
Hi. I wasn't sure you got my message.

838
00:59:10,535 --> 00:59:15,097
I wasn't sure you called the right guy.
You must be a glutton for punishment.

839
00:59:15,574 --> 00:59:18,202
Either that or I really wanna pay you back.

840
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:20,475
I think this is yours.

841
00:59:21,413 --> 00:59:24,780
Thank you.
I'm gonna frame this for my wall of shame.

842
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,309
Really? There's a whole wall?

843
00:59:27,586 --> 00:59:29,213
So what are we getting into?

844
00:59:31,723 --> 00:59:33,623
Ever been to a food rave before?

845
00:59:33,725 --> 00:59:37,661
Happens once a month, all around the city.
Different chefs, different venues.

846
00:59:37,863 --> 00:59:39,091
You any good in the kitchen?

847
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:41,461
I can stand the heat,
if that's what you mean.

848
00:59:41,566 --> 00:59:45,366
Good. Because that's my boss
and his wife right over there.

849
00:59:45,637 --> 00:59:47,070
Interesting.

850
00:59:47,372 --> 00:59:51,240
Well, here's a concept:
We're paying to cook our own food.

851
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:54,504
Here's another concept:
Shut up. It's an evening out.

852
00:59:54,613 --> 00:59:56,843
The longer you're married,
the less you go out.

853
00:59:56,948 --> 01:00:01,214
In a couple of years, we're gonna end up
bricked into our apartment like a Poe story.

854
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,950
So, Louise, are you
in the newspaper business, also?

855
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:06,421
No, I'm a psychiatrist.

856
01:00:07,893 --> 01:00:11,192
Well, that's the last thing
I'm gonna say tonight.

857
01:00:11,997 --> 01:00:15,524
So, Sara, you never told me.

858
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,634
How was the Sky Studio fashion thing
you went to the other night?

859
01:00:19,771 --> 01:00:23,070
Did you meet anyone worth mentioning?

860
01:00:23,475 --> 01:00:24,533
No.

861
01:00:26,244 --> 01:00:29,941
Really? I find that very odd.

862
01:00:30,482 --> 01:00:32,780
- Max.
- I think you're being odd.

863
01:00:32,918 --> 01:00:36,376
Well, I'm always odd.
It's why you married me.

864
01:00:36,521 --> 01:00:38,648
And it's why I married you.

865
01:00:39,858 --> 01:00:41,382
Speaking of which, Hitch...

866
01:00:41,493 --> 01:00:45,327
what exactly are your intentions
for the lovely Sara?

867
01:00:45,463 --> 01:00:48,728
Wait, you know what?
Actually, there was someone.

868
01:00:51,202 --> 01:00:53,932
I think I met your friends Albert and Allegra.

869
01:00:54,773 --> 01:00:57,469
- My friends who and who?
- Allegra Cole?

870
01:00:57,609 --> 01:00:59,804
Really? How do you know her?

871
01:01:01,212 --> 01:01:03,476
- I don't.
- So you know Albert?

872
01:01:05,016 --> 01:01:07,075
- Knew.
- He had your tickets.

873
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:10,621
I mean, how well do you really
know your accountant?

874
01:01:11,823 --> 01:01:15,691
April 15, and then you don't see him again
till April 15.

875
01:01:17,195 --> 01:01:18,492
Ladies and gentlemen...

876
01:01:18,596 --> 01:01:21,793
a coquille St. Jacques
with a lemon butter reduction.

877
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,127
- Compliments of our chef.
- Thank you.

878
01:01:24,235 --> 01:01:26,294
I'm sure you're really gonna enjoy this.

879
01:01:34,245 --> 01:01:35,576
That's really good.

880
01:01:36,614 --> 01:01:38,741
I'm very impressed.

881
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:40,975
Why is that?

882
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:46,719
Around these two, people usually can't wait
to name-drop and dish their friends...

883
01:01:46,825 --> 01:01:48,349
and you're being all discreet.

884
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,587
Yeah, it's quite endearing.

885
01:01:50,729 --> 01:01:53,527
Actually, it is.
So why don't we change the subject?

886
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:58,993
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

887
01:01:59,804 --> 01:02:03,740
So Sara tells me
that you're a consultant, Hitch.

888
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:09,076
Yeah, mostly marketing, little advertising,
brand management.

889
01:02:10,115 --> 01:02:12,413
I have no idea what that means.

890
01:02:12,584 --> 01:02:15,382
No one does.
That's why I get to charge so much.

891
01:02:19,557 --> 01:02:21,388
Are you sure you're all right?

892
01:02:22,093 --> 01:02:26,223
Yeah, I'm fine.
Is it itchy in here or is it just me?

893
01:02:26,931 --> 01:02:29,957
- I know what's happening.
- No.

894
01:02:30,402 --> 01:02:32,302
You think that I'm in a stressful state...

895
01:02:32,437 --> 01:02:34,598
because I'm trying to make
a good impression...

896
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:37,902
while also dealing
with my commitment issues...

897
01:02:39,244 --> 01:02:42,179
trying to avoid
all these awkward conversations.

898
01:02:42,781 --> 01:02:45,409
No, I think you have food allergies.

899
01:02:48,787 --> 01:02:50,254
- Wow.
- What?

900
01:02:52,824 --> 01:02:54,951
- Benadryl. Where's the Benadryl?
- Aisle 2.

901
01:02:55,093 --> 01:02:57,755
- Which one's Aisle 2?
- The one with the big 2 over it.

902
01:02:57,862 --> 01:02:59,420
Sara, I'm fine.

903
01:02:59,564 --> 01:03:01,691
- You sure it's in Aisle 2?
- No.

904
01:03:01,866 --> 01:03:03,891
Really, it is not that serious.

905
01:03:07,972 --> 01:03:09,269
Benadryl.

906
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:13,539
- A lot of Benadryl. A lot.
- What? Are you...

907
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:30,789
Coquille St. Jacques. Death on a leaf!

908
01:03:35,233 --> 01:03:36,325
Come on!

909
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:49,376
Okay, we're doing fine.

910
01:03:49,481 --> 01:03:51,949
Just a couple more blocks
and you get to lie down.

911
01:04:00,892 --> 01:04:02,757
Wait, who sings that song again?

912
01:04:02,894 --> 01:04:04,725
Oh, girl. Earth, Wind & Fire.

913
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,694
You should let them sing it.

914
01:04:10,401 --> 01:04:14,132
I bet this would be great on the rocks.
It's good, right?

915
01:04:16,574 --> 01:04:19,543
I bet I can ask you
just about anything right now.

916
01:04:19,811 --> 01:04:20,835
No.

917
01:04:21,412 --> 01:04:23,471
I'm a vault, baby. Locked down.

918
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:28,751
What is an heiress doing with a CPA?

919
01:04:29,254 --> 01:04:30,983
They're going to the Knicks game.

920
01:04:31,656 --> 01:04:33,624
Yep, Fort Knox.

921
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,054
He loves her so much!

922
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,154
I'm sure he does.

923
01:04:40,765 --> 01:04:45,099
I'm telling you, people search
their whole lives trying to find the...

924
01:04:45,236 --> 01:04:48,137
Reasons that we're here

925
01:04:49,307 --> 01:04:50,569
I wouldn't know.

926
01:04:51,576 --> 01:04:53,009
You would if you saw it.

927
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:56,972
Sometimes it's really hard
to see the forest through the sleaze.

928
01:04:58,249 --> 01:05:00,547
What about you? You ever been in love?

929
01:05:05,823 --> 01:05:06,949
Yep.

930
01:05:11,229 --> 01:05:12,992
But you're never gonna know that.

931
01:05:16,768 --> 01:05:19,760
Okay, I think you've had enough
of the juice box.

932
01:05:22,473 --> 01:05:23,804
Let's go.

933
01:05:30,782 --> 01:05:32,511
This is some place.

934
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:35,148
You live here alone?

935
01:05:36,988 --> 01:05:41,584
Yeah. I actually prefer it that way.
What about you?

936
01:05:42,227 --> 01:05:46,527
I haven't had a roommate since college,
and he upped and married my sister.

937
01:05:46,664 --> 01:05:49,326
- Really?
- Yeah, they're gonna have a baby soon.

938
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:51,334
Uncle Hitch.

939
01:05:53,004 --> 01:05:54,335
Thank you.

940
01:06:00,378 --> 01:06:03,313
- So, how do you feel?
- Good.

941
01:06:04,682 --> 01:06:05,944
Relaxed.

942
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:09,146
So what about you? Any siblings?

943
01:06:11,489 --> 01:06:15,357
Sister. Maria. Lives in D.C.

944
01:06:17,662 --> 01:06:19,186
Younger, right?

945
01:06:21,933 --> 01:06:23,525
I could hear it in your voice.

946
01:06:25,103 --> 01:06:28,561
Sort of an innate protective thing.

947
01:06:31,009 --> 01:06:32,499
Yeah, I guess.

948
01:06:38,383 --> 01:06:39,372
What?

949
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,051
She almost died once.

950
01:06:49,193 --> 01:06:50,353
I was 10.

951
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:02,034
We were skating on the pond
behind our house...

952
01:07:02,473 --> 01:07:04,065
and she fell through the ice.

953
01:07:06,611 --> 01:07:08,010
My dad pulled her out.

954
01:07:12,283 --> 01:07:13,807
Gave her mouth-to-mouth.

955
01:07:17,555 --> 01:07:20,023
Longest three minutes of my life.

956
01:07:21,893 --> 01:07:23,417
Yeah, I'm sure.

957
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:32,192
I don't think I've ever really gotten over it.

958
01:07:35,973 --> 01:07:39,204
Kind of defines you, doesn't it?

959
01:07:44,248 --> 01:07:48,810
You know like,
one moment you're gliding along...

960
01:07:50,188 --> 01:07:54,124
the next moment you're standing in the rain
watching your life fall apart.

961
01:07:56,194 --> 01:07:57,525
Except it was snow.

962
01:07:59,697 --> 01:08:02,257
Yeah. That's what I said, "snow."

963
01:08:04,602 --> 01:08:05,694
You said "rain."

964
01:08:07,872 --> 01:08:10,238
Some kind of precipitation.

965
01:08:15,046 --> 01:08:16,604
Is that what happened to you?

966
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:24,452
Nothing as dramatic
as falling through the ice.

967
01:08:28,493 --> 01:08:30,188
You know...

968
01:08:31,562 --> 01:08:33,086
it definitely...

969
01:08:36,868 --> 01:08:38,301
Left a scar?

970
01:08:40,571 --> 01:08:41,697
Yeah.

971
01:08:54,385 --> 01:08:57,877
I guess it's best just not to love at all, right?

972
01:09:02,226 --> 01:09:03,523
Or skate.

973
01:09:31,622 --> 01:09:33,089
Are you here?

974
01:09:42,133 --> 01:09:47,230
Sara, you're such an idiot! You moron!
What the hell did you think?

975
01:09:47,338 --> 01:09:50,432
You're so stupid! You gotta learn, Sara.

976
01:09:50,575 --> 01:09:53,203
- When are you gonna learn...
- Should I come back later?

977
01:09:55,413 --> 01:09:58,871
Hi. I thought you left.

978
01:09:59,116 --> 01:10:03,712
Well, I did,
but then I came back with breakfast.

979
01:10:04,655 --> 01:10:07,818
I figured it was the least that I could do.

980
01:10:09,494 --> 01:10:11,985
I didn't know what you were drinking...

981
01:10:12,363 --> 01:10:17,096
so I got a grande cap, a latte,
an Earl Grey tea...

982
01:10:17,368 --> 01:10:19,529
and something with "chai" in the title.

983
01:10:21,539 --> 01:10:22,733
Tea for me.

984
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,570
Tea. Yes! I was hoping you'd say that.

985
01:10:28,546 --> 01:10:31,811
Oh, God.
You're a morning person, aren't you?

986
01:10:33,017 --> 01:10:36,248
Well, like I always tell my clients:

987
01:10:36,354 --> 01:10:39,346
Begin each day as if it were on purpose.

988
01:10:47,064 --> 01:10:49,157
- Wow. Beautiful day.
- Yeah.

989
01:10:50,868 --> 01:10:53,302
- Beautiful girl.
- Thank you.

990
01:10:55,206 --> 01:10:57,106
Well, I'm this way.

991
01:10:57,575 --> 01:10:59,941
I'm that way.

992
01:11:01,245 --> 01:11:03,440
Give me a ring sometime.

993
01:11:05,349 --> 01:11:07,146
I mean, on the phone.

994
01:11:09,754 --> 01:11:12,382
No, I definitely will.

995
01:11:15,026 --> 01:11:16,152
Good.

996
01:11:45,456 --> 01:11:47,253
I gotta go to work.

997
01:11:57,034 --> 01:11:58,160
Bye.

998
01:12:00,738 --> 01:12:02,000
Goodbye.

999
01:12:26,797 --> 01:12:29,960
Can you believe what a beautiful day it is...

1000
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:31,863
not?

1001
01:12:31,969 --> 01:12:35,097
- What's wrong, pumpkin?
- I'm so stupid.

1002
01:12:35,773 --> 01:12:38,037
I ignored your advice. I went on that date.

1003
01:12:38,142 --> 01:12:39,166
With who?

1004
01:12:40,144 --> 01:12:41,736
Not the lingerie guy.

1005
01:12:41,846 --> 01:12:45,213
Vance Munson. And you're right,
there's no way he ever had a mother.

1006
01:12:45,349 --> 01:12:46,646
That bad?

1007
01:12:46,984 --> 01:12:51,148
He took me to Scalinatella,
and he was affectionate and sweet.

1008
01:12:51,656 --> 01:12:55,057
He told me all these intimate things,
like how he can't taste food...

1009
01:12:55,159 --> 01:12:56,649
and he wants three kids.

1010
01:12:56,794 --> 01:12:58,056
So you slept with him.

1011
01:12:59,363 --> 01:13:01,354
I never seen anybody get dressed that fast.

1012
01:13:01,465 --> 01:13:03,228
Case, I'm so sorry.

1013
01:13:05,102 --> 01:13:08,469
- Maybe I'll just die alone after all.
- No, you won't.

1014
01:13:08,606 --> 01:13:12,975
You'll meet a great guy with a great smile
and you'll travel the world together.

1015
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:15,237
Who are you? Where's my best friend?

1016
01:13:15,346 --> 01:13:18,577
It's true. He just hasn't found you yet.
But he will.

1017
01:13:18,683 --> 01:13:22,414
Just as he's leaving, guess what he says:
"Date Doctor, my ass."

1018
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,421
- What does that mean?
- It means he's really out there.

1019
01:13:25,523 --> 01:13:29,391
And if I ever meet him, the only date
he's gonna need is with a real doctor.

1020
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:43,131
That's him.

1021
01:13:43,574 --> 01:13:45,667
Vance, is that you?

1022
01:13:46,377 --> 01:13:49,312
Yeah, hey there, beautiful.

1023
01:13:49,413 --> 01:13:50,880
Sara Melas, from the Standard.

1024
01:13:51,015 --> 01:13:53,483
I'd like to discuss
the dating consultant you hired...

1025
01:13:53,584 --> 01:13:55,745
before you went out with Casey Sedgewick.

1026
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:02,691
You don't wanna talk, that's fine.
I'm going to write this anyway.

1027
01:14:02,793 --> 01:14:05,591
You just earned yourself a photo
with a boldface caption.

1028
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:07,163
What? Nice.

1029
01:14:07,264 --> 01:14:11,030
I can only imagine how the trading
floor guys will react when they see this.

1030
01:14:11,135 --> 01:14:12,864
You have no proof, no facts.

1031
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:15,700
Vance, I'm a gossip columnist, not the DA.

1032
01:14:15,806 --> 01:14:18,570
Okay, how much will it cost me
to stay out of this?

1033
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:20,506
I don't want money. I want a name.

1034
01:14:20,611 --> 01:14:22,943
- I don't know his name.
- Well, what do you know?

1035
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:27,282
I know this.

1036
01:14:33,657 --> 01:14:35,716
All this for a lousy lay.

1037
01:14:36,227 --> 01:14:37,524
Are we satisfied?

1038
01:14:39,263 --> 01:14:40,457
Almost.

1039
01:14:44,301 --> 01:14:47,202
No, you... You got to be...

1040
01:14:53,077 --> 01:14:54,476
Is this really necessary?

1041
01:14:55,112 --> 01:14:56,579
Have you seen your back?

1042
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:00,480
No, but I see my front and maybe
we should be starting with some sit-ups.

1043
01:15:01,285 --> 01:15:02,912
God! Mother of Troy!

1044
01:15:06,457 --> 01:15:07,651
Hello?

1045
01:15:09,126 --> 01:15:12,926
That's crazy.
Just hearing your voice makes me smile.

1046
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:14,327
How are you?

1047
01:15:14,465 --> 01:15:16,626
I'm good, I think.

1048
01:15:16,867 --> 01:15:20,394
No, actually, you know what?
I feel a little strange.

1049
01:15:22,606 --> 01:15:23,903
I'm good.

1050
01:15:25,309 --> 01:15:26,674
Sweet Georgia Brown!

1051
01:15:26,811 --> 01:15:27,937
What was that?

1052
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:31,105
No, that's just some guy screaming.

1053
01:15:32,283 --> 01:15:34,114
Listen, is there any context...

1054
01:15:34,218 --> 01:15:39,315
under which you'd consider facial edema
and pharmaceutical intervention a date?

1055
01:15:40,658 --> 01:15:42,091
Probably not.

1056
01:15:42,193 --> 01:15:43,455
How about a do-over?

1057
01:15:43,561 --> 01:15:46,496
- What do you have in mind?
- Dinner, my place.

1058
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:50,325
Because obviously going anywhere public
with you is out of the question.

1059
01:15:51,268 --> 01:15:54,032
God! That's it. I don't like you very much.

1060
01:15:54,138 --> 01:15:55,503
What is that?

1061
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:56,833
Wait, I'm getting up.

1062
01:15:57,208 --> 01:15:59,608
It's like one of those makeover shows.

1063
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:01,803
- That's a makeover show?
- It's Danish.

1064
01:16:01,912 --> 01:16:03,607
Almost done!

1065
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:05,842
Friday?

1066
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:10,816
Can't. I told a friend I'd go speed dating.
You know, for moral support.

1067
01:16:11,088 --> 01:16:12,646
But tomorrow I'm free.

1068
01:16:14,024 --> 01:16:15,958
Great. All right, 8:00?

1069
01:16:16,227 --> 01:16:17,216
Great.

1070
01:16:17,361 --> 01:16:20,159
- All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1071
01:16:25,502 --> 01:16:28,699
- See, it wasn't so bad, was it?
- God!

1072
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:35,670
Ball is back in play
after a 20-second timeout.

1073
01:16:35,779 --> 01:16:39,909
Knicks lead the Grizzlies, 12-6,
here early in the first quarter.

1074
01:16:49,727 --> 01:16:52,287
- So this is what this feels like?
- "This" being?

1075
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:55,057
Great seats, great game.

1076
01:16:56,634 --> 01:16:58,499
Great date.

1077
01:17:00,704 --> 01:17:02,331
I mean, sort of.

1078
01:17:02,973 --> 01:17:05,305
To me, it feels like a...

1079
01:17:05,976 --> 01:17:08,001
- Date?
- Yeah.

1080
01:17:13,884 --> 01:17:15,613
Look at her. She looks so happy.

1081
01:17:16,487 --> 01:17:19,047
How does a guy like that end up
with a girl like her?

1082
01:17:25,162 --> 01:17:28,359
I am so jealous.
I've always wanted to be able to do that.

1083
01:17:28,699 --> 01:17:31,793
Really? Tonight is your lucky night.
Let's see what you got.

1084
01:17:31,902 --> 01:17:33,563
Okay. You ready?

1085
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,705
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

1086
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:41,971
Knicks off to a great start...

1087
01:17:42,112 --> 01:17:43,602
All right, here's how it works.

1088
01:17:43,714 --> 01:17:47,946
Central Park Zoo, tomorrow, noon,
by the sea lions.

1089
01:17:49,153 --> 01:17:50,780
No, don't worry. I'll find you.

1090
01:17:51,322 --> 01:17:53,119
All right. Thank you.

1091
01:18:11,709 --> 01:18:14,041
It's all right. I'm sorry.

1092
01:18:14,411 --> 01:18:15,776
Damn me.

1093
01:18:20,217 --> 01:18:22,617
That was it! You got it. Do it again.

1094
01:18:24,321 --> 01:18:25,686
Look how cute they are.

1095
01:18:57,021 --> 01:18:58,215
Thanks.

1096
01:19:14,605 --> 01:19:16,732
I had a great time tonight, Albert.

1097
01:19:17,908 --> 01:19:20,604
I had a great time, too, Allegra.

1098
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:42,764
Good night.

1099
01:19:43,267 --> 01:19:44,598
Good night, Albert.

1100
01:19:58,282 --> 01:20:00,443
- Allegra.
- Yes?

1101
01:20:04,655 --> 01:20:05,917
Hold on.

1102
01:20:28,112 --> 01:20:29,773
I like your lips.

1103
01:20:33,884 --> 01:20:35,579
They seem to like you, too.

1104
01:20:44,061 --> 01:20:45,460
Good night.

1105
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:47,495
Good night.

1106
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,895
- Anything?
- Not yet.

1107
01:21:26,703 --> 01:21:29,194
But I got some great shots
of you biting your nails.

1108
01:21:29,606 --> 01:21:30,971
Well, it's a big story.

1109
01:21:32,943 --> 01:21:34,501
- Incoming.
- Really?

1110
01:21:34,611 --> 01:21:35,908
Yep. They're shaking hands.

1111
01:21:36,046 --> 01:21:38,378
This is so great. I can't wait to nail this guy.

1112
01:21:38,515 --> 01:21:40,506
Make sure you get a good shot of his face.

1113
01:21:40,617 --> 01:21:43,017
- What's he look like?
- Tall, dark, and handsome.

1114
01:21:43,187 --> 01:21:44,779
Basic principles:

1115
01:21:44,922 --> 01:21:47,288
No matter what, no matter who,
no matter when.

1116
01:21:47,424 --> 01:21:49,119
This is killing me.

1117
01:21:49,259 --> 01:21:50,920
Geoff is managing to play it straight.

1118
01:21:51,061 --> 01:21:52,858
How long have you been in love with her?

1119
01:21:52,963 --> 01:21:56,626
Her? About two-and-a-half years.

1120
01:21:59,303 --> 01:22:00,463
Take a look.

1121
01:22:08,579 --> 01:22:11,742
- How'd you get my card?
- Albert Brennaman.

1122
01:22:11,848 --> 01:22:13,873
- Great guy, isn't he?
- Excellent guy.

1123
01:22:16,286 --> 01:22:17,719
What? Sara.

1124
01:22:23,994 --> 01:22:27,225
- Pleasure to meet you, Geoff.
- Hey, what...

1125
01:22:31,835 --> 01:22:35,430
- How'd you get my card?
- Albert Brennaman.

1126
01:22:35,672 --> 01:22:37,833
- Great guy, isn't he?
- Excellent guy.

1127
01:22:40,177 --> 01:22:41,735
You sure you want to do this?

1128
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:43,503
Why wouldn't I?

1129
01:22:47,017 --> 01:22:51,477
Louise made an interesting observation
on the way home the other night.

1130
01:22:52,623 --> 01:22:56,081
She said people who are guarded
are afraid...

1131
01:22:57,127 --> 01:22:59,061
that you can see right through them.

1132
01:22:59,196 --> 01:23:03,462
That's why they hide behind
layers of secrecy or humor.

1133
01:23:03,667 --> 01:23:07,034
He'll have to hide behind a lot more
than that once this hits the fan.

1134
01:23:07,804 --> 01:23:08,998
She meant you.

1135
01:23:14,344 --> 01:23:15,777
What do you want me to say?

1136
01:23:17,314 --> 01:23:21,478
That I like the guy?
Yeah, sure, I liked the guy.

1137
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:25,654
Well, here's his shirt.

1138
01:23:27,724 --> 01:23:31,683
- Why don't you think about it? Call me.
- Thanks.

1139
01:23:43,507 --> 01:23:45,737
Papi, Sara Melas is here to see you.

1140
01:23:47,244 --> 01:23:50,304
Thanks a lot, Raoul. Send her up.
And stop calling me papi.

1141
01:24:02,092 --> 01:24:05,391
Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

1142
01:24:06,697 --> 01:24:08,858
I believe this belongs to you.

1143
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:15,698
Yeah, this thing is like a bad penny.

1144
01:24:15,806 --> 01:24:16,932
Wow!

1145
01:24:18,075 --> 01:24:19,565
So this is it.

1146
01:24:20,277 --> 01:24:21,938
Yeah, this is it.

1147
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:25,680
Business must be good.

1148
01:24:26,316 --> 01:24:28,910
Well, it has its rewards.

1149
01:24:30,754 --> 01:24:32,085
I'll bet.

1150
01:24:33,557 --> 01:24:34,888
Tough day?

1151
01:24:35,959 --> 01:24:37,256
You could say that.

1152
01:24:38,729 --> 01:24:41,857
Well, you know what?
You can just sit back and relax.

1153
01:24:41,965 --> 01:24:43,796
I got this all covered.

1154
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:49,461
Spanish wine!

1155
01:24:51,274 --> 01:24:53,902
How thoughtful are we?

1156
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:56,911
- Here, let me pour that for you.
- No, that's okay.

1157
01:24:57,514 --> 01:25:00,244
- You want some?
- Sure.

1158
01:25:02,018 --> 01:25:04,145
So, Hitch.

1159
01:25:04,821 --> 01:25:08,222
Is that a noun or a verb?

1160
01:25:10,927 --> 01:25:12,189
I guess it depends.

1161
01:25:14,798 --> 01:25:18,598
Let's see, what should we toast to?

1162
01:25:21,772 --> 01:25:24,673
Never lie, steal, cheat, or drink.

1163
01:25:25,675 --> 01:25:28,872
But if you must lie,
lie in the arms of the one you love.

1164
01:25:29,813 --> 01:25:32,748
If you must steal,
steal away from bad company.

1165
01:25:32,849 --> 01:25:35,613
If you must cheat, cheat death.

1166
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:37,885
And if you must drink...

1167
01:25:38,455 --> 01:25:41,686
drink in the moments
that take your breath away.

1168
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,518
Did you just make that up?

1169
01:25:57,941 --> 01:25:59,340
Make yourself at home.

1170
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:02,342
I'm gonna check on the risotto.

1171
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,311
Look at this! Which one's the music?

1172
01:26:14,624 --> 01:26:16,421
It does lights, too?

1173
01:26:18,595 --> 01:26:21,086
Let me help you out with that.

1174
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:23,893
Now, this is nifty.

1175
01:26:25,535 --> 01:26:26,832
What are you doing?

1176
01:26:27,304 --> 01:26:29,397
How does it work, exactly?

1177
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:35,944
Well, usually you have dinner,
then you have dessert.

1178
01:26:36,813 --> 01:26:40,180
No, I mean your thriving business.

1179
01:26:44,621 --> 01:26:46,020
I don't do interviews.

1180
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:51,689
But if you'd like to get back to the evening,
I'd be happy to sit and talk.

1181
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:53,729
Great idea. You start.

1182
01:26:55,031 --> 01:26:59,559
Well, maybe I would if you weren't snarling.

1183
01:27:06,142 --> 01:27:08,110
What if I told you...

1184
01:27:08,211 --> 01:27:13,148
that I know exactly what you do
and how you do it?

1185
01:27:13,283 --> 01:27:15,183
And I think it's despicable!

1186
01:27:15,285 --> 01:27:18,118
You know what?
We might need to go out to dinner.

1187
01:27:18,255 --> 01:27:21,816
There's a great seafood restaurant
I'd love to take you to.

1188
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,987
How about you just get a cleaver, butcher?

1189
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:29,499
- Maybe I will!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

1190
01:27:29,633 --> 01:27:31,464
Nothing a front-page story can't cure.

1191
01:27:31,601 --> 01:27:33,000
So that's what this is all about?

1192
01:27:33,136 --> 01:27:35,934
Albert and Allegra
on the front of your crap-ass newspaper?

1193
01:27:36,039 --> 01:27:37,836
- You put them there!
- No, you did!

1194
01:27:37,974 --> 01:27:40,636
No, he did! The minute he called you!

1195
01:28:08,204 --> 01:28:10,263
Dr. Hitch. Listen to me, papi.

1196
01:28:10,373 --> 01:28:14,366
I need to bring my partner, Amir,
somewhere amazing for our anniversary.

1197
01:28:15,045 --> 01:28:17,946
Maybe it's not your thing, but maybe it is.

1198
01:28:18,048 --> 01:28:20,016
What the hell are you talking about, Raoul?

1199
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:21,640
It's you, no?

1200
01:28:42,172 --> 01:28:46,131
So, my friend, how was she? Pretty good?

1201
01:28:50,246 --> 01:28:52,737
How was she? I'll tell you! She was great!

1202
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:08,492
Isn't that the Date Doctor?

1203
01:29:08,598 --> 01:29:11,726
- I'm telling you, that's him.
- He doesn't look anything like him.

1204
01:29:11,868 --> 01:29:14,496
- Excuse me. Do you know him?
- No.

1205
01:29:14,971 --> 01:29:18,566
I want you to look me in the eye
and tell me that he did not hire you.

1206
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:22,508
Ma'am, I have never seen this man
before in my life.

1207
01:29:22,612 --> 01:29:23,670
See you later, Tony.

1208
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:26,374
Tony? You have got
some serious explaining to do.

1209
01:29:26,483 --> 01:29:28,451
Albert. Hitch. You all right?

1210
01:29:28,585 --> 01:29:31,383
I can't really talk right now.
I'm kind of tied up.

1211
01:29:31,488 --> 01:29:33,456
One, two. On three.

1212
01:29:41,498 --> 01:29:43,363
Women will remain seated.

1213
01:29:43,466 --> 01:29:46,629
Men will rotate to the left at the buzzer.

1214
01:29:46,936 --> 01:29:48,961
You get two minutes each,
four minutes total.

1215
01:29:49,105 --> 01:29:52,666
So trade your talk time when you hear...

1216
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,138
the gong.

1217
01:29:56,279 --> 01:29:58,179
If it's mutual, you get numbers.

1218
01:29:58,314 --> 01:30:01,806
If not, better luck next time, okay?

1219
01:30:02,686 --> 01:30:05,154
Ladies, take your seats.

1220
01:30:06,523 --> 01:30:11,187
Case, you are a living testimonial
to the triumph of hope over experience.

1221
01:30:11,327 --> 01:30:12,487
Thanks for coming.

1222
01:30:12,629 --> 01:30:15,826
I know it's lame. I'm sure it's the last thing
you feel like doing.

1223
01:30:16,099 --> 01:30:20,058
I really prefer Rachmaninoff
to the heavier romantic composers.

1224
01:30:20,236 --> 01:30:23,296
But despite the pan-Germanic
anti-Semitism...

1225
01:30:23,406 --> 01:30:26,500
I'd still have to say my favorite is Wagner.

1226
01:30:28,845 --> 01:30:31,336
- Nice talking to you.
- Thank you. Bye.

1227
01:30:31,481 --> 01:30:32,539
Bye.

1228
01:30:34,417 --> 01:30:35,679
Excuse me.

1229
01:30:36,252 --> 01:30:37,844
That's my seat, man.

1230
01:30:39,989 --> 01:30:41,980
My name is Ron. I'm 28.

1231
01:30:42,092 --> 01:30:44,617
Albert Brennaman is a good man.

1232
01:30:44,761 --> 01:30:47,525
In fact, Albert Brennaman is a great man.

1233
01:30:47,664 --> 01:30:50,360
I just got out of a five-year relationship.

1234
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,367
I'm a lot of fun at parties. I like dogs...

1235
01:30:53,503 --> 01:30:56,165
And then you're mad at me
for what I do for a living?

1236
01:30:56,272 --> 01:30:57,637
I've already got your number...

1237
01:30:57,741 --> 01:31:00,335
so why don't you go
consult your conscience?

1238
01:31:00,443 --> 01:31:03,207
- Albert is in love with her.
- Just like Sebastian?

1239
01:31:03,346 --> 01:31:05,246
- Is there a problem?
- No, just one sec.

1240
01:31:05,381 --> 01:31:08,145
- What do you have against Allegra anyway?
- Nothing.

1241
01:31:08,251 --> 01:31:11,345
My interest is protecting women
from assholes like you.

1242
01:31:11,454 --> 01:31:13,149
I did ice climbing once.

1243
01:31:13,256 --> 01:31:15,554
- You don't even know me.
- And whose fault is that?

1244
01:31:15,692 --> 01:31:18,490
...the sun comes up,
the ice really starts to fall apart.

1245
01:31:18,595 --> 01:31:19,823
I bet. I'm sorry.

1246
01:31:19,929 --> 01:31:22,022
- Do you know this guy?
- Apparently not.

1247
01:31:22,132 --> 01:31:23,759
You're in my seat.

1248
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:27,392
You really...
I'm doing you a favor, believe me.

1249
01:31:27,537 --> 01:31:31,667
Basically, I like outdoor sports.
But indoor sports have their place, too.

1250
01:31:31,775 --> 01:31:34,437
There are certain aspects of my job
that are secretive.

1251
01:31:34,577 --> 01:31:36,704
And my job is to try to find the truth.

1252
01:31:36,813 --> 01:31:40,442
The truth? You wouldn't know the truth
if it kicked you in the head.

1253
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:43,177
If Albert Brennaman has to take a fall for it,
so be it.

1254
01:31:43,286 --> 01:31:45,516
Why don't you say
what's really pissing you off?

1255
01:31:45,622 --> 01:31:47,112
I've been waiting to talk to her...

1256
01:31:47,257 --> 01:31:49,725
- You want to sit down? Here you go. Gong!
- Thank you.

1257
01:31:49,826 --> 01:31:50,884
Excuse me.

1258
01:31:50,994 --> 01:31:54,054
Hi. Actually, you're not supposed to move.

1259
01:31:54,164 --> 01:31:56,928
I'm Alex Hitchens. No, it's okay. Go.

1260
01:31:57,066 --> 01:31:58,624
- I'm Casey.
- Hi, Casey.

1261
01:31:58,768 --> 01:32:01,737
I work for a small publishing house
in the press department...

1262
01:32:01,838 --> 01:32:04,898
which isn't actually where I want to be.
But it's a good house...

1263
01:32:05,008 --> 01:32:07,568
You handled me. You manipulated me.

1264
01:32:07,677 --> 01:32:11,306
You researched me and you showed me
my great-grandfather's signature.

1265
01:32:11,447 --> 01:32:13,574
Wait. You're Ellis Island?

1266
01:32:13,683 --> 01:32:15,583
- I thought that was real sweet.
- Thank you.

1267
01:32:15,685 --> 01:32:17,346
Case, you're not helping.

1268
01:32:17,453 --> 01:32:19,080
Excuse me, I'm on a date.

1269
01:32:20,423 --> 01:32:24,086
Does it ever occur to women
that maybe a guy might like to have a plan...

1270
01:32:24,194 --> 01:32:25,661
because he's nervous?

1271
01:32:25,795 --> 01:32:29,754
He's not sure that he could just
walk up to you and you'd respond if he said:

1272
01:32:29,866 --> 01:32:31,333
"I like you."

1273
01:32:35,772 --> 01:32:38,866
- That sounds good to me.
- True, you can't tell them you like them.

1274
01:32:38,975 --> 01:32:42,172
- I tried that. It didn't go well.
- I've crashed and burned on that.

1275
01:32:42,312 --> 01:32:44,974
That is what you did, and I did like you!

1276
01:32:45,114 --> 01:32:48,140
I just didn't know I was being worked over
by some professional.

1277
01:32:48,251 --> 01:32:49,616
He doesn't have a badge.

1278
01:32:50,286 --> 01:32:52,311
The only time he was sincere
or spontaneous...

1279
01:32:52,455 --> 01:32:56,255
was when everything was going wrong
or when you were stoned out of your head.

1280
01:32:56,359 --> 01:32:59,658
- I'm sorry to interrupt. Do I know you?
- No, I don't think so.

1281
01:32:59,796 --> 01:33:02,663
- You wanna see me be spontaneous?
- Sure, you want a Benadryl?

1282
01:33:02,799 --> 01:33:07,361
This is really kind of distracting.
And I haven't gotten laid in a year!

1283
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:16,543
We're sorry.
Why don't you guys get back to your date?

1284
01:33:17,413 --> 01:33:19,779
Or go somewhere.

1285
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:22,078
Maybe from the bank?

1286
01:33:22,685 --> 01:33:26,451
If this doesn't work out, call him.
He might hook you up with Paris Hilton.

1287
01:33:26,556 --> 01:33:29,889
Wait, that's it. You're the Date Doctor, right?

1288
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:37,499
- You're the Date Doctor?
- Do we have a problem here?

1289
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:42,196
Yeah, a big one!
What the hell did I ever do to you?

1290
01:33:44,173 --> 01:33:45,572
Am I missing something?

1291
01:33:46,075 --> 01:33:48,134
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1292
01:33:48,444 --> 01:33:51,072
Why don't you go hit a titty bar
with your buddy Vance?

1293
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,012
Wow.

1294
01:33:59,923 --> 01:34:01,117
I don't believe this.

1295
01:34:04,761 --> 01:34:06,126
That's your source?

1296
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:08,554
You buried yourself, Alex.

1297
01:34:09,232 --> 01:34:10,893
Then you weren't listening.

1298
01:34:11,034 --> 01:34:13,229
I heard every word.

1299
01:34:13,736 --> 01:34:15,363
You're a scam artist.

1300
01:34:15,471 --> 01:34:19,032
- You trick women into getting...
- Into getting out of their own way...

1301
01:34:19,142 --> 01:34:22,578
so great guys like Albert Brennaman
have a fighting chance.

1302
01:34:22,712 --> 01:34:26,239
No, I want everybody
to take a good look at this right now.

1303
01:34:26,382 --> 01:34:27,849
Because this right here...

1304
01:34:27,951 --> 01:34:31,944
this is exactly why falling in love
is so goddamn hard.

1305
01:34:33,423 --> 01:34:35,357
Sir, let's go. Now.

1306
01:34:38,394 --> 01:34:40,828
And Vance Munson is a pig!

1307
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:43,262
And I refused to work with him.

1308
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,729
You need to get your facts right.

1309
01:34:48,004 --> 01:34:51,098
It's because of jerks like him
that I even have a job.

1310
01:34:54,143 --> 01:34:55,474
Had a job.

1311
01:35:08,324 --> 01:35:09,757
Can you believe that guy?

1312
01:35:11,027 --> 01:35:13,655
Actually, I do.

1313
01:35:35,051 --> 01:35:36,279
You...

1314
01:35:37,954 --> 01:35:39,751
complete me.

1315
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:43,690
- I might just have...
- Shut up.

1316
01:35:44,394 --> 01:35:45,861
Just shut up.

1317
01:35:46,829 --> 01:35:48,820
You had me at "hello."

1318
01:36:16,993 --> 01:36:18,358
No comment.

1319
01:36:22,899 --> 01:36:26,858
This is off the record.

1320
01:36:32,175 --> 01:36:33,972
I came to apologize.

1321
01:36:34,210 --> 01:36:36,701
I made some assumptions about you...

1322
01:36:36,846 --> 01:36:39,713
based on nothing, it turns out.

1323
01:36:42,552 --> 01:36:46,386
- I guess Casey's right. My best friend...
- Don't worry about it. We're straight.

1324
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:51,717
I should've asked you.
But sometimes you're so guarded.

1325
01:36:51,861 --> 01:36:55,262
I just don't wanna be another reason
for you to...

1326
01:36:56,299 --> 01:37:00,429
I'm not someone who likes to get involved
past a certain point.

1327
01:37:00,603 --> 01:37:04,403
And that point was about a week ago.

1328
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:15,076
Well, I just want to say I'm really sorry...

1329
01:37:16,652 --> 01:37:18,210
and I didn't mean to hurt you.

1330
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:22,189
You didn't.

1331
01:37:26,329 --> 01:37:27,557
That's a relief.

1332
01:37:56,626 --> 01:37:59,561
- Hey, fella.
- Yeah, good. You?

1333
01:38:02,231 --> 01:38:03,425
What you got there?

1334
01:38:03,566 --> 01:38:08,230
This? I figured maybe if my heart
stops beating, it wouldn't hurt so much.

1335
01:38:09,772 --> 01:38:11,069
She hasn't called back?

1336
01:38:15,511 --> 01:38:16,842
You want some coffee?

1337
01:38:22,285 --> 01:38:23,479
I want you to fix it.

1338
01:38:28,124 --> 01:38:29,386
I got nothing, Albert.

1339
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:33,894
You wanna do something?
We should get out tonight.

1340
01:38:33,996 --> 01:38:37,056
Honestly, I never knew I could feel like this.

1341
01:38:37,166 --> 01:38:39,760
I swear I'm going out of my mind.

1342
01:38:41,304 --> 01:38:43,738
I wanna throw myself off
of every building in New York.

1343
01:38:43,839 --> 01:38:48,333
I see a cab and I wanna dive in front of it,
because then I'll stop thinking about her.

1344
01:38:48,444 --> 01:38:51,174
Look, you will. Just give it time.

1345
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,646
That's just it. I don't want to.

1346
01:38:54,116 --> 01:38:57,210
I've waited my whole life
to feel this miserable.

1347
01:38:57,386 --> 01:39:00,082
If this is the only way
I can stay connected with her...

1348
01:39:00,189 --> 01:39:01,747
then this is who I have to be.

1349
01:39:01,891 --> 01:39:05,987
No, you don't.
You can change, you can adapt.

1350
01:39:06,629 --> 01:39:09,325
You can make it
so you don't ever have to feel like this.

1351
01:39:09,432 --> 01:39:10,421
Ever again.

1352
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:23,071
Oh, my God. You just don't get it, do you?

1353
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,377
I get it.

1354
01:39:26,882 --> 01:39:28,281
Let me get this straight.

1355
01:39:28,451 --> 01:39:31,716
You're selling this stuff,
but you don't believe in your own product.

1356
01:39:32,021 --> 01:39:34,819
- Love is my life.
- No. Love is your job.

1357
01:39:48,638 --> 01:39:51,163
You wanna jump out a plane
without a chute, be my guest.

1358
01:39:51,274 --> 01:39:53,333
But forgive me if I don't join you.

1359
01:39:54,577 --> 01:39:56,772
This isn't about love for you at all, is it?

1360
01:40:00,383 --> 01:40:02,544
This whole time, I thought I was the coward.

1361
01:40:07,623 --> 01:40:09,716
- Where you going?
- Skydiving.

1362
01:40:40,823 --> 01:40:42,017
Taxi!

1363
01:41:15,758 --> 01:41:17,089
Mr. Hitchens.

1364
01:41:18,127 --> 01:41:20,425
Miss Cole,
thank you very much for seeing me.

1365
01:41:20,529 --> 01:41:22,656
You said it was a matter of life and death.

1366
01:41:24,166 --> 01:41:27,397
That man would've sold his soul
to make you happy.

1367
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:30,466
So what does that make you, the devil?

1368
01:41:32,908 --> 01:41:37,709
My job is not to deceive, Miss Cole.
It's to create opportunities.

1369
01:41:39,115 --> 01:41:40,241
Like the boardroom.

1370
01:41:41,016 --> 01:41:43,075
- Would you have noticed him otherwise?
- Yes.

1371
01:41:43,185 --> 01:41:45,415
- Really?
- Eventually.

1372
01:41:49,992 --> 01:41:51,050
Maybe.

1373
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:56,957
How did you know all that stuff about me?

1374
01:41:59,635 --> 01:42:01,432
Well, you really did your homework.

1375
01:42:03,406 --> 01:42:07,274
Like at boarding school when everyone
used to tease me because I couldn't whistle.

1376
01:42:07,710 --> 01:42:11,146
And having him dance like a buffoon
knowing that I can't dance, either.

1377
01:42:11,847 --> 01:42:15,806
Then telling him to drop mustard
on his shirt, so I'd feel less like a dork.

1378
01:42:19,455 --> 01:42:21,514
That was all you, right?

1379
01:42:22,158 --> 01:42:24,524
No. Hell, no.

1380
01:42:24,827 --> 01:42:25,919
That was him?

1381
01:42:26,362 --> 01:42:28,523
That's got Albert written all over it.

1382
01:42:30,399 --> 01:42:32,162
Did you put him up to the inhaler?

1383
01:42:32,635 --> 01:42:34,830
Stop it. He did not show you that.

1384
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:38,263
He chucked it right before he kissed me.

1385
01:42:38,908 --> 01:42:40,205
So, wait...

1386
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:43,069
that stuff worked for you?

1387
01:42:45,214 --> 01:42:46,579
It was adorable.

1388
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:55,721
What did you do?

1389
01:42:58,093 --> 01:42:59,321
Nothing.

1390
01:43:04,633 --> 01:43:06,396
Absolutely nothing.

1391
01:43:08,604 --> 01:43:09,832
That's good.

1392
01:43:11,807 --> 01:43:14,367
- This was your plan the whole time?
- Albert.

1393
01:43:14,477 --> 01:43:16,604
You sail off into the sunset with my girl?

1394
01:43:21,484 --> 01:43:25,477
You were like a brother to me!

1395
01:43:26,388 --> 01:43:29,118
- He came here for you.
- Who?

1396
01:43:29,225 --> 01:43:30,556
The guy you're choking.

1397
01:43:42,204 --> 01:43:44,331
- I love you.
- I love you.

1398
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:46,237
I really love you.

1399
01:43:49,845 --> 01:43:52,837
- I love you more.
- I love you more. I really do.

1400
01:43:55,584 --> 01:43:57,017
I got somewhere I gotta go.

1401
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:30,748
- Yeah, who is it?
- Hitch.

1402
01:44:32,288 --> 01:44:33,346
Can I talk to you?

1403
01:44:41,864 --> 01:44:42,831
What?

1404
01:44:45,301 --> 01:44:46,461
You almost hit me.

1405
01:44:50,973 --> 01:44:55,307
Look, I just wanted to stop by, basically.

1406
01:44:56,946 --> 01:44:58,243
See, this is the thing.

1407
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:07,646
This is weird.
I don't have me behind the door, you know.

1408
01:45:08,791 --> 01:45:09,849
Close your mouth.

1409
01:45:13,195 --> 01:45:16,426
Because I knew at some point I'd be...

1410
01:45:18,133 --> 01:45:21,796
right here. But I thought that...

1411
01:45:26,742 --> 01:45:29,734
everything would come out, but it's like...

1412
01:45:31,347 --> 01:45:32,644
That's throwing me off.

1413
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:40,586
- Can we close the door?
- What?

1414
01:45:40,689 --> 01:45:44,147
I'm sorry. Just, can we... I just need...

1415
01:45:44,293 --> 01:45:47,228
- Are you serious?
- No, just like this.

1416
01:45:51,333 --> 01:45:52,994
What do you want, Hitch?

1417
01:45:55,104 --> 01:45:56,128
You.

1418
01:45:59,241 --> 01:46:03,075
For a whole lot of reasons
that don't make any sense to me.

1419
01:46:04,346 --> 01:46:07,645
I mean, what, we've been on three dates?

1420
01:46:08,484 --> 01:46:10,509
See, that's what's crazy.

1421
01:46:10,686 --> 01:46:13,382
That's what's crazy, because I know.

1422
01:46:13,756 --> 01:46:15,087
I know deep...

1423
01:46:15,190 --> 01:46:20,059
like just down, just in this area...

1424
01:46:20,863 --> 01:46:22,831
that I just know...

1425
01:46:24,433 --> 01:46:25,957
that I want...

1426
01:46:26,735 --> 01:46:30,831
I want to be miserable.

1427
01:46:30,939 --> 01:46:33,737
Like, really miserable.

1428
01:46:34,276 --> 01:46:35,436
Because, hey...

1429
01:46:35,544 --> 01:46:40,106
if that's what it takes
for me to be happy then...

1430
01:46:42,351 --> 01:46:44,182
Wait, that didn't come out right.

1431
01:46:44,286 --> 01:46:46,618
What the hell is wrong with you?

1432
01:46:46,722 --> 01:46:49,589
- Nothing!
- No, not you.

1433
01:46:51,226 --> 01:46:53,160
I'm talking to me.

1434
01:47:14,283 --> 01:47:16,274
Alex Hitchens, Tom Reda.

1435
01:47:20,823 --> 01:47:22,381
I'll just put this in the car.

1436
01:47:36,572 --> 01:47:38,267
Maybe it's like what you said.

1437
01:47:38,507 --> 01:47:42,603
We should just both go our separate ways
and then we'll do just fine.

1438
01:47:54,323 --> 01:47:55,984
What if fine isn't good enough?

1439
01:48:01,363 --> 01:48:02,955
What if I want extraordinary?

1440
01:48:04,299 --> 01:48:05,459
No such thing.

1441
01:48:17,980 --> 01:48:20,073
I'm just as scared as you are, Sara.

1442
01:48:20,849 --> 01:48:23,909
But I'm right here, and our time is right now.

1443
01:48:24,386 --> 01:48:25,876
Well, what about before?

1444
01:48:25,988 --> 01:48:29,287
I am a guy. Since when
do we get anything right the first time?

1445
01:48:29,391 --> 01:48:31,859
I'm a realist,
and I know what love does to people.

1446
01:48:32,361 --> 01:48:33,988
- No, you don't.
- Keys.

1447
01:48:36,165 --> 01:48:38,633
There you go. Right here.

1448
01:48:41,804 --> 01:48:44,568
I don't know who this is, and I don't care.

1449
01:48:45,307 --> 01:48:49,641
What I do know is he'll never feel about you
the way that I do.

1450
01:48:52,214 --> 01:48:54,876
- You know how to drive a stick?
- Both of you, shut up!

1451
01:49:01,857 --> 01:49:04,348
- You okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

1452
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:07,453
You'll never be fine, and neither will I!

1453
01:49:10,933 --> 01:49:12,230
Maybe I should drive.

1454
01:49:13,335 --> 01:49:15,496
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

1455
01:49:15,671 --> 01:49:17,104
If that's what it takes.

1456
01:49:17,206 --> 01:49:18,605
Sara, what happened?

1457
01:49:18,707 --> 01:49:21,198
- He jumped on the car.
- Why?

1458
01:49:21,977 --> 01:49:23,604
Because that's what people do.

1459
01:49:24,546 --> 01:49:27,913
They leap and hope to God they can fly.

1460
01:49:33,755 --> 01:49:34,983
Because otherwise...

1461
01:49:36,091 --> 01:49:38,616
we just drop like a rock...

1462
01:49:39,294 --> 01:49:41,125
wondering the whole way down:

1463
01:49:42,097 --> 01:49:45,589
"Why in the hell did I jump?"

1464
01:49:47,369 --> 01:49:51,032
But here I am, Sara, falling.

1465
01:49:52,007 --> 01:49:56,137
And there's only one person
that makes me feel like I can fly.

1466
01:49:58,547 --> 01:49:59,707
That's you.

1467
01:50:05,053 --> 01:50:07,681
So, you kind of like me?

1468
01:50:08,757 --> 01:50:09,849
No.

1469
01:50:11,026 --> 01:50:12,186
I love you.

1470
01:50:13,562 --> 01:50:15,894
I love you, and I knew it from the first...

1471
01:50:26,541 --> 01:50:29,237
If I say it back now, it'll sound so stupid.

1472
01:50:32,414 --> 01:50:36,612
This is the guy I was telling you about.
Hitch, that's my sister, Maria.

1473
01:50:36,718 --> 01:50:38,515
And that's her husband, Tom.

1474
01:50:43,058 --> 01:50:44,320
Her husband.

1475
01:51:26,101 --> 01:51:27,568
Where's your date?

1476
01:51:28,136 --> 01:51:29,660
Don't have one.

1477
01:51:35,544 --> 01:51:37,273
I know. Shocking, huh?

1478
01:51:40,782 --> 01:51:43,512
Oh, my God!

1479
01:51:50,525 --> 01:51:51,753
Are you all right?

1480
01:51:53,395 --> 01:51:54,885
Grandma, what happened?

1481
01:51:55,397 --> 01:51:58,696
This young lady just saved my life.

1482
01:52:03,438 --> 01:52:05,531
Ask her to dance.

1483
01:52:06,808 --> 01:52:09,003
Well, if you insist.

1484
01:52:10,145 --> 01:52:13,137
- I'm Casey.
- Charles Wellington.

1485
01:52:14,416 --> 01:52:17,544
- And this...
- Forget it. Just go.

1486
01:52:31,166 --> 01:52:32,861
Basic principles:

1487
01:52:34,269 --> 01:52:35,429
There are none.
