1
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,718
<i>My name is Jack McCall.</i>

2
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,662
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

3
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:36,168
<i>what you're listening to is not the sound of my voice.</i>

4
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:41,298
<i>It's the sound of my inner voice,
the one inside my head.</i>

5
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,409
<i>I'd like to talk to you, but I can't.</i>

6
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,712
<i>Because if I say
just one more sentence out loud,</i>

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,482
<i>I'll die.</i>

8
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,773
Aaron, I have got
a very important assignment for you.

9
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,370
Go to Barneys and get me six dozen pair of cashmere blend socks,

10
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:23,039
40% cashmere.

11
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,845
No, I'm gonna wear 'em, but you're gonna buy 'em.

12
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,078
Do I need six dozen pair of cashmere socks? No, but listen.

13
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,143
Hey, "need" is a tricky word.

14
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,247
Think about it more like this,
"want" or "love" are better words.

15
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,882
Think about it.
Don't we do everything out of love?

16
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,156
How about this?
Do you want, need or love your job?

17
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,494
Well, I love the idea
that you need your job. Okay.

18
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,997
Three white witches watch three Swatch watches.

19
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,559
Which witches watch
which watch switch...

20
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:46,563
Okay.

21
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,904
Daddy's gonna hold you
'cause Mommy needs caffeine.

22
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,675
Baby, I don't know
if I can work with, "Whaah!"

23
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,877
Oh, look how happy he is with his mommy.

24
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,714
- Yeah.
- Yes, he is. He's a mama's boy.

25
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,775
- No, he isn't.
- Yes.

26
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:03,048
There's nothing wrong with being a mama's boy. I'm a mama's boy.

27
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,680
- Oh, my God!
- What?

28
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,926
Shaq snuck in the house and shit in the baby's diaper!

29
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:08,983
Hey!

30
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,896
Excuse me, you think maybe I could cut in front...

31
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,307
I will run you over dead in the parking lot.

32
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,376
Dead. Dead. Dead.

33
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,849
Hello?

34
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:39,783
What? She's in labor?

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,425
Well, tell her to stop pushing!

36
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,156
Look, I can't miss the birth of my first child!

37
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,561
I only went out to get some coffee!

38
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,998
Go ahead. Expectant father coming through!

39
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,261
I got a baby on the way! Thank you. Thank you!

40
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,359
Congratulations, man! You're the man!

41
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,631
Thank you so much! Thank you so much.

42
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,605
Twins? It's twins!

43
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,905
I'm having twins. I'm having twins.

44
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,037
Thank you. It's on the house? Thank you so much!

45
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,582
- Thank you. Thank you. - Congratulations!

46
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,077
We live in a world that's obsessive and controlling.

47
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,348
I think I care too much. I think that's what you would say about me,

48
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,480
that I care too much.

49
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:14,549
I think that's what everybody would say about me, that I care too much.

50
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,322
This coffee's incredible. Do you ever stop to think about

51
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,125
what people are thinking about when you're not in the room?

52
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,289
What do people think when I'm not there?

53
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,491
That's the thought that I want to know.

54
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:21,931
What do people think when I'm not there?

55
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,365
I know you think something when I'm there,

56
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,926
but when I'm not there, what are you thinking?

57
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,096
What are you thinking when I'm not in the room?

58
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,470
That's the real thought. Or do you ever wonder who's on line with you?

59
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,907
You could be on line with somebody.
I'm not talking about the computer.

60
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,410
I'm talking about the real line, the real line,

61
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,174
the old-fashioned line with somebody behind you, somebody in front of you.

62
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,239
That line is dangerous 'cause you don't know who that is.

63
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,306
Or an elevator!

64
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,750
You're in a elevator, door closed, you're in the room with this person.

65
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,288
They could pull out a knife and start doing all kinds of shit to you.

66
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,483
You get in elevators all the time. Elevators are crazy.

67
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,853
Hey, what about restaurants?

68
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,918
You could be in a restaurant sitting next to somebody who's a maniac

69
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,123
and they're right next to you in a chair, and they're ordering like the same thing.

70
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,657
Look at you smiling and this person just, you know, stabbed somebody in the ass

71
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,067
and now they sitting next to the table next to you.

72
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,331
This could be happening all the time.

73
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,498
Jack! If I may...

74
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,735
Hey, Doc, I think we're about out of time.

75
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,902
But I feel so much better.

76
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,909
Thank you so much. You know, you're a genius.

77
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:13,977
Good morning, Mr. McCall.

78
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,314
I don't mean to be pushy and I know you get hit up all the time.

79
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,550
I was just wondering if you had a chance to read my manuscript.

80
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:21,149
Your manuscript?

81
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,558
Hey, Reverend Marcus. How's my favorite client?

82
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:25,563
I just need to know if I'm going home to Nebraska, work on my dad's farm,

83
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,428
or, you know, maybe you could just read 20 pages.

84
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,900
Hold on one second. Hey, look, I'm getting closer on your manuscript.

85
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,493
It's moved from my kitchen table to my nightstand,

86
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,869
and next, it'll be by my toilet and that's where it'll get read, okay?

87
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,340
Reverend, two words, "gripping" and "necessary". Hold on one sec.

88
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,535
Hey, can you do me a favor?

89
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,872
Can you polish my rims for me?

90
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,243
And don't park my car under the trees with all those birds?

91
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,805
<i>Reverend, Lord, Where's My Money?
Is the best thing you've ever written.</i>

92
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,375
Jack McCall's office, please hold.

93
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,619
Jack McCall's office, please hold.

94
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,187
Jack McCall's office, please hold.

95
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,726
You're already holding? Okay, continue to hold. Thanks.

96
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,422
Jack McCall's office.

97
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,997
I don't care. Just take him to the vet. I don't know, Mom!

98
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,590
I don't... Mom, I got to go.

99
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,294
Yes, I did have a great weekend.

100
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,234
And, yes, I would like some coffee.

101
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,396
I look good, right?

102
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,272
I finished picking out all the mini-marshmallows out of your cereal.

103
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,364
All the mini-marshmallows?

104
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,934
Except the yellow moons, obviously.

105
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,006
Mr. McCall?

106
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:19,741
I know that I'm just an assistant. And I really appreciate...

107
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,149
Hey, Aaron, this is my office.

108
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,983
This isn't the confessional booth at MTV, all right?

109
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:27,424
No, no, I know. I know. I would never confess. I'm just...

110
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,326
I guess what I'm trying to say is that if I'm gonna

111
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,958
be an agent one day, I'm not really sure how this...

112
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,194
You have to speak like me, talk like me, study me!

113
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,702
Learn to speak your mind, but do it quickly.

114
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,465
You have to remember, this is all part of your training.

115
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,873
Okay. Okay, great. I almost forgot. The weekend read.

116
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,072
If I do say so myself,

117
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,979
I thought that the Antarctica submission was pretty good. Have you read it?

118
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,707
Absolutely not. Why would I do that?

119
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,183
Let me explain something to you.

120
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,880
All your best books have everything you need to know in the first five pages

121
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,923
and the last five pages, okay?

122
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,582
Here we go. Woman meets man.

123
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,217
Pregnant. War. Alone.

124
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,124
War over. Baby older. New man.

125
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,756
Happily ever after. Bestseller.

126
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:07,955
Wow.

127
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,228
Did you prepare the conference room?

128
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,997
Yeah. PowerPoint's all set up, nobody knows a thing.

129
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,133
Okay. Well, get out of here.

130
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,675
Everyone here is familiar with Dr. Sinja.

131
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,669
Dr. Sinja is the most popular

132
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:21,940
nondenominational religious leader on the planet.

133
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,577
He's a holistic healer and a New Age dispenser of wisdom

134
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,712
with a following in the tens of millions.

135
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,849
This guy can fill up a football stadium on a Tuesday.

136
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,422
<i>Our conventional spirit guides always ask the seeker,</i>

137
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,895
<i>"What do you want?"</i>

138
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,194
<i>I challenge you to ask yourself,</i>

139
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,233
<i>"What does life want from me?"</i>

140
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:49,797
<i>"What does the greater purpose want from me?"</i>

141
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,436
Look at this guy's attendance figures.

142
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,310
He's outselling C閘ine Dion, U2,

143
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,679
Billy Graham and Hannah Montana!

144
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,715
What's his actual philosophy?

145
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,320
"In quiet, there is truth." Some shit like that. Something like that.

146
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,756
Just your typical New Age bullshit crap.

147
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,386
That's what my Aunt May used to call it. New Age bullshit crap.

148
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,631
And if anybody can sell some New Age bullshit crap, it's me.

149
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,723
Jack, it's a spiritual movement.

150
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,529
Yeah, I have a spiritual movement every time I eat a bran muffin.

151
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,937
- God! - All right, all right, Jack.

152
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,406
Assuming you can actually get an audience with the guy,

153
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,602
you're not the only agent in town who has this information.

154
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,111
What makes you think you can talk Sinja into signing with you?

155
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,209
I'm Jack McCall. This is what I do.

156
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,446
Hey, I can talk anybody into doing anything.

157
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,882
<i>Help me sing it</i>

158
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,083
Breathe in.

159
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,593
And release.

160
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:22,730
Quiet your mind until there are no thoughts.

161
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,636
Then you can see your true nature.

162
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,164
Your face before your parents were born.

163
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,270
"Your face before your parents were born"?

164
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,609
That's a great title for a kids' show.

165
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,908
It has many names.

166
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,783
Nirvana, kensho, bliss,

167
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:44,950
divinity, illumination. Let's call it the Blue Pearl.

168
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,395
It's okay. Our truth can be painful.

169
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,230
Pain is the touchstone of growth.

170
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,628
- That'd be a badass T-shirt. - It's okay.

171
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,634
Laugh, cry. They're close cousins.

172
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,003
Just let it out.

173
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,450
He sees the Blue Pearl.

174
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:17,113
It's okay. It's okay.

175
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,294
Students meditate for years

176
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,996
and never see what you have seen today.

177
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,732
Your inner self.

178
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,138
That makes you a very special person, Mr...

179
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,232
McCall.

180
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,407
Jack McCall. Thank you so much.

181
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,674
Sorry, I don't know what happened.

182
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,549
I just got overcome with emotion. I'm sorry.

183
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,918
My years and years of focused silence

184
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,048
just finally delivered me to...

185
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,525
- Enlightenment? - Enlightenment, yes. Enlightenment.

186
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,856
Sorry. Hold that a second.

187
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,293
I'm so sorry. Play it four times and it stops.

188
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,505
That is bad.

189
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:17,337
Oh, the Blue Pearl.

190
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,817
The Blue Pearl is so blue.

191
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,944
The Blue Pearl is so shiny

192
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,554
and so pearly.

193
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,222
"Three things will not long be hidden.

194
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,386
"The sun, the moon,

195
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,923
"and the truth."

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,628
Is there a reason for your visit today, Jack McCall?

197
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,864
Well, sir, I am not one to waste time.

198
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:40,997
I understand you've written a book.

199
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,763
That is true.

200
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,367
Well, I'm an agent.

201
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,571
And all my career I've dreamed that I'd get to represent

202
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,114
someone who I believed in. I believe in you.

203
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,851
And I think I can help you to change the world.

204
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:56,879
I'm not interested.

205
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:00,380
Really?

206
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,325
Dr. Sinja? Dr. Sinja, the world

207
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,328
is filled with lost, Ionely souls in need of your wisdom.

208
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,627
And they're out there calling out to you

209
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:12,401
in quiet desperation. I hear them, I feel them.

210
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,496
Arert you amazed by trees?

211
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,070
Yeah, sure!

212
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,701
I love trees!

213
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,246
Trees, I love them. I love trees.

214
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,804
The branches and the leaves. It's just...

215
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,316
You know, some people want fame and money.

216
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,148
Just give me some nature, some branches and some trees.

217
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,209
I love it.

218
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:31,613
In fact, I have such an affinity towards trees

219
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,453
I think I might even have been a bird in another life.

220
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,492
Just...

221
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,731
Landing on a branch. Taking it all in.

222
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,567
I want to be a bird. I want to be a bird and I want to swallow your philosophy.

223
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,935
And then I'm gonna spit it back into the mouths

224
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:47,995
of the children of the world.

225
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,173
Nourish their souls. Help you to grow, watch your wings spread,

226
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,101
and help you to soar.

227
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,172
What are you talking about?

228
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,277
I'm talking about presenting your book to the world.

229
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,683
Have you read it?

230
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,689
Of course I have.

231
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,952
So what's in it for you?

232
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,161
Just the satisfaction of knowing that I helped my hero to save the world.

233
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,229
And 10%, of course.

234
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,697
Shit!

235
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,164
The tree gave me a splinter!

236
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,337
The Bodhi tree did nothing. It did not move.

237
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,035
We all create our own destiny, Jack.

238
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:29,314
Dr. Sinja, if you commit to me, I'll give you all that I am.

239
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,679
Mind, body and spirit. Everything.

240
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,616
Let me be a big bird.

241
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,315
Hawk!

242
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,082
Or sparrow.

243
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,558
Pick a bird, I'm it.

244
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,358
You agree to have my book published?

245
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,358
I'm begging you for it!

246
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,563
And you will spread my philosophy in the way I meant it to be spread?

247
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,366
That goes without saying. You have my word, sir.

248
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,999
Remember, our words have a profound

249
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,342
rippling effect on the entire universe.

250
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,506
Well, I'm counting on that.

251
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,012
<i>- Jack McCall's office. - Aaron!</i>

252
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:07,880
I want you to run out and buy me a throne,

253
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,547
and a scepter and a crown, because I am the king!

254
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,381
Oh, my God, Mr. McCall. You signed him, didn't you?

255
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,359
You bet your ass I signed him.

256
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,258
Never doubt me! Never doubt me!

257
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,452
<i>How about that?</i>

258
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,361
<i>Hey, I want you to clear my schedule for the rest of the day.</i>

259
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,295
I want to go spend some time with my mother!

260
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,131
Let her know what a big star her boy is!

261
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,530
Okay, done, sire.

262
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,078
Raymond! Is that you?

263
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,883
No, it's not Raymond. It's Jack, Ma. Your son, Jack.

264
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:48,118
Raymond, I knew you wouldn't miss my birthday.

265
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:50,491
I'm not Raymond. I'm Jack, Ma.

266
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:52,723
Oh, you look good, Raymond.

267
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,924
Mommy, Raymond was your husband.

268
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,263
He left. I'm your son, Jack.

269
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,270
I stayed. You raised me. Remember?

270
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,164
- How you doing, Emily? - Hey, Jack.

271
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,368
Okay, Annie, now that your guest is here,

272
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,933
we can have some dinner.

273
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,809
Sorry to keep calling you, but she's slipping a bit more these days.

274
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,246
Now she won't eat without Raymond.

275
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,113
Raymond is your dad?

276
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,515
Yeah, he was. He's dead now.

277
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:15,485
- I'm sorry. - I'm not.

278
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,653
You sure she should be drinking these margaritas?

279
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:18,985
Don't worry.

280
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,652
'Cause unlike me, these margaritas are virgins.

281
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,130
Speaking of which, hey, Milt!

282
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,131
<i>I can see your cojones in that pantsuit.</i>

283
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,170
It's like you're smuggling walnuts in a polyester purse!

284
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:33,727
Okay, all right.

285
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,173
Tonight it's fajitas and taquitos with fresh guacamole.

286
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:38,800
<i>Oh, gracias, Tim.</i>

287
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,210
How you doir, Mom? You okay?

288
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,614
Look at that suit. You look like a gangster.

289
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,511
Why don't you wear that suit we got married in?

290
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,853
Because I'm Jack, your son, Ma,

291
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,256
and I got to wear clothes like this because I need it for my work.

292
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,090
I'm a big agent, remember? Hey, I made a big deal today.

293
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:58,955
Jack?

294
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:03,624
Raymond, Jack never forgave you for leaving.

295
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,193
- Ma! - And Jack missed my birthday again.

296
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:09,035
Mom, I'm Jack. I'm your son. I'm here!

297
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,601
What?

298
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,440
Happy birthday, Mom.

299
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,454
And Caroline says hello.

300
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,220
Raymond,

301
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:34,094
is that you?

302
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:38,300
No, Ma. It's me, Jack. Your son.

303
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,310
I'm going to get going now and get back to work, so...

304
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,677
Love you.

305
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,460
<i>Hola, Gaudencio. You're here late, huh?</i>

306
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:07,022
Hi, Mr. McCall. The sprinkler, it die, but I fix it.

307
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,795
Okay.

308
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,772
This is it. It's a beautiful house, Jack.

309
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,008
The neighborhood is so sweet.

310
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,544
There are kids everywhere.

311
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,635
While I was there,

312
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:23,408
an ice cream truck actually came through.

313
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,541
I mean, it's just...

314
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:28,012
It's perfect for us.

315
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,146
But this house is perfect for us.

316
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,180
We made Tyler in this house.

317
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,554
We made Tyler in this room.

318
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,150
We made Tyler on this table. Tyler...

319
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:40,858
Okay. If we're going to stay in this house, which I'm willing to do,

320
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,730
we have to do some work to make it safer.

321
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,626
More family friendly.

322
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,830
What are you talking about? This place is perfectly safe.

323
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:50,341
No. Look, just beyond these polished concrete floors

324
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,967
is a non-fenced pool

325
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,245
that backs up to a cliff with a sheer drop of 2,000 feet.

326
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,450
Well, look, maybe we should let the kid grow up

327
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,453
and tell us where he wants to live.

328
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,512
It's a bachelor pad!

329
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,579
He's a bachelor!

330
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,558
Okay. We cannot raise a family in this house.

331
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,652
Hey, look, I bought this house on my potential

332
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,094
and then I earned it. I love this house.

333
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,656
I love it, too, but I'm changing Tyler at the bar.

334
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,126
He sleeps in your media room.

335
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,762
It's like we're guests in your house.

336
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,901
It's just time.

337
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,543
You know, moving is a huge change.

338
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:30,878
I know, but so was getting married,

339
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,746
and having a baby.

340
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:36,254
And those turned out to be really nice changes, right?

341
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,182
Okay, let's do it.

342
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,022
Really?

343
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,764
Let's paint the media room.

344
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,667
Yeah, let's put some ducks in there and some can'toon figures

345
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,364
and, you know, just keep it mid-century modern, though.

346
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:54,427
Mid-century modern ducks.

347
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,303
- Yeah, mid-century modern and ducks. - That's fantastic.

348
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,637
That actually sounds kinda hot.

349
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,539
An all new low for you, Jack.

350
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,637
- Hey, now what are you doing? - I'm cleaning up.

351
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,517
- What the hell was that? - An earthquake?

352
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,626
I've been in an earthquake. That wasrt an earthquake.

353
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,857
I'm gonna check on Tyler!

354
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,012
This is a beautiful tree, my friend.

355
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,557
Please, tell me why you would plant a tree

356
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,024
right in the middle of the patio.

357
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,492
I no plant the tree.

358
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,858
You no plant the tree?

359
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,295
I've been here all day fixing the sprinkler.

360
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,026
I coming back to pick up my things

361
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,091
and, boom, it's a tree here.

362
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,500
"Boom, it's a tree here"?

363
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,662
Boom.

364
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,942
Hey, this is that tree that bit me.

365
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,743
Why the hell would he send me something like this?

366
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,008
What, is this a joke or something?

367
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,071
He must think it's a gift.

368
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,717
Well, now I'm stuck with this goddamned thing?

369
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,619
I was gonna just send him a nice wine or, you know,

370
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,384
a Harry and David's Fruit of the Month.

371
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,087
Or a massage. Or Mrs. Fields cookies.

372
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,186
Exactly.

373
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,027
You want me to get rid of it?

374
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,933
No, I gotta make nice. I'll keep it. This is my tree now.

375
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,836
<i>- Okay, Mr. McCall. See you ma馻na. - Thanks.</i>

376
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,578
Sorta classy.

377
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,856
- Mr. McCall? - Faster, Aaron.

378
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,022
Please, be less dumb, but be quicker about it.

379
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,759
I got a splitting headache today.

380
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,822
Are you sick?

381
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,267
No, I think I'm having an allergic reaction or something.

382
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,704
Well, this should cheer you up. Here's your crown.

383
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,036
And the throne's on order.

384
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,941
But they offered me a scepter, so I bought it.

385
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:15,905
Are you a moron?

386
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,671
No.

387
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,245
So Sinja sent his book over, and...

388
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,719
- How great is it? - You read it?

389
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,649
How many times do we have to go through this?

390
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,917
I don't read!

391
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,288
Once again, how was Sinja's book?

392
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,883
No, let me tell you. It was scintillating, huh?

393
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,894
You couldn't stop reading it, just like it was your latest copy

394
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:31,986
<i>of Juggs magazine, right?</i>

395
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,626
It is a quick read, that's fair.

396
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,962
Way to go, Sinja!

397
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,229
It's almost like the book was written for you.

398
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,930
Of course it was! Listen, this book is...

399
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,597
Five pages long.

400
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:48,169
Five pages long?

401
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:49,838
Five pages long.

402
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,349
As in one, two, three, four...

403
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,112
Five. The end.

404
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,317
But look at it this way. It's the perfect book for you

405
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,686
because the first five pages

406
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,453
and the last five pages are the whole book.

407
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,687
Okay, Aaron, come on.

408
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,389
Tell me that you're pulling my pecker on this one, right?

409
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,589
Oh, I wish I could.

410
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,997
I mean, not your pecker, but...

411
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,757
Let me see it.

412
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,767
- My... - The book!

413
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,200
No.

414
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,546
- That's the book? - That's the book.

415
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:32,850
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna go down to that ashram

416
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,726
and I'm gonna ram this up his ass!

417
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,155
It's just the dedication, right?

418
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,958
Or the teaser? Or the thank you's.

419
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,897
Jack, you said you loved my book.

420
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,958
That wasrt a book you gave me, it was a pamphlet!

421
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:45,366
I've read menus that were longer!

422
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,530
I read a stop sign on the way here that was longer than that!

423
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:51,940
Now, my book is a journey of self-discovery.

424
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,070
Now, that journey is fulfilled by page five.

425
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,239
Okay, it's coming together now.

426
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,679
You know, you got a lot of tricks up your sleeve.

427
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,616
First, the magic tree. Then the book with five pages.

428
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:02,346
What's next? You gonna get on a magic yoga mat

429
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,615
and fly around in a circle?

430
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:05,451
Then you rub your stomach, but then, whoosh,

431
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,424
the genie jumps out of my ass?

432
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,456
Bless you, Jack. Are you okay?

433
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,191
I'm having an allergic reaction.

434
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,062
It's probably from that tree you sent me.

435
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,228
I sent you a tree?

436
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,262
See?

437
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,835
So this is where the tree went.

438
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,767
What?

439
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,401
Interesting.

440
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,510
What's so interesting?

441
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,908
These branches don't have a single leaf.

442
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,882
You know, I noticed that, too.

443
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,447
Jack?

444
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,751
Look at the tree and say something.

445
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,788
Say what?

446
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:54,965
What's so funny?

447
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,708
This is amazing. Don't you see?

448
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,806
Hey, you know, it almost seems like every time I say something,

449
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,371
some of the...

450
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,185
Hello?

451
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:21,723
Hel...

452
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,426
...Io!

453
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,897
<i>I want my baby back baby back, baby back</i>

454
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,967
<i>I want my baby back, baby back ribs</i>

455
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,205
Shit!

456
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,173
Hey, how are you doing this?

457
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,116
Me? I'm doing nothing.

458
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,484
You and this tree are now connected.

459
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,023
Connected?

460
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,856
It seems like all your talking is making you sick.

461
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,562
Hey, my talking is not making me sick.

462
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:57,668
Oh, really? What happens when a tree loses all its leaves, Jack?

463
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,930
So what are you trying to say, Sinja?

464
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,701
It's obvious to me, the more you talk,

465
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,866
the more leaves fall, the sicker you get.

466
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,639
The sicker I get?

467
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,439
So what happens if all the leaves fall off the tree?

468
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,882
That usually means the tree is dead.

469
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,947
Hey, wait a second. Hold on a second.

470
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,178
You telling me that you think

471
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,243
whatever happens to the tree happens to me?

472
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:17,310
Yes.

473
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,653
So I could die!

474
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:24,183
Yes, but you would die in the most amazing way possible.

475
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,952
I could die?

476
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,625
Or someone could turn you into a coffee table.

477
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,463
Hey, Sinja, you know, you're a real funny dude to stand here

478
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,561
making jokes when my life is being controlled by this magic tree!

479
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,397
How many leaves you think are left on this tree?

480
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,640
A thousand?

481
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,035
So what do I got, a thousand words left?

482
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,540
Now you have 993.

483
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,346
One word, one leaf.

484
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,750
Well, I know how to make this shit stop.

485
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,896
Oh, no, no, you shouldn't do this.

486
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,231
- That is murder! - Yeah, and it's premeditated, too!

487
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,789
Jack, you shouldn't do this!

488
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,427
You know what, Sinja? You worry about pages six through 200

489
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,630
and you let me worry about Mr. Tricky Tree over here!

490
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,106
And on that note, one last final word!

491
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,642
Timber!

492
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,879
Be glad you don't own a chainsaw.

493
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:26,147
Why did you do this to me?

494
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,317
I didn't do this. I wouldn't know how.

495
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:29,826
So, what, the universe cursed me?

496
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:33,591
Maybe. This is between you and the tree.

497
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,566
Hey, wait a minute. If this is real, what am I supposed to do?

498
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,660
You ever heard of this before? You ever seen anything like this?

499
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,264
I've never seen it,

500
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,034
but there is a story of an old monk that had a tree like this.

501
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,235
I always thought it was just a story.

502
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,210
He became very famous and honored.

503
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,568
So he lived.

504
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,137
No, he died.

505
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,239
Jesus.

506
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:54,080
No, his name was Stan.

507
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,813
I'm leaving for Bolivia tonight.

508
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,447
A spiritual retreat in Potos?called La Paz.

509
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,321
Let me talk to my colleagues there about you and your tree.

510
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,985
Bolivia? Well, when you coming back?

511
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,789
- In three days. - Three days?

512
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,296
What am I supposed to do until then?

513
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,332
If I were you, Jack, I'd be quiet.

514
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,692
Don't talk for three days. How hard can it be?

515
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,499
Hello!

516
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,901
Shit.

517
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,574
Come on, Jack.

518
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,011
What is the purpose in cursing you with a tree

519
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,612
that loses a leaf with every word you speak?

520
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,589
That is ridiculous!

521
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,457
I guess you're right.

522
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,488
It's crazy!

523
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,226
It's ridiculous!

524
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,598
Did you see that?

525
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:50,902
See what?

526
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:54,411
A leaf with every word! Jack, you slay me!

527
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,740
Oh, Lord Jesus! God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, my God!

528
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,547
God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

529
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,397
Morning.

530
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,886
Good morning, sir. What can I get started for you today?

531
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,830
What size?

532
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,936
All right, three venti lattes.

533
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:29,267
Would you care for a pastry? No?

534
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,107
Oh, mocha! Three mocha lattes.

535
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:40,276
Double chocolate-chip muffin! Yum!

536
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,820
You want three Paul McCan'tney CDs. Awesome.

537
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,494
You know, I love the Beatles. They are my life.

538
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,264
Assassination! Abraham Lincoln!

539
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:04,130
You, me, gun, shoot!

540
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,133
Three shots.

541
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,108
I know, I'm a little slow today.

542
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,877
All right, so three lattes, three mochas,

543
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,582
double chocolate-chip muffin and three shots.

544
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,950
No assassinations.

545
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,186
And three Paul McCan'tney CDs.

546
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,586
That's gonna be $68.12.

547
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,974
Could you tell me when it's safe to cross?

548
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,278
Are you deaf? I said,

549
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:48,650
"Can you tell me when it's safe to cross?"

550
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,754
It is? Thanks, fella!

551
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,365
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

552
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,102
Hey, my brother, what's happening,
brother? What's going on?

553
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,642
Hey! Was that a drive-by? What was that?

554
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,114
Somebody tell me, was that a drive-by?

555
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,848
Thanks, son! White people sure is nice!

556
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,247
Hey, Mr. McCall.

557
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,185
Hey, about my book, any chance you read it yet?

558
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,591
Great story, right?

559
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:07,427
Oh, you did read it. Oh, God, and you hate the story.

560
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,396
Okay, but the writing is good, right?

561
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,134
No? Well, why don't you lie to me?

562
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,570
You've been lying to me for three years about how you couldn't read it.

563
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,698
Now suddenly you read it, you hate it,

564
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,537
it sucks and you just smash my hopes

565
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:20,736
on the rocks of "Hey, Wayne, go back to Nebraska

566
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:21,904
"and shave sheep with your dad."

567
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,606
You don't know what it's like to be a writer. I hate myself.

568
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,481
I hate myself, do you get that? I hate myself!

569
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,958
I'll park your car.

570
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,326
Yeah, I'll park your car, Mr. Encouragement.

571
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,761
Mr. McCall, thank God you're here.

572
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,493
I have a lot of messages.

573
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,432
Do you want to start with the most recent or the most urgent?

574
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,168
You got a sore throat? Okay, don't talk.

575
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:50,263
Okay. How about some tea?

576
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:53,208
Cough medicine? How about a notepad to write on?

577
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,870
Okay.

578
00:31:56,948 --> 00:32:00,645
Well, then how am I supposed to know what you want me to...

579
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,616
Mr. McCall, are you not speaking to me because you're mad at me?

580
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,723
You found out that I left work early yesterday. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

581
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,954
Okay, I have stomach problems

582
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,589
and I had to run home because I can't use public bathrooms.

583
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,631
I'm seeing a therapist about it.

584
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,892
Okay.

585
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,130
Jack, is this about the Christmas party?

586
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,260
I'm so sorry.

587
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,671
That was the peach schnapps that tried to kiss your wife, not me.

588
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,140
I mean, I don't want to kiss your wife,

589
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,506
even though her lips felt like heaven.

590
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:28,634
I'm gonna go.

591
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,284
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

592
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,656
You found my video camera with the furry tapes.

593
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:42,618
Pardon me, Mr. McCall.

594
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:43,682
Samantha asked me to get you.

595
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,194
She wants to introduce you to somebody.

596
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,888
Yeah, Mary, the jig's up, okay?

597
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,329
He knows what we do in here,

598
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,994
in his office, after work, on his desk, in his chair.

599
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:54,133
Mr. McCall, I just want to say, first of all,

600
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,503
you know, she's the one that always wanted to be the filthier animals,

601
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:59,372
like the skunk and the naughty beaver.

602
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,968
I tried to be the more dignified animals

603
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,104
like the wolf and the California black bear.

604
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,170
And don't hurt me, I'm sorry.

605
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,217
It's just this sexual hunger I have. It's insatiable.

606
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,616
I mean, you understand. You're a...

607
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,916
You want to go outside and settle this like men?

608
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:13,581
All right, fine! Let's do it.

609
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,717
No, I didn't mean it! I'm sorry.

610
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,586
Jack, I have to introduce you

611
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,427
to Christian L間er de la Touffe, European market.

612
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,433
<i>Christian, this is Le Jack.</i>

613
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:26,965
<i>Bonjour. I've heard a lot about you.</i>

614
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,235
Jack, tell Christian the whole story about Sinja.

615
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,742
Tell him all the great details. Go ahead.

616
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,835
<i>Ecoutez. You're going to die.</i>

617
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:41,382
Life is a journey.

618
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,379
Life is a what?

619
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,652
Life is a journey?

620
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,501
Can you repeat that, please?

621
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,667
Life is a journey.

622
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,171
"Life is a journey."

623
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,910
Life is a journey, yeah.

624
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:10,970
I don't get it.

625
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,865
You like to party on us.

626
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,152
- Good afternoon. - Hi.

627
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,684
Jack McCall.

628
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,890
Yes, Mr. McCall, your party is waiting for you. Right this way.

629
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,296
You want me to do all the talking?

630
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:05,358
No, no, no, I can't, I don't know what to say.

631
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,233
Just do what you would do? Is that good?

632
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,273
Wait, wait, wait, okay. Let's have signs,

633
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,776
like if I'm doing well, you pull on your ear. Okay?

634
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,614
And then that can mean that I need to do better. That's fine, too.

635
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,785
We were starting to think you stood us up.

636
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:25,117
Robert Gilmore, VP of Acquisitions.

637
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:28,750
This is Gil Reed, head of Marketing at Simon and Schuster.

638
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,262
Handshake. Come on, man, we are brothers!

639
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:34,559
Hit me hard and high, Gil.

640
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,359
Bam! That's right.

641
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,802
Aaron Wiseberger, agent, friend of mankind

642
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:41,565
and a lover of every book you guys have ever published.

643
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,072
Come on, what is this, Mickey D's?

644
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,869
Let's get some service up in here!

645
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,910
Got a man with a bad case of the dry mouth!

646
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,446
Why don't you sit your ass down, come on.

647
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,280
Good afternoon, can I get you something to drink?

648
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:58,048
How about the distillery to start off with, huh?

649
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,282
Vodka, rocks for me.

650
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,053
Four waters for the table, and this fine guy right here,

651
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,718
is gonna have a hot toddy. His voice is shot.

652
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:04,783
But you know what?

653
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,422
That's what he gets for screaming for more lap dances all night!

654
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,432
You crazy bastard.

655
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,500
I have four waters, vodka rocks, hot toddy.

656
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,798
My man.

657
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,412
Gentlemen, we don't want to play games on this one.

658
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:30,884
Good, games are for children.

659
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,116
The statistics speak for themselves.

660
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,658
Dr. Sinja has a huge fan base around the world.

661
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,126
We want to be the company to broaden that fan base here.

662
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:39,924
We think we have a great offer.

663
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,932
A $250,000 advance against 15% of the gross.

664
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,326
That sounds great.

665
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,597
All right, I'ma need y'all to quit playing with me and pull out your big guns

666
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:53,876
because this is "Show Me Your Dick" time, fellas!

667
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,380
Damn, Jack, look at you, sweating like a bitch.

668
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,349
Just chill out, homey. I got this. Gil, come here.

669
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,511
Gil, what I need from... Stay with me.

670
00:37:02,586 --> 00:37:04,554
What I need from you is to bring that paper.

671
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,816
You know, you got to turn the volume up

672
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,414
on that offer, homey, 'cause I can't hear it.

673
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,487
I'm a young man. My ears are good. I can't hear it.

674
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,721
We can't go higher if we haven't even seen the book yet.

675
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,627
That's what it sounds like.

676
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,495
Look, you can't expect us to bid higher

677
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,624
when we haven't seen the book, can you?

678
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:18,964
That's ridiculous.

679
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,901
Do you know who the hell you're talking to?

680
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:23,872
I'm Aaron Wiseberger! You better recognize, son!

681
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:27,138
I find both your language and demeanor insulting and intolerable.

682
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:31,238
Simon and Schuster doesn't do business with spineless jerks. Gil?

683
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,215
No, no, no, wait! Wait, gentlemen, wait.

684
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,946
Listen, I'm sorry if I offended you back there.

685
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,045
I was just doing my agent act.

686
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,324
You know? I mean, I don't even have a real degree.

687
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,052
I went to community college,

688
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:46,028
and that was only because my grandma was sleeping with the dean.

689
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,361
Good luck, gentlemen. You'll need it.

690
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:54,228
<i>The wheels on the bus go round and round</i>

691
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,401
<i>Round and round, round and round</i>

692
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,907
<i>The wheels on the bus go round and round</i>

693
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,969
<i>All through the town</i>

694
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,036
Wait a minute, Dads.

695
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,007
We have a lip syncher.

696
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,213
Mouther.

697
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,282
Everyone needs to sing along, Dad.

698
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,950
See, 'cause Tyler's taking his cues from you, okay?

699
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,859
He really needs you to sing along.

700
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,026
<i>The wipers on the bus go...</i>

701
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,462
<i>Swish...</i>

702
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,606
<i>Swish, swish, swish</i>

703
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,569
<i>Swish, swish, swish</i>

704
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,141
<i>Swish, swish, swish</i>

705
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:40,911
<i>The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish</i>

706
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,977
<i>All through the town</i>

707
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,449
Okay, Tyler, are you ready to go to the moon?

708
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:52,056
Here we go!

709
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,298
He's finally down.

710
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,033
Can we talk?

711
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,207
It's kind of funny how you got singled out in that class

712
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,306
for not knowing the words, right?

713
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,944
I mean, Jack McCall not knowing the words?

714
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,009
That's a rarity.

715
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,650
It was really sweet, Jack.

716
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:24,888
It makes me very happy to see the two of you in that circle.

717
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:32,133
I think it's really important that you guys have at least one thing

718
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,693
that you do together, you know?

719
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,771
So, they offer it twice a week.

720
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:41,175
Which day would you prefer, Tuesday or Wednesday?

721
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:43,773
Can't.

722
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,239
You can't.

723
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,519
You can't take one hour out of your week

724
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,579
to be with your son? I don't understand.

725
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,832
What, the pool? The view? Wow.

726
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,960
I am trying to talk to you about our child

727
00:40:06,136 --> 00:40:07,501
and you want to fight about the house again?

728
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:11,569
Look, honey, could you just try for a second to talk to me about Tyler?

729
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,372
Just be here with me right now. What...

730
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,055
Apparently not. Okay, that's good to know.

731
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,622
Sorry!

732
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,783
Sorry?

733
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,095
I'll let your son know that you're "sorry."

734
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,231
My life.

735
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,795
It's our life, Jack.

736
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,909
I know that when we fell in love, it was a whirlwind romance

737
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,468
and then it seems like I brought up the idea of having a baby,

738
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,708
and, like, overnight we were pregnant.

739
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,513
But that's just how life works sometimes.

740
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:00,018
Have you ever heard the expression, "Man plans, God laughs"?

741
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,649
Two days.

742
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,991
Two? Two days till what?

743
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,329
Jack, what? To what?

744
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,859
Honey, you got to talk to me!

745
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,563
What? You're like a mental patient

746
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:16,331
with the pointing and the grunting. What?

747
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,270
All of my talking is making you sick.

748
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:24,771
That's great. You know what?

749
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:27,677
I won't talk anymore. How about that? You don't want to talk?

750
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,116
I don't want to talk, either.

751
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,639
<i>Welcome to the international directory.</i>

752
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,198

00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:54,676

00:41:54,878 --> 00:41:55,902
Yes!

<i>What country would you like the code for?</i>

756

<i>I'm sorry. I couldn't make that out.</i>

758

00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,553

00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:30,268
Yes!

767

<i>Hello? This is Dr. Sinja. Who's calling?</i>

768
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,743
<i>Who's calling?</i>

769
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,720
Jack McCall!

770
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,624
<i>Jack! Yes, well, you're calling for an update, yes?</i>

00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:51,431
<i>I'm sorry, Jack, I forgot. Trying to save our words, right?</i>

772
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,767
<i>Just make an animal noise if I'm correct.</i>

773
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,605
<i>Good. Well, I have nothing yet,</i>

774
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:04,171
<i>but I return tomorrow and I shall call you as soon as I land.</i>

775
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,579
<i>Bye, Jack!</i>

776
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:08,974
Dickhead!

777
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:12,817
"Dickhead" is one word!

778
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,785
You are messing with the wrong guy!

779
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:22,257
What's up, my man? Can I get something started for you today?

780
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,803
Sure. Venti triple-shot latte.

781
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,907
Venti triple-shot iced latte.

782
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,082
Extra milk?

783
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,287
Jack! What the hell happened at lunch yesterday?

784
00:43:46,356 --> 00:43:48,916
I got a call from Simon and Schuster. They're pulling out of the deal.

785
00:43:48,992 --> 00:43:51,483
They said some twerp junior agent came to the meeting with you,

786
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:54,224
that he was rude, uncouth and stupid!

787
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,289
Now I have teed up Random House perfectly here,

788
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:58,960
so don't screw this up, too. These guys are ready to pay.

789
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,470
Just keep it down to business and it's a done deal.

790
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:02,562
Miss Davis?

791
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,573
I've got Mr. Parker from Random House on the line.

792
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:06,973
Okay, here we go. It's a no-brainer, Jack.

793
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,205
A deaf mute could close this deal.

794
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:10,913
I'm late for a meeting. Call me when you're done?

795
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,309
You promise you're gonna call me?

796
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,453
Don't let me down, Jack.

797
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:27,087
<i>Jack!</i>

798
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:31,300
Don Parker. I got Sarah Elliot, Rick Panero with us.

799
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:34,504
<i>Jack, are you there?</i>

800
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,835
<i>Hello? Jack, are you there?</i>

801
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,100
Hello?

802
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:40,604
Good.

803
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:43,907
<i>Hey, I guess Samantha told you we were interested.</i>

804
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,173
<i>Great.</i>

805
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,813
So what do you say we make a deal?

806
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,145
<i>Jack?</i>

807
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,655
Hello? You want to get started or no?

808
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,119
<i>Good. Okay, listen.</i>

809
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,389
Let's skip the formalities, get right down to specifics.

810
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,487
<i>We talked internally.</i>

811
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:04,022
<i>We thought a realistic offer would be 250.</i>

812
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,693
<i>What do you say?</i>

813
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,429
<i>What if I bumped it up to 275?</i>

814
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,807
<i>You really need to consider the 275.</i>

815
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,103
<i>Why don't you run it by your people?</i>

816
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,401
We'll wait.

817
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:21,842
Okay, okay, okay.

818
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:25,816
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

819
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,461
I just need to borrow this for a minute. I'll explain later.

820
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,018
I need to borrow this. It's for Jack.

821
00:45:33,096 --> 00:45:34,529
Rachel, I think there's some real secret shit

822
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:37,431
that I'm gonna start telling everybody if you don't give me the damn doll!

823
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,234
So what's the verdict on the 275?

824
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,796
Are you in, are you out?

825
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,135
<i>We haven't even seen the book.</i>

826
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,676
What's the problem? You don't trust our publicity department?

827
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,376
<i>You're damn right they are! So what's the hang up?</i>

828
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:00,154
<i>Hey, you gonna start throwing insults?</i>

829
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:02,715
Listen, if that's the way you're gonna handle this,

830
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:05,261
we'll just call the whole deal off. Check the attitude.

831
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:09,631
<i>All right, Jack, look. Just throw me a bone here.</i>

832
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,361
What if I bumped it up to 300?

833
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,334
Fine! I give up! Five hundred!

834
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,577
<i>If I get 500 approved,</i>

835
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:24,636
are we closed?

836
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,117
You are gonna owe me so big next time, mister.

837
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:36,719
Tyler is teething, poor thing, and it's terrible, you know,

838
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:39,227
because he's not sleeping, I'm not sleeping.

839
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,059
Jack's not getting any ass?

840
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,796
Can you...

841
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:44,925
He won't even baby-proof the kitchen.

842
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,697
Why in the world would I give him some?

843
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,930
Are you wearing granny panties right now?

844
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:49,029
Excuse me?

845
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,666
Are you wearing granny panties right now?

846
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:53,173
And a nursing bra?

847
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:54,710
I am not answering that.

848
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,439
You don't have to.

849
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,412
I am doing the best I can.

850
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:00,978
I have a present for you.

851
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,308
What is that?

852
00:47:04,187 --> 00:47:06,621
Do not judge me by what's in this bag.

853
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:13,385
No.

854
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:17,126
No, I cannot do this.

855
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:18,590
Why not?

856
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,263
Because I am not that kind of girl.

857
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,465
That's why they make tequila.

858
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:26,341
Tequila plus ass equals happiness.

859
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:35,277
How can I help you, sir?

860
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,379
Meeting someone.

861
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,388
I was told you'd be punctual.

862
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,177
My! You're a wee slip of a thing, aren't you? But all right.

863
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:14,422
Climb aboard.

864
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,257
I'm so sorry about the mix-up.

865
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:21,988
Caroline McCall's in room 413.

866
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:37,305
You looking for someone?

867
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:47,619
I've been thinking about you all day,

868
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,461
about all the things I want to do

869
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,488
to you.

870
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,258
Let me help you.

871
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,300
Now why don't you

872
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,341
tell me what you want.

873
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,975
Tell me all the little

874
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:15,215
naughty things you want me to do to you.

875
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:19,655
Bow-chik-a-bow-wow.

876
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,690
Don't be scared, babe. Just spicing things up a bit.

877
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,499
Here's how it's gonna work, baby.

878
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:34,162
The more you say, the more I do.

879
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,231
So tell me what you want. Come on.

880
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,967
Talk dirty to me, Jack.

881
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,307
Don't you want me?

882
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,004
Yeah?

883
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,277
Come on, then say it.

884
00:49:48,351 --> 00:49:50,649
Tell me what you want me to do.

885
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,183
Yeah, yeah, talk dirty.

886
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,884
Come on, Jack.

887
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,984
Come on, you can do it, that's right.

888
00:49:58,061 --> 00:49:59,153
That's right, Jack, come on.

889
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,057
Come on, Jack, Jack.

890
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:02,865
Talk dirty to me, Jack!

891
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,995
I don't know what I was thinking.

892
00:50:08,738 --> 00:50:11,901
Honey, I just wanted to try to prove to you

893
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,306
that we could still have fun.

894
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,271
But I guess we can't.

895
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,473
So, I'm so embarrassed.

896
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:21,039
Okay, Jack, this isn't working.

897
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:28,656
We don't... We're not what we used to be.

898
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,420
I mean, not since Tyler was born.

899
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:32,121
It's just different.

900
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,789
It's like we've forgotten how to talk to each other.

901
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,059
I mean, don't you think it's different?

902
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,935
Jack, I don't even know if you love me anymore.

903
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,233
Are you still in love with me?

904
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,176
Okay, well, then, you have to say that,

905
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,144
you have to tell me that, okay?

906
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,577
I want to hear you say it.

907
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:52,980
I love you.

908
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:57,617
No, Jack, please, I need to hear it. Okay?

909
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:02,681
I need you to say, "Caroline, I love you, and I want to be with you.

910
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:07,093
"I want to spend the rest of my life with you and never let you go."

911
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,132
Can you please say that?

912
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,364
Can you say that?

913
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:15,960
Yes!

914
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:22,803
But that's it.

915
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,078
Okay.

916
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:30,176
Okay, so I think that we should see a professional,

917
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,585
somebody that we can sit down and talk to,

918
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:35,921
and they can help us figure out how to end all this.

919
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,087
What?

920
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,098
There's a tree.

921
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,438
Losing leaves. Strength.

922
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:58,908
When I talk, leaves go.

923
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,313
And when leaves go,

924
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,486
I die.

925
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,949
That's what this is about?

926
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,225
Some midlife crisis bullshit?

927
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,624
You're here to tell me this poem about your leaves falling,

928
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,668
like if you somehow communicate with me,

929
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,202
you're gonna be less of a man?

930
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,932
Jack, get out.

931
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,797
No, really.

932
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,136
Go.

933
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:30,204
I want to be alone, please.

934
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,845
Jack, now.

935
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:16,056
Jack! Hey, Sam is at lunch right now

936
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,095
closing your deal with Random House and don't kill me,

937
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:20,959
but I stepped away from my desk

938
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,329
and somebody sent a copy of Sinja's book over.

939
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:27,058
Are you mad?

940
00:53:33,943 --> 00:53:34,932
Oh, look who it is!

941
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:36,707
- Hey, Jack. - Hi, Jack.

942
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:39,240
What is this, casual Fridays?

943
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,408
Okay, look, we got to lock this up,

944
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:43,008
get them excited and signing before they change their minds.

945
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:45,179
Did you bring the book?

946
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,746
It's okay. Mary's bringing a copy later. Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

947
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,126
<i>You breathe that stuff in and, boom, it make you loco!</i>

948
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,264
Now we're all here.

949
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:00,701
All right, let me catch you up to speed.

950
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,898
We're talking about marketing and rollout strategies.

951
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:05,940
Marketing and rollout strategies.

952
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:11,012
I think we should all be thinking globally.

953
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:14,181
Boom!

954
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:19,082
<i>I was gonna clean my room Until I got high</i>

955
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,187
Are you okay, Jack?

956
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:26,117
Jack?

957
00:54:27,997 --> 00:54:30,363
Can I get you some water? All right.

958
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,128
Sir, may I bring you something to eat?

959
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:34,997
Maybe you'd like to start with a lovely salad.

960
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:44,975
He'll just have water, thank you.

961
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:46,404
Thank you very much.

962
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:51,381
Yes, it's getting us all quite giddy, the whole idea of it.

963
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,718
So, I think, as far as television goes,

964
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,553
we want a full-scale media blitz.

965
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,855
Morning shows, late night, all the talk shows.

966
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:00,119
With a book like this,

967
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:04,326
we can target discount stores, club chains, coffee shops.

968
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,765
I also think we should look at product tie-ins.

969
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:12,865
Like Sinja's diets or workout tapes.

970
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,910
Good idea.

971
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,913
I've prepared contracts, which you'll find at the back of your packets.

972
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,445
You'll notice that the price has gone up slightly

973
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:24,453
and that's to reflect the author's marketing commitments to this project.

974
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,455
No, thank you, Jack. I'm on Atkins.

975
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,091
But I really don't see any reason why we shouldn't go ahead

976
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:30,487
and sign this right now

977
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,257
so we can all move forward together as one professional team.

978
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,228
Jack!

979
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,360
Yeah, I could have just emailed this to you.

980
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:42,837
The book is just five pages.

981
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:45,699
I'm sorry, what?

982
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:47,333
I'm sorry, what?

983
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,909
Ira, I'm sure this is all some sort of misunderstanding.

984
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,210
- Samantha. - We'll be in touch.

985
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,919
Jack! What the hell is wrong with you?

986
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:01,619
Acting like a drunk 3-year-old at the table?

987
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,990
Not telling me that Sinja's book is five pages long?

988
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,861
Don't you have anything at all to say about this?

989
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:18,801
Jack, you're fired.

990
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,604
Okay, okay, please calm down.

991
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,809
I need you to relax, Mr. McCall.

992
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,818
'Cause I'm here to help you get your job back.

993
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,148
I am and we're gonna do it.

994
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:33,285
But right now, I'm just really concerned

995
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,823
about that vein in your neck exploding.

996
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:39,689
I'm going to get it this time, I promise. I promise. Here we go.

997
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:42,856
Okay, you.

998
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,225
Yes, that's you.

999
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:46,762
You...

1000
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:48,563
You're talking... You talk?

1001
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:52,636
Okay, we've established that. And it's snowing.

1002
00:56:53,142 --> 00:56:54,734
No? Okay. Okay, yeah.

1003
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:55,903
Obviously not snowing.

1004
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,169
The leaves.

1005
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,874
The leaves fall... The leaves fall off the tree.

1006
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:02,816
Okay. Okay.

1007
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,752
When you talk, all the leaves fall off the tree.

1008
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,989
Okay, this is fun. It's not fun. I didn't mean it like that.

1009
00:57:13,162 --> 00:57:16,063
And when all the leaves fall off the tree,

1010
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:17,855
you are asleep.

1011
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:20,792
Okay. You're not asleep.

1012
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,572
You're illegal. You're a stop sign?

1013
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:26,899
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1014
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:29,671
You're vogueing?

1015
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:30,906
You...

1016
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:34,978
When all the leaves fall off, you die!

1017
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:40,387
Oh, listen, I get it.

1018
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:43,415
I get it. I once took acid in college

1019
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,984
and I thought for sure that my hair had a heartbeat.

1020
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:49,164
But it didn't!

1021
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:56,494
Okay.

1022
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:01,232
Pancake.

1023
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:05,102
It's a coincidence.

1024
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,773
It's not a coincidence, you idiot!

1025
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:08,248
Look, you just lost five more!

1026
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:11,851
I'm sorry. Can I be really honest here?

1027
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:13,388
I think I know why Samantha fired you.

1028
00:58:14,223 --> 00:58:16,623
'Cause this is very crazy. This is like Britney territory.

1029
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,857
Okay, well said, Mr. McCall, but I'm gonna go.

1030
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:26,561
No, it's cool, we're cool. We're cool.

1031
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:34,466
Stay? You want me to keep an eye on the leaves?

1032
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:36,671
Okay.

1033
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:38,477
Never thought I'd miss the marshmallows.

1034
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:40,607
Wait, where are you going?

1035
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,445
To pray?

1036
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:45,411
To be an angel?

1037
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,322
Okay, got it. Good luck!

1038
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:54,621
Pancake.

1039
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,208
How about now?

1040
00:59:07,276 --> 00:59:08,538
Falling as we speak.

1041
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:13,608
Hello.

1042
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,177
Thank you. God bless you.

1043
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,321
Oh, my God, all the leaves just fell off.

1044
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:20,645
What?

1045
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,348
No, I'm kidding.

1046
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:29,823
God bless you.

1047
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,658
Hallelujah. Now what?

1048
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,094
Nope.

1049
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,510
Mittens! Mittens, come down!

1050
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:43,167
Come down, Mittens.

1051
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,181
Falling?

1052
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,288
Yeah, they are.

1053
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:02,888
And, Jack, Samantha's office called. They want me back.

1054
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:04,429
I'm sorry.

1055
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:10,325
Jackie, dinner time!

1056
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:19,802
Here you go, sweetie pie.

1057
01:01:20,409 --> 01:01:22,741
<i>- Voil? - I knew it was gonna be ham</i>

1058
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,006
and mashed potatoes!

1059
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:26,906
Mom, may I pick my piece first?

1060
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:30,077
You may, because you asked so politely.

1061
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,450
Thank you.

1062
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:34,222
There you go.

1063
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:38,152
Shake it, don't break it, Jackie!

1064
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:41,025
Hey, remember the "I Love Ham" dance? Do that dance.

1065
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:43,192
Jackie.

1066
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,934
Jackie, it's me. I mean, I'm you!

1067
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:49,631
Hey, Jackie, we're here! I'm us! Jackie, I'm here!

1068
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:51,434
No, Dad, you're not here.

1069
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:54,039
You were never here. You left.

1070
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:57,344
I'm not Dad.

1071
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:21,565
Pie. What a concept.

1072
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,507
You can't get pie in Bolivia, not like pie in America.

1073
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,372
Fruit pies, cream pies...

1074
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,340
Sorry.

1075
01:02:34,483 --> 01:02:35,609
It's quite amazing

1076
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,710
how many thoughtless words one can speak.

1077
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:39,813
Don't you think?

1078
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:42,681
You don't look well, Jack.

1079
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:51,795
Your marriage is over?

1080
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,364
She took the baby and left.

1081
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,109
Your job, too?

1082
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,583
Sorry, Jack.

1083
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:15,323
All I have for you are my beliefs, and, well,

1084
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:20,895
this snow globe from the airport.

1085
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,824
You unook me from this goddamned tree!

1086
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:26,994
- Please, Jack. - I'm dying!

1087
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,703
I know you're scared.

1088
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:36,041
And I know I told you I'd come back with the answer.

1089
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:39,342
Well, the answer is

1090
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,110
there is no answer.

1091
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,047
No one knows about this tree, Jack,

1092
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,953
and believe me, I tried. Okay?

1093
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:52,251
I don't know how this is going to work out for you,

1094
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:55,354
but what I do know is that you need to find peace.

1095
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,995
If you think I'm a charlatan, then why are you here?

1096
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:06,741
You want my advice?

1097
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,371
You need to find the truth about yourself.

1098
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:17,851
It's quite simple, Jack. You need to get quiet.

1099
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,754
Not just with your mouth, with your mind.

1100
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:25,316
And in that quiet, you will hear the truth.

1101
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:33,267
Do you have any other unresolved relationships in your life?

1102
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:37,664
Good.

1103
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,800
Good.

1104
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:45,513
Then your wife, does she know that you love her?

1105
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:46,946
I tell her that all the time!

1106
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:51,715
Words? More words, Jack.

1107
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:57,122
You tell her, like meaningless leaves that fly off a dying tree?

1108
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,221
Words.

1109
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:04,756
Can't you show her that you love her?

1110
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:11,299
Make peace. Show them that you love them.

1111
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,075
And be truthful.

1112
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:19,944
You need to accept the possibility

1113
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,444
that when all the leaves fall off that tree...

1114
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,950
Mr. McCall?

1115
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,823
Mr. McCall?

1116
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,926
Hey! I've been calling and emailing,

1117
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,987
and I got great ideas about how to save your job.

1118
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:11,830
Sinja's book can work.

1119
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,498
I know, I'm excited, too.

1120
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,902
We've been thinking about it all wrong.

1121
01:06:16,972 --> 01:06:19,304
Mr. McCall, are you listening?

1122
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:20,842
Are you okay?

1123
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,376
What'd you do to yourself?

1124
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:30,649
You smell like my dad.

1125
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,089
You need some help? No? Okay.

1126
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:48,031
I'm not sure that getting drunk is the best plan of attack right now.

1127
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:50,329
You.

1128
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,672
It's all your fault!

1129
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:58,075
Oh, yeah, how do you like that?

1130
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:00,676
Cheers!

1131
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,217
Freaking weed!

1132
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:12,157
Mr. McCall, stop talking. Come on.

1133
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:13,752
You know, fertilizer is crap!

1134
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:15,421
That means that technically, you eat shit!

1135
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:16,692
Stop talking, you idiot!

1136
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,864
Just stop!

1137
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,239
That's it.

1138
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:29,436
What?

1139
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,304
What are you doing?

1140
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:44,187
I'm ending it. And I'm ending it funky!

1141
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:49,586
Yeah, okay.

1142
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:51,855
It's a hot beat.

1143
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:54,402
That's the shit. That's Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes.

1144
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:58,270
Featuring Teddy Pendergrass! Sing that shit, Teddy!

1145

<i>Bad luck That's what you got</i>

1149
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:09,279
Done lost your woman.

1150
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:10,914
- I lost my woman. - Jack, shut up!

1151
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,921
You know what that means now? Not a goddamned thing!

1152
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,013
Jack, what are you doing? Stop talking.

1153
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:17,024
What does it matter? Look at my family. Look at my people.

1154
01:08:17,092 --> 01:08:18,957
- Jack! - Look at my people! It's beautiful.

1155
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,518
This is beautiful, my family, huh?

1156
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:21,790
You're killing yourself! Stop!

1157
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,058
- You know why? - Stop!

There's really nothing in college that prepares you

1166
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:24,249
to work in the real world.

1167

<i>Tree, can you hear me?</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

1178
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:41,223
Can you hear me?
It's Emily from the nursing home.

<i>It's your mom's birthday and she expects Raymond to be here.</i>

1181
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:38,378
Look.

1182
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:40,178
I know what you want,

1183
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:42,655
but I just don't think that there's anything more to talk about, okay?

1184
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:44,282
Because you won't...

1185
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:50,322
You.

1186
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,824

Is this for me?

1190
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,665
It's a Beatles record.

1191
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:30,064
<i>It's the White Album.</i>

1192
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,170
It's an original first press!

1193
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,904
Is this really for me to keep?

1194
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:39,838
Yes.

1195
01:13:42,784 --> 01:13:43,842
Thank you.

1196
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:45,980

You actually read it?

01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:07,364
Brilliant.

1200
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,270
Brilliant? Really?

1201
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:15,407
Wow.

Yeah.

1208

I'm gonna take care of that for you right away, Mr. McCall.

1209

I'll gas it, too.

1210
01:14:48,216 --> 01:14:50,343
Who's responsible for this?

1211
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,888
You are going to love that, I guarantee it.

1212
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,321
Yeah? Take a taste.

1213
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:08,427
I want to ride the roller coaster.

1214
01:15:08,503 --> 01:15:09,527
I want to ride the Ferris wheel.

1215
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:10,594
I want to ride the roller coaster.

1216
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:11,661
I want to ride the Ferris wheel.

1217
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,729
- Roller coaster. - Ferris wheel.

1218
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:13,797
- Roller coaster. - Ferris wheel.

1219
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:15,934
- Roller coaster. - Ferris wheel.

1220
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:25,482
It's sunny, but it's windy. Should we go?

1221
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,044
You can wear my sweater.

1222
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:29,682
Is that why you wore a sweater under your jacket?

1223
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:31,487
You knew I would say that.

1224
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:37,759
After 42 years, you're still trying to get me alone on the beach.

1225
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,198
Maybe. Maybe.

1226
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:16,066
Raymond, is that you?

1227
01:16:17,305 --> 01:16:19,170
Raymond, is that you?

1228
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:21,498
Yes.

1229
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:27,004
Raymond, you finally came.

1230
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:29,942
Sit!

1231
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,814
Tell me, tell me, what you been doing?

1232
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,551
It's my birthday.

1233
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,253
You want some birthday cake?

1234
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:42,722
What?

1235
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:45,462
You can't talk. Your throat.

1236
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:48,594
Rest then, Raymond. I have so much to tell you.

1237
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:51,135
Do you like my room?

1238
01:16:51,339 --> 01:16:53,273
It's so nice.

1239
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,337
I've got all my things here.

1240
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,137
But sometimes,

1241
01:17:01,616 --> 01:17:03,243
I get Ionely.

1242
01:17:03,985 --> 01:17:06,078
Raymond, I get so...

1243
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:13,386
But then, I can always count on Jack. Jack always comes.

1244
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:20,231
And he brings me flowers, helps me, and when we go for walks,

1245
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:24,295
all the ladies are jealous because he's so handsome.

1246
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:28,665
I'm just so proud of him, Raymond.

1247
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:33,211
See, you missed Jack grow into the greatest man.

1248
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:36,182
I mean, he's amazing. He can do anything.

1249
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,879
I mean, Jack's my only reason to live.

1250
01:17:41,389 --> 01:17:43,755
But he's so angry.

1251
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,791
Mad at you, mad at himself.

1252
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:52,266
Now, I think he believes you left because of him.

1253
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:58,398
He was just a kid, but he carries that anger every day.

1254
01:17:58,473 --> 01:17:59,997
I wish he'd let it go.

1255
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:04,304
He'd be much happier if he'd let it all go.

1256
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:08,810
Raymond,

1257
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:13,687
you need to tell Jack

1258
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:16,855
how much you love him.

1259
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:19,386
We're family.

1260
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,059
Life's

1261
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:27,190
not won'th living without family.

1262
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:29,626
Right?

1263
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:34,268
Right?

1264
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:44,951
Isn't someone going to sing to me?

1265
01:18:49,457 --> 01:18:51,789
I like cake, don't you, Jack?

1266
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:05,370
Bye, Ma. I love you.

1267
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:03,626
Hi, Dad.

1268
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,899
- Jack? - Yeah.

1269
01:20:08,169 --> 01:20:10,228
<i>I'm not Dad. I'm you.</i>

1270
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,136
- I'm Jack, too, you know. - Are not.

1271
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,697
- Am, too! - Are not.

1272
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:17,239
I missed you, Dad. Where have you been?

1273
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,473
You left and then I saw you a few times,

1274
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:21,842
but then it was a long time.

1275
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,377
And then you died.

1276
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,250
<i>I'm so sorry, Jack.</i>

1277
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:29,552
<i>I guess you never know if the last time you see someone</i>

1278
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:33,559
is going to be the last time you ever see someone.

1279
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:36,824
<i>I wish there was a way I could make it up to you.</i>

1280
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:37,887
<i>There is.</i>

1281
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:41,125
- How? - Chase me. Come on!

1282
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:06,218
I forgive you.

1283
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,753
<i>Jack? Jack?</i>

1284
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:13,626
You're not going to believe this!

1285
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:26,264
<i>Jack, the tree, it came back to life and it's incredible! You can talk.</i>

1286
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:37,248
You've written a beautiful book, Jack. I'm so proud of you.

1287
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:41,345
You're hugging me again, Jack. We spoke about this.

1288
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:44,722
That's why I'm alive! This is the real me!
That was a fake me that died.

1289
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,622
I just love you so much. Come here.

1290
01:22:48,696 --> 01:22:50,357
- Hello! - Hello.

1291
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,558
Friends.

1292
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:56,499
<i>Namaste.</i>

1293
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:57,731
Welcome to my office,

1294
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:01,435
the outer manifestation of my inner being.

1295
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,073
You're both inside me.

1296
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:11,841
What a beautiful book. What a gift

1297
01:23:11,986 --> 01:23:15,478
to hold, to read, to sell.

1298
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:21,288
- Hey, Aaron. - Yes.

1299
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,229
No chanting.

1300
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:26,564
Of course. Forgive me, wise ones.

1301
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:30,303
All right, we got three offers here, three big offers.

1302
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:35,870
Hey!

1303
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:37,070
Any of these three would be fine.

1304
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:40,114
No, no, no, ain't no need to rush, homey, we got all the leverage here.

1305
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,583
All right, what we have is an opportunity

1306
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,709
to pit all three of these suckas against each other

1307
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:46,219
and just grind 'em into the dirt.

1308
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:50,355
Just take 'em for every last penny they got, you know, and...

1309
01:23:52,026 --> 01:23:55,189
In an entirely spiritual way, of course.

1310
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:57,655
You know what, Aaron? You're the big agent now.

1311
01:23:57,732 --> 01:23:59,825
You got your name on the door. Why don't you pick, huh?

1312
01:24:02,036 --> 01:24:03,936
May I interest you in a slice of pie?

1313
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:06,530
I'd love to, but I really have someplace important I need to be right now.

1314
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,599
What? More important than pie?

1315
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:11,372
Actually, yes. But give me another hug.

1316
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:14,111
I love you!

1317
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:19,514
That's right. I'm the big agent now. That's my name on the door.

1318
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:25,623
Steven!

1319
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:30,391
Why is there a wasabi pea in my Asian trail mix?

1320
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:34,435
I am so sorry, Mr. Wiseberger. I thought I got them all.

1321
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:36,936
Well, here's one.

1322
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:38,438
There's a delivery for you.

1323
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:40,098
Well, bring it in.

1324
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:48,577
Oh, shit.

1325
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:51,482
Hold still, let me get this open for you.

1326
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:52,952
Jack, I don't like surprises. You know I don't.

1327
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:54,010
You're gonna like this one.

1328
01:24:54,088 --> 01:24:56,079
You know what happened the last time I tried to do a surprise...

1329
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:57,351
- You're gonna like this one. - What is going on?

1330
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:58,414
- I'm putting the baby down. - Okay.

1331
01:24:58,493 --> 01:24:59,926
Okay, all right, okay.

1332
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:02,360
- Can we please take it off?
- Okay, now, I'll take the blindfold off.

1333
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:05,422
- Yes, please, take it off. - Take it off. Okay.

1334
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:14,433
Jack, this is the house I've been trying to get you to come see.

1335
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:16,477
You have to see the inside.

1336
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:18,409
I've already seen the inside.

1337
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:20,640
What do you... Why?

1338
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:22,342
Are you thinking about making an offer?

1339
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:23,509
Oh, no, I can't.

1340
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:26,076
- Why not?
- I already own it.

1341
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:37,153
Wow.

1342
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:40,632
This is a step in the right direction.

1343
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:41,691
Yes.

1344
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:45,132
But you can't just do this one thing, Jack,

1345
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:47,140
and think that everything is gonna be hunky-dory.

1346
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:49,176
- That's not how it works. - I hear you.

1347
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:50,438
You do?

1348
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:52,941
You hear that?

1349
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,174
What?

1350
01:25:55,683 --> 01:25:57,082
The silence.

1351
01:25:57,986 --> 01:25:59,351
It's quiet.

1352
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:01,652
I like it.

1353
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:05,124
Who are you?

1354
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:10,692
Honey, the tree.

1355
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:12,062
- How did...
- Oh, yeah.

1356
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:15,261
I had Gaudencio carefully dig it up and next thing you know...

1357
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:16,769
Boom, it's a tree there.

1358
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:17,862
Boom, it's a tree there.

1359
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:19,338
- Boom.
- Boom.

1360
01:26:23,911 --> 01:26:25,640
Boom, boom, boom.

1361
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,411
- Did he say, "Boom"?
- Yes.

1362
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:29,006
- Boom.
- Oh, shoot!
