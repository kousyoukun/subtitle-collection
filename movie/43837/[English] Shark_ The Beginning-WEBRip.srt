Hey, mom!

Where are you?

22
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,910

Are you driving after

Gosh, I'm not crazy!

26

I didn't have a single drop.

You'll be in

Don't hit me!

32
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,150
Don't say that!

33
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,050

Jung Do-hyun, currently in prison

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,190
2 years later
for killing three armed robbers

61
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,870
who attacked his mother and sister

62
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,640
filed an appeal
to the Supreme Court.

The youngest world champion
Jung Do-hyun's incident occurred

on the day he defended
his champion title with a KO win...

65
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,350
Keep it down!

66
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,840
Shut up.

67
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,270
I'm watching something.

68
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,910
You all want to get beat up?

69
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,040
Wow, unbelievable.

70
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,600
Do you enjoy studying?

71
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,260
I have to go to college.

72
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,080
Gosh, my head hurts!

73
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,540
You came
the earliest as usual?

74
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,710
People who live further away
are always the earliest.

75
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,100
I have to catch my bus,
or else I'd be late.

76
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,800
I guess one of us
is going to college.

77
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,020
But you're good at English.

78
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,800
Hang in there for a year.

79
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,520
It's too late for me.

80
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,450
Might as well be
a YouTuber.

81
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,070
God, I hate math!

82
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,190
Wind velocity?

83
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,100
What's that?

84
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,700
I'm not a weather forecaster!

85
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,590
Be quiet, guys!

86
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,350
We have a new student.

87
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,480
His name is Bae Seok-chan.

88
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,110
He's a boxer
from a technical school.

89
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,250
You won the nationals
last year, right?

90
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:48,880
Yes.

91
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,620
Let's give our champion
a round of applause!

92
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,020
He'll be taking morning classes
and head off to his boxing class

93
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,570
but he's still our classmate
so look out for him.

94
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,200
Okay!

95
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,710
Hope you guys get along.

96
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,550
Sure.

97
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,740
Nice to meet you guys!

98
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,970
Thanks for coming forward.

99
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,310
You set a good example.

100
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,060
Bear with me
just for the mornings.

101
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,190
I'm gone after lunch.

102
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,250
Stop staring.

103
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,290
Turn around!

104
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,820
You guys have to go to college.

105
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,010
Cha Woo-sol!

106
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,610
What's up?

107
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,270
I said what's up?

108
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,660
Long time no see!

109
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,520
Remember me?

110
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,830
Stop it!
Are you insane?

111
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,020
Girlfriend?

112
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,220
Too bad.

113
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,020
I beat up girls too...

114
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,420
Hey!

115
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,420
Go tell the teacher.

116
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,660
Go say you got hit.

117
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,350
Go!

118
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,230
Please stop...

119
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,580
Let go!

120
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,870
Let go of me, asshole!

121
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,520
Get down.

122
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,530
I said get down!

123
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,730
You lost your touch, huh?

124
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,340
I taught you for three years.

125
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,320
And you still don’t know
how to behave?

126
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,000
Dude!

127
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,610
Woo-sol!

128
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,250
Dude!

129
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,440
Shit!

130
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,520
Woo-sol!

131
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,240
Hey!

132
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,250
Hey!

133
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,930
What are you doing?

134
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,950
Are you going to stab me?

135
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Try it!

136
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,730
I said try it!

137
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,980
Here?

138
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,740
Here?

139
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,650
Try it.

140
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,970
Try it!

141
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,420
Wuss...

142
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,180
Blood!

143
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,830
Crazy asshole.

144
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:10,410
SHARK: THE BEGINNING

145
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,230
Although the defendant alleges
he was bullied,

146
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,880
he used a weapon with
deliberate intent

147
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,420
causing the plaintiff
extract his right eye.

148
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,040
It is not an act of self-defense.

149
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,490
It is an act of active violence
akin to murder.

150
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,500
Defendant, do you agree?

151
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,590
Yes.

152
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,660
No, Woo-sol!

153
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,050
No, no!

154
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,660
No!

155
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,750
Choi Kyung-joon?

156
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,470
Yes.

157
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,790
Check your name.

158
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,950
Lee Seung-hyun?

159
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,650
Dude!

160
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,670
Excuse me.

161
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,090
Can I sit here?

162
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,990
Change all your clothes
including your underwear.

163
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,100
They cut my hair like shit.

164
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,450
Damn it...

165
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,540
Excuse me.

166
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,680
Excuse me?

167
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,340
Me?

168
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,820
Who else?

169
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,890
How did you get here?

170
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,750
Doesn't seem like
assault with a deadly weapon.

171
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,140
Sexual assault?

172
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,460
No.

173
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,980
Attempted murder...

174
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,080
Attempted fraud?

175
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,460
Then why are you here?

176
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,720
Huh?

177
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,850
Attempted murder.

178
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,070
Oh...

179
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,170
We're not that different then.

180
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,710
I almost took someone out as well.

181
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,690
I didn't upset you on the bus, did I?

182
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,730
No, we're good.

183
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,210
That's a relief.

184
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,920
We should be friends.

185
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,680
How old are you?

186
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,630
No talking!

187
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,950
Name Ahn Hyun-min.

188
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,290
Age 17.

189
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,730
Charge...

190
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,680
What is it?

191
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,610
Rape?

192
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,000
Robbery?

193
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,800
Burglary.

194
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,770
Damn...

195
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,680
A petty offender.

196
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,380
Hey!

197
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,600
If I catch you stealing,

198
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,100
you're dead.

199
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,050
I never steal from family.

200
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,250
We're not a family.

201
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,460
- Hide anything expensive.
- Okay.

202
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,500
We have to be careful.

203
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,250
You...

204
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,300
hide anything sharp.

205
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,060
These dudes stab
people in the night

206
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,390
and mess everything up.

207
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,110
Gosh, I'm already anxious
because of this maintenance team.

208
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,590
I wasn't in charge of maintenance.

209
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,220
It was Jung Sang-hyup.

210
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,590
He's a fucking titan
from the national Judo team.

211
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,440
You okay?

212
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,710
But he's not here.

213
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,600
Han Sung-yong!

214
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,460
I thought I told you

215
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,170
never to lay hands on
my mates again.

216
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,890
Oh, man...
I should've listened.

217
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,200
Wait, are you the warden?

218
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,940
Stop moving your bullying ass
and keep your head down.

219
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,460
Don't lay hands on their money.

220
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,520
What do you mean?

221
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,170
It's called sharing.

222
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,010
You two are a thing now?

223
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,160
Just a strategic alliance,

224
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,670
you blockhead.

225
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,770
Strategic alliance?

226
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,760
If you're sent to solitary this time,

227
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,190
it'll be for a hell of a while, right?

228
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,480
Yeah, well.

229
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,780
Let's go together.

230
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,240
Sung-yong! Are you okay?

231
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,180
Shit!
He's bleeding!

232
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,700
What did he ever do to you?

233
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,460
He just refused to buy cigarettes!

234
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,820
Get on the ground!

235
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,070
Drop it and get down!

236
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,800
Just think of him
as the solitary guy.

237
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,300
I can't even keep counting!

238
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,200
He gets out, then goes back in.

239
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,060
Gosh!

240
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,140
By any chance...

241
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,350
do either of you think...

242
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,990
you’re strong enough to beat me?

243
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,490
For you, without a weapon.

244
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,520
Just hands.

245
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,180
No, right?

246
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,510
Then look down, bitches!

247
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,100
That's more like it.

248
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,070
Just watch where you're looking

249
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,840
and you're halfway there.

250
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,890
Here the pecking order is everything.

251
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,210
How is that determined?

252
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,910
This.

253
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,390
If you can't throw a punch,

254
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,410
just become invisible
and lay low, okay?

255
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,700
Don't draw attention.

256
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,870
So, whose eyes must you avoid?

257
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,090
Listen closely.

258
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,050
You see him?

259
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,090
The fat guy.

260
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,270
Carpentry captain,
Lee Won-joon.

261
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,540
Shit...
You see that body?

262
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,770
It's made of steel.

263
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,560
Look!

264
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,500
He's ugly as shit, right?

265
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,580
But his temper is even shittier.

266
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,510
If he's ticked off...

267
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,510
he'll go psycho on you.

268
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,290
And over there,
you see that tiny guy?

269
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,060
Bakery captain,
Han Sung-yong.

270
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,860
His height couldn't stop
him being captain.

271
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,910
Trust me when I say...

272
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,770
those who came at him
thinking he's a wimp...

273
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,690
got all their noggins smashed.

274
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,260
Those idiots can act like kings,

275
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,790
but they'd still lose to our captain.

276
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,180
So, that's that.

277
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,579
But the real top dog here...

278
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,260
The one and only.

279
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,880
You all know who, right?

280
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,470
Jung Do-hyun!

281
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,980
Let's be honest.

282
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,420
Even if the captains tried together

283
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,819
do you think they'd win?

284
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,330
Not a chance.

285
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,950
The guy you sat
next to yesterday.

286
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,870
You weren't fazed by
his world champion title.

287
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,860
You were like,
"Can I sit here?"

288
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,080
And then bam!

289
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,590
You're definitely here for
attempted murder.

290
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,230
You're acting for Hollywood?

291
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,680
Get up.

292
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,800
Fathead!

293
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,280
Stop calling my nickname,

294
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,040
you son of a bitch...

295
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,570
Send us two people.

296
00:17:59,030 --> 00:17:59,820
Dude!

297
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,060
You want to become
Bruce Lee or what?

298
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,270
There's no kicking in soccer!

299
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,770
You okay?

300
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,440
Crybaby.

301
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,700
Let's take it easy
you fatass.

302
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,000
Hey, you!

303
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,870
Don't just stand there.

304
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,070
Me?

305
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,680
Come here!

306
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,630
Oh, why...

307
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,690
That mop head is mine.

308
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,520
Block him!

309
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,570
Nice!

310
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,650
Oh yeah!

311
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,670
Yes!

312
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,970
You can't block
that damn thing?

313
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:34,840
Lose some weight!

314
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,830
Mop head.

315
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,430
Just focus on that curly hair,
you asshole.

316
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,460
Stop running around
like a damn duck!

317
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,590
Are you going to stay still?

318
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,030
Just kick the ball.

319
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,250
Is that so fucking hard?

320
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Got it.

321
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,240
Okay!
Let's get it!

322
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,550
Pass!

323
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,850
Woo hoo!

324
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,650
Nice!

325
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,660
Come in!
Block him!

326
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,480
Kick the ball!

327
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,680
Dude.

328
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,240
Geez!

329
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,520
Kick the ball!

330
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,490
Is it... broken?

331
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,170
Should I call you Miss?

332
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,190
Go to hell!

333
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,400
Is it still there?

334
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,940
Piss off!

335
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,970
I think you're screwed.

336
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,090
This is hilarious.

337
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,370
I'm...

338
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,450
Who the fuck did this?

339
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,810
Are you okay?

340
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,080
You fucker!

341
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,060
Hey!
Let's move it.

342
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,440
Come here.

343
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,430
Hey, Sol!

344
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,520
Where do you think
you're going?

345
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,410
Son of a bitch.

346
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,930
Just do it here, Sol.

347
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,270
Don't make a sound.

348
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,430
Hold him.

349
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,640
Let's go quickly.

350
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,270
Guys!

351
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,720
Shit.

352
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,000
Save me, please.

353
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,690
Get up.

354
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,700
Hey.

355
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,190
Let's mind our own business.

356
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,480
We have to hash things out.

357
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,140
Just let him go.

358
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,130
Come on.

359
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,010
How is this your problem?

360
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,500
I said I need to talk to him.

361
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,490
Seeing how he was,

362
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,190
I don't think
it's just a talk.

363
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,300
Let's go.

364
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,320
Dude!

365
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,190
I said I need to talk to
that prick!

366
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:47,840
Damn...

367
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,020
A murderer
acting all nice and shit.

368
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,980
You want to become Superman?

369
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,980
You dipshit.

370
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,400
You beat little shits
and they call you champion?

371
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,530
Get over here.

372
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,040
Shit.

373
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,240
You piece of shit.

374
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,440
Look at that pig's eyes!

375
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,890
You're dead.

376
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,470
Why did you kick his...

377
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,090
I'd be on my knees
begging right now.

378
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,620
But even if you beg,

379
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,340
he'd still beat you, huh?

380
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,510
Good day.

381
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,500
1552.

382
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,210
Hey.

383
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,030
Good day.

384
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,310
- Visiting hours?
- Yes, sir

385
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,590
Could you tell me
who came to see me?

386
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,380
I think it's a friend of yours.

387
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,740
Go in.
You’ve got five minutes.

388
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,860
Yes, sir.

389
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,920
You look good.

390
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,660
I'm done with boxing.

391
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,920
And school.

392
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,730
What's with that face?

393
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,530
Sorry...

394
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,710
Look at me.

395
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,110
I said look at me.

396
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,520
See what you did.

397
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,250
I'm sorry, Seok-chan...

398
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,110
You should've
just killed me!

399
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,210
I'm so sorry...

400
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,480
No.

401
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,650
No, Woo-sol!

402
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,320
Don't apologize!

403
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,310
Smile.

404
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,170
Just wait.

405
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,300
When you get out...

406
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,720
I'll show you the real hell.

407
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,810
I only think of
how to make you suffer.

408
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,000
Time flies.

409
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,840
I'll see you soon.

410
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,500
Seok-chan!

411
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,910
Seok-chan, I'm sorry.

412
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,700
Seok-chan, I'm so sorry.

413
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,500
Please!

414
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,280
Please...
Just let me go.

415
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,240
I didn't start it.

416
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,830
You asked me to do it!

417
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,550
If you didn't ask me to...

418
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,250
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

419
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,890
Please forgive me.

420
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,650
I'll see you again.

421
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,700
Seok-chan...

422
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,020
Seok-chan!

423
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,880
I'm sorry.

424
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,920
Seok-chan!

425
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,880
Seok-chan, I'm sorry!

426
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,050
Please forgive me!

427
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,090
Seok-chan!
Seok-chan!

428
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,130
Seok-chan!

429
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,220
All rooms! Attention!

430
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,130
Wake! Up!

431
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,230
Shit.

432
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,620
Fathead! Attention!

433
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,100
What?
You asshole...

434
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,430
Sorry.

435
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,490
You want to die?

436
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,120
See this dumbass giggling.

437
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,710
Hold this.
Come here.

438
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,110
- Ouch!
- You son of a bitch.

439
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,900
Wait, hold on.

440
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,550
You...

441
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,120
Clean up after yourself, idiot.

442
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,160
Ouch!

443
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,520
I'll see you sometime soon.

444
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,930
We still have some things
to talk about.

445
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,330
Right?

446
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,090
Everyone, take a seat.

447
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,690
Open the windows.

448
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,520
The teacher wants
the windows open!

449
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,700
Open the windows!

450
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,330
Excuse me...

451
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,130
Thank you...

452
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,090
for yesterday.

453
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,340
You'll be okay
for a while.

454
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,090
Get going.

455
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,730
Thank you.

456
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,320
But...

457
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:24,910
Excuse...

458
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,210
He's really with Do-hyun.

459
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,030
What's he doing?

460
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,900
I don't know.

461
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,540
Leave him.

462
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:48,910
Let's go.

463
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,900
When you get out...

464
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,080
I'll show you the real hell.

465
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,530
Don't put that here.

466
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:05,860
What?

467
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,250
Are they bullying you?

468
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,260
Go if you don't have
anything to say.

469
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,830
And stop bringing that.

470
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,860
I...

471
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,730
I want to learn from you.

472
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,770
I want

473
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,270
to become strong like you.

474
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,470
What for?

475
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,100
Do you want to kill
people too?

476
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,260
Take revenge on the baldy?

477
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,050
Or bully others like them?

478
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:56,570
No.

479
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,350
I just want a normal life.

480
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,550
Go, and stop bothering me.

481
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,950
I don't have bad intentions.

482
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,150
I promise.

483
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,930
I always ran away.

484
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,200
I didn't want to get beat up,

485
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,610
nor die,

486
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,140
so I stayed low and obeyed.

487
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,960
Where did I go wrong?

488
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,720
Is it because I'm poor?

489
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,240
The fact that I'm weak?

490
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,940
Maybe it's my whole existence.

491
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,920
I've accepted that my whole life.

492
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,740
But I don't want to anymore.

493
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,140
I don't want to run anymore!

494
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,960
You can help me.

495
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,940
Coming tomorrow, too?

496
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,810
Okay, I'll teach you.

497
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,170
Really?

498
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,350
If you can beat me.

499
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,930
I take 30 minutes
so you do it in 40.

500
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,530
Then you win.

501
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,950
Do what in 40 minutes?

502
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,540
100 laps.

503
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,120
How about it?

504
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,540
You in?

505
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,310
I'll try.

506
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,530
Get ready.

507
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,940
Go!

508
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,130
31.

509
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,520
51.

510
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,830
I'm sorry.

511
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,350
Are you okay?

512
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,550
Do you have any injuries?

513
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,219
I was messing around
but I went a bit too far.

514
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,730
We're good.

515
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,730
You

516
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,120
and me...

517
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,440
We're not equals.

518
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,940
Don't make a sound.

519
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,670
I told you to be quiet.

520
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,550
Sol!

521
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,139
You idiot.

522
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,530
Did you think snitching
would change things?

523
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,540
71.

524
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,940
Give up if it's too much.

525
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,560
It's okay.

526
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,860
Hey.

527
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,720
Where do you think
you're going?

528
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,200
Damn it! He pissed!

529
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,330
Dude! He went!

530
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,990
Gosh, it’s gross.

531
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,490
The smell!

532
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,960
Unbelievable!

533
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,530
- So annoying.
- Clean it up.

534
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,940
He drank a lot.

535
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,730
Lick it.

536
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,310
Stop.

537
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,740
I said stop!

538
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:08,780
Hey!

539
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,510
Hey, hey!
Wake up.

540
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,150
Hey!

541
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,300
This crazy bastard...

542
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,570
You're okay living alone?

543
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,690
Yes.

544
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,470
Any inconveniences?

545
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,250
Things are good
thanks to your kindness.

546
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,230
Thank you.

547
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,340
Since you came here,

548
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,650
there's less trouble,
the atmosphere is better...

549
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,760
I should be thanking you.

550
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,680
The outcome of the trial is...

551
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,450
a shame.

552
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,540
If you need anything, tell me.

553
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,550
I'll help if I can.

554
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,670
Actually...

555
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,960
I wanted to ask you something.

556
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,720
Good morning.

557
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,580
1552.

558
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,530
You're moving.

559
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:58,940
Me?

560
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,550
Yeah.

561
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,330
Right now?

562
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,560
Get your things.

563
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,940
What are you?

564
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,740
Hey.

565
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,080
What is he?

566
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,050
I don't know.

567
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,450
But I know
that you're a fathead.

568
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,550
You son of a bitch.

569
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:55,910
What are you doing?

570
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,150
Come in.

571
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,190
You'll be staying here.

572
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,060
You know how to
do push-ups?

573
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,660
Yes.

574
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,730
Do as many as you can.

575
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,510
Right now?

576
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,580
Ready.

577
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,970
One moment, please.

578
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:24,780
Go!

579
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,500
This is bad.

580
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,340
Are you sick?

581
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,740
Captain.

582
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,380
That asshole moved to
Do-hyun's room.

583
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,120
Actually, he has a friend
in maintenance.

584
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,830
Yeah, the mop head.

585
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,490
Yeah, him.

586
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,870
We'll come up with a plan
to fix things up.

587
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,080
How did you run
with that body?

588
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,130
Oh...

589
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,720
21 push-ups.
32 sit-ups.

590
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,580
Zero pull-ups.

591
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,260
This is the current you, right?

592
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,210
Yes.

593
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,570
Starting today
we'll crush your limit.

594
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,190
There's nothing special.

595
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,780
You just have to do
one more than the day before.

596
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,190
Okay.

597
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,360
So!

598
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,780
Start right now.

599
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,570
Right now?

600
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,480
Can I take a short break?

601
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,470
Are you complaining?

602
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,080
You're tired?

603
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,160
Then you should rest.

604
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,450
Go back to your place
and rest there.

605
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,380
- I'll get the guard.
- No...

606
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,190
I'll try.

607
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,370
Don't "try."

608
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,780
Do it.

609
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,010
Okay.

610
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,910
You should be hanging
as if this were a cliff.

611
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,550
Are you sure you're desperate?

612
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,240
Don't pull with just your arms.

613
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,800
Open up your chest,
squeeze your shoulder

614
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,580
and pull with your back.

615
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,690
More! More!
Bring it up!

616
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,170
Up!

617
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,980
One!

618
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,910
See, you did it.

619
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,370
31.

620
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:23,960
One.

621
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,760
One, two.

622
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,580
Gosh…

623
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,850
From the beginning.

624
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,370
Go down more.

625
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,130
Focus on your chest!

626
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,350
Hey! Together.

627
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,980
Together, together, together.

628
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,580
Eating is training, too.

629
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,610
You have to be
bigger and heavier.

630
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,560
Enjoy.

631
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,550
Don't kick
with the top of your foot.

632
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:55,590
Seven.

633
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,490
Do it slowly
or you'll get hurt.

634
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,480
Seven.

635
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:03,760
Eight!

636
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:04,960
Pull all the way.

637
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,790
Open up your chest.

638
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,250
Don't stop the kick.

639
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,560
Squeeze it out!

640
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,250
Run!

641
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,770
Okay! More!

642
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:33,340
Tuck your chin.

643
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:33,970
Your chin!

644
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,450
You do it.

645
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:41,800
What!

646
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,750
Hold it!

647
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:48,730
You're okay.

648
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,660
One more.

649
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,740
Get up, okay!

650
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,320
Yes!

651
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,970
Okay!

652
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,140
What are you doing?

653
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,750
Tie it up.

654
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,590
He's good...

655
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,280
1000!

656
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,780
You did 1000?

657
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,750
Yes.

658
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,810
I missed it.

659
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,180
From what number?

660
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,180
Uh...

661
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,770
Just start over.

662
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:29,370
Right now?

663
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,170
Okay, I will.

664
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:35,080
What is he doing?

665
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,310
What the hell?

666
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,550
Move over!

667
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,140
Get out of the way!

668
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,130
You piece of shit!
Are you blind?

669
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,070
Can’t see us driving here?

670
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,310
- Don't tell them off.
- Yes, sir!

671
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:08,130
- I like the design.
- Yes, sir!

672
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,700
We will try our best!

673
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,320
See you.

674
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,720
Sir!
We will do our best!

675
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,920
People need a good beating.

676
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,670
The world's become too easy.

677
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:20,040
That bastard made us late.

678
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,790
We're going to get in so much...

679
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:26,990
What the hell!

680
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,960
I'll kill that bitch.

681
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,180
You're good.

682
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:52,580
I like you.

683
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:54,560
Are you a boxer?

684
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:57,380
- Sir, this isn't...
- Shut your mouth.

685
00:47:58,860 --> 00:47:59,700
We'll talk later.

686
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,160
Go to hell.

687
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,960
What are you, gangsters?

688
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,130
Yup.

689
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,200
How about working for me?

690
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,360
Then how about this?

691
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,600
You're blind in your
right eye, yeah?

692
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,370
I was right.

693
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,830
On three, I'm going to
strike your left cheek.

694
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,580
If you can block or dodge,

695
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,750
I'll let you go.

696
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,650
Sounds good?

697
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:43,900
One.

698
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,070
Screw you.

699
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:46,400
Two.

700
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,380
Three.

701
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,970
One measly eyeball?

702
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:00,350
That's nothing.

703
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,940
You'll be stronger
if you learn from me.

704
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,050
Come work for me.

705
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,380
What's that?

706
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:44,050
Long time.

707
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,470
Why are you working out
so much?

708
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,580
Is it because of Won-joon?

709
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,380
No.

710
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,210
I wanted to become stronger

711
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,530
because I was so weak.

712
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,730
And turns out it's fun.

713
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,020
You'll be training today, too?

714
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,270
Probably, why?

715
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:09,410
No reason.

716
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,180
You'll be returning to
maintenance anyway.

717
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,420
Wouldn't it be good
to make some friends?

718
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,370
Do-hyun is leaving soon, anyways.

719
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:20,220
Leaving?

720
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:21,990
He's getting out?

721
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,390
You didn't know?

722
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,700
He's getting transferred to
an adult prison.

723
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,340
You want to
play hooky today?

724
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,240
Huh?

725
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,020
Yeah, next time.

726
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,960
Let's do it next time.

727
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:42,610
Sure.

728
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,170
Keep it up.

729
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,330
Relax your shoulder.

730
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,020
Guard up!

731
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,060
Turn your leg.

732
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,260
And your waist!

733
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:57,020
Left hook.

734
00:50:58,610 --> 00:50:59,770
It's over-rotated.

735
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,550
Don't go all the way.

736
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,040
Waist straighter.

737
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,500
Bring your legs closer.

738
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:07,990
Sidekick.

739
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,200
What was that?

740
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,660
I told you not to blink.

741
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,800
Are you messing around?

742
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,020
I'm sorry.

743
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,730
What's up with you?

744
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,990
Your focus is off.

745
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:28,210
Why?

746
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,560
Did the teacher
say something?

747
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,170
No.

748
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:35,540
I talked with a friend today.

749
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,450
You have a friend?

750
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:40,020
Yes, one.

751
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,710
You have a lot of
friends outside, right?

752
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,090
See this guy...

753
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,190
trying to chat with me
during practice.

754
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,640
I don't have many friends.

755
00:51:58,650 --> 00:51:59,470
Hmm?

756
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,370
How come?

757
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:03,330
I didn't have time.

758
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:04,650
I had to work out.

759
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,570
Do-hyun.

760
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:13,240
Are you leaving?

761
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,210
To an adult prison?

762
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,670
How did you know?

763
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,140
I heard it from my friend.

764
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,410
Why did he tell you that?

765
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:32,150
Did you think
I'd take care of you forever?

766
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,100
No.

767
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:39,050
Then don't waste your time.

768
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:42,170
Even sleeping is a luxury.

769
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,060
Aren't you going to train?

770
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:55,550
I am.

771
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,960
Come on.

772
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,010
Punk.

773
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:07,910
Hold on a sec.

774
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:08,700
Follow me.

775
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,410
Okay.

776
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,790
Dude.

777
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:18,600
You punk.

778
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,300
You keep saying
you'll bring him.

779
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,260
All bark and no bite
or crunch or munch.

780
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,010
Dude!

781
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,350
I leave tomorrow.

782
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:28,360
I swear I asked him
like 70 times,

783
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,730
but he said no.

784
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,720
Shit!

785
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,280
We don't need to
feel him out!

786
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,980
Just ask him to help you!

787
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:36,590
Hey.

788
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:37,290
Hey.

789
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,160
"The carpentry kids
are bullying me."

790
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:41,140
"Don't make things big
by asking Do-hyun,"

791
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,980
"so come alone and help me."

792
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,410
Is that so damn hard?

793
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,790
I told you we're not that close.

794
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,520
If I ask him for help,

795
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,430
why would he come,
you damn idiots?

796
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:54,180
What? What did you say?

797
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:56,990
Why did... I say that?

798
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,600
Yeah, why?
You bastard.

799
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,850
Say it again.

800
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,700
What?

801
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,360
This crazy-ass prick.

802
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,410
You little...

803
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,920
Don't cuss.

804
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,380
Don't cuss
you son of a bitch.

805
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,210
You damn…

806
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:08,880
You okay?

807
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,100
Hey.

808
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,510
You did bring him!

809
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:12,610
You should've told us.

810
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:13,780
Good job.

811
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,410
You idiot!
Why did you come?

812
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:17,620
To get his ass beat
you shithole.

813
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:19,550
I'm taking Hyun-min.

814
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:22,210
Eyes down.

815
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,400
Eyes down!

816
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,200
I said eyes down
you piece of shit!

817
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:37,790
Let's go.

818
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:38,850
Shit...

819
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,150
Hold on.

820
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,240
Hey.

821
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,000
Crazy asshole!

822
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:05,810
You!

823
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:07,590
Bring him
no matter what.

824
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,510
If you don't, you'll die.

825
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,420
Yes, sir.

826
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,400
Dipshits...

827
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:13,610
We're sorry.

828
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,190
Excuse me.

829
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,410
Damn.

830
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,190
Excuse me!

831
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:34,600
It's just that...

832
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,690
we wanted to have a
quick chat with him.

833
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,850
What do you have to
talk about?

834
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,010
Oh...!

835
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:44,330
Hey!

836
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,480
You tell him.

837
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:55,770
I'll be back.

838
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:02,340
Go on.

839
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,190
We won't be long.
Thank you.

840
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,180
Thank you.

841
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,110
The prick's here.

842
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,060
Get up!

843
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,020
Geez, you want to become
Punch-man or what?

844
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,060
You're a total thug.

845
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,990
He's getting out tomorrow
but you ruined his poor face.

846
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,810
I apologize

847
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:59,790
for punching him.

848
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,660
What!

849
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:02,630
Just for that?

850
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:08,020
Those people were
hitting my friend first.

851
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:11,180
I did that just
to stop them.

852
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:14,050
I'm truly sorry about that.

853
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,350
Oh man...

854
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:18,060
I'm sorry for hitting you too.

855
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:20,540
What to do?

856
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:22,880
I'll apologize for
a lot today.

857
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:34,010
Shit.

858
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:03,980
That damn squirrel...

859
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:20,810
You piece of shit!

860
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,870
You bastard!

861
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,020
What the hell
are you looking at?

862
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,990
You piece of shit.
You're dead.

863
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:28,400
You idiot.

864
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:38,320
Go down!

865
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,240
Geez!

866
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,480
Just lie down!

867
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:28,940
Do-hyun.

868
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,220
Fuck.

869
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,240
This is damn tiring.

870
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,450
Hey, give me your hand.

871
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,150
Be careful, sir.

872
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:59,190
He's a senior.

873
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:01,880
You could've treated him better.

874
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:17,970
Whoa.

875
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:21,320
Wow!

876
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,810
Is it some special day?

877
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,250
There's more food than...

878
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,820
Look at all this meat!

879
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,060
This looks so good.

880
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:33,420
Aren't you having any?

881
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,690
I'll have everything
if you aren't.

882
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:39,220
Hey.

883
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,260
Are you the only one here?

884
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,690
See this guy,

885
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,340
trying to hog all the food

886
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:47,430
without asking me first.

887
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,090
Focus.

888
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:32,620
Get that guard up.

889
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,220
I told you to focus.

890
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:45,690
What the hell is this!

891
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:50,220
Again.

892
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,410
You're too nice, man.

893
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:18,630
Let's call it a day.

894
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:20,860
Sorry.

895
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,830
Then do it properly!

896
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,960
I told you to stay focused
until the end.

897
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,790
You can't be weak now.

898
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:29,720
You're right.

899
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:32,900
You'll get knocked out
the moment you're off guard.

900
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:35,680
Okay.

901
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:43,750
You upset?

902
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,220
No.

903
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:47,910
You are.

904
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:50,580
I'm not...

905
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,990
I can't teach you
if you're so sensitive.

906
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:55,530
Never mind!

907
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:56,450
It's over, we're done.

908
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,910
I swear I'm not upset at all.

909
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:04,810
I better just go.

910
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:08,300
I'm off.

911
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,590
Good luck.

912
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:12,190
For real...

913
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:14,140
I'm not upset at all.

914
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:20,020
I'm for real, too.

915
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:22,400
Class finished.

916
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:34,590
Do-hyun.

917
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:38,630
You did much better
than I expected.

918
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,670
Training is hard
even for athletes.

919
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,660
But you endured it.

920
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:48,440
That's your talent.

921
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,460
Your persistence.

922
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:56,130
At one point, you'll want to
give up and rest.

923
01:07:58,110 --> 01:07:59,260
That's the key moment.

924
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,570
It's time, let's go.

925
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:20,630
Just one minute, please.

926
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:29,040
You know sharks?

927
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,330
Sharks?

928
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:35,160
They don't have swim bladders

929
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,649
so if they stop swimming,
they sink and die.

930
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,760
That's why they keep moving.

931
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:47,490
You are the same.

932
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:50,760
Okay, Do-hyun.

933
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,100
Don’t ever stop.

934
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,760
No, really...
It's true!

935
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:59,440
Our captain was huge like you.

936
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,650
What I'm saying is...

937
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,690
you don't want to go up
against him

938
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:04,490
unless you want to break a bone!

939
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:05,960
But this Cha Woo-sol...

940
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,760
That's his name.

941
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,090
What's up with that name?

942
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:10,020
Anyway!

943
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,580
After training with
Jung Do-hyun,

944
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:15,080
Woo-sol is weaving around,
striking the noggin...

945
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:15,750
like bam!

946
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,450
He won!

947
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:19,230
Don't we have to recruit him, then?

948
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,180
For real...

949
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:22,660
Shh...

950
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,680
Sorry.

951
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:26,850
Sung-joon.

952
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:27,820
Yes?

953
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,370
Tell me again.

954
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,390
Quietly.

955
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:34,250
Tell you what?

956
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:35,660
Cha Woo-sol.

957
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:39,430
Make way,
you bastards.

958
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:41,460
There's people
who want to pass through!

959
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:44,430
Swarming like a pack of dogs...

960
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:49,830
Why didn't you just
stay in solitary forever?

961
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,500
So, you got crushed
by the newbie?

962
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:56,660
Everyone in solitary
knows about it.

963
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,770
You don't know yet?

964
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,920
Oh, you wouldn't know
because it's today's news.

965
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:07,740
That newbie...

966
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,550
is going to your room.

967
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:12,800
Good luck.

968
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:15,070
The wacko gets off
on fighting.

969
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,800
You fathead.

970
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,040
Run, you idiots!

971
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,660
Run, run, run!

972
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,380
Get rid of the guard.

973
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:42,970
Hey.

974
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:45,260
Water deer.

975
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:48,310
Sir!

976
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:49,050
We're in big trouble.

977
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,220
We need you now!

978
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:52,620
There's a crazy water deer
in the warehouse.

979
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,820
What is it doing in there?

980
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:54,390
We don't know.

981
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:55,330
You'd better go quickly.

982
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:56,930
It's eating all our snacks.

983
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,500
There's flour all over the place.

984
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,410
Flour...

985
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:01,890
Stand by the wall.

986
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:02,660
Okay.

987
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:04,840
Stay right there.

988
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,480
Where?

989
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:06,490
The warehouse.

990
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,250
Let's fight.

991
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:23,920
Not interested.

992
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,280
I am.

993
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:29,150
And that's what matters.

994
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:34,250
If you win,
I'll do anything you say.

995
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:36,680
Really?

996
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:38,760
Don't you believe me?

997
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:41,810
Everyone heard it.

998
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,480
Then if I win...

999
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,150
don't bully others
from now on.

1000
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:56,930
Don't steal their money

1001
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:58,520
and don't hit people for fun.

1002
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:01,840
Don't live like that.

1003
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:07,440
Behind the warehouse
five days from now.

1004
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:08,860
Today's fine, too.

1005
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,470
Take the offer while it lasts.

1006
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,290
I said I don't mind.

1007
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,740
I said I do.

1008
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:33,820
Strike while the iron is hot.

1009
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:42,360
Dude!

1010
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:44,610
Make it clean!

1011
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,580
You know how the captain is!

1012
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:49,150
Does he even know
what I'm like?

1013
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:50,170
He doesn't!

1014
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:51,620
Come on!

1015
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:54,910
It's clean enough.

1016
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:56,130
Is it his forever home?

1017
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:57,870
No! He's going to get out.

1018
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:04,860
Good morning!

1019
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:21,580
Who is the guy
Won-joon was talking about?

1020
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:23,220
Cha Woo-sol.

1021
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,570
Do-hyun trained him...

1022
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:25,760
Whoa!
Don't step on this!

1023
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:27,150
Hey!

1024
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:27,830
Rag.

1025
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,030
Get me a rag!

1026
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,040
Captain...

1027
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:32,830
Toothpaste?
It's toothpaste.

1028
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:34,700
Please...

1029
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,160
So...

1030
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,270
When is the newbie coming?

1031
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,890
Oh, he's coming now

1032
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,070
from Do-hyun's room.

1033
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:12,600
Hyun-min!

1034
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,720
I'm Jung Sang-hyup,
the maintenance captain.

1035
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:20,820
Do you...

1036
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,690
want to take my place?

1037
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:31,470
No.

1038
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:33,730
I'm not interested in it.

1039
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:45,900
Then...

1040
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:50,880
why do they call you
a "fight-obssessed punk"?

1041
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:51,100
Is Woo-sol coming or what?

1042
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:53,480
Huh?

1043
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:54,190
Hey.

1044
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,090
He's here!

1045
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,370
It's that damn fathead.

1046
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:01,100
What?

1047
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:02,770
Waiting for your mom?

1048
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,110
Cry, why don't you?

1049
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:07,970
I couldn't find him.

1050
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,040
Sol!

1051
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,940
Do you enjoy hitting people?

1052
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:48,800
It's fun, yeah?

1053
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,180
No.

1054
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:54,890
Why don't you tell me...

1055
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:56,140
how you won?

1056
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,100
Hmm?

1057
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,040
You still haven't changed?

1058
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,590
I can tell you in detail.

1059
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:13,040
At that time...

1060
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,430
This guy was like

1061
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:16,980
weaving, and then
he threw a hook...

1062
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,560
Are you working out to fight me?

1063
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,130
Damn...

1064
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:30,640
I’m so damn excited.

1065
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:34,340
Don't forget...

1066
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:36,940
who you are.

1067
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:46,540
What is this?

1068
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,720
Isn't he in your team?

1069
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,860
He doesn't give a shit
about his captain.

1070
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,100
Let's stop fighting.

1071
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,410
That guy...

1072
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:04,200
Do you want to become
Gandhi or what?

1073
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:06,340
So damn peaceful...

1074
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:08,810
What do we get
from fighting?

1075
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:10,540
Punishment

1076
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,510
and injuries. That's it.

1077
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:15,370
Never mind us,
but what about them?

1078
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,180
What about you guys?

1079
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,790
Tiptoeing around,
getting nicked.

1080
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:24,540
Even if everyone
calls us trash.

1081
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,300
Well,

1082
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,910
even if we were trash,

1083
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:30,730
we can't continue
living like trash.

1084
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:32,490
Do you want a wish?

1085
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,570
I'll give you one
if you beat me.

1086
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:39,070
When have I ever lost
to either of you fools?

1087
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:42,030
What?

1088
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:45,730
Look at me.

1089
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,540
I said look at me.

1090
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:50,920
Are you blind?

1091
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:52,500
I am looking.

1092
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:54,700
And so what if I'm not.

1093
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:56,270
No fighting my ass.

1094
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:57,490
Load of bullshit.

1095
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:01,140
He's here.

1096
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,960
Will you keep your promise?

1097
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:29,150
If you win, of course.

1098
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,670
Is that all you've got?

1099
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:01,770
Damn...

1100
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:03,690
Try getting up.

1101
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:27,000
That's the Woo-sol I know.

1102
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,490
Let go!

1103
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:16,030
Let go!

1104
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:27,030
What do we do!

1105
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,510
Keep your promise.

1106
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:34,230
Screw you.

1107
01:24:34,230 --> 01:24:35,910
Keep your promise.

1108
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:38,290
Screw you!

1109
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,800
Stop it, Woo-sol!

1110
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,030
You're going to kill him!

1111
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:47,690
Keep your promise.

1112
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,090
Keep your promise!

1113
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,300
Okay.

1114
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:53,780
What is this!

1115
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:54,620
Everyone down!

1116
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:01,180
We've got an emergency situation.

1117
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,210
- Hands on your head!
- We need backup now.

1118
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:05,000
We've got an emergency situation.

1119
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:05,950
Don't move.

1120
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:08,970
You move...

1121
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:11,230
and you'll be found in
non-compliance.

1122
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:12,310
Got it?

1123
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:14,170
Lee Won-joon!
Jung Sang-hyup!

1124
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:17,160
What the hell are you doing
with these kids!

1125
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:57,580
1552.

1126
01:25:58,390 --> 01:25:59,680
You're going back.

1127
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:05,030
Hey, you!
Come here!

1128
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,450
Am I the errand boy?

1129
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:08,030
Stop asking me for things.

1130
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,300
I spotted you
a cigarette last time!

1131
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,340
I quit smoking.

1132
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:13,010
Geez...

1133
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:15,260
Fathead!

1134
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:16,590
Where's your captain?

1135
01:26:16,590 --> 01:26:18,280
How would I know?

1136
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,330
He's here.

1137
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:20,070
Oooh!

1138
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,400
Captain.

1139
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:23,150
You're here.

1140
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:24,970
Are we shooting a movie?

1141
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:26,470
Why do we meet outside?

1142
01:26:27,370 --> 01:26:31,070
My life isn't fun anymore
because of you guys.

1143
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:32,150
I'm so bored.

1144
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:33,870
Oy, little one.

1145
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,870
Want to go again?
With a wish.

1146
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,240
Seong-yong Han.

1147
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,430
Gosh, this dude
always telling us to stop.

1148
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:41,770
Us four.

1149
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:43,970
No more fighting
until we get out.

1150
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,320
You're giving us orders now?

1151
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,520
This isn't an order.
It's a request.

1152
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:51,110
We should be over
this stupidity.

1153
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:54,940
Let's form a peace pact.

1154
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:00,110
That's some bullcrap.

1155
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:02,370
I won.

1156
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,550
What if we say no?

1157
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:06,860
Then...

1158
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:10,710
the request would
become an order.

1159
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,650
Can't you see
things have changed?

1160
01:27:13,990 --> 01:27:17,650
You can't compare to us
maintenance anymore.

1161
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:23,520
Please accept our request.

1162
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:28,530
What's wrong with them?

1163
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:30,060
Are they putting on a show?

1164
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:32,440
Okay.

1165
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,130
You won anyway.

1166
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,680
I won't fight anymore.
Happy?

1167
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,520
Fatty's going to listen to me.

1168
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:41,950
This guy will be listening to me!

1169
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:44,130
You, no more fighting!

1170
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,190
No figthing.

1171
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,880
So everyone's agreed.

1172
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:50,240
Excuse me.

1173
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:52,080
Sit down, Woo-sol.

1174
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:55,220
I would like us to
be more constructive.

1175
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:56,850
As you guys know,
our prison

1176
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:57,940
is too dirty.

1177
01:27:57,950 --> 01:27:59,250
- Jong-tae!
- Yes.

1178
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:00,680
You come sit here, too.

1179
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,360
- You're really doing that?
- Yup.

1180
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:05,310
We should divide up the chores.

1181
01:28:05,310 --> 01:28:06,470
We should be tidy.

1182
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:08,350
You want to become Terminix?

1183
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:09,480
Enough is enough, man.

1184
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:27,150
Sorry.

1185
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:28,380
Huh?

1186
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:31,010
Just... about everything.

1187
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:33,810
All of a sudden?

1188
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:37,200
I knew the first time I saw you.

1189
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:39,850
You're something else.

1190
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:42,330
I'm not.

1191
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:43,230
You are!

1192
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:44,660
You're really something.

1193
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:47,400
It seems obvious
you'll lose,

1194
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:49,950
but you never give up.

1195
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:51,710
I can't do that.

1196
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,900
I'd rather get beat up.

1197
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:56,310
You're awesome.

1198
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:01,070
Hey!

1199
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:03,410
Don't go looking for trouble.

1200
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:05,270
Shit could happen.

1201
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:07,660
Okay.

1202
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,770
And...

1203
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:09,990
I'm getting out next week.

1204
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:11,690
Already?

1205
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:13,790
- Oh.
- Where are you going?

1206
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,180
Good luck, guys.

1207
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,070
Bye.

1208
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:24,060
Move over.

1209
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,560
Focus on your
waist, pelvis, ankle...

1210
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,220
power, speed, and target.

1211
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:34,910
Damn it.

1212
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:36,870
Target, my ass!

1213
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:37,560
You okay?

1214
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:38,900
You okay?

1215
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:40,660
Is this a middle kick?

1216
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:47,490
Where's the sausage?

1217
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:49,280
There's no sausage.
Ask the warden.

1218
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,040
You think we're at a buffet?

1219
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,710
The outer part is a bit
hard today.

1220
01:29:56,830 --> 01:29:58,000
I like it.

1221
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:01,240
The texture gets weirder.

1222
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:05,760
Oh?

1223
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,210
UFO!

1224
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:10,230
That's not a UFO!

1225
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:20,660
Hmm.

1226
01:30:22,810 --> 01:30:23,880
What are you doing?

1227
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:24,930
Get up and run.

1228
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:28,170
You have five laps left.

1229
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:29,380
Huh?

1230
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,850
This guy...

1231
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,430
You're overreacting.

1232
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,110
I know someone
who ran 100 laps.

1233
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:38,040
Run, run now!

1234
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:56,090
Good job.

1235
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:27,480
Sir.

1236
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:31,090
Can I please go
and take a last look?

1237
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:39,360
I said stop!

1238
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:40,550
Hey!

1239
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:41,950
Gosh.

1240
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,530
You're not eating
enough rice these days.

1241
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:50,730
Nope.

1242
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,120
You should be eating more.

1243
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:55,920
Dig in.

1244
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:06,060
This technique has
more cons than pros.

1245
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:08,500
It's a lot for your shoulder

1246
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:10,170
and doesn't cause
much damage.

1247
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:12,420
What?

1248
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:17,240
Isn't this technique a little...
cowardly?

1249
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,180
Hey.

1250
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,700
The chance of you
beating the national champion

1251
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:23,410
is almost zero, right?

1252
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:25,970
You can't afford to
pick and choose.

1253
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:31,720
Cha Woo-sol!

1254
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:38,280
So damn great to see you.

1255
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,320
Seok-chan!

1256
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:17,270
I want to ask you something.

1257
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:20,150
I've thought about it,

1258
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,270
but I can't figure it out.

1259
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:27,080
Why did you hate me?

1260
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:31,170
What did I do to you?

1261
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,510
Woo-sol.

1262
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:42,390
I don't hate you.

1263
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:46,130
Why would I?

1264
01:34:50,210 --> 01:34:51,840
We have to see this through.

1265
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:55,000
Sure.

1266
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:34,460
Hey.

1267
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:35,530
Woo-sol.

1268
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:38,250
Is this all you got?

1269
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:55,880
Hey.

1270
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:57,940
Your mom came to me
begging her ass off.

1271
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:20,840
Hey.

1272
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,350
What did you expect?

1273
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:25,260
You thought you could beat me?

1274
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,650
Huh? Woo-sol!

1275
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:41,040
You almost fucked me up.

1276
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:35,410
Remember how I told you

1277
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:38,360
you'll want to
give up and rest?

1278
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:39,800
That's the key moment.

1279
01:37:41,050 --> 01:37:42,210
Sharks don't have swim bladders.

1280
01:37:42,210 --> 01:37:45,740
So if they stop swimming,
they sink and die.

1281
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:48,190
That's why they keep moving

1282
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:49,740
as long as they're alive.

1283
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:51,470
Don't ever stop.

1284
01:39:02,330 --> 01:39:03,960
This isn't used to
knock them down.

1285
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,360
The rotation on impact
causes bleeding.

1286
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:37,130
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

1287
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:15,040
Your existence itself...

1288
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:17,880
is a crime.

1289
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:43,440
Cha Woo-sol!

1290
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:45,320
Cha Woo-sol!

1291
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:58,400
Seok-chan.

1292
01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:03,050
I'm off.

1293
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:23,000
Do-hyun.

1294
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:24,310
Yeah?

1295
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,670
Have you seen a shark in person?

1296
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:28,030
Me?

1297
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:30,430
In person?

1298
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:34,290
How much in person?

1299
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:37,190
I have... on TV

1300
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:40,170
I wanted to see sharks for myself,

1301
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:42,520
so I went to the aquarium.

1302
01:43:43,670 --> 01:43:44,960
But they weren't...

1303
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:46,670
moving much.

1304
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:50,780
You said they move constantly

1305
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:53,690
even while asleep.

1306
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,870
But I saw them resting.

1307
01:43:59,110 --> 01:43:59,850
Really?

1308
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:02,270
Well, that's weird.

1309
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:03,790
That's not possible.

1310
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:05,380
It's true, Do-hyun!

1311
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:12,880
Hey.

1312
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:14,500
Yeah?

1313
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:17,050
They must've been dead.

1314
01:44:17,230 --> 01:44:17,940
Sorry?

1315
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:19,990
They're dead.

1316
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:27,320
Oh.

1317
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:28,810
Oh!

1318
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:34,370
That's why!
