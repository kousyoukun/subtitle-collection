11
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,475
-Huh?

12
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,302
Don't shoot me.

13
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,388
Who is that?

14
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,432
- There's your money.
- Release the hostages.

15
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,475
How much in there?

16
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,601
Three.

17
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:14,063
You're too late. We want $5 million, eh.

18
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,693
What do you know? A greedy pirate.

19
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,238
Last chance!

20
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,115
Take it or leave it.

21
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,617
We want the money now!

22
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,453
-Warning shot.
-No!

23
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,418
A little low.

24
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,591
Lights out!

25
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,916
l'll kill him! l swear l'll kill him!

26
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,383
Drop your guns!

27
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,509
Fat chance.

28
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,760
Yeah, that'll happen.

29
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,513
Last chance. Let the hostages go

30
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,974
or you're out of there.

31
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,477
Bring the money here to me.

32
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,395
l'll take the four on the left.

33
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,564
l want you to take the tzo on the right.
Leave the rest alone.

34
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,985
l'll kill them all! l don't care.

35
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,988
You should take the tzo on the right.
You're not that fast anymore.

36
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,823
The only thing faster is lightning.

37
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,493
We'll see.

38
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,663
Bullets go faster than blades.

39
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,416
Bring the money here now!

40
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,667
You want the money?

41
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,671
Go get it.

42
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,760
What's that?

43
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,178
l'm getting a text.

44
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,596
Excuse me?

45
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:11,931
Kill them!

46
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,065
-l call that a tie.
-Come on, keep dreaming.

47
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,734
These guys are arrested development.

48
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,528
A little compassion, folks.

49
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,071
You know, l don't think
you hit one of them.

50
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,156
l don't see any knives, actually.

51
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,616
How are you guys doing?

52
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,037
-What the hell is he doing?
-Hanging a pirate.

53
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,872
Don't be ridiculous.

54
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,334
Gunner! What are you doing?

55
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,419
Hanging a pirate!

56
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,673
-That is seriously demented.
-This is no good.

57
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,008
-You're on your own.
-Appreciate it.

58
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,552
lt's good to have friends.

59
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,303
-Gunner.
-Yeah?

60
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,597
This isn't how we work. Let him go.

61
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,599
Why? He'd do it to us.

62
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,351
Gunner, last chance.

63
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,311
Let him go or we're letting you go.

64
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,896
lt's good to hang pirates.

65
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,084
-We don't kill like that.
-Yeah?

66
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,961
Not polite enough?

67
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,298
-Let him go, Gunner.
-How are you doing, Barney?

68
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,757
Pretty good.

69
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,926
My partner here kicked me
with steel-tipped boots.

70
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,886
-Can you believe that?
-You deserved it.

71
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,513
l think l'll need stitches.

72
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:35,639
Maybe.

73
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,475
-l hate stitches.
-Everyone does.

74
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,519
Let him go, Gunner.

75
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,729
Let him go?

76
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,023
Let him go.

77
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,396
-Think he's cool?
-Be careful. Go.

78
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,705
Gunner, you cool?

79
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,001
Yeah.

80
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,264
No, keep it.

81
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,934
You appreciate a good blade.

82
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:16,949
He all right?

83
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,033
Yeah.

84
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,036
The life just got to him.

85
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,039
lt'll get to all of us.

86
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,741
Coming!

87
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,204
Who is it?

88
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,875
Someday you'll find a man
who'll be happy just to watch you sleep.

89
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,630
Hi. l didn't know you were back.

90
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,257
-Hey, babe.

91
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,177
Yeah, l just arrived.

92
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,220
-Hey.
-You look great.

93
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,182
l wish you would have called.

94
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,642
l've never been a good caller.

95
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,145
l haven't heard from you in over a month.

96
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,522
Really? Time flies, huh?

97
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,275
Won't happen again! Sorry.

98
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,570
But l do have a surprise.

99
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,448
Rose-flavored. Your favorite.

100
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,995
And l did have something else for you.

101
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,626
lt's something l picked up from Burma.

102
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,461
lt's a ruby.

103
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,799
lt's a good color,
but it's hard to see in this light.

104
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,804
This kind of looked a little shinier
when l bought it in the shop, you know?

105
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,182
Lace, everything all right?

106
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,854
-Yeah.
-Who is he?

107
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,149
He's a friend.

108
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,360
Kind of late. You got a name?

109
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,490
Friend. She just told you.

110
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,160
Lee, come on.

111
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,538
Don't leave like this. Lee, l'm sorry.

112
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,790
l thought
things were good betzeen us.

113
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,252
l felt like you never cared about
getting in my life or letting me into yours.

114
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,878
-Stop.
-Yeah, sure l did.

115
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,714
No.
l have known you for over a year and a half,

116
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,633
and l don't even know
what you do for a living.

117
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,427
What's it matter?
When l'm here, l'm with you. That matters.

118
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,931
What matters is when you're here,
you're not really here.

119
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,100
You're a good man. l love you, but...

120
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,977
-Lace!
-l hate his voice.

121
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,604
-Did you say something?
-Don't let him come down here.

122
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,273
Please tell me you understand
what l'm saying.

123
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,692
-You have to understand.
- l understand.

124
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:57,943
You take care.

125
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,278
Lee.

126
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,659
He's no good, Lace.

127
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,327
Hey, brother, don't you ever sleep?

128
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,912
Ah.

129
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,123
This is my friend...

130
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:55,876
What's your name again, baby?

131
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,044
-Cheyenne.
-Cheyenne.

132
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,212
Cheyenne, Arapaho, Cherokee, Pawnee.

133
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,423
You want a drink?

134
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,300
l'm good.

135
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,011
Why don't you run upstairs

136
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,390
and get me one of them
super-duper six-olive martinis, baby?

137
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,017
-Anything for you, baby.
-You got it.

138
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,227
Whoo!

139
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,605
-Got a crush on me.
-Like the last 50.

140
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,231
Hey, brother, who's counting?

141
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,942
-Damn, you look good.
-Look at you.

142
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,028
You look like a goddamn
cold piece of steel, brother.

143
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:27,407
Yeah, well.
Okay, my friend, let's finish this bird up.

144
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:31,495
Well, let's do it, bro. lt's taken you
a couple of years to do a couple of letters.

145
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,459
We had to get rid of Gunner.

146
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,129
Ah, well, he went Crankenstein on your ass.
You got to cut him loose.

147
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,006
You wanna fill in?

148
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,257
Let me tell you something.

149
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,218
Remember where we was last time?

150
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,428
Where were we?
We were ass-deep in that mud and blood.

151
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,556
-Nigeria.
-Yeah, your hand was all shot to shit.

152
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,976
You were bleeding all over the place,
and l was bleeding,

153
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,145
and you know what l did?
l promised myself,

154
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,484
l don't wanna die all alone,
full of holes in the mud and blood.

155
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,821
l'm gonna die with something that counts.
l'm gonna die with a woman.

156
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,241
l wanna die with someone
who cares about me, you know.

157
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,326
l don't wanna die for a woman.

158
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,453
l wanna die laying next to a woman.
That's what l want.

159
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,750
-lt's Christmastime.
-Yeah, l can smell him from here.

160
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,591
Mr. Christmas. How you doing, brother?

161
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,635
l'm good, Tool.

162
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,929
Take a look at this. What do you think?

163
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,014
lt still looks like a black chicken.

164
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,975
-Black chicken?
- Black chicken? You done?

165
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,228
- All done.
- lt's a damn raven.

166
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,149
Oh, man. lt's good to see you, brother.

167
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,444
Wow! You know what?

168
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,489
For you, l got a great idea.

169
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,243
Why don't you let me doodle, like, a...

170
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,413
l don't know, Charlotte's web on your head?

171
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,123
On the top of your head.

172
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,125
You know, something different,
something exciting.

173
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,044
'Cause you got one of them
perfectly-shaped domed, muscular heads.

174
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,132
l could put a web on the top of the head.

175
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,510
Maybe a pregnant Charlotte
coming out of your ear,

176
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:14,222
peeking around,
making sure them bugs don't come inside.

177
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,391
Her long leg dangling down your neck.

178
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,144
-Yeah. Sexy, right?
-Very sexy.

179
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,147
Give you a little mystery,
a little more character.

180
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,483
And very sexy. You understand?

181
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,109
lt makes him stand out.

182
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,528
He looks thrilled.

183
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:32,407
Well. Okay, l'll tell you what.
l'm feeling a little lucky tonight.

184
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,202
l'm feeling very accurate.

185
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,079
-Qnother time. Come on.
-Come on, take him on.

186
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,040
Come on, Christmas. Bring it, baby.

187
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,500
Don't encourage him, please.

188
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:42,793
He never beat you in your life.

189
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,337
Come on, Christmas, no disgrace in losing.

190
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,767
Oh.

191
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,898
Yes?

192
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,027
Hmm.

193
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,195
Yeah.

194
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,323
Okay.

195
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,161
Well, l got three pieces of work.

196
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,833
Two a walk in the park,
and one to hell and back.

197
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,877
-l need some time alone.
-Hey, cheer up. Make the meeting.

198
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,603
Now we can see inside of him.

199
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,230
And l see lies.

200
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,486
He wasn't stealing from you.
He was stealing from us both.

201
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,282
You want your apes' respect?
Snuff those tzo.

202
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,130
Let's just keep it simple.

203
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,675
lf the money's right,
we don't care where the job is.

204
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,718
-Got it?
- Let's quit jerking off,

205
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,637
get down to business, see who's hungry.

206
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,640
l know your real name's
probably not Barney Ross.

207
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,600
You don't need to know my name.

208
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,104
The only thing you need to know is
the job's real and the money's real.

209
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,731
But since we're in this nice place,

210
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,110
you might as well just call me Mr. Church.

211
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,946
Okay, Church. What can l do for you?

212
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,449
ln a minute.
l'm still waiting for one more guy.

213
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,951
Who?

214
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,422
You know him?

215
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,465
Yeah, we used to be
on the same team together.

216
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,718
What's my oldest, worst friend doing here?

217
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,721
Both of your names came
to the top of the list.

218
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,723
-ls that a problem?
-Yeah.

219
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,725
Should've shot him when l had the chance.

220
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,101
Big Barney Ross.

221
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,270
Bigger Trench mouse.

222
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,565
-What are you doing? Praying for work?
-Could be.

223
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,983
Have you been sick?

224
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,527
-You've lost weight.
-Really?

225
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,030
Whatever weight l lost, you found, pal.

226
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,159
You guys aren't gonna start sucking
each other's dicks, are you?

227
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,709
Let's get down to business,
see who wants the work.

228
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,169
You ever hear of an island called Vilena?

229
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,879
-No.
-Yeah.

230
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,340
lt's a little island in the Gulf.

231
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,467
That's right.

232
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,219
-You should read more.
-Thanks.

233
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:08,058
There are resources on that island
that my people are very interested in.

234
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,062
But a general by the name of Garza
has overthrown the half-ass government.

235
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,605
That's right.

236
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,858
My people are having a problem
with this fanatic Garza.

237
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,486
-So you want Garza gone?
-l want him dead.

238
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,154
All it takes is a little army.

239
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,655
Only an idiot would do this job.

240
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,408
-How much?
-Oh, like l said.

241
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,414
l'm busy anyway,
so give this job to my friend here.

242
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,957
He loves playing in the jungle.

243
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,501
-Right?
-Right.

244
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,837
-That's right.
-Hey, why don't we have dinner?

245
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,255
Sure. When?

246
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,591
-ln a thousand years.
-Too soon.

247
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,388
-What's his fucking problem?
-He wants to be president.

248
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,936
l got to recon this island first.

249
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,729
l'll have a contact for you on the island.

250
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,191
Good riddance.

251
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,152
l got a feeling everyone else
has passed on this job,

252
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,404
so our fee is $5 mil.

253
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,324
-$5 mil?
-And l want half upfront,

254
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,951
and the other half in an offshore account.

255
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,662
-You got a problem with that?
-No.

256
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,292
What l have a problem with
is people who try to fuck me over.

257
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,548
So if you take this money
and you don't deliver,

258
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:26,594
or you try to fuck me in some kind of weird
cockamamie scheme of yours,

259
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,972
me and my people

260
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,350
are gonna come get you and your people

261
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:37,355
and chop you up
into little fucking dog treats.

262
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,233
You got a problem with that?

263
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:47,615
Let's talk.

264
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,105
Vilena.

265
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,274
Yeah, Vilena.

266
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,277
They got work there?

267
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,201
Come on.

268
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,453
You know you shouldn't be here, Gunner.

269
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,413
Don't replace me.

270
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,749
l'm good.

271
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,002
l'm still good.

272
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,087
You're still using.

273
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,839
l can't trust you anymore, man.

274
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,843
-You can't trust me?
-l can't.

275
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,432
You can't trust me?

276
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:04,525
Be careful.

277
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,069
You threatening me, Gunner?

278
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,240
Nah, l'm a nice guy.

279
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,460
So, going over the info
this guy Church gave me,

280
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,504
there's probably about
6,000 people on the island.

281
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:26,923
How many soldiers?

282
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,383
Maybe a couple of hundred.

283
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,470
lt wouldn't take much more than that
to control a space that small.

284
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,597
Great, they've got a small army.

285
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:35,682
What do we got?

286
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:36,849
Four and a half men.

287
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,478
-Not so funny.
-Ooh.

288
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,146
-l need a raise.
-Why?

289
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,815
l need more money for my son.

290
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,733
l want to send him to a better school.

291
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,111
-When did Yin Yang get a family?
-l have no idea.

292
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,071
You don't ask, l don't tell.

293
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,449
Anyway, the pay share stays the same.

294
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,660
That's the way it's gonna be.

295
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,079
Now the target on this island
is a guy named General Garza.

296
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,207
-What's the problem?
-Who gives a shit what the problem is?

297
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,002
We got enough problems
right here of our own.

298
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:07,088
We don't get rid of those first,
they're gonna get rid of us.

299
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,258
Toll Road, when was
the last time you saw your analyst?

300
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,345
-This morning.
-Yeah? What'd you talk about?

301
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,600
Avoidant personality disorder.

302
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:20,768
You think too much.

303
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,604
You know, Toll Road,
you're an unusual guy,

304
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,733
and you're always gonna have
unusual problems, right?

305
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,360
Unusual? You're talking about my ear.

306
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,486
Oh.

307
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,030
Oh, come on. Don't start with the ear again.

308
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,281
-Not the ear story.
-The ear story, not again.

309
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,366
-We all know the ear story.
-We don't want to hear the ear story.

310
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,534
Let's just concentrate on the job.

311
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,245
No. Shit no. You guys started this.

312
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,290
-We all know l wrestled in college.
-Right.

313
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:46,919
A common injury associated with that sport
is trauma to the ear, a clot.

314
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,631
Which, if left unattended,
causes a contraction in the cartilage

315
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,884
and forms cauliflower ears.

316
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,803
-And your point is?
-lt ain't easy being green.

317
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,684
Anyway, me and Christmas
are gonna head down to Vilena

318
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,895
and scout the island
to see if we should take the job.

319
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,647
How much we get paid?
l need more money for my family.

320
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,777
-What family?
-My family.

321
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,004
Listen, that girl wasn't your type.

322
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,672
Her loss, right?

323
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,674
l should have broke that bastard's jaw.

324
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,593
Maybe you were lucky.
He could have broke yours.

325
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:39,305
-lmpossible.
-You know, Christmas, l understand,

326
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,558
but let's just say you were with her
for a couple of hours,

327
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,435
and it's nice, and it's hot and heavy,

328
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,521
but after that, think about it.

329
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,523
What do you do for the rest of the day?

330
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,441
She probably did you a favor.

331
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,194
Now you have more time
to feel sorry for yourself.

332
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,780
You're a bleak bastard.

333
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,847
Morning. Morning.

334
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,768
Morning! Speak English?

335
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,439
Big plane, huh?

336
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,193
Yeah, we use it to transport
injured animals.

337
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,737
-Why are you here?
-Ornithologists.

338
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,281
We're photographing exotic birds.

339
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,961
You're nervous?

340
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,504
Nervous?

341
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,549
No. Why?

342
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,635
You just look nervous.

343
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,970
l'm not nervous. Do l look nervous?

344
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,305
Your skin looks a little dry.

345
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,015
l think you should fly
with the window closed.

346
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,936
-lt's the altitude.
-lt is the altitude. lt'll get to you.

347
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,714
-What's the address?
-Yeah, it's in my head.

348
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,758
Do you wanna share it?

349
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,135
lt's the Gloria Cantina.

350
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,180
So actually, Cantina Gloria in Spanish.

351
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,100
Spanish. Who are you, Zorro?

352
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,019
-Army.

353
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,396
-Shit.
-Come on.

354
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,730
ln there.

355
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,083
You rolling?

356
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,334
Yeah.

357
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,714
You, you, move the truck!

358
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,137
Get the suit. Tighten up on the suit.

359
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,471
Got him.

360
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,148
Look at these clowns,
hand-picked monkeys.

361
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,826
What's wrong with this picture?

362
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,913
Everything.

363
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,999
Let's get out of here.

364
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,543
No, that's the point, you know.

365
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,212
You think you know someone,
and you truly do not.

366
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:43,341
Aren't you the guy who said,
"The man who best gets along with women

367
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,843
"is the man who can
get along without them"?

368
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,845
-That's bullshit.
-Truthfully, she wasn't your type.

369
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,306
-Well, l wasn't finished.
-Look, enjoy your freedom.

370
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,601
-Yeah, you wait till it happens to you.
-lt has.

371
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
Contact's late.

372
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,943
All right, let's go.

373
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:04,779
Chill.

374
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,707
Have you ever been rejected?

375
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,799
You're really pushing the boundaries
of our relationship, you know that?

376
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,524
-ls that the contact?
-Could be.

377
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,903
Too bad she's so homely.

378
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,321
Stay focused.

379
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:51,700
Are you the contact?

380
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,327
l'm Sandra.

381
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:54,870
What are your names?

382
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,831
Buda, Pest.

383
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,503
Follow me, please.

384
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,427
Buda and Pest? Nice.

385
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,190
Did you do all these?

386
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,652
Yes. Take one.

387
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,362
A gift.

388
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,864
l don't take free gifts.

389
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,617
-How much you want for it?
-Nothing.

390
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,661
Taking money for something is not a gift.

391
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,497
Taking nothing for something is.

392
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,458
ls it like this all the time?

393
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,169
This place was a beautiful place.

394
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:48,048
Then one day, they came with money,
and General Garza sold his soul.

395
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,800
And people who fight back are killed.

396
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,385
You said "they" came with money.

397
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,470
Who's "they"?

398
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,346
Some Americans. That's all l know.

399
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,308
But someday all of this will change back.

400
00:32:58,894 --> 00:32:59,852
You really believe that?

401
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,270
Yes.

402
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,772
The best day will be
the one when we can say

403
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,983
our lives are our own again.

404
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,072
You have a family, Sandra?

405
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,242
My mother, when l was little, she died.

406
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,245
And my father, he's gone, too.

407
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,457
Sandra, how close
can you get to the palace?

408
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,375
The palace? Why?

409
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,086
We just wanna check out the view.

410
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,671
There is no view.

411
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,423
Why don't we just go there anyway, okay?

412
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,189
Where is my grove?

413
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,567
Where is your manpower?

414
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,450
Do you know how long it takes
for a coca field to produce?

415
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,202
Of course you don't. Let me tell you.

416
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,496
We are eight weeks behind schedule.

417
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,083
Kick your peasants' asses.
Get me my product.

418
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:08,420
When you talk like this to me
in front of my men, it's no good.

419
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,299
l am your lifeline.

420
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,969
l am the one who coordinates
all this confusion.

421
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,429
l am making you rich.

422
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,557
And being wealthy is very good.

423
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:23,644
lt allows people to be the real asswipes
nature intended them to be.

424
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,820
Sometimes things
are just not worth the money.

425
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,572
Sure they are.

426
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,422
Sandra, are we close?

427
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,923
lt's just over there.

428
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,675
Pull over, please.

429
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,059
- Where are you going?
-Where am l going?

430
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,895
Well, l suppose you could say

431
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,732
l like to look at the world
from different views.

432
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Don't lose my hat.

433
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,657
We should get going.

434
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,868
He's very emotional.

435
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,452
What are you looking for?

436
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:10,501
Sandra, how do l know
you're not setting us up?

437
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,128
What does "setting us up" mean?

438
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,506
You don't look like the kind of person
that we deal with all the time.

439
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,758
How did you get involved in this?

440
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,760
An American came here.

441
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,931
He asked my friend to show you around.
He was afraid, so he asked me to.

442
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,015
And you're not afraid?

443
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,683
l'm afraid.

444
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,228
But he said maybe you can help Vilena.

445
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,438
l don't think so.

446
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,149
Listen, if l were you, l'd leave.

447
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,652
Just leave.

448
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,786
You should leave.

449
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,337
Don't say anything. Let me talk.

450
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,697
-

451
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,997
Run!

452
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,191
-Get her.
-Got it.

453
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,247
Are you crazy?

454
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,458
-You could have killed me!
-You're welcome.

455
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,339
What?

456
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,552
All right, speed it up. We're on the way.

457
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,934
lf we get out of here, it's a miracle.

458
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,604
-She's coming with us, right?
-She'd better.

459
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,983
-How can we leave?
-We got a plane.

460
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,402
-No, l can't leave.
-Yeah, well, you don't have a choice.

461
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,571
-Yes, l do.
-Yeah? They'll find you in an hour.

462
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,366
-Maybe, but l'm staying.
-Staying for what? There's nothing here.

463
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,867
Not to you.

464
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,789
Look, if you stay, then you're dead.
She's leaving with us.

465
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,172
-l got the guys inside.
-Give me a 60-second lead.

466
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,966
-You got it. Go, go, go!
-Come on.

467
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:03,734
Get in.

468
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,069
-Get in.
-No.

469
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,487
-Get in.
-No, no, l can't.

470
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,615
-Let's go.
-l can't. l belong here.

471
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,617
-There's no time.
-Go, you go.

472
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,577
Please, go.

473
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,661
Shit.

474
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,430
Hey!

475
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,391
You look nervous.

476
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,126
Come on!

477
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,267
Run, you bastard!

478
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,564
Come on!

479
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,945
-Where's the girl?
-Gone. She wouldn't leave.

480
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,572
Wouldn't leave?

481
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,615
Why the hell would anybody wanna stay?

482
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,335
The hell...

483
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,047
The hell with it.

484
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,717
-Climb, baby, climb.
-Come on, baby.

485
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,646
God damn it.

486
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,531
-Going back?
-Yeah.

487
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,658
-Fry and die.
-Fry and die. Let's do it.

488
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,275
What are they doing?

489
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,378
Yes!

490
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,266
Great job.

491
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,435
That was a statement.

492
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:10,498
How did tzo obvious professionals
pass right through security personnel,

493
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,959
kill 41 soldiers and get away?

494
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,837
With help, that's how.

495
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,674
Everything's under control,
except one detail,

496
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:23,219
a daughter who wants her father
and company dead and gone.

497
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:24,888
Bad Shakespeare.

498
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,141
Somehow the company parasites got to her.

499
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,976
Look, she's your daughter, and that's tragic.

500
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,813
But blood or not, she goes.

501
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,650
Call it the price of doing business.

502
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,152
You don't kill your familia.

503
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,614
Come around my house
during the holidays, pal.

504
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,843
Nice bird.

505
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,262
First of all, l don't feel comfortable

506
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,890
talking business with a giant
carrying a shotgun.

507
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,767
Pretty boy wouldn't give it up.

508
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,477
Not if you wanna know where they are.

509
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,853
What do you know?

510
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,230
l used to be one of them.

511
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:20,944
Why are you turning on them?

512
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,112
Lovers' quarrel.

513
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,739
We settle on 50.

514
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,116
No, math whizz.

515
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,369
We settle on 100 grand,
upfront, in my pocket.

516
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,830
The guy thinks he's a real badass.

517
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,873
This geezer's a bloody joke.

518
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,709
Life's a joke, shitbird!

519
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,796
lf you don't want that Fu Manchu
knocked back into the '60s,

520
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,383
you'd better keep your gum-chewing trap
shut and show some respect!

521
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,135
Bring it.

522
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,469
Hey, be nice.

523
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,180
Need a facelift, pretty boy?

524
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:52,892
Back off, Paine.

525
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,019
l'm gonna kill him.

526
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,520
We need him.

527
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,523
Back off!

528
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,238
Here's what l think is happening.

529
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,700
This guy who calls himself Church
is really a front for the ClA.

530
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,994
So we're working for the agency?

531
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,538
- Yeah.
- Church hired us to take out the General,

532
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,583
but the real target's this guy,
James Munroe.

533
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,920
He used to be with the agency,
but got greedy,

534
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,589
went rogue and teamed up with the General

535
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,758
to keep the whole drug operation
for themselves.

536
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,885
And that's a big cash loss.

537
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,013
But Church and the agency
can't afford to send in the Navy SEALs

538
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,766
or the Special Forces
to take out one of their own.

539
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,061
That'd be a bad headline,
so they hire us to kill him.

540
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,730
And they're back in business.

541
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,941
- And we're taken out.
- Nobody's gonna miss us.

542
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,611
- ls it still $5 million?
- You'd never live to spend it.

543
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,238
l'm telling Church the deal's off.

544
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,365
Sound about right?

545
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,533
That's about right.

546
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:51,659
l agree.

547
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,436
Where is he?

548
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,410
-Who the hell is that?
-Some punk.

549
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:37,247
-Don't worry about it.
-We got your back.

550
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,166
lf he comes over here,
we'll bust his ass.

551
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,049
What do you want?

552
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,593
Your life.

553
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:52,679
l was thinking about taking it.

554
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,930
ls that right?

555
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:58,059
But l don't do so well in tight spaces,
so going to prison worries me.

556
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,645
You shouldn't have bruised her face.

557
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:01,729
Really?

558
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,690
l would have liked to have kept it
the way it was.

559
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,608
Keep the bitch, 'cause l'm done with it.

560
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,308
Lee.

561
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,734
Next time, l'll deflate all your balls, friend.

562
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,079
Now you know what l do for a living.

563
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,624
l'm not perfect, but you should have waited.

564
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,877
l was worth it.

565
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,398
So your daughter paints, too?

566
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,068
This is how it starts!

567
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,861
Let's go. There's nothing here.

568
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:16,281
Or how it ends!

569
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,603
What's the matter, Barney?
Don't you ever sleep?

570
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,605
No. What happened to your girlfriend?

571
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,775
Another one bites the dust,
brother.

572
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:58,114
l was gonna paint this for her,
and you know what? l'm gonna finish it.

573
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,783
Then l'm just gonna smash the shit
out of it.

574
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,285
You wanna be alone?

575
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,997
Not really. So, what's up?

576
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,458
On this island, there was this girl.

577
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,626
There usually are.

578
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:15,465
You know, she showed us around.
She was the target's daughter.

579
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:21,262
And when she had a chance to leave,
she didn't do it.

580
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,557
She had some guts.

581
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,311
Why can't l get that out of my mind?

582
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,771
Hmm.

583
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,939
You know, she stands for something.

584
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,108
You know, man, we don't stand for shit.

585
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:39,364
We used to, but that dried all up,
like this is gonna dry all up.

586
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:41,741
This here paint is gonna dry.

587
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,035
What dried up?

588
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,286
Hmm.

589
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,165
Just belief, man. Just the belief in the soul,

590
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,335
just, l don't know,
the human parts, brother.

591
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,922
You remember that time
we was up in Bosnia?

592
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:00,301
We took down them Serb bad boys.

593
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:05,765
All our guys were getting chopped up
all around us,

594
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,434
and there was blood everywhere.

595
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,269
l never thought l was gonna make it
out of there,

596
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:13,314
-and l know you didn't, either.
-Yeah.

597
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:16,859
Kind of feeling like dead, too, you know?

598
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,654
My head's all a very black place.

599
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,697
l don't believe in shit.

600
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,451
Just goddamn Dracula black.

601
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:31,374
l remember l got this bottle of the local shit
they have over there, that Slivovitz.

602
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,627
l don't know,
l think that's what it was called.

603
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,463
And l ain't feeling no pain now.

604
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,508
And l'd come up on this...

605
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,762
l'd come up on this old wooden bridge,
and l see this...

606
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,689
l see this woman standing there, you know?
And she's...

607
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,650
l stepped out, and she saw me,

608
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:02,321
and she's just looking right in my eyes,
and l was looking right in her eyes.

609
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,075
l knew what she was gonna do.

610
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,662
She looked at me,
and l knew she was gonna jump.

611
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,914
You know what l did, man?

612
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:17,211
l just turned around and l kept walking,
until l heard that splash.

613
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,592
Then she was gone.

614
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:26,929
And after taking all them lives,

615
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:32,602
here was one that l could have saved,
but l didn't.

616
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,648
And what l realized later on was,

617
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:43,321
if l had saved that woman, l might have,

618
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,367
l don't know,
saved what was left of my soul, you know?

619
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:38,000
A very wise dead man once told me
that a real man never strikes a woman.

620
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:43,256
You push some if you have to,
but you never strike them.

621
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,801
That's the way l was raised.

622
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:51,180
This man, however,
does not share that moral dilemma. No.

623
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,100
This man,

624
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,604
well...

625
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:04,527
So the question, Sandra,
why were the Americans here?

626
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:56,537
Don't fight back.

627
00:56:58,165 --> 00:56:59,665
Just relax.

628
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:32,948
Again, what did the Americans tell you?

629
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,242
Who were they after?

630
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,038
Continue.

631
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,770
- l'm going back to Vilena.
- Yeah? Something change?

632
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,980
-What's the plan?
-There is no plan.

633
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:08,651
-Wait, wait, wait. We need a strategy.
-l'm going. You're not.

634
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,404
-What?
-l said l'm going. You guys aren't.

635
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,323
-What are you, out of your mind?
-lt's personal business.

636
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,992
-You don't owe that woman nothing.
-l didn't say l did.

637
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,120
You want to kill yourself? Go ahead, fine.
Your call.

638
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:22,206
Listen, l don't want to kill myself.
You guys, take care. l got to do this.

639
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,208
-Hey, hey, hey.
-What?

640
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,043
Don't lay this guilt crap on us.
We don't deserve it.

641
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:30,673
This is my choice. There's no guilt.
There's no guilt. Take care.

642
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,181
Yeah, fuck it. His choice. Yeah.

643
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,400
l said l'm going alone.

644
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,484
l'm going, too.

645
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,486
Come on, Yang, get the hell out.

646
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,113
Just drive.

647
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,958
Don't lose your nerve.

648
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,795
Don't talk to me, cockroach.

649
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,434
So, why are you doing this?

650
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,227
Friends die together.

651
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,273
Hey. Give me the good luck ring. Come on.

652
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,151
Don't make me hurt you, Yang. Come on.

653
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,362
-Speed better than luck.
-Whatever.

654
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,157
lt's difficult.

655
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,575
What is?

656
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,994
My life is difficult. l need more money.

657
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,078
Why is that?

658
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:45,206
-l work harder than the rest.
-No, you don't.

659
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:49,919
Yes, l do. Because they're taller,
everything is harder for me.

660
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,756
When l get hurt, the wound is bigger
because l'm smaller.

661
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,090
Mmm.

662
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:57,009
When l travel, l need to go farther.

663
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,511
l know, 'cause you're smaller, right?

664
00:59:58,845 --> 00:59:59,970
Yes.

665
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:03,349
My life is harder than you think.

666
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,854
-l need more money.
-l know. You told me.

667
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,272
For your family, right?

668
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,607
l don't have family.

669
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,691
l know.

670
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,611
Maybe one day l will.

671
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,155
--Down!

672
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,808
-Get out there!
-Why me?

673
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,309
Because you're smaller.

674
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,078
Oops.

675
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,413
Do that again, l'll kill you!

676
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,617
Gunner!

677
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:50,998
Come on, Gunner.

678
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,209
Man's good.

679
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:29,453
What are you doing? You're dead, junkie!

680
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:36,835
lnsect.

681
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:51,725
Bail!

682
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:01,819
Shit!

683
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:31,724
Yang!

684
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:42,609
What do you wear, size three?
Bring it, happy feet.

685
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,635
My turn!

686
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,102
Gunner!

687
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,736
Shit!

688
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,099
You shot me.

689
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:40,727
Hey, don't say that.
You were gonna kill him.

690
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,313
l was just gonna scare him.

691
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,857
Don't put that on me. You never liked him.

692
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,404
Am l dying?

693
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,781
The shot's a couple of inches
above your heart.

694
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:57,536
l'll take that as a yes.

695
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:03,959
Gunner, who sent you? Who hired you?

696
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,753
Who cares?

697
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:07,879
Do yourself a favor.

698
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:13,760
Don't go out a total asshole.
Cooperate for once in your miserable life.

699
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,597
Then bury me right.

700
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,140
You got it.

701
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:22,644
Who sent you? Who sent you?
ls the girl still alive?

702
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,146
Come closer.

703
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,791
You know, it's not easy being your friend.

704
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:46,668
That's true.

705
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:49,254
Man, we'll die with you.
Just don't ask us to do it tzice.

706
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:53,425
l know the layout.
l'll tell you about it on the way.

707
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,052
What the hell happened to you?

708
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,887
lt's too sad to talk about it.

709
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,683
Let's fly.

710
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:22,412
You know, the enemy's
always been terrified of noise,

711
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:24,289
especially shotguns.

712
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,293
With this big boy spitting out
250 rounds a minute,

713
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,087
you tell me who's tolerating that.

714
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,841
Absolutely zero.

715
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:39,346
So let me get this right.
Gunner tries to kill you, you shoot him

716
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,431
and, at death's door,
he gives you the whole layout?

717
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:42,891
Yeah, something like that.

718
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,686
-l would have win.
-l know you would have win.

719
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,608
You know what? l trust you.

720
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:54,569
l want you to meet my girlfriend.

721
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:58,323
Omya Kaboom.

722
01:07:58,408 --> 01:07:59,908
You lost me there.

723
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:02,661
When Omya's prime is struck,

724
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:06,164
she gets off a miniature warhead
that arms itself.

725
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,876
And when that happens,
anything that gets in my lady's way

726
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:12,629
becomes instant red sauce and Jell-O.

727
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:14,005
And if that doesn't work,

728
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,095
her sister will.

729
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,638
You should meet my doctor.

730
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:23,056
Too late.

731
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:51,853
lt's 3:36. We have 20 minutes
to take this place down.

732
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,814
l'll take the cellar.

733
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,148
We've got company.

734
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,776
l got him. You guys take off.

735
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,890
ls there a reason you've taken
the soldiers this man has trained

736
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,351
and made them look like fools?

737
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,479
They look like warriors.

738
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:41,111
Warriors loyal to me.

739
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:46,491
l thought the people of Vilena
hired these mercenaries to kill me.

740
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:52,414
But then l think maybe this is your plan,
because you cannot control me.

741
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:55,959
And torturing Sandra works for you.

742
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,671
You want to kill her to make me suffer.

743
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:04,259
A man can never kill a child.

744
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:06,803
But you can.

745
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:08,805
Bring Sandra here.

746
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:13,727
Bring her now or l will kill you.

747
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,186
Go get her.

748
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,026
-

749
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,831
-No, no.
-Sandra, Sandra, it's me. Sandra.

750
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:25,293
Hey, it's me, it's me. Sandra, it's me.

751
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:28,838
lt's me. lt's me. lt's okay.

752
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:32,342
Nobody's gonna hurt you, all right?

753
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:33,760
How are you here?

754
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,428
l just am.

755
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:39,265
-Can you move?
-Yes.

756
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:40,809
Okay.

757
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,228
Yeah, okay. All right, let's go.

758
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,149
Time's up.

759
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,567
-Where's Barney?
-What's the call?

760
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:50,652
We can't find him in 10 minutes,

761
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:51,694
we're going out the same way we came in.

762
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:53,113
-No way.
-That's what he'd want.

763
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:55,240
Ten minutes! Let's go.

764
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,102
No. Stop him!

765
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:27,147
-This is not his fight. lt's mine.
-Get her out of here.

766
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:29,357
Seal the building.

767
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,318
Stand him up.

768
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,992
You know,
if you didn't have this Kevlar vest,

769
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,327
your insides are gonna be
like fucking mush.

770
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:42,537
Well, ain't that sad?

771
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:43,788
You know, you're a lucky man.

772
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:45,373
You're the lucky man.

773
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:47,834
No, no, you're a lucky man.

774
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:50,879
-He told me to keep you conscious.
-Did he?

775
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,215
All right.

776
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,512
You're a real tough guy, aren't you?

777
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:02,056
-What?
-Are you a real tough guy?

778
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,517
Look at me, you piece of trash.

779
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:06,186
How many men you got?

780
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:07,896
Just your mother.

781
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:22,869
Now this is your last time.

782
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:26,539
You give me the right answer,
and l'll cut you a break.

783
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:31,544
lf you give me the wrong answer,
you will die a damn slow death.

784
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:33,213
-Do you understand me?

785
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,089
-Do you understand me?
-Yep.

786
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:38,009
-Who sent you?
-Can't breathe.

787
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,260
Loosen up.

788
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:41,721
Who sent you?

789
01:16:44,224 --> 01:16:46,267
Your hairdresser.

790
01:18:58,233 --> 01:18:59,484
Go, we gotta go!

791
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,173
Come on.

792
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:46,781
Shit!

793
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:09,887
Remember this shit at Christmas!

794
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:14,517
Damn, that thing's loud.

795
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:17,186
-What happened to you?
-l got my ass kicked.

796
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:21,440
Come on. Get my rifle. Let's go.

797
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:29,740
What's this?

798
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:34,996
Everything bad that has happened,
you bring.

799
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,664
Take your money!

800
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:40,918
l only see death with you. Take it all and go.

801
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,295
l'm not going anywhere.

802
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,629
You are done here.

803
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:45,006
You can't succeed without me.

804
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:46,549
l am the leader.

805
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:48,134
You're a puppet in a hat.

806
01:20:49,761 --> 01:20:50,887
No.

807
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:10,948
Now!

808
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,077
Get back.

809
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:25,588
Throw down your weapons.

810
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:28,507
There's no way out.

811
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,720
Shit's getting old!

812
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:35,264
-Your lucky ring stinks.
-l know.

813
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,308
-Let's backtrack.
-The building's rigged.

814
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,435
lt's the only way out.

815
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,280
Chopper's ready in five minutes.

816
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:52,406
We're not leaving yet.

817
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:04,919
-What's he saying?
-He said we're dead with an accent.

818
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,337
We ain't dead.

819
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,214
-Blow the building.
-Not yet.

820
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:11,926
We will kill this American disease.

821
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:30,778
Blow the building!

822
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:32,113
She's still in there!

823
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,698
The money!

824
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:45,710
Blow it!

825
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:54,802
She's out. Blow the fucking building!

826
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:46,205
l'm out!

827
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,677
Let's go. Come on.

828
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:44,221
Cut Munroe off!

829
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:45,449
Come on!

830
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,218
Hey!

831
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:29,762
-Thing's too heavy.
-Give me it.

832
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:31,930
-What do you want me to do?
-Throw it as hard as you can.

833
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,417
-Blow the dump.
-Got it!

834
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:33,784
Munroe!

835
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:39,123
Drop the weapons,
or l'll put a bullet through her eye.

836
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:42,626
Don't test me.

837
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:55,055
No, no, no.

838
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,474
Shut up or l'll kill you.

839
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:02,521
The agency parasites hired you,
didn't they?

840
01:30:02,605 --> 01:30:06,483
l'd have paid you tzice as much
to go fishing.

841
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:09,278
You'd have to think
l'm pretty freaking stupid

842
01:30:09,362 --> 01:30:11,113
to surrender to the agency.

843
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:15,993
Why would l do that? l created this.
l made it all happen.

844
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:20,664
And then they wanted me out. Why?
Because l saw the big picture.

845
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:22,750
Stop walking.

846
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:28,589
And what about me and you?
We're both the same.

847
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:32,801
We're both mercenaries.
We're both dead inside.

848
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,220
So why the hell did you come after me?

849
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:38,766
l didn't come after you, dipshit.
l came for her!

850
01:30:57,994 --> 01:30:59,703
-You okay?
-Yeah.

851
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:02,164
Call it a tie.

852
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:06,001
Yeah, l guess so.

853
01:31:06,377 --> 01:31:08,754
You know, you're not as fast as you think.

854
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:11,006
l'm beginning to sense that.

855
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:27,815
The second account number's mine.
lt'll help get things going around here.

856
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:30,234
No, l can't. You've done so much.

857
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:34,571
Yeah, well, so have you. A gift for a gift.
You take it.

858
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:39,076
-Will you come back?
-l promise l'll always be around.

859
01:31:48,127 --> 01:31:49,711
You take care, Sandra.

860
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:53,715
You take care.

861
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:00,889
Bye.

862
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:28,959
What?

863
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:30,627
Truthfully?

864
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,212
Yeah?

865
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:34,548
l never really thought she was your type.

866
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:01,533
All right, baby. All right.

867
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:02,993
Come on, let's see what you got.

868
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:05,454
Oh! Oh!

869
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:06,830
That's my boy!

870
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:12,836
Go south!

871
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:18,175
Oh! Oh!

872
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:20,344
You lost! You lost!

873
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:23,931
Whoo!

874
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,516
So you're back from the dead.
How you healing?

875
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:30,562
Good, considering
you could have killed me.

876
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:32,230
l forgive you.

877
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:33,774
Okay.

878
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:35,943
l would have win.

879
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:37,694
Of course.

880
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:40,822
Hey, Gunner.

881
01:33:41,532 --> 01:33:44,534
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, brother. Therapy.

882
01:33:45,912 --> 01:33:47,204
Man's got a point.

883
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:52,542
You know what?

884
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:54,753
l'm gonna do you a favor, Tool.

885
01:33:56,255 --> 01:33:58,632
"l once knew a man called Tool..."

886
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:00,467
l love poetry.

887
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:04,179
"To me, was the epitome of cool

888
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:07,057
"He was good with a knife

889
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,812
"Bad with a wife..."

890
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:14,022
That hurts.

891
01:34:14,107 --> 01:34:16,358
"But to think he could beat me

892
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:20,570
"Dreaming he'd defeat me

893
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,573
"Cool Tool

894
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,035
"You gotta be a fool"

895
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:32,666
Oh, yeah.

896
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:33,834
Whoa!
