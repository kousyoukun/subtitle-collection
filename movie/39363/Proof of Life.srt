1
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:54,177
This is the conclusive Kidnap andRansom
Report for Mr. Pierre Lenoir.

2
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:56,354
Location: Chechnya.

3
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,406
Result:

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,588
Positive.

5
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:01,597
We were contracted by AGP underwriters
who insured the victim.

6
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,062
Mr. Lenoir was abducted January 21
from Russian-held territory...

7
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:10,819
...by members ofthe Chechen
Nationalist Militia.

8
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:15,743
Their first demand was for $5million.

9
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:20,992
My ability to negotiate directly
with the Chechens...

10
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:23,453
...was subverted
by Russian military command...

11
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:25,437
...who monitoredmy every move.

12
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:28,957
After 36 days...

13
00:01:29,097 --> 00:01:32,544
...lhadnegotiated the finalransom figure
down to $750,000.

14
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:38,118
Finalproofoflife was received
midnight Wednesday, February 27.

15
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:45,928
The next morning,
l was informedby the Russians...

16
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:49,703
...that l wouldbeprohibited
from personally delivering the ransom.

17
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,547
Any confidence that these men
would deliver the ransom money...

18
00:01:56,617 --> 00:02:00,327
...andreturn the hostage safely, had,
by this point, been dissipated.

19
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:01,799
Tell your colonel...

20
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:03,774
...it's his responsibility now.

21
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:06,151
He's got his orders. He fucks about...

22
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:08,517
...l'll be the least of his problems.

23
00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:17,438
Factoring the time-sensitive interests
of the group holding Lenoir...

24
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:20,449
...the limited communication available
with the London office...

25
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:22,115
...and the Russian insistence...

26
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:25,252
...that they, and they alone,
deliver the ransom payment.

27
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:29,193
lmade the decision
that there was simply no alternative...

28
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:32,106
...but to give the Russians
exactly what they wanted.

29
00:02:39,915 --> 00:02:42,435
Knowing that l'dretain possession
ofthe ransom money...

30
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:44,842
...l'dmanaged to contact
the Chechens privately.

31
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:47,843
We hadagreed to rendezvous
at an alternative location.

32
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:51,937
Transport options in this area are limited.

33
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:53,159
Drive!

34
00:02:53,228 --> 00:02:55,137
So l did the best that l could.

35
00:02:57,228 --> 00:02:58,853
The group holding Mr. Lenoir...

36
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:02,502
...was responsible for a dozen kidnappings
over thepast two years.

37
00:03:02,668 --> 00:03:04,806
This is a battle-testedguerrilla militia.

38
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:08,357
They are well-armed,
highly mobile and extremely unpredictable.

39
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:14,121
Mr. Lenoir was found to be
in an excellent state ofhealth...

40
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:16,196
...considering the circumstances.

41
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:26,954
l sent the Russians away.
l don't know how much time we've got.

42
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:29,186
Following a review ofthe ransom payment.

43
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:31,080
Mr. Lenoir was released into our care.

44
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:38,920
The success ofthis extraction depended on
a brisk, timely, transfer schedule.

45
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,659
We were, however, not quite fast enough.

46
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:50,469
Airborne!

47
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:53,676
Come in hot, Joe. This place is going loud!

48
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:58,310
Evac emergency RV. Repeat, ERV.

49
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:20,170
Airborne, l have a visual!

50
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,070
There are two dead trees
in the center of the field.

51
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:26,861
l'm 50 yards to the west of the south tree.

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,859
Don't give me any shit, Joseph.
l've got injured cargo. Get your ass down!

53
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:57,710
Go!

54
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,277
This extraction didn't go down well
for the Chechens or our Russian hosts.

55
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:29,034
As a result...

56
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:32,583
...my ability to function as a Kidnap
andRansom consultant in the area...

57
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,152
...has been permanently compromised.

58
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:37,263
Mr. Lenoir was examined
by mobile medical...

59
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,469
...and as per
his insurance company's request...

60
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,638
...transported to Athens yesterday
for surgical treatment.

61
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:46,216
At this time, we have contracts
with all three insurance underwriters...

62
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,903
...holding K and R policies
in the west-Asian, post-Soviet republics.

63
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:53,359
This area is clearly
in a critical state of transition...

64
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:56,563
...and demands
the most vigorous security precautions.

65
00:05:56,627 --> 00:05:59,147
What did they bill last year,
our three underwriters?

66
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:00,464
Total premium?

67
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:03,533
-$28 million.
-And the ransom total?

68
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:05,491
Paid out on policies?

69
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:06,636
$26 million.

70
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:07,852
Bloody hell.

71
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,784
Set up some premium meetings.
Wave the red flag a bit.

72
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,963
Excellent job, Terry. Thank you.

73
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:15,595
As always, outstanding.

74
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:16,593
Sir.

75
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:19,851
Where are we next? Pakistan?

76
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:21,805
Colombia?

77
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:08,535
Hello.

78
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:11,190
Peter, is that you?

79
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,562
Baby, it's me.

80
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,485
Can you hear me? lt's about tonight.

81
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,176
l'm shopping for dinner.

82
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,575
The goodnews is, l'll definitely be back.

83
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,240
Yeah? Go on.

84
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:23,948
We've got to go to this thing tonight.
The dinner. The charity event.

85
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:26,707
You're kidding, right?

86
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:29,044
No. l'm getting completely screwedhere.

87
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:32,373
None ofmy equipment's here.
None ofthe stufftheypromised.

88
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:35,473
l've got 60 guys running around thejungle
with nothing to do.

89
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:37,329
Something is really messed up here.

90
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,342
l'm going to pin
these bastards down tonight.

91
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,864
You really want to put me
at a table full of oil executives?

92
00:07:44,184 --> 00:07:47,315
They're big boys. They can stand up
to a little hippie like you.

93
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:50,193
Can l tell them what l think of them?

94
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,330
lf you really want to skip it--

95
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,855
No, l'll go, l'll be there.

96
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:58,739
And l'll be on my best behavior.

97
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,088
Great.

98
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:02,357
Thank you, Alice. l mean it.

99
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:04,433
l'llhave to borrow a dress from Norma.

100
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:09,208
Get Sandro to drop my tux by the airfield
before he stops back andpicks you up.

101
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:11,182
Yeah, don't worry about it.

102
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,356
Please don't leave me hanging out there
with thosepeople.

103
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:15,699
Andbe careful.

104
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,199
l will. l love you.

105
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,200
Peter, what's happening?
What about the equipment?

106
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:30,768
Everything is taken care of.

107
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:33,144
l'm meeting with the guys
from Quad Carbon tonight.

108
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,699
His mom said
he was exactly the same as a baby.

109
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:45,329
She's right, you know.

110
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:46,481
Hey, baby.

111
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:49,364
l was worried about you.

112
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:52,884
-l told you he'd make it.
-Hi, Peter.

113
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:55,764
-Let's find our tables.
-We'll see you inside.

114
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:05,622
Look at you,
all decked out in Norma's duds.

115
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:07,731
lt's my debut as a corporate wife.

116
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,233
Whatever it is...

117
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,960
...it is working.

118
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:16,757
l'm dressing like this all the time now.
You ought to come around more often.

119
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,719
-l guess l got some making up to do.
-l guess so.

120
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,874
l just want to know
what the hell is going on.

121
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:16,404
-Nobody called?
-No.

122
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:17,908
l was there all day.

123
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:20,309
Hey, y'all. Sorry we're late.

124
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,932
-Where is everybody?
-Nobody called you?

125
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:24,435
Are you shitting me?

126
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:28,339
Fellner, Buddy and their gang left
for Houston this morning. A powwow.

127
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:32,724
Peggy said if he was going, she was going.
l guess all the girls jumped on that.

128
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,141
So, it's just us.

129
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:36,888
Better late than never.

130
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,253
So, lvy tell you?

131
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:40,500
Houston.

132
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:43,868
This morning. All of them.
Fellner chartered a plane.

133
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,179
What's in Houston?

134
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:46,294
New money.

135
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:59,005
Peter, look.

136
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:11,359
How did it get so bad so fast?

137
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:13,181
Come on, man.

138
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:15,130
Where the hell have you been?

139
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,023
l've been trying to build a dam.

140
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:19,806
Pick your head up every now and then,
take a look around.

141
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:22,077
You're building a charity water project.

142
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:25,527
As for the company, you're nothing
but a humanitarian window-dressing.

143
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:29,148
Quad Carbon came down here looking
for a lucky break and we got nailed.

144
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:32,573
We've a billion-dollar pipeline
that hasn't spit out a gallon yet.

145
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:36,219
Oil prices are going through the roof.
We can't take advantage of it.

146
00:11:37,345 --> 00:11:39,385
You know, market close today...

147
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:42,807
...Quad Carbon stock down $10 and falling.

148
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:45,497
The vultures are circling.

149
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:47,775
Which vulture is in Houston?

150
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:49,083
lt's Octonal.

151
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:52,513
They're the only ones big enough
to come and get this thing on track.

152
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:53,920
Peter, look!

153
00:11:58,627 --> 00:11:59,739
Peter, look!

154
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:10,562
Maybe you missed it,
but this happens to be a big deal for me.

155
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:12,642
l think l know that.

156
00:12:13,762 --> 00:12:15,551
You sure don't act like it.

157
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,608
Maybe it's a sign. Maybe it's just a sign
that we should go home.

158
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:23,807
You tell me. This all falls apart,
this goes away, what was the point?

159
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:27,997
-The point of what?
-l don't know. How about everything?

160
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,522
How about Africa? How about Egypt?
How about Thailand?

161
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:35,393
How about eight years of shit postings?
Eight years of working for assholes.

162
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,143
Eight years of working
on somebody else's bad ideas.

163
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:40,186
Wait. l don't get it here.

164
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:43,330
Suddenly the last eight years,
that's just all shit now?

165
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,119
-ls that what l said?
-l thought...

166
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:47,076
...we were doing what we wanted to do.

167
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,082
l thought we were living our lives together.

168
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:51,677
That's not what l said.
This isn't just a job!

169
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:55,268
This is everything
l have prepared for my entire life!

170
00:12:56,773 --> 00:13:01,475
lf Jerry's right, if it's Octonal, they come in
and take this over, l'm fucked!

171
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:05,821
l wouldn't get too upset about it.

172
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:08,476
Maybe Octonal wants a dam
of their very own.

173
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,556
Octonal doesn't build dams, they kick ass.

174
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:13,248
They don't care about these people.
lt's all about profits.

175
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:17,410
l don't get it. What is the surprise here?
You wanted to work for an oil company.

176
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:20,348
l don't work for an oil company.
That's not what l'm doing here!

177
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:22,527
l'm building a dam
that will save people's lives!

178
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:26,788
You are building a dam so an oil company
can get a pipeline contract.

179
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:30,530
-Who cares who pays for it?
-Apparently, no one!

180
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,667
You're drunk.

181
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,766
No, Peter.

182
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:38,495
This isn't us.

183
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:41,054
-Let's just go home.
-Great.

184
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:44,225
That is so supportive.

185
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:46,910
You don't like this place either.

186
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:49,155
-l like the project.
-l don't have a project!

187
00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:51,427
Then find a fucking project!

188
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,199
Damn.

189
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,491
Use your talent, your experience.

190
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,389
There's got to be 25 agencies
working down here.

191
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:06,627
There's food projects, health-care projects.

192
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:09,761
Any one of them would be thrilled
to have you on their staff.

193
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:11,301
l don't get this.

194
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,211
You've hit the ground running
every place we've ever gone.

195
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,215
l'm sorry l'm not bouncing back
fast enough for you.

196
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,864
Five months here, you haven't even started
to learn the language.

197
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:23,747
l am not getting pregnant again
in the Third World.

198
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:25,442
No, not Africa.

199
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:28,389
We're not gonna bring that into this.

200
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:30,466
-''That''?
-Yes, that.

201
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:33,988
When the hell are you gonna move on?
lt's over. lt happened.

202
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:37,952
-lt wasn't meant to be. Get over it!
-l don't want to move on!

203
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:41,799
Well, l have. And goddamn it,
l'm right here. Right now.

204
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:46,723
My whole situation is falling apart
and somehow, we're back to this agenda.

205
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:50,179
l am not an agenda.

206
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:00,393
You know what?

207
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:02,111
Go home.

208
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,195
l'm serious.

209
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:06,565
Take a break.

210
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,840
Well, it's what you want.

211
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:13,345
lsn't it?

212
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:16,330
l never said that.

213
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,228
Then l guess it's me.

214
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:38,407
No.

215
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:43,594
Ted, tell Octonalhow much local support
we've got down here.

216
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,318
l don't know what to tell you.

217
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:47,078
We're in Houston looking for help.

218
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,253
Octonal has their own way of doing things.

219
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:52,203
l'm not the only one
who's going to fight for this.

220
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:56,294
lf that's a threat, l'm not sure what that is.
But, you lose sight....

221
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,461
No. Ted, you're breaking up.

222
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:03,075
Don't lose track of where you stand
in the food chain around here.

223
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:06,662
l've got people here who've burned
their bridges to come work with us.

224
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,875
l can barely hear you.

225
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:09,058
Can you hear me?

226
00:16:09,453 --> 00:16:11,177
Ted, whenever you're ready.

227
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:13,514
What the hell am l supposed to tell
my people?

228
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,475
Tell them Quad Carbon is finished.
Tell them Octonalis taking us over.

229
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:20,168
Tell them to get their resumes out.

230
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,601
l'm heading for the office.
l'll call you back on a landline.

231
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:58,567
Beatrice, thanks for coming in on Sunday.

232
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,956
Call Ted Fellner.
Tell him l'll be at the office in 20 minutes.

233
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,451
l've got to take the long way around.
Right.

234
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,730
l don't believe this. Fuck!

235
00:17:29,552 --> 00:17:30,413
Shit!

236
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:33,605
My God!

237
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:56,489
No. lt's a telephone! lt's just a telephone.

238
00:17:57,873 --> 00:17:59,782
No. l'm not doing anything!

239
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:06,440
No. l just need my briefcase.

240
00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:09,836
l'm not part of this.

241
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,050
l have some really bad news.

242
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:30,439
You ought to go inside and sit down.
lt's about Peter.

243
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:41,581
This morning there was a roadblock
and these guys in ski masks....

244
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:47,976
They had guns and they took him
with a bunch of other people.

245
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,555
He's been kidnapped.
Do you understand what l'm saying?

246
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:08,976
We got a call from Tecala this morning.

247
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:10,801
You're not sending me there.

248
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:14,096
-l think if you hear me out....
-l just got off the plane, okay?

249
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:16,147
Terry, l need you down there.

250
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,672
l'm just not good at the moment.

251
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,970
l want you to consider this
your first management assignment.

252
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:23,987
The first of many.

253
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:28,464
We all get rattled. lt's not the first time.

254
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,826
That was kind of my point.

255
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:39,501
-Sir.
-Hey, Henry.

256
00:19:41,141 --> 00:19:42,964
l'm on my way to the airport.

257
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,598
l'll call your mom, see if her and Michael
can make it up this weekend.

258
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,881
l'll call her.

259
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:53,299
What time is kickoff on Sunday? 2:00?

260
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:54,923
Yes, sir.

261
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:58,575
l was really looking forward to it.

262
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:07,020
Better get back out there with your mates.

263
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:08,595
Yes, sir.

264
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:50,096
Can l speak now? Because this is wrong.

265
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:51,791
This is so wrong.

266
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:54,414
l'm here to help the people of Tecala.

267
00:20:54,841 --> 00:20:57,012
l'm here to build a dam.

268
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:02,609
No. l don't work on the pipeline.

269
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:07,896
l'm here to build the dam at Chimaya.

270
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:11,890
-For the pipeline.
-Not for the pipeline.

271
00:21:11,961 --> 00:21:14,612
-Yes, for the pipeline.
-Listen to me--

272
00:21:15,897 --> 00:21:17,621
Listen to me. Just listen.

273
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,501
To stop the flooding.
Can you understand that?

274
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,723
Don't you hear me? Didn't you hear me?

275
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:28,307
l don't work for the pipeline!
l'm here to help the people of Tecala.

276
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:31,798
You are a prisoner.

277
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:42,001
Una foto, por favor.

278
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:48,088
That's it.

279
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:01,905
This whole box is just....

280
00:22:04,284 --> 00:22:07,318
We brought some albums with us.
l was gonna...

281
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:11,547
...organize all this,
and l just never got it together.

282
00:22:13,564 --> 00:22:15,157
Oh God, what's that? lt's lndia?

283
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:19,003
Alice, stop now.
We need just one good picture of his face.

284
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:23,932
Sorry.

285
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:28,178
l'm the one who's sorry.
l don't understand my country anymore.

286
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:39,000
No, it was completely random.

287
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:41,301
He was out in the barrio.

288
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:45,587
Anything can happen out there.
They steal your car, your money, whatever.

289
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,091
No, we don't really know a damn thing.

290
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:49,879
Nothing definite at all.

291
00:22:52,382 --> 00:22:53,942
Let me call you back.

292
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:58,076
You're telling him
we don't know what happened?

293
00:22:58,142 --> 00:23:00,084
At this point, we don't know.

294
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,296
He was kidnapped, Jerry.

295
00:23:02,623 --> 00:23:05,470
He was taken at gunpoint in a roadblock.

296
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:08,921
Twenty-five people saw him drive away
in that goddamn truck.

297
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,049
l don't know, maybe it's me,
but that sounds pretty fucking definitive.

298
00:23:13,951 --> 00:23:16,220
Alex, it's your sister-in-law again.

299
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:22,585
Janis, did you get the flight?

300
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:26,228
Welcome back, Mr. Thorne.
How long will you stay this time?

301
00:23:41,344 --> 00:23:43,253
Mr. Peter Bowman.

302
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,165
Let's have a look at you, mate.

303
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:09,342
Janis!

304
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,294
Alice!

305
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:15,803
-Go here. Sandro will get your bag.
-Okay.

306
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:21,879
-Tickets, ma'am.
-Okay. Yeah.

307
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,641
Please don't lose my luggage.

308
00:24:46,082 --> 00:24:49,945
There's a guy waiting from England.
He wants to talk to you about Peter.

309
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:51,805
He says it's important.

310
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:56,799
l was against this, but they insist.

311
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:59,071
Sorry. l hope we did the right thing.

312
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:02,105
-What's Luthan Risk lnternational?
-He's a negotiator.

313
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,020
-Shall l go with you?
-No. l'll take care of it.

314
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:05,887
Hi.

315
00:25:06,883 --> 00:25:09,601
How are you? l'm Peter's sister.
Can we help you?

316
00:25:10,564 --> 00:25:12,451
Terrence Thorne. How do you do?

317
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:15,199
Considering the circumstances,
we're doing all right.

318
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:16,762
How do you do, Mrs. Bowman?

319
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:19,389
l'm with Luthan Risk.
We're an international consultancy--

320
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:21,021
l have one. Your card.

321
00:25:22,436 --> 00:25:25,982
We're based in London. l'm with
our Security and Crisis Response Unit.

322
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:27,609
l'm sorry for appearing like this.

323
00:25:27,684 --> 00:25:30,718
My company is the designated
K and R consultant for Quad Carbon.

324
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:32,512
''K and R.'' What is K and R?

325
00:25:33,189 --> 00:25:34,530
Kidnap and Ransom.

326
00:25:35,173 --> 00:25:38,108
-You just flew in?
-Correct. Last night.

327
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:40,283
Have you spoken to anyone
at Quad Carbon?

328
00:25:40,356 --> 00:25:44,415
London may have. l was just assigned.
All l've seen is an employment dossier.

329
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:47,994
l'd like to get a proper file going.
l've some questions, and so must you.

330
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:49,663
l'll try and explain as much as l can.

331
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:57,346
This is a game.

332
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:00,764
lt's a game youplay,
whether you like it or not.

333
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,052
For you, it's emotional. For thepeople
holding Peter, it's a business.

334
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:08,197
The sooner you get comfortable
and objective about that...

335
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:09,985
...the easier this willbe.

336
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:15,108
People take hostages all over the world.
Sometimes, it's purely terror...

337
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:17,603
...other times it's political,
propaganda purposes.

338
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,038
Down here, it's simply about money.

339
00:26:21,063 --> 00:26:22,241
So...

340
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,576
...where is Peter? Where is he now?

341
00:26:24,774 --> 00:26:28,484
Probably in the mountains.
He's probably been taken by the ELT.

342
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:29,887
Look...

343
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,381
...l just got off a plane.

344
00:26:32,454 --> 00:26:35,237
Can we back up a little bit here, please?

345
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,574
This ELT...

346
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:40,767
...this group, who the hell are they?

347
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,967
And how can you be so sure
they're the ones who have my brother?

348
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:50,783
This is a land reform movement.
These people are revolutionaries.

349
00:26:51,816 --> 00:26:54,434
lnitially, there was a political agenda.

350
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:56,194
However, what you must understand is...

351
00:26:56,264 --> 00:26:57,954
...today's version ofthe EL T...

352
00:26:58,024 --> 00:27:00,545
...is a completely different animal.
Twenty years ago...

353
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:04,228
...they were a struggling Marxist
revolutionary group in the mountains.

354
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:06,238
The end ofthe Cold War
changed everything.

355
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:07,806
The money from Moscow dried up...

356
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,532
...and the ELThad to finda new way
to support itself.

357
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:13,448
So they got into kidnapping,
which has made them millions.

358
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:16,961
Then they realized they were sitting on
an even bigger goldmine.

359
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:20,710
Behind Colombia, Tecala is the world's
largest supplier ofcocaine.

360
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:24,995
The ELThad the weapons andan unlimited
supply ofpoor, illiterate soldiers.

361
00:27:25,481 --> 00:27:29,376
They came in hardand they came in fast,
and they took over the drug trade.

362
00:27:29,545 --> 00:27:31,684
Whatever political agenda
they started with...

363
00:27:31,754 --> 00:27:34,176
...has been completely perverted.

364
00:27:34,473 --> 00:27:36,896
Did you know that when you moved here?

365
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:42,050
Listen. Can we get practical here,
just for a second?

366
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:44,577
Can you just explain how this works,
step by step?

367
00:27:44,906 --> 00:27:48,321
We wait for contact,
they make a demand, we start negotiating.

368
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:50,533
Negotiate? What's to negotiate?

369
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:53,385
Everything. We pay too fast,
pay too much...

370
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:56,392
...make it look too easy,
and instead of getting Peter back...

371
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:59,939
...we'llget a message thanking us
for the down payment andasking for more.

372
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,466
All that we want to do is finda number.

373
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:06,854
A dollar figure that gets Peter back
in onepiece as quickly as possible.

374
00:28:19,852 --> 00:28:20,899
No.

375
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:23,649
Let me clarify something.
This is not about rescues.

376
00:28:23,723 --> 00:28:25,796
This is not about bringing anyone
tojustice.

377
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:27,777
Relying on the police down here
is dangerous.

378
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:30,535
The army is no better.
They're pumped up and trigger-happy.

379
00:28:30,604 --> 00:28:33,953
The last thing we need is heroics,
so we rely on nobody, nobody local.

380
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:36,778
And the embassy?
l'm still waiting for them to call me back.

381
00:28:36,844 --> 00:28:38,731
The US mission down here
at the moment...

382
00:28:38,797 --> 00:28:42,441
...is to try andbreak the ELTand switch
the country's economy from drugs...

383
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:43,817
...topetroleum.

384
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:45,990
Peter does not fit into thoseplans.

385
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,614
The embassy cannot help you
and they know it.

386
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,417
The most you'llget is a sympathetic smile
anda pat on the back.

387
00:28:52,493 --> 00:28:54,249
How long is this gonna take?

388
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:56,101
ln truth, l don't know.

389
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:59,849
You need to settle in for a long haul.
Nothing goes quickly in Tecala.

390
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:02,819
But thepeople holding Peter,
they do know what they're doing.

391
00:29:02,893 --> 00:29:06,276
He's a very valuable commodity,
andit's in their best interest...

392
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,041
...to keep him healthy.

393
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:13,795
Was Peter in the habit of taking off
and not telling you where he would be?

394
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:17,062
No. What are you getting at?

395
00:29:17,454 --> 00:29:18,828
How is his health?

396
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,223
Peter's health has always been fine.

397
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:22,603
-Medication?
-No.

398
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,372
-What about allergies?
-No. Nothing.

399
00:29:27,438 --> 00:29:29,510
He's allergic to chlorine and strawberries.

400
00:29:29,582 --> 00:29:32,484
A blood vessel popped in his eye.
He's been taking drops.

401
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:34,828
And he's very prone to ear infections.

402
00:29:40,174 --> 00:29:43,491
What about emotionally? ls he equipped
to handle this kind of stress?

403
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:45,734
What kind of stress?

404
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:18,663
l don't know, Frank. He doesn't know.
lt could be one week, it could be six.

405
00:30:19,024 --> 00:30:21,707
She's Alice. What can l tell you?
Alice is Alice.

406
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:23,981
She's still out there,
trying to save the world.

407
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:27,311
-l can't tell you what she's feeling.
-Who are you? l mean...

408
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,638
...people who do this,
are you lawyers, foreign service, what?

409
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:34,254
Some law enforcement, some intelligence.
Mostly, it's military.

410
00:30:34,321 --> 00:30:37,223
-Which are you?
-l was a soldier.

411
00:30:38,065 --> 00:30:39,526
What kind of soldier?

412
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:41,451
British army.

413
00:30:42,225 --> 00:30:44,560
-You sound Australian.
-l am.

414
00:30:44,914 --> 00:30:46,670
l was in the regiment at home...

415
00:30:46,738 --> 00:30:50,218
...but we don't get into a lot of action
down there, so l went to England.

416
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:52,428
SAS. Special Air Service.

417
00:30:52,594 --> 00:30:54,961
''Special,'' meaning what? Special Forces?

418
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,745
Right.

419
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:03,372
She is a trip.

420
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:08,081
-Do they get on?
-With Peter? She drives him crazy.

421
00:31:08,754 --> 00:31:12,235
Sometimes l think we've been bouncing
around the world so he can avoid her.

422
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:14,511
l read that in the employment dossier.

423
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:17,895
The ''bouncing around.''

424
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:21,640
He shouldn't have been in that convertible.

425
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:24,879
His stupid goddamn car.

426
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,070
Tell me, what's with all the scorpions?

427
00:31:32,755 --> 00:31:34,828
This house. lt's insane, isn't it?

428
00:31:35,475 --> 00:31:39,731
Some busted drug lord, El Escorpión,
built it for one of his mistresses.

429
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:43,729
Peter called and said he had found
this ridiculous, enormous house...

430
00:31:43,797 --> 00:31:46,764
...that nobody wanted
because it was supposed to be cursed.

431
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:52,266
One of the maids comes every Monday
and sprinkles holy water around.

432
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,504
So maybe it is cursed, all that bad juju.

433
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,316
So, this is your life. This is what you do.

434
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:09,132
Go into people's houses,
tell them how it is.

435
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:10,637
That's part of it.

436
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:13,840
Try to figure out what they're like,
how they'll be and hold up.

437
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:15,982
That's what you're doing, isn't it?

438
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:18,708
Mrs. Bowman, l'm on your side.

439
00:32:20,886 --> 00:32:22,413
So, how am l doing...

440
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:24,748
...you know, for the bereaved spouse?

441
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:27,563
Your husband isn't dead. He's alive.

442
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,541
And l will do everything l can
to make sure he gets home safe.

443
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:34,159
This won't work if you bullshit me.

444
00:32:34,774 --> 00:32:36,019
l can see that.

445
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,873
So we'll be straight up, then?

446
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:40,246
That's exactly how we'll do it.

447
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:44,853
Sorry.

448
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:48,625
God, you'd think l'd been gone for a month.

449
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,588
Would you like some wine?

450
00:32:50,775 --> 00:32:52,051
You know l don't drink.

451
00:32:52,727 --> 00:32:54,068
So, where were we?

452
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:19,796
l like this!

453
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:33,741
He's loco.

454
00:33:34,937 --> 00:33:37,457
Don't be afraid, we're not gonna kill you.

455
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,992
The competition arrives.

456
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:14,231
Hello, mate.

457
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:17,206
l heard an ugly rumor
you were around somewhere.

458
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:20,209
l thought you'd gone all civilized
and unsocial on us.

459
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:22,294
What's this? A face-lift?

460
00:34:22,586 --> 00:34:25,173
Yeah, l'm doing one side at a time.
You good?

461
00:34:25,627 --> 00:34:27,601
He looks like shit, but he's working.

462
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:29,049
What are you celebrating?

463
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:31,985
Life, liberty, and the ability
to purchase clitoris.

464
00:34:32,252 --> 00:34:33,179
Jesus!

465
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:35,226
Thank God you're here, Terry.

466
00:34:35,611 --> 00:34:39,954
Because the quality of conversation
has been just ''bloody appalling.''

467
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:43,189
Where was it?

468
00:34:43,643 --> 00:34:45,531
Someone said you were in Turkey?

469
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:47,636
Not Turkey, Chechnya.

470
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:51,226
-With the Frenchman, Lenoir.
-Keeping updated?

471
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:55,413
My guys turned that one down.
lt's a job Wyatt's outfit would take.

472
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:57,904
Thought you were retiring.

473
00:34:57,979 --> 00:35:02,900
Yes, l was,
but lnherent Risk rang me with a sob story.

474
00:35:03,964 --> 00:35:06,550
Could l, please? ''Old time's sake?''

475
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:08,891
What are you doing?

476
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:12,026
l'm working on the biggest thing
down here.

477
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,519
He's doing the ltalian.

478
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:16,790
Calitri. Banker.

479
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:20,155
-Very pleased with himself.
-l can tell.

480
00:35:21,277 --> 00:35:24,505
And lan has you off
in fucking Chechnya alone.

481
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:28,724
That's why l left. Luthan Risk doesn't give
a shit about you, and you know it.

482
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:31,227
Your cops still on the payroll?

483
00:35:31,294 --> 00:35:34,326
-Better than ever. Judges, too.
-Will you run some names for me?

484
00:35:34,397 --> 00:35:36,569
That top one is this client's driver.

485
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:41,020
-Shouldn't be a problem, for a hefty price.
-Will we ever get a drink?

486
00:35:41,086 --> 00:35:43,093
l think somebody's kidnapped the barman.

487
00:35:43,165 --> 00:35:44,726
That's all right, mate.

488
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:45,974
My shout.

489
00:35:47,326 --> 00:35:49,465
Bloody hell! That's just like mine.

490
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,640
lt is yours.

491
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:53,403
lt is mine.

492
00:35:55,998 --> 00:35:57,940
Hey, old mate. lt's good to see you.

493
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:04,796
Alice, l can't tell you how shocked l am
something like this could happen.

494
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,772
Did you get my wire? How are you doing?

495
00:36:06,847 --> 00:36:09,597
-Janis Goodman. Peter's sister.
-Ted Fellner. Peter's boss.

496
00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:12,151
-Nice to meet you.
-Let's step into my office.

497
00:36:12,415 --> 00:36:15,197
l was in Houston, got this phone call.
l couldn't believe it.

498
00:36:15,263 --> 00:36:17,947
l flew back here last night.
We've got everybody working...

499
00:36:18,016 --> 00:36:21,529
...trying to access the information we need
to make some informed decisions.

500
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,699
Make them quick. The right decisions.
Please sit down.

501
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,418
Would you like some coffee or tea?

502
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:29,755
No, l think we're fine.

503
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,615
Where's Mr. Thorne?

504
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,354
The guy from Luthan Risk.

505
00:36:39,424 --> 00:36:40,602
Right.

506
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,542
There's been a change in plans.

507
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,494
What kind of change?

508
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:50,105
We think it's best for all of us,
under the circumstances...

509
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:52,151
...to go with a local representative.

510
00:36:52,224 --> 00:36:55,837
-You don't want to use Luthan Risk?
-What circumstances?

511
00:36:58,305 --> 00:36:59,767
There's no insurance.

512
00:37:01,698 --> 00:37:05,757
None of us, no one at Quad Carbon,
has been insured for kidnapping since July.

513
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:10,368
Some idiot was trying to cut costs
and didn't realize what they were doing.

514
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:14,271
Alice, honey, please.

515
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:17,083
This could be any one of us.

516
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:20,922
We're doing our best. We're talking
to Octonal, trying to get their input.

517
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:24,028
We're hoping they'll step up and cover this,
but at this point--

518
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:25,757
Don't they have to?

519
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:29,121
Their position is, they're buying a pipeline,
not the company.

520
00:37:29,474 --> 00:37:31,743
-lt's a bit complicated.
-Their ''position''?

521
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:35,098
How do they already have a position?
This just happened!

522
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:38,911
Could you just tell me
where Quad Carbon stands in all of this?

523
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,054
Quad Carbon is evaporating.

524
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:46,109
They're selling off what they can.
Just a little late for miracles.

525
00:37:49,443 --> 00:37:51,298
So you're all out of work?

526
00:37:52,195 --> 00:37:53,756
lt would seem so.

527
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:00,126
Who's this?

528
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:02,593
This is Arturo Fernandez.

529
00:38:02,788 --> 00:38:03,835
Señora Bowman.

530
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:07,356
Mr. Fernandez has been
our local security coordinator for years.

531
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:09,729
He's very well connected
and very experienced.

532
00:38:09,795 --> 00:38:12,382
lf you give us a few minutes you'll realize...

533
00:38:12,453 --> 00:38:15,235
...just how lucky we are
to have him working with us.

534
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:36,990
Mr. Thorne, you're leaving so soon.

535
00:38:37,477 --> 00:38:39,615
Perhaps next time we can go dancing.

536
00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:41,595
Boy, did you have me fooled.

537
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:46,272
-l was just about to call you.
-Where, from the plane?

538
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:51,297
You stood in my house and you told me
that l didn't have to worry anymore.

539
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:54,141
We thought Quad Carbon was still a client.

540
00:38:54,213 --> 00:38:56,188
What about us? We can't be the client?

541
00:38:56,262 --> 00:38:58,979
l really am sorry.
lt's not a good situation for us either.

542
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:00,126
''Us''?

543
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:01,662
You.

544
00:39:01,894 --> 00:39:06,269
You stood in my kitchen and you told me
my husband was coming home.

545
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,761
Quad Carbon is out of business, okay?

546
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,057
Octonal spends $40 million a year
on K and R insurance in the world.

547
00:39:13,127 --> 00:39:15,396
My company has 30 percent
of that package.

548
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:19,042
-Octonal does not like conflict.
-Peter doesn't work for Octonal.

549
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:22,973
That's the point and the way they want it.
No Quad Carbon confusion.

550
00:39:24,743 --> 00:39:26,630
l'm not even supposed to talk to you.

551
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:29,761
-So, this is you being brave?
-No, this is me doing my job.

552
00:39:29,864 --> 00:39:33,638
lt's good l came by then, right?
Let you get that off your chest.

553
00:39:33,735 --> 00:39:35,361
l'm sure it'll all work out.

554
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:37,981
You know they're giving us
some local security guy?

555
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:40,325
Exactly the kind of guy
you warned me about.

556
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:41,985
What can l say? l don't make policy.

557
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:45,023
Great. So when this is over
and my husband is dead...

558
00:39:45,128 --> 00:39:47,812
...and l'm suing these bastards,
you can tell the judge...

559
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,630
...you did everything you could
to help me out?

560
00:39:51,945 --> 00:39:53,374
Wait a minute. Wait!

561
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:59,784
Listen to me, l'm sorry.
l apologize. l'm sorry!

562
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:02,501
l'm sorry to be like this...

563
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:03,746
...but...

564
00:40:04,105 --> 00:40:05,447
...you are...

565
00:40:05,642 --> 00:40:08,708
...the first, you are the only person...

566
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,972
...l've met who knows
what they're talking about.

567
00:40:12,266 --> 00:40:16,063
So, l'm begging you, l am totally
begging you to help me out on this.

568
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:18,273
You asked me not to bullshit you, right?

569
00:40:18,665 --> 00:40:19,593
Right.

570
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:21,569
l got a plane to catch.

571
00:41:31,052 --> 00:41:34,347
Alice, l'm sorry.
We just had a call about Peter.

572
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,548
They said to look in our car
for a cell phone. This was there.

573
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:39,914
They are calling back to this phone
in 20 minutes.

574
00:41:39,982 --> 00:41:41,094
God, Alice...

575
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,888
...they have our phone number.

576
00:41:43,054 --> 00:41:44,134
My God.

577
00:42:00,622 --> 00:42:01,800
Peter is alive.

578
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:05,033
He's definitely being held
by El Ejército de Liberación de Tecala.

579
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:08,298
He's in good health,
but he's a prisoner of war.

580
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:11,148
-They want $5 million for his release.
-Oh, my God.

581
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:14,344
Obviously, this is negotiable.

582
00:42:14,543 --> 00:42:16,746
They always start with a big number.

583
00:42:17,423 --> 00:42:21,352
He says that in order to make it better
for Peter's care and food...

584
00:42:21,423 --> 00:42:25,449
...and to prove to us that he's alive,
they want to get a first transfer...

585
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:29,932
...as a gesture of good faith.
As soon as possible.

586
00:42:30,543 --> 00:42:32,202
First transfer being what?

587
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:34,440
1 .5 billion pesos.

588
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,162
-Jesus!
-lt's only $50,000.

589
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:39,501
Can l talk to him?

590
00:42:40,623 --> 00:42:42,150
No, l don't think so.

591
00:42:42,287 --> 00:42:45,070
This guy is going to make one last contact.

592
00:42:45,391 --> 00:42:47,813
He will let us know where to go for this.

593
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,870
But, ladies...

594
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,317
...the important thing is that Peter is alive.

595
00:42:57,968 --> 00:42:59,659
This is very positive.

596
00:43:00,016 --> 00:43:01,260
lt's very fast.

597
00:43:01,585 --> 00:43:03,919
A case like this? Very fast.

598
00:43:04,176 --> 00:43:06,598
-Honest.
-Could you excuse us for a minute, please?

599
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:07,501
Sure.

600
00:43:07,569 --> 00:43:08,583
Thank you.

601
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:16,936
l am not trusting that man with $50,000.

602
00:43:17,073 --> 00:43:20,422
-What is the alternative?
-You feel good about this? About him?

603
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:24,141
This whole thing feels thrown together.
lt feels out of control.

604
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,998
There's more than one person
who does this.

605
00:43:26,065 --> 00:43:28,171
You've been calling for two days
and nothing!

606
00:43:28,242 --> 00:43:30,381
l want to wait for the guy in Miami.

607
00:43:30,545 --> 00:43:34,571
How long, five days, two weeks? You want
to comparison-shop? Peter is alive now!

608
00:43:34,674 --> 00:43:37,227
Peter is my little brother.

609
00:43:40,274 --> 00:43:42,412
l'm trying to be smart about this.

610
00:43:42,642 --> 00:43:45,064
l've never done this before.

611
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:46,858
l know. l'm just....

612
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,300
l know.

613
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:50,479
l know.

614
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,464
Ask him where he thinks l'll go?

615
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,801
Ask him how long l have to be here.

616
00:44:28,308 --> 00:44:29,617
What did he say?

617
00:44:30,036 --> 00:44:32,883
Never mind. lt's okay.

618
00:44:41,588 --> 00:44:44,337
Lord Lucan is actually living in the Ukraine.

619
00:44:45,909 --> 00:44:47,185
ln a sanatorium.

620
00:44:47,733 --> 00:44:49,227
Terry.

621
00:44:49,301 --> 00:44:51,603
-Welcome back.
-Hello, Terry.

622
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,078
Pleasure seeing you again.

623
00:44:58,421 --> 00:45:01,421
Round at Westminster
and back down to Greenwich, please.

624
00:45:04,277 --> 00:45:06,186
l'll have two of these, please.

625
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,637
Here's to dodging bullets.

626
00:45:17,462 --> 00:45:21,106
We almost lost a $12 million contract
over this Quad Carbon fiasco.

627
00:45:21,174 --> 00:45:23,857
Octonal got quite put off
by the whole adventure.

628
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,812
l'm sure you did, as well.

629
00:45:26,678 --> 00:45:28,107
Quite right, too.

630
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:31,570
l'll make it up to you, Terry, l will.

631
00:45:33,303 --> 00:45:35,158
So, what happens to these people?

632
00:45:35,223 --> 00:45:36,172
Who?

633
00:45:36,759 --> 00:45:38,701
The Bowmans.
What happens to them now?

634
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:41,263
Come on. They'll find a way through.

635
00:45:41,462 --> 00:45:46,002
We've got half a dozen firms on our backs.
Believe me, somebody wants this case.

636
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:47,508
Okay. Who?

637
00:45:47,799 --> 00:45:51,411
Name a company that doesn't have
Octonal business that you'd trust.

638
00:45:52,055 --> 00:45:53,779
Trust with your own family.

639
00:45:53,943 --> 00:45:55,372
They'll be fine!

640
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:02,356
Look...

641
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,069
...l got a trip to Bangkok.
Two or three days at the most.

642
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:09,431
Strictly management assignment.
Wave the flag. Talk to a few people.

643
00:46:09,497 --> 00:46:13,009
After that, l thought you might want
a trip to the beach at Phuket.

644
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:30,584
lf you're handling the twenties, it's fifty.

645
00:47:30,651 --> 00:47:34,448
-And if you're handling fifties--
-l know.

646
00:47:34,972 --> 00:47:36,084
Don't!

647
00:47:46,524 --> 00:47:47,866
Damn it!

648
00:47:49,628 --> 00:47:53,043
-Shit! This is ridiculous!
-Janis.

649
00:47:57,629 --> 00:48:00,411
-Hold on. How many did you have?
-l had 50.

650
00:48:00,573 --> 00:48:03,060
Why does everyone keep asking
how much money l have?

651
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:04,508
Please, Mr. Fernandez.

652
00:48:04,573 --> 00:48:06,296
Come on, Janis. Calm down.

653
00:48:09,406 --> 00:48:10,812
Are you expecting someone?

654
00:48:10,876 --> 00:48:11,825
No.

655
00:48:14,781 --> 00:48:16,025
Watch out!

656
00:48:16,285 --> 00:48:18,008
This guy is so....

657
00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:19,702
Maybe it's Elio.

658
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:26,453
-Whoever it is, out!
-Please, let me handle it.

659
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:40,920
What are you doing here?

660
00:48:41,662 --> 00:48:43,190
l wanted to apologize.

661
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,292
l thought you did that already.

662
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,238
My God, it's you!

663
00:48:50,015 --> 00:48:51,903
-Hello, Janis.
-What do you want?

664
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,837
l wanted to tell you l'm sorry
about the way things went.

665
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:56,766
Great, it's just that...

666
00:48:56,991 --> 00:48:58,715
...we're in the middle of something.

667
00:48:58,783 --> 00:49:01,783
l understand your reluctance,
but l want to offer you my services.

668
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,481
Haven't we done this already?

669
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:06,301
-l thought your hands were tied.
-They were.

670
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,697
What about your company?

671
00:49:11,007 --> 00:49:12,633
l'd be doing this alone.

672
00:49:16,576 --> 00:49:18,714
Señora, please!

673
00:49:27,232 --> 00:49:30,167
-What's all this?
-We're putting together a payment.

674
00:49:30,912 --> 00:49:33,978
-What kind of payment?
-For Peter. A good faith payment.

675
00:49:34,048 --> 00:49:36,666
-Good faith?
-We're getting a proof of life.

676
00:49:36,897 --> 00:49:38,806
Who put this together?

677
00:49:38,881 --> 00:49:41,467
How are you doing? l'm Terry Thorne.

678
00:49:46,114 --> 00:49:47,291
What do you have here?

679
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:51,006
We got one, two, three guys with guns.
A shitload of money.

680
00:49:51,073 --> 00:49:53,244
Holy snapping assholes, look at this!

681
00:49:56,834 --> 00:49:58,841
Tell them to put those guns down!

682
00:49:59,138 --> 00:50:00,447
All right!

683
00:50:04,898 --> 00:50:08,346
l asked you not to come in.
Maybe these ladies don't understand.

684
00:50:08,418 --> 00:50:09,824
But you understand!

685
00:50:10,146 --> 00:50:13,376
-l get this.
-You want to talk, come back later!

686
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:17,149
-Like when the money is gone?
-There you go.

687
00:50:19,011 --> 00:50:21,182
Okay. All right.

688
00:50:21,635 --> 00:50:23,162
That's what l'm doing.

689
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:26,431
l do this for a living. l do this all the time.

690
00:50:26,594 --> 00:50:28,188
This is my job, you know?

691
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:30,593
You never buy a proof of life.

692
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:33,212
Bullshit! You don't know
what you're talking about.

693
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:37,593
You never pack money in your client's
house unless it's a fucking emergency.

694
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,831
And you don't wave guns around people
you're trying to help.

695
00:50:41,475 --> 00:50:42,905
Don't do that!

696
00:50:43,716 --> 00:50:46,683
Put your gun down
or l'll blow your head off.

697
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:47,770
Now!

698
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,096
Just calm down.

699
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:52,120
Do it!

700
00:50:53,796 --> 00:50:55,072
There you go.

701
00:50:55,364 --> 00:50:57,437
What are you gonna do now, asshole?

702
00:50:58,373 --> 00:50:59,300
Alice.

703
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,635
Ask him to leave.

704
00:51:02,724 --> 00:51:03,837
What?

705
00:51:04,004 --> 00:51:07,233
Thank them very much for their help
and ask them to leave.

706
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:09,826
Me? You are telling me?

707
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,962
You're taking the case?

708
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:14,623
-Yes.
-Enough with this. Leave, now.

709
00:51:18,853 --> 00:51:20,446
Mr. Fernandez...

710
00:51:21,797 --> 00:51:23,324
...l'd like you to go.

711
00:51:24,837 --> 00:51:27,652
-You heard Mrs. Bowman.
-l'm not going anywhere, pal.

712
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,627
You are. Now!

713
00:51:32,645 --> 00:51:34,271
Can l make a suggestion?

714
00:51:34,437 --> 00:51:36,096
Can hardly wait, can l?

715
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:41,471
l think you should calm down,
then look over there and meet my friend.

716
00:51:45,317 --> 00:51:46,725
Arturo.

717
00:51:48,935 --> 00:51:52,034
-Down. Put the fucking thing down.
-l thought you'd gone legit.

718
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:52,996
Dino.

719
00:51:53,382 --> 00:51:54,244
Yeah.

720
00:51:54,407 --> 00:51:55,585
Let's go.

721
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:57,083
All right, you too. Right now!

722
00:52:02,759 --> 00:52:04,035
Okay.

723
00:52:04,295 --> 00:52:06,117
Let's get this all cleaned up.

724
00:52:32,808 --> 00:52:35,111
When are you guys
gonna put those things away?

725
00:52:35,177 --> 00:52:36,933
Have a cigarette, it might help.

726
00:52:39,464 --> 00:52:41,832
Sandro's going around again.
Eliodoro is ready now.

727
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:43,653
We are the talk of the town.

728
00:52:43,721 --> 00:52:45,925
-ls it complimentary?
-You'd be flattered.

729
00:52:45,993 --> 00:52:48,294
-Where's Mrs. Bowman?
-Check the kitchen.

730
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,592
-Hey.
-Yeah?

731
00:52:50,825 --> 00:52:52,003
That was fun?

732
00:52:52,105 --> 00:52:53,120
Yeah.

733
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:00,104
Mrs. Bowman?

734
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,177
Alice?

735
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:25,699
Dino and Sandro
are taking the dummy bags into town.

736
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,199
Make it look good.

737
00:53:27,786 --> 00:53:29,445
We'll keep the cash here.

738
00:53:30,634 --> 00:53:34,464
l need to know, was there any kind
of plan? Was there a contact schedule?

739
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:36,865
No.

740
00:53:38,155 --> 00:53:40,358
We're just waiting for another call.

741
00:53:42,187 --> 00:53:45,002
l haven't cried since this started.
lt's just....

742
00:53:45,387 --> 00:53:46,849
Hey, it's okay.

743
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:49,345
lt's just the tension. Finally, it just....

744
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,914
lt's okay.

745
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,268
Why are you doing this?

746
00:54:10,573 --> 00:54:12,841
Nobody was going to take your case.

747
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:15,334
Nobody any good, anyway.

748
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,610
l know.

749
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:21,798
But you came back.

750
00:54:24,205 --> 00:54:26,114
We have to do this my way, right?

751
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:28,556
We'll do it together,
but you've just got to....

752
00:54:28,876 --> 00:54:29,475
Even if it gets tough.

753
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,924
You have to learn to trust me.

754
00:54:59,727 --> 00:55:01,352
-'Morning.
-How are you?

755
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:05,419
We've been listening to this all night.

756
00:55:05,518 --> 00:55:06,859
Estúpido is right.

757
00:55:07,759 --> 00:55:09,220
So, what are you doing here?

758
00:55:09,295 --> 00:55:12,873
-Linda, you're smart, a good person.
-l have no family.

759
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:14,694
This is not your family.

760
00:55:14,766 --> 00:55:16,108
They are my family.

761
00:55:16,175 --> 00:55:18,062
-Let me be your family.
-No.

762
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,120
-They are my family.
-They're not your family.

763
00:55:22,543 --> 00:55:23,819
Linda.

764
00:55:23,951 --> 00:55:25,325
Please.

765
00:55:26,512 --> 00:55:27,918
Just help me.

766
00:55:29,615 --> 00:55:31,077
You can do it.

767
00:55:31,631 --> 00:55:32,809
Help me.

768
00:56:06,993 --> 00:56:09,033
-Who answered the phone?
-Maria.

769
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:10,736
l was in the shower.

770
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,932
-Janis stayed in case there are more calls.
-Where did they hide it?

771
00:56:14,001 --> 00:56:17,165
Look for the Jesus with the purple robe.
Under the altar cloth.

772
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,903
-Did you get it?
-lt's good.

773
00:56:58,067 --> 00:57:01,930
We got radio frequencies, times to call.
We're on for Wednesdays and Sundays.

774
00:58:25,622 --> 00:58:28,274
l'd like five minutes alone with you,
without your gun.

775
00:58:28,343 --> 00:58:32,085
l'd take your whole fucking world apart
without breaking a sweat. Comprende?

776
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:36,207
l want my shirt, l want my spoon.

777
00:58:45,848 --> 00:58:48,368
Aim that fucking thing at me
one more time....

778
00:58:49,207 --> 00:58:50,899
Show me how fucking big you are!

779
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:55,151
l'll make you eat that goddamn rifle!

780
01:00:10,075 --> 01:00:12,465
-He wants the family.
-Tell him to forget it.

781
01:00:12,539 --> 01:00:14,961
We represent the family. Just do it.

782
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:16,144
Do it.

783
01:00:21,115 --> 01:00:25,905
Put his wife on the radio right now,
or we forget the whole fucking thing!

784
01:00:27,388 --> 01:00:28,565
Who is this?

785
01:00:28,828 --> 01:00:33,335
l saidl want to speak with the wife.
Who is this?

786
01:00:33,628 --> 01:00:35,898
You can call me Tio. What's your name?

787
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:39,705
Callme Marco.

788
01:00:41,757 --> 01:00:43,415
You're not making all the rules here.

789
01:00:43,485 --> 01:00:45,046
We wanna work with you.

790
01:00:45,117 --> 01:00:47,418
We want a proof of life
and we're not paying for it.

791
01:00:47,484 --> 01:00:50,167
lf there's any good faith,
it can start with that.

792
01:00:50,236 --> 01:00:51,928
Okay, Uncle Tio.

793
01:00:51,997 --> 01:00:53,819
So you are the one in charge now?

794
01:00:53,885 --> 01:00:54,485
That's right.

795
01:00:54,557 --> 01:00:55,485
Good.

796
01:00:55,549 --> 01:00:58,779
Then you willbe responsible
for the death ofPeter Bowman.

797
01:00:59,069 --> 01:01:00,443
Do you understandme?

798
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:01,939
You are responsible!

799
01:01:03,517 --> 01:01:04,978
-He's gone?
-Yeah.

800
01:01:05,373 --> 01:01:08,308
lt's all right, just get used to it.
lt's the way it's done.

801
01:01:36,702 --> 01:01:38,012
Goddamn it.

802
01:01:52,735 --> 01:01:54,197
l've never seen you smoke.

803
01:01:54,271 --> 01:01:56,028
l smoke when l play cards.

804
01:01:57,215 --> 01:01:59,255
ls that supposed to be reassuring?

805
01:02:00,351 --> 01:02:01,846
This is how it goes.

806
01:02:02,112 --> 01:02:03,039
Okay?

807
01:02:03,104 --> 01:02:05,559
They've come to us.
We've established radio contact.

808
01:02:05,632 --> 01:02:07,225
This is all positive.

809
01:02:08,096 --> 01:02:09,525
Who do you care about?

810
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,666
l told you you'd have to trust me,
and you said you could.

811
01:02:15,072 --> 01:02:17,276
Dino says you have a 13-year-old son.

812
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:21,405
Yeah. Surprised?

813
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:23,419
What if it was him?

814
01:02:23,681 --> 01:02:26,136
What if it was your son
up there in the mountains?

815
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:30,170
l would find somebody that l could trust
and l would do what they told me.

816
01:02:37,665 --> 01:02:39,356
So, what's your son like?

817
01:02:40,962 --> 01:02:42,140
He's quiet.

818
01:02:42,689 --> 01:02:44,282
Smart, you know.

819
01:02:45,602 --> 01:02:47,358
Seems to make good friends.

820
01:02:48,066 --> 01:02:49,440
Good rugby player.

821
01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:52,285
You know, l see him all done up...

822
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:55,670
...and l think, God, he's just at the end
of being a boy, and...

823
01:02:57,122 --> 01:02:58,584
...l missed it.

824
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,952
Just haven't been there for him.

825
01:03:02,978 --> 01:03:04,539
You know, truthfully...

826
01:03:05,186 --> 01:03:07,128
...we really don't know each other.

827
01:03:07,202 --> 01:03:10,049
When he talks to me
it's like he's on a parade ground.

828
01:03:10,755 --> 01:03:12,697
So he's a soldier like his dad.

829
01:03:13,955 --> 01:03:16,673
No. He wants to be a pilot
and get all the girls.

830
01:03:19,043 --> 01:03:20,287
And his mother?

831
01:03:20,899 --> 01:03:22,558
Now, there's the soldier.

832
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:24,669
l guess she'd have to be.

833
01:03:25,539 --> 01:03:28,921
Do you know how an English
general's daughter gets back at Daddy?

834
01:03:30,147 --> 01:03:31,773
She marries an Australian.

835
01:03:35,076 --> 01:03:36,505
You never remarried?

836
01:03:37,411 --> 01:03:40,129
l took up the veil, you know? This job.

837
01:03:40,196 --> 01:03:42,781
You gotta have rhythm,
you start moving, and...

838
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,515
...it just takes over.

839
01:04:12,261 --> 01:04:13,210
Name.

840
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:14,594
Peter Bowman.

841
01:04:20,966 --> 01:04:22,013
Come.

842
01:04:32,774 --> 01:04:34,236
You stay here.

843
01:04:56,167 --> 01:04:57,149
What?

844
01:04:58,631 --> 01:04:59,646
Quiet! Whisper!

845
01:05:01,726 --> 01:05:03,581
You came today from the mountains?

846
01:05:03,646 --> 01:05:05,402
l'm Kessler. Erich Kessler.

847
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:10,612
Peter Bowman.

848
01:05:11,934 --> 01:05:14,586
You know my name? l'm a missionary.

849
01:05:15,486 --> 01:05:17,013
You know something...

850
01:05:17,087 --> 01:05:20,218
...perhaps, about my situation?
Some news?

851
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:24,060
No, l don't know.

852
01:05:24,927 --> 01:05:26,683
Are you a hostage, too?

853
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:31,198
There's an ltalian.

854
01:05:31,296 --> 01:05:34,362
Up the hill, at the farmhouse.
He came a week ago.

855
01:05:35,072 --> 01:05:36,414
ls he your friend?

856
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:40,030
No, l was brought here alone.

857
01:05:41,151 --> 01:05:43,191
What kind of camp is this?

858
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:47,129
Once it was only for drugs...

859
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:49,502
...to make cocaine at the river.

860
01:05:50,464 --> 01:05:52,057
But now from the fighting...

861
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,126
...it's all for soldiers.

862
01:05:56,001 --> 01:05:57,724
How long have you been here?

863
01:06:02,528 --> 01:06:04,284
You need soap for your feet?

864
01:06:04,512 --> 01:06:06,585
Maybe tomorrow, l can steal some.

865
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,396
How long have you been here?

866
01:06:13,121 --> 01:06:14,463
Nineteen months.

867
01:06:16,545 --> 01:06:18,138
They think l'm crazy.

868
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:34,270
Dover.

869
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,698
-Terry, l'm sorry.
-This is Alice Bowman.

870
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:38,875
Janis Goodman, Dover McLoon,
consulate officer.

871
01:06:38,946 --> 01:06:41,663
l know we scheduled to meet today,
but something's come up.

872
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:45,080
-We've been waiting for an hour and a half.
-l know that.

873
01:06:45,346 --> 01:06:47,735
l really want to hear about your progress.

874
01:06:47,874 --> 01:06:49,697
l'm sympathetic, we all are, but...

875
01:06:49,763 --> 01:06:52,065
-...we've got a situation.
-What kind of situation?

876
01:06:52,131 --> 01:06:54,520
l really just think we have to reschedule.

877
01:06:55,171 --> 01:06:56,480
He's sympathetic.

878
01:06:56,931 --> 01:06:58,753
What the hell does that mean?

879
01:07:00,419 --> 01:07:02,875
The ELT just let off three car bombs
around the city.

880
01:07:02,948 --> 01:07:06,395
They've threatened the embassy.
lt's a mess. l gotta go issue a statement.

881
01:07:06,467 --> 01:07:08,572
-That's okay, you stay safe.
-Thanks.

882
01:07:11,971 --> 01:07:14,393
We need to clear out.
They've had a bomb threat.

883
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:29,884
-What's happening?
-Get in the car!

884
01:07:32,357 --> 01:07:33,284
What's this?

885
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:35,389
-ls it from them?
-Don't open that.

886
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:37,915
-lt's from them, isn't it?
-Open it!

887
01:07:37,988 --> 01:07:40,672
Put your seat belts on,
we're going to the hotel.

888
01:07:41,412 --> 01:07:43,452
-Just open it.
-Not here.

889
01:07:45,253 --> 01:07:49,245
Okay, how about a nice big smile,
you skinny motherfucker.

890
01:07:54,181 --> 01:07:55,129
Shit!

891
01:07:57,637 --> 01:07:59,065
Close the door.

892
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:00,863
Take a seat.

893
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:03,362
Just open it. Please, just open it.

894
01:08:03,493 --> 01:08:05,566
Come on. ls it a proof of life or not?

895
01:08:05,638 --> 01:08:07,612
Give me a minute and take a seat.

896
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:21,819
lt is.

897
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,224
lt's a proof of life, isn't it?

898
01:08:24,295 --> 01:08:27,229
Usually, l do this by myself, okay?
Just wait a minute.

899
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:30,175
There's things here
that they want us to see.

900
01:08:37,575 --> 01:08:39,746
You never get a pretty picture, okay?

901
01:08:48,935 --> 01:08:50,342
His feet.

902
01:08:52,072 --> 01:08:53,665
He looks terrible.

903
01:08:54,408 --> 01:08:56,382
What happened to his feet?

904
01:08:57,736 --> 01:08:58,947
You said...

905
01:08:59,304 --> 01:09:01,213
...that they knew he was valuable.

906
01:09:01,288 --> 01:09:03,492
That they would take care of him.

907
01:09:05,352 --> 01:09:06,847
What are you doing?

908
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,309
This is it, right?
The one he's holding in the picture?

909
01:09:13,384 --> 01:09:16,646
-What, do you save all the papers?
-This is good news, okay?

910
01:09:16,713 --> 01:09:18,567
l mean, this is good luck.

911
01:09:18,665 --> 01:09:21,054
lt's what we've been waiting for.
We're in play.

912
01:09:21,129 --> 01:09:23,812
All we have to do now
is start talking specifics.

913
01:09:24,586 --> 01:09:25,568
Money.

914
01:09:26,153 --> 01:09:28,903
l need to know exactly how much
l've got to work with.

915
01:09:28,969 --> 01:09:32,352
You'll have to get back to Denver
and start putting this cash together.

916
01:09:32,425 --> 01:09:34,335
We're gonna shoot for $600,000.

917
01:09:34,505 --> 01:09:36,512
l'm hoping that's where we land.

918
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,812
Thank you.

919
01:10:25,131 --> 01:10:26,920
Don't be a fool! Stop it!

920
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,220
Calm down!

921
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:31,105
lt's nothing!

922
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:33,737
You see up there...

923
01:10:34,124 --> 01:10:35,368
...the farmhouse?

924
01:10:35,756 --> 01:10:37,927
That's where they've got the ltalian.

925
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:41,832
On the other side, down the valley...

926
01:10:42,189 --> 01:10:44,076
...that is where they make cocaine.

927
01:10:47,724 --> 01:10:50,856
When you get home,
you'll want to talk about this. lt's normal.

928
01:10:50,925 --> 01:10:52,997
l know. lt's not restaurant conversation.

929
01:10:53,069 --> 01:10:55,687
lt's not for my friends,
it's not even for my kids.

930
01:10:55,757 --> 01:10:56,902
-Right.
-Right.

931
01:10:56,973 --> 01:10:59,908
Turn that scramble phone on,
test it out straight away.

932
01:10:59,982 --> 01:11:02,829
lf it doesn't work,
l'll come up with something else.

933
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:04,940
You're doing great.

934
01:11:13,646 --> 01:11:14,987
Thank you.

935
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:19,398
lt's not every soccer mom
who gets her own encrypted phone, right?

936
01:11:22,797 --> 01:11:24,227
lt's a lot of money.

937
01:11:24,942 --> 01:11:26,982
$600,000.

938
01:11:28,046 --> 01:11:29,606
He's not even sure.

939
01:11:29,774 --> 01:11:30,854
l know.

940
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:36,329
l know you've got the kids,
tuition, your mortgage.

941
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:38,919
l know all of it is impossible to ask.

942
01:11:39,599 --> 01:11:41,803
But you're our only chance.

943
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:44,741
What if it's more?

944
01:11:47,151 --> 01:11:48,776
l don't know.

945
01:11:49,647 --> 01:11:54,469
But l swear, if it takes every day,
for the rest of my life, l will pay you back.

946
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:55,591
l will.

947
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,760
l'm sorry if l've been....

948
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:04,462
lt's just that l'm trying to get through this,
trying to be...

949
01:12:06,063 --> 01:12:07,209
...strong.

950
01:12:09,744 --> 01:12:11,304
He's lucky to have you.

951
01:12:28,529 --> 01:12:29,837
Don't worry.

952
01:13:12,787 --> 01:13:14,412
-What's that?
-The alarm.

953
01:13:15,955 --> 01:13:17,264
When they ring the bell...

954
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:20,397
-...the army is crossing the river on a raid.
-Where are they going?

955
01:13:20,467 --> 01:13:22,539
To protect their cocaine factories.

956
01:13:22,676 --> 01:13:24,082
lt's becoming a war.

957
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:51,761
-What is it?
-Nothing.

958
01:13:59,348 --> 01:14:00,494
What was that?

959
01:14:00,565 --> 01:14:03,860
ELT sending a message.
lt's got nothing to do with us. Let's go.

960
01:14:03,925 --> 01:14:07,339
$3 million is theprice for Peter Bowman.

961
01:14:07,508 --> 01:14:09,232
That's a ridiculous figure.

962
01:14:09,397 --> 01:14:13,194
This is not a businessman.
He's an engineer, here to construct a dam.

963
01:14:13,301 --> 01:14:15,821
You're gonna have to come down
from $3 million.

964
01:14:15,892 --> 01:14:18,763
Like this is a game.
We are saying concrete things...

965
01:14:18,837 --> 01:14:22,318
...and you are having us
suck cock with this bullshit.

966
01:14:25,845 --> 01:14:27,187
At $400,000...

967
01:14:27,253 --> 01:14:28,714
...you're already over my limit.

968
01:14:29,781 --> 01:14:33,077
So, what you need to do
is take that offer back and see if....

969
01:14:33,174 --> 01:14:36,686
-What the hell are they bringing back?
-lt's a French helicopter.

970
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,298
How would you know that?

971
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:45,038
What the hell is that?

972
01:14:55,831 --> 01:14:59,825
l've got very goodnews for you.
l've got another $50,000 for you.

973
01:15:00,023 --> 01:15:01,965
$50,000 changes nothing!

974
01:15:02,103 --> 01:15:04,274
lmight as well walk across the camp...

975
01:15:04,342 --> 01:15:07,856
...go into his cell, andblow his brains out.

976
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:09,103
Alice.

977
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:11,633
He's nowhere near Peter.

978
01:15:12,087 --> 01:15:13,396
How do you know?

979
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:17,846
That's a weather sheet from last Sunday.
When l was talking to him...

980
01:15:17,911 --> 01:15:21,173
...it was raining and when it was
thundering, l heard it on the radio.

981
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,437
lt's not raining in the mountains,
and we know Peter's three days away.

982
01:15:24,504 --> 01:15:26,870
That means that this guy is in this city.

983
01:15:27,799 --> 01:15:29,622
Marco, if...

984
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,782
...you are near Peter Bowman,
go and get him and put him on the radio...

985
01:15:33,976 --> 01:15:38,133
...so he can talk to his wife,
and we'll accept that as a proof of life.

986
01:15:38,712 --> 01:15:39,857
Over.

987
01:15:44,632 --> 01:15:46,160
Do you copy?

988
01:15:53,178 --> 01:15:56,243
You must understand that you're dealing
with a single family here.

989
01:15:56,473 --> 01:15:58,929
We know he works for
that oil company Octonal.

990
01:15:59,866 --> 01:16:02,866
We know that Octonalis
the biggest oil company in the world.

991
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:04,082
Peter Bowman doesn't work for Octonal.

992
01:16:06,137 --> 01:16:08,559
Peter Bowman was here, subcontracting....

993
01:16:08,665 --> 01:16:10,902
-lt's her. Alice.
-Beautiful.

994
01:16:12,954 --> 01:16:15,737
lasked for $3 million, l come down
to two. lt's an insult.

995
01:16:15,802 --> 01:16:18,650
He's losing faith in the family,
and especially in the wife.

996
01:16:18,777 --> 01:16:20,305
This is bullshit. You know him.

997
01:16:20,379 --> 01:16:23,761
We can't be responsible
for what he may do to himself!

998
01:16:24,186 --> 01:16:27,536
l think wejustput a bullet in his head
and sell you the body.

999
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:37,430
l couldn't listen anymore.

1000
01:16:40,411 --> 01:16:41,655
lt's all right.

1001
01:16:45,787 --> 01:16:46,867
You okay?

1002
01:16:49,595 --> 01:16:51,668
People say things happen for a reason.

1003
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:54,260
You must get a lot of that, right?

1004
01:17:00,284 --> 01:17:02,553
l had a miscarriage eight months ago.

1005
01:17:02,877 --> 01:17:04,153
ln Africa.

1006
01:17:04,284 --> 01:17:07,066
lt wasn't anybody's fault.
lt wasn't Peter's fault.

1007
01:17:07,836 --> 01:17:10,487
Not like l didn't try to blame him, or...

1008
01:17:11,932 --> 01:17:14,616
...blame myself like l deserved it,
like there was a reason.

1009
01:17:14,685 --> 01:17:16,855
lf l could just figure it out.

1010
01:17:18,077 --> 01:17:21,971
l thought if l wasn't the one keeping
control, everything would fall apart.

1011
01:17:22,557 --> 01:17:24,793
And l thought that l could just...

1012
01:17:25,629 --> 01:17:27,287
...make it all happen.

1013
01:17:28,893 --> 01:17:31,708
The places we've been, like Thailand...

1014
01:17:32,733 --> 01:17:34,075
...Africa.

1015
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:38,643
There's so much pain, you know.

1016
01:17:38,846 --> 01:17:41,660
You can't possibly make
any sense out of it.

1017
01:17:41,789 --> 01:17:46,524
You can't push it away, even if you're
paralyzed by it. What good are you? So...

1018
01:17:48,894 --> 01:17:50,323
...you let it go.

1019
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:54,264
And now that you don't have control?

1020
01:17:55,775 --> 01:17:57,148
lt's like a faith.

1021
01:17:57,438 --> 01:17:58,933
Once you let go...

1022
01:17:59,742 --> 01:18:01,782
...everything becomes clear.

1023
01:18:03,615 --> 01:18:07,412
All the stupid, stupid shit
that l worried about.

1024
01:18:08,447 --> 01:18:10,170
Everything that l put her through.

1025
01:18:11,135 --> 01:18:13,754
lt's like, since the baby, l....

1026
01:18:15,231 --> 01:18:19,323
lt's like everything l learned along the way
somehow didn't apply to me, too.

1027
01:18:20,798 --> 01:18:23,166
You think l would have gotten
the message.

1028
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,083
l gotta get through this.

1029
01:18:26,432 --> 01:18:27,228
l gotta get home.

1030
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:30,846
Things don't happen for a reason.

1031
01:18:32,735 --> 01:18:34,197
They just...

1032
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:36,733
...happen.

1033
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,451
My daughter is buried in Africa.

1034
01:18:47,201 --> 01:18:49,176
Who can explain that?

1035
01:18:51,905 --> 01:18:53,366
What was her name?

1036
01:18:55,489 --> 01:18:56,634
Mali.

1037
01:18:57,729 --> 01:18:59,671
Mali Jasmine Bowman.

1038
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:02,172
lt's a beautiful name.

1039
01:19:04,097 --> 01:19:06,072
Nobody ever asked me that.

1040
01:19:26,978 --> 01:19:28,091
Okay, Marco.

1041
01:19:28,994 --> 01:19:31,548
We've got $475,000.

1042
01:19:31,714 --> 01:19:33,438
That is not a goodnumber!

1043
01:19:33,506 --> 01:19:35,229
Marco, you've got to think about it.

1044
01:19:35,299 --> 01:19:39,260
lt is a good number. lt's the right number.
lt's the only number.

1045
01:19:46,819 --> 01:19:49,404
There is no company, no insurance.

1046
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:51,550
All you're dealing with is the family.

1047
01:19:51,619 --> 01:19:52,994
This babble is bullshit.

1048
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:56,089
They need to start thinking harder,
like around $2million...

1049
01:19:56,164 --> 01:19:58,268
...or they'llnever see him again.

1050
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:03,938
We should close at $500,000.
We should look at $500,000.

1051
01:20:04,195 --> 01:20:05,625
You can forget it.

1052
01:20:07,267 --> 01:20:08,893
The family has worked very hard.

1053
01:20:08,963 --> 01:20:12,280
This is the complete net worth
and assets of this man's family.

1054
01:20:12,452 --> 01:20:13,913
lt's not possible.

1055
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:16,060
lam trying, you understand?

1056
01:20:16,388 --> 01:20:18,560
lam working mypeople.

1057
01:20:18,628 --> 01:20:20,253
lam trying to make this happen.

1058
01:20:20,324 --> 01:20:24,797
But lneed something from you.
You give me nothing, nothing!

1059
01:20:27,876 --> 01:20:31,193
Marco, we got $600,000.

1060
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:34,562
$600,000 changes nothing.

1061
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:38,077
The maintenance alone for this brother
is more than you are offering.

1062
01:20:38,149 --> 01:20:39,807
lf that changes nothing...

1063
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:46,048
...then you'll have to come up with
a number that does start to change things.

1064
01:20:48,325 --> 01:20:52,799
lfyou go to $650,000
l will take that back to mypeople.

1065
01:20:56,806 --> 01:20:58,846
You think you can get $650,000?

1066
01:21:02,054 --> 01:21:05,250
Right, Marco.
We're going to close it at $650,000.

1067
01:21:05,606 --> 01:21:10,910
Okay. l willgo to mypeople andl'll talk
to you again on Sunday night.

1068
01:21:49,896 --> 01:21:52,613
No. lt's all right. l'll be over here.

1069
01:22:00,616 --> 01:22:01,598
Peter.

1070
01:22:02,985 --> 01:22:05,253
-What are you doing?
-Be quiet!

1071
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:13,737
-Are you crazy?
-Watch for me!

1072
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:19,041
-What are you doing? lt's too dangerous.
-Give me your Bible.

1073
01:22:19,273 --> 01:22:21,575
-What for?
-Give me your goddamn Bible!

1074
01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:24,387
Watch.

1075
01:22:27,273 --> 01:22:28,648
lt's all right!

1076
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:31,911
Jesus, we're right there.
And there is the pipeline.

1077
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:33,119
Hurry up.

1078
01:22:34,953 --> 01:22:36,644
l can't believe we're so close.

1079
01:22:36,714 --> 01:22:38,176
They are coming back.

1080
01:22:40,266 --> 01:22:42,469
You're crazy. You're risking our lives.

1081
01:22:42,537 --> 01:22:43,880
Okay, almost.

1082
01:22:44,074 --> 01:22:45,187
Goddamn fool!

1083
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:47,169
l'm going to bring it back!

1084
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:48,904
l'll take it back.

1085
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:51,785
No, it's too dangerous. l'll do it.

1086
01:23:04,395 --> 01:23:05,825
Look at me!

1087
01:23:30,796 --> 01:23:32,803
These pigs are lucky to have you.

1088
01:23:38,093 --> 01:23:39,783
Muy lucky.

1089
01:23:43,149 --> 01:23:46,084
That's for your main account.
The others are subsidiary accounts.

1090
01:23:46,157 --> 01:23:48,296
-l'm signing all these?
-And initial each page.

1091
01:23:48,365 --> 01:23:51,332
You have to keep
each account under $200,000.

1092
01:23:51,597 --> 01:23:54,499
Anything over that,
they put a magnifying glass on it.

1093
01:23:55,565 --> 01:23:58,762
Once the accounts are available,
it takes less than an hour...

1094
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:01,994
...for the funds to be transferred
from your bank in Denver.

1095
01:24:05,453 --> 01:24:08,617
Dino, that third drawer down
at the bottom, there's candles.

1096
01:24:09,005 --> 01:24:11,821
Maria, can you grab me
some candle holders?

1097
01:24:12,494 --> 01:24:13,704
Sorry about that.

1098
01:24:13,775 --> 01:24:17,222
Don't apologize, one has to live
with these guerrillas, l suppose.

1099
01:24:17,294 --> 01:24:19,563
Torch it up. There. Careful.

1100
01:24:21,678 --> 01:24:23,467
We need to initial the passport numbers.

1101
01:24:23,535 --> 01:24:25,095
The host with the most.

1102
01:24:25,806 --> 01:24:27,879
Just like your last birthday party.

1103
01:24:29,295 --> 01:24:31,467
What happened at your last birthday party?

1104
01:24:31,535 --> 01:24:33,390
Terry popped out of a cake...

1105
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:36,907
...scared the shit out of us.
lt's a K and R thing.

1106
01:24:42,255 --> 01:24:44,165
You got to get me a pair of those boots.

1107
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,606
l'll never make it out of here in these.

1108
01:24:47,599 --> 01:24:49,738
-You won't make it without me.
-No!

1109
01:24:51,088 --> 01:24:54,732
l'm not going to be responsible for you.
This is my decision. For me.

1110
01:24:55,727 --> 01:24:58,215
Once l start, l'm not gonna turn back.

1111
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,200
You're not responsible.

1112
01:25:01,073 --> 01:25:01,934
Erich.

1113
01:25:02,064 --> 01:25:04,136
l have to get back to my wife.

1114
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,895
l have to. lf l stay here, l'll die.

1115
01:25:07,055 --> 01:25:08,398
l know it.

1116
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,862
This is not your problem.

1117
01:25:12,944 --> 01:25:14,439
l'm coming with you.

1118
01:25:14,737 --> 01:25:16,907
l can't stay here alone.

1119
01:25:17,425 --> 01:25:18,570
Not now.

1120
01:25:19,345 --> 01:25:20,774
l'd go crazy.

1121
01:25:22,129 --> 01:25:24,016
Marco, it's Tio. Acknowledge?

1122
01:25:25,617 --> 01:25:29,097
Marco, it's Tio. Do you copy? Over.

1123
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:33,167
ls this thing usual? What is this?
A ploy? What is he doing?

1124
01:25:33,617 --> 01:25:38,125
He said he'd be on the radio on Sunday.
He's taking the figure back.

1125
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,526
-That's a deal.
-Where is he?

1126
01:25:40,817 --> 01:25:43,239
Marco, if for some reason
you can hear me...

1127
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,448
...but l can't hear you...

1128
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:48,689
...we have to work out some other way
of communicating.

1129
01:25:48,818 --> 01:25:50,062
Marco, do you copy?

1130
01:25:53,042 --> 01:25:55,890
Acknowledge. Marco, do you copy?

1131
01:25:55,955 --> 01:25:59,599
lt's Tio. Calling Marco, do you copy?

1132
01:26:00,883 --> 01:26:04,625
We're getting a little anxious to know
if this deal is 100 percent.

1133
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:07,305
Ask if Peter is all right, can you?

1134
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:10,733
We need some kind of indication
that Peter Bowman is okay.

1135
01:26:14,098 --> 01:26:15,244
Which way?

1136
01:26:15,987 --> 01:26:17,874
The river's got to be this way!

1137
01:26:21,011 --> 01:26:23,313
Get up! We gotta keep moving!

1138
01:26:43,507 --> 01:26:46,410
-Come on!
-No, you got to get out of here!

1139
01:26:46,483 --> 01:26:50,259
Take this! Get the map out of here!
lt's your only chance.

1140
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:53,172
-Promise me you'll keep going.
-l promise.

1141
01:26:55,732 --> 01:26:56,681
Shit!

1142
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:17,939
Where's your pigs?

1143
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:30,223
Marco, this is Tio. Do you copy?

1144
01:28:24,952 --> 01:28:26,130
Good day.

1145
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,597
You better get out of there.

1146
01:28:28,953 --> 01:28:31,702
-What's up?
-The German. Kessler.

1147
01:28:31,769 --> 01:28:33,013
That missionary fella?

1148
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:36,626
He's out. Some farmer dumped him
at one of my precincts last night.

1149
01:28:37,785 --> 01:28:39,640
What's that got to do with me?

1150
01:28:40,025 --> 01:28:43,189
He says he was with Peter.
He says they made a run for it.

1151
01:28:43,769 --> 01:28:45,711
lt doesn't sound good, Terry.

1152
01:28:48,409 --> 01:28:51,475
For the meals, we could eat together.

1153
01:28:52,377 --> 01:28:54,101
But the food, it's nothing.

1154
01:28:54,489 --> 01:28:56,628
lt's just to keep you alive.

1155
01:28:56,826 --> 01:29:01,583
But Peter would transform this crap
into a feast. He would say:

1156
01:29:02,586 --> 01:29:05,882
''Tonight, let's see
what Alice has made for us.''

1157
01:29:07,674 --> 01:29:08,984
Alice...

1158
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:12,688
...you were everything for him.

1159
01:29:14,363 --> 01:29:17,712
He talked about you
and your daughter, Mali...

1160
01:29:18,138 --> 01:29:19,862
...all the time.

1161
01:29:21,531 --> 01:29:24,051
He loved you both so very much.

1162
01:29:26,139 --> 01:29:27,546
You have to know--

1163
01:29:30,107 --> 01:29:31,863
l'm so sorry.

1164
01:29:32,955 --> 01:29:36,087
He didn't see him killed.
He didn't see a body. He heard a shot.

1165
01:29:36,188 --> 01:29:38,970
You gotta wake up.
You gotta get real on this.

1166
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:43,696
You don't spend that much time
working on a deal and kill your hostage.

1167
01:29:43,772 --> 01:29:46,674
When was the last time you had contact?
A week? Two weeks?

1168
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:49,563
l've just had nothing but 22 days of static.

1169
01:29:49,628 --> 01:29:52,924
Maybe there are no more deals to be had.
Maybe this is coming apart.

1170
01:29:52,988 --> 01:29:54,646
Maybe he's alive.

1171
01:29:54,908 --> 01:29:56,249
Maybe he is.

1172
01:29:56,316 --> 01:29:59,612
Maybe he is. But what we do know
is that my guy is still up there...

1173
01:29:59,676 --> 01:30:02,393
...and they don't know Kessler's out.
They think he's dead.

1174
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:06,617
Kessler knows every inch of that camp,
and he's willing to help me.

1175
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,406
-He's a missionary--
-He's not!

1176
01:30:08,477 --> 01:30:10,899
He is from the French Foreign Legion.

1177
01:30:11,357 --> 01:30:14,554
So what? He found God.
He's got a map in there.

1178
01:30:14,941 --> 01:30:17,330
A map that l think is real.

1179
01:30:19,261 --> 01:30:20,951
Where are you going with this?

1180
01:30:21,021 --> 01:30:22,134
Okay.

1181
01:30:22,941 --> 01:30:25,331
This has to stay quiet.

1182
01:30:25,757 --> 01:30:27,732
And she has to know that.

1183
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:36,244
You're thinking of going in?
ls that what you're thinking?

1184
01:30:36,318 --> 01:30:38,260
Fuck thinking. That's what l'm doing.

1185
01:30:38,334 --> 01:30:42,644
l'm in there on the telephone. That's all
l can do. Tell me what else l should do.

1186
01:30:44,927 --> 01:30:47,447
Talk to me before you do anything, okay?

1187
01:30:47,678 --> 01:30:49,239
For you, l can do that.

1188
01:30:49,598 --> 01:30:50,678
For you.

1189
01:30:50,783 --> 01:30:53,947
lf you don't keep me up to speed,
l'm gonna take it personally.

1190
01:30:54,015 --> 01:30:56,023
You've been doing that a lot lately.

1191
01:30:58,975 --> 01:31:00,501
l can't hear any more of this!

1192
01:31:00,575 --> 01:31:03,031
-Wait!
-An eyewitness saw him killed.

1193
01:31:03,104 --> 01:31:05,405
Until we know for sure,
this has got to stay in play.

1194
01:31:05,471 --> 01:31:08,341
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

1195
01:31:09,247 --> 01:31:10,589
He didn't see a body.

1196
01:31:10,655 --> 01:31:12,543
Peter is dead!

1197
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:14,844
Let me grieve!

1198
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:17,723
-Why can't you do that?
-lnstinct.

1199
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:20,059
Until l know, until l'm sure...

1200
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:23,421
...until l've received a visual confirmation
of the body of Peter...

1201
01:31:23,488 --> 01:31:26,717
...l'm looking to retrieve my cargo
and complete my mission.

1202
01:32:14,017 --> 01:32:15,611
She's just a girl.

1203
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:24,062
She's too young to be involved in this,
please. lt's very dangerous for her.

1204
01:34:28,584 --> 01:34:29,925
How are you doing?

1205
01:34:31,911 --> 01:34:33,570
l thought we had a deal going.

1206
01:34:33,639 --> 01:34:35,811
l haven't heard from you in two weeks.
l miss you.

1207
01:34:40,137 --> 01:34:41,959
Why don't you call me ''Tio''?

1208
01:34:43,176 --> 01:34:44,834
And l'll call you ''Marco.''

1209
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:50,883
You've got a good game going.

1210
01:34:51,528 --> 01:34:53,798
Your wife thinks you're out
with the card buddies...

1211
01:34:53,865 --> 01:34:55,905
...they think you're off with a mistress.

1212
01:34:55,977 --> 01:34:58,694
And there you are, on the radio,
every Wednesday night...

1213
01:34:58,761 --> 01:35:00,736
...bartering human life.

1214
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:11,874
This is a tape of my friend Marco.

1215
01:35:13,097 --> 01:35:14,624
lt's not the only one.

1216
01:35:17,354 --> 01:35:19,077
ls Peter Bowman alive?

1217
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:24,584
ls Peter Bowman alive?

1218
01:35:26,346 --> 01:35:27,971
He tried to escape.

1219
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:30,272
He was hurt.

1220
01:35:32,171 --> 01:35:33,098
He's alive.

1221
01:35:43,275 --> 01:35:45,282
ls he with the ltalian, Calitri?

1222
01:35:47,371 --> 01:35:49,411
How did you find me?

1223
01:35:50,987 --> 01:35:53,572
Now, l have $600,000 waiting.

1224
01:35:53,675 --> 01:35:55,780
l'll get another $50,000 off the books...

1225
01:35:56,523 --> 01:35:59,077
...between you and me, if we get this done.

1226
01:36:00,747 --> 01:36:02,241
Or l've got this tape.

1227
01:36:02,315 --> 01:36:06,439
l'll lay it on your golfing buddies and
you don't make it out of the car park alive.

1228
01:36:06,507 --> 01:36:08,930
So, let's just get this deal done, shall we?

1229
01:36:09,804 --> 01:36:11,145
lt's not the money.

1230
01:36:11,212 --> 01:36:12,968
That doesn't matter anymore.

1231
01:36:13,132 --> 01:36:15,019
lt's always the money, Fred.

1232
01:36:15,308 --> 01:36:17,130
You have $1 billion?

1233
01:36:17,196 --> 01:36:19,685
Because that's the money
we are talking about.

1234
01:36:20,396 --> 01:36:24,106
You think Octonal will buy this pipeline
without a promise from the army...

1235
01:36:24,173 --> 01:36:26,245
...to completely destroy us?

1236
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:29,414
That pipeline goes right through
our coca fields!

1237
01:36:30,573 --> 01:36:32,166
They are buying a war.

1238
01:36:32,365 --> 01:36:34,917
Peter Bowman will never get down.

1239
01:36:35,534 --> 01:36:37,476
He knows too much.

1240
01:36:37,772 --> 01:36:39,660
We are fighting for our life.

1241
01:36:39,725 --> 01:36:43,042
Listen to me. There are no more deals.

1242
01:36:44,749 --> 01:36:46,472
Enjoy the parade, Fred.

1243
01:36:49,774 --> 01:36:52,970
This is the camp.
He said they call it Canyon Verde.

1244
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:56,743
This is the river. This valley,
the big one below, is very active.

1245
01:36:56,814 --> 01:36:59,367
Every time the army moves through,
there's a skirmish.

1246
01:36:59,438 --> 01:37:01,478
March, May and June.

1247
01:37:01,582 --> 01:37:05,957
Kessler said that every couple of weeks,
the whole camp would run out and fight.

1248
01:37:07,662 --> 01:37:10,084
-Pipeline?
-Fifteen clicks down river.

1249
01:37:16,174 --> 01:37:18,214
Terry Thorne. Tomas Morales.

1250
01:37:18,287 --> 01:37:21,451
These guys are top. They're
my Panama crew, l trained them myself.

1251
01:37:26,287 --> 01:37:28,229
So, simply, all we have to do...

1252
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:31,788
...is encourage the army to cross the river.

1253
01:37:31,855 --> 01:37:35,467
Right about here would be convenient.
Start a battle, drain the camp.

1254
01:37:35,855 --> 01:37:37,895
Drop into this flat area.

1255
01:37:38,063 --> 01:37:41,512
While they're fighting, we slip in
from behind, extract cargo and exit.

1256
01:37:41,584 --> 01:37:44,137
Basically, we just call the army,
schedule a battle.

1257
01:37:44,208 --> 01:37:46,630
How would Wednesday
around 3:00 be for you?

1258
01:37:49,265 --> 01:37:52,363
We don't call them, mate.
Alice will do it for us.

1259
01:37:56,177 --> 01:37:58,632
Can you get a bird? Crew plus seven?

1260
01:37:58,897 --> 01:38:00,904
Are you in love with this woman?

1261
01:38:04,304 --> 01:38:06,727
l don't know
what you're holding out hope for.

1262
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,801
You'll save her husband,
she'll see the light and run off with you?

1263
01:38:09,873 --> 01:38:12,394
lt doesn't work that way. You know that.

1264
01:38:18,257 --> 01:38:21,487
l want to cash out of here.
l want my own shop.

1265
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:25,037
lf we could pull this off....

1266
01:38:25,105 --> 01:38:27,788
This is the stuff of legends.
We could sell this.

1267
01:38:28,210 --> 01:38:31,374
Don't get me wrong.
l would love to go out of here a winner.

1268
01:38:31,761 --> 01:38:36,268
But l have been over this and over this
a thousand times, and it's fucked!

1269
01:38:42,322 --> 01:38:43,663
So we're on, then?

1270
01:38:44,562 --> 01:38:45,991
Absolutely.

1271
01:38:50,835 --> 01:38:52,777
You're gonna have to lie, Alice.

1272
01:38:53,235 --> 01:38:55,787
You got to totally bullshit this bastard.

1273
01:38:55,923 --> 01:38:58,857
We've got to get the army
to in vade ELTterritory tomorrow.

1274
01:38:58,931 --> 01:39:01,965
Peter's life depends on it.
Youjust have to walk in there...

1275
01:39:02,035 --> 01:39:05,069
...you walk right up to Fellner
and you flat-out lie.

1276
01:39:05,203 --> 01:39:08,019
Andhe's got to buy it,
or we run out ofoptions.

1277
01:39:10,515 --> 01:39:11,595
Alice...

1278
01:39:11,668 --> 01:39:13,129
...are you...

1279
01:39:13,299 --> 01:39:14,576
...okay?

1280
01:39:15,252 --> 01:39:18,318
ELT wants $1 million for Peter.
We don't have it.

1281
01:39:19,284 --> 01:39:20,811
That's a lot of money.

1282
01:39:22,164 --> 01:39:24,717
lf l gave you information
for protecting the pipeline...

1283
01:39:24,788 --> 01:39:27,243
...would Octonal step up
and do the right thing?

1284
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:31,661
What kind of information
are we talking about?

1285
01:39:34,836 --> 01:39:37,902
Alice, stop! Alonzo, don't go away.
l'll be right back.

1286
01:39:38,068 --> 01:39:39,498
Alice, come on.

1287
01:39:39,796 --> 01:39:43,092
You think l don't wake up every morning
and think about Peter?

1288
01:39:43,285 --> 01:39:47,475
l have had a dozen meetings with
the transition team about this situation.

1289
01:39:47,701 --> 01:39:49,109
Just how wrong l think it is.

1290
01:39:49,173 --> 01:39:50,383
Fuck you, Ted.

1291
01:39:51,637 --> 01:39:52,914
Look...

1292
01:39:54,709 --> 01:39:57,044
...l'm not sure
what we're talking about here.

1293
01:39:57,109 --> 01:39:59,410
But you give me something to work with...

1294
01:39:59,862 --> 01:40:02,250
...and maybe l can push this the last mile.

1295
01:40:04,566 --> 01:40:06,835
ELT is going after the pipeline tomorrow.

1296
01:40:06,902 --> 01:40:08,178
l know where.

1297
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:11,532
Do you step up for Peter or not?

1298
01:40:12,182 --> 01:40:14,965
l don't know what you think
you're trying to accomplish...

1299
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:18,259
...or what you think you know,
or how stupid you think l am...

1300
01:40:18,423 --> 01:40:20,692
...but l get three military briefings a week.

1301
01:40:20,758 --> 01:40:24,816
lt's a good bet that if anyone knew
what was happening here, it would be me.

1302
01:40:25,239 --> 01:40:26,417
ls that a no?

1303
01:40:26,487 --> 01:40:28,494
How could you possibly know this?

1304
01:40:36,471 --> 01:40:38,129
And who the hell is that?

1305
01:40:42,839 --> 01:40:45,774
l'm Kessler. Erich Kessler.

1306
01:40:52,824 --> 01:40:55,344
Two phosphorous, two smoke, two HE...

1307
01:40:55,415 --> 01:40:57,074
...two flashbangs per mag.

1308
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:05,814
G-36.

1309
01:41:06,424 --> 01:41:08,051
But it's a British kick.

1310
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:12,535
-One day's rations.
-One day?

1311
01:41:14,681 --> 01:41:18,063
l've just come from an urgent sit-down
with our old friend Dover McLoon...

1312
01:41:18,137 --> 01:41:22,327
...at the embassy, who's freaked out today
over a rebel push up towards Rio Verde.

1313
01:41:22,393 --> 01:41:23,571
Nice going, Alice.

1314
01:41:23,641 --> 01:41:25,103
Ready to rock, Terry.

1315
01:41:25,176 --> 01:41:27,893
Kit inspection in 15 minutes.
We're on the bird in an hour.

1316
01:41:27,961 --> 01:41:29,783
You heard the man. Let's go!

1317
01:41:30,393 --> 01:41:32,814
Let's go! We've got to move right now.

1318
01:41:38,042 --> 01:41:41,904
Don't make me wait. Coming at us.
We got to prep that LZ right now!

1319
01:41:42,394 --> 01:41:44,150
l've never seen you nervous.

1320
01:41:45,593 --> 01:41:46,804
Yes, you have.

1321
01:43:36,191 --> 01:43:37,751
l make it 90 to 100.

1322
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:40,118
And that ain't no overnight stay.

1323
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:46,552
Kessler's map is perfect.

1324
01:43:46,622 --> 01:43:48,117
Peter is the engineer.

1325
01:43:54,335 --> 01:43:55,480
l'm impressed.

1326
01:43:55,551 --> 01:43:57,339
Fellner does have clout.

1327
01:43:58,175 --> 01:44:00,215
ln less than 24 hours, the army...

1328
01:44:00,351 --> 01:44:02,456
...has crossed the river.

1329
01:44:02,912 --> 01:44:04,188
How silly.

1330
01:44:04,255 --> 01:44:05,685
Well, my old mate...

1331
01:44:07,552 --> 01:44:09,439
...why don't you wander uptown?

1332
01:44:09,504 --> 01:44:11,446
l'll catch you on the flip side.

1333
01:45:08,386 --> 01:45:10,241
Downtown-3 is in position.

1334
01:45:11,106 --> 01:45:12,350
Copy, Downtown-3.

1335
01:45:12,418 --> 01:45:14,012
Downtown-1, stand by.

1336
01:45:14,211 --> 01:45:18,237
This is Uptown-1 . We've arrived and
taken our position by the farmhouse, over.

1337
01:45:18,307 --> 01:45:20,314
Uptown-1, this is Downtown-1 .

1338
01:45:20,836 --> 01:45:23,553
Solid visual on the wood shack.
Breakfast in bed for one.

1339
01:45:24,034 --> 01:45:26,107
Appears principal cargo is on board. Over.

1340
01:45:26,499 --> 01:45:27,579
Roger that.

1341
01:45:29,155 --> 01:45:30,977
Downtown-1, this is Uptown-1 .

1342
01:45:31,044 --> 01:45:34,110
We have breakfast for three
and delivery in progress.

1343
01:45:34,179 --> 01:45:36,764
All call signs, let's go on a final head count.

1344
01:45:36,835 --> 01:45:38,690
Wood shack, one player.

1345
01:45:38,947 --> 01:45:41,468
Red bandanna. POR, door, 6 o'clock.

1346
01:45:42,084 --> 01:45:44,866
Barracks, 3 o'clock, five players. Over.

1347
01:45:44,932 --> 01:45:48,827
Uptown-1 has a two-man detail
on the farm with a possible cargo inside...

1348
01:45:49,221 --> 01:45:50,148
...and...

1349
01:45:50,308 --> 01:45:53,342
...we have a player returning downtown
via the upper path.

1350
01:45:53,412 --> 01:45:56,708
Downtown-1, this is Downtown-3.
Parade ground, 15.

1351
01:45:57,028 --> 01:46:00,289
Copy.
That gives us 21 visuals downtown...

1352
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:03,267
...two uptown, and one in transit.
24 confirmed.

1353
01:46:03,332 --> 01:46:04,707
Copy, that makes us ready.

1354
01:46:04,773 --> 01:46:07,588
Uptown-1 is good to go.
Standing by, Downtown.

1355
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,396
Peter Bowman. Peter Bowman.

1356
01:47:32,105 --> 01:47:33,599
Alice sent me.

1357
01:47:33,864 --> 01:47:36,864
Alice, your wife, sent me.

1358
01:47:36,968 --> 01:47:39,554
She told me about Mali, your daughter.
How she died...

1359
01:47:39,624 --> 01:47:41,119
...in Africa.

1360
01:47:43,592 --> 01:47:44,869
My daughter?

1361
01:47:45,065 --> 01:47:46,145
Mali.

1362
01:47:48,297 --> 01:47:49,507
Mali.

1363
01:47:49,737 --> 01:47:51,592
Alice told me. Your wife.

1364
01:47:51,657 --> 01:47:52,999
So you would know.

1365
01:47:54,153 --> 01:47:56,063
l'm here to get you home, okay?

1366
01:47:56,553 --> 01:47:57,601
All right?

1367
01:47:58,313 --> 01:48:00,201
You're not fucking with me?

1368
01:48:00,297 --> 01:48:02,818
No, mate. l'm for real.

1369
01:48:03,882 --> 01:48:05,638
We're gonna get out of here.

1370
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:08,578
All right?

1371
01:48:10,026 --> 01:48:10,887
Okay.

1372
01:48:15,498 --> 01:48:17,866
Downtown-2,
you've got a player at 5 o'clock.

1373
01:48:20,459 --> 01:48:21,506
What fucking player?

1374
01:48:33,548 --> 01:48:35,370
Softly, mate. Softly.

1375
01:48:47,307 --> 01:48:48,038
Fuck!

1376
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:54,660
Downtown-1, what the fuck was that?

1377
01:48:55,277 --> 01:48:56,770
All call signs, wait out.

1378
01:48:59,084 --> 01:49:00,939
l repeat. What the fuck was that, Terry?

1379
01:49:01,004 --> 01:49:02,182
Downtown-2?

1380
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:04,133
Downtown-2, respond!

1381
01:49:04,205 --> 01:49:06,790
This is Downtown-2. Not in position.

1382
01:49:09,388 --> 01:49:12,007
l've got a 25th confirmed. Visual.
Downtown-3, 12 o'clock.

1383
01:49:13,292 --> 01:49:15,081
Downtown-1, l got him.

1384
01:49:15,148 --> 01:49:16,195
What are we doing?

1385
01:49:16,909 --> 01:49:17,639
Stand by.

1386
01:49:21,997 --> 01:49:23,721
What are we doing here?

1387
01:49:27,469 --> 01:49:28,003
Fuck!

1388
01:49:28,237 --> 01:49:29,993
Downtown-1, what are we doing?

1389
01:49:33,229 --> 01:49:34,342
Go loud.

1390
01:49:34,541 --> 01:49:36,363
-Fuck.
-Roger that.

1391
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:39,651
He's down. Shift, 4 o'clock.

1392
01:49:41,614 --> 01:49:42,596
Can you use one of these?

1393
01:49:52,015 --> 01:49:53,160
Cover me!

1394
01:50:19,504 --> 01:50:21,129
Safety is on! Get down.

1395
01:50:29,071 --> 01:50:30,959
-Ready, Peter?
-l'm with you.

1396
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:35,273
Back! Back!

1397
01:50:39,313 --> 01:50:40,938
l got the player from the farmhouse.

1398
01:50:41,008 --> 01:50:42,535
l'm shiftingposition.

1399
01:50:42,703 --> 01:50:43,751
Downtown-3!

1400
01:50:43,824 --> 01:50:46,573
Give us some pressure at 9 o'clock,
on my count!

1401
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:48,583
One! Two! Three!

1402
01:50:53,872 --> 01:50:55,465
Peter, go! Stay low.

1403
01:51:03,154 --> 01:51:03,884
Fuck!

1404
01:51:15,570 --> 01:51:17,228
-Peter!
-l'm ready.

1405
01:51:27,667 --> 01:51:28,747
Through there.

1406
01:51:51,123 --> 01:51:52,050
Clear!

1407
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:01,583
Stay down! Stay down!

1408
01:52:24,213 --> 01:52:25,522
-Which way?
-Come on!

1409
01:52:25,588 --> 01:52:28,174
Downtown-1, this is Uptown-1 .
We are secure.

1410
01:52:28,245 --> 01:52:30,733
On the lower path, l got the cargo in tow.

1411
01:52:30,804 --> 01:52:34,066
We've got bogies up our ass.
Bring the Big Bird to LZ 3.

1412
01:52:34,133 --> 01:52:36,042
Copy, Downtown-1. Move to LZ3.

We are Blue, Option 3.

01:52:38,901 --> 01:52:40,690
Big Bird, this is Uptown-1 .

1415

We are good to go.
Proceed to LZ3. lrepeat, LZ3.

1417
01:53:01,494 --> 01:53:02,924
Safety's off, okay?

1418
01:53:02,998 --> 01:53:04,013
Okay?

1419
01:53:04,406 --> 01:53:05,584
Keep moving.

1420
01:53:08,790 --> 01:53:10,350
What are you doing?

1421
01:53:13,175 --> 01:53:16,023
Keep going down the path!
Follow the path!

1422
01:53:31,544 --> 01:53:33,616
Peter, look at me. Look at me!

1423
01:53:33,688 --> 01:53:37,037
You gotta keep going. l know
you're in pain. You've got to keep going.

1424
01:53:37,112 --> 01:53:40,309
Don't let the fuckers catch you.
They'll kill you. Stay on this path.

1425
01:53:40,376 --> 01:53:42,612
This path leads to Alice.
This path leads home!

1426
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:44,884
Stay in front of me. Go!

1427
01:53:56,408 --> 01:53:56,440
Terry, what the hell
is going on down there?

1428
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:58,447
Terry, what the hell
is going on down there?

1429
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:00,757
The Big Bird is en route.

1430
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:05,618
lt's okay! Get the camicia up.

1431
01:54:09,337 --> 01:54:10,711
Terry, where are you?

1432
01:54:11,321 --> 01:54:12,882
Downtown-1 is traveling well.

1433
01:54:12,953 --> 01:54:15,440
We've got a visual on the bird.
We're coming in.

1434
01:54:25,049 --> 01:54:26,479
You big, beautiful bitch!

1435
01:54:27,482 --> 01:54:28,824
There she is!

1436
01:54:28,985 --> 01:54:30,327
You want to go home?

1437
01:54:31,578 --> 01:54:33,367
You're going home, baby!

1438
01:54:55,675 --> 01:54:56,755
Uptown-1.

1439
01:54:56,827 --> 01:54:58,289
This is Downtown-2.

1440
01:54:58,363 --> 01:55:00,884
l have a man down. Downtown-3 is down!

1441
01:55:01,531 --> 01:55:02,327
Say again?

1442
01:55:02,395 --> 01:55:04,402
lrepeat, Downtown-3 is down.

1443
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:06,041
Fuck!

1444
01:55:06,204 --> 01:55:07,895
Give me that fucking thing!

1445
01:55:08,347 --> 01:55:09,144
Go!

1446
01:55:09,851 --> 01:55:10,712
Five!

1447
01:55:14,844 --> 01:55:16,338
Downtown-2...

1448
01:55:16,508 --> 01:55:17,719
...l'm on my way.

1449
01:55:20,572 --> 01:55:22,295
Downtown-1, this is Uptown-1.

1450
01:55:22,364 --> 01:55:24,634
l've got a man down.
Downtown-3 is down.

1451
01:55:24,893 --> 01:55:28,438
l'm going back to get him.
Uptown-2has my cargo on the bird.

1452
01:55:28,508 --> 01:55:31,225
We 'llbe evacuating Downtown-3

1454
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:36,668
Roger that. l'm at the LZ.

1455
01:55:36,732 --> 01:55:38,903
Got an eye on the bird, my cargo is in tow.

1456
01:55:38,972 --> 01:55:40,500
My back door is clear.

1457
01:55:40,957 --> 01:55:42,451
lf you need help, give me a yell.

1458
01:55:45,788 --> 01:55:47,283
Look out, grenade!

1459
01:55:59,998 --> 01:56:01,208
Juaco!

1460
01:56:16,446 --> 01:56:17,526

l got you. Just hang on to me.

1465
01:56:25,406 --> 01:56:27,709
Are you crazy?
Get on that fucking chopper now!

1466
01:56:32,895 --> 01:56:35,066
Eyewash! Give me some eyewash!

1467
01:56:40,991 --> 01:56:42,747
He needs something for his eyes.

1468
01:56:44,191 --> 01:56:45,468
He needs it now.

1469
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:47,643
He's alive!

1470
01:56:48,639 --> 01:56:50,046
lt's right here.

1471
01:56:52,192 --> 01:56:54,679
Carlos, look at me. Who am l?

1472
01:56:54,751 --> 01:56:57,119
-You're an asshole.
-That's fucking right!

1473
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:04,215
Are you all right?

1474
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:07,903
Don't you fucking die on me, man!
l can't tell on you....

1475
01:57:07,969 --> 01:57:09,594
He always does this shit!

1476
01:57:09,664 --> 01:57:12,184
You're a pussy! He's a fucking pussy, man!

1477
01:57:22,529 --> 01:57:23,958
How is it?

1478
01:57:29,185 --> 01:57:30,462
Who are you?

1479
01:57:31,809 --> 01:57:33,151
Terry Thorne.

1480
01:57:35,106 --> 01:57:36,480
How's my wife?

1481
01:57:36,993 --> 01:57:38,138
She okay?

1482
01:57:38,881 --> 01:57:42,264
She misses you.
She's waiting for you where we land.

1483
01:58:22,692 --> 01:58:24,033
Welcome home!

1484
01:58:26,275 --> 01:58:27,869
Keep your head down.

1485
01:58:39,333 --> 01:58:40,674
Hello, Alice.

1486
01:58:45,732 --> 01:58:47,074
You all right?

1487
01:59:19,782 --> 01:59:20,895
Sandro!

1488
01:59:30,886 --> 01:59:32,195
-Hi.
-Hi.

1489
01:59:32,262 --> 01:59:33,670
You look great.

1490
01:59:48,935 --> 01:59:50,430
l need one minute.

1491
01:59:52,871 --> 01:59:53,886
Okay.

1492
02:00:07,208 --> 02:00:09,509
-We did it.
-You did it.

1493
02:00:10,184 --> 02:00:12,191
You know, you better get going.

1494
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:14,564
We could be very unpopular
around here in the future.

1495
02:00:14,633 --> 02:00:16,291
-l thought we'd get a chance--
-What?

1496
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:18,727
To sit around and chat? The three of us?

1497
02:00:18,953 --> 02:00:21,920
There's a 6:00 American flight to Dallas.
You can make it.

1498
02:00:21,992 --> 02:00:23,880
There's a passport in the Jeep for Peter.

1499
02:00:23,945 --> 02:00:26,246
Norma will pack the house.
She'll send everything up.

1500
02:00:26,312 --> 02:00:28,930
His leg looks bad but it can wait till Dallas.

1501
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,342
This is important.

1502
02:00:31,016 --> 02:00:32,511
No telephone calls...

1503
02:00:32,585 --> 02:00:36,229
...no high-fives, no champagne.
You get to the airport...

1504
02:00:36,297 --> 02:00:38,185
...and you make that plane.

1505
02:00:39,081 --> 02:00:41,602
Just tell me
you know how much you mean to me.

1506
02:00:44,426 --> 02:00:45,635
So we're even.

1507
02:00:47,466 --> 02:00:49,091
No, we'll never be even.

1508
02:00:50,729 --> 02:00:52,191
l've given you...

1509
02:00:52,649 --> 02:00:55,017
-...nothing.
-Believe me, we're even.

1510
02:00:57,098 --> 02:00:58,985
You deserve more than this.

1511
02:00:59,434 --> 02:01:01,257
You got a plane to catch.

1512
02:01:03,305 --> 02:01:05,477
l'll see you around, Mrs. Bowman.

1513
02:01:51,564 --> 02:01:53,833
Get my Duke Ellington records.
Get me the Scotch.

1514
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:57,795
The good shit. Twelve-year-old, not crap.
Remember the encrypted phone.

1515
02:01:58,061 --> 02:01:59,522
Take care, Alice.

1516
02:02:01,868 --> 02:02:03,811
Who's the man?

1517
02:02:03,884 --> 02:02:06,535
Stuff of legends. You are the man.

1518
02:02:06,605 --> 02:02:09,540
Sandro,
we've got to get to the airport fast.

1519
02:02:09,645 --> 02:02:11,499
We've got a flight in an hour.

1520
02:02:21,934 --> 02:02:23,177
We made it.

1521
02:02:28,045 --> 02:02:29,060
Yeah.

1522
02:02:29,710 --> 02:02:31,084
Let's go home.

1523
02:02:35,695 --> 02:02:38,695
You and me, we open our own shop.
l run New York, you run London.

1524
02:02:38,766 --> 02:02:42,279
We meet in the Caymans once a month
to visit our money.

1525
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:45,642
Strictly white glove. Lots of long lunches.

1526
02:02:45,710 --> 02:02:48,711
No more fucking frontlines.
Some consulting, some policies...

1527
02:02:48,783 --> 02:02:52,198
...and we give lan a heart attack
before we open the doors.

1528
02:02:56,911 --> 02:02:59,562
l don't know if l want you
visiting my money.
