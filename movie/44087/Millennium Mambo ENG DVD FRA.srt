Directed by Hou Hsiao Hsien

9
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,750
She broke up with Hao-hao,

10
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,780
but he always tracked her down.

11
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,750
Called her...

12
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,230
Begged her to come back...

13
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,310
Again and again.

14
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,470
As if under a spell

15
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,310
or hypnotized...

16
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,910
she couldn't escape.

17
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,750
She always came back.

18
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,990
She told herself...

19
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,870
that she had NT$ 500,000
in the bank.

20
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,390
When she'd used it up,

21
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,550
she would leave him for good.

22
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,310
This happened ten years ago...

23
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,110
ln the year 2001.

24
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,590
The world was greeting
the 21st century

25
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,630
and celebrating the new millennium.

26
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,910
Can you read this simplified Chinese?

27
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,150
''Certificate''.

28
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,750
lt certifies that l took part
in the World Magic Contest.

29
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,550
But it's in English!
We need translation!

30
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,750
Allow me...

31
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,150
- lt was in Mainland China...
- Then why is it in English?

32
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,550
Makes it look more professional.

33
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,580
Really?

34
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,950
What it says is... blah blah blah...

35
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,750
Ding Jianzhong... blah blah blah...
competed in this event...

36
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,550
and won the bronze prize.

37
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,100
My act was called
''Dream of a Dove Flying''.

38
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,510
- Flying?
- A cash prize of 5,000!

39
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,790
lt's around NT$ 20,000.

40
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,190
So where's the 5,000 now?.

41
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,750
- Use magic to figure it out!
- l spent it all.

42
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,150
lt was an international contest.

43
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,390
So now l use only
international coins.

44
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,500
American gold coins,
never China or Taiwan coins!

45
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,870
- A slave to foreign fashion!
- You bet!

46
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,950
Okay, watch this...
Notice how many coins l have?

47
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,950
- How many is it?
- Five.

48
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,750
Five coins.

49
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,350
- How many in my left hand?
- Two.

50
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,430
Nothing up my sleeves!

51
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,790
Here are two.

52
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,750
How many in my right hand?

53
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,110
- Three.
- Are you sure?

54
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,620
One, two, three...

55
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,550
- How many?
- Three.

56
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,390
So l'm holding them tightly.

57
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,710
One more time...
One, two, three,

58
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,110
four,

59
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,500
five... hold tightly.

60
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,260
Alright...

61
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,630
One, two, three, four...
Vicky, help me out here,

62
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,750
hold them tight.
And press down on the table.

63
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,710
How many coins in all?

64
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,030
Four, l still have one here.

65
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,950
Open your fist.

66
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,950
How many?

67
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,540
Five.

68
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,750
That's great!

69
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,750
Thank you.

70
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,630
No applause?

71
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,750
Watch out!

72
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,390
You seem scared!

73
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,070
All bark and no bite!

74
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,590
Happy birthday, Jenny!

75
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,900
What the hell is that?

76
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,350
Not much cop at all!

77
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,390
Feeble!

78
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,030
- l brought it back from China.
- No wonder!

79
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,750
So feeble!

80
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,870
A great thing
with not much inside!

81
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,590
Pass it on.

82
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,750
- You want a bigger glass?
- No, l've had enough.

83
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,110
- Give me the biggest glass.
- You have it already!

84
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,750
Really?

85
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,950
Anybody needs a glass?

86
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,860
Everyone has one?

87
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,870
Happy birthday!

88
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,390
Stop that!

89
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,110
Spread your legs.

90
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,580
She began fooling around at 16,

91
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,510
with Xuan-xuan, most Saturdays.

92
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,630
They took the train
from Keelung to Taipei.

93
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,990
They'd go into the toilet together,

94
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,830
take drugs,

95
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,430
and get high.

96
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,030
She first met Hao-hao
in a club on He Ping Road,

97
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,500
'Spin'.

98
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,190
That day she and Xuan-xuan

99
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,270
planned to go to a karaoke club
with friends.

100
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,070
But the girls were stood up.

101
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,750
Hao-hao and his friends
started chatting to them.

102
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,510
Asked them to sing.

103
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,750
She noticed that

104
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,620
Hao-hao was staring at her
all evening.

105
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,310
Shyly, without saying anything.

106
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,380
She never finished high school.

107
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,870
He stopped her
sitting the final exam.

108
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,740
The night before the exam,

109
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,060
they were in a motel together.

110
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,790
He deliberately didn't wake her.

111
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,220
He didn't want her to take the exam.

112
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,180
He was afraid
she'd move on if she did.

113
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,990
Later, they began living together

114
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,750
in a rented apartment in Taipei.

115
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,870
Neither of them had a job.

116
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,660
Sometimes, he'd ride his bike
back to Keelung

117
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,670
to borrow a little money
from his friends.

118
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,750
One time,

119
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,270
he stole his father's Rolex.

120
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,430
He pawned it for NT$ 80,000.

121
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,140
When his father noticed the loss,
he called and questioned him.

122
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,150
But he denied stealing it.

123
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,910
So his father went to the police.

124
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,590
There was a strong wind that day.
lt was sunny.

125
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,900
The cops came.
They found the pawn ticket

126
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,910
and took both of them
to the police station.

127
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,750
Come on!

128
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,900
Who is he?

129
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,790
That guy?

130
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,260
Don't know, l've seen him around.

131
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,310
Who's that?

132
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,310
- Who?
- He's called Doze.

133
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,750
Don't really know him.

134
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,830
What?

135
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,870
- What is he up to?
- You know her?

136
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,830
- What's it to you?
- l think he's after Vicky.

137
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,910
- You want to shag Vicky?
- Mind your own business.

138
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,750
Piss off!

139
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,590
Fuck! You hit me!

140
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,750
Stop it!

141
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,750
Hey, stop it!

142
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,300
Sorry, he's drunk.

143
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,910
He's had too many.

144
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,750
Come here! Come here!

145
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,830
Never mind, never mind.

146
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,550
Get off me!

147
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,790
Let me at him!

148
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,590
That's enough! Stop it!

149
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,670
Hold me tightly.

150
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,830
Hello?

151
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,660
What?

152
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,380
No!

153
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,750
No, l didn't.

154
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,750
You've misplaced it.

155
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,510
l didn't take it!

156
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,790
l told you, l didn't!

157
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,340
What's up?

158
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,620
My father...

159
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,100
What did he want?

160
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,790
His Rolex.

161
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,270
He thinks you took it?

162
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,750
He found out.

163
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,830
So what did you say?

164
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,190
Hao-hao!

165
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,740
Hao-hao!

166
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,950
- What?
- There's no hot water.

167
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,830
- The heater's packed up?
- l'm trying to take a shower.

168
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,670
- No hot water?
- No.

169
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,350
Turn off the cold tap.
Leave the hot tap on.

170
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,790
- ls the hot tap running?
- Yes.

171
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,270
ls it hot?

172
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,030
No, still cold.

173
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,430
- lt's full on?
- Yes.

174
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,750
Strange.

175
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,030
- Maybe the battery's dead.
- So?

176
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,070
- l'll go buy one.
- Okay.

177
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,830
- Don't be long.
- l won't.

178
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,470
- Let me back in.
- Okay.

179
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,070
- What took you so long?
- Police, Miss.

180
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,470
A Mr. Tuan Chun-hao lives here?

181
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,350
Excuse me.

182
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,900
What's the problem?

183
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,790
Tuan Chun-hao
is implicated in a theft.

184
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,870
We have a warrant to search
these premises.

185
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,430
A simple search...
ls he here now?.

186
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,830
He's out.
He went out this morning.

187
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,030
Who are you?

188
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,990
His girlfriend.

189
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:54,740
So, can we begin our search?

190
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,420
He's very much implicated.

191
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,550
Will you show us around?

192
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,350
- You want to...
- Yes, which is his room?

193
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,470
Which is his room?

194
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,590
As you see, our place isn't big...

195
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,780
That one.

196
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,950
This one, right?

197
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,710
Watch the door. Stay with me.

198
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,750
Miss, please come over here.

199
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,270
We'll search this room,
please stay there.

200
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,750
He's implicated in this case.

201
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,150
That's why we need
to make this search.

202
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,870
- Should l come in?
- Please do.

203
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,310
Where does he keep his things?

204
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,870
- Here.
- This is all his?

205
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,110
- Mine too, it's all mixed up.
- Mixed up?

206
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,910
Do you know when he'll be back?

207
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,580
- No.
- You don't?

208
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,670
What are you looking for?

209
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,750
He's suspected of involvement
in a theft.

210
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,550
A theft?

211
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,590
Hence the search warrant.

212
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,670
What's going on?

213
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,270
- You are Tuan Chun-hao?
- What do you want?

214
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,100
You're implicated in a theft...
We have a search warrant.

215
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,870
Here, my lD.

216
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,190
We're from the criminal division.

217
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,070
Sit there for a moment.

218
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,750
Please accompany me to your room.

219
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,870
Mr. Tuan, here.

220
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,110
To avoid military service,

221
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,790
Hao-hao deliberately starved himself.

222
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,550
He took lots of speed.

223
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,190
Often Hao-hao looked through her bag.

224
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,740
lf he found a blank receipt...
he'd call up the shop

225
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,150
to enquire about it.

226
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,950
And when her phone-card showed

227
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,700
she had made a long call,

228
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,390
he grilled her about it.

229
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,350
Once, he even threw
a thermos flask at her.

230
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,870
But when she packed to leave...

231
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,780
he cried and begged her to stay.

232
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,740
Hao-hao often scribbled notes...

233
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,830
to tell her...

234
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,750
they belonged to different worlds.

235
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,470
He said:
''You came down from your world...

236
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,910
to mine.''

237
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,910
''That's why you don't understand
my world.''

238
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,750
What's that?

239
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,350
What are you smoking?

240
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,380
What's what?

241
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,110
Can l try it?

242
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,190
- What do you know about this?
- So you know a lot? What is it?

243
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,750
Give it to me!
We can smoke it together!

244
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,030
We can smoke it together!

245
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,630
Okay, take it.

246
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,740
- What are you doing?
- What?

247
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,710
What?

248
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,070
What the fuck are you doing?

249
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,030
Throw it away!

250
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,580
Get rid of it!

251
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,270
Give it to me.

252
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,390
Let you!

253
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,830
lt'll fucking kill you!

254
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,590
Why did this call take so long?

255
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,750
- l called home.
- Really?

256
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,750
Yes, l called Keelung, long distance!

257
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,310
Why didn't you call from here?
Why do it on a phone-card?

258
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,110
l wasn't here at the time.

259
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,030
You're fucking cheating me
again, aren't you?

260
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,990
Why would l cheat you?
Why have you been through my things?

261
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,620
- Who were you calling?
- l told you, l called home!

262
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,750
- Who did you call?
- l said, l called home.

263
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,350
Who?

264
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,900
- Which one was it?
- You're getting mad for no reason.

265
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,030
Are you crazy?

266
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,270
Who did you call?

267
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,350
As l said,
l called home, Keelung...

268
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,340
Have you lost it?

269
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,750
You'd better not be lying.

270
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:38,830
- Crazy! Why would l lie to you?
- l'll fucking beat you, you know.

271
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,390
Fuck, why did you go
through my things?

272
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,140
So what?
l wanted to, so what?

273
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,790
- You've completely lost it.
- Screw you!

274
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,900
Psycho!

275
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,750
Who are you calling a psycho?

276
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,950
Who's a psycho?

277
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,750
Who did you call?

278
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,630
Tell me!

279
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,750
l told you, but you don't believe me!
What can l say?

280
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,270
What are you doing?

281
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,100
Going home.

282
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,750
Let go of me!

283
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,750
Let go of me!

284
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,070
- What are you doing?
- Fuck off!

285
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,870
lf you leave, don't come back!

286
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,550
Fuck, who wants...

287
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,060
And then,

288
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,710
to get his rent,

289
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,390
the landlord found her a job
in a hostess bar.

290
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,580
Every day,
as she went to work

291
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,430
and while she was at work,
before closing time...

292
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,540
Hao-hao kept calling her.

293
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,510
lf she got back late,

294
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,740
he'd be waiting for her
on the stairs.

295
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,070
He was jealous that she worked.

296
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,510
But he never worked himself.

297
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,750
He often called his friends over...

298
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,860
to get high,

299
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,140
pop dexies,

300
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,750
play video games...

301
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,110
and turn the music up loud.

302
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,630
At the hostess bar, she met Jack.

303
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,980
They'd met before in Spin.

304
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,260
Jack often took her home to Keelung.

305
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,820
He liked taking her around.

306
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,060
Jack always had guys with him.

307
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,070
There was always trouble.

308
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,470
Jack never refused anyone.

309
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,270
Everybody liked talking to Jack.

310
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,630
And doing business with Jack.

311
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,390
She knew that Jack spoiled her.

312
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,740
He always brought her along.

313
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,150
He treated her...

314
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,150
as if she were his closest buddy.

315
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,510
One more.

316
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:17,750
Your family lives in Taiwan?

317
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,670
No...

318
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,270
My father's relatives
and my aunt live here.

319
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,750
The others live in Hokkaido.

320
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,510
- ln Japan?
- Yes.

321
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,830
Ever been there?

322
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,150
Never to Hokkaido.

323
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,750
lt's very, very cold.

324
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,790
So when are you leaving?

325
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,750
The day after tomorrow.

326
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,870
May l visit you?

327
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,950
lf l go to Japan?

328
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,020
Of course.

329
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,670
Your telephone number.

330
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,350
She knew the Takeuchi brothers

331
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,790
from the Texound club.

332
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,830
They reminded her of Hao-hao.

333
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,830
Quiet, shy...

334
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,430
Their father's Taiwanese.

335
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,750
Mother's Japanese.

336
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,750
They were born in Yubari, Hokkaido.

337
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,750
A mining town in the mountains.

338
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,750
Then the mine was shut down.

339
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,750
lt became a museum.

340
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,900
Their grandma still lived there.

341
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,110
She kept a very old inn.

342
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:00,220
Every February,
during the Yubari Film Festival,

343
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,630
their mother asked them
to come back to help.

344
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,310
Ko told her...

345
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,270
Yubari Film Festival was in progress.

346
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,510
They had to work into the small hours
every night.

347
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:18,310
The inn was packed.

348
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,630
And he said
there was a 'Film Street'.

349
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,310
Above the shops there were billboards
with movie posters.

350
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,710
These were old films.

351
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,870
Tora-san was there.

352
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,750
lshihara Yujiro.

353
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,750
And Charlie Chaplin.

354
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,470
Takeuchi Jun told her...

355
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,790
the whole family
was converging on Yubari

356
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,830
for his Grandma's
eightieth birthday party.

357
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,750
Everyone wished her

358
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,710
another decade
of health and happiness.

359
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,670
But grandma answered that

360
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,500
she wanted to live to be 100.

361
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,740
She wanted to see how

362
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,950
Yubari would change.

363
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,390
You know, l think
we're from two different worlds.

364
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,420
How can we ever get along
with each other?

365
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,150
You are crazy!

366
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,470
Stop that.

367
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,420
Finished?

368
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:39,590
- Did you hear what l just said?
- What did you say?

369
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,430
l'm talking to you nicely,
but you're still angry.

370
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,590
ls it painful to be with me?

371
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:45,300
l'm going out.

372
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,390
Vicky's back!

373
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,750
We can play and get high!

374
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:47,870
l'm into it now!

375
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:44,940
Tuan Chun-hao!

376
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:50,430
- What's up?
- Hao! Settle this with her.

377
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,860
- Take that off.
- What do you want?

378
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,430
What do you want?

379
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:57,900
Leave me alone!

380
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:14,750
Stop that!

381
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,510
We can shower together.

382
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,870
Get out!

383
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:02,270
Get out!

384
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,270
Get out!

385
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:09,190
Get out!

386
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,270
You can't do this!

387
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,950
Get out right away!

388
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:16,790
Come in here!

389
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:28,950
Open the door!

390
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:32,990
Let go of the door!

391
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:34,790
Are you crazy?

392
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,430
She broke up with Hao-hao.

393
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:45,190
But he always tracked her down.

394
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,070
Called her...

395
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:50,750
Begged her to come back...

396
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,830
Again and again.

397
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,110
As if under a spell...

398
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:58,750
or hypnotized...

399
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:02,310
she couldn't escape.

400
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,150
She always came back.

401
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,750
She told herself...

402
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:12,630
that she had NT$ 500,000
in the bank.

403
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,030
When she'd used it up,

404
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:17,790
she'd leave him for good.

405
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:52,190
Vicky,

406
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:54,790
come over here.

407
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:58,110
l want to tell you something.

408
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,750
Let's go outside, okay?

409
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:19,230
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

410
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,750
We can talk outside.

411
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:23,750
Okay?

412
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:27,750
Hao-hao, what's up?

413
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,740
Can we? Outside?

414
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,790
Why don't you tell me here!

415
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:45,590
Let's go outside,
l do have something to tell you.

416
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,900
Can we? Please?

417
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:00,660
- What's up?
- l need to talk to her.

418
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:04,710
Let them chat for a bit.
He has something to tell her.

419
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,470
Vicky, any problem?

420
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:09,270
- Vicky's fine.
- l have something to tell her.

421
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:11,230
Huang, Vicky's okay with it.

422
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:14,750
Hao-hao, you shouldn't be here.

423
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:18,670
lt's alright.

424
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,150
Doze...

425
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:22,870
Doze, it's okay.
Huang, it's okay.

426
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:25,750
Let them chat. Just for a bit.

427
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:29,580
lt won't take long.

428
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,510
Say something!

429
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:34,790
l want to go outside.
lt's private, between her and me.

430
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,750
- What does that mean?
- lt's alright, calm down.

431
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,860
Are you sure, Vicky?

432
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:43,310
- What's this 'private' business?
- She's my girl, asshole!

433
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:56,150
Jack, it's nothing.

434
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:57,580
Huang, don't do that.

435
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,870
lt's okay, Huang.

436
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,030
Take your hands off me!

437
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,270
Huang, please, we're just talking.

438
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,910
Cut the fucking crap!

439
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:15,550
Okay, that's enough.

440
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:17,740
Huang, stop that!

441
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:22,390
Vicky, will you come with me?

442
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:26,110
Will you? Will you?

443
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:30,590
- lt's between us.
- What the fuck is there between you?

444
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,950
- Okay, enough!
- Who do you think we are?

445
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:34,750
Just leave!

446
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:39,750
- Jack, l get it, but l really do...
- Okay!

447
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,750
lt's Vicky's business.

448
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:45,430
She can handle it.

449
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:49,540
- So l can talk to her?
- Sure.

450
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,790
- Really?
- Vicky, deal with it yourself.

451
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:58,070
Okay, the party is over.

452
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:54,070
What is it, Vicky?

453
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:56,870
Come in.

454
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,030
Take off your shoes.

455
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:31,870
lt's Hao-hao again, right?

456
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,670
Are you okay?

457
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:04,030
You'll be alright here.

458
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,750
Jack, do you have any Lights?

459
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:37,830
No, only these.

460
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:48,710
Any chilli sauce?

461
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:49,950
Here.

462
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,990
Can l open this? lt's spicier.

463
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:20,070
- ls it ready?
- Here you go.

464
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:27,150
l'll take it through.

465
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:51,830
l will have some wine first.

466
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:57,270
Not too much.

467
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:04,390
To open the appetite.

468
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,310
Did Pauline get off drugs?

469
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:15,460
lt's hard.

470
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:26,190
Pauline's mother
went to a Buddhist monk.

471
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,870
He wants us to chant a sutra for her.

472
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:32,950
He says it will help a little.

473
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:35,030
Does it work?

474
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:38,830
l promised her mother l'd do it.
Three times a day.

475
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:43,550
lt should help.

476
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:46,220
Have you seen her?
ls she any better?

477
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,070
Or still the same?

478
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:33,950
Your cigarettes.

479
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:41,870
Don't drink too much.

480
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:18,750
My mother was just here.

481
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:20,550
What did she say?

482
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:25,750
She went to pick up my things
with my brother.

483
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:30,790
They told me Hao-hao

484
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:34,910
has ripped up all of my clothes.

485
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:45,270
All that's left is my cell-phone,
which still works.

486
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,790
Between you and Hao-hao...

487
01:14:56,110 --> 01:14:57,750
What do you want to do?

488
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:07,430
That's all over...

489
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:10,430
l'm thinking...

490
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:18,070
l'm just thinking
about what l should do now.

491
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,550
l don't want...

492
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:24,550
l don't want to go back
to the hostess bar.

493
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:28,950
l don't know what l can do.

494
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:33,300
My mother asked me to go back
to Keelung with her.

495
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:37,750
But l don't want that either!

496
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:41,470
l don't know what l should do.

497
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:48,870
lf you stop working in the bar...

498
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,030
that's fine!

499
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:53,750
lt's complicated there.

500
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:56,500
You earn a lot,
but you spend even more.

501
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:07,390
The main thing for you
is to get your life back to normal.

502
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,750
Students who work
in my coffee-shop get NT$ 80 a day.

503
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:13,750
l mean NT$ 80 an hour.

504
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:17,070
They seem happy enough.

505
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:19,270
Normal lives.

506
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:30,070
Maybe that would help?

507
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:36,750
You think l could work
in a coffee-shop?

508
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,750
Why not?

509
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:34,470
l see.

510
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:41,230
l know what's been going on.

511
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:57,550
You tricked some guys
at Stonehead's place, didn't you?

512
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:02,860
- They phoned.
- Who? Stonehead?

513
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:05,740
Ding made their money disappear?

514
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:07,910
What were you thinking of?

515
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:21,750
What did they say?

516
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:25,750
Well, they've seen
through your 'magic'.

517
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:27,750
And now they want something done.

518
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:35,790
Why are you always making trouble?

519
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:49,830
What did he say?

520
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:54,550
He wants me to handle the problem.

521
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,870
But l don't see what l can do.

522
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:01,820
Drink with me.

523
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:10,310
Doze! Doze!

524
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:20,140
Hello? Hello, l'm listening.

525
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:33,390
Okay, got it.

526
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:44,110
ls everything okay?
Jack, what did he say?

527
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:48,750
l don't know how to handle it now.

528
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,670
Where's Ding?

529
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:53,950
Stonehead got you into this?

530
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:55,300
Right.

531
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:13,270
You go home first, okay?

532
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:15,230
You guys, take Vicky home.

533
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:24,740
- Vicky, go home first.
- Everything is okay?

534
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:28,750
Vicky, go home first.

535
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:32,590
lt'll be fine...
Leave it to me, okay?

536
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:34,900
You can't handle it.
l'll make some calls.

537
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:36,750
lt won't be that easy.

538
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:48,790
- l don't want to go home.
- Go home and get some sleep.

539
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:56,350
He left the key of the room
and a mobile to you.

540
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:17,910
Vicky, it's me.

541
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:21,190
l'm in Japan.

542
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,750
You were deep asleep,
so l didn't wake you.

543
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:28,070
Doze is in deep shit.

544
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:30,390
And l haven't solved the problem yet.

545
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:34,230
l may have to stay in Japan
for a while.

546
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:41,510
l'm at the Koryu lnn in Shinjuku.

547
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:48,300
The number is 33 69 55 26.

548
01:29:49,070 --> 01:29:51,630
33 69 55 26.

549
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:54,750
Room number 403.

550
01:29:57,470 --> 01:29:58,790
lf you feel like...

551
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:05,070
taking a break,
come and join me here.

552
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:09,870
But don't tell anyone...

553
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:12,310
l'm in Japan.

554
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:14,590
That's all.

555
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,310
Jack, is that you?

556
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:31,110
Mr. Kao?

557
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,750
Jack never showed up.

558
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:35,510
He never called either.

559
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:39,980
lt snowed in Tokyo that winter.

560
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:45,350
She wandered around
with the cell-phone

561
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:47,550
Jack left for her.

562
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:53,750
The crowded streets
were full of workers, students,

563
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:56,510
housewives.

564
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:00,830
She pretended to be one of them.

565
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:05,750
She ate noodles. Watched TVshows.

566
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:10,820
Hung Jack's coat
around her shoulders.

567
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:16,390
lt smelt of after-shave
and cigarettes.

568
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:24,580
Finally she sensed
that Jack was missing her.

569
01:35:24,990 --> 01:35:26,710
When he suggested
that she could come...

570
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:32,500
and said not to tell anyone
he was in Japan,

571
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:36,750
it all really meant... 'You comel'

572
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:39,310
'Come alonel'

573
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,540
'Yubari's Road of cinema.'

574
01:36:18,350 --> 01:36:19,580
Ko told her

575
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:23,070
that Yubari's winters are very cold.

576
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:25,350
Minus 30° Celsius.

577
01:36:28,910 --> 01:36:32,430
lt's the country of snowman.

578
01:36:34,230 --> 01:36:36,910
When the sun rises, the snowman

579
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:39,030
melts and vanishes.

580
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:44,270
Once,
she was making love with Hao-hao...

581
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:47,990
she suddenly had the feeling

582
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:50,820
Hao-hao was just like the snowman.

583
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:52,630
He would vanish...

584
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:56,950
as soon as the sun came up.

585
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:03,310
Making love was sad that day.

586
01:37:05,590 --> 01:37:07,310
Even years later,

587
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:09,750
she still remembered it.

588
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:15,310
This happened ten years ago.

589
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:19,950
Back in the year 2001.

590
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:23,740
That year...

591
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:29,110
there was heavy snow in Yubari.
