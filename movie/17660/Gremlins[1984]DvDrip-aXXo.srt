1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,720
Friends, let me introduce myself.

2
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,200
Peltzer's the name.
Rand Peltzer.

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,520
That's me there on the corner.

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,440
I'm an inventor.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,680
And I have a story to tell.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,400
I know.
Who hasn 't got a story?

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,360
Well, nobody's got a story
like this one.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,160
Nobody.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,800
It all started here in Chinatown.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,680
I was trying
to move a little merchandise...

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,160
...maybe find a present
for my kid.

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,440
I tried this one place.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,720
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,560
What's down here?

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,920
This is it.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,440
This is your grandfather's store?

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,640
Come on.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,960
No wonder you gotta drag
people in off the street.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,520
Go ahead, mister.
Look around.

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,760
See if there's something you like.

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,840
Are these things real?

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,560
I told you. Everything's real.

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,160
You do have
interesting artifacts here...

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,160
...but there's one thing
you don't have.

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,480
And what's that?

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,000
Let me show you.
I'm an inventor. I made this.

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,640
The Bathroom Buddy.
The invention of the century.

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,000
It eliminates the need to carry
heavy luggage when you travel.

29
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,080
You got yourself
your shaving mirror...

30
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,200
...your toothbrush, a toothpick.
You got toenail clippers...

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,240
...a nail file...

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,960
...and you got yourself
a dental mirror.

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,240
This is gonna revolutionize traveling.

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,200
Let's just say,
for the sake of argument...

35
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,680
...that you're on a bus,
a plane or a train.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,920
You forgot to brush your teeth.

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,880
You got yourself a bad case
of dragon breath.

38
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,840
Bad breath.

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,880
What do you do?

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,040
No problem, friend.
All you do is...

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,880
...you take your toothbrush out...

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,760
...and you push this button.

43
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,960
That's absolutely no problem.

44
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,600
Cleans up easily.

45
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,560
What I'd like to do, sir,
is give you my card.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,960
Rand Peltzer. "Fantastic Ideas
for a Fantastic World. "

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,600
I make the illogical logical.

48
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,080
I can get you these.

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,560
I can get them by the dozen
if you'd like.

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,760
What do you think?

51
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,800
What do you think?

52
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,600
Where's that coming from?

53
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,960
What is that?

54
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,320
Mogwai.

55
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,560
What's he doing?

56
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,960
Singing.

57
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,760
He does that sometimes.

58
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,920
I gotta have him.
He's incredible.

59
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,120
Tell you what I'll do.

60
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,240
I'll give you $ 100 for him.

61
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,520
I've gotta have him. It's a present
for my son for Christmas.

62
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,400
It's what I've been looking for.

63
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,000
I've been everywhere.
I'll give you $200.

64
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,680
That's $200!

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,240
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,360
Mogwai not for sale.

67
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,800
You said everything here was for sale.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,960
Grandfather!

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,760
With mogwai comes much responsibility.

70
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,160
I cannot sell him at any price.

71
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,440
Wait outside. I'll be right out.

72
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,960
Just go.

73
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,960
Okay, mister. Here it is.

74
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,240
What about your grandfather?

75
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,120
Forget what he said. He's crazy.
We need the money.

76
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,760
Do you want it or not?

77
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,160
I want it.

78
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,400
There's three rules
you've gotta follow.

79
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,960
What kind of rules?

80
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,560
Keep him out of the light.

81
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,560
He hates bright light,
especially sunlight.

82
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,920
It'll kill him.

83
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,560
And keep him away from water.
Don 't get him wet.

84
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,400
But the most important rule,
the rule you can never forget...

85
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,720
...no matter how much he cries
or how much he begs...

86
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,640
...never, never feed him
after midnight. Got it?

87
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,160
Sure. Whatever you say.

88
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,040
Thanks.
And have a Merry Christmas.

89
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,200
You're rolling with
Rockin ' Ricky Rialto...

90
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,120
...the voice of Kingston Falls, U. S.A.!

91
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,560
Alex... .

92
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,600
Getting close to Christmas.

93
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,040
You'll get stuck
with a lot of trees again.

94
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,200
I thought I'd be seeing you
about this time.

95
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,720
What the hell is this?

96
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,280
What are you doing in there?

97
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't ask.

98
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
Alex, I came to get my tree.

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,320
Pete, take that tree
to Mr. Anderson's truck.

100
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,400
What do you say, Alex?

101
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
You can spare one
for the sheriff's station.

102
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,280
I paid for mine, Frank.

103
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,000
Billy, you need a jump?

104
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,360
No, thanks, Mr. Futterman.
I'm late for work as it is.

105
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,320
These goddamn foreign cars
always freeze up on you.

106
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,600
You don't find American
machinery doing that.

107
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,960
See that plow?

108
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,640
Hasn't given me a day's trouble
in 15 years.

109
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,480
You know why?
Kentucky Harvester.

110
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,680
It ain't some foreign piece of crap.
That's a Kentucky Harvester.

111
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,040
If I wanna keep my job,
I should be going now.

112
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,920
How's your comic strip coming?

113
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,040
I expect to see you in the funnies
with "Smilin' Jack," "Li'I Abner. "

114
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,440
They don't run those comics anymore.

115
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
They don't?

116
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,760
Come on, Barn.

117
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,360
Say hello to your wife, okay?

118
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,960
So long, Billy.

119
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,160
Goddamn foreign cars.

120
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,600
Hey, doctor.

121
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,160
Morning, Billy.

122
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,760
Get in there and be quiet.

123
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,760
- You just made it.
- Again.

124
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,840
Will you sign this petition?

125
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,840
Sure. What's it for?

126
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,000
To declare Dorry's pub a landmark.

127
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,560
Mrs. Deagle's trying to take
his lease away.

128
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,760
His too?

129
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,120
Yeah, she says it's a dive,
a public nuisance.

130
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,240
That's where my dad
proposed to my mom.

131
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,960
That's where everybody's dad
proposed to their mom. Cross your "T. "

132
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Thanks.

133
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,800
Good morning, Mrs. Deagle.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,560
What's good about it?

135
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,000
Klutz!

136
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,240
Watch it, watch it!

137
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,440
40, 60, 80... .

138
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,480
200. Thank you.

139
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,160
- Mrs. Deagle?
- What?

140
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,200
I just wanted you to know
that Joe got another job.

141
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,680
My husband, Joe Harris.

142
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,560
And I've taken up some sewing.

143
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,480
What are you trying to tell me?

144
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,560
Neither of us will be paid
for two weeks.

145
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,640
Couldn't you get Mr. Corben...

146
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,920
...to give us a little more time?

147
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,000
Mrs. Harris...

148
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,600
...the bank and I have
the same purpose in life:

149
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,640
To make money.

150
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,440
Not to support a lot of...

151
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,760
...deadbeats.

152
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,560
Mrs. Deagle, it's Christmas!

153
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,360
Now you know what to ask Santa for,
don't you?

154
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,080
Mommy, I'm hungry.

155
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,600
Yes, honey. So am I.

156
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,880
This is what's left
of my imported Bavarian snowman.

157
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,760
Your dog broke it this morning!

158
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,560
I'm terribly sorry.

159
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,240
Tell me how much I owe you...

160
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,960
I don't want money.

161
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,840
I want your dog.

162
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,960
Barney?

163
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
Give him to me.

164
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,840
I'll take him to the kennel.
They'll put him to sleep.

165
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,200
It'll be quick and painless,
compared to what I could do to him.

166
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,280
What could you do?

167
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,800
I'll catch the beast myself.

168
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Then he'll get what he deserves.

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,440
A slow, painful death.

170
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,000
Maybe I'll put him in my spin dryer
on high heat.

171
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,280
That'd do it.

172
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,720
Barney, will you get off of her?

173
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,400
My dear lady, are you all right?

174
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,720
I have a very weak heart.
I can't stand a shock like that!

175
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,800
What is that dog doing in here?

176
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,640
This is a bank, not a pet store.

177
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,800
Very good, Gerald.

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,240
He wouldn't hurt you.

179
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,240
Excuses, excuses.
You're just like your father.

180
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,560
I've listened to his excuses
for 10 years, the loser!

181
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,560
As for you, you mangy cur...

182
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,520
...I'll get you...

183
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,160
...when you least expect it!

184
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,960
Oh, my heart!

185
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,960
I must apologize
for this most unusual... .

186
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,760
You putz.

187
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,600
The old bat never looked better.

188
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,640
It's great. You're doing fine.

189
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,400
Thanks.

190
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,200
Hello, Gerald.

191
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,360
If it isn't Captain Clip-on.

192
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,840
Guess who almost applied
for unemployment today?

193
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,240
- I give up.
- You.

194
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,160
But Mr. Corben had second thoughts.

195
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,920
He gets so sentimental
about the holidays.

196
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,760
Imagine that.

197
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,360
I would've fired you in a second.

198
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,760
Merry Christmas to you too.

199
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,760
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

200
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,960
Hey, Peltzer.

201
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Look, I'm a junior
vice president at 23.

202
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,600
By the time I'm 25,
I'm gonna have Mr. Corben's job.

203
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,080
By the time I'm 30,
I'll be a millionaire.

204
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,080
Look at you.

205
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,840
You're practically supporting
your whole family.

206
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,000
The world's changing.

207
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,560
You gotta change with it.
You gotta be tough.

208
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,840
Tough? And no one's
tougher than you, Ger?

209
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,360
Don't call me that.
My name's Gerald.

210
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,800
Can I get you a drink?

211
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,320
Give me a vodka martini.
Shake, don't stir.

212
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
You work here?

213
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,200
Weeknights, so Dorry doesn't
have to pay an extra waitress.

214
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,240
That's great.

215
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,640
Yeah, that's swell, if you
like working for nothing.

216
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,960
Two more rounds for the pool table,
on the house.

217
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,840
You haven't seen my new apartment.

218
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,800
I haven't seen your old apartment.

219
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,160
We're talking cable.
Can we have dinner tomorrow night?

220
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,960
I'm working.

221
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,200
Why don't you tell Dorry you're sick?
He can't dock your pay.

222
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,440
Billy, is that you?

223
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,120
Yeah, Mom. It's me.

224
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,200
I'm in the kitchen.

225
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
Merry Christmas!

226
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,680
Merry Christmas, movie house!

227
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,280
Merry Christmas, emporium!

228
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,960
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

229
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,760
Do you need any help?

230
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,040
Yeah, you could do the eggs.

231
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,760
Thanks.

232
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,320
Dad's machines work so well
the first couple of weeks, then... .

233
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,960
Use the sink.

234
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,960
Is something wrong?

235
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,960
No, it's a sad movie.

236
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,720
How was your day?

237
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,160
It was fine.

238
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,920
Come on, what is it?
What's wrong?

239
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,760
Mrs. Deagle called again
this afternoon.

240
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let's not talk about it now.
Don't say anything to Dad.

241
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,400
Fine with me.

242
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,080
Don we now our gay apparel

243
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,840
Hi, sweetheart!

244
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,480
- Welcome home.
- Hey, Dad.

245
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,160
I'm glad you're back.
How was the trip?

246
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,200
It was great.

247
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,040
The Miracle Company, who has
the Kitchen Companion...

248
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,000
...might be interested
in the Bathroom Buddy.

249
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,560
Great!

250
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,920
- Thanks!
- You'll like this.

251
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,360
What is it? A birdcage?

252
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,240
No, don't shake it. Open it now.
It won't wait till Christmas.

253
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,600
It's a puppy, isn't it?

254
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,360
Yeah, I can tell.

255
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,960
It's a new car.

256
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,400
- Honey, would you dim the lights?
- Sure.

257
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,920
Dim the lights?
Does it glow in the dark?

258
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,520
It's important. Trust me.

259
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,360
Go ahead, open it.

260
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,000
What is it?

261
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,720
It's your new pet.

262
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,760
Come on, Barney.
Be a good dog.

263
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,960
You're kidding.

264
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,560
Dad, it's really neat.

265
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,520
Where'd you get this?

266
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,120
Some little junk store in Chinatown.

267
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,200
Can I pick him up?

268
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,240
Sure, go ahead. Just be careful.

269
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,920
- You gotta be gentle.
- I will.

270
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,680
I hope he's housebroken.

271
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,360
Isn't he cute?

272
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,840
Has it got a name?

273
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,240
Mogwai.

274
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,480
Some Chinese word.
I just call him...

275
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,160
...Gizmo.
He seems to like it.

276
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,960
Look up here a minute.

277
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,000
We're getting our picture taken.

278
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,160
Smile.

279
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,520
Ready?

280
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,280
One, two, three... .

281
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,800
Bright light!

282
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,080
What happened?

283
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,960
He hates bright lights.

284
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,440
There's some important things
I forgot to tell you.

285
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,560
Number one, he hates bright lights.
You gotta keep him out of the sunlight.

286
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,760
Sunlight will kill him.

287
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,520
Number two, keep him
away from water.

288
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,600
Don't give him any water to drink.
Whatever you do, don't give him a bath.

289
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,040
And the most important thing...

290
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,960
...don't ever feed him
after midnight.

291
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,400
Looks like you hurt yourself.

292
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,360
Light bright! Light bright!

293
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,560
Just sit down there
and don't fall off, okay?

294
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,960
I'll get you fixed up in no time.

295
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,160
All right.

296
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,360
Hold still.

297
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,560
Sorry. Sorry.

298
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,760
Try not to move so much, okay?

299
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,360
Good night, Giz.
I'll see you in the morning.

300
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,880
I got a tree!

301
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,560
Oh, Christ!

302
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,880
Billy!

303
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,160
I just brought in
your Christmas tree.

304
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,840
What happened?

305
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,000
Slight problem
with the Peltzer Peeler-Juicer.

306
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,560
I thought your dad fixed it.

307
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,360
I thought so too.

308
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,760
You should just buy orange juice
in cartons. It's a lot easier.

309
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,760
See, it works.

310
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,840
- I had to come.
- So I see.

311
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,920
Now I can see. It takes...

312
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,600
...a certain kind of guy.

313
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,560
And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.

314
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,680
It's no problem, Pete.
Leave it up here.

315
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,000
What'll you tell him?

316
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,040
I'll just tell him a bunch of bikers
stole it from me on my way home.

317
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,960
Wow! The Hooded Menace.
Issue number one!

318
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,400
Pretty neat, huh?

319
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,960
Where'd you get it?

320
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,560
Dr. Fantasy's, I think.

321
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,800
What's that?

322
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,560
Come here. I'll show you.

323
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
This is my new pet.
My dad gave him to me.

324
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,560
Neat! What's his name?

325
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,920
His name's Gizmo. Hi, Giz.

326
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,760
He's a mogwai.

327
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,360
Cute!

328
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,760
Blink your eyes.

329
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Go like that.
Can you do that?

330
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,960
Watch. Maybe he'll sing.

331
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,400
Come on, Giz.
Let's go over to the table.

332
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,960
I'll be careful.

333
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,160
There we go.

334
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,640
Gee, Billy, where
can I get one of those?

335
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,560
I don't know.
This is the only one I've ever seen.

336
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,560
Can I hold him?

337
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,360
Sure. I don't see why not.
He seems to like you.

338
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,560
Great! Thanks a lot.

339
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,960
Sorry.

340
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,960
What was in that jar?

341
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,600
Nothing! Just water!

342
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,080
Why is he making that noise?

343
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,400
What is it?

344
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,360
I don't know.

345
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,560
Is it alive?

346
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,480
I don't know.

347
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,360
One, two, three,
four, five new ones.

348
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,000
Now can I have one?

349
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
I don't know.

350
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,880
Look, that one's got
a cute stripe on its head.

351
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,000
Isn't that incredible, Pete?

352
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,960
Yeah, great.

353
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,240
Don't you think this...?
This is incredible!

354
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,880
Oh, it is neat.

355
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,160
I'm serious. It's neat.

356
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,280
Gizmo, what's the matter?

357
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,400
- There's something I should tell you.
- Look.

358
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,520
You're familiar
with the Bathroom Buddy?

359
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,000
I have made an improvement.

360
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Watch this.

361
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,160
Now, let's say you're
late for the big meeting.

362
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,680
It's really important.

363
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,720
You're on your way. You reach up.
You forgot to shave.

364
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,800
What're you gonna do?
Under normal circumstances...

365
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,720
...you are in trouble.

366
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,560
But not if you have
the Bathroom Buddy.

367
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,560
Watch this.

368
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,960
What do you think?

369
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,120
That's pretty neat.

370
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
What's this button?

371
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,360
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's okay.

372
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,360
I'm sorry.

373
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,000
It's not your fault. I'm working
on that. I haven't finished that.

374
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,560
I came up here because
there's a problem with the mogwai.

375
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,240
Yeah, what's that?

376
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,400
It multiplies with water.

377
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,160
Do you see what I mean?

378
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,840
I don't believe that.

379
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,840
All that from water?
They got wet?

380
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,360
Plain water.

381
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,560
It's funny.
The new ones aren't like Gizmo.

382
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,800
The striped one
seems to be the leader.

383
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You know what?

384
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,360
I'll bet every kid in America
would like one of these.

385
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,000
They might replace
the dog as the family pet.

386
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,240
Think about it.

387
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,360
The Peltzer Pet.

388
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,560
This could really be the big one.

389
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,960
Barney, who did this to you?

390
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,840
Hold on, I'll get you down.

391
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,360
Stay still.

392
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,960
Poor dog. Another minute
and he would've been a dog-sicle.

393
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,360
All I know is that I'm positive
that I closed and locked the door.

394
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,360
How else did she get to him?

395
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,560
We can't point any fingers,
not even at Mrs. Deagle.

396
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,560
She's been threatening him.
She'd love to get her hands on him.

397
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,680
We don't have proof. We can't even
find footprints leading up to the house.

398
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,240
I'm gonna take Barney
to your grandmother's.

399
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,840
Take him there on the way to the
convention, pick him up on the way home.

400
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,560
He'll be here for Christmas.
It'll be all right.

401
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,960
I don't think we can drink this.

402
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,960
Why not?

403
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,960
What's wrong with this?

404
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,960
Is that a mogwai.

405
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah, I'm gonna have
Mr. Hanson check it out.

406
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,760
And all of a sudden, there were
five new ones like this one.

407
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,960
Now watch this.

408
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,000
Can I keep one of these here,
run some tests on him?

409
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,040
I think I can spare one.

410
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,640
This is some Christmas, Katie,
I'll tell you.

411
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,680
First the old bat closes the factory,
and now it's my goddamn plow.

412
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,800
Mr. Futterman, guess what?
It's time to go home now.

413
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,160
- How about one more beer?
- No, it's late.

414
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,200
One more beer,
I'll help you clean up.

415
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,000
No, thanks, though.
It'll be okay.

416
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,240
- It'll be okay.
- It will not be okay.

417
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,440
I brought my plow in for a tune-up
and found it loaded with foreign parts.

418
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,840
I mean, everything.
Gaskets, pistons, spark plugs.

419
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,800
All of it's foreign.

420
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,400
Going home?

421
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,120
Gremlins!

422
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
You gotta watch out for foreigners.

423
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,840
They plant gremlins
in their machinery.

424
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,720
The same gremlins brought down
our planes in the big one.

425
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,840
That's right.

426
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,520
World War II.

427
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,680
Good old...

428
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,200
...W- W-l-I.

429
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,400
They're still shipping them over here.

430
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,400
They put them in the cars, the TV.

431
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,240
They put them in the radios
you stick in your ears.

432
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,200
They put them in the watches.
Little teeny gremlins.

433
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,760
It's not a good idea that you drive.
Why don't you walk home?

434
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,040
You know, Katie, I think
maybe I'll walk home.

435
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,080
Good.

436
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,200
It's a nice night.

437
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,600
Good night, kids.

438
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,200
Gremlins.

439
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,080
That was really good,
the way you handled Mr. Futterman.

440
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm used to it.

441
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,200
He's been like that
ever since he lost his job.

442
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,360
He's like a lot of people around here.
He just wants somebody to listen.

443
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,400
Especially around the holidays.

444
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,880
Why is that?

445
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,800
It's when a lot of people
get really depressed.

446
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,560
I always thought everyone was happy
during the holidays, no matter what.

447
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,280
Most people are, but some aren't.

448
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,440
While everybody else opens up presents,
they're opening up their wrists.

449
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,640
Cheery thought.

450
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,400
It's true. The suicide rate's
always the highest around the holidays.

451
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,600
Now I'm depressed.

452
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Do you ever get depressed on Christmas?

453
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,040
I don't celebrate Christmas.

454
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,560
Are you Hindu or something?

455
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,600
No, I just don't like to.

456
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,400
What's not to like?
I mean, it's a lot of fun.

457
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,680
God!

458
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,280
Say you hate Thanksgiving,
and nobody cares.

459
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,800
But say you hate Christmas, everybody
makes you feel like you're a leper.

460
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,080
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

461
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,400
I'm sorry. I'm just
a little tired and cranky.

462
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,040
Thanks for walking me home.

463
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,200
No problem.

464
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,000
Good night.

465
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,640
I was just wondering. Do you
get any free nights off from Dorry's?

466
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,160
Thursdays.

467
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,560
Thursdays, yeah.

468
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,240
Because I was just wondering...

469
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,760
...if you're free this Thursday night,
maybe you'd like to go out on a date...

470
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,760
...with me?

471
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,080
I'd love to.

472
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,800
Well, that's great!

473
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,360
We can talk about it
on the phone and kind of...

474
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,400
...square everything away.

475
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,800
Good night, Billy.

476
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,400
Hey, there.

477
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,840
Give me your arm, boy.
Come here, come on.

478
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,800
Give me your arm.
No, this is not gonna hurt.

479
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,440
This isn't gonna hurt.

480
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,000
Not a big guy like you. Come on.

481
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,000
There you go.
See, that's not so bad. Come on.

482
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,000
Good, good.
Oh, that's good.

483
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,960
Just a little blood test, pal.
You'll never miss it.

484
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,200
They're like huge seed pods!

485
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,880
- Having fun?
- Fun!

486
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,240
Pretty neat, huh?

487
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,600
Neat!

488
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,440
How about shutting up
for a change, okay?

489
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,200
I already fed you.

490
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,040
Well, it's not 12:00 yet.

491
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,560
All right. Keep an eye on them, Giz.
I'll be back in a second.

492
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,280
Here we go.

493
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,280
Now maybe you guys will be quiet.

494
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,320
You guys are really hungry.

495
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,800
Giz, you want some?

496
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,000
Do you want some chicken?

497
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,200
That's it, good buddy.
Call it a night.

498
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,680
Can 't you see?
They're after you!

499
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,360
They're after all of us!
Our wives, our children, everyone!

500
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,080
They're here already!
You're next!

501
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,800
You're next!
You're next! You're next!

502
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,000
Mom, could you come up here, please?

503
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,000
Then I want you to bring
the vacuum cleaner upstairs for me.

504
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,040
What are they?

505
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,880
Well, they're the mogwai, I guess.

506
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,400
Except for Gizmo.

507
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,800
Did you get them wet?

508
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,680
Did you feed them
after midnight?

509
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
Well, I gave them
some chicken.

510
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,600
But I made sure that it...

511
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,080
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

512
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,000
I made sure... .

513
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,800
What's going on here?

514
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,760
What'd you say this was called?

515
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,760
A putrid stage?

516
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,560
Pupal. Pupal stage.

517
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,280
Like a butterfly.

518
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,360
Yeah, right.

519
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,240
This is a cocoon, and inside
he's going through changes.

520
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,600
Lots of changes.

521
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,400
Like my mother.

522
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,000
No, that's different.

523
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,600
This is called a metamorphosis.

524
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,880
It's a change in form...

525
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,000
...and in appearance.

526
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,640
Hi, honey!

527
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,200
No, I'm sure it works fine.

528
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,520
I was just out on the back porch
for a second.

529
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,000
The convention's great.

530
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,640
I said it's great!

531
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,440
Actually, the competition's... .

532
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,480
Sorry, miss.

533
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,440
The competition's a little more
advanced than I expected.

534
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,400
- I was giving myself an oil change.
- Some really neat things.

535
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,520
Oh, Rand.

536
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,280
You've never been so far
away on Christmas Eve before.

537
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,160
I know it's Christmas Eve.

538
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,080
I'll do the best I can.

539
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,960
All right. Bye-bye.

540
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,200
All I could get for it was $36!

541
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,000
If there's anything I can do... .
But it's completely out of my hands.

542
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,680
I'll be delighted...

543
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,800
Hello, Gerald.
I'm under such terrible pressure.

544
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,680
Why don't you just
speak to Mrs. Deagle about it?

545
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,040
Speak to Mrs. Deagle?

546
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,800
Mrs. Deagle!

547
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,400
Deposit this to my account.

548
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,000
Where's that psychotic canine?

549
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,080
Still hiding under the counter?

550
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,680
No, I'm afraid he's on vacation.

551
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,760
Better keep him behind locked doors,
because if I catch him...

552
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,120
...he's in for a slow death.

553
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,240
Here's Mr. Bird's heart.

554
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,800
Small animals lose heat
faster than large ones.

555
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,080
Their blood must circulate
faster to keep their bodies warm.

556
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,480
Now, in small birds...

557
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,440
...their hearts beat
about 600 times per minute.

558
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,600
Cats, 130.

559
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,320
Man, about 75...

560
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,080
...and a big old elephant's heart,
only 25 a minute.

561
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,280
Hey, doc, you
got a human heart?

562
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,000
Has he got a human heart?
Wait till you see this! Roll 10.

563
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,840
Okay, class.
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas.

564
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,040
If any of you wanna bring me
a present...

565
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,400
...a cassette deck wouldn't be bad.

566
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Of course, tickets to the Super Bowl
would be very nice.

567
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,600
Mr. Hanson, wait.
Let me just talk to you for a second.

568
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
Bye.

569
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,760
It just hatched.

570
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,640
I'll be right there.

571
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,360
Hey, there.

572
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,680
You remember me?

573
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,400
Remember me, don't you?

574
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,800
I went and got you...

575
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,600
...a candy bar.

576
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,000
I thought you might be hungry.

577
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,600
You hungry?

578
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,920
You should try one of these.

579
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,800
Hey, there.

580
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,080
Come here. Don't be afraid.
There's no reason to be afraid.

581
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,600
Where'd you go?

582
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,440
Where are you?
I know you're in there.

583
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,400
I know you're under there.

584
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,600
Come on, now.

585
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,480
You're not still angry
about that little blood test, are you?

586
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,800
Come on out.
Take a bite. Let me see you.

587
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,520
I just wanna see you.

588
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,400
You try some of this now.
I know you gotta be hungry.

589
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,280
There now. Don't you feel better?

590
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,000
Gizmo ca-ca!

591
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,400
Billy, are you okay?
Where are you?

592
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,120
Mom, they hatched.
Get out of the house.

593
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,560
Phone home. Ca-ca!

594
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,280
Get out of my kitchen!

595
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,080
Neat!

596
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,600
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

597
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,400
Mom, it's Stripe!

598
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,000
Should I get it?

599
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,000
Yeah, go ahead and get it.

600
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,000
Oh, I didn't mean that.

601
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,800
Hello, Dr. Molinaro. Can we come in?

602
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
My mom's had a bit of an accident.

603
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,800
Be careful!

604
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,400
What happened?

605
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,840
Giz?

606
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,240
Bright light! Bright light!

607
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,800
Come here.

608
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,800
They almost got you, huh?

609
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,000
Climb in here.

610
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,800
The question is
totally without meaning.

611
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,200
Pardon me, sir. Stuff.

612
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,200
Thick and heavy.

613
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,000
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?

614
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,120
I rarely use it myself, sir.
It promotes rust.

615
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,200
Don't worry, Giz. We'll find him.

616
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,040
Gremlins, huh?

617
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,160
- Little monsters.
- Right.

618
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,160
Hundreds of them?

619
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,400
I'm not sure.
Maybe thousands.

620
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,440
Look, I know it sounds crazy.
I know it does.

621
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,080
But in a matter of hours,
this town's gonna be a disaster area.

622
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,680
You've got to warn people!

623
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,800
- You think this kid is drunk?
- No, but you are.

624
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,160
I am not drunk!

625
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:32,400
Tell me something. Where do
these little gremlins come from?

626
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,720
All right.

627
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,200
My father gave me one as a present.

628
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,800
Does your father always
give you vicious little monsters?

629
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,680
No, they don't
start out vicious at first!

630
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,080
Of course not.

631
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,400
They don't!
They look like this.

632
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,200
Could you dim the lights?

633
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,840
Sure.

634
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,560
Go ahead, Brent.
Dim the lights.

635
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,400
Gusto!

636
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,920
'Tis the season to be jolly

637
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,400
Right, Murray?

638
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,600
Sheila, will you quit messing
with the TV?

639
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,400
You have the thingy.

640
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,400
Goddamn foreign TV.

641
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,560
We should've got a Zenith!

642
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,680
Foreigners.

643
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,800
I can't get a damn thing on this!

644
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,800
Where are you going?

645
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,080
I'm gonna check the antenna.
Maybe the damn thing blew down.

646
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,920
Be careful, dear.

647
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,000
What the hell is that?

648
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,960
- It's them!
- You're crazy!

649
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,800
There's a real gremlin in my cab!

650
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,840
Hello, Anderson.
Wanna mail something, do you?

651
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,960
Just a last-minute package, Father.

652
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,440
Be my guest.

653
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,800
That's strange.

654
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,680
Patriotic little fellow, ain't he?

655
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,800
Waving the flag and everything.

656
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,360
Be careful, Frank!
He might tear your arm off.

657
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,640
You want me to put the cuffs on him?

658
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,280
Tell me. How come
a cute guy like this...

659
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,880
...can turn into
a thousand ugly monsters?

660
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,040
You see, this is before
it enters the pupal stage.

661
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,600
Plus, it multiplies with water.

662
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,560
- Get the kid some water.
- I wouldn't do that.

663
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,200
Sheriff's office.

664
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,200
Yeah, speaking.

665
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,560
What?

666
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,200
Yeah, sure, we'll be right over.

667
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,200
What happened?

668
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,960
The Futtermans.

669
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,080
Something about a snowplow.
A freak accident.

670
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,560
It's the creatures!

671
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,000
The creatures are making it
look like an accident!

672
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,720
Will you listen to me?

673
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,600
You listen to me, kid!

674
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,880
Go on home, take little Gizmo...

675
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,240
...sit by the fireplace
and open your Christmas presents.

676
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,800
Attaboy.

677
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,360
- Let me drive.
- No, you're drunk.

678
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,600
You always drive!

679
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,920
Because I'm the sheriff, asshole.

680
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,600
Kopeck, you stop that, you bad kitty!

681
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,240
Kopeck's a bad kitty.

682
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,600
Ruble's a good little kitty.

683
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,760
We'll find you something to eat.
She's a good kitty.

684
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,800
Here we go. Here we go. Come on.

685
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,480
All right, you stop that!

686
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,200
Stop it!

687
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,840
Mean kitty, you start eating
before everybody gets here.

688
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,640
Come on, Dollar Bill.

689
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,440
Yes, here we go, Dollar Bill.

690
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,760
Mommy'll fix you
something good to eat.

691
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,320
Everybody here?

692
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,320
All right, let go of Mommy's coat.

693
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,480
Here.

694
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,400
Christmas carolers.

695
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,640
I hate Christmas carolers.

696
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,600
Screechy-voiced little glue-sniffers.

697
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,200
I warned you brats!

698
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,280
What are they?

699
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,400
What are they?!

700
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,360
They're here!

701
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,600
They've come for me!
They've come!

702
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,680
I'm not ready.

703
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,760
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not ready!

704
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,000
My God, Frye!

705
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,720
That was Mrs. Deagle.

706
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,160
Get them off! Get them off! Help me!

707
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,120
That's Dave Myers.
He does Santa every year.

708
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,000
What the hell is he doing now?

709
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,800
What's that stuff he's
got all over him?

710
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,400
Frank, I really think
we should go now.

711
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,640
Start the car. I'd really like
to go back to the station.

712
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,360
Please!

713
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,160
Jesus, Frank!

714
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,920
What the hell are those things?

715
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,360
It's Christmas.
What the hell's going on?

716
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,640
Shut up, will you?!

717
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,400
I don't believe it.

718
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,480
You're on with Rockin ' Ricky! Go!

719
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,360
Hi, my name's Pete.

720
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,480
These green guys are
running around wrecking things.

721
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,000
This is Christmas, not Halloween!

722
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,240
Listen, gang.

723
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,560
Rockin ' Ricky's getting fed up
with this Orson Welles crap!

724
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,560
What's that?

725
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,280
Kitty, what's that?
Some of Rockin ' Ricky fans?

726
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,000
You're not a Rockin ' Ricky fan!

727
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,600
Sir, I notice that you're a smoker.

728
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:40,000
I notice that you're a smoker.
I see the cigarettes.

729
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,400
I noticed, here, this broken ashtray.

730
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,840
It's very fortunate
that I happened to come by.

731
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,640
Let me introduce myself. My name's
Randall Peltzer. I'm an inventor.

732
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,040
"Fantastic Ideas for a Fantastic World. "
I make the illogical logical.

733
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:57,680
I have something here that I think
you might be interested in.

734
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,800
Yes, sir, I do.

735
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,600
This is...

736
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,280
...the Peltzer Smokeless Ashtray.

737
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,320
I think this can solve
your problem here, sir.

738
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,800
Please don't bite me!

739
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,200
Wait a minute.

740
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:20,760
You all right?

741
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,400
Let's get out of here!

742
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,840
What's that?

743
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,800
Don't worry. He's with me.
He's not one of them.

744
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,000
What's wrong?
Why isn't the car starting?

745
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,200
We're gonna have to
make a run for it, okay?

746
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,640
One, two, three!

747
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,200
They've been here too.

748
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,800
What are these things?
Where do they come from?

749
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,000
They're gremlins, Kate.

750
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,400
Just like Mr. Futterman said.

751
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:37,200
Now I have another reason
to hate Christmas.

752
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,520
What are you talking about?

753
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,800
The worst thing that ever
happened to me was on Christmas.

754
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,640
Oh, God. It was so horrible.

755
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,800
It was Christmas Eve.

756
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,000
I was 9 years old.

757
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:59,120
Me and Mom were decorating the tree...

758
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,800
...waiting for Dad
to come home from work.

759
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,200
A couple hours went by.

760
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,000
Dad wasn't home.

761
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,920
So Mom called the office.
No answer.

762
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:15,800
Christmas Day came and went,
and still nothing.

763
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,600
So the police began a search.

764
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,280
Four or five days went by.

765
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,200
Neither one of us
could eat or sleep.

766
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,920
Everything was falling apart.

767
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,200
It was snowing outside.

768
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,280
The house was freezing, so I went
to try to light up the fire.

769
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,600
That's when I noticed the smell.

770
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,560
The firemen came and
broke through the chimney top.

771
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,760
And me and Mom were expecting
them to pull out a dead cat or a bird.

772
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,600
And instead they pulled out my father.

773
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,000
He was dressed
in a Santa Claus suit.

774
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,240
He'd been climbing down the chimney...

775
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,640
...his arms loaded with presents.

776
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,000
He was gonna surprise us.

777
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,000
He slipped and broke his neck.
He died instantly.

778
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,800
And that's how I found out
there was no Santa Claus.

779
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,800
Don't worry about that smoke.
It'll stop. It's guaranteed.

780
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,280
Barney, shut up!

781
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,800
Don't start with me.
I got a long way to go.

782
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,560
Shut up!

783
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,400
Where did they all go?

784
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,280
It'll be light soon.

785
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,600
I bet they're all
together someplace dark.

786
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,200
Mogwai!

787
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,480
They're inside.

788
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,040
All of them?

789
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,440
Milk Duds.

790
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,080
What are they doing?

791
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,400
They're watching Snow White.

792
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,880
And they love it.

793
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,800
Where's the boiler room?

794
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,680
It's in the back of the theater.

795
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,200
Down there.

796
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,720
Milk Duds.

797
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:10,400
Cover your mouth.
Don't breathe any gas.

798
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,160
Go.

799
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,360
Hurry up!

800
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:14,200
Go, Katie! Watch out!

801
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,000
Come on!

802
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,800
In the department store.

803
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,040
Stripe!

804
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,440
That's Stripe.
He's the leader.

805
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,600
If he gets to water,
it'll start all over again.

806
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:57,400
Take Giz. Go back and try
and find some kind of light switch.

807
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,400
Careful, Billy.

808
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,400
Ward is your snowplow headquarters.

809
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,560
Attention, Christmas shoppers.

810
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,400
Saturday morning at 8:30, we'll have
Santa Claus for all the kiddies.

811
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,880
We have the Kingston Falls...

812
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,800
Attention, shoppers.

813
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,880
Light bright!

814
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,080
Bye-bye.

815
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,680
It takes a certain kind of guy.

816
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,600
And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.

817
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,880
Water!

818
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:39,720
Gun!

819
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,960
It's been a rough night
for Rockin ' Ricky...

820
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:46,400
...but he's still on the air!

821
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:49,600
The Marines are standing by
with fire hoses.

822
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,840
Gizmo ca-ca!

823
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,000
Light bright! Light bright!

824
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,640
What the hell is that?

825
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,120
Your scarf.

826
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,240
We switch to a report...

827
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:30,360
...from the scene of
the Christmas Eve riots.

828
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:35,640
This is Lew Landers,
WDHB's Action Central News...

829
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,800
...at the site of Dorry's Tavern...

830
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:41,440
...or what used to be Dorry's Tavern,
in Kingston Falls...

831
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,000
...where officials blame...

832
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,920
...mass hysteria for the escalating
series of unexplained...

833
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:51,320
...accidents, fires and explosions
that rocked this once-peaceful town...

834
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,240
...on Christmas Eve.

835
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,400
The bizarre demise
of Mrs. Ruby Deagle, widow...

836
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,800
...of convicted stock-swindler
Donald Deagle...

837
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:02,080
Don't chew that.

838
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,560
Don't chew.

839
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,240
I bet he'd like
some chicken soup.

840
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:17,760
Honey, this is the gentleman
who sold me the mogwai.

841
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:21,960
"Sold. " An interesting choice of words.

842
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:29,440
Conflicting eyewitness reports
concerning "little green men"...

843
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,760
You teach him to watch television?

844
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,960
There was, I believe, a box.

845
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,280
Dad... .

846
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,960
Rand, your scarf.

847
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,040
I warned you.

848
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:12,800
With mogwai comes much responsibility.

849
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,400
But you didn't listen.

850
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:16,880
And you see what happens.

851
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,840
I didn't mean it.

852
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:22,320
You do with mogwai what your society...

853
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:26,520
...has done with all of nature's gifts.

854
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,760
You do not understand.

855
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:32,440
You are not ready.

856
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,840
He has something to say to you.

857
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,800
You understand what
he says when he speaks to you?

858
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,160
To hear, one has only to listen.

859
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,360
Bye, Billy.

860
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:16,040
Perhaps someday you may be ready.

861
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:18,080
Until then, mogwai...

862
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,960
...will be waiting.

863
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,360
Excuse me, sir.

864
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,200
Before you go, I wanted to tell you...

865
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:30,120
...that I am truly sorry
for what's happened.

866
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:33,400
And if you would accept it,
I'd like to...

867
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,520
...give you this small token.

868
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:38,960
There's one other one.
This is an invention of mine.

869
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:41,120
Smokeless Ashtray.

870
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,320
How did you know?

871
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:45,320
Man at gas station tried to sell me.

872
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:48,160
Latest word in technology.

873
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:50,800
Very generous of you.

874
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,760
I'm sure it will come in handy.

875
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:21,040
Well, that's the story.

876
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:25,960
So if your air conditioner goes on the
fritz, your washing machine blows up...

877
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:28,520
...or your video recorder conks out...

878
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,680
...before you call the repairman...

879
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,160
...turn on the lights,
check the closets and cupboards...

880
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,640
...look under all the beds.

881
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,800
Because you never can tell.

882
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,160
There just might be
a gremlin in your house.
