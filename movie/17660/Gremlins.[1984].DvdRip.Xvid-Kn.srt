1
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:23,962
Friends, let me introduce myself.

2
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:26,432
Peltzer's the name.
Rand Peltzer.

3
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:28,754
That's me there on the corner.

4
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,681
I'm an inventor.

5
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:32,918
And I have a story to tell.

6
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:35,637
I know.
Who hasn't got a story?

7
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:38,601
Well, nobody's got a story
like this one.

8
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:40,394
Nobody.

9
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:43,037
It all started here in Chinatown.

10
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:45,910
I was trying
to move a little merchandise...

11
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:48,392
...maybe find a present
for my kid.

12
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,673
I tried this one place.

13
00:00:55,162 --> 00:00:55,958
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,797
What's down here?

15
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:00,151
This is it.

16
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:02,672
This is your grandfather's store?

17
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:04,876
Come on.

18
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:09,200
No wonder you gotta drag
people in off the street.

19
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:16,758
Go ahead, mister.
Look around.

20
00:01:16,962 --> 00:01:18,998
See if there's something you like.

21
00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:39,071
Are these things real?

22
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:41,796
I told you. Everything's real.

23
00:01:44,162 --> 00:01:46,392
You do have
interesting artefacts here. . .

24
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:48,394
. . .but there's one thing
you don't have.

25
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,711
And what's that?

26
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:53,239
Let me show you.
I’m an inventor. I made this.

27
00:01:53,842 --> 00:01:56,879
The Bathroom Buddy.
The invention of the century.

28
00:01:57,122 --> 00:02:01,240
It eliminates the need to carry
heavy luggage when you travel.

29
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:04,315
You got yourself
your shaving mirror. . .

30
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:08,435
. . .your toothbrush, a toothpick.
You got toenail clippers. . .

31
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:10,471
. . .a nail file. . .

32
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:13,191
. . .and you got yourself
a dental mirror.

33
00:02:13,402 --> 00:02:15,472
This is gonna revolutionize travelling.

34
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:18,430
Let's just say,
for the sake of argument. . .

35
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:20,912
. . .that you're on a bus,
a plane or a train.

36
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:24,162
You forgot to brush your teeth.

37
00:02:24,802 --> 00:02:28,112
You got yourself a bad case
of dragon breath.

38
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,081
Bad breath.

39
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:32,112
What do you do?

40
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:35,276
No problem, friend.
All you do is. . .

41
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,114
. . .you take your toothbrush out. . .

42
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:38,995
. . .and you push this button.

43
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:42,194
That's absolutely no problem.

44
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:44,838
Cleans up easily.

45
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,801
What I’d like to do, sir,
is give you my card.

46
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:51,199
Rand Peltzer. " Fantastic ideas
for a Fantastic World. "

47
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:52,835
I make the illogical logical.

48
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:55,320
I can get you these.

49
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,797
I can get them by the dozen
if you'd like.

50
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:02,995
What do you think?

51
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:06,036
What do you think?

52
00:03:09,282 --> 00:03:10,840
Where's that coming from?

53
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:30,198
What is that?

54
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:31,551
Mogwai.

55
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:35,797
What's he doing?

56
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,197
Singing.

57
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:39,998
He does that sometimes.

58
00:03:45,722 --> 00:03:48,156
I gotta have him.
He's incredible.

59
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:50,350
Tell you what I’ll do.

60
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:52,479
I’ll give you $ 1 00 for him.

61
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:56,754
I’ve gotta have him. It’s a present
for my son for Christmas.

62
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:58,634
It’s what I’ve been looking for.

63
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:01,231
I’ve been everywhere.
I’ll give you $200.

64
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:02,915
That's $200!

65
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:04,476
I’m sorry.

66
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:07,595
Mogwai not for sale.

67
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,032
You said everything here was for sale.

68
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:12,197
Grandfather!

69
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:15,997
With mogwai comes much responsibility.

70
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:19,399
I cannot sell him at any price.

71
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:27,675
Wait outside. I’ll be right out.

72
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:29,201
Just go.

73
00:04:38,682 --> 00:04:41,196
Okay, mister. Here it is.

74
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,476
What about your grandfather?

75
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:46,355
Forget what he said. He's crazy.
We need the money.

76
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:47,995
Do you want it or not?

77
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:49,396
I want it.

78
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,642
There's three rules
you've gotta follow.

79
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:55,201
What kind of rules?

80
00:04:55,482 --> 00:04:56,801
Keep him out of the light.

81
00:04:57,002 --> 00:04:59,800
He hates bright light,
especially sunlight.

82
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:01,151
It’ll kill him.

83
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:04,798
And keep him away from water.
Don 't get him wet.

84
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:08,631
But the most important rule,
the rule you can never forget...

85
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,959
...no matter how much he cries
or how much he begs...

86
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:15,877
...never, never feed him
after midnight. Got it?

87
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,401
Sure. Whatever you say.

88
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:20,275
Thanks.
And have a Merry Christmas.

89
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:30,441
You're rolling with
Rockin' Ricky Rialto...

90
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:33,355
... the voice of Kingston Falls, U.S.A.!

91
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:06,801
Alex. . . .

92
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:08,840
Getting close to Christmas.

93
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:11,277
You’ll get stuck
with a lot of trees again.

94
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:14,434
I thought I’d be seeing you
about this time.

95
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:15,961
What the hell is this?

96
00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:18,520
What are you doing in there?

97
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:20,235
Don't ask.

98
00:06:20,482 --> 00:06:22,632
Alex, I came to get my tree.

99
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,561
Pete, take that tree
to Mr. Anderson's truck.

100
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:28,636
What do you say, Alex?

101
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:30,873
You can spare one
for the sheriff's station.

102
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:33,516
I paid for mine, Frank.

103
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,240
Billy, you need a jump?

104
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:24,600
No, thanks, Mr. Futterman.
I’m late for work as it is.

105
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:27,561
These goddamn foreign cars
always freeze up on you.

106
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:30,840
You don't find American
machinery doing that.

107
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:32,191
See that plow?

108
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:34,871
Hasn't given me a day's trouble
in 1 5 years.

109
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:36,720
You know why?
Kentucky Harvester.

110
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:40,915
It ain't some foreign piece of crap.
That's a Kentucky Harvester.

111
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:44,280
lf I wanna keep my job,
I should be going now.

112
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:46,154
How's your comic strip coming?

113
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:50,277
I expect to see you in the funnies
with " Smilin' Jack," " Li'l Abner. "

114
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:52,677
They don't run those comics anymore.

115
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:54,076
They don't?

116
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:55,995
Come on, Barn.

117
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:58,598
Say hello to your wife, okay?

118
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:00,201
So long, Billy.

119
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:06,392
Goddamn foreign cars.

120
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:30,838
Hey, doctor.

121
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:32,395
Morning, Billy.

122
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:07,991
Get in there and be quiet.

123
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,996
-You just made it.
-Again.

124
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:30,075
Will you sign this petition?

125
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:32,079
Sure. What's it for?

126
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:34,238
To declare Dorry's pub a landmark.

127
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:36,791
Mrs. Deagle's trying to take
his lease away.

128
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:37,992
His too?

129
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,353
Yeah, she says it's a dive,
a public nuisance.

130
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:43,473
That's where my dad
proposed to my mom.

131
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:47,197
That's where everybody's dad
proposed to their mom. Cross your " T. "

132
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:52,311
Thanks.

133
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:01,035
Good morning, Mrs. Deagle.

134
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:02,800
What's good about it?

135
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,236
Klutz!

136
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:11,474
Watch it, watch it!

137
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:14,681
40, 60, 80. . . .

138
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:23,717
200. Thank you.

139
00:10:24,162 --> 00:10:25,390
-Mrs. Deagle?

-What?

140
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:28,435
I just wanted you to know
that Joe got another job.

141
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:29,910
My husband, Joe Harris.

142
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:31,794
And I’ve taken up some sewing.

143
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,714
What are you trying to tell me?

144
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:36,802
Neither of us will be paid
for two weeks.

145
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:38,879
Couldn't you get Mr. Corben. . .

146
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:41,159
. . .to give us a little more time?

147
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:42,238
Mrs. Harris. . .

148
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,837
. . .the bank and I have
the same purpose in life:

149
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:46,879
To make money.

150
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:48,674
Not to support a lot of. . .

151
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:49,997
. . .deadbeats.

152
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:53,791
Mrs. Deagle, it's Christmas!

153
00:10:57,402 --> 00:11:00,599
Now you know what to ask Santa for,
don't you?

154
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,320
Mommy, I’m hungry.

155
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:06,832
Yes, honey. So am l.

156
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:15,115
This is what's left
of my imported Bavarian snowman.

157
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:18,001
Your dog broke it this morning!

158
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:20,790
I’m terribly sorry.

159
00:11:21,002 --> 00:11:22,481
Tell me how much I owe you--

160
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,195
I don't want money.

161
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:29,078
I want your dog.


162
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:33,196
Barney?

163
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:35,873
Give him to me.

164
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:39,074
I’ll take him to the kennel.
They’ll put him to sleep.

165
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,433
It’ll be quick and painless,
compared to what I could do to him.

166
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,521
What could you do?

167
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:50,042
I’ll catch the beast myself.

168
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:53,033
Then he’ll get what he deserves.

169
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:55,676
A slow, painful death.

170
00:11:56,762 --> 00:12:00,232
Maybe I’ll put him in my spin dryer
on high heat.

171
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:02,517
That'd do it.

172
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:11,959
Barney, will you get off of her?

173
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:14,630
My dear lady, are you all right?

174
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:17,959
I have a very weak heart.
I can't stand a shock like that!

175
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:20,039
What is that dog doing in here?

176
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,874
This is a bank, not a pet store.

177
00:12:22,082 --> 00:12:23,037
Very good, Gerald.

178
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,470
He wouldn't hurt you.

179
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:27,480
Excuses, excuses.
You're just like your father.

180
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:31,801
I’ve listened to his excuses
for 1 0 years, the loser!

181
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,800
As for you, you mangy cur. . .

182
00:12:35,162 --> 00:12:36,754
. . .I’ll get you. . .

183
00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:39,399
. . .when you least expect it!

184
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,195
Oh, my heart!

185
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:44,195
I must apologize
for this most unusual. . . .

186
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:45,994
You putz.

187
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,839
The old bat never looked better.

188
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:53,880
It’s great. You're doing fine.

189
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,631
Thanks.

190
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:57,441
Hello, Gerald.

191
00:12:57,682 --> 00:13:00,594
lf it isn't Captain Clip-on.

192
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:04,073
Guess who almost applied
for unemployment today?

193
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:06,477
-I give up.
-You.

194
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:09,401
But Mr. Corben had second thoughts.

195
00:13:09,842 --> 00:13:12,151
He gets so sentimental
about the holidays.

196
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:14,000
Imagine that.

197
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:16,593
I would've fired you in a second.

198
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:18,994
Merry Christmas to you too.

199
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:20,999
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

200
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,194
Hey, Peltzer.

201
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:27,394
Look, I’m a junior
vice president at 23.

202
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:30,833
By the time I’m 25,
I’m gonna have Mr. Corben's job.

203
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:33,318
By the time I’m 30,
I’ll be a millionaire.

204
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:34,318
Look at you.

205
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:38,081
You're practically supporting
your whole family.

206
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:40,234
The world's changing.

207
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:42,797
You gotta change with it.
You gotta be tough.

208
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:46,080
Tough? And no one's
tougher than you, Ger?

209
00:13:47,482 --> 00:13:49,598
Don't call me that.
My name's Gerald.

210
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:51,030
Can I get you a drink?

211
00:13:51,242 --> 00:13:53,551
Give me a vodka martini.
Shake, don't stir.

212
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:54,751
You work here?

213
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:57,430
Weeknights, so Dorry doesn't
have to pay an extra waitress.

214
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:58,472
That's great.

215
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:01,879
Yeah, that's swell, if you
like working for nothing.

216
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:05,199
Two more rounds for the pool table,
on the house.

217
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:08,080
You haven't seen my new apartment.

218
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,034
I haven't seen your old apartment.


219
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:14,397
We're talking cable.
Can we have dinner tomorrow night?

220
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:17,201
I’m working.

221
00:14:18,162 --> 00:14:21,438
Why don't you tell Dorry you're sick?
He can't dock your pay.

222
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:31,675
Billy, is that you?

223
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:33,361
Yeah, Mom. It’s me.

224
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:35,439
I’m in the kitchen.

225
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:39,034
Merry Christmas!

226
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,916
Merry Christmas, movie house!

227
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:47,512
Merry Christmas, emporium!

228
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:50,197
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, sweetie.

229
00:14:50,562 --> 00:14:51,995
Do you need any help?

230
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,279
Yeah, you could do the eggs.

231
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:55,990
Thanks.

232
00:15:20,682 --> 00:15:24,561
Dad's machines work so well
the first couple of weeks, then. . . .

233
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:26,195
Use the sink.

234
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:33,194
Is something wrong?

235
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:36,198
No, it's a sad movie.

236
00:15:39,642 --> 00:15:40,961
How was your day?

237
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:42,390
It was fine.

238
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,158
Come on, what is it?
What's wrong?

239
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:50,999
Mrs. Deagle called again
this afternoon.

240
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:58,234
Let's not talk about it now.
Don't say anything to Dad.

241
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,636
Fine with me.

242
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:03,319
Don we now our gay apparel

243
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:08,074
Hi, sweetheart!

244
00:16:10,442 --> 00:16:12,717
-Welcome home.
-Hey, Dad.

245
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:16,391
I’m glad you're back.
How was the trip?

246
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:17,432
It was great.

247
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:20,276
The Miracle Company, who has
the Kitchen Companion. . .

248
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:23,235
. . .might be interested
in the Bathroom Buddy.

249
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,795
Great!

250
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,161
-Thanks!
-You’ll like this.

251
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:31,594
What is it? A birdcage?

252
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:35,472
No, don't shake it. Open it now.
It won't wait till Christmas.

253
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:39,830
It’s a puppy, isn't it?

254
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:41,597
Yeah, I can tell.

255
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:43,201
It’s a new car.

256
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:51,642
-Honey, would you dim the lights?
-Sure.

257
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:54,157
Dim the lights?
Does it glow in the dark?

258
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:56,751
It’s important. Trust me.

259
00:16:58,042 --> 00:16:59,600
Go ahead, open it.

260
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:22,230
What is it?

261
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,955
It’s your new pet.

262
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:25,993
Come on, Barney.
Be a good dog.

263
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:37,200
You're kidding.

264
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:41,799
Dad, it's really neat.

265
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:45,757
Where'd you get this?

266
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:48,351
Some little junk store in Chinatown.

267
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:49,438
Can I pick him up?

268
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:51,473

Sure, go ahead. Just be careful.

269
00:17:51,682 --> 00:17:53,161
-You gotta be gentle.
-I will.

270
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,920
I hope he's housebroken.

271
00:17:58,082 --> 00:17:59,595
Isn't he cute?

272
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:02,077
Has it got a name?

273
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,476
Mogwai.

274
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:08,716
Some Chinese word.
I just call him. . .

275
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,390
. . .Gizmo.
He seems to like it.

276
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,195
Look up here a minute.

277
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:20,238
We're getting our picture taken.

278
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:21,397
Smile.

279
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,757
Ready?

280
00:18:22,962 --> 00:18:25,522
One, two, three. . . .

281
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:28,036
Bright light!

282
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:29,311
What happened?

283
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,194
He hates bright lights.

284
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:34,681
There's some important things
I forgot to tell you.

285
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:39,797
Number one, he hates bright lights.
You gotta keep him out of the sunlight.

286
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:41,995
Sunlight will kill him.

287
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:44,757
Number two, keep him
away from water.

288
00:18:45,002 --> 00:18:49,837
Don't give him any water to drink.
Whatever you do, don't give him a bath.

289
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:52,277
And the most important thing. . .

290
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:56,191
. . .don't ever feed him
after midnight.

291
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:10,635
Looks like you hurt yourself.

292
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:14,599
Light bright! Light bright!

293
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:21,795
Just sit down there
and don't fall off, okay?

294
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:24,197
I’ll get you fixed up in no time.

295
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:28,400
All right.

296
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,590
Hold still.

297
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:33,792
Sorry. Sorry.

298
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:42,991
Try not to move so much, okay?

299
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:02,591
Good night, Giz.
I’ll see you in the morning.

300
00:21:58,682 --> 00:22:00,115
I got a tree!

301
00:22:01,082 --> 00:22:02,800
Oh, Christ!

302
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:06,114

Billy!

303
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:13,396
I just brought in
your Christmas tree.

304
00:22:13,602 --> 00:22:15,081
What happened?

305
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:18,240
Slight problem
with the Peltzer Peeler-Juicer.

306
00:22:18,442 --> 00:22:20,797
I thought your dad fixed it.

307
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:22,594
I thought so too.

308
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:27,991
You should just buy orange juice
in cartons. It’s a lot easier.

309
00:22:29,162 --> 00:22:30,993
See, it works.

310
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:38,071
-I had to come.
-So I see.

311
00:22:38,282 --> 00:22:40,159
Now I can see. It takes...

312
00:22:40,362 --> 00:22:41,841
...a certain kind of guy.

313
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:44,795
And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.

314
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,912
It’s no problem, Pete.
Leave it up here.

315
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:08,231
What’ll you tell him?

316
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:12,270
I’ll just tell him a bunch of bikers
stole it from me on my way home.

317
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:18,201
Wow! The Hooded Menace.
Issue number one!

318
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:19,630
Pretty neat, huh?

319
00:23:19,842 --> 00:23:21,195
Where'd you get it?

320
00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:23,793

Dr. Fantasy's, I think.

321
00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:26,038
What's that?

322
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:27,795
Come here. I’ll show you.

323
00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:30,353
This is my new pet.
My dad gave him to me.

324
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:31,790
Neat! What's his name?

325
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:34,152
His name's Gizmo. Hi, Giz.

326
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:36,000
He's a mogwai.

327
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:43,590
Cute!

328
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:48,995
Blink your eyes.

329
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:52,394
Go like that.
Can you do that?

330
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:00,200
Watch. Maybe he’ll sing.

331
00:24:00,962 --> 00:24:04,637
Come on, Giz.
Let's go over to the table.

332
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:06,201
I’ll be careful.

333
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:09,399
There we go.

334
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:14,875
Gee, Billy, where
can I get one of those?

335
00:24:15,082 --> 00:24:17,801
I don't know.
This is the only one I’ve ever seen.

336
00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:19,797
Can I hold him?

337
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:23,597
Sure. I don't see why not.
He seems to like you.

338
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:26,798
Great! Thanks a lot.

339
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:28,191
Sorry.

340
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,201
What was in that jar?

341
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,835
Nothing! Just water!

342
00:24:32,962 --> 00:24:34,315
Why is he making that noise?

343
00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:42,632
What is it?

344
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,597
I don't know.

345
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:50,794
Is it alive?

346
00:24:51,362 --> 00:24:52,715
I don't know.

347
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,591
One, two, three,
four, five new ones.

348
00:25:53,642 --> 00:25:55,234
Now can I have one?

349
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:56,471
I don't know.

350
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,111
Look, that one's got
a cute stripe on its head.

351
00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:05,235
Isn't that incredible, Pete?

352
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,200
Yeah, great.

353
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:10,476
Don't you think this--?
This is incredible!

354
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:13,120
Oh, it is neat.

355
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:16,400
I’m serious. It’s neat.

356
00:26:20,282 --> 00:26:22,512
Gizmo, what's the matter?

357
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,637
-There's something I should tell you.
-Look.

358
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:44,753
You're familiar
with the Bathroom Buddy?

359
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:47,237
I have made an improvement.

360
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:48,431
Watch this.

361
00:26:48,682 --> 00:26:52,391
Now, let's say you're
late for the big meeting.

362
00:26:52,602 --> 00:26:53,921
It’s really important.

363
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:57,950
You're on your way. You reach up.
You forgot to shave.

364
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:01,040
What're you gonna do?
Under normal circumstances. . .

365
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:02,954
. . .you are in trouble.

366
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:05,801
But not if you have
the Bathroom Buddy.

367
00:27:06,482 --> 00:27:07,801
Watch this.

368
00:27:09,882 --> 00:27:11,201
What do you think?

369
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,361
That's pretty neat.

370
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:15,991
What's this button?

371
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,600
-Sorry, Dad.
-It’s okay.

372
00:27:21,802 --> 00:27:22,598
I’m sorry.

373
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:26,238
It’s not your fault. I’m working
on that. I haven't finished that.

374
00:27:26,442 --> 00:27:29,798
I came up here because
there's a problem with the mogwai.

375
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:31,481
Yeah, what's that?

376
00:27:32,562 --> 00:27:34,632
It multiplies with water.

377
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:42,395
Do you see what I mean?

378
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,073
I don't believe that.

379
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:47,079
All that from water?
They got wet?

380
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:48,601
Plain water.

381
00:27:52,762 --> 00:27:54,798
It’s funny.
The new ones aren't like Gizmo.

382
00:27:55,002 --> 00:27:57,038
The striped one
seems to be the leader.

383
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,231
You know what?

384
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:01,594
I’ll bet every kid in America
would like one of these.

385
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:04,232
They might replace
the dog as the family pet.

386
00:28:15,682 --> 00:28:16,478
Think about it.

387
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:18,594
The Peltzer Pet.

388
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:23,792
This could really be the big one.

389
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:17,198
Barney, who did this to you?

390
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:19,074
Hold on, I’ll get you down.

391
00:29:19,282 --> 00:29:20,601
Stay still.

392
00:29:21,842 --> 00:29:25,198
Poor dog. Another minute
and he would've been a dog-sicle.

393
00:29:26,802 --> 00:29:30,590
All I know is that I’m positive
that I closed and locked the door.

394
00:29:31,882 --> 00:29:33,600
How else did she get to him?

395
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:37,795
We can't point any fingers,
not even at Mrs. Deagle.

396
00:29:38,642 --> 00:29:41,793
She's been threatening him.
She'd love to get her hands on him.

397
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:46,917
We don't have proof. We can't even
find footprints leading up to the house.

398
00:29:48,362 --> 00:29:51,479
I’m gonna take Barney
to your grandmother's.

399
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:55,078
Take him there on the way to the
convention, pick him up on the way home.

400
00:29:55,282 --> 00:29:58,797
He’ll be here for Christmas.
It’ll be all right.

401
00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:06,198
I don't think we can drink this.

402
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:12,195
Why not?

403
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:14,200
What's wrong with this?

404
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:25,200
Is that a mogwai?.

405
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:28,235
Yeah, I’m gonna have
Mr. Hanson check it out.

406
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:31,991
And all of a sudden, there were
five new ones like this one.

407
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:35,194
Now watch this.

408
00:31:10,922 --> 00:31:14,232
Can I keep one of these here,
run some tests on him?

409
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:17,279
I think I can spare one.

410
00:31:26,202 --> 00:31:28,875
This is some Christmas, Katie,
I’ll tell you.

411
00:31:29,082 --> 00:31:33,917
First the old bat closes the factory,
and now it's my goddamn plow.

412
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:37,034
Mr. Futterman, guess what?
It’s time to go home now.

413
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:39,392
-How about one more beer?
-No, it's late.

414
00:31:39,602 --> 00:31:41,433
One more beer,
I’ll help you clean up.

415
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:44,236
No, thanks, though.
It’ll be okay.

416
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:49,476
-It’ll be okay.
-It will not be okay.

417
00:31:49,682 --> 00:31:53,675
I brought my plow in for a tune-up
and found it loaded with foreign parts.

418
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:57,079
I mean, everything.
Gaskets, pistons, spark plugs.

419
00:31:57,322 --> 00:31:59,040
All of it's foreign.

420
00:32:03,242 --> 00:32:04,641
Going home?

421
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:11,350
Gremlins!

422
00:32:12,642 --> 00:32:14,633
You gotta watch out for foreigners.

423
00:32:14,882 --> 00:32:17,077
They plant gremlins
in their machinery.

424
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:20,957
The same gremlins brought down
our planes in the big one.

425
00:32:21,682 --> 00:32:23,081
That's right.

426
00:32:23,322 --> 00:32:24,755
World War ll.

427
00:32:24,962 --> 00:32:25,917
Good old. . .

428
00:32:26,122 --> 00:32:28,431
. . .W-W-I-I.

429
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,636
They're still shipping them over here.

430
00:32:34,842 --> 00:32:36,639
They put them in the cars, the TV.

431
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:39,481
They put them in the radios
you stick in your ears.

432
00:32:39,722 --> 00:32:42,441
They put them in the watches.
Little teeny gremlins.

433
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:45,992
It’s not a good idea that you drive.
Why don't you walk home?

434
00:32:46,602 --> 00:32:49,275
You know, Katie, I think
maybe I’ll walk home.

435
00:32:49,522 --> 00:32:50,318
Good.

436
00:32:50,522 --> 00:32:52,433
It’s a nice night.

437
00:32:56,402 --> 00:32:57,835
Good night, kids.

438
00:33:00,922 --> 00:33:02,435
Gremlins.

439
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,312
That was really good,
the way you handled Mr. Futterman.

440
00:33:31,682 --> 00:33:33,240
I’m used to it.

441
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:36,441
He's been like that
ever since he lost his job.

442
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:41,594
He's like a lot of people around here.
He just wants somebody to listen.

443
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:43,633
Especially around the holidays.

444
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,121
Why is that?

445
00:33:46,322 --> 00:33:49,041
It’s when a lot of people
get really depressed.

446
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:54,793
I always thought everyone was happy
during the holidays, no matter what.

447
00:33:55,002 --> 00:33:57,516
Most people are, but some aren't.

448
00:33:57,722 --> 00:34:01,681
While everybody else opens up presents,
they're opening up their wrists.

449
00:34:03,002 --> 00:34:03,878
Cheery thought.

450
00:34:04,082 --> 00:34:07,631
It’s true. The suicide rate's
always the highest around the holidays.

451
00:34:09,082 --> 00:34:10,834
Now I’m depressed.

452
00:34:11,122 --> 00:34:13,113
Do you ever get depressed on Christmas?

453
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:16,273
I don't celebrate Christmas.

454
00:34:16,482 --> 00:34:17,801
Are you Hindu or something?

455
00:34:18,002 --> 00:34:19,833
No, I just don't like to.

456
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:23,636
What's not to like?
I mean, it's a lot of fun.

457
00:34:23,882 --> 00:34:24,917
God!

458
00:34:25,122 --> 00:34:27,511
Say you hate Thanksgiving,
and nobody cares.

459
00:34:27,722 --> 00:34:32,034
But say you hate Christmas, everybody
makes you feel like you're a leper.

460
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:36,319
-I’m sorry.
-It’s okay.

461
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:40,640
I’m sorry. I’m just
a little tired and cranky.

462
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:47,274
Thanks for walking me home.

463
00:34:47,522 --> 00:34:49,433
No problem.

464
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:51,237
Good night.

465
00:34:56,122 --> 00:34:59,876
I was just wondering. Do you
get any free nights off from Dorry's?

466
00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:02,401
Thursdays.

467
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:04,799
Thursdays, yeah.

468
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,470
Because I was just wondering. . .

469
00:35:07,682 --> 00:35:11,994
. . .if you're free this Thursday night,
maybe you'd like to go out on a date. . .

470
00:35:13,122 --> 00:35:13,998
. . .with me?

471
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:15,317
I’d love to.

472
00:35:18,522 --> 00:35:20,035
Well, that's great!

473
00:35:21,442 --> 00:35:25,594
We can talk about it
on the phone and kind of. . .

474
00:35:25,802 --> 00:35:27,633
. . .square everything away.

475
00:35:29,682 --> 00:35:31,035
Good night, Billy.

476
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,641
Hey, there.

477
00:36:01,522 --> 00:36:04,082
Give me your arm, boy.
Come here, come on.

478
00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:07,041
Give me your arm.
No, this is not gonna hurt.

479
00:36:07,922 --> 00:36:09,674
This isn't gonna hurt.

480
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:13,232
Not a big guy like you. Come on.

481
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:17,231
There you go.
See, that's not so bad. Come on.

482
00:36:17,522 --> 00:36:20,241
Good, good.
Oh, that's good.

483
00:36:21,002 --> 00:36:24,199
Just a little blood test, pal.
You’ll never miss it.

484
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:30,431
They're like huge seed pods!

485
00:36:36,922 --> 00:36:39,117
-Having fun?
-Fun!

486
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,471
Pretty neat, huh?

487
00:36:40,722 --> 00:36:41,837
Neat!

488
00:36:49,282 --> 00:36:51,671
How about shutting up
for a change, okay?

489
00:36:51,922 --> 00:36:53,435
I already fed you.

490
00:36:59,922 --> 00:37:02,277
Well, it's not 1 2:00 yet.

491
00:37:02,882 --> 00:37:06,795
All right. Keep an eye on them, Giz.
I’ll be back in a second.

492
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:28,521
Here we go.

493
00:37:28,722 --> 00:37:31,520
Now maybe you guys will be quiet.

494
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:43,560
You guys are really hungry.

495
00:37:46,442 --> 00:37:48,034
Giz, you want some?

496
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:53,241
Do you want some chicken?

497
00:38:15,842 --> 00:38:18,436
That's it, good buddy.
Call it a night.

498
00:38:55,682 --> 00:38:57,912
Can’t you see?
They're after you!

499
00:38:58,122 --> 00:39:01,592
They're after all of us!
Our wives, our children, everyone!

500
00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:05,317
They're here already!
You're next!

501

00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:10,040
You're next!
You're next! You're next!

502
00:39:23,042 --> 00:39:25,237
Mom, could you come up here, please?

503
00:39:30,722 --> 00:39:34,237
Then I want you to bring
the vacuum cleaner upstairs for me.

504

00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:42,278
What are they?

505
00:39:43,522 --> 00:39:46,116
Well, they're the mogwai, I guess.

506
00:39:46,322 --> 00:39:47,641
Except for Gizmo.

507
00:39:49,202 --> 00:39:51,033
Did you get them wet?

508
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:56,913
Did you feed them
after midnight?

509
00:39:57,122 --> 00:39:59,113
Well, I gave them
some chicken.

510
00:39:59,322 --> 00:40:00,835
But I made sure that it--

511
00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:04,320
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

512
00:40:04,522 --> 00:40:06,240
I made sure. . . .

513
00:40:14,242 --> 00:40:16,039
What's going on here?

514
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,993
What'd you say this was called?

515
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:24,999
A putrid stage?

516

00:40:25,242 --> 00:40:27,802
Pupal. Pupal stage.

517
00:40:28,002 --> 00:40:29,515
Like a butterfly.

518
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:30,598
Yeah, right.

519
00:40:30,802 --> 00:40:35,478
This is a cocoon, and inside
he's going through changes.

520
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:37,840
Lots of changes.

521
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:39,640
Like my mother.

522
00:40:41,122 --> 00:40:42,237
No, that's different.

523
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,838
This is called a metamorphosis.

524
00:40:46,122 --> 00:40:48,113
It’s a change in form. . .

525
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:50,233
. . .and in appearance.

526
00:41:16,482 --> 00:41:17,881
Hi, honey!

527
00:41:18,282 --> 00:41:19,431
No, I’m sure it works fine.

528
00:41:19,642 --> 00:41:21,758
I was just out on the back porch
for a second.

529
00:41:22,322 --> 00:41:24,233
The convention's great.

530
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,881
I said it's great!

531
00:41:29,082 --> 00:41:30,674
Actually, the competition's. . . .

532
00:41:30,882 --> 00:41:31,712
Sorry, miss.

533
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,675
The competition's a little more
advanced than I expected.

534
00:41:34,882 --> 00:41:38,636
-I was giving myself an oil change.
-Some really neat things.

535
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:43,760
Oh, Rand.

536
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,517
You've never been so far
away on Christmas Eve before.

537
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:50,392
I know it's Christmas Eve.

538
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:53,315
I’ll do the best I can.

539
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:55,195
All right. Bye-bye.

540
00:41:57,242 --> 00:41:59,437
All I could get for it was $36!

541
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,237
lf there's anything I can do. . . .
But it's completely out of my hands.

542
00:42:03,442 --> 00:42:04,921
I’ll be delighted--

543
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:08,034
Hello, Gerald.
I’m under such terrible pressure.

544
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:10,916
Why don't you just
speak to Mrs. Deagle about it?

545
00:42:11,122 --> 00:42:13,272
Speak to Mrs. Deagle?

546
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,038
Mrs. Deagle!

547
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,640
Deposit this to my account.

548
00:42:27,442 --> 00:42:29,239
Where's that psychotic canine?

549
00:42:29,442 --> 00:42:31,319
Still hiding under the counter?

550
00:42:31,522 --> 00:42:33,911
No, I’m afraid he's on vacation.

551
00:42:34,122 --> 00:42:37,000
Better keep him behind locked doors,
because if I catch him. . .

552
00:42:37,202 --> 00:42:39,352
. . .he's in for a slow death.

553
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,478
Here's Mr. Bird's heart.

554
00:42:50,522 --> 00:42:53,036
Small animals lose heat
faster than large ones.

555
00:42:53,242 --> 00:42:56,314
Their blood must circulate
faster to keep their bodies warm.

556
00:42:56,522 --> 00:42:57,716
Now, in small birds...

557
00:42:57,922 --> 00:43:00,675
... their hearts beat
about 600 times per minute.

558
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:02,838
Cats, 1 30.

559
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:04,561
Man, about 7 5...

560
00:43:04,802 --> 00:43:08,317
...and a big old elephant's heart,
only 25 a minute.

561
00:43:08,722 --> 00:43:11,520
Hey, doc, you
got a human heart?

562
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:16,238
Has he got a human heart?
Wait till you see this! Roll 1 0.

563
00:44:19,682 --> 00:44:23,072
Okay, class.
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas.

564
00:44:23,322 --> 00:44:25,278
lf any of you wanna bring me
a present. . .

565
00:44:25,482 --> 00:44:27,632
. . .a cassette deck wouldn't be bad.

566
00:44:27,842 --> 00:44:30,834
Of course, tickets to the Super Bowl
would be very nice.

567
00:44:31,842 --> 00:44:34,834
Mr. Hanson, wait.
Let me just talk to you for a second.

568
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:37,831
Bye.

569
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:11,001
It just hatched.

570
00:45:11,522 --> 00:45:12,875
I’ll be right there.

571
00:45:33,122 --> 00:45:34,601
Hey, there.

572
00:45:36,882 --> 00:45:39,919
You remember me?

573
00:45:46,922 --> 00:45:48,640
Remember me, don't you?

574
00:45:49,442 --> 00:45:51,034
I went and got you. . .

575
00:45:52,202 --> 00:45:53,840
. . .a candy bar.

576
00:45:54,122 --> 00:45:56,238
I thought you might be hungry.

577
00:45:57,402 --> 00:45:58,835
You hungry?

578
00:46:03,922 --> 00:46:06,152
You should try one of these.

579
00:46:20,802 --> 00:46:22,030
Hey, there.

580
00:46:22,802 --> 00:46:26,317
Come here. Don't be afraid.
There's no reason to be afraid.

581
00:46:27,522 --> 00:46:28,841
Where'd you go?

582
00:46:30,122 --> 00:46:32,682
Where are you?
I know you're in there.

583
00:46:32,882 --> 00:46:34,634
I know you're under there.

584
00:46:36,122 --> 00:46:37,840
Come on, now.

585
00:46:38,282 --> 00:46:41,718
You're not still angry
about that little blood test, are you?

586
00:46:42,602 --> 00:46:45,036
Come on out.
Take a bite. Let me see you.

587
00:46:45,242 --> 00:46:47,756
I just wanna see you.

588
00:46:50,602 --> 00:46:53,639
You try some of this now.
I know you gotta be hungry.

589
00:46:58,922 --> 00:47:01,516
There now. Don't you feel better?

590
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:37,389
Gizmo ca-ca!

591
00:50:21,959 --> 00:50:23,790
Billy, are you okay?
Where are you?

592
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:26,508
Mom, they hatched.
Get out of the house.

593
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:28,949
Phone home. Ca-ca!

594
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:54,675
Get out of my kitchen!

595
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:46,477
Neat!

596
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:13,995
-Are you all right?
-I think so.

597
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:24,792
Mom, it's Stripe!

598
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:36,395
Should I get it?

599
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,396
Yeah, go ahead and get it.

600
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,391
Oh, I didn't mean that.

601
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,192
Hello, Dr. Molinaro. Can we come in?

602
00:55:44,399 --> 00:55:46,390
My mom's had a bit of an accident.

603
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,197
Be careful!

604
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:51,793
What happened?

605
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:02,233
Giz?

606
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,636
Bright light! Bright light!

607
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:19,198
Come here.

608
00:56:19,759 --> 00:56:21,192
They almost got you, huh?

609
00:56:21,959 --> 00:56:23,392
Climb in here.

610
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:29,191
The question is
totally without meaning.

611
00:56:30,439 --> 00:56:32,589
Pardon me, sir. Stuff.

612
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,592
Thick and heavy.

613
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,399
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?

614
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:42,514
I rarely use it myself, sir.
It promotes rust.

615
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:54,590
Don't worry, Giz. We’ll find him.

616
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:08,431
Gremlins, huh?

617
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,556
-Little monsters.
-Right.

618
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:11,555
Hundreds of them?

619
00:59:11,759 --> 00:59:14,796
I’m not sure.
Maybe thousands.

620
00:59:15,959 --> 00:59:18,837
Look, I know it sounds crazy.
I know it does.

621
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,475
But in a matter of hours,
this town's gonna be a disaster area.

622
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:24,078
You've got to warn people!

623
00:59:24,279 --> 00:59:27,191
-You think this kid is drunk?
-No, but you are.

624
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:28,555
I am not drunk!

625
00:59:28,759 --> 00:59:32,798
Tell me something. Where do
these little gremlins come from?


626
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:34,114
All right.

627
00:59:34,359 --> 00:59:37,590
My father gave me one as a present.

628
00:59:37,999 --> 00:59:41,196
Does your father always
give you vicious little monsters?

629
00:59:41,399 --> 00:59:44,072
No, they don't
start out vicious at first!

630
00:59:44,279 --> 00:59:45,473
Of course not.

631
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:48,796
They don't!
They look like this.

632
00:59:49,999 --> 00:59:51,591
Could you dim the lights?

633
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:53,233
Sure.

634
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,955
Go ahead, Brent.
Dim the lights.

635
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:06,787
Gusto!

636
01:00:21,479 --> 01:00:24,312
'Tis the season to be jolly

637
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:30,791
Right, Murray?

638
01:00:39,759 --> 01:00:41,989
Sheila, will you quit messing
with the TV?

639
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,790
You have the thingy.

640
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:50,791
Goddamn foreign TV.

641
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:54,957
We should've got a Zenith!

642
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:07,073
Foreigners.

643
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:13,190
I can't get a damn thing on this!

644
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:15,194
Where are you going?

645
01:01:15,399 --> 01:01:18,471
I’m gonna check the antenna.
Maybe the damn thing blew down.

646
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:20,317
Be careful, dear.

647
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:39,397
What the hell is that?

648
01:02:23,919 --> 01:02:26,353
-It’s them!
-You're crazy!

649
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,198
There's a real gremlin in my cab!

650
01:02:59,759 --> 01:03:02,227
Hello, Anderson.
Wanna mail something, do you?

651
01:03:02,439 --> 01:03:04,350
Just a last-minute package, Father.

652
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:05,833
Be my guest.

653
01:03:07,759 --> 01:03:09,192
That's strange.

654
01:03:37,399 --> 01:03:39,071
Patriotic little fellow, ain't he?

655
01:03:39,279 --> 01:03:41,190
Waving the flag and everything.

656
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:45,752
Be careful, Frank!
He might tear your arm off.

657
01:03:45,959 --> 01:03:48,029
You want me to put the cuffs on him?

658
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:50,673
Tell me. How come
a cute guy like this. . .

659
01:03:50,879 --> 01:03:53,268
. . .can turn into
a thousand ugly monsters?

660
01:03:53,479 --> 01:03:56,437
You see, this is before
it enters the pupal stage.

661
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:58,994
Plus, it multiplies with water.

662
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,953
-Get the kid some water.
-I wouldn't do that.

663
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:03,592
Sheriff's office.

664
01:04:04,399 --> 01:04:05,593
Yeah, speaking.

665
01:04:07,759 --> 01:04:08,953
What?

666
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:15,588
Yeah, sure, we’ll be right over.

667
01:04:16,359 --> 01:04:17,587
What happened?

668
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:19,353
The Futtermans.

669
01:04:19,879 --> 01:04:23,474
Something about a snowplow.
A freak accident.

670
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:24,953
It’s the creatures!


671
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:28,390
The creatures are making it
look like an accident!

672
01:04:29,879 --> 01:04:31,107
Will you listen to me?

673
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:32,997
You listen to me, kid!

674
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,270
Go on home, take little Gizmo. . .

675
01:04:35,479 --> 01:04:38,630
. . .sit by the fireplace
and open your Christmas presents.

676
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:40,192
Attaboy.

677
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,756
-Let me drive.
-No, you're drunk.

678
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:43,994
You always drive!

679
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:46,315
Because I’m the sheriff, asshole.

680
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:04,989
Kopeck, you stop that, you bad kitty!

681
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:07,629
Kopeck's a bad kitty.

682
01:05:07,879 --> 01:05:09,995
Ruble's a good little kitty.

683
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:15,154
We’ll find you something to eat.
She's a good kitty.

684
01:05:17,759 --> 01:05:20,193
Here we go. Here we go. Come on.

685
01:05:20,399 --> 01:05:21,878
All right, you stop that!

686
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:23,592
Stop it!

687
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:30,230
Mean kitty, you start eating
before everybody gets here.

688
01:05:30,439 --> 01:05:32,031
Come on, Dollar Bill.

689
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:34,833
Yes, here we go, Dollar Bill.

690
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:38,151
Mommy'll fix you
something good to eat.

691
01:05:38,359 --> 01:05:39,712
Everybody here?

692
01:05:39,959 --> 01:05:42,712
All right, let go of Mommy's coat.

693
01:05:42,919 --> 01:05:43,874
Here.

694
01:05:48,879 --> 01:05:50,790
Christmas carollers.

695
01:05:51,479 --> 01:05:54,039
I hate Christmas carollers.

696
01:05:54,279 --> 01:05:57,988
Screechy-voiced little glue-sniffers.

697
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,587
I warned you brats!

698
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:17,677
What are they?

699
01:06:17,879 --> 01:06:19,790
What are they?!

700
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:26,752
They're here!

701
01:06:26,959 --> 01:06:29,996
They've come for me!
They've come!

702
01:06:32,759 --> 01:06:34,078
I’m not ready.

703
01:06:34,279 --> 01:06:37,157
I’m not ready yet.
I’m not ready!

704
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:03,397
My God, Frye!

705
01:07:03,759 --> 01:07:05,112
That was Mrs. Deagle.

706
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:15,553
Get them off! Get them off! Help me!

707
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,518
That's Dave Myers.
He does Santa every year.

708
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:26,395
What the hell is he doing now?

709
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:29,190
What's that stuff he's
got all over him?

710
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:33,795
Frank, I really think
we should go now.

711
01:07:33,999 --> 01:07:37,036
Start the car. I’d really like
to go back to the station.

712
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:39,753
Please!

713
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:08,558
Jesus, Frank!

714
01:08:08,759 --> 01:08:10,317
What the hell are those things?

715
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:14,747
It’s Christmas.
What the hell's going on?

716
01:08:14,959 --> 01:08:16,028
Shut up, will you?!

717
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:44,791
I don't believe it.

718
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:50,871
You're on with Rockin ' Ricky! Go!

719
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:52,751
Hi, my name's Pete.

720
01:08:52,959 --> 01:08:55,871
These green guys are
running around wrecking things.

721
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:58,388
This is Christmas, not Halloween!

722
01:08:58,639 --> 01:08:59,628
Listen, gang.

723
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:02,956
Rockin ' Ricky's getting fed up
with this Orson Welles crap!

724
01:09:03,159 --> 01:09:03,955
What's that?

725
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:06,673
Kitty, what's that?
Some of Rockin ' Ricky fans?

726
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:09,394
You're not a Rockin ' Ricky fan!

727
01:09:32,639 --> 01:09:35,995
Sir, I notice that you're a smoker.

728
01:09:36,759 --> 01:09:40,388
I notice that you're a smoker.
I see the cigarettes.

729
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:43,793
I noticed, here, this broken ashtray.

730
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:47,227
It’s very fortunate
that I happened to come by.

731
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:51,034
Let me introduce myself. My name's
Randall Peltzer. I’m an inventor.

732
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:54,430
" Fantastic ideas for a Fantastic World. "
I make the illogical logical.

733
01:09:54,639 --> 01:09:58,075
I have something here that I think
you might be interested in.

734
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:00,192
Yes, sir, I do.

735
01:10:00,559 --> 01:10:01,992
This is. . .

736
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,674
. . .the Peltzer Smokeless Ashtray.

737
01:10:04,879 --> 01:10:07,712
I think this can solve
your problem here, sir.

738
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,195
Please don't bite me!

739
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:02,587
Wait a minute.

740
01:14:20,279 --> 01:14:21,155
You all right?

741
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:22,792
Let's get out of here!

742
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:27,228
What's that?

743
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:30,192
Don't worry. He's with me.
He's not one of them.

744
01:14:35,959 --> 01:14:38,393
What's wrong?
Why isn't the car starting?

745
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,588
We're gonna have to
make a run for it, okay?

746
01:14:41,839 --> 01:14:44,034
One, two, three!

747
01:15:16,999 --> 01:15:18,591
They've been here too.

748
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:22,192
What are these things?
Where do they come from?

749
01:15:23,599 --> 01:15:25,396
They're gremlins, Kate.

750
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:28,789
Just like Mr. Futterman said.

751
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:37,593
Now I have another reason
to hate Christmas.

752
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:39,918
What are you talking about?

753
01:15:40,799 --> 01:15:45,190
The worst thing that ever
happened to me was on Christmas.

754
01:15:45,799 --> 01:15:48,029
Oh, God. It was so horrible.

755
01:15:51,399 --> 01:15:53,196
It was Christmas Eve.

756
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,391
I was 9 years old.

757
01:15:56,839 --> 01:15:59,512
Me and Mom were decorating the tree. . .

758
01:16:00,199 --> 01:16:02,190
. . .waiting for Dad
to come home from work.

759
01:16:03,879 --> 01:16:05,597
A couple hours went by.

760
01:16:05,839 --> 01:16:07,397
Dad wasn't home.

761
01:16:07,799 --> 01:16:10,313
So Mom called the office.
No answer.

762
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:16,195
Christmas Day came and went,
and still nothing.

763
01:16:17,879 --> 01:16:19,995
So the police began a search.

764
01:16:20,559 --> 01:16:22,675
Four or five days went by.

765
01:16:22,959 --> 01:16:25,598
Neither one of us
could eat or sleep.

766
01:16:26,439 --> 01:16:28,316
Everything was falling apart.

767
01:16:29,959 --> 01:16:31,597
It was snowing outside.

768
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:36,677
The house was freezing, so I went
to try to light up the fire.

769
01:16:36,879 --> 01:16:38,995
That's when I noticed the smell.

770
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,952
The firemen came and
broke through the chimney top.

771
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:50,152
And me and Mom were expecting
them to pull out a dead cat or a bird.

772
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:52,998
And instead they pulled out my father.

773
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,396
He was dressed
in a Santa Claus suit.

774
01:17:01,239 --> 01:17:03,628
He'd been climbing down the chimney. . .

775
01:17:03,839 --> 01:17:06,034
. . .his arms loaded with presents.

776
01:17:06,599 --> 01:17:08,396
He was gonna surprise us.

777
01:17:10,999 --> 01:17:14,389
He slipped and broke his neck.
He died instantly.

778
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:21,192
And that's how I found out
there was no Santa Claus.

779
01:17:24,799 --> 01:17:28,189
Don't worry about that smoke.
It’ll stop. It’s guaranteed.

780
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:39,672
Barney, shut up!

781
01:17:39,879 --> 01:17:42,188
Don't start with me.
I got a long way to go.

782
01:17:42,879 --> 01:17:43,948
Shut up!

783
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:38,798
Where did they all go?

784
01:18:38,999 --> 01:18:40,671
It’ll be light soon.

785
01:18:40,879 --> 01:18:42,995
I bet they're all
together someplace dark.

786
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:52,598
Mogwai!

787
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:22,878
They're inside.

788
01:19:23,079 --> 01:19:24,432
All of them?

789
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:31,838
Milk Duds.

790
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:51,478
What are they doing?

791
01:20:52,879 --> 01:20:54,790
They're watching Snow White.

792
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:57,271
And they love it.

793
01:21:04,799 --> 01:21:06,198
Where's the boiler room?

794
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:08,071
It’s in the back of the theater.

795
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:22,598
Down there.

796
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,109
Milk Duds.

797
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:10,793
Cover your mouth.
Don't breathe any gas.

798
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:27,553
Go.

799
01:23:10,959 --> 01:23:11,755
Hurry up!

800
01:23:11,959 --> 01:23:14,598
Go, Katie! Watch out!

801
01:23:16,999 --> 01:23:18,398
Come on!

802
01:23:57,239 --> 01:23:59,195
In the department store.

803
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:01,433
Stripe!

804
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:31,839
That's Stripe.
He's the leader.

805
01:24:34,279 --> 01:24:36,998
lf he gets to water,
It’ll start all over again.

806
01:24:53,239 --> 01:24:57,790
Take Giz. Go back and try
and find some kind of light switch.

807
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:10,791
Careful, Billy.

808
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:20,789
Ward is your snowplow headquarters.

809
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:45,951
Attention, Christmas shoppers.

810
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:50,789
Saturday morning at 8:30, we’ll have
Santa Claus for all the kiddies.

811
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:07,269
We have the Kingston Falls....

812
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,197
Attention, shoppers.

813
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,271
Light bright!

814
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:40,469
Bye-bye.

815
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,070
It takes a certain kind of guy.

816
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:40,998
And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.

817
01:30:33,479 --> 01:30:36,277
Water!

818
01:30:39,079 --> 01:30:40,114
Gun!

819
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:43,352
It's been a rough night
for Rockin ' Ricky...

820
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:46,792
...but he's still on the air!

821
01:30:47,159 --> 01:30:49,992
The Marines are standing by
with fire hoses.

822
01:32:28,839 --> 01:32:31,228
Gizmo ca-ca!

823
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:33,395
Light bright! Light bright!

824
01:33:10,799 --> 01:33:13,029
What the hell is that?

825
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:25,515
Your scarf.

826
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:27,638
We switch to a report...

827
01:34:27,839 --> 01:34:30,751
...from the scene of
the Christmas Eve riots.

828
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:36,027
This is Lew Landers,
WDHB's Action Central News...

829
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,195
...at the site of Dorry's Tavern...

830
01:34:38,559 --> 01:34:41,835
...or what used to be Dorry's Tavern,
in Kingston Falls...

831
01:34:42,039 --> 01:34:43,392
... where officials blame...

832
01:34:43,599 --> 01:34:47,308
...mass hysteria for the escalating
series of unexplained...

833
01:34:47,519 --> 01:34:51,717
...accidents, fires and explosions
that rocked this once-peaceful town...

834
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:53,638
...on Christmas Eve.

835
01:34:53,839 --> 01:34:56,797
The bizarre demise
of Mrs. Ruby Deagle, widow...

836
01:34:56,999 --> 01:35:00,196
...of convicted stock-swindler
Donald Deagle....

837
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,470
Don't chew that.

838
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:03,947
Don't chew.

839
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:08,634
I bet he'd like
some chicken soup.

840
01:35:14,039 --> 01:35:18,157

Honey, this is the gentleman
who sold me the mogwai.

841
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:22,348
" Sold. " An interesting choice of words.

842
01:35:26,559 --> 01:35:29,835
Conflicting eyewitness reports
concerning ''little green men''....

843
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:36,152
You teach him to watch television?

844
01:35:41,839 --> 01:35:44,353
There was, I believe, a box.

845
01:35:53,559 --> 01:35:54,674
Dad. . . .

846
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:06,357
Rand, your scarf.

847
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:09,434
I warned you.

848
01:36:10,039 --> 01:36:13,190
With mogwai comes much responsibility.

849
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:14,792
But you didn't listen.

850
01:36:15,039 --> 01:36:17,269
And you see what happens.

851
01:36:17,479 --> 01:36:19,231
I didn't mean it.

852
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:22,715
You do with mogwai what your society. . .

853
01:36:22,959 --> 01:36:26,918
. . .has done with all of nature's gifts.

854
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:29,155
You do not understand.

855
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:32,838
You are not ready.

856
01:36:48,119 --> 01:36:50,235
He has something to say to you.

857
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:59,192
You understand what
he says when he speaks to you?

858
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:02,550
To hear, one has only to listen.

859
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:07,752
Bye, Billy.

860
01:37:13,519 --> 01:37:16,431
Perhaps someday you may be ready.

861
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:18,470
Until then, mogwai...

862
01:37:18,879 --> 01:37:20,358
. . .will be waiting.

863
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:24,758
Excuse me, sir.

864
01:37:25,599 --> 01:37:27,590
Before you go, I wanted to tell you. . .

865
01:37:27,839 --> 01:37:30,512
. . .that I am truly sorry
for what's happened.


866
01:37:30,999 --> 01:37:33,797
And if you would accept it,
I’d like to. . .

867
01:37:33,999 --> 01:37:35,910
. . .give you this small token.

868
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:39,350
There's one other one.
This is an invention of mine.

869

01:37:39,559 --> 01:37:41,515
Smokeless Ashtray.

870
01:37:41,719 --> 01:37:42,708
How did you know?

871
01:37:42,919 --> 01:37:45,717
Man at gas station tried to sell me.

872
01:37:45,959 --> 01:37:48,553
Latest word in technology.

873
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:51,189
Very generous of you.

874
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:54,152
I’m sure it will come in handy.

875
01:38:19,239 --> 01:38:21,434
Well, that's the story.

876
01:38:21,999 --> 01:38:26,356
So if your air conditioner goes on the
fritz, your washing machine blows up...

877
01:38:26,559 --> 01:38:28,914
...or your video recorder conks out...

878
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,075
...before you call the repairman...

879
01:38:31,399 --> 01:38:34,550
... turn on the lights,
check the closets and cupboards...

880
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:37,030
...look under all the beds.

881
01:38:37,239 --> 01:38:39,195
Because you never can tell.

882
01:38:39,999 --> 01:38:43,548
There just might be
a gremlin in your house.

883
01:41:46,359 --> 01:41:47,348
