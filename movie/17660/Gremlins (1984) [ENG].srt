1
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,899
Friends, let me introduce myself.

2
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,485
Peltzer's the name.
Rand Peltzer.

3
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,904
That's me there on the corner.

4
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,906
I'm an inventor.

5
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,284
And I have a story to tell.

6
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,078
I know.
Who hasn't got a story?

7
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,165
Well, nobody's got a story
like this one.

8
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,042
Nobody.

9
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,794
It all started here in Chinatown.

10
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,797
I was trying
to move a little merchandise...

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,383
...maybe find a present
for my kid.

12
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,802
I tried this one place.

13
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,100
Wait a minute.

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,227
What's down here?

15
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,645
This is it.

16
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,315
This is your grandfather's store?

17
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,567
Come on.

18
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,072
No wonder you gotta drag
people in off the street.

19
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,954
Go ahead, mister.
Look around.

20
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,332
See if there's something you like.

21
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,228
Are these things real?

22
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,064
I told you, everything's real.

23
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,860
You do have
interesting artifacts here...

24
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,946
...but there's one thing
you don't have.

25
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,364
And what's that?

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,992
Let me show you.
I'm an inventor. I made this.

27
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,788
The Bathroom Buddy.
The invention of the century.

28
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,376
It eliminates the need to carry
heavy luggage when you travel.

29
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,546
You got yourself
your shaving mirror...

30
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:14,883
...your toothbrush, a toothpick.
You got toenail clippers...

31
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,969
...a nail file...

32
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,805
...and you got yourself
a dental mirror.

33
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,182
This is gonna revolutionize traveling.

34
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,269
Let's just say,
for the sake of argument...

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,896
...that you're on a bus,
a plane or a train.

36
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,233
You forgot to brush your teeth.

37
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:35,404
You got yourself a bad case
of dragon breath.

38
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,448
Bad breath.

39
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,033
What do you do?

40
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,828
No problem, friend.
All you do is...

41
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,746
...you take your toothbrush out...

42
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,707
...and you push this button.

43
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,043
That's absolutely no problem.

44
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,796
Cleans up easily.

45
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,924
What I'd like to do, sir,
is give you my card.

46
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,428
Rand Peltzer. "Fantastic Ideas
for a Fantastic World. "

47
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,138
I make the illogical logical.

48
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,724
I can get you these.

49
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,310
I can get them by the dozen
if you'd like.

50
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,943
What do you think?

51
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,948
Where's that coming from?

52
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,135
What is that?

53
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,511
Mogwai.

54
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,974
What's he doing?

55
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,392
Singing.

56
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,312
He does that sometimes.

57
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,820
I gotta have him.
He's incredible.

58
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,114
Tell you what I'll do.

59
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,243
- I'll give you $100 for him.
No.

60
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,788
I've gotta have him. It's
a present for my son for Christmas.

61
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,748
It's what I've been looking for.

62
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,501
I've been everywhere.
I'll give you $200.

63
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,211
That's $200!

64
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,837
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,091
Mogwai not for sale.

66
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,678
You said everything here was for sale.

67
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,887
Grandfather!

68
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,849
With mogwai comes much responsibility.

69
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,395
I cannot sell him at any price.

70
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,028
Wait outside. I'll be right out.

71
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,613
Just go.

72
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,126
Okay, mister, here it is.

73
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,545
What about your grandfather?

74
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,548
Forget what he said. He's crazy.
We need the money.

75
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,216
Do you want it or not?

76
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,676
I want it.

77
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,097
There's three rules
you've gotta follow.

78
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,724
What kind of rules?

79
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,392
Keep him out of the light.

80
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,562
He hates bright light,
especially sunlight.

81
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,938
It'll kill him.

82
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,734
And keep him away from water.
Don't get him wet.

83
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:22,738
But the most important rule,
the rule you can never forget...

84
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,199
...no matter how much he cries
or how much he begs...

85
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,287
...never, never feed him
after midnight. Got it?

86
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,872
Sure. Whatever you say.

87
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,875
Thanks.
And have a merry Christmas.

88
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,469
You're rolling with
Rockin' Ricky Rialto...

89
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,513
...the voice of Kingston Falls, U.S.A.!

90
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,382
Alex...

91
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,509
Getting close to Christmas.

92
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,053
You'll get stuck
with a lot of trees again.

93
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,348
I thought I'd see you about now.
Ow!

94
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,933
What the hell is this?

95
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,644
What are you doing in there?

96
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,396
Don't ask.

97
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,898
Alex, I came to get my tree.

98
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,943
Pete, take that tree
to Mr. Anderson's truck.

99
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,154
What do you say, Alex?

100
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,490
You can spare one
for the sheriff's station.

101
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,243
I paid for mine, Frank.

102
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,001
Billy, you need a jump?

103
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,504
No, thanks, Mr. Futterman.
I'm late for work as it is.

104
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,591
These goddamn foreign cars
always freeze up on you.

105
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,011
You don't find American
machinery doing that.

106
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,429
See that plow?

107
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,223
Hasn't given me a day's trouble
in 15 years.

108
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,142
You know why?
Kentucky Harvester.

109
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,521
It ain't some foreign piece of crap.
That's a Kentucky Harvester.

110
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,025
If I wanna keep my job,
I should be going now.

111
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,985
How's your comic strip coming?

112
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,281
I expect to see you in the funnies
with "Smilin' Jack," "Li'I Abner. "

113
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,783
They don't run those comics anymore.

114
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,243
They don't?

115
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,245
Come on, Barn.

116
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,956
Say hello to your wife, okay?

117
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,625
So long, Billy.

118
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,089
Goddamn foreign cars.

119
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,615
Hey, doctor.

120
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,200
Morning, Billy.

121
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,848
Morning, Tom.
Hey, Billy. Barney.

122
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,320
Get in there and be quiet.

123
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,174
- You just made it.
- Again.

124
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,343
Will you sign this petition?

125
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,429
Sure. What's it for?

126
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,681
To declare Dorry's pub a landmark.

127
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,350
Mrs. Deagle's trying to take
his lease away.

128
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,685
His too?

129
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,105
Yeah, she says it's a dive,
a public nuisance.

130
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,357
That's where my dad
proposed to my mom.

131
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,194
That's where everybody's dad
proposed to their mom. Cross your "T."

132
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,533
Thanks.

133
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,626
Good morning, Mrs. Deagle.

134
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,461
What's good about it?

135
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,090
Klutz!

136
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,511
Watch it, watch it!

137
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,890
40, 60, 80...

138
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,274
Two hundred. Thank you.

139
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,026
- Mrs. Deagle?
- What?

140
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,196
I just wanted you to know
that Joe got another job.

141
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,739
My husband, Joe Harris.

142
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,699
And I've taken up some sewing.

143
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,701
What are you trying to tell me?

144
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,913
Neither of us will be paid
for two weeks.

145
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,082
Couldn't you get Mr. Corben...

146
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,459
...to give us a little more time?

147
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,835
Mrs. Harris...

148
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,296
...the bank and I have
the same purpose in life...

149
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,423
...to make money.

150
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,300
Not to support a lot of...

151
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,677
...deadbeats.

152
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,639
Mrs. Deagle, it's Christmas!

153
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,729
Now you know what to ask Santa for,
don't you?

154
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,608
Mommy, I'm hungry.

155
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,236
Yes, honey. So am I.

156
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,869
This is what's left
of my imported Bavarian snowman.

157
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,872
Your dog broke it this morning!

158
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,792
I'm terribly sorry.

159
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,544
Tell me how much I owe you...

160
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,337
I don't want money.

161
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,467
I want your dog.

162
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,722
Barney?

163
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,516
Give him to me.

164
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,853
I'll take him to the kennel.
They'll put him to sleep.

165
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,356
It'll be quick and painless,
compared to what I could do to him.

166
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,525
What could you do?

167
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,281
I'll catch the beast myself.

168
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,409
Then he'll get what he deserves.

169
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,162
A slow, painful death.

170
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,916
Maybe I'll put him in my spin dryer
on high heat.

171
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,294
That'd do it.

172
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,550
Barney!

173
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,137
Barney, will you get off of her?

174
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,931
My dear lady, are you all right?

175
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,393
I have a very weak heart.
I can't stand a shock like that!

176
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,562
What is that dog doing in here?

177
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,522
This is a bank, not a pet store.

178
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,690
Very good, Gerald.

179
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,192
He wouldn't hurt you.

180
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,320
Excuses, excuses.
You're just like your father.

181
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,824
I've listened to his excuses
for 10 years, the loser!

182
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,952
As for you, you mangy cur...

183
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,038
...I'll get you...

184
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,749
...when you least expect it!

185
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,626
Oh, my heart!

186
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,754
I must apologize
for this most unusual...

187
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,631
You putz.

188
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,720
The old bat never looked better.

189
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,847
It's great. You're doing fine.

190
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,682
Thanks.

191
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,559
Hello, Gerald.

192
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,854
If it isn't Captain Clip-on.

193
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,483
Guess who almost applied
for unemployment today?

194
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,985
- I give up.
- You.

195
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,072
But Mr. Corben had second thoughts.

196
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,908
He gets so sentimental
about the holidays.

197
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,827
Imagine that.

198
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,579
I would've fired you in a second.

199
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,082
Merry Christmas to you too.

200
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,125
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

201
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,462
Hey, Peltzer.

202
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,799
Look, I'm a junior
vice president at 23.

203
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,386
By the time I'm 25,
I'm gonna have Mr. Corben's job.

204
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,972
By the time I'm 30,
I'll be a millionaire.

205
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,807
Look at you.

206
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,935
You're practically supporting
your whole family.

207
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,187
The world's changing.

208
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,857
You gotta change with it.
You gotta be tough.

209
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,277
Tough? And no one's
tougher than you, Ger?

210
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,947
Don't call me that.
My name's Gerald.

211
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,448
Can I get you a drink?

212
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,118
Give me a vodka martini.
Shake, don't stir.

213
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,327
You work here?

214
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,122
Weeknights so Dorry doesn't
have to pay an extra waitress.

215
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,290
That's great.

216
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,751
Yeah, that's swell, if you
like working for nothing.

217
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,213
Two more rounds for the pool table,
on the house.

218
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,216
You haven't seen my new apartment.

219
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,260
I haven't seen your old apartment.

220
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,806
We're talking cable.
Can we have dinner tomorrow night?

221
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,726
I'm working.

222
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,147
Why don't you tell Dorry
you're sick? He can't dock your pay.

223
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,824
Billy, is that you?

224
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,576
Yeah, Mom, it's me.

225
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,745
I'm in the kitchen.

226
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,498
Merry Christmas!

227
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,671
Merry Christmas, movie house!

228
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,341
Merry Christmas, emporium!

229
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,177
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

230
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,012
Do you need any help?

231
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,389
Yeah, you could do the eggs.

232
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,183
Thanks.

233
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,963
Dad's machines work so well
the first couple of weeks, then...

234
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,714
Use the sink.

235
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,972
Is something wrong?

236
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,100
No, it's a sad movie.

237
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,063
How was your day?

238
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,564
It was fine.

239
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,528
Come on, what is it?
What's wrong?

240
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,532
Mrs. Deagle called again
this afternoon.

241
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,081
Let's not talk about it now.
Don't say anything to Dad.

242
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,541
Fine with me.

243
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,341
Hi, sweetheart!

244
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,179
- Welcome home.
- Hey, Dad.

245
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,017
I'm glad you're back.
How was the trip?

246
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,184
It was great.

247
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,062
The Miracle Company, who has
the Kitchen Companion...

248
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,149
...might be interested
in the Bathroom Buddy.

249
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,775
Great!

250
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,321
- Thanks!
- You'll like this.

251
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,866
What is it? A birdcage?

252
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,911
No, don't shake it. Open it now.
It won't wait till Christmas.

253
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,458
It's a puppy, isn't it?

254
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,293
Yeah, I can tell.

255
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,961
It's a new car.

256
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,803
- Honey, would you dim the lights?
- Sure.

257
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,389
Dim the lights?
Does it glow in the dark?

258
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,100
It's important. Trust me.

259
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,062
Go ahead, open it.

260
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,668
What is it?

261
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,462
It's your new pet.

262
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,589
Come on, Barney.
Be a good dog.

263
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,267
You're kidding.

264
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,064
Dad, it's really neat.

265
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,276
Where'd you get this?

266
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,987
Some little junk store in Chinatown.

267
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,199
- Can I pick him up?
- Sure, go ahead. Just be careful.

268
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,992
- You gotta be gentle.
- I will.

269
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,870
I hope he's housebroken.

270
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,707
Isn't he cute?

271
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,293
Has it got a name?

272
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,711
Mogwai.

273
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,005
- What?
Mogwai.

274
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,217
Some Chinese word.
I just call him...

275
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,011
...Gizmo.
He seems to like it.

276
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,059
Look up here a minute.

277
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,229
We're getting our picture taken.

278
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,438
Smile.

279
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,857
Ready?

280
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,734
One, two, three...

281
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,362
No, no.
Bright light!

282
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,697
What happened?

283
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,657
He hates bright lights.

284
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,244
There's some important things
I forgot to tell you.

285
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:28,583
Number one, he hates bright lights.
You gotta keep him out of the sunlight.

286
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,918
Sunlight will kill him.

287
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,754
Number two, keep him
away from water.

288
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:39,093
Don't give him any water to drink.
Whatever you do, don't give him a bath.

289
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,596
And the most important thing...

290
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,725
...don't ever feed him
after midnight.

291
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,673
Shh!

292
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,344
Looks like you hurt yourself.

293
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,473
Light bright! Light bright!

294
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,981
Just sit down there
and don't fall off, okay?

295
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,483
I'll get you fixed up in no time.

296
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,862
All right.

297
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,156
Hold still.

298
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,493
Sorry. Sorry.

299
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,086
Try not to move so much, okay?

300
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,523
Good night, Giz.
I'll see you in the morning.

301
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,284
Hello!

302
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,912
Mrs. Peltzer?

303
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,458
I got a tree!

304
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,294
Oh, Christ!

305
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,756
Billy!

306
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,305
I just brought in
your Christmas tree.

307
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,099
What happened?

308
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,394
Slight problem
with the Peltzer Peeler-Juicer.

309
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,063
I thought your dad fixed it.

310
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,940
I thought so too.

311
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,570
You should just buy orange juice
in cartons. It's a lot easier.

312
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,698
See, it works.

313
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,081
I had to come.
So I see.

314
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,250
Now I can see. It takes...

315
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,001
...a certain kind of guy.

316
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,088
And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.

317
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,153
It's no problem, Pete.
Leave it up here.

318
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,529
What'll you tell him?

319
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,741
I'll just tell him a bunch of
bikers stole it from me on my way home.

320
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,873
Wow! The Hooded Menace.
Issue number one!

321
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,374
Pretty neat, huh?

322
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,042
Where'd you get it?

323
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,753
Dr. Fantasy's, I think.

324
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,883
- What's that?
- Come here. I'll show you.

325
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,552
This is my new pet.
My dad gave him to me.

326
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,053
Neat! What's his name?

327
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,556
His name's Gizmo. Hi, Giz.

328
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,475
He's a mogwai.

329
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,399
Cute!

330
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,030
Blink your eyes.

331
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,575
Go like that.
Can you do that?

332
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,708
Watch. Maybe he'll sing.

333
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,338
Come on, Giz.
Let's go over to the table.

334
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,923
I'll be careful.

335
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,301
There we go.

336
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,015
Gee, Billy, where
can I get one of those?

337
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,060
I don't know.
This is the only one I've ever seen.

338
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,103
Can I hold him?

339
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,107
Sure. I don't see why not.
He seems to like you.

340
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,444
Great! Thanks a lot.

341
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,904
Sorry.

342
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,948
What was in that jar?

343
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,699
Nothing! Just water!

344
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,285
Why is he making that noise?

345
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,670
What is it?

346
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:48,963
I don't know.

347
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,469
Is it alive?

348
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,471
I don't know.

349
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,908
One, two, three,
four, five new ones.

350
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,661
Now can I have one?

351
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,954
I don't know.

352
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,707
Look, that one's got
a cute stripe on its head.

353
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,047
Isn't that incredible, Pete?

354
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,132
Yeah, great.

355
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,552
Don't you think this...?
This is incredible!

356
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,305
Oh, it is neat.

357
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,725
I'm serious. It's neat.

358
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,065
Gizmo, what's the matter?

359
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,748
- No, no, no.
- Hey, Dad?

360
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,086
- There's something I should tell you.
- Look.

361
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,254
You're familiar
with the Bathroom Buddy?

362
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,882
I have made an improvement.

363
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,092
Watch this.

364
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:02,262
Now, let's say you're
late for the big meeting.

365
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,847
It's really important.

366
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,060
You're on your way. You reach up.
You forgot to shave.

367
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,271
What're you gonna do?
Under normal circumstances...

368
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,273
...you are in trouble.

369
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,235
But not if you have
the Bathroom Buddy.

370
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,278
Watch this.

371
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,865
What do you think?

372
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,118
That's pretty neat.

373
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,870
What's this button?

374
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,626
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's okay.

375
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,836
I'm sorry.

376
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:37,548
It's not your fault. I'm working
on that. I haven't finished that.

377
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:41,260
I came up here because
there's a problem with the mogwai.

378
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,011
Yeah, what's that?

379
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,306
It multiplies with water.

380
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,560
What?

381
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,398
Do you see what I mean?

382
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,151
I don't believe that.

383
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,278
All that from water?
They got wet?

384
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,821
Plain water.

385
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,327
It's funny.
The new ones aren't like Gizmo.

386
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,663
The striped one
seems to be the leader.

387
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,914
You know what?

388
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,418
I'll bet every kid in America
would like one of these.

389
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,171
They might replace
the dog as the family pet.

390
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,017
Think about it.

391
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,144
The Peltzer Pet.

392
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,566
This could really be the big one.

393
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,379
Barn?

394
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:28,575
Barney?

395
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,247
Barney, who did this to you?

396
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,207
Hold on, I'll get you down.

397
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,750
Stay still.

398
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,588
Poor dog. Another minute
and he would've been a dog-sicle.

399
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:47,219
All I know is that I'm positive
that I closed and locked the door.

400
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,347
How else did she get to him?

401
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:54,726
We can't point any fingers,
not even at Mrs. Deagle.

402
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,897
She's been threatening him.
She'd love to get her hands on him.

403
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:04,236
We don't have proof. We can't even
find footprints leading up to the house.

404
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,949
I'm gonna take Barney
to your grandmother's.

405
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,744
Take him there on the way to the
convention, pick him up on the way home.

406
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:16,623
He'll be here for Christmas.
It'll be all right.

407
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,298
I don't think we can drink this.

408
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,596
Why not?

409
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,681
What's wrong with this?

410
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,316
Hey, Billy.

411
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,151
Is that a mogwai?

412
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,321
Yeah, I'm gonna have
Mr. Hanson check it out.

413
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:51,241
And all of a sudden, there were
five new ones like this one.

414
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,578
Now watch this.

415
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:35,285
Can I keep one of these here,
run some tests on him?

416
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,455
I think I can spare one.

417
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,550
This is some Christmas,
Katie, I'll tell you.

418
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,806
First the old bat closes the factory,
and now it's my goddamn plow.

419
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,059
Mr. Futterman, guess what?
It's time to go home now.

420
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,520
- How about one more beer?
- No, it's late.

421
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,647
One more beer,
I'll help you clean up.

422
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,566
No, thanks, though.
It'll be okay.

423
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,030
- It'll be okay.
- It will not be okay.

424
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,410
I brought my plow in for a tune-up
and found it loaded with foreign parts.

425
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,913
I mean, everything.
Gaskets, pistons, spark plugs.

426
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,999
All of it's foreign.

427
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,251
Billy!
Hi.

428
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,838
Going home?

429
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,423
Oh, yeah.

430
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,845
Gremlins!

431
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,265
You gotta watch out for foreigners.

432
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,809
They plant gremlins
in their machinery.

433
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,855
The same gremlins brought down
our planes in the big one.

434
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,065
That's right.

435
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,817
World War II.

436
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,027
Good old...

437
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,612
...W- W-I-I.

438
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,119
They're still shipping them over here.

439
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,204
They put them in the cars, the TV.

440
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,124
They put them in the radios
you stick in your ears.

441
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,252
They put them in the watches.
Little teeny gremlins.

442
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,964
It's not a good idea that you drive.
Why don't you walk home?

443
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,384
You know, Katie, I think
maybe I'll walk home.

444
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,637
- Good.
- It's a nice night.

445
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,310
- Good night, kids.
- Good night.

446
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,106
Gremlins.

447
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:58,178
That was really good,
the way you handled Mr. Futterman.

448
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,180
I'm used to it.

449
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,517
He's been like that
ever since he lost his job.

450
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:08,939
He's like a lot of people around here.
He just wants somebody to listen.

451
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,024
Especially around the holidays.

452
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,652
Why is that?

453
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,696
It's when a lot of people
get really depressed.

454
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:22,702
I always thought everyone was happy
during the holidays, no matter what.

455
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,539
Most people are, but some aren't.

456
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,876
While everybody else opens up presents,
they're opening up their wrists.

457
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,212
Cheery thought.

458
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,049
It's true. The suicide rate's
always the highest around the holidays.

459
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,427
Now I'm depressed.

460
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,805
Do you ever get depressed on Christmas?

461
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,058
I don't celebrate Christmas.

462
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,685
Are you Hindu or something?

463
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,812
No, I just don't like to.

464
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,732
What's not to like?
I mean, it's a lot of fun.

465
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,067
God!

466
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,820
Say you hate Thanksgiving,
and nobody cares.

467
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:01,533
But say you hate Christmas, everybody
makes you feel like you're a leper.

468
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,996
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

469
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:10,500
I'm sorry. I'm just
a little tired and cranky.

470
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,043
Yeah.

471
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,424
Thanks for walking me home.

472
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,676
No problem.

473
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,553
- Good night.
- Good night.

474
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,763
Kate?

475
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,562
I was just wondering, do you
get any free nights off from Dorry's?

476
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,190
Thursdays.

477
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,692
Thursdays, yeah.

478
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,486
Because I was just wondering...

479
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:43,200
...if you're free this Thursday night,
maybe you'd like to go out on a date...

480
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,327
...with me?

481
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,620
I'd love to.

482
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,748
Oh, yeah?

483
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,583
Well, that's great!

484
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,380
We can talk about it
on the phone and kind of...

485
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,591
...square everything away.

486
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,136
Good night, Billy.

487
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,646
'Night.

488
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,873
Hey there.

489
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,545
Give me your arm, boy.
Come here, come on.

490
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,674
Give me your arm.
No, this is not gonna hurt.

491
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,385
This isn't gonna hurt.

492
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,138
Not a big guy like you. Come on.

493
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,268
There you go.
See, that's not so bad. Come on.

494
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,396
Good, good.
Oh, that's good.

495
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:58,525
Just a little blood test, pal.
You'll never miss it.

496
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,031
They're like huge seedpods!

497
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,082
- Having fun?
- Fun!

498
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,542
Pretty neat, huh?

499
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,918
Neat!

500
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,463
Yum, yum! Yum, yum!

501
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,220
How about shutting up
for a change, okay?

502
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,055
I already fed you.

503
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,231
Well, it's not 12:00 yet.

504
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:42,944
All right. Keep an eye on them, Giz.
I'll be back in a second.

505
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,592
Here we go.

506
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,762
Now maybe you guys will be quiet.

507
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,274
You guys are really hungry.

508
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,945
Giz, you want some?

509
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,368
Do you want some chicken?

510
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,120
No?

511
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,663
All right.

512
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,297
Yum, yum.

513
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,644
That's it, good buddy.
Call it a night.

514
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,852
Can't you see?
They're after you!

515
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,689
They're after all of us!
Our wives, our children, everyone!

516
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,526
They're here already!
You're next!

517
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:51,448
You're next!
You're next! You're next!

518
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,082
Uh-oh.

519
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,836
Mom?
Yeah?

520
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,338
Mom, could you come up here, please?

521
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:16,723
Then I want you to bring
the vacuum cleaner upstairs for me.

522
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,148
What are they?

523
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,068
Well, they're the mogwai, I guess.

524
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,653
Except for Gizmo.

525
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,240
Did you get them wet?

526
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,618
No.

527
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,371
Did you feed them
after midnight?

528
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,624
Well, I gave them
some chicken.

529
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,417
But I made sure that it...

530
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,087
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

531
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,089
I made sure...

532
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,181
Mom?

533
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,266
What's going on here?

534
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,478
Yuck!

535
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,524
What'd you say this was called?

536
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,609
A putrid stage?

537
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,529
Pupal. Pupal stage.

538
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,322
Like a butterfly.

539
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,573
Yeah, right.

540
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:20,537
This is a cocoon, and inside
he's going through changes.

541
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,997
Lots of changes.

542
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,916
Like my mother.

543
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,627
No, that's different.

544
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:31,339
This is called a metamorphosis.

545
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,716
It's a change in form...

546
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,969
...and in appearance.

547
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,153
Hello?

548
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,747
Hello? Hi, honey!

549
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,374
No, I'm sure it works fine.

550
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,835
I was just out on the back porch
for a second.

551
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,379
The convention's great.

552
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,217
I said it's great!

553
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,011
Actually, the competition's...

554
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,220
Sorry, miss.

555
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,265
The competition's a little more
advanced than I expected.

556
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:26,394
I was changing my oil.
Some really neat things.

557
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,733
Oh, Rand.

558
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,695
You've never been so far
away on Christmas Eve before.

559
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,698
I know it's Christmas Eve.

560
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,701
I'll do the best I can.

561
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,703
All right. Bye-bye.

562
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,082
All I could get for it was $36!

563
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:52,045
If there's anything I can do...
But it's completely out of my hands.

564
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,796
I'll be delighted...

565
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,050
Hello, Gerald.
I'm under such terrible pressure.

566
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,053
Why don't you just
speak to Mrs. Deagle about it?

567
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,555
Speak to Mrs. Deagle?

568
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,559
Mrs. Deagle!

569
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,145
Deposit this to my account.

570
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,155
Where's that psychotic canine?

571
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,324
Still hiding under the counter?

572
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:24,077
No, I'm afraid he's on vacation.

573
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:27,246
Better keep him behind locked doors,
because if I catch him...

574
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,749
...he's in for a slow death.

575
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,258
Here's Mr. Bird's heart.

576
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,971
Small animals lose heat
faster than large ones.

577
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,433
Their blood must circulate
faster to keep their bodies warm.

578
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,851
Now, in small birds...

579
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,938
...their hearts beat
about 600 times per minute.

580
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,190
Cats, 130.

581
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:55,983
Man, about 75...

582
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:59,946
...and a big old elephant's heart,
only 25 a minute.

583
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:03,282
Hey, doc, you
got a human heart?

584
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:08,162
Has he got a human heart?
Wait till you see this! Roll 10.

585
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,857
Okay, class.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

586
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,193
If any of you wanna bring me
a present...

587
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,653
...a cassette deck wouldn't be bad.

588
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,948
Of course, tickets to the Super Bowl
would be very nice.

589
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:30,161
Mr. Hanson, wait.
Let me just talk to you for a second.

590
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,247
Bye.

591
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:03,778
Billy...

592
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,824
It just hatched.

593
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,784
I'll be right there.

594
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,431
Hey there.

595
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,979
You remember me?

596
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,113
Remember me, don't you?

597
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,615
I went and got you...

598
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,493
...a candy bar.

599
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,996
I thought you might be hungry.

600
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,748
You hungry?

601
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,339
You should try one of these.

602
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,898
Hey there.

603
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:26,360
Come here. Don't be afraid.
There's no reason to be afraid.

604
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,988
Where'd you go?

605
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,992
Where are you?
I know you're in there.

606
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,036
I know you're under there.

607
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,372
Come on, now.

608
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:42,418
You're not still angry
about that little blood test, are you?

609
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,880
Come on out.
Take a bite. Let me see you.

610
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,716
I just wanna see you.

611
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,847
You try some of this now.
I know you gotta be hungry.

612
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,351
Yum, yum.

613
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,064
There now. Don't you feel better?

614
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,713
Mr. Hanson?

615
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,787
Yum, yum.

616
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,476
Gizmo ca-ca!

617
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,816
Billy, are you okay?
Where are you?

618
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,652
Mom, they hatched.
Get out of the house.

619
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,238
Phone home. Ca-ca!

620
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,408
Mom? Mom!

621
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:32,226
Yum, yum.

622
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,223
Get out of my kitchen!

623
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,798
Neat!

624
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,694
Hey!

625
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,493
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

626
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,754
Mom, it's Stripe!

627
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,935
- Should I get it?
- Yeah, go ahead and get it.

628
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,021
Oh, I didn't mean that.

629
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,983
Hello, Dr. Molinaro. Can we come in?

630
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,277
My mom's had a bit of an accident.

631
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,239
Be careful!

632
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,908
What happened?

633
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,793
Giz?

634
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,851
Bright light! Bright light!

635
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,478
Come here.

636
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,563
They almost got you, huh?

637
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,857
Climb in here.

638
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,905
The question is
totally without meaning.

639
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,450
Pardon me, sir. Stuff.

640
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,578
Thick and heavy.

641
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,498
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?

642
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:08,794
I rarely use it myself, sir.
It promotes rust.

643
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,390
Don't worry, Giz, we'll find him.

644
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,946
Gremlins, huh?

645
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,156
Little monsters.
- Right.

646
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:47,577
- Hundreds of them?
- I'm not sure. Maybe thousands.

647
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,790
Look, I know it sounds crazy.
I know it does.

648
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:55,585
But in a matter of hours,
this town's gonna be a disaster area.

649
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,254
You've got to warn people!

650
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:00,507
- You think this kid is drunk?
- No, but you are.

651
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:01,967
I am not drunk!

652
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:06,346
Tell me something. Where do
these little gremlins come from?

653
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:07,723
All right.

654
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:11,351
My father gave me one as a present.

655
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:15,105
Does your father always
give you vicious little monsters?

656
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:18,108
No, they don't
start out vicious at first!

657
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,568
Of course not.

658
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:23,029
They don't!
They look like this.

659
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,949
Could you dim the lights?

660
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,659
Sure.

661
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,495
Go ahead, Brent.
Dim the lights.

662
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,798
Gusto!

663
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,823
Right, Murray?

664
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,502
Sheila, will you quit messing
with the TV?

665
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,421
You have the thingy.

666
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,677
Goddamn foreign TV.

667
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,015
We should've got a Zenith!

668
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:44,653
Foreigners.

669
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,034
I can't get a damn thing on this!

670
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:53,119
Where are you going?

671
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,540
I'm gonna check the antenna.
Maybe the damn thing blew down.

672
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,458
Be careful, dear.

673
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,353
What the hell is that?

674
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:07,319
- It's them!
- You're crazy!

675
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:10,280
There's a real gremlin in my cab!

676
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,731
Hello, Anderson.
Wanna mail something, do you?

677
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,942
Just a last-minute package, Father.

678
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,485
Be my guest.

679
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:51,988
That's strange.

680
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,144
Patriotic little fellow, ain't he?

681
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,355
Waving the flag and everything.

682
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:30,110
Be careful, Frank!
He might tear your arm off.

683
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,487
You want me to put the cuffs on him?

684
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:35,240
Tell me. How come
a cute guy like this...

685
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:37,951
...can turn into
a thousand ugly monsters?

686
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,246
You see, this is before
it enters the pupal stage.

687
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:42,706
It multiplies with water.

688
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:47,002
Get the kid some water.
I wouldn't do that.

689
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:48,712
Sheriff's office.

690
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,797
Yeah, speaking.

691
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,300
What?

692
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,013
Oh, no.

693
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:01,224
Yeah, sure, we'll be right over.

694
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,309
What happened?

695
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:05,145
The Futtermans.

696
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,441
Something about a snowplow.
A freak accident.

697
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:10,984
It's the creatures!

698
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,571
The creatures are making it
look like an accident!

699
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,407
Will you listen to me?

700
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:19,367
You listen to me, kid!

701
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,745
Go on home, take little Gizmo...

702
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:25,248
...sit by the fireplace
and open your Christmas presents.

703
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,875
Attaboy.

704
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,544
Let me drive.
No, you're drunk.

705
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,837
You always drive!

706
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,256
Because I'm the sheriff, asshole.

707
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,734
Kopeck, you stop that, you bad kitty!

708
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,487
Kopeck's a bad kitty.

709
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,947
Ruble's a good little kitty.

710
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:03,328
We'll find you something to eat.
She's a good kitty.

711
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,583
Here we go. Here we go. Come on.

712
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,335
All right, you stop that!

713
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:12,128
Stop it!

714
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:19,052
Mean kitty, you start eating
before everybody gets here.

715
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,929
Come on, Dollar Bill.

716
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:23,848
Yes, here we go, Dollar Bill.

717
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,310
Mommy'll fix you
something good to eat.

718
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,937
Everybody here?

719
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:32,065
All right, let go of Mommy's coat.

720
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,274
Here.

721
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,490
Christmas carolers.

722
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,868
I hate Christmas carolers.

723
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,997
Screechy-voiced little glue-sniffers.

724
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:51,751
I warned you brats!

725
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,712
Ya-ya-ya! Ya-ya-ya!

726
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:08,518
What are they?

727
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:10,728
What are they?!

728
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:17,986
They're here!

729
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:21,364
They've come for me!
They've come!

730
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,618
I'm not ready.

731
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,830
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not ready!

732
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:56,191
My God, Frye!

733
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:57,984
That was Mrs. Deagle.

734
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,870
Get them off! Get them off! Help me!

735
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,999
That's Dave Myers.
He does Santa every year.

736
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,173
What the hell is he doing now?

737
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:23,092
What's that stuff he's
got all over him?

738
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,889
Frank, I really think
we should go now.

739
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:31,267
Start the car. I'd really like
to go back to the station.

740
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:34,103
Please!

741
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:38,733
Frank!

742
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,133
Jesus, Frank!

743
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:05,969
What the hell are those things?

744
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:10,598
It's Christmas.
What the hell's going on?

745
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:11,933
Shut up, will you?!

746
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,921
I don't believe it.

747
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:48,261
You're on with Rockin' Ricky! Go!

748
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,221
Hi, my name's Pete.

749
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,474
These green guys are
running around wrecking things.

750
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:56,102
This is Christmas, not Halloween!

751
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:57,395
Listen, gang.

752
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,898
Rockin' Ricky's getting fed up
with this Orson Welles crap!

753
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:04,819
What's that? Kitty, what's that?
Some of Rockin' Ricky fans?

754
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:07,613
You're not a Rockin' Ricky fan!

755
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:35,391
Sir, I notice that you're a smoker.

756
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:39,937
I notice that you're a smoker.
I see the cigarettes.

757
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,483
I noticed, here, this broken ashtray.

758
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:47,111
It's very fortunate
that I happened to come by.

759
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:51,074
Let me introduce myself. My name's
Randall Peltzer. I'm an inventor.

760
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:54,619
"Fantastic Ideas for a Fantastic World. "
I make the illogical logical.

761
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:58,414
I have something here that I think
you might be interested in.

762
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:00,625
Yes, sir, I do.

763
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,460
This is...

764
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,296
...the Peltzer Smokeless Ashtray.

765
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:08,466
I think this can solve
your problem here, sir.

766
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:03,187
Please don't bite me!

767
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:05,690
Wait a minute.

768
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,730
You all right?

769
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,398
Let's get out of here!

770
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:39,070
What's that?

771
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:42,156
Don't worry. He's with me.
He's not one of them.

772
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,706
What's wrong?
Why isn't the car starting?

773
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:54,043
We're gonna have to
make a run for it, okay?

774
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:56,587
One, two, three!

775
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:32,623
They've been here too.

776
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:36,335
What are these things?
Where do they come from?

777
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:39,714
They're gremlins, Kate.

778
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,259
Just like Mr. Futterman said.

779
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:52,435
Now I have another reason
to hate Christmas.

780
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:54,812
What are you talking about?

781
01:18:55,772 --> 01:19:00,317
The worst thing that ever
happened to me was on Christmas.

782
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,320
Oh, God. It was so horrible.

783
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,659
It was Christmas Eve.

784
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,995
I was 9 years old.

785
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:15,291
Me and Mom were decorating the tree...

786
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:18,043
...waiting for Dad
to come home from work.

787
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:21,630
A couple hours went by.

788
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,507
Dad wasn't home.

789
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:26,510
So Mom called the office.
No answer.

790
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:32,683
Christmas Day came and went,
and still nothing.

791
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:36,645
So the police began a search.

792
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,398
Four or five days went by.

793
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:42,485
Neither one of us
could eat or sleep.

794
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:45,321
Everything was falling apart.

795
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,699
It was snowing outside.

796
01:19:49,659 --> 01:19:54,038
The house was freezing, so I went
to try to light up the fire.

797
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,415
That's when I noticed the smell.

798
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:03,714
The firemen came and
broke through the chimney top.

799
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:08,052
And me and Mom were expecting
them to pull out a dead cat or a bird.

800
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:11,055
And instead they pulled out my father.

801
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:18,729
He was dressed
in a Santa Claus suit.

802
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:22,107
He'd been climbing down the chimney...

803
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:24,610
...his arms loaded with presents.

804
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:27,071
He was gonna surprise us.

805
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:33,369
He slipped and broke his neck.
He died instantly.

806
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:40,417
And that's how I found out
there was no Santa Claus.

807
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:47,758
Don't worry about that smoke.
It'll stop. It's guaranteed.

808
01:20:58,228 --> 01:20:59,728
Barney, shut up!

809
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:02,356
Don't start with me.
I got a long way to go.

810
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:04,149
Shut up!

811
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,332
Where did they all go?

812
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,334
It'll be light soon.

813
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,711
I bet they're all
together someplace dark.

814
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:15,721
Mogwai!

815
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,192
Shh, Gizmo.

816
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:47,336
They're inside.

817
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:48,963
All of them?

818
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,679
Milk Duds.

819
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:19,678
What are they doing?

820
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:23,140
They're watching Snow White.

821
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,768
And they love it.

822
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,069
Where's the boiler room?

823
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:36,987
It's in the back of the theater.

824
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:52,169
Down there.

825
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,180
Milk Duds.

826
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:29,164
Yum, yum.

827
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:42,386
Cover your mouth.
Don't breathe any gas.

828
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:58,485
Billy!

829
01:25:58,653 --> 01:25:59,903
Go.

830
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:24,428
Billy!

831
01:26:42,405 --> 01:26:43,572
Billy!

832
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:48,952
- Hurry up!
- Move, Katie! Watch out!

833
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:52,915
Come on!

834
01:27:31,996 --> 01:27:32,996
Billy...

835
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:35,457
In the department store.

836
01:27:36,459 --> 01:27:37,793
Stripe!

837
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:09,491
That's Stripe.
He's the leader.

838
01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:14,871
If he gets to water,
it'll start all over again.

839
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:36,560
Take Giz, go back and try
and find some kind of light switch.

840
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,073
Careful, Billy.

841
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:03,188
Ward is your snowplow headquarters.

842
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,423
Attention, Christmas shoppers.

843
01:30:29,632 --> 01:30:34,469
Saturday morning at 8:30, we'll have
Santa Claus for all the kiddies.

844
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:51,653
We have the Kingston Falls...

845
01:30:53,072 --> 01:30:54,698
Attention, shoppers.

846
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:19,241
Light bright!

847
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:28,833
Bye-bye.

848
01:33:26,976 --> 01:33:28,893
It takes a certain kind of guy.

849
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:31,938
And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.

850
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:29,579
Water!

851
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,583
Gun!

852
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:36,961
It's been a rough night
for Rockin' Ricky...

853
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:40,548
...but he's still on the air!

854
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,885
The Marines are standing by
with fire hoses.

855
01:35:30,599 --> 01:35:32,392
Billy.

856
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:29,449
Gizmo ca-ca!

857
01:36:29,658 --> 01:36:31,701
Light bright! Light bright!

858
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:13,034
What the hell is that?

859
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:26,089
Your scarf.

860
01:38:29,361 --> 01:38:30,820
We switch to a report...

861
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:34,073
...from the scene of
the Christmas Eve riots.

862
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:39,579
This is Lew Landers,
WDHB's Action Central News...

863
01:38:39,788 --> 01:38:41,831
...at the site of Dorry's Tavern...

864
01:38:42,207 --> 01:38:45,627
...or what used to be Dorry's Tavern,
in Kingston Falls...

865
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:47,253
...where officials blame...

866
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:51,341
...mass hysteria for the escalating
series of unexplained...

867
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:55,929
...accidents, fires and explosions
that rocked this once-peaceful town...

868
01:38:56,472 --> 01:38:57,931
...on Christmas Eve.

869
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:01,225
The bizarre demise
of Mrs. Ruby Deagle, widow...

870
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:04,771
...of convicted stock-swindler
Donald Deagle...

871
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:07,148
Don't chew that.

872
01:39:07,399 --> 01:39:08,691
Don't chew.

873
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:13,571
I bet he'd like
some chicken soup.

874
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:23,498
Honey, this is the gentleman
who sold me the mogwai.

875
01:39:23,999 --> 01:39:27,877
"Sold. " An interesting choice of words.

876
01:39:32,257 --> 01:39:35,677
Conflicting eyewitness reports
concerning "little green men"...

877
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:42,266
You teach him to watch television?

878
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:50,817
There was, I believe, a box.

879
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:01,577
Dad...

880
01:40:12,047 --> 01:40:13,756
Rand, your scarf.

881
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:16,968
I warned you.

882
01:40:17,594 --> 01:40:20,888
With mogwai comes much responsibility.

883
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:22,557
But you didn't listen.

884
01:40:22,808 --> 01:40:25,143
And you see what happens.

885
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:27,186
I didn't mean it.

886
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:30,815
You do with mogwai what your society...

887
01:40:31,066 --> 01:40:35,194
...has done with all of nature's gifts.

888
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:37,530
You do not understand.

889
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:41,367
You are not ready.

890
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:53,713
Papa?
Yes?

891
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:59,510
He has something to say to you.

892
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,853
You understand what
he says when he speaks to you?

893
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:12,356
To hear, one has only to listen.

894
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:17,779
Bye, Billy.

895
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:26,829
Perhaps someday you may be ready.

896
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:28,956
Until then, mogwai...

897
01:41:29,374 --> 01:41:30,917
...will be waiting.

898
01:41:34,129 --> 01:41:35,505
Excuse me, sir.

899
01:41:36,381 --> 01:41:38,466
Before you go, I wanted to tell you...

900
01:41:38,717 --> 01:41:41,511
...that I am truly sorry
for what's happened.

901
01:41:42,012 --> 01:41:44,931
And if you would accept it,
I'd like to...

902
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:47,141
...give you this small token.

903
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:50,728
There's one other one.
This is an invention of mine.

904
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,980
Smokeless Ashtray.

905
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:54,232
How did you know?

906
01:41:54,441 --> 01:41:57,360
Man at gas station tried to sell me.

907
01:41:57,611 --> 01:42:00,321
Latest word in technology.

908
01:42:00,906 --> 01:42:03,074
Very generous of you.

909
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:06,160
I'm sure it will come in handy.

910
01:42:12,918 --> 01:42:14,710
Bye-bye, woof-woof.

911
01:42:32,312 --> 01:42:34,605
Well, that's the story.

912
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:39,735
So if your air conditioner goes on the
fritz, your washing machine blows up...

913
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:42,405
...or your video recorder conks out...

914
01:42:42,614 --> 01:42:44,657
...before you call the repairman...

915
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,286
...turn on the lights,
check the closets and cupboards...

916
01:42:48,787 --> 01:42:50,872
...look under all the beds.

917
01:42:51,081 --> 01:42:53,124
Because you never can tell.

918
01:42:53,959 --> 01:42:57,670
There just might be
a gremlin in your house.
