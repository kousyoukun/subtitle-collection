1
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:03,949
Hector, are we spinning yet?
Nice.

2
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:07,577
Chelios! How we doing, baby?
And you never call me no more.

3
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,122
Come on' what is that?
Where's the love?

4
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:12,207
How are you feeling?

5
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:15,293
I guess you're feeling like shit'
right about now.

6
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,628
You can't...

7
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,922
You can't move too good, huh?

8
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:22,217
You can't breathe too good.
What's wrong with you?

9
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:24,594
Wait' wait, wait' wait!
What is this?

10
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:28,306
Oh' fuck!

11
00:02:28,473 --> 00:02:31,727
Can you guess what this is?
I bet you can, Chelios.

12
00:02:31,893 --> 00:02:34,229
Hold on' check this out.

13
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:43,447
Oh! This is plain sick, man!

14
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,783
I must be the motherfucking genius of sick!

15
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,789
Poison Chev Chelios in his sleep?
That's like some Shakespeare or some shit.

16
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:58,003
You knocked this dude out pretty good!
About to get you a spot on the Dodgers, son.

17
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:01,339
Maybe you
don't understand what just happened.

18
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:04,468
I just fucking killed you.

19
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:08,597
Try not to embarrass yourself
because you're on 'Candid Camera'!

20
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,767
This shit here I gave you!
This is some...

21
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:15,979
high-tech' sci-fi,
Chinese synthetic bullshit!

22
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:19,316
I don't exactly know
what's in this shit, dude!

23
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:23,987
All I know is that once this shit
has binded with your blood cells,

24
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:27,032
you're fucked, baby,
and believe me it's binded.

25
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,161
Yeah' you got yourself about an hour' max.
Tick-tock.

26
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:35,540
Yeah, baby... sexy...
Oh' it's been real.

27
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:40,295
This shit's been real. You should've thought
twice before you whacked Don Kim.

28
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:45,342
Experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight?

29
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:47,177
I thought so.

30
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:51,390
Now' you have yourself a nice death.

31
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:55,811
Asshole!

32
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:04,736
You like that' huh?
Home run!

33
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,048
What do you think you're doing?
You can't just walk on my car!

34
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:09,801
What do you think you're doing'
motherfucker' walking on my car?

35
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,163
<i>It's Eve.
I'm glad you called, but I'm not here.</i>

36
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:43,001
<i>Leave a message, unless you're
selling something 'cause I'm not interested.</i>

37
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:46,922
<i>If you're not, then just...
Wait, time's up.</i>

38
00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:51,676
Get a cell phone' honey.
Please?

39
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:57,641
Come on.

40
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:59,142
Come on.

41
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:03,939
Dr' Miles office' may I help you?
- Yeah' let me speak to him.

42
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:07,651
<i>I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't in.
May I take a message?</i>

43
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:10,445
Where is he?
- I beg your pardon' sir?

44
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:12,447
Where the fuck is he?

45
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:14,032
No... yeah!

46
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:19,329
Wow!

47
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,043
Where you from?

48
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:28,630
I don't know, sir.
This is his answering service.

49
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:32,008
<i>Jesus fucking Christ.
- Would you like me to page him?</i>

50
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:33,552
Yeah, fine.

51
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:37,681
Please let the doctor know
that Chev Chelios is a dead man,

52
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:42,227
if he can't call me back within the hour.
- Could you spell that?

53
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:45,981
<i>Yeah' D-E-A-D! Chelios.
- Yes, sir.</i>

54
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:48,066
Thank you.

55
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:32,944
Hello.
- Kaylo, where were you last night?

56
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:37,074
What's up' Chev?
- I said' where were you last night?

57
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:39,284
I...

58
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,129
<i>Well, want to know what I was doing?
- What?</i>

59
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:53,423
Getting killed' you plum.
- What?

60
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:57,427
Yeah' you heard me.
Ricky fuckin' Verona...

61
00:07:57,594 --> 00:07:59,554
<i>Ricky Verona?
- Who'd a thought...</i>

62
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:03,225
that little bitch had the stones
to wet me in my own crib?

63
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:07,396
<i>I mean, it's inconceivable. Yet, here we are.
- Where are we?</i>

64
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:13,068
I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen to me.
Put the word out I'm looking for Verona.

65
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:16,488
<i>Anyone sees him you call me, understand?
- I...</i>

66
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:20,325
I'm gonna get that little fucker
if it's the last thing I do.

67
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:23,829
It may actually be the last thing I do.

68
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:25,914
You understand?
- Ricky Verona.

69
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:27,624
<i>You copy?
- Yeah.</i>

70
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,001
Find him!

71
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:58,113
Hey, man!

72
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:02,868
What the fuck you doing? Where am I going?
- Fuck you!

73
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:05,662
Bathroom don't work.
What you doing?

74
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:07,956
Yo, Chevy...
- Where's Verona?

75
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:09,666
Talk!
- What about?

76
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,669
Don't fuck with me!
- I'm not! Just calm down!

77
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:14,463
Don't tell me to calm down!

78
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:16,840
Fuck, man!
- Orlando? You all right?

79
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:22,137
Hey, there's a white nigger with a gun
up in here! Just be still' motherfuckers!

80
00:09:22,304 --> 00:09:26,475
You see that?
I'm trying to help you here' man.

81
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:28,185
I gotta find Ricky Verona.

82
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,354
Why would I know where Verona is?
- Yeah, yeah.

83
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:34,066
You don't know, but you're gonna tell me.

84
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:37,736
Or I'm gonna
blow your brains into the fuckin' toilet!

85
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,739
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

86
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:45,035
Whoa! Put your guns down!
The white man is cool!

87
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:48,830
The white man is...
The white man is cool!

88
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,251
Y'all like them Somalia niggers.

89
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:57,214
Now look, Chevy
came here to discuss something.

90
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:00,759
We gonna discuss
this shit in a civilized manner. Chevy?

91
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:05,097
You had a question? Or a point to make?
- Where's Verona?

92
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:08,934
Okay' I'm not affiliated with Ricky Verona.

93
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:12,938
You pulled the Anselmo job together.
Don't fuckin' bullshit me!

94
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:15,690
Easy! Easy! Easy!

95
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:19,069
All right?
Things are beginning to clarify.

96
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:22,406
See how that works' D?
Discussion leads to clarity.

97
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:24,866
That's what I was telling you before.

98
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:29,538
Look' you're operating under a false
pretence. Ricky and I did not pull...

99
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:33,417
the Anselmo job together.
Ricky fucked me on the Anselmo job.

100
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:37,462
In fact, Ricky Verona still owes me $7,500.

101
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:40,632
Not how I heard it.
- But that's the way it is.

102
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:44,261
So, you see' I don't know where Verona is.
If I did,

103
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:48,140
I'd probably be there right now'
beating the Gucci off his ass.

104
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,226
All right.

105
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:55,147
All right.

106
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:59,609
That's what I'm talking about.
That's almost civilized.

107
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:10,120
Shit' dude.
What's wrong with you?

108
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:14,291
I gotta find Ricky Verona.

109
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:19,963
Well' obviously. You've made that point
abundantly clear to all of us here' today.

110
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:24,634
How can I help you?
- Just give me some coke. You got any coke?

111
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,346
Now you're just going to
come in here and insult me?

112
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:31,266
I know you got coke.
- You think every brother's carrying?

113
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:33,101
Come on, I don't have time!

114
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:36,813
Just give me something.

115
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,524
I'm really dying, here.
- I can see that.

116
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:42,360
No, I'm really fucking dying!

117
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:45,155
Look, if I don't find Ricky Verona...

118
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:49,785
May I please have some coke?

119
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:55,499
You saying this is medicinal-use coke?
- That's right.

120
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,172
Well?

121
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,844
What?
- This shit ain't free, nigger.

122
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:14,684
That's enough.

123
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:25,153
What' you gonna do the shit right here?
Chevy, come on, man!

124
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:29,408
Oh' God!

125
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,702
Chevy...

126
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:33,328
What the...

127
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:37,916
Oh' that's good. That's good.
- That's good' right?

128
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:44,339
Why you looking for Verona' anyway?

129
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:56,727
Some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me.

130
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:59,938
This is about Don Kim.
- What do you know about it?

131
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,276
I know you pulled the trigger.
- Of course' I pulled the trigger.

132
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:07,362
Why wouldn't I pull the fuckin' trigger?

133
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:13,535
Whoa... Yo, Chelios, you good?

134
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,288
This shit ain't working.
- Excuse me?

135
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:18,582
I know what I have to do.

136
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:24,796
Well, shit.
A man's got to do what a man's got to do.

137
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:28,717
What is it you gotta do?
- I gotta kick some black ass.

138
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:30,469
What?

139
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:35,265
Shit!
- There he goes again.

140
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:39,144
Who wants white meat?

141
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,613
You ain't got shit, motherfucker!

142
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,949
Put that fuckin' twig down, bitch!
- Faggot!

143
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:58,997
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!

144
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,756
<i>Doc?
- What's up, Doc?</i>

145
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:10,926
You motherfucker!
- Why aren't you dead yet?

146
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:13,512
<i>What the fuck you doing?
- Coming for you.</i>

147
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:15,764
Fucking believe me.
- Whatever.

148
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:18,350
I'll be waiting,
but you won't make it.

149
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:24,356
You should know that I'm all about hooking up
with that mystery girl, you've been banging.

150
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:30,654
<i>Soon as you're underground. I forgot
to say so on that gay James Bond tape I left.</i>

151
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:35,534
What' and then you're gonna rape my
grandmother? Bla' bla' fuckin' bla.

152
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:40,622
You listen to me. What do you think Carlito
will do when he finds out what you did?

153
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:42,708
<i>Your whole crew is history!</i>

154
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,876
<i>Driver, pull over!
- Fuck!</i>

155
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:47,212
Great.

156
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:52,008
<i>You talking about Carlito?
Because me and Carlito, we're boys now.</i>

157
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:53,301
We're tight.

158
00:14:53,635 --> 00:14:56,680
Tight, like when your brother
fucked you in 3rd grade?

159
00:14:56,888 --> 00:15:01,727
That's snappy. But I did you pretty good,
didn't I Chelios?

160
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:03,353
<i>Admit it.
- We'll see.</i>

161
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,855
<i>Pull over!</i>

162
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:12,529
Know what the best part is?
- Sorry, must go. Bye-bye.

163
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:16,658
Yeah.
- Doctor Miles.

164
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:19,327
<i>Fuck! What took you so long?
Jesus Christ.</i>

165
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:23,874
Sorry' Chevy' I just got the message.
- Okay. Forget it. Listen, I'm dying!

166
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,585
I've been poisoned
with some Chinese synthetic shit.

167
00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:30,338
<i>What?
- You've gotta fucking do something for me.</i>

168
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:33,759
<i>What are your symptoms?
- It's like I'm slowing down.</i>

169
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:35,886
<i>Stuck in tar.
- Blurred vision?</i>

170
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:37,888
<i>Yeah.
- Dizzy?</i>

171
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:40,265
<i>Sure.
- Any pain in your chest?</i>

172
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:42,768
Not really.
I feel good' right now.

173
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,273
What are you doing?
- Driving through a mall' cops chasing me.

174
00:15:56,698 --> 00:15:59,618
The adrenaline is what's keeping you alive.

175
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:04,873
<i>Having a little trouble hearing you.
- You got to keep moving, Chevy.</i>

176
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:09,586
Explain.

177
00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:13,215
If I'm right'
they gave you the Beijing cocktail.

178
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,218
<i>It's very nasty shit.</i>

179
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:22,224
<i>It works on the adrenal gland,
blocks it's receptors.</i>

180
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:29,981
<i>The only thing you can do to slow it down,
is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant.</i>

181
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:34,319
Meaning' if you stop' you die.

182
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:35,570
Hang on.

183
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:40,158
<i>Jesus! What...</i>

184
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:42,327
<i>Are you there?
Are you okay?</i>

185
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,458
<i>What'd you say' Doc?
- If you stop, you die!</i>

186
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:56,341
That's what I'm trying to do.
Keep moving, keep the blood pumping.

187
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,095
<i>Chevy, you there?</i>

188
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:05,851
Every time I slow down'
it's like my veins start to rust.

189
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:09,646
<i>Did you take anything?
- Couple grams of coke.</i>

190
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:12,816
<i>That's a start.
I'll be in L.A. In an hour.</i>

191
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:17,112
<i>I'll call you as soon as I get there.
Do not stop moving!</i>

192
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:25,454
Taxi! Yo' yo' yo!

193
00:17:29,124 --> 00:17:30,834
Go!
- Where we go?

194
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:33,670
Just drive!

195
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:39,217
Would you mind...
- Where you want to go' man?

196
00:17:39,384 --> 00:17:41,386
Right.

197
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:49,352
Oh' shit!
- Go right!

198
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,189
Okay! Yes!
- Go fucking right!

199
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:05,744
Crank the music.

200
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:12,376
Crank it!

201
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:18,048
<i>But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart</i>

202
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:22,010
<i>I just don't think he'd understand</i>

203
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:26,056
<i>And if you tell my heart,
my achy breaky heart</i>

204
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:30,519
<i>It might blow up and kill this man</i>

205
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:39,277
Pull over' pull over.

206
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:45,909
Thanks, mate. I'll be back in one minute.
- Okay, cowboy.

207
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:52,541
Hey' buddy!

208
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:58,213
You move' you die.

209
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:43,675
<i>Hey, it's Eve. I'm glad you called...
- Fuck!</i>

210
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:57,647
Where to' man?

211
00:19:58,815 --> 00:20:00,984
Beverly Hills.

212
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:13,098
Chevy!
- Hey, boss.

213
00:21:14,224 --> 00:21:15,934
What a surprise.

214
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:20,105
Something urgent has come up.
- So I've heard.

215
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:23,108
Word travels fast.

216
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:28,238
Well' then you know what happened.
- You amaze me, my friend.

217
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:30,782
Well, what can I say?

218
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:34,119
Carlito' I need your help.
I don't have a lot of time.

219
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:39,291
No' not much.
- Yeah, we...

220
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:42,794
We've gotta find an antidote, or something.

221
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:48,383
What's the matter?
- That shit they gave you...

222
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,635
It's that Chinese shit.

223
00:21:50,802 --> 00:21:55,140
There is no antidote.
I wish there was something I could do.

224
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:57,768
What, that's it?
- Honestly,

225
00:21:58,643 --> 00:22:01,271
you should be dead already.

226
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:03,440
It's a miracle.
- A miracle?

227
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:05,317
We give that shit to horses.

228
00:22:05,734 --> 00:22:09,321
I don't fucking believe this.
- I'm sorry.

229
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:12,574
You don't have to be
so damn fucking cool about it!

230
00:22:15,243 --> 00:22:19,247
What do you expect me to do?
- Find that punk Verona,

231
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:24,002
and his whole fucking crew'
and feed them to a cage of wolverines.

232
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:30,175
What is this?
What' are you boys now or something?

233
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,177
Verona?

234
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:34,971
That's a small time punk.

235
00:22:36,264 --> 00:22:39,810
Not to say that this isn't an opportunity.
- Opportunity?

236
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:43,188
Everyone knows
the love I have for you' Chev.

237
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:47,275
But maybe this
makes up for the Don Kim hit which was...

238
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:50,362
perhaps ill-advised.
- Fuckin' Ill-advised?

239
00:22:52,823 --> 00:22:56,368
The heat from Hong Kong was
much more than we anticipated.

240
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:58,870
Well' that's outstanding' Carlito.

241
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:02,958
Glad to know my death
can be of some use to you.

242
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:07,129
Don't be difficult.
- I'm not being difficult.

243
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:11,800
I don't know if you noticed, but I'm
having a difficult fucking day' brother!

244
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:16,012
Are you disrespecting me?

245
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:20,350
Is that what you're doing?

246
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:30,652
Forget it.
I'm out of here.

247
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:02,434
You're not getting in my cab' wet!

248
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:08,023
I just gave you $200 to wait for 3 minutes.
- You're not getting in my car' no way!

249
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:11,109
Yeah' you're right.

250
00:24:13,236 --> 00:24:15,739
Al-Qaeda!
Al-Qaeda!

251
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:20,452
I love America!
I love Bush!

252
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:22,788
I Voted Bush!

253
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:42,099
Yeah.
- Hey' Chev. My flight's delayed.

254
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:44,643
<i>Shit!
- It's all right. Relax.</i>

255
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:49,940
I mean' don't relax. That shit they
gave you is cutting off your adrenaline.

256
00:24:50,273 --> 00:24:55,946
<i>Excitement, fear, danger. It causes your
body to make a chemical called ephedrine.</i>

257
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,783
<i>They introduced an inhibitor to your system.
- Fuck!</i>

258
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,995
<i>You've got to massively
increase the ephedrine level in your body,</i>

259
00:25:04,162 --> 00:25:06,832
<i>to force out the inhibitors.
Go to a hospital.</i>

260
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:09,501
Get epinephrine' an artificial adrenaline.

261
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:12,838
<i>It comes in 10-milligram syringes.</i>

262
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:16,800
A 5th of an injection will do.
It's potent, so don't overdo it.

263
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:19,970
Chevy? Did you get that?

264
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:24,766
<i>Did you get that?
- Yeah, epi-something.</i>

265
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:27,769
Okay' okay. I've gotta go.

266
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:31,940
<i>Now, I'll call you when I get there.</i>

267
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:35,027
<i>Yeah?
- Chev.</i>

268
00:25:35,152 --> 00:25:36,194
Yeah?

269
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:37,988
Chev?
- What?

270
00:25:38,864 --> 00:25:40,866
<i>Hello?</i>

271
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:44,161
Come on!

272
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:45,704
Mother!

273
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:49,875
<i>Chev?
- Yes' fuck?</i>

274
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,296
I just saw Verona's brother
walk into the Prince.

275
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,173
The Prince.
- Yeah.

276
00:25:56,339 --> 00:26:00,552
I was just down here getting a taco'
and he walked in' 2 minutes ago.

277
00:26:05,015 --> 00:26:08,393
Where are you' now?
- Across the street, getting a taco.

278
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,647
Where are you?
- I'm there. Meet me on 7th and Catalina.

279
00:26:34,878 --> 00:26:37,923
Is he in there, now?

280
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,425
Did anyone go in with him?

281
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:46,181
Right' wait here.

282
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:05,302
How'd you like that one' tough guy?
How frickin' awesome was that' huh?

283
00:28:08,972 --> 00:28:09,973
Well, well.

284
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:14,144
You feel like talking?
Where's your fuckin' brother?

285
00:28:14,936 --> 00:28:17,814
Doing your mother like a whore, you bitch!

286
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:23,445
Nice. I wonder
how many steaks I could carve out of you.

287
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,489
You died' motherfucker!

288
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:43,006
Yeah' wanna fuck with me' ese?

289
00:28:43,215 --> 00:28:46,218
What, you rolling pin mighty good?

290
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:49,888
What the hell you think you doing, huh?

291
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:55,227
What,
you want to dance with me' motherfucker?

292
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,023
I'll fuck you up!
Come on!

293
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:17,165
Jesus!
Nothing's easy.

294
00:29:20,377 --> 00:29:21,753
Wanna hold hands?

295
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:44,026
<i>Hey, talk to me' bro.
- Hey, Ricky.</i>

296
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:46,778
<i>You in the mood for sucking me off?</i>

297
00:29:46,945 --> 00:29:50,240
<i>Maybe let me lick your ass or something?</i>

298
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:53,118
<i>Who is this?
Shit! Chelios?</i>

299
00:29:53,285 --> 00:29:56,288
<i>Is this fucking Chelios?
- That's right, bro.</i>

300
00:29:56,413 --> 00:30:00,917
<i>Guess how I got your brother's phone.
I'm sure you have it all figured out.</i>

301
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:06,089
Looks like you should've
cut me up when you had the chance.

302
00:30:07,215 --> 00:30:13,388
I'm having a little trouble hearing you.
You experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight?

303
00:30:13,722 --> 00:30:15,891
You're supposed to be fucking dead!

304
00:30:16,058 --> 00:30:20,437
<i>You know, I kind of like that shit you put in
me. Gonna give me some more?</i>

305
00:30:20,896 --> 00:30:24,816
Well' I'm... I'm...
- I know, I know. Hey...

306
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,735
What's this?

307
00:30:30,906 --> 00:30:35,160
A necklace! You guys
really are faggots, aren't you?

308
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:40,957
You motherfucker! My grandfather gave
that medallion to my father and then he...

309
00:30:41,124 --> 00:30:42,501
Fuck!

310
00:30:43,668 --> 00:30:48,673
Fuck you, man! Shove that thing up your ass!
- No thanks.

311
00:30:49,132 --> 00:30:54,638
You know' I believe I'll hang on to it.
You'll have to come find me' after all.

312
00:30:55,514 --> 00:30:59,476
Fucked up that you killed your own brother.
- You...

313
00:31:04,314 --> 00:31:08,985
What's that shit?
Epi... 10 milligrams?

314
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:10,946
Good work, Kaylo.

315
00:31:32,342 --> 00:31:35,345
<i>Doctor Sing to the labor room.</i>

316
00:31:35,512 --> 00:31:38,557
<i>Doctor Sing to the labor room.</i>

317
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:45,897
Asshole!
- No need to push.

318
00:31:46,189 --> 00:31:50,360
I'm looking for
something that starts with "E".

319
00:31:50,527 --> 00:31:51,653
England?

320
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:55,866
Very funny. No.
Some kind of artificial adrenaline.

321
00:31:58,201 --> 00:32:02,372
Artificial adrenaline?
- Yeah, I've got heart problems.

322
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:06,418
Epinephrine.
- Yes! Epinephrine.

323
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:08,920
I love you. Epinephrine.

324
00:32:09,546 --> 00:32:12,716
I can't give you epinephrine.
- Why?

325
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:15,218
Just a minute.

326
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:18,096
Oi! What do you mean...

327
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:20,265
What is this shit?
- Nasal spray.

328
00:32:20,432 --> 00:32:22,350
Miserable bitch!
What?

329
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,939
Nasal spray. It's got epinephrine in it.
It'll get you tweaked, man.

330
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:42,287
Hey!

331
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,963
Sure that's the guy?
- Yeah.

332
00:33:56,278 --> 00:33:59,197
This room's clear.

333
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,642
<i>Could anyone
speaking Korean please come to ER?</i>

334
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:29,728
<i>Anyone speaking Korean...</i>

335
00:34:35,817 --> 00:34:38,028
Yo, yo, yo!

336
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:39,905
Yo!

337
00:34:40,072 --> 00:34:41,365
Stop!

338
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:45,535
Stop!

339
00:34:46,411 --> 00:34:47,537
Jerk-off!

340
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:58,507
Coming through!

341
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:04,554
I know you motherfuckers have epinephrine.

342
00:35:07,224 --> 00:35:10,394
Clear the hallway!
- Corner. Is the OR ready?

343
00:35:12,354 --> 00:35:16,441
I'm having a bad day.
Tell me you've got epinephrine on this cart!

344
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:18,443
You all right?

345
00:35:18,694 --> 00:35:20,529
Tell me you've got epinephrine!

346
00:35:20,696 --> 00:35:23,198
Motherfucker!
- I don't know. I'll check.

347
00:35:23,907 --> 00:35:25,617
Get back!
- Take it easy!

348
00:35:25,784 --> 00:35:30,789
Do you understand fucking English?
- Yes' I just don't know which draw it's in.

349
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:32,040
Look!

350
00:35:32,249 --> 00:35:36,545
Give me the fucking epinephrine!
- I don't know where it is' man!

351
00:35:36,712 --> 00:35:39,923
What is this, a rest home?
- What are you doing back there?

352
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,466
Hurry up!

353
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:44,386
Get back!
- We can't treat without insurance.

354
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:49,141
I don't know if I have it. Give me a second!
- Put the weapon down!

355
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:51,810
What the fuck!
Where the fuck is it?

356
00:35:52,936 --> 00:35:55,480
My heart!
- What?

357
00:35:55,647 --> 00:35:57,816
My heart!
- Yeah, yeah.

358
00:35:57,983 --> 00:36:00,736
Drop your weapon' now!

359
00:36:03,155 --> 00:36:06,575
What do you think you're doing? This is...
- Shut up! You!

360
00:36:06,742 --> 00:36:09,828
Gimme the epinephrine?

361
00:36:11,955 --> 00:36:14,624
Don't even think about it!

362
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:19,796
Albuterol... Flortab... Epinephrine!
Here it is! I've got it!

363
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:23,300
Here you go.
- Gimme that.

364
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,303
Asshole.
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

365
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,972
...all right? Just be quiet.

366
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:32,184
Juice me.

367
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:35,145
Juice?

368
00:36:35,312 --> 00:36:36,980
Do it.

369
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:38,357
All right.
- Come on!

370
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:41,693
I haven't got all day.

371
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:46,448
Okay, I need both of them to...
Give them to me.

372
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:50,869
One.

373
00:36:51,495 --> 00:36:53,705
Two. Clear!

374
00:36:57,209 --> 00:36:58,627
Get the fuck back!

375
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:02,381
Get out!

376
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,559
How much of this stuff did he say to take?

377
00:38:48,737 --> 00:38:50,822
<i>Chevy, we're in the air, man.</i>

378
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:52,991
<i>Did you get the stuff?
- Got it.</i>

379
00:38:53,158 --> 00:38:54,618
Did you take it?
- Yup.

380
00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:56,745
<i>You took the whole thing.
- Yup.</i>

381
00:38:56,912 --> 00:39:00,123
I said one 5th. The shit's gonna kill you.
- Right.

382
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,750
<i>Chest on fire?
- Check.</i>

383
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:03,293
<i>But you're cold.
- Check.</i>

384
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,631
And you've got a steel hard on, don't you?
- Let me check.

385
00:39:08,256 --> 00:39:10,801
Check.
- Your blood vessels are stimulated.

386
00:39:10,967 --> 00:39:14,930
Urinary sphincter's so tight'
you couldn't piss to save your life.

387
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:16,598
Urinary sphincter' check!

388
00:39:17,808 --> 00:39:20,811
<i>Get some Vicodin. You at the hospital?
- Negative.</i>

389
00:39:20,977 --> 00:39:25,982
<i>Get some grass. That shit'll be out of
your system in 30 minutes, or it'll kill you.</i>

390
00:39:26,316 --> 00:39:30,529
This is costing me a fortune.
I'll call you in 20 minutes when we land.

391
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:32,155
<i>Copy.
- Hey, Chevy?</i>

392
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:36,326
You're a good dude.
Been nice knowing you.

393
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:37,786
Copy, out.

394
00:39:39,204 --> 00:39:41,039
Some medical emergency.

395
00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:46,628
<i>Police have declined to name
the man they say is still at large,</i>

396
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:49,464
<i>on a citywide rampage
that has left one man dead,</i>

397
00:39:49,673 --> 00:39:53,969
<i>dozens injured, and hundreds
of thousands of dollars of damage...</i>

398
00:39:54,136 --> 00:39:58,682
<i>in it's smoking, bloody wake.
The suspect is a professional killer...</i>

399
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:01,852
<i>with ties to organized crime
and a long police record.</i>

400
00:40:02,227 --> 00:40:05,147
<i>He is considered armed and highly dangerous.</i>

401
00:40:05,313 --> 00:40:09,026
<i>We now continue with regularly
scheduled programming,</i>

402
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:14,197
<i>but stay tuned for continuing coverage
of this bizarre story, as it unfolds.</i>

403
00:40:14,656 --> 00:40:19,244
<i>What your saying is that next to olives,
onions, lemons and limes...</i>

404
00:40:34,509 --> 00:40:37,429
Oh' shit!
Take it easy.

405
00:40:37,554 --> 00:40:39,056
Get back, pig!

406
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:41,683
I... just give me the...

407
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,269
Come on, then.
Let's see you run, piggy.

408
00:40:44,436 --> 00:40:45,729
Come on' piggy.

409
00:40:46,355 --> 00:40:48,899
Give me the gun.
Let's talk this over.

410
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:53,278
Yeah' you want it?
There.

411
00:42:25,162 --> 00:42:28,540
Honey, let's go. Come on.
- Be careful.

412
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:34,504
All right.
I'm gonna get some help' all right?

413
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:37,007
<i>Yeah.</i>

414
00:42:37,174 --> 00:42:41,011
<i>Hey, did you try to call?
- You've been home all day?</i>

415
00:42:42,721 --> 00:42:47,351
I was sleeping in.
- Sleeping in. That's great' Eve.

416
00:42:47,517 --> 00:42:49,186
Super great.

417
00:42:49,353 --> 00:42:52,356
<i>You all rested, now?
Glad to hear it.</i>

418
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:56,485
Listen' I've been fatally poisoned.

419
00:42:56,651 --> 00:42:59,821
A psychopath's on his way over
to torture and kill you,

420
00:42:59,988 --> 00:43:04,868
but don't get out of bed' I'll be
over in a flash. Could you fry up a waffle?

421
00:43:05,035 --> 00:43:10,540
Sure, yeah. Come on over. I'll be here.
- Right, you'll be there. Okay.

422
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,209
Bye.

423
00:44:08,265 --> 00:44:09,975
So, let's go get the bitch!

424
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:26,324
I hate you.

425
00:44:31,955 --> 00:44:33,999
Second.

426
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:37,127
Come on!

427
00:44:37,294 --> 00:44:41,089
Come on, please!

428
00:44:42,466 --> 00:44:46,344
All right' all right. Jesus!

429
00:44:47,804 --> 00:44:49,765
Oh my God!

430
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:56,688
Is this your new look or something?
- Yeah, you into it?

431
00:44:57,105 --> 00:44:58,357
It's gross.

432
00:45:01,777 --> 00:45:05,030
Are you looking for my other boyfriend?

433
00:45:05,697 --> 00:45:06,948
Yes!

434
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:12,496
You haven't watched TV today' right?
- No' why?

435
00:45:12,662 --> 00:45:16,208
Didn't think so. Come on, we're leaving.
- Don't be a freak.

436
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:17,876
Get dressed.

437
00:45:18,043 --> 00:45:22,506
Actually, can you change the clock on the
microwave? I never changed it back.

438
00:45:22,672 --> 00:45:24,966
What?
- The microwave.

439
00:45:25,175 --> 00:45:29,679
Change the clock. The daylight
savings time, I never changed it back.

440
00:45:29,846 --> 00:45:32,683
The microwave?
- Yes.

441
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:37,020
Listen' I bought you some flowers.
They got fucked up on the way over.

442
00:45:37,187 --> 00:45:41,900
That's sweet! You okay?
You look like you're on drugs or something.

443
00:45:43,026 --> 00:45:45,028
You love me' yeah?

444
00:45:46,363 --> 00:45:48,657
Yes.

445
00:45:48,824 --> 00:45:52,703
Then I need you to do something for me.
- What? What's wrong?

446
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:58,208
I need you to put some clothes on
and come with me, right now.

447
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:01,378
No.
- I'll change the clock on the microwave.

448
00:46:01,545 --> 00:46:03,714
Okay. All right.

449
00:46:22,524 --> 00:46:24,401
Shit's wearing off.

450
00:46:25,235 --> 00:46:30,032
The waffle iron's on if you want to make one.
- Great.

451
00:46:31,575 --> 00:46:33,410
Great.

452
00:46:55,807 --> 00:46:58,477
You're so stressed out.
Want some pot?

453
00:46:59,436 --> 00:47:01,271
Yeah! No!

454
00:47:03,774 --> 00:47:06,276
Ready! What's wrong?
- I burned my hand.

455
00:47:06,443 --> 00:47:11,073
Oh, my God! Let me see it!
- Don't worry about it. Hey!

456
00:47:11,656 --> 00:47:13,658
What the...

457
00:47:14,117 --> 00:47:17,746
I'm sorry.
- That was completely uncalled for.

458
00:47:19,998 --> 00:47:20,999
Can we just...

459
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:22,042
Fine.

460
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,682
Parked out the back.
- Oh.

461
00:47:37,516 --> 00:47:40,560
Darn! That... thing.
- What thing?

462
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:43,563
The waffle thing.
I gotta turn it off.

463
00:47:58,704 --> 00:47:59,913
Hello?

464
00:48:00,914 --> 00:48:02,541
Hello?

465
00:48:08,422 --> 00:48:10,382
<i>All right, very funny.</i>

466
00:48:13,218 --> 00:48:14,720
God' I hate that.

467
00:48:17,723 --> 00:48:20,600
Do you want to burn the building down?

468
00:48:29,401 --> 00:48:31,528
Ouch!
- Sorry, honey.

469
00:48:31,945 --> 00:48:34,364
Nice one. Chev?

470
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:37,117
Oh, there's my Tiger Balm.

471
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:39,745
I swear to God' Chev.

472
00:48:40,871 --> 00:48:44,207
I don't know what you're on,
but it isn't working for you.

473
00:48:48,378 --> 00:48:51,214
My hand cream!
That's where you went.

474
00:49:00,223 --> 00:49:03,101
Chev? Can I have some help, here?

475
00:49:07,814 --> 00:49:11,985
Where's your car?
- Actually, I took a cab.

476
00:49:41,807 --> 00:49:43,767
You're embarrassing me.

477
00:49:44,184 --> 00:49:47,270
I didn't have
a lot of time to pick this out.

478
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:53,985
So' why are we here?

479
00:50:11,503 --> 00:50:15,799
This isn't gonna be...
This isn't gonna be easy' as they say.

480
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:20,178
Oh, fucker.

481
00:50:20,345 --> 00:50:23,849
All right' here it is.
- Sorry.

482
00:50:28,645 --> 00:50:31,982
I told you I was a video game programmer.
- Yeah?

483
00:50:32,149 --> 00:50:34,401
That was a lie.

484
00:50:34,526 --> 00:50:36,403
Actually...

485
00:50:39,197 --> 00:50:41,074
I kill people.

486
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:46,371
Professional hitman. I freelance
for a major West Coast crime syndicate.

487
00:50:46,872 --> 00:50:50,751
Last night was a job like 100 others.
High dollar hit' nothing special.

488
00:50:52,085 --> 00:50:56,256
<i>The Triads, from Hong Kong,
had been moving in on the local drug cartels.</i>

489
00:50:57,007 --> 00:51:01,261
<i>My target was
the number 1 man in Los Angeles, Don Kim.</i>

490
00:51:10,103 --> 00:51:11,938
Well?

491
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:14,775
What are you waiting for?

492
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:22,532
<i>Then, this insane idea comes through the back
of my head, like a.45 slug at close range.</i>

493
00:51:24,451 --> 00:51:26,953
Congratulations.

494
00:51:27,621 --> 00:51:31,583
Did I win something?
- Your life, jackass.

495
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:37,297
100 grand wants you dead.
So' sooner or later it's gonna happen'

496
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:39,966
but I'm not doing it.

497
00:51:40,592 --> 00:51:42,469
I see.

498
00:51:43,095 --> 00:51:48,100
Instead you're gonna do something for me.
You're gonna get out of town. Disappear.

499
00:51:48,266 --> 00:51:51,561
I don't care where you go or what you do'

500
00:51:51,728 --> 00:51:56,650
so long as you're invisible for 48 hours.
That's all I ask.

501
00:51:57,109 --> 00:51:59,319
48 hours?

502
00:52:00,737 --> 00:52:03,281
Or, if you prefer,
we can do it the other way.

503
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:08,787
The way where I go to work'
and you meet Buddha.

504
00:52:23,593 --> 00:52:26,513
You see?
I quit.

505
00:52:26,638 --> 00:52:29,850
I quit the business' for you.

506
00:52:31,768 --> 00:52:34,312
For me?
- Yeah.

507
00:52:34,479 --> 00:52:37,858
I figure I call you that night
and tell you everything.

508
00:52:38,025 --> 00:52:41,194
We get on a plane'
leave this shit' never come back.

509
00:52:42,112 --> 00:52:45,782
Pretty crazy, huh?
- You are so weird.

510
00:52:47,868 --> 00:52:51,204
Are we going on a trip?
- Well...

511
00:52:52,664 --> 00:52:57,127
I might be going on a trip,
but you're not coming with me...

512
00:52:57,544 --> 00:53:00,881
Please! Wait' please!
- Mob hits, Chev?

513
00:53:01,006 --> 00:53:04,885
Chinese poison?
Do you know how ridiculous you sound?

514
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,637
If you're leaving me'
then tell me the truth!

515
00:53:07,971 --> 00:53:10,223
Oh' right.
You think it sounds crazy.

516
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:14,019
How do you think I feel?
I have to live this shit!

517
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,023
Chev? Chev?

518
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:21,860
What's wrong?

519
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:27,199
Wait a minute' you trust me?
- No.

520
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:30,369
Make love to me.
- What?

521
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:34,873
I think it'll help.
- What? Are you kidding? Get off me!

522
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,169
Take your clothes off.
- No!

523
00:53:39,544 --> 00:53:40,545
No!

524
00:53:41,046 --> 00:53:44,508
You said you wanted to be more spontaneous.
- You're crazy!

525
00:53:44,674 --> 00:53:47,511
You're an adrenaline junkie with no soul!

526
00:53:48,011 --> 00:53:51,098
Save me, Eve. Save my life!
- Stop it!

527
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:59,022
I'm sorry.
Oh my God' are you okay?

528
00:53:59,189 --> 00:54:00,899
Are you okay?

529
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:08,031
No! No!

530
00:54:09,408 --> 00:54:10,450
Shit!

531
00:54:13,203 --> 00:54:15,706
Get off!

532
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:27,884
You filthy animal!

533
00:54:28,593 --> 00:54:32,264
Take me right here' in front of everyone!

534
00:54:32,472 --> 00:54:35,600
That's it!

535
00:54:35,767 --> 00:54:37,769
Come on! Do it!

536
00:54:37,936 --> 00:54:39,896
What are you waiting for?
- Jesus!

537
00:54:40,063 --> 00:54:41,815
Come on!
- I'm trying!

538
00:54:43,734 --> 00:54:47,237
Oh' God!
Now you can't get it up?

539
00:54:47,946 --> 00:54:51,158
Come on' get it up!
- I'll fucking get it up!

540
00:54:59,624 --> 00:55:01,752
Goddamnit, Chev!
- Shut up!

541
00:55:15,432 --> 00:55:17,434
I'm alive! I'm alive!

542
00:55:17,642 --> 00:55:20,145
I'm alive, you motherfuckers!

543
00:55:21,313 --> 00:55:24,316
Oh' my God! Wow!

544
00:55:28,028 --> 00:55:32,032
Oh, my God! Yes!

545
00:55:34,326 --> 00:55:37,162
Yeah?
- What are you doing?

546
00:55:37,662 --> 00:55:40,123
<i>I've got Verona.
- Kaylo?</i>

547
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:43,043
<i>I've got Verona, man.</i>

548
00:55:44,961 --> 00:55:47,381
What?
- No shit?

549
00:55:47,714 --> 00:55:51,218
<i>Where are you?
- Don Kim's shirt factory, upstairs.</i>

550
00:55:51,385 --> 00:55:55,305
What's the matter with you?
- 5th and Alameda?

551
00:55:56,056 --> 00:56:01,019
Who's at 5th and Alameda?
- Don't let that fucker out of your sight!

552
00:56:01,186 --> 00:56:05,649
Hear me? With you in 10 minutes. You got it?
- Yeah' Chev.

553
00:56:06,692 --> 00:56:09,695
Honey, I gotta go.
Please understand.

554
00:56:10,028 --> 00:56:13,031
No, Chev, I do not understand!

555
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:15,534
Oh, baby!

556
00:56:16,535 --> 00:56:17,994
I'll call you!

557
00:56:21,164 --> 00:56:22,749
What are you looking at?

558
00:56:35,345 --> 00:56:38,724
Hey man' what's the matter with you?
You a crackhead?

559
00:56:39,224 --> 00:56:44,938
Right' just step on it' all right?
- You're won't die in my cab, crackhead.

560
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,940
I got something for you.

561
00:56:51,862 --> 00:56:53,447
Take this Haitian shit.

562
00:56:53,739 --> 00:56:58,368
This shit is some hardcore shit.
It's made from plant shit.

563
00:57:01,788 --> 00:57:06,209
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Look at this. You see that?

564
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,755
That's what a man look like, crackhead.
That's power.

565
00:57:11,089 --> 00:57:13,633
Now look at you.

566
00:57:16,762 --> 00:57:19,765
What the hell.

567
00:57:29,066 --> 00:57:31,109
Yeah.

568
00:57:31,943 --> 00:57:36,156
It tastes like ass.

569
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,243
That's right' devil. You wait.

570
00:58:14,945 --> 00:58:16,947
Shut the fuck up!
- No!

571
00:58:17,155 --> 00:58:19,449
No!
- Shut the fuck up!

572
00:58:27,874 --> 00:58:31,128
Whoop, there it is!
Fuck him!

573
00:58:37,843 --> 00:58:39,052
We're here.

574
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:50,022
What'd you say was in this stuff?
- I told you' it's hardcore.

575
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:59,406
It'll be $5.55.

576
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:06,413
It's all you, man.
- Have a nice day, devil.

577
00:59:12,252 --> 00:59:13,754
This is fucked.

578
00:59:16,214 --> 00:59:17,424
Where's he going?

579
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:27,434
Yeah' okay. How the fuck you
going to call me' talking shit?

580
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:31,563
I'm gonna smack the hell out of you.
I don't know where he at...

581
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:34,274
Fucking call me talking shit!

582
00:59:37,194 --> 00:59:39,946
I'm doing my job.
I'm doing my shit.

583
00:59:42,074 --> 00:59:45,118
I'm out here,
doing what I do. I'm a rooftop mother...

584
00:59:45,911 --> 00:59:47,913
Hey, Chevy!
What's up' dog?

585
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,415
Everything okay?
You chillin'? You good?

586
00:59:50,582 --> 00:59:53,251
What a coincidence!
- What do you mean?

587
00:59:53,418 --> 00:59:57,422
What, you waiting for a bus?
- Actually' I thought a helicopter...

588
00:59:57,589 --> 00:59:59,091
What is this?
- What?

589
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:01,635
You working for the Chinese?
- The Chinese?

590
01:00:01,802 --> 01:00:05,931
You crazy? I wouldn't do that to you.
- I am crazy. Where's Kaylo?

591
01:00:07,474 --> 01:00:10,477
Okay' ding. Time's up.
- What do you mean' "ding"?

592
01:00:10,602 --> 01:00:13,146
What do you mean, "ding"?

593
01:00:18,944 --> 01:00:20,946
Where is that motherfucker?

594
01:00:21,113 --> 01:00:22,781
Chev.

595
01:00:24,783 --> 01:00:28,662
What the fuck is this?
- Chev, baby. Take it easy.

596
01:00:29,955 --> 01:00:31,790
Oh' you mean like this?

597
01:00:33,959 --> 01:00:38,672
Now you tell me where that
little toe-rag motherfucker is. Verona.

598
01:00:39,089 --> 01:00:41,508
Verona's got nothing to do with this.

599
01:00:42,926 --> 01:00:44,177
What?

600
01:00:44,928 --> 01:00:49,016
Don Carlos wants you off the streets.
- Carlito?

601
01:00:49,307 --> 01:00:52,310
You've totally lost your shit, dog.

602
01:00:52,477 --> 01:00:56,606
You're all over TV. Destroying property,
making unauthorized hits...

603
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:01,945
You're causing the organization
a great deal of embarrassment.

604
01:01:02,112 --> 01:01:04,948
You're telling me Carlito wanted this?
- Look'

605
01:01:05,198 --> 01:01:07,868
don't worry'
we'll take care of Verona.

606
01:01:07,993 --> 01:01:13,206
The best thing for you to do
is find some nice' dark' quiet place and...

607
01:01:13,832 --> 01:01:15,042
just die.

608
01:01:22,174 --> 01:01:26,553
Just die. You think
I've got "cunt" written on my forehead?

609
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,813
Maybe you're right.

610
01:01:38,023 --> 01:01:41,818
We all got to die sometime, right?
- Yeah.

611
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:45,238
We all got to die sometime.

612
01:01:45,489 --> 01:01:48,325
So' I'll just die.

613
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:54,414
What the...

614
01:02:21,108 --> 01:02:23,944
Of all the fuckin'...
- You got shot!

615
01:02:24,194 --> 01:02:25,445
Mother...

616
01:02:26,405 --> 01:02:28,949
Jesus!
Eve, move!

617
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:47,801
You' asshole!
- Don't talk to him like that!

618
01:02:47,926 --> 01:02:51,054
My boyfriend kills people!
- Nice.

619
01:04:19,685 --> 01:04:21,728
Oh' God!

620
01:04:23,021 --> 01:04:26,733
I had to see if you were telling the truth.

621
01:04:29,528 --> 01:04:31,238
Come on.

622
01:04:31,988 --> 01:04:33,740
No, wait!

623
01:04:39,705 --> 01:04:40,914
Now, come on.

624
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,669
Oh' God!

625
01:04:48,255 --> 01:04:49,506
Oh, dammit!

626
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:53,176
I forgot to take my birth control pills.
- What?

627
01:04:53,885 --> 01:04:57,347
Where are the keys? The keys!
- Here.

628
01:05:02,185 --> 01:05:03,854
Come! Come!
- My stuff!

629
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:07,524
All my stuff!

630
01:05:37,054 --> 01:05:39,473
You weren't lying!
- Welcome to my life.

631
01:05:41,433 --> 01:05:45,228
No, I mean...
that you would give it all up for me.

632
01:05:46,063 --> 01:05:47,397
Yeah.

633
01:05:49,107 --> 01:05:52,069
And the other part?
- The poison's true' too.

634
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,281
Then... that means...

635
01:05:56,656 --> 01:05:58,241
Pretty much, Eve.

636
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,791
How can we stop it?
- Only adrenaline can slow it down.

637
01:06:09,086 --> 01:06:12,756
So, when we were in Chinatown?
- Yeah. Sorry.

638
01:06:17,135 --> 01:06:18,470
What are you doing?

639
01:06:18,637 --> 01:06:21,014
This'll get you going.
- What?

640
01:06:21,181 --> 01:06:25,143
Come on, let's finish what you started.
- Oh, boy.

641
01:06:27,312 --> 01:06:30,315
Oh, that's it.
That's really working for me.

642
01:06:32,943 --> 01:06:36,321
You like that?
- Stay down!

643
01:06:40,992 --> 01:06:42,160
Motherfuck!

644
01:06:45,664 --> 01:06:49,167
Jesus! Yeah, that's it' baby.
Just a little more.

645
01:06:53,505 --> 01:06:56,216
Stay down, Eve.

646
01:07:04,558 --> 01:07:07,561
Jesus.
- Oh, you're so big!

647
01:07:08,645 --> 01:07:10,397
Oh my God!

648
01:07:14,735 --> 01:07:16,653
Just a touch...

649
01:07:18,363 --> 01:07:21,992
What's that matter?
- So you can fall asleep like always?

650
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,328
I don't think so.

651
01:07:25,662 --> 01:07:27,080
Jesus! Fuck!

652
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:11,541
Are they really...

653
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:14,252
They're dead.

654
01:08:14,753 --> 01:08:17,756
How do you...
How can you do that?

655
01:08:19,758 --> 01:08:22,761
I told you, baby. I quit.

656
01:08:28,767 --> 01:08:31,561
Where are you going?
- Stay there, honey.

657
01:08:33,939 --> 01:08:36,441
Jesus! Fuck!
- Chev!

658
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:40,237
Asshole!

659
01:09:11,476 --> 01:09:13,311
I can't feel my leg.

660
01:09:23,113 --> 01:09:26,324
Shit!
I've been trying to call you for a half hour.

661
01:09:26,491 --> 01:09:28,994
<i>Where the fuck have you been?
- In my office.</i>

662
01:09:29,161 --> 01:09:32,122
<i>Can you make it over here?
- Sure' why not?</i>

663
01:09:36,835 --> 01:09:41,673
Chocolate' what's this fucking receipt
from Gold Foods Market for $254?

664
01:09:43,342 --> 01:09:44,801
Snacks.

665
01:09:59,191 --> 01:10:01,193
I hate television.

666
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,195
I owe you again, Doc.

667
01:10:03,362 --> 01:10:07,240
Chevy' you're my best customer.

668
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:11,745
What is this stuff?
- Synthetic epinephrine...

669
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:16,083
diluted with some saline.
- Feels sort of good.

670
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:21,588
Well, I got a little meth in there' too.
You're feeling the endorphins.

671
01:10:25,509 --> 01:10:27,427
Wait a minute.
I'm not better?

672
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,263
No' you're not better.

673
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:36,061
You're in such shit shape' it's stunning.
I can't believe your heart's beating.

674
01:10:36,228 --> 01:10:39,439
You should be in a fucking medical journal.

675
01:10:45,237 --> 01:10:50,283
So, what are you going to do?
- The solution acts as a competing inhibitor.

676
01:10:50,534 --> 01:10:53,286
It's pushing
the poison out of your receptors'

677
01:10:53,412 --> 01:10:56,915
and replacing it with a chemical.
It's just a temporary fix.

678
01:10:57,082 --> 01:10:58,250
Then what?

679
01:10:58,417 --> 01:11:01,253
Then you're fucked.

680
01:11:03,255 --> 01:11:07,759
I can put you on life support
and string this out for a few days.

681
01:11:07,926 --> 01:11:11,596
But you're going to
go into a comma at some point.

682
01:11:11,763 --> 01:11:13,640
Does she know?

683
01:11:17,436 --> 01:11:22,607
Why don't I load you up with something,
and you can go out in a beautiful dream.

684
01:11:24,735 --> 01:11:26,611
A dream.

685
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,658
Can I do that for you?

686
01:11:33,243 --> 01:11:37,622
No, no, no.
That's not what I want.

687
01:11:38,457 --> 01:11:40,000
What do you want?

688
01:11:41,126 --> 01:11:42,961
One hour.

689
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:48,342
I want one hour.

690
01:11:57,351 --> 01:11:59,019
Give me a fuckin' break.

691
01:12:02,481 --> 01:12:09,529
<i>So, the wild rampage that began 9am in
L.A. Continues. The suspect, still at large.</i>

692
01:12:11,156 --> 01:12:13,867
We didn't give him
enough of the Chinese shit.

693
01:12:14,826 --> 01:12:17,204
You think?

694
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:23,710
Dude, it's him!

695
01:12:26,546 --> 01:12:29,633
<i>What's up' corpse?
- Bonjour, douche bag,</i>

696
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,638
<i>Thought you might be interested in a deal.
- Oh, you a dealer, now?</i>

697
01:12:34,805 --> 01:12:36,890
Don't you worry about what I am.

698
01:12:37,224 --> 01:12:42,312
<i>Listen, I want the antidote.
- Oh, the antidote?</i>

699
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:46,316
<i>That's right, the antidote.
- What you prepared to give me?</i>

700
01:12:46,483 --> 01:12:51,822
How about the jewelry I got off that
faggot brother of yours' you cocksucker?

701
01:12:52,406 --> 01:12:55,992
<i>Don't pop a blood vessel, you little penis.
- Okay.</i>

702
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,078
<i>You like the deal?
- Whatever!</i>

703
01:12:58,203 --> 01:13:00,831
Be at the downtown Lint in 20 minutes.

704
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:02,749
<i>You know the spot?
- Yeah.</i>

705
01:13:02,874 --> 01:13:06,753
<i>Don't be late, or I'll trade the
thing to a whore for a hand job.</i>

706
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:10,340
Look' I said I said I'd fuckin' be...
Fuck!

707
01:13:11,049 --> 01:13:13,552
See you later, sunshine.
...turn that shit off.

708
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:15,721
Dammit! Fuck!

709
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,689
Yo' it's Verona.
You won't believe this call I just got.

710
01:13:40,912 --> 01:13:43,081
<i>It's gonna be all right, baby.</i>

711
01:13:43,248 --> 01:13:46,293
<i>But you said...
- No, no.</i>

712
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:48,128
<i>Things have changed.</i>

713
01:13:48,295 --> 01:13:52,924
<i>There's an antidote. I can
make a deal for it, but I got to go alone.</i>

714
01:13:53,884 --> 01:13:56,928
<i>I'm scared.
- Of course.</i>

715
01:13:57,596 --> 01:14:00,307
<i>You'll be safe, now.
And I'll be back.</i>

716
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:03,435
Promise?

717
01:14:04,227 --> 01:14:05,771
I promise.

718
01:15:14,381 --> 01:15:18,135
What's happening' bro?

719
01:15:37,904 --> 01:15:42,576
<i>Where did I go wrong?
- You fuckin' just say something?</i>

720
01:15:42,743 --> 01:15:44,995
<i>It's like talking to the wall.</i>

721
01:15:47,539 --> 01:15:51,334
<i>Mom?
- I'm amazed you remember you have a mother.</i>

722
01:15:51,501 --> 01:15:53,503
<i>You never call, you never write.</i>

723
01:15:54,212 --> 01:15:57,007
<i>I haven't seen you
since you ran out at 16.</i>

724
01:15:57,174 --> 01:16:01,261
Yeah, yeah. Right' Mom.
With you popping Valium like tic tacs'

725
01:16:01,428 --> 01:16:06,767
boning a new asshole every 2 weeks, why
wouldn't I stick around with fun like that?

726
01:16:08,894 --> 01:16:13,607
<i>Please' I haven't got time for this.
- You got no time, period.</i>

727
01:16:13,899 --> 01:16:17,402
<i>Orlando?
- You're a persistent motherfucker, Chelios.</i>

728
01:16:17,569 --> 01:16:20,197
<i>I give you that.
- This is weird.</i>

729
01:16:20,364 --> 01:16:24,409
<i>I know this is weird,
but this has got to stop sometimes...</i>

730
01:16:27,412 --> 01:16:29,539
<i>They pop you and you keep getting up?</i>

731
01:16:30,207 --> 01:16:34,753
<i>I'm the terminator.
- You was, but here's a new gun in town.</i>

732
01:16:35,754 --> 01:16:37,756
You know, I just don't get it.

733
01:16:37,923 --> 01:16:40,926
Why didn't you just cut me up
when you had the chance?

734
01:16:41,093 --> 01:16:43,428
<i>Too easy, motherfucker.
Look at you.</i>

735
01:16:43,637 --> 01:16:49,976
<i>Bi-polar, sadomasochistic tendencies...
- Adrenaline junkie, addicted to violence...</i>

736
01:16:50,769 --> 01:16:54,272
<i>Probably spends every day
of his life looking for the big rush.</i>

737
01:16:54,439 --> 01:17:00,320
<i>Carving up a guy, while he screams in
his own blood and excrement, would be like...</i>

738
01:17:00,445 --> 01:17:03,573
<i>like a gift.
A warriors death.</i>

739
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:07,411
<i>Hell, you'd probably get off on it.</i>

740
01:17:08,578 --> 01:17:11,123
What' did you rehearse this?
- No' no.

741
01:17:11,957 --> 01:17:17,129
<i>This was the best way for a guy like you.
Slow ticking clock, winding down.</i>

742
01:17:17,629 --> 01:17:21,174
<i>Inevitable, non-negotiable, until...
- Who the hell are you?</i>

743
01:17:25,262 --> 01:17:28,849
<i>I think I'm starting to figure it out.
- Better late than never.</i>

744
01:17:29,516 --> 01:17:31,601
<i>You know you're gonna die up there.</i>

745
01:17:31,768 --> 01:17:36,106
Yeah, maybe.
But I'm taking you with me.

746
01:17:49,036 --> 01:17:50,662
Some pills' Doc.

747
01:18:06,845 --> 01:18:10,140
Chelios?
- Hello, girls.

748
01:18:17,898 --> 01:18:18,982
Hold up.

749
01:18:20,817 --> 01:18:23,695
Give me the piece.

750
01:18:42,839 --> 01:18:46,259
Now, isn't that a fucking picture?
- Chelios.

751
01:18:47,344 --> 01:18:49,346
What a fucking nightmare you are.

752
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:51,014
No shit.

753
01:18:51,556 --> 01:18:52,724
Sit down.

754
01:18:54,059 --> 01:18:56,853
Whoa! Wait a minute.
You pat him down, again.

755
01:18:57,437 --> 01:18:59,439
I know he's carrying something.

756
01:19:03,402 --> 01:19:04,695
Let me see it.

757
01:19:08,198 --> 01:19:09,783
Motherfucker.

758
01:19:10,075 --> 01:19:12,869
Clever.
What is this, an insulin pump?

759
01:19:13,203 --> 01:19:14,246
Basically.

760
01:19:14,621 --> 01:19:16,289
What the fuck is insulin?

761
01:19:17,457 --> 01:19:18,625
Ephedrine' right?

762
01:19:19,251 --> 01:19:22,629
Yeah.
- You're very resourceful.

763
01:19:25,716 --> 01:19:29,052
Found a new master' little bitch?
- I'm nobody's bitch.

764
01:19:29,928 --> 01:19:34,099
You'll be a bitch when Carlito
hires you for half what he paid me.

765
01:19:34,266 --> 01:19:35,642
That's enough.

766
01:19:35,767 --> 01:19:39,646
You'll throw boss a reach-around,
show him you're a good bitch.

767
01:19:39,813 --> 01:19:42,232
I'm nobody's little bitch!

768
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:44,234
You fuckin' hear me?

769
01:19:44,401 --> 01:19:47,112
He'll pay what I tell him to pay!
- Enough!

770
01:19:47,487 --> 01:19:48,822
Sit down!

771
01:19:53,618 --> 01:19:56,496
It's been a long fucking day.

772
01:19:56,663 --> 01:20:00,500
In the end' you have to admit'
it all works out quite nicely.

773
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:04,004
Don Kim gets his bullet,
thanks to you,

774
01:20:04,171 --> 01:20:07,632
and Hong Kong gets a goat to take the fall.

775
01:20:08,759 --> 01:20:13,263
Please understand' it's nothing personal.
- Speak for yourself.

776
01:20:16,641 --> 01:20:18,143
That what I think it is?

777
01:20:20,437 --> 01:20:22,773
It's the Chinese shit.

778
01:20:23,148 --> 01:20:25,817
Hold him down.

779
01:20:27,986 --> 01:20:30,489
Not so fast, motherfucker!

780
01:20:31,656 --> 01:20:33,992
He's gone dipsy-do, yo!

781
01:20:36,495 --> 01:20:38,163
Whatever, psycho.

782
01:20:40,874 --> 01:20:44,628
I'm afraid the Houdini act is over'
my friend.

783
01:20:52,552 --> 01:20:54,680
Our Father' who art in...
- Shut up!

784
01:20:54,846 --> 01:20:57,891
So, this is how it is.

785
01:20:59,685 --> 01:21:03,730
It's Don Kim! He's supposed to be dead!
- Presto.

786
01:21:26,712 --> 01:21:29,923
<i>Police have moved
to surround the Hotel Lint,</i>

787
01:21:30,048 --> 01:21:32,718
<i>where the madman
behind today's mayhem...</i>

788
01:21:32,884 --> 01:21:36,263
<i>is holed up
and making a desperate last stand.</i>

789
01:21:36,763 --> 01:21:39,766
<i>Officials have confirmed
gunfire on the sundeck.</i>

790
01:21:39,933 --> 01:21:45,272
<i>Our news chopper will bring live,
uncensored coverage from above the hotel.</i>

791
01:21:46,064 --> 01:21:52,404
<i>Again, this coverage is uncensored, so any
small children present should leave the room.</i>

792
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,587
Get me out of here, now!

793
01:22:17,929 --> 01:22:19,765
I'll kill you' Chelios!

794
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:21,641
Too late!

795
01:22:28,398 --> 01:22:29,941
Look out!

796
01:22:30,984 --> 01:22:32,402
Thanks' boss.

797
01:23:53,025 --> 01:23:56,236
Let's get the fuck out of here, now!
Let's go!

798
01:24:02,534 --> 01:24:04,077
Present from Kaylo.

799
01:24:12,753 --> 01:24:14,713
Now what?
Now you say shit!

800
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,381
Where the fuck were you?

801
01:24:17,591 --> 01:24:19,092
Who's the bitch' now?

802
01:24:26,433 --> 01:24:28,602
No, no! You fly' motherfucker!

803
01:24:30,228 --> 01:24:31,897
Motherfuckin' fly!

804
01:25:21,655 --> 01:25:22,739
You're dead!

805
01:25:24,241 --> 01:25:25,992
Oh my God!

806
01:25:39,589 --> 01:25:41,508
You're dead' motherfucker!

807
01:26:11,329 --> 01:26:14,541
I told you I'd kill you' you little bitch!

808
01:26:37,356 --> 01:26:40,525
<i>Hey, its Eve.
I'm glad you called but I'm not here.</i>

809
01:26:40,692 --> 01:26:45,322
<i>Leave a message, unless you're
selling something 'cause I'm not interested.</i>

810
01:26:45,489 --> 01:26:49,409
<i>If you're not, then just...
Wait, time's up.</i>

811
01:26:50,035 --> 01:26:52,037
Hey' doll...

812
01:26:53,372 --> 01:26:57,000
Looks like I let you down' again.

813
01:26:57,668 --> 01:27:02,255
<i>Seems like all my life
I've just been going... going...</i>

814
01:27:03,048 --> 01:27:04,716
<i>going...</i>

815
01:27:05,175 --> 01:27:09,721
I wish I'd taken more time to
stop and smell the roses' so to speak.

816
01:27:11,848 --> 01:27:16,103
Well' I guess it's too late for that now.

817
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:24,569
You're the greatest' baby.
