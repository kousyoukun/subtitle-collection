能打扰一下大家吗?
Can I get everyone's attention?

3
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:08,324
威廉姆斯先生,请起立
Mr. Williams, please rise.

4
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:11,674
请举起你的右手
Please raise your right hand, sir.

5
00:00:12,202 --> 00:00:16,086
你能庄严的宣誓,你说陈述的证据都是真实的吗?
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you about to give is the truth.

6
00:00:16,287 --> 00:00:19,495
完全真实,没有半点假话么?

00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:22,117

00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,754
威廉姆斯先生,你能告我们在深海处
Mr. Williams, can you please give us your best

9
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,440
到底发生了什么吗?
recollection of the event on the Deepwater Horizon?

10
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:37,449
九点左右的时候,我正在和我的妻子通话
I was on the phone around 9:30 with my wife.

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,328
我听到了呲呲的响声
That's when I heard the hissing noise.

12
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:43,723
我听到了引擎故障的声音
I heard the engines start to rave.

13
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:47,155
呲呲的响声变成了轰鸣声
The hissing turn into a full blown roar.

14
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:49,364
声音大的我无法形容
Higher than I can even describe it.

15
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:52,388
几秒钟后,就发生了巨大的爆炸
And within second there's a huge explosion.

16
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:55,466
残片飞的到处都是
Projectiles coming from everywhere.

17
00:00:55,768 --> 00:00:57,365
热浪热的受不了
The heat was overwhelming.

18
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:04,310
你能解释下报警系统是什么设置的吗?
Can you please tell me how the Deepwater Horizon alarm system is set up.

19
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:08,729
警报系统是用来通知整个平台的
The general alarm is set up to inform the entire rig of

20
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,336

22
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:18,628
每一种的警报声和警示灯都不一样
Each condition has a distinct tone and a distinct visual light.

23
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,483
在4月20日的晚上
On the eve of April 20th

24
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:24,597
你是否听到了警报声?
Did you hear anyone of those alarm on Deepwater Horizon?

25
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:26,106
没有 先生
No sir.

26
00:01:27,382 --> 00:01:30,442
你知道为什么你没有听到警报吗?
Do you know why you never heard that alarm?

27
00:01:32,988 --> 00:01:33,988
威廉姆斯先生?
Mr. William?

28
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:36,005

00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,880
继续下潜

32
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:36,000
保持在管道北侧
Need to stick to the north side far east.

33
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,807
进行扫描
Scan on it.

34
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:50,675
还有大约500米的管道待检
About 500 foot rising up.

35
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,438
看到防喷器了
BOP is in the view.

孔深3.5千米
Drilling depth 5.6 kilometers.

39
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:11,623
现在井口怎么样?
How's that wellhead service working?

40
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,330
轻微腐蚀,跟我想象的差不多
Minor corrosion not much more than I expected of. Well ahead of it's age.

41
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:18,934
搞定,让回来吧.
Allright working. Crank it up.

42
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:03,175
我刚做了个很疯狂的梦
I just had the craziest dream.

43
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,998
喔,喔,里面有我么?
Wow...wow was I in it?

44
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,020
我在..一场音乐会上
I was no...I was at a concert.

45
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,770
舞台旁边有两只
and then on the side of the stage there was this

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,029
两条腿的兔子
two-legged rabbit.

47
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,043
这有什么可怕的
I don't want no part of it. I want tap out.

48
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:22,358
听我说
Listen to me.

49
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:24,116
听我说
Listen to me.

50
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:26,858
我一动
I would moved.

51
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,639
它就跟着我动
and then he would mimic everthing I was doing.

52
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,429
别说了,我知道接下来会发生什么
Don't tell me anymore because I know where this is going.

53
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:39,750
- 我认为这兔子是我妈妈 -妈妈 是的 我知道
- You think the rabbit was my mother. - Mother. Yes I know.

54
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:43,427
多亏了你,这下我也要做噩梦了
I think it was my worst nightmare.Thank you.

55
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,434
- 这没道理 - 好
- It was hostile. - Ok.

56
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:48,204
- 这是某种预兆 - 我知道了
- It was a hostile rabbit. - I got it.

57
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,688
你要干什么?
I'm sorry. What are you doing?

58
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:56,098
就这样,你就要离开我21天?
That it? That's how you going to leave me for 21 day's next.

59
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,592
我会和你一起睡.
I want you get your sleep.

60
00:04:57,894 --> 00:05:01,477
我想你和你做其他的事情
Well I need other things beside sleep.

61
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,980
那你得保证不再提你的妈妈
You have to promise not to bring your mother then.

62
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,702
*笑声*
Hmmm

63
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:09,502
你想要30秒?
So you want the thirty?

64
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:11,286
60秒?
The sixty?

65
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:13,582
还是90秒的套餐?
Or the ninety seconds package?

66
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:15,545
我要一整个90秒的套餐.
I'm going to take the whole ninety.

67
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:20,037
这压力山大啊,压力好大.
Pressure. Pressure. Pressure.

68
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:23,624
我会想念你这笑容
I gonna miss that laugh.

69
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,458
- 还有这嘴唇
- That mouth.

70
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,819
让我看看你的眼睛
Give me those eyes.

71
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:52,377
我爱你
I love you.

72
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:08,449
我们不是这样约定的.
This is not our deal, dude.

73
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:22,191
好了,好了
Allright. Allright.

74
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:32,434
你看,你总是高估你的修理技术.
You can see you obviously overestimating your skills as a mechanic.

75
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:35,652
你说什么?
What was that?

76
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:38,192
走吧,宝贝
Let's go baby.

77
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:39,660
- 我来开
- Let me drive. - Uh uh.

78
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:41,401
- 我来开 - 不
- Let me drive. - Nope.

79
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,124
- 我来开 - 不
- Let me drive. - Nope.

80
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:46,463
拜托啦.
Pretty please.

81
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:48,231
- 你真想开么?- 当然
- You really want to drive? - Yeah.

82
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,662
那把你的车卖了,买一辆吧
Then sell that piece of shit and get a Ducatti.

83
00:07:02,612 --> 00:07:05,837
喔,厉害.
Wow. Builder not trying to shop.

84
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,577
我之所以没敲门,是因为我还想要个弟弟
I only didn't not knock because I want a brother.

85
00:07:15,397 --> 00:07:17,356
行,真烦
Okay. That's disturbing.

86
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:19,515
你确实什么都不知道
You're not supposed to know anything about that.

87
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:21,517
你只知道小孩可爱
You're supposed to just think babies are cute.

88
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:24,124
- 请你坐下  - 我真的想要个弟弟
- Will you sit down please? - Really I want a brother.

89
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,660
做的怎么样了?
How's it going?

90
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,902
- 亲爱的,给你爸爸看看 - 我还没做好
- Honey, show daddy. - I'm not done yet.

91
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:30,779
- 你做的很不错 -展示一下
- You did such a good job. - It's showtime.

92
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,368
那确实很不错
It's really great.

93
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:34,632
别盯着我看
You can't look at me.

94
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,844
为什么?-因为那让我觉得不舒服
- Why? - Because it makes me feel uncomfortable.

95
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:39,583
- 我看着你会让你不舒服?
- Am i looking at you makes you uncomfortable?

96
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:41,145
别看着我,我的爸爸叫麦克
Stop. My dad is Mike.

97
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:45,121
他在一个石油钻井平台工作
He works in a drilling rig that pumps oil out from underneath the ocean.

98
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:48,915
不对,我们并不抽石油,我们是探索者
No, no the Deepwater doesn't pump a drop of oil okay. We're the explorers.

99
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:51,357
爸爸和他的朋友们寻找石油
So my dad and his friend finds the oil

100
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:54,821
然后插入管道等古板的队员过来
and then puts it in all the plumbing so other lamer cruise can come in

101
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:56,554
- 不许乱用词汇 - 他们就是古板
- Don't say lamer - They're lamer.

102
00:07:56,755 --> 00:08:00,147
古板的队员什么都不用做,
Okay listen even those lamer dudes, they don't have to pump anything, remember.

103
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:02,101
因为石油会自己喷出来.
Because the oil comes rushing out at you.

104
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,690
- 行 行 行 -好的 好的 好的
- No no no - Allright, allright allright.

105
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:06,013
因为石油是个怪兽
Because that oil is a monster.

106
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:09,460
就像那些又大又老的恐龙一样
Like the mean old dinosaur all that oil used to be.

107
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:11,903
所以3亿年来
So for 300 million years ...

108
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:16,282
这些恐龙生活的地方越来越小,越来越小
these old dinosaurs have been getting squeeze tighter and tighter tighter

109
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:18,587
我们懂,没必要重复那么多次
We get it. Just use two tighter.

110
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,958
因为广阔的海洋环绕着这点点陆地
Cause they got a miles of earth and ocean pressing down on them.

111
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:24,167
他们被困在陆地上
They are trapped under it.

112
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:27,187
所以爸爸和他的朋友们在地上打了个洞
So Dad and his friends make a hole on their roof.

113
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:30,037
是的
Yeah!

114
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:32,413
那些又大又老的恐龙才不会信这个的
And these mean old dinosaurs can't believe it.

115
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:35,356
所以他们涌进洞里,然后 砰
So they rush to the new hole. Then smack.

116
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,207
撞到一个大机器,那是爸爸和朋友们
They ran into a big machine that he and his friends pump down

117
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,550
放在海底的,叫做
from the ocean floor called

118
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:43,136
- 大个子防护罩? - 防喷器
- Big guy preventer? - Blowout preventer.

119
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:46,015
然后他们撞上了一团泥浆
They run into this stuff called mud.

120
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:48,563
- 对 把它放这儿,他们困在了泥浆里
- Allright get it in there.But they cramp on the straw.

121
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,952
泥浆又粘又稠,把它们关在了那里.
The mud is so thick and heavy it blocks the monster from coming out.

122
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:54,384
然后他们航行到另一个地方.
And then they sail away to the next.

123
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:57,624
然后那些差劲的队员再次出现,又做同样的事情
That's when all the lame-o showed up all happy like they did something.

124
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:58,825
不准说"差劲"
Don't say lame-o.

125
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:01,693
但是其实是爸爸征服得恐龙
But it was my daddy who tamed the dinosaurs.

126
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:03,374
- 对! - 是的
- Yeah! - Yeah.

127
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:06,582
太令人惊叹了-要是你永远十岁多好
That was amazing. Stay 10 forever please.

128
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:08,589
爸爸 你得送我一块化石
Daddy you need to get me a fossil.

129
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,491
行
I will.

130
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:13,696
我要举着它说 是我的爸爸打败了那些恐龙
I want to be able to put it up and say my daddy tamed the dinosaurs.

131
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,566
告诉他麦琪的爸爸做了什么
Tell daddy what Maggie's dad did.

132
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:20,329
他的爸爸在动物园工作,给她带了一只企鹅回来
Her dad works at the zoo and he brought a real penguin.

133
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,166
怎么能这样!
You can't do that!

134
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,897
- 他带回了一次企鹅 -什么东西能和真的企鹅比?
- He brought a penguin. - How do you compete with a penguin?

135
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,380
- 那你带回来一块化石 - 那肯定违规了
- You get a fossil.- There should be rules.

136
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:31,074
我的天呐

00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:13,344
地平线号，这里是班克斯敦号，请继续
Deepwater Horizon, here Damon Bankston, go ahead.

266
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:15,446
头想知道你们在这干嘛？
Damon I wants to know what you doing here.

267
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:19,937
我们就快离开这个大怪兽了
Over here we're getting off this beast and moving on to the next.

268
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:22,741
你可以管它叫婊子... 什么时候撤？
You can call it a bitch. When are we supposed to be leaving?

269
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:26,185
上面通知我说18:00开始压注泥浆
Well I'm told to be ready to start taking on drilling mud about 18:00

270
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:27,286
哇哦
Wow.

271
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:30,217
听说早上进行了正压力试验
I heard about the positive pressure test this morning.

272
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,920
我猜他们认为负压力测试也会正常
They guess the negative test is going to run just as smooth.

273
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:35,659
-他们告诉我准备好离开 - 他们是谁？
- They told me to get ready to start moving on. - Who's they?

274
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:39,511
石油公司的人,我也不清楚
BP company men. Vidrine, Kaluza.

275
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:43,222
我正在等命令去收集你们的泥浆，还有问题吗？
I wait for the order and come pick up your mud. Any other question?

276
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:44,773
没了，就这样
No, that's it.

277
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:50,496
石油公司的人认为我们已经调试好这条"猛兽"
So BP company men Vidrine and Kaluza are hoping that we have tamed this bitch

278
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:54,684
并且在18:00进行泥浆压注，对吗，船长？
and are ready to displace drilling mud at 1800 hours is that correct, Captain?

279
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:57,178
是这样的，早上好，吉米先生
That is correct. Morning Mr. Jimmy.

280
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,213
真没想到，就这样
All the sudden. Just like that.

281
00:19:00,414 --> 00:19:01,617
谢谢你，船长
Thank you, Captain.

282
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:06,917
该死的电话还是不工作，麦克
And the goddamn phone still don't work, Mike.

283
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,540
我可是跟你一条线上的
Hey, I flew with you Mr. Jimmy.

284
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:10,939
帮我个忙，去下面找到杰森问问
Can you do me a favor run down to the drill shack

285
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,338
斯伦贝谢的人有没有做好水泥测试
And ask Jason if those Schlumberger guys did their job. If they run the cement log.

286
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,442
这就去
Roger that.

287
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:18,444
谢谢
Thank you.

288
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:23,394
先生们，你们能告诉我写水泥测试的情况吗？
Gentlemen, you couldn't perhaps enlighten me on the cement log situation, could you?

289
00:19:24,686 --> 00:19:25,754
水泥测试？
Cement log?

290
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:29,143
他们怎么计划的？怎么进行的？到底有没有做？
You know if they're planning it? Running it? Did it?

291
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:31,061
恩？
Yeah?

292
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:33,426
不太清楚？ 嘿，罗尼
Not really. Hey, Ronnie.

293
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:35,880
你的野马可能是点火方面的问题
Might be the ignition problem on your Mustang.

294
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:37,683
我想可能是火花塞的问题
I'm seeing it maybe failed plug.

295
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:39,939
也可能是某根线或者分油器
Could be a wire. Could be distributer.

296
00:19:40,202 --> 00:19:42,032
- 听起来有没有跳杠？ -没有
- Does it sounds like it skipping? - No.

297
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:46,292
我在想这些值钱的设备是不是都坏了
You know what I'm going to do for you young lady? You keep

298
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:48,026
- 谢谢啊 - 听着
- Geez, thanks. - Hey...

299
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:49,897
手动还是自动？
Stickshift or automatic?

300
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:51,099
你知道我的
Do you know me?

301
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,811
换挡得悠着点
Oh you gonna start grinding shit out of that clutch, I know that.

302
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:56,162
- 是嘛，丰田先生 -恩
- Oh yeah says Mr. Toyota. - Aha.

303
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,697
平台人员请注意，安全通知
Attention all rig.

304
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:13,060
设备来了
Moving equipment.

305
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:19,782
过来，宝贝，过来宝贝
Come to me, baby. Come to me, baby. Come on.

306
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,385
停
Cancel.

307
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,134
抽400桶泥浆
Three four hundred barrels mud.

308
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:28,775
收到，开始执行
Roger that. Beginning actuation.

309
00:20:32,387 --> 00:20:35,304
安装钻油管好有趣,非常有趣
Insert drill pipe is very funny, very funny.

310
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:36,405
闭嘴
Shut up.

311
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:39,774
嘿，唐老鸭
Hey. Duck!

312
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:42,112
啥事儿，麦克？
What up, Mike?

313
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,570
- 你怎么样，凯勒布？ - 嘿，麦克
- How are you doing, Caleb? - Hey Mike how you doing man?

314
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:48,973
- 几个钟头前还可以 - 为什么?
- It's a lot better couple of hours ago. - Why is that?

315
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:50,275
因为那时我在睡觉
I was asleep.

316
00:20:50,476 --> 00:20:51,278
恩？
Yes?

317
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:53,830
我们都被叫起来一直加班
Yeah. We all got woken up guys got us working over.

318
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:56,725
如果我们想晚上走的话，还得安装不少管子
Got a lot of pipes to pull for if we want to get out of here at night.

319
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:58,127
日常着装？看起来挺美啊
What's up with the street clothes? You look pretty.

320
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,524
杰米挺火大，他想知道水泥测试的情况
Aw man, Mr. Jimmy is pissed he wants to know if we got some of that cement bond log test.

321
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:03,259
不太确定，我想没有
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

322
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,001
没有？ 嘿，肖恩！ - 恩？
-No? Hey, Shane! - Yeah?

323
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:08,080
过来， 斯伦贝谢进行水泥测试了吗？
Come here buddy. Schlumberger run a cement bond log test?

324
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:11,187
不知道，我觉得他们没做，我才起来
I do not know. I don't think they did it. I just woke up, so ...

325
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:13,598
- 你是蠢吗？-蠢不蠢不知道，
- Aren't that stupid? - I  don't know if it's stupid ...

326
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,388
但肯定不聪明
but it ain't smart.

327
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,172
瞧，同步小王子们
Look at what you guys like synchronized swimmers.

328
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:20,735
你要是用脑过度，他会头疼的
I think if you think too much you going to give him a headache.

329
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:22,508
- 忙去吧 - 好的
- Piped down. - Yes.

330
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:23,810
往上，上

331
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,396
- 我看着了, - 大家好
- I care workers. - Hello.

332
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:31,100
你这穿的是啥？
What the hell are you wearing?

333
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:34,071
吉米想知道斯伦贝谢有没有做过水泥测试
Mr. Jimmy wants to know if the Schlumbeger run the cement bond log test.

334
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:37,185

- The what? - Cement job. Test the cement job. Come on man work with me.

- Who that again? - Cut the shit man come on Jimmy's piss man.

336

- 斯伦贝谢, 你个二货 - 他们进行测试了吗？
- Schlumberger, you democrat. - Did they run the test?

337
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:45,480
没有， 维德林和卡鲁扎直接让他们回去了
No, Vidrine and Kaluza sent them home without testing anything.

338
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:49,368
- 为什么他们要这样做？ - 他们也没跟我说，麦克
- Why the hell would they do that? - I don't feel the urge to take me through their thinking Mike.

339
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:51,444
我觉得吧，就是
But I assume it got something to do with...

340
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:53,787
省钱，省钱，省钱
Money, money, money, money

341
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:55,834
省钱！
Money!

342
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:57,390
电话已经坏了
The phone is broken.

343
00:21:58,269 --> 00:21:59,427
该死的
Shit.

344
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:01,645
嗨，吉米先生
Hey, Mr. Jimmy.

345
00:22:01,846 --> 00:22:02,948
说
Go Ahead.

346
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:05,844
石油公司让那些人回家了，啥测试也没做
That BP sent the Schlumberger team home without running any test.

347
00:22:05,945 --> 00:22:08,100
没进行水泥测试
There was no cement bond log.

348
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:09,492
谢了，麦克
Thank you, Mike.

349
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:13,263
麦克，工作站A死机了

- 该死的 -又蓝屏了

351
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,614
嗨，唐老鸭，你的工作站还工作吗？
Hey, Duck, is that chair still up?

352
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:21,345
不太稳定，而且我这的烟雾报警失效了
My computer screen is shaky and my smoke detector's out.

353
00:22:21,546 --> 00:22:22,642
你那怎么样，麦克
How you doing, Mike?

354
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:23,844
该死
Shit.

355
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:26,428
我去拿工具回来修
I double back and grab my tools and I'll be back to fix it.

356
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:28,702
用邦迪和口香糖么
Doing it all with band-aids and bubble gum my man.

357
00:22:28,903 --> 00:22:31,898
每次我想成立个乐队，这都能找到3、4个人
Every time I peel off a band-aid this on this rig i will find three or four more.

358
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:33,458
不行啊
Spitting glue ain't getting it done.

359
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:34,794
“省钱”那段，来吧
One more time with the money. Come on.

360
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:37,165
- 你们都练了这么久了 - 省钱，省钱，省钱
- You've been rehearsing for weeks. - Money money...

361
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:38,436
不是，高潮那段
Nah, nah the good part man.

362
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:40,797
这就是高潮了！省钱！
That is the good part.

363
00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:45,254
死了也值了，全能的美元啊
It could kill for that money. The almighty dollar.

364
00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:46,474
你好啊,好莱坞
Hello, Hollywood.

365
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,732
- 麦克！ - 什么事，戴尔？
- Mike! - What's the word, Dale ?!

366
00:22:54,932 --> 00:22:57,887
- 我们已经完事了吗？ 我也不清楚，可能吧
- What do you know? We done? - Not much. Could be.

367
00:22:58,088 --> 00:23:00,361
好吧，今晚我打算钓鱼
Yeah I am going fishing tonight. Undercover.

368
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:03,995
今晚可能开始正式干活了,没时间钓鱼了
I got a feeling we're not getting off this well tonight I think nobody is going to be doing no fishing.

369
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:07,353
你要用你的吊车吗？ 钓个鲸鱼啥的
You going to use your crane man? Maybe catch a beluga or shamu?

370
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:08,657
好主意
Good idea.

371
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:12,507
该死， 我打赌下一次我们还会在同一个位置
Shit. Willing to make a bet we'll hit the same spot next hitch.

372
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,174
- 赔率呢？ - 50比1
- Yeah give me odds? - 50 to one.

373
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,650
不赌了
Ahh shit. I ain't touching that.

374
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:19,152
30比1，同一个位置
30 to one. Same spot.

375
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:20,118
没可能
No way.

376
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,510
麦克 威廉姆斯，你个小气鬼！
Mike Williams, you cheap bastard.

377
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:09,322
- 帕崔克里- 怎么样，麦克？
- Patrick. - What's going on Mike?

378
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:11,441

- 准备好了？ -恩
-We're done? - Yeah.

380
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:14,997
- 谁说的？ -我不能告诉你
- Who you heard that from? - I can't tell you all that much.

381
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:16,281
什么叫你不能告诉我？
What do you mean you can't tell me that?

382
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:17,383
- 就是不行- 为什么?
- I just can't tell you. - Why can't you tell me that?

383
00:24:17,585 --> 00:24:20,323
我不能说,不过我能告诉你戈登正在找你
I can not tell you. But I can tell you that Gordon is looking for you.

384
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:22,491
-戈登告诉你完工了？ -不是不是
- Did Gordon tell you that? - No he didn't tell me that.

385
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:24,705
- 他要干嘛？ -我也不清楚，好像要给你看什么东西
- What going on then? - I dont know. He got something to show you.

386
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:26,527
- 你知道些啥？ - 我们准备好了
- What do you know? - I know we're done.

387
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:28,479
你去我工作间了？
Are you on my shop?

388
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:30,848
- 没 - 不准碰我的东西
- No. - Don't touch my shit.

389
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:32,923
- 我没碰你东西 - 赶紧去工作
- I wasn't touching your shit - Go fix something.

390
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,056
- 早上好，麦克- 你也是，该死
- Have a good day, Mike. - You too. Shit.

391
00:24:40,636 --> 00:24:42,013
等下，亲爱的
Wait babe hold on.

392
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:44,554
你刚才说什么？
What were you saying?

393
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:47,112
好消息，直升机没有坠毁
Great news. Chopper didn't crash.

394
00:24:47,313 --> 00:24:49,989
真失望，我还打算重新嫁人了呢
Shit, I assumed and then i remarried.

395
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,859
是吗？ 有钱人家吗？记得你老妈曾经说的：
Oh yeah he rich?

396
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,116
“嫁个有钱人生活有保障，宝贝儿”
What yo momma always said "Just as easy to marry a rich man Felicia honey"

397
00:24:56,317 --> 00:24:59,171
要是每次你提到我妈我能得到一块钱的话，
If I had a nickel for every dumb shit my mom said...

398
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:03,189
我都已经是个富婆了 顺道说一句，你得修好这个烤箱
I wouldn't need a rich man.You gotta fix this by the way.

399
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,994
等我回来就修，别担心
I'm going to fix it as soon as I get home. Don't worry.

400
00:25:06,395 --> 00:25:07,809
往电脑这边走走
Hey come closer to the computer.

401
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:09,849
过来，电脑这边
Come over to the computer.

402
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:11,663
让我看看你的眼睛
Show me those eyes.

403
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:13,159
你那情况如何？
How's everything?

404
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,004
每次都一样，跟地狱一样
Same shit. Well from hell.

405
00:25:16,186 --> 00:25:18,401
-准备好了吗？ -预备，3
You ready? - Three.

406
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:19,602
2
Two ...

407
00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:21,006
-1 - 现在
- One ... - Go!

408
00:25:24,297 --> 00:25:25,621
这张脸
That face.

409
00:25:26,846 --> 00:25:28,278
愤青！
Sociopath.

410
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,760
代表着专注，决心，浓烈和冲动
That is focus. That is determination. That is intensity. Drive.

411
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:40,176
- 我赢了 - 讨厌你 真讨厌
- Hah. - I knew you. I hate it.

412
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:43,262
- 一会见 -好的，拜拜
- I'll see you soon, okay? - Allright. See you.

413
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:47,009
为什么动我的东西？
Who's touching my shit?

414
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:50,845
别动我我东西，别动我东西
Dont'touch my shit. Don't touch my shit.

415
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:53,896
他们想让我们去下一个工作地点
Can I tell you where to hit on our next location?

416
00:25:54,507 --> 00:25:55,642
卡斯基达
Kaskida.

417
00:25:56,243 --> 00:25:59,952
这些你跟公司的人看过吗？卡鲁扎，维德林,任何人？
Was this run by anybody BP? Kaluza. Vidrine, anybody?

418
00:26:00,153 --> 00:26:02,673
维德林跟我确认过，这是他们提出来的
Vidrine right about me. He's come from Virginia.

419
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:08,208
鲍勃，我来告诉你,什么是最重要的
Bob, let me impose upon you what I think is most important here.

420
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:12,802
我们必须在5月16号之前从马看多赶到卡斯基达
We need to go to Macondo to Kaskida by 16 May.

421
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:14,954
卡斯基达不同寻常的大
Kaskida is non-common prospect.

422
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,781
30-40亿桶，比公司的产量都大
3 to 4 billion barrels. That worth more than BP itself.

423
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:20,278
你看我像圣诞老人么？
Do I look like fucking Santa Claus?

424
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,063
你看起来是挺像圣诞老人的
You do look a little like Santa Claus.

425
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:28,171
迈尔斯为密西根打过球，他确实有路易斯安那的风格
Coach Miles may played in Michigan but that boy got Lousiana soul.

426
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:30,380
- 对阵萨班吗,-是的 因为我们赢了
- That's cause we win dummy.

427
00:26:30,581 --> 00:26:33,013
- 好像你上过阿巴玛大学一样
Same we like you went to Alabama

428
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:33,897
又没跟你说.
Did I ask you

429
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:37,701
当我还小的时候就有人教我边招手边说再见
When I was potty training I was taught to flush way before I see you in Tuscaloosa.

430
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:40,293
当你是当官的呢?在哪儿开小差
You boys working for the government? Clean the clean room..

431
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:45,235
我们正在准备最后的泥浆，已经超过35MPa压力了，
We're still clearing mud from our last gig. Over 5000 psi. Grab a mop.

432
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:47,690
太疯狂了
That's just crazy..

433
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:50,742
看看这次S涌造成的好事
Look at the pressure did to this drill string during the kick.

434
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,245
该好好表扬下啊
That's one for the trophy case.

435
00:26:52,548 --> 00:26:54,700
嘿，帕崔克里说你有事找我
True that. - Hey Patrick said you got something for me?

436
00:26:54,802 --> 00:26:58,544
是的，先生4天前页岩分离器4出现故障
Yes sir. Before you all took off last time shaky four goes down

437
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:01,932
我查了一下，发现了问题的根源
after poking around we finally found the source of the problem.

438
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:05,378
你看看，我从去年开始就一直帮你留着
Check this out. I've been hiding this for you since your last hitch.

439
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:09,316
这是颗牙齿？
Is that a tooth?

440
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,087
哇哦，我家小姑娘一定会开心死的
Ho buddy you just made my little girl's year.

441
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:15,776
她爸爸也一样，谢谢你，我欠你的
And to her old man. Thank you. I owe you man.

442
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:23,137
好的 现在开始搭建钻杆
Well, let's put together the kelly.

443
00:27:23,338 --> 00:27:25,222
嘿，戈登
Hey, Gordon.

444
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:28,777
嘿， 听了这事你肯定会发疯的
I'm telling you man, it's going to be full-on shift tonight.

445
00:27:28,978 --> 00:27:30,538
他们把斯伦贝谢送回家了
They sent him home.

446
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,740
是的
Yeah.

447
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:36,057
跟我来，麦克
Walk with me, Mike.

448
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:38,655
- 去干吗？ - 去谋杀公司某个的头头
- Where we headed? - Murder some BP company men.

449
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:41,257
- 好的，我这有锤子和螺丝刀 -非常好
- Shit I got hammer, screwdriver. - Excellent.

450
00:27:42,673 --> 00:27:46,120
麦克，早上你刷牙了吗？
Mike, do you brush your teeth this morning?

451
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:47,045
是的
Yes sir.

452
00:27:47,174 --> 00:27:49,149
- 好孩子，你剔牙了吗？
- Boy, did you floss?

453
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:50,744
没，为啥
No, no why?

454
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,907
剔牙会为你将来省钱省心
Save you a lot of pain and money in the long run I tell you.

455
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:58,415
- 吉米要去跟公司的某人发火 - 水泥测试没有做
- Oh shit Jimmy oh we about to go murder BP guys. - They never ran the cement log..

456
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:01,082
他们啥也没做
They sent them home and we're doing shit now we going after the BP.

457
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:03,196
怎么？ 欠他们钱吗？
Hey, what's the matter? You owe them a lot of money?

458
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:05,485
来啊，麦克，跟我一起
Come on, Mike, stay on my hip.

459
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:06,586
去吧
Get them.

460
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:09,206
上吧，宝贝
Yeah baby.

461
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:12,742
看看第51行，你会看到你的预算上限的
Don, look at the line 51. You'll see it cost maximum.

462
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:14,245
没看到51啊
I do not see 51.

463
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:17,334
喔,这不是维德林和卡鲁扎本人吗?
Don Vidrine and Bob Kaluza.

464
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:20,163
- 欢迎，吉米先生 - 是么?
- Welcome back Mr. Jimmy. - Yeah

465
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:24,140
现在我们放置了15立方米的水泥
So we got all 500 cc cement poured down?

466
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,441
是的
Yep.

467
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:27,867
水泥固井是唯一保护我们安全的设施
That cement only thing between us and the blowout.

468
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:29,766
- 已经凝固了吗？ - 是的
- And it's cued? - Yes.

469
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:33,170
时间足够吗？ 要做好这件事是需要花时间的
Had enough time huh? Face time doing it right.

470
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:38,040
如果水泥有问题，那就是问题
I mean that cement job is compromised then everything above it is too.

471
00:28:38,141 --> 00:28:40,636
没事儿，“休斯敦，我们这没事儿”
It's not compromised you used to don't have a problem.

472
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:43,429
我估计斯伦贝斯也是这么说的
So I assume Schlumberger guy said the same.

473
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,176
而且拉力试验也是同样的结果
Cement bond log they ran say the same huh?

474
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:50,628
我们对水泥的强度是有信心的，是吧？
We are confident in the integrity of our cement job are we not?

475
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,422
我们确实对水泥固井的生效很有信心，
We're quite comfortable with the integrity of that cement. That's true.

476
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,487
你就像我爷爷一样
Just like my grandad.

477
00:28:57,688 --> 00:28:58,688
什么？
Pardon.

478
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:02,262
我爷爷永远也不去看牙医
You see my granddaddy he never even went to the dentist.

479
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:05,375
他不想知道他的牙出了什么问题.但最后还是得处理它
He didn't want to know what was wrong. Cause then he will have to deal with it.

480
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,403
你不想知道水泥到底是不是有问题
You don't want to know that cement job ran as well as shit

481
00:29:08,604 --> 00:29:11,680
就因为项目已经超期43天，超预算5000万了
cause you're 43 days and 50 million dollars overbudget.

482
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:14,161
这就算有结论了吧，吉米先生
You really shouldn't include yourself now Mr. Jimmy.

483
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:18,763
公司决定开始钻井，鲍勃 那么无论结果如何都是你的责任
BP picked this spot to drill, Bob.Consequences that's on you guys.

484
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:22,519
当然，我得处理这个烂摊子，所以我也有责任
Of course I got to try and deal with those consequences. So yeah I'm included the point is

485
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,470
问题是，他们没做检验就让回去了
You sent the testing team home before they could do their job.

486
00:29:25,671 --> 00:29:28,000
就因为试验结果可能不让他们满意
Maybe give you all some news you all didn't want to hear.

487
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:31,089
这个试验得花他们多少钱？ 12.50万？
What would it cost you right now? The test? 125 grand?

488
00:29:32,182 --> 00:29:34,856
你们公司市值1800亿啊，也太小气了
You're $180 billion dollar company you cheap

489
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:40,031
我们市值1860亿，小气才能赚更多的钱
That's why we're a $186 billion dollar company,We worry about those bills.

490
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:41,734
我只担心我的平台
I worry about my rig.

491
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:44,608
我的人都住在上面，而你们只是租用
My crew lives on it. You just ran it.

492
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:47,966
丹，我知道我们得停下来做点维护工作
Don. You and I both know we need some downtime for maintenance.

493
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:50,655
麦克， 有多少机器需要检修了？
Mike, how many our machines need repair?

494
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,482
- 390，吉米先生 - 390？
390, Mr. Jimmy. - Three hundred and ninety? - Yes, sir.

495
00:29:53,683 --> 00:29:55,982
是的， 差不多是全部机械的10%
Almost all the same to those machinery board.

496
00:29:56,184 --> 00:29:58,357
- 举几个例子 -几个？
Name a few for me. - A few?

497
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:03,559
我想知道有没有关键设备损坏了
I would love to exactly what piece of mission critical equipment are down.

498
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,246
我该从何说起呢
Shit where do I start?

499
00:30:05,447 --> 00:30:09,253
钻井工作站A， BOP控制器
A driller chair, process station 18, BOP control part,

500
00:30:09,455 --> 00:30:13,195
电话，存储，GPS天线，监控录像，互联网
telephone system, pipe rack system, GPS antenna, direct TV system, wireless internet,

501
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:18,039
卷盘，水泵，烟雾报警器,系统混合器,驱动管理,警报系统......
iron roughneck, top dryer barrack bag, system auxilliary
drivers control, saltwater service pump, smoke alarm in the galley

502
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,974
为什么你会觉得热呢?，因为这里的空调也坏了
The reason why you're sweating so hard is because the compressor on the AC is down too.

503
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:25,417
只有厕所是好的？
Everything but the toilet huh?

504
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:28,781
不是，厕所也坏了，但是那不归我管
No, no you got problem there too but I don't do shitters. That's engineering.

505
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,025
你是干什么的?
Who are you?

506
00:30:32,217 --> 00:30:33,911
麦克 威廉姆斯， 工程师
Mike Williams, Chief Electronic Technician.

507
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:37,347
我来重复一遍我在直升机上跟那些头头们说的话
I'm going to tell you what I told your executives on the chopper ride in

508
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:39,721
他们来了就走了
At the time...

509
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:43,137
我们得保证平台的正常稳定
We're gonna properly secure this well for production platform

510
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:46,605
在他们来采油之前
coming right after us and start pumping oil.

511
00:30:46,706 --> 00:30:49,976
不幸的是，这些工作需要时间
Unfortunately, to do it properly takes time.

512
00:30:50,077 --> 00:30:51,379
43天？
43 days?

513
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,198
44天？
44 days?

514
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:54,399
继续数，鲍勃
Keep counting, Bob.

515
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:55,547
45天？
45 days?

516
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:57,026
46天？
46 days?

517
00:30:57,227 --> 00:30:58,696
来块饼干，鲍勃
Have a cookie, Bob.

518
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:01,896
没有水泥测试
Can't run a cement log.

519
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:04,063
我告诉你我们接下来怎么办
I'll tell you what we going to do now.

520
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:08,156
先做负压力测试，然后再说其他的
We going to run negative pressure test before we do anything else.

521
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:09,857
如果你真的觉得必要的话
Do you really think we really need to...

522
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:12,470
我认为这很必要，你也应该这么想
I really think we need one Bob. So should you.

523
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:16,902
尤其是我们现在也不知道这口井到底稳不稳定
Especially since we got no idea whether this well stable or not.

524
00:31:18,205 --> 00:31:20,832
接通了！ 好日子要来了！
Hey! Dial tone. Day is looking up.

525
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:23,726
安德森先生，我是吉米
Mr. Anderson, it's Mr. Jimmy.

526
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:28,165
我们要做负压力测试，从3000米开始
We're going to run negative pressure test start tripping out 3,000 ft of pipe.

527
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,530
谢谢
Thank you.

528
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,861
43天延误
Days behind schedule: 43 days.

529
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:47,496
小伙子，不好意思，我要找麦克 威廉姆斯
Young man. Pardon me. Can you please tell me where I can find Mr. Mike Williams?

530
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,322
是的,在维修站，饭厅隔壁
Yes, sir. He is in the ET shops on the second deck by the coffee shop.

531
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:52,264
- 谢谢 - 午安，先生
- Thank you very much. - Have a good one for the day, sir.

532
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,566
你也是
And you sir.

533
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:58,940
威廉姆斯先生？
Mr. Williams?

534
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:02,142
维德森先生，迷路了？
Mr. Vidrine, are you lost?

535
00:32:02,717 --> 00:32:03,852
没
Not at all.

536
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:07,717
就是来找你聊聊
Just looking to come by and visit with you for a minute.

537
00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:09,434
有什么我能帮你的么>
How can I help?

538
00:32:09,635 --> 00:32:13,629
只是感觉会上你还有话要说？
Seems as though you had something more you wanted to say in there.

539
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,720
说来我听听
I thought I give you the time to say it.

540
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:25,853
所以这台钻机坏了？
Okay. So this rig is broke?

541
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:28,360
- 我可没这样说 -感觉你就这意思
- I didnt' say that. - Sounds like you did.

542
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:31,383
维德森先生你来我这到底干什么?
Is there a reason why you in my shop, Mr. Vidrine?

543
00:32:31,942 --> 00:32:35,030
我们公司是个超大规模的公司，麦克
We a big company Mike. BP.

544
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:38,867
一个复杂而庞大的组织
Very big complex organization.

545
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:41,838
有无数的小部件协同工作
A lot of moving parts. Millions moving parts.

546
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,719
有成千上万的员工
Thousands upon thousands of people.

547
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:49,507
我们非常努力的试图保持这些人
And we all work very hard to ensure that all those people.

548
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:54,093
这些部门都能正常工作，从而得到一个最好的结果
All those movement parts are fuctioning properly as a mean to an ends.

549
00:32:54,194 --> 00:32:56,633
一个可以挣钱的结果，
A very profitable win for all of us.

550
00:32:56,835 --> 00:32:58,502
当然了，这是宏伟的目标
They the big picture.

551
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:03,473
但是也有不一样的，就像你们这些只看眼前的
They the little picture. Like you and the malfunctioned shitters.

552
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:07,906
问题在于，所有一切都是相互影响的
Don't you see point of fact they all kind of interconnected.

553
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:10,133
像流动的水一样
They flow but working, Mike.

554
00:33:10,234 --> 00:33:12,101
如果你这有问题，那一切都有问题
So if you off, it's off.

555
00:33:12,304 --> 00:33:17,150
我也有问题，都有问题，整个项目就停了
Then I'm off. Then we off. Then the whole damn train is off.

556
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:20,004
明白我的意思吗？ 威廉姆斯先生
You feel me, Mr. Williams?

557
00:33:20,106 --> 00:33:22,345
你吃药了吗? 维德森先生
You on medication Mr. Vidrine?

558
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:27,460
我只是在评估，我们这趟火车
I'm merely trying to assess just how close this train

559
00:33:27,661 --> 00:33:29,639
离脱轨还有多近
is hugging the track.

560
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:33,169
好吧，我明白
Okay I hear you.

561
00:33:33,431 --> 00:33:35,442
- 想听我的意见？ -恩
You want my take? I mean you really want my take.- I do.

562
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:39,913
好吧，你这是试图让飞机在降落的时候正好用完油
I think you all trying to run out of fuel as the wheels touch down.

563
00:33:40,615 --> 00:33:43,659
那可不是个好主意
Running on gasoline as the plane land is not smart.

564
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,140
这可不是明智之举,这是一种侥幸
It's flawed thinking. It's hope as a tactic.

565
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:52,448
记住了，谢谢
Duly noted and much appreciated, sir.

566
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,142
这仅仅是个小员工的小意见
Just the opinion of little guy.

567
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:58,372
那是鲶鱼吗？
That a catfish?

568
00:33:58,673 --> 00:34:01,177
恩，65磅
Yeap. 65 pounds.

569
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:03,575
你们怎么钓的？
What it all caught at? Nibbling?

570
00:34:03,777 --> 00:34:06,525
手抓，直接用手抓鱼
Noodling. We noodle for catfish.

571
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:10,091
有趣的是，我跟我哥们去抓鱼的时候
You know that's funny. Cause when we go noodling

572
00:34:10,192 --> 00:34:13,195
我们去到湖上，点上灯
Your best way to fish is the lake. We walk down the boat ramp.

573
00:34:13,396 --> 00:34:16,742
找到最大最黑的洞伸手去掏
We look for the biggest, darkest, blackest hole we can stick our arm in.

574
00:34:16,944 --> 00:34:19,927
希望这些鲶鱼能咬住我们的手
We hope those big son of bitches bite down on us as hard as he can.

575
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:21,737
这样我们才能把它抓出来
So we can rip his ass out of that hole

576
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:24,942
我们希望被咬，被咬才能抓到鱼
We want to get bit. That's the plan.

577
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:27,298
区别在于，我们已经做好被咬的准备了
Difference is we're ready for that bite.

578
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,907
我们有合适的鞋子，帽子，手套，墨镜，并且做好了一切准备
We are ready. I'm wearing shoes, hat, gloves, golf cap, sunglasses and we are ready.

579
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:36,902
我可不会不做准备的就把手伸进去然后祈求老天保佑
I don't stick my hand with that monster and hope for the best.

580
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,622
没准备的空想目标是不现实的，丹
Uh huh. Hope ain't a tactic Don.

581
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,301
耽误你时间了
I thank you for your time.

582
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,749
- 祝你顺利，先生 - 你也是
- Have a wonderful day, sir. - And you.

583
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:51,799
卑鄙小人
That some shit.

584
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,207
全体注意
Attention on the rig!

585
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:55,583
注意，负压试验即将开始
Negative pressure test is about to begin.
全体注意
Attention on the rig!

586
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,694
注意，负压试验即将开始
Negative pressure test is about to begin.

587
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,448
无关人员请离开现场
All non-essential personnel please stay clear of the rig platform.

588
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:02,851
顺着水流引过来
Bring it to the current.

589
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:05,284
右转10°，锁定176°
Come right two degrees lock in at 176.

590
00:35:05,485 --> 00:35:08,666
右转10°，转到176°
Turn right 10 degrees. Change to 176.

591
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:09,967
转向中
Turning.

592
00:35:17,878 --> 00:35:21,108
- 戴蒙 这是你的第五杯了吧?
- Damon B. Bankson ... - Is that your fifth cup?

593
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:24,256
随便问问
Just saying.

594
00:35:24,486 --> 00:35:26,998
去看看 确认一切准备就绪
Why don't you go ahead and make sure they ready to get after it.

595
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,809
这可能是最终测试了
This might be the final test.

596
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,088
收到
Roger that.

597
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:33,560
- 又一次负压测试？ -又一次？
- Another negative pressure test? - Another negative pressure test.

598
00:35:33,761 --> 00:35:35,835
- 有问题吗？- 这个井不行
- Is there a problem? - We got a bad well.

599
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:38,189
油井都这熊样，干这行还能指望什么
They all bad wells. Tough prospect.

600
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,890
抓住这个,好莱坞 进去没?
- Get this, Hollywood? - Have we entered?

601
00:35:43,716 --> 00:35:45,698
就位，锁定
In position. Locked.

602
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:49,985
锁定在176°，船长 -我们向右转了10°
- Locked at 176, Captain. - Came right 10 degrees.

603
00:35:50,186 --> 00:35:52,737
- 已经准备好做你们的负压试验了 - 好
- We locked in you all can run the negative test. - Yeah.

604
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:54,532
开始吧，杰森
Go head, Jason.

605
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,581
收到 关闭上环形防喷器
Lose the annular.

606
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:21,657
负压测试开始
Initiate negative pressure test.

607
00:36:22,058 --> 00:36:25,219
开始钻井管道压力测试
Initiate drill pipe pressure test.

608
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,169
你真觉得这是最后一次测试了吗？
You really think this is the last test?

609
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:54,422
该死的，我当然想 这口井来自地狱啊
Shit, I hope so, yes. This is the Well from Hell, girl.

610
00:37:19,764 --> 00:37:21,700
应该不会持续多久吧
Yeah, that ain't going to last long.

611
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:24,034
就这点能耐？
That's all you got.

612
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:26,753
进球了！
Goal!

613
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,244
100磅/平方英尺
100 pounds per squre inch.

614
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:45,855
问题不大，往回推了点，就是不想让我们好过
Okay, pushing back on us a little. It's trying to keep us on it.

615
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:53,950
丹，你拿到上个月我给你那瓶酒了吗？
Don, you get that bottle of wine that I sent you a month ago?

616
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:57,713
恩，谢谢我不光拿到了我已经喝过了
I did I did thank you very much. Not only I got it, I drank me.

617
00:37:58,339 --> 00:37:59,885
- 不错吧？ - 非常感谢
- Pretty good huh? - Very nice.

618
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,662
那是瓶托斯卡纳，对不
It's Super Tuscan, yeah?

619
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:04,921
轧佳，是吧，我知道你会喜欢
Gaya, right? I know you like it.

620
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:06,863
轧亚

621
00:38:07,464 --> 00:38:08,464
什么？
Sorry?

622
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:11,111
轧亚，这么叫的
Gaja. So it called.

623
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:21,730
我想已经他们跑了一半了吧
I think they're about halfway there.

624
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:24,453
你都喝多少咖啡了，hank？
How much coffee you drinking these days, Hank?

625
00:38:24,654 --> 00:38:26,944
船长，我几个月前就戒咖啡了
Look I gave it up several months ago.

626
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:28,523
现在只喝绿茶
I drink nothing but green tea now.

627
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,818
再没有接触咖啡因，每天做做瑜伽
Stop taking the coffee doing yoga everyday.

628
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:34,006
坚持两周了已经
Two weeks now.

629
00:38:47,512 --> 00:38:49,567
每平方英寸450磅
450 psi.

630
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:56,726
我觉得不太行啊
This don't look good to me.

631
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:03,786
压力警报
Pressure! Warning!

632
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:05,835
900
900 psi.

633
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:13,637
搞什么鬼
What the hell? Dammit.

634
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:21,915
压力警报.
Pressure alert.

635
00:39:23,066 --> 00:39:24,546
1395磅
Pressure alert.

636
00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:26,929
压力警报
Pressure alert.

637
00:39:28,873 --> 00:39:30,523
压力警报
Pressure alert.

638
00:39:31,993 --> 00:39:33,213
压力警报
Pressure alert.

639
00:39:34,887 --> 00:39:36,603
稳定在1395了，吉米先生
It only 1395 psi, Mr. Jimmy.

640
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:38,521
压力挺大啊
That's a lot of pressure.

641
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:41,329
恩，足够把你的车劈成两半了
Yeah. Enough to cut your car in half.

642
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:43,232
打开上环形防喷器
Open up the annular unit.

643
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,870
好莱坞，打开钻井管到的阀门
Hollywood, open the drill pipe valve.

644
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:47,980
我们得释放些压力
We got to free pressure.

645
00:39:49,484 --> 00:39:53,461
同志们，我得说，试验的结果不行
Gentlemen, I had to say this that is a bad test.

646
00:39:53,662 --> 00:39:54,764
也不一定吧
Not necessarily.

647
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:57,272
丹，一个好的试验结果
Don, a good test ...

648
00:39:57,473 --> 00:40:00,266
从0开始，保持0，到0结束
Starts zero. Stays at zero. Ends at zero.

649
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:01,467
谢谢
Thank you.

650
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:06,236
好吧， 有压力，但是没有泥浆从管道溢出
So there is pressure but there was no mud.

651
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:07,464
解释给我听听
Flowing out of that pipe. Now explain that to me.

652
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:16,037
我承认，是挺奇怪的
That's a confusing result I give you that.

653
00:40:16,238 --> 00:40:19,496
我跟卡扎鲁已经讨论了无数次关于这些钻井管到了
Kaluza and I have talked about this drill pipe.

654
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:27,021
是有些奇怪的地方，他管它叫膀胱效应
There's something off with it. He says it's a bladder effect.

655
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:28,324
膀胱效应？
Bladder effect?

656
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:32,319
恩，杰森应该知道是什么意思
Bladder effect. He said Jason would know what he's talking about.

657
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,693
压力表没有显示溢出
I say that flow right there.

658
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:35,495
是的
Right.

659
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:36,497
看这边
Look at here.

660
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:38,530
嘿，别擦我们还有用呢
Hey! We actually needed that.

661
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,162
膀胱效应
Bladder effect.

662
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:44,644
有一个压力团
It is a pocket of pressure

663
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:48,522
阻塞在放喷口附近
trapped around the annular

664
00:40:48,723 --> 00:40:51,401
被传感器误读成钻井管到压力
which reeks like drill pressure

665
00:40:51,603 --> 00:40:56,062
因为这些压力就被阻塞在那
because it is trapped right there

666
00:40:56,264 --> 00:40:57,715
传感器的附近
sitting right there on the sensor.

667
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:01,140
如果这个确确实实的压力问题
If this was a legitimate pressure issue

668
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:06,855
泥浆应该会从钻井管到里流上来
the we would have mud flowing right back
up and out of that drill pipe right there.

669
00:41:07,157 --> 00:41:09,276
我们怎么验证这个情况呢？
Now how we going to test this?

670
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:12,746
需要重复一次负压试验
We going to run that negative pressure test again.

671
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:16,547
只是这次在压井管进行，而不是钻井管
But we going to run it on the kill line. Not on the drill pipe.

672
00:41:16,748 --> 00:41:19,528
很显然，钻井管现在有问题
Obviously our problem is with that drill pipe.

673
00:41:19,668 --> 00:41:21,644
不可能
You cannot have

674
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:26,472
有如此大的压力
13,095 pounds of pressure per square inch

675
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:29,415
大道可以把车劈成两半
enough to cut your car in half.

676
00:41:29,616 --> 00:41:35,045
还不把泥浆从管道中压出
and not have any fluid being forced up and out of that pipe by that pressure.

677
00:41:37,353 --> 00:41:41,592
兄弟们，你们鞋上有泥浆吗？有吗？
Boys, do you have a whole mess of drilling mud on your boots out there?

678
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:42,593
嘿，丹
Hey, Don.

679
00:41:46,531 --> 00:41:48,099
里面正在吵的有点火热
It got hot in the drill shack.

680
00:41:48,401 --> 00:41:51,039
我们有问题，是钻井管的问题
We have a problem with that drill pipe.

681
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,395
还是传感器给了错误的读数
or with the sensor giving us a false reading.

682
00:41:56,553 --> 00:42:01,161
还是说，下面千万个部件都可能有问题了
Or any other of a thousands moving parts down there.

683
00:42:01,288 --> 00:42:03,645
怎么才能知道呢
Now, the way we going to find out

684
00:42:03,844 --> 00:42:07,533
在压井管上在做一次负压试验
is run that negative pressure test on the kill line.

685
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,398
如果压力是0，吉米先生
and if there is zero pressure Mr. Jimmy

686
00:42:10,563 --> 00:42:13,634
真相也就大白了
Then that is going to tell us all we need to know.

687
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:15,487
同意？
Are we in agreement?

688
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:18,982
同不同意不知道，不过再做一次试验也是无关痛痒
I don't know about agreement. Never hurts to run a test.

689
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:19,984
好滴(b＾*)))
Look.

690
00:42:20,185 --> 00:42:22,305
这儿情况如何，Jimmy先生
How we doing here, Mr. Jimmy?

691
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,026
不错，不是嘛，don
We're doing great aren't we Don?

692
00:42:26,028 --> 00:42:27,129
是的是的
Yes we are.

693
00:42:31,678 --> 00:42:33,284
公司的油井
BP's well.

694
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:38,691
是的
It is.

695
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:41,148
- 公司的石油 -恩
- Bp's oil. - Indeed.

696
00:42:41,713 --> 00:42:44,842
我们只是来雇佣的工人而已
We just to help you all hire a driller hole.

697
00:42:45,244 --> 00:42:47,224
说得对，吉米先生
You are correct, Mr. Jimmy.

698
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:51,276
但是我们已经延期50天，洞也没打好
But we 50 days late. And the hole ain't drilling.

699
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,015
吉米先生，厨房有点小问题
Now Mr. Jimmy, we have issue in the galley.

700
00:42:56,748 --> 00:43:00,355
一点安全问题 - 不会耽误你太久
- A whole bunch of people. A safety issue. - It won't take but a minute.

701
00:43:11,027 --> 00:43:14,069
是延迟43天，不是50天 简单的数学问题
That's are 43 days, not 50. Simple mathematics.

702
00:43:14,212 --> 00:43:18,089
既定目标是3月8号，今天4月20号，43天
Where your completion date was March 8. It's 20th April today. 43 days.

703
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,290
恩
Yep.

704
00:43:19,393 --> 00:43:22,582
我还以为你们这些就知道挣钱的油老板们数学应该不错
I thought you money greedy sons of bitch at least good at math.

705
00:43:22,883 --> 00:43:24,276
好吧，先生们
Allright, gentlemen.

706
00:43:24,677 --> 00:43:28,145
继续，杜威， 在压井管上进行负压试验
Oh hey, Dewey. Negative pressure test on the kill line.

707
00:43:28,346 --> 00:43:29,458
转移到压井管测试
Switching to kill line test.

708
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,184
开始压井管压力测试
Initiating kill line pressure test.

709
00:43:32,385 --> 00:43:33,385
膀胱效应？
Bladder effect.

710
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,807
你觉得靠谱吗？
It ran true to you?

711
00:43:36,308 --> 00:43:40,930
虽然丹 维德森这人满口谎言，不过我觉得还行
Well that came out of Vildrine's mouth that rang true to me. Yeah.

712
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:44,948
我是说，从原理上看
I mean on it's face, yeah.

713
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,976
还是有点道理的，不过呢
There's a logic to it. It's got merit. But

714
00:43:48,478 --> 00:43:51,713
我也说不清楚，对压井管做压力测试？
I don't apply to kill pipes and kill lines

715
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:55,159
- 有点太高深了，对我来说 -至少应该看到点泥浆
- A little above my paygrade. - We should've seen some mud.

716
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:21,780
压力警报
Pressure alert.

717
00:44:22,381 --> 00:44:25,018
压井管压力读数

718
00:44:39,526 --> 00:44:41,534
好！干得好！
Yes! Good job!

719
00:44:41,835 --> 00:44:45,650
地平线号将受到公司最高级别的安全表彰
The Deepwater Horizon is receiving BP's highest safety award.

720
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:47,247
连续7年
for the seventh straight year.

721
00:44:47,364 --> 00:44:51,933
一切都从吉米先生接手开始
And it all starts at the top. The man you call Mr. Jimmy

722
00:44:55,688 --> 00:44:56,900
吉米先生.吉米
Mr. Jimmy, Mr. Jimmy.

723
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:58,002
请致辞
Speech.

724
00:45:16,587 --> 00:45:19,994
保持在0，老板，测试通过了，没有残留压力
He held at zero, boss. Good test. No pressure.

725
00:45:20,296 --> 00:45:23,129
恭喜，通过测试了
Congratulations, good test.

726
00:45:23,331 --> 00:45:27,143
钻井管里还是很大的压力
We still got 14,000 psi on the drill line.

727
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:30,285
钻井管和压井管必须是相等的
Drill line and the kill line should be exactly the same.

728
00:45:30,473 --> 00:45:31,748
应该一模一样
They should all be lined up.

729
00:45:31,848 --> 00:45:34,645
我们已经知道钻井管里有点问题
We already agreed to test something wrong with the drill line.

730
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,243
为啥还在纠结这个
Why do you keep coming back to it?

731
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:38,023
我也不知道，这行干太多有经验了
I don't know. Good old field practice.

732
00:45:38,324 --> 00:45:42,329
没有泥浆，没有泥流，我们必须开始了
No mud. No flow. We got to go.

733
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:46,745
最快什么时候可以把井准备好
Now how quick can we lock the dough on this well?

734
00:45:47,347 --> 00:45:50,430
通知吉米先生之前我什么也不会做
I'm not doing nothing until Mr. Jimmy is made aware.

735
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,991
你还是个有主意的成年人么？
Is there a man in you? Is there an adult?

736
00:45:57,775 --> 00:46:03,279
穿的人模狗样，工作服一套，工作鞋一穿
The dip. The steel toes.

737
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,900
都他妈的扯淡
But it's all bullshit.

738
00:46:05,202 --> 00:46:08,410
压井管里完全没压力啊
We got zero pressure on the kill line.

739
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:10,859
胆小如鼠的货
You nervous as cat.

740
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,339
一点有担当的决定都不敢做
Afraid to make it work at every turns.

741
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:17,852
等我回去我就这么汇报给我上级
That will be my summary back to my bosses in London.

742
00:46:18,053 --> 00:46:19,054
鲍勃
Bob?

743
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:21,446
同意
Agreed.

744
00:46:23,082 --> 00:46:28,156
行吧，你通知吉米先生吧
Again, you can call Mr. Jimmy.

745
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:32,911
我就不耽误你们吃冰淇淋了，谢谢
And I no longer keep you from your ice cream for another second. Thanks.

746
00:46:34,494 --> 00:46:37,305
- 我是吉米 - 我做了负压试验
- This Mr. Jimmy. - We ended the negative test.

747
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:39,662
实验结果没问题，没压力
It was good test. We got no pressure.

748
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,367
准备开始下一步动作了，跟你确认一下
I'm about to start in this place. I want your blessing.

749
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:44,769
你确定吗，jason？
You sure about this, Jason?

750
00:46:45,171 --> 00:46:49,179
压井管测试正常，我能确定的只有这个
Kill line was good. It was all nothing I'm sure.

751
00:46:50,568 --> 00:46:53,624
他们在催我，我该怎么做？
This guys are all over me. What you want to do?

752
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:56,655
没泥流，对不？
Zero flow, correct?

753
00:46:56,756 --> 00:46:58,238
对，没泥流
It's correct. No flow.

754
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,463
可以继续了？
Are we good?

755
00:47:13,517 --> 00:47:15,691
好吧，又是慢慢长夜了估计
Well, it's looks like it's going to be a long night.

756
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,704
杰森，你先盯着，我半小时过去找你，谢谢
You stay on top of it, Jason. I see you on top about half an hour. Thanks.

757
00:47:24,817 --> 00:47:26,641
好吧，兄弟们，测试通过了
Okay, guys. Good test.

758
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:27,682
好耶！
Yahoo.

759
00:47:27,783 --> 00:47:30,129
准备加注10000桶泥浆
Get ready to pull out 10,000 barrels of mud.

760
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:34,111
夜班开始前我得去冲个澡
I think I'm going to take a shower and wash my day off before I start my night.

761
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:36,309
- 漫漫长夜，恩？ - 去吃点冰淇淋呗，麦克
- It's gonna be long night. - Get some ice cream, Mike.

762
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:37,770
我得保持体形
I'm gonna watch my figure.

763
00:47:37,972 --> 00:47:41,062
我去修几个烟雾报警器吧要不感觉我要打人了
I'll go fix up some smoke detectors before I'm about to pop somebody in the mouth.

764
00:47:41,263 --> 00:47:44,285
好主意，待我向felicia问好
That's a good idea. Say hi to Felicia for me.

765
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,287
- 吉米先生？ -恩？
- Mr. Jimmy? - Yes?

766
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:46,790
拿着
We really need you in this.

767
00:47:46,918 --> 00:47:48,980
- 拍张照 -哦，拍张照
- Just a picture.

768
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:50,070
吉米先生
Alright Mr. Jimmy.

769
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:53,146
- 恭喜你，jimmy先生1 - 谢谢兄弟们
Hey appreciate it a lot guys.

770
00:47:57,564 --> 00:47:58,960
你拍了吗？
Did you take the picture?

771
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:05,807
检查的怎么样了?
Help me check the house.

772
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:07,717
试验通过了
We got a good test.

773
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,760
开始转移泥浆，送到班克斯敦号那边去
We start sending us some mud. Transfer them to Bankston.

774
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:12,863
收到
Copy that.

775
00:48:13,464 --> 00:48:15,884
胆小如鼠 老鼠胆子才不小
Nervous as cat. Cat ain't scare.

776
00:48:16,086 --> 00:48:19,073
我以前见过老鼠对着猫唬呢
I had a cat named Oscar used to try to mount my Labrador.

777
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:20,751
打开环形防喷器
i'm opening the annular.

778
00:48:21,052 --> 00:48:23,184
希望这头野兽还没醒
Let's hope that monster ain't awake.

779
00:48:25,965 --> 00:48:27,308
泥浆泵正常工作
Mud pumps are on.

780
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,133
从油井里转移泥浆
Removing heavy mud from well.

781
00:48:29,335 --> 00:48:32,184
存储到2号泥浆仓
Displacement Holding in Tank 2.

782
00:48:32,386 --> 00:48:33,536
4%
Four percent ...

783
00:48:33,737 --> 00:48:35,344
同志们，测试通过了！
Boys we got a good test.

784
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:37,774
帅气！ 加注泥浆吧
Let's pump out all these mud.

785
00:48:44,646 --> 00:48:46,737

差不多35分钟
Sir, it's going to be 35 minutes.

1062
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:49,533
太迟了
Let's hope it's not 30 minutes too late.

1063
01:09:50,442 --> 01:09:53,675
这里是海岸警卫队，b17..

01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:48,041
我们必须离开这里到处都是火警
We gotta get out of here. There's methane everywhere.

1076
01:10:48,442 --> 01:10:51,150
我找到他的时候就这样，伤的很重但是我动不了他
I found him like this. He hurt real bad now. He ain't getting up.

1077
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:53,229
- 别看 - 别 别
- Don't look down alright? - No no.

1078
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:58,726
等一下，该死，你的骨头卡在缝隙里了
Wait! Shit, His bone caught on the metal.

1079
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:01,911
该死的
Dammit!

1080
01:11:09,412 --> 01:11:10,412
麦克

1081
01:11:11,012 --> 01:11:12,012
麦克

1082
01:11:12,043 --> 01:11:15,029
嘿，我们得想想办法，找点啥工具把它撬开
Come we gotta work this. We gotta find something to get it open.

1083
01:11:16,467 --> 01:11:18,465
拉！拉！
Pull! Pull!

1084
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:20,256
继续拉！
Keep pulling!

1085
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:27,881
没电了
I lost power.

1086
01:11:28,082 --> 01:11:30,571
先别动，给我点时间让我想想
Stop. Just stop a second. Let me think.

1087
01:11:40,516 --> 01:11:41,680
我要脱离那些管道
I want to cut the pipe.

1088
01:11:43,505 --> 01:11:45,950
嘿！ 安德莉亚，回到你座位上
Hey, Andrea, get your ass back on station.

1089
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:47,720
我们做不了这个决定
We don't have the authority.

1090
01:11:47,921 --> 01:11:49,022
得把油井封闭了
I'm going to seal the well.

1091
01:11:49,223 --> 01:11:50,711
别按那个按钮！
Do not touch that button!

1092
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,078
我们必须启动紧急脱离程序
We need to take the EDS.

1093
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:55,675
我们做不了这个决定！
We don't have the authority.

1094
01:11:58,485 --> 01:11:59,993
别按哦
You ain't pushing it.

1095
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:03,603
有人能帮帮忙吗？求你了
Can somebody help me?

1096
01:12:03,805 --> 01:12:05,438
离开这！
Go! Get out of here.

1097
01:12:05,639 --> 01:12:07,570
腿断了也得把你拽出来
You're coming with or without that leg.

1098
01:12:07,671 --> 01:12:08,958
保持住，保持住
Hold on. Hold on.

1099
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:09,860
嘿，看着我
Hey, look at me.

1100
01:12:10,061 --> 01:12:12,742
会疼的你妈妈都不认识你，要忍住！
This gonna hurt like a bitch. You stay calm for a second, okay.

1101
01:12:12,942 --> 01:12:14,668
看着我，别看下面，看着我
Look at me. Don't look down, look at me.

1102
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:16,457
有我们在
We got you.

1103
01:12:16,558 --> 01:12:17,558
保持住！
Hold on.

1104
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,629
拉 拉
Pull. Pull.

1105
01:12:20,931 --> 01:12:22,361
维姆，你还能动吗？
Wyman, can you move?

1106
01:12:22,462 --> 01:12:23,464
我们走！
Let's go.

1107
01:12:24,917 --> 01:12:26,860
带我去舰桥，麦克
Okay, take me to the bridge, Mike.

1108
01:12:36,272 --> 01:12:37,872
海岸警卫队，这是degan
Coast Guard. This is Command Center. Lieutenant Degan speaking.

1109

1111
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:49,826
但是我老公，麦克 威廉姆斯，他在地平线号上
but my husband. Mike Williams, is on the Deepwater Horizon and uh

1112
01:12:49,928 --> 01:12:54,596
是的，女士，我们接到通知平台上发生了火灾事故，目前为止我也就知道这些
Yes, ma'am. Right now we only have a couple of confirmed reports
with a fire on an oil rig. That's all I can say.

1113
01:12:54,898 --> 01:12:57,551
平台上起火了？
They're on the Deepwater Horizon?

1114
01:12:57,852 --> 01:13:00,154
那么多平台在那，你确定吗？
Because there's so many rigs out there. You sure?

01:13:00,273 --> 01:13:02,392
是的，深水地平线号上发生了火灾
Yes, there is a fire on the Deepwater Horizon.

1116
01:13:02,593 --> 01:13:05,056
目前只有这些信息，不好意思，我得挂电话了
That's all I can say to you, Ma'am. Sorry. I really have to go.

1117
01:14:03,892 --> 01:14:05,106
发生了什么？
What happened?

1118
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:16,502
- 肯，没事吧？ - 那座塔会砸到我们的！
- Ken, you alright? - The derrick is gonna fall on us!

1119
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,032
船要走了！
Damn, the boat slipped.

1120
01:14:21,209 --> 01:14:23,267
我的起重机会毁掉那座塔的
My crane is gonna take the goddamn derrick out.

1121
01:14:23,368 --> 01:14:25,217
- 下来 - 快上船！
- It's coming down! - Get on the boat now!

1122
01:14:25,318 --> 01:14:27,615
我得把它停下，否则我们都得死

1123
01:14:44,539 --> 01:14:45,759

01:16:16,354 --> 01:16:18,476
我们走吧，船已经满了，我们出发
Let's move on! It is full! Let's move on!

1134

去第一个汇合点
They Go to the meeting point one!

1135
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:30,582
滚上救生艇吧你
Get your ass on the lifeboat.

1136
01:16:36,656 --> 01:16:40,516
安德莉亚，库赫塔，管道脱离了吗？
Andrea, Kuchta, did disconnected it?

1137
01:16:40,717 --> 01:16:41,717
没有
No.

1138
01:16:41,819 --> 01:16:44,559
安德莉亚，把我的手放到紧急脱离系统上
Andrea, get my hands on the EDS.

1139
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,331
我来切断管道，封闭油井
I'm gonna cut the pipe and seal this well.

1140
01:16:47,532 --> 01:16:49,039
得把火的源头切断
We gonna choke this fire.

1141
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,071
- 这儿 - 上面一点
- Right here. - No, no, up, up!

1142
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:53,238
上帝保佑
It works.

1143
01:17:02,163 --> 01:17:03,603
还在烧吗？
Still burning?

- 石油还在喷出，jimmy先生 - 千万别啊，别！
- It still flow, Mr. Jimmy. - Oh come on. Please! Please!

我们得回复这里的动力

- 得让备用发电机上线工作 - 为了救火？
- We need to press the standby generator online. - The fire fighting pump?

1151
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:37,495
不是，我们得尽量保持平台的位置，否则管道会被扯断的
No, we just want to keep this rig on station as long as we can. So that pipe doesn't break.

1152
01:17:37,596 --> 01:17:41,045
- 我们也只能做这些了，平台是废了 - 好吧，试试总没错
- That's all we can do. We can't save this rig. -  It can't hurt to go try.

1153
01:17:41,246 --> 01:17:44,326
好吧，麦克，它在塔台的另外一边
Thank you very much Mike. It's on the other side of that derrick.

1154

走吧
Come on.

那座平台仍在火灾中，还有东西在燃烧
To our knowledge, the platform is on fire. Something is on fire there.

1160
01:18:00,979 --> 01:18:04,042

我们的老公在地平线号上一起工作
Our husbands work on the Deepwater Horizon together.

1164
01:18:13,976 --> 01:18:17,015
我给海岸警卫队打电话确认平台上起火了
I just called the Coast Guard and they can just confirmed that there is a fire ...

1165
01:18:17,216 --> 01:18:19,507
我想知道你有啥新消息吗？

1166
01:18:19,709 --> 01:18:21,111
海岸警卫队怎么说？

01:18:35,834 --> 01:18:36,979
等会再说，宝贝
Not now, babe.

麦克，你在那吗？

麦克？ 恢复动力啊

1186
01:19:50,627 --> 01:19:51,628
你知道这玩意咋操作吗？
You know your way around this thing?

1187
01:19:51,729 --> 01:19:53,232
不，能难到哪去呢

1188
01:19:53,433 --> 01:19:54,983
来，读给我听
