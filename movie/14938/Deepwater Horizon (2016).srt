00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,026
<i>Can I have everyone's attention?</i>

3
00:00:07,265 --> 00:00:09,643
<i>Mr. Williams, please rise.</i>

4
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:12,152
<i>Please raise your right hand, Sir.</i>

5
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:16,237
<i>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you are about to give is the truth,</i>

6
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:19,646
<i>the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?</i>

7
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:23,617
<i>- Yes, Sir.
- Thank you, Sir, please be seated.</i>

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,916
<i>Mr. Williams, can you please give us your best
recollection of the event on the Deepwater Horizon?</i>

9
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:37,600
<i>I was on the phone around
9:30 with my wife.</i>

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,828
<i>That's when I heard the hissing noise.</i>

11
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:44,409
<i>I heard the engines start to rev.</i>

12
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:47,307
<i>The hissing turned into a full-blown roar,</i>

13
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:49,516
<i>higher than I can even describe it,</i>

14
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:53,077
<i>and within seconds there
was a huge explosion,</i>

15
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:55,718
<i>projectiles coming from everywhere.</i>

16
00:00:55,768 --> 00:00:58,865
<i>The heat was overwhelming.</i>

17
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:05,317
<i>Can you please explain to me how the
Deepwater Horizon's alarm system is set up?</i>

18
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:08,880
<i>The general alarm is set
up to inform the entire rig</i>

19
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,487
<i>of number one: Fire; Number
two: Combustible gas;</i>

20
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:14,218
<i>Three: Toxic gas.</i>

21
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:19,721
<i>Each condition has a distinct tone
Siren and a distinct visual light.</i>

22
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,634
<i>On the evening of April 20th</i>

23
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:24,983
<i>did you hear any one of those
alarms on the Deepwater Horizon?</i>

24
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:27,332
<i>No, Sir.</i>

25
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:30,930
<i>Do you know why you never
heard the alarm, Sir?</i>

26
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:34,994
<i>Mr. Williams?</i>

27
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:37,074
<i>Mr. Williams!</i>

28
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:19,459
<i>Passing through 3,000 feet.</i>

29
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,664
<i>Continuing down.</i>

30
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:36,651
And stick to the north side.

31
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:39,706
Scan on it.

32
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:16,979
<i>Minor corrosion, not much more than
I'd expect on a weld of this age.</i>

33
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:05,069
I just had the craziest dream.

34
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:08,523
Oh, wow, was I in it?

35
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:12,053
I was... No. I was at a concert...

36
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:16,918
and then on the side of the
stage there was this...

37
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:19,371
like, a two legged rabbit.

38
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:21,587
I don't know what part in that I play.

39
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,409
Listen to me.

40
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:25,897
Listen.

41
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:28,402
I would move...

42
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:32,181
and then it would mimic
everything I was doing.

43
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:36,320
Don't tell me anymore because
I know where this is going.

44
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,293
- I think the rabbit was my mother.
- Mother, yes, I know.

45
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:43,968
Thank you, now it's my nightmare,
thank you.

46
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,975
- It was hostile.
- Okay.

47
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:49,895
- A hostile rabbit.
- Okay, I got it.

48
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:52,634
I'm sorry, what are you doin'?

49
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:56,640
That's it? That's how you're gonna
leave me for 21 days and nights?

50
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,234
I'm letting you get your sleep.

51
00:04:58,284 --> 00:05:02,019
Well, I need... I need other
things besides sleep.

52
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,869
You need to promise not to
bring up your mother, then.

53
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,442
Huh?

54
00:05:07,492 --> 00:05:10,442
You want the 30?

55
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:11,826
The 60?

56
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:14,122
Or the 90 second love package?

57
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:16,682
I'm gonna take the whole 90.

58
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:21,925
The pressure, the pressure,
the pressure, the pressure!

59
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:24,549
And I'd miss that laugh.

60
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,345
- I'd miss that mouth.
- What mouth?

61
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,706
Give me those eyes.

62
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:54,263
Love you.

63
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:10,334
This is not our deal.

64
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:24,074
All right! All right!

65
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:34,316
<i>You consistently overestimate
your skills as a mechanic.</i>

66
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:37,398
What was that?

67
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:38,746
Let's go baby.

68
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:40,494
Let me drive.

69
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:45,006
- Let me drive.
- Nope.

70
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:47,001
Pretty please?

71
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:48,776
- You really want to drive?
- Yeah.

72
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:52,544
Then sell that piece of
shit and get a Ducati.

73
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:07,718
<i>Wow! A bull in a china shop.</i>

74
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,727
I only did not knock
because I want a brother.

75
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:17,887
Okay, well, that's disturbing.

76
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:22,017
<i>Because you're not supposed to know anything about
that, you're supposed to</i> just think babies are cute.

77
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,475
- Loud!
- Will you sit down, please.

78
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:25,169
I really want a brother.

79
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,190
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

80
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,432
- Honey, show Daddy.
- I'm not done.

81
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,308
<i>- You did such a good job.
- It's show time.</i>

82
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:33,635
<i>It's really great.</i>

83
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:35,161
You can't look at me.

84
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:37,373
- Why?
- 'Cause it makes me uncomfortable.

85
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,113
- My lookin' at you makes you uncomfortable?
- Stop!

86
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:41,675
- All right.
- My dad is Mike.

87
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:45,651
He works on a drilling rig that pumps
oil out from underneath the ocean.

88
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:49,445
No, no, the Deepwater doesn't pump a drop
of oil, okay, Baby, we're the explorers.

89
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:51,887
So, my dad and his friends find the oil

90
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:55,349
and then put in all the plumbing so
other lamer crews can come in...

91
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,082
- Don't say "Lamer"
- They are lamer.

92
00:07:57,132 --> 00:08:00,675
But listen, even those lamer dudes,
they don't have to pump anything, remember?

93
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:02,630
Because oil wants to come rushing up...

94
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:06,641
Because that oil is a monster.

95
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:09,987
Like the mean,
old dinosaurs all that oil used to be.

96
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:12,430
So, for 300 million years

97
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,808
these old dinosaurs have been getting pretty
tighter, and tighter, and tighter, and tighter...

98
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:19,244
We get it, we get it,
just do two "tighters".

99
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:22,484
Because they have miles of earth
and ocean pressing down on them...

100
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,693
They are trapped.

101
00:08:24,743 --> 00:08:29,061
Then Dad and his friends
make a hole in their roof.

102
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:30,566
<i>Yeah!</i>

103
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:32,939
And these mean,
old dinosaurs can't believe it.

104
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:35,881
So they rush to the new hole, then SMACK!

105
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,732
They run into a big machine
that he and his friends...

106
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:41,075
have down on the ocean
floor called a...

107
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,761
- Big guy preventer?
- Blowout preventer.

108
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:46,440
They run into this stuff called "mud"...

109
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,186
- All right, get it in there.
- And they cram down the straw.

110
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:52,577
The mud's so thick and heavy it
blocks the monsters from coming up.

111
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:54,798
And then they sail away to the next.

112
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,148
That's when all the lamos show up
happy like they did something.

113
00:08:58,198 --> 00:08:59,292
Don't say "Lamo".

114
00:08:59,342 --> 00:09:02,216
But it was my Daddy who
tamed the dinosaurs.

115
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:04,629
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

116
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,802
That was amazing,
stay forever 10 years, please.

117
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:08,255
Daddy, you need to get me a fossil.

118
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:09,762
- Oh, yeah.
- I will.

119
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:15,392
I want to be able to hold it up and say,
"My Daddy tamed the dinosaurs".

120
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:17,088
Tell Daddy what Maggie's dad did.

121
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:21,151
Her dad works at the zoo,
and he brought a really penguin.

122
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:22,631
He can't do that!

123
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:25,218
- He brought in a penguin.
- How do you compete with a penguin?

124
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:29,250
<i>- You get a fossil.</i>
- There should be rules!

125
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:31,795
Oh my gosh!

126
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:33,078
What?

127
00:09:33,128 --> 00:09:38,786
<i>Stop it!</i>

128
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,325
Buy gas, go to work...

129
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,408
buy gas, go back to work...

130
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,133
<i>to buy more gas to GET to work.</i>

131
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:16,501
Do you know the passwords, right, for the
insurance companies? Where is the safe?

132
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:18,671
- To call Schuman first?
- What are you talking about?

133
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:20,093
I just...

134
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:24,617
- When were you...
- I got a little spooked on the Goman last hit, it's just not...

135
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:25,394
Give me some of that.

136
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:29,511
Babe, the only time you start worrying
about a Marine is when he stops bitching.

137
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:32,241
- Don't use my lines against me.
- I'm using your lines against you.

138
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,455
- Don't use my lines!
- I just did.

139
00:11:10,122 --> 00:11:13,438
- All right, Bread.
- All right, Fish.

140
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:16,656
- I love you.
- I love you.

141
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:19,279
- See you in three weeks.
- Right, three weeks..

142
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:22,421
Behave.

143
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:24,808
<i>Next!</i>

144
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:27,256
- Good morning, Mr. Jimmy.
- How we doin', Sarah?

145
00:11:27,306 --> 00:11:28,770
- Good, how are you?
- I'm good.

146
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,724
<i>Place your bags on the baggage scale
and step on the feet.</i>

147
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,440
- Where you headed today?
- Same place, Deepwater Horizon.

148
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:36,420
- Where you flyin' off to?
- Deepwater Horizon.

149
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,418
- And who do you work for?
- Transocean.

150
00:11:38,468 --> 00:11:40,549
- You wanna know how much you weigh?
- You know I do.

151
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,997
- 181.
- What did I tell you?

152
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:44,585
- Yeah, you did good, keep it that way.
- All right.

153
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:47,755
All right, have a seat in the lobby and
we'll call you when your flights ready.

154
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,966
- Thank you.
- Mr. Sims? Mr. O'Bryan?

155
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:50,798
David Sims.

156
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:53,735
Jimmy Harrell, officer
installation manager on Deepwater.

157
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:56,404
Palani, thank you very much
for taking us out today,

158
00:11:56,454 --> 00:11:59,071
I know you guys are swamped
and you didn't have to.

159
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:00,374
Well, I had to.

160
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:02,606
Listen, do you mind losin' that tie?

161
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,315
I would.

162
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:07,096
It's not the tie, it's the color.

163
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:08,638
Purple?

164
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:11,167
More magenta.

165
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:12,465
And?

166
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:16,760
Well, magenta alarm on an
oil rig is as bad as it gets.

167
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,314
As worthy of superstitions.

168
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,187
- Mornin'.
- Mike Williams.

169
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:25,905
- Where you headed today?
- Deepwater Horizon.

170
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:43,922
What do you do on your down time?

171
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:47,135
- I started workin' on that air boat again.
- Yeah?

172
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:51,327
I'm upin' it to 600
horsepower to 1200 horsepower.

173
00:12:51,377 --> 00:12:55,249
And I got me a little Sensenich
prop offset supercut.

174
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,727
- You tryin' to make it fly?
- No, I just wanna make it go faster.

175
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,789
<i>- Loud and clear.</i>
- Roger, go everyone.

176
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,410
Boscow, I got the Deepwater
Horizon coordinates in the F.M.S.

177
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,399
<i>492, your tower's clear, wind is calm.</i>

178
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,252
<i>Paris Control, this is
Bristow Two Bravo Gulf,</i>

179
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:44,995
<i>we're headed out into open ocean.</i>

180
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:48,207
<i>E.T.A. 45 minutes to Deepwater Horizon.</i>

181
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:50,876
Roger that, Bristow Two Bravo Gulf.

182
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:53,478
What is it you do at B.P., Mr. Sims?

183
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:56,380
- Competition.
- Oh, shit, here we go, Jimmy.

184
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,927
Well, you know, we... we a little behind.

185
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:02,946
Forty-three days, but
who's counting, right?

186
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:11,153
- What were you gonna do with your bonus, Mike?
- Dig a pool.

187
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,594
- You?
- Fix my car.

188
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,755
You know the first well collapsed on her,

189
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:17,769
took us five days just to pull
a million dollar drill pipe out?

190
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,268
- Whose fault was that?
- Whatchya drivin'?

191
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,758
- '69 Mustang.
- Fastback?

192
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:23,269
- Vinyl top.
- What's up with it?

193
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:26,705
Today it was a rough idle, made the exhaust
smell like gas right out of the pump.

194
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:30,682
- Do you smell gas when it's not runnin'?
- No, so it's not a leak in the tank.

195
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:33,237
Shit!

196
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:37,858
That was a bird strike, folks.

197
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:45,860
I didn't say nothin'.

198
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,907
<i>Deepwater Horizon is only a mile now.</i>

199
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:52,447
<i>We should be fine to land.
We'll run a safety check then.</i>

200
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,640
Anything that big oughta be made by God.

201
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,125
That's beautiful.

202
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:00,812
You know it's not on stilts?
It's not jacked up.

203
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:04,112
Yeah, I do, and I still can't
believe that thing's a boat.

204
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:09,322
<i>Well, you can thank this very talented
young lady right back here for that.</i>

205
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,297
What the hell is the Bankston doin' here?

206
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:19,716
Who gave that order?

207
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:24,825
Standby Bravo Gulf, permission
to land Deepwater Horizon.

208
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,715
Welcome aboard!

209
00:16:05,783 --> 00:16:07,577
You guys already done?

210
00:16:07,627 --> 00:16:09,537
I don't know what to tell you, Mr. Jimmy.

211
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:11,707
- You guys finished?
- I don't know what to tell ya.

212
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:16,175
- Someone's gotta talk to Vidrine.
- What? Are you finished?

213
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,851
- Hey, Skip.
- Yes Sir.

214
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:22,542
- Team is leaving?
- Yes, Schlumberger down, they're gone.

215
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,961
Skip, are we done here?

216
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:35,251
- You gotta talk to Vidrine.
- Vidrine?

217
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:38,863
- What did he say?
- I can't hear him.

218
00:16:50,534 --> 00:16:52,217
What did Mr. Skip said?

219
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:55,255
Stay with the boat and see
if the cement is holding.

220
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,990
I guess they left without doing it.

221
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,041
What?

222
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:02,088
- BP says to send the guys home.
- Seriously?

223
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:04,639
Yep.

224
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:11,697
Kuchta, why is the Bankston here?

225
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:14,590
- Good day to you, too.
- What is the Bankston doin' here?

226
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,248
Good morning, Pete.

227
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:17,714
Happy to see me?

228
00:17:17,764 --> 00:17:19,552
I'm always happy to see you, Andrea.

229
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:21,892
Where's the restroom, Williams?

230
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:23,259
The sign that says "toilet".

231
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,054
- Skip saying anything about doin' a cement log?
- He didn't tell me.

232
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,743
Did we win the war here and I'm
just now findin' out about it?

233
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:30,497
Because I sure as hell don't
know how they'd have the

234
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:33,458
time to do the cement test,
because they're flyin' away.

235
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:36,427
- Hey, Jimmy, I just drive the boat, man.
- How did the positive test go?

236
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:38,468
Well, we're in the breakdown mode.

237
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:39,878
- Breakdown mode?
- How we looking?

238
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:42,699
Sittin' at 166, winds are
at 185 at around 5 knots.

239
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:45,255
<i>Seas are calm, that's good.</i>

240
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,819
<i>Holding grade of our watch,
echo sittin' right on top.</i>

241
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:57,008
You still datin' that itty-bitty
guy with the motorcycle?

242
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:59,000
- Any issues with the ???
<i>- Andrea.</i>

243
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,802
Yes Sir?

244
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:04,609
<i>Get on the radio to Captain Landry</i> on the
Bankston and see what he's doin' and why.

245
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:06,043
Aye. Aye, Mr. Jimmy.

246
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:10,878
Damon Bankston this is
Deepwater Horizon, over.

247
00:18:10,998 --> 00:18:13,829
<i>Deepwater Horizon, this
Damon Bankston, go ahead.</i>

248
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:15,931
The O.I.M. wants to know
what you're doin' here.

249
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:20,041
I hear we're gettin' off this
beast and movin' onto the next.

250
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:23,225
<i>You can call her "beast".
When is your boat leavin'?</i>

251
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:26,569
<i>Well, I'm told to be ready to start
takin' on drilling mud at about 18 hundred.</i>

252
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,190
Wow.

253
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,444
<i>I heard you have a positive
pressure test this mornin'.</i>

254
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:33,351
I guess they assume that the
negative test is gonna run just as smooth.

255
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:36,121
- They told me to get ready to start movin' on.
- Who's "they"?

256
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:39,993
<i>BP company man.</i>
Vidrine, Kaluza,<i> I don't know.</i>

257
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:43,604
<i>I wait for the order and come pick
up your mud. Any other question?</i>

258
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:45,355
<i>Nope, that's it.</i>

259
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:50,978
So, BP comes in here, Vidrine and/or Kaluza
are hoping that we have tamed this bitch

260
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:55,265
and are ready to? Drilling mud 18
hundred hours, is that correct, Captain?

261
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:57,560
That is correct...
good morning, Mr. Jimmy.

262
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,694
All of a sudden, just like that?

263
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:03,447
<i>Thank you, Captain.</i>

264
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:07,399
Damn! The god damn phones
still don't work, Mike.

265
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:09,021
Hey, I flew in with you, Mr. Jimmy.

266
00:19:09,071 --> 00:19:11,420
Do me a favor,
run down to the drill shack,

267
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,389
ask Jason if those Schlumberger guys did
their job; Did they run the cement log.

268
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,922
Roger that.

269
00:19:17,972 --> 00:19:18,824
<i>Thank you.</i>

270
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:24,964
Gentlemen, you couldn't perhaps enlighten
me on this cement log situation, could ya?

271
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:26,186
Cement log?

272
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:30,023
<i>Do you know if they're
plannin' it? Runnin' it? Did it?</i>

273
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:32,097
Yeah.

274
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:33,906
Not really... hey, Ronnie.

275
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:35,907
Might be a missing
problem with your Mustang.

276
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,161
I'm thinkin' fouled plugs.

277
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,479
It could be a wire, could
be the distributor.

278
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,526
- Does is sounds like it's skippin'?
- Nope.

279
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:44,376
You know what I'm gonna do for ya,
young lady,

280
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:47,057
I'm gonna keep thinking about all these expensive
things that could be wrong with your ride. Damaged.

281
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:48,804
- Gee, thanks.
- Hey.

282
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,374
<i>Stick shift of automatic?</i>

283
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:51,473
Do you know me?

284
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:54,046
Oh, we gonna stops grindin' shit
oughta that clutch, I know that.

285
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,901
- Oh, yeah, Mr. Toyota.
- Uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh.

286
00:19:56,951 --> 00:20:01,523
<i>Code red, code red.</i>

287
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,659
Come movin', baby, come
movin', baby, c'mon.

288
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,910
<i>Release 400 barrels of mud.</i>

289
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,599
<i>Roger that, beginning actuation.</i>

290
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,228
Shut up.

291
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,068
Hey! Duck!

00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:43,934
What's up, Mike?

293
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:47,456
- How you doin', Caleb?
- Hey, Mike, how ya doin, man?

294
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:49,386
- A lot better a coupla hours ago.
- Why's that?

295
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:50,748
I was asleep.

296
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:51,651
Yeah?

297
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:54,303
Yeah, we all got woken
up, they got us work over.

298
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,033
We got a lot of pipe to pull if we're
gonna get out of here tonight.

299
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:58,405
Street clothes? You look pretty.

300
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:02,097
Oh, man, listen, Jimmy's pissed and
what's more, we gotta cement log test.

301
00:21:02,147 --> 00:21:03,732
I'm not sure, I don't think so.

302
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:05,473
- No? Hey, Shane!
- Yeah?

303
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:08,552
Come here, boy, Schlumberger
run a cement log test?

304
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:11,042
I don't know, I don't think they
did it, I just woke up, so...

305
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:14,070
- Is that stupid?
- I don't know if it's stupid, but...

306
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,571
but it ain't smart.

307
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:16,680
- But it ain't smart.
- But it ain't smart.

308
00:21:16,704 --> 00:21:18,643
Look at you guys, like
synchronized swimmers.

309
00:21:18,796 --> 00:21:21,264
I think you think too much,
you gonna give him a headache.

310
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,314
I understand that.

311
00:21:28,928 --> 00:21:31,514
- Hey, fellas.
- What the hell are you wearin'?

312
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:34,598
Mr. Jimmy wants to know if you've
seen the Schlumburger cement bond tests.

313
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:35,083
The what?

314
00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:37,626
The cement job, test the cement job,
c'mon, man, work with me.

315
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:39,396
- Whose that again?
- Ah, cut the shit, man!

316
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,814
- C'mon, Jimmy's pissed, man.
- Schlumburger, you democrat.

317
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:45,627
- Well, did we run the test?
- No, Vidrine flew the... Home without testing anything.

318
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:46,918
Well, why in the hell would they do that?

319
00:21:46,943 --> 00:21:49,503
They never feel the urge to take
me through their thinkin', Mike.

320
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:54,154
But I assume it's got somethin' to do
with... money, money, money, money.

321
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,218
Money.

322
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,991
Your phones are broken.

323
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,538
- Hey, Mr. Jimmy.
<I>- Go ahead.</i>

324
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:06,224
That BP sent Schlumberger team home
without runnin' any tests.

325
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,083
Thank you, Mike.

326
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,396
Mike, A? Just crashed.

327
00:22:13,987 --> 00:22:18,023
- Blue screen of death... again.
- Hey, Duck, is your? Still up?

328
00:22:18,074 --> 00:22:21,760
My computer screen is shaky,
and the smoke detector's out.

329
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:24,430
How you doin', Mike? Shit.

330
00:22:24,554 --> 00:22:28,914
- I'm doublin' back to grab my tools, I'll be to fix it.
- Doin' it all with Band-Aids and bubble gum, my man.

331
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:33,818
Every time I peel off a Band-Aid on this rig I find 3
or 4 more... spit and glue ain’t gettin' it done.

332
00:22:33,862 --> 00:22:37,564
One more time with the "money"... c'mon,
c'mon, you been rehearsin' for weeks.

333
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:40,523
- No, no, the good part, man.
- It is the good part.

334
00:22:45,771 --> 00:22:47,988
Hi, Hollywood!

335
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:55,326
- Mike!
- Mornin', Dale?

336
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:58,244
- Let me know when you're done.
- Not much, could be.

337
00:22:58,312 --> 00:23:00,666
He ain't goin' fishin' tonight.
A hundred dollars.

338
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,610
I got a feeling we're gettin' off this well tonight,
I don't see nobody could be doin' no fishin'.

339
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,544
You gonna use your crane, man,
maybe catch a Beluga or a Shamu?

340
00:23:07,712 --> 00:23:10,089
Good idea... shit.

341
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:12,840
Wanna make a bet we're here
on the same spot next shift?

342
00:23:13,048 --> 00:23:14,501
- Yeah, give me odds?
- Three to one.

343
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:15,815
Ah, shit.

344
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:19,473
- I ain't touchin' that.
- Three to one, same spot.

345
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:23,348
- No way.
- Mike Williams, you piece of shit.!

346
00:24:08,426 --> 00:24:10,552
- Patrick.
- So what, Mike?

347
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,324
- I heard we're done.
- You heard we were done?

348
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:13,974
- Yeah, I heard we're done.
- Well, who did you hear that from?

349
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:16,447
- I can't tell you 'bout that, Mike.
- What do you mean you can't tell me 'bout it?

350
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,097
I can't tell you 'bout it.

351
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:20,296
I just can't tell you, but I can tell
you that Gordon is looking for ya.

352
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:22,700
- Did Gordon tell you what was up?
- Naw, he didn't tell me that.

353
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,029
- Well, what is goin' on?
- I don't know, he's got somethin' to show ya.

354
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,953
- What DO you know?
- I know we're done.

355
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:30,089
- Were you in the shop?
- No.

356
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:32,426
- Don't touch my shit.
- I wasn't touchin' your shit.

357
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:35,076
- All right, go fix somethin'!
- All right, have a wonderful time.

358
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,473
- Have a good day, Mike.
- Yeah, you too... shit.

359
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,839
<I>...Baby, hold on.
What did you say?</i>

360
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:47,665
Great news: The chopper didn't crash.

361
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:52,124
<I>I assumed and then I reneged.
Oh, yeah, he rich?</i>

362
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:56,211
Remember what your mama always said:
"Just as easily to marry a rich man..."

363
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:59,590
<i>If I had a nickel for the
dumb shit for my mom's?</i>

364
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:02,198
<i>I wouldn't need a rich man.
You better fix this, by the way.</i>

365
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,809
I'm gonna fix it just as soon
as I get home, don't worry.

366
00:25:06,942 --> 00:25:08,262
Hey, come closer to the computer.

367
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:10,390
Come over to the computer.

368
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:13,641
<I>- Look at those eyes.
- How is it out there?</i>

369
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:15,290
Same shit, well from hell.

370
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:17,544
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

371
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:20,021
<I>- Three.
- Two.</i>

372
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,023
<I>- One.
- Go!</i>

373
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:28,820
<I>... sociopath.</i>

374
00:25:28,988 --> 00:25:33,448
That is focus, that is determination,
that is intensity... drive.

375
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:40,621
I hate it.

376
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,248
<I>See you soon, okay?
All right, see ya.</i>

377
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:51,146
touchin' my shit! This is my shit!
My shit!

378
00:25:52,206 --> 00:25:55,841
- Ken said he didn't want to say it's our next location.
- Kaskida.

379
00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:00,245
Was this run by anybody at BP?
Kaluza, Vidrine, anybody?

380
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:03,201
Vidrine right about me, he's...
this comes from Vidrine.

381
00:26:05,388 --> 00:26:08,559
Bob, let me impose upon you what
I think is most important here.

382
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:12,925
We need to go from Macondo
to Kaskida on May 16.

383
00:26:12,975 --> 00:26:15,272
Kaskida is an uncommon prospect,

384
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,067
three to four billion barrels,
that's worth more than BP itself.

385
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:21,653
Do I look like fuckin' Santa Claus?

386
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,446
You DO look a little like Santa Claus.

387
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:28,658
Couch Miles may have played in Michigan,
but that boy got Louisiana soul.

388
00:26:28,826 --> 00:26:31,408
- Saban?
- We win, we win.

389
00:26:31,577 --> 00:26:33,870
"We"?<i>Like you went to 'Bama?</i>

390
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:37,705
<i>When I was potty trained, I was about to
flush,</i> wave and say, "See you in Tuscaloosa."

391
00:26:37,773 --> 00:26:40,302
Hey, you boys workin' for the Company?
Clean the Clean room!

392
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:42,545
We're still findin' mud from the last kick.

393
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:45,631
Over 5,000 psi, grab a mop!

394
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:50,354
- This is crazy.
- Look what the pressure did to drill? During the kick.

395
00:26:50,883 --> 00:26:54,846
That's one for the trophy case.
Hey, Patrick said you got something for me.

396
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:59,974
Yes, Sir, station 4 broke down...

397
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:03,517
<i>and I finally found the source
of the problem, check this out.</i>

398
00:27:03,685 --> 00:27:06,271
I've been hidin' this for
you since the last kick.

399
00:27:08,021 --> 00:27:09,858
Is that a tooth?

400
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:13,569
My little girl's ear.

401
00:27:13,693 --> 00:27:16,695
And her old man, thank you, I owe you, man.

402
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:31,655
- They sent them home.
- Yeah.

403
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:36,088
Walk with me, Mike.

404
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:38,752
- Where we headed.
- To murder some BP Company men.

405
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,007
Shit, I got hammers, screwdrivers.

406
00:27:43,256 --> 00:27:46,927
- Say, Mike, you brush your teeth this morning?
- Why yes, Sir.

407
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:51,014
- Did you floss?
- No, no, why?

408
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:54,973
Saves you a lot of pain and
money in the long run, I'll tell ya.

409
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,603
Shit! Jimmy's... BP guy.

410
00:27:57,727 --> 00:28:01,378
Sent them home... doin' shit...
now we're goin' after BP.

411
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:05,649
What's that matter? Well, you owe 'em a
lot of money? C'mon, Mike, stay on my hip!

412
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:09,904
Yeah, baby.

413
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:14,488
Line 51, you don't
see any cost variances.

414
00:28:14,656 --> 00:28:17,574
Well if it isn't Don Vidrine
and Bob Kaluza.

415
00:28:17,742 --> 00:28:20,284
Welcome back, Mr. Jimmy.

416
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:24,356
So, we got all of 500 feet
of cement poured, huh?

417
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:28,126
That cement's the only thing
between us and a blowout.

418
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:31,713
And it's cured.
It is... had enough time.

419
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,807
It takes time to do it right.

420
00:28:33,863 --> 00:28:38,634
I mean, that cement job is
compromised and everything above it is...

421
00:28:38,658 --> 00:28:43,470
- It's not compromised, Houston doesn't have a problem.
- So I assume the Schlumberger guys said the same.

422
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,432
Cement bond log they ran
said the same, yeah?

423
00:28:46,596 --> 00:28:50,475
We are confident in the integrity
of our cement job,<i> are we not?</i>

424
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:54,096
Oh, we're quite comfortable with the
integrity of cement effort... true.

425
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,678
- Just like my grand-dad.
- Pardon?

426
00:28:58,924 --> 00:29:04,159
Ya see, my grand-daddy he... he never even went to the
dentist, 'cause he didn't want to know all what was wrong,

427
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,729
<i>'Cause then he'd have to deal with it.</i>

428
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,449
You don't want to know if that
cement job on this well is shit,

429
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,908
'cause you're 43 days and
50 million over budget.

430
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:16,872
- You really should include yourself in that Mr. Jimmy.
- BP picked this spot to drill, Bob.

431
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:19,134
Consequences of that are on you guys...
'course

432
00:29:19,184 --> 00:29:22,332
I gotta try to deal with those
consequences, so, yeah, I'm included.

433
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,087
The point is, you sent the testing
team home before they could do their job,

434
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:31,423
maybe give y'all some news y'all did wrong here. What
would it've cost ya to run that test, 125 grand?

435
00:29:32,468 --> 00:29:34,860
You're a 180 billion dollar
company and you cheat.

436
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:40,222
That's why we're 186 billion dollar
company, we worry about those bills.

437
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,600
I worry about my rig,
my crew lives on it.

438
00:29:43,768 --> 00:29:48,450
You just rent it, Don, you and I both know
we need some down time for maintenance.

439
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,494
- Mike, how many of our machines need repair?
- 390 Mr. Jimmy.

440
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:56,110
- Three hundred ninety?
- Yes, Sir, all of 10 percent of all the machinery aboard.

441
00:29:56,218 --> 00:29:58,736
- Name a few for me.
<i>- A few?</i>

442
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,822
I would love to know exactly what piece
of mission critical equipment on down.

443
00:30:03,872 --> 00:30:05,573
Shit, where do I start?

444
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:10,369
"A" drill chair, process station 18, BOP control
pods, telephone systems, hyperactive systems,

445
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:12,618
GPS antenna, direct TV system,
wireless internet,

446
00:30:12,668 --> 00:30:15,833
iron roughneck, top drive ratback system,
auxiliary draw worse controls

447
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:18,459
salt water service pumps,
smoke alarms in the galley.

448
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:22,427
And the reason you're sweatin' so hard, it's because
of the pressure of the A.T.I. is down, too.

449
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:27,927
- Everything but the toilets, huh?
- No, no, you got problems there, too, but I don't do shitters.

450
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,126
That's engineering.

451
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:34,139
- Who are you?
- Mike Williams, Chief E. T.

452
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:37,810
I'm gonna tell you like I told your
executives on the chopper ride here

453
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,575
about the timing of that visit.

454
00:30:40,184 --> 00:30:44,192
We gonna properly secure
this well for a production

455
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,857
platform comin' in right
after us start pumpin' oil,

456
00:30:46,981 --> 00:30:50,019
Unfortunately, to do it
properly takes time.

457
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:53,446
43 days? 44 days?

458
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,157
- Keep countin', Bob.
- 45 days? 46 days?

459
00:30:57,365 --> 00:30:59,158
Have a cookie, Bob?

460
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,348
Can't run a cement log,
I tell ya what we're gonna do now.

461
00:31:04,411 --> 00:31:08,059
We gonna run the negative pressure
test before we do anything else.

462
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:10,043
If really think we need to.

463
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:12,383
I really think we need one,
Bob, and so should you.

464
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:16,796
Especially since we got no idea
whether this well is stable or not.

465
00:31:18,297 --> 00:31:21,023
Hey! Dial tone!
Day's lookin' up.

466
00:31:21,844 --> 00:31:24,010
<i>Mr. Anderson, this is Mr. Jimmy.</i>

467
00:31:24,178 --> 00:31:30,309
We gonna run a negative pressure test, start
trippin' out 3000 feet of pipe... thank you.

468
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:47,496
Young man, pardon me, can you please
tell me where I can find Mr. Mike Williams?

469
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,712
Yes, Sir, he's in the ET shops on
the second deck by the coffee shop.

470
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:52,522
- Thank you much.
- Have a wonderful day, Sir.

471
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:53,713
And you, Sir.

472
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:58,940
Mr. Williams?

473
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:02,142
Mr. Vidrine, are you lost?

474
00:32:02,717 --> 00:32:03,852
Not at all.

475
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:07,717
Just looking to come by and
visit with you for a minute.

476
00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:09,434
Well, how can I help?

477
00:32:09,635 --> 00:32:13,654
Seems as though you had something
more you wanted to say in there.

478
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,720
I thought I give you
the time to say it.

479
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:25,853
Okay, so this rig is broke?

480
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:28,360
- I didn't' say that.
- Sounds like you did.

481
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:31,423
Is there a reason why you
in my shop, Mr. Vidrine?

482
00:32:31,942 --> 00:32:35,030
We a big company, Mike... BP.

483
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:38,867
A very big far-reachin',
complex organization...

484
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:41,838
a lot of movin' parts...
millions of movin' parts.

485
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,719
Thousands upon
thousands of people.

486
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:49,507
<i>And we all work very hard to
ensure that all those people,</i>

487
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:54,093
<i>and all those movin' parts are
functioning</i> properly as a means to an end,

488
00:32:54,194 --> 00:32:58,502
so they're a profit win for all
of us, so, they the big picture.

489
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:03,473
They the little picture, like you,
and the malfunctionin' shitters.

490
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:07,906
But, you see, in point of fact,
they all kind of interconnected,

491
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:10,133
they flow but working, Mike.

492
00:33:10,234 --> 00:33:17,150
So if you off, it's off, then I'm off, then
we off, then the whole damn train is off.

493
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:20,004
You feel me, Mr. Williams?

494
00:33:20,106 --> 00:33:22,345
You on medication, Mr. Vidrine?

495
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:29,818
I'm merely trying to assess just how
close this train is hugging the track.

496
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:33,505
Okay, I hear ya.

497
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:35,875
- You want my take, I mean you really want my take.
- I do.

498
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:40,079
Okay, I think you all trying to run
out of fuel as the wheels touchdown.

499
00:33:40,615 --> 00:33:43,464
Running out of gasoline as
the plane lands is not smart,

500
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,091
it's flawed thinking,
it's hope as a tactic.

501
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:52,393
Duly noted and much appreciated, Sir.

502
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:55,170
Just the opinion of a little guy.

503
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:58,372
That a catfish?

504
00:33:58,673 --> 00:34:01,177
Yep, 65 pounds.

505
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:03,575
Whatchy'all call that, Nibbling?

506
00:34:03,777 --> 00:34:06,525
Noodlin', we noodlin' for catfish.

507
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:10,091
You know that's funny, 'cause when we
go noodlin', my best friend Pino and I,

508
00:34:10,192 --> 00:34:13,195
We go down there with a fifth of Crown
on the lake, walk down the boat ramp,

509
00:34:13,396 --> 00:34:16,742
we look for the biggest, darkest,
blackest hole we can stick our arm in.

510
00:34:16,944 --> 00:34:19,927
We hope those big son of bitches
bite down on us as hard as he can

511
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:22,036
so we can rip his ass out of that hole.

512
00:34:22,086 --> 00:34:24,942
We want to get bit,
<i>that's the plan.</i>

513
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:27,298
<i>Difference is we're
ready for that bite.</i>

514
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,907
We are ready... I'm wearing shoes, hats,
gloves, skull caps, sunglasses and we are ready.

515
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:36,902
I'm gonna stick my hand in that hole
with that monster and hope for the best.

516
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,622
Un-huh, hope ain't a tactic, Don.

517
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,335
I thank you for your time.

518
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,749
- Have a wonderful day, Sir.
<i>- And you.</i>

519
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:51,967
That some shit.

520
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:57,694
<i>Attention on the rig! Negative
pressure test is about to begin.</i>

521
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,448
<i>All non-essential personnel please
stay clear of the rig platform.</i>

522
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,050
Bring it to the current.

523
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:08,666
- Come right two degrees, lock heading on 176.
- Coming right 10 degrees, change to 176.

524
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:09,967
Turning.

525
00:35:18,278 --> 00:35:21,108
<i>- Damon B. Bankson...</i>
- What is that, your fifth cup?

526
00:35:21,158 --> 00:35:23,058
<i>Deepwater Horizon, we are requesting...</i>

527
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:24,256
Just saying.

528
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:28,809
Why don't you go ahead and make sure everybody's up
and ready to get after it, this might be the final test.

529
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,234
<i>Roger that.</i>

530
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:33,560
- Another negative pressure test?
- Another negative pressure test.

531
00:35:33,761 --> 00:35:35,835
- Is there a problem?
- We got a bad well.

532
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:38,189
They all bad wells, we're at a tough prospect.

533
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:46,091
<i>Locked.</i>

534
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:50,394
<i>- Locked at 176, Captain.
- Came right 10 degrees.</i>

535
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:52,737
<i>- We locked in, y'all can run the negative test.</i>
- Yeah.

536
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:55,292
- Go ahead, Jason.
- Copy that.

537
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:57,106
Lose the annular.

538
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:25,219
<i>- Initiate negative pressure test.
- Initiating drill pipe pressure test.</i>

539
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,169
You really think this is the last test?

540
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:54,422
Shit, I hope so, yeah, this
is the Well from Hell, girl.

541
00:37:19,764 --> 00:37:21,714
Yeah, well,
that ain't going to last long.

542
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:24,034
That's all you got.

543
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:26,753
Goal!

544
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,244
100 pounds per square inch.

545
00:37:40,952 --> 00:37:45,855
That's okay, pushing back on us a little,
she's trying to us honest.

546
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:53,950
<i>Hey, Don, you get that bottle of wine</i>
that I sent you about a month ago?

547
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:57,713
I did, I did, thank you very
much, I not only I got it, I drank it.

548
00:37:58,339 --> 00:37:59,885
- Pretty good huh?
- Very nice.

549
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,662
That's Super Tuscan, yeah?

550
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:04,921
Gaja, right? I know you like it.

551
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:08,464
- Gaja.
- Sorry?

552
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:11,111
Gaja... it's called.

553
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:21,730
<i>I think they're about halfway there.</i>

554
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:24,453
How much coffee you
drinking these days, Hank?

555
00:38:24,654 --> 00:38:28,523
Look man, I gave it up several months
ago, I drink nothing but green tea now.

556
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,818
Stop taking the coffee doing yoga every day.

557
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:34,006
Two weeks now.

558
00:38:47,512 --> 00:38:49,567
450 psi.

559
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:56,726
This don't look good to me.

560
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:03,786
<i>Pressure! Warning!</i>

561
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:05,835

00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:21,915
<i>Pressure alert.</i>

00:39:23,066 --> 00:39:24,687
1395.

00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:26,929
<i>Pressure alert.</i>

<i>Pressure alert.</i>

567
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:36,671
We're on at 1395, Mr. Jimmy.

568
00:39:37,105 --> 00:39:38,521
<i>That's a lot of pressure.</i>

569
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:41,329
Yeah, enough to cut your car in half.

570
00:39:41,532 --> 00:39:43,232
Open in the upper annular.

571
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,980
Hollywood, open up the drill pipe path,
we gotta bleed pressure.

572
00:39:49,484 --> 00:39:53,461
Gentlemen, I hate  to say
this, that is a bad test.

573
00:39:53,662 --> 00:39:54,764
Not necessarily.

574
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:57,272
Don, a good test...

575
00:39:57,473 --> 00:40:00,266
Starts zero, stays at zero, ends at zero.

576
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:01,467
Thank you.

577
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:08,398
So, there is pressure but there was no mud
flowin' up and out of that pipe. now explain that to me.

578
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:16,037
That's a confusing result,
I give you that.

579
00:40:16,238 --> 00:40:21,931
Kaluza and I have talked about this drill
pipe until we blue in the face.

580
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:27,021
There's something off with it,
he says it's a bladder effect.

581
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:28,324
Bladder effect?

582
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:32,319
Bladder effect, he said Jason
would know what he's talking about.

583
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,693
I say that flow right there.

584
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:35,495
Correct.

585
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:38,530
- Looky here.
- Hey, we actually needed that!

586
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:44,644
Bladder effect, it is a pocket of pressure

587
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:51,583
trapped around the annular
which reads like drill pressure

588
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:57,715
because it is trapped right there,
it is sitting right there on the sensor.

589
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:01,140
<i>If this was a legitimate pressure issue</i>

590
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:06,855
then we would have mud flowing right back
up and out of that drill pipe right there.

591
00:41:07,157 --> 00:41:09,276
Now, how we going to test this?

592
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:12,746
We going to run that negative
pressure test again,

593
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:16,547
but we going to run it on the
kill line, not on the drill pipe.

594
00:41:16,748 --> 00:41:19,553
<i>Obviously our problem is
with that drill pipe.</i>

595
00:41:19,668 --> 00:41:21,644
You cannot have

596
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:26,472
13,095 pounds of pressure per square inch,

597
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:29,415
enough to cut your car in half,

598
00:41:29,616 --> 00:41:35,045
and not have any fluid being forced up
and out of that pipe by that pressure.

599
00:41:37,353 --> 00:41:41,592
Boys, you gotta whole mess of
drilling mud on your boots out there?

600
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:42,593
Hey, Don.

601
00:41:46,531 --> 00:41:48,099
It got hot in the drill shack.

602
00:41:48,401 --> 00:41:51,039
We have a problem with that drill pipe,

603
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,395
or with the sensor giving
us a false reading...

604
00:41:56,553 --> 00:42:01,161
or any other of a thousand
moving parts down there.

605
00:42:01,288 --> 00:42:07,533
Now, the way we going to find out is run
that negative pressure test on the kill line,

606
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:13,634
and if there is zero pressure, Mr. Jimmy, then
that is going to tell us all we need to know.

607
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:15,587
Are we in agreement?

608
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:18,982
I don't know about an agreement,
it never hurts to run a test.

609
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:22,305
- Look...
- How we doing in here, Mr. Jimmy?

610
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:27,129
- We doing great, aren't we, Don?
- Yes, we are.

611
00:42:31,978 --> 00:42:33,284
BP's well.

612
00:42:37,591 --> 00:42:38,691
Is it?

613
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:41,148
<i>- Bp's oil.</i>
- Indeed.

614
00:42:41,713 --> 00:42:44,842
We just to help y'all
hire to a drill a hole.

615
00:42:45,244 --> 00:42:47,224
You are correct, Mr. Jimmy.

616
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:51,276
But we 50 days late,
and the hole ain't drilled.

617
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,015
Now, Mr. Jimmy, we have issue in the galley.

618
00:42:56,748 --> 00:43:00,355
- A whole bunch of people, it's a safety issue.
- It won't take but a minute.

619
00:43:11,027 --> 00:43:13,969
That's are 43 days, not 50...
simple mathematics.

620
00:43:14,012 --> 00:43:18,089
Whereas your completion date was March 8,
it's 20th April today, 43 days.

621
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,290
Yep.

622
00:43:19,393 --> 00:43:22,582
I think you money-hungry sons
of bitches at least be good at math.

623
00:43:22,883 --> 00:43:24,276
All right, gentlemen.

624
00:43:24,677 --> 00:43:28,145
Oh, hey, Dewey, negative
pressure test on the kill line.

625
00:43:28,346 --> 00:43:29,466
Switching to kill line test.

626
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,306
<i>Initiating kill line pressure test.</i>

627
00:43:32,385 --> 00:43:33,385
<i>Bladder effect.</i>

628
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,807
It ring true to you?

629
00:43:36,308 --> 00:43:40,930
Well... whatever came out of Vildrine's
mouth that really rang true to me, but, yeah.

630
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:44,948
I mean on its face, yeah.

631
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,976
There's a logic to it,
it's got merit, but...

632
00:43:48,478 --> 00:43:51,713
I don't know, apply to kill pipes and kill lines.

633
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:55,159
<i>- A little above my pay grade.</i>
- We shoulda seen some mud.

634
00:44:39,526 --> 00:44:41,534
Yes! Good job!

635
00:44:41,835 --> 00:44:47,247
The Deepwater Horizon is receiving BP's
highest safety award for the seventh straight year.

636
00:44:47,364 --> 00:44:51,933
And it all starts at the top with
the man you call "Mr. Jimmy".

637
00:44:55,688 --> 00:44:58,002
- Mr. Jimmy, Mr. Jimmy.
- Make a speech, make a speech.

638
00:45:16,587 --> 00:45:19,994
<i>Held at zero, boss,
good test, no pressure.</i>

639
00:45:20,296 --> 00:45:23,129
Congratulations, good test.

640
00:45:23,331 --> 00:45:27,143
We still got 1400 psi on the drill line.

641
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:31,748
<i>Drill line and the kill line should be exactly
the same, they should all be lined up.</i>

642
00:45:31,848 --> 00:45:34,645
We already agreed that there's
somethin' wrong with the drill line.

643
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,243
So, why do you keep coming back to it?

644
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:38,122
I don't know...
good old field practice?

645
00:45:38,224 --> 00:45:42,329
No mud, no flow, we got to go.

646
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:46,745
Now, how quick can we lock
the door on this well?

647
00:45:47,347 --> 00:45:50,430
I'm not doing nothing until Mr.
Jimmy is made aware.

648
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,991
Is there a man among you?
Is there an adult here?

649
00:45:57,775 --> 00:46:03,279
You...y'all got the paraphernalia,
the dip, the steel toes,

650
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,410
but it's all bullshit, we got
zero pressure on the kill line.

651
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:14,339
You nervous as cats,
<i>afraid to make it work at every turn.</i>

652
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:18,051
That will be my summary back
to my bosses in London.

653
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:21,446
- Bob?
- Agreed.

654
00:46:23,082 --> 00:46:28,156
Again, you can call Mr. Jimmy.

655
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:32,911
And, uh, don't let me keep you from your ice
cream for another second, thanks.

656
00:46:34,494 --> 00:46:37,305
- This is Mr. Jimmy.
- We ran the negative test.

657
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:39,662
It was good test,
we got no pressure.

658
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,367
I'm about to start this place
and I want your blessing.

659
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:44,769
You sure about this, Jason?

660
00:46:45,171 --> 00:46:49,179
Kill line was good, I'm sure of
that, it's the only thing I'm sure of.

661
00:46:50,368 --> 00:46:53,624
<i>These guys are all over me,
what do you wanna do?</i>

662
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:56,655
Zero flow, correct?

663
00:46:56,756 --> 00:46:58,238
<i>That's correct, no flow.</i>

664
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,463
Are we good?

665
00:47:13,217 --> 00:47:15,910
Well, it's looks like it's
going to be a long night.

666
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,704
You stay on top of it, Jason,
I'll see you in about half an hour, thanks.

667
00:47:24,817 --> 00:47:27,682
<i>- Okay, guys, good test.</i>
- Yahoo.

668
00:47:27,783 --> 00:47:30,129
Get ready to pull out
10,000 barrels of mud.

669
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:34,111
I think I'm going to take a shower and
wash my day off before I start my night.

670
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:37,553
-Why don't you get some ice cream, Mike.
- I'm gotta watch my figure.

671
00:47:37,972 --> 00:47:41,252
I'll go fix some smoke detectors before
I'm about to pop somebody in the mouth.

672
00:47:41,263 --> 00:47:44,285
That's a good idea, say
"Hi" to Felicia for me.

673
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,486
- Mr. Jimmy?
- Yes?

674
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:46,790
We really need you to lead with this.

675
00:47:46,918 --> 00:47:48,794
Get a picture.

676
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:50,169
Mr. Jimmy,
congratulations, Mr. Jimmy.

677
00:47:51,377 --> 00:47:53,146
Hey, appreciate it a lot, guys.

678
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:06,153
- Help me check the house.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

679
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:07,916
We got a good test.

680
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,760
<i>We will start sending you some mud,
transfer... to Bankston.</i>

681
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:12,863
Copy that.

682
00:48:13,464 --> 00:48:19,073
Nervous as cats, cats ain't scared, I had a cat
named Oscar used to try to mount my Labrador.

683
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:20,751
I'm opening the annular.

684
00:48:21,052 --> 00:48:23,184
Let's hope that monster ain't awake.

685
00:48:25,965 --> 00:48:27,308
Mud pumps are on.

686
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,133
<i>Removing heavy mud from well.</i>

687
00:48:29,335 --> 00:48:32,184
<i>Displacement Holding, Tank 2.</i>

688
00:48:32,386 --> 00:48:33,686
<i>4%</i>

689
00:48:33,737 --> 00:48:37,774
- Boys, we got a good test.
<i>- Let's pump out all this mud.</i>

690
00:48:44,646 --> 00:48:46,737
We're done.

691
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:51,377
<i>We're going home, bring in
the mud, bring in the mud.</i>

692
00:48:51,578 --> 00:48:56,356
<i>Damon Bankston at Deepwater Horizon, you are
clear to approach and receive drilling mud.</i>

693
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,323
Copy Deepwater. Coming along
side to receive heavy mud.

694
00:48:59,424 --> 00:49:02,168
...is good, ...good, all below normal.

695
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:09,803
<i>Attention on deck, prepare to feed
out the mud, 10,000 barrels.</i>

696
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:13,477
<i>Attention on the rig,
pressure tests were good.</i>

697
00:49:13,713 --> 00:49:16,842
Congratulations, D.W's crew, we about to moving on.

698
00:49:17,043 --> 00:49:18,575
Well from Hell is done, boys.

699
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:22,342
Damn, we'll be in the basin soon.

700
00:49:22,443 --> 00:49:27,229
Two, three days maybe, I'll be in my boat,
drinking me a beer, catching us a sucker at the lake.

701
00:49:27,485 --> 00:49:32,600
<i>Yes! You big beautiful mud.
35%.</i>

702
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:35,260
- Hang on, baby.
- We are going home!

703
00:49:35,796 --> 00:49:37,956
I thought you had other plans,
I thought you were goin' out.

704
00:49:38,068 --> 00:49:39,169
I cancelled.

705
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,892
- Sweatpants, Bud Light, lime, DVR time.
- Okay.

706
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:47,275
A simple country girl.

707
00:49:59,669 --> 00:50:01,197
<i>55%</i>

708
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,648
<i>75%</i>

709
00:50:10,828 --> 00:50:12,127
<i>Hopefully smoother this time.</i>

710
00:50:12,356 --> 00:50:13,283
Jason!

711
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:17,500
I got a 20 barrels increase in ...
and an increase in flow, it's not slowing down.

712
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,016
<i>All right, stop pumping mud.</i>

713
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:20,585
<i>- Pressure alert.</i>
- Oh no.

714
00:50:23,016 --> 00:50:25,740
<i>- Standby.
- ...shutting down.</i>

715
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:28,021
They must not be liking something up there.

716
00:50:28,812 --> 00:50:30,982
Hey, boys. I'm gonna go
take a leak, you guys good?

717
00:50:31,082 --> 00:50:32,835
- I got you buddy.
- All right.

718
00:50:36,855 --> 00:50:39,034
<i>- Pressure alert.
- It's not stopping.</i>

719
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:42,054
Clear the drill shack,
<i>get him and him out of here.</i>

720
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:42,956
What is happening...

721
00:50:43,158 --> 00:50:46,441
Gentlemen, what is the excitement, we
stipulated there's something wrong.

722
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:49,877
I never should've let you push me. Now get
your ass out of here before I push back.

723
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,425
That comment will be noted.

724
00:51:00,259 --> 00:51:03,905
- What is goin' on?
- Likely nothing, Mr. Kaluza.

725
00:51:04,543 --> 00:51:06,921
- Watch your step over here.
- Shit.

726
00:51:07,822 --> 00:51:09,097
Whatya got, Caleb?

727
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:13,865
What the hell did she do?

728
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:21,297
Shit.

729
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:32,036
Oh, shit..

730
00:51:32,138 --> 00:51:33,890
<i>- What the hell's going on?</i>
- We got flow.

731
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,346
Shit! That ain't good.

732
00:51:36,479 --> 00:51:39,272
- Jason, you seeing this?
<i>- We got flow out here.</i>

733
00:51:39,573 --> 00:51:41,162
<i>- Warning.</i>
- It's not stopping.

734
00:51:41,363 --> 00:51:44,857
Jason, are you seeing this?

735
00:51:45,058 --> 00:51:48,114
- Didn't I tell you not to do anything.
- Is she just kicking or just...

736
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:56,672
- Clear the floor.
- Oh, shit.

737
00:52:06,675 --> 00:52:08,806
Mike, what is that,
is everything okay?

738
00:52:11,894 --> 00:52:13,272
I'm closing the annular.

739
00:52:16,737 --> 00:52:19,475
- Duck, get in here now.
- Are you shutting it in?

740
00:52:19,578 --> 00:52:22,720
All right we're okay,
I closed the annular, we got 30 seconds.

741
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:27,429
Get off the floor, now!

742
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:29,364
- Duck, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

743
00:52:29,414 --> 00:52:32,079
Get a finger on the EDS,

Release the drill pipe pressure!

749

You're all right?

777

The alarm didn't stay up, I'm gonna make sure everyone evacuates.

778

01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:41,707
We blow out Mr. Jimmy?

896
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:45,154
There's secondary explosions...
we got fire everywhere.

897
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,427
We disconnect it?
Did we cut the pipe?

898
01:08:47,566 --> 01:08:49,179
I don't know,
but I don't think so.

899
01:08:49,397 --> 01:08:52,208
We need to disconnect, Mike,
help me get to the bridge.

900
01:08:55,582 --> 01:08:57,541
I'll take you to the bridge.

901
01:08:57,659 --> 01:09:01,303
- I got you. All right. C'mon.
- Where are we?

902
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:04,191
You wouldn't recognize me
even if you could see it.

903
01:09:06,712 --> 01:09:08,558
This pipe is gonna break.

904
01:09:10,173 --> 01:09:11,458
C'mon, Mr. Jimmy, c'mon.

905
01:09:14,264 --> 01:09:18,536
If you find yourself in the water you got
a light and a whistle, you understand?

906
01:09:18,538 --> 01:09:21,301
If you get into an oil anything
swim away from the rig.

907
01:09:21,502 --> 01:09:24,182
Should we wait for the Coast Guard?

908
01:09:24,383 --> 01:09:26,324
No way! We need to go!
C'mon. Let's go! Now!

909
01:09:26,525 --> 01:09:28,529
<i>- Let's go now. C'mon!
- The water's on fire.</i>

910
01:09:28,702 --> 01:09:31,902
- Who's coordinating the air assets out there?
- ATC, fixed wing, they have gear.

911
01:09:31,997 --> 01:09:35,215
<i>West Jefferson, East Jefferson
and Tulane are prepared to take...</i>

912
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:37,419
<i>- Start.
- External power.</i>

913
01:09:37,621 --> 01:09:39,419
<i>Coast Guard Area 1, clear.</i>

914
01:09:39,621 --> 01:09:41,981
There's people jumping in the water,
he sees 3 people jumping in the water.

915
01:09:42,182 --> 01:09:43,660
- Jumpers, can you get me...
- You have jumpers?

916
01:09:43,685 --> 01:09:46,010
What's the ETA on the first helicopter.

917
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,609
Sir, it's going to be 35 minutes.

918
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:49,533
About 30 minutes too late.

919
01:09:50,442 --> 01:09:53,675
<i>This is US Coast Guard B47 departing</i>

920
01:09:53,876 --> 01:09:57,660
<i>on a route to emergency distress
call for Deepwater Horizon.</i>

921
01:09:57,861 --> 01:10:01,901
<i>ETA to location, 25 minutes.</i>

922
01:10:11,737 --> 01:10:13,365
<i>Get in! Get in!</i>

923
01:10:32,681 --> 01:10:33,647
- You good?
- Yeah.

924
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:35,186
- All right, c'mon!
- Help!

925
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,676
Can you hear 'em?

926
01:10:42,395 --> 01:10:44,395
Is someone there?
This is Caleb, I need help over here.

927
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:45,441
It's Wyman!

928
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:48,236
We gotta get out of here,
there's methane everywhere.

929
01:10:48,442 --> 01:10:51,150
I found him here like this, he's hurt
real bad now, he ain't getting up.

930
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:53,229
- Don't look down, all right?
- No, no, no.

931
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:58,726
Wait! Shit, His bone's caught on the metal.

932
01:11:09,412 --> 01:11:12,012
Mike!
Mike!

933
01:11:12,043 --> 01:11:15,159
C'mon, we gotta work this, we gotta
find something to get it open.

934
01:11:16,467 --> 01:11:20,256
Pull! Pull!
Keep pulling!

935
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:27,881
I've lost power.

936
01:11:28,082 --> 01:11:30,571
All right, just stop,
give me a second, let me think.

937
01:11:40,516 --> 01:11:41,680
I'm gonna cut the pipe.

938
01:11:43,505 --> 01:11:46,222
Hey, hey, hey, Andrea,
get your ass back on station.

939
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:47,720
We don't have the authority.

940
01:11:47,921 --> 01:11:49,377
I'm going to seal the well.

941
01:11:49,427 --> 01:11:50,711
Do not touch that button!

942
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:55,675
- We need to take the EDS.
- We don't have the authority.

943
01:11:58,485 --> 01:11:59,993
You ain't pushing it.

944
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:03,603
<i>Can somebody help me?</i>

945
01:12:03,805 --> 01:12:07,570
- Go! Get out of here!
- You're coming with or without that leg.

946
01:12:07,671 --> 01:12:09,801
Hold on, hold on,
hey, look at me.

947
01:12:09,878 --> 01:12:12,742
This gonna hurt like a bitch,
you stay calm for a second, okay.

948
01:12:12,942 --> 01:12:14,847
Look at me, don't look down,
look at me.

949
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:17,558
We gotcha!.
Hold on.

950
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,629
Pull. Pull.

951
01:12:20,931 --> 01:12:23,464
Wyman, can you move?
Okay, then let's go.

952
01:12:24,917 --> 01:12:26,860
Okay, get me to the bridge, Mike.

953
01:12:35,872 --> 01:12:37,899
<i>Coast Guard, District 8 Command
Center, Lieutenant Degan speaking.</i>

954
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:40,076
Hi, Sir.

955
01:12:40,804 --> 01:12:44,768
I just... um... I don't mean to bother
you, I'm sure everything's just fine.

956
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:49,826
But my husband. Mike Williams, is
on the Deepwater Horizon and uh.

957
01:12:49,928 --> 01:12:53,582
<i>Yes, ma'am. Right now we only have a couple of
confirmed reports with a fire on an oil rig.</i>

958
01:12:53,632 --> 01:12:57,551
<i>That's about all I can say.</i>
They're on the Deepwater Horizon?

959
01:12:57,852 --> 01:12:59,890
Because there's so many rigs
out there, you... you sure?

960
01:12:59,973 --> 01:13:02,392
<i>Yes, Ma'am, there is a fire on
the Deepwater Horizon.</i>

961
01:13:02,593 --> 01:13:05,113
<i>That's all I can say, Ma'am, I'm sorry, I really have to go.</i>

962
01:14:03,892 --> 01:14:05,106
What happened?

963
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:16,502
Ken, you all right?
The derrick's gonna fall on us!

964
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:21,032
Damn, the boat's leavin'!

965
01:14:21,209 --> 01:14:23,267
My crane is gonna take
the goddamn derrick out.

966
01:14:23,368 --> 01:14:25,217
- It's coming down!
- Get on the boat now!

967
01:14:25,318 --> 01:14:27,615
I gotta stop it,
or it's gonna kill us all.

968
01:14:44,539 --> 01:14:45,759
Go, Dale!

969
01:14:49,097 --> 01:14:50,635
Go! Go! Go!

970
01:14:51,336 --> 01:14:53,809
Help him up the stairs.

971
01:14:55,347 --> 01:14:56,587
Shit!

972
01:15:15,227 --> 01:15:16,597
Go Dale!

973
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:30,986
Dale get out!

974
01:15:31,388 --> 01:15:33,929
<i>Get out of there! Now!</i>

975
01:15:54,039 --> 01:15:55,334
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

976
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:13,026
Who's on the bridge?

977
01:16:13,092 --> 01:16:14,737
- Fleytas.
- Kuchta.

978
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:30,582
Get your ass on the lifeboat.

979
01:16:36,656 --> 01:16:41,717
- Andrea, Kuchta, have we disconnected?
- No.

980
01:16:41,819 --> 01:16:44,559
Andrea, get my hands on the EDS.

981
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,331
I'm gonna cut the pipe and seal this well.

982
01:16:47,532 --> 01:16:49,039
We gonna choke this fire.

983
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,071
- Right here, right here.
- No, no, up, up!

984
01:17:02,463 --> 01:17:03,603
Is it still burning?

985
01:17:03,804 --> 01:17:07,935
- It still flow, Mr. Jimmy.
- Oh, c'mon. Please! Please!

986
01:17:14,414 --> 01:17:16,299
It still burning Mr. Jimmy, we gotta go.

987
01:17:19,442 --> 01:17:20,854
Hey! Hey! Back up!

988
01:17:21,113 --> 01:17:24,139
C'mon, c'mon, there room for a coupla more! Get in!

989
01:17:27,665 --> 01:17:29,693
We need to restore
power up here.

990
01:17:29,905 --> 01:17:33,170
- We need to bring the standby generator online.
- With the fire fighting pumps?

991
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:37,652
No, we just want to keep this rig on station
as long as we can, so that pipe doesn't break.

992
01:17:37,702 --> 01:17:40,904
- That's all we can do, we can't save this rig.
- All right then, it can't hurt to go try.

993
01:17:40,946 --> 01:17:44,227
Naw, it could, very much Mike, it's on
the other side of that derrick.

994
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:45,228
I know it, I know it.

995
01:17:45,329 --> 01:17:46,630
- I'm coming with you.
- What?

996
01:17:46,731 --> 01:17:48,068
- I'm with you.
- You sure?

997
01:17:48,169 --> 01:17:49,752
- I'm with you.
- Go on, Mike.

998
01:17:49,954 --> 01:17:50,954
C'mon.

999
01:18:08,304 --> 01:18:13,776
Natalie, this is Felicia Williams, our husbands
work on the Deepwater Horizon together.

1000
01:18:13,976 --> 01:18:17,216
Well, I just called the Coast Guard and they can
just confirmed that there is a fire...

1001
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,507
but I just wondering maybe
you heard something.

1002
01:18:19,709 --> 01:18:21,111
<i>What did the Coast Guard say?</i>

1003
01:18:21,211 --> 01:18:23,039
Just that there's been a fire.

1004
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,691
<i>Shelly heard there's people
jumping off the rig.</i>

1005
01:18:32,676 --> 01:18:33,763
What are you doing?

1006
01:18:35,834 --> 01:18:36,979
Not now, babe.

1007
01:18:37,975 --> 01:18:39,878
- What's wrong?
- Not now, baby.

1008
01:18:45,914 --> 01:18:47,097
Shit.

1009
01:18:47,398 --> 01:18:48,402
Come on.

1010
01:18:58,672 --> 01:18:59,712
Lighten both...

1011
01:18:59,913 --> 01:19:02,374
- Lifeboat 4 is full!
- Make your way to Lifeboat 2!

1012
01:19:02,576 --> 01:19:04,214
- Lower the boat!
- Go!

1013
01:19:25,676 --> 01:19:28,397
Shit! Shit!

1014
01:19:28,598 --> 01:19:30,495
- You got gloves?
- Yes!

1015
01:19:40,004 --> 01:19:41,004
C'mere!

1016
01:19:42,202 --> 01:19:44,909
<i>Mike? Mike, are you there?</i>

1017
01:19:48,446 --> 01:19:50,426
Mike, Mike, bring up power.

1018
01:19:50,627 --> 01:19:53,232
- You know your way around this thing?
- How hard can it be?

1019
01:19:53,433 --> 01:19:54,983
C'mere, rattle this shit off to me.

1020
01:19:55,974 --> 01:19:57,240
You gotta be shitting me.

1021
01:19:57,442 --> 01:20:00,020
- C'mon!
- All right. "Turn the remote switch to local."

1022
01:20:00,222 --> 01:20:02,371
"Switching power switch."
Turned to the on position.

1023
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:06,011
Okay, "Press main start button"...
Red one right there.

1024
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:09,406
I'm impressed man, I don't know
many roughnecks that can read.

1025
01:20:09,507 --> 01:20:10,908
Very funny, very funny.

1026
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:13,349
You know I had a full ride
to UT architecture school.

1027
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:14,687
What the hell you doing here?

1028
01:20:14,737 --> 01:20:16,655
- I should've listen to my mom.
- Maybe you should have.

1029
01:20:16,758 --> 01:20:19,335
- Mr. Jimmy, you get any power up there?
- This should be it.

1030
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:22,037
Do you have any power?

1031
01:20:22,138 --> 01:20:24,419
- We still outside the walk circle?
- Yes, for outstation.

1032
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:26,491
- Turn it nice and slow.
- Okay.

1033
01:20:26,592 --> 01:20:27,829
Bring us back slow.

1034
01:20:31,453 --> 01:20:32,536
C'mon on, baby! C'mon!

1035
01:20:36,099 --> 01:20:37,022
Shit!

1036
01:20:37,554 --> 01:20:38,554
Shit.

1037
01:20:42,069 --> 01:20:43,796
Get your start key
turn to on position.

1038
01:20:47,032 --> 01:20:48,928
We gotcha, We gotcha!

1039
01:20:51,042 --> 01:20:52,465
Watch his leg!

1040
01:20:53,467 --> 01:20:55,207
Wait for the pull plug light.

1041
01:20:55,509 --> 01:20:58,460
- C'mon.
- This should be it.

1042
01:20:58,662 --> 01:21:00,868
There you go.

1043
01:21:00,969 --> 01:21:03,503
Mr. Jimmy, <i>did you get power up there?</i>

1044
01:21:03,704 --> 01:21:06,607
- We have power, Mike.
- Please, no, no.

1045
01:21:07,611 --> 01:21:09,071
Kuchta, can you help me?

1046
01:21:09,508 --> 01:21:12,786
<i>- What's goin' on?
- Close the door! Now!</i>

1047
01:21:14,806 --> 01:21:17,559
<i>Get to the boat, Mike, it's over.</i>

1048
01:21:17,761 --> 01:21:19,845
Jimmy, we have to go.

1049
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,424
Look out!

1050
01:21:41,415 --> 01:21:43,075
God! It's all coming down.

1051
01:21:43,264 --> 01:21:45,040
<i>We gotta get to the boat.</i>

1052
01:21:47,018 --> 01:21:48,459
<i>Lower the boat, we're full.</i>

1053
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:53,111
<i>Let's go!</i>

1054
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:06,502
Come on.

1055
01:22:08,942 --> 01:22:13,319
They left us! They left us! Shit!

1056
01:22:18,556 --> 01:22:21,266
- Emergency liferaft!
- Somebody got a knife?

1057
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:24,194
I need a knife!

1058
01:22:28,353 --> 01:22:29,895
I got it, watch out!

1059
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:33,741
Open it up!

1060
01:22:37,799 --> 01:22:39,600
C'mon, hold the flag!

1061
01:22:39,801 --> 01:22:42,472
- C'mon we got to spin it out!
- Crank it!

1062
01:22:42,474 --> 01:22:44,419
...as hard as I can!

1063
01:22:45,082 --> 01:22:47,267
C'mon, stay with me, man, c'mon.

1064
01:22:51,184 --> 01:22:53,371
- Shit.
- Tie it up! Tie it up!

1065
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:55,898
Shit!

1066
01:23:00,035 --> 01:23:01,035
Tie it up!

1067
01:23:02,118 --> 01:23:04,652
C'mon, c'mon, bring it in!

1068
01:23:04,953 --> 01:23:07,078

1069
01:23:07,879 --> 01:23:11,076
- Where's Andrea?
- Andrea, let's go!

1070
01:23:11,178 --> 01:23:12,916
Come on, Andrea!

1071
01:23:22,813 --> 01:23:24,559
No, wait! Wait!

1072
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:38,008
There is too much fire,
we can't jump from here.

1073
01:23:39,494 --> 01:23:41,166
We need to get up higher.

1074
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:43,361
We need to get up higher, come on.

1075
01:23:48,199 --> 01:23:49,322
Slow down, slow down.

1076
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:52,598
- It's a raft!
- Hang on.

1077
01:23:57,263 --> 01:23:58,263
Come on.

1078
01:23:59,021 --> 01:24:00,618
Bankston Rescue!

1079
01:24:01,639 --> 01:24:03,316
<i>Here! Over here!</i>

1080
01:24:03,617 --> 01:24:05,611
We got you, here you go.

1081
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:14,248
C'mon, we got to get up, c'mon.

1082
01:24:20,492 --> 01:24:21,877
On the stairs, going high!

1083
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:27,859
Shit! Shit!

1084
01:24:33,628 --> 01:24:34,628
C'mon, c'mon.

1085
01:25:00,224 --> 01:25:01,786
Hey.

1086
01:25:02,888 --> 01:25:03,914
C'mon.

1087
01:25:05,738 --> 01:25:08,139
Original V8 or a crate motor?

1088
01:25:09,141 --> 01:25:11,984
Your Mustang, original V8 or crate motor?

1089
01:25:12,085 --> 01:25:13,357
It's original.

1090
01:25:13,999 --> 01:25:17,401
That's cool, ya know,
we might be able to rebuild it.

1091
01:25:17,603 --> 01:25:19,204
Who's we?

1092
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,583
Do you see anyone else here?

1093
01:25:22,726 --> 01:25:23,959
Me and you.

1094
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,837
Now, listen to me, look at me!

1095
01:25:28,426 --> 01:25:31,154
A little up higher, you can jump off first.

1096
01:25:31,356 --> 01:25:35,025
- Okay? We gonna jump over the fire.
- No, no.

1097
01:25:36,374 --> 01:25:37,374
I can't.

1098
01:25:39,344 --> 01:25:41,551
Can't what? Rebuild an engine?

1099
01:25:41,966 --> 01:25:43,201
Jump.

1100
01:25:44,095 --> 01:25:46,701
Trust me, we're not gonna
hit the fire, you hear me?

1101
01:25:46,735 --> 01:25:47,874
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die.

1102
01:25:48,066 --> 01:25:49,775
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die.

1103
01:25:49,799 --> 01:25:53,490
Our choice right now
is to burn or jump!

1104
01:25:53,692 --> 01:25:54,692
Will you let go of me!

1105
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:59,149
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me! You jump.

1106
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,250
Do what you want.

1107
01:26:00,452 --> 01:26:02,420
You know what? I'm gonna
do whatever you do.

1108
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:06,250
No.

1109
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:09,800
- My wife's name Felicia, my daughter's Sydney.
- Don't put that on me.

1110
01:26:10,002 --> 01:26:11,939
And I will see them again,
do you understand me?

1111
01:26:13,186 --> 01:26:16,795
What are the odds of you getting out of this
alive if you don't jump with me right now?

1112
01:26:17,313 --> 01:26:19,654
We're getting off this rig,
do you hear me?

1113
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:23,109
You wanna stay here,
you stay here.

1114
01:26:28,532 --> 01:26:30,353
Hey, what color is the Mustang?

1115
01:27:11,752 --> 01:27:14,168
Andrea! Andrea!

1116
01:28:11,904 --> 01:28:14,552
<i>If you hear your name, holler out.</i>

1117
01:28:15,696 --> 01:28:18,408

1119
01:28:26,309 --> 01:28:28,396
Anderson, Jason!

1120
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:33,832
Jason Anderson, are you here?

1121
01:28:37,324 --> 01:28:40,079
Is there anybody here
from the drill shack?

1122
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:45,959
Nobody?

1123
01:29:00,927 --> 01:29:03,098
Donald Clark, are you here?

1124
01:29:07,347 --> 01:29:08,671
Dewey Revette?

1125
01:29:12,762 --> 01:29:14,275

01:29:16,177 --> 01:29:17,794
Adam West?

1127

Roy Kemp?

01:29:30,286 --> 01:29:31,952
Dale Burkeen?

1129
01:29:37,028 --> 01:29:38,442
Gordon Jones?

1130
01:29:42,469 --> 01:29:43,956
Karl Inger Klepp?

1131
01:29:51,741 --> 01:29:52,976
Stephen Curtis?

1132
01:30:05,152 --> 01:30:06,462
Keith Manuel.

1133
01:30:06,763 --> 01:30:07,763
Thank you.

1134
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:13,789
You're good?

1135
01:30:59,036 --> 01:31:00,567
All knees.

1136
01:31:02,237 --> 01:31:04,857
Our Father who art in Heaven,

1137
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:08,303
Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,

1138
01:31:08,505 --> 01:31:11,343
Thy will be done, on Earth
as it is in Heaven.

1139
01:31:11,544 --> 01:31:14,139
Give us today our daily bread.

1140
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:19,158
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

1141
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,085
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

1142
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:51,710
What's your name, Sir?

1143
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,803
Mike Williams.

1144
01:32:00,059 --> 01:32:03,649
You just need to get some rest and
after you're done you talk to me.

1145
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:05,794
Hey, hey, hey, you on the rig?

1146
01:32:05,995 --> 01:32:08,356
- Yes, Sir.
- My son get off the rig with you?

1147
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:10,008
- Rig?
- Did he get off the rig?

1148
01:32:10,587 --> 01:32:11,739
I don't know if he made it.

1149
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:15,328
Where is my son?
Where is my son?

1150
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:17,203
- Did he get off the rig?
- I don't know.

1151
01:32:22,556 --> 01:32:26,062
My son, do you know him?
Did he leave with you?

1152
01:32:26,263 --> 01:32:28,525
Somebody better tell me something.

1153
01:32:32,147 --> 01:32:34,741
<i>Somebody help me.</i>

1154
01:32:40,784 --> 01:32:42,952
<i>Did you hear any one of the alarms?</i>

1155
01:33:12,949 --> 01:33:14,722
Daddy.

1156
01:35:22,749 --> 01:35:26,319
<i>I remember closen' my eyes and
saying a prayer, asking God</i>

1157
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:30,971
<i>to tell my wife and my little girl
that daddy did everything he could,</i>

1158
01:35:31,172 --> 01:35:33,611
<i>and if I survive this, it's for a reason.</i>

1159
01:35:40,924 --> 01:35:42,192
Please raise your right hand, Sir..

1160
01:35:42,394 --> 01:35:46,082
Do you solemnly swear that the
testimony you about to give is the truth,

1161
01:35:46,283 --> 01:35:48,126
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God.

1162
01:35:48,167 --> 01:35:49,868
- Yes Sir.
- Thank you, Sir.

1163
01:35:56,544 --> 01:36:00,769
We went to the next light that we saw
in the water and retrieved that person.

1164
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:04,115
It was Andrea, the dynamic position operator.

1165
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:16,900
<i>I went to the PA made the last announcement
and said that we were abandoning the rig.</i>

1166
01:36:17,102 --> 01:36:19,417
<i>Who in your view was in charge of the rig?</i>

1167
01:36:19,467 --> 01:36:22,234
- The OIM.
- That would be Mr. Harrell, is that correct?

1168
01:36:22,284 --> 01:36:23,476
Right.

1169
01:36:26,704 --> 01:36:32,058
There was a major explosion followed by
second explosion on the starboard side.

1170
01:36:32,259 --> 01:36:35,887
<i>After the explosion, I called the
rig floor, there was no answer.</i>

1171
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:46,938
<i>All the things that they told us
could never happen... happened.</i>

1172
01:36:47,139 --> 01:36:48,733
<i>Men lost their lives.</i>
