1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,191
能打擾一下大家嗎?
Can I get everyone's attention?

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,989
威廉姆斯先生 請起立
Mr. Williams please rise.

3
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,339
請舉起你的右手
Please raise your right hand sir.

4
00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:16,751
你能莊嚴的宣誓 你說陳述的證據都是真實的嗎?
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you about to give is the truth.

5
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:20,160
完全真實 沒有半點假話麼?
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.So help you God.

6
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:22,782
-是的 我發誓 -謝謝 請坐
- Yes sir. - Thank you sir. You be seated.

7
00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:29,419
威廉姆斯先生 你能告我們在深海處
Mr. Williams can you please give us your best

8
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:32,105
到底發生了什麼嗎?
recollection of the event on the Deepwater Horizon?

9
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:38,114
九點左右的時候 我正在和我的妻子通話
I was on the phone around 9:30 with my wife.

10
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,993
我聽到了呲呲的響聲
That's when I heard the hissing noise.

11
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:44,388
我聽到了引擎故障的聲音
I heard the engines start to rave.

12
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:47,820
呲呲的響聲變成了轟鳴聲
The hissing turn into a full blown roar.

13
00:00:48,022 --> 00:00:50,029
聲音大的我無法形容
Higher than I can even describe it.

14
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:53,053
幾秒鐘後 就發生了巨大的爆炸
And within second there's a huge explosion.

15
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:56,131
殘片飛的到處都是
Projectiles coming from everywhere.

16
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:58,030
熱浪熱的受不了
The heat was overwhelming.

17
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,975
你能解釋下報警系統是什麼設置的嗎?
Can you please tell me how the Deepwater Horizon alarm system is set up.

18
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:09,394
警報系統是用來通知整個平台的
The general alarm is set up to inform the entire rig of

19
00:01:09,595 --> 00:01:13,001
第一是火災警報 第二是可燃氣體警報
Number one fire number two combustible gas.

20
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:14,732
第三是毒氣警報
Number three toxic gas.

21
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:19,293
每一種的警報聲和警示燈都不一樣
Each condition has a distinct tone and a distinct visual light.

22
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:22,148
在4月20日的晚上
On the eve of April 20th

23
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,262
你是否聽到了警報聲?
Did you hear anyone of those alarm on Deepwater Horizon?

24
00:01:25,463 --> 00:01:26,771
沒有 先生
No sir.

25
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:31,107
你知道為什麼你沒有聽到警報嗎?
Do you know why you never heard that alarm?

26
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:34,653
威廉姆斯先生?
Mr. William?

27
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:36,670
威廉姆斯先生?
Mr. William?

28
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:42,279
深海浩劫
DEEP HORIZON

29
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,722
水下三千英尺
Passing 3000 feet.

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,545
繼續下潛
Continuing down.

31
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:36,665
保持在管道北側
Need to stick to the north side far east.

32
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:38,472
進行掃瞄
Scan on it.

33
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:51,340
還有大約500米的管道待檢
About 500 foot rising up.

34
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:56,103
看到防噴器了
BOP is in the view.

35
00:02:57,105 --> 00:03:00,348
防噴器
Blowout Preventer (BOP)

36
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,996
油井壓力控制和故障防護裝置
PRESSURE WELL CONTROL AND RISK FAILURE

37
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:08,640
孔深3.5千米
Drilling depth 5.6 kilometers.

38
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,288
現在井口怎麼樣?
How's that wellhead service working?

39
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,995
輕微腐蝕 跟我想像的差不多
Minor corrosion not much more than I expected of. Well ahead of it's age.

40
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,599
搞定 讓回來吧.
Allright working. Crank it up.

41
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:03,840
我剛做了個很瘋狂的夢
I just had the craziest dream.

42
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:07,663
喔 喔 堶惘釦睇?
Wow...wow was I in it?

43
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,685
我在..一場音樂會上
I was no...I was at a concert.

44
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:17,435
舞台旁邊有兩隻
and then on the side of the stage there was this

45
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:19,693
兩條腿的兔子
two-legged rabbit.

46
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:21,708
這有什麼可怕的
I don't want no part of it. I want tap out.

47
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,023
聽我說
Listen to me.

48
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:24,781
聽我說
Listen to me.

49
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,523
我一動
I would moved.

50
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:32,304
它就跟著我動
and then he would mimic everthing I was doing.

51
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,094
別說了 我知道接下來會發生什麼
Don't tell me anymore because I know where this is going.

52
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,415
- 我認為這兔子是我媽媽 -媽媽 是的 我知道
- You think the rabbit was my mother. - Mother. Yes I know.

53
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:44,092
多虧了你 這下我也要做噩夢了
I think it was my worst nightmare.Thank you.

54
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:46,099
- 這沒道理 - 好
- It was hostile. - Ok.

55
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,869
- 這是某種預兆 - 我知道了
- It was a hostile rabbit. - I got it.

56
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,353
你要幹什麼?
I'm sorry. What are you doing?

57
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,763
就這樣 你就要離開我21天?
That it? That's how you going to leave me for 21 day's next.

58
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,257
我會和你一起睡
I want you get your sleep.

59
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:02,142
我想你和你做其他的事情
Well I need other things beside sleep.

60
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,645
那你得保證不再提你的媽媽
You have to promise not to bring your mother then.

61
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:07,367
*笑聲*
Hmmm

62
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:10,167
你想要30秒?
So you want the thirty?

63
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,951
60秒?
The sixty?

64
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:14,247
還是90秒的套餐?
Or the ninety seconds package?

65
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,210
我要一整個90秒的套餐.
I'm going to take the whole ninety.

66
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:20,702
這壓力山大啊 壓力好大.
Pressure. Pressure. Pressure.

67
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,289
我會想念你這笑容
I gonna miss that laugh.

68
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:27,123
- 還有這嘴唇
- That mouth.

69
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:34,484
讓我看看你的眼睛
Give me those eyes.

70
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:53,042
我愛你
I love you.

71
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:09,114
我們不是這樣約定的.
This is not our deal dude.

72
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,856
好了 好了
Allright. Allright.

73
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:33,099
你看 你總是高估你的修理技術.
You can see you obviously overestimating your skills as a mechanic.

74
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:36,317
你說什麼?
What was that?

75
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,857
走吧 寶貝
Let's go baby.

76
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,325
- 我來開
- Let me drive. - Uh uh.

77
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:42,066
- 我來開 - 不
- Let me drive. - Nope.

78
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,789
- 我來開 - 不
- Let me drive. - Nope.

79
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:47,128
拜託啦
Pretty please.

80
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:48,896
- 你真想開麼?- 當然
- You really want to drive? - Yeah.

81
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,327
那把你的車賣了 買一輛吧
Then sell that piece of shit and get a Ducatti.

82
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:06,502
喔 厲害.
Wow. Builder not trying to shop.

83
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:15,242
我之所以沒敲門 是因為我還想要個弟弟
I only didn't not knock because I want a brother.

84
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,021
行 真煩
Okay. That's disturbing.

85
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:20,180
你確實什麼都不知道
You're not supposed to know anything about that.

86
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,182
你只知道小孩可愛
You're supposed to just think babies are cute.

87
00:07:22,383 --> 00:07:24,789
- 請你坐下 - 我真的想要個弟弟
- Will you sit down please? - Really I want a brother.

88
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:27,325
做的怎麼樣了?
How's it going?

89
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:29,567
- 親愛的 給你爸爸看看 - 我還沒做好
- Honey show daddy. - I'm not done yet.

90
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:31,444
- 你做的很不錯 -展示一下
- You did such a good job. - It's showtime.

91
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:33,033
那確實很不錯
It's really great.

92
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:35,297
別盯著我看
You can't look at me.

93
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:37,509
為什麼?-因為那讓我覺得不舒服
- Why? - Because it makes me feel uncomfortable.

94
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,248
- 我看著你會讓你不舒服?
- Am i looking at you makes you uncomfortable?

95
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,810
別看著我 我的爸爸叫麥克
Stop. My dad is Mike.

96
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:45,786
他在一個石油鑽井平台工作
He works in a drilling rig that pumps oil out from underneath the ocean.

97
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:49,580
不對 我們並不抽石油 我們是探索者
No no the Deepwater doesn't pump a drop of oil okay. We're the explorers.

98
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:52,022
爸爸和他的朋友們尋找石油
So my dad and his friend finds the oil

99
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:55,486
然後插入管道等古板的隊員過來
and then puts it in all the plumbing so other lamer cruise can come in

100
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:57,219
- 不許亂用詞彙 - 他們就是古板
- Don't say lamer - They're lamer.

101
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,812
古板的隊員什麼都不用做
Okay listen even those lamer dudes they don't have to pump anything remember.

102
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,766
因為石油會自己噴出來.
Because the oil comes rushing out at you.

103
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:04,355
- 行 行 行 -好的 好的 好的
- No no no - Allright allright allright.

104
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:06,678
因為石油是個怪獸
Because that oil is a monster.

105
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,125
就像那些又大又老的恐龍一樣
Like the mean old dinosaur all that oil used to be.

106
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:12,568
所以3億年來
So for 300 million years ...

107
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:16,947
這些恐龍生活的地方越來越小 越來越小
these old dinosaurs have been getting squeeze tighter and tighter tighter

108
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,252
我們懂 沒必要重複那麼多次
We get it. Just use two tighter.

109
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:22,623
因為廣闊的海洋環繞著這點點陸地
Cause they got a miles of earth and ocean pressing down on them.

110
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,832
他們被困在陸地上
They are trapped under it.

111
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:27,852
所以爸爸和他的朋友們在地上打了個洞
So Dad and his friends make a hole on their roof.

112
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:30,702
是的
Yeah!

113
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:33,078
那些又大又老的恐龍才不會信這個的
And these mean old dinosaurs can't believe it.

114
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,021
所以他們涌進洞 然後 砰
So they rush to the new hole. Then smack.

115
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:38,872
撞到一個大機器 那是爸爸和朋友們
They ran into a big machine that he and his friends pump down

116
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:41,215
放在海底的 叫做
from the ocean floor called

117
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,801
- 大個子防護罩? - 防噴器
- Big guy preventer? - Blowout preventer.

118
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:46,680
然後他們撞上了一團泥漿
They run into this stuff called mud.

119
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:49,228
- 對 把它放這兒 他們困在了泥漿
- Allright get it in there.But they cramp on the straw.

120
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:52,617
泥漿又粘又稠 把它們關在了那.
The mud is so thick and heavy it blocks the monster from coming out.

121
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,049
然後他們航行到另一個地方.
And then they sail away to the next.

122
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:58,289
然後那些差勁的隊員再次出現 又做同樣的事情
That's when all the lame-o showed up all happy like they did something.

123
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,490
不准說"差勁"
Don't say lame-o.

124
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:02,358
但是其實是爸爸征服得恐龍
But it was my daddy who tamed the dinosaurs.

125
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,039
- 對! - 是的
- Yeah! - Yeah.

126
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:07,247
太令人驚嘆了-要是你永遠十歲多好
That was amazing. Stay 10 forever please.

127
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:09,254
爸爸 你得送我一塊化石
Daddy you need to get me a fossil.

128
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:10,156
行
I will.

129
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:14,361
我要舉著它說 是我的爸爸打敗了那些恐龍
I want to be able to put it up and say my daddy tamed the dinosaurs.

130
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:17,231
告訴他麥琪的爸爸做了什麼
Tell daddy what Maggie's dad did.

131
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,994
他的爸爸在動物園工作 給她帶了一隻企鵝回來
Her dad works at the zoo and he brought a real penguin.

132
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:22,831
怎麼能這樣!
You can't do that!

133
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:25,562
- 他帶回了一次企鵝 -什麼東西能和真的企鵝比?
- He brought a penguin. - How do you compete with a penguin?

134
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:28,045
- 那你帶回來一塊化石 - 那肯定違規了
- You get a fossil.- There should be rules.

135
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,739
我的天吶
Oh my God.

136

地平線號 這堿O班克斯敦號 請繼續
Deepwater Horizon here Damon Bankston go ahead.

265
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,111
頭想知道你們在這幹嘛
Damon I wants to know what you doing here.

266
00:18:16,313 --> 00:18:20,602
我們就快離開這個大怪獸了
Over here we're getting off this beast and moving on to the next.

267
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:23,406
你可以管它叫婊子... 什麼時候撤
You can call it a bitch. When are we supposed to be leaving?

268
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:26,850
上面通知我說18:00開始壓注泥漿
Well I'm told to be ready to start taking on drilling mud about 18:00

269
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:27,951
哇哦
Wow.

270
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:30,882
聽說早上進行了正壓力試驗
I heard about the positive pressure test this morning.

271
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:33,585
我猜他們認為負壓力測試也會正常
They guess the negative test is going to run just as smooth.

272
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:36,324
-他們告訴我準備好離開 - 他們是誰
- They told me to get ready to start moving on. - Who's they?

273
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:40,176
石油公司的人 我也不清楚
BP company men. Vidrine Kaluza.

274
00:18:40,377 --> 00:18:43,887
我正在等命令去收集你們的泥漿 還有問題嗎
I wait for the order and come pick up your mud. Any other question?

275
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:45,438
沒了 就這樣
No that's it.

276
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:51,161
石油公司的人認為我們已經調試好這條"猛獸"
So BP company men Vidrine and Kaluza are hoping that we have tamed this bitch

277
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:55,349
並且在18:00進行泥漿壓注 對嗎 船長

280
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,282
謝謝你 船長

283
00:19:09,406 --> 00:19:11,604
幫我個忙 去下面找到傑森問問
Can you do me a favor run down to the drill shack

284
00:19:11,805 --> 00:19:16,003
斯倫貝謝的人有沒有做好水泥測試
And ask Jason if those Schlumberger guys did their job. If they run the cement log.

285
00:19:16,775 --> 00:19:18,107

Thank you.

287
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,059
先生們 你們能告訴我寫水泥測試的情況嗎
Gentlemen you couldn't perhaps enlighten me on the cement log situation could you?

288
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:26,419
水泥測試
Cement log?

289
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,808
他們怎麼計劃的 怎麼進行的 到底有沒有做
You know if they're planning it? Running it? Did it?

00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,726
恩
Yeah?

291
00:19:32,484 --> 00:19:34,091
不太清楚 嘿 羅尼
Not really. Hey Ronnie.

292
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:36,545
你的野馬可能是點火方面的問題
Might be the ignition problem on your Mustang.

293
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:38,348
我想可能是火花塞的問題
I'm seeing it maybe failed plug.

294
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:40,604
也可能是某根線或者分油器
Could be a wire. Could be distributer.

295
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:42,697
- 聽起來有沒有跳杠 -沒有

00:19:50,763 --> 00:19:51,764
你知道我的
Do you know me?

300
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:54,476
換擋得悠著點
Oh you gonna start grinding shit out of that clutch I know that.

Insert drill pipe is very funny very funny.

309
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,070
閉嘴

如果我們想晚上走的話 還得安裝不少管子
Got a lot of pipes to pull for if we want to get out of here at night.

318
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:58,792
日常著裝 看起來挺美啊
What's up with the street clothes? You look pretty.

319
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:02,189
傑米挺火大 他想知道水泥測試的情況
Aw man Mr. Jimmy is pissed he wants to know if we got some of that cement bond log test.

320
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,924
不太確定 我想沒有
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

但肯定不聰明

326
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:18,837
瞧 同步小王子們

No Vidrine and Kaluza sent them home without testing anything.

337
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:50,033
- 為什麼他們要這樣做 - 他們也沒跟我說 麥克
- Why the hell would they do that? - I don't feel the urge to take me through their thinking Mike.

338
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:52,109
我覺得吧 就是
But I assume it got something to do with...

339

I got a feeling we're not getting off this well tonight I think nobody is going to be doing no fishing.

368

00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,524
是嗎 有錢人家嗎 記得你老媽曾經說的：
Oh yeah he rich?

395
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,781
「嫁個有錢人生活有保障 寶貝兒」
What yo momma always said "Just as easy to marry a rich man Felicia honey"

396
00:24:56,982 --> 00:24:59,836
要是每次你提到我媽我能得到一塊錢的話
If I had a nickel for every dumb shit my mom said...

397
00:25:00,037 --> 00:25:03,854
我都已經是個富婆了 順道說一句 你得修好這個烤箱
I wouldn't need a rich man.You gotta fix this by the way.

398
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:06,659
等我回來就修 別擔心
I'm going to fix it as soon as I get home. Don't worry.

399
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,474
往電腦這邊走走
Hey come closer to the computer.

400
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,514
過來 電腦這邊
Come over to the computer.

401
00:25:11,189 --> 00:25:12,328
讓我看看你的眼睛
Show me those eyes.

402
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:13,824
你那情況如何
How's everything?

403
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:15,669
每次都一樣 跟地獄一樣
Same shit. Well from hell.

404
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:19,066
-準備好了嗎 -預備 3
You ready? - Three.

405
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,267
2
Two ...

406
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:21,671
-1 - 現在
- One ... - Go!

407
00:25:24,962 --> 00:25:26,286
這張臉
That face.

408
00:25:27,511 --> 00:25:28,943
憤青！
Sociopath.

409
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:33,425
代表著專注 決心 濃烈和衝動
That is focus. That is determination. That is intensity. Drive.

410
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:40,841
- 我贏了 - 討厭你 真討厭
- Hah. - I knew you. I hate it.

411
00:25:41,442 --> 00:25:43,927
- 一會見 -好的 拜拜
- I'll see you soon okay? - Allright. See you.

412
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:47,674
為什麼動我的東西
Who's touching my shit?

413
00:25:48,076 --> 00:25:51,510
別動我我東西 別動我東西
Dont'touch my shit. Don't touch my shit.

414
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,561
他們想讓我們去下一個工作地點
Can I tell you where to hit on our next location?

415
00:25:55,172 --> 00:25:56,307
卡斯基達
Kaskida.

416
00:25:56,908 --> 00:26:00,617
這些你跟公司的人看過嗎 卡魯扎 維德林 任何人
Was this run by anybody BP? Kaluza. Vidrine anybody?

417
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:03,338
維德林跟我確認過 這是他們提出來的
Vidrine right about me. He's come from Virginia.

418
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:08,873
鮑勃 我來告訴你 什麼是最重要的
Bob let me impose upon you what I think is most important here.

419
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:13,467
我們必須在5月16號之前從馬看多趕到卡斯基達
We need to go to Macondo to Kaskida by 16 May.

420
00:26:13,668 --> 00:26:15,619
卡斯基達不同尋常的大
Kaskida is non-common prospect.

421
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:19,446
30-40億桶 比公司的產量都大
3 to 4 billion barrels. That worth more than BP itself.

422
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:20,943
你看我像聖誕老人麼
Do I look like fucking Santa Claus?

423
00:26:21,845 --> 00:26:23,728
你看起來是挺像聖誕老人的
You do look a little like Santa Claus.

424
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:28,836
邁爾斯為密西根打過球 他確實有路易斯安那的風格
Coach Miles may played in Michigan but that boy got Lousiana soul.

425
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:31,045
- 對陣薩班嗎 -是的 因為我們贏了
- That's cause we win dummy.

426
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:33,678
- 好像你上過阿巴瑪大學一樣
Same we like you went to Alabama

427
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:34,562
又沒跟你說.
Did I ask you

428
00:26:34,763 --> 00:26:38,366
當我還小的時候就有人教我邊招手邊說再見
When I was potty training I was taught to flush way before I see you in Tuscaloosa.

429
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,958
當你是當官的呢?在哪兒開小差
You boys working for the government? Clean the clean room..

430
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,900
我們正在準備最後的泥漿 已經超過35MPa壓力了
We're still clearing mud from our last gig. Over 5000 psi. Grab a mop.

431
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,355
太瘋狂了
That's just crazy..

432
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:51,407
看看這次丼涌造成的好事
Look at the pressure did to this drill string during the kick.

433
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,910
該好好表揚下啊
That's one for the trophy case.

434
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:55,365
嘿 帕崔克婸“A有事找我
True that. - Hey Patrick said you got something for me?

435
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:59,209
是的 先生4天前頁岩分離器4出現故障
Yes sir. Before you all took off last time shaky four goes down

436
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:02,597
我查了一下 發現了問題的根源
after poking around we finally found the source of the problem.

437
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,043
你看看 我從去年開始就一直幫你留著
Check this out. I've been hiding this for you since your last hitch.

438
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,981
這是顆牙齒
Is that a tooth?

439
00:27:11,193 --> 00:27:13,752
哇哦 我家小姑娘一定會開心死的
Ho buddy you just made my little girl's year.

440
00:27:13,953 --> 00:27:16,441
她爸爸也一樣 謝謝你 我欠你的
And to her old man. Thank you. I owe you man.

441
00:27:22,214 --> 00:27:23,802
好的 現在開始搭建鑽桿
Well let's put together the kelly.

442
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:25,887
嘿 戈登
Hey Gordon.

443
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,442
嘿 聽了這事你肯定會發瘋的
I'm telling you man it's going to be full-on shift tonight.

444
00:27:29,643 --> 00:27:31,203
他們把斯倫貝謝送回家了
They sent him home.

445
00:27:31,405 --> 00:27:32,405
是的
Yeah.

446
00:27:35,106 --> 00:27:36,722
跟我來 麥克
Walk with me Mike.

447
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:39,320
- 去幹嗎 - 去謀殺公司某個的頭頭
- Where we headed? - Murder some BP company men.

448
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:41,922
- 好的 我這有錘子和螺絲刀 -非常好
- Shit I got hammer screwdriver. - Excellent.

449
00:27:43,338 --> 00:27:46,785
麥克 早上你刷牙了嗎
Mike do you brush your teeth this morning?

450
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:47,710
是的
Yes sir.

451
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,814
- 好孩子 你剔牙了嗎
- Boy did you floss?

452
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:51,409
沒 為啥
No no why?

453
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,572
剔牙會為你將來省錢省心
Save you a lot of pain and money in the long run I tell you.

454
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:59,080
- 吉米要去跟公司的某人發火 - 水泥測試沒有做
- Oh shit Jimmy oh we about to go murder BP guys. - They never ran the cement log..

455
00:27:59,282 --> 00:28:01,747
他們啥也沒做
They sent them home and we're doing shit now we going after the BP.

456
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:03,861
怎麼 欠他們錢嗎
Hey what's the matter? You owe them a lot of money?

457
00:28:04,163 --> 00:28:06,150
來啊 麥克 跟我一起
Come on Mike stay on my hip.

458
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,251
去吧
Get them.

459
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:09,871
上吧 寶貝
Yeah baby.

460
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:13,407
看看第51行 你會看到你的預算上限的
Don look at the line 51. You'll see it cost maximum.

461
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,910
沒看到51啊
I do not see 51.

462
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,999
喔 這不是維德林和卡魯扎本人嗎?
Don Vidrine and Bob Kaluza.

463
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,828
- 歡迎 吉米先生 - 是麼?
- Welcome back Mr. Jimmy. - Yeah

464
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,805
現在我們放置了15立方米的水泥
So we got all 500 cc cement poured down?

465
00:28:25,105 --> 00:28:26,106
是的
Yep.

466
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:28,532
水泥固井是唯一保護我們安全的設施
That cement only thing between us and the blowout.

467
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:30,431
- 已經凝固了嗎 - 是的
- And it's cued? - Yes.

468
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:33,835
時間足夠嗎 要做好這件事是需要花時間的
Had enough time huh? Face time doing it right.

469
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:38,705
如果水泥有問題 那就是問題
I mean that cement job is compromised then everything above it is too.

470
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:41,301
沒事兒 「休斯敦 我們這沒事兒」
It's not compromised you used to don't have a problem.

471
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:44,094
我估計斯倫貝斯也是這麼說的
So I assume Schlumberger guy said the same.

472
00:28:44,295 --> 00:28:46,841
而且拉力試驗也是同樣的結果
Cement bond log they ran say the same huh?

473
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:51,293
我們對水泥的強度是有信心的 是吧
We are confident in the integrity of our cement job are we not?

474
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:54,087
我們確實對水泥固井的生效很有信心
We're quite comfortable with the integrity of that cement. That's true.

475
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:58,152
你就像我爺爺一樣
Just like my grandad.

476
00:28:58,353 --> 00:28:59,353
什麼
Pardon.

477
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:02,927
我爺爺永遠也不去看牙醫
You see my granddaddy he never even went to the dentist.

478
00:29:03,028 --> 00:29:06,040
他不想知道他的牙出了什麼問題.但最後還是得處理它
He didn't want to know what was wrong. Cause then he will have to deal with it.

479
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:09,068
你不想知道水泥到底是不是有問題
You don't want to know that cement job ran as well as shit

480
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:12,345
就因為項目已經超期43天 超預算5000萬了
cause you're 43 days and 50 million dollars overbudget.

481
00:29:12,547 --> 00:29:14,826
這就算有結論了吧 吉米先生
You really shouldn't include yourself now Mr. Jimmy.

482
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:19,428
公司決定開始鑽井 鮑勃 那麼無論結果如何都是你的責任
BP picked this spot to drill Bob.Consequences that's on you guys.

483
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:23,184
當然 我得處理這個爛攤子 所以我也有責任
Of course I got to try and deal with those consequences. So yeah I'm included the point is

484
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:26,135
問題是 他們沒做檢驗就讓回去了
You sent the testing team home before they could do their job.

485
00:29:26,336 --> 00:29:28,665
就因為試驗結果可能不讓他們滿意
Maybe give you all some news you all didn't want to hear.

486
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,754
這個試驗得花他們多少錢 12.50萬
What would it cost you right now? The test? 125 grand?

487
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:35,521
你們公司市值1800億啊 也太小氣了
You're $180 billion dollar company you cheap

488
00:29:35,722 --> 00:29:40,696
我們市值1860億 小氣才能賺更多的錢
That's why we're a $186 billion dollar company We worry about those bills.

489
00:29:40,897 --> 00:29:42,399
我只擔心我的平台
I worry about my rig.

490
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,273
我的人都住在上面 而你們只是租用
My crew lives on it. You just ran it.

491
00:29:45,374 --> 00:29:48,631
丹 我知道我們得停下來做點維護工作
Don. You and I both know we need some downtime for maintenance.

492
00:29:48,814 --> 00:29:51,320
麥克 有多少機器需要檢修了
Mike how many our machines need repair?

493
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:54,147
- 390 吉米先生 - 390
390 Mr. Jimmy. - Three hundred and ninety? - Yes sir.

494
00:29:54,348 --> 00:29:56,647
是的 差不多是全部機械的10%
Almost all the same to those machinery board.

495
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:59,022
- 舉幾個例子 -幾個
Name a few for me. - A few?

496
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:04,224
我想知道有沒有關鍵設備損壞了
I would love to exactly what piece of mission critical equipment are down.

497
00:30:04,425 --> 00:30:05,911
我該從何說起呢
Shit where do I start?

498
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:09,918
鑽井工作站A BOP控制器
A driller chair process station 18 BOP control part

499

drivers control saltwater service pump smoke alarm in the galley

501
00:30:19,305 --> 00:30:22,639
為什麼你會覺得熱呢? 因為這堛漯鬚掑]壞了
The reason why you're sweating so hard is because the compressor on the AC is down too.

502
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:26,082
只有廁所是好的
Everything but the toilet huh?

503
00:30:26,384 --> 00:30:29,446
不是 廁所也壞了 但是那不歸我管
No no you got problem there too but I don't do shitters. That's engineering.

504
00:30:30,526 --> 00:30:31,690
你是幹什麼的?
Who are you?

505
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:34,576
麥克 威廉姆斯 工程師
Mike Williams Chief Electronic Technician.

506
00:30:34,677 --> 00:30:38,012
我來重複一遍我在直升機上跟那些頭頭們說的話
I'm going to tell you what I told your executives on the chopper ride in

507
00:30:38,114 --> 00:30:40,386
他們來了就走了
At the time...

508
00:30:40,587 --> 00:30:43,802
我們得保證平台的正常穩定
We're gonna properly secure this well for production platform

509
00:30:44,002 --> 00:30:47,270
在他們來采油之前
coming right after us and start pumping oil.

510
00:30:47,371 --> 00:30:50,641
不幸的是 這些工作需要時間
Unfortunately to do it properly takes time.

511
00:30:50,742 --> 00:30:52,044
43天
43 days?

512
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:53,863
44天
44 days?

513
00:30:54,064 --> 00:30:55,064
繼續數 鮑勃

46天
46 days?

516
00:30:57,892 --> 00:30:59,361
來塊餅乾 鮑勃
Have a cookie Bob.

517
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,561
沒有水泥測試
Can't run a cement log.

518
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,728
我告訴你我們接下來怎麼辦
I'll tell you what we going to do now.

519
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,821
先做負壓力測試 然後再說其他的
We going to run negative pressure test before we do anything else.

520
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:10,522
如果你真的覺得必要的話
Do you really think we really need to...

521
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:13,135
我認為這很必要 你也應該這麼想
I really think we need one Bob. So should you.

522
00:31:13,236 --> 00:31:17,567
尤其是我們現在也不知道這口井到底穩不穩定
Especially since we got no idea whether this well stable or not.

523
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,497
接通了！ 好日子要來了！
Hey! Dial tone. Day is looking up.

524
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,391
安德森先生 我是吉米
Mr. Anderson it's Mr. Jimmy.

525
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:28,830
我們要做負壓力測試 從3000米開始
We're going to run negative pressure test start tripping out 3 000 ft of pipe.

526
00:31:29,195 --> 00:31:30,195
謝謝
Thank you.

527
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:34,526
43天延誤
Days behind schedule: 43 days.

528
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:48,161
小伙子 不好意思 我要找麥克 威廉姆斯
Young man. Pardon me. Can you please tell me where I can find Mr. Mike Williams?

529
00:31:48,362 --> 00:31:50,987
是的 在維修站 飯廳隔壁
Yes sir. He is in the ET shops on the second deck by the coffee shop.

530
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:52,929
- 謝謝 - 午安 先生
- Thank you very much. - Have a good one for the day sir.

531
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:54,231
你也是
And you sir.

532
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,605
威廉姆斯先生
Mr. Williams?

533
00:32:01,268 --> 00:32:02,807
維德森先生 迷路了
Mr. Vidrine are you lost?

534
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:04,517
沒
Not at all.

535
00:32:04,818 --> 00:32:08,382
就是來找你聊聊
Just looking to come by and visit with you for a minute.

536
00:32:08,683 --> 00:32:10,099
有什麼我能幫你的麼>
How can I help?

537
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,294
只是感覺會上你還有話要說
Seems as though you had something more you wanted to say in there.

538
00:32:14,495 --> 00:32:17,385
說來我聽聽
I thought I give you the time to say it.

539
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:26,518
所以這台鑽機壞了
Okay. So this rig is broke?

540
00:32:26,632 --> 00:32:29,025
- 我可沒這樣說 -感覺你就這意思
- I didnt' say that. - Sounds like you did.

541
00:32:30,128 --> 00:32:32,048
維德森先生你來我這到底幹什麼?
Is there a reason why you in my shop Mr. Vidrine?

542
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:35,695
我們公司是個超大規模的公司 麥克
We a big company Mike. BP.

543
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:39,532
一個複雜而龐大的組織
Very big complex organization.

544
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:42,503
有無數的小部件協同工作
A lot of moving parts. Millions moving parts.

545
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:45,384
有成千上萬的員工
Thousands upon thousands of people.

546
00:32:46,086 --> 00:32:50,172
我們非常努力的試圖保持這些人
And we all work very hard to ensure that all those people.

547
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:54,758
這些部門都能正常工作 從而得到一個最好的結果
All those movement parts are fuctioning properly as a mean to an ends.

548
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:57,298
一個可以掙錢的結果
A very profitable win for all of us.

549
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,167
當然了 這是宏偉的目標
They the big picture.

550
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:04,138
但是也有不一樣的 就像你們這些只看眼前的
They the little picture. Like you and the malfunctioned shitters.

551
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:08,571
問題在於 所有一切都是相互影響的
Don't you see point of fact they all kind of interconnected.

552
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:10,798
像流動的水一樣
They flow but working Mike.

553
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:12,766
如果你這有問題 那一切都有問題
So if you off it's off.

554
00:33:12,969 --> 00:33:17,815
我也有問題 都有問題 整個項目就停了
Then I'm off. Then we off. Then the whole damn train is off.

555
00:33:18,617 --> 00:33:20,669
明白我的意思嗎 威廉姆斯先生
You feel me Mr. Williams?

556
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:23,010
你吃藥了嗎? 維德森先生
You on medication Mr. Vidrine?

557
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:28,125
我只是在評估 我們這趟火車
I'm merely trying to assess just how close this train

558
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:30,304
離脫軌還有多近
is hugging the track.

559
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,834
好吧 我明白
Okay I hear you.

560
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,107
- 想聽我的意見 -恩
You want my take? I mean you really want my take.- I do.

561
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:40,578
好吧 你這是試圖讓飛機在降落的時候正好用完油
I think you all trying to run out of fuel as the wheels touch down.

562
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,324
那可不是個好主意
Running on gasoline as the plane land is not smart.

563
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:47,805
這可不是明智之舉 這是一種僥倖
It's flawed thinking. It's hope as a tactic.

564
00:33:49,051 --> 00:33:53,113
記住了 謝謝
Duly noted and much appreciated sir.

565
00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:55,807
這僅僅是個小員工的小意見
Just the opinion of little guy.

566
00:33:57,348 --> 00:33:59,037
那是鯰魚嗎
That a catfish?

567
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:01,842
恩 65磅
Yeap. 65 pounds.

568
00:34:02,044 --> 00:34:04,240
你們怎麼釣的
What it all caught at? Nibbling?

569
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,190
手抓 直接用手抓魚
Noodling. We noodle for catfish.

570
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:10,756
有趣的是 我跟我哥們去抓魚的時候
You know that's funny. Cause when we go noodling

571
00:34:10,857 --> 00:34:13,860
我們去到湖上 點上燈
Your best way to fish is the lake. We walk down the boat ramp.

572
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:17,407
找到最大最黑的洞伸手去掏
We look for the biggest darkest blackest hole we can stick our arm in.

573
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:20,592
希望這些鯰魚能咬住我們的手
We hope those big son of bitches bite down on us as hard as he can.

574
00:34:20,794 --> 00:34:22,402
這樣我們才能把它抓出來
So we can rip his ass out of that hole

575
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:25,607
我們希望被咬 被咬才能抓到魚
We want to get bit. That's the plan.

576
00:34:25,808 --> 00:34:27,963
區別在於 我們已經做好被咬的準備了
Difference is we're ready for that bite.

577
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:33,572
我們有合適的鞋子 帽子 手套 墨鏡 並且做好了一切準備
We are ready. I'm wearing shoes hat gloves golf cap sunglasses and we are ready.

578
00:34:33,673 --> 00:34:37,567
我可不會不做準備的就把手伸進去然後祈求老天保佑
I don't stick my hand with that monster and hope for the best.

579
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,287
沒準備的空想目標是不現實的 丹
Uh huh. Hope ain't a tactic Don.

580
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:46,966
耽誤你時間了
I thank you for your time.

581
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,414
- 祝你順利 先生 - 你也是
- Have a wonderful day sir. - And you.

582
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:52,464

- Damon B. Bankson ... - Is that your fifth cup?

592
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:24,921
隨便問問
Just saying.

593
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:27,663
去看看 確認一切準備就緒
Why don't you go ahead and make sure they ready to get after it.

594
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:29,474
這可能是最終測試了
This might be the final test.

595

收到
Roger that.

596

- 又一次負壓測試 -又一次

解釋給我聽聽
Flowing out of that pipe. Now explain that to me.

651

652
00:40:16,903 --> 00:40:20,161
我跟卡扎魯已經討論了無數次關於這些鑽井管到了
Kaluza and I have talked about this drill pipe.

00:40:22,644 --> 00:40:27,686
是有些奇怪的地方 他管它叫膀胱效應
There's something off with it. He says it's a bladder effect.

654
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:28,989
膀胱效應
Bladder effect?

655
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,984
恩 傑森應該知道是什麼意思
Bladder effect. He said Jason would know what he's talking about.

656
00:40:33,185 --> 00:40:35,358
壓力表沒有顯示溢出
I say that flow right there.

657
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:36,160
是的
Right.

658
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:37,162
看這邊
Look at here.

659
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:39,195
嘿 別擦我們還有用呢
Hey! We actually needed that.

660
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:41,827
膀胱效應
Bladder effect.

661
00:40:42,028 --> 00:40:45,309
有一個壓力團
It is a pocket of pressure

662
00:40:46,634 --> 00:40:49,187
阻塞在放噴口附近
trapped around the annular

663
00:40:49,388 --> 00:40:52,066
被傳感器誤讀成鑽井管到壓力
which reeks like drill pressure

664
00:40:52,268 --> 00:40:56,727
因為這些壓力就被阻塞在那
because it is trapped right there

665
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:58,380
傳感器的附近
sitting right there on the sensor.

666
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,805
如果這個確確實實的壓力問題
If this was a legitimate pressure issue

667
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:07,520
泥漿應該會從鑽井管到堿y上來
the we would have mud flowing right back
up and out of that drill pipe right there.

668
00:41:07,822 --> 00:41:09,941
我們怎麼驗證這個情況呢
Now how we going to test this?

669
00:41:10,143 --> 00:41:13,411
需要重複一次負壓試驗
We going to run that negative pressure test again.

670
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:17,212
只是這次在壓井管進行 而不是鑽井管
But we going to run it on the kill line. Not on the drill pipe.

671
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:20,193
很顯然 鑽井管現在有問題
Obviously our problem is with that drill pipe.

672
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:22,309
不可能
You cannot have

673
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:27,137
有如此大的壓力
13 095 pounds of pressure per square inch

674
00:41:27,373 --> 00:41:30,080
大道可以把車劈成兩半
enough to cut your car in half.

675
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:35,710
還不把泥漿從管道中壓出
and not have any fluid being forced up and out of that pipe by that pressure.

676
00:41:38,018 --> 00:41:42,257
兄弟們 你們鞋上有泥漿嗎 有嗎
Boys do you have a whole mess of drilling mud on your boots out there?

677
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:43,258
嘿 丹
Hey Don.

678
00:41:47,196 --> 00:41:48,764
堶悼縝b吵的有點火熱
It got hot in the drill shack.

679
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:51,704
我們有問題 是鑽井管的問題
We have a problem with that drill pipe.

680
00:41:51,905 --> 00:41:56,060
還是傳感器給了錯誤的讀數
or with the sensor giving us a false reading.

681
00:41:57,218 --> 00:42:01,826
還是說 下面千萬個部件都可能有問題了
Or any other of a thousands moving parts down there.

682
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:04,310
怎麼才能知道呢
Now the way we going to find out

683
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:08,198
在壓井管上在做一次負壓試驗
is run that negative pressure test on the kill line.

684
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:11,063
如果壓力是0 吉米先生
and if there is zero pressure Mr. Jimmy

685
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:14,299
真相也就大白了
Then that is going to tell us all we need to know.

686
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:16,152
同意
Are we in agreement?

687
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:19,647
同不同意不知道 不過再做一次試驗也是無關痛癢
I don't know about agreement. Never hurts to run a test.

688
00:42:19,848 --> 00:42:20,649
好滴(?▽︿*)))
Look.

689
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,970
這兒情況如何 Jimmy先生
How we doing here Mr. Jimmy?

690
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:25,691
不錯 不是嘛 don
We're doing great aren't we Don?

691
00:42:26,693 --> 00:42:27,794
是的是的
Yes we are.

692
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:33,949
公司的油井
BP's well.

693
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,356
是的
It is.

694
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:41,813
- 公司的石油 -恩
- Bp's oil. - Indeed.

695
00:42:42,378 --> 00:42:45,507
我們只是來僱傭的工人而已
We just to help you all hire a driller hole.

696
00:42:45,909 --> 00:42:47,889
說得對 吉米先生
You are correct Mr. Jimmy.

697
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:51,941
但是我們已經延期50天 洞也沒打好
But we 50 days late. And the hole ain't drilling.

698
00:42:53,775 --> 00:42:56,680
吉米先生 廚房有點小問題
Now Mr. Jimmy we have issue in the galley.

699
00:42:57,413 --> 00:43:01,020
一點安全問題 - 不會耽誤你太久
- A whole bunch of people. A safety issue. - It won't take but a minute.

700
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:14,734
是延遲43天 不是50天 簡單的數學問題
That's are 43 days not 50. Simple mathematics.

701
00:43:14,877 --> 00:43:18,754
既定目標是3月8號 今天4月20號 43天
Where your completion date was March 8. It's 20th April today. 43 days.

702
00:43:18,955 --> 00:43:19,955
恩
Yep.

703
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:23,247
我還以為你們這些就知道掙錢的油老闆們數學應該不錯
I thought you money greedy sons of bitch at least good at math.

704
00:43:23,548 --> 00:43:24,941
好吧 先生們
Allright gentlemen.

705
00:43:25,342 --> 00:43:28,810
繼續 杜威 在壓井管上進行負壓試驗
Oh hey Dewey. Negative pressure test on the kill line.

706
00:43:29,011 --> 00:43:30,123
轉移到壓井管測試
Switching to kill line test.

707
00:43:30,325 --> 00:43:32,849
開始壓井管壓力測試
Initiating kill line pressure test.

708
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,050
膀胱效應
Bladder effect.

709
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,472
你覺得靠譜嗎
It ran true to you?

710
00:43:36,973 --> 00:43:41,595
雖然丹 維德森這人滿口謊言 不過我覺得還行
Well that came out of Vildrine's mouth that rang true to me. Yeah.

711
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:45,613
我是說 從原理上看
I mean on it's face yeah.

712
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,641
還是有點道理的 不過呢
There's a logic to it. It's got merit. But

713
00:43:49,143 --> 00:43:52,378
我也說不清楚 對壓井管做壓力測試
I don't apply to kill pipes and kill lines

714
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,824
- 有點太高深了 對我來說 -至少應該看到點泥漿
- A little above my paygrade. - We should've seen some mud.

715
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:22,445
壓力警報
Pressure alert.

716
00:44:23,046 --> 00:44:25,683
壓井管壓力讀數

717
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:42,199
好！幹得好！
Yes! Good job!

718
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,315
地平線號將受到公司最高級別的安全表彰
The Deepwater Horizon is receiving BP's highest safety award.

719
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:47,912
連續7年
for the seventh straight year.

720
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:52,598
一切都從吉米先生接手開始
And it all starts at the top. The man you call Mr. Jimmy

721
00:44:56,353 --> 00:44:57,565
吉米先生.吉米
Mr. Jimmy Mr. Jimmy.

722
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:58,667
請致辭
Speech.

723
00:45:17,252 --> 00:45:20,659
保持在0 老闆 測試通過了 沒有殘留壓力
He held at zero boss. Good test. No pressure.

724
00:45:20,961 --> 00:45:23,794
恭喜 通過測試了
Congratulations good test.

725
00:45:23,996 --> 00:45:27,808
鑽井管媮椄O很大的壓力
We still got 14 000 psi on the drill line.

726
00:45:28,009 --> 00:45:30,950
鑽井管和壓井管必須是相等的
Drill line and the kill line should be exactly the same.

727
00:45:31,138 --> 00:45:32,413
應該一模一樣
They should all be lined up.

728
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:35,310
我們已經知道鑽井管埵麻I問題
We already agreed to test something wrong with the drill line.

729
00:45:35,512 --> 00:45:36,908
為啥還在糾結這個
Why do you keep coming back to it?

730
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,688
我也不知道 這行干太多有經驗了
I don't know. Good old field practice.

731
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:42,994
沒有泥漿 沒有泥流 我們必須開始了
No mud. No flow. We got to go.

732
00:45:43,896 --> 00:45:47,410
最快什麼時候可以把井準備好
Now how quick can we lock the dough on this well?

733
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:51,095
通知吉米先生之前我什麼也不會做
I'm not doing nothing until Mr. Jimmy is made aware.

734
00:45:53,123 --> 00:45:56,656
你還是個有主意的成年人麼
Is there a man in you? Is there an adult?

735
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,944
穿的人模狗樣 工作服一套 工作鞋一穿
The dip. The steel toes.

736
00:46:04,145 --> 00:46:05,565
都他媽的扯淡
But it's all bullshit.

737
00:46:05,867 --> 00:46:09,075
壓井管塈馴沒壓力啊
We got zero pressure on the kill line.

738
00:46:09,276 --> 00:46:11,524
膽小如鼠的貨
You nervous as cat.

739
00:46:11,725 --> 00:46:15,004
一點有擔當的決定都不敢做
Afraid to make it work at every turns.

740
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:18,517
等我回去我就這麼匯報給我上級
That will be my summary back to my bosses in London.

741
00:46:18,718 --> 00:46:19,719
鮑勃
Bob?

742
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:22,111
同意
Agreed.

743
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:28,821
行吧 你通知吉米先生吧
Again you can call Mr. Jimmy.

744
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:33,576
我就不耽誤你們吃冰淇淋了 謝謝
And I no longer keep you from your ice cream for another second. Thanks.

745
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,970
- 我是吉米 - 我做了負壓試驗
- This Mr. Jimmy. - We ended the negative test.

746
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,327
實驗結果沒問題 沒壓力
It was good test. We got no pressure.

747
00:46:41,275 --> 00:46:44,032
準備開始下一步動作了 跟你確認一下
I'm about to start in this place. I want your blessing.

748
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:45,434
你確定嗎 jason
You sure about this Jason?

749
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:49,844
壓井管測試正常 我能確定的只有這個
Kill line was good. It was all nothing I'm sure.

750
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:54,289
他們在催我 我該怎麼做
This guys are all over me. What you want to do?

751
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,320
沒泥流 對不
Zero flow correct?

752
00:46:57,421 --> 00:46:58,903
對 沒泥流
It's correct. No flow.

753
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:12,128
可以繼續了
Are we good?

754
00:47:14,182 --> 00:47:16,356
好吧 又是慢慢長夜了估計
Well it's looks like it's going to be a long night.

755
00:47:17,545 --> 00:47:21,369
傑森 你先盯著 我半小時過去找你 謝謝
You stay on top of it Jason. I see you on top about half an hour. Thanks.

756
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:27,306
好吧 兄弟們 測試通過了
Okay guys. Good test.

757
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:28,347
好耶！
Yahoo.

758
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:30,794
準備加注10000桶泥漿
Get ready to pull out 10 000 barrels of mud.

759
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:34,776
夜班開始前我得去沖個澡
I think I'm going to take a shower and wash my day off before I start my night.

760
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,974
- 漫漫長夜 恩 - 去吃點冰淇淋唄 麥克
- It's gonna be long night. - Get some ice cream Mike.

761
00:47:37,175 --> 00:47:38,435
我得保持體形
I'm gonna watch my figure.

762
00:47:38,637 --> 00:47:41,727
我去修幾個煙霧報警器吧要不感覺我要打人了
I'll go fix up some smoke detectors before I'm about to pop somebody in the mouth.

763
00:47:41,928 --> 00:47:44,950
好主意 待我向felicia問好
That's a good idea. Say hi to Felicia for me.

764
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,952
- 吉米先生 -恩
- Mr. Jimmy? - Yes?

765
00:47:46,153 --> 00:47:47,455
拿著
We really need you in this.

766
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:49,645
- 拍張照 -哦 拍張照
- Just a picture.

767
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:50,735
吉米先生
Alright Mr. Jimmy.

768
00:47:50,836 --> 00:47:53,811
- 恭喜你 jimmy先生1 - 謝謝兄弟們
Hey appreciate it a lot guys.

769
00:47:58,229 --> 00:47:59,625
你拍了嗎
Did you take the picture?

770
00:48:05,459 --> 00:48:06,472
檢查的怎麼樣了?
Help me check the house.

771
00:48:07,581 --> 00:48:08,382
試驗通過了
We got a good test.

772
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:12,425
開始轉移泥漿 送到班克斯敦號那邊去
We start sending us some mud. Transfer them to Bankston.

773
00:48:12,526 --> 00:48:13,528
收到
Copy that.

774
00:48:14,129 --> 00:48:16,549
膽小如鼠 老鼠膽子才不小
Nervous as cat. Cat ain't scare.

775
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:19,738
我以前見過老鼠對著貓唬呢
I had a cat named Oscar used to try to mount my Labrador.

776
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:21,416
打開環形防噴器
i'm opening the annular.

777
00:48:21,717 --> 00:48:23,849
希望這頭野獸還沒醒
Let's hope that monster ain't awake.

778
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:27,973
泥漿泵正常工作
Mud pumps are on.

779
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,798
從油井娷鉦儐d漿
Removing heavy mud from well.

780
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,849
存儲到2號泥漿倉
Displacement Holding in Tank 2.

781
00:48:33,051 --> 00:48:34,201
4%
Four percent ...

782
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:36,009
同志們 測試通過了！
Boys we got a good test.

783
00:48:36,111 --> 00:48:38,439
帥氣！ 加注泥漿吧
Let's pump out all these mud.

784
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,402
搞定了/We're done.

785
00:48:47,503 --> 00:48:52,042
我們就要回家了
We're going home.
