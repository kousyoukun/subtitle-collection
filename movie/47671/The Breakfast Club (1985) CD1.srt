Dear Mr. Vernon...

32
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,550
We accept that
we had to sacrifice...

33
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,790
a whole Saturday in detention
for whatever it was we did wrong.

34
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,690
What we did was wrong...

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,790
but we think you're crazy
to make us write an essay...

36
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,890
telling you who we think we are.

37
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,960
What do you care?

You see us as you want to see us...

in the simplest terms,
the most convenient definitions.

40
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,970
You see us as a brain...

41
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,310
an athlete...

42
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,720

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,090
and a criminal.

45
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,920
Correct?

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,730
That's the way we saw each other
at 7:00 this morning.

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,630
We were brainwashed.

48
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,880
I can't believe
you can't get me out of this.

49
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,550
It's so absurd
I have to be here on a Saturday.

50
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,550
It's not like
I'm a defective or anything.

51
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,460
I'll make it up to you.

52
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,020
Honey, ditching class to go shopping
doesn't make you a defective.

53
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,030
Have a good day.

54
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,860
Is this the first
or last time we do this?

55
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,340

Mom, we're not supposed to study.

58
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,210
- Mister, you figure out a way to study.
- Yeah.

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,010
Well, go!

60
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,630
Hey, I screwed around.

61
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,130
There's nothing
wrong with that...

62
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,130
except you got caught, sport.

63
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, Mom already
reamed me, all right?

You want to miss a match?
Blow your ride?

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,700
No school is going to give
a scholarship to a discipline case.

66
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,460
Well, well.
Here we are.

67
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,970
I want to congratulate you
for being on time.

68
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,840
Excuse me, sir?
I think there's been a mistake.

69
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,280
I know it's detention, but, um,
I don't think I belong in here.

70
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,550
It is now 7:06.

71

You may not talk.

74
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,790
You will not move
from these seats.

75
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,570
And you...

76
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,630
will not sleep.

77
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,470
All right, people, we're going to
try something different today.

78
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,220
We are going to write an essay...

79
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,890
of no less than 1,000 words...

80
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,120
describing to me
who you think you are.

81
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,830
- Is this a test?
- When I say "essay," I mean essay.

82
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,600
I do not mean a single word
repeated 1,000 times.

83
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,670
Is that clear, Mr. Bender?

84
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,600
- Crystal.
- good.

85
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,150
Maybe you'll learn a little something
about yourself.

86
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,880
Maybe you'll even decide
whether you care to return.

87
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,920
You know,
I can answer that right now, sir.

88
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,720
- That'd be "no" for me, because--

Any monkey business is ill-advised.
Any questions?

92
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,870
Yeah, I got a question.

93
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,000
Does Barry Manilow know
you raid his wardrobe?

94
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,240
I'll answer that, Mr. Bender,
next Saturday.

- Oh, god, you richies are so smart.

164
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,740
That's exactly why I'm not heavy
into activities.

165
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,080
- You're a big coward.
- I'm in the math club.

166
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,680
You're afraid you don't belong,
so you just dump all over it.

167
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,120
It wouldn't have
anything to do with...

168
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,860
you activities people
being assholes, would it?

169
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,590
You wouldn't know.
You don't know any of us.

170
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,000
Well, I don't know
any lepers either...

171
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,260
but I'm not joining
their fucking clubs.

172
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,170
- Watch the mouth.
- I'm in the physics club too.

173
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,510
Excuse me a sec.
What are you babbling about?

174
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,570
What I said was that...

175
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,950
I'm in the math club, the Latin club
and the physics club. Physics club.

176
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,750
Hey. Cherry.

177
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,290
- Do you belong to the physics club?
- That's an academic club.

178
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,980
So?

179
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,930
So academic clubs aren't
the same as other kinds of clubs.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,300
Ah, but to dorks
like him, they are.

181
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,740
What do you guys do in your club?

182
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,470
In physics, well, we talk about
physics, uh, properties of physics.

183
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,540
So it's sort of social.

184
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,740
Demented and sad,
but social, right?

185
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,150
I guess you could consider it
a social situation.

186
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,210
Um, there are
other children in my club.

187
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,490
And, uh, at the end of the year,
we have, um...

188
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,130
- a big banquet at the Hilton.
- You load up. You party.

189
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,830
No. We get dressed up,
but we don't get high.

190
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,770
Only burners like you get high.

191
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,210
I didn't have shoes,
so I had to borrow my dad's.

192
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,940
My mom doesn't like me to wear
other people's shoes.

193
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,710
My cousin Kendall
from lndiana got high once.

194
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,940
He started eating, like,
really weird foods...

195
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,680
and then he felt
like he didn't belong anywhere.

196
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,050
Kind of "Twilight Zone," kinda.

197
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,110
Sounds like you.

198
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,350
You guys keep talking
and Vernon's gonna come in here.

199
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,490
I got a meet Saturday, and I'm not
missing it because of you boneheads.

200
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,790
Oh, wouldn't that be a bite, huh?

201
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,800
Missing a whole wrestling meet?

202
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,960
You wouldn't know about it, faggot.

203
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,030
You never competed
in your life.

204
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,900
Oh, I know.
I feel all empty inside.

205
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,380
I have such a deep admiration for guys
who roll around with other guys.

206
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,940
You'd never miss it.
You don't have any goals.

207
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,850
- But I do.
- Yeah?

208
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,680
I want to be just like you.

209
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,450
I figure all I need's
a lobotomy and some tights.

210
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,490
You wear tights?

211
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,030
No, I don't wear tights.

212
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,560
I wear the required uniform.

213
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,790
Tights.

214
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,130
Shut up.

215
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,440
Ooh.

216
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,050
There's not supposed to
be any monkey business.

217
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,610
Young man, have you
finished your paper?

218
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,160
Bender, don't screw around.

219
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,460
- What are you gonna do?
- Drop dead, I hope.

220
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,170
All right!

221
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,370
Bender, that's school property.

222
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,040
It doesn't belong to us.
It's not to be toyed with.

223
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,990
- Very funny. Fix it.
- You should fix that.

224
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,050
- Am I a genius?
- No, you're an asshole.

225
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,620
- Funny guy. Everyone, just shh.
- Fix the door, Bender!

226
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,460
- I know what I'm doing.
- Fix the door!

227
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,020
Shut up!

228
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,690
[ Vernon ] goddamn it!

229
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,030
Why is that door closed?

230
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,330
Why is that door closed!

231
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,070
How are we supposed to know?
We can't move, right?

232
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,050
Why?

233
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,520
We're just sitting here,
like we're supposed to.

234
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,720
Who closed that door?

235
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,560
- I think a screw fell out of it.
- It just closed, sir.

236
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,900
- Who!
- Aah!

237
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,130
- She doesn't talk, sir.
- Eek!

238
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,300
- give me that screw.
- I don't have it.

239
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,670
You want me
to shake it out of you?

240
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,080
I don't have it.
Screws fall out all the time.

241
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,740
- The world's an imperfect place.
- give it to me, Bender.

242
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,810
- Sir, why would anybody steal a screw?
- Watch it, young lady.

243
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,520
The door's way too heavy, sir.

244
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,430
Damn it!

245
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,310
Andrew Clark, get up here.

246
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,850
Front and center.
Let's go.

247
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,050
- How come Andrew gets to get up?
- [ Vernon ] That's right.

248
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,390
If he gets up, we'll all get up.
It'll be anarchy.

249
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,350
- Okay, watch the magazines.
- [ Bender ] It's out of my hands.

250
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,670
That's very clever, sir...

251
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,070
but what if there's a fire?

252
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,170
I think violating fire codes...

253
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,240
and endangering the lives
of children would be unwise...

254
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,300
at this juncture
in your career, sir.

255
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,080
What are you doing?
get this out, for god's sake.

256
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:33,590
- What's the matter with you?
- The school's equipped with fire exits.

257
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,960
- Show Dick some respect.
- Let's go.

258
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,530
get in your seat.

259
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,800
I expected more
from a varsity letterman.

260
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,940
You're not fooling anybody, Bender.

261
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,940
The next screw that
falls out will be you.

262
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,640
Eat my shorts.

263
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,040
What was that?

264
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,210
Eat...

265
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,340
my...

266
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,610
shorts.

267
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,680
You just bought
another Saturday, mister.

268
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,550
Oh, I'm crushed.

269
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,420
- One more right there.
- I'm free the next Saturday.

270
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,690
- Beyond that, I'll check my calendar.
- good! It's gonna be filled.

271
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,390
We'll keep going.
You want another one?

272
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,900
Say the word. Just say it.

273
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,460
Instead of going to prison,
you'll come here.

274
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,870
- Are you through?
- No.

275
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,930
- I'm doing society a favor.
- So?

276
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,740
That's another!

277
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,650
I've got you the rest of your life
if you don't watch it.

278
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,710
- You want another?
- Yes.

279
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,950
You got it!
That's another one, pal.

280
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,080
Cut it out!

281
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,650
- Stop.
- You through?

282
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,460
- Not even close, bud.
- good!

283
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,620
- You got one more.
- You really think I give a shit?

284
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,600
Another.

285
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,930
- You through?
- How many is that?

286
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,370
That's seven including the first one
when you asked...

287
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,930
whether Barry Manilow knew
he raided his closet.

288
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,500
- Now it's eight. Stay out of it.
- Sir, it's seven.

289
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,570
Shut up, peewee.

290
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,810
You're mine, Bender.
For two months, I got you.

291
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,010
I got you.

292
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,150
What can I say?
I'm thrilled.

293
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,160
That's exactly what you
want them to believe.

294
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,890
You know something?

295
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,630
You should spend more time
doing something with yourself...

296
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,360
and less time trying
to impress people.

297
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,170
Might be better off.

298
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,170
Right, that's it!

299
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,470
I'll be outside those doors.

300
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,140
The next time I have to come in here,
I'm cracking skulls.

301
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,450
Fuck you!

302
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,360
Fuck.

303
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,670
Wake up!

304
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,270
Who has to go to the lavatory?

305
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,030
That's real intelligent.

306
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,540
You're right.

307
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,010
It's wrong to destroy literature.

308
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,980
It's such fun to read.

309
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,440
And...

310
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,550
"Molay" really pumps my 'nads.

311
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,920
Moliere.

312
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,050
I love his work.

313
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,730
Big deal.

314
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,170
Nothing to do,
locked in a vacancy.

315
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,260
Ah, speak for yourself.

316
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,310
You think I'd speak for you?

317
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't know your language.

318
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,410
Hey...

319
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,780
you grounded tonight?

320
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,310
I don't know. My mom said I was,
but my dad said to blow her off.

321
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,330
There's a big party at Stubby's.
Parents are in Europe.

322
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,560
- It should be pretty wild.
- Yeah?

323
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,590
- Yeah. Are you going to go?
- I doubt it.

324
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,760
How come?

325
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,830
If I disobey my mother,
it's because my father says it's okay.

326
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,070
It's like this whole monster deal.
It's endless and a total drag.

327
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,880
- Any minute, divorce.
- Who do you like better?

328
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,850
- What?
- You like your old man better?

329
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,550
- They're both screwed.
- I mean if you had to choose.

330
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,620
I don't know.

331
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,350
I'd probably go live
with my brother.

332
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,500
I don't think either one
gives a shit about me.

333
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,630
They use me to get back
at each other.

334
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,030
Ha!

335
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,410
Shut up!

336
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,040
- You're feeling sorry for yourself.
- If I didn't, nobody else would.

337
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,810
You're breaking my heart.

338
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,550
- Sporto?
- What?

339
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,650
You get along with your parents?

340
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,320
If I say yes,
I'm an idiot, right?

341
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,730
You're an idiot anyway...

342
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,460
but if you say yes,
you're a liar too.

343
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,240
You know something, man?

344
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,040
If we weren't in school right now,
I'd waste you.

345
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,950
Can you hear this?

346
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,550
You want me to turn it up?

347
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,120
Hey, fellas, I mean--

348
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,780
I don't like my parents, either.
I mean, I don't--

349
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,720
I mean, I don't get along
with them when...

350
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,700
their idea of parental compassion
is just, you know...

351
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,970
wacko, you know?

352
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
- Dork.
- Yeah?

353
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,200
You are a parent's wet dream, okay?

354
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,310
That's the problem.

355
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,540
Look, I can see you're getting
all bunged up...

356
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,780
for them making you wear
these clothes...

357
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,880
but, face it,
you're a neo-maxi-zoom-dweeby.

358
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,620
What would you do if you weren't out
making yourself a better citizen?

359
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,920
Why do you have to
insult everybody?

360
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,350
I'm being honest, asshole.

361
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,630
I would expect you
to know the difference.

362
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,570
- Well, he's got a name.
- Yeah?

363
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,970
Yeah. What's your name?

364
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,030
- Brian.
- See?

365
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,370
My condolences.

366
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,410
What's your name?

367
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,710
What's yours?

368
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,650
- Claire.
- Claire?

369
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,590
- Claire. It's a family name.
- It's a fat girl's name.

370
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,320
- Thank you.
- Your welcome.

371
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,690
- I'm not fat.
- Not now...

372
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,060
but I can see you really
pushing maximum density.

373
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,460
You see, I'm not sure
if you know this...

374
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,870
but there are
two kinds of fat people.

375
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,200
There's fat people
that were born to be fat...

376
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,610
and fat people that were
once thin but became fat.

377
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,840
When you look at them, you can
sorta see that thin person inside.

378
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,610
You're gonna get married,
squeeze out a few puppies and then...

379
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,440
Oh.

380
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,050
Obscene finger gestures
from such a pristine girl.

381
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,460
I'm not that pristine.

382
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,260
Are you a virgin?

383
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,370
I'll bet you
a million dollars that you are.

384
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,740
Let's end the suspense.

385
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,780
Is it gonna to be
a white wedding?

386
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,940
Why don't you just shut up?

387
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,990
Have you kissed
a boy on the mouth?

388
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,220
Have you ever been felt up...

389
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,490
over the bra...

390
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,150
under the blouse...

391
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,090
shoes off...

392
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,760
hoping to god
your parents don't walk in?

393
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,270
Do you want me to puke?

394
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,900
Over the panties...

395
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,780
no bra...

396
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,440
blouse unbuttoned...

397
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,110
Calvin's in a ball on the front seat
past 11:00 on a school night?

398
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,580
Leave her alone.

399
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,600
I said leave her alone.

400
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,470
You going to make me?

401
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,710
Yeah.

402
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,210
You and how many
of your friends?

403
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,550
Just me.

404
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,080
Just you and me.

405
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,990
Two hits. Me hitting you.
You hitting the floor.

406
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,050
Anytime you're ready, pal.

407
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,440
I don't want to get
into this with you, man.

408
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,330
Why not?

409
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,800
'Cause I'd kill you.

410
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,680
It's real simple.

411
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,150
I'd kill you, and your
fucking parents would sue me.

412
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,090
And it'd be a big mess, and I don't
care enough about you to bother.

413
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,690
Chicken shit.

414
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,370
Let's end this now.

415
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,600
You don't talk to her.

416
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,700
You don't look at her.

417
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,050
And you don't even think about her!
Understand me?

418
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,280
I'm trying to help her.

419
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,370
Brian, how you doing?

420
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,210
Your dad work here?

421
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,910
- Uh, Carl?
- What?

422
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:49,190
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

423
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,750
- How does one become a janitor?
- You want to be a janitor?

424
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,990
No, I want to know
how one becomes a janitor...

425
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,660
because Andrew's very interested
in a career in the custodial arts.

426
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,100
Really?

427
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,740
You think I'm some
untouchable peasant, serf, peon?

428
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,280
Yeah?

429
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,840
Maybe so.

430
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,310
From following a broom
after shitheads like you...

431
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,610
I've learned
a couple of things.

432
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,250
I look through your letters.

433
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,590
Look through your lockers.

434
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,180
I listen to your conversations.
You don't know that, but I do.

435
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,390
I am the eyes and ears
of this institution, my friends.

436
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,200
By the way,
that clock's 20 minutes fast.

437
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,360
Shit.

438
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,050
[ Whistling "Colonel Bogie's March" ]

439
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,180
[ Whistling "Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony" ]

440
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,310
All right, girls.
Thirty minutes for lunch.

441
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,550
- Here?
- Here.

442
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,390
I think the cafeteria would be
a more suitable place, sir.

443
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,630
I don't care what
you think, Andrew.

444
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,860
Dick.

445
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,370
Excuse me, Rich.

446
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,770
Will milk be made available?

447
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,400
We're extremely thirsty.

448
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,240
I have a really low tolerance
for dehydration.

449
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,110
I've seen her dehydrate, sir.
It's pretty gross.

450
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,080
- Relax. I'll get it.
- Uh-uh-uh.

451
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,950
grab some wood, bub.

452
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,780
You think I was born yesterday?

453
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,550
Think I'm going to let you
roam these halls?

454
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,790
You.

455
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,360
And you.

456
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,600
Hey!

457
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,170
What's her name?
Wake her up.

458
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,040
Hey! Come on!
On your feet, Missy. Let's go.

459
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,140
This isn't a rest home.

460
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,270
There's soda
in the teachers' lounge.

461
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,440
Let's go!

462
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,980
So...

463
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,050
what's your poison?

464
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,180
What do you drink?

465
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,790
Okay. Forget I asked.

466
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,460
Vodka.

467
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,740
Vodka?

468
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,240
When do you drink vodka?

469
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,370
Whenever.

470
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,070
- A lot?
- Tons.

471
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,820
Is that why
you're here today?

472
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,250
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

473
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,420
Um...

474
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,690
I'm here today because...

475
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,200
my coach and my father...

476
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:20,000
don't want me
to blow my ride.

477
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,230
I get treated differently...

478
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:26,200
because Coach thinks I'm a winner.
So does my old man.

479
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,840
I'm not a winner
because I want to be.

480
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,570
I'm a winner because
I have strength and speed.

481
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,150
Kinda like a racehorse.

482
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,210
That's about how involved I am
in what's happening to me.

483
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,720
Yeah?

484
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,720
That's very interesting.

485
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,620
Now, why don't you tell me
why you're really in here?

486
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,290
Forget it.

487
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,700
Claire, want to see a picture of a guy
with elephantitis of the nuts?

488
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,510
- It's pretty tasty.
- No, thank you.

489
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,570
How do you think
he rides a bike?

490
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,220
Oh, Claire?

491
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,190
Would you ever consider
dating a guy like this?

492
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,160
- Can't you just leave me alone?
- If he had a great personality...

493
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,720
was a good dancer
and had a cool car?

494
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,790
You'd probably have to
ride in the backseat...

495
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,160
because his nuts
would ride shotgun.

496
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,330
- You know what I wish I was doing?
- Careful. Brian is a cherry.

497
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,100
- Cherry?
- I wish I was on a plane...

498
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,510
- to France.
- I'm not a cherry.

499
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,210
- When have you ever been laid?
- I've laid lots of times.

500
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,080
- Name one.
- She lives in Canada.

501
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:47,490
Met her at Niagara Falls.
You wouldn't know her.

502
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,390
Ever laid anyone around here?

503
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,790
Oh. You and Claire did it?

504
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,460
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

505
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,800
- Drop it. We'll talk about it later.
- Drop what?

506
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,700
Brian's telling me that,
in addition to a number of girls...

507
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,940
in the Niagara Falls area,
that presently...

508
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,100
you and he are
riding the hobby horse.

509
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,410
- Little pig.
- No, I'm not!

510
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,970
John said I was a cherry,
and I said I wasn't. That's it.

511
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,680
What were you motioning
to Claire for?

512
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,120
- I don't appreciate this, Brian.
- He is lying.

513
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,220
You weren't motioning
to Claire?

514
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,460
- You know he's lying.
- Were you or were you not?

515
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,330
Yeah, but it was only--

516
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,500
It was only because
I didn't want her to know I'm a virgin.

517
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,940
Excuse me for being a virgin.

518
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,100
Why didn't you want me to know?

519
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,240
Because it's personal.
It's my personal, private business.

520
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,580
It doesn't sound like
you're doing any business.

521
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,310
I think it's okay
for a guy to be a virgin.

522
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,950
You do?

523
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,530
- What's in there?
- guess.

524
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,860
Where's your lunch?

525
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,130
You're wearing it.

526
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,200
You're nauseating.

527
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,320
What's that?

528
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,020
- Sushi.
- Sushi?

529
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:39,390
Rice, raw fish and seaweed.

530
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,500
You won't accept a guy's tongue
in your mouth but you'll eat that?

531
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,170
Can I eat?

532
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,680
I don't know.
give it a try.

533
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,570
What's your problem?

534
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,510
What are we having?

535
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,570
Uh...it's your standard
regular lunch, I guess.

536
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,180
Milk?

537
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,410
Soup.

538
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,690
- Uh...that's apple juice.
- I can read.

539
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,290
PB&J with the crusts cut off.

540
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,800
Well, Brian, this is
a very nutritious lunch.

541
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,770
All the food groups
are represented.

542
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,010
Did your Mom marry Mr. Rogers?

543
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,540
- No, Mr. Johnson.
- Ah.

544
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,640
Here's my impression...

545
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:09,310
of life at big Bri's house.

546
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,920
Son?

547
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,650
Yeah, Dad?

548
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,890
How's your day, pal?

549
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,220
great, Dad. How's yours?

550
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,860
Super.

551
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:29,960
Say, son, how'd you like
to go fishing this weekend?

552
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,140
great, Dad, but I've got
homework to do.

553
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,810
That's all right, son.
You can do it on the boat.

554
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,750
gee!

555
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,090
Dear, isn't our son swell?

556
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,950
Yes, dear.
Isn't life swell?

557
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,150
Oh.

558
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,120
Oh.

559
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,690
[ grunting ]

560
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,100
All right.
What about your family?

561
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,840
- Who, mine?
- Yeah.

562
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,740
It's real easy.

563
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,790
Stupid...

564
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,290
worthless...

565
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,290
no good, goddamn...

566
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,130
freeloading, son of a bitch.

567
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,960
Retarded, big mouth, know-it-all...

568
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,520
asshole, jerk.

569
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,310
You forgot ugly,
lazy and disrespectful.

570
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,810
Shut up, bitch!

571
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,310
go fix me a turkey potpie.

572
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,140
What about you, Dad?

573
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,650
Fuck you.

574
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,150
No, Dad. What about you?

575
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,650
Fuck you!

576
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,150
What about you!

577
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,650
Fuck you!

578
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,210
Bam!

579
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,290
- Is that for real?
- You wanna come over some time?

580
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,730
That's bullshit.
It's all part of your image.

581
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,770
- I don't believe a word of it.
- You don't believe me?

582
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,360
- No.
- No?

583
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,370
Did I stutter?

584
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,350
Do you believe this?
Huh?

585
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,420
It's about the size of a cigar.
Do I stutter?

586
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,760
This is what you get in my house
when you spill paint in the garage.

587
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,920
See, I don't think I need to sit
with you fucking dildos anymore.

588
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,040
Ahh!

589
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,470
Fuck!

590
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,190
You shouldn't have said that.

591
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,260
How did I know?

592
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,530
I mean he lies
about everything anyway.

593
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,850
Oh, shit.

594
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,290
Coffee.

595
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,850
Looks like it's scraped off
the bottom of the Mississippi River.

596
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:46,760
Everything's polluted.
Everything's polluted.

597
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,170
The coffee, the kids are polluted.

598
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:05,180
- How do you know where Vernon went?
- I don't.

599
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,180
- How do you know when he'll be back?
- I don't.

600
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,030
Being bad feels pretty good, huh?

601
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,830
What's the point
in going to Bender's locker?

602
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,730
Beats me.

603
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,300
This is so stupid.
Why do you think--

604
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:26,030
- Why are we risking getting caught?
- I don't know.

605
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,600
So then what are we doing?

606
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,110
Ask one more question and I'm beating
the shit out of you.

607
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,340
Sorry.

608
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,550
- You're such a slob.
- My maid's on vacation.

609
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,340
It's drugs.

610
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:02,540
Screw that, Bender.
Put it back.

611
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,010
Drugs.
The boy has marijuana.

612
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,920
- That was marijuana.
- Shut up, dick.

613
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,720
Do you approve of this?

614
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:28,330
[ Bender ] We'll cross
through the lab and double back.

615
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,030
You better be right.
If Vernon cuts us off, it's your fault.

616
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,840
[ Brian ] What'd he say?
Where are we going?

617
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:19,650
[ Bender ]
Wait. Wait. Hold it.

618
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,480
- We have to go through the cafeteria.
- No, the activities hall.

619
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,060
- You don't know what you're saying.
- No, you don't!

620
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:28,120
We're through listening to you.
We're going this way.

621
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,530
go where you want, motorhead.

622
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,930
Come on!

623
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,720
- Shit!
- great idea, jagoff.

624
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:59,120
- Fuck you.
- Why didn't you listen to John?

625
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,630
We're dead.

626
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,190
No.

627
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,470
- Just me.
- What do you mean?

628
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,052
