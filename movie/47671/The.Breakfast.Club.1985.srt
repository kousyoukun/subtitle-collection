00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,440
Hey hey hey hey

7
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,960
Won't you come see about me

8
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,190
I'll be alone

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,930
Dancing, you know it, baby

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,870
Tell me your troubles and doubts

11
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,670
givin' me everything lnside and out and

12
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,510
Love's strange So real in the dark

13
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,380
Think of the tender things That we were working on

14
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,720
Slow change may pull us apart

15
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,390
When the light gets into your heart, baby

16
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,900
Don't you Forget about me

17
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,330
Don't, don't, don't, don't

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,830
Don't you Forget about me

19
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,880
Will you stand above me

20
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,390
Look my way but never love me

21
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,110
Rain keeps fallin' Rain keeps fallin'

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,910
Down. Down.

25
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,780
Dear Mr. Vernon...

26
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,550
We accept that we had to sacrifice...

27
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,790
a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong.

28
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,690
What we did was wrong...

29
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,550
but we think you're crazy to make us write an essay...

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,390
telling you who we think we are.

31
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,960
What do you care?

32
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,600
You see us as you want to see us...

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,440
in the simplest terms, the most convenient definitions.

34
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,970
You see us as a brain...

35
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,310
an athlete...

36
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,720
a basket case...

37
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,090
a princess...

38
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,710
and a criminal.

39
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,230
Correct?

40
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,020
That's the way we saw each other at 7:00 this morning.

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,150
We were brainwashed.

42
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,880
I can't believe you can't get me out of this.

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,910
It's so absurd I have to be here on a Saturday.

44
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,550
It's not like I'm a defective or anything.

45
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,460
I'll make it up to you.

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,230
Honey, ditching class to go shopping doesn't make you a defective.

47
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,950
Have a good day.

48
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,860
Is this the first or last time we do this?

49
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,340
Last.

50
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,140
get in there and use the time to your advantage.

51
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,010
Mom, we're not supposed to study.

52
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,210
-Mister, you figure out a way to study. -Yeah.

53
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,010
Well, go!

54
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,630
Hey, I screwed around.

55
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,130
There's nothing wrong with that...

56
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,130
except you got caught, sport.

57
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, Mom already reamed me, all right?

58
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,730
You want to miss a match? Blow your ride?

59
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,700
No school is going to give a scholarship to a discipline case.

60
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,460
Well, well. Here we are.

61
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,970
I want to congratulate you for being on time.

62
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,840
Excuse me, sir? I think there's been a mistake.

63
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,280
I know it's detention, but, um, I don't think I belong in here.

64
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,550
It is now 7:06.

65
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,960
You have exactly 8 hours and 54 minutes to think about why you're here.

66
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,390
Ponder the error of your ways.

67
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
You may not talk.

68
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,790
You will not move from these seats.

69
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,630
And you... will not sleep.

70
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,470
All right, people, we're going to try something different today.

71
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,220
We are going to write an essay...

72
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,120
of no less than 1,000 words... describing to me who you think you are.

73
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,830
-Is this a test? -When I say "essay," I mean essay.

74
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,600
I do not mean a single word repeated 1,000 times.

75
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,670
Is that clear, Mr. Bender?

76
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,600
-Crystal. -good.

77
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,150
Maybe you'll learn a little something about yourself.

78
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,880
Maybe you'll even decide whether you care to return.

79
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,920
You know, I can answer that right now, sir.

80
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,720
-That'd be "no" for me, because... -Sit down, Johnson.

81
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,790
Thank you, sir.

82
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,400
My office is right across that hall.

83
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,730
Any monkey business is ill-advised. Any questions?

84
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,870
Yeah, I got a question.

85
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,000
Does Barry Manilow know you raid his wardrobe?

86
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,240
I'll answer that, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.

87
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,950
Don't mess with the bull, young man, you'll get the horns.

88
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,750
That man is a brownie hound.

89
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,790
Keep eating your hand, you won't be hungry for lunch.

90
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,690
I've seen you before, you know.

91
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,680
Who I think I am.

92
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,070
Who are you?

93
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,570
Who are you?

94
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,410
I am a walrus.

95
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,680
It's the shits, huh?

96
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,380
I can't believe this is really happening to me.

97
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,610
Oh, shit!

98
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,520
What if we have to take a piss?

99
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,920
Please.

100
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,980
You got to go, you got to go.

101
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,930
-Oh, my god. -You're not urinating in here, man.

102
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,990
Don't talk. It'll crawl back up.

103
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,800
Whip it out and you're dead before the first drop hits the floor.

104
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,770
You're pretty sexy when you get angry.

105
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,740
Hey, home boy, why don't you go close that door?

106
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,080
We'll get the prom queen impregnated.

107
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,680
-Hey. Hey! -What?

108
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,310
If I lose my temper, you're totalled, man.

109
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,060
-Totally? -Totally.

110
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,530
Why don't you shut up? Nobody's interested.

111
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,070
Really.

112
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,590
Buttface.

113
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,330
Hey, sporto, what'd you do to get in here?

114
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Forget to wash your jock?

115
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,310
Excuse me, fellas, we should just write our papers.

116
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,780
Because you live here doesn't mean you can be a pain...

117
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,040
so knock it off!

118
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,950
It's a free country.

119
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,850
He's doing it to get a rise out of you. Just ignore him.

120
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,780
Sweets.

121
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,930
You couldn't ignore me if you tried.

122
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,430
So...

123
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,760
So.

124
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,830
Are you guys like boyfriend-girlfriend?

125
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,430
Steady dates?

126
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,670
Lovers?

127
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,700
Come on, sporto. Level with me.

128
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,680
Do you slip her the hot beef injection?

129
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,240
-go to hell! -Enough!

130
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,480
Hey! What's going on in there?

131
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,110
Spoiled little pricks.

132
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,770
Scumbag.

133
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,360
Let's close that door.

134
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,310
We can't have a party with Vernon checking every few seconds.

135
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,370
The door's supposed to stay open.

136
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,310
-So what? -So why don't you shut up?

137
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,910
There's four other people here.

138
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,590
god, you can count. I knew you had to be smart to be a wrestler.

139
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,270
Who are you to judge anybody?

140
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,990
Really.

141
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,030
Bender, you don't even count.

142
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,990
If you disappeared forever, it wouldn't make any difference.

143
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,070
You may as well not even exist at this school.

144
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,800
Well, I'll run right out and join the wrestling team.

145
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,560
Maybe the prep club, too, student council.

146
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,040
-Nah, they wouldn't take you. -I'm hurt.

147
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,720
You know why you knock everything?

148
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,410
This should be stunning.

149
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,470
-Because you're afraid. -Oh, god, you richies are so smart.

150
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,740
That's exactly why I'm not heavy into activities.

151
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,080
-You're a big coward. -I'm in the math club.

152
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,680
You're afraid you don't belong, so you just dump all over it.

153
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,120
It wouldn't have anything to do with...

154
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,860
you activities people being assholes, would it?

155
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,590
You wouldn't know. You don't know any of us.

156
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, I don't know any lepers either...

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,270
but I'm not joining their fucking clubs.

158
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,170
-Watch the mouth. -I'm in the physics club too.

159
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,510
Excuse me a sec. What are you babbling about?

160
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,570
What I said was that...

161
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:26,950
I'm in the math club, the Latin club and the physics club. Physics club.

162
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,750
Hey. Cherry.

163
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,290
-Do you belong to the physics club? -That's an academic club.

164
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,980
So?

165
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,930
So academic clubs aren't the same as other kinds of clubs.

166
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,300
Ah, but to dorks like him, they are.

167
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,740
What do you guys do in your club?

168
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,670
In physics, well, we talk about physics, uh, properties of physics.

169
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,590
So it's sort of social. Demented and sad, but social, right?

170
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,150
I guess you could consider it a social situation.

171
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,210
Um, there are other children in my club.

172
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,490
And, uh, at the end of the year, we have, um...

173
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:16,130
-a big banquet at the Hilton. -You load up. You party.

174
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,830
No. We get dressed up, but we don't get high.

175
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,770
Only burners like you get high.

176
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,210
I didn't have shoes, so I had to borrow my dad's.

177
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,940
My mom doesn't like me to wear other people's shoes.

178
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,750
My cousin Kendall from lndiana

179
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,710
got high once.

180
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,940
He started eating, like, really weird foods...

181
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,680
and then he felt like he didn't belong anywhere.

182
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,050
Kind of "Twilight Zone," kinda.

183
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,110
Sounds like you.

184
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,350
You guys keep talking and Vernon's gonna come in here.

185
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,490
I got a meet Saturday, and I'm not missing it because of you boneheads.

186
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,790
Oh, wouldn't that be a bite, huh?

187
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,800
Missing a whole wrestling meet?

188
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,960
You wouldn't know about it, faggot.

189
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,030
You never competed in your life.

190
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,900
Oh, I know. I feel all empty inside.

191
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,380
I have such a deep admiration for guys who roll around with other guys.

192
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,940
You'd never miss it. You don't have any goals.

193
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,850
-But I do. -Yeah?

194
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,680
I want to be just like you.

195
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,450
I figure all I need's a lobotomy and some tights.

196
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,490
You wear tights?

197
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,030
No, I don't wear tights.

198
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,560
I wear the required uniform.

199
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,790
Tights.

200
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,130
Shut up.

201
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,050
There's not supposed to be any monkey business.

202
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,610
Young man, have you finished your paper?

203
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,160
Bender, don't screw around.

204
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,460
-What are you gonna do? -Drop dead, I hope.

205
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,170
All right!

206
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,370
Bender, that's school property.

207
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,040
It doesn't belong to us. It's not to be toyed with.

208
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,990
-Very funny. Fix it. -You should fix that.

209
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,050
-Am I a genius? -No, you're an asshole.

210
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,620
-Funny guy. Everyone, just shh. -Fix the door, Bender!

211
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,460
-I know what I'm doing. -Fix the door!

212
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,020
Shut up!

213
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,690
goddamn it!

214
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,030
Why is that door closed?

215
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,330
Why is that door closed!

216
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,070
How are we supposed to know? We can't move, right?

217
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,050
Why?

218
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,520
We're just sitting here, like we're supposed to.

219
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,720
Who closed that door?

220
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,190
-I think a screw fell out of it. -It just closed, sir.

221
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,900
Who!

222
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,130
She doesn't talk, sir.

223
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,300
-give me that screw. -I don't have it.

224
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,670
You want me to shake it out of you?

225
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,080
I don't have it. Screws fall out all the time.

226
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,740
-The world's an imperfect place. -give it to me, Bender.

227
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,670
Sir, why would anybody steal a screw?

228
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,810
Watch it, young lady.

229
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,520
The door's way too heavy, sir.

230
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,430
Damn it!

231
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,310
Andrew Clark, get up here.

232
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,850
Front and center. Let's go.

233
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,050
-How come Andrew gets to get up? -That's right.

234
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,390
If he gets up, we'll all get up. It'll be anarchy.

235
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,350
-Okay, watch the magazines. -It's out of my hands.

236
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,670
That's very clever, sir...

237
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,070
but what if there's a fire?

238
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,170
I think violating fire codes...

239
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,240
and endangering the lives of children would be unwise...

240
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,300
at this juncture in your career, sir.

241
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,080
What are you doing? get this out, for god's sake.

242
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,090
-What's the matter with you? -The school's equipped with fire exits.

243
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,960
-Show Dick some respect. -Let's go.

244
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,190
get in your seat.

245
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,800
I expected a little more from a varsity letterman.

246
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,940
You're not fooling anybody, Bender.

247
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,940
The next screw that falls out will be you.

248
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,640
Eat my shorts.

249
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,040
What was that?

250
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,210
Eat...

251
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,340
my...

252
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,610
shorts.

253
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,680
You just bought another Saturday, mister.

254
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,550
Oh, I'm crushed.

255
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,420
-One more right there. -I'm free the next Saturday.

256
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,050
Beyond that, I'll check my calendar.

257
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,690
good! It's gonna be filled.

258
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,390
We'll keep going. You want another one?

259
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,900
Say the word. Just say it.

260
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,910
Instead of going to prison, you'll come here.

261
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,830
-Are you through? -No.

262
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,790
-I'm doing society a favor. -So?

263
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,190
That's another!

264
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,550
I've got you the rest of your life if you don't watch it.

265
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,790
-You want another? -Yes.

266
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,950
You got it! That's another one, pal.

267
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,080
Cut it out!

268
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,650
You through?

269
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,460
Not even close, bud.

270
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,620
-You got one more. -You really think I give a shit?

271
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,600
Another.

272
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,930
-You through? -How many is that?

273
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,870
That's seven including the first one when you asked...

274
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,830
whether Barry Manilow knew he raided his closet.

275
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,790
-Now it's eight. Stay out of it. -Sir, it's seven.

276
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,430
Shut up, peewee.

277
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,810
You're mine, Bender. For two months, I got you.

278
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,010
I got you.

279
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,150
What can I say? I'm thrilled.

280
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,750
That's exactly what you want them to believe.

281
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,510
You know something?

282
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,590
You should spend more time doing something with yourself...

283
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,710
and less time trying to impress people.

284
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,500
Might be better off. Right, that's it!

285
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,430
I'll be outside those doors.

286
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,220
-The next time I have to come in here, -I'm cracking skulls.

287
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,450
Fuck you!

288
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,360
Fuck.

289
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,670
Wake up!

290
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,270
Who has to go to the lavatory?

291
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,030
That's real intelligent.

292
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,540
You're right.

293
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,010
It's wrong to destroy literature.

294
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,980
It's such fun to read.

295
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,440
And...

296
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,550
"Molay" really pumps my 'nads.

297
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,920
Moliere.

298
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,050
I love his work.

299
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,170
Big deal. Nothing to do, locked in a vacancy.

300
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,260
Ah, speak for yourself.

301
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:57,000
You think I'd speak for you? I don't know your language.

302
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,780
Hey... you grounded tonight?

303
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:05,310
I don't know. My mom said I was, but my dad said to blow her off.

304
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:13,330
There's a big party at Stubby's. Parents are in Europe.

305
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,560
-It should be pretty wild. -Yeah?

306
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,590
-Yeah. Are you going to go? -I doubt it.

307
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,760
How come?

308
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,830
If I disobey my mother, it's because my father says it's okay.

309
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,630
It's like this whole monster deal. It's endless and a total drag.

310
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,070
Any minute, divorce.

311
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,540
-Who do you like better? -What?

312
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,310
-You like your old man better?

313
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,430
They're both screwed.

314
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,430
I mean if you had to choose.

315
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,620
I don't know.

316
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,350
I'd probably go live with my brother.

317
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,500
I don't think either one gives a shit about me.

318
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,630
They use me to get back at each other.

319
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,410
Shut up!

320
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,040
-You're feeling sorry for yourself. -If I didn't, nobody else would.

321
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,550
You're breaking my heart.

322
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,150
-Sporto? -What?

323
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,650
You get along with your parents?

324
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,320
If I say yes, I'm an idiot, right?

325
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,730
You're an idiot anyway...

326
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,460
but if you say yes, you're a liar too.

327
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,240
You know something, man?

328
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,040
If we weren't in school right now, I'd waste you.

329
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,950
Can you hear this?

330
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,550
You want me to turn it up?

331
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,120
Hey, fellas, I mean...

332
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,780
I don't like my parents, either. I mean, I don't...

333
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,720
I mean, I don't get along with them when...

334
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,700
their idea of parental compassion is just, you know...

335
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,970
wacko, you know?

336
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
-Dork. -Yeah?

337
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,200
You are a parent's wet dream, okay?

338
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,310
That's the problem.

339
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,540
Look, I can see you're getting all bunged up...

340
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,780
for them making you wear these clothes...

341
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,880
but, face it, you're a neo-maxi-zoom-dweeby.

342
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,620
What would you do if you weren't out making yourself a better citizen?

343
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,920
Why do you have to insult everybody?

344
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,350
I'm being honest, asshole.

345
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,630
I would expect you to know the difference.

346
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,990
Well, he's got a name.

347
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,630
-Yeah? -Yeah.

348
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,710
-What's your name? -Brian.

349
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,510
-See? -My condolences.

350
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,410
What's your name?

351
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,710
What's yours?

352
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,650
-Claire. -Claire?

353
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,590
-Claire. It's a family name. -It's a fat girl's name.

354
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,320
-Thank you. -Your welcome.

355
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,690
-I'm not fat. -Not now...

356
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,060
but I can see you really pushing maximum density.

357
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,460
You see, I'm not sure if you know this...

358
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,870
but there are two kinds of fat people.

359
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,200
There's fat people that were born to be fat...

360
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,610
and fat people that were once thin but became fat.

361
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,840
When you look at them, you can sorta see that thin person inside.

362
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,610
You're gonna get married, squeeze out a few puppies and then...

363
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,230
Obscene finger gestures from such a pristine girl.

364
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,710
I'm not that pristine.

365
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,260
Are you a virgin?

366
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:46,370
I'll bet you a million dollars that you are.

367
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,740
Let's end the suspense.

368
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,780
Is it gonna to be a white wedding?

369
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,940
Why don't you just shut up?

370
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,990
Have you kissed a boy on the mouth?

371
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,220
Have you ever been felt up...

372
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,150
over the bra... under the blouse...

373
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,090
shoes off...

374
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,760
hoping to god your parents don't walk in?

375
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,270
Do you want me to puke?

376
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,900
Over the panties...

377
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,780
no bra...

378
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,440
blouse unbuttoned...

379
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,110
Calvin's in a ball on the front seat past 11:00 on a school night?

380
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,580
Leave her alone.

381
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,600
I said leave her alone.

382
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,470
You going to make me?

383
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,710
Yeah.

384
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,210
You and how many of your friends?

385
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,550
Just me.

386
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,080
Just you and me.

387
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,990
Two hits. Me hitting you. You hitting the floor.

388
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,050
Anytime you're ready, pal.

389
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,440
I don't want to get into this with you, man.

390
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,330
Why not?

391
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,800
'Cause I'd kill you.

392
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,680
It's real simple.

393
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,150
I'd kill you, and your fucking parents would sue me.

394
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,090
And it'd be a big mess, and I don't care enough about you to bother.

395
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,690
Chicken shit.

396
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,370
Let's end this now.

397
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,600
You don't talk to her.

398
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,700
You don't look at her.

399
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,050
And you don't even think about her! Understand me?

400
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,280
I'm trying to help her.

401
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,370
Brian, how you doing?

402
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,210
Your dad work here?

403
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,910
-Uh, Carl? -What?

404
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,190
-Can I ask you a question? -Sure.

405
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,750
-How does one become a janitor? -You want to be a janitor?

406
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,990
No, I want to know how one becomes a janitor...

407
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:01,660
because Andrew's very interested in a career in the custodial arts.

408
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,100
Really?

409
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,740
You think I'm some untouchable peasant, serf, peon?

410
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,840
Maybe so.

411
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,310
From following a broom after shitheads like you...

412
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,610
I've learned a couple of things.

413
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,250
I look through your letters.

414
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,590
Look through your lockers.

415
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,180
I listen to your conversations. You don't know that, but I do.

416
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,390
I am the eyes and ears of this institution, my friends.

417
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,670
By the way, that clock's 20 minutes fast.

418
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,360
Shit.

419
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,310
All right, girls. Thirty minutes for lunch.

420
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,550
-Here? -Here.

421
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,390
I think the cafeteria would be a more suitable place, sir.

422
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,630
I don't care what you think, Andrew.

423
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,860
Dick.

424
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,370
Excuse me, Rich.

425
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,770
Will milk be made available?

426
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,400
We're extremely thirsty.

427
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,240
I have a really low tolerance for dehydration.

428
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,110
I've seen her dehydrate, sir. It's pretty gross.

429
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:53,080
Relax. I'll get it.

430
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,950
grab some wood, bub.

431
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,780
You think I was born yesterday?

432
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,550
Think I'm going to let you roam these halls?

433
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,790
You.

434
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,360
And you.

435
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,600
Hey!

436
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,170
What's her name? Wake her up.

437
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,040
Hey! Come on! On your feet, Missy. Let's go.

438
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,140
This isn't a rest home.

439
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,270
There's soda in the teachers' lounge.

440
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,440
Let's go!

441
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,050
So... what's your poison?

442
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,180
What do you drink?

443
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,790
Okay. Forget I asked.

444
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,460
Vodka.

445
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,740
Vodka?

446
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,240
When do you drink vodka?

447
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,370
Whenever.

448
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,070
-A lot? -Tons.

449
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,820
Is that why you're here today?

450
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,250
-Why are you here? -Why are you here?

451
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,690
I'm here today because...

452
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,200
my coach and my father...

453
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,000
don't want me to blow my ride.

454
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,230
I get treated differently...

455
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,200
because Coach thinks I'm a winner. So does my old man.

456
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,840
I'm not a winner because I want to be.

457
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,570
I'm a winner because I have strength and speed.

458
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,150
Kinda like a racehorse.

459
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,210
That's about how involved I am in what's happening to me.

460
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,720
Yeah?

461
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,150
That's very interesting.

462
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:50,620
Now, why don't you tell me why you're really in here?

463
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,290
Forget it.

464
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,700
Claire, want to see a picture of a guy with elephantitis of the nuts?

465
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,510
-It's pretty tasty. -No, thank you.

466
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,900
How do you think he rides a bike?

467
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,220
Oh, Claire?

468
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,190
Would you ever consider dating a guy like this?

469
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,760
Can't you just leave me alone?

470
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,160
If he had a great personality...

471
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,720
was a good dancer and had a cool car?

472
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,790
You'd probably have to ride in the backseat...

473
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,160
because his nuts would ride shotgun.

474
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,710
You know what I wish I was doing?

475
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,590
Careful. Brian is a cherry.

476
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,110
-Cherry? -I wish I was on a plane...to France.

477
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,550
I'm not a cherry.

478
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,210
-When have you ever been laid? -I've laid lots of times.

479
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,080
-Name one. -She lives in Canada.

480
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,490
Met her at Niagara Falls. You wouldn't know her.

481
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,390
Ever laid anyone around here?

482
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,790
Oh. You and Claire did it?

483
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,460
-What are you talking about? -Nothing. Nothing.

484
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,800
-Drop it. We'll talk about it later. -Drop what?

485
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:07,940
Brian's telling me that, in addition to a number of girls... in the Niagara Falls area, that presently...

486
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,100
you and he are riding the hobby horse.

487
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,410
-Little pig. -No, I'm not!

488
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,970
John said I was a cherry, and I said I wasn't. That's it.

489
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,680
What were you motioning to Claire for?

490
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,120
-I don't appreciate this, Brian. -He is lying.

491
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,220
You weren't motioning to Claire?

492
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,830
You know he's lying.

493
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,710
Were you or were you not?

494
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,330
Yeah, but it was only...

495
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,500
It was only because I didn't want her to know I'm a virgin.

496
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,940
Excuse me for being a virgin.

497
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,100
Why didn't you want me to know?

498
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,240
Because it's personal. It's my personal, private business.

499
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,580
It doesn't sound like you're doing any business.

500
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,310
I think it's okay for a guy to be a virgin.

501
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,950
You do?

502
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,530
-What's in there? -guess.

503
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,860
Where's your lunch?

504
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,130
You're wearing it.

505
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,200
You're nauseating.

506
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,320
What's that?

507
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,020
-Sushi. -Sushi?

508
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,390
Rice, raw fish and seaweed.

509
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,500
You won't accept a guy's tongue in your mouth but you'll eat that?

510
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,170
Can I eat?

511
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,680
I don't know. give it a try.

512
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,570
What's your problem?

513
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,510
What are we having?

514
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,570
Uh...it's your standard regular lunch, I guess.

515
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,180
Milk?

516
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,410
Soup.

517
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,690
-Uh...that's apple juice. -I can read.

518
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,550
PB&J with the crusts cut off.

519
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,800
Well, Brian, this is a very nutritious lunch.

520
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,770
All the food groups are represented.

521
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,010
Did your Mom marry Mr. Rogers?

522
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,540
No, Mr. Johnson.

523
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:10,310
Here's my impression... of life at big Bri's house.

524
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,920
Son?

525
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,650
Yeah, Dad?

526
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,890
How's your day, pal?

527
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,220
great, Dad. How's yours?

528
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,860
Super.

529
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:30,960
Say, son, how'd you like to go fishing this weekend?

530
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:36,140
great, Dad, but I've got homework to do.

531
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,810
That's all right, son. You can do it on the boat.

532
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,750
gee!

533
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,090
Dear, isn't our son swell?

534
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,950
Yes, dear. Isn't life swell?

535
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,100
All right. What about your family?

536
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,840
-Who, mine? -Yeah.

537
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,740
It's real easy.

538
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,290
Stupid... worthless...

539
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:29,130
no good, goddamn... freeloading, son of a bitch.

540
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,070
Retarded, big mouth, know-it-all...asshole, jerk.

541
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:39,310
You forgot ugly, lazy and disrespectful.

542
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,810
Shut up, bitch!

543
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,310
go fix me a turkey potpie.

544
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,140
What about you, Dad?

545
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,650
Fuck you.

546
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,150
No, Dad. What about you?

547
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,650
Fuck you!

548
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,150
What about you!

549
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,650
Fuck you!

550
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,290
-Is that for real? -You wanna come over some time?

551
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,730
That's bullshit. It's all part of your image.

552
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,770
-I don't believe a word of it. -You don't believe me?

553
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,360
-No. -No?

554
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,370
Did I stutter?

555
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,350
Do you believe this? Huh?

556
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,110
It's about the size of a cigar. Do I stutter?

557
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,760
This is what you get in my house when you spill paint in the garage.

558
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,550
See, I don't think I need to sit with you fucking dildos anymore.

559
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,470
Fuck!

560
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,260
-You shouldn't have said that. -How did I know?

561
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,530
I mean he lies about everything anyway.

562
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,850
Oh, shit.

563
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,290
Coffee.

564
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,850
Looks like it's scraped off the bottom of the Mississippi River.

565
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,760
Everything's polluted. Everything's polluted.

566
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,170
The coffee, the kids are polluted.

567
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,180
-How do you know where Vernon went? -I don't.

568
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,180
-How do you know when he'll be back? -I don't.

569
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,030
Being bad feels pretty good, huh?

570
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,830
What's the point in going to Bender's locker?

571
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,730
Beats me.

572
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:27,030
-This is so stupid. Why do you think...Why are we risking getting caught? -I don't know.

573
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,600
So then what are we doing?

574
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,110
Ask one more question and I'm beating the shit out of you.

575
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,340
Sorry.

576
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,550
-You're such a slob. -My maid's on vacation.

577
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,340
It's drugs.

578
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,540
Screw that, Bender. Put it back.

579
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,830
Drugs. The boy has marijuana.

580
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,920
-That was marijuana. -Shut up, dick.

581
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,720
Do you approve of this?

582
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,330
We'll cross through the lab and double back.

583
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,470
You better be right.

584
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,030
If Vernon cuts us off, it's your fault.

585
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,840
What'd he say? Where are we going?

586
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:20,650
Wait. Wait. Hold it.

587
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,480
-We have to go through the cafeteria. -No, the activities hall.

588
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,060
-You don't know what you're saying. -No, you don't!

589
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,120
We're through listening to you. We're going this way.

590
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,530
go where you want, motorhead.

591
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,930
Come on!

592
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,500
Shit!

593
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,310
-great idea, jagoff. -Fuck you.

594
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,230
Why didn't you listen to John?

595
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,670
We're dead.

596
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,190
No.

597
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,470
-Just me. -What do you mean?

598
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,370
get back to the library. Keep your pants on.

599
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,260
I wanna be an airborne ranger

600
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,670
I wanna live a life of danger

601
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,150
That son of a bitch.

602
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,870
Before the day I die

603
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,390
There's five things I want to ride

604
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,970
Rifle, lifeboat, automobile

605
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,630
Virgin's mother and a ferris wheel

606
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,110
I wanna be an airborne ranger

607
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,360
Three...

608
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,070
two...

609
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,630
one!

610
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,610
Bender! Bender! What is this?

611
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,270
-What are you doing here? -Hi.

612
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,590
Out. That's it, Bender. Out. It's over.

613
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,870
-Don't you want to hear my excuse? -Out.

614
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,390
I might try out for a scholarship.

615
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,950
give me the ball. give me that ball.

616
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,410
get your stuff. Let's go.

617
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,640
Mr. Wise guy took it upon himself to go to the gymnasium.

618
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,070
I'm sorry to inform you...you'll be without his services for the rest of the day.

619
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,110
B-o-o h-o-o.

620
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,300
Everything's a big joke, huh, Bender?

621
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,590
The false alarm you pulled Friday.

622
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,590
False alarms are really funny.

623
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,790
What if your home...What if your family...

624
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:01,440
What if your dope was on fire?

625
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:05,780
Impossible, sir. It's in Johnson's underwear.

626
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,870
You think he's funny?

627
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:11,780
You think this is cute? He's "bitchin"? Is that it?

628
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,320
Let me tell you something.

629
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,620
Look at him.

630
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,720
He's a bum.

631
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,780
Want to see something funny?

632
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:25,700
You go visit John Bender in five years. You'll see how funny he is.

633
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:36,230
What's the matter, John? You gonna cry?

634
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,310
Let's go.

635
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,320
Keep your fuckin' hands off me!

636
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,880
I expect better manners from you, Dick.

637
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,880
For better hallway vision.

638
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,030
That's the last time, Bender.

639
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,400
The last time you ever make me look bad in front of them.

640
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,310
I make $31,000 a year and have a home.

641
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,840
I'm not throwing it away on some punk like you.

642
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,010
But someday, man, someday...

643
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,610
when you're gone and have forgotten about this place...

644
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,020
and they've forgotten you, and you're wrapped up in your pathetic life...

645
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,910
I'm gonna be there.

646
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,250
That's right.

647
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,660
I'm gonna kick the living shit out of you.

648
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,720
I'm gonna knock your dick in the dirt.

649
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,940
-You threatening me? -What are you gonna do about it?

650
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,800
You think anybody will believe you?

651
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,630
You think anybody's gonna take your word over mine?

652
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:51,240
I'm a man of respect around here. They love me. I'm a swell guy.

653
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,480
You're a lying sack of shit, and everybody knows it.

654
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,830
Oh, you're a real tough guy. Hey, hey. Come on.

655
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,150
get on your feet, pal! Let's find out how tough you are!

656
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,990
I want to know right now how tough you are.

657
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,430
I'll give you the first punch. Come on. Right here.

658
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,590
Just take the first shot. Please. I'm begging you. Take a shot. Right here.

659
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,270
Just take one shot. That's all I need. Just one swing.

660
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,010
That's what I thought.

661
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,870
You're a gutless turd.

662
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,970
A naked blonde walks into a bar...

663
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,970
with a poodle under one arm...

664
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,980
and a salami under the other.

665
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,480
She lays the poodle on the table.

666
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:30,420
Bartender says, "You won't be needing a drink."

667
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,150
Naked lady says...

668
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,990
Oh, shit!

669
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,670
Jesus Christ almighty!

670
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,490
Forgot my pencil.

671
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,830
goddamn it!

672
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,610
What in god's name is going on in here?

673
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:02,210
-What was that ruckus? -What ruckus?

674
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,840
I was in my office and I heard a ruckus.

675
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,940
Could you describe the ruckus, sir?

676
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,850
Watch your tongue, young man.

677
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,120
What is this?

678
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,460
-Vvvvt! -What is that?

679
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,730
What is that noise?

680
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,790
-What noise? -Really, sir, there wasn't any noise.

681
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,770
Was that the noise you were talking about?

682
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:38,080
That was not the noise I was talking about.

683
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:42,320
I may not have caught you in the act this time...

684
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:44,580
but you can bet I will.

685
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,990
You make book on that, missy.

686
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,760
And you!

687
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:53,290
I will not be made a fool of.

688
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,680
It was an accident.

689
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,690
You're an asshole.

690
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,240
Sue me.

691
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,250
Ahab, can I have all my doobage?

692
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,510
Yo, wastoid, you're not gonna blaze up in here.

693
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,750
Shit.

694
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,680
Chicks cannot hold dey smoke.

695
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,740
That's what it is.

696
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,670
Do you know how popular I am?

697
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,550
I am so popular. Everybody loves me so much at this school.

698
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,470
Sure they do.

699
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,150
Mister...

700
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,910
Oh, Mr. Tierney.

701
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:10,580
"A history of slight mental illness."

702
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,750
No wonder he's so fucked up.

703
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,260
good afternoon, Dick.

704
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,970
Hey, Carl. How you doing?

705
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,060
What's up?

706
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,790
Not much.

707
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:23,030
What are you doing in the basement files?

708
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,380
Oh, nothing. Just a little homework.

709
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,190
-Homework, huh? -Yeah.

710
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,070
Confidential files, huh?

711
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,940
Look, Carl, this is a highly sensitive area, and I'll tell you...

712
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,180
certain people would be very, very embarrassed.

713
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,920
I'd really appreciate it if this would be something...

714
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:45,420
that you and I could...we could keep between us.

715
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:49,450
-What'll you do for me, man? -What would you like?

716
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:52,360
-got 50 bucks? -What?

717
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,260
Fifty bucks.

718
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,840
No, no, no, man.

719
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,130
You got a middle name?

720
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,800
Yeah, I guess.

721
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,940
Your middle name is Ralph.

722
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:06,500
As in "puke."

723
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:10,580
Your birthday is March 12th...

724
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,580
you're 5'9 1/2"...

725
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,590
you weigh 130 pounds...

726
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:17,090
and your social security number...

727
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:22,820
049380913 is 049-38-0913.

728
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:28,320
-Are you psychic? -No.

729
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:33,660
How do you know all this about me?

730
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,540
I stole your wallet.

731
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:39,840
-give it to me. -No.

732
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,780
give it.

733
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,610
-This is great. You're a thief too? -I'm not a thief.

734
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:48,020
-Multi-talented. -What's there to steal?

735
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,070
-Two bucks and a beaver shot. -A what?

736
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,870
He's got a nudie picture. I saw it. It's perverted.

737
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,950
Let's see it.

738
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,840
-Are all these your girlfriends? -Some of them.

739
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,900
What about the others?

740
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,430
Well, some I consider my girlfriends...and some I just consider.

741
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,350
Consider what?

742
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,110
Whether or not I want to hang out with them.

743
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,150
You don't believe in one guy, one girl?

744
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:25,280
-Do you? -Yeah. That's the way it should be.

745
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,820
-Well, not for me. -Why not?

746
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,660
How come you got so much shit in your purse?

747
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:34,830
-Why do you have so many girlfriends? -I asked you first.

748
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,390
I don't know. I guess I never throw anything away.

749
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,630
Neither do l.

750
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:47,440
This is the worst fake l.D. I've ever seen.

751
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,150
You realize you made yourself 68?

752
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:54,150
-I know. I goofed it. -What do you need a fake l.D. for?

753
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,210
So I can vote.

754
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,420
You want to see what's in my bag?

755
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,930
-No. -No.

756
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,130
Holy shit.

757
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,410
-What is all that stuff? -Do you always carry this much shit?

758
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,270
Yeah.

759
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,450
I always carry this much shit in my bag.

760
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,510
You never know when you may have to jam.

761
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:37,830
Are you going to be, like, a shopping bag lady?

762
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,230
Like, sit in alleyways

763
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,510
and talk to buildings. Wear men's shoes.

764
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,710
I'll do what I have to do.

765
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,760
Why do you have to do anything?

766
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:56,070
My home life... is unsatisfying.

767
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:00,480
You'd subject yourself to the violent dangers of Chicago's streets...

768
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,950
because your home life is unsatisfying?

769
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,150
I don't have to run away and live in the street.

770
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,320
I can run away, and I can go to the ocean...

771
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,480
the country, the mountains,

772
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,920
lsrael, Africa...

773
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,930
Afghanistan.

774
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:23,870
Andy, you want to get in on this?

775
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:30,510
Allison says she wants to run away...because her home life is unsatisfying.

776
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,840
Well, everyone's home life is unsatisfying.

777
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:39,590
If it wasn't, people would live with their parents forever.

778
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,490
Yeah, I understand, but I think hers...

779
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,550
goes beyond what guys like you and me...

780
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,030
consider "normal" unsatisfying.

781
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,040
Never mind. Forget it. Everything's cool.

782
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:56,170
-What's the deal? -No. There's no deal, sporto.

783
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,470
-Forget it. Leave me alone. -Wait a minute.

784
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:02,480
You're carrying all that crap in your purse.

785
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:06,140
Either you really want to run away or you want people to think that.

786
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,910
Eat shit.

787
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,720
The girl is an island unto herself. Okay?

788
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,500
Hi.

789
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:29,300
-You want to talk? -No.

790
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:33,140
-Why not? -go away.

791
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:37,070
-Where do you want me to go? -go away.

792
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,730
-You have problems. -Oh, I have problems?

793
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,770
You do everything everybody tells you! That is a problem.

794
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,430
Okay, fine. But I didn't dump my purse out on the couch...

795
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,490
and invite people into my problems.

796
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,170
Did I?

797
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:11,380
So what's wrong? What is it?

798
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,670
Is it bad?

799
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,510
Real bad?

800
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,670
Parents?

801
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:40,370
Yeah.

802
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,950
What did they do to you?

803
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,870
They ignore me.

804
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,960
Yeah.

805
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,140
Yeah.

806
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:12,010
What did you want to be when you were young?

807
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,170
I wanted to be John Lennon.

808
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:17,650
Carl, don't be a goof.

809
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,350
I'm trying to be serious.

810
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:24,250
Carl, I've been teaching for 22 years.

811
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:29,690
And each year... these kids get more arrogant.

812
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,700
Aw, bullshit, man. Come on, Vern.

813
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:36,290
The kids haven't changed, you have.

814
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:40,500
You're teaching because you thought it would be fun.

815
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:43,740
Thought you could have summer vacations off.

816
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,540
Then you discovered it was work.

817
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,600
That bummed you out.

818
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:52,670
These kids turned on me.

819
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:57,020
They think I'm a big fucking joke.

820
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,520
Come off it.

821
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:03,360
If you were 16... what would you think of you?

822
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:07,560
Do you think I care what these kids think?

823
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,120
Yes, I do.

824
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,640
Think about this.

825
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:14,640
When we get old...

826
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:18,170
these kids will be running the country.

827
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,470
Yeah.

828
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:25,250
This thought wakes me at night...

829
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,880
When I get older...these kids will take care of me.

830
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,420
I wouldn't count on it.

831
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:39,100
What would I do for a million bucks?

832
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:41,690
As little as I had to.

833
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,350
-That's boring. -How am I supposed to answer?

834
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:49,150
The idea is to search your mind for the absolute limit.

835
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,990
Like, would you drive to school naked?

836
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,450
-Would I have to get out of the car? -Of course.

837
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,820
-In the spring or winter? -Doesn't matter. Spring.

838
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:09,430
-In the front or back of school? -Either one.

839
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,330
Yes.

840
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,730
I'd do that.

841
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:17,200
I'll do anything sexual. I don't need a million dollars either.

842
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:21,640
-You're lying. -I already have.

843
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:25,140
I've done just about everything except a few things that are illegal.

844
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,380
I'm a nymphomaniac.

845
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:30,980
Lie.

846
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,270
-Are your parents aware of this? -I've only told my shrink.

847
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,390
-What did he do when you told him? -He nailed me.

848
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,250
Very nice.

849
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:48,990
I don't think, from a legal standpoint, what he did...

850
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:51,500
can be construed as rape since I paid him.

851
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:55,670
-He's an adult. -Yeah. He's married too.

852
01:07:55,740 --> 01:08:00,010
Ugh. Do you have any idea how completely gross that is?

853
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,840
-Well, the first few times... -"The first few times"!

854
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,880
-You mean he did it more than once? -Sure.

855
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,230
Are you crazy?

856
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,630
Obviously. She's screwing her shrink.

857
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,680
Have you ever done it?

858
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:18,060
I don't even have a psychiatrist.

859
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:20,460
Have you ever done it with a normal person?

860
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:24,130
-Didn't we already cover this? -You never answered.

861
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:29,010
I won't discuss my private life with total strangers.

862
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,480
-It's kind of a double-edged sword. -A what?

863
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:36,110
Well, if you say you haven't, you're a prude.

864
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:40,270
If you say you have, you're a slut. It's a trap.

865
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,190
You want to, but you can't.

866
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,790
Then when you do, you wish you didn't. Right?

867
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,790
-Wrong. -Or are you a tease?

868
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:51,190
She's a tease.

869
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,750
I'm sure. Why don't you forget it?

870
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:55,100
You're a tease and you know it. All girls are teases.

871
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,400
She's only a tease if what she does gets you hot.

872
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:01,700
-I don't do anything! -That's why you're a tease.

873
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:05,270
-Let me ask you something. -I told you everything.

874
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:08,140
Doesn't it bother you to sleep around without being in love?

875
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,910
-Don't you want respect? -I don't screw to get respect.

876
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:13,980
That's the difference between you and me.

877
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:16,040
That's not the only difference.

878
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,960
-Face it. You're a tease. -I'm not a tease!

879
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,930
Sure you are. Sex is your weapon. You said it yourself.

880
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,020
You use it to get respect.

881
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:27,860
I never said that. She twisted my words around.

882
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:31,030
-What do you use it for then? -I don't use it, period!

883
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,730
Oh, are you medically frigid or is it psychological?

884
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:38,110
I didn't mean it that way. You're putting words into my mouth!

885
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,010
Just answer the question.

886
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,310
-Be honest. -No big deal. Answer it.

887
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,370
-Answer the question, Claire. -Talk to us.

888
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:47,920
Come on. Answer it.

889
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:51,950
-It's only one question. -No! I never did it!

890
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:58,390
I never did it either.

891
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,030
I'm not a nymphomaniac.

892
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,090
I'm a compulsive liar.

893
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,730
You are such a bitch!

894
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:12,070
You did that on purpose just to fuck me over.

895
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:15,770
I would do it. If you love someone, it's okay.

896
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,110
I can't believe you. You're so weird.

897
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,510
You don't say anything all day. Then, when you open your mouth...

898
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,900
you unload all these tremendous lies all over me.

899
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,590
You're just pissed off because she got

900
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,980
you to admit to something.

901
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,350
Fine, but that doesn't make it any less bizarre.

902
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,990
What's bizarre? We're all pretty bizarre.

903
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,760
Some of us are better at hiding it.

904
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,900
How are you bizarre?

905
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,170
He can't think for himself.

906
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:47,570
She's right.

907
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:51,450
Know what I did to get in here?

908
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,580
I taped Larry Lester's buns together.

909
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,280
That was you?

910
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,790
You know him?

911
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,830
Yeah, I know him.

912
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:07,200
Then you know how hairy he is.

913
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:09,890
When they pulled the tape off...

914
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:13,100
most of his hair and some skin came too.

915
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,500
Oh, my god.

916
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:20,510
And the bizarre thing is...that I did it for my old man.

917
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,180
I tortured this poor kid...

918
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,990
because I wanted him to think I was cool.

919
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,910
He was always going off about...

920
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,280
you know, when he was in school...

921
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:38,090
all the wild things he used to do.

922
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:42,230
I got the feeling he was disappointed...

923
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,630
that I never cut loose on anyone, right?

924
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:49,930
So I'm sitting in the locker room...

925
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,710
and I'm taping up my knee...

926
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:57,740
and Larry's undressing...

927
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:00,150
a couple of lockers down from me.

928
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,920
And he's kind of...

929
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,350
He's kind of skinny, weak.

930
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:13,060
I started thinking about my father...

931
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:16,630
and his attitude about weakness.

932
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:20,460
The next thing I knew...

933
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:25,740
I jumped on top of him and started wailing on him.

934
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:31,440
My friends just laughed and cheered me on.

935
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:36,620
And afterwards...

936
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:41,460
when I was sitting in Vernon's office...

937
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,220
all I could think about...

938
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,390
was Larry's father...

939
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:53,170
and Larry having to go home...

940
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:59,270
and explain what happened to him.

941
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:05,280
And the humiliation...

942
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:10,410
the fucking humiliation he must have felt.

943
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:16,490
It must have been unreal.

944
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:22,230
How do you apologize for something like that?

945
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:28,370
There's no way.

946
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:35,280
It's all because of me and my old man.

947
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:41,010
god, I fucking hate him.

948
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:45,250
He's like this...

949
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,620
He's like this mindless machine I can't relate to anymore.

950
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,130
"Andrew!

951
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,130
You've got to be number one!

952
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,230
I won't tolerate any losers in this family.

953
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,300
Your intensity is for shit!

954
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:02,840
Win! Win! Win!"

955
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:07,040
You son of a bitch.

956
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:13,510
You know, sometimes, I wish my knee would give.

957
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,180
Then I wouldn't be able to wrestle anymore.

958
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:20,850
Then he could forget all about me.

959
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:25,030
I think your old man and mine should get together and go bowling.

960
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:33,200
Like with my grades...

961
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:35,710
Iike when I...when I...

962
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:40,710
Iike when I step outside of myself, you know?

963
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:45,540
And I see me...

964
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:51,820
I don't like what I see.

965
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:53,420
I really don't.

966
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,980
What's wrong with you?

967
01:14:56,060 --> 01:15:00,000
Why don't you like yourself?

968
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:02,400
Sounds stupid, but...

969
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,760
because I'm failing shop.

970
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,740
We had this assignment, you know...

971
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:13,400
to make this ceramic elephant.

972
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,790
And, um...we're supposed to...

973
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,390
It was like a lamp.

974
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:25,420
When you pull the trunk, the light goes on.

975
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:27,820
My light didn't go on.

976
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:32,450
I got an "F" on it.

977
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,590
I've never got an "F" in my life.

978
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:38,760
When I signed up for the course...

979
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,900
I thought I was playing it smart.

980
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:43,410
I thought, "I'll take shop. It'll be such an easy way...

981
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,470
to maintain my grade point average."

982
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:48,540
Why'd you think it'd be easy?

983
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:52,070
Have you seen some of the dopes that take shop?

984
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:56,090
I take shop. You must be a fucking idiot.

985
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,950
Because I can't make a lamp?

986
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,620
No, you're a genius because you can't make a lamp.

987
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:05,220
-What do you know about trigonometry? -I could care less about it.

988
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:08,160
Without trigonometry, there'd be no engineering.

989
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,870
Without lamps, there'd be no light.

990
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,900
So neither of you is better...

991
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:15,340
I can write with my toes.

992
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,840
I can also eat, brush my teeth...

993
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:23,680
-With your feet? -Play the piano.

994
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:27,620
-I can make spaghetti. -What can you do?

995
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,940
I can, uh, tape all your buns together.

996
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,390
I want to see what Claire can do.

997
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,950
-I can't do anything. -Everybody can do something.

998
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:42,360
There's one thing I can do.

999
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,530
Forget it. It's way too embarrassing.

1000
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,710
Ever seen "Wild Kingdom"?

1001
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:48,440
He's been on for 30 years.

1002
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:51,270
Okay.

1003
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:54,080
You have to swear to god you won't laugh.

1004
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,280
Okay.

1005
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:04,850
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

1006
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:23,830
That's great! Where'd you learn to do that?

1007
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:25,710
Camp, seventh grade.

1008
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,640
That was great, Claire.

1009
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:37,020
My image of you is totally blown.

1010
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:39,750
You're a shit. Don't do that to her.

1011
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:42,520
-You swore to god you wouldn't laugh. -Am I laughing?

1012
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,220
You fucking prick!

1013
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:49,930
What do you care what I think?

1014
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,670
I don't even count, right?

1015
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:57,440
I could disappear forever and it wouldn't make any difference.

1016
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:03,780
I may as well not even exist at this school. Remember?

1017
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:10,020
And, you, don't like me anyway.

1018
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:12,990
I have just as many feelings as you do.

1019
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,720
And it hurts just as much when somebody steps on them.

1020
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:17,690
god, you're so pathetic!

1021
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,750
Don't you ever...

1022
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:22,820
ever, compare yourself to me, okay?

1023
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:25,700
You got everything, and I got shit.

1024
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,060
Fucking Rapunzel, right?

1025
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:31,370
School would probably shut down if you didn't show up!

1026
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,840
Queenie isn't here.

1027
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:36,510
I like those earrings, Claire.

1028
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:37,910
Shut up.

1029
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,420
-Are those real diamonds, Claire? -Just shut up.

1030
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:42,480
I bet they are.

1031
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,750
Did you work for the money for those?

1032
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:46,720
Shut your mouth.

1033
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,950
-Or did Daddy buy them for you? -Shut up!

1034
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,230
I bet he bought those.

1035
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:56,030
I bet those were a Christmas gift, right?

1036
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,090
Know what I got for Christmas?

1037
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:01,000
It was a banner-fucking-year at the Bender family.

1038
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,010
I got a carton of cigarettes.

1039
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,240
The old man grabbed me and said, "Smoke up, Johnny."

1040
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:09,710
go home and cry to your daddy. Don't cry here, okay?

1041
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,500
Will we be like our parents?

1042
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,230
Not me...

1043
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,730
ever.

1044
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,470
It's unavoidable.

1045
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:38,740
Just happens.

1046
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:41,180
What happens?

1047
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:46,120
When you grow up...

1048
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,620
your heart dies.

1049
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:48,980
Who cares?

1050
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:52,110
I care.

1051
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:56,790
I was just thinking, I mean...

1052
01:19:56,860 --> 01:20:00,630
I know it's kind of a weird time...

1053
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,630
but I was just wondering, um...

1054
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,300
what will happen on Monday?

1055
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:08,640
When we're all together again.

1056
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:11,680
I consider you guys my friends.

1057
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:15,810
Am I wrong?

1058
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,310
No.

1059
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:21,950
So on Monday, what happens?

1060
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,960
Still friends, you mean?

1061
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:26,320
If we're friends now?

1062
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:27,550
Yeah.

1063
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,080
Want the truth?

1064
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,560
Yeah, I want the truth.

1065
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:35,000
I don't think so.

1066
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:39,360
With all of us or just John?

1067
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,410
With all of you.

1068
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:45,980
-That's a real nice attitude, Claire. -Oh, be honest, Andy.

1069
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,550
If Brian came up to you on Monday, what would you do?

1070
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,870
Picture this. You're there with all the sports.

1071
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,750
You know exactly what you'd do. You'd say hi and when he left...

1072
01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:00,380
you'd cut him up so your friends wouldn't think you really liked him.

1073
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,820
No way.

1074
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,860
Okay. What if I came up to you?

1075
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:09,300
-The same exact thing. -You are a bitch!

1076
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:13,200
Why? Because I'm telling the truth, I'm a bitch?

1077
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:16,040
No! 'Cause you know how shitty that is to do to someone.

1078
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:18,210
and you don't have the balls

1079
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:20,700
to stand up to your friends.

1080
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:22,910
What about you, you hypocrite?

1081
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:26,380
Why don't you take Allison to a heavy metal vomit party.

1082
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:29,400
Take Brian or Andy out to the parking lot

1083
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,320
to get high. Or me?

1084
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:34,550
What would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together?

1085
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:36,620
They'd laugh their asses off.

1086
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:38,080
You'd say we were doing it,

1087
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,390
so they'd forgive you.

1088
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,430
Don't talk about my friends!

1089
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,430
You don't know them. You don't look at them.

1090
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,500
And you certainly wouldn't condescend to speak to them.

1091
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,490
Just stick to what you know:

1092
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:51,940
shopping, nail polish, your father's BMW...

1093
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,890
your drunk mother in the Caribbean...

1094
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:55,210
Shut up!

1095
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,760
As far as being concerned

1096
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,740
about us walking down the hallways together.

1097
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,290
Forget it! It'll never happen!

1098
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:04,690
Just bury your head and wait for your fucking prom!

1099
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:07,820
-I hate you! -Yeah? good!

1100
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,390
I assume Allison and I are better people than you guys?

1101
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,470
Us weirdos?

1102
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:27,430
-Would you do that to me? -I don't have any friends.

1103
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:33,080
-Well, if you did? -No.

1104
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,980
I don't think my kind of friends would mind.

1105
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,710
I just want to tell each of you that I wouldn't do that.

1106
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,160
I wouldn't and I will not.

1107
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,790
Because I think that's real shitty.

1108
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:56,370
Your friends wouldn't mind because they look up to us.

1109
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,840
You're so conceited, Claire.

1110
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,470
You're so conceited.

1111
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:07,850
You're so full of yourself. Why?

1112
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,030
I'm not saying that to be conceited.

1113
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:15,060
I hate having to go along with everything my friends say.

1114
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:17,220
Then why do you do it?

1115
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,660
I don't know. I don't...

1116
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,380
You don't understand. You don't...

1117
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:28,400
You're not friends with the people Andy and I are friends with.

1118
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:33,200
You don't understand the pressure they can put on you.

1119
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:35,900
I don't understand what?

1120
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:38,680
You think I don't understand pressure?

1121
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,270
Well, fuck you!

1122
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:42,220
Fuck you!

1123
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:53,530
You know why I'm here today?

1124
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,190
Do you?

1125
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,530
I'm here...because...

1126
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:06,670
Mr. Ryan found a gun in my locker.

1127
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:14,220
-Why'd you have a gun? -I tried.

1128
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,090
You pull the fucking trunk...

1129
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,290
and the light's supposed to go on.

1130
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,250
It didn't go on. I mean, I...

1131
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:30,330
-What's the gun for? -Just forget it.

1132
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,560
You brought it up, man.

1133
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,170
I can't have an "F."

1134
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,940
I can't have it...

1135
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,940
and I know my parents can't have it.

1136
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:52,630
Even if I ace the rest of the semester...I'm still only a "B."

1137
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,870
Everything's ruined for me.

1138
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:56,980
Brian.

1139
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,770
Considering my options, you know?

1140
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,660
Killing yourself is not an option.

1141
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,310
I didn't do it, did l!

1142
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:11,210
No. I don't think so.

1143
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,340
It was a handgun?

1144
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,950
It was a flare gun. Went off in my locker.

1145
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,670
Really?

1146
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:24,620
It's not funny.

1147
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:41,160
Yes, it is.

1148
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:45,840
Fucking elephant was destroyed.

1149
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:50,540
Know what I did to get in here?

1150
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,080
Nothing.

1151
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:57,750
I didn't have anything better to do.

1152
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,490
You're laughing at me.

1153
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,790
No.

1154
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,530
Yeah, you are.

1155
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,650
It seems so clear in black and white

1156
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:39,420
The living color tends to dull our sight

1157
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,830
Like dynamite

1158
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:45,600
Just imagine my surprise

1159
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:49,610
When I looked into your eyes and saw

1160
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:51,670
Through your disguise

1161
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:57,950
If we dare expose our hearts And just reveal the purest thoughts

1162
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:02,950
And that is when sensations start to grow

1163
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:05,290
We are not alone

1164
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,790
You find out where you're coming from

1165
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:12,960
There'll be somebody there to break your fall

1166
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:15,300
We are not alone

1167
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:17,630
'Cause when you look out through the door

1168
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:22,040
We're really not the victims after all

1169
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:55,770
Brian?

1170
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,280
Are you going to write your paper?

1171
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:00,830
Yeah. Why?

1172
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:06,940
It's a waste for all of us to write our paper.

1173
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:09,210
Vernon wants us to.

1174
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:13,550
True, but I think we'd all kinda say the same thing.

1175
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:18,220
You just don't want to write your paper, right?

1176
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:20,290
True, but...

1177
01:28:20,370 --> 01:28:22,130
you're the smartest, right?

1178
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,030
Well...

1179
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:27,530
We trust you.

1180
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,270
Yeah.

1181
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:35,400
All right.

1182
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:38,110
I'll do it.

1183
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:40,410
great.

1184
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,830
Come on.

1185
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,990
Where are we going?

1186
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:57,560
Come on.

1187
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:01,670
Don't be afraid.

1188
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,270
Don't stick that in my eye.

1189
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,440
I'm not sticking it. Just...go like that.

1190
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:11,710
good.

1191
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:18,480
You look better without all that black shit on your eyes.

1192
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,080
Hey, I like that black shit.

1193
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,590
This looks a lot better.

1194
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,630
Look up.

1195
01:29:33,070 --> 01:29:36,060
Please.

1196
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,170
Why are you being so nice to me?

1197
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,910
'Cause you're letting me.

1198
01:29:57,930 --> 01:29:59,420
You lost?

1199
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,190
Thank you.

1200
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:03,280
Why'd you do that?

1201
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,850
'Cause I knew you wouldn't.

1202
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:11,000
You said before your parents use you to get back at each other.

1203
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:14,530
Wouldn't I be outstanding in that capacity?

1204
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:20,140
Were you really disgusted about what I did with my lipstick?

1205
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:21,970
Truth?

1206
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,470
Truth.

1207
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,630
No.

1208
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:38,190
What happened to you?

1209
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:41,920
Why? Claire did it.

1210
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:48,670
What's wrong?

1211
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:51,870
Nothing's wrong. It's just...

1212
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:53,600
just so different.

1213
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,110
I can see your face.

1214
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,580
Is that good or bad?

1215
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:03,610
That's good.

1216
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:19,960
See you, Brian.

1217
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:23,910
See you next Saturday.

1218
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:25,470
You bet.

1219
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:37,820
Won't you come see about me

1220
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:43,020
I'll be alone Dancing, you know it, baby

1221
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:46,790
Tell me your troubles and doubts

1222
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:51,300
giving me everything inside and out and

1223
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,730
Love's strange So real in the dark

1224
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:58,170
Think of the tender things

1225
01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:00,540
That we were working on

1226
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:04,470
Slow change may pull us apart

1227
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:09,910
When the light gets into your heart, baby

1228
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,020
Don't you forget about me

1229
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:18,520
Don't, don't, don't, don't

1230
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:23,890
Don't you forget about me

1231
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:30,740
Will you stand above me

1232
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:35,440
Look my way but never love me

1233
01:33:35,650 --> 01:33:37,640
Rain keeps fallin'

1234
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:41,550
Rain keeps fallin' down

1235
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:43,880
Down, down

1236
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:48,420
Will you recognize me

1237
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:52,420
Call my name or walk on by

1238
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:55,260
As the rain keeps fallin'

1239
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:59,060
Rain keeps fallin' down

1240
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:01,570
Down, down

1241
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:07,140
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1242
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:12,410
Dear Mr. Vernon...

1243
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,150
We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice...

1244
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:18,750
a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong.

1245
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:21,550
We think you're crazy to make us write

1246
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:23,230
an essay on who we think we are.

1247
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:25,460
You see us as you want to see us...

1248
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:29,430
in the simplest terms, the most convenient definitions.

1249
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:33,830
But what we found out...is that each one of us is a brain...

1250
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,510
and an athlete...

1251
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,670
and a basket case...

1252
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,950
a princess...

1253
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,790
and a criminal.

1254
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,830
Does that answer your question?

1255
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,270
Sincerely yours...the Breakfast Club.

1256
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:51,120
Don't, don't, don't, don't

1257
01:34:51,390 --> 01:34:56,690
Don't you Forget about me

1258
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:00,960
As you walk on by

1259
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,560
Will you call my name

1260
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:10,040
As you walk on by

1261
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:14,870
Will you call my name

1262
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:18,140
When you walk away

1263
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,840
When you walked into the room

1264
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:46,500
I could see you were no fool

1265
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:50,840
Is that smile a sight for me

1266
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,910
Only if my heart could see

1267
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:04,190
Will I make your body cry

1268
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:07,860
Cry so loud you never hear

1269
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:10,770
In the shadows of my life

1270
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:14,430
Can I take you home tonight

1271
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:26,040
Your heart too hot to hold

1272
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:30,050
Just a flame that burns my soul

1273
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,390
Heart too hot to hold

1274
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,220
Too hot, too hot.

1275
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:37,230
Too hot to hold

1276
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:40,490
Heart too hot to hold

1277
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:44,160
A flame that burns my soul

1278
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,870
Too hot, too hot. Too hot to hold

1279
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:51,510
Too hot, too hot. Too hot to hold
