you can't get me out of this.

It's so absurd I have to
be here on a Saturday.

It's not like
I'm a defective or anything.

I'll make it up to you.

doesn't make you a defective.

Have a good day.

Last.

Well, get in there and use the time
to your advantage.

We have to sit there and do nothing.

There's nothing wrong with that...

except you
got caught, sport.
Yeah, Mom already reamed me.

You want to blow your ride?

Excuse me, sir?
I think there's been a mistake.

I know it's detention but, um,
I don't think I belong in here.

And you...
will not sleep.

All right, people,
we're going to try something
a little different today.

describing to me
who you think you are.
Is this a test?

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,850
And when I say essay,
I mean essay.

71

I do not mean a single word
repeated a thousand times.

Good. Maybe you'll learn
something about yourself.

Maybe you'll even decide
whether or not
you care to return.

Uh, I can answer
that right now, sir.

just write our papers.

take you, you don't belong,
so you dump all over it.

Well, you wouldn't know.
You don't even know any of us.

153
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,879
Well, I don't know
any lepers either...

154
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,288
but I'm not going to run
and join one of their fucking clubs.

155
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,161
Hey, let's watch
the mouth, huh?
I'm in Physics Club too.

156
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,490
Excuse me a sec.
What are you babbling about?

157
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,727
What I said was that
I'm in the Math Club...

158
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,963
uh, the Latin Club
and the Physics Club... Physics Club.

159
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,772
Hey. Cherry.

160
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,947
Do you belong to
the Physics Club?

161
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,356
That's an academic club.
So?

162
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,951
Academic clubs aren't the same
as other kinds of clubs.

163
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:47,484
Ah, but to dorks
like him, they are.

164
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,759
What do you guys
do in your club?

165
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:56,491
In physics, well, we talk about physics.
Properties of physics.

166
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:01,769
So it's sort of social.
Demented and sad, but social, right?

167
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,831
[Johnson] I guess
you could consider it
a social situation.

168
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:09,541
Um, I mean, there are
other children in my club. And, uh...

169
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:13,816
at the end of the year, we have, um,
we have a big banquet at the Hilton.

170
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,147
You load up. You party.

171
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:20,852
No. We get dressed up,
but we don't get high.

172
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,227
- Only burners like you get high.
- And I didn't have any shoes,
so I had to borrow my dad's.

173
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,958
It's weird 'cause my mom doesn't like me
to wear other people's shoes.

174
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:32,164
My counsel kent...
My cousin Kendall from Indiana,
he got high once.

175
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,068
And, you know, he started eating,
like, really weird foods.

176
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:39,131
Then he felt like he didn't
belong anywhere, kind of
like Twilight Zone, kinda?

177
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,042
- [Laughs] Sounds like you.
- You guys keep up your talking
and Vernon's gonna come in.

178
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:46,646
I got a meet this Saturday,
and I'm not gonna miss it
on account of you boneheads.

179
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,810
Oh, and wouldn't that
be a bite?
[Grunts]

180
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,818
Missing a whole
wrestling meet?

181
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,980
You wouldn't know
anything about it, faggot.

182
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,049
You never competed
in your whole life.

183
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,788
[Mock Crying]
Oh, I know. I feel
all empty inside because of it.

184
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:02,394
I have such a deep admiration
for guys who roll around
on the floor with other guys.

185
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:06,869
You'd never miss it.
You don't have any goals.
Oh, but I do.

186
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,430
I want to be just like you.

187
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,569
I figure all I need's
a lobotomy and some tights.

188
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,504
You wear tights?

189
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,913
No, I don't wear tights.

190
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,786
- I wear the required uniform.
- Tights.

191
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,326
Shut up.

192
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:41,144
[Snorts]
Woo!

193
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,967
[Johnson]
There's not supposed to
be any monkey business.

194
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,707
Young man, have you
finished your paper?

195
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,140
[Boy]
Come on, Bender.
Don't screw around.

196
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,452
What are you
going to do?
Drop dead, I hope.

197
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,685
[Water Running]

198
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,164
[Shouts, Indistinct]
All right!

199
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:14,406
Bender, that's-that's
school property there,
and it doesn't belong to us.

200
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,844
- It's something not to be
toyed with.
- That's very funny. Fix it.

201
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,071
You should really fix that.
Am I a genius?

202
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,646
No, you're an asshole.
Fix the door, Bender.
What a funny guy.

203
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,655
Everyone, just shh.
I've been here before.
I know what I'm doing.

204
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,008
[Boy]
No. Fix the door.!
[Bender] Shut up.!

205
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,608
Goddamn it.!

206
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,226
Why is that door closed?

207
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:43,189
Why is that door closed?
How are we supposed to know?
We're not supposed to move.

208
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:50,445
- Why?
- We're just sitting here
like we're supposed to.

209
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,371
Who closed that door?

210
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,552
- I think a screw fell out of it.
- It just closed, sir.

211
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,886
Who?
[Squeaks]

212
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,319
- She doesn't talk, sir.
- [Girl Squeaks]

213
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,335
- [Vernon]
Give me that screw.
- I don't have it.

214
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,688
You want me to yank you
out of that seat?

215
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,787
I don't have it.
Screws fall out all the time.
The world's an imperfect place.

216
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,742
Give it to me, Bender.

217
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,137
Excuse me, sir.
Why would anybody
want to steal a screw?

218
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,509
Watch it, young lady.

219
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:32,044
[Door Opens]

220
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,548
The door's
way too heavy, sir.

221
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,017
[Vernon]
Damn it.!
[Clattering]

222
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,231
Andrew Clark,
get up here.

223
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:59,238
[Snaps Fingers]
Come on. Front and center.
Let's go.

224
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,802
- Hey, how come Andrew
gets to get up?
- That's right.

225
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:05,411
If he gets up, we'll all get up.
It'll be anarchy.!

226
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,380
Watch-Watch
the magazines.
It's out of my hands.

227
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:19,717
That's very clever, sir,
but what if there's a fire?

228
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,259
I think violating fire codes
and endangering the lives of children...

229
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,497
would be unwise at this juncture
in your career, sir.

230
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:30,063
All right. What are you doing
with this? Get this out of here,
for God's sake.

231
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,613
What's the matter with you?
Come on.

232
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,609
You know, the school
comes equipped with fire exits
at either end of the library.

233
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:39,082
- Show Dick some respect.
- Let's go.

234
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,622
Go. Get back in your seat.

235
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:47,784
I expected a little more
from a varsity letterman.

236
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,051
You're not fooling
anybody, Bender.

237
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,890
The next screw that
falls out is gonna be you.

238
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:59,058
- Eat my shorts.
- What was that?

239
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:04,641
Eat... my... shorts.

240
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,681
You just bought yourself
another Saturday, mister.

241
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,267
- Oh, I'm crushed.
- You just bought
one more right there.

242
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,280
Well, I'm free the Saturday
after that. Beyond that,
I'll have to check my calendar.

243
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:17,124
Good! Because it's gonna be filled.
We'll keep going.

244
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,920
You want another one?
Say the word. Just say the word.

245
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,834
Instead of going to prison,
you'll come here.

246
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,987
- Are you through?
- No.

247
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:30,766
I'm doing society a favor.
That's another right now.
So?

248
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,667
I've got you for the rest
of your life if you don't
watch your step.

249
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,730
You want another one?
Yes.

250
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,968
You got it.! You got
another one right there.
That's another one, pal.

251
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,105
Cut it out!

252
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,410
- [Mouthing]
Stop.
- You through?

253
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,473
Not even close, bud.

254
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,642
- You got one more right there.
- You really think I give a shit?

255
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,692
Another.

256
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,952
- You through?
- How many is that?

257
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,689
That's seven, including
the one when you asked
Mr. Vernon here...

258
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,965
whether Barry Manilow knew
he raided his closet.

259
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,524
- Now it's eight. Stay out of it.
- Excuse me, sir. It's seven.

260
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,133
Shut up, peewee.

261
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,675
You're mine, Bender.
For two months, I got ya.

262
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,216
I got ya.

263
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:19,182
What can I say?
I'm thrilled.

264
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:23,192
Oh, I sure that's exactly
what you want these people
to believe. You know something?

265
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:26,456
You ought to spend
a little more time trying to
do something with yourself...

266
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:29,396
and a little less time
trying to impress people.

267
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:33,192
You might be better off.
All right. That's it!

268
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,496
I'm gonna be
right outside those doors.

269
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:40,158
The next time
I have to come in here,
I'm cracking skulls.

270
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,508
Fuck you!

271
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,021
[Sighs]

272
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,453
Fuck.

273
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,689
Wake up!

274
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,305
Who has to go
to the lavatory?

275
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:16,966
- That's real intelligent.
- You're right.

276
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,019
It's wrong
to destroy literature.

277
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,928
It's such fun to read.

278
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,331
And...

279
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,862
"Molay" really pumps my nads.

280
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:32,672
Moliere.

281
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,040
I love his work.

282
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:49,194
Big deal. Nothing to do
when you're locked in a vacancy.

283
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,232
Speak for yourself.

284
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:56,957
Do you think I'd speak for you?
I don't even know your language.

285
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:00,776
Hey, you grounded tonight?

286
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,300
I don't know. My mom said I was.
My dad told me just to blow her off.

287
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:13,409
There's a big party at Stubby's.
His parents are in Europe.

288
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:16,946
It should be pretty wild.
Are you going to go?
Yeah?

289
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,781
- I doubt it.
- How come?

290
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,850
'Cause if I do what my mother
tells me not to do, it's because
my father says it's okay.

291
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:28,261
It's like this whole, big monster deal.
It's endless. It's a total drag.

292
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,274
It's like,
any minute, divorce.

293
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:33,796
- Who do you like better?
- What?

294
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:37,003
- You like your old man
better than your mom?
- They're both screwed.

295
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,576
No, I mean, if you had
to choose between 'em.

296
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:45,441
I don't know. Probably go live

00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:59,047
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

448
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:01,284
Let's just drop it, okay?
We'll talk about it later.

449
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,830
- What are you talking about?
- Brian's trying to tell me...

450
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:07,165
that in addition to the number of girls
in the Niagara Falls area...

451
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:11,132
that presently you and he
are riding the hobby horse.

452
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,693
- Little pig.
- No, I'm not.

453
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:17,002
John said I was a cherry,
and I said I wasn't.
That's all that was said.

454
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,845
Then what were you
motioning to Claire for?

455
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:23,871
- I don't appreciate this
very much, Brian.
- He is lying.

456
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:27,179
You weren't motioning
to Claire?

457
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:30,982
You know he's lying, right?
Were you or were you not
motioning to Claire?

458
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:34,556
Yeah, but it was only...

459
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,536
It was only because
I didn't want her
to know I was a virgin.

460
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,964
Excuse me for
being a virgin. I'm sorry.

461
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,973
[Scoffs]
Why didn't you want me
to know you were a virgin?

462
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:47,236
Because it's personal business.
It's my personal, private
business.

463
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:49,576
Well, Brian, it doesn't sound
like you're doing any business.

464
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,341
I think it's okay
for a guy to be a virgin.

465
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:56,039
You do?

466
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,451

Where's your lunch?

00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:15,287
You're wearing it.
You're nauseating.

469
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:32,345
What's that?

470
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:36,037
- Sushi.
- Sushi?

471

[Laughs]
Rice, raw fish
and seaweed.

472

You won't accept
a guy's tongue in your mouth,
and you're gonna eat that?

00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,188

00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,697

00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:51,313
PB&J with the crusts cut off.

483
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,719
Well, Brian, this is
a very nutritious lunch.

How's yours?
Super.

Say, son, how'd you like
to go fishing this weekend?

Great, Dad.
But I've got homework to do.

That's all right, son.

- You want to come over sometime?

That's the last time, Bender.

That's the last time you ever
make me look bad in front of
those kids. You hear me?

603
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:09,167
I make $31,000 a year,
and I've got a home.

take your word over mine?

Come on. Right here.

Please. I'm begging you.
Take a shot. Right here.

01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:47,061
I'll do what
I have to do.

748
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:50,427
Why do you have to
do anything?

749
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:55,527
My home life...
is unsatisfying.

750
01:01:57,114 --> 01:01:59,344
So you're saying you'd subject yourself
to the violent dangers...

751
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:02,916
of these Chicago streets
because your home life is unsatisfying?

752
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:04,926
I don't have to run away
and live in the street.

753
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:06,918
I can run away
and go to the ocean.

754
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,920
I can go to the country,
to the mountains.

755
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:12,592
I could go to Israel,
Africa... Afghanistan.

756
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,898
Andy, wanna get in
on this?

757
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:27,144
Allison here says
she wants to run away...

758
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:31,081
because her home life
is unsatisfying.

759
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,816
Well, everyone's home life
is unsatisfying.

760
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,586
And if it wasn't,
people would live
with their parents forever.

761
01:02:39,656 --> 01:02:42,896
Yeah, yeah, I understand,
but I think hers goes beyond...

762
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,660
what, you know,
guys like you and me
consider normal unsatisfying.

763
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:51,461
Never mind. Forget it.
Everything's cool.

764
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:54,205
- What's the deal?
- No.

765
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,641
There's no deal, sporto.

766
01:02:56,707 --> 01:02:59,437
Forget it.
Leave me alone.
Wait a minute.

767
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:02,529
You're carrying all that crap
around in your purse.

768
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:06,103
Either you really wanna
run away, or you want people
to think you wanna run away.

769
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:08,913
Eat shit!

770
01:03:10,721 --> 01:03:14,881
The girl is an island
unto herself, okay?

771
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:27,174
Hi.

772
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:29,227
You wanna talk?
No.

773
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:33,076
Why not?
Go away.

774
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:37,041
Where do you
want me to go?
Go away!

775
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:50,681
- You have problems.
- Oh, I have problems.

776
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:53,731
You do everything
everybody tells you to do.
That is a problem.

777
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:56,487
Okay, fine.
But I didn't dump my purse
out on the couch...

778
01:03:56,566 --> 01:04:02,096
and invite people
into my problems, did I?

779
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:08,707
So what's wrong?

780
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:12,053
What is it?

781
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:17,377
[Sighs]
Is it bad?

782
01:04:18,822 --> 01:04:20,952
Real bad?

783
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:22,964
Parents?

784
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:40,301
Yeah.

785
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,910
What did they do to you?

786
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:56,921
They ignore me.

787
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,231
Yeah.

788
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:04,966
Yeah.

789
01:05:07,804 --> 01:05:10,294
What did you wanna be
when you were young?

790
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:15,139
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be John Lennon.

791
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:18,613
Carl, don't be a goof.

792
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:21,312
I'm trying to make
a serious point here.

793
01:05:21,385 --> 01:05:24,255
Carl, I've been teaching
for 22 years.

794
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:29,626
And each year, these kids
get more and more arrogant.

795
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:32,463
Oh, bullshit, man.
Come on, Vern.

796
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:36,189
- The kids haven't changed,
you have.
- [Sighs]

797
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:40,466
You took a teaching position
'cause you thought
it'd be fun, right?

798
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:43,697
Thought you could have
summer vacations off.

799
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:47,614
And then you found out
it was actually work.
That really bummed you out.

800
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,343
These kids turned on me.

801
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:58,525
They think
I'm a big fucking joke.
Come on.

802
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:03,348
Listen, Vern. If you were 16,
what would you think of you?

803
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:08,157
Hey, Carl, you think
I give one rat's ass
what these kids think of me?

804
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:10,631
Yes, I do.

805
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:15,100
You think about this.
When you get old, these kids...

806
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:18,162
when I get old... they're gonna be
running the country.

807
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:20,401
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

808
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:23,877
Now this is the thought
that wakes me up
in the middle of the night.

809
01:06:25,282 --> 01:06:28,842
When I get older,
these kids are gonna
take care of me.

810
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:32,547
I wouldn't count on it.

811
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:39,359
What would I do
for a million bucks?

812
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:42,289
I guess I'd do
as little as I had to.

813
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,835
That's boring.
Well, how am I
supposed to answer?

814
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:49,201
The idea is to, like, search your mind
for the absolute limit.

815
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:53,572
Like, um... would you
drive to school naked?

816
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:56,113
[Chuckles]

817
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:59,699
Um... would I have to
get out of the car?

818
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:03,723
- Of course.
- In the spring or winter?

819
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:05,717
[Claire]
Doesn't matter. Spring.

820
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:08,279
[Andy]
In front of the school
or in back of the school?

821
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:11,258
- Either one.
- Yes.

822
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:13,688
I'd do that.

823
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:17,133
I'll do anything sexual.
I don't need a million dollars
to do it either.

824
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:21,598
- You're lying.
- I already have.

825
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:25,071
I've done just about
everything there is, except
a few things that are illegal.

826
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:30,936
- I'm a nymphomaniac.
- Lie.

827
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:33,074
Are your parents
aware of this?

828
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:35,980
The only person I told
was my shrink.

829
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,212
What did he do
when you told him?

830
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:40,308
He nailed me.

831
01:07:44,294 --> 01:07:46,234
Very nice.

832
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:48,396
I don't think that
from a legal standpoint...

833
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:51,465
what he did can be construed as rape
since I paid him.

834
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:55,635
- He's an adult.
- Yeah. He's married too.

835
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:59,905
Oh! Do you have any idea
how completely gross that is?

836
01:07:59,976 --> 01:08:03,246
Well, the first
few times...
The first few times?

837
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:05,643
You mean, he did it
more than once?
Sure.

838
01:08:05,715 --> 01:08:09,175
Are you crazy?
Obviously she's crazy
if she's screwing her shrink.

839
01:08:11,655 --> 01:08:13,645
Have you ever done it?

840
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:17,949
[Scoffs]
I don't even have a psychiatrist.

841
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:20,428
Have you ever done it
with a normal person?

842
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:24,627
- Didn't we already cover this?
- You never answered the question.

843
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:28,901
Look. I'm not going to discuss
my private life with total strangers.

844
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:31,032
It's kind of a
double-edged sword, isn't it?

845
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:35,437
A what?
If you say you haven't,
you're a prude.

846
01:08:35,512 --> 01:08:39,572
If you say you have,
you're a slut. It's a trap.

847
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:41,579
You want to,
but you can't.

848
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:45,481
And when you do, you wish
you didn't, right?
Wrong.

849
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:48,045
Or are you a tease?

850
01:08:49,392 --> 01:08:52,422
She's a tease.
I'm sure.
Why don't you forget it?

851
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:55,665
You're a tease
and you know it.
All girls are teases.

852
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:58,722
- She's only a tease if what
she does gets you hot.
- I don't do anything!

853
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:03,462
- That's why you're a tease.
- Okay, let me ask you
a few questions.

854
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,730
I already
told you everything.
No.

855
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:09,069
Doesn't it bother you to sleep
around without being in love?
Don't you want respect?

856
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,845
I don't screw
to get respect.

857
01:09:11,915 --> 01:09:13,855
That's the difference
between you and me.

858
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:16,007
[Scoffs]
It's not the only difference
I hope.

859
01:09:16,086 --> 01:09:18,686
[Bender]
Face it, you're a tease.
I'm not a tease.

860
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:20,955
Sure you are.
Sex is your weapon.

861
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:23,924
You said it yourself.
You use it to get respect.

862
01:09:23,994 --> 01:09:27,764
No, I never said that.
She twisted my words around.

863
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:30,921
- What do you use it for then?
- I don't use it, period!

864
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:34,531
Are you medically frigid
or is it psychological?

865
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:38,004
I didn't mean it that way.
You guys are putting words
into my mouth.

866
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:40,874
- Just answer the question.
- [Brian] Why don't you
just answer the question?

867
01:09:40,944 --> 01:09:43,814
Be honest.
No big deal.
Yeah, answer it.

868
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,680
- Just answer the question.
- Talk to us.
- Answer the question.!

869
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:49,380
Don't be a jerk.!
It's easy.
It's only one question.

870
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:51,852
No, I never did it!

871
01:09:56,426 --> 01:09:59,726
I never did it either.

872
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:05,001
I'm not a nymphomaniac.
I'm a compulsive liar.

873
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:08,632
You are such a bitch!

874
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,975
You did that on purpose
just to fuck me over.!

875
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:15,672
I would do it though.
If you love someone, it's okay.

876
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,140
[Claire]
I can't believe you.
You're so weird.

877
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,185
You don't say anything all day,
and then when
you open your mouth...

878
01:10:22,252 --> 01:10:25,082
you unload all these
tremendous lies all over me.

879
01:10:25,155 --> 01:10:28,685
You're just pissed off because
she got you to admit something
you didn't want to admit to.

880
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:31,118
Okay, fine.
But that doesn't make it
any less bizarre.

881
01:10:31,194 --> 01:10:35,294
What's bizarre?
I mean, we're all
pretty bizarre.

882
01:10:35,365 --> 01:10:37,665
Some of us are just
better at hiding it, that's all.

883
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,764
How are you bizarre?

884
01:10:42,138 --> 01:10:44,068
He can't think for himself.

885
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:48,699
She's right.

886
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:52,838
Do you guys know what, uh,
what I did to get in here?

887
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,610
I taped Larry Lester's
buns together.

888
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:58,686
- [Laughs]
- That was you?

889
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:02,715
- Yeah. You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

890
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:05,452
Then you know how hairy
he is, right?

891
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:09,823
When they pulled
the tape off...

892
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:13,389
most of his hair came off
and some skin too.

893
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:15,800
Oh, my God.

894
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:18,632
The bizarre thing is...

895
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,798
is that I did it
for my old man.

896
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:25,369
I tortured this poor kid...

897
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:28,238
because I wanted him
to think that I was cool.

898
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:35,280
He's always going off about,
you know, when he was in school.

899
01:11:35,358 --> 01:11:38,808
All the wild things
he used to do.

900
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:44,735
And I got the feeling that
he was disappointed that I never
cut loose on anyone, right?

901
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:51,127
So, I'm sittin'
in the locker room...

902
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:53,697
and I'm taping up my knee.

903
01:11:55,445 --> 01:12:00,245
And Larry's undressing
a couple lockers down from me.

904
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:04,948
And... he's kind of...

905
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:06,951
he's kind of skinny.

906
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:09,683
He's weak.

907
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:13,629
And I started thinking
about my father...

908
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:18,066
and his attitude about...
about weakness.

909
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:22,034
And the next thing I knew...

910
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:26,305
I jumped on top of him
and started wailing on him.

911
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:31,771
And my friends, they just laughed
and cheered me on.

912
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:38,307
And afterwards...

913
01:12:38,388 --> 01:12:41,448
when I was sitting
in Vernon's office...

914
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:47,220
all I could think about...

915
01:12:47,297 --> 01:12:50,817
was Larry's father...

916
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:54,890
and Larry
having to go home...

917
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:59,371
and... and explain
what happened to him.

918
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:07,039
And... the humiliation...

919
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:10,246
fucking humiliation
he must have felt.

920
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,680
It must have been unreal.

921
01:13:18,294 --> 01:13:22,194
I mean, how do you apologize
for something like that?

922
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:27,932
There's no way.

923
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:34,768
It's all because of me
and my old man.

924
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:40,912
God, I fucking hate him.

925
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,510
He's like this...
He's like this mindless machine
that I can't relate to anymore.

926
01:13:50,026 --> 01:13:55,266
Andrew.!
You've got to be number one.!

927
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:57,851
I won't tolerate any losers
in this family.

928
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:02,734
Your intensity is for shit!
Win! Win! Win!

929
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,940
You son of a bitch.

930
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:14,306
You know sometimes
I wish my knee would give...

931
01:14:14,384 --> 01:14:17,414
then I wouldn't be able
to wrestle anymore.

932
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:21,617
Then he could forget
all about me.

933
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:24,921
I think your old man
and my old man should get
together and go bowling.

934
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:26,964
[Chuckles]

935
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,130
It's like me, you know,
with my grades.

936
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:37,602
Like when l... when l...
when I step outside myself...

937
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:40,944
and like when I look in
at myself, you know.

938
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,840
And l... And I see me.

939
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:51,082
I don't like what I see.

940
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:54,648
I really don't.

941
01:14:54,724 --> 01:14:59,794
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you like yourself?

942
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:01,852
Sounds stupid, but...

943
01:15:05,735 --> 01:15:07,675
because I'm failing shop.

944
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:14,175
We had this assignment,
you know, to make this,
like, ceramic elephant...

945
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,543
and we had eight weeks
to do it.

946
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:20,173
And then, you know,
we're supposed to... It was like a lamp.

947
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:24,179
And when, you know,
when you pull it, the trunk,
the light was supposed to go on.

948
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:29,279
But my light didn't go on.

949
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:31,479
I got an "F" on it.

950
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:34,659
I've never got an "F" in my life.

951
01:15:36,065 --> 01:15:38,665
When I signed up, you know,
for the course, I mean...

952
01:15:38,735 --> 01:15:40,765
I thought I was playing it
real smart, you know...

953
01:15:40,837 --> 01:15:42,857
'cause I thought, you know,
I'll take shop.

954
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:45,369
It'll be such
an easy way to maintain
my grade point average.

955
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:47,371
Why'd you think
it'd be easy?

956
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:51,976
Have you seen some of the dopes
that take shop?

957
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:55,978
I take shop.
You must be a fuckin'idiot.

958
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,852
I'm a fuckin' idiot
'cause I can't make a lamp?

959
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,480
No, you're a genius 'cause
you can't make a lamp.

960
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:03,256
What do you know
about trigonometry?

961
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:05,096
I could care less
about trigonometry.

962
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:08,061
Bender, did you know
without trigonometry,
there'd be no engineering?

963
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:09,991
Without lamps,
there'd be no light.

964
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:13,836
Okay, so neither one of you
is any better than the other one.

965
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,233
I can write with my toes.

966
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:19,705
I can also eat,
brush my teeth...

967
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:21,946
With your feet?

968
01:16:22,011 --> 01:16:25,101
- Play "Heart And Soul" on the piano.
- I can make spaghetti.

969
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:29,079
What can you do?

970
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:32,422
I can, uh, tape
all of your buns together.

971
01:16:32,488 --> 01:16:35,388
I wanna see
what Claire can do.

972
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,188
- I can't do anything.
- Everybody can do something.

973
01:16:40,163 --> 01:16:42,933
There's one thing I can do.

974
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:46,299
- No, forget it.
It's way too embarrassing.
- You ever seen Wild Kingdom?

975
01:16:46,369 --> 01:16:48,299
That guy's been doing
that show for 30 years.

976
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:54,305
Okay. But you have to swear
to God you won't laugh.

977
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:56,467
[Scoffs]

978
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,410
Okay.

979
01:17:01,317 --> 01:17:05,217
I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

980
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:19,128
[Applause]
Yea.!

981
01:17:19,202 --> 01:17:23,732
All right. That's great!
Where'd you learn to do that?

982
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:25,746
Camp.
Seventh grade.

983
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:28,828
[Slow Clapping]

984
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,310
That was great, Claire.

985
01:17:34,617 --> 01:17:36,907
My image of you
is totally blown.

986
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:41,116
You're a shit.
Don't do that to her. You swore
to God you wouldn't laugh.

987
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,990
- Am I laughing?
- You fuckin' prick!

988
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,799
What do you care
what I think anyway?

989
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:54,523
I don't even count,
right?

990
01:17:54,604 --> 01:17:57,334
I could disappear forever
and it wouldn't make any difference.

991
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:03,775
I may as well not even exist
at this school, remember?

992
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,879
And you...
don't like me anyway.

993
01:18:09,952 --> 01:18:12,922
You know, I have
just as many feelings
as you do...

994
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:15,509
and it hurts just as much
when somebody steps
all over them.

995
01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:17,561
[Bender]
God, you're so pathetic.

996
01:18:17,627 --> 01:18:22,717
Don't you ever,
ever compare yourself to me, okay?

997
01:18:22,799 --> 01:18:24,789
You got everything,
and I got shit.

998
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:27,927
Fuckin'Rapunzel, right?

999
01:18:28,004 --> 01:18:31,234
School would probably shut down
if you didn't show up.

1000
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:33,927
Queenie isn't here.

1001
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:37,570
I like those earrings,
Claire.
Shut up.

1002
01:18:37,647 --> 01:18:40,077
Are those real diamonds,
Claire?
Shut up!

1003
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:44,079
I bet they are.
Did you work for the money...

1004
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:46,853
Shut your mouth!
For those earrings?

1005
01:18:46,923 --> 01:18:49,653
Or did your daddy
buy those for you?
Shut up!

1006
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,955
I bet he bought those
for you.

1007
01:18:52,028 --> 01:18:55,958
I bet those were
a Christmas gift, right?

1008
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:58,002
You know what I got
for Christmas this year?

1009
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:02,897
It was a banner fucking year
at the old Bender family.
I got a carton of cigarettes.

1010
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:06,462
The old man grabbed me and said,
"Hey, smoke up, Johnny."

1011
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:09,272
Okay, so go home
and cry to your daddy.
Don't cry here, okay?

1012
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,341
[Claire Sniffling]

1013
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,948
My God, are we gonna
be like our parents?

1014
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:27,077
Not me.

1015
01:19:29,866 --> 01:19:31,806
Ever.

1016
01:19:34,003 --> 01:19:36,873
It's unavoidable.

1017
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:40,069
It just happens.

1018
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,112
[Claire]
What happens?

1019
01:19:43,546 --> 01:19:47,486
When you grow up,
your heart dies.

1020
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:51,990
- Who cares?
- I care.

1021
01:19:53,322 --> 01:19:56,622
[Brian]
Um, I was just thinking,
I mean...

1022
01:19:56,692 --> 01:20:01,562
I know it's kind of a weird time,
but I was just wondering, um...

1023
01:20:04,233 --> 01:20:06,173
what is going to happen
to us on Monday...

1024
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:08,465
when we're all
together again?

1025
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:12,599
I mean, I consider
you guys my friends.

1026
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:18,243
- I'm not wrong, am I?
- No.

1027
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:21,844
So... So on Monday,
what happens?

1028
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:24,708
Are we still friends,
you mean?

1029
01:20:24,787 --> 01:20:27,447
- If we're friends now, that is.
- Yeah.

1030
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:32,408
- Do you want the truth?
- Yeah, I want the truth.

1031
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:34,985
[Sighs]
I don't think so.

1032
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:42,303
- With all of us or just John?
- With all of you.

1033
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:46,271
That's a real nice
attitude, Claire.
Oh, be honest, Andy.

1034
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:50,472
If Brian came walking up to you
in the hall on Monday,
what would you do?

1035
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:53,646
I mean, picture this.
You're there with all the sports.

1036
01:20:53,716 --> 01:20:56,886
You know exactly what you'd do.
You'd say hi to him,
and when he left...

1037
01:20:56,953 --> 01:21:00,283
you'd cut him all up
so your friends wouldn't think
you really liked him.

1038
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:03,526
- No way.
- [Allison] Okay.

1039
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:07,462
- What if I came up to you?
- Same exact thing.

1040
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,400
You are a bitch!

1041
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:13,806
Why, 'cause I'm telling the truth?
That makes me a bitch?

1042
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,889
No, you know how shitty
that is to do to someone.

1043
01:21:15,972 --> 01:21:18,372
And you don't got the balls
to stand up to your friends...

1044
01:21:18,441 --> 01:21:20,571
and tell them you're gonna like
