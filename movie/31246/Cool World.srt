lt's not cold.

19
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,720
Even the chickens are cold.

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,960
Okay, steps.

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,960
You're all right.

Sweetie, the dinner's

The dinner's fine.

Okay.

34
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,000
Almost, almost...

36
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,120

41
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,600

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,600

46
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,840
God, Ma, you're such a mom.

47
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,520
You ready?
We're going for a ride.

48
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,640
Oh, no, no.

49
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,760

50
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,960
Ma, Ma, one ride.

51
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,840
Oh. Oh...

52
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,240
Watch this, Ma, no hands.

53
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,880
Oh, Frank, don't do that!

54
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,680
l wouldn't do that.
Come on.

55
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,800
You!

56
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,440
l'm in for five.

57
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,320
Thank you, gentlemen.

58
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,880
My pleasure.

59
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,880
Hey, girl. Get in here.

60
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,000
Whoa!

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,080
-Oh!
-Whoa!

62
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,960
This is fun, right?

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,960
Maybe.

64
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,840
Yeah.

65
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,600
-Ooh, careful.
-Hey, l'm driving here.

66
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,680
l'm home.

67
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,840
Whoo!

68
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,720
Mortar's coming!
Mortar's coming in!

69
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,880
Machine gun, right flank!
Machine gun, right flank!

70
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Medic!

71
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,120
That's when you saw them, huh?

72
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,040
Well, it works.

73
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
My Spike works.

74
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,520
Okay. Okay.

75
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,480
Easy, easy.

76
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,600
Okay.

77
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,760
-Take it easy.
-Take it easy.

78
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,000
No!

79
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,840
l've got a headache.

80
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,240
Have you got some Wite-Out?

81
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,120
Ma!

82
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,120
Ma!

83
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,880
You don't know

84
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,800
what it is you
got yourself into, bud,

85
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,920
but you're a long way from home.

86
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,160
Oh, but it's so confusing.

87
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,120
Where to go,
where to go... yes...

88
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,400
Ma!

89
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,840
Oh, bother.

90
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
What the hell are you?

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,680
They're doodles.

92
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,000
Cartoons?

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,480
Don't get too close, Doc.

94
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,800
l can't believe what l've done.

95
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,040
My Spike was supposed
to send me to your world,

96
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,200
but instead you're here.

97
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,200
This man's not dangerous
to anyone.

98
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,040
As for us, son, we may not
be real to you as yet...

99
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,000
...but we will be.

100
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,440
You've come
to a whole new world.

101
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,080
You've done something
extremely rare.

102
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,800
You see,
you're in a real place

103
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,760
called the Cool World.

104
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,800
Hmm.

105
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh. How strange.

106
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,440
Say " ah."

107
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,280
Ah.

108
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,800
But when it comes to making
the trip in the body...

109
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,480
Did you hear about the wolf

110
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,920
that built the studio?

111
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,880
-No, not...
-...l've never seen it before.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh!

113
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,600
Oh, my goodness.

114
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,720
l'm sorry about your mother.

115
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,680
You're cartoons.

116
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,120
You're not real.

117
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,040
Oh-ho, we're real, all right.

118
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,400
The possibility
of interworld travel

119
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,920
has been an obsession of mine
for many, many years.

120
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,040
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

121
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,680
Hey, Doc, wait.

122
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
This man is not for you.

123
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,880
He's not a police problem.

124
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,000
He's a mystery of science.

125
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,480
And a hero to boot.

126
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,760
l ain't no hero.

127
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,640
Oh, don't be so sure, friend.

128
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,840
With this hole l've opened,

129
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,960
there could be all kinds
of problems. Ha-ha.

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,840
They call me Doc Whiskers.

131
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,320
What's your name, son?

132
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,800
l'm Frank Harris.

133
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,480
What did you do
in your world?

134
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,840
l was a soldier.

135
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,480
Oh, you could be useful
here when l'm gone.

136
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,840
Where are you from?

137
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,920
Um, Vegas.

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,120
Tomorrow we're out of here.

139
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,880
You're just a drawing, Holli,

140
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,600
but without you,
l'd never have made it.

141
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh, you look good tonight, babe.

142
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,160
lt's time you came to me, Jack.

143
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,760
Come to me.

144
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,680
Ooh, baby!

145
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,920
-Hey-ya, hey-ya.
-Hey-ya, hey-ya.

146
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,080
l've been waiting for you,
darlin'

147
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,600
-Huh?
-Hmm?

148
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,040
Uh, Sparky,
uh, whatcha up to, huh?

149
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,600
What makes you think

150
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,920
l'd tell a little punk like you?

151
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,480
Why, he's going soft
for that tomato.

152
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,240
Uh... w-w-what's her name?

153
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,840
H-H-Holli or something. Yeah.

154
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,240
Enough out of you, kitty.

155
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,800
You're too young
to be thinking about girls.

156
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,000
Especially that girl.

157
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,800
Here.

158
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,920
A bunch of wooden nickels.

159
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,480
Don't spend them all
in one place.

160
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,800
W-W-What?

161
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,400
Philip flew the coop
last night.

162
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,560
Hey, Molina! Hey, Molina!

163
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,480
Come over here.

164
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,160
Did you step in it?

165
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,600
Hey, there's
a flower on your head.

166
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,720
There's are lots of...

167
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,840
Hey.

168
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,840
Look out!

169
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,200
l hate it when she meets guys
without tellin' me.

170
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,200
l light up like

171
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,200
Neon

172
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,880
Just a tiny section of your
affection in my direction

173
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,280
Will do

174
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
Ooh.

175
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,560
-Detective Harris.

176
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,480
What a pleasure.

177
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,480
l was just rehearsing.

178
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,880
Hello, Holli.

179
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,240
This is an exact replica
of the dress Marilyn Monroe wore

180
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,480
in Let's Make Love.

181
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,400
Oh!

182
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,560
l know that movie by heart.

183
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,720
The girl gets get everything
by the end of it.

184
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,400
Everything she ever wanted.

185
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,640
lt's real.

186
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,720
l mean it.

187
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,880
l even saw
a copyright date on it.

188
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,320
Rumor has it, Holli,

189
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,480
that you had a noid visitation

190
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
at the Slash Club last night.

191
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,040
lt was just a mind slip.

192
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,080
Nothin' special.

193
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,880
You're just a regular
true believer

194
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,680
in law and order, huh?

195
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,320
Give me a couple, Jack.

196
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,440
Come on, let's go.

197
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,920
Beat it, copper.

198
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,880
Yeah.

199
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,760
-Go on, beat it.
-Beat it...

200
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,840
Just doing my job.

201
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,000
-Come on let's go.
-Come on.

202
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Hey, Frank?

203
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,800
Don't go just yet.

204
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,240
Come here.

205
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,880
l got somethin' to show you.

206
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,880
Guess what?

207
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,200
l've seen your little
museum of Vegas.

208
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,360
And don't start in
with your Vegas Vinnie rap.

209
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,440
l've heard it.
lt bores me.

210
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,240
Vegas Vinnie made the Spike--

211
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,920
crossed over and became the
owner of the Union Plaza Hotel.

212
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,240
Vegas Vinnie
is a fairy tale, Would.

213
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Doodle moms tell it to doodle
kids to help them go to sleep.

214
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,280
lt could all be true.

215
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,760
You got over here.

216
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,440
So why couldn't he make it
over there?

217
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,040
Or for that matter,
why couldn't l?

218
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,120
You could help me.

219
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,600
There'll be no crossovers
while l'm around.

220
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,360
l've got news for you, pal.

221
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,960
l am not your ordinary doodle.

222
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,160
l've been checking up

223
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,880
on what these noid dames
have got going

224
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,760
in the real world,
and l want it!

225
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,760
Don't you see?

226
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,400
They're real.

227
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,200
They've got power.

228
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,080
When they touch something,
they feel it.

229
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,440
And when
they taste something...

230
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,320
...they really taste it.

231
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,120
And when they do it
with a man...

232
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,000
...they really do it.

233
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,560
Ooh...

234
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,640
What can l say, sweetheart?

235
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,240
l can't help you out
in that department.

236
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,320
Well, don't you see?

237
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,120
Believe it.

238
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,240
l've had enough.

239
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,120
Oh, yeah? Fine.

240
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,480
You don't want to help me?

241
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,320
Then l'll find somebody else
that will.

242
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,200
Like that noid cartoonist,
Jack Deebs.

243
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,640
He's been around a lot lately.

244
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,800
Yes, he has.

245
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,040
The whack-a-do who thinks
he invented this place.

246
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,240
What do you think l've been
talking about, Holli?

247
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,320
Well, l'd watch it, honey,

248
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,880
'cause there might be
two of you before long.

249
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,320
l'm going to tell you this once

250
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,000
'cause you got to be
smarter than you look.

251
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,440
You're dealing with shit here
that's way over your head.

252
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,400
Yeah...

253
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,560
Now, keep your legs crossed

254
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,960
and forget about the real world.

255
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,920
Hmm!

256
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,480
Thank you for your time.

257
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,720
Would you look at those legs!

258
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,920
Doh!

259
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,880
Hey...!

260
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,640
Yeah.

261
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Stay cool, man.

262
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,920
l'm out of here.

263
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,560
Hey, Bobby, let's go.

264
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

265
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,200
Hey.

266
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,720
What are you guys doing?

267
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,680
Get off the lawn.

268
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,320
-Shut up.
-What?

269
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,880
Get your ball
and get out of here.

270
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,760
No!

271
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,320
Hi, Gail, it's me, Jennifer.

272
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,160
What do you mean?
l'm here.

273
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,360
Yeah, l'll call you
later tonight, okay?

274
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,560
Thank you.

275
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,680
Oh, boy. Another addict, huh?

276
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,400
Uh-huh.

277
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,280
My God, it's you, isn't it?

278
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,480
You're Jack Deebs, the creator
of Cool World, right?

279
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,440
Mm-hmm.

280
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,400
Oh, my God.

281
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,520
l can't believe this.

282
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,640
Do you have any idea

283
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,960
what kind of an inspiration
your work is to people?

284
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,160
No, l, uh...

285
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,920
l mean, l know people--
friends of mine who want to be

286
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,640
Holli Would
when they grow up.

287
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,640
-Really?
-Yeah.

288
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,560
Sparks, the goons, all of them.

289
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,160
Oh, man.

290
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,080
Your stuff, it's like crucial

291
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
spiritual nourishment
for people.

292
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,040
They live on it.

293
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,040
Oh, man.

294
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,040
lf my boss was here,

295
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,120
he'd , like, throw himself
on the ground right now

296
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,880
and give you a lifetime
gift certificate

297
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,840
-to this place.
-Really?

298
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,800
Oh, yeah.

299
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,400
He's kind of crazy.

300
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,200
Hey, would you sign this
for him?

301
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,680
Thank you.

302
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,960
Thanks. Oh, go ahead.

303
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,720
Cool, Mike.

304
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,760
So, um...

305
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,960

Yeah?

308
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,360
Well, um, when
this place closes down,

309
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,520
l go down to this place
right off the strip for coffee.

310
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,840
They, uh, read poetry,

311
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,520
do jazz, you know.

312
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,200
Problem is, you know,

315
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,040

316
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,200
Uh... but it's really
nice of you to ask.

317
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,720
-Sure.
-Thank you.

318
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,960
Hey, Deebs,

319
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,280
why don't you do a book
on that guy you murdered?

320
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,680
You know, that guy

321
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,280
you found in bed with your wife.

322
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,400
So, uh, what do l...?

Oh, okay. Thanks.

Thanks.

327
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,760
Who are you?

328
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,720
Who am l?

329
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,680

00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,080
-Nice meeting you, Jack.
-Nice to meet you.

334
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,200

He loves me, he loves me not.

377
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,040
He loves me...

378
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,760
He loves me.

379
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,280
Now, be nice.

380
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,520
Nice.

Nice.

382
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,360
Nice.

383
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,680
Ooh, hello, Holli.

384
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,800
Ooh, you never cease
to amaze me.

385
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,640
How fabulous your hair

386
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
looks today.

387
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,160
Boy...

388
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,560
can she knock it back.

389
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,480
Hey, hey, how about
saving some for me?

390
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,880
Please!

391
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,880
Hey, come on, come on!

392
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,960
Holli wants to get
a look at you. Come on.

393
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,040
Oh, yeah.

394
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,320
Oh, that's a nice little boy.

395
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,280
Come, darling, she awaits.

396
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,440
A little closer.

397
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,320
Let her see you.
Ah, yeah.

398
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,160
Welcome to my world...
big man.

399
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,280
Am l...

400
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,120
Am l dreaming?

401
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,960
Am l dreaming you?

402
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,760
Or are you dreaming me?

403
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,280
l drew you.

404
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,520
l made you.

405
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,200
Hey, l...

406
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,440
maybe l can erase you.

407
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,160
You wouldn't erase me, baby.

408
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,280
You're too hungry
for what l got.

409
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,840
No, l'm , uh...

410
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,040
l'm trying to quit.

411
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,960
Since it's only a dream,

412
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,880
indulge your
fantasies, Jack.

413
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,240
You're so real, so strong.

414
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,000
You could help comb my hair,
tickle my mind, and...

415
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,080
Yes, l have failed.

416
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,160
Thank you.

417
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,720
l'm calm now.

418
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,480
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo!

419
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,360
Filthy bad guys
didn't play fair.

420
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,280
l want you to tear and rip
their miserable faces inside out

421
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,240
till their mother
doesn't recognize them.

422
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,400
Pretty please?

423
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,760
Let's go, guys.
Come on.

424
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,080
Wait for me!

425
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,680
l got news for you, baby.

426
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,480
l'm made of ink...

427
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,720
but l'm no dream.

428
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,200
Ah!

429
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,840
What'd you do that for?

430
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,360
Because l dig you.

431
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,520
This is a long dream.

432
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,760
lsn't it, Jack?

433
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,840
The poppers.

434
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,200
Let's burn.

435
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,440
What?

436
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,720
Let's go.
Come on.

437
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,360
Come on.

438
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,040
To the left.

439
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,560
Do you like it, Deebs?

440
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,920
Yeah.

441
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,360
Course you do.

442
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,240
This is your idea
of heaven, right?

443
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,120
Yeah, it's , uh...

444
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,320
it's amazing, it's incredible.

445
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,400
But l won.

446
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,680
Little late for a lady

447
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
to be out on the streets,
don't you think?

448
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,400
l got a couple of questions
for you, miss.

449
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,040
Aw, come on, Officer.
Let it slide, would ya?

450
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,520
l'm tired.

451
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,280
Word is, you got
a thing for noids.

452
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,680
Yeah, l got a thing
for noids.

453
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,040
But what's it to you,

454
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
tough guy?

455
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,760
Baby, baby, you don't
know how tough it is.

456
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,880
You're late.

457
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,040
Aw, you're killing me.

458
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,360
Why are you so beautiful?

459
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,520
Mm-mm-mm.

460
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,320
What's wrong?
You don't look right.

461
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,600
Aw, it's Holli.

462
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,760
l think she's in heat again.

463
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,360
With that noid from last night?

464
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,640
Oh, don't worry about it.

465
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,600
You know that. Wh-Why you always
want to bust...?

466
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,720
Gotcha.

467
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,400
All right.
Where you wanna go?

468
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,520
Uh, movies?
Uh, dinner...?

469
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,920
We have abused the privilege...

470
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,240
Our color is fading.

471
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,920
Repent, repent, all toons.

472
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,880
Listen to me.
The end is near.

473
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,200
Hey, Boss, we gotta go. We...

474
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,720
A thousand pardons.

475
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,440
An informer told me
he's here again.

476
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,600
Holli and the goons got him.

477
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,680
He's not just coming
through on a dream.

478
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,120
Perhaps it is time
to pursue other avenues.

479
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,400
Right, let's hit the bricks.

480
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,560
Yeah, yeah, l know.

481
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,200
Be careful, Frank.

482
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,000
Oh, l think she's partial
to you.

483
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,680
Yeah, but facts is facts.

484
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,920
She's a doodle, and l'm not.

485
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,000
Eh, l guess,

486
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,080
but did l ever tell you
about the time

487
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,880
l took up with the most
delightfully-stacked hussy

488
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,880
from the projects?

489
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,120
Yeah.

490
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,120
Right. Where to, Boss?

491
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,320
The club.

492
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,360
All right.

493
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,680
Aye, aye, aye!

494
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,600
Hey, Baby, how you doing?

495
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,560
Chico?

496
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,440
Chico, is that you?

497
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,400
l ain't no Chico, runt.

498
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,640
And no noids.

499
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,800
He's with me.

500
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,720
Sorry, baby.
No noids.

501
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,280
He is with me, too.

502
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,040
Can't let the neighbors
push us around, can we?

503
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,560
Freeze, asshole.

504
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,520
Uh-oh!

505
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,440
Cool World Police.

506
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,520
Ooh!

507
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,480
Copper!

508
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
Up against the wall.

509
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,040
Get your hands off me.

510
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,200
Where are your manners, Harris?

511
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,200
You, be quiet.

512
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,760
Hey, who are you?

513
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,880
Who are you?
l didn't create you.

514
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,760
No shit, Sherlock.

515
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,960
What'd you do with this, Deebs?

516
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,920
l'm a cartoonist.
l drew all this.

517
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,120
l have visions, l...

518
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,240
l have visions.
l translate this.

519
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,320
You do nothing, man.

520
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,400
This place exists
with or without you.

521
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,280
You believe me, right?
l'm not one of your creations.

522
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,560
Don't believe him!

523
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,160
No, you're not pretty enough.

524
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,520
Good one.

525
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,840
Have a seat.

526
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,920
Ordinary fountain pen, right?

527
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,920
Yeah.

528
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,360
Wrong. Around here...

529
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,800
Sit down!

530
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,680
Around here, this
can be a big nuisance.

531
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,640
You thirsty, Nails?

532
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,360
Whoa!

533
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,800
Get it?

534
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,920
One should be careful
how they wave this thing.

535
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,360
No, l don't get it.

536
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,640
Of course
you don't get it,

537
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,840
because you're a wackadoo.

538
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,080
But here you are, Jack.

539
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,000
And around here,
everything goes.

540
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,960
Everything
except one thing!

541
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,680
-Yeah, what?
-Yeah, yeah,

542
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,920
we know.

543
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,240
What's that?

544
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,560
noids do not have sex
with doodles.

545
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,720
Right? noids do not
have sex with doodles!

546
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,280
lt's the oldest law
in Cool World.

547
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,480
l've never had to enforce it,

548
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,720
but you cross that line,

549
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,560
and l'll slap you around,
make you piss like a puppy.

550
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,560
Jack...

551
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,520
you think she's got a thing
for you, don't you?

552
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,120
That's sweet.

553
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,600
But don't flatter
yourself.

554
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,760
She's a waste of ink.

555
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,760
Oh, yeah?

556
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,400
The truth is,
she's been after me

557
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,560
and every other noid
who's come through here.

558
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,640
lt's just that no one's
been insane enough

559
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,120
to get involved with her.

560
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,360
You keep your pencil
in your pocket.

561
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,840
You know what l mean?

562
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,880
Yeah.

563
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,440
l'll remember that, Officer.

564
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,920
You can go now.

565
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,960
Where did you get your
hair done, by the way?

566
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,400
Get out of here.

567
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,480
All right, the show's over!

568
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
So, Harris,
you could have beat him.

569
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,000
You could have beat him.

570
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,920
You could of been somebody.

571
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,280
Oh, you're not yellow,
are you, Harris?

572
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,840
You did well, Jack.

573
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,080
Hey, sexy.

574
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,480
Mmm. lt's the man
with the badge.

575
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,960
ln the flesh.

576
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,560
Don't remind me.

577
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,560
Oh-ho-ho.

578
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,320
How can l help it?

579
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,240
-Ah.
-Mmm.

580
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,040
What are you doing to me?

581
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,040
You're messing me up.

582
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,960
Oh, honey, you're tense.

583
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,720
lt's Holli again, isn't it?

584
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,160
Yeah, Miss Holli
Would if she could.

585
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,400
That dame...

586
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,640
You heard anything?

587
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,360
Now, you know l don't listen
to that sleazy cow.

588
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,960
Mmm!

589
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,440
Mmm!

590
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,440
Don't . Just don't .

591
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,840
Well, why?

592
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,560
Because we can never finish it,
Lonette, you know?

593
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,640
lt-it-it's frustrating.

594
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,080
l'm , uh...

595
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,960
l'm like a... l'm like a plug
without a socket, you know?

596
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,240
Hey, Frank?

597
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,040
Hey, what?

598
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,520
Did you ever do it
in the Real World?

599
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,360
Do you ever think about
going back there so you can?

600
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,800
No.

601
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,280
No way.

602
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,800
Maybe you and me?

603
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,760
l can't have that
in the Real World.

604
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,440
Uh-uh. l can't live without you.

605
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,240
But l can't be with you,
you know?

606
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,720
lt's , jus... agh!

607
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,920
What do you do, huh?

608
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,080
What do you do?

609
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,160
Well, then...

610
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,000
we're just going to have
to pretend then, aren't we?

611
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,920
Hey, Boss!

612
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,720
Ooh!

613
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,120
Boss!

614
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,560
l heard you, Nails.

615
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,560
Oh, my God, Boss!

616
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,960
l wouldn't do it!

617
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,120
Oh! Whew!

618
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,600
Hey, Boss, did l ever
tell you about...?

619
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,400
Shut up, Nails.

620
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,000
Jack.

621
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,200
Jack.

622
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,760
Come home, baby.

623
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,600
No... no... no...

624
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,480
No. No! No! No! No!

625
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,120
Glad you dropped in.

626
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,440
Well, here we are--
Holli's humble abode.

627
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,440
Do you think she'll let us in?

628
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,160
Forget it!

629
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,080
This party
is by invitation only.

630
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,160
This door has got an attitude.

631
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,880
How much further?

632
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,080
Oh, uh... l'd say
we're halfway up.

633
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,000
Or halfway down.

634
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,000
Right.

635
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,760
God, l hate heights.

636
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,200
Nails, this is no time
to catch a cold.

637
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,960
lt is not a cold, Boss.

638
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,840
l am allergic to clouds.

639
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,280
What?!

640
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,280
Ah... ah... ah...

641
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,160
Oh... oh...

642
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,360
Choo!

643
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,440
Pull this?

644
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Ah... ah...

645
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,640
Don't even think about it.

646
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,040
Ah...

647
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,080
choo!

648
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,960
That step's smashingly good!
Smashingly!

649
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,400
Yeah.

650
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,880
Make sure no one
gets out this door.

651
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,520
Oh! Oh! Absolutemont,
Boss.

652
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,720
Oh!

653
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,600
Stretcher bearers!

654
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,080
Stretcher bearers!

655
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,920
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

656
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,560
Well, hello, Harris.

657
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,240
Welcome to the party.

658
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,640
And what a swell party it is.

659
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,240
Thanks for having me.

660
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,520
l should have known
riffraff like yourself

661
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,800
would be involved
in this equation, Sparks.

662
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,400
What equation
is that, Harris?

663
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,680
l've discovered

664
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,960
that if you look for trouble,

665
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,400
you find it.

666
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,880
What's your problem?

667
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,200
Bad childhood.

668
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,200
Where's the noid?

669
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,080
You're the only noid here,
Harris.

670
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,040
Ooh!

671
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,760
Last warning.

672
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,880
You stay away from the noid,

673
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,160
or you're closed
for business permanently.

674
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,280
Have a splendid evening.

675
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,680
You want to know
what it is about you

676
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,480
that really kicks my ass,
Harris?

677
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,080
How about my foot?

678
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,520
Well, you prance around here

679
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,920
waving that gun around
like you're some big deal.

680
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,880
And all this time,
you could cross over

681
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,360
to the Real World,

682
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,000
but you haven't got the guts.

683
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,320
You don't have what
it takes to be real.

684
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,240
That makes you
a wimp in my book.

685
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,360
You may be right, Slick.

686
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,280
Be content with the cards
you've been dealt.

687
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,280
Oh!

688
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,040
What's the deal?

689
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,640
lt's getting serious, Nails.

690
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,240
Holli.

691
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,160
We got to find Jack Deebs.

692
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,480
Right.

693
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,680
Go for it!
Go for it!

694
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,040
Should l get the door for you,
Jack?

695
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,400
Oh, yeah!
Oh, Yeah!

696
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,640
Go for it, Jack!

697
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,040
You better have an appointment!

698
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,560
Go on, Jack.
Go on, Jack.

699
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,360
He does...

700
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,520
but you don't .

701
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,200
But Holli said we could watch.

702
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,360
Watch what?

703
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,760
Go on up.

704
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,000
Go on up.

705
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,600
Go on.

706
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,160
Bring me a souvenir, Jack.

707
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,800
Hey, Jack.

708
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,080
l've been waiting for you.

709
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,600
You like looking at me, Jack,
don't you?

710
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,200
Yow!

711
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,520
Man is in the bedroom.

712
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,560
Run, girls, run!
Oh-ho! Oh-ho!

713
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,560
-Okay...
-What?

714
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,920
You listen to me, uh, Holli.

715
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,240
That cop, uh, Harris, um,

716
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,320
he said we... we...

717
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,720
can't go any further
than this, Holli.

718
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,720
-l'm so hot for you, Jack.
-Yeah.

719
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,320
Are you going
to follow the rules?

720
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,280
No.

721
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,600
Or are you going to follow...
your instincts?

722
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,560
Yeah.

723
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,400
Oh, but Holli said
we could watch.

724
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,440
l'll be right back.

725
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,520
Yep! Oh, yeah! Oh! Yeah!

726
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,720
Ooh...

727
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,720
Ooh.

728
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,360
Ah... ah...

729
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,680
Ooh.

730
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,640
Mm-hmm.

731
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,200
We're almost there.

732
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,040
Whoa! Okay...

733
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,280
Whoa... whoa!

734
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,400
Whoa!

735
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,000
Ooh!

736
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,160
Holli!

737
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,000
Holli...

738
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,400
Whoa...

739
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,880
Mm, was it good for you?

740
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,360
lt wasn't what l expected.

741
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,960
Y-You gonna go in there

742
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,760
and-and make it up
to Lonette, boss?

743
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,320
Yeah, why not.

744
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,600
The fact is,
she's the best thing that

745
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,760
ever happened to me.

746
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,960
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

747
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,320
Oh, l could put overtime
in on Deebs' Porsche.

748
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,800
l'm tireless.

749
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,880
Forget it.

750
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,080
The goons can't touch him
in Sweet Place,

751
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,040
and we'd just run ourselves
ragged giving him the shadow.

752
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,640
-Well... what should l do?
-Hmm?

753
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,560
Man the phones,
keep pumping our informants.

754
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,760
Somebody might l.D. him.

755
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,880
And if that happens,

756
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,920
you call me.

757
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,320
You call me here or Lonette's ,

758
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,960
my place, l don't know.

759
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,400
Just don't make a move
without me, you got it?

760
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,760
l got it, boss!

761
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,400
Oh!

762
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,240
Come on, let's go, now!

763
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,680
Hey, Lonette...
where's my drink, babe?

764
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,160
You know, l live to serve you.

765
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,040
l heard you
the first ten times.

766
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,760
Hey, come on, l'm -l'm sorry.

767
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,840
Get a little closer here,
babe, give us a kiss.

768
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,080
Say it, don't spray it.

769
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,280
Go away.

770
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,440
l'm out of here!

771
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,760
Tough night?

772
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,080
The usual.

773
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,240
Yeah.

774
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,040
Why you want to hang
around here, huh?

775
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,520
This place should be erased.

776
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,920
Hey... it's a living.

777
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,440
Even a doodle's got to eat.

778
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,320
Why don't you put that arm
around me.

779
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,360
lt's been kind of a tough day.

780
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,560
Oh...

781
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,960
Ooh!

782
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yeah?

783
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,680
Listen, you sludge hog
excuse for a cop.

784
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,000
Deebs and Holli just made it,

785
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,960
and they're about to make
an unscheduled trip

786
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,160
to the other side.

787
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,480
Ooh... Oh! Doh!

788
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,800
Holli?! Sheesh!

789
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,280
No end of trouble that
a little minx like her can make.

790
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,960
Why, she might damage the entire
interworld matrix or something.

791
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,480
l don't give a doodle!

792
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,360
Just bust her ass!

793
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,600
Ooh, better call Frank.
Better call Frank.

794
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,600
Uh, oh,
l just can't take it anymore.

795
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,360
Where's Frank?!

796
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,440
Frank! Frank Harris?
Looking for Frank!

797
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,400
Frank! Frank!

798
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,680
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

799
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,960
Where is he?! Where is he?!

800
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,560
Oh, no!

801
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,800
Frank!

802
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,920
Frank Harris!

803
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,080
Whoo!

804
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,320
Aah, aah, aah! Frank!

805
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,480
Frank! Frank!

806
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,640
Thank God!

807
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,200
Okay.

808
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,440
Yeah, Nails, what is it?

809
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,480
You having a good time,
boss, eh? Heh-heh-heh!

810
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,320
Yeah, l guess l'm
having a good time.

811
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,080
-Are we having a good time?
-Yeah.

812
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,760
Nails, leave us alone.

813
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,440
Oh, l just love
your little ears.

814
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,000
Okay, Nails, what's the problem?

815
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,840
Ooh! No trouble.

816
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,920
Nothing l can't handle myself.

817
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,320
l was just checking in
with youse. You know.

818
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,600
Yeah. You sure?

819
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,920
All right. Okay, Nails.

820
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,800
-lt's ... incredible.
-Yeah.

821
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,000
No...

822
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,280
No... no...

823
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,920
Oh...

824
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,440
Wait a minute here!

825
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,000
What am l nervous for? Oh!

826
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,560
l could do this job myself!

827
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,000
Hmm.

828
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,600
Mm... mm.

829
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,440
Mm, mm, mm.

830
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,560
Mm.

831
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,720
Ooh-ooh! Ooh! Aah!

832
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,000
Holli, why do we have
to go back?

833
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,640
lt's ... it's so great here.

834
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:05,400
Oh... but, Jack,

837
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,200
and together... together
we're gonna be unstoppable.

838

You look like

00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,240
Peace, man.

As you see, there have been
some changes around here.

868
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,400
You are a biomorphic menace.

870

00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,960
Well, we didn't mean

929
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,200

She was really
a cheap piece of work.

942
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,280
l don't know, l thought
she was kind of pretty.

943
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,960
You know, l got this

Hey!

948
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,400
What happened, you ink stain?

949
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,040
He had a run-in with a noid,

950
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,880
and then he got inked.

951

lt was Holli Would.

953
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,400
Holli is a doodle.

954
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,640
Not anymore.

955
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,800
She's made it
with that Deebs asshole.

956
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,200
She's changed.

957
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,520
Now you can buy me more fries,
dick head.

958
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,240
This is gonna be
the biggest shit storm

959
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,600
the Cool World has ever seen.

960
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,320
Round and round l go

961
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,320
Like a leaf on a tide

962
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,960
l should stay away,
but what can l do?

963
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Oh...

964
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,480
Oh. Oh.

965
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,400
So many men. Oh...

966
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,800
And they're real.

967
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,000
Oh, smell.... them.

968
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,560
Holli, Holli...

969
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,960
you're with me, remember?

970
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,880
You know, you can't go
around smelling people.

971
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,960
Yeah, Jack.

972
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,600
You sit.

973
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,720

So, uh, what do you

976
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,400
Oh.

977
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,520
Anything they have.

978
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,800
You know, they got
95 different things, Holli.

979
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,920
Mm... whoa.

980
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,320
95?

981
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,320
Uh-huh.

982
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,800
l'll have one of each.

983
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,000
Holli, you know, l'm into having
fun and everything,

984
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,920
but you got to slow down,

985
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,920
okay?

986
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,400
What l want to slow down for?

987
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,480
l'm gonna get everything
l ever wanted.

988
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,960
You think any of these men
are gonna say no to Holli?

989
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,920
Not on your life, pal.

990
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,840
Gentlemen prefer blondes.

991
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,920
Thank you very much,
everybody.

992
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,000
Glad you enjoyed that.

993
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,920
Wonderful old standard.

994
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,840
" Let's Make Love."

995
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,520
Hey! She's with me!

996
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,400
No, she's with us.

997
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,360
Hey!

998
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,760
Stay out!

999
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,000
Hit it.

1000
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,320
Uh, Brian, please.

1001
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:17,800
Here we sit and we chatter

1002
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,840
What are we thinking of?

1003
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,080
-Let's not make with the patter
-Oh, whoa.

1004
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:29,360

01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,720
Oh, my, but it's stifling

1007
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:38,880
lf you roar like a lion

1008
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:43,160
l could coo like a dove

1009
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,640
lf you're sold, begin buying

1010
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,560
Baby

1011
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,200
Let's make love

1012
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,200
Gosh, it's hot

1013
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,360
No, don't turn TV on

1014
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,560
lnstead just turn me on

1015
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:07,640
l'll light up like neon...

1016
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,080
When your partner gets inked,
you do something about it.

1017
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,400
He was your partner,
so you do something.

1018
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,360
Well, l'm not buying it.

1019
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,320
Well, how about " a man's got to
do what a man's got to do" ?

1020
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,920
Can't you just think about me

1021
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,040
for a minute, Frank?

1022
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,520
l mean, where does this
leave me?

1023
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,480
What are you mad about?

1024
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,480
Oh!

1025
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,560
l'm mad because
you talk about crossing,

1026
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,960
and-and you don't even care...

1027
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,280
l don't care?
how it makes me feel.

1028
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,640
Whoa, whoa.
How do you feel, Lon?

1029
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,920
How do you feel?

1030
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,440
Left out.

1031
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,280
You think l want
to go back there?

1032
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,960
You think l want to go back?

1033
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,720
Well, why wouldn't you
want to go back?

1034
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,160
That's real to you, isn't it?!

1035
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,920
Let me tell you something
about over there.

1036
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,480
lt hurts over there.
lt-lt's lonely over there.

1037
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,320
lt's a war over there.

1038
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,320
They got eight million ways
for you to die, hon,

1039
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,840
and all of them are permanent.

1040
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,560
This is real for me,
this. With you.

1041
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,800
And if l want to stay
with you, l got to go back.

1042
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,320
Because if Jack Deebs
and Holli Would

1043
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,680
are after what
l think they are,

1044
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,440
there won't be
any here or there.

1045
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,560
Understand, Loni?
No more here.

1046
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,080
Just go ahead!

1047
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,000
Hey, hey, hey.

1048
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,080
l'm comin' back.

1049
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,320
Jack.

1050
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,000
Jack.

1051
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,400
What's going on?

1052
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,680
Something's wrong.

1053
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,320
Something's very, very wrong.

1054
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,360
No shit, pal.

1055
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,400
So what is it?

1056
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,960
l mean, l'm ... l'm up there,
and l was just...

1057
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,280
l was moving and shaking
with the best of 'em.

1058
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,200
And all of a sudden, l was...

1059
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,680
l-l went doodle again.

1060
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,120
l mean...

1061
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,400
Look at this, Ma. No hands!

1062
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,000
Oh, Frank, don't do that!

1063
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,800
l wouldn't do that.
Come on!

1064
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,600
No!

1065
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,120
Good luck, Frank.

1066
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,960
Please just let me think.

1067
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,680
Let me think.

1068
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,720
Cool, Jack.

1069
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,720
Really cool.

1070
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,840
l guess you have a tough time

1071
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,360
driving and thinking
at the same time, huh?

1072
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,120
Oh!

1073
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,280
The Spike of Power!

1074
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,240
The what?!

1075
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,480
The Spike could heal me.

1076
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,760
Ooh, l guess Vinnie put
the Spike

1077
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,760
at the top of the casino.

1078
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,480
You're nuts.

1079
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,160
You are nuts.

1080
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,200
Don't say l'm nuts.

1081
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,440
l've had enough ego
out of you, pal.

1082
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,760
And you used to think
you made me up.

1083
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,080
You're thinking
like a doodle, Holli.

1084
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,640
There is no Spike of Power.

1085
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,520
There's got to be
a Spike of Power.

1086
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:17,000
And l'm going to find it
right now.

1087
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,120
No, you're not.

1088
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,440
Okay? Yeah.

1089
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,880
We're going there, Jack.

1090
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,280
No, we're not.

1091
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,360
You're a nice fellow, Jack.

1092
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,760
Don't piss me off.

1093
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,840
Oh, yeah?

1094
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,440
What are you going to do
about it, Holli?

1095
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,760
Huh?

1096
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:38,680
Goddamn it!

1097
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,200
What are you doing here, Harris?

1098
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,800
l'm taking you
and the bimbo back.

1099
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,560
What are you going to do?
Shoot me?

1100
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,560
Why don't you shoot me,
goddamn it!?

1101
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,960
Shoot me, Harris.

1102
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,280
Go on, shoot...

1103
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,760
Don't push me!
Don't push me!

1104
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,000
You just couldn't take

1105
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,920
a piece of good advice,
could you?

1106
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,400
No, Jack, you had to listen
to your Johnson.

1107
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,640
l've had it with you, Harris.

1108
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,000
l've had it with you,
goddamn it!

1109
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,880
You've had it with me?!

1110
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,680
You've had it with me,

1111
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:36,920
you piece of shit?

1112
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,240
You screw us all
for a piece of ass,

1113
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,200
and you've had it with me?

1114
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,200
Where is she?

1115
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,400
Great.

1116
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,040
lt's happening, Jack.

1117
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,920
Got news for you, Harris.

1118
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,920
lt's happening to her, too.

1119
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,240
Jack!

1120
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,920
Jack, l saw it this time.

1121
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,160
-Jack, l saw it. l swear it.
-Jennifer...

1122
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,120
l saw this thing.
lt ate your house again.

1123
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:05,920
Remember when we came
over earlier?

1124
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:06,560
Jennifer...

1125
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,160
l wasn't imagining things. l...

1126
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,640
All right, Jack.

1127
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,960
Oh, this is another friend
from out of town?

1128
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,160
Uh-huh, yeah.
l-l mean...

1129
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,280
What happened to your suit?

1130
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,240
What's going on

1131
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,360
between this guy and me,

1132
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,520
it's -it's -it's kind
of, uh... complex.

1133
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,640
l-l can explain it

1134
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,120
some other time.

1135
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,320
l'll bet.

1136
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,320
Look, we got no more time
for Goldilocks here.

1137
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,440
Where do we find Holli?

1138
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:28,040
Okay, she went
to the Union Plaza.

1139
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,280
-The Spike.
-She went to meet this...

1140
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,240
She went to meet

1141
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,200
this guy, Vegas Vinnie.

1142
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,880
The only problem is,
she took my car, so...

1143
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,880
l've got my mom's car.

1144
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,040
Let's go, miss.

1145
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,600
We're trying
to protect the balance

1146
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,160
of the entire known
universe here.

1147
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,360
Oh, gee, l guess my mom
won't chuck a fit, then,

1148
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,680
if we took it, huh?

1149
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,880
Wow!

1150
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,640
Miss?

1151
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,680
Miss?

1152
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,920
Can l help you, Miss?

1153
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,920
l'm looking for Vegas Vinnie.

1154
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,160
There's no... there's no
Vegas Vinnie here.

1155
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,440
l'm sorry.

1156
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,560
He owns the place.

1157
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,240
l don't ... l...
There's no Vegas Vinnie here.

1158
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,480
l'm sorry.
l-l can't help you.

1159
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,280
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

1160
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,360
No.

1161
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,800
Sorry.

1162
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,800
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

1163
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,800
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

1164
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,760
Vegas Vinnie is a story
based on a real guy--

1165
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,920
this doc l met--

1166
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,040
when l first went across,
uh, 50 years ago.

1167
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,160
Cool World's real?

1168
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,480
Neat!

1169
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,760
He and l,
we mapped out the tunnel,

1170
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,040
the passageway
between both worlds.

1171
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,920
And we saw how easily
one could disrupt that balance

1172
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,400
and destroy both universes.

1173
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,160
Destroy the universe?

1174
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,640
When you have
some money to spend,

1175
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,160
we'd love to see you, honey.

1176
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,960
Until then,
you have to keep out.

1177
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,800
l can't ...

1178
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,920
Oh!

1179
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,680
Uh, pretty-looking sign
we got up there, huh, Miss?

1180
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,240
Yeah, that spike in the center.

1181
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,120
lt's real bright.

1182
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,560
You sound kind of down, Miss.

1183
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,480
Uh, have bad luck
at the tables?

1184
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,360
Let's just say it
ain't been my day.

1185
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,920
Oh, well, don't worry, uh...

1186
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,720
Good Lord!

1187
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,280
l never thought
l'd see it happen!

1188
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,280
Miss, what you looking for,

1189
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,000
you can't find around here.

1190
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,160
You better go.

1191
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,240
How do you know
what l'm lookin' for?

1192
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,400
You do know
what l am, don't you?

1193
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,640
You know where l'm from.

1194
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,200
Oh, my goodness.

1195
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,560
Old man, l'm not leaving
till l find out

1196
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,920
how you know so much. Talk!

1197
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,160
Talk!

1198
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,160
You're not telling me
everything you know.

1199
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,680
Y-Y...

1200
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,520
Y-You...

1201
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,280
Y-Y-You're d-doodle!

1202
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,840
ln Cool World,
they knew me as "Whiskers."

1203
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,400
Dr. Vincent Whiskers.

1204
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,560
Didn't you touch the Spike?

1205
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,960
Sure, l touched it,
but l couldn't hold it.

1206
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,040
No one can!

1207
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,560
So it is up there!

1208
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,880
And it is real,

1209
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,240
and it's going to make me real.

1210
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,680
Sure, it's up there,

1211
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,480
but it's not going
to do you any good.

1212
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,120
Just because you weren't
man enough to hold onto it.

1213
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,720
l need the force
in that Spike.

1214
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,640
And l'm going up there.

1215
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,080
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

1216
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,400
That power doesn't belong
to you!

1217
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,600
l don't care.
l want it.

1218
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,960
And l don't care...

1219
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,720
Stop!

1220
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,600
Cease! Desist!

1221
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,600
l mean it!

1222
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,760
-Ow, ow!
-Make this easy on yourself.

1223
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,840
There she is.

1224
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,440
She looks pretty.

1225
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,120
Come on,
you little troublemaker.

1226
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,080
Nobody's going to stop me now.

1227
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,920
Harris, help me.

1228
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,200
You've got to stop that girl.

1229
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,240
lf she moves it,
it could be the end

1230
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:37,000
of everything.

1231
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,520
Doc? Oh, my God.

1232
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,720
-l gotta get...
-Wait, wait.

1233
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:40,760
Jack, please, l need you here

1234
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,080
to take care
of my friend. Please.

1235
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,040
This is my department.

1236
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,000
l gotta stop her, Harris.

1237
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,080
-Jack!
-Let go!

1238
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,800
Wait, Jack!

1239
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:50,760
Let me go, Harris.

1240
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,360
l'm not gonna hurt her.

1241
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,560
Help him.

1242
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,560
Holli.

1243
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,760
Crazy doodle bitch.

1244
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,240
All right.

1245
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,400
Hello, Holli.

1246
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,160
Guess what. You're through.

1247
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,320
You know, sweetheart,

1248
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,680
you look good in the flesh.

1249
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,680
lt's almost a shame
l gotta take you back.

1250
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,640
You are going back, you know.

1251
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,200
Would!

1252
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,920
Um...

1253
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,680
You're squeezing my head.

1254
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:03,880
There.

1255
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,200
As good as new.

1256
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,200
Where do you think you're going?

1257
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,480
lt's over.

1258
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,960
What are you gonna do-- jump?

1259
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,920
Just get down.

1260
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,240
For Christ's sake.

1261
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,600
What? You got ink
for brains? Get down.

1262
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,080
Don't piss me off, Would.

1263
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,760
You go on that roof,

1264
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,800
you screw us all.

1265
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,520
l'm not messing around here.

1266
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:30,760
Oh, Christ.

1267
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,120
There's nothing up there.

1268
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,240
Let's just go home,

1269
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,200
fix this mess.

1270
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,120
Get down!

1271
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,680
Would!

1272
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,160
Don't .

1273
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,120
Harris.

1274
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,200
What?!

1275
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,800
Harris, help me.

1276
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:52,800
Ah...

1277
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,880
Help me.

1278
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,120
Oh, Harris... help me.

1279
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,160
Hold on.

1280
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,720
l should do the world a favor
and let you fall.

1281
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,320
Easy.

1282
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,360
Easy does it.

1283
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,320
Good.

1284
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,840
Now, hold on.

1285
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,080
Here we go.

1286
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,360
Here we go.

1287
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,080
We're going home.

1288
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,680
All right, careful.

1289
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,520
Come on.

1290
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:43,240
Oh, my God.

1291
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,880
Jack, this is your chance
to make it right.

1292
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,360
lt's up to you now.

1293
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,680
Okay. Okay.

1294
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:12,600
This time, l'm gonna
do something right.

1295
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,600
He's gonna kill himself.

1296
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,600
He's fulfilling his destiny.

1297
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,920
He's becoming a hero.

1298
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,280
Oh, please.

1299
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,560
The Spike.

1300
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,200
lt's up to me
to return the Spike.

1301
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,000
Got it!

1302
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:27,960
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

1303
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,120
Whoa.

1304
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:32,360
The pain is unbearable.

1305
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,000
Hit me.

1306
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,640
Deuces wild?

1307
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,760
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

1308
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:09,360
The world has
only one chance left.

1309
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:13,080
lt's up to me to return the
Spike and plug the hole.

1310
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:16,280
Huh! You fiends!

1311
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,400
Trying to stop me.

1312
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,680
Baby, baby...

1313
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,400
The king! Oh, it's the king!

1314
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:08,440
Oh, l hate being
bottled up like that.

1315
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,720
Oh, man, boss.

1316
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,040
Hold on. Hold on.

1317
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:34,640
Hmm?

1318
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,360
Feel the air, Jack.

1319
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,760
We're staying.

1320
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,920
l like it here, Jack.

1321
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,080
Come here.

1322
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,560
Give me the Spike, Jack.

1323
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,440
You love me, don't you, Jack?

1324
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,320
Yes, l do.

1325
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,440
Well, then, help me.

1326
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,520
Give it to me, Jack.

1327
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,880
Okay, honey-poo.

1328
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,600
Hey, goodie-goodie-goodie.

1329
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,360
Pencil dicks.

1330
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,320
Aha!

1331
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,440
A trick!

1332
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,640
On second thought,
l must do what is right

1333
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,720
and return the Spike.

1334
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:32,920
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1335
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,880
Whoa!

1336
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,320
Oh, golly, oh!

1337
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,200
Hey!

1338
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,800
Damn!

1339
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,400
Jack?!

1340
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,200
He-he's gone.

1341
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:31,160
He's ...

1342
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:33,680
He's gone.

1343
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:34,920
Dead?

1344
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:39,080
l don't know for sure,
but l don't think so.

1345
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,040
You know,

1346
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,680
maybe the Spike protected them.

1347
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,080
lts power is beyond

1348
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,080
our understanding.

1349
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,040
Mm-hmm.

1350
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,960
l'm sorry he didn't make it.

1351
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,800
l got to take him
back with me.

1352
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,400
There's a nice gal back there.

1353
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:05,720
She deserves to see him,
dead or alive.

1354
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,600
Okay, Doc, let 'er rip.

1355
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,440
Wow.

1356
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,080
Arriba, arriba, arriba, arriba!

1357
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,720
Oh!

1358
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,720
Oh, Nails!

1359
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:07,960
He didn't make it.

1360
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,760
l'm sorry.

1361
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:12,320
Oh, Frank, honey! No, please!

1362
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:15,520
Oh, no, please,
you can't leave me!

1363
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:18,640
Oh, no!

1364
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:20,720
Who killed him, Nails?

1365
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,040
He was pushed off a building.

1366
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:24,000
Who pushed him?

1367
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,000
Holli Would.

1368
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:28,000
Holli Would?

1369
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,280
That bitch!

1370
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,720
Nails,

1371
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:38,000
was she a doodle
when she aced him?

1372
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,000
Yeah! So what?!

1373
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,480
So what?

1374
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,200
Oh! So what?

1375
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,240
Well, what happens
to noids who traffic

1376
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,600
in the Cool World, Nails,

1377
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,360
when they get killed
by a doodle?

1378
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:51,120
They become a doodle themselves.

1379
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:52,880
Hmm?

1380
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,320
Hot dog! Dig it! Dig me!

1381
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,240
Ba-ba-bum...

1382
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,200
ba!

1383
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,280
Oh, my God!

1384
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,080
Oh, Nails, he's alive!

1385
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,120
Ooh, and he's gorgeous, too.

1386
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,840
Hubba-bubba, baby.

1387
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:10,840
What do you think?

1388
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,560
Ooh, you're a hero, Harris.

1389
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,040
You saved the world.

1390
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,400
So what are you waiting for?

1391
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:16,400
Come and get it.

1392
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,640
Ooh, Frankie...

1393
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,840
so, did you do it
while you were back there

1394
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:26,880
in the real world?

1395
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,480
Did you do it
while you were real?

1396
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:33,520
Do you ever think about
going back there so you can?

1397
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:36,320
There's no reason now.

1398
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,520
Hey, boss, we got to go.

1399
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,440
Get out of here!

1400
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:46,000
l'm sorry.

1401
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:47,640
l'm so sorry.

1402
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,160
l can't stand myself.

1403
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,080
Oh! l should have
all eight legs.

1404
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,560
Well, then,

1405
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:58,840
we're just going
to have to stop pretending now,

1406
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,200
aren't we?

1407
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,160
Bum, bum, ba.

1408
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,080
Bye-bye, folks.

1409
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,920
Have a nice life.

1410
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,120
What a beautiful landscape.

1411
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,080
Let's see.

1412
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,800
We can put the house
over here,

1413
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:19,760
the studio over here.

1414
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,040
l'll still draw, of course.

1415
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:23,960
We'll raise children over here,
l'll fight crime over there.

1416
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,360
Oh, we're going to be
deliriously happy, honey-poo.

1417
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,280
Pencil dick.

1418
01:33:50,000 --> 01:34:10,053
