63
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,740

Machine gun, right flank!

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,140
Medic!

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,020
That's when you saw them, huh?

71
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,940
Well, it works.

72
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,980
My Spike works.

73
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,420
Okay. Okay.

74
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,380
Easy, easy.

75
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,500
Okay.

76
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,660
-Take it easy.
-Take it easy.

77
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,900
No!

78
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,740
l've got a headache.

79
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,140
Have you got some Wite-Out?

80
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,020
Ma!

81
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,020
Ma!

82
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,780
You don't know

83
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,700
what it is you
got yourself into, bud,

84
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,820
but you're a long way from home.

85
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,060
Oh, but it's so confusing.

86
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,020
Where to go,
where to go... yes...

87
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,300
Ma!

88
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,740
Oh, bother.

89
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,780
What the hell are you?

90
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,580
They're doodles.

91
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,900
Cartoons?

92
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,380
Don't get too close, Doc.

93
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,700
l can't believe what l've done.

94
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,940
My Spike was supposed
to send me to your world,

95
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,100
but instead you're here.

96
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,100
This man's not dangerous
to anyone.

97
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,940
As for us, son, we may not
be real to you as yet...

98
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,900
...but we will be.

99
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,340
You've come
to a whole new world.

100
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,980
You've done something
extremely rare.

101
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,700
You see,
you're in a real place

102
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,660
called the Cool World.

103
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,700
Hmm.

104
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,900
Oh. How strange.

105
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,340
Say " ah."

106
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,180
Ah.

107
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,700
But when it comes to making
the trip in the body...

108
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,380
Did you hear about the wolf

109
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,820
that built the studio?

110
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,780
-No, not...
-...l've never seen it before.

111
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,900
Oh!

112
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,500
Oh, my goodness.

113
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,620
l'm sorry about your mother.

114
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,580
You're cartoons.

115
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,020
You're not real.

116
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,940
Oh-ho, we're real, all right.

117
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,300
The possibility
of interworld travel

118
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,820
has been an obsession of mine
for many, many years.

119
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,940
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

120
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,580
Hey, Doc, wait.

121
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,620
This man is not for you.

122
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,780
He's not a police problem.

123
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,900
He's a mystery of science.

124
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,380
And a hero to boot.

125
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,660
l ain't no hero.

126
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,540
Oh, don't be so sure, friend.

127
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,740
With this hole l've opened,

128
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,860
there could be all kinds
of problems. Ha-ha.

129
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,740
They call me Doc Whiskers.

130
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,220
What's your name, son?

131
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,700
l'm Frank Harris.

132
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,380
What did you do
in your world?

133
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,740
l was a soldier.

134
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,380
Oh, you could be useful
here when l'm gone.

135
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,740
Where are you from?

136
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,820
Um, Vegas.

137
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,020
Tomorrow we're out of here.

138
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,780
You're just a drawing, Holli,

139
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,500
but without you,
l'd never have made it.

140
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,900
Oh, you look good tonight, babe.

141
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,060
lt's time you came to me, Jack.

142
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,660
Come to me.

143
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,580
Ooh, baby!

144
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,820
-Hey-ya, hey-ya.
-Hey-ya, hey-ya.

145
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,980
l've been waiting for you,
darlin'

146
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,500
-Huh?
-Hmm?

147
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,940
Uh, Sparky,
uh, whatcha up to, huh?

148
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,500
What makes you think

149
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,820
l'd tell a little punk like you?

150
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,380
Why, he's going soft
for that tomato.

151
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,140
Uh... w-w-what's her name?

152
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,740
H-H-Holli or something. Yeah.

153
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,140
Enough out of you, kitty.

154
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,700
You're too young
to be thinking about girls.

155
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,900
Especially that girl.

156
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,700
Here.

157
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,820
A bunch of wooden nickels.

158
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,380
Don't spend them all
in one place.

159
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,700
W-W-What?

160
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,300
Philip flew the coop
last night.

161
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,460
Hey, Molina! Hey, Molina!

162
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,380
Come over here.

163
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,060
Did you step in it?

164
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,500
Hey, there's
a flower on your head.

165
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,620
There's are lots of...

166
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,740
Hey.

167
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,740
Look out!

168
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,100
l hate it when she meets guys
without tellin' me.

169
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,100
l light up like

170
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,100
Neon

171
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,780
Just a tiny section of your
affection in my direction

172
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,180
Will do

173
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,660
Ooh.

174
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,460
-Detective Harris.

175
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,380
What a pleasure.

176
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,380
l was just rehearsing.

177
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,780
Hello, Holli.

178
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,140
This is an exact replica
of the dress Marilyn Monroe wore

179
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,380
in Let's Make Love.

180
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,300
Oh!

181
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,460
l know that movie by heart.

182
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,620
The girl gets get everything
by the end of it.

183
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,300
Everything she ever wanted.

184
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,540
lt's real.

185
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,620
l mean it.

186
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,780
l even saw
a copyright date on it.

187
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,220
Rumor has it, Holli,

188
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,380
that you had a noid visitation

189
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
at the Slash Club last night.

190
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,940
lt was just a mind slip.

191
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,980
Nothin' special.

192
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,780
You're just a regular
true believer

193
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,580
in law and order, huh?

194
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,220
Give me a couple, Jack.

195
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,340
Come on, let's go.

196
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,820
Beat it, copper.

197
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,780
Yeah.

198
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,660
-Go on, beat it.
-Beat it...

199
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,740
Just doing my job.

200
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,900
-Come on let's go.
-Come on.

201
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,860
Hey, Frank?

202
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,700
Don't go just yet.

203
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,140
Come here.

204
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,780
l got somethin' to show you.

205
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,780
Guess what?

206
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,100
l've seen your little
museum of Vegas.

207
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,260
And don't start in
with your Vegas Vinnie rap.

208
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,340
l've heard it.
lt bores me.

209
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,140
Vegas Vinnie made the Spike--

210
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,820
crossed over and became the
owner of the Union Plaza Hotel.

211
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,140
Vegas Vinnie
is a fairy tale, Would.

212
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,180
Doodle moms tell it to doodle
kids to help them go to sleep.

213
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,180
lt could all be true.

214
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,660
You got over here.

215
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,340
So why couldn't he make it
over there?

216
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,940
Or for that matter,
why couldn't l?

217
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,020
You could help me.

218
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,500
There'll be no crossovers
while l'm around.

219
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,260
l've got news for you, pal.

220
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,860
l am not your ordinary doodle.

221
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,060
l've been checking up

222
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,780
on what these noid dames
have got going

223
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,660
in the real world,
and l want it!

224
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,660
Don't you see?

225
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,300
They're real.

226
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,100
They've got power.

227
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,980
When they touch something,
they feel it.

228
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,340
And when
they taste something...

229
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,220
...they really taste it.

230
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,020
And when they do it
with a man...

231
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,900
...they really do it.

232
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,460
Ooh...

233
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,540
What can l say, sweetheart?

234
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,140
l can't help you out
in that department.

235
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,220
Well, don't you see?

236
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,020
Believe it.

237
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,140
l've had enough.

238
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,020
Oh, yeah? Fine.

239
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,380
You don't want to help me?

240
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,220
Then l'll find somebody else
that will.

241
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,100
Like that noid cartoonist,
Jack Deebs.

242
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,540
He's been around a lot lately.

243
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,700
Yes, he has.

244
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,940
The whack-a-do who thinks
he invented this place.

245
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,140
What do you think l've been
talking about, Holli?

246
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,220
Well, l'd watch it, honey,

247
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,780
'cause there might be
two of you before long.

248
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,220
l'm going to tell you this once

249
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,900
'cause you got to be
smarter than you look.

250
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,340
You're dealing with shit here
that's way over your head.

251
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,300
Yeah...

252
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,460
Now, keep your legs crossed

253
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,860
and forget about the real world.

254
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,820
Hmm!

255
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,380
Thank you for your time.

256
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,620
Would you look at those legs!

257
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,820
Doh!

258
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,780
Hey...!

259
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,540
Yeah.

260
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,060
Stay cool, man.

261
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,820
l'm out of here.

262
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,460
Hey, Bobby, let's go.

263
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,100
Hey.

265
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,620
What are you guys doing?

266
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,580
Get off the lawn.

267
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,220
-Shut up.
-What?

268
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,780
Get your ball
and get out of here.

269
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,660
No!

270
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,220
Hi, Gail, it's me, Jennifer.

271
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,060
What do you mean?
l'm here.

272
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,260
Yeah, l'll call you
later tonight, okay?

273
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,460
Thank you.

274
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,580
Oh, boy. Another addict, huh?

275
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,300
Uh-huh.

276
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,180
My God, it's you, isn't it?

277
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,380
You're Jack Deebs, the creator
of Cool World, right?

278
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,340
Mm-hmm.

279
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,300
Oh, my God.

280
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,420
l can't believe this.

281
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,540
Do you have any idea

282
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,860
what kind of an inspiration
your work is to people?

283
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,060
No, l, uh...

284
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,820
l mean, l know people--
friends of mine who want to be

285
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,540
Holli Would
when they grow up.

286
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,540
-Really?
-Yeah.

287
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,460
Sparks, the goons, all of them.

288
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,060
Oh, man.

289
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,980
Your stuff, it's like crucial

290
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,980
spiritual nourishment
for people.

291
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,940
They live on it.

292
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,940
Oh, man.

293
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,940
lf my boss was here,

294
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,020
he'd , like, throw himself
on the ground right now

295
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,780
and give you a lifetime
gift certificate

296
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,740
-to this place.
-Really?

297
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,700
Oh, yeah.

298
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,300
He's kind of crazy.

299
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,100
Hey, would you sign this
for him?

300
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,580
Thank you.

301
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,860
Thanks. Oh, go ahead.

302
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,620
Cool, Mike.

303
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,660
So, um...

Yeah?

307
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,260
Well, um, when
this place closes down,

308
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,420
l go down to this place
right off the strip for coffee.

309
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,740
They, uh, read poetry,

310
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,420
do jazz, you know.

311
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,100
Problem is, you know,

314
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,940

315
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,100
Uh... but it's really
nice of you to ask.

316
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,620
-Sure.
-Thank you.

317
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,860
Hey, Deebs,

318
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,180
why don't you do a book
on that guy you murdered?

319
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,580
You know, that guy

320
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,180

321

Oh, okay. Thanks.

Thanks.

326
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,660

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,980
-Nice meeting you, Jack.
-Nice to meet you.

He loves me, he loves me not.

He loves me...

377
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,660
He loves me.

378

Now, be nice.

379
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,420
Nice.

Nice.

381

Nice.

382
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,580
Ooh, hello, Holli.

383
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,700
Ooh, you never cease
to amaze me.

384
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,540
How fabulous your hair

385
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,580
looks today.

386
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,060
Boy...

387
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,460
can she knock it back.

388
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,380
Hey, hey, how about
saving some for me?

389
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,780
Please!

390
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,780
Hey, come on, come on!

391
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,860
Holli wants to get
a look at you. Come on.

392
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,940
Oh, yeah.

393
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,220
Oh, that's a nice little boy.

394
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,180
Come, darling, she awaits.

395
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,340
A little closer.

396
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,220
Let her see you.
Ah, yeah.

397
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,060
Welcome to my world...
big man.

398
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,180
Am l...

399
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,020
Am l dreaming?

400
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,860
Am l dreaming you?

401
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,660
Or are you dreaming me?

402
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,180
l drew you.

403
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,420
l made you.

404
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,100
Hey, l...

405
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,340
maybe l can erase you.

406
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,060
You wouldn't erase me, baby.

407
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,180
You're too hungry
for what l got.

408
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,740
No, l'm , uh...

409
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,940
l'm trying to quit.

410
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,860
Since it's only a dream,

411
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,780
indulge your
fantasies, Jack.

412
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,140
You're so real, so strong.

413
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,900
You could help comb my hair,
tickle my mind, and...

414
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,980
Yes, l have failed.

415
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,060
Thank you.

416
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,620
l'm calm now.

417
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,380
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo!

418
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,260
Filthy bad guys
didn't play fair.

419
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,180
l want you to tear and rip
their miserable faces inside out

420
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,140
till their mother
doesn't recognize them.

421
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,300
Pretty please?

422
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,660
Let's go, guys.
Come on.

423
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,980
Wait for me!

424
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,580
l got news for you, baby.

425
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,380
l'm made of ink...

426
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,620
but l'm no dream.

427
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,100
Ah!

428
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,740
What'd you do that for?

429
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,260
Because l dig you.

430
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,420
This is a long dream.

431
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,660
lsn't it, Jack?

432
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,740
The poppers.

433
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,100
Let's burn.

434
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,340
What?

435
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,620
Let's go.
Come on.

436
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,260
Come on.

437
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,940
To the left.

438
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,460
Do you like it, Deebs?

439
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,820
Yeah.

440
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,260
Course you do.

441
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,140
This is your idea
of heaven, right?

442
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,020
Yeah, it's , uh...

443
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,220
it's amazing, it's incredible.

444
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,300
But l won.

445
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,580
Little late for a lady

446
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,620
to be out on the streets,
don't you think?

447
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,300
l got a couple of questions
for you, miss.

448
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,940
Aw, come on, Officer.
Let it slide, would ya?

449
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,420
l'm tired.

450
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,180
Word is, you got
a thing for noids.

451
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,580
Yeah, l got a thing
for noids.

452
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,940
But what's it to you,

453
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,660
tough guy?

454
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,660
Baby, baby, you don't
know how tough it is.

455
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,780
You're late.

456
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,940
Aw, you're killing me.

457
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,260
Why are you so beautiful?

458
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,420
Mm-mm-mm.

459
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,220
What's wrong?
You don't look right.

460
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,500
Aw, it's Holli.

461
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,660
l think she's in heat again.

462
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,260
With that noid from last night?

463
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,540
Oh, don't worry about it.

464
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,500
You know that. Wh-Why you always
want to bust...?

465
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,620
Gotcha.

466
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,300
All right.
Where you wanna go?

467
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,420
Uh, movies?
Uh, dinner...?

468
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,820
We have abused the privilege...

469
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,140
Our color is fading.

470
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,820
Repent, repent, all toons.

471
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,780
Listen to me.
The end is near.

472
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,100
Hey, Boss, we gotta go. We...

473
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,620
A thousand pardons.

474
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,340
An informer told me
he's here again.

475
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,500
Holli and the goons got him.

476
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,580
He's not just coming
through on a dream.

477
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,020
Perhaps it is time
to pursue other avenues.

478
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,300
Right, let's hit the bricks.

479
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,460
Yeah, yeah, l know.

480
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,100
Be careful, Frank.

481
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,900
Oh, l think she's partial
to you.

482
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,580
Yeah, but facts is facts.

483
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,820
She's a doodle, and l'm not.

484
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,900
Eh, l guess,

485
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,980
but did l ever tell you
about the time

486
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,780
l took up with the most
delightfully-stacked hussy

487
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,780
from the projects?

488
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,020
Yeah.

489
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,020
Right. Where to, Boss?

490
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,220
The club.

491
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
All right.

492
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,580
Aye, aye, aye!

493
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,500
Hey, Baby, how you doing?

494
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,460
Chico?

495
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,340
Chico, is that you?

496
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,300
l ain't no Chico, runt.

497
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,540
And no noids.

498
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,700
He's with me.

499
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,620
Sorry, baby.
No noids.

500
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,180
He is with me, too.

501
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,940
Can't let the neighbors
push us around, can we?

502
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,460
Freeze, asshole.

503
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,420
Uh-oh!

504
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,340
Cool World Police.

505
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,420
Ooh!

506
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,380
Copper!

507
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,420
Up against the wall.

508
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,940
Get your hands off me.

509
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,100
Where are your manners, Harris?

510
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,100
You, be quiet.

511
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,660
Hey, who are you?

512
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,780
Who are you?
l didn't create you.

513
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,660
No shit, Sherlock.

514
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,860
What'd you do with this, Deebs?

515
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,820
l'm a cartoonist.
l drew all this.

516
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,020
l have visions, l...

517
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,140
l have visions.
l translate this.

518
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,220
You do nothing, man.

519
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,300
This place exists
with or without you.

520
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,180
You believe me, right?
l'm not one of your creations.

521
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,460
Don't believe him!

522
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,060
No, you're not pretty enough.

523
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,420
Good one.

524
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,740
Have a seat.

525
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,820
Ordinary fountain pen, right?

526
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,820
Yeah.

527
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,260
Wrong. Around here...

528
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,700
Sit down!

529
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,580
Around here, this
can be a big nuisance.

530
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,540
You thirsty, Nails?

531
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,260
Whoa!

532
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,700
Get it?

533
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,820
One should be careful
how they wave this thing.

534
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,260
No, l don't get it.

535
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,540
Of course
you don't get it,

536
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,740
because you're a wackadoo.

537
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,980
But here you are, Jack.

538
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,900
And around here,
everything goes.

539
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,860
Everything
except one thing!

540
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,580
-Yeah, what?
-Yeah, yeah,

541
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,820
we know.

542
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,140
What's that?

543
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,460
noids do not have sex
with doodles.

544
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,620
Right? noids do not
have sex with doodles!

545
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,180
lt's the oldest law
in Cool World.

546
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,380
l've never had to enforce it,

547
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,620
but you cross that line,

548
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,460
and l'll slap you around,
make you piss like a puppy.

549
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,460
Jack...

550
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,420
you think she's got a thing
for you, don't you?

551
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,020
That's sweet.

552
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,500
But don't flatter
yourself.

553
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,660
She's a waste of ink.

554
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,660
Oh, yeah?

555
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,300
The truth is,
she's been after me

556
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,460
and every other noid
who's come through here.

557
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,540
lt's just that no one's
been insane enough

558
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,020
to get involved with her.

559
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,260
You keep your pencil
in your pocket.

560
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,740
You know what l mean?

561
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,780
Yeah.

562
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,340
l'll remember that, Officer.

563
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,820
You can go now.

564
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,860
Where did you get your
hair done, by the way?

565
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,300
Get out of here.

566
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,380
All right, the show's over!

567
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,420
So, Harris,
you could have beat him.

568
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,900
You could have beat him.

569
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,820
You could of been somebody.

570
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,180
Oh, you're not yellow,
are you, Harris?

571
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,740
You did well, Jack.

572
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,980
Hey, sexy.

573
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,380
Mmm. lt's the man
with the badge.

574
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,860
ln the flesh.

575
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,460
Don't remind me.

576
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,460
Oh-ho-ho.

577
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,220
How can l help it?

578
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,140
-Ah.
-Mmm.

579
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,940
What are you doing to me?

580
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,940
You're messing me up.

581
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,860
Oh, honey, you're tense.

582
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,620
lt's Holli again, isn't it?

583
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,060
Yeah, Miss Holli
Would if she could.

584
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,300
That dame...

585
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,540
You heard anything?

586
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:23,260
Now, you know l don't listen
to that sleazy cow.

587
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,860
Mmm!

588
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,340
Mmm!

589
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,340
Don't . Just don't .

590
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,740
Well, why?

591
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,460
Because we can never finish it,
Lonette, you know?

592
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,540
lt-it-it's frustrating.

593
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,980
l'm , uh...

594
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,860
l'm like a... l'm like a plug
without a socket, you know?

595
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,140
Hey, Frank?

596
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,940
Hey, what?

597
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,420
Did you ever do it
in the Real World?

598
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:00,260
Do you ever think about
going back there so you can?

599
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,700
No.

600
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,180
No way.

601
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,700
Maybe you and me?

602
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,660
l can't have that
in the Real World.

603
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,340
Uh-uh. l can't live without you.

604
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,140
But l can't be with you,
you know?

605
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,620
lt's , jus... agh!

606
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,820
What do you do, huh?

607
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,980
What do you do?

608
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,060
Well, then...

609
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,900
we're just going to have
to pretend then, aren't we?

610
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,820
Hey, Boss!

611
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,620
Ooh!

612
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,020
Boss!

613
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,460
l heard you, Nails.

614
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,460
Oh, my God, Boss!

615
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,860
l wouldn't do it!

616
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,020
Oh! Whew!

617
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,500
Hey, Boss, did l ever
tell you about...?

618
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,300
Shut up, Nails.

619
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,900
Jack.

620
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,100
Jack.

621
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,660
Come home, baby.

622
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:41,500
No... no... no...

623
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,380
No. No! No! No! No!

624
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,020
Glad you dropped in.

625
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,340
Well, here we are--
Holli's humble abode.

626
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,340
Do you think she'll let us in?

627
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,060
Forget it!

628
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,980
This party
is by invitation only.

629
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,060
This door has got an attitude.

630
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,780
How much further?

631
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,980
Oh, uh... l'd say
we're halfway up.

632
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,900
Or halfway down.

633
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,900
Right.

634
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,660
God, l hate heights.

635
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,100
Nails, this is no time
to catch a cold.

636
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,860
lt is not a cold, Boss.

637
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,740
l am allergic to clouds.

638
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,180
What?!

639
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,180
Ah... ah... ah...

640
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,060
Oh... oh...

641
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,260
Choo!

642
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,340
Pull this?

643
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,700
Ah... ah...

644
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,540
Don't even think about it.

645
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,940
Ah...

646
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,980
choo!

647
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,860
That step's smashingly good!
Smashingly!

648
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,300
Yeah.

649
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,780
Make sure no one
gets out this door.

650
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,420
Oh! Oh! Absolutemont,
Boss.

651
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,620
Oh!

652
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,500
Stretcher bearers!

653
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,980
Stretcher bearers!

654
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,820
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

655
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,460
Well, hello, Harris.

656
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,140
Welcome to the party.

657
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,540
And what a swell party it is.

658
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,140
Thanks for having me.

659
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,420
l should have known
riffraff like yourself

660
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,700
would be involved
in this equation, Sparks.

661
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,300
What equation
is that, Harris?

662
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,580
l've discovered

663
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,860
that if you look for trouble,

664
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,300
you find it.

665
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,780
What's your problem?

666
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,100
Bad childhood.

667
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,100
Where's the noid?

668
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,980
You're the only noid here,
Harris.

669
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,940
Ooh!

670
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,660
Last warning.

671
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,780
You stay away from the noid,

672
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,060
or you're closed
for business permanently.

673
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,180
Have a splendid evening.

674
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,580
You want to know
what it is about you

675
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,380
that really kicks my ass,
Harris?

676
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,980
How about my foot?

677
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,420
Well, you prance around here

678
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,820
waving that gun around
like you're some big deal.

679
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,780
And all this time,
you could cross over

680
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,260
to the Real World,

681
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,900
but you haven't got the guts.

682
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,220
You don't have what
it takes to be real.

683
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,140
That makes you
a wimp in my book.

684
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,260
You may be right, Slick.

685
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,180
Be content with the cards
you've been dealt.

686
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,180
Oh!

687
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,940
What's the deal?

688
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,540
lt's getting serious, Nails.

689
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,140
Holli.

690
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,060
We got to find Jack Deebs.

691
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,380
Right.

692
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,580
Go for it!
Go for it!

693
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,940
Should l get the door for you,
Jack?

694
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,300
Oh, yeah!
Oh, Yeah!

695
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,540
Go for it, Jack!

696
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,940
You better have an appointment!

697
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,460
Go on, Jack.
Go on, Jack.

698
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,260
He does...

699
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,420
but you don't .

700
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,100
But Holli said we could watch.

701
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,260
Watch what?

702
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,660
Go on up.

703
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,900
Go on up.

704
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,500
Go on.

705
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,060
Bring me a souvenir, Jack.

706
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,700
Hey, Jack.

707
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,980
l've been waiting for you.

708
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,500
You like looking at me, Jack,
don't you?

709
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,100
Yow!

710
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,420
Man is in the bedroom.

711
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,460
Run, girls, run!
Oh-ho! Oh-ho!

712
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,460
-Okay...
-What?

713
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,820
You listen to me, uh, Holli.

714
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,140
That cop, uh, Harris, um,

715
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,220
he said we... we...

716
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,620
can't go any further
than this, Holli.

717
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,620
-l'm so hot for you, Jack.
-Yeah.

718
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,220
Are you going
to follow the rules?

719
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,180
No.

720
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:25,500
Or are you going to follow...
your instincts?

721
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,460
Yeah.

722
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,300
Oh, but Holli said
we could watch.

723
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,340
l'll be right back.

724
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,420
Yep! Oh, yeah! Oh! Yeah!

725
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,620
Ooh...

726
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,620
Ooh.

727
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,260
Ah... ah...

728
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,580
Ooh.

729
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,540
Mm-hmm.

730
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,100
We're almost there.

731
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,940
Whoa! Okay...

732
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,180
Whoa... whoa!

733
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,300
Whoa!

734
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,900
Ooh!

735
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,060
Holli!

736
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,900
Holli...

737
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,300
Whoa...

738
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,780
Mm, was it good for you?

739
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,260
lt wasn't what l expected.

740
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,860
Y-You gonna go in there

741
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,660
and-and make it up
to Lonette, boss?

742
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,220
Yeah, why not.

743
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,500
The fact is,
she's the best thing that

744
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,660
ever happened to me.

745
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,860
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

746
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,220
Oh, l could put overtime
in on Deebs' Porsche.

747
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,700
l'm tireless.

748
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,780
Forget it.

749
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,980
The goons can't touch him
in Sweet Place,

750
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,940
and we'd just run ourselves
ragged giving him the shadow.

751
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,540
-Well... what should l do?
-Hmm?

752
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,460
Man the phones,
keep pumping our informants.

753
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,660
Somebody might l.D. him.

754
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,780
And if that happens,

755
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,820
you call me.

756
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,220
You call me here or Lonette's ,

757
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,860
my place, l don't know.

758
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,300
Just don't make a move
without me, you got it?

759
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,660
l got it, boss!

760
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,300
Oh!

761
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,140
Come on, let's go, now!

762
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,580
Hey, Lonette...
where's my drink, babe?

763
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,060
You know, l live to serve you.

764
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,940
l heard you
the first ten times.

765
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,660
Hey, come on, l'm -l'm sorry.

766
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,740
Get a little closer here,
babe, give us a kiss.

767
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,980
Say it, don't spray it.

768
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,180
Go away.

769
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,340
l'm out of here!

770
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,660
Tough night?

771
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,980
The usual.

772
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,140
Yeah.

773
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,940
Why you want to hang
around here, huh?

774
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,420
This place should be erased.

775
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,820
Hey... it's a living.

776
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,340
Even a doodle's got to eat.

777
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,220
Why don't you put that arm
around me.

778
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,260
lt's been kind of a tough day.

779
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,460
Oh...

780
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,860
Ooh!

781
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,900
Yeah?

782
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:25,580
Listen, you sludge hog
excuse for a cop.

783
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,900
Deebs and Holli just made it,

784
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,860
and they're about to make
an unscheduled trip

785
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,060
to the other side.

786
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,380
Ooh... Oh! Doh!

787
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,700
Holli?! Sheesh!

788
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,180
No end of trouble that
a little minx like her can make.

789
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:39,860
Why, she might damage the entire
interworld matrix or something.

790
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,380
l don't give a doodle!

791
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,260
Just bust her ass!

792
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,500
Ooh, better call Frank.
Better call Frank.

793
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,500
Uh, oh,
l just can't take it anymore.

794
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,260
Where's Frank?!

795
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,340
Frank! Frank Harris?
Looking for Frank!

796
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,300
Frank! Frank!

797
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,580
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

798
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,860
Where is he?! Where is he?!

799
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,460
Oh, no!

800
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,700
Frank!

801
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,820
Frank Harris!

802
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,980
Whoo!

803
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,220
Aah, aah, aah! Frank!

804
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,380
Frank! Frank!

805
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,540
Thank God!

806
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,100
Okay.

807
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,340
Yeah, Nails, what is it?

808
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,380
You having a good time,
boss, eh? Heh-heh-heh!

809
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,220
Yeah, l guess l'm
having a good time.

810
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,980
-Are we having a good time?
-Yeah.

811
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,660
Nails, leave us alone.

812
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:52,340
Oh, l just love
your little ears.

813
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,900
Okay, Nails, what's the problem?

814
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,740
Ooh! No trouble.

815
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,820
Nothing l can't handle myself.

816
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,220
l was just checking in
with youse. You know.

817
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,500
Yeah. You sure?

818
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,820
All right. Okay, Nails.

819
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,700
-lt's ... incredible.
-Yeah.

820
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,900
No...

821
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,180
No... no...

822
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,820
Oh...

823
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,340
Wait a minute here!

824
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,900
What am l nervous for? Oh!

825
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,460
l could do this job myself!

826
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,900
Hmm.

827
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,500
Mm... mm.

828
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,340
Mm, mm, mm.

829
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,460
Mm.

830
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,620
Ooh-ooh! Ooh! Aah!

831
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,900
Holli, why do we have
to go back?

832
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:58,540
lt's ... it's so great here.

833
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:03,300
Oh... but, Jack,

836
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:14,100
and together... together
we're gonna be unstoppable.

837
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,380
Oh.

838

You look like

Peace, man.

As you see, there have been
some changes around here.

867
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,300
You are a biomorphic menace.

She was really
a cheap piece of work.

941
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,180
l don't know, l thought

Hey!

What happened, you ink stain?

948
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,940
He had a run-in with a noid,

949
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,780
and then he got inked.

950

952
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,300
Holli is a doodle.

953
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,540
Not anymore.

954
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:40,700
She's made it
with that Deebs asshole.

955
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,100
She's changed.

956
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,420
Now you can buy me more fries,
dick head.

957
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,140
This is gonna be
the biggest shit storm

958
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:02,500
the Cool World has ever seen.

959
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:04,220
Round and round l go

960
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,220
Like a leaf on a tide

961
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:10,860
l should stay away,
but what can l do?

962
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,900
Oh...

963
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,380
Oh. Oh.

964
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:18,300
So many men. Oh...

01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,700
And they're real.

966

Oh, smell.... them.

967
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,460
Holli, Holli...

968
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,860
you're with me, remember?

969
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,780
You know, you can't go
around smelling people.

970
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:27,860
Yeah, Jack.

971
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,500
You sit.

975
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,300
Oh.

976
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:37,420
Anything they have.

977
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,700
You know, they got
95 different things, Holli.

978
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,820
Mm... whoa.

979
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,220
95?

980
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:44,220
Uh-huh.

01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,700
l'll have one of each.

982
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:48,900
Holli, you know, l'm into having
fun and everything,

983
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,820
but you got to slow down,

01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:51,820
okay?

985
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:54,300
What l want to slow down for?

986
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,380
l'm gonna get everything
l ever wanted.

987
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:01,860
You think any of these men
are gonna say no to Holli?

988
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:04,820
Not on your life, pal.

989
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,740
Gentlemen prefer blondes.

990
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,820
Thank you very much,
everybody.

991
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:12,900
Glad you enjoyed that.

992
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,820
Wonderful old standard.

993
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,740
" Let's Make Love."

994
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,420
Hey! She's with me!

995
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,300
No, she's with us.

996
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,260
Hey!

Hit it.

999
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:02,220
Uh, Brian, please.

1000
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:15,700
Here we sit and we chatter

1001
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:19,740
What are we thinking of?

1002
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:23,980
-Let's not make with the patter
-Oh, whoa.

1007
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:41,060
l could coo like a dove

1008
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:45,540
lf you're sold, begin buying

1009
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:48,460
Baby

1010
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,100
Let's make love

1011
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:52,100
Gosh, it's hot

1012
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:56,260
No, don't turn TV on

1013
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:00,460
lnstead just turn me on

1014
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:05,540
l'll light up like neon...

1015
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,980
When your partner gets inked,
you do something about it.

1016
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:11,300
He was your partner,
so you do something.

1017
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,260
Well, l'm not buying it.

1018
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,220
Well, how about " a man's got to
do what a man's got to do" ?

1019
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,820
Can't you just think about me

1020
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:18,940
for a minute, Frank?

1021
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,420
l mean, where does this
leave me?

1022
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,380
What are you mad about?

1023
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,380
Oh!

1024
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,460
l'm mad because
you talk about crossing,

1025
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,860
and-and you don't even care...

1026
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,180
l don't care?
how it makes me feel.

1027
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,540
Whoa, whoa.
How do you feel, Lon?

1028
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,820
How do you feel?

1029
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:31,340
Left out.

1030
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:33,180
You think l want
to go back there?

1031
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,860
You think l want to go back?

1032
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,620
Well, why wouldn't you
want to go back?

1033
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,060
That's real to you, isn't it?!

1034
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,820
Let me tell you something
about over there.

1035
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:42,380
lt hurts over there.
lt-lt's lonely over there.

1036
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,220
lt's a war over there.

1037
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,220
They got eight million ways
for you to die, hon,

1038
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:47,740
and all of them are permanent.

1039
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:50,460
This is real for me,
this. With you.

1040
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,700
And if l want to stay
with you, l got to go back.

1041
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,220
Because if Jack Deebs
and Holli Would

1042
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,580
are after what
l think they are,

1043
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,340
there won't be
any here or there.

1044
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:00,460
Understand, Loni?
No more here.

1045
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,980
Just go ahead!

1046
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:02,900
Hey, hey, hey.

1047
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,980
l'm comin' back.

1048
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:46,220
Jack.

1049
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,900
Jack.

1050
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,300
What's going on?

1051
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:50,580
Something's wrong.

1052
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,220
Something's very, very wrong.

1053
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:54,260
No shit, pal.

1054
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,300
So what is it?

1055
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:58,860
l mean, l'm ... l'm up there,
and l was just...

1056
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:02,180
l was moving and shaking
with the best of 'em.

1057
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:04,100
And all of a sudden, l was...

1058
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,580
l-l went doodle again.

1059
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:08,020
l mean...

1060
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:51,300
Look at this, Ma. No hands!

1061
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,900
Oh, Frank, don't do that!

1062
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,700
l wouldn't do that.
Come on!

1063
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,500
No!

1064
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,020
Good luck, Frank.

1065
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,860
Please just let me think.

1066
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,580
Let me think.

1067
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,620
Cool, Jack.

1068
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,620
Really cool.

1069
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,740
l guess you have a tough time

1070
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,260
driving and thinking
at the same time, huh?

1071
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:43,020
Oh!

1072
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,180
The Spike of Power!

1073
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,140
The what?!

1074
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:50,380
The Spike could heal me.

1075
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,660
Ooh, l guess Vinnie put
the Spike

1076
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,660
at the top of the casino.

1077
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,380
You're nuts.

1078
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:59,060
You are nuts.

1079
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,100
Don't say l'm nuts.

1080
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,340
l've had enough ego
out of you, pal.

1081
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,660
And you used to think
you made me up.

1082
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,980
You're thinking
like a doodle, Holli.

1083
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,540
There is no Spike of Power.

1084
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:12,420
There's got to be
a Spike of Power.

1085
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,900
And l'm going to find it
right now.

1086
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,020
No, you're not.

1087
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:17,340
Okay? Yeah.

1088
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,780
We're going there, Jack.

1089
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,180
No, we're not.

1090
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:22,260
You're a nice fellow, Jack.

1091
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,660
Don't piss me off.

1092
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,740
Oh, yeah?

1093
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:26,340
What are you going to do
about it, Holli?

1094
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:28,660
Huh?

1095
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,580
Goddamn it!

1096
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,100
What are you doing here, Harris?

1097
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:10,700
l'm taking you
and the bimbo back.

1098
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,460
What are you going to do?
Shoot me?

1099
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,460
Why don't you shoot me,
goddamn it!?

1100
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,860
Shoot me, Harris.

1101
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,180
Go on, shoot...

1102
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:21,660
Don't push me!
Don't push me!

1103
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:22,900
You just couldn't take

1104
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,820
a piece of good advice,
could you?

1105
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:27,300
No, Jack, you had to listen
to your Johnson.

1106
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:28,540
l've had it with you, Harris.

1107
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:29,900
l've had it with you,
goddamn it!

1108
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,780
You've had it with me?!

1109
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:33,580
You've had it with me,

1110
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,820
you piece of shit?

1111
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:36,140
You screw us all
for a piece of ass,

1112
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:37,100
and you've had it with me?

1113
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,100
Where is she?

1114
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:43,300
Great.

1115
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,940
lt's happening, Jack.

1116
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:50,820
Got news for you, Harris.

1117
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,820
lt's happening to her, too.

1118
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,140
Jack!

1119
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,820
Jack, l saw it this time.

1120
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:02,060
-Jack, l saw it. l swear it.
-Jennifer...

1121
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,020
l saw this thing.
lt ate your house again.

1122
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:03,820
Remember when we came
over earlier?

1123
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:04,460
Jennifer...

1124
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,060
l wasn't imagining things. l...

1125
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,540
All right, Jack.

1126
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,860
Oh, this is another friend
from out of town?

1127
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,060
Uh-huh, yeah.
l-l mean...

1128
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,180
What happened to your suit?

1129
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,140
What's going on

1130
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:14,260
between this guy and me,

1131
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,420
it's -it's -it's kind
of, uh... complex.

1132
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,540
l-l can explain it

1133
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,020
some other time.

1134
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,220
l'll bet.

1135
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,220
Look, we got no more time
for Goldilocks here.

1136
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,340
Where do we find Holli?

1137
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,940
Okay, she went
to the Union Plaza.

1138
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,180
-The Spike.
-She went to meet this...

1139
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,140
She went to meet

1140
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,100
this guy, Vegas Vinnie.

1141
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:31,780
The only problem is,
she took my car, so...

1142
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,780
l've got my mom's car.

1143
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:36,940
Let's go, miss.

1144
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:38,500
We're trying
to protect the balance

1145
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:40,060
of the entire known
universe here.

1146
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,260
Oh, gee, l guess my mom
won't chuck a fit, then,

1147
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,580
if we took it, huh?

1148
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,780
Wow!

1149
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,540
Miss?

1150
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,580
Miss?

1151
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,820
Can l help you, Miss?

1152
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,820
l'm looking for Vegas Vinnie.

1153
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:22,060
There's no... there's no
Vegas Vinnie here.

1154
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,340
l'm sorry.

1155
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:24,460
He owns the place.

1156
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,140
l don't ... l...
There's no Vegas Vinnie here.

1157
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,380
l'm sorry.
l-l can't help you.

1158
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,180
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

1159
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,260
No.

1160
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,700
Sorry.

1161
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,700
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

1162
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:01,700
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

1163
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:09,660
Vegas Vinnie is a story
based on a real guy--

1164
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:11,820
this doc l met--

1165
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:15,940
when l first went across,
uh, 50 years ago.

1166
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,060
Cool World's real?

1167
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,380
Neat!

1168
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,660
He and l,
we mapped out the tunnel,

1169
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,940
the passageway
between both worlds.

1170
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:27,820
And we saw how easily
one could disrupt that balance

1171
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:31,300
and destroy both universes.

1172
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,060
Destroy the universe?

1173
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:43,540
When you have
some money to spend,

1174
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,060
we'd love to see you, honey.

1175
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,860
Until then,
you have to keep out.

1176
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,700
l can't ...

1177
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:55,820
Oh!

1178
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:08,580
Uh, pretty-looking sign
we got up there, huh, Miss?

1179
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:12,140
Yeah, that spike in the center.

1180
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:14,020
lt's real bright.

1181
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:16,460
You sound kind of down, Miss.

1182
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,380
Uh, have bad luck
at the tables?

1183
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,260
Let's just say it
ain't been my day.

1184
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:23,820
Oh, well, don't worry, uh...

1185
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,620
Good Lord!

1186
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:30,180
l never thought
l'd see it happen!

1187
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,180
Miss, what you looking for,

1188
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:33,900
you can't find around here.

1189
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,060
You better go.

1190
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,140
How do you know
what l'm lookin' for?

1191
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:43,300
You do know
what l am, don't you?

1192
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,540
You know where l'm from.

1193
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,100
Oh, my goodness.

1194
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:05,460
Old man, l'm not leaving
till l find out

1195
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,820
how you know so much. Talk!

1196
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,060
Talk!

1197
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,060
You're not telling me
everything you know.

1198
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,580
Y-Y...

1199
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:23,420
Y-You...

1200
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:26,180
Y-Y-You're d-doodle!

1201
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,740
ln Cool World,
they knew me as "Whiskers."

1202
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,300
Dr. Vincent Whiskers.

1203
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:33,460
Didn't you touch the Spike?

1204
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:36,860
Sure, l touched it,
but l couldn't hold it.

1205
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:37,940
No one can!

1206
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,460
So it is up there!

1207
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,780
And it is real,

1208
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:43,140
and it's going to make me real.

1209
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,580
Sure, it's up there,

1210
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,380
but it's not going
to do you any good.

1211
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:54,020
Just because you weren't
man enough to hold onto it.

1212
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,620
l need the force
in that Spike.

1213
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,540
And l'm going up there.

1214
01:15:58,540 --> 01:15:59,980
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

1215
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:04,300
That power doesn't belong
to you!

1216
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,500
l don't care.
l want it.

1217
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:07,860
And l don't care...

1218
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,620
Stop!

1219
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:11,500
Cease! Desist!

1220
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,500
l mean it!

1221
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:14,660
-Ow, ow!
-Make this easy on yourself.

1222
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,740
There she is.

1223
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,340
She looks pretty.

1224
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:22,020
Come on,
you little troublemaker.

1225
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:23,980
Nobody's going to stop me now.

1226
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,820
Harris, help me.

1227
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,100
You've got to stop that girl.

1228
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:32,140
lf she moves it,
it could be the end

1229
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:34,900
of everything.

1230
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,420
Doc? Oh, my God.

1231
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:37,620
-l gotta get...
-Wait, wait.

1232
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:38,660
Jack, please, l need you here

1233
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:39,980
to take care
of my friend. Please.

1234
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:40,940
This is my department.

1235
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:41,900
l gotta stop her, Harris.

1236
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:42,980
-Jack!
-Let go!

1237
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:47,700
Wait, Jack!

1238
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:48,660
Let me go, Harris.

1239
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,260
l'm not gonna hurt her.

1240
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,460
Help him.

1241
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,460
Holli.

1242
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,660
Crazy doodle bitch.

1243
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,140
All right.

1244
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,300
Hello, Holli.

1245
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:09,060
Guess what. You're through.

1246
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:12,220
You know, sweetheart,

1247
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:14,580
you look good in the flesh.

1248
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:16,580
lt's almost a shame
l gotta take you back.

1249
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,540
You are going back, you know.

1250
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:35,100
Would!

1251
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,820
Um...

1252
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:00,580
You're squeezing my head.

1253
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,780
There.

1254
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:03,100
As good as new.

1255
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,100
Where do you think you're going?

1256
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,380
lt's over.

1257
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:12,860
What are you gonna do-- jump?

1258
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:13,820
Just get down.

1259
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,140
For Christ's sake.

1260
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:18,500
What? You got ink
for brains? Get down.

1261
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,980
Don't piss me off, Would.

1262
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:24,660
You go on that roof,

1263
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,700
you screw us all.

1264
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:27,420
l'm not messing around here.

1265
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:28,660
Oh, Christ.

1266
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,020
There's nothing up there.

1267
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,140
Let's just go home,

1268
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:33,100
fix this mess.

1269
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,020
Get down!

1270
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,580
Would!

1271
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,060
Don't .

1272
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,020
Harris.

1273
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:48,100
What?!

1274
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:49,700
Harris, help me.

1275
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:50,700
Ah...

1276
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,780
Help me.

1277
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:06,020
Oh, Harris... help me.

1278
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,060
Hold on.

1279
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,620
l should do the world a favor
and let you fall.

1280
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,220
Easy.

1281
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:15,260
Easy does it.

1282
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,220
Good.

1283
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,740
Now, hold on.

1284
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:19,980
Here we go.

1285
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:21,260
Here we go.

1286
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,980
We're going home.

1287
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,580
All right, careful.

1288
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,420
Come on.

1289
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,140
Oh, my God.

1290
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,780
Jack, this is your chance
to make it right.

1291
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,260
lt's up to you now.

1292
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,580
Okay. Okay.

1293
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:10,500
This time, l'm gonna
do something right.

1294
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,500
He's gonna kill himself.

1295
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:36,500
He's fulfilling his destiny.

1296
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,820
He's becoming a hero.

1297
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,180
Oh, please.

1298
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:18,460
The Spike.

1299
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,100
lt's up to me
to return the Spike.

1300
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:24,900
Got it!

1301
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:25,860
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

1302
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:27,020
Whoa.

1303
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:30,260
The pain is unbearable.

1304
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:38,900
Hit me.

1305
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:41,540
Deuces wild?

1306
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:57,660
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

1307
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:07,260
The world has
only one chance left.

1308
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:10,980
lt's up to me to return the
Spike and plug the hole.

1309
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:14,180
Huh! You fiends!

1310
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:17,300
Trying to stop me.

1311
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:48,580
Baby, baby...

1312
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,300
The king! Oh, it's the king!

1313
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:06,340
Oh, l hate being
bottled up like that.

1314
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:07,620
Oh, man, boss.

1315
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:10,940
Hold on. Hold on.

1316
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:32,540
Hmm?

1317
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:48,260
Feel the air, Jack.

1318
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:49,660
We're staying.

1319
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,820
l like it here, Jack.

1320
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:54,980
Come here.

1321
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,460
Give me the Spike, Jack.

1322
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:01,340
You love me, don't you, Jack?

1323
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:04,220
Yes, l do.

1324
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:09,340
Well, then, help me.

1325
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:11,420
Give it to me, Jack.

1326
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:14,780
Okay, honey-poo.

1327
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:19,500
Hey, goodie-goodie-goodie.

1328
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:21,260
Pencil dicks.

1329
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,220
Aha!

1330
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:23,340
A trick!

1331
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:26,540
On second thought,
l must do what is right

1332
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:28,620
and return the Spike.

1333
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:30,820
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1334
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,780
Whoa!

1335
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:48,220
Oh, golly, oh!

1336
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,100
Hey!

1337
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:16,700
Damn!

1338
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,300
Jack?!

1339
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:28,100
He-he's gone.

1340
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:29,060
He's ...

1341
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:31,580
He's gone.

1342
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:32,820
Dead?

1343
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:36,980
l don't know for sure,
but l don't think so.

1344
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:37,940
You know,

1345
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,580
maybe the Spike protected them.

1346
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:40,980
lts power is beyond

1347
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:41,980
our understanding.

1348
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:43,940
Mm-hmm.

1349
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:52,860
l'm sorry he didn't make it.

1350
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:56,700
l got to take him
back with me.

1351
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,300
There's a nice gal back there.

1352
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:03,620
She deserves to see him,
dead or alive.

1353
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:06,500
Okay, Doc, let 'er rip.

1354
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:12,340
Wow.

1355
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,980
Arriba, arriba, arriba, arriba!

1356
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,620
Oh!

1357
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:00,620
Oh, Nails!

1358
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:05,860
He didn't make it.

1359
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,660
l'm sorry.

1360
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:10,220
Oh, Frank, honey! No, please!

1361
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,420
Oh, no, please,
you can't leave me!

1362
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:16,540
Oh, no!

1363
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:18,620
Who killed him, Nails?

1364
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:20,940
He was pushed off a building.

1365
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:21,900
Who pushed him?

1366
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:23,900
Holli Would.

1367
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:25,900
Holli Would?

1368
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:28,180
That bitch!

1369
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:32,620
Nails,

1370
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:35,900
was she a doodle
when she aced him?

1371
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:37,900
Yeah! So what?!

1372
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,380
So what?

1373
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:41,100
Oh! So what?

1374
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:43,140
Well, what happens
to noids who traffic

1375
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:44,500
in the Cool World, Nails,

1376
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,260
when they get killed
by a doodle?

1377
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,020
They become a doodle themselves.

1378
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,780
Hmm?

1379
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:56,220
Hot dog! Dig it! Dig me!

1380
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:58,140
Ba-ba-bum...

1381
01:31:58,180 --> 01:31:59,100
ba!

1382
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:01,180
Oh, my God!

1383
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:02,980
Oh, Nails, he's alive!

1384
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:06,020
Ooh, and he's gorgeous, too.

1385
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:07,740
Hubba-bubba, baby.

1386
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:08,740
What do you think?

1387
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:10,460
Ooh, you're a hero, Harris.

1388
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,940
You saved the world.

1389
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:13,300
So what are you waiting for?

1390
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:14,300
Come and get it.

1391
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,540
Ooh, Frankie...

1392
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:23,740
so, did you do it
while you were back there

1393
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:24,780
in the real world?

1394
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:28,380
Did you do it
while you were real?

1395
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:31,420
Do you ever think about
going back there so you can?

1396
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:34,220
There's no reason now.

1397
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,420
Hey, boss, we got to go.

1398
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:42,340
Get out of here!

1399
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:43,900
l'm sorry.

1400
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:45,540
l'm so sorry.

1401
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:47,060
l can't stand myself.

1402
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,980
Oh! l should have
all eight legs.

1403
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,460
Well, then,

1404
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:56,740
we're just going
to have to stop pretending now,

1405
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:58,100
aren't we?

1406
01:32:58,140 --> 01:32:59,060
Bum, bum, ba.

1407
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:06,980
Bye-bye, folks.

1408
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:08,820
Have a nice life.

1409
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,020
What a beautiful landscape.

1410
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:14,980
Let's see.

1411
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:16,700
We can put the house
over here,

1412
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:17,660
the studio over here.

1413
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:18,940
l'll still draw, of course.

1414
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:21,860
We'll raise children over here,
l'll fight crime over there.

1415
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,260
Oh, we're going to be
deliriously happy, honey-poo.

1416
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:27,180
Pencil dick.
