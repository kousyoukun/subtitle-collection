00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:27,898
-Well, wait a minute.

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,907
Wait a minute.

Yeah, it's a surprise.

Come on.

10

Shut your eyes.

00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,439
Good. Shut 'em.

00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:39,751
-Okay, you ready?
-Mm-hmm.

-Mm-hmm.

Whoa. Turning.

00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:47,918
Oh, it's cold.

17
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,927
lt's not cold.

18
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,155
Even the chickens are cold.

19
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,424
Okay, steps.
We have steps.

20
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,591
-Ready? One...

Okay, look.

00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,103
-No, that's not it.
-Well...

25
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,105
Shut 'em. Shut 'em.
Come on.

26
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,504
Now, Frank...

27
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,030
h-how far are we gonna go? Ooh.

28
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:05,043
Come on, come on. Come on...

29
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,044
You're all right.

30
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,636
Sweetie, the dinner's

31
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,045
The dinner's fine.

32
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,981
Okay.

33
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,377
Almost, almost...

34
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,579

35
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,609

36
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,953
Oh, it's ...

39
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,259

in a poker game in ltaly.

40
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,597
-Huh?
-Well...

41
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:30,693

42
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,499

00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,474
-Enjoy it...

44
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,739
but be careful.

45
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,407
God, Ma, you're such a mom.

46
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,143
You ready?
We're going for a ride.

47
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,343
Oh, no, no.

48
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:46,510
l have to finish dinner.

49
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,746
Ma, Ma, one ride.

50
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:50,754
Oh. Oh...

51
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,223
Watch this, Ma, no hands.

52
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,950
Oh, Frank, don't do that!

53
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,859
l wouldn't do that.
Come on.

54
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,022
You!

55
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:06,997
l'm in for five.

56
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,973
Thank you, gentlemen.

57
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,600
My pleasure.

58
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:24,145
Hey, girl. Get in here.

59
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,563
Whoa!

60
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,689
-Oh!
-Whoa!

61
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,897
This is fun, right?

62
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:40,906
Maybe.

63
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,874
Yeah.

64
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,739
-Ooh, careful.
-Hey, l'm driving here.

65
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,179
l'm home.

66
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,380
Whoo!

67
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,337
Mortar's coming!
Mortar's coming in!

68
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:25,681
Machine gun, right flank!
Machine gun, right flank!

69
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,726
Medic!

70
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,453
That's when you saw them, huh?

71
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:23,201
Well, it works.

72
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,332
My Spike works.

73
00:07:40,923 --> 00:07:42,447
Okay. Okay.

74
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:43,458
Easy, easy.

75
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:44,618
Okay.

76
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,890
-Take it easy.
-Take it easy.

77
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,157
No!

78
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:54,265
l've got a headache.

79
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:55,736
Have you got some Wite-Out?

80
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:59,766
Ma!

81
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:01,867
Ma!

82
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,708
You don't know

83
00:08:03,746 --> 00:08:05,714
what it is you
got yourself into, bud,

84
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:08,945
but you're a long way from home.

85
00:08:08,984 --> 00:08:11,282
Oh, but it's so confusing.

86
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,345
Where to go,
where to go... yes...

87
00:08:14,423 --> 00:08:15,685
Ma!

88
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:17,214
Oh, bother.

89
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,318
What the hell are you?

90
00:08:21,564 --> 00:08:23,293
They're doodles.

91
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:25,698
Cartoons?

92
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:28,294
Don't get too close, Doc.

93
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:30,737
l can't believe what l've done.

94
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,034
My Spike was supposed
to send me to your world,

95
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:35,305
but instead you're here.

96
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:38,438
This man's not dangerous
to anyone.

97
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,415
As for us, son, we may not
be real to you as yet...

98
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,441
...but we will be.

99
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:45,976
You've come
to a whole new world.

100
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:48,751
You've done something
extremely rare.

101
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:51,588
You see,
you're in a real place

102
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:53,618
called the Cool World.

103
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:55,729
Hmm.

104
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:59,093
Oh. How strange.

105
00:08:59,134 --> 00:09:00,567
Say " ah."

106
00:09:00,603 --> 00:09:02,503
Ah.

107
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:05,132
But when it comes to making
the trip in the body...

108
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:06,869
Did you hear about the wolf

109
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:08,376
that built the studio?

110
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,435
-No, not...
-...l've never seen it before.

111
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:12,638
Oh!

112
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:15,343
Oh, my goodness.

113
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:18,615
l'm sorry about your mother.

114
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:22,715
You're cartoons.

115
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:25,283
You're not real.

116
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:27,261
Oh-ho, we're real, all right.

117
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:29,730
The possibility
of interworld travel

118
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:33,393
has been an obsession of mine
for many, many years.

119
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:34,595
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

120
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:36,298
Hey, Doc, wait.

121
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:38,397
This man is not for you.

122
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,670
He's not a police problem.

123
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:42,870
He's a mystery of science.

124
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,435
And a hero to boot.

125
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,742
l ain't no hero.

126
00:09:45,814 --> 00:09:47,714
Oh, don't be so sure, friend.

127
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,978
With this hole l've opened,

128
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:51,179
there could be all kinds
of problems. Ha-ha.

129
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,154
They call me Doc Whiskers.

130
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:54,678
What's your name, son?

131
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:56,213
l'm Frank Harris.

132
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:57,953
What did you do
in your world?

133
00:09:57,993 --> 00:09:59,392
l was a soldier.

134
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:02,158
Oh, you could be useful
here when l'm gone.

135
00:10:02,197 --> 00:10:03,562
Where are you from?

136
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,691
Um, Vegas.

137
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:33,048
Tomorrow we're out of here.

138
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:36,957
You're just a drawing, Holli,

139
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:39,826
but without you,
l'd never have made it.

140
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,365
Oh, you look good tonight, babe.

141
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,630
lt's time you came to me, Jack.

142
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:50,401
Come to me.

143
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:40,349
Ooh, baby!

144
00:11:50,232 --> 00:11:52,097
-Hey-ya, hey-ya.
-Hey-ya, hey-ya.

145
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:48,579
l've been waiting for you,
darlin'

146
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:11,009
-Huh?
-Hmm?

147
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:13,538
Uh, Sparky,
uh, whatcha up to, huh?

148
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,215
What makes you think

149
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:18,618
l'd tell a little punk like you?

150
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,459
Why, he's going soft
for that tomato.

151
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:27,291
Uh... w-w-what's her name?

152
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:30,025
H-H-Holli or something. Yeah.

153
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:34,600
Enough out of you, kitty.

154
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:38,300
You're too young
to be thinking about girls.

155
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,604
Especially that girl.

156
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:45,614
Here.

157
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:47,809
A bunch of wooden nickels.

158
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,477
Don't spend them all
in one place.

159
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:53,945
W-W-What?

160
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:35,254
Philip flew the coop
last night.

161
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:41,668
Hey, Molina! Hey, Molina!

162
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:43,672
Come over here.

163
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:45,435
Did you step in it?

164
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:50,076
Hey, there's
a flower on your head.

165
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,272
There's are lots of...

166
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:54,471
Hey.

167
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:04,923
Look out!

168
00:15:08,697 --> 00:15:12,565
l hate it when she meets guys
without tellin' me.

169
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:14,660
l light up like

170
00:15:16,305 --> 00:15:17,772
Neon

171
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:22,674
Just a tiny section of your
affection in my direction

172
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:24,144
Will do

173
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,670
Ooh.

174
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,990
-Detective Harris.

175
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:39,995
What a pleasure.

176
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:43,089
l was just rehearsing.

177
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:45,623
Hello, Holli.

178
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:49,126
This is an exact replica
of the dress Marilyn Monroe wore

179
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:50,399
in Let's Make Love.

180
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,407
Oh!

181
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:54,671
l know that movie by heart.

182
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:59,006
The girl gets get everything
by the end of it.

183
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:01,778
Everything she ever wanted.

184
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:06,219
lt's real.

185
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:08,382
l mean it.

186
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:11,689
l even saw
a copyright date on it.

187
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:13,194
Rumor has it, Holli,

188
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:15,424
that you had a noid visitation

189
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,557
at the Slash Club last night.

190
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,194
lt was just a mind slip.

191
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:22,295
Nothin' special.

192
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:26,266
You're just a regular
true believer

193
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:28,173
in law and order, huh?

194
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:30,906
Give me a couple, Jack.

195
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:32,072
Come on, let's go.

196
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:34,641
Beat it, copper.

197
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:35,650
Yeah.

198
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:37,618
-Go on, beat it.
-Beat it...

199
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:38,745
Just doing my job.

200
00:16:38,787 --> 00:16:39,947
-Come on let's go.
-Come on.

201
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:44,084
Hey, Frank?

202
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,991
Don't go just yet.

203
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:47,518
Come here.

204
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:51,297
l got somethin' to show you.

205
00:16:58,574 --> 00:16:59,632
Guess what?

206
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:02,075
l've seen your little
museum of Vegas.

207
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:05,376
And don't start in
with your Vegas Vinnie rap.

208
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:07,541
l've heard it.
lt bores me.

209
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:11,476
Vegas Vinnie made the Spike--

210
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,320
crossed over and became the
owner of the Union Plaza Hotel.

211
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:17,757
Vegas Vinnie
is a fairy tale, Would.

212
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:21,957
Doodle moms tell it to doodle
kids to help them go to sleep.

213
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,127
lt could all be true.

214
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:30,800
You got over here.

215
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:34,640
So why couldn't he make it
over there?

216
00:17:34,677 --> 00:17:37,339
Or for that matter,
why couldn't l?

217
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,642
You could help me.

218
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:53,588
There'll be no crossovers
while l'm around.

219
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:58,531
l've got news for you, pal.

220
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:01,229
l am not your ordinary doodle.

221
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,498
l've been checking up

222
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:04,301
on what these noid dames
have got going

223
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,309
in the real world,
and l want it!

224
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:08,332
Don't you see?

225
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:11,111
They're real.

226
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:15,045
They've got power.

227
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:22,217
When they touch something,
they feel it.

228
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:24,691
And when
they taste something...

229
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,694
...they really taste it.

230
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:31,663
And when they do it
with a man...

231
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:36,737
...they really do it.

232
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:38,364
Ooh...

233
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:41,576
What can l say, sweetheart?

234
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,272
l can't help you out
in that department.

235
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:47,510
Well, don't you see?

236
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:49,380
Believe it.

237
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:51,579
l've had enough.

238
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,554
Oh, yeah? Fine.

239
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:54,988
You don't want to help me?

240
00:18:55,023 --> 00:18:56,888
Then l'll find somebody else
that will.

241
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,955
Like that noid cartoonist,
Jack Deebs.

242
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:03,464
He's been around a lot lately.

243
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:04,693
Yes, he has.

244
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,031
The whack-a-do who thinks
he invented this place.

245
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:09,333
What do you think l've been
talking about, Holli?

246
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:11,496
Well, l'd watch it, honey,

247
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,098
'cause there might be
two of you before long.

248
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:17,737
l'm going to tell you this once

249
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:19,507
'cause you got to be
smarter than you look.

250
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:22,039
You're dealing with shit here
that's way over your head.

251
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:23,051
Yeah...

252
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:24,245
Now, keep your legs crossed

253
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:25,719
and forget about the real world.

254
00:19:25,754 --> 00:19:26,721
Hmm!

255
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:28,347
Thank you for your time.

256
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:42,131
Would you look at those legs!

257
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:45,497
Doh!

258
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:48,565
Hey...!

259
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:02,913
Yeah.

260
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:05,547
Stay cool, man.

261
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,555
l'm out of here.

262
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:16,394
Hey, Bobby, let's go.

263
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:17,628
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:19,135
Hey.

265
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,832
What are you guys doing?

266
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:24,842
Get off the lawn.

267
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:26,571
-Shut up.
-What?

268
00:20:31,082 --> 00:20:32,344
Get your ball
and get out of here.

269
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,317
No!

270
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:39,052
Hi, Gail, it's me, Jennifer.

271
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:44,125
What do you mean?
l'm here.

272
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:46,426
Yeah, l'll call you
later tonight, okay?

273
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,669
Thank you.

274
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:39,940
Oh, boy. Another addict, huh?

275
00:21:39,984 --> 00:21:41,713
Uh-huh.

276
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:46,787
My God, it's you, isn't it?

277
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:49,088
You're Jack Deebs, the creator
of Cool World, right?

278
00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:50,093
Mm-hmm.

279
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:51,094
Oh, my God.

280
00:21:51,128 --> 00:21:52,288
l can't believe this.

281
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,456
Do you have any idea

282
00:21:53,498 --> 00:21:55,864
what kind of an inspiration
your work is to people?

283
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:57,093
No, l, uh...

284
00:21:57,134 --> 00:22:00,001
l mean, l know people--
friends of mine who want to be

285
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:01,800
Holli Would
when they grow up.

286
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,806
-Really?
-Yeah.

287
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,808
Sparks, the goons, all of them.

288
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:06,501
Oh, man.

289
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:08,478
Your stuff, it's like crucial

290
00:22:08,513 --> 00:22:10,572
spiritual nourishment
for people.

291
00:22:10,615 --> 00:22:12,640
They live on it.

292
00:22:12,683 --> 00:22:15,743
Oh, man.

293
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:16,810
lf my boss was here,

294
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:18,981
he'd , like, throw himself
on the ground right now

295
00:22:19,023 --> 00:22:20,786
and give you a lifetime
gift certificate

296
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:21,792
-to this place.
-Really?

297
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:22,793
Oh, yeah.

298
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:24,488
He's kind of crazy.

299
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:27,396
Hey, would you sign this
for him?

300
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,921
Thank you.

301
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:31,298
Thanks. Oh, go ahead.

302
00:22:31,335 --> 00:22:33,132
Cool, Mike.

303
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,298
So, um...

Yeah?

307
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:42,171
Well, um, when
this place closes down,

308
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:45,444
l go down to this place
right off the strip for coffee.

309
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:46,814
They, uh, read poetry,

310
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:48,580

311
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,348
Problem is, you know,

314
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,459

315
00:22:57,495 --> 00:23:00,760
Uh... but it's really
nice of you to ask.

316
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:02,322
-Sure.
-Thank you.

317
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:03,628
Hey, Deebs,

318
00:23:03,668 --> 00:23:06,034
why don't you do a book
on that guy you murdered?

319
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,503
You know, that guy

320
00:23:07,538 --> 00:23:09,165
you found in bed with your wife.

321
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,507

Oh, okay. Thanks.

Thanks.

326
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,147

00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,826
-Nice meeting you, Jack.
-Nice to meet you.

He loves me, he loves me not.

376
00:26:19,893 --> 00:26:22,862
He loves me...

377
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:29,868
He loves me.

378
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:48,151
Now, be nice.

379
00:26:49,523 --> 00:26:50,490
Nice.

00:26:50,524 --> 00:26:52,253
Nice.

381
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:54,487
Nice.

382
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:55,859
Ooh, hello, Holli.

383
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:58,090
Ooh, you never cease
to amaze me.

384
00:26:58,132 --> 00:26:59,997
How fabulous your hair

385
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:01,091
looks today.

386
00:27:01,135 --> 00:27:02,625
Boy...

387
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:04,102
can she knock it back.

388
00:27:04,138 --> 00:27:07,130
Hey, hey, how about
saving some for me?

389
00:27:07,174 --> 00:27:08,573
Please!

390
00:27:18,285 --> 00:27:20,048
Hey, come on, come on!

391
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:23,282
Holli wants to get
a look at you. Come on.

392
00:27:23,323 --> 00:27:24,381
Oh, yeah.

393
00:27:24,424 --> 00:27:25,721
Oh, that's a nice little boy.

394
00:27:30,397 --> 00:27:31,955
Come, darling, she awaits.

395
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:33,159
A little closer.

396
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,100
Let her see you.
Ah, yeah.

397
00:27:38,238 --> 00:27:42,265
Welcome to my world...
big man.

398
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:44,470
Am l...

399
00:27:44,511 --> 00:27:46,376
Am l dreaming?

400
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:48,278
Am l dreaming you?

401
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:53,316
Or are you dreaming me?

402
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:00,083
l drew you.

403
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:01,389
l made you.

404
00:28:01,428 --> 00:28:03,157
Hey, l...

405
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:05,495
maybe l can erase you.

406
00:28:08,035 --> 00:28:10,401
You wouldn't erase me, baby.

407
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:12,598
You're too hungry
for what l got.

408
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,647
No, l'm , uh...

409
00:28:24,685 --> 00:28:26,949
l'm trying to quit.

410
00:28:26,987 --> 00:28:31,048
Since it's only a dream,

411
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:34,083
indulge your
fantasies, Jack.

412
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:37,587
You're so real, so strong.

413
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:40,464
You could help comb my hair,
tickle my mind, and...

414
00:28:45,606 --> 00:28:46,800
Yes, l have failed.

415
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,932
Thank you.

416
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:50,603
l'm calm now.

417
00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:55,574
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo!

418
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:58,585
Filthy bad guys
didn't play fair.

419
00:29:00,888 --> 00:29:03,686
l want you to tear and rip
their miserable faces inside out

420
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:05,749
till their mother
doesn't recognize them.

421
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,058
Pretty please?

422
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:10,461
Let's go, guys.
Come on.

423
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:11,828
Wait for me!

424
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,731
l got news for you, baby.

425
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:27,910
l'm made of ink...

426
00:29:27,948 --> 00:29:30,246
but l'm no dream.

427
00:29:30,284 --> 00:29:31,751
Ah!

428
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:35,551
What'd you do that for?

429
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:37,147
Because l dig you.

430
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,455
This is a long dream.

431
00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:41,722
lsn't it, Jack?

432
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,959
The poppers.

433
00:29:44,998 --> 00:29:46,363
Let's burn.

434
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,662
What?

435
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:48,998
Let's go.
Come on.

436
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:50,697
Come on.

437
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:52,466
To the left.

438
00:30:24,404 --> 00:30:27,430
Do you like it, Deebs?

439
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:28,839
Yeah.

440
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,342
Course you do.

441
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:33,346
This is your idea
of heaven, right?

442
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,280
Yeah, it's , uh...

443
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:37,579
it's amazing, it's incredible.

444
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:38,139
But l won.

445
00:32:00,096 --> 00:32:01,393
Little late for a lady

446
00:32:01,431 --> 00:32:03,490
to be out on the streets,
don't you think?

447
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:08,400
l got a couple of questions
for you, miss.

448
00:32:08,438 --> 00:32:11,134
Aw, come on, Officer.
Let it slide, would ya?

449
00:32:11,174 --> 00:32:12,664
l'm tired.

450
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:15,576
Word is, you got
a thing for noids.

451
00:32:15,612 --> 00:32:18,046
Yeah, l got a thing
for noids.

452
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:19,480
But what's it to you,

453
00:32:19,516 --> 00:32:21,279
tough guy?

454
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,487
Baby, baby, you don't
know how tough it is.

455
00:32:26,523 --> 00:32:27,649
You're late.

456
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:28,851
Aw, you're killing me.

457
00:32:28,892 --> 00:32:30,223
Why are you so beautiful?

458
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,454
Mm-mm-mm.

459
00:32:32,796 --> 00:32:34,354
What's wrong?
You don't look right.

460
00:32:35,432 --> 00:32:36,729
Aw, it's Holli.

461
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:38,996
l think she's in heat again.

462
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:40,662
With that noid from last night?

463
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,001
Oh, don't worry about it.

464
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:44,029
You know that. Wh-Why you always
want to bust...?

465
00:32:45,108 --> 00:32:46,268
Gotcha.

466
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:50,078
All right.
Where you wanna go?

467
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:51,273
Uh, movies?
Uh, dinner...?

468
00:32:51,314 --> 00:32:53,782
We have abused the privilege...

469
00:32:53,817 --> 00:32:55,148
Our color is fading.

470
00:32:55,185 --> 00:32:56,914
Repent, repent, all toons.

471
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:58,921
Listen to me.
The end is near.

472
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:00,320
Hey, Boss, we gotta go. We...

473
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:01,881
A thousand pardons.

474
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:04,723
An informer told me
he's here again.

475
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:06,991
Holli and the goons got him.

476
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,157
He's not just coming
through on a dream.

477
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:12,760
Perhaps it is time
to pursue other avenues.

478
00:33:12,802 --> 00:33:15,134
Right, let's hit the bricks.

479
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:18,402
Yeah, yeah, l know.

480
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:20,136
Be careful, Frank.

481
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:23,043
Oh, l think she's partial
to you.

482
00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:26,882
Yeah, but facts is facts.

483
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:29,213
She's a doodle, and l'm not.

484
00:33:31,855 --> 00:33:33,482
Eh, l guess,

485
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:35,650
but did l ever tell you
about the time

486
00:33:35,692 --> 00:33:38,559
l took up with the most
delightfully-stacked hussy

487
00:33:38,595 --> 00:33:39,619
from the projects?

488
00:33:39,663 --> 00:33:40,891
Yeah.

489
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:42,990
Right. Where to, Boss?

490
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:44,227
The club.

491
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:45,325
All right.

492
00:34:14,564 --> 00:34:15,895
Aye, aye, aye!

493
00:34:30,046 --> 00:34:32,480
Hey, Baby, how you doing?

494
00:34:32,515 --> 00:34:33,504
Chico?

495
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,450
Chico, is that you?

496
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:37,510
l ain't no Chico, runt.

497
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:38,782
And no noids.

498
00:34:38,822 --> 00:34:39,982
He's with me.

499
00:34:40,023 --> 00:34:41,991
Sorry, baby.
No noids.

500
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:43,617
He is with me, too.

501
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,762
Can't let the neighbors
push us around, can we?

502
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:01,641
Freeze, asshole.

503
00:35:01,678 --> 00:35:03,669
Uh-oh!

504
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:05,681
Cool World Police.

505
00:35:05,715 --> 00:35:06,807
Ooh!

506
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,817
Copper!

507
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:09,944
Up against the wall.

508
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:11,544
Get your hands off me.

509
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:13,783
Where are your manners, Harris?

510
00:35:13,823 --> 00:35:15,848
You, be quiet.

511
00:35:15,892 --> 00:35:17,484
Hey, who are you?

512
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:19,722
Who are you?
l didn't create you.

513
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:22,698
No shit, Sherlock.

514
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,031
What'd you do with this, Deebs?

515
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:28,094
l'm a cartoonist.
l drew all this.

516
00:35:28,138 --> 00:35:29,332
l have visions, l...

517
00:35:30,807 --> 00:35:32,604
l have visions.
l translate this.

518
00:35:32,642 --> 00:35:33,734
You do nothing, man.

519
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:35,870
This place exists
with or without you.

520
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:38,881
You believe me, right?
l'm not one of your creations.

521
00:35:38,915 --> 00:35:40,212
Don't believe him!

522
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,877
No, you're not pretty enough.

523
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:43,317
Good one.

524
00:35:43,353 --> 00:35:44,684
Have a seat.

525
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:51,021
Ordinary fountain pen, right?

526
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:52,050
Yeah.

527
00:35:52,095 --> 00:35:53,562
Wrong. Around here...

528
00:35:53,596 --> 00:35:55,063
Sit down!

529
00:35:55,098 --> 00:35:58,067
Around here, this
can be a big nuisance.

530
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:00,126
You thirsty, Nails?

531
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:06,097
Whoa!

532
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:12,814
Get it?

533
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:15,010
One should be careful
how they wave this thing.

534
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:16,518
No, l don't get it.

535
00:36:16,553 --> 00:36:17,850
Of course
you don't get it,

536
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:19,081
because you're a wackadoo.

537
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,481
But here you are, Jack.

538
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:25,520
And around here,
everything goes.

539
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:27,553
Everything
except one thing!

540
00:36:27,597 --> 00:36:29,360
-Yeah, what?
-Yeah, yeah,

541
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:30,661
we know.

542
00:36:32,802 --> 00:36:34,099
What's that?

543
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:36,537
noids do not have sex
with doodles.

544
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:39,838
Right? noids do not
have sex with doodles!

545
00:36:43,246 --> 00:36:45,612
lt's the oldest law
in Cool World.

546
00:36:45,648 --> 00:36:46,876
l've never had to enforce it,

547
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:48,178
but you cross that line,

548
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:52,177
and l'll slap you around,
make you piss like a puppy.

549
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,287
Jack...

550
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:58,385
you think she's got a thing
for you, don't you?

551
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:00,055
That's sweet.

552
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:01,586
But don't flatter
yourself.

553
00:37:01,631 --> 00:37:02,825
She's a waste of ink.

554
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:03,833
Oh, yeah?

555
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:05,560
The truth is,
she's been after me

556
00:37:05,602 --> 00:37:07,832
and every other noid
who's come through here.

557
00:37:07,871 --> 00:37:09,998
lt's just that no one's
been insane enough

558
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,529
to get involved with her.

559
00:37:13,543 --> 00:37:15,943
You keep your pencil
in your pocket.

560
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:17,469
You know what l mean?

561
00:37:20,383 --> 00:37:21,680
Yeah.

562
00:37:21,718 --> 00:37:23,345
l'll remember that, Officer.

563
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:24,853
You can go now.

564
00:37:24,888 --> 00:37:27,015
Where did you get your
hair done, by the way?

565
00:37:27,056 --> 00:37:29,524
Get out of here.

566
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,720
All right, the show's over!

567
00:37:31,761 --> 00:37:33,854
So, Harris,
you could have beat him.

568
00:37:33,897 --> 00:37:35,364
You could have beat him.

569
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:37,366
You could of been somebody.

570
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,834
Oh, you're not yellow,
are you, Harris?

571
00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:43,563
You did well, Jack.

572
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:21,339
Hey, sexy.

573
00:38:21,377 --> 00:38:23,845
Mmm. lt's the man
with the badge.

574
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,370
ln the flesh.

575
00:38:26,382 --> 00:38:28,111
Don't remind me.

576
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:29,140
Oh-ho-ho.

577
00:38:29,185 --> 00:38:30,982
How can l help it?

578
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,227
-Ah.
-Mmm.

579
00:38:39,262 --> 00:38:41,127
What are you doing to me?

580
00:38:41,164 --> 00:38:42,153
You're messing me up.

581
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:46,225
Oh, honey, you're tense.

582
00:38:47,704 --> 00:38:50,172
lt's Holli again, isn't it?

583
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:52,697
Yeah, Miss Holli
Would if she could.

584
00:38:52,742 --> 00:38:55,040
That dame...

585
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:57,376
You heard anything?

586
00:38:57,413 --> 00:39:01,247
Now, you know l don't listen
to that sleazy cow.

587
00:39:02,185 --> 00:39:03,982
Mmm!

588
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,510
Mmm!

589
00:39:07,023 --> 00:39:09,685
Don't . Just don't .

590
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:11,159
Well, why?

591
00:39:11,194 --> 00:39:13,992
Because we can never finish it,
Lonette, you know?

592
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,157
lt-it-it's frustrating.

593
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,666
l'm , uh...

594
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,693
l'm like a... l'm like a plug
without a socket, you know?

595
00:39:28,044 --> 00:39:30,342
Hey, Frank?

596
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,211
Hey, what?

597
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:34,773
Did you ever do it
in the Real World?

598
00:39:34,817 --> 00:39:39,845
Do you ever think about
going back there so you can?

599
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:41,356
No.

600
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:42,881
No way.

601
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:45,520
Maybe you and me?

602
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:47,552
l can't have that
in the Real World.

603
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:51,393
Uh-uh. l can't live without you.

604
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:55,370
But l can't be with you,
you know?

605
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:56,895
lt's , jus... agh!

606
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:01,274
What do you do, huh?

607
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:03,541
What do you do?

608
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:05,706
Well, then...

609
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:08,649
we're just going to have
to pretend then, aren't we?

610
00:40:22,899 --> 00:40:24,230
Hey, Boss!

611
00:40:26,269 --> 00:40:28,169
Ooh!

612
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:31,703
Boss!

613
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:33,231
l heard you, Nails.

614
00:40:36,012 --> 00:40:37,377
Oh, my God, Boss!

615
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:38,846
l wouldn't do it!

616
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,317
Oh! Whew!

617
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,916
Hey, Boss, did l ever
tell you about...?

618
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:50,789
Shut up, Nails.

619
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:02,864
Jack.

620
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:06,231
Jack.

621
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:08,866
Come home, baby.

622
00:41:20,787 --> 00:41:25,417
No... no... no...

623
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:29,451
No. No! No! No! No!

624
00:42:11,437 --> 00:42:12,870
Glad you dropped in.

625
00:42:45,138 --> 00:42:48,665
Well, here we are--
Holli's humble abode.

626
00:42:51,878 --> 00:42:53,869
Do you think she'll let us in?

627
00:42:58,317 --> 00:42:59,841
Forget it!

628
00:42:59,886 --> 00:43:02,878
This party
is by invitation only.

629
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:06,083
This door has got an attitude.

630
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:28,713
How much further?

631
00:43:28,748 --> 00:43:32,081
Oh, uh... l'd say
we're halfway up.

632
00:43:32,118 --> 00:43:34,086
Or halfway down.

633
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,109
Right.

634
00:43:38,858 --> 00:43:41,122
God, l hate heights.

635
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,927
Nails, this is no time
to catch a cold.

636
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,765
lt is not a cold, Boss.

637
00:43:51,804 --> 00:43:53,704
l am allergic to clouds.

638
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:55,206
What?!

639
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:59,371
Ah... ah... ah...

640
00:43:59,412 --> 00:44:02,404
Oh... oh...

641
00:44:02,448 --> 00:44:03,642
Choo!

642
00:44:14,427 --> 00:44:16,258
Pull this?

643
00:44:29,108 --> 00:44:32,236
Ah... ah...

644
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:34,178
Don't even think about it.

645
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,740
Ah...

646
00:44:37,783 --> 00:44:38,807
choo!

647
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:48,051
That step's smashingly good!
Smashingly!

648
00:44:48,094 --> 00:44:49,584
Yeah.

649
00:44:52,965 --> 00:44:55,263
Make sure no one
gets out this door.

650
00:44:55,301 --> 00:44:58,031
Oh! Oh! Absolutemont,
Boss.

651
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,738
Oh!

652
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,222
Stretcher bearers!

653
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,754
Stretcher bearers!

654
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,034
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

655
00:45:52,825 --> 00:45:54,383
Well, hello, Harris.

656
00:45:54,427 --> 00:45:56,122
Welcome to the party.

657
00:45:56,162 --> 00:45:57,595
And what a swell party it is.

658
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,257
Thanks for having me.

659
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,630
l should have known
riffraff like yourself

660
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:04,033
would be involved
in this equation, Sparks.

661
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,697
What equation
is that, Harris?

662
00:46:05,738 --> 00:46:07,035
l've discovered

663
00:46:07,073 --> 00:46:08,370
that if you look for trouble,

664
00:46:08,407 --> 00:46:09,874
you find it.

665
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:11,376
What's your problem?

666
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,775
Bad childhood.

667
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,871
Where's the noid?

668
00:46:14,914 --> 00:46:17,849
You're the only noid here,
Harris.

669
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:23,052
Ooh!

670
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:25,887
Last warning.

671
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:28,086
You stay away from the noid,

672
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:31,494
or you're closed
for business permanently.

673
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,725
Have a splendid evening.

674
00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:39,328
You want to know
what it is about you

675
00:46:39,372 --> 00:46:41,237
that really kicks my ass,
Harris?

676
00:46:44,276 --> 00:46:46,005
How about my foot?

677
00:46:46,045 --> 00:46:47,512
Well, you prance around here

678
00:46:47,546 --> 00:46:50,014
waving that gun around
like you're some big deal.

679
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:52,074
And all this time,
you could cross over

680
00:46:52,118 --> 00:46:53,585
to the Real World,

681
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:55,314
but you haven't got the guts.

682
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,720
You don't have what
it takes to be real.

683
00:46:57,757 --> 00:46:59,725
That makes you
a wimp in my book.

684
00:47:02,228 --> 00:47:05,061
You may be right, Slick.

685
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:11,231
Be content with the cards
you've been dealt.

686
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:22,703
Oh!

687
00:47:26,452 --> 00:47:27,680
What's the deal?

688
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,347
lt's getting serious, Nails.

689
00:47:30,756 --> 00:47:32,053
Holli.

690
00:47:32,091 --> 00:47:34,059
We got to find Jack Deebs.

691
00:47:34,093 --> 00:47:35,424
Right.

692
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:41,916
Go for it!
Go for it!

693
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:45,424
Should l get the door for you,
Jack?

694
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:48,931
Oh, yeah!
Oh, Yeah!

695
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,301
Go for it, Jack!

696
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,828
You better have an appointment!

697
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,467
Go on, Jack.
Go on, Jack.

698
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:00,340
He does...

699
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,572
but you don't .

700
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:05,377
But Holli said we could watch.

701
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:08,675
Watch what?

702
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,152
Go on up.

703
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,592
Go on up.

704
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,253
Go on.

705
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,956
Bring me a souvenir, Jack.

706
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:27,903
Hey, Jack.

707
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:30,304
l've been waiting for you.

708
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:38,107
You like looking at me, Jack,
don't you?

709
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,148
Yow!

710
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,902
Man is in the bedroom.

711
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:04,170
Run, girls, run!
Oh-ho! Oh-ho!

712
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,448
-Okay...
-What?

713
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:13,916
You listen to me, uh, Holli.

714
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,351
That cop, uh, Harris, um,

715
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:18,480
he said we... we...

716
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:21,013
can't go any further
than this, Holli.

717
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,083
-l'm so hot for you, Jack.
-Yeah.

718
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,754
Are you going
to follow the rules?

719
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,762
No.

720
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:29,232
Or are you going to follow...
your instincts?

721
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,233
Yeah.

722
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:33,202
Oh, but Holli said
we could watch.

723
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:35,296
l'll be right back.

724
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:56,255
Yep! Oh, yeah! Oh! Yeah!

725
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,487
Ooh...

726
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:58,552
Ooh.

727
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,256
Ah... ah...

728
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,792
Ooh.

729
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,827
Mm-hmm.

730
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,814
We're almost there.

731
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,748
Whoa! Okay...

732
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:51,243
Whoa... whoa!

733
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,441
Whoa!

734
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:54,075
Ooh!

735
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,375
Holli!

736
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,518
Holli...

737
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,994
Whoa...

738
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:36,718
Mm, was it good for you?

739
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,320
lt wasn't what l expected.

740
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:41,449
Y-You gonna go in there

741
00:52:41,488 --> 00:52:44,355
and-and make it up
to Lonette, boss?

742
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:46,018
Yeah, why not.

743
00:52:46,093 --> 00:52:48,357
The fact is,
she's the best thing that

744
00:52:48,395 --> 00:52:49,589
ever happened to me.

745
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:50,824
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

746
00:52:50,864 --> 00:52:54,356
Oh, l could put overtime
in on Deebs' Porsche.

747
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:55,868
l'm tireless.

748
00:52:55,902 --> 00:52:57,028
Forget it.

749
00:52:57,104 --> 00:52:59,299
The goons can't touch him
in Sweet Place,

750
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:02,399
and we'd just run ourselves
ragged giving him the shadow.

751
00:53:02,442 --> 00:53:05,104
-Well... what should l do?
-Hmm?

752
00:53:05,145 --> 00:53:07,113
Man the phones,
keep pumping our informants.

753
00:53:07,147 --> 00:53:08,375
Somebody might l.D. him.

754
00:53:08,415 --> 00:53:09,507
And if that happens,

755
00:53:09,549 --> 00:53:10,607
you call me.

756
00:53:10,651 --> 00:53:13,119
You call me here or Lonette's ,

757
00:53:13,153 --> 00:53:14,814
my place, l don't know.

758
00:53:14,855 --> 00:53:17,346
Just don't make a move
without me, you got it?

759
00:53:17,391 --> 00:53:18,790
l got it, boss!

760
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:28,824
Oh!

761
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:30,734
Come on, let's go, now!

762
00:53:45,952 --> 00:53:48,921
Hey, Lonette...
where's my drink, babe?

763
00:53:48,955 --> 00:53:50,479
You know, l live to serve you.

764
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:52,424
l heard you
the first ten times.

765
00:53:52,459 --> 00:53:54,222
Hey, come on, l'm -l'm sorry.

766
00:53:54,261 --> 00:53:56,388
Get a little closer here,
babe, give us a kiss.

767
00:53:58,465 --> 00:53:59,762
Say it, don't spray it.

768
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,028
Go away.

769
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:02,261
l'm out of here!

770
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:06,738
Tough night?

771
00:54:06,773 --> 00:54:08,138
The usual.

772
00:54:08,175 --> 00:54:09,335
Yeah.

773
00:54:09,376 --> 00:54:13,312
Why you want to hang
around here, huh?

774
00:54:13,347 --> 00:54:14,837
This place should be erased.

775
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:17,349
Hey... it's a living.

776
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:18,908
Even a doodle's got to eat.

777
00:54:20,787 --> 00:54:22,982
Why don't you put that arm
around me.

778
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,115
lt's been kind of a tough day.

779
00:54:25,158 --> 00:54:26,352
Oh...

780
00:54:35,168 --> 00:54:37,193
Ooh!

781
00:54:37,237 --> 00:54:38,261
Yeah?

782
00:54:38,305 --> 00:54:42,105
Listen, you sludge hog
excuse for a cop.

783
00:54:42,142 --> 00:54:43,473
Deebs and Holli just made it,

784
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,535
and they're about to make
an unscheduled trip

785
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:46,807
to the other side.

786
00:54:46,847 --> 00:54:48,144
Ooh... Oh! Doh!

787
00:54:48,181 --> 00:54:49,546
Holli?! Sheesh!

788
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:53,178
No end of trouble that
a little minx like her can make.

789
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,986
Why, she might damage the entire
interworld matrix or something.

790
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,581
l don't give a doodle!

791
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:00,559
Just bust her ass!

792
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:07,061
Ooh, better call Frank.
Better call Frank.

793
00:55:09,569 --> 00:55:13,300
Uh, oh,
l just can't take it anymore.

794
00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:17,241
Where's Frank?!

795
00:55:17,277 --> 00:55:19,404
Frank! Frank Harris?
Looking for Frank!

796
00:55:23,817 --> 00:55:26,650
Frank! Frank!

797
00:55:26,686 --> 00:55:27,983
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

798
00:55:28,054 --> 00:55:29,316
Where is he?! Where is he?!

799
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:30,983
Oh, no!

800
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:36,453
Frank!

801
00:55:36,496 --> 00:55:37,622
Frank Harris!

802
00:55:46,106 --> 00:55:47,198
Whoo!

803
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,468
Aah, aah, aah! Frank!

804
00:55:48,508 --> 00:55:50,738
Frank! Frank!

805
00:55:52,145 --> 00:55:54,010
Thank God!

806
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,638
Okay.

807
00:55:57,417 --> 00:55:59,009
Yeah, Nails, what is it?

808
00:55:59,085 --> 00:56:02,213
You having a good time,
boss, eh? Heh-heh-heh!

809
00:56:02,255 --> 00:56:04,120
Yeah, l guess l'm
having a good time.

810
00:56:04,157 --> 00:56:05,954
-Are we having a good time?
-Yeah.

811
00:56:05,992 --> 00:56:07,721
Nails, leave us alone.

812
00:56:09,062 --> 00:56:12,589
Oh, l just love
your little ears.

813
00:56:14,434 --> 00:56:16,299
Okay, Nails, what's the problem?

814
00:56:16,336 --> 00:56:18,201
Ooh! No trouble.

815
00:56:18,238 --> 00:56:20,365
Nothing l can't handle myself.

816
00:56:20,407 --> 00:56:22,875
l was just checking in
with youse. You know.

817
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:25,275
Yeah. You sure?

818
00:56:25,312 --> 00:56:27,678
All right. Okay, Nails.

819
00:57:02,015 --> 00:57:05,109
-lt's ... incredible.
-Yeah.

820
00:57:22,402 --> 00:57:25,132
No...

821
00:57:29,843 --> 00:57:33,745
No... no...

822
00:57:42,956 --> 00:57:45,891
Oh...

823
00:57:49,663 --> 00:57:51,654
Wait a minute here!

824
00:57:51,698 --> 00:57:54,326
What am l nervous for? Oh!

825
00:57:54,367 --> 00:57:56,961
l could do this job myself!

826
00:57:58,004 --> 00:57:59,528
Hmm.

827
00:57:59,573 --> 00:58:01,200
Mm... mm.

828
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:03,106
Mm, mm, mm.

829
00:58:03,143 --> 00:58:04,269
Mm.

830
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:14,880
Ooh-ooh! Ooh! Aah!

831
00:58:17,857 --> 00:58:20,382
Holli, why do we have
to go back?

832
00:58:20,427 --> 00:58:24,158
lt's ... it's so great here.

833
00:58:24,197 --> 00:58:29,134
Oh... but, Jack,

836
00:58:36,276 --> 00:58:40,406
and together... together
we're gonna be unstoppable.

837
00:58:40,447 --> 00:58:41,744
Oh.

838

You look horrible.

You look like

00:59:11,811 --> 00:59:12,778
Peace, man.

859

As you see, there have been
some changes around here.

867
00:59:34,668 --> 00:59:37,933
You are a biomorphic menace.

869

01:02:09,956 --> 01:02:13,892
Well, we didn't mean

928
01:02:13,926 --> 01:02:15,188

She was really
a cheap piece of work.

941
01:02:39,385 --> 01:02:41,353
l don't know, l thought
she was kind of pretty.

942
01:02:41,387 --> 01:02:43,116
You know, l got this

Hey!

947
01:03:02,441 --> 01:03:04,409
What happened, you ink stain?

948
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:06,138
He had a run-in with a noid,

949
01:03:06,178 --> 01:03:09,079
and then he got inked.

950

lt was Holli Would.

952
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:14,847
Holli is a doodle.

953
01:03:14,887 --> 01:03:16,149
Not anymore.

954
01:03:16,188 --> 01:03:18,383
She's made it
with that Deebs asshole.

955
01:03:18,424 --> 01:03:19,823
She's changed.

956
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:23,317
Now you can buy me more fries,
dick head.

957
01:03:36,142 --> 01:03:38,633
This is gonna be
the biggest shit storm

958
01:03:38,678 --> 01:03:41,112
the Cool World has ever seen.

959
01:03:41,147 --> 01:03:42,910
Round and round l go

960
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:45,008
Like a leaf on a tide

961
01:03:45,051 --> 01:03:49,818
l should stay away,
but what can l do?

962
01:03:49,855 --> 01:03:51,948
Oh...

963
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:54,551
Oh. Oh.

964
01:03:54,594 --> 01:03:57,586
So many men. Oh...

965
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:59,029
And they're real.

966
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:01,361
Oh, smell.... them.

967
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,958
Holli, Holli...

968
01:04:03,069 --> 01:04:04,434
you're with me, remember?

969
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,438
You know, you can't go
around smelling people.

970
01:04:06,472 --> 01:04:07,564
Yeah, Jack.

971
01:04:07,607 --> 01:04:10,303
You sit.

972
01:04:10,343 --> 01:04:11,469

So, uh, what do you

975
01:04:15,348 --> 01:04:16,337
Oh.

976
01:04:16,382 --> 01:04:17,508
Anything they have.

977
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:19,882
You know, they got
95 different things, Holli.

978
01:04:19,919 --> 01:04:22,114
Mm... whoa.

979
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:23,587
95?

980
01:04:23,623 --> 01:04:24,612
Uh-huh.

981
01:04:24,657 --> 01:04:26,147
l'll have one of each.

982
01:04:26,192 --> 01:04:29,491
Holli, you know, l'm into having
fun and everything,

983
01:04:29,528 --> 01:04:31,496
but you got to slow down,

984
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:32,554
okay?

985
01:04:32,598 --> 01:04:35,123
What l want to slow down for?

986
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:38,330
l'm gonna get everything
l ever wanted.

987
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:43,001
You think any of these men
are gonna say no to Holli?

988
01:04:43,075 --> 01:04:46,101
Not on your life, pal.

989
01:04:46,145 --> 01:04:48,113
Gentlemen prefer blondes.

990
01:04:51,784 --> 01:04:53,376
Thank you very much,
everybody.

991
01:04:53,419 --> 01:04:54,511
Glad you enjoyed that.

992
01:04:54,553 --> 01:04:56,521
Wonderful old standard.

993
01:04:56,555 --> 01:04:58,523
" Let's Make Love."

994
01:04:58,557 --> 01:05:00,286
Hey! She's with me!

995
01:05:00,326 --> 01:05:02,226
No, she's with us.

996
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,357
Hey!

01:05:06,399 --> 01:05:07,832
Stay out!

998
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:43,527
Hit it.

999
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:45,935
Uh, Brian, please.

1000
01:05:55,581 --> 01:06:00,018
Here we sit and we chatter

1001
01:06:00,052 --> 01:06:04,216
What are we thinking of?

1002
01:06:04,256 --> 01:06:08,625
-Let's not make with the patter
-Oh, whoa.

1003
01:06:08,661 --> 01:06:12,062

Oh, my, but it's stifling

lf you roar like a lion

1007
01:06:22,007 --> 01:06:26,444
l could coo like a dove

1008
01:06:26,479 --> 01:06:31,109
lf you're sold, begin buying

1009
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:34,176
Baby

1010
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:35,881
Let's make love

1011
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:37,946
Gosh, it's hot

1012
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:42,290
No, don't turn TV on

1013
01:06:42,328 --> 01:06:46,662
lnstead just turn me on

1014
01:06:46,699 --> 01:06:51,966
l'll light up like neon...

1015
01:06:52,004 --> 01:06:54,529
When your partner gets inked,
you do something about it.

1016
01:06:54,573 --> 01:06:57,974
He was your partner,
so you do something.

1017
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,001
Well, l'm not buying it.

1018
01:07:00,045 --> 01:07:03,105
Well, how about " a man's got to
do what a man's got to do" ?

1019
01:07:03,149 --> 01:07:04,776
Can't you just think about me

1020
01:07:04,817 --> 01:07:05,943
for a minute, Frank?

1021
01:07:06,051 --> 01:07:07,484
l mean, where does this
leave me?

1022
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,487
What are you mad about?

1023
01:07:08,521 --> 01:07:09,545
Oh!

1024
01:07:09,588 --> 01:07:11,681
l'm mad because
you talk about crossing,

1025
01:07:11,724 --> 01:07:13,157
and-and you don't even care...

1026
01:07:13,192 --> 01:07:14,523
l don't care?
how it makes me feel.

1027
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,959
Whoa, whoa.
How do you feel, Lon?

1028
01:07:16,028 --> 01:07:17,290
How do you feel?

1029
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:18,853
Left out.

1030
01:07:18,898 --> 01:07:20,798
You think l want
to go back there?

1031
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:22,528
You think l want to go back?

1032
01:07:22,568 --> 01:07:24,365
Well, why wouldn't you
want to go back?

1033
01:07:24,403 --> 01:07:25,893
That's real to you, isn't it?!

1034
01:07:25,938 --> 01:07:27,701
Let me tell you something
about over there.

1035
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:30,368
lt hurts over there.
lt-lt's lonely over there.

1036
01:07:30,409 --> 01:07:32,309
lt's a war over there.

1037
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:34,403
They got eight million ways
for you to die, hon,

1038
01:07:34,446 --> 01:07:35,970
and all of them are permanent.

1039
01:07:36,048 --> 01:07:38,812
This is real for me,
this. With you.

1040
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:41,149
And if l want to stay
with you, l got to go back.

1041
01:07:41,187 --> 01:07:42,745
Because if Jack Deebs
and Holli Would

1042
01:07:42,788 --> 01:07:44,153
are after what
l think they are,

1043
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:45,987
there won't be
any here or there.

1044
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:49,254
Understand, Loni?
No more here.

1045
01:07:49,295 --> 01:07:50,819
Just go ahead!

1046
01:07:50,863 --> 01:07:51,795
Hey, hey, hey.

1047
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,033
l'm comin' back.

1048
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,967
Jack.

1049
01:08:37,042 --> 01:08:38,703
Jack.

1050
01:08:38,744 --> 01:08:40,177
What's going on?

1051
01:08:40,212 --> 01:08:41,509
Something's wrong.

1052
01:08:41,547 --> 01:08:43,208
Something's very, very wrong.

1053
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:45,342
No shit, pal.

1054
01:08:45,384 --> 01:08:46,408
So what is it?

1055
01:08:46,452 --> 01:08:50,149
l mean, l'm ... l'm up there,
and l was just...

1056
01:08:50,189 --> 01:08:53,590
l was moving and shaking
with the best of 'em.

1057
01:08:53,626 --> 01:08:55,594
And all of a sudden, l was...

1058
01:08:55,628 --> 01:08:57,152
l-l went doodle again.

1059
01:08:57,196 --> 01:08:59,687
l mean...

1060
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:44,805
Look at this, Ma. No hands!

1061
01:09:44,843 --> 01:09:46,470
Oh, Frank, don't do that!

1062
01:09:46,512 --> 01:09:48,343
l wouldn't do that.
Come on!

1063
01:10:01,894 --> 01:10:05,887
No!

1064
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:12,668
Good luck, Frank.

1065
01:10:14,599 --> 01:10:16,692
Please just let me think.

1066
01:10:16,735 --> 01:10:18,464
Let me think.

1067
01:10:26,978 --> 01:10:28,946
Cool, Jack.

1068
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,039
Really cool.

1069
01:10:31,149 --> 01:10:33,242
l guess you have a tough time

1070
01:10:33,285 --> 01:10:35,845
driving and thinking
at the same time, huh?

1071
01:10:37,489 --> 01:10:38,751
Oh!

1072
01:10:41,226 --> 01:10:43,057
The Spike of Power!

1073
01:10:43,128 --> 01:10:44,060
The what?!

1074
01:10:44,129 --> 01:10:46,393
The Spike could heal me.

1075
01:10:46,431 --> 01:10:48,797
Ooh, l guess Vinnie put
the Spike

1076
01:10:48,834 --> 01:10:50,859
at the top of the casino.

1077
01:10:52,304 --> 01:10:53,703
You're nuts.

1078
01:10:53,739 --> 01:10:55,468
You are nuts.

1079
01:10:55,507 --> 01:10:57,600
Don't say l'm nuts.

1080
01:10:57,642 --> 01:10:59,940
l've had enough ego
out of you, pal.

1081
01:10:59,978 --> 01:11:02,344
And you used to think
you made me up.

1082
01:11:02,381 --> 01:11:04,747
You're thinking
like a doodle, Holli.

1083
01:11:04,783 --> 01:11:06,410
There is no Spike of Power.

1084
01:11:06,451 --> 01:11:09,386
There's got to be
a Spike of Power.

1085
01:11:09,421 --> 01:11:11,981
And l'm going to find it
right now.

1086
01:11:12,023 --> 01:11:13,149
No, you're not.

1087
01:11:13,191 --> 01:11:14,522
Okay? Yeah.

1088
01:11:14,559 --> 01:11:16,026
We're going there, Jack.

1089
01:11:16,094 --> 01:11:17,493
No, we're not.

1090
01:11:17,529 --> 01:11:19,656
You're a nice fellow, Jack.

1091
01:11:19,698 --> 01:11:21,131
Don't piss me off.

1092
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:22,258
Oh, yeah?

1093
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,927
What are you going to do
about it, Holli?

1094
01:11:23,969 --> 01:11:26,335
Huh?

1095
01:11:33,412 --> 01:11:34,572
Goddamn it!

1096
01:13:06,905 --> 01:13:09,999
What are you doing here, Harris?

1097
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:12,737
l'm taking you
and the bimbo back.

1098
01:13:14,646 --> 01:13:16,637
What are you going to do?
Shoot me?

1099
01:13:16,681 --> 01:13:18,740
Why don't you shoot me,
goddamn it!?

1100
01:13:18,783 --> 01:13:20,182
Shoot me, Harris.

1101
01:13:20,218 --> 01:13:21,583
Go on, shoot...

1102
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:24,145
Don't push me!
Don't push me!

1103
01:13:24,189 --> 01:13:25,451
You just couldn't take

1104
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:27,458
a piece of good advice,
could you?

1105
01:13:27,492 --> 01:13:30,017
No, Jack, you had to listen
to your Johnson.

1106
01:13:30,095 --> 01:13:31,323
l've had it with you, Harris.

1107
01:13:31,363 --> 01:13:32,728
l've had it with you,
goddamn it!

1108
01:13:32,764 --> 01:13:34,698
You've had it with me?!

1109
01:13:34,733 --> 01:13:36,598
You've had it with me,

1110
01:13:36,635 --> 01:13:37,897
you piece of shit?

1111
01:13:37,936 --> 01:13:39,233
You screw us all
for a piece of ass,

1112
01:13:39,271 --> 01:13:40,260
and you've had it with me?

1113
01:13:40,305 --> 01:13:41,294
Where is she?

1114
01:13:45,076 --> 01:13:46,737
Great.

1115
01:13:48,013 --> 01:13:49,480
lt's happening, Jack.

1116
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:54,551
Got news for you, Harris.

1117
01:13:54,586 --> 01:13:56,645
lt's happening to her, too.

1118
01:14:00,659 --> 01:14:02,183
Jack!

1119
01:14:02,227 --> 01:14:03,956
Jack, l saw it this time.

1120
01:14:03,995 --> 01:14:06,293
-Jack, l saw it. l swear it.
-Jennifer...

1121
01:14:06,331 --> 01:14:07,298
l saw this thing.
lt ate your house again.

1122
01:14:07,332 --> 01:14:08,128
Remember when we came
over earlier?

1123
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:08,791
Jennifer...

1124
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:10,460
l wasn't imagining things. l...

1125
01:14:10,502 --> 01:14:11,992
All right, Jack.

1126
01:14:12,037 --> 01:14:14,403
Oh, this is another friend
from out of town?

1127
01:14:14,439 --> 01:14:15,667
Uh-huh, yeah.
l-l mean...

1128
01:14:15,707 --> 01:14:16,833
What happened to your suit?

1129
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:17,842
What's going on

1130
01:14:17,876 --> 01:14:19,002
between this guy and me,

1131
01:14:19,044 --> 01:14:21,239
it's -it's -it's kind
of, uh... complex.

1132
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:22,439
l-l can explain it

1133
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,970
some other time.

1134
01:14:24,015 --> 01:14:25,209
l'll bet.

1135
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:27,309
Look, we got no more time
for Goldilocks here.

1136
01:14:27,352 --> 01:14:28,478
Where do we find Holli?

1137
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:31,182
Okay, she went
to the Union Plaza.

1138
01:14:31,222 --> 01:14:32,484
-The Spike.
-She went to meet this...

1139
01:14:32,524 --> 01:14:33,491
She went to meet

1140
01:14:33,525 --> 01:14:34,492
this guy, Vegas Vinnie.

1141
01:14:34,526 --> 01:14:37,256
The only problem is,
she took my car, so...

1142
01:14:38,496 --> 01:14:40,396
l've got my mom's car.

1143
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:42,661
Let's go, miss.

1144
01:14:42,701 --> 01:14:44,293
We're trying
to protect the balance

1145
01:14:44,336 --> 01:14:45,894
of the entire known
universe here.

1146
01:14:45,937 --> 01:14:48,201
Oh, gee, l guess my mom
won't chuck a fit, then,

1147
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,570
if we took it, huh?

1148
01:14:57,882 --> 01:14:59,179
Wow!

1149
01:15:02,887 --> 01:15:04,115
Miss?

1150
01:15:09,794 --> 01:15:11,489
Miss?

1151
01:15:18,236 --> 01:15:20,067
Can l help you, Miss?

1152
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:27,343
l'm looking for Vegas Vinnie.

1153
01:15:27,379 --> 01:15:29,677
There's no... there's no
Vegas Vinnie here.

1154
01:15:29,714 --> 01:15:31,011
l'm sorry.

1155
01:15:31,116 --> 01:15:32,208
He owns the place.

1156
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:35,014
l don't ... l...
There's no Vegas Vinnie here.

1157
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,315
l'm sorry.
l-l can't help you.

1158
01:16:00,879 --> 01:16:02,141
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

1159
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:03,272
No.

1160
01:16:03,314 --> 01:16:04,781
Sorry.

1161
01:16:04,816 --> 01:16:06,841
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

1162
01:16:09,487 --> 01:16:11,011
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

1163
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:19,321
Vegas Vinnie is a story
based on a real guy--

1164
01:16:19,364 --> 01:16:21,594
this doc l met--

1165
01:16:21,633 --> 01:16:25,865
when l first went across,
uh, 50 years ago.

1166
01:16:25,904 --> 01:16:28,099
Cool World's real?

1167
01:16:28,139 --> 01:16:29,470
Neat!

1168
01:16:29,507 --> 01:16:31,839
He and l,
we mapped out the tunnel,

1169
01:16:31,876 --> 01:16:34,208
the passageway
between both worlds.

1170
01:16:34,245 --> 01:16:38,272
And we saw how easily
one could disrupt that balance

1171
01:16:38,316 --> 01:16:41,911
and destroy both universes.

1172
01:16:41,953 --> 01:16:43,716
Destroy the universe?

1173
01:16:52,831 --> 01:16:54,662
When you have
some money to spend,

1174
01:16:54,699 --> 01:16:56,257
we'd love to see you, honey.

1175
01:16:56,301 --> 01:16:58,132
Until then,
you have to keep out.

1176
01:17:02,974 --> 01:17:04,202
l can't ...

1177
01:17:06,144 --> 01:17:07,441
Oh!

1178
01:17:18,289 --> 01:17:20,757
Uh, pretty-looking sign
we got up there, huh, Miss?

1179
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:24,489
Yeah, that spike in the center.

1180
01:17:24,529 --> 01:17:26,429
lt's real bright.

1181
01:17:26,464 --> 01:17:28,989
You sound kind of down, Miss.

1182
01:17:29,033 --> 01:17:31,001
Uh, have bad luck
at the tables?

1183
01:17:31,069 --> 01:17:34,004
Let's just say it
ain't been my day.

1184
01:17:34,105 --> 01:17:36,665
Oh, well, don't worry, uh...

1185
01:17:39,043 --> 01:17:40,601
Good Lord!

1186
01:17:40,645 --> 01:17:43,307
l never thought
l'd see it happen!

1187
01:17:43,348 --> 01:17:45,373
Miss, what you looking for,

1188
01:17:45,416 --> 01:17:47,179
you can't find around here.

1189
01:17:47,218 --> 01:17:48,378
You better go.

1190
01:17:48,419 --> 01:17:51,582
How do you know
what l'm lookin' for?

1191
01:17:52,991 --> 01:17:56,950
You do know
what l am, don't you?

1192
01:17:56,995 --> 01:17:58,257
You know where l'm from.

1193
01:18:02,801 --> 01:18:04,063
Oh, my goodness.

1194
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:20,076
Old man, l'm not leaving
till l find out

1195
01:18:20,118 --> 01:18:22,552
how you know so much. Talk!

1196
01:18:22,587 --> 01:18:23,815
Talk!

1197
01:18:25,223 --> 01:18:26,952
You're not telling me
everything you know.

1198
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,865
Y-Y...

1199
01:18:36,901 --> 01:18:38,801
Y-You...

1200
01:18:38,837 --> 01:18:41,670
Y-Y-You're d-doodle!

1201
01:18:43,241 --> 01:18:45,402
ln Cool World,
they knew me as "Whiskers."

1202
01:18:45,443 --> 01:18:47,001
Dr. Vincent Whiskers.

1203
01:18:47,045 --> 01:18:49,275
Didn't you touch the Spike?

1204
01:18:49,314 --> 01:18:52,806
Sure, l touched it,
but l couldn't hold it.

1205
01:18:52,851 --> 01:18:53,943
No one can!

1206
01:18:53,985 --> 01:18:55,543
So it is up there!

1207
01:18:55,587 --> 01:18:56,884
And it is real,

1208
01:18:56,921 --> 01:18:59,355
and it's going to make me real.

1209
01:19:01,659 --> 01:19:02,956
Sure, it's up there,

1210
01:19:03,061 --> 01:19:05,859
but it's not going
to do you any good.

1211
01:19:07,599 --> 01:19:10,693
Just because you weren't
man enough to hold onto it.

1212
01:19:10,735 --> 01:19:13,431
l need the force
in that Spike.

1213
01:19:13,471 --> 01:19:15,405
And l'm going up there.

1214
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,907
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

1215
01:19:18,409 --> 01:19:21,435
That power doesn't belong
to you!

1216
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:23,709
l don't care.
l want it.

1217
01:19:23,748 --> 01:19:25,147
And l don't care...

1218
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,980
Stop!

1219
01:19:27,051 --> 01:19:28,916
Cease! Desist!

1220
01:19:28,953 --> 01:19:29,977
l mean it!

1221
01:19:30,054 --> 01:19:32,215
-Ow, ow!
-Make this easy on yourself.

1222
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:35,455
There she is.

1223
01:19:35,493 --> 01:19:37,120
She looks pretty.

1224
01:19:37,161 --> 01:19:39,891
Come on,
you little troublemaker.

1225
01:19:39,931 --> 01:19:41,956
Nobody's going to stop me now.

1226
01:19:44,802 --> 01:19:46,997
Harris, help me.

1227
01:19:47,038 --> 01:19:48,335
You've got to stop that girl.

1228
01:19:48,373 --> 01:19:50,466
lf she moves it,
it could be the end

1229
01:19:50,508 --> 01:19:53,341
of everything.

1230
01:19:53,378 --> 01:19:54,902
Doc? Oh, my God.

1231
01:19:54,946 --> 01:19:56,174
-l gotta get...
-Wait, wait.

1232
01:19:56,214 --> 01:19:57,272
Jack, please, l need you here

1233
01:19:57,315 --> 01:19:58,612
to take care
of my friend. Please.

1234
01:19:58,650 --> 01:19:59,617
This is my department.

1235
01:19:59,651 --> 01:20:00,618
l gotta stop her, Harris.

1236
01:20:00,652 --> 01:20:01,778
-Jack!
-Let go!

1237
01:20:05,723 --> 01:20:06,690
Wait, Jack!

1238
01:20:06,724 --> 01:20:07,691
Let me go, Harris.

1239
01:20:07,725 --> 01:20:09,352
l'm not gonna hurt her.

1240
01:20:09,394 --> 01:20:10,588
Help him.

1241
01:20:51,102 --> 01:20:52,296
Holli.

1242
01:21:58,462 --> 01:22:00,293
Crazy doodle bitch.

1243
01:22:05,736 --> 01:22:07,067
All right.

1244
01:22:30,294 --> 01:22:32,228
Hello, Holli.

1245
01:22:32,262 --> 01:22:34,059
Guess what. You're through.

1246
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:37,389
You know, sweetheart,

1247
01:22:37,434 --> 01:22:39,834
you look good in the flesh.

1248
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:41,929
lt's almost a shame
l gotta take you back.

1249
01:22:41,972 --> 01:22:43,963
You are going back, you know.

1250
01:23:00,391 --> 01:23:01,221
Would!

1251
01:23:20,911 --> 01:23:22,845
Um...

1252
01:23:26,116 --> 01:23:27,811
You're squeezing my head.

1253
01:23:27,851 --> 01:23:29,045
There.

1254
01:23:29,086 --> 01:23:30,417
As good as new.

1255
01:23:36,093 --> 01:23:37,720
Where do you think you're going?

1256
01:23:37,761 --> 01:23:39,058
lt's over.

1257
01:23:39,096 --> 01:23:40,586
What are you gonna do-- jump?

1258
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:41,620
Just get down.

1259
01:23:42,566 --> 01:23:44,033
For Christ's sake.

1260
01:23:44,068 --> 01:23:46,502
What? You got ink
for brains? Get down.

1261
01:23:47,704 --> 01:23:50,104
Don't piss me off, Would.

1262
01:23:51,642 --> 01:23:52,904
You go on that roof,

1263
01:23:52,943 --> 01:23:54,001
you screw us all.

1264
01:23:54,044 --> 01:23:55,773
l'm not messing around here.

1265
01:23:55,813 --> 01:23:57,075
Oh, Christ.

1266
01:23:57,114 --> 01:23:58,513
There's nothing up there.

1267
01:23:58,549 --> 01:23:59,675
Let's just go home,

1268
01:23:59,716 --> 01:24:01,707
fix this mess.

1269
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,747
Get down!

1270
01:24:07,224 --> 01:24:08,452
Would!

1271
01:24:13,263 --> 01:24:15,231
Don't .

1272
01:24:15,265 --> 01:24:16,232
Harris.

1273
01:24:16,266 --> 01:24:17,358
What?!

1274
01:24:17,401 --> 01:24:19,028
Harris, help me.

1275
01:24:19,069 --> 01:24:20,058
Ah...

1276
01:24:22,673 --> 01:24:24,300
Help me.

1277
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:36,051
Oh, Harris... help me.

1278
01:24:36,086 --> 01:24:38,145
Hold on.

1279
01:24:38,188 --> 01:24:40,850
l should do the world a favor
and let you fall.

1280
01:24:43,293 --> 01:24:44,590
Easy.

1281
01:24:44,628 --> 01:24:45,652
Easy does it.

1282
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,663
Good.

1283
01:24:46,697 --> 01:24:48,255
Now, hold on.

1284
01:24:48,298 --> 01:24:50,596
Here we go.

1285
01:24:50,634 --> 01:24:51,931
Here we go.

1286
01:24:51,969 --> 01:24:53,732
We're going home.

1287
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:55,397
All right, careful.

1288
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:57,304
Come on.

1289
01:25:11,722 --> 01:25:12,654
Oh, my God.

1290
01:25:31,175 --> 01:25:34,167
Jack, this is your chance
to make it right.

1291
01:25:34,211 --> 01:25:35,701
lt's up to you now.

1292
01:25:35,746 --> 01:25:37,077
Okay. Okay.

1293
01:25:39,082 --> 01:25:43,280
This time, l'm gonna
do something right.

1294
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:08,303
He's gonna kill himself.

1295
01:26:08,345 --> 01:26:10,370
He's fulfilling his destiny.

1296
01:26:10,414 --> 01:26:12,780
He's becoming a hero.

1297
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:42,264
Oh, please.

1298
01:28:58,081 --> 01:28:59,241
The Spike.

1299
01:28:59,282 --> 01:29:02,012
lt's up to me
to return the Spike.

1300
01:29:05,122 --> 01:29:05,986
Got it!

1301
01:29:06,056 --> 01:29:06,988
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

1302
01:29:07,057 --> 01:29:08,183
Whoa.

1303
01:29:08,225 --> 01:29:11,558
The pain is unbearable.

1304
01:29:19,369 --> 01:29:20,563
Hit me.

1305
01:29:21,705 --> 01:29:23,332
Deuces wild?

1306
01:29:38,855 --> 01:29:40,117
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

1307
01:29:45,762 --> 01:29:50,131
The world has
only one chance left.

1308
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:54,035
lt's up to me to return the
Spike and plug the hole.

1309
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:57,369
Huh! You fiends!

1310
01:29:57,407 --> 01:30:00,604
Trying to stop me.

1311
01:30:31,775 --> 01:30:33,242
Baby, baby...

1312
01:30:33,276 --> 01:30:35,039
The king! Oh, it's the king!

1313
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:51,750
Oh, l hate being
bottled up like that.

1314
01:30:51,795 --> 01:30:53,092
Oh, man, boss.

1315
01:30:53,196 --> 01:30:56,529
Hold on. Hold on.

1316
01:31:17,954 --> 01:31:19,080
Hmm?

1317
01:31:33,103 --> 01:31:35,469
Feel the air, Jack.

1318
01:31:35,505 --> 01:31:36,904
We're staying.

1319
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:39,170
l like it here, Jack.

1320
01:31:41,177 --> 01:31:42,474
Come here.

1321
01:31:42,512 --> 01:31:46,073
Give me the Spike, Jack.

1322
01:31:46,116 --> 01:31:49,085
You love me, don't you, Jack?

1323
01:31:49,119 --> 01:31:52,111
Yes, l do.

1324
01:31:55,659 --> 01:31:57,422
Well, then, help me.

1325
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:59,587
Give it to me, Jack.

1326
01:32:01,598 --> 01:32:03,122
Okay, honey-poo.

1327
01:32:05,402 --> 01:32:08,030
Hey, goodie-goodie-goodie.

1328
01:32:08,071 --> 01:32:09,868
Pencil dicks.

1329
01:32:09,906 --> 01:32:10,873
Aha!

1330
01:32:10,907 --> 01:32:12,033
A trick!

1331
01:32:12,075 --> 01:32:15,374
On second thought,
l must do what is right

1332
01:32:15,412 --> 01:32:17,539
and return the Spike.

1333
01:32:17,581 --> 01:32:19,845
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1334
01:32:19,883 --> 01:32:21,874
Whoa!

1335
01:32:36,299 --> 01:32:37,960
Oh, golly, oh!

1336
01:32:59,723 --> 01:33:00,781
Hey!

1337
01:33:06,029 --> 01:33:07,656
Damn!

1338
01:33:11,835 --> 01:33:13,530
Jack?!

1339
01:33:17,607 --> 01:33:19,575
He-he's gone.

1340
01:33:19,609 --> 01:33:20,576
He's ...

1341
01:33:21,678 --> 01:33:23,202
He's gone.

1342
01:33:23,246 --> 01:33:24,474
Dead?

1343
01:33:24,514 --> 01:33:28,814
l don't know for sure,
but l don't think so.

1344
01:33:28,852 --> 01:33:29,819
You know,

1345
01:33:29,853 --> 01:33:31,548
maybe the Spike protected them.

1346
01:33:31,588 --> 01:33:32,987
lts power is beyond

1347
01:33:33,023 --> 01:33:34,012
our understanding.

1348
01:33:35,091 --> 01:33:36,080
Mm-hmm.

1349
01:33:43,466 --> 01:33:45,366
l'm sorry he didn't make it.

1350
01:33:45,402 --> 01:33:49,361
l got to take him
back with me.

1351
01:33:49,406 --> 01:33:51,067
There's a nice gal back there.

1352
01:33:51,107 --> 01:33:56,602
She deserves to see him,
dead or alive.

1353
01:33:56,646 --> 01:33:59,615
Okay, Doc, let 'er rip.

1354
01:34:04,454 --> 01:34:05,682
Wow.

1355
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:13,657
Arriba, arriba, arriba, arriba!

1356
01:34:51,331 --> 01:34:53,925
Oh!

1357
01:34:53,967 --> 01:34:56,026
Oh, Nails!

1358
01:34:59,906 --> 01:35:01,498
He didn't make it.

1359
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:03,372
l'm sorry.

1360
01:35:03,409 --> 01:35:06,037
Oh, Frank, honey! No, please!

1361
01:35:06,145 --> 01:35:09,376
Oh, no, please,
you can't leave me!

1362
01:35:09,415 --> 01:35:12,612
Oh, no!

1363
01:35:12,652 --> 01:35:14,779
Who killed him, Nails?

1364
01:35:14,821 --> 01:35:17,221
He was pushed off a building.

1365
01:35:17,257 --> 01:35:18,224
Who pushed him?

1366
01:35:18,258 --> 01:35:20,317
Holli Would.

1367
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,385
Holli Would?

1368
01:35:22,428 --> 01:35:24,760
That bitch!

1369
01:35:28,401 --> 01:35:29,390
Nails,

1370
01:35:29,435 --> 01:35:32,836
was she a doodle
when she aced him?

1371
01:35:32,872 --> 01:35:34,897
Yeah! So what?!

1372
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:36,465
So what?

1373
01:35:36,509 --> 01:35:38,238
Oh! So what?

1374
01:35:38,278 --> 01:35:40,371
Well, what happens
to noids who traffic

1375
01:35:40,413 --> 01:35:41,778
in the Cool World, Nails,

1376
01:35:41,814 --> 01:35:43,611
when they get killed
by a doodle?

1377
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:46,483
They become a doodle themselves.

1378
01:35:47,287 --> 01:35:48,345
Hmm?

1379
01:35:50,323 --> 01:35:53,986
Hot dog! Dig it! Dig me!

1380
01:35:54,027 --> 01:35:55,995
Ba-ba-bum...

1381
01:35:56,029 --> 01:35:56,996
ba!

1382
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:59,191
Oh, my God!

1383
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:01,063
Oh, Nails, he's alive!

1384
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:04,228
Ooh, and he's gorgeous, too.

1385
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:06,033
Hubba-bubba, baby.

1386
01:36:06,072 --> 01:36:07,039
What do you think?

1387
01:36:07,073 --> 01:36:08,870
Ooh, you're a hero, Harris.

1388
01:36:08,908 --> 01:36:10,375
You saved the world.

1389
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:11,809
So what are you waiting for?

1390
01:36:11,844 --> 01:36:12,868
Come and get it.

1391
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:18,310
Ooh, Frankie...

1392
01:36:20,186 --> 01:36:22,711
so, did you do it
while you were back there

1393
01:36:22,755 --> 01:36:23,779
in the real world?

1394
01:36:24,991 --> 01:36:27,551
Did you do it
while you were real?

1395
01:36:27,593 --> 01:36:30,687
Do you ever think about
going back there so you can?

1396
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:33,631
There's no reason now.

1397
01:36:33,666 --> 01:36:35,930
Hey, boss, we got to go.

1398
01:36:39,605 --> 01:36:42,073
Get out of here!

1399
01:36:42,108 --> 01:36:43,735
l'm sorry.

1400
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,437
l'm so sorry.

1401
01:36:45,478 --> 01:36:47,002
l can't stand myself.

1402
01:36:47,046 --> 01:36:49,014
Oh! l should have
all eight legs.

1403
01:36:51,651 --> 01:36:52,640
Well, then,

1404
01:36:52,685 --> 01:36:57,088
we're just going
to have to stop pretending now,

1405
01:36:57,156 --> 01:36:58,521
aren't we?

1406
01:36:58,558 --> 01:36:59,547
Bum, bum, ba.

1407
01:37:06,632 --> 01:37:07,792
Bye-bye, folks.

1408
01:37:07,834 --> 01:37:09,699
Have a nice life.

1409
01:37:13,873 --> 01:37:15,135
What a beautiful landscape.

1410
01:37:15,174 --> 01:37:16,141
Let's see.

1411
01:37:16,175 --> 01:37:17,904
We can put the house
over here,

1412
01:37:17,944 --> 01:37:18,911
the studio over here.

1413
01:37:18,945 --> 01:37:20,242
l'll still draw, of course.

1414
01:37:20,279 --> 01:37:23,305
We'll raise children over here,
l'll fight crime over there.

1415
01:37:23,349 --> 01:37:25,817
Oh, we're going to be
deliriously happy, honey-poo.

1416
01:37:26,953 --> 01:37:28,853
Pencil dick.
