你把你自己弄哪儿来了 兄弟

别靠太近 博士

我不敢相信我做了什么
l can't believe what l've done.

94
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,040
我的斯派克本该把我送到你的世界里
My Spike was supposed to send me to your world,

95
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,200
而不是你到这儿来

这个人不危险

98
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,000
但是我们会变成真的
...but we will be.

99
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,440
你现在来到了一个全新的世界
You've come to a whole new world.

100
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,080
你做了一件非常非常不寻常的事情
You've done something extremely rare.

101
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,800
你看 你在一个叫做

102
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,760
幻世空间的地方

103
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,800
Hmm.

104
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,000
哦 怕生啊
Oh. How strange.

105
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,440
说“啊”
Say " ah."

106
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,280
啊
Ah.

107
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,800

But when it comes to making the trip in the body...

108
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,480
你听说建造工作室
Did you hear about the wolf

109
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,920
的狼吗
that built the studio?

110
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,880
不 没有 -我以前从没见过
-No, not...-...l've never seen it before.

111
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh!

112
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,600

对于你妈妈的事很抱歉

115
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,120
你又不是真的
You're not real.

116
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,040
吼吼 我们是真的 好吗
Oh-ho, we're real, all right.

117

我已经对里世界旅行的可能性

这个人不是你的
This man is not for you.

122
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,880
他又没有治安问题
He's not a police problem.

123
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,000
他是一个科学的秘密
He's a mystery of science.

124
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,480
一个将启的英雄
And a hero to boot.

125
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,760
我才不是英雄
l ain't no hero.

126
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,640
噢 别那么肯定 朋友
Oh, don't be so sure, friend.

127

打开那个洞之后
With this hole l've opened,

128
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,960
会有各种问题等着呢 哈哈
