[microphone thudding]

5
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:47,653
Hello.

6
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:49,655
And welcome.

7
00:01:49,822 --> 00:01:52,491
I'm Councilman Edmund Harris
of the Fifth District.

8
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,832
I'm sure some of you know
we're gathered here this afternoon

9
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:03,002
to dedicate the beginning
of a year-long project.

10
00:02:03,169 --> 00:02:07,715
To make a movie right here in Phoenix
and the outlying areas,

11
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:10,259
and much of it in our own Fifth District.

12
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:12,345
[audience applauding]

13
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:18,684
The Fifth District is the home
of our good friends, the Yeager family.

14
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:21,520
Warren, and Jeanette,
and cute little Lisa and Eric.

15
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:24,607
And they're gonna be
the stars of this unusual movie.

16
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:25,691
[audience murmuring]

17
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:28,235
- [man] Do you know who they are?
- [Harris] Wait a minute.

18
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:31,614
All of us in this room are gonna have
an important part in the picture too.

19
00:02:32,323 --> 00:02:34,950
Now, my wife tells me
I'm not handsome enough

20
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:37,370
- to be in the movies.
- [audience laughs]

21
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:40,498
But our guest of honor here today
says that's just baloney.

22
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:42,833
And he's the gentleman
behind the whole thing.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,627
Quite a gentleman he is.

24
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:46,545
Why, he's made me laugh on...

25
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,886
<i>The Tonight Show,</i> the late <i>Ed Sullivan.</i>

26
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:57,973
And I know you've seen his short films
on NBC's <i>Good Night Saturday.</i>

27
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,310
And a lot of you have seen him
on your favorite shows, I'm sure.

28
00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:05,106
And if you like the food we had today,
you have him to thank for that.

29
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:07,942
So would you please welcome
with a big Phoenix applause,

30
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:12,363
all the way from Hollywood, California,
Mr. Albert Brooks!

31
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:23,624
Thank you, Councilman Harris.

32
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,502
Please tell the mayor
I wish him a speedy recovery.

33
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:31,590
I couldn't help noticing
some expressions of shock or disbelief,

34
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:33,509
or whatever it was you were doing,

35
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:35,720
when the councilman mentioned
that the Yeagers

36
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:39,056
were going to be the stars
of a major motion picture.

37
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:42,560
I guess many of you know,
Warren Yeager is a fine veterinarian,

38
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:45,104
and not a professional actor.

39
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:47,064
But that's exactly the point.

40
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,902
We're all gathered here this afternoon
to film Warren and his family,

41
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:54,530
and you folks, and ourselves as well,

42
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:58,117
because we're making a movie
about reality.

43
00:03:58,284 --> 00:03:59,994
[all] Oh.

44
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:07,710
I'm sure you've all had the experience
of coming out of a motion picture theater

45
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:09,670
and saying to yourselves afterwards,

46
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:12,423
"I've had more interesting things
happen to me

47
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,176
than happened to those characters
in that picture.

48
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,887
My life is much more interesting."

49
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:20,848
Well, you know something? You're right.

50
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:23,350
The most hilarious comedy,

51
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:25,394
the most gripping drama,

52
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:28,397
the most suspenseful disasters,

53
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:30,816
they don't happen on the movie screen.

54
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:33,527
They happen in my backyard and yours.

55
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:35,154
[man] Yeah.

56
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:40,493
Thank you.

57
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,703
Thank you so much.

58
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,500
So, please, just remember two simple words
and everything will be perfect.

59
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,293
Be yourselves.

60
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,046
If you see one of our cameramen
following Warren or Jeanette

61
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:54,840
or one of the children
into your homes or your offices,

62
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:57,384
or cleaning establishments,
or gas stations,

63
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,220
don't try to do anything special.

64
00:04:59,762 --> 00:05:04,225
It's tempting to show off for the camera.
I know, I make my living that way.

65
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,769
But in this case, we don't want a show.

66
00:05:07,561 --> 00:05:09,104
Well, let me correct myself.

67
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:11,398
We want the greatest show of all.

68
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:12,483
Life!

69
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,734
[audience applauding]

70
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:16,987
Hey, you're great! You're great!

71
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:19,990
We're gonna have a b-a-double-I here,
I guarantee you.

72
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:24,495
Now, a lot of people have termed
this whole project an experiment,

73
00:05:24,662 --> 00:05:25,746
and I can't disagree.

74
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:30,709
And what experiment would be complete
without the scientists, hmm?

75
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:34,588
I'd like to introduce two of the finest
psychological consultants

76
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:36,257
that money can buy.

77
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,175
I wouldn't want you to get the impression

78
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:40,553
that we're buying
either of these gentlemen.

79
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,973
Actually, the one on the end is rented,

80
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:46,225
and the gentleman
sitting next to him is leased.

81
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:48,435
[audience laughing]

82
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:50,145
No, I'm kidding.

83
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:52,606
The gentleman on the end,
well, what can I say?

84
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:56,861
He's from one of the most prestigious
institutes we have in this country.

85
00:05:57,027 --> 00:05:58,112
From Boulder, Colorado,

86
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,364
from the National Institute
of Human Behavior,

87
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:02,199
would you welcome Dr. Howard Hill.

88
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:04,285
[audience applauding]

89
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:12,418
And the gentleman sitting next to him,
what can I say?

90
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:14,628
You might have seen him
on some television shows.

91
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:17,047
A well-known author. He's written books.

92
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:18,591
From the University of Minnesota,

93
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:21,552
please give a nice welcome
to Dr. Ted Cleary.

94
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:23,637
[audience applauding]

95
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,976
A lot of you probably thought
that Ted didn't stand up there.

96
00:06:29,143 --> 00:06:31,937
Actually, he is standing.
Isn't that great? He eats very little.

97
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:34,189
[audience laughing]

98
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:36,442
You folks love to laugh, don't you?

99
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:38,861
Well, more than anything else
in the world,

100
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:42,531
I'd love to get into some humor with you,
but we really don't have the time.

101
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:45,993
We're meeting the Yeagers at the airport
in less than half an hour.

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,330
So before yours truly
has to skedaddle on out of here,

103
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:52,666
I'd like, if I could,
to share my sentiments that I have

104
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:56,754
about this beautiful city with you,
if I might.

105
00:06:56,921 --> 00:06:57,880
Mort.

106
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:03,344
Ladies and gentlemen,
the man at the piano, Mr. Mort Lindsey,

107
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,220
from <i>The Merv Griffin Show.</i>

108
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:08,265
And as much of his orchestra
as we could afford to bring down.

109
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:11,644
Mort, if you will.

110

[Mort playing piano]

154
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:47,651
Hello.

155
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:50,904
You know, so many of us
go through life doing one thing

156
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:53,157
and dreaming of doing something else.

157
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:55,701
I'm one of those people.
I'm in show business.

158
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:58,704
I'm very fortunate to have that job,
but quite frankly,

159
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:01,748
if I'd studied harder,
or been graded more fairly,

160
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:05,669
I would have been a scientist
or a doctor of some kind.

161
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:08,839
Well, the fulfillment of that dream
finally happened for me

162
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:12,801
when I arrived here at the
National Institute of Human Behavior,

163
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:15,679
a few miles southwest
of Boulder, Colorado.

164
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:18,473
I knew from the inception
of this motion picture

165
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,184
that without scientific guidance

166
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,061
from a nationally recognized
research organization,

167
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:25,814
very few people would take this seriously.

168
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:28,025
However, with that guidance,

169
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:30,694
we not only had a chance
at winning an Oscar,

170
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:33,238
but possibly a Nobel Prize too.

171
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:36,909
Ooh. It gives me the chills.

172
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:38,243

Most important was the unusual agreement

that only the studio

This was done to reduce possible confusion

But to really heighten the reality,

246
00:15:40,902 --> 00:15:43,989
we needed a whole new generation
of motion picture equipment.

247
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:47,200
Equipment that could stay
out of our family's way.

248

341
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:05,185
<i>I'd find them.</i>

342
00:21:05,977 --> 00:21:08,938
<i>The rest of the crew
stayed here at the Travel Lodge.</i>

343
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:10,565
<i>A nice place.</i>

344
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:13,610
<i>But enough about the crew,
for at this very moment,</i>

345
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:16,988
<i>a 707 was landing nonstop from Haw All,</i>

346
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:19,115
<i>with our stars aboard.</i>

347
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:26,581
It's not degrading being introduced.
Howard, were you degraded?

348
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:28,583
There's such a thing
as professional dignity.

349
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,751
Why were you singing?

350
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:32,128
You were just supposed
to inform them of the project.

351
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:35,256
I did inform them.
What's so bad? They loved the song.

352
00:21:35,423 --> 00:21:38,176
I don't know about you, Howard,
but I didn't go to graduate school

353
00:21:38,343 --> 00:21:39,803
to be introduced as part of an act.

354
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:42,472
Howard, you've seen me work.
Tell him, that's not my act.

355
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:44,307
Ted, an act's a very detailed thing.

356
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:47,227
First, you got a set opening,
then you've got a four-minute hunk.

357
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:50,188
- A 10-minute hunk and a six-minute--
- [man] Mr. Brooks! Albert!

358
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:53,483
Someone knows me in Phoenix.
Hi. How are you? It's Warren.

359
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,485
- We're in baggage!
- We missed the plane.

360
00:21:55,652 --> 00:21:57,362
Great, good. We're coming!

361
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:59,364
I got mixed up myself.
I thought the plane...

362
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:00,990
Hey! Hello!

363
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:03,827
- We missed you!
- He barely knows me.

364
00:22:03,993 --> 00:22:07,163
Welcome home! Aloha! Look at this now!

365
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,207
Look at this. Real orchids.

366
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:14,003
Hello, Mrs. Yeager. And you.
Look at this. Come here.

367
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,923
Look at that. Okay!
Do we know everybody?

368
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,218
These are the Ettinauers.
I think you read the literature on them.

369
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:22,178
My two psychological consultants.

370
00:22:22,345 --> 00:22:25,598
They'll be with us for the entire year,
making sure everything is perfect.

371
00:22:25,765 --> 00:22:27,767
- Did you meet Howard?
- I don't think so.

372
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:29,727
Dr. Howard Hill, from the institute.

373
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:31,813
This gentleman's gonna be with us
for the year?

374
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,399
Yes. I won't be degrading.
I'll do it right this time.

375
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:37,861
Dr. Ted Cleary. I'm not a consultant,
I'm more of an observer.

376
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:41,865
I'm writing articles on this project
for <i>The Journal of American Psychology.</i>

377
00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:44,617
[Brooks] He's a very well-known author.
Written lots of books.

378
00:22:44,784 --> 00:22:47,287
You know who's gonna publish the articles?
Did you tell him?

379
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:49,455
- I did.
<i>- The Journal of American Psychology.</i>

380
00:22:49,622 --> 00:22:52,458
Maybe the most prestigious
scientific journal in the world, I swear.

381
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,503
You know who reads these things?
Jonas Salk, Buckminster Fuller,

382
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,672
William Buckley, every scientist living.

383
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,966
They go out to the mailbox,
get it like magazines.

384
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:02,343
We're all gonna be
on Jonas Salk's coffee table.

385
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,429
- All right!
- Can you believe it? He loves it!

386
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:07,557
Okay, one last thing,
then I'm staying out of your lives.

387
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:10,894
Limo back to the house, huh?
Just a special treat.

388
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,022
- Come on, let's go to the limo!
- Albert, I want to tell you something.

389
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:14,939
We went to Maui.

390
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:17,442
Jeanette didn't want to go,
but I told her...

391
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:20,445
Warren! What am I supposed to do?
Get this luggage myself?

392
00:23:21,112 --> 00:23:25,199
Excuse me one moment. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, really. Excuse me.

393
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:28,912
- I'm sorry. I'm a little excited, I guess.
- You're completely out of it.

394
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:30,955
- [Brooks] Come on! Come on!
- Okay!

395
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:32,707
- We got the whole crew waiting!
- Okay.

396
00:23:32,874 --> 00:23:34,334
Anyway, come on, honey.

397
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:40,840
[Brooks] Here we go!

398
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:53,770
Dr. Theodore Cleary!
Look at him, there he is!

399
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:56,147
- The Yeagers!
- [crowd whistling]

400
00:23:56,314 --> 00:23:58,691
You won't believe it.
Look, it's your parents.

401
00:23:58,858 --> 00:24:00,610
We flew them in from Tucson.

402
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:06,741
- [man] How are you? It's nice to see you.
- Aw. Nice to see you.

403
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:08,242
[Brooks] isn't this something?

404
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:11,204
Okay, very quickly.

405
00:24:11,371 --> 00:24:13,915
Oh, that's-- I love reunions.
Very quickly, folks.

406
00:24:14,082 --> 00:24:16,292
We want to meet the crew.
We lined them all up, okay?

407
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:18,127
We'll do it just like they meet royalty.

408
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:22,423
Now, Dr. and Mrs. Yeager, Eric, Lisa,
we'll just go down the line.

409
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,511
This is wardrobe, trucker, cameraman,

410
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:28,721
- first AD, second AD.
- What's an AD?

411
00:24:28,888 --> 00:24:30,890
Assistant director.
We'll get to it in a second.

412
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:32,684
- Another trucker.
- What are their names?

413
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,894
Not important.
Let me get through the whole list.

414
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:37,313
- Wardrobe, script.
- Script? Is there a script?

415
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,399
No, no, no. They're part of the package.

416
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:42,276
- Cameraman, another cameraman, grip, grip.
- How do you do? Hello.

417
00:24:42,443 --> 00:24:45,405
This is a trucker.
This is a gopher, this is a gopher.

418
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:46,823
[Eric] Where? Where? Where?

419
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,783
No, no, no, Eric. Eric, these people here.

420
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,743
It's a term, okay? How are you?

421
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:54,831
Publicity. This is a trucker, driver,
and a trucker. Okay?

422
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:57,041
There's other people.
They're not here right now.

423
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,627
Now, of course,
thanks to modern technology,

424
00:24:59,794 --> 00:25:02,630
these people really aren't needed,
but the union makes us take them.

425
00:25:02,797 --> 00:25:05,049
So, folks, we'll see you at the premiere.

426
00:25:05,216 --> 00:25:08,136
Have a nice time in Phoenix.
Enjoy your stay.

427
00:25:08,302 --> 00:25:10,054
- Well, thanks for coming.
- Get good tans.

428
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:12,098
- Bye.
- Nice to see you.

429
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:14,100
See you again. Nice to see you.

430
00:25:14,267 --> 00:25:16,185
Have a good stay. See you next year.

431
00:25:16,352 --> 00:25:18,771
Nice to see you. Okay?

432
00:25:18,938 --> 00:25:21,399
So, what can I tell you? Welcome home.

433
00:25:21,566 --> 00:25:24,277
You wanna film something of us
coming out of the car or anything?

434
00:25:24,444 --> 00:25:27,280
You kind of look tired.
Why don't you go in your house?

435
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:29,073
Make yourself at home, all right?

436
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,491
I wanted to go over the rules,

437
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:32,744
but we can do that
and the filming schedule later.

438
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:33,953
- Okay.
- You sure?

439
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,621
- He just said so, didn't he?
- Yeah.

440
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:38,583
Okay? So break a leg. Be yourselves.

441
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,960
- Thank you for everything.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

442
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:44,047
Hey, those leis keep.
Put them in the freezer. Okay?

443
00:25:44,213 --> 00:25:46,924
Have a good time now. Be yourselves.

444
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:48,051
They look great.

445
00:25:48,217 --> 00:25:50,428
They're great. They're great.

446
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:53,181
[Brooks] <i>They</i> were <i>great. What a family.</i>

447
00:25:53,723 --> 00:25:56,934
<i>The long trip from Haw All
did leave them a bit fatigued, however,</i>

448
00:25:57,101 --> 00:26:00,271
<i>especially Mrs. Yeager,
who thought she had a slight fever.</i>

449
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:04,067
<i>Although Dr. Yeager said it'd be all right
to film them unpacking,</i>

450
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:07,528
<i>I thought it was only appropriate
to give them an hour by themselves</i>

451
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:09,489
<i>to relax and get ready for dinner.</i>

452
00:26:11,032 --> 00:26:15,369
<i>I took the opportunity
to finish antiquing my end table.</i>

453
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,708
"Continuous motion for oldest effect."

454
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:25,463
<i>The hour passed very quickly.</i>

455
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,549
<i>And before I knew it,</i>

456
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:33,096
<i>we were ready to join them
for their first supper.</i>

457
00:26:41,562 --> 00:26:44,315
Eat your pizza, honey. Good pizza.

458
00:27:00,164 --> 00:27:02,333
Honey, do you think it's safe
for you to be eating

459
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,085
with your heating pad in your lap?

460
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,841
I have terrible cramps,
I am bleeding profusely,

461
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:11,634
and I wanna vomit on the table.

462
00:27:13,553 --> 00:27:14,887
[Jeanette] What are you doing?

463
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:19,267
No, I just wanna let them know
that this is not the way we usually talk,

464
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:20,977
especially at the dinner table.

465
00:27:25,565 --> 00:27:27,608
Okay, okay. Why don't we, uh...?

466
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:30,778
Why don't we just, uh,
pretend that we just sat down,

467
00:27:30,945 --> 00:27:33,406
and we can start over, okay?

468
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:40,037
Great pizza, right, kids? Kids?

469
00:27:40,204 --> 00:27:42,456
- I hate it.
- You hate it. [chuckles]

470
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,214
- [Lisa] Goddamn it, Eric.
- Watch your mouth, young lady.

471
00:27:50,381 --> 00:27:53,050
This is not the kind of language
we use at the dinner table.

472
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:55,678
Since when have we had all these rules
at the dinner table?

473
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:58,723
Lisa, don't use my good linen napkin
to wipe that up.

474
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,057
What am I supposed to use?

475
00:28:00,224 --> 00:28:03,603
- There are no other napkins in the house.
- There are too napkins in the house.

476
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:06,022
Honey, your mother's very uncomfortable,

477
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:09,108
so please, if you get smart with her
again, I'll have to punish you.

478
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:11,611
- Do you understand me, honey?
- I hate eating here.

479
00:28:12,111 --> 00:28:13,529
You don't have to eat here.

480
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,365
If you didn't, there'd be plenty
more food for the rest of us.

481
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:19,243
Don't start making her
feel guilty about the food.

482
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,078
God, you make me sick.

483
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:23,080
Just because I stick up for you?

484
00:28:23,956 --> 00:28:26,042
Eric, why don't you just leave the towel?

485
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:28,753
Wanna take your pizza into your room?

486
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,590
Honey, take your pizza into your room
and watch some TV, okay?

487
00:28:32,757 --> 00:28:33,799
[Eric] Okay.

488
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:36,302
Why does he have to finish his dinner
in the other room?

489
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:39,555
I just thought he could have
more fun eating there.

490
00:28:39,722 --> 00:28:41,182
Oh, he can't have fun here?

491
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:45,144
Honey, it's hard to have fun
when you have to listen to your mother

492
00:28:45,311 --> 00:28:47,563
whining about
her terrible menstrual cramps every day.

493
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,649
- Really, honey, every day.
- I agree.

494
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:53,027
And it is also not much fun
to have an IUD stuck in you

495
00:28:53,194 --> 00:28:55,404
to prevent, as you put it,
more mouths to feed.

496
00:28:57,114 --> 00:28:59,283
I-- Look, I never said that.

497
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,785
I don't care what you said.

498
00:29:00,952 --> 00:29:02,828
I am having this coil taken out Monday.

499
00:29:02,995 --> 00:29:04,830
And from now on, if you want safe sex,

500
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:07,208
you can have it with one of your animals.

501
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:12,505
I know you didn't mean anything by that,
so I'm not gonna say anything. I'm just...

502
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:16,217
You're just upset, the way everybody gets.

503
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:19,303
[door slams]

504
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:33,693
What a great day, huh?

505
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:36,320
Sounds real exciting over there,
doesn't it? [chuckles]

506
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:38,364
You been out spying on the neighborhood?

507
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:39,824
No, I'm not spying on anybody.

508
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:42,660
I live here. I'm allowed to walk
up and down the street.

509
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:45,454
What'd you think, Howard?
Real good action for Day 1, huh?

510
00:29:45,621 --> 00:29:48,207
- Real good.
- Well, tension, not action.

511
00:29:48,374 --> 00:29:49,709
Tension is action.

512
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,252
Don't you ever go to plays?

513
00:29:51,961 --> 00:29:54,171
What'd you think, Ted?
Some good insights for you?

514
00:29:54,338 --> 00:29:56,841
I'll tell you something.
If I were running this project,

515
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:58,884
those people
would've gotten some rest tonight

516
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:00,761
and Day I would've been tomorrow.

517
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:02,888
We all pretty much agreed at the meeting

518
00:30:03,055 --> 00:30:05,182
that when they got off the plane
was the beginning.

519
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:07,977
- Absolutely.
- We all agreed, but I disagreed.

520
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:11,314
Look, it's done. It's on film.

521
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,066
We gotta keep remembering,
whatever we do is fine,

522
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:15,860
it's perfect, it's the movie.

523
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:19,488
Oh, great. It may be fine and perfect,
but all that added tension

524
00:30:19,655 --> 00:30:22,325
is making your leading man
come off very unsympathetic.

525
00:30:22,491 --> 00:30:24,452
- What?
- That's only my observation.

526
00:30:24,618 --> 00:30:26,829
No, he's very sympathetic.

527
00:30:26,996 --> 00:30:29,915
If you don't look at it from
the dramatic point, you'll never see it.

528
00:30:30,082 --> 00:30:32,460
Here's a guy, he's got a wife, two kids,

529
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:33,961
he's threatened by society.

530
00:30:34,128 --> 00:30:36,088
- Oh, come on, now.
- No.

531
00:30:36,672 --> 00:30:39,675
On one hand, he doesn't wanna make
the same mistakes his parents made.

532
00:30:39,842 --> 00:30:42,678
On the other, he's not so sure
his parents made mistakes. He's torn.

533
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:44,847
Maybe he likes himself, maybe he doesn't.

534
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:47,308
Ooh, Jesus, I think it's a hell of
a complex character.

535
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:50,019
Don't you think so, Howard?
He's complex. Don't you think so?

536
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:53,064
- Albert, he's fine. Just relax.
- I am relaxed.

537
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,733
I just don't like my leading man
being called unsympathetic

538
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,693
on the basis of four minutes of film.

539
00:30:59,028 --> 00:31:01,697
He's good, huh? He's good.
He was good at the airport.

540
00:31:01,864 --> 00:31:02,740
- He was good.
- Yeah.

541
00:31:04,408 --> 00:31:06,786
On one hand he likes himself,
on the other, he doesn't.

542
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:08,287
Honey?

543
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:13,209
- Honey, what's the problem?
- There's no problem.

544
00:31:13,376 --> 00:31:15,169
I just don't like you very much right now.

545
00:31:15,336 --> 00:31:17,630
I'm sure that cramps
is a bad beginning for your movie,

546
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:20,508
- so I'm spending the weekend at Bonnie's.
- Honey, it's our movie.

547
00:31:20,674 --> 00:31:22,551
It was our decision.
You don't have to leave.

548
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:24,929
- What about the children?
- The children know.

549
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:27,723
Honey, listen, I'm sure they could film
your better moments.

550
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,559
- Warren, don't make me get in an argument.
- There's no argument.

551
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:33,145
After all,
they're paying for the whole family.

552
00:31:33,312 --> 00:31:34,397
I'll call you tomorrow.

553
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:37,525
Honey, you wanted this as much as I did.

554
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:39,235
You'll benefit from it too.

555
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,570
Warren, will you please...?

556
00:31:49,787 --> 00:31:51,539
- [engine starts]
- [Brooks] Let's move it!

557
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:52,873
Latch onto Jeanette.

558
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,918
Hello, Mrs. Yeager.

559
00:31:57,211 --> 00:31:58,212
Where you going?

560
00:32:01,215 --> 00:32:04,176
Listen, I would just like to go
be alone for a little while.

561
00:32:04,343 --> 00:32:07,638
- I think that I need to be alone now.
- Okay, could we come with you?

562
00:32:07,805 --> 00:32:09,473
No, I really want to be alone.

563
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,142
- Well--
- Just by myself.

564
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:13,227
We're gonna have to deal
with this thing later

565
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:15,563
because this really wasn't in the rules.

566
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:16,981
It's all right. Go ahead.

567
00:32:17,648 --> 00:32:19,316
Would you take the little car, though?

568
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:22,820
We're gonna drive to work with Warren.
We'd like to use the station wagon.

569
00:32:22,987 --> 00:32:24,405
[engine turns off]

570
00:32:24,572 --> 00:32:28,742
It's just hard to fit
both cameras in there.

571
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:30,536
- Could one person come with you?
- No.

572
00:32:30,703 --> 00:32:32,705
- One? That's all right. Go ahead.
- Please.

573
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:35,082
- I need to be by myself.
- Okay, I understand.

574
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:38,586
See, there's a lot of room in here,
if we just... One...

575
00:32:39,378 --> 00:32:40,963
[engine starts]

576
00:32:58,105 --> 00:33:00,274
Look, if you'd like to go
beyond the original year

577
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:02,401
to make up these days, it's okay.

578
00:33:02,568 --> 00:33:04,653
No, no, no. I don't think you understand.

579
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,031
There's no making up days.

580
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:09,617
I mean, this is the reality. This is it.

581
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:11,285
Now, she left. That's real.

582
00:33:11,452 --> 00:33:13,537
See, everything that happens, even us now,

583
00:33:13,704 --> 00:33:15,873
it's all the reality.

584
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,628
Very good. She came out angry like that,
got right in the car, you followed her.

585
00:33:20,794 --> 00:33:23,797
All very good stuff.
Very, very good. Really.

586
00:33:23,964 --> 00:33:27,426
So I should just go on
just living as usual?

587
00:33:27,593 --> 00:33:28,761
Mm-hm. That's it.

588
00:33:28,928 --> 00:33:30,763
Don't worry about anything.
You're very good.

589
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:32,348
Thanks.

590
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:36,477
[Brooks] <i>Warren Yeager tried to carry on
as if nothing had happened,</i>

591
00:33:36,644 --> 00:33:40,689
<i>but it was obvious he was uncomfortable
because of his wife's absence.</i>

592
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:42,816
[rock music playing on radio]

593
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:43,817
[Warren] Honey?

594
00:33:46,654 --> 00:33:48,572
Honey, the music goes
right into my bedroom.

595
00:33:48,739 --> 00:33:49,532
[radio clicks off]

596
00:33:49,698 --> 00:33:51,367
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

597
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:53,953
- I'm fantasizing.
- Don't fantasize.

598
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,914
I'm a big motion-picture star.

599
00:33:57,081 --> 00:33:58,999
These are my cameras.

600
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:01,085
That's my director.

601
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:03,754
- And you are my lover.
- Okay.

602
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:06,090
Kiss me, my beautiful lover.

603
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:08,175
Take me in your arms and kiss me.

604
00:34:08,342 --> 00:34:10,511
Take off the dress.
This is your confirmation dress.

605
00:34:10,678 --> 00:34:13,138
- How long we've been apart.
- Listen to what you're saying.

606
00:34:13,305 --> 00:34:16,559
Take me and kiss me
like you've never kissed me before.

607
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:19,895
Honey, come on. You're gonna get hit.
Get out of this dress.

608
00:34:20,062 --> 00:34:21,272
I can stay in this dress.

609
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:23,190
- Mother said I could.
- I'll bet she did.

610
00:34:23,357 --> 00:34:24,275
- Go ahead--
- She did.

611
00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:27,653
- Ask her if she ever comes back.
- Okay, come on. That's it.

612
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,197
- Honey, where's Eric?
- He's playing with the crew.

613
00:34:30,364 --> 00:34:32,366
He's not supposed to.
Didn't you tell him that?

614
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:34,785
No, I'm not his mother, remember?

615
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:36,745
Okay, don't get smart with me!

616
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:40,374
[sighs]

617
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:44,962
Cereal on the floor.
I'll just make breakfast now.

618
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:46,505
I'll make some eggs.

619
00:34:47,923 --> 00:34:51,135
Put this back. I'll make eggs.

620
00:34:52,595 --> 00:34:54,680
[Brooks] <i>On Sunday, Mrs. Yeager called me</i>

621
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:56,849
<i>and said she'd be coming home
that evening,</i>

622
00:34:57,016 --> 00:34:59,393
<i>but asked if she could
see me first, privately,</i>

623
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,687
<i>at the Desert Plaza Shopping Center.</i>

624
00:35:01,854 --> 00:35:03,897
So anyway, he says,
"You think that's bad?

625
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,649
Her sister's twice as fat."

626
00:35:05,816 --> 00:35:07,735
[cameraman laughing]

627
00:35:11,572 --> 00:35:13,198
Ah. Over here.

628
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:15,492
<i>The institute and I agreed
that private meetings</i>

629
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:18,037
<i>with any family members
should be discouraged,</i>

630
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:19,580
<i>but this did sound important.</i>

631
00:35:19,747 --> 00:35:20,497
[Jeanette] Hi.

632
00:35:21,624 --> 00:35:23,459
I was kind of hoping we could be alone.

633
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:25,085
This is alone.

634
00:35:25,252 --> 00:35:27,171
I mean, this is alone as I ever get.

635
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:30,132
- How was your weekend?
- It was okay. Listen,

636
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:31,800
thank you for giving me that time.

637
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:34,345
I know how important
the movie is to you, and...

638
00:35:36,305 --> 00:35:38,432
I'm sorry.
I know you didn't have to do it.

639
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,142
Don't worry about it. It's important.

640
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:43,103
I didn't have to do it,
but it's a decision, and I made it.

641
00:35:43,604 --> 00:35:45,105
It was a very loving decision.

642
00:35:45,272 --> 00:35:48,067
Oh, God, no. No love.

643
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:50,486
It's just a decision.
I'm making them all the time.

644
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:53,197
What's up? Why'd you want to meet me?

645
00:35:54,448 --> 00:35:56,575
I wanted to tell you that I like you,

646
00:35:57,117 --> 00:35:59,286
and that this movie
does mean as much to me

647
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:02,289
as it does to everybody else,
and I hope I didn't hurt anything.

648
00:36:02,456 --> 00:36:04,750
No, no. See, nothing can hurt it.

649
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:07,086
That's the beauty part of this film.

650
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:08,712
It is what it is.

651
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:11,757
It's like a movie in a movie in a movie.
You know what I mean?

652
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:14,551
Well, you were very sweet,

653
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:17,805
and I wanted to do something
for you in return.

654
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:18,972
Oh, don't.

655
00:36:19,973 --> 00:36:22,142
No, really, I want to.

656
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:25,187
I made an appointment with my gynecologist

657
00:36:25,354 --> 00:36:27,398
for a quarter to 10 tomorrow morning.

658
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,277
And if you want to, you and the crew
can feel free to join me.

659
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,322
Film the gynecologist?

660
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:38,492
Mrs. Yeager, I can't believe--

661
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:41,745
Oh, boy. Oh, yes. Great.

662
00:36:41,912 --> 00:36:43,789
Here's the problem.
There's one small problem.

663
00:36:43,956 --> 00:36:46,208
I won't shoot anything
that'll embarrass you, I swear.

664
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,794
I mean, I couldn't use it, anyway.
I'm locked into a PG.

665
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:51,797
No, I didn't mean anything like that.
No, it's Warren. I...

666
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:56,051
I haven't told Warren
that you're going with me,

667
00:36:56,218 --> 00:36:58,554
and I don't think
that anyone should tell him.

668
00:36:59,638 --> 00:37:01,932
See, this thing is so new to him,

669
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:04,476
and he's very nervous and edgy.

670
00:37:05,018 --> 00:37:08,605
I'm sure that in a month or two,
it would be fine, you know.

671
00:37:08,772 --> 00:37:10,899
But right now, he's a little upset.

672
00:37:12,276 --> 00:37:15,863
And since it wasn't planned, I just...

673
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:19,199
I think he would say no...

674
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:23,370
and we would just get
into another argument.

675
00:37:25,205 --> 00:37:28,041
[voice breaking] And I'm just real tired
of arguing with him.

676
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:32,296
Aw. Look. Go home.

677
00:37:32,796 --> 00:37:34,590
It's just, I don't know what's happening.

678
00:37:34,757 --> 00:37:38,343
He just doesn't seem to understand
anything at all anymore.

679
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,887
[crying]

680
00:37:41,513 --> 00:37:43,974
Mrs. Yeager, let me ask you a question.

681
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:47,728
Do you think he comes off unsympathetic?

682
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:48,812
Mm-hm.

683
00:37:49,271 --> 00:37:50,773
No. No, really.

684
00:37:50,939 --> 00:37:53,066
See if you can detach yourself
for a minute.

685
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:55,444
I mean, look at it
from the dramatic point.

686
00:37:55,611 --> 00:37:58,530
Here's a guy. He's got a wife, two kids.

687
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:00,282
He's threatened, you know?

688
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:01,784
Threatened by society.

689
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,952
On one hand, he's got the parental thing,

690
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:06,371
on the other hand,
he's got the pressures of his work.

691
00:38:06,538 --> 00:38:08,916
An audience has got to have
sympathy for a guy like this.

692
00:38:09,082 --> 00:38:10,751
He's a very complex guy.

693
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:13,003
Now, people have sympathy
for a guy who's complex.

694
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,963
Don't you think so?
Really, think about it.

695
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,966
- He is complex, isn't he?
- You're such a sensitive man.

696
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:20,260
Oh. No, no, no.

697
00:38:20,427 --> 00:38:22,513
It's just a theory. I'm not, no.

698
00:38:23,597 --> 00:38:27,643
Well, I want you to meet me
outside my doctor's building

699
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,770
at a quarter to 10 tomorrow morning.

700
00:38:29,937 --> 00:38:31,021
Okay.

701
00:38:31,188 --> 00:38:33,065
- Okay?
- Okay.

702
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:35,275
- I'm gonna go home now.
- Okay.

703
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:39,029
You gave me the strength. Thanks.

704
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:41,782
Oh. [spits]

705
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:43,951
I-- I didn't give you...

706
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:46,161
I gave you nothing, Mrs. Yeager.

707
00:38:46,328 --> 00:38:47,454
No, no. I gave you nothing.

708
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:50,082
Really, don't think I'm anything
better than what you have.

709
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:52,876
You think I've got this charisma,
but I don't.

710
00:38:53,043 --> 00:38:54,878
I really don't, Mrs. Yeager.

711
00:38:55,045 --> 00:38:56,672
It's just-- I have a little bit of it.

712
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:59,091
But it just sits on the surface.
It doesn't run deep.

713
00:38:59,258 --> 00:39:01,176
- Now, no kissing.
- Deeper than you think.

714
00:39:01,343 --> 00:39:02,553
I'll call you tomorrow.

715
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,681
Mrs. Yeager, it's been measured.
It doesn't run deep.

716
00:39:05,848 --> 00:39:07,891
Now, no kissing here.
I'm a shallow fellow.

717
00:39:08,058 --> 00:39:09,852
Look. Shallow, shallow.

718
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:12,813
Really! Shallow!

719
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:16,316
She didn't know. What am I gonna do?

720
00:39:16,483 --> 00:39:18,318
I didn't call this. I didn't do it.

721
00:39:21,905 --> 00:39:22,781
Let me just...

722
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:25,784
go out of frame this way.

723
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,623
All right, so during the examination,
basically, get her expressions.

724
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,958
Just very nice.

725
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:35,043
No, we're not gonna shoot
anything that will--

726
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,796
- Just perfect. Just like this, huh?
- I trust you.

727
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:39,214
No, don't. No trust.

728
00:39:39,381 --> 00:39:41,091
No, honestly. Shallow.

729
00:39:41,258 --> 00:39:42,843
- Just a decision.
- [nurse] Mrs. Yeager?

730
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,303
- These are just decisions.
- Yes?

731
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:47,180
- The doctor will see you now.
- Here we go. Tasteful. Taste.

732
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:48,223
Just remember.

733
00:39:49,558 --> 00:39:52,436
Uh, excuse me.
I don't think the doctor would like anyone

734
00:39:52,603 --> 00:39:54,438
other than the patient
in the examining room.

735
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:57,357
Oh. There's been a mistake, see?

736
00:39:57,524 --> 00:39:59,651
We're filming her life,
and we have her permission.

737
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:02,696
And someone from my crew was here
this morning and got a release.

738
00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:04,990
No, not today. You must be mistaken.

739
00:40:05,157 --> 00:40:06,909
No, I don't think I'm mistaken.
I'll check.

740
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:11,580
- Margaret, be with you in a few minutes.
- Okay.

741
00:40:11,747 --> 00:40:14,541
- Mrs. Yeager, how you feeling?
- Much better, thank you.

742
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,501
What is this? What are these?

743
00:40:16,668 --> 00:40:18,045
These are cameras.

744
00:40:18,211 --> 00:40:20,505
Oh, no. Oh, goddamn it!

745
00:40:20,672 --> 00:40:22,174
What's going on here? I was cleared!

746
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:23,967
- Come on, get out of here!
- No, no. Hey!

747
00:40:24,134 --> 00:40:26,637
- I don't need you here.
- Wait. This is a big motion picture.

748
00:40:26,803 --> 00:40:29,097
- I'm Albert Brooks.
- I don't care who the hell you are.

749
00:40:29,264 --> 00:40:31,558
Talk to my lawyer. I was cleared.
Get out. Out!

750
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:34,353
Dr. Rennert, these people are with me.
They're filming my life.

751
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:37,356
Sorry, but I've had some bad experiences
with the <i>60 Minutes</i> people.

752
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:40,943
No, we're not news. We're not digging.
I don't even ask any questions.

753
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:44,071
I'm just filming her,
and right now, you're in their life.

754
00:40:44,237 --> 00:40:45,322
They're in my life.

755
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:48,742
Mrs. Yeager, I'm getting awfully angry.
My blood pressure's starting to soar.

756
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:51,286
What do you want me to do?
You want them in here? Fine.

757
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:53,830
Then they can take out your IUD.
Two Thorazine, will you?

758
00:40:53,997 --> 00:40:56,041
You don't understand.
Wait, I know what he wants.

759
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:59,169
This isn't a student film.
What are we talking about?

760
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:00,837
Look. Huh?

761
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:03,340
There's four of us here, okay?

762
00:41:03,507 --> 00:41:05,717
He wants an abortion. All right?

763
00:41:05,884 --> 00:41:07,219
Two. Make it two.

764
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,347
I'll take a hysterectomy.
She'll have the same.

765
00:41:10,514 --> 00:41:13,558
How about this for parking?
You think 500 might do it?

766
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:16,478
I just wanna film her life.
Please, don't make trouble.

767
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:19,606
You're actually gonna give me $500
to film an examination?

768
00:41:20,232 --> 00:41:23,110
Oh, my God.
Maxwell Rennert, the baby broker.

769
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:26,321
- Goddamn it! Get out. I don't need this.
- I can't believe it.

770
00:41:26,488 --> 00:41:28,949
- Who is this man?
- Did you see Mike Wallace's piece on him?

771
00:41:29,116 --> 00:41:31,201
He sold children.
There were baby slave auctions.

772
00:41:31,368 --> 00:41:34,788
- One of the best <i>60 Minutes</i> ever.
- Wallace sent me a letter of apology.

773
00:41:34,955 --> 00:41:37,416
- I'll bet he did. Let's see it.
- It's being perma-plaqued.

774
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:41,461
Get out of here, goddamn it.
Go on, get out. Go on, out.

775
00:41:41,628 --> 00:41:43,296
- Get out.
- Just a minute.

776
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:45,924
[Brooks] This guy's nuts.
This guy's nuts. I want this!

777
00:41:46,883 --> 00:41:49,636
[Rennert] Look at me, my hands
are shaking like a 90-year-old.

778
00:41:50,387 --> 00:41:52,222
[snoring]

779
00:42:09,656 --> 00:42:12,117
[phone ringing]

780
00:42:12,993 --> 00:42:13,869
[coughing]

781
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:17,539
[phone continues ringing]

782
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:23,920
- [coughs] <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi. Did I wake you?

783
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:24,921
No.

784
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:29,176
I fell asleep for a minute.
I'm up, though.

785
00:42:29,926 --> 00:42:32,012
<i>How are you? How you feeling?</i>

786
00:42:32,596 --> 00:42:33,764
Not too well.

787
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,851
<i>Listen, Mrs. Yeager,
I'm very sorry about yesterday.</i>

788
00:42:38,018 --> 00:42:41,396
<i>Maybe somebody in the crew
could help you find another doctor.</i>

789
00:42:41,563 --> 00:42:44,274
<i>- What do you think?</i>
- No, that's okay. I'm not...

790
00:42:44,775 --> 00:42:46,651
- That's okay.
<i>- Oh, okay.</i>

791
00:42:46,818 --> 00:42:48,987
<i>Hey, it's a nice, sunny day out, huh?</i>

792
00:42:49,154 --> 00:42:51,490
<i>Is there any place to go
horseback riding around here?</i>

793
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:53,867
My grandmother had a stroke this morning.

794
00:42:54,034 --> 00:42:55,077
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

795
00:42:56,995 --> 00:42:58,330
That's terrible.

796
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,458
- How old is she?
<i>- Eighty-one.</i>

797
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:06,213
Well, that's very old.
I mean, that's almost 90.

798
00:43:06,755 --> 00:43:07,756
Did you tell Warren?

799
00:43:09,424 --> 00:43:10,801
No, not yet.

800
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:14,596
<i>Oh, Mrs. Yeager, you didn't call me first?</i>

801
00:43:14,763 --> 00:43:16,223
Yeah. [sniffles]

802
00:43:17,182 --> 00:43:20,519
Don't do that. Share this with him.

803
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:22,479
<i>I hope she'll be okay. I just...</i>

804
00:43:23,313 --> 00:43:25,690
Aw, she'll be all right.

805
00:43:25,857 --> 00:43:28,151
<i>I hadn't called in about three months.</i>

806
00:43:30,862 --> 00:43:33,198
- Honey...
<i>- I just...</i> [sobbing]

807
00:43:36,868 --> 00:43:37,702
Hi.

808
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:42,249
Gotta go. You cry it through, Mrs. Yeager.

809
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:44,167
Be alone. Share it with her husband.

810
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:47,003
- She called me. What are you writing?
- Just some notes.

811
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,297
Ted, she called me. What kind of notes?

812
00:43:49,464 --> 00:43:52,092
What happened to the effort
to stay out of their lives?

813
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:54,511
Ted, she called me.

814
00:43:54,678 --> 00:43:56,138
Ted doesn't understand.

815
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:58,640
Ted, Ted.

816
00:43:59,558 --> 00:44:00,600
Ted.

817
00:44:03,895 --> 00:44:06,648
Ted, look, I didn't do anything here.

818
00:44:07,649 --> 00:44:09,234
Look, it's only the first week,

819
00:44:09,401 --> 00:44:11,778
and she seems to be
relying on you quite a bit.

820
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:15,282
- What do you mean?
- Well, why didn't she call her husband?

821
00:44:15,448 --> 00:44:16,908
Well, ask her that.

822
00:44:17,534 --> 00:44:19,035
I'm not the Indian rubber man.

823
00:44:19,202 --> 00:44:21,621
My arm didn't slither across the street
and dial her phone

824
00:44:21,788 --> 00:44:22,914
and then snap back in.

825
00:44:24,332 --> 00:44:27,460
What, is the journal gonna print
I'm interfering because I took a call?

826
00:44:27,627 --> 00:44:29,462
I don't know what
the journal's gonna print.

827
00:44:29,629 --> 00:44:31,673
Ted, we've gotta lighten up here.

828
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,301
- Her grandmother had a stroke.
- Mm-hm.

829
00:44:34,926 --> 00:44:39,139
I'm just wondering if maybe
you're a little uncomfortable because...

830
00:44:40,015 --> 00:44:44,686
Well, you know, it's Phoenix,
and you're the only...

831
00:44:45,353 --> 00:44:48,273
Well, I mean, you know,
there's not a lot of...

832
00:44:49,107 --> 00:44:50,358
It's Phoenix. There's...

833
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:54,696
You know what I'm trying to say? You're...

834
00:44:56,156 --> 00:44:57,240
You're the only...

835
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,786
Albert, you have more trouble
dealing with a Black person

836
00:45:01,953 --> 00:45:03,997
than any white man I have ever met.

837
00:45:04,164 --> 00:45:05,957
[chuckles] I beg your pardon?

838
00:45:06,124 --> 00:45:09,252
Hey, Black meets white.

839
00:45:09,419 --> 00:45:10,879
Ted, I'm not trying to do anything.

840
00:45:11,046 --> 00:45:13,673
I'm just trying to tune in
on your particular level of anxiety.

841
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,425
- That's all.
- Boogety, boogety, boo!

842
00:45:15,592 --> 00:45:17,093
Ted, stop this taunting.

843
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,846
No, I'm not Black, nor do I claim to be.

844
00:45:20,013 --> 00:45:23,016
Yes, there's fears, misunderstandings,
and all that other mumbo-jumbo,

845
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:25,060
but they have nothing
to do with this project.

846
00:45:25,227 --> 00:45:28,104
I know more than anybody else
you people will take over the earth.

847
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:30,106
You're stronger, faster,
you use heat better.

848
00:45:30,273 --> 00:45:32,108
You've got the whole next century
wrapped up.

849
00:45:32,275 --> 00:45:34,778
I know about Africa. It's seething.
Boom, there it goes.

850
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:37,405
But it shouldn't stand
in the way of this film.

851
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:39,449
We're working as a team, Ted.

852
00:45:39,616 --> 00:45:41,868
We should put all that other stuff
on the back burner.

853
00:45:42,035 --> 00:45:46,289
[in Old South accent] Oh, yeah.
We can put all that on the back burner.

854
00:45:46,456 --> 00:45:49,501
Let me go in the kitchen
and check on the burner now.

855
00:45:50,335 --> 00:45:53,588
- [laughing]
- See, I find that insulting, Ted.

856
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,841
I find that insulting.
I never said you talk like that.

857
00:45:57,008 --> 00:46:00,011
That's why people like Jonas Salk
think comedians are jerks.

858
00:46:00,637 --> 00:46:02,847
Fine, he's writing that down.
I'll write it too.

859
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:05,350
"I never said that."

860
00:46:05,934 --> 00:46:08,812
Just get that down on paper.
Get a permanent record of that too.

861
00:46:08,979 --> 00:46:11,690
Date this. Now it's all permanent.

862
00:46:12,482 --> 00:46:15,735
That's not what you said.
You said this would be my scene.

863
00:46:15,902 --> 00:46:18,697
- Lisa, we don't have the time. I'm sorry.
- Albert!

864
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:21,032
I've gotta go. Larry, in here. Let's go.

865
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,494
- She's only getting confirmed once.
- Honey, it's an emergency.

866
00:46:25,078 --> 00:46:27,455
[Brooks] Good luck.
Wait. Wait for the guy.

867
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:33,753
Okay. All right, he's in. Let's go.

868
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,879
Bye-bye.

869
00:46:35,046 --> 00:46:37,424
- It's really not nice to break a promise.
- Wait a second.

870
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,510
Jeannette, honestly, this is Sunday.
I just don't have two crews.

871
00:46:40,677 --> 00:46:42,637
- But my dress!
- I'm filming your dress.

872
00:46:42,804 --> 00:46:44,222
Get a good shot of her dress.

873
00:46:44,389 --> 00:46:46,349
- This isn't fair.
- It's okay.

874
00:46:46,516 --> 00:46:49,060
If you have time, when you're finished,
come by the church.

875
00:46:49,227 --> 00:46:50,770
- [Warren] We will.
- [Brooks] Bye-bye.

876
00:46:50,937 --> 00:46:52,772
- You liar!
- Bye.

877
00:46:52,939 --> 00:46:53,982
[Warren] Bye-bye.

878
00:47:00,113 --> 00:47:01,823
I feel bad about letting her down.

879
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,367
No, don't worry. She's fine.
You made the right decision.

880
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:07,245
Maybe if you pull over,
I can get another crew. I'll make a call.

881
00:47:07,412 --> 00:47:09,247
I'm sure you did the best
you could, really.

882
00:47:09,831 --> 00:47:12,042
You haven't had an emergency
since we've been here.

883
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:15,128
- I haven't had one in six months.
- Really? This is exciting.

884
00:47:15,295 --> 00:47:16,421
Yes, it is.

885
00:47:16,588 --> 00:47:18,590
Don't worry, everything is under control.

886
00:47:18,757 --> 00:47:21,551
[Brooks] <i>Apparently, a beautiful
old show horse had a heart attack</i>

887
00:47:21,718 --> 00:47:24,179
<i>in the middle of a parade
in downtown Phoenix.</i>

888
00:47:24,346 --> 00:47:27,140
<i>Without an immediate
and delicate bypass operation,</i>

889
00:47:27,307 --> 00:47:28,725
<i>the horse wouldn't make it.</i>

890
00:47:28,892 --> 00:47:32,187
<i>Although Yeager had performed
this kind of surgery only once before,</i>

891
00:47:32,354 --> 00:47:36,024
<i>he expressed confidence,
and he put the horse's owner at ease.</i>

892
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,609
[whirring]

893
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:42,947
<i>At 11:30, preparation for surgery began.</i>

894
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,201
Take it up.

895
00:47:50,288 --> 00:47:51,164
Okay.

896
00:48:26,241 --> 00:48:27,158
[whirring stops]

897
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:31,704
[Brooks] <i>Things proceeded smoothly.</i>

898
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:35,208
<i>At 11:38, the horse was hooked up
to the artificial respirator.</i>

899
00:48:37,919 --> 00:48:39,921
[heart beating]

900
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:47,804
<i>The time was drawing near.</i>

901
00:48:51,266 --> 00:48:55,937
<i>At 11:41, Yeager and his assistants
had finished their preparation.</i>

902
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:57,730
<i>We were ready.</i>

903
00:48:58,481 --> 00:49:00,650
<i>You could feel the excitement in the air</i>

904
00:49:00,817 --> 00:49:03,611
<i>as Yeager ordered
the final dosage of anesthetic.</i>

905
00:49:03,778 --> 00:49:07,198
[Warren] Okay,
let's give him 2.5% halothane,

906
00:49:07,365 --> 00:49:10,285
and then give me
capillary refill time, please.

907
00:49:16,249 --> 00:49:18,251
[nurse] Two and a half percent.

908
00:49:19,294 --> 00:49:21,087
Refill time, one second.

909
00:49:21,254 --> 00:49:23,047
Good, that's good. Okay.

910
00:49:23,214 --> 00:49:25,383
Let's go over our final checklist,
and we're ready.

911
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:26,426
Respiration?

912
00:49:27,886 --> 00:49:29,554
- Six.
- [Warren] Good.

913
00:49:30,096 --> 00:49:33,475
Let me see, blood pressure now?
What was the blood pressure earlier?

914
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:35,393
One-ten over 60.

915
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,728
What do we have now?

916
00:49:38,354 --> 00:49:40,064
One hundred over 52.

917
00:49:40,231 --> 00:49:41,524
Perfect, that's perfect.

918
00:49:42,025 --> 00:49:44,819
Okay, let me see. Uh...

919
00:49:44,986 --> 00:49:46,738
Check pupil dilation.

920
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:49,908
Good. Okay.

921
00:49:51,493 --> 00:49:52,619
Color's good.

922
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:55,163
Let's check his pulse.

923
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,291
Okay. This is dressed properly.

924
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:01,669
- Pulse is 44.
- Good.

925
00:50:01,836 --> 00:50:04,005
- EKG?
- Normal.

926
00:50:04,172 --> 00:50:04,964
Okay.

927
00:50:05,131 --> 00:50:08,635
Uh, let's give him the anesthetic,
and we're on our way.

928
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:10,720
Two and a half percent halothane.

929
00:50:10,887 --> 00:50:12,722
You want another 2.5%?

930
00:50:13,431 --> 00:50:15,141
- Dr. Yeager?
- What?

931
00:50:15,308 --> 00:50:17,519
- Two and a half percent?
- Yes.

932
00:50:20,355 --> 00:50:22,398
[hissing]

933
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,363
- Dr. Yeager, that's 5% halothane.
- Five?

934
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,740
No, no, no. I said 2.5%.

935
00:50:30,907 --> 00:50:33,660
- I heard you order it twice.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

936
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:35,620
I couldn't have said that.
Two and a half percent.

937
00:50:35,787 --> 00:50:37,205
- You said it twice.
- Oh, no.

938
00:50:37,372 --> 00:50:39,749
That's too much. That's too much.
That's too much.

939
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:41,501
- [man] You ordered it.
- Oh, no. I did?

940
00:50:41,668 --> 00:50:44,254
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure. We got it on the film.

941
00:50:44,754 --> 00:50:45,922
Oh, my God.

942
00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:48,049
[rapid crackling]

943
00:50:48,216 --> 00:50:50,009
[Warren] Wait, don't panic.

944
00:50:50,176 --> 00:50:52,220
Don't panic. Do something.

945
00:50:52,387 --> 00:50:53,846
[rapid breathing]

946
00:50:56,724 --> 00:50:57,725
[breathing stops]

947
00:51:01,938 --> 00:51:03,106
We have no pulse.

948
00:51:04,566 --> 00:51:06,776
Two and a half
and two and a half makes five.

949
00:51:08,736 --> 00:51:13,199
[Brooks] <i>The operation was over at 11:45,
well ahead of schedule.</i>

950
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:15,743
Oh, no.

951
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,371
<i>Dr. Yeager took a short break,</i>

952
00:51:18,538 --> 00:51:21,207
<i>and then asked if he could see me
alone in his office.</i>

953
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:23,710
<i>Of course, I obliged.</i>

954
00:51:25,587 --> 00:51:28,423
- Quite an ordeal, huh?
- Yes, it was.

955
00:51:29,632 --> 00:51:31,843
Albert, I know we have an agreement,

956
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:34,387
and I probably shouldn't
even be asking you this,

957
00:51:34,554 --> 00:51:35,930
but I'd be rather embarrassed

958
00:51:36,097 --> 00:51:38,891
if what just went on in there
were included in this movie.

959
00:51:39,058 --> 00:51:41,394
It's not gonna do me
any good at all personally.

960
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:43,813
People in Phoenix
are gonna see this movie.

961
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,150
Hmm, I think you're overreacting.
I mean, I know what you're saying,

962
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:49,819
but I think it showed you
in a very good light.

963
00:51:49,986 --> 00:51:51,821
- It was very interesting.
- I appreciate that.

964
00:51:51,988 --> 00:51:53,740
But I'm gonna have
to continue to work here

965
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:55,533
after this film comes out.

966
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,120
And I don't know, if I owned an animal
and I saw me losing that horse,

967
00:51:59,287 --> 00:52:00,747
whether I would trust me. You know?

968
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:02,498
Yeah, but I wouldn't worry about it.

969
00:52:02,665 --> 00:52:06,002
You see, people go to doctors
for personal reasons,

970
00:52:06,169 --> 00:52:08,129
and you gave off something
very good in there.

971
00:52:08,296 --> 00:52:10,340
It seems like
you did everything you could.

972
00:52:10,506 --> 00:52:12,675
You just didn't know. You made a mistake.

973
00:52:12,842 --> 00:52:14,510
- I don't know.
- Everybody makes mistakes.

974
00:52:14,677 --> 00:52:16,512
I don't know if people
are that understanding

975
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:18,890
- when it comes to their own pets.
- I think they are.

976
00:52:19,057 --> 00:52:20,308
I've had people come to me

977
00:52:20,475 --> 00:52:24,062
because somebody else botched up
a broken leg on a dog, for example.

978
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,980
No, I think people are very understanding.

979
00:52:26,147 --> 00:52:28,775
They've been very bitter
about whomever they've been to before.

980
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:32,612
This is the worst possible advertising
a person like me could have.

981
00:52:32,779 --> 00:52:34,781
- You understand that?
- Well, I'll tell you what.

982
00:52:34,947 --> 00:52:37,200
- Don't worry about it now, okay?
- It's on my mind now.

983
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:40,286
Forget it now. As far
as you're concerned now, it's out.

984
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:44,916
You couldn't just sign something
to that effect, could you?

985
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:48,753
Mm, no. I mean, I could,
but then it's gonna be on my mind.

986
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:50,380
Hello?

987
00:52:51,047 --> 00:52:52,048
No one's in there.

988
00:52:52,215 --> 00:52:53,633
[dog barking]

989
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,801
Dr. Yeager?

990
00:52:57,303 --> 00:52:58,930
What the hell's going on here?

991
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:00,765
[dog continues barking]

992
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:04,143
Hello? Anybody home?

993
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,521
Could you at least give me
some kind of assurance

994
00:53:06,688 --> 00:53:09,524
that this won't be the only time
in the movie you'll see me working?

995
00:53:09,691 --> 00:53:12,443
I mean, can you show me
saving all those cats and dogs?

996
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:14,112
[Brooks] Come on, will you?

997
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:19,033
Remember the old saying,
"To err is human, to film divine."

998
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,576
No, it was very good.

999
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,001
- What happened?
- We lost her.

1000
00:53:29,168 --> 00:53:30,378
- You lost her?
- I'm sorry.

1001
00:53:30,545 --> 00:53:32,588
- How could you lose her?
- Look, I'm really sorry.

1002
00:53:32,755 --> 00:53:35,299
Don't you have people here
who stay with the animals?

1003
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:38,344
Let's get the damn hell out of here
and find her.

1004
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:47,186
[Brooks] <i>That was just the beginning
of what was to be a bad time</i>

1005
00:53:47,353 --> 00:53:48,980
<i>in the Yeagers' lives.</i>

1006
00:53:50,523 --> 00:53:53,025
<i>On Wednesday, Mrs. Yeager was informed</i>

1007
00:53:53,192 --> 00:53:55,987
<i>that her grandmother
passed away from the stroke.</i>

1008
00:53:56,154 --> 00:54:00,867
<i>The funeral took place two days later,
and we were graciously allowed to film it.</i>

1009
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:04,120
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

1010
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,832
Jesus said,
"I am the resurrection and the life.

1011
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:10,877
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead..."

1012
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:12,837
[whispering] I hate
to keep harping on this,

1013
00:54:13,004 --> 00:54:14,881
but I can't concentrate
on my work anymore.

1014
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:17,633
I mean, I shouldn't have killed
an animal that size.

1015
00:54:19,844 --> 00:54:22,221
This isn't the place.
We'll talk about it later.

1016
00:54:22,388 --> 00:54:25,641
Honey, this is the place.
I'm upset, you're upset.

1017
00:54:25,808 --> 00:54:27,602
What if he uses that scene?

1018
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:28,519
[clears throat]

1019
00:54:28,686 --> 00:54:32,356
Could you please stop talking
about the movie for just one minute?

1020
00:54:32,523 --> 00:54:34,776
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?

1021
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:37,069
Look up there. That's my grandmother.

1022
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:38,362
I realize that, honey,

1023
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:40,615
but what's gonna happen
when the kids go to school

1024
00:54:40,782 --> 00:54:44,035
and their friends say, "Hey,
did your dad really kill that horse?"

1025
00:54:44,202 --> 00:54:45,870
What are the kids gonna say?

1026
00:54:46,037 --> 00:54:48,206
What are the kids
gonna tell their friends?

1027
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:50,958
If I could have your undivided attention,

1028
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:54,086
I'm sure you'll feel better
after this is over.

1029
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,298
Let us pray. Almighty God...

1030
00:54:57,465 --> 00:54:58,883
[Brooks] <i>Things got worse.</i>

1031
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:01,844
<i>The following week was one of the most
depressing periods</i>

1032
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:04,096
<i>I had experienced since early childhood.</i>

1033
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:07,683
<i>The entire family was now grief-stricken.</i>

1034
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:11,771
<i>She with her grandmother,
he with the grandmother and the animal.</i>

1035
00:55:21,197 --> 00:55:23,449
<i>Day after day was the same.</i>

1036
00:55:25,451 --> 00:55:26,661
<i>Lifeless.</i>

1037
00:55:27,328 --> 00:55:30,998
<i>Dr. Yeager would sleep
sometimes for 18 hours straight.</i>

1038
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:36,254
<i>As a filmmaker, I was frustrated.
I wanted to help.</i>

1039
00:55:37,463 --> 00:55:39,882
- Dr. Yeager?
- [man on radio] <i>...from Stereo 106.</i>

1040
00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:42,385
<i>An exhibition of paintings

00:55:42,552 --> 00:55:44,345

1042
00:55:45,388 --> 00:55:46,806

[phone ringing]

1044
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:53,020
Hello?

1045
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:56,148
Jeanette? It's Albert.

1046
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:57,567
Hi.

1047
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:02,113
Listen, I know that you two
have been very depressed, and, uh...

1048
00:56:02,822 --> 00:56:04,699
Well, I've been avoiding you.

1049
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:08,077
I don't know if you're aware of it,
but I have for a couple of weeks,

1050
00:56:08,244 --> 00:56:10,663
because I didn't think
that we should be getting involved.

1051
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:14,208
<i>And now I'm beginning to think
that if I can help you,</i>

1052
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:17,086
<i>maybe you can help everybody else,
so, uh...</i>

1053
00:56:17,837 --> 00:56:20,590
What am I trying to say?
You wanna have dinner with me?

1054
00:56:20,756 --> 00:56:23,551
<i>- A snack? You wanna...?</i>
- Dinner?

1055
00:56:23,718 --> 00:56:25,219
<i>Well, I mean, look.</i>

1056
00:56:25,386 --> 00:56:28,389
I thought about that scene
that we had at the shopping center.

1057
00:56:28,556 --> 00:56:31,309
And it was a good scene.
It was good. It was nice action.

1058
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:34,770
And we talked, and that's more
than anyone else is doing right now,

1059
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:39,275
so, I mean, maybe,
I don't know, come on over.

1060
00:56:39,859 --> 00:56:42,028
Albert, I feel badly about that day.

1061
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:44,655
I'm still a little embarrassed about that.

1062
00:56:44,822 --> 00:56:46,949
I think
that what you said there was right.

1063
00:56:47,116 --> 00:56:49,368
- What did I say?
<i>- Remember, you said</i>

1064
00:56:49,535 --> 00:56:53,664
about you not being any better
than what I already have.

1065
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:55,374
I said that?

1066
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,627
I think that you were right.

1067
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:59,629
Oh, come on, get serious.

1068
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:01,172
I have to make this work

1069
00:57:01,339 --> 00:57:04,592
or I'm not gonna have any respect
for myself. You know what I mean?

1070
00:57:05,593 --> 00:57:09,013
I see. Okay.

1071
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:14,602
Aw, Albert, this has nothing to do
with you. It's between Warren and me.

1072
00:57:15,186 --> 00:57:16,812
You hate me, then, now, right?

1073
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:20,608
No, no, no. I think you're very nice.

1074
00:57:20,775 --> 00:57:23,486
<i>Nice. Okay, look,
you do what you have to do.</i>

1075
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:27,782
Just talk, though, see?
Work it out with language. It helps.

1076
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:29,241
Because I'm not D.W. Griffith.

1077
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:32,161
I'm gonna get in big trouble
if there's no dialogue.

1078
00:57:32,328 --> 00:57:34,789
- We will.
<i>- Okay. Promise?</i>

1079
00:57:34,956 --> 00:57:36,874
- It's going to get better.
<i>- Great.</i>

1080
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:39,126
<i>It didn't.</i>

1081
00:57:40,503 --> 00:57:41,671
<i>The following Saturday,</i>

1082
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:44,757
<i>Jeanette invited some friends
over for a barbecue.</i>

1083
00:57:46,175 --> 00:57:49,345
<i>She set the table, he set the mood.</i>

1084
00:57:54,934 --> 00:57:56,769
<i>I couldn't take it anymore.</i>

1085
00:57:56,936 --> 00:57:58,980
<i>I had decided that was it.</i>

1086
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:01,107
<i>These people had been depressed</i>

1087
00:58:01,357 --> 00:58:02,733
<i>- long enough.</i>

Oh, Lisa had a test. Where's Eric?

00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:23,963
- Went with Lisa.
- Oh.

Well, look.

1098
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:27,550
This was just a very serious attempt
to cheer everybody up.

1099
00:58:27,717 --> 00:58:29,635
But I needed the kids.
It was really for them.

1100
00:58:29,802 --> 00:58:32,513
- I'll come back when they're home.
- No, Albert, please come in.

1101
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,973
We're just talking here.

1102
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,599
- Please come in.
- But I did this...

1103
00:58:35,766 --> 00:58:38,894
- I'll come back when the kids are home.
- I understand, but please come in.

1104
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:41,147
- I really need to talk--
- Let me shower.

1105
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:44,734
- Albert, please.
- Okay, we'll come in. Okay, okay, okay.

1106
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,444
- Hi.
- Hi.

1107
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:48,029
No, I gotta go home. Come on.

1108
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:50,823
Albert, please. I'd really appreciate it.

1109
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:53,367
- Just sit down for a moment. Thank you.
- All right, okay.

1110
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:54,535
How are you?

1111
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,623
- You want a cup of coffee?
- No, no.

1112
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:03,210
Hi.

1113
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:09,759
Well, I'm sure you know that...

1114
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:12,219
we're upset.

1115
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:14,138
What, are you kidding me?

1116
00:59:14,305 --> 00:59:16,474
That's why I rented this whole outfit.

1117
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,725
"You didn't rent me."

1118
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:20,394
- Bunny, we're talking seriously now.
- Wait, Albert, wait.

1119
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:22,772
[Warren] I don't know too much about it,

1120
00:59:23,606 --> 00:59:26,901
but I feel like I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

1121
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:30,237
Oh. No.

1122
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:33,365
Don't act like that. Come on.

1123
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:36,952
The best thing you can do
is just to relax.

1124
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,872
See, when you feel this way, you clam up.

1125
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:41,290
That's no good.

1126
00:59:44,335 --> 00:59:47,838
I understand.
There's been a couple of deaths.

1127
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:49,548
So what?

1128
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:54,136
Look, I haven't gotten used
to this whole process myself.

1129
00:59:55,137 --> 00:59:56,597
I cried the other night.

1130
00:59:57,306 --> 01:00:00,142
- About what?
- I don't remember.

1131
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:03,687
See? I'm mixed up too.
I just don't clam up.

1132
01:00:06,107 --> 01:00:07,399
Look.

1133
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:09,527
There's a big meeting
at the end of this month.

1134
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:12,238
You know, with the institute
and the people from the studio.

1135
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:13,948
The one we're not invited to?

1136
01:00:14,115 --> 01:00:15,449
"I can't go either."

1137
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:16,742
That's right, he can't.

1138
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:19,411
Why don't I see if I can call it earlier?

1139
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:22,998
Maybe tomorrow or Wednesday,
if they can get down here.

1140
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:26,293
I don't know exactly what to tell you,
but these people do.

1141
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,462
They're scientists.
That's their business.

1142
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:32,424
If you'd listen to me, though,
I think you'd feel better.

1143
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:36,137
Just get it out. Don't internalize.

1144
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:39,557
Talk to anybody.
A neighbor. Talk to an animal.

1145
01:00:42,226 --> 01:00:43,144
Really, Warren.

1146
01:00:44,103 --> 01:00:44,979
Trust me.

1147
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:50,276
[Brooks] <i>We called the meeting
for Wednesday.</i>

1148
01:00:50,442 --> 01:00:52,570
<i>These monthly feedback and input sessions</i>

1149
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:55,281
<i>were crucial
to the success of this project.</i>

1150
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:59,076
<i>For the institute, this was the time
to provide analysis and guidance,</i>

1151
01:00:59,243 --> 01:01:01,245
<i>based on the footage they were viewing.</i>

1152
01:01:01,412 --> 01:01:04,748
<i>For the studio, this was the time
to discuss financial matters,</i>

1153
01:01:04,915 --> 01:01:08,085
<i>personnel problems,
and other cinematic details.</i>

1154
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:12,298
<i>This was Dr. Jeremy Nolan,
project coordinator for the institute,</i>

1155
01:01:12,464 --> 01:01:14,216
<i>an ambitious man.</i>

1156
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:18,888
<i>Dr. Anne Kramer, a good psychologist,
generally a nice person.</i>

1157
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,556
<i>I think she liked me.</i>

1158
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:24,143
<i>Dr. Hill was there, Dr. Cleary,</i>

1159
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:28,314
<i>and Martin Brand, the studio executive
in charge of this picture.</i>

1160
01:01:28,898 --> 01:01:32,818
<i>Brand took this project over
from a younger man who was fired.</i>

1161
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:36,739
<i>Martin was used to the old Hollywood
with its big stars and lavish sets.</i>

1162
01:01:36,906 --> 01:01:38,991
<i>He didn't know what we were doing here.</i>

1163
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:41,285
<i>I guess that's why
he felt it was unnecessary</i>

1164
01:01:41,452 --> 01:01:43,704
<i>to actually come to Phoenix.</i>

1165
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:48,417
So we've taken voiceprints
from Day 12 to Day 18,

1166
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:50,794
compared them against the prints
of these same people

1167
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:52,421
from the first week of the project.

1168
01:01:52,588 --> 01:01:55,674
And no matter which way we computed them,
they came out the same.

1169
01:01:56,258 --> 01:01:58,886
These people are definitely
operating differently now

1170
01:01:59,053 --> 01:02:00,304
than when filming started.

1171
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:02,848
There are changes
in all four voiceprint patterns.

1172
01:02:03,015 --> 01:02:04,308
And the extent of these changes

1173
01:02:04,475 --> 01:02:06,518
is confirmed by changes
in body temperature,

1174
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:08,729
as revealed
by the infrared analysis of the film.

1175
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:11,565
Each of us may have a different
explanation for what's going on,

1176
01:02:11,732 --> 01:02:12,733
but it's undeniable

1177
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,194
you've strongly altered
the reality you're filming.

1178
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:19,114
In my opinion,
you're getting a false reality here,

1179
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:21,325
and I don't know
what you're gonna do about it.

1180
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:24,536
Me? Wait a second.

1181
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:27,539
I'd like to get back to something
Anne said a little earlier.

1182
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:30,709
You said you think I look heavier now
than when the filming started.

1183
01:02:30,876 --> 01:02:32,503
Where would that be? In the cheeks?

1184
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:36,048
I said that in some of the later footage,
you look somewhat fatigued.

1185
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:38,175
- I see. That's all right.
- Not fat, fatigued.

1186
01:02:38,342 --> 01:02:40,844
I've been up a lot.
Fatigued is okay, but not heavy.

1187
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:43,389
I eat raw vegetables.
There's no reason I should--

1188
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:44,390
- Mr. Brooks.
- Yes?

1189
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:45,432
- You look fine.
- Okay.

1190
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,978
Now, I'd like, if we could,
to go to Day 4.

1191
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:51,438
I believe that's Scene 31.

1192
01:02:53,691 --> 01:02:57,695
Now, here's some footage
I'd like to show you.

1193
01:02:57,861 --> 01:02:58,696
Lights.

1194
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:00,281
What?

1195
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:02,616
- What did you say?
- Lights.

1196
01:03:02,783 --> 01:03:05,577
Oh. No. See, this is my home,
it's not a projection room.

1197
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:08,080
Say, "Would you turn the lights off?"
I'd say, "Sure."

1198
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:11,542
"Lights," he says.
Man lives in the kitchen?

1199
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:14,461
Uh...

1200
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:17,756
Now, we've blown up
what I wanna show you,

1201
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:21,510
and I'm gonna keep repeating it
because it's hard to catch the first time.

1202
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:24,471
In fact, the computer didn't catch it
till the second run.

1203
01:03:24,638 --> 01:03:26,307
When we started filming Warren Yeager,

1204
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:28,851
he was drinking coffee
with his right hand only,

1205
01:03:29,018 --> 01:03:30,686
no assistance at all from his left hand.

1206
01:03:30,853 --> 01:03:32,980
As distinctive a trait as handwriting.

1207
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:36,233
Now watch again. Right hand only.

1208
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:39,820
That's it.

1209
01:03:41,655 --> 01:03:45,242
Now, on Day 13,

1210
01:03:46,118 --> 01:03:48,787
he starts drinking coffee
with both his hands.

1211
01:03:48,954 --> 01:03:53,250
Now, watch the decision. There.
Now watch again.

1212
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:54,168
[Brooks] What?

1213
01:03:55,294 --> 01:03:56,545
Watch the decision.

1214
01:03:57,296 --> 01:03:58,756
There. See?

1215
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:01,425
He's much less reliant
on his entire right side.

1216
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:02,551
[Brooks] Oh, come on.

1217
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:05,054
[Kramer] Yes, it's conceivable
that within two months,

1218
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,639
he will have shifted the cup
entirely to his left hand,

1219
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:11,477
and his right hand will remain unused
throughout the entire gesture.

1220
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:13,645
[Nolan] Mm-hm.
Total change in body language.

1221
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:15,189
Lights.

1222
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:23,280
Very interesting.
I hadn't noticed it at all.

1223
01:04:23,447 --> 01:04:26,116
Wait a minute. This cup could've been hot.

1224
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:28,410
Nope. The infrared analysis of the film

1225
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:31,538
shows no difference
in the effective temperature of the dish.

1226
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:34,833
[Brand] <i>Albert, may I interrupt
for one minute, please?</i>

1227
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,336
<i>People aren't gonna walk out
of a theater saying,</i>

1228
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:41,131
<i>"I don't like that guy who holds
the cup with one hand, with two hands."</i>

1229
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:42,174
Absolutely.

1230
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:44,676
<i>I'll tell you what they do have
a good chance of saying.</i>

1231
01:04:44,843 --> 01:04:48,597
<i>"Where the hell is Paul Newman?
Where's Redford? Where's Nicholson?"</i>

1232
01:04:48,764 --> 01:04:49,765
- Jesus.
<i>- Believe me,</i>

1233
01:04:49,932 --> 01:04:53,268
<i>they'd prefer Nicholson with the cup
than the cup with the other guy.</i>

1234
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:55,396
<i>Albert, so you keep the Yeamens,</i>

1235
01:04:55,562 --> 01:04:58,107
<i>but you gotta get somebody
in the movie, for Christ's sake.</i>

1236
01:04:58,273 --> 01:05:00,067
<i>You maybe ought to add
a next-door neighbor,</i>

1237
01:05:00,234 --> 01:05:01,485
<i>or a boss, or a cleaning lady.</i>

1238
01:05:01,652 --> 01:05:04,196
<i>Somebody with a name.
Somebody who'd draw some people.</i>

1239
01:05:04,363 --> 01:05:05,948
<i>You've got rock friends.</i>

1240
01:05:06,115 --> 01:05:09,660
<i>Would it be so bad to have Neil Diamond
sitting at a meeting like this?</i>

1241
01:05:09,827 --> 01:05:12,538
<i>Schmuck, you'll make a hell of a lot
more money with Neil Diamond</i>

1242
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:13,997
<i>than with the guy with the cup.</i>

1243
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:17,167
Can we get back on the track?
I need someone to get that cup for me.

1244
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:20,254
Stop with the cup.
Really, I can't hear this anymore.

1245
01:05:20,421 --> 01:05:23,507
I don't know what you're talking about.
Explain to me in English, please.

1246
01:05:23,674 --> 01:05:27,886
Quite simply, the filming has triggered
a drastic emotional change

1247
01:05:28,053 --> 01:05:29,304
in these people's lives.

1248
01:05:29,471 --> 01:05:32,099
They don't know how to deal with it,
and you don't know either.

1249
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:33,225
And that's bad?

1250
01:05:33,392 --> 01:05:36,353
I don't live in a world of good and bad.
I don't talk that language.

1251
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,440
We're building a lot of conclusions
on a little bit of evidence.

1252
01:05:39,606 --> 01:05:41,775
Maybe what these people
are going through is growth.

1253
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:44,987
- Maybe it's inevitable and healthy.
- Absolutely right. Howard's right.

1254
01:05:45,154 --> 01:05:48,365
Excuse me.
I would like to hear from Dr. Cleary.

1255
01:05:48,532 --> 01:05:51,368
- You really wanna know what I think?
- Yes, please.

1256
01:05:51,535 --> 01:05:52,411
Okay.

1257
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:57,374
One, we get out of these people's lives.
We must get out of this house.

1258
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,418
- Wait a minute.
- I'm not through.

1259
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:03,839
We go away at night.
We film only when scheduled.

1260
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:05,757
We give them some privacy and stability,

1261
01:06:05,924 --> 01:06:09,428
so that when they wake up in the morning,
they don't think they're on a movie set.

1262
01:06:09,595 --> 01:06:12,806
A movie set. Martin, tell him
how different this is from a movie set.

1263
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:15,434
[Brand] <i>On a movie set,
you got actors that are well-known.</i>

1264
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:16,643
<i>If they give you trouble,</i>

1265
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,937
<i>you call their agents
and put heat under their ass.</i>

1266
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:21,899
Thanks. Ted, there's no reason
to get out of this house.

1267
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:25,444
I spent a lot of money in purchasing it,
and in decorating it. It's unnecessary.

1268
01:06:25,611 --> 01:06:28,071
- It is very necessary.
- It's not necessary.

1269
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:30,115
You know how difficult it is
to get wallpaper?

1270
01:06:30,282 --> 01:06:33,535
- How difficult is it to get wallpaper?
- It's very difficult. This is Phoenix.

1271
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:36,705
We're talking about people's lives,
you're talking about wallpaper.

1272
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:39,750
You know you spend
80% of your life looking at walls?

1273
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:42,044
- Gentlemen, please.
- [indistinct arguing]

1274
01:06:42,211 --> 01:06:45,964
- I had to send to L.A. for that wallpaper!
- The reason why you moved...

1275
01:06:46,131 --> 01:06:47,382
Wait a minute.

1276
01:06:47,549 --> 01:06:50,928
May I please make a suggestion
that might break this logjam?

1277
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:52,471
- Mr. Brooks, please.
- What?

1278
01:06:52,638 --> 01:06:55,182
Right. The institute has
a center up in the foothills

1279
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:57,643
that's used for encounter
and therapy sessions,

1280
01:06:57,809 --> 01:06:59,436
mainly for our executives and clients.

1281
01:06:59,603 --> 01:07:02,356
I think we should consider taking
the Yeagers there for a weekend.

1282
01:07:02,523 --> 01:07:03,774
I think they'll open up again.

1283
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:06,735
Oh, yes. You mean like Echelon?
Like hot tubs?

1284
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:08,654
- Nature trails, massage.
- Absolutely.

1285
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,532
See? That's something I can use.
Great, thank you.

1286
01:07:11,698 --> 01:07:14,201
Are you crazy? You wanna fly
all these people to Colorado?

1287
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:16,537
- What?
- Just put them all on drugs.

1288
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:18,080
Get them psychiatrists.

1289
01:07:18,247 --> 01:07:20,332
Enroll them in private schools
while you're at it.

1290
01:07:20,499 --> 01:07:22,000
[Brand] <i>Just a minute. We got a budget.</i>

1291
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:25,671
<i>Remember the costs, Dr. Clearson.
Please remember the costs.</i>

1292
01:07:25,837 --> 01:07:30,592
Oh, yeah, costs. You spend
a half of a million dollars on research.

1293
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:35,222
I don't think you've spent a dime finding
a qualified person to head this project.

1294
01:07:36,682 --> 01:07:39,142
You've got someone
at the controls of a 747

1295
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:41,061
who's never even flown as a passenger.

1296
01:07:41,228 --> 01:07:42,854
<i>That was</i> Airport '76.

1297
01:07:43,021 --> 01:07:45,482
Ted, I think I've logged more miles

1298
01:07:45,649 --> 01:07:47,985
than you
and your entire university put together.

1299
01:07:48,151 --> 01:07:49,861
- You're missing the point.
- I'm not.

1300
01:07:50,028 --> 01:07:52,906
I'm a million-miler. I'll show you my pin.

1301
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:56,326
I get into any VIP lounge in this country.
I knock, I tell them my name,

1302
01:07:56,493 --> 01:07:58,412
give them the PIN number,
I sit in the lounge.

1303
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:01,665
I can have coffee and donuts,
without even flying anywhere.

1304
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:04,126
How many people do you know
who can just go down

1305
01:08:04,293 --> 01:08:07,129
to an airport lounge and say,
"Let me in, please, I just wanna sit"?

1306
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:08,922
I can do that, Ted, in O'Hare Airport.

1307
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:11,133
I've taken a date there before,
after a movie.

1308
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,011
Just had coffee in the lounge,
and I wasn't even flying anywhere.

1309
01:08:14,177 --> 01:08:16,430
- Missing your point.
- Albert, Albert.

1310
01:08:16,597 --> 01:08:19,349
Ted, come on.
I feel what we need now is a break.

1311
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:21,435
- I'm starving. Can we eat?
- Great idea.

1312
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:23,812
I know a great Mexican-like restaurant.
I'll treat.

1313
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:26,231
Come on, we're just getting
all cooped up here.

1314
01:08:26,398 --> 01:08:28,442
[Brand] <i>All right, Albert,
I'm gonna hang up now.</i>

1315
01:08:28,609 --> 01:08:31,194

01:19:04,494 --> 01:19:08,039
It's Mr. Brooks! And don't threaten me!
I work better under pressure!

1471
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:09,165
Get out!

1472
01:19:15,546 --> 01:19:18,633
It's fine. Go back. Have a good breakfast.

1473
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,135
I'll be across the street.
I'll take a shower.

1474
01:19:22,637 --> 01:19:24,055
[Brooks] <i>The shower didn't help.</i>

1475
01:19:24,222 --> 01:19:26,140
[horn honking]

1476
01:19:27,308 --> 01:19:28,351
[man] Dr. Yeager!

1477
01:19:28,518 --> 01:19:30,937
[Brooks] <i>The media stayed away
from the Yeagers' house.</i>

1478
01:19:31,104 --> 01:19:33,940
<i>However, off their property,
they were fair game.</i>

1479
01:19:34,607 --> 01:19:36,776
<i>It started on Monday afternoon.</i>

1480
01:19:36,943 --> 01:19:38,236
<i>While coming home from lunch,</i>

1481
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:41,906
<i>Dr. and Mrs. Yeager encountered
a Live Eye truck.</i>

1482
01:19:42,448 --> 01:19:45,994
It won't take long. Come on.
We heard those awful things about it.

1483
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:49,122
- I'm sorry. Excuse us.
- Please. Come on, talk to us.

1484
01:19:50,748 --> 01:19:52,458
Dr. Yeager!

1485
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:55,044
- [horn honking]
- Mrs. Yeager!

1486
01:19:55,211 --> 01:19:56,337
[Brooks] <i>Tuesday afternoon.</i>

1487
01:19:56,504 --> 01:19:59,507
Wait, Mrs. Yeager. Are they hurting you?

1488
01:19:59,674 --> 01:20:01,592
[Brooks] <i>While returning
from a shopping spree,</i>

1489
01:20:01,759 --> 01:20:03,886
<i>Mrs. Yeager and the children
were accosted.</i>

1490
01:20:04,053 --> 01:20:06,431
Lisa, Eric. No, please...

1491
01:20:06,597 --> 01:20:10,184
<i>You'd think the news would have
something better to do in this big city.</i>

1492
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:13,313
No comment at this time. Leave us alone.

1493
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:15,148
How are your children holding up?

1494
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:18,192
- Everything is fine. Please.
- How old are your children?

1495
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:21,195
Dr. Yeager, a couple of words.
Can you take just a second?

1496
01:20:21,362 --> 01:20:23,448
Doctor? What are they doing to you?

1497
01:20:23,614 --> 01:20:25,450
Are they trying to hurt you
and your family?

1498
01:20:25,616 --> 01:20:27,243
Look over here, Dr. Yeager.

1499
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:29,787
- Are they hurting you?
- Doctor, give us a minute.

1500
01:20:29,954 --> 01:20:32,040
- Dr. and Mrs. Yeager.
- No comment.

1501
01:20:32,206 --> 01:20:34,042
Why did you come to see this film?

1502
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:35,626
Please, please.

1503
01:20:35,793 --> 01:20:38,338
- Can you tell me this?
- No comment on the film?

1504
01:20:38,504 --> 01:20:41,257
- Will you see the second feature?
- Kids, don't say anything.

1505
01:20:41,424 --> 01:20:43,676
- Were you forced to see this movie?
- Over here.

1506
01:20:43,926 --> 01:20:46,220
Albert, some members
of the institute board...

1507
01:20:46,387 --> 01:20:50,767
[Brooks] <i>An emergency meeting was called
for 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, the 25th.</i>

1508
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:55,021
<i>It was requested by the head of the
National Institute of Human Behavior,</i>

1509
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:57,482
<i>Dr. Isaac Steven Hayward.</i>

1510
01:20:57,648 --> 01:21:00,234
...an entirely a new field
of psychological--

1511
01:21:00,401 --> 01:21:03,237
[Brooks] <i>And approved by Martin Brand,</i>

1512
01:21:03,404 --> 01:21:06,991
<i>who considered this meeting
important enough to call from Catalina,</i>

1513
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:10,036
<i>interrupting the first vacation
he'd had in over a week.</i>

1514
01:21:10,203 --> 01:21:11,454
Albert, we're known in Europe.

1515
01:21:11,621 --> 01:21:13,706
[Brooks] <i>As I sat across the table
from this man,</i>

1516
01:21:13,873 --> 01:21:17,418
<i>I was slowly losing my respect
for higher education.</i>

1517
01:21:17,585 --> 01:21:20,505
<i>Also, he wore far too much cologne.</i>

1518
01:21:20,671 --> 01:21:23,216
When you have a reputation
in as difficult a field as this,

1519
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:24,759
you've got to maintain it.

1520
01:21:24,926 --> 01:21:26,636
And you think something's going on here

1521
01:21:26,803 --> 01:21:28,971
preventing you
from maintaining your reputation?

1522
01:21:29,138 --> 01:21:30,556
I have no opinion.

1523
01:21:30,723 --> 01:21:31,599
[scoffs]

1524
01:21:31,766 --> 01:21:34,143
But we've done a great many tests
in the last five days.

1525
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:38,189
Everything from public opinion surveys
to urinalysis of our own staff.

1526
01:21:38,356 --> 01:21:40,066
Fine. What do the tests tell you?

1527
01:21:40,233 --> 01:21:44,654
They indicate to us that our efforts here
have come to the end of their useful life.

1528
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:47,824
Anything beyond this point
would be severely counterproductive.

1529
01:21:48,741 --> 01:21:52,412
I see. Now it's becoming clear.

1530
01:21:52,578 --> 01:21:54,872
The institute gets a little heat,
and boom,

1531
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:58,042
they not only leave the kitchen,
they take the whole kitchen with them.

1532
01:21:58,209 --> 01:21:59,544
Let's consider the family.

1533
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:01,796
What'd you do?
Run urine tests on them too?

1534
01:22:01,963 --> 01:22:03,881
We did a series on them, yes.

1535
01:22:06,092 --> 01:22:09,595
Thanks, Howie.
Hope you didn't get your little hands wet.

1536
01:22:09,762 --> 01:22:11,806
[Brand] <i>Come on. Jesus Christ!</i>

1537
01:22:11,973 --> 01:22:15,268
These people are very close
to complete personality disintegration.

1538
01:22:15,435 --> 01:22:16,769
Oh, don't make me laugh.

1539
01:22:16,936 --> 01:22:20,982
I don't remember when I haven't been close
to complete personality disintegration.

1540
01:22:21,149 --> 01:22:23,276
And how would you know
what they're feeling anyway?

1541
01:22:23,443 --> 01:22:24,652
From your Mickey Mouse tests?

1542
01:22:24,819 --> 01:22:26,654
Don't blame the tests
for what they tell us.

1543
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:30,575
I don't blame them. They're great.
Why don't we do more, huh? More tests?

1544
01:22:30,741 --> 01:22:31,909
I bet you'd like it, Nolan.

1545
01:22:32,076 --> 01:22:34,245
Wanna get that cup again?
I'll get you lots of cups.

1546
01:22:34,412 --> 01:22:37,206
Maybe a hundred cups.
I'll tell you something about you people.

1547
01:22:37,373 --> 01:22:41,085
You're great with cups,
but what you don't have are balls.

1548
01:22:41,586 --> 01:22:45,381
Ask any magician, he'll tell you that
cups without balls doesn't mean jack shit.

1549
01:22:45,548 --> 01:22:48,468
[Brand] <i>Albert, what the hell
are you talking about?</i>

1550
01:22:48,634 --> 01:22:49,886
<i>Look, let's not argue.</i>

1551
01:22:50,052 --> 01:22:52,930
<i>Say the family's fine.
Say the family's perfect.</i>

1552
01:22:53,097 --> 01:22:56,142
<i>Let's talk about you for a minute.
Look what you've done.</i>

1553
01:22:56,309 --> 01:22:59,270
<i>You failed, that's what you did.
You schmuck, you failed.</i>

1554
01:22:59,437 --> 01:23:02,273
<i>You started out
with this artsy-craftsy reality crap,</i>

1555
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,816
<i>but what did you end up with?</i>

1556
01:23:03,983 --> 01:23:06,235
<i>The news! The goddamn news!</i>

1557
01:23:06,402 --> 01:23:07,945
<i>People get that for free.</i>

1558
01:23:08,112 --> 01:23:11,115
<i>You think somebody's gonna hire
a babysitter, take a taxicab,</i>

1559
01:23:11,282 --> 01:23:14,118
<i>go all the way the hell downtown,
go up to the box office,</i>

1560
01:23:14,285 --> 01:23:17,622
<i>shell out four bucks and say,
"Here! Here's my four dollars!</i>

1561
01:23:17,788 --> 01:23:19,499
<i>What time does the news go on?"</i>

1562
01:23:19,665 --> 01:23:23,878
"Here. Here's my four dollars."
ls money your entire life, Martin?

1563
01:23:24,045 --> 01:23:27,507
Money! Money! Let's talk about
human beings for a minute.

1564
01:23:27,673 --> 01:23:31,511
Across the street are four people.
These people had a dream.

1565
01:23:31,677 --> 01:23:34,597
They took on a project.
It was new, it was exciting.

1566
01:23:34,764 --> 01:23:37,808
And it was supposed to go a whole year,
not two months.

1567
01:23:37,975 --> 01:23:41,354
I'm in show business. I'm used to
my commitments being dumped on.

1568
01:23:41,521 --> 01:23:44,815
But these people are ordinary people
with ordinary feelings.

1569
01:23:44,982 --> 01:23:46,943
You wanna go across the street
and tell them?

1570
01:23:47,109 --> 01:23:49,153
No, you won't even come down here!

1571
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,822
Do you wanna take that responsibility? No!

1572
01:23:51,989 --> 01:23:54,242
I think they know more
than you give them credit for.

1573
01:23:54,408 --> 01:23:58,538
- Look who's talking. The pee hoarder.
- [doorbell rings]

1574
01:23:59,956 --> 01:24:01,541
Someone should answer the door.

1575
01:24:02,124 --> 01:24:04,752
Why? Why not take a urinalysis of it?

1576
01:24:04,919 --> 01:24:09,215
We'll know who it is without going there.
Isn't that a great idea? Come on, Nolan!

1577
01:24:09,382 --> 01:24:13,594
More data! More data! We need more data.
Come on, Dr. Cup! More data!

1578
01:24:13,761 --> 01:24:16,639
More data, huh?
Get some data for me! More data!

1579
01:24:16,806 --> 01:24:20,309
More data! More data! We need more, more.

1580
01:24:20,476 --> 01:24:21,352
Hi.

1581
01:24:21,519 --> 01:24:24,188
What a breath of fresh air.
Please, come in.

1582
01:24:26,232 --> 01:24:30,319
Here are your tests, your living tests.

1583
01:24:30,945 --> 01:24:34,282
Dr. and Mrs. Yeager,
I'm in the communications business.

1584
01:24:34,448 --> 01:24:36,242
It's my job
to get through to these people.

1585
01:24:36,409 --> 01:24:38,286
But I don't think
I'm doing very good at it.

1586
01:24:38,452 --> 01:24:41,872
I don't think they understand the meaning
of the word "commitment,"

1587
01:24:42,039 --> 01:24:43,833
the word "dedication."

1588
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,876
Maybe you can explain it to them.

1589
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:51,674
We wanna stop.

1590
01:24:52,842 --> 01:24:53,676
What?

1591
01:24:53,843 --> 01:24:56,012
- This is over.
- No.

1592
01:24:56,178 --> 01:24:58,764
I don't wanna get into
more of your intellectual arguments.

1593
01:24:58,931 --> 01:25:01,726
This is ruining our lives.
This is not what we bargained for.

1594
01:25:01,892 --> 01:25:04,186
There was no bargaining.
You applied, we accepted.

1595
01:25:04,353 --> 01:25:06,647
Albert, the children are afraid
to go to school.

1596
01:25:06,814 --> 01:25:09,984
- That's normal, trust me.
- I don't care what you think is normal.

1597
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:12,194
We no longer want
to be involved in this project.

1598
01:25:12,361 --> 01:25:15,323
- That's final. That's it.
- This was the whole family's decision.

1599
01:25:15,489 --> 01:25:16,699
I'll bet it was.

1600
01:25:16,866 --> 01:25:19,660
- I'm sure Eric got a full vote.
- We're not gonna discuss this.

1601
01:25:19,827 --> 01:25:22,997
Okay, wait, no discussion.
Just a few facts and loose ends.

1602
01:25:23,164 --> 01:25:27,418
$25,000. More than half your money
was due on the completion of this picture.

1603
01:25:27,585 --> 01:25:29,295
I don't think this is the end.

1604
01:25:29,462 --> 01:25:31,130
You'll have to go without the boat,

1605
01:25:31,297 --> 01:25:34,800
the trailer you've been talking about
for a couple of months, and Lisa's braces.

1606
01:25:34,967 --> 01:25:37,136
I know about teeth.
She may look all right now.

1607
01:25:37,303 --> 01:25:39,096
In three years,
she'll be an elephant girl.

1608
01:25:39,263 --> 01:25:41,182
These come right down to her waist.

1609
01:25:41,349 --> 01:25:45,061
Also, if something, God forbid,
really bad happens, you have no insurance.

1610
01:25:45,227 --> 01:25:48,564
You're not in the Screen Actors Guild.
You have no coverage, no benefits.

1611
01:25:48,731 --> 01:25:51,025
[Brand] <i>Stop it!
With what they've been through,</i>

1612
01:25:51,192 --> 01:25:52,860
<i>we should pay them and forget about it.</i>

1613
01:25:53,027 --> 01:25:55,404
Okay, we'll forget about it.

1614
01:25:55,571 --> 01:25:59,116
Go ahead, take the money.
I wanna get the family I wanted to choose.

1615
01:25:59,283 --> 01:26:01,786
- What was their name, the one I wanted?
- The Feltons.

1616
01:26:01,952 --> 01:26:04,622
The Feltons, Wisconsin!
That's the heart of this country.

1617
01:26:04,789 --> 01:26:08,584
Here's what I say. We all take a week off.
I'll get a high colonic.

1618
01:26:08,751 --> 01:26:12,088
Then we'll come back with a new family,
a bigger institute--

1619
01:26:12,254 --> 01:26:13,589
[Brand] <i>And another studio.</i>

1620
01:26:13,756 --> 01:26:16,050
<i>We're not spending another dime
on this picture!</i>

1621
01:26:16,217 --> 01:26:17,885
<i>You're nuts to want to do this again.</i>

1622
01:26:18,052 --> 01:26:20,513
Don't call me nuts! You're nuts!

1623
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,098
<i>- You're nuts!</i>
- You're nuts!

1624
01:26:22,264 --> 01:26:24,892
<i>- You're nuts!</i>
- You're nuts! You're nuts!

1625
01:26:25,059 --> 01:26:27,269
<i>- Oh, you schmuck. You're nuts!</i>
- You're nuts!

1626
