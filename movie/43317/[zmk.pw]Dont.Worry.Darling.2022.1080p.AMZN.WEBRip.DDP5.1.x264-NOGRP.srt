That's right. That's good.

Yeah, I will pour myself...

00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:44,511
Peg, focus.
Look at me and stay focused.

16
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:45,980
- Bunny...
- Right here, baby.

17
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,849
What are we seeing,
what are we seeing?

18
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:51,451
I'm trying to focus!

19
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,386
- Not too hard, peg.
- I'm trying to focus!

20
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,956
The tassels
are weighing you down.

21
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,958
I think you gotta lose them
and take them off!

22
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,192
Take the shirt off!

23
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,903
I have it, I have it,
I have it, I have it.

24
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,028
Focus. Right here.

25
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,263
Tip it a little bit.

26
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,530
Oh!

27
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,166
That's not fair!
Peg made her drop it!

28
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,868
That doesn't count.

29
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,669
Winner, winner,
cigarette dinner!

30
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,839
That wasn't my fault! Hang on.

31
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,817
- That is my drink.
- No, she pushed it off my head.

32
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,675
- I'll finish that.
- No, but I can win.

33
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,444
She just budged me.
It's not fair!

34
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,745
I know you can win.

35
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:19,923
- Mm-Kay. Are you sure?
- I know you can...

36
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,449
Mm-Kay. Yeah.

37
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,485
- You dropped it,
or was it my fault?
- It got on my dress.

- What?

00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,305
Because if it gets on the rug,
it's impossible to get out.

Pete, your wife is drunk.

She's babbling
nonsense right now.

46
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:40,634
And she's pregnant,
and so she needs another drink,

47
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,802
get that baby healthy.

48
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,337
She should think about the baby!

49
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,307
- Excuse me, excuse me!
- Whoa!

50
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:48,118
Did this come with
the promotion? You see this?

Frank did a ceremony.
It's just like the one he has.

53
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,547
-So gracious.
-Look at this.
Look at this man.

54
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,117
Kiss the ring, baby.

55
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,753
This doesn't get into bed.

Oh, my god.
Look at... look at this love!

57
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,834
Are you going
to kiss me right now?

00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,226
- Yeah, is that...
- Mwah!

60
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,900

67
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,388
You want to go for a ride?

68
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:40,127
I'm slipping out of the car!

69
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,030
Oh, my god!

70
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,332
You have to drive.

71
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,133
It's your turn. Take the wheel!

72
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,568
-Take the wheel!
Take the wheel!
-Oh, my god! What?

73
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,195
- No, I'm not ready!
- I've driven us...

74
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,505
- Oh, my god!
- I've driven us
more than enough.

75
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,175
Alice, you're getting
so much better.

76
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,143
I am. I feel better.

77
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,878
You're getting so much better.

78
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,546
Take me home, Alice.

79
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,815
Take me home.

80
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,216
What if you're blind?

81
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,651
- No, I can't!
- Now do it. Now do it.

82
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,887
You're doing so good!
You're doing so good!

83
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,100
- All right, now straighten up.
- Can you help me?

84
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,524
Straighten up.

85
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,695
Good job.

86
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:27,174
So then bunny said
that she wanted to play,
which, mm...

87
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,276
She's never
played tennis before, ever.

88
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,846
She has a cocktail in one hand,
a racket in the other,

89
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:35,383
and, Jack...
She didn't spill a drop.

90
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,318
It was...

91
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:41,055
Quite possibly the sexiest
thing I have ever seen.

92
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:42,522
<i>I want to see you
in a tennis skirt.</i>

93
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,758
God...

94
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,194
Do you think it's true
that frank actually has

95
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,829
a tennis court at his house?

96
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,232
- We'll find out, won't we?
- Yeah.

97
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,235
Oh, and babe, tell me...

98
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,405
How many people
are gonna be at this party,

99
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,974
because I need to know
how much tuna salad to make.

100
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,343
Mm.

101
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,445
- What?
- Frank doesn't like tuna.

102
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:06,414
- What?
- He doesn't like it.

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,849
- Are you being serious?
- Mm-hm.

104
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,451
Baby, why didn't you tell me?

105
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:12,953
I was planning on it being
the centerpiece to my dish.

106
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,456
- Alice, not the centerpiece.
- Shut up.

107
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,159
Oh, no! Shit.

108
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,133
Don't.

109
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,567
- Was that a big drill?
- Don't.

110
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,136
- Was that an explosion?
- Don't.

111
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,981
- Are those
the progressive materials?
- Mm-hm.

112
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:32,940
You can tell me. I'm...
I'm really discreet.

113
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,351
- I can keep a secret.
- I'm going to be late.

114
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,986
No, wait, you... you can't...
You can't leave.

115
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,777
Why not?

116
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,646
'Cause you're not feeling well.

117
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,248
- Oh, I'm not?
- Yeah, I'm so sorry.

118
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,160
I forgot to tell you, but
you're not feeling very well.

119
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:45,953
And the only way to cure it
is if we stay home all day,

120
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,489
and I tend to you
and kiss you and cook for...

121
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:50,124
- Mm-hm.
- No.

122
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:51,826
- Bye.
- Okay.

123
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:56,729
Oh... Jack, wait!

124
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,733
Bye-bye. Make us proud.

Peter made me swear
not to tell anyone.

165
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,672
So they're gonna build a whole
new row of houses behind us,

166
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,941
so we'll be much closer to town.

167
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:50,044
- Really? Wow.
- Mm-hm.

168
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,979
So wait, how does that make you
closer to town?

169
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,515
We won't be furthest from town.

170
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:26,981
Good morning, ladies.

171
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,816
Good morning, shelley.

172
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,385
I have some very exciting news.

173
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:35,089
The victory project has hired
a new employee, bill Johnson,

174
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,092
and I've invited his wife
to join us today.

175
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,527
Everyone, please give
a warm welcome...

176
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,795
To Violet Johnson.

177
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,665
Welcome, Violet.

178
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:55,209
Let's begin. First position.

179
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:58,946
Remember, ladies,
there is beauty in control.

180
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:03,083
There is grace in symmetry.
We move as one.

181
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,015
Stomach in.

182
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,417
Chin up.

183
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,121
That's it.

184
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,897
Yeah, of course
Margaret wasn't in class.

185
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,799
I saw Dr. Collins
at their house again.

186
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,033
No!

187
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,444
Honestly shocked
Ted still has a job.

188
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,470
- Again?
- Unwrap it from her neck, Fred!

189
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,205
- Yeah.
- Oh, my god.

190
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,673
- Poor guy.
- Oh! I met her.

191
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,841
- Mm!
- The new wife.

192
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:01,909
Violet.

193
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,377
- Mm-hm.
- What's she like?

194
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:06,246
She's like a beautiful,
terrified, baby deer.

195
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,949
Yeah. Apparently,
the husband's a real goober.

196
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,018
Well, Jack better
recruit somebody soon.

197
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:13,120
Please! Dean says Jack's
about to get promoted.

198
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:14,288
- I hope so.
- Mm-hm.

199
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:15,824
You're gonna be right behind us.

200
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,000
What are you making
for the party?

201
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,325
- My deviled eggs.
- Oh, my god.

202
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,027
Jack's gonna be ceo.

203
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:21,862
Hold this, please. That's it.

204
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,297
- I'm calling Santa.
- Uh-oh.

205
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:24,732
- You give me no choice.
- Oh, no.

206
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,200
I have to call him. I have to!

207
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,968
That's why Santa
gave me his number.

208
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,512
He said I had to call
if you were bad.

209
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,372
I'm calling him.
I wish I had a choice.

210
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,140
- Give me that.
- But we stopped!

211
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:34,742
- Give me that. No.
Give it to me!

that song.

- What is it?
- I don't know.

258

I was hoping you could tell me.

259
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,796
It's been stuck in my head
for days.

260
00:13:49,864 --> 00:13:51,608
Maybe it's a children's song.
Something your kids sing?

Oh, no, I don't have children.

262
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,702
- Oh.
- Mm. Don't get me started.

263
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:58,472
It's just not what we want.
We're having fun.

264
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,608
I live next door. You wouldn't
believe the things I've heard.

265
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,311
It's like they're on
a perpetual honeymoon.

266
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:06,613
No, Jack and Alice
only have time for each other.

267
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,348
It's not what we want.

268
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,259
Plus, bunny's kids
like me more than her, anyway.

269
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,618
That's true, it's infuriating.

270
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,255
I think three
is a perfect number.

271
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:18,291
Bill wants four.

272
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,494
Well, once you have one,
it's all the same.

273
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,496
Having a second...

274
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,834
Alice, how many babies
should Violet have?

275
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:28,368
Oh, at least seven.

276
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:07,041
Christ. Where have you been?

277
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:08,843
I've turned avoiding
talking to other people

278
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,477
into an olympic sport.

279
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:12,722
- This place is incredible!
- You haven't seen half of it.

280
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,691
I could sleep in their bathtub
and they'd never find me.

281
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,017
I'm sure! Hi!

282
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:17,384
Hey!

283
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:18,953
May we interest you
in a cocktail?

284
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,223
- Uh, yes, you may. Thank you.
- Yes, very interested.

285
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:27,829
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

286
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:29,596
Thank you.

287
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:32,200
- They terrify me.
- They're so creepy.

288
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,767
I feel like they
sleep upside down.

289
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:35,675
- Do they wear matching outfits
every day?
- Oh!

290
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:38,438
That little weirdo
makes the best Manhattan
I've ever had.

291
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:39,941
We honeymooned in sea island.

292
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,575
Oh!

293
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,610
- What?
- We honeymooned in sea island.

294
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:44,578
Seriously?

295
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:45,856
Yeah, did you eat at Dominick's?

296
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,882
I was a little nervous.

297
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:49,516
Took a while
to get used to things.

298
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,418
Yeah. It takes a minute
to settle in.

299
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:53,286
- Yeah.
- But it gets easier, though.

300
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,355
- It does. Yeah.
- Well, it...

301
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,824
I'm just really excited
to be here.

302
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:58,634
- So excited, I can't even...
- We couldn't tell.

303
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,162
To be honest, I've been
out of it since we arrived.

304
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:02,596
Yeah.

305
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,841
- Bill says it's the jetlag.
- Mm-hm.

306
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:05,732
It's all just been
a bit of a blur.

307
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,567
It's the desert air.
You'll get used to it.

308
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,603
That's what
Dr. Collins said, too.

309
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,107
He was so sweet to stop by.

310
00:16:13,174 --> 00:16:14,450
- And, Jack, you're...
- -I'm a technical engineer.

311
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,010
She should come shopping
with us.

312
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:17,821
A different department
than, uh, Dean and Ted.

313
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:19,722
Yeah, technically a worse,
less important department.

314
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,883
I haven't really gotten
to talk to frank very much.

315
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:24,886
Frank doesn't have to talk
to you.

316
00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:25,963
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...

317
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:28,388
You have no idea
how extraordinary he is.

318
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,158
Or what he can do.

319
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:31,501
You're lucky to even know
who he is,

320
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,127
let alone be standing
in his house.

321
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:36,496
I'm just excited. I'm sorry.

322
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:39,332
I was just excited. Okay.

323
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:43,180
- Oh! Guys, guys, guys.
Go, go, go, go.
- Ooh, here we go.

324
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:46,207
- This way?
- Yeah, you should go in front.

325
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,349
Gather 'round, everyone.

326
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,587
Now, usually,
we don't have the opportunity

327
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,824
to welcome couples in our home.

328
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,960
But on this occasion,
we just couldn't wait

329
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:09,096
to celebrate
our newest residents.

330
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:11,464
Bill, Violet...

331
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,534
I am so happy for you,

332
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,703
that you get to learn
from my husband...

333
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,273
And join this mission

334
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,408
and become a part
of this family.

335
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:27,614
Frank has built something
truly special.

336
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:32,419
What he's created out here,
it's...

337
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:33,988
It's a different way.

338
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:36,958
A better way.

339
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:40,094
- And we only have each other...
- Why are we here?

340
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,564
Let's go, right now.

341
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,969
We shouldn't be here.

342
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:54,275
What was that?

343
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:55,775
Now, now.

344
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:03,918
Margaret and Ted are
going through a difficult time.

345
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:11,558
Margaret's question is right.
It is the good question to ask.

346
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,962
Why the hell are we here?

347
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:22,769
Why, when this landscape
can seem so...

348
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:27,008
Barren, so hard, so dusty, so...

349
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:30,477
Worthless?

350
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,747
Why not run?

351
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:35,782
Why not go back to safety,
status quo,

352
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,718
where it's safe,
where we should be?

353
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:44,457
No, I choose...
We choose to stand our ground.

354
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:45,592
Right?

355
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:49,997
To look harder, to dig deeper.

356
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:54,268
To mine that pure,

357
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,839
unbridled potential.

358
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:05,212
That gem of limitless
and unimaginable value.

359
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:10,851
It's just too easy to get
distracted by what seems.

360
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:15,056
Much more difficult, "braver,"
I would say...

361
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,626
To search for what could be.

362
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,231
- Dean...
- Hm?

363
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:28,102
What is the enemy of progress?

364
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:30,770
- Chaos.
- Yes.

365
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,977
Nasty word. Chaos.

366
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:40,580
Merciless foe, that chaos.

367
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:44,617
Energy unfocused,
innovation hindered,

368
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,487
hope strangled,
greatness disguised.

369
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:50,757
I see greatness
in each one of you.

370
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,525
I know exactly who you are.

371
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,264
- What are we doing?
- Changing the world.

372
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:00,001
- What are we doing?
- Changing the world.

373
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,169
That's right.

374
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:05,106
I look around, I see
another reason why I'm here.

375
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:09,576
Once unfamiliar faces,
strangers, one and all, now...

376
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:12,645
One brave family.

377
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,215
Men like Dr. Collins.

378
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,549
One of our first, who built
this community with me.

379
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:19,320
Thank you,
Dr. Collins for your vision.

380
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:23,924
And adventurers like bill,
our newest intrepid explorer.

381
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:26,193
This brave,
young Robinson crusoe,

382
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,263
who's choosing to join us
on this adventure.

383
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,698
Bill, thank you
for being our partner in this.

384
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:37,104
And thank you, Violet,
for being his partner in this.

385
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:39,073
He could not do this
without you.

386
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:41,775
All of you wives...

387
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:45,779
We men, we ask a lot.

388
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:49,716
We ask for strength,
a shoulder to cry on...

389
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:52,920
Food at home, a house cleaned,

390
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:55,622
and discretion, above all else.
And that...

391
00:20:57,858 --> 00:20:59,559
That's very difficult.

392
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:07,501
You are my rock.

393
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,103
I would not be here without you.

394
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:11,771
Thank you.

395
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:20,647
You're all dismissed.

396
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,456
<i>♪ Baby, baby, baby... ♪</i>

397
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:29,890
Jack?

398
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,098
Jack?

399
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:47,141
- Margaret.
- They're hiding me in here.

400
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,210
Oh, give us a second, Alice.
She'll be fine.

401
00:21:49,844 --> 00:21:51,278
I'm not fine.

402
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:53,547
Nothing is fine.

403
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:57,284
- She just needs to sleep.
- I don't sleep.

404
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:59,286
I have bad dreams.

405
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:00,988
Uh...

406
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:04,058
<i>♪ I wanna love ya

407

409
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:22,843
What are you doing?

410
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,179
I wonder why I chose this tie.

411
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:37,958
I like your ties.

412
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:57,710
No.

413
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:59,779
There are so many
people outside.

414
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,781
Jack, there are so many people.

415
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:04,251
There are so many
people outside.

416
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:02,742
Wow him in a doubles game.
He'll 40-love this look.

417
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,078
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

418
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:05,778
Can you charge that
to Dean's account?

419
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:08,315
I still can't believe
we can just charge, everywhere.

420
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:10,017
Yes, but victory has things

421
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:11,585
- money can't buy.
- Mm-hm.

422
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:13,063
It's true, you don't have to
worry about the weather

423
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:14,521
or learning to drive. Ugh.

424
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,023
- I love driving.
- No.

425
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,825
You love Jack
teaching you to drive.

426
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:19,526
That's foreplay.

427
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:22,563
Circle back to the guest list.
Were Kathy and Bob at frank's?

428
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,198
- I think so.
- Really?

429
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:26,233
Wow, so it just seems
very random, right?

430
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,502
Who is invited and who isn't.

431
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:30,904
It has nothing to do
with seniority, or success,

432
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:32,473
or even being well-liked, right?

433
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:35,876
Splish-splash. Who's ready
to dive into summer?

434
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:37,544
- Charge that.
- Hideous.

435
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:41,048
- I heard Margaret made a scene.
- Oh, my god.

436
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:42,359
Threw a drink in someone's face?

437
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:44,752
What? No.
That did not happen.

438
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,520
She was upset.

439
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:49,156
It was humiliating,
and she's gonna get Ted fired.

440
00:24:49,223 --> 00:24:50,557
Oh.

441
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:52,293
If Peter got fired...

442
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,360
I'd kill myself.

443
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:54,995
Not kidding.
Can't live anywhere else.

444
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:57,765
Margaret is just having
a really hard time.

445
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,466
Whose fault is that?

446
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:04,338
I know.
I still feel bad for her.

447
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:06,674
Of course.
It was a terrible accident.

448
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,775
It wasn't an accident.

449
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,576
Bunny, stop. Come on.

450
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:11,588
I don't want to be rude. I know
that she was your friend.

451
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,881
She was our friend,
when she was normal.

452
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,717
And then she lost her mind.

453
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:20,120
She took her son
out into that desert.

454
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:24,391
- She thought she saw something.
- She hallucinated.

455
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:30,264
<i>Well, it wasn't exactly
clear as to what... happened.</i>

456
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:33,701
<i>She knew how dangerous
it was, just like we all do.</i>

457
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:36,603
The one thing
they ask of us is to stay here,

458
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,206
where it's safe.

459
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:41,975
But still, she dragged that
little boy out into the middle

460
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:45,479
of god-knows-what.

461
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:47,247
<i>If they don't want us
going out there,</i>

462
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:49,650
<i>they have their reasons.</i>

463
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:51,218
<i>So when they found her...</i>

464
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:52,152
<i>She was alone.</i>

465
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,887
They never found him.

466
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:56,557
Oh.

467
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:57,491
I knew he died, I...

468
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,026
I just hadn't realized...

469
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:02,229
She claims
they took him to punish her.

470
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,372
Boys and their toys.

471
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:14,208
Least we know they're
getting work done.

472
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:17,211
What do you think
they're really doing out there?

473
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:23,150
- What do you mean?
- I mean,
I know what they say...

474
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:26,019
You know, "development
of progressive materials,"

475
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:29,089
but, sometimes Peter insinuates

476
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:31,392
that they're
actually making weapons.

477
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,494
And that it's all
happening underground,

478
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,295
- because frank discovered...
- Peg.

479
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,067
Sorry.

480
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:44,271
We're all here because
we believe in the mission.

481
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:45,773
Yes.

482
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,942
We have jobs too, that are just
as important, just as vital.

483
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,879
What we do at home,
supporting them,

484
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,579
taking care of them.

485
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:54,758
Without that, they couldn't be
out there changing the world.

486
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:56,250
Mm.

487
00:27:16,905 --> 00:27:19,373
<i>Everyone
focuses on the sacrifices</i>

488
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,176
<i>you make by going
after what you want.</i>

489
00:27:22,242 --> 00:27:24,945
<i>I want you to focus
on the sacrifices you make</i>

490
00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:26,947
<i>by standing still.</i>

491
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:31,251
<i>By not going
after what you know
you are owed by giving up,</i>

492
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,153
<i>and taking the smaller version
of your life.</i>

493
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,322
<i>Sacrifice doesn't just
take courage,</i>

494
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:37,157
<i>it takes faith, saying,</i>

495
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:40,661
<i>"I will stand this pain,
this hurt, this effort,</i>

496
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:44,097
<i>knowing that what I want
is waiting on the other side."</i>

497
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:49,503
<i>It's scary
to sacrifice something.</i>

498
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,807
<i>But you're sacrificing
something more</i>

499
00:27:52,874 --> 00:27:54,675
<i>by sitting in that fear.</i>

500

No shopping today, huh?

507
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:25,639
What?

508
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,774
Oh, I said,
no shopping today, huh?

509
00:28:27,842 --> 00:28:30,344
Oh, no. No.

510
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,889
Afraid that's
the end of the line for me,

511
00:28:31,913 --> 00:28:34,214
I'm just gonna need
to loop around back to town.

512
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:37,251
That's fine, i'm...
I'm just here for the joyride.

513
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:39,152
I needed to get
out of the house.

514
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:43,357
Get some fresh air.

515
00:29:14,354 --> 00:29:18,759
Sir? Do you... do you see that?

516
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:20,828
You all right, miss?

517
00:29:20,895 --> 00:29:23,330
Yeah. Do you see that plane?

518
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:25,341
Uh, I'm afraid I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

519
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:27,501
There's a plane, right...

520
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,971
Oh, no!

521
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:32,306
Oh, my god! Stop! Stop! Stop!

522
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,776
That plane! It just crashed!

523
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:37,144
Are you sure?

524
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,856
Yes! Yes! You...
You need to drive out there.

525
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,657
It just crashed. I...
I can show you where it is.

526
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:43,985
Drive? No, uh...
I don't go that way.

527
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:44,919
What?

528
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:46,186
I don't go that way.

529
00:29:46,253 --> 00:29:49,089
We need to stay here,
where it's safe.

530
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:55,063
But I...
I can't go out there alone.

531
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:58,066
That's not my route. I can't.

532
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,733
But what if they need help?

533
00:30:00,534 --> 00:30:01,534
Hey!

534
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:05,739
Oh, my god.

535
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:08,442
Oh, my god.
What's wrong with you?

536
00:31:36,763 --> 00:31:38,298
Hello?

537
00:31:40,868 --> 00:31:44,105
I need some help.
There's been an accident.

538
00:31:44,172 --> 00:31:46,306
A plane went down...

539
00:32:11,032 --> 00:32:12,733

- Jack?
- You're awake.

554
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:00,660
I didn't even have time
to set the table.

555
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:04,564
What's going on?

556
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:06,133
Well, I'm making you dinner.

557
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,803
Now, we were supposed
to have five courses.

558
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:12,306
Unfortunately, I think we're
down to about three.

559
00:36:12,373 --> 00:36:13,975
That... don't look at that.

560
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:18,079
That course is officially
off the menu.

561
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:19,679
What happened?

562
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:22,515
I got a little aggressive
with the seasoning.

563
00:36:22,582 --> 00:36:24,651
How long have you been home?

564
00:36:24,718 --> 00:36:27,254
Uh, a few hours.

565
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:29,023
Okay.

566
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,325
Nope, don't look at that.
That's...

567
00:36:31,392 --> 00:36:33,060
Okay, so I'm making that roast.

568
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:35,062
You know, the one you made
for my birthday?

569
00:36:35,129 --> 00:36:38,698
Only with a few changes.

570
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,869
I was here when you got here?

571
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:43,971
Yeah. Asleep in the bedroom.

572
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:47,074
Do you put carrots in a roast?

573
00:36:48,442 --> 00:36:50,144
How did I get home?

574
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:51,711
Trolley, I think.

575
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:56,516
Wait, so he came out and got me?

576
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,651
What are you talking about?

577
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:02,456
Jack, I got off the trolley.
I saw a plane crash.

578
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:04,859
Alice, I think I would've heard
if there was a plane crash.

579
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:07,070
- No, Jack, I saw it...
- They tend to be rather loud...

580
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:10,630
- And I started walking and...
- And hard to miss.

581
00:37:17,537 --> 00:37:20,241
Hey. Are you okay?

582
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:23,210
- No, I don't know. I'm not...
- What's wrong?

583
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:29,183
I had a really weird dream.
A really weird dream.

584
00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:32,153
I'm sorry.

585
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:34,155
Do you know what
weird dreams make me?

586
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:35,956
What?

587
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:37,324
Hungry.

588
00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:41,095
- Would you like some carrot?
- Yes.

589
00:37:45,966 --> 00:37:48,135
Alice, I want to be honest
with you about something.

590
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:49,702
Mm-hm?

591
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:53,606
I don't think these mashed
potatoes are gonna work.

592
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:57,677
That's because you need
to boil them first, baby.

593
00:37:57,744 --> 00:37:59,213
I knew it.

594
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,714
I knew there was
a step missing.
Such an idiot.

595
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:03,050
Let me put a pot on.

596
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:04,819
No, no, no.

597
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:06,463
-Come on, let me just put the...
-Make us some drinks.
Relax. Relax.

598
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:07,388
- Okay. Okay.
- Make some drinks.

599
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:09,890
I am your chef tonight!

600
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:16,864

601
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:18,833

00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:14,968
No.

633
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:18,372
No.

634
00:42:41,662 --> 00:42:42,930
Margaret?

635
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:56,744
No. No, don't!

636
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,184
Wait!

637
00:43:06,653 --> 00:43:08,489
No! No, get off me!

638
00:43:08,555 --> 00:43:10,891
Margaret! Get off me!

639
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:12,526
Margaret!

640
00:43:13,627 --> 00:43:15,162
Jack, you don't understand.

641
00:43:15,229 --> 00:43:16,697
I was right there.

642
00:43:16,764 --> 00:43:18,575
- I watched the whole thing.
- I'm tired, Alice.

643
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,467
<i>- I saw her fall.
- I want to go to bed.</i>

644
00:43:20,534 --> 00:43:22,903
I tried to go and help,
and then they dragged me away.

645
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,371
Why would they take me away?

646
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:26,306
- You have to stop!
- They...

647
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,642
There is no way
that she's fine, Jack.

648
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:30,010
No.

649
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:33,580
I don't know what to tell you.

650
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:35,817
Ted is with her
at the hospital right now.

651
00:43:35,884 --> 00:43:37,785
- He said she needs
a few stitches.
- Mm-mm.

652
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:40,921
She slipped cleaning
the window. It was an accident.

653
00:43:40,988 --> 00:43:43,123
Nope. I saw her.
She cut herself.

654
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,425
You had a bad night.

655
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:46,593
- Don't! No!
- You weren't feeling well.

656
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,571
- She fell, and you imagined
the worst case scenario.
- No, don't do that.

657
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:51,098
- She slit her throat!
- That's crazy.

658
00:43:51,165 --> 00:43:52,533
Crazy. It's crazy.

659
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:54,535
Jack, I saw it happen.
She cut herself open.

660
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:56,937
There was blood everywhere.
It's not just a few stitches.

661
00:43:57,004 --> 00:43:59,973
Please don't get hysterical.

662
00:44:07,347 --> 00:44:08,582
Jack...

663
00:44:11,618 --> 00:44:13,120
She was my friend.

664
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:16,423
And she came to me for help.

665
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:19,493
And I ignored her.

666
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:23,163
And then this happened.

667
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,199
And I feel like it's my fault.

668
00:44:27,836 --> 00:44:30,237
It's no one's fault, Alice.
It was an accident.

669
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:31,304
No.

670
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,909
She said they would
come after her

671
00:44:34,975 --> 00:44:37,010
because she knew something.

672
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:41,682
Why are they lying
about what happened?

673
00:44:41,748 --> 00:44:44,518
- Please, just stop.
- What are they hiding?

674
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,056
Come on, baby, you have to
admit this is weird.

675
00:44:49,122 --> 00:44:51,191
- Stop!
- There's something off!

676
00:45:03,136 --> 00:45:05,439
What are you doing
at the victory project?

677
00:45:06,808 --> 00:45:09,676
You know what I do, Alice.
I'm a technical engineer.

678
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:12,112
Mm-hm.

679
00:45:12,914 --> 00:45:14,181
I know.

680
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:18,151
But what are they doing?

681
00:45:23,123 --> 00:45:24,625
Please...

682
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,361
What's actually happening?

683
00:45:28,128 --> 00:45:29,396
Don't ask me that.

684
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:31,966
The development
of progressive materials?

685
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:33,978
- What does that even mean?
- You know we can't
talk about this.

686
00:45:34,002 --> 00:45:35,245
- What does that even mean?
- You know we can't
talk about this.

687
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:36,637
Come on, what does it mean?

688
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:38,772
What does it even mean?
Do you know?

689
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,808
Do you even know
what frank is actually doing?

690
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:42,209
It's classified.

691
00:45:42,276 --> 00:45:43,586
We're not even allowed
to discuss our jobs

692
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,279
with other departments,
you know that.

693
00:45:45,345 --> 00:45:46,780
What if Margaret was right?

694
00:45:46,848 --> 00:45:48,016
Stop it, Alice.

695
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:48,983
What if this place is dangerous?

696
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:50,217
- What if...
- Stop it!

697
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,688
I'm part of
something important, Alice.

698
00:45:55,957 --> 00:45:58,592
This mission,
what frank's doing, it matters.

699
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:00,203
I know that, baby,
but you're not listening to me.

700
00:46:00,227 --> 00:46:03,664
No! Not everyone
gets this opportunity.

701
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,232
And if you keep
talking like this,

702
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:06,968
you're gonna put it all at risk.

703
00:46:07,035 --> 00:46:08,635
You're worried about a demotion?

704
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:09,982
That's what you're
worried about?

705
00:46:10,038 --> 00:46:11,104
Our life...

706
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:14,207
Alice. Our life together.

707
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:16,310
This.

708
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:18,211
We could lose this.

709
00:46:21,015 --> 00:46:22,182
Please.

710
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:24,819
Just get a hold of yourself.

711
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:28,554
Please.

712
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,525
Fuck's sake.

713
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:50,544
<i>Victory is safe and secure.</i>

714
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:53,047
<i>A perfect place
to raise the family</i>

715
00:46:53,113 --> 00:46:54,481
<i>you've always wanted,</i>

716
00:46:54,548 --> 00:46:56,483
<i>when you're not relaxing
with friends</i>

717
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,419
<i>or enjoying
the breathtaking scenery</i>

718
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:02,023
<i>of this sunbaked paradise.</i>

719
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,424
<i>Although, you might find
the best scenery</i>

720
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:06,326
<i>at the club pool.</i>

721
00:47:06,393 --> 00:47:09,296
<i>Here you can live the life
you deserve.</i>

722
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:11,798
<i>We can all live the life...</i>

723
00:47:55,843 --> 00:47:57,544
<i>If I could tell frank anything,</i>

724
00:47:57,611 --> 00:48:00,480
<i>it would just be, "thank you."
Because I didn't know</i>

725
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:02,382
<i>I could be this happy.</i>

726
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:06,720
<i>Honestly, I don't even remember
my life before victory.</i>

727
00:48:06,787 --> 00:48:11,324
<i>Frank gave us the opportunity
of a lifetime. I wouldn't...</i>

728
00:48:55,036 --> 00:48:57,839
<i>We are so lucky to be here.</i>

729
00:49:10,118 --> 00:49:12,552
Hm.

730
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:15,655
- Is there a bug going around?
- No, not that I know of.

731
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:20,962
Think this is just
run-of-the-mill exhaustion.

732
00:49:21,028 --> 00:49:23,965
You had any new stresses
or pressures lately?

733
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:27,168
- Um...
- -She saw Ted's wife fall.

734
00:49:27,235 --> 00:49:28,702
Thought maybe it might be shock.

735
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:31,005
Boy, that was quite a tumble.

736
00:49:31,072 --> 00:49:32,506
She was so embarrassed.

737
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:36,510
It... it wasn't a tumble.

738
00:49:38,411 --> 00:49:39,713
She slit her throat.

739
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,382
- Alice.
- Uh, no, no, no.

740
00:49:45,253 --> 00:49:48,990
Witnessing a trauma can often
lead to distorted memories.

741
00:49:49,056 --> 00:49:50,390
Even nightmares.

742
00:49:52,093 --> 00:49:53,460
It's...

743
00:49:53,527 --> 00:49:55,629
I have some pills
I can prescribe for that.

744
00:49:55,695 --> 00:49:59,934
Uh, I... I really don't think
that I need those.

745
00:50:00,767 --> 00:50:02,769
Oh, they're precautionary.

746
00:50:03,737 --> 00:50:04,906
Most of my patients have had

747
00:50:04,972 --> 00:50:07,842
quite a bit of success
with them.

748
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:10,710
They will just keep you relaxed.

749
00:50:15,615 --> 00:50:16,750
She doesn't need those.

750
00:50:18,652 --> 00:50:20,520
This isn't a problem.

751
00:50:20,587 --> 00:50:22,857
We can handle it ourselves.

752
00:50:24,959 --> 00:50:27,028
Well, I'll just
keep that on file.

753
00:50:33,366 --> 00:50:36,670
What did you do to Margaret?

754
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:38,906
Pardon?

755
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,041
Ted's wife.

756
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:47,547
I'm sorry, I'm just... I...

757
00:50:47,614 --> 00:50:51,986
I still don't understand
how she's okay.

758
00:50:54,487 --> 00:50:56,834
You wouldn't want me discussing
the details of your treatment

759
00:50:56,858 --> 00:50:58,525
with my other patients, now,
would you?

760
00:50:58,592 --> 00:51:02,296
Mm... I wouldn't mind.

761
00:51:02,362 --> 00:51:05,099
I would just... I would really
love to know the details of...

762
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,634
Of how you fixed her.

763
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:12,405
Well, as you know, we provide
both psychiatric

764
00:51:12,472 --> 00:51:14,441
and physical care here.

765
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:17,544
And Margaret was
in need of both.

766
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:19,814
The good news is,
is that physically, she's fine,

767
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:22,316
but psychologically, she wasn't.

768
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:24,085
She was having
significant troubles.

769
00:51:24,151 --> 00:51:26,888
Outbursts. Paranoia.

770
00:51:26,954 --> 00:51:29,656
She made it impossible
for Ted to do his job,

771
00:51:29,723 --> 00:51:33,127
so he no longer works
for the victory project.

772
00:51:33,194 --> 00:51:35,662
She needed quite a bit of help.

773
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:37,899
Ah... not like you.

774
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:41,135
No.

775
00:51:41,202 --> 00:51:43,436
It's not necessary here.

776
00:51:43,503 --> 00:51:45,639
It's a totally
different scenario.

777
00:51:46,841 --> 00:51:49,076
What is it that you brits say?

778
00:51:51,645 --> 00:51:54,315
Ah! "Keep calm and carry on."

779
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:01,822
Jack.
Walk me out?

780
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:04,325
Of course.

781
00:52:04,392 --> 00:52:06,160
And remember...

782
00:52:06,227 --> 00:52:08,528
- That I'm always
a phone call away.
- Oh, thank you.

783
00:52:08,595 --> 00:52:09,796
Thank you so much.

784
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:36,456
Oh, come on.

785
00:52:44,332 --> 00:52:46,566
You know our position on that.

786
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:48,803
So glad you came back.
You left this.

787
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:50,549
I'd forget my head
if it wasn't screwed on.

788
00:52:52,306 --> 00:52:54,708
Jack, shouldn't you be getting
back to work?

789
00:52:54,774 --> 00:52:56,576
Yeah. Of course.

790
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,283
- See you tonight.
- Mm-hm.

791
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:03,350
Okay.

792

Might ask shelley

795
00:55:49,682 --> 00:55:52,186
if it feels like a good time.

796
00:55:52,253 --> 00:55:54,922
You're still in the bath?
We're gonna be late.

797
00:55:56,157 --> 00:55:57,925
You see the dress I got you?

798
00:55:58,893 --> 00:56:01,262
Picked it out last week.

799
00:56:01,328 --> 00:56:03,330
I couldn't stop
picturing you in it.

800
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:07,268
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

801
00:56:08,668 --> 00:56:10,304
You look incredible.

802
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,009
Been thinking we should
try something kind of crazy.

I don't know,
I think it would be fun.

811

Good evening.
We've been waiting for you.

821
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,338
I'm so sorry.

822
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:19,607
You have the best table
in the house.

823
00:57:27,014 --> 00:57:30,818
- Good to see you, man.
- Hey, guys.

824
00:57:30,884 --> 00:57:33,087
Why are you two
always fighting?
What's wrong with you?

825
00:57:33,153 --> 00:57:36,056
- Always. Constantly.
- We're fine.
We're fine.

826
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:39,193
- Hi.
- Oh! Finally! Hi.

827
00:57:39,827 --> 00:57:42,496
Hello. Oh, my god!

828
00:57:44,431 --> 00:57:46,667
Here, drink this.

829
00:57:46,734 --> 00:57:48,014
You look just like
a little doll.

830
00:57:48,068 --> 00:57:49,670
Spin, spin, spin! Ah!

831
00:57:49,737 --> 00:57:53,107
This is me. This is you.
Here, go, go, go.

832
00:57:53,173 --> 00:57:55,109
- All the way back.
- Just drink it all!

833
00:57:55,175 --> 00:57:57,678
- There we go.
- There we go!

834
00:57:57,745 --> 00:57:59,580
Here are the troublemakers.

835
00:58:01,382 --> 00:58:03,093
I can't believe we're allowed
to put all of you at one table.

836
00:58:03,117 --> 00:58:04,794
I think it's better for
insurance purposes,

837
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:06,453
- to be honest.
- That is true.

838
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:11,058
Alice, how are you feeling?

839
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:13,427
I'm... I'm well.
I'm doing well.

840
00:58:14,094 --> 00:58:15,195
This is beautiful.

841
00:58:15,262 --> 00:58:18,465
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

842
00:58:18,532 --> 00:58:20,644
And if I hear glass breaking,
I'm coming right back here.

843
00:58:20,668 --> 00:58:21,902
Oh, don't tempt us

844
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:23,570
or we'll be breaking glass
all night.

845
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:30,611
See you
on the dance floor later?

846
00:58:30,678 --> 00:58:32,346
Yes, ma'am. Of course.

847
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,986
Can my
husband throw a party or what?

848
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:45,225
He does so much for us.

849
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:47,628
More than we could ever repay.

850
00:58:47,695 --> 00:58:50,764
But I have attempted
a little... gift for him.

851
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:53,367
- Uh-oh.
- -For all of us, really.

852
00:58:53,434 --> 00:58:55,069
I hope you enjoy.

853
00:59:10,617 --> 00:59:12,219
Oh!

854
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:14,321
Let's go!

855
00:59:53,761 --> 00:59:54,895
You went out there.

856
00:59:56,029 --> 00:59:57,097
You saw it.

857
01:00:03,704 --> 01:00:05,606
<i>She was having outbursts.</i>

858
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,175
Paranoia.

859
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:20,721
How 'bout that?

860
01:00:24,224 --> 01:00:27,127
There you are. I bow to you.

861
01:00:29,797 --> 01:00:31,799
Now, make some noise! Come on!

862
01:00:31,866 --> 01:00:34,601
You like that?

863
01:00:34,668 --> 01:00:36,370
Did you guys like that?

864
01:00:36,437 --> 01:00:39,473
Get off of your seats, come on!

865
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,175
How are you, sweetheart?
Good to see you.

866
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:43,277
All right, this is what
I'm talking about.

867
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:45,679
You work hard, you play hard.

868
01:00:45,746 --> 01:00:47,214
What do you say, Jacko?

869
01:00:49,918 --> 01:00:51,718
- Jack, I want to go home.
- What?

870
01:00:51,785 --> 01:00:53,020
I want to go.

871
01:00:53,086 --> 01:00:54,955
Come on, Tim!
Come on, Tim!

872
01:00:55,022 --> 01:00:57,224
All right!

873
01:00:57,291 --> 01:01:00,027
Whoo!

874
01:01:00,093 --> 01:01:02,229
How about that?
Put your hands together.

875
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:03,530
Please, we need to leave.

876
01:01:03,597 --> 01:01:05,165
We need to leave right now.
Please.

877
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:06,376
- We'll just pour you a drink.
- Please.

878
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,668
- No.
- You'll be okay.

879
01:01:07,734 --> 01:01:10,771
Only the best for victory.
My goodness!

880
01:01:10,839 --> 01:01:12,973
All right, take a seat.

881
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:21,014
Uh, I have the burden
now of trying to follow that,

882
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:23,450
which will be hard, but...

883
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:26,520
- Jack...
- I have to admit that I, uh...

884
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:30,524
I was planning...

885
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:32,693
A little presentation of my own.

886
01:01:32,759 --> 01:01:36,563
I know.

887
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:40,869
I know. Yeah.
All right. All right.

888
01:01:42,904 --> 01:01:44,171
Jack chambers.

889
01:01:46,106 --> 01:01:48,475
If I could have you up here
for a minute.

890
01:01:50,945 --> 01:01:52,412
Jack.

891
01:01:52,479 --> 01:01:54,916
Jack, please, I need to
go home. We need to leave.

892
01:01:54,983 --> 01:01:57,518
Come on, everybody,
give him a round of applause.

893
01:01:57,584 --> 01:01:59,186
Needs a little encouragement.

894
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,622
Big round of applause.

895
01:02:01,688 --> 01:02:04,458
Let's give him
a big victory welcome!

896
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:08,328
Jack chambers.

897
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:20,507
Tonight is my favorite night
of the year.

898
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:23,176
I love seeing everybody
under one roof,

899
01:02:23,243 --> 01:02:25,779
seeing how much we've all grown.

900
01:02:28,016 --> 01:02:29,550
But few...

901
01:02:30,717 --> 01:02:32,719
Few have grown as...

902
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:36,490
Impressively...

903
01:02:36,557 --> 01:02:38,325
As this young man right here.

904
01:02:42,897 --> 01:02:46,433
I've debated long and hard
about this, lord knows. Whew!

905
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,637
It's certainly
out of the ordinary.

906
01:02:50,704 --> 01:02:54,408
But you know what? This man
is out of the ordinary.

907
01:02:54,474 --> 01:02:58,111
This man, I am in awe of.

908
01:03:00,213 --> 01:03:02,749
Jack chambers, I am honored...

909
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,355
To invite you to join our...

910
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,926
Senior advisory board.

911
01:03:28,775 --> 01:03:30,711
Are you the man
that you say you are?

912
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:42,356
It's a good fit.

913
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:47,361
Thank you for your loyalty.

914
01:03:48,997 --> 01:03:50,564
More good things to come.

915
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,202
How 'bout that,
ladies and gentlemen.

916
01:04:32,006 --> 01:04:33,841
You wanna see the boy dance?

917
01:04:37,511 --> 01:04:40,180
Look at this boy dance!

918
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:44,819
Come on! Come on!

919
01:04:48,555 --> 01:04:50,858
Look what he can do!

920
01:04:57,131 --> 01:05:00,068
<i>- Don't say that.
You're gonna get another job.
- Alice!</i>

921
01:05:01,368 --> 01:05:04,806
Hey. What's wrong? Honey.

922
01:05:06,074 --> 01:05:08,843
What happened? What's wrong?

923
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:11,913
It's extraordinary!

924
01:05:18,986 --> 01:05:21,022
Everything's fine. It's okay.

925
01:05:21,089 --> 01:05:22,355
Bunny, we need to go.

926
01:05:22,422 --> 01:05:23,766
We need to get out of here
right now.

927
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:26,293
- No, no, no. We're okay.
- We need to go.

928
01:05:26,359 --> 01:05:29,964
We're okay. Come on.
Tell me, what happened?

929
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:35,268
How about that, huh?

930
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:37,404
You watching him dance?

931
01:05:37,471 --> 01:05:39,339
Margaret was right.

932
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:44,478
She was asking questions
that they don't want us to ask.

933
01:05:44,544 --> 01:05:47,547
And so they silenced her.

934
01:05:47,614 --> 01:05:49,483
She didn't slip.
It wasn't an accident.

935
01:05:49,549 --> 01:05:52,352
I saw it happen.
I saw her fall.

936
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:54,588
They're lying about everything.

937
01:05:58,126 --> 01:05:59,693
Dance, Jack!

938
01:06:02,529 --> 01:06:04,899
Let's make him spin, shall we?

939
01:06:04,966 --> 01:06:07,467
And so I went out there,
and I saw it.

940
01:06:07,534 --> 01:06:09,603
You went... you went out where?

941
01:06:09,669 --> 01:06:13,306
Yeah, that's it!
Come on, boy, faster!

942
01:06:13,373 --> 01:06:16,043
Keep it going! Come on!
Come on! Yeah!

943
01:06:18,345 --> 01:06:19,780
That's it!

944
01:06:20,948 --> 01:06:23,985
Ha-ha!

945
01:06:24,051 --> 01:06:26,653
Doesn't that make you believe?

946
01:06:27,989 --> 01:06:29,857
Stand up!

947
01:06:29,924 --> 01:06:33,861
Stand up, take a bow!
Take a bow, you deserve it!

948
01:06:33,928 --> 01:06:37,064
And when I touched it,
I saw something.

949
01:06:38,065 --> 01:06:40,667
And I keep remembering more.

950
01:06:40,734 --> 01:06:43,537
And I heard frank's voice,
and he's in my head...

951
01:06:43,603 --> 01:06:45,873
It's more than just
a celebration

952
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:50,777
of our freedom from society's
arbitrary regulations,

953
01:06:50,845 --> 01:06:56,017
it's a celebration
of potential unleashed!

954
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:58,920
It's a reminder of who we are!

955
01:06:58,986 --> 01:07:01,388
Can I just show you?
Let's just go out there.

956
01:07:01,454 --> 01:07:02,632
Everybody will be
distracted right now.

957
01:07:02,656 --> 01:07:03,891
We can take Dean's car.

958
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:05,625
- We can head to...
- Stop. Stop. Stop it!

959
01:07:07,228 --> 01:07:09,563
- Have you lost your mind?
- What?

960
01:07:09,629 --> 01:07:11,331
You went to headquarters?

961
01:07:11,398 --> 01:07:13,878
- Because I thought I saw
a plane crash.
- It is the one rule...

962
01:07:13,935 --> 01:07:15,478
- No, I know...
- They ask us to respect.

963
01:07:15,502 --> 01:07:17,271
You know how dangerous it is.

964
01:07:17,337 --> 01:07:19,439
We are not going backwards.

965
01:07:19,506 --> 01:07:21,943
We're pushing forwards, yes?

966
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:24,278
We move!

967
01:07:24,344 --> 01:07:27,380
- You stole from Dr. Collins?
- Because Margaret
can't be okay!

968
01:07:27,447 --> 01:07:30,084
Get a hold of yourself, Alice!

969
01:07:30,151 --> 01:07:32,485
You are behaving like a child.

970
01:07:32,552 --> 01:07:34,021
Your husband is out there

971
01:07:34,088 --> 01:07:36,690
having the most important night
of his life.

972
01:07:36,756 --> 01:07:37,992
He's being celebrated,

973
01:07:38,059 --> 01:07:38,993
and you're in here
trying to ruin it?

974
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,328
No! No!

975
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:43,064
You sound exactly like Margaret!

976
01:07:47,268 --> 01:07:49,036
Whose world is it?

977
01:07:49,103 --> 01:07:50,338
Ours!

978
01:07:50,403 --> 01:07:52,439
Whose world is this?

979
01:07:52,505 --> 01:07:53,841
Ours!

980
01:07:53,908 --> 01:07:55,508
- Whose world is this?
- Ours!

981
01:07:55,575 --> 01:07:56,476
Whose world is this?

982
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,744
Ours!

983
01:08:03,117 --> 01:08:05,485
- Whose world is it? Ours!
- Ours!

984
01:08:05,552 --> 01:08:07,989
- Whose world is it? Ours!
- Ours!

985
01:08:08,055 --> 01:08:09,489
Whose world is it?

986
01:08:09,556 --> 01:08:11,058
- Ours!
- Ours!

987
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:12,860
- Whose world is it?
Ours!
- Ours!

988
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:15,495
- Whose world is it?
Ours!
- Ours!

989
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:28,242
They're calling it
operation extract.

990
01:08:28,309 --> 01:08:30,477
It's higher security clearance.

991
01:08:30,543 --> 01:08:32,412
I'm gonna be heading
the whole thing myself,

992
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,116
which is a real vote of
confidence from frank, I think.

993
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:39,186
<i>♪ See the pyramids ♪</i>

994
01:08:39,253 --> 01:08:42,722
<i>♪ along the nile ♪</i>

995
01:08:48,795 --> 01:08:50,831
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

996
01:08:50,898 --> 01:08:51,999
There he is.

997
01:08:52,066 --> 01:08:55,568
Oh, my. Those are beautiful.
Come on in.

998
01:08:55,635 --> 01:08:56,804
Come on in.

999
01:08:56,871 --> 01:08:58,205
I want it for you.
Thank you.

1000
01:08:58,272 --> 01:08:59,941
Are we late?
I feel like we're late.

1001
01:09:00,007 --> 01:09:01,417
We literally
are arriving at the same time.

1002
01:09:01,441 --> 01:09:02,709
What are
these platters? Wow!

1003
01:09:02,776 --> 01:09:04,544
Whatever's going on here,
I love. I love.

1004
01:09:04,611 --> 01:09:06,047
You like it?

1005
01:09:06,113 --> 01:09:07,523
- Yeah, the decor is...
- I'm glad, bill. I'm glad.

1006
01:09:07,547 --> 01:09:08,382
All right, buddy,
tell me the truth.

1007
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:09,616
Is he really coming?

1008
01:09:09,683 --> 01:09:11,185
This is for you.
I think he's coming.

1009
01:09:11,252 --> 01:09:12,461
How the hell did you get frank
to come to your house?

1010
01:09:12,485 --> 01:09:14,055
It wasn't me. It was Alice.

1011
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:15,799
These are the perks. I get it.
This is how you're living.

1012
01:09:15,823 --> 01:09:17,663
Is everything in this house
from the catalogue?

1013
01:09:17,724 --> 01:09:19,693
It's a house. Show me the ring.
Let me see it.

1014
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:21,228
Did we beat bunny?

1015
01:09:21,295 --> 01:09:23,864
Uh, she... she's not coming.

1016
01:09:24,664 --> 01:09:26,901
- Hm.
- Told you.

1017
01:09:26,968 --> 01:09:28,544
- Sorry, boys. Can I just get...
- Yeah, yeah.

1018
01:09:28,568 --> 01:09:29,913
You know, it's a good thing
you can dance,

1019
01:09:29,937 --> 01:09:31,415
'cause you're so hideously
unattractive.

1020
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,207
- They're here!
- How many secrets do you...

1021
01:09:33,274 --> 01:09:34,674
Thank you.

1022
01:09:34,741 --> 01:09:36,243
- It's good to see you.
- Wow.

1023
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:39,579
I knew it. I told peg.
It's gonna be a no-tie event.

1024
01:09:39,646 --> 01:09:43,084
- Frank.
- Jack! You crazy
son of a bitch!

1025
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,550
What do you want me
to do with this?

1026
01:09:44,584 --> 01:09:46,020
Hold on to it.

1027
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:47,697
I told her it was gonna be like
a casual thing.

1028
01:09:47,721 --> 01:09:49,123
- Put that on ice.
- Wow.

1029
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:50,891
- Thanks for coming.
- I'm proud of you.

1030
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:52,302
- Thank you.
- What a lovely home,
by the way.

1031
01:09:52,326 --> 01:09:54,095
Jack, could you make shelley
a cocktail?

1032
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:55,429
Of course.

1033
01:09:55,495 --> 01:09:57,074
Hey, frank, that was
a hell of a party last night.

1034
01:09:57,098 --> 01:09:58,265
It was.

1035
01:09:58,332 --> 01:10:00,533
I'm trying to get my wife
into a Martini glass.

1036
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:03,570
- He liked that.
- No, he didn't.

1037
01:10:03,636 --> 01:10:05,476
- Where's your drink?
- It's right here.
Cheers!

1038
01:10:05,538 --> 01:10:07,707
Cheers.
It's a wonderful home.

1039
01:10:07,774 --> 01:10:09,477
- How are you?
- Me?

1040
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:10,811
- I'm amazing.
- Mm-hm.

1041
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:12,712
After the night Jack had,
I'm incredible.

1042
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:13,848
Right. Of course.

1043
01:10:13,914 --> 01:10:16,750
Cheers. Thanks for coming.

1044
01:10:16,817 --> 01:10:18,785
- You were a triumph last night.
- Oh!

1045
01:10:18,853 --> 01:10:20,163
We haven't stopped talking
about you.

1046
01:10:20,187 --> 01:10:21,721
You guys go now
and enjoy yourselves.

1047
01:10:21,788 --> 01:10:24,657
I'm gonna go back
to the plates and finish up,

1048
01:10:24,724 --> 01:10:26,564
- and, um, I'll see you in...
- Can I help you?

1049
01:10:26,626 --> 01:10:28,105
- No, no, no, no, go.
- You sure? Okay.

1050
01:10:28,129 --> 01:10:29,562
Promise. Go snoop.

1051
01:10:29,629 --> 01:10:30,931
I love this record player.

1052
01:10:30,998 --> 01:10:32,442
- You do? You like it, bill?
- I love it.

1053
01:10:32,466 --> 01:10:34,306
At my house, I have a bench.
How did you get...

1054
01:10:36,837 --> 01:10:38,671
You can probably tell by now

1055
01:10:38,738 --> 01:10:41,475
that appetizers are where
I really express myself

1056
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:43,411
and buck convention.

1057
01:10:43,477 --> 01:10:44,744
It's a skill.

1058
01:10:44,812 --> 01:10:46,447
Maybe you can teach me sometime.

1059
01:10:46,514 --> 01:10:48,049
Can't be taught.

1060
01:11:01,262 --> 01:11:03,297
I learned something
very exciting.

1061
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:06,801
Oh, really? What's that?

1062
01:11:06,867 --> 01:11:09,303
Rumor is you and Jack
are trying.

1063
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:11,072
Oh, well...

1064
01:11:11,138 --> 01:11:12,807
- We'll see.
- Mm.

1065
01:11:13,673 --> 01:11:15,209
Hope we'll see a little boy.

1066
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:24,318
I'm sorry
bunny didn't believe you.

1067
01:11:35,362 --> 01:11:37,998
But then again, you didn't
believe Margaret, so...

1068
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:41,869
Why should anyone believe you?

1069
01:11:49,276 --> 01:11:51,312
My god, you fascinate me.

1070
01:11:52,779 --> 01:11:54,647
Because I've been waiting
for someone like you.

1071
01:11:54,714 --> 01:11:57,684
Someone to challenge me.

1072
01:12:00,221 --> 01:12:02,189
No great man has changed
the course of history

1073
01:12:02,256 --> 01:12:05,993
without being pushed
to the limits of his potential.

1074
01:12:07,094 --> 01:12:08,329
And you push me.

1075
01:12:10,498 --> 01:12:11,832
Yeah.

1076
01:12:14,767 --> 01:12:16,837
I do hope you keep going.

1077
01:12:28,449 --> 01:12:29,984
And yet, here you are.

1078
01:12:31,751 --> 01:12:33,254
Preparing dinner.

1079
01:12:35,755 --> 01:12:37,224
Like a good girl.

1080
01:12:45,866 --> 01:12:47,168
- Sit.
- Absolutely.

1081
01:12:47,234 --> 01:12:48,634
Do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

1082
01:12:48,668 --> 01:12:50,905
No, I hope it's a boy.
Thank you.

1083
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:52,640
- Can't get enough
of 'em, right?

1084
01:12:52,705 --> 01:12:54,341
Girls are hard. They are.

1085
01:12:54,408 --> 01:12:56,709
- I'll be right there,
all right?
- Thank you.

1086
01:12:58,379 --> 01:13:00,780
You know, Alice tells me you're
a hell of a tennis player.

1087
01:13:00,848 --> 01:13:02,983
- Oh, she does?
- Is that right? Yeah.

1088
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,618
She's being polite.

1089
01:13:04,684 --> 01:13:06,329
Well, we're looking
for some fierce competitors.

1090
01:13:06,353 --> 01:13:08,098
If you're ever ready
to get out there, call me.

1091
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:09,933
I've heard about that backhand,
though, it's famous.

1092
01:13:09,957 --> 01:13:11,825
If you want a partner,
I'm yours, man.

1093
01:13:11,892 --> 01:13:13,726
That's a lot of pressure.
I don't know if...

1094
01:13:13,793 --> 01:13:15,329
Thank you.

1095
01:13:25,339 --> 01:13:27,659
I'm having the fish. I don't
know what you guys are having.

1096
01:13:29,009 --> 01:13:30,444
Nice to see a familiar face.

1097
01:13:30,511 --> 01:13:32,379
Um, so anyways,
those windows right there,

1098
01:13:32,446 --> 01:13:33,814
the slatted windows?

1099
01:13:33,881 --> 01:13:35,616
They're actually called
"jalousie" windows.

1100
01:13:35,683 --> 01:13:36,917
Did you know that?

1101
01:13:36,984 --> 01:13:38,352
- You didn't know why.
- Oh, boy.

1102
01:13:38,419 --> 01:13:39,653
So, the etymology is...

1103
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:40,921
"Jealousy."

1104
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:42,199
And you say,
"whose baby is this?"

1105
01:13:42,223 --> 01:13:43,591
And they say, "it's your baby."

1106
01:13:43,657 --> 01:13:45,326
And you say,
"how could that be?"

1107
01:13:45,392 --> 01:13:46,759
And it is your baby.

1108
01:13:46,827 --> 01:13:49,129
And I just do it every year.

1109
01:13:49,196 --> 01:13:52,333
Violet, where are you from?

1110
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:55,336
- Pardon?
- I said, "where are you from?"

1111
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:58,239
Philadelphia.

1112
01:13:58,305 --> 01:14:00,274
- Mm! I'm from Philadelphia!
- Are you serious?

1113
01:14:00,341 --> 01:14:02,042
- I didn't know that.
- I knew I liked you.

1114
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:04,178
Most of the women here
are from Philadelphia.

1115
01:14:05,145 --> 01:14:07,514
Or Baltimore. Or Chicago.

1116
01:14:07,581 --> 01:14:08,748
I've noticed.

1117
01:14:08,816 --> 01:14:10,117
Mm. Can I
get anyone anything?

1118
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:11,428
I for one do not miss
the winters.

1119
01:14:11,452 --> 01:14:13,153
No, no, no.
I thrive in the sunshine,

1120
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,655
even though
I'm alabaster-skinned.

1121
01:14:14,722 --> 01:14:17,124
I love the sunshine.
I love the beach.

1122
01:14:17,191 --> 01:14:18,758
- Mm.
- She does.

1123
01:14:18,826 --> 01:14:20,294
What was the last beach
you went to?

1124
01:14:20,361 --> 01:14:21,662
Oh, fun fact about the beach.

1125
01:14:21,729 --> 01:14:23,130
- I read this.
- Yeah?

1126
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:24,608
Beaches are actually some
of the filthiest places

1127
01:14:24,632 --> 01:14:26,333
in the whole world.

1128
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,102
- Just a sandbox
of disease and...
- Peter!

1129
01:14:28,168 --> 01:14:29,479
Do not say "disease"
at the dinner table.

1130
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,071
It's true.
They need to know.

1131
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:34,508
I can probably guess.
Hilton head? Cape Cod?

1132
01:14:34,575 --> 01:14:36,043
Or the Jersey shore?

1133
01:14:38,512 --> 01:14:41,615
And we all honeymooned
in sea island,

1134
01:14:41,682 --> 01:14:44,885
or the poconos,
or Niagara Falls.

1135
01:14:48,255 --> 01:14:50,391
I think those are popular
honeymoon destinations.

1136
01:14:50,457 --> 01:14:52,660
- Expensive.
- Mm-hm. Beautiful, beautiful.

1137
01:14:52,726 --> 01:14:54,895
Peter, you, uh... you haven't
finished your story.

1138
01:14:54,962 --> 01:14:56,664
Mm!
Bill over here's probably

1139
01:14:56,730 --> 01:14:58,608
- one of the worst
golf players...
- I'm sorry, Peter.

1140
01:14:58,632 --> 01:15:01,402
I'm not quite finished.
Violet, where did
you meet bill?

1141
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,672
Well, we met on a train.

1142
01:15:04,738 --> 01:15:06,240
- To Boston.
- To Boston.

1143
01:15:06,307 --> 01:15:07,775
Yeah.

1144
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:10,010
Yes.

1145
01:15:10,077 --> 01:15:11,712
You dropped your ticket.

1146
01:15:11,779 --> 01:15:14,915
And he bent down, picked it up,
gave it to you, right?

1147
01:15:15,949 --> 01:15:17,217
It is, yeah.

1148
01:15:18,218 --> 01:15:19,987
That's how Margaret met Ted.

1149
01:15:21,622 --> 01:15:23,223
And peg, am I right in thinking

1150
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:25,726
that's how Debbie mcintyre
met her husband?

1151
01:15:25,793 --> 01:15:27,961
Yes, I am. That's how they met.

1152
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:30,230
- Yes, that's true. I'm jealous.
- Is it?

1153
01:15:30,297 --> 01:15:31,441
- Honestly, it's such a sweet story.
- -Wow.

1154
01:15:31,465 --> 01:15:33,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1155
01:15:33,067 --> 01:15:33,834
Isn't that funny,
the way those coincidences...

1156
01:15:33,901 --> 01:15:35,536
Incredible.

1157
01:15:35,602 --> 01:15:36,813
There are only so many
different stories we're told.

1158
01:15:36,837 --> 01:15:39,306
We're told what we remember.

1159
01:15:39,873 --> 01:15:41,909
Until...

1160
01:15:41,975 --> 01:15:44,645
We try to remember things...

1161
01:15:44,712 --> 01:15:47,381
That they want us to forget.

1162
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:49,917
- Like Margaret.
- Alice...

1163
01:15:49,983 --> 01:15:53,220
No. Jack. It's okay.

1164
01:15:55,155 --> 01:15:57,558
I'm curious to hear
where she's going with this.

1165
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,229
Frank is doing something to us.

1166
01:16:10,137 --> 01:16:12,439
Delusions, memory problems,
hysteria.

1167
01:16:12,506 --> 01:16:15,042
We saw these issues
with Margaret,

1168
01:16:15,109 --> 01:16:17,277
and know that it's, uh,
completely curable.

1169
01:16:17,344 --> 01:16:20,849
Dr. Collins prescribed you
a suite of medications,

1170
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:22,483
which you are
clearly not taking.

1171
01:16:22,549 --> 01:16:23,550
The question is why...

1172
01:16:23,617 --> 01:16:26,320
He's lying to us.
He's lying to all of us.

1173
01:16:26,387 --> 01:16:29,690
Bunny, your best friend,
is worried about you.

1174
01:16:29,757 --> 01:16:31,191
She thinks that you need help.

1175
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:32,726
Is that why she's
not here tonight?

1176
01:16:32,793 --> 01:16:34,371
Because you didn't want
to be reminded of that.

1177
01:16:34,395 --> 01:16:36,096
He's using you.
He's using all of us.

1178
01:16:36,163 --> 01:16:38,108
Do you even know
what the victory project
actually is?

1179
01:16:38,132 --> 01:16:41,268
- Have you ever asked?
- Do you?

1180
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:43,537
Is that why you went out there?

1181
01:16:45,874 --> 01:16:47,908
To headquarters?

1182
01:16:49,009 --> 01:16:50,911
What?

1183
01:16:52,346 --> 01:16:53,914
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Alice...

1184
01:16:53,981 --> 01:16:55,191
But you don't know
what he's doing.

1185
01:16:55,215 --> 01:16:56,885
You wandered out by yourself.

1186
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,385
You ignored every rule.

1187
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:01,121
And she put all your lives
in danger.

1188
01:17:05,926 --> 01:17:07,494
Yes, I did go out there

1189
01:17:07,561 --> 01:17:09,339
and I went to headquarters
and I saw what he's hiding.

1190
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:10,964
- What I'm hiding.
- He's lying to us.

1191
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:12,566
- Oh, dear.
- -He's lying to all of us

1192
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:14,110
about what the victory project
actually is.

1193
01:17:14,134 --> 01:17:14,903
- He's trapped us here.
- Alice...

1194
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:16,136
Trapped?

1195
01:17:17,738 --> 01:17:20,607
I hope no one feels trapped.
Do you feel trapped?

1196
01:17:20,674 --> 01:17:21,674
Violet?

1197
01:17:23,277 --> 01:17:25,145
Peg?

1198
01:17:26,915 --> 01:17:28,749
This is your psychosis.

1199
01:17:28,817 --> 01:17:32,753
You are experiencing trust
as a feeling of entrapment,

1200
01:17:32,821 --> 01:17:35,122
yet you trust every day.

1201
01:17:35,857 --> 01:17:37,157
We all do.

1202
01:17:37,224 --> 01:17:40,694
Tonight, you've trusted us
in your home.

1203
01:17:43,197 --> 01:17:45,632
Just like I trusted you
in my bedroom.

1204
01:17:54,641 --> 01:17:56,677
Alice?

1205
01:17:56,743 --> 01:17:58,178
Do you remember that?

1206
01:18:01,381 --> 01:18:04,051
He's... he's trying
to create a world.

1207
01:18:04,117 --> 01:18:06,095
- If you want to articulate
your own argument...
- He's using us.

1208
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:09,156
- Try using your own words,
Alice.
- He's using all of us.

1209
01:18:09,223 --> 01:18:11,191
- In your own words!
- What's in this food?

1210
01:18:11,258 --> 01:18:13,060
Let's talk about that!

1211
01:18:13,126 --> 01:18:15,271
- Where did it come from? Huh?
- Oh,
I'm sorry, everyone.

1212
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,673
- I'm sorry.
- Let's just think about it.

1213
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:18,799
- I'm sorry, Violet.
- Victory milk.

1214
01:18:18,867 --> 01:18:20,743
- This is... this is an anomaly.
- Victory meat.
Victory eggs.

1215
01:18:20,767 --> 01:18:22,178
- It doesn't usually happen.
- It all comes from him.

1216
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:24,004
She's very sick

1217
01:18:24,071 --> 01:18:25,816
- and she will get
the help that she needs...
- Everything we're told...

1218
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:26,851
- I promise you both.
- Everything we are given

1219
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:27,875
comes from him!

1220
01:18:27,909 --> 01:18:29,142
And it's all about control.

1221
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:30,677
It's all about control.

1222
01:18:30,744 --> 01:18:32,814
We wouldn't even...
He might be poisoning the food!

1223
01:18:32,881 --> 01:18:34,114
Enough!

1224
01:18:36,116 --> 01:18:37,484
We come to your house,

1225
01:18:38,252 --> 01:18:39,520
we sit at your table,

1226
01:18:39,586 --> 01:18:43,357
and you insult
and degrade my husband?

1227
01:18:43,423 --> 01:18:45,158
He invites you
to be a part of something

1228
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:47,494
as extraordinary as he is,

1229
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:51,064
and you sit there
like a spoiled brat,

1230
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:53,433
demanding answers
to questions you've made up.

1231
01:18:55,202 --> 01:18:58,138
There's a pattern, isn't there?

1232
01:18:58,205 --> 01:19:01,775
A pattern of selfish,
pampered whining.

1233
01:19:04,177 --> 01:19:06,480
Or is it just a desperation
to be exciting?

1234
01:19:07,648 --> 01:19:09,449
Hm?

1235
01:19:09,516 --> 01:19:11,618
Spitting in the face
of this opportunity.

1236
01:19:13,353 --> 01:19:18,625
It's heartbreaking that your
sad, desperate paranoia

1237
01:19:18,692 --> 01:19:20,794
could destroy
what we're trying to build.

1238
01:19:22,462 --> 01:19:23,463
Hm?

1239
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,536
Well, I won't listen to your
pathetic ranting any longer.

1240
01:19:31,204 --> 01:19:33,173
Frank, honey?

1241
01:19:33,975 --> 01:19:35,509
I'll be in the car.

1242
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:46,286
Well...

1243
01:19:46,353 --> 01:19:49,723
Jack, I think you may have
overserved your wife.

1244
01:19:54,261 --> 01:19:55,495
Thank you.

1245
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:18,752
I was expecting
so much more from you.

1246
01:20:28,128 --> 01:20:30,330
Good luck, Alice.

1247
01:20:33,133 --> 01:20:35,202
Jack, let's talk.

1248
01:21:37,764 --> 01:21:40,600
Did you enjoy yourself tonight?

1249
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:42,335
What?

1250
01:21:42,402 --> 01:21:44,504
No, I didn't
enjoy myself tonight.

1251
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:47,674
You planned a whole evening
to sabotage me.

1252
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:52,746
No! No, I would never
do that to you.

1253
01:21:52,814 --> 01:21:55,449
I would never do that to you.
I love you.

1254
01:21:57,551 --> 01:22:00,654
I'm trying...
I'm trying to save us.

1255
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:04,291
You're trying to save us
by going out there.

1256
01:22:05,827 --> 01:22:09,063
Yes, because I saw
a plane crash. I told you.

1257
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:14,135
But, Jack, everything I said
at that table is true.

1258
01:22:14,202 --> 01:22:15,837
Frank even admitted it to me.

1259
01:22:15,903 --> 01:22:17,771
He admitted it to me
in the kitchen.

1260
01:22:17,839 --> 01:22:20,908
That's why I did that.
That's why
all of that happened.

1261
01:22:20,975 --> 01:22:22,275
He wouldn't have done that.

1262
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:32,486
Jack...

1263
01:22:32,552 --> 01:22:34,956
Everyone is acting
like I'm crazy.

1264
01:22:36,224 --> 01:22:38,291
And I'm not crazy.

1265
01:22:40,393 --> 01:22:42,629
And I need you to listen to me.

1266
01:22:45,233 --> 01:22:47,601
I need you to listen to me.

1267
01:22:51,304 --> 01:22:53,406
Hey.

1268
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:57,511
Hey. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

1269
01:23:04,218 --> 01:23:05,853
To me...

1270
01:23:08,156 --> 01:23:09,523
You are...

1271
01:23:10,457 --> 01:23:12,592
You are bigger than all of this.

1272
01:23:15,362 --> 01:23:16,630
Mm-hm.

1273
01:23:18,266 --> 01:23:20,367
You are bigger than victory.

1274
01:23:21,301 --> 01:23:22,904
You are bigger than frank.

1275
01:23:25,405 --> 01:23:26,473
I believe in you.

1276
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:28,408
<i>I believe in you.</i>

1277
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:33,747
I don't believe in him.

1278
01:23:35,615 --> 01:23:37,417
And I don't trust him.

1279
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:41,022
And I don't trust this place.

1280
01:23:44,491 --> 01:23:47,594
And I don't want
to be here anymore.

1281
01:23:51,299 --> 01:23:53,433
I don't want to be here anymore.

1282
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,936
And we need to leave.

1283
01:23:57,839 --> 01:24:01,008
We need to leave.
And we can go anywhere.

1284
01:24:01,075 --> 01:24:03,777
We can go anywhere and we can
create our own world,

1285
01:24:03,845 --> 01:24:06,047
and it will be you and me
and we'll be okay.

1286
01:24:06,113 --> 01:24:09,482
And it's not about where we go,
it's just that we're together.

1287
01:24:11,751 --> 01:24:14,822
Please? Please? Please?

1288
01:24:19,927 --> 01:24:21,128
Please?

1289
01:24:25,532 --> 01:24:26,868
Please.

1290
01:24:28,169 --> 01:24:29,837
Okay.

1291
01:24:32,739 --> 01:24:35,375
Okay?

1292
01:24:36,978 --> 01:24:38,913
Okay.

1293
01:24:43,351 --> 01:24:44,819
Okay?

1294
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:48,055
Okay.

1295
01:24:58,632 --> 01:25:00,868
I love you. I love you.

1296
01:25:02,669 --> 01:25:03,905
But we need to go tonight.

1297
01:25:03,971 --> 01:25:06,173
We need to go.
We can't be here.

1298
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,608
Hey. Hey.

1299
01:25:19,586 --> 01:25:21,488
I love you.
Let's go.

1300
01:25:21,554 --> 01:25:23,057
I love you.

1301
01:25:24,658 --> 01:25:26,861
- Okay.
- 'Kay. Okay.

1302
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:50,784
Jack?

1303
01:25:50,851 --> 01:25:53,955
I packed us a snack in case
we drive all night long,

1304
01:25:54,021 --> 01:25:56,623
but I think I packed everything.

1305
01:25:57,892 --> 01:25:59,060
Let's go.

1306
01:26:03,763 --> 01:26:06,499
Baby, let's go. Come on.

1307
01:26:06,566 --> 01:26:08,568
I'm sorry.

1308
01:26:10,972 --> 01:26:12,073
What?

1309
01:26:13,908 --> 01:26:15,843
I love you so much, Alice.

1310
01:26:17,744 --> 01:26:19,113
Baby, what's wrong?

1311
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,715
I tried so hard
to keep this from happening.

1312
01:26:22,782 --> 01:26:24,986
- What? Let's...
- Please believe...

1313
01:26:25,052 --> 01:26:26,586
Baby, we need to go.
We need to go.

1314
01:26:26,653 --> 01:26:29,423
Baby, you need to drive.
We need to go. Go. Whoa.

1315
01:26:29,489 --> 01:26:32,259
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No. No! No!

1316
01:26:32,326 --> 01:26:34,996
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Alice.
-No, Jack, please!
I can be better!

1317
01:26:35,062 --> 01:26:37,140
- I can be better! I'm so sorry!
- Alice, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1318
01:26:37,164 --> 01:26:38,641
- Let me be better, please!
- I'm sorry!

1319
01:26:38,665 --> 01:26:39,843
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Baby, please!

1320
01:26:39,867 --> 01:26:41,107
- Let me be better.
- I'm sorry!

1321
01:26:41,135 --> 01:26:42,511
- Get off me!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1322
01:26:42,535 --> 01:26:43,612
- Let me be better!
- I'm sorry.

1323
01:26:43,636 --> 01:26:45,772
- I'm so...
- Jack, please!

1324
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:50,411
They're hurting me! No! No!

1325
01:26:50,478 --> 01:26:54,315
No! Jack! They're hurting me!

1326
01:26:54,382 --> 01:26:56,117
They're hurting me!

1327
01:26:56,183 --> 01:26:57,584
Fuck!

1328
01:27:01,322 --> 01:27:02,923
Fuck!

1329
01:27:19,273 --> 01:27:23,543
No, please, please.

01:29:26,534 --> 01:29:27,935
You're so late.

1349
01:29:28,002 --> 01:29:29,769
I thought you were gonna
be home by 10:00.

1350
01:29:29,837 --> 01:29:32,039
Yeah. So did I.

1351
01:29:33,607 --> 01:29:35,276
Surgery ran really long.

1352
01:29:36,477 --> 01:29:37,811
Well, I'm starving.

1353
01:29:37,878 --> 01:29:38,946
I haven't eaten.

1354
01:29:40,314 --> 01:29:41,748
Why not?

1355
01:29:41,815 --> 01:29:44,418
I wasn't sure what you wanted
and you never texted me back.

1356
01:29:51,058 --> 01:29:53,961
I don't have my phone
in the or, Jack.

1357
01:29:54,028 --> 01:29:55,963
Well, it'd be nice to know that.

1358
01:30:10,044 --> 01:30:12,012
Is the hot water
still not working?

1359
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:14,048
Called the guy.
He couldn't come today.

1360
01:30:19,687 --> 01:30:21,555
Okay, well,
if I can't take a shower,

1361
01:30:21,622 --> 01:30:23,090
- I gotta go to bed.
- Come on.

1362
01:30:23,157 --> 01:30:24,558
I haven't gotten
to see you all day.

1363
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:26,403
I know, I'm sorry,
but I'm really tired, baby.

1364
01:30:26,427 --> 01:30:29,363
- Dance with me.
- No. No, Jack. Just stop.

1365
01:30:30,898 --> 01:30:32,633
I just finished a 30-hour shift,

1366
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,901
I sewed up 12 people,

1367
01:30:33,968 --> 01:30:35,502
and I gotta be back
in six hours,

1368
01:30:35,569 --> 01:30:36,736
and I'm so tired.

1369
01:30:36,804 --> 01:30:39,039

<i>Or satisfied?</i>

1374
01:31:06,066 --> 01:31:11,272
<i>Modern society

1375
01:31:11,338 --> 01:31:15,409
<i>and driven us

1376
01:31:15,476 --> 01:31:18,579
<i>I see that version of yourself

01:31:46,206 --> 01:31:49,109
Oh, thank god!

1384
01:31:49,176 --> 01:31:51,378
Okay, don't shout it
to the whole neighborhood.

1385
01:31:51,445 --> 01:31:53,714
- I'm here.
- Oh! I missed you so much.

1386
01:31:53,781 --> 01:31:55,191
I started writing gossip
in a journal.

1387
01:31:55,215 --> 01:31:56,917
You did? I should read it then.

1388
01:31:56,984 --> 01:31:58,319
- So sad. Hi.
- Hi!

1389
01:31:58,385 --> 01:32:00,154
- Wow, you look sensational!
- Thank you.

1390
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,689
I feel better. I feel good.

1391
01:32:01,755 --> 01:32:03,757
- I'm so happy you're back.
- Me, too.

1392
01:32:03,824 --> 01:32:05,125
Hi, Jack.

1393
01:32:05,192 --> 01:32:06,960
- Wow! Look at this car.
- You like that?

1394
01:32:07,027 --> 01:32:08,738
Dean's gonna try to have sex
with this vehicle.

1395
01:32:08,762 --> 01:32:10,597
Where is Dean?

1396
01:32:10,664 --> 01:32:12,566
He's playing golf with bill.

1397
01:32:12,633 --> 01:32:13,967
Honey, you should go.

1398
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:15,478
All you've been doing
is looking after me,

1399
01:32:15,502 --> 01:32:17,004
and you deserve
to have some fun.

1400
01:32:17,071 --> 01:32:19,039
Yeah, go. Leave her.
She's mine now.

1401
01:32:19,106 --> 01:32:20,941
- We're gonna garden.
- What?

1402
01:32:21,008 --> 01:32:22,208
Just look at plants and drink.

1403
01:32:22,242 --> 01:32:23,453
- Right.
- I don't have a garden.

1404
01:32:23,477 --> 01:32:24,545
Okay!

1405
01:32:27,715 --> 01:32:29,183

1409
01:32:44,031 --> 01:32:45,399
Violet would not stand up.

1410
01:32:45,466 --> 01:32:47,110
It was like her ass was glued
to the chair.

1411
01:32:47,134 --> 01:32:49,103
And peg!
Peg's face was so red,

1412
01:32:49,169 --> 01:32:51,372
I thought her head
was gonna pop off.

1413
01:32:51,939 --> 01:32:53,240
Mm.

1414

Peg is, um... Peter's wife.
Always pregnant.

01:32:58,045 --> 01:33:00,647
- Right. Yes. Yeah.
- Kinda... yeah.

1416
01:33:00,714 --> 01:33:02,216
Right, okay. Of course. Sorry.

1417
01:33:02,282 --> 01:33:06,620
My head's been a bit of a blur
since the treatment.

1418
01:33:07,688 --> 01:33:09,223
- Yeah. Okay.
- It's okay.

1419
01:33:09,289 --> 01:33:12,493
- It'll all come back to you.
- Yeah. Okay.

1420
01:33:12,559 --> 01:33:14,528
Oh, my goodness!

1421
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:16,130
Uh-oh! Here they come.

1422
01:33:16,196 --> 01:33:20,334
Oh, my goodness! Hi!

1423
01:33:20,401 --> 01:33:22,102
Did you see the sign?

1424
01:33:22,169 --> 01:33:24,271
It is the most beautiful sign
I've seen in my life!

1425
01:33:24,338 --> 01:33:26,240
Did you hire professional
artists to paint it?

1426
01:33:26,306 --> 01:33:27,852
- We made it ourselves.
- You did? No, you didn't.

1427
01:33:27,876 --> 01:33:30,110
Quick, show me. Come show me!

1428
01:33:30,177 --> 01:33:32,246
I did this part.

1429
01:33:32,312 --> 01:33:34,816
Can you point to it?
Which bit? Go! Go! Go!

1430
01:33:34,883 --> 01:33:36,283
I did the sunshine
and the letter...

1431
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:37,985
You did the sunshine and...

1432
01:33:52,533 --> 01:33:54,334
<i>There is beauty in control.</i>

1433
01:33:54,401 --> 01:33:56,637
<i>There is grace in symmetry.</i>

1434
01:33:56,703 --> 01:33:58,172
<i>We move as one.</i>

1435
01:33:58,238 --> 01:33:59,940
<i>There is beauty in control.</i>

1436
01:34:00,007 --> 01:34:02,476

<i>There is beauty in control.

1440
01:34:09,716 --> 01:34:13,454
<i>There is beauty in control.

01:34:15,722 --> 01:34:19,760
<i>There is beauty in control.

1443
01:34:19,828 --> 01:34:21,930
<i>We move as one.</i>

1444
01:34:24,798 --> 01:34:26,667
- Hi.
- Hi.

1445
01:34:28,268 --> 01:34:30,304
- It smells amazing.
- Thank you.

1446
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:36,577
- How was your day?
- I don't even remember now.

1447
01:34:36,643 --> 01:34:38,479
Good.

1448
01:34:38,545 --> 01:34:42,416
Well, you're a little early,
but I have...

1449
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:45,419
So many things to finish.

1450
01:34:45,486 --> 01:34:48,823
So I'm gonna need to go
and get things out of the oven.

1451
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:52,326
No, it's gonna burn. No.

1452
01:34:55,930 --> 01:34:58,232
We'll eat first...

1453
01:34:58,298 --> 01:35:00,334
And that should build up
your stamina.

1454
01:35:04,204 --> 01:35:06,039
Oh, my god, that's beautiful.

Okay.

Baby, you're having
another episode.

01:38:40,988 --> 01:38:43,057
Just take a deep breath.

- It's okay.
Just breathe, Alice.

1509
01:38:47,929 --> 01:38:49,563
That's good. Just breathe.

1510
01:38:51,065 --> 01:38:53,767
That's good.

1511
01:39:02,944 --> 01:39:04,778
What did you do?

1512
01:39:20,427 --> 01:39:22,796
Alice, please, just stay calm.

1513
01:39:25,499 --> 01:39:27,734
It's gonna be okay.
I can explain.

1514
01:39:28,502 --> 01:39:29,937
What the fuck is going on?

1515
01:39:30,004 --> 01:39:31,438
Look at me, you're my wife.

1516
01:39:31,505 --> 01:39:33,449
- What the fuck is happening?
- I love you. I love you.

1517
01:39:33,473 --> 01:39:36,510
Oh, no. No.

1518
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,813
You can't say that.
You don't love me.

1519
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,082
-No, don't do that.
Don't do that!
-You don't love me.

1520
01:39:41,149 --> 01:39:42,616
Alice, just think!

1521
01:39:42,682 --> 01:39:45,652
Think about your life
and what you actually want.

1522
01:39:51,792 --> 01:39:53,961
- You're psychotic.
- Mm-mm.

1523
01:39:54,028 --> 01:39:55,529
I had a life.

1524
01:39:56,164 --> 01:39:57,364
You took my life.

1525
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:58,799
No, I saved your life.

1526
01:39:58,866 --> 01:40:00,835
- That's not true.
- No, listen to me.

1527
01:40:00,902 --> 01:40:02,369
You worked all the time!

1528
01:40:02,435 --> 01:40:05,472
I wanted to work!
I loved working! What?

1529
01:40:05,539 --> 01:40:06,908
You were miserable.

1530
01:40:06,974 --> 01:40:09,811
You were so unhappy.
You hated your life!

1531
01:40:09,877 --> 01:40:12,746
It was my life!

1532
01:40:14,648 --> 01:40:16,349
My life!

1533
01:40:16,416 --> 01:40:18,219
You don't get
to take that from me!

1534
01:40:18,286 --> 01:40:19,987
I gave this to you!

1535
01:40:22,489 --> 01:40:24,959
I gave you all of this, Alice!

1536
01:40:28,495 --> 01:40:30,797
We are lucky to be here!

1537
01:40:34,634 --> 01:40:35,970
Frank built this world

1538
01:40:36,037 --> 01:40:39,606
so that we can live
the life that we deserve!

1539
01:40:40,707 --> 01:40:42,642
I have to leave every day

1540
01:40:42,709 --> 01:40:44,578
just to make enough money
to keep us here,

1541
01:40:44,644 --> 01:40:47,048
and I fucking hate
every minute of it.

1542
01:40:47,114 --> 01:40:49,683
I fucking hate it, Alice!

1543
01:40:50,717 --> 01:40:53,054
You get to stay here.

1544
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,922
And you're happy!

1545
01:40:57,892 --> 01:40:58,926
You're happy.

1546
01:41:01,195 --> 01:41:02,662
That's okay.

1547
01:41:07,168 --> 01:41:09,103
Alice.

1548
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:10,770
We're perfect in here.

1549
01:41:14,809 --> 01:41:17,044
Don't you want to be perfect
with me?

1550
01:41:24,718 --> 01:41:26,686
No. No.

1551
01:41:26,753 --> 01:41:29,756
You made me feel like
I was crazy.

1552
01:41:32,326 --> 01:41:34,594
I came to you...

1553
01:41:36,163 --> 01:41:39,699
And you made me feel like
I was fucking crazy.

1554
01:41:39,766 --> 01:41:42,169
Alice, I'm so sorry.

1555
01:41:44,038 --> 01:41:46,941
But I don't have to
lie to you anymore.

1556
01:41:49,010 --> 01:41:50,543
Alice...

1557
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:52,880
- Alice, please, I love you.
- I know.

1558
01:41:52,947 --> 01:41:55,182
You know I love you.
I would do anything for you.

1559
01:41:55,249 --> 01:41:56,583
You're my whole life.

1560
01:41:57,617 --> 01:42:00,487
I love you. Oh, god.

1561
01:42:00,553 --> 01:42:02,665
It's not about where we are,
it's just that we're together.

1562
01:42:02,689 --> 01:42:05,126
You said that.
You said that to me.

1563
01:42:07,295 --> 01:42:08,896
Alice.

1564
01:42:15,702 --> 01:42:18,105
- Alice, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my god.

1565
01:42:21,075 --> 01:42:22,575
Are there others?

1566
01:42:24,412 --> 01:42:28,015
Are there other people like me?
Where are their bodies?

1567
01:42:28,082 --> 01:42:30,151
- I don't know where they are.
- Oh, god.

1568
01:42:30,217 --> 01:42:31,451
I don't know where they are.

1569
01:42:31,518 --> 01:42:33,753
I don't even know
who the men are. I swear.

1570
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:36,824
It's not our business.

1571
01:42:36,891 --> 01:42:40,127
A man's responsible for his
own wife and nothing else.

1572
01:42:44,564 --> 01:42:46,733
So all the wives
are trapped here?

1573
01:42:50,637 --> 01:42:52,907
- Oh, my god,
the kids.
- No.

1574
01:42:52,974 --> 01:42:54,974
- Oh, my god.
- No. No, Alice,
the kids aren't real.

1575
01:42:55,009 --> 01:42:56,609
- Oh, god.
- They're not real.

1576
01:42:56,676 --> 01:42:58,712
Don't worry about them.
It's you and me.

1577
01:42:58,778 --> 01:43:00,147
- Look at me.
- No, I...

1578
01:43:00,214 --> 01:43:02,316
Don't worry about them.
Look at me.

1579
01:43:02,383 --> 01:43:04,218
Look at me. It's you and me.

1580
01:43:04,285 --> 01:43:05,719
Okay? It's you and me.

1581
01:43:05,785 --> 01:43:07,620
Stay with me.

1582
01:43:07,687 --> 01:43:10,124
-I just need... mm-hm.
-It's okay.
We're gonna be happy.

1583
01:43:10,191 --> 01:43:11,902
- I just need a second.
- We're gonna be happy here.

1584
01:43:11,926 --> 01:43:13,870
- I just need a second. Yeah?
- We're gonna be happy.

1585
01:43:13,894 --> 01:43:15,062
No, Jack.

1586
01:43:15,129 --> 01:43:17,131
No, Jack, please.

1587
01:43:17,198 --> 01:43:21,936
Stop. Stop. Alice!

1588
01:43:22,003 --> 01:43:23,871
No, I need a second...

1589
01:43:23,938 --> 01:43:27,441
Get off me! I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

1590
01:43:27,507 --> 01:43:30,077
- Get off me!
- Alice, stop it!

1591
01:43:30,144 --> 01:43:33,280
- No! No!
- Stop it, Alice!

1592
01:43:33,347 --> 01:43:35,182
No. No!

1593
01:43:35,249 --> 01:43:36,917
Stop!

1594
01:43:40,388 --> 01:43:41,688
<i>Alice?</i>

1595
01:43:42,289 --> 01:43:43,790
Alice?

1596
01:43:49,997 --> 01:43:51,531
A-Alice?

1597
01:43:53,633 --> 01:43:55,169
What happened?

1598
01:44:10,017 --> 01:44:11,052
What is it?

1599
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:12,619
<i>Jack chambers is dead.</i>

1600
01:44:14,754 --> 01:44:16,057
Alice, listen to me.

1601
01:44:16,123 --> 01:44:17,467
No, I need
to tell you something, bunny.

1602
01:44:17,491 --> 01:44:18,526
No, you need to leave.

1603
01:44:18,591 --> 01:44:20,161
No. This world isn't real.

1604
01:44:20,227 --> 01:44:23,030
- Alice, they're gonna kill you.
- Frank created a program.

1605
01:44:23,097 --> 01:44:25,765
- And he created a world
and its...
- I know. I know.

1606
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:27,177
- And they're gonna kill you.
- What?

1607
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:28,869
They're gonna kill you
in the real world.

1608
01:44:28,936 --> 01:44:29,870
- They're gonna kill
your real body.
- What?

1609
01:44:29,937 --> 01:44:31,038
- You need to go.
- What?

1610
01:44:31,105 --> 01:44:32,940
Okay? Oh, my god.

1611
01:44:33,007 --> 01:44:36,576
Alice, if a man dies here,
he dies in the real world.

1612
01:44:36,643 --> 01:44:38,055
Jack can't put you
back in this time.

1613
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:39,755
He can't put you back in
like he did before.

1614
01:44:39,779 --> 01:44:41,315
You need to exit again,
right now.

1615
01:44:41,382 --> 01:44:43,583
Alice, you gotta go.
You can drive. Take Jack's car!

1616
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:45,953
- You need to
go to headquarters.
- Bunny, answer me!

1617
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:48,721
- You need to go right now!
- What do you mean, you know?

1618
01:44:51,892 --> 01:44:54,161
Listen...

1619
01:44:54,228 --> 01:44:55,229
I've always known.

1620
01:44:59,467 --> 01:45:00,467
I chose this.

1621
01:45:04,604 --> 01:45:08,075
My kids are here.

1622
01:45:08,142 --> 01:45:10,344
- Bunny, your kids aren't real.
- No, they are.

1623
01:45:10,411 --> 01:45:12,379
- Kids aren't real here.
- No, they are.

1624
01:45:12,446 --> 01:45:13,957
-Nothing is real.
-They're real to me.
They're real to me, Alice.

1625
01:45:13,981 --> 01:45:15,392
- Nothing...
- Because here they're alive!

1626
01:45:15,416 --> 01:45:17,118
In here, I didn't lose them.

1627
01:45:18,052 --> 01:45:19,954
Here, I... I can keep them.

1628
01:45:21,355 --> 01:45:22,355
Don't you see?

1629
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,896
What... do they know?

1630
01:45:28,963 --> 01:45:30,498
What about the women,
do they know?

1631
01:45:30,564 --> 01:45:31,899
No.

1632
01:45:33,267 --> 01:45:34,902
They don't know.

1633
01:45:46,113 --> 01:45:47,281
Go.

1634
01:45:48,748 --> 01:45:50,251
You have to go.

1635
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:05,232
Christ, Alice,
whose blood is that?

1636
01:46:05,732 --> 01:46:06,967
Jack!

1637
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:12,206
What's going on?
Where's Jack? Dean?

1638
01:46:12,273 --> 01:46:16,010
Go back inside, Alice.
Sweetheart? Stop.

1639
01:46:16,076 --> 01:46:18,145
Where is Jack?
What is she doing?

1640
01:46:18,212 --> 01:46:19,212
Jack!

1641
01:46:24,751 --> 01:46:26,053
Honey, let's go inside.

1642
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:28,155
We have to go inside, please.

1643
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:30,257
It's the kids.

1644
01:46:33,227 --> 01:46:34,761
Where is Jack?

1645
01:46:41,035 --> 01:46:44,505
Peg. I need you to go inside
to the kids, peg!

1646
01:46:44,572 --> 01:46:46,407
Peg, she is unwell.

1647
01:46:54,381 --> 01:46:56,150
They said nothing like this
could happen!

1648
01:46:56,217 --> 01:46:57,217
Shut up, bill!

1649
01:46:57,251 --> 01:46:58,385
They promised it was safe!

1650
01:46:58,452 --> 01:46:59,752
Jack!

1651
01:47:05,792 --> 01:47:09,263
<i>It's a reminder of who we are!</i>

1652
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:12,366
We came to save the world
from itself.

1653
01:47:12,433 --> 01:47:16,937
<i>We are a vanguard of a promise.
We are the future.</i>

1654
01:47:17,004 --> 01:47:19,073
<i>We are a brotherhood
of brilliance,</i>

1655
01:47:19,139 --> 01:47:22,209
<i>every single one of us.</i>

1656
01:47:22,276 --> 01:47:23,877
<i>Approaching victory portal.</i>

1657
01:47:23,944 --> 01:47:27,780
<i>Prepare to exit
in ten, nine, eight...</i>

1658
01:47:27,848 --> 01:47:30,451
- Whose world is this?
- Ours!

1659
01:47:30,517 --> 01:47:32,620
<i>- Whose world is this?
- Ours!</i>

1660
01:47:32,686 --> 01:47:35,022
<i>- Whose world is it?
- Ours!</i>

1661
01:47:35,089 --> 01:47:36,789
<i>- Whose world is it?
- Ours!</i>

1662
01:47:36,857 --> 01:47:39,126
<i>- Whose world is it?
- Alice!</i>

1663
01:47:39,927 --> 01:47:42,596
Go! Go, Alice! Go!

1664
01:47:42,663 --> 01:47:43,998
No, no!

1665
01:47:48,969 --> 01:47:51,872
- Get off me!
- They'll find you!

1666
01:48:24,738 --> 01:48:28,976
Please, please, please!
Don't be such a fucking...

1667
01:48:29,043 --> 01:48:33,047
They said it would not happen!

1668
01:49:37,578 --> 01:49:38,912
Fuck!

1669
01:50:11,578 --> 01:50:13,280
Stop her, you idiots!

1670
01:50:18,419 --> 01:50:19,920
Stop her!

1671
01:50:32,599 --> 01:50:33,599
No, no!

1672
01:50:57,391 --> 01:50:59,393
<i>Security level is red.</i>

1673
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:01,295
<i>We are under a shelter in place.</i>

1674
01:51:01,361 --> 01:51:04,298
<i>Stay inside and await
further instructions.</i>

1675

<i>Attention, victory residents.</i>

1676
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:08,735
<i>Security level is red.</i>

1677
01:51:08,803 --> 01:51:10,304
Where is she?

1678
01:51:10,370 --> 01:51:11,873
<i>Huge crash.</i>

1679
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:15,275
<i>The two lead cars and Collins.
Collins is dead, sir.</i>

1680
01:51:15,342 --> 01:51:17,644
Listen to me,
you do not let her exit!

1681
01:51:17,711 --> 01:51:19,379
<i>If she gets there,
she gets through.</i>

1682
01:51:19,446 --> 01:51:21,916
<i>Who's gonna put her back in?</i>

1683
01:51:21,982 --> 01:51:23,885
<i>Frank?</i>

1684
01:51:23,952 --> 01:51:27,120
<i>Frank, what do we do? Sir?</i>

1685
01:51:30,825 --> 01:51:34,561
You stupid, stupid man.

1686
01:51:48,075 --> 01:51:49,576
It's my turn now.

1687
01:52:14,903 --> 01:52:17,404
No!

1688
01:52:17,906 --> 01:52:18,906
No!

1689
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,109
Come on! Shit!

1690
01:53:41,288 --> 01:53:43,657
Don't leave me.

1691
01:53:53,367 --> 01:53:54,902
<i>You and me.</i>
