perfect, baby.

That's right. That's good.

a little drink.

Yeah, pour yourself
a little drink.

Look at me and stay focused.

-(man) Right here, baby.

I'm trying to focus!

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,387
-Not too hard, Peg.
-I'm trying to focus!

19
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,097
(man 3) The tassels
are weighing you down.

20
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,849
I think you gotta lose them
and take them off!

21
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,225
Take the shirt off!

22
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,727
I have it, I have it, I have it.

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,811

29
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,697
That wasn't my fault! Hang on.

30
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,866
-That is my drink.
-No, she pushed it off my head.

31
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,743
-I'll finish that.
-No, but I can win.

32
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,453
She just budged me.
It's not fair!

33
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,579
I know you can win.

34
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:19,955
-Mm-kay. Are you sure?
-I know you can--

35
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,416
-Mm-kay. Yeah.
-(both laughing)

36
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:25,044
-You dropped it...
-It got on my dress.

37
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,299

39
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,552
-can you please use an ashtray?
-(Dean) What?

40
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,221
Because if it gets on the rug,
it's impossible to get out.

41

Pete, your wife is drunk.

42
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,516
She's babbling
nonsense right now.

43
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,518
And she's pregnant,
and so she needs another drink,

44
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,602
get that baby healthy.

45
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,354

-Look at this man. Look at this.
-You know...

00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,279

It's just like the one he has.

51
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,615
-So gracious.
-Look at this. Look at this man.

52

to kiss me right now?

It's your turn. Take the wheel!

-Take the wheel! Take the wheel!
-Oh, my God! What?

No, I'm not ready! Oh, my God!

Alice, you're getting
so much better.

80
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,302
(Alice) I am. I feel better.

so much better.

she wanted to play, which, mm...

93
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,418
She's never
played tennis before, ever.

94
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,921
She has a cocktail in one hand,
a racket in the other,

95

and, Jack...
she didn't spill a drop.

96
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,509
It was... (inhales)

97
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:41,180
quite possibly the sexiest
thing I have ever seen.

that Frank actually has

00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,771
a tennis court at his house?

102
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,148
-We'll find out, won't we?
-Yeah.

103
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,234
Oh, and babe, tell me...

104
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,862
how many people
are gonna be at this party,

105
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,865
because I need to know
how much tuna salad to make.

106
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:01,784
Mm.

107
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:04,411
-What?
-Frank doesn't like tuna.

108
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,372
-What?
-He doesn't like it.

109
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,998
-Are you being serious?
-Mm-hm.

110
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,167
Baby, why didn't you tell me?

111
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,045
I was planning on it being
the centerpiece to my dish.

112
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,422
-Alice, not the centerpiece.
-(chuckling) Shut up.

Don't.

118
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,142
-Was that a big drill?
-Don't.

119
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,061
-Was that an explosion?
-Don't.

120
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,021
Are those
the progressive materials?

121
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,023
You can tell me.
I'm really discreet.

122
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,400
-I can keep a secret.
-I'm going to be late.

123
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,026
No, wait, you-- you can't...
you can't leave.

-Why not?

'Cause you're not feeling well.

126
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,407
-Oh, I'm not?
-Yeah, I'm so sorry.

127
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,117
I forgot to tell you, but
you're not feeling very well.

128

is if we stay home all day,

129

and kiss you and cook for--

-No.

to join us today.

a warm welcome...

(Bunny) Yeah, of course
Margaret wasn't in class.

169

00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,328
-Again?
-Unwrap it from her neck, Fred!

173
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,247
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

174
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,623
-(Bunny) Poor guy.
-Oh! I met her.

175
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,832
-Mm!
-The new wife.

176
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:01,667
(whispers) Violet.

177
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,709
-Mm-hm.
-What's she like?

178
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:06,255
She's like a beautiful,
terrified, baby deer.

179
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,924
(chuckles) Yeah. Apparently,
the husband's a real goober.

180
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,968
(Alice) Well, Jack better
recruit somebody soon.

181
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,178
Please! Dean says Jack's
about to get promoted.

182
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,304
-I hope so.
-Mm-hm.

183
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,806
You're gonna be right behind us.

184
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:16,974
What are you making
for the party?

185
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,350
-My deviled eggs.
-Oh, my God.

186
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,977
-Jack's gonna be CEO.
-(laughs)

187
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,812
Hold this, please. That's it.

188
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,355
-I'm calling Santa.
-(Alice) Uh-oh.

189
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,773
-You give me no choice.
-Oh, no.

190
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,233
I have to call him. I have to!

191
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,693
That's why Santa
gave me his number.

192
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,403
He said I had to call
if you were bad.

193
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,446
I'm calling him.
I wish I had a choice.

194
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,323
-Give me that.
-But we stopped!

195
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,700
-No. Give it to me!
-(girl giggling)

196
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,619
(Alice humming simple melody)

197
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,681
(inhaling deeply)

198
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,182
(vocal sigh)

199
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,853

200
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,987

(man humming melody)

202
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,882
(Frank on radio)  All that
matters is how you respond

203
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,675
in those moments.

204
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,928
I trust that you will prove
to yourself,

205
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,264
to everyone who has
ever doubted you,

206
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:43,769
that you are worthy
of the life you desire.

207
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,395
(Alice humming melody)

208
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,189
(Frank on radio)
Until tomorrow.

209
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,275
("Tears On My Pillow"
by Little Anthony & The
Imperials playing)

210
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,566
Oh, shit.

00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,319
(insects chirring)

212
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,287
(Frank on radio)
...'cause we choose to stay.

213
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,175
Hi.

214
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,844
Hi.

215
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,181
("Twilight" by The
Platters playing)

216
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,689
How was your day?

217
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,524
-So much better now.
-Mm-hm.

218
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,318
I made a roast.

219
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,695
-Mm?
-Mm-hm.

220
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,989
-What else?
-Mashed potatoes.

221
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,324
-What else?
-Green beans.

222
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,659
What else?

223
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,745
Stuffed tomatoes.

224
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,080
What else?

225
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:33,837
(whispering) What else?

226
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,013
(panting)

227
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,848
(moans deeply)

228
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,021

("Sh-Boom" by The
Chords playing)

233
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,943
There's so much... skin.

234
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,111
(Bunny) Ooh, why don't you go
find your brother, okay?

235
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,364
(Alice humming melody)

236
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,200
Okay, you have to stop humming
that song.

237
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,701
-What is it?
-I don't know.

238
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:47,911
I was hoping you could tell me.

239
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,621
It's been stuck in my head
for days.

240
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,665
Maybe it's a children's song.
Something your kids sing?

241
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,375
Oh, no, I don't have children.

242
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,835
-Oh.
-Mm. Don't get me started.

243
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,547
It's just not what we want.
We're having fun.

244
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,591
I live next door. You wouldn't
believe the things I've heard.

245
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,302
It's like they're on
a perpetual honeymoon.

246
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,721
No, Jack and Alice
only have time for each other.

247
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,390
(Alice) It's not what we want.

248
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,225
Plus, Bunny's kids
like me more than her, anyway.

249
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,643
(Bunny) That's true,
it's infuriating.

250
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,728
-(laughs deeply)
-(man humming melody faintly)

251
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,272
I think three is
a perfect number.

-Bill wants four.
-(man continues humming)

253
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,569
Well, once you have one,
it's all the same.

254
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,571
-Having a second...

(Bunny) Alice, how many babies
should Violet have?

257
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,410
Oh, at least seven.

("El Merengue!"

-Christ. Where have you been?

260
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,783
I've turned avoiding
talking to other people

261
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:09,909
into an Olympic sport.

262
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,829
-This place is incredible!
-You haven't seen half of it.

263
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,539
I could sleep in their bathtub
and they'd never find me.

264
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,999
I'm sure! Hi!

265
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,250
Hey!

266
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,044
(kids) May we interest you
in a cocktail?

267
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:23,131
-Uh, yes, you may. Thank you.
-Yes, very interested.

268
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,761
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

269
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,721
Thank you.

270
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,223
-They terrify me.
-They're so creepy.

271
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,683
I feel like they
sleep upside down.

272
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,769
Do they wear matching outfits
every day?

273
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,521
That little weirdo makes the
best Manhattan I've ever had.

274
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,898
We honeymooned in Sea Island.

275
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,691
-(gasping)
-(Bunny) Ohh!

276
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,485
-(Violet) What?
-We honeymooned in Sea Island.

277
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,402
Seriously?

278
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,904
Yeah, did you eat at Dominick's?

279
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,031
-I was a little nervous.
-(Bill chuckles)

280
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,574
Took a while to
get used to things.

281
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,451
Yeah. It takes a
minute to settle in.

282
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,286
-Yeah.
-But it gets easier, though.

283
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,372
-It does. Yeah.
-(sighs) Well, it--

284
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,581
I'm just really excited
to be here.

285
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,416
-So excited, I can't even--
-We couldn't tell.

286
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,211
To be honest, I've been
out of it since we arrived.

287
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,045
Yeah.

288
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,672
-Bill says it's the jetlag.
-(Bunny) Mm-hm.

289
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,840
It's all just been
a bit of a blur.

290
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,634
It's the desert air.
You'll get used to it.

291
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,136
That's what Dr.
Collins said, too.

292
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,472
He was so sweet to stop by.

293
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,099
-(Bill) And, Jack, you're...?
-(Jack) I'm a technical
engineer.

294
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,308
She should come shopping
with us.

295
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,893
(Jack) A different department
than Dean and Ted.

296
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,771
Yeah, technically a worse,
less important department.

297
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,065
I haven't really gotten
to talk to Frank very much.

298
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,025
Frank doesn't have to talk
to you.

299
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,027
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't--

300
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,405
You have no idea
how extraordinary he is.

301
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,781
Or what he can do.

302
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,408
You're lucky to even know
who he is,

303
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,201
let alone be standing
in his house.

304
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,287
-(Bunny and Violet laughing)
-I'm just excited. I'm sorry.

305
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,332
I was just excited. Okay.

306
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,167
(glass chiming)

307
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,336
-Oh! Guys. Go, go, go.
-(Dean) Ooh, here we go.

308
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,547
-(Violet) This way?
-Yeah, you should go in front.

309
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,633
(light chatter, laughter)

310
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,307
(Shelley) Gather
'round, everyone.

311
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,645
Now, usually,
we don't have the opportunity

312
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,939
to welcome couples in our home.

313
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,109
But on this occasion,
we just couldn't wait

314
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,820
to celebrate our
newest residents.

315
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,031
Bill, Violet...

316
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,576
I am so happy for you,

317
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,536
that you get to learn
from my husband...

318
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,247
and join this mission

319
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,207
and become a part
of this family.

320
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:27,422
Frank has built something
truly special.

321
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,010
What he's created
out here, it's...

322
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,387
It's a different way.

323
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,556
A better way.

324
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:40,018
-And we only have each other--
-(woman) Why are we here?

325
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,936
(man whispering tersely)

326
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,355
(whispering)
Let's go, right now.

327
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,901
We shouldn't be here.

328
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:54,240
-(whispering) What was that?
-(faint chatter)

329
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,867
(Frank) Now, now.

330
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,833
Margaret and Ted are
going through a difficult time.

331
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:11,674
Margaret's question is right.
It is the good question to ask.

332
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,094
Why the hell are we here?

333
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,096
-(chuckles)
-(scattered laughter)

334
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,227
Why, when this landscape
can seem so...

335
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:26,940
barren, so hard,
so dusty, so...

336
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,276
worthless?

337
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,738
Why not run?

338
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,740
Why not go back to safety,
status quo,

339
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,827
where it's safe,
where we should be?

340
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:44,499
No, I choose--
we choose to stand our ground.

341
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:45,708
Right?

342
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,879
To look harder, to dig deeper.

343
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:58,638
To mine that pure,
unbridled potential.

344
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:05,478
That gem of limitless
and unimaginable value.

345
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:11,109
It's just too easy to get
distracted by what seems.

346
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,488
Much more difficult, "braver,"
I would say...

347
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,409
to search for what could be.

348
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,163
-Dean...
-(Dean) Hm?

349
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,876
What is the enemy
of progress?

350
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,086
-Chaos.
-Yes.

351
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,964
-(shudders)
-(Dean chuckles)

352
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,509
Nasty word. Chaos.

353
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,805
Merciless foe, that chaos.

354
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,434
Energy unfocused,
innovation hindered,

355
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,395
hope strangled,
greatness disguised.

356
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,773
I see greatness
in each one of you.

357
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,151
I know exactly who you are.

358
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,405
-What are we doing?
-(all) Changing the world.

359
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,782
-What are we doing?
-(all) Changing the world.

360
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:00,992
That's right.

361
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,246
I look around, I see
another reason why I'm here.

362
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,334
Once unfamiliar faces,
strangers, one and all, now...

363
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,503
one brave family.

364
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,297
Men like Dr. Collins.

365
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,758
One of our first, who built
this community with me.

366
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,010
Thank you,
Dr. Collins for your vision.

367
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:24,057
And adventurers like Bill,
our newest intrepid explorer.

368
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,434
This brave,
young Robinson Crusoe,

369
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,395
who's choosing to join us
on this adventure.

370
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,148
Bill, thank you
for being our partner in this.

371
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:37,236
And thank you, Violet,
for being his partner in this.

372
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,697
He could not do this
without you.

373
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,908
All of you wives...

374
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,828
We men, we ask a lot.

375
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,957
We ask for strength,
a shoulder to cry on...

376
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,835
food at home,
a house cleaned,

377
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,880
and discretion, above all else.
And that...

378
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,550
That's very difficult.

379
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,519
You are my rock.
I would not be here without you.

380
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,980
Thank you.

381
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,150
(cheers, laughter)

382
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,988
-You're all dismissed.
-(all laughing)

383
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,365
(whispering indistinctly)

384
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,410
("5-10-15 Hours"
by Ruth Brown playing)

385
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,706
(Alice) Jack?

386
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,084
(humming melody)

387
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,005
Jack?

388
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,889
-(Ted) Margaret.
-They're hiding me in here.

389
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,851
Oh, give us a second, Alice.
She'll be fine.

390
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,646
I'm not fine. Nothing is fine.

391
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,607
-(Ted) She just needs to sleep.
-(Margaret) I don't sleep.

392
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,943
I have bad dreams.

393
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,528
Uh--

394
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,050
(whispering) What are you doing?

395
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,428
I wonder why I chose this tie.

396
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,815
I like your ties.

397
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,668
(whispering) No.

398
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,712
There are so many
people outside.

399
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,881
Jack, there are
so many people.

400
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,133
There are so many
people outside.

401
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,886
(Alice laughs quietly)

402
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,141
(exhaling)

403
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,086
(panting)

404
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,683
(panting quickens)

405
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:02,733
Wow him in a doubles game.
He'll 40-love this look.

406
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:03,985
(Bunny) Oh, yes, yes, yes.

407
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,570
Can you charge that
to Dean's account?

408
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,447
(Peg) I still can't believe
we can just charge, everywhere.

409
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,074
(Bunny) Yes, but
Victory has things

410
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,409
-money can't buy.
-(Peg) Mm-hm.

411
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,077
It's true, you don't have to
worry about the weather

412
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,412
or learning to drive. Ugh.

413
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,080
-I love driving.
-(Bunny) No.

414
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,832
You love Jack
teaching you to drive.

415
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,125
That's foreplay.

416
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,503
Circle back to the guest list.
Were Kathy and Bob at Frank's?

417
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,297
-I think so.
-Really?

418
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,340
Wow, so it just seems
very random, right?

419
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,676
Who is invited and who isn't.

420
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,928
It has nothing to do
with seniority, or success,

421
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,638
or even being well-liked, right?

422
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:35,725
Splish-splash.
Who's ready to dive into summer?

423
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,351
-Charge that.
-Hideous.

424
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,771
-I heard Margaret made a scene.
-Oh, my God.

425
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,190
Threw a drink in someone's face?

426
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,734
(Alice) What? No.
That did not happen.

427
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,694
(sighing) She was upset.

428
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,988
It was humiliating,
and she's gonna get Ted fired.

429
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,489
Oh.

430
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,992
If Peter got fired,
I'd kill myself.

431
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,036
Not kidding.
Can't live anywhere else.

432
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,747
Margaret is just having
a really hard time.

433
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,415
Whose fault is that?

434
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,462
I know.
I still feel bad for her.

435
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,631
Of course.
It was a terrible accident.

436
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:07,757
It wasn't an accident.

437
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,759
Bunny, stop. Come on.

438
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,719
I don't want to be rude.
I know that she was your friend.

439
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,888
She was our friend,
when she was normal.

440
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,640
And then she lost her mind.

441
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,143
She took her son
out into that desert.

442
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:23,856
-She thought she saw something.
-(Bunny) She hallucinated.

443
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:29,153
(Alice) Well, it wasn't exactly
clear as to what... happened.

444
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,908
(Bunny) She knew how dangerous
it was, just like we all do.

445
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,535
The one thing
they ask of us is to stay here,

446
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,162
where it's safe.

447
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,999
But still, she dragged that
little boy out into the middle

448
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,168
-of God-knows-what.
-(Peg groans)

449
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,338
(Bunny) If they don't want us
going out there,

450
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,590
they have their reasons.

451
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,550
(Peg) So when they found her...

452
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,345
She was alone.
They never found him.

453
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,138
Oh.

454
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,058
I knew he died, I...
I just hadn't realized...

455
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,061
(Bunny) She claims they took him
to punish her.

456
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:06,691
(loud rumbling)

457
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,445
Boys and their toys.

458
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,155
Least we know they're
getting work done.

459
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:18,160
What do you think
they're really doing out there?

460
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,207
-What do you mean?
-I mean, I know what they say...

461
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,085
You know, "development
of progressive materials,"

462
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,754
But, sometimes Peter insinuates

463
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:31,549
that they're
actually making weapons.

464
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,634
And that it's all
happening underground,

465
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,177
-because Frank discovered--
-Peg.

466
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:39,890
Sorry.

467
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,103
We're all here because
we believe in the mission.

468
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,021
Yes.

469
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:48,941
We have jobs too, that are just
as important, just as vital.

470
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,860
What we do at home,
supporting them,

471
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:51,902
taking care of them.

472
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,655
Without that, they couldn't be
out there changing the world.

473
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:56,073
Mm.

474
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,665
(gasping)

475
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,209
(panting heavily)

476
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:19,138
(Frank on radio)  Everyone
focuses on the sacrifices

477
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,308
you make by going
after what you want.

478
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,977
I want you to focus
on the sacrifices you make

479
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,771
by standing still.

480
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:30,775
By not going after what you know
you are owed by giving up,

481
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,194
and taking the smaller version
of your life.

482
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,446
Sacrifice doesn't just
take courage,

483
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,239
it takes faith, saying,

484
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,868
"I will stand this pain,
this hurt, this effort,

485
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:44,163
knowing that what I want
is waiting on the other side."

486
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,331
(Alice humming melody)

487
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:48,667
(Frank on radio)  It's scary
to sacrifice something.

488
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:52,838
But you're sacrificing
something more

489
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,673
by sitting in that fear.

490
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,469
Until tomorrow.

491
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,055
("To Know Him Is To Love Him"
by The Teddy Bears playing)

492
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,391
(bell clanging)

493
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,329
-(driver) No shopping today,
huh? -What?

494
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,706
Oh, I said,
no shopping today, huh?

495
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,126
Oh, no. No.

496
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:31,794
Afraid that's
the end of the line for me,

497
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,879
I'm just gonna need
to loop around back to town.

498
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:36,465
That's fine,
I'm just here for the joyride.

499
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,677
I needed to get
out of the house.

500
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,556
Get some fresh air.

501
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,102
(humming melody)

502
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,775
(airplane droning overhead)

503
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,247
(airplane motor sputtering)

504
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:18,048
Sir? Do you-- do you see that?

505
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,301
You all right, miss?

506
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,595
Yeah. Do you see that plane?

507
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,598
Uh, I'm afraid I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

508
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,558
There's a plane, right...

509
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:32,146
Oh, no! Oh, my God!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

510
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,357
That plane! It just crashed!

511
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,067
Are you sure?

512
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,777
Yes! Yes!
You need to drive out there.

513
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,779
It just crashed.
I-I can show you where it is.

514
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,657
Drive? No, uh--
I don't go that way.

515
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,285
-What?
-I don't go that way.

516
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,871
We need to stay here,
where it's safe.

517
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:55,044
But I--
I can't go out there alone.

518
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,880
That's not my route. I can't.

519
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:01,717
But what if they need help? Hey!

520
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:05,888
Oh, my God.

521
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,349
Oh, my God.
What's wrong with you?

522
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:40,047
(wearily humming melody)

523
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,141
(panting)

524
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,158
(resumes humming melody)

525
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,546
(breath rasping)

526
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,105
(weakly) Hello?

527
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,983
(breath hitches in throat)

528
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,111
I need some help.
There's been an accident.

529
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,113
A plane went down...

530
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,473
Hello?

531
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,244
(Frank, muffled) We can let go.

532
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:02,332
We can let go of what society
has taught us to feel.

533
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,918
We can let go of the chaos

534
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:07,921
that reigns under the auspice
of equality.

535
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:11,717
We can fall deeper
into what we know is true,

536
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:16,054
that we crave order.

537
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:18,599
(piano playing melody)

538
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,105
(breath echoing faintly)

539
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,365
(Frank, muffled, echoing)
Allow your consciousness to sink

540
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:40,037
into this world,
into this truth.

541
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,709
Sink deeper into the way
things are supposed to be.

542
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:49,713
(Jack) Alice.

543
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,965
(panting softly)

544
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:56,261
(light thudding)

545
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,895
(soft thud)

546
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,485
(thud repeating)

547
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,579
(Jack murmuring faintly)

548
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,557
(muffled clattering)

549
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,519
("Little Girl Don't You
Understand" by Bobby Freeman)

550
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,190
(light thud, clatter)

551
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,531
-Jack?
-You're awake.

552
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,118
I didn't even have time
to set the table.

553
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,954
What's going on?

554
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,290
Well, I'm making you dinner.

555
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,876
Now, we were supposed
to have five courses.

556
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:12,254
Unfortunately, I think we're
down to about three.

557
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,089
That-- Don't look at that.

558
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:18,010
That course is officially
off the menu.

559
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,720
What happened?

560
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,847
I got a little aggressive
with the seasoning.

561
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,683
How long have you been home?

562
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,685
Uh, a few hours.

563
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,104
-(liquid splashes)
-(under breath) Okay.

564
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,273
Nope, don't look at that.
That's--

565
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,191
Okay, so I'm making that roast.

566
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,193
You know, the one you made
for my birthday?

567
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:38,614
(exhales sharply)
Only with a few changes.

568
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,992
I was here when you got here?

569
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,077
Yeah. Asleep in the bedroom.

570
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,997
-(fridge door opens)
-Do you put carrots in a roast?

571
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,042
How did I get home?

572
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,585
Trolley, I think.

573
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,506
Wait, so he came out and got me?

574
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,050
What are you talking about?

575
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,845
Jack, I got off the trolley.
I saw a plane crash.

576
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,932
Alice, I think I would've heard
if there was a plane crash.

577
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,225
-No, Jack, I saw it...
-They tend to be rather loud...

578
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,686
-...and I started walking and--
-...and hard to miss.

00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,981
("Need Your Love So Bad"

580
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:20,656
Hey. Are you okay?

581
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,033
-No, I don't know. I'm not...
-What's wrong?

582
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:29,122
I had a really weird dream.
A really weird dream.

583
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,583
I'm sorry.

584
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,086
Do you know what
weird dreams make me?

585
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,379
What?

586
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,297
Hungry.

587
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,009
-Would you like some carrot?
-Yes.

588
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:48,058
Alice, I want to be honest
with you about something.

589
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,518
Mm-hm?

590
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,814
I don't think these mashed
potatoes are gonna work.

591
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,693
That's because you need
to boil them first, baby.

592
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,361
-(laughing deeply)
-I knew it.

593
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,822
I knew there was a step missing.
Such an idiot.

594
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:02,906
Let me put a pot on.

595
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,116
No, no, no.

596
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,993
-Come on, let me just put the--
-Make us some drinks. Relax.

597
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,411
-Okay. Okay.
-Make some drinks.

598
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,788
I am your chef tonight!

599
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,042
(sighing deeply)

600
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,712
-(Jack) Hey.
-Hm?

601
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,714
You love me?

602
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,466
(whispering) The most.

603
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,469
The most.

604
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,560
(singing)
? Boiling the potatoes, I'm ?

605
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:35,439
-? Boiling the potatoes ?
-(dishes clattering)

606
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:39,109
(cars driving away)

607
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,194
(insects chirring)

608
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:48,035
(Frank on radio)
Yes, there are always people

609
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,953
who will benefit
from the status quo,

610
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:51,538
and they will come for us.

611
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,790
-They're already coming for us.
-(humming melody)

612
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,669
I am willing
to sacrifice everything for you.

613
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,963
I will give everything I have

614
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:02,549
to create this better world
for all of us,

615
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:05,969
but I can't protect you
without your loyalty.

616
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,721
(continues humming)

617
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:11,683
When you promise something,
do you keep that promise?

618
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:15,729
Is your word your bond?
Is your word your truth?

619
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,690
Is it our covenant?

620
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,068
Until tomorrow.

621
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,364
(quiet moan)

622
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:29,117
(gasping)

623
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,829
(crying out)

624
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:35,332
(panting)

625
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,005

626
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,049
(gasping)

627
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:48,512
(telephone ringing)

628
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,640
("The End Of The World"
by Skeeter Davis playing)

629
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:56,353
(telephone continues ringing)

630
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,528
Hello?

631
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:08,573
(Margaret) You went out there.
You saw it.

632
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:10,826
Margaret?

633
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:15,747
You saw it.
They're lying to all of us.

634
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,668
I can't talk to you
right now, Margaret.

635
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,129
No one asks any questions.

636
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,714
We can't stay here anymore,
Alice.

637
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,052
(crying) I'm not crazy.

638
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:31,138
You're being ridiculous
and you need to stop this.

639
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,515
-Alice, you know me--
-(hangs up phone)

640
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,055
(screams)

641
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,808
(gasping)

642
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,116
No.

643
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,787
No.

644
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,289
(whimpering)

645
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:42,727
Margaret?

646
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,700
No. No, don't!

647
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,952
(shrieking)

648
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,080
(gasping)

649
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,040
Wait!

650
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,378
No! No, get off me!

651
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,630
Margaret! Get off me!

652
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,465
Margaret!

653
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,176
(Alice) Jack, you
don't understand.

654
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,261
I was right there.

655
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,346
-I watched the whole thing.
-(Jack) I'm tired, Alice.

656
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,889
-(Alice) I saw her fall.
-(Jack) I want to go to bed.

657
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:22,851
(Alice) I tried to go and help,
and then they dragged me away.

658
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,436
Why would they take me away?

659
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,396
-You have to stop!
-They--

660
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,565
There is no way
that she's fine, Jack.

661
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:29,774
No.

662
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,737
I don't know what to tell you.

663
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,864
Ted is with her
at the hospital right now.

664
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,991
He said she needs
a few stitches.

665
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:40,952
She slipped cleaning the window.
It was an accident.

666
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:43,079
Nope. I saw her.
She cut herself.

667
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:44,539
You had a bad night.

668
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,207
-Don't! No!
-You weren't feeling well.

669
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,585
She fell, and you imagined
the worst case scenario.

670
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:51,129
-She slit her throat!
-(groans) That's crazy.

671
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:52,380
Crazy. It's crazy.

672
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:54,716
Jack, I saw it happen.
She cut herself open.

673
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,010
There was blood everywhere.
It's not just a few stitches.

674
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,804
-Please don't get hysterical.
-(sighs)

675
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:08,772
(voice trembling) Jack...

676
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,443
She was my friend.

677
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,905
And she came to me for help.

678
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,616
And I ignored her.

679
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,619
And then this happened.

680
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,705
And I feel like it's my fault.

681
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,085
It's no one's fault, Alice.
It was an accident.

682
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,419
No.

683
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:34,964
She said they would
come after her

684
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:36,800
because she knew something.

685
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:42,138
Why are they lying
about what happened?

686
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:44,808
-Please, just stop.
-What are they hiding?

687
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,853
Come on, baby,
you have to admit this is weird.

688
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:51,439
-Stop!
-There's something off!

689
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:05,370
What are you doing
at the Victory Project?

690
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:06,830
(water shuts off)

691
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:09,958
You know what I do, Alice.
I'm a technical engineer.

692
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,210
Mm-hm.

693
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:14,337
I know.

694
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:18,425
But what are they doing?

695
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,514
Please...

696
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,059
What's actually happening?

697
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:29,477
Don't ask me that.

698
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:32,230
The development
of progressive materials?

699
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:33,773
You know we can't talk
about this.

700
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:35,275
What does that even mean?

701
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:36,818
Come on, what does it mean?

702
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,945
What does it even mean?
Do you know?

703
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,738
Do you even know
what Frank is actually doing?

704
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:41,656
It's classified.

705
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,283
We're not even allowed
to discuss our jobs

706
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,326
with other departments,
you know that.

707
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,703
What if Margaret was right?

708
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:47,912
Stop it, Alice.

709
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:48,830
What if this place is dangerous?

710
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,707
-What if--?
-Stop it!

711
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,211
I'm part of something important,
Alice.

712
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:58,715
This mission,
what Frank's doing, it matters.

713
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,675
I know that, baby,
but you're not listening to me.

714
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,178
Not everyone
gets this opportunity.

715
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,263
And if you keep
talking like this,

716
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,931
you're gonna put it all at risk.

717
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:08,766
You're worried about a demotion?

718
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:09,976
That's what you're
worried about?

719
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:14,314
Our life, Alice.
Our life together.

720
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,149
This.

721
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,735
We could lose this.

722
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:25,241
Please.
Just get a hold of yourself.

723
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:28,995
Please.

724
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,414
(muttering) Fuck's sake.

725
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,794
(insects chirring)

726
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,767
(Frank on TV)
Victory is safe and secure.

727
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,061
A perfect place
to raise the family

728
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,521
you've always wanted,

729
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:56,606
when you're not relaxing
with friends

730
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:59,526
or enjoying
the breathtaking scenery

731
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:02,278
of this sun-baked paradise.

732
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:04,614
Although, you might find
the best scenery

733
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,407
at the club pool.

734
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:09,369
Here you can live the life
you deserve.

735
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,746
We can all live the life...

736
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:33,393
(gasps)

737
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:48,241
("Sleepwalk"
by Santo & Johnny playing)

738
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:50,702
(motor idling)

739
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:57,083
(woman on radio)
If I could tell Frank anything,

740
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:00,545
it would just be, "Thank you."
Because I didn't know

741
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,422
-I could be this happy.
-(Alice humming melody)

742
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,758
Honestly, I don't even remember
my life before Victory.

743
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:11,347
Frank gave us the opportunity
of a lifetime. I wouldn't...

744
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:14,017
(woman continues on radio,
muffled)

745
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,183
(gasping for breath)

746
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,810
(woman on radio)
We are so lucky to be here.

747
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:59,312
(panting)

748
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,321
(air hissing)

749
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,659
-Hm.
-(cuff tearing)

750
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:15,536
-Is there a bug going around?
-No, not that I know of.

751
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,999
Think this is just
run-of-the-mill exhaustion.

752
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:24,003
You had any new stresses
or pressures lately?

753
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:27,131
-Um...
-(Jack) She saw Ted's wife fall.

754
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:28,758
Thought maybe it might be shock.

755
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:32,553
Boy, that was quite a tumble.
She was so embarrassed.

756
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:36,599
It... it wasn't a tumble.

757
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:39,811
She slit her throat.

758
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,230
-(Jack) Alice.
-Uh, no, no, no.

759
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,945
Witnessing a trauma can often
lead to distorted memories.

760
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:50,196
Even nightmares.

761
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,116
It's...

762
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,410
I have some pills
I can prescribe for that.

763
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:59,956
Uh, I... I really don't think
that I need those.

764
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,709
Oh, they're precautionary.

765
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,086
Most of my patients have had

766
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:07,588
quite a bit of success
with them.

767
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:11,509
They will just keep you relaxed.

768
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,598
(Jack) She doesn't need those.

769
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:20,560
This isn't a problem.

770
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,729
We can handle it ourselves.

771
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:26,983
Well, I'll just
keep that on file.

772
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:36,534
What did you do to Margaret?

773
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:38,828
Pardon?

774
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,706
Ted's wife.

775
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:47,628
I'm sorry, I'm just... I...

776
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:52,759
I still don't understand
how she's okay.

777
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:57,013
You wouldn't want me discussing
the details of your treatment

778
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,598
with my other patients, now,
would you?

779
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,851
Mmm... I wouldn't mind.

780
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:05,104
I would really love
to know the details of...

781
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:07,482
of how you fixed her.

782
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,445
Well, as you know, we provide
both psychiatric

783
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,489
and physical care here.

784
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:17,158
And Margaret was
in need of both.

785
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,994
The good news is,
is that physically, she's fine,

786
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,038
but psychologically, she wasn't.

787
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,956
She was having
significant troubles.

788
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,001
Outbursts. Paranoia.

789
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,712
She made it impossible
for Ted to do his job,

790
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:33,049
so he no longer works
for the Victory Project.

791
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,718
She needed quite a bit of help.

792
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:37,804
Ah... not like you.

793
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,057
-(Jack) No.
-(dry chuckle)

794
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,850
(Jack) It's not necessary here.

795
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,478
It's a totally
different scenario.

796
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:49,023
What is it that you Brits say?

797
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:54,278
Ah! "Keep calm and carry on."

798
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,656
-(laughs)
-(both chuckle)

799
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:01,911
-(claps hands)
-Jack. Walk me out?

800
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:04,205
Of course. (clears throat)

801
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:05,665
(Dr. Collins) And remember...

802
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,792
that I'm always
a phone call away.

803
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,086
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

804
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:36,946
Oh, come on.

805
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,701
(locks click open)

806
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:46,163
You know our position on that.

807
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:48,457
So glad you came back.
You left this.

808
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,376
I'd forget my head
if it wasn't screwed on.

809
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:51,919
(chuckles)

810
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,755
Jack, shouldn't you be getting
back to work?

811
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:56,340
(Jack) Yeah. Of course.

812
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:03,264
-See you tonight. Okay.
-Mm-hm.

813
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,148
(door shuts)

814
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:46,015
Oh, no. No. It's not--

815
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:17,630
(fire crackling)

816
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:38,651
(humming melody)

817
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:15,563
(piano playing melody
in high register)

818
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:35,583
(coughing)

819
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,835
(gasps)

820
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:42,089
("Poor Little Fool"
by Ricky Nelson playing faintly)

821
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:49,638
(Jack) Might ask Shelley to
dance at some point,

822
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:51,057
if it feels like a good time.

823
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,935
You're still in the bath?
We're gonna be late.

824
00:55:56,312 --> 00:56:00,357
You see the dress I got you?
Picked it out last week.

825
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,694
I couldn't stop
picturing you in it.

826
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,198
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

827
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,451
You look incredible.

828
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:15,372
Been thinking we should
try something kind of crazy.

829
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,420
Let's have a baby.

830
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:26,050
-What?
-(chuckling) Not right now.

831
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,010
Look, I love you.

832
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:31,180
And I want more of you.

833
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:34,934
And I think I want a little you.

834
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:38,687
(Jack laughs)

835
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,982
I don't know,
I think it would be fun.

836
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:45,694
Just think about it, okay?

837
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,822
(whispers) Okay.

838
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,454
Tonight's gonna be great.
You're gonna look beautiful.

839
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:11,971
(people laughing, chattering)

840
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,639
(drummer playing lively beat)

841
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:16,058
Good evening.
We've been waiting for you.

842
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:17,393
I'm so sorry.

843
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:19,812
You have the best table
in the house.

844
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,690
(band playing "Sing, Sing, Sing
(With A Swing)")

845
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:25,317
(inaudible)

846
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,405
-Good to see you, man.
-Hey, guys.

847
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:33,159
Why are you two always fighting?
What's wrong with you?

848
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:35,327
-Always. Constantly.
-(Peter) We're fine. We're fine.

849
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:39,039
-(Alice) Hi.
-Oh! Finally! Hi.

850
00:57:39,832 --> 00:57:42,459
Hello. Oh, my God!

851
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,088
Here, drink this.

852
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:48,048
You look just like
a little doll.

853
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,633
Spin, spin, spin! Ah!

854
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:53,179
This is me. This is you.
Here, go, go, go.

855
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:55,181
-All the way back.
-Just drink it all!

856
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:57,641
-(Jack) There we go.
-(Dean laughing) There we go!

857
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:59,518
(Shelley) Here are
the troublemakers.

858
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:00,895
(Bunny laughing)

859
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,105
I can't believe we're allowed
to put all of you at one table.

860
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,732
I think it's better for
insurance purposes,

861
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:07,193
-to be honest.
-(Bunny) That's true.

862
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,446
Alice, how are you feeling?

863
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:13,407
I'm well. I'm doing well.

864
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:15,284
This is beautiful.

865
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,661
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

866
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:20,581
And if I hear glass breaking,
I'm coming right back here.

867
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,707
(Dean) Oh, don't tempt us

868
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,542
or we'll be breaking glass
all night.

869
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:25,878
(Dean laughing)

870
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:30,591
(Shelley) See you
on the dance floor later?

871
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:33,093
(Jack) Yes, ma'am.
Of course.

872
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,722
(band finishes playing)

873
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,058
(Shelley on P.A.) Can my
husband throw a party or what?

874
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,101
(crowd cheering, applauding)

875
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:45,189
(Shelley) He does
so much for us.

876
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,775
More than we could ever repay.

877
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:51,028
But I have attempted a little...
gift for him.

878
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,280
-(Peg) Uh-oh.
-(Shelley) For all of us,
really.

879
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:55,157
I hope you enjoy.

880
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:58,410
(band playing "Purple Wail"
by Red Prysock)

881
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:02,331
(cheering, applause)

882
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:08,337
(whistling loudly)

883
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,049
Ohh!

884
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,176
Let's go!

885
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,694
(music fading)

886
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:38,826
(jazz band fades completely)

887
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:55,217
You went out there.

888
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,386
You saw it.

889
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,561
(Dr. Collins)
She was having outbursts.

890
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,022
Paranoia.

891
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,659
-How 'bout that?
-(jazz music returns)

892
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:22,578
(audience cheering)

893
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:24,204
(Frank laughs)

894
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,957
There you are. I bow to you.

895
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,754
Now, make some noise! Come on!

896
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:36,467
(laughing) You like that?
Did you guys like that?

897
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,595
Get off of your seats, come on!

898
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:41,221
How are you, sweetheart?
Good to see you.

899
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,349
All right, this is what
I'm talking about.

900
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:45,601
You work hard, you play hard.

901
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:47,269
What do you say, Jacko?

902
01:00:47,353 --> 01:00:49,813
(drummer playing lively beat)

903
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,648
-Jack, I want to go home.
-What?

904
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:52,858
I want to go.

905
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,943
(Frank) Come on, Tim!
Come on, Tim!

906
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:57,279
-All right!
-(drummer stops)

907
01:00:57,363 --> 01:01:00,032
-Whoo! (laughs)
-(crowd cheering)

908
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:02,284
How about that?
Put your hands together.

909
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:03,535
Please, we need to leave.

910
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:04,953
We need to leave right now.
Please.

911
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:07,039
We'll just pour you a drink.
You'll be okay.

912
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,751
Only the best for Victory.
My goodness!

913
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,961
All right, take a seat.

914
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:16,048
-(cheers subside)
-(chairs scraping)

915
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:21,011
(Frank) Uh, I have the burden
now of trying to follow that,

916
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:23,097
which will be hard, but...

917
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:26,558
-(mouthing) Jack...
-I have to admit that I, uh...

918
01:01:28,227 --> 01:01:32,815
I was planning...
a little presentation of my own.

919
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:36,693
-(cheers, applause)
-I know. (laughing)

920
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:40,823
(chuckling) I know.
Yeah. All right. All right.

921
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:42,783
(applause subsides)

922
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:43,992
Jack Chambers.

923
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,372
If I could have you up here
for a minute.

924
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,376
Jack.

925
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:55,170
Jack, please, I need to go home.
We need to leave.

926
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:57,673
(Frank) Come on, everybody,
give him a round of applause.

927
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,092
-(applause, cheers)
-Needs a little encouragement.

928
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,635
Big round of applause.

929
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,179
Let's give him
a big Victory welcome!

930
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:08,517
Jack Chambers.

931
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:15,107
(clears throat)

932
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:20,237
Tonight is my favorite night
of the year.

933
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,948
I love seeing everybody
under one roof,

934
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:25,868
seeing how much we've all grown.

935
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,455
But few...

936
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,375
Few have grown as...

937
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,794
impressively...

938
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,422
as this young man right here.

939
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,340
(applause swelling)

940
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:41,925
(chuckling)

941
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:46,513
I've debated long and hard
about this, Lord knows. Whew!

942
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:49,766
It's certainly
out of the ordinary.

943
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:54,480
But you know what?
This man is out of the ordinary.

944
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:58,192
This man, I am in awe of.

945
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:03,071
Jack Chambers, I am honored...

946
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:08,494
to invite you to join our...

947
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:11,872
senior advisory board.

948
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,750
-(audience members exclaiming)
-(applause)

949
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:31,558
Are you the man
that you say you are?

950
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,402
It's a good fit.

951
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:43,862
(light chuckle)

952
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:47,533
Thank you for your loyalty.

953
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:51,119
More good things to come.

954
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,207
How 'bout that,
ladies and gentlemen.

955
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,459
(cheering, applause)

956
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,347
(cheering continues)

957
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,400
(panting heavily)

958
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:27,531
(breathing deeply, shakily)

959
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:30,033
(band playing
up-tempo swing music)

960
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:33,787
You wanna see the boy dance?

961
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:36,331
(laughing)

962
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:41,253
Look at this boy dance!

963
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:44,965
Come on! Come on!

964
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:47,384
-(crying quietly)
-(music continues, faint)

965
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,971
(Frank, faintly)
Look what he can do!

966
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,223
(laughing)

967
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:59,396
(Alice) Don't say that.
You're gonna get another job.

968
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:01,189
-(Bunny whispering) Alice!
-(gasps)

969
01:05:01,273 --> 01:05:04,735
Hey. What's wrong? Honey.

970
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:09,281
What happened? What's wrong?

971
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,908
(Frank) It's extraordinary!

972
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,540
(Frank laughing)

973
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,001
Everything's fine. It's okay.

974
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,419
Bunny, we need to go.

975
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:23,879
We need to get out of here
right now.

976
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:26,298
-No, no, no. We're okay.
-We need to go.

977
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,885
We're okay. Come on.
Tell me, what happened?

978
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:32,971
(music increases in tempo)

979
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:35,057
How about that, huh?

980
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:37,434
You watching him dance?

981
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,686
Margaret was right.

982
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:44,524
She was asking questions
that they don't want us to ask.

983
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:47,110
And so they silenced her.

984
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,529
She didn't slip.
It wasn't an accident.

985
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:52,282
I saw it happen. I saw her fall.

986
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:54,451
They're lying about everything.

987
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,581
(Frank) Dance, Jack!

988
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:05,045
Let's make him spin, shall we?

989
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,506
And so I went out there,
and I saw it.

990
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:09,675
You went-- you went out where?

991
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:12,719
(Frank) Yeah, that's it!
Come on, boy, faster!

992
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,972
Keep it going! Come on!
Come on! Yeah!

993
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:19,643
That's it!

994
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:23,897
-(music stops)
-(Frank) Ha-ha!

995
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,483
Doesn't that make you believe?

996
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,069
(laughing) Stand up!

997
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:33,990
Stand up, take a bow!
Take a bow, you deserve it!

998
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,993
And when I touched it,
I saw something.

999
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,747
And I keep remembering more.

1000
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:43,583
And I heard Frank's voice,
and he's in my head--

1001
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,086
It's more than just
a celebration

1002
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:50,924
of our freedom from society's
arbitrary regulations,

1003
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:55,345
it's a celebration
of potential unleashed!

1004
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:59,057
It's a reminder of who we are!

1005
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:01,393
Can I just show you?
Let's just go out there.

1006
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:02,644
Everybody will be
distracted right now.

1007
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:03,729
We can take Dean's car.

1008
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:05,480
-We can head to--
-Stop. Stop. Stop it!

1009
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,735
-Have you lost your mind?
-What?

1010
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:11,236
You went to Headquarters?

1011
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:12,738
Because I thought I saw
a plane crash.

1012
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:15,449
It is the one rule
they ask us to respect.

1013
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,242
You know how dangerous it is.

1014
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:22,497
We are not going backwards.
We're pushing forwards, yes?

1015
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:24,082
We move!

1016
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:27,377
-You stole from Dr. Collins?
-Because Margaret can't be okay!

1017
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:29,379
Get a hold of yourself, Alice!

1018
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,257
You are behaving like a child.

1019
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,217
Your husband is out there

1020
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:36,803
having the most important night
of his life.

1021
01:07:36,887 --> 01:07:37,846
He's being celebrated,

1022
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:38,889
and you're in here
trying to ruin it?

1023
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,307
No! No!

1024
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:43,018
You sound exactly like Margaret!

1025
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,982
Whose world is it?

1026
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,358
Ours!

1027
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:52,444
Whose world is this?

1028
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:53,361
(all) Ours!

1029
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:55,530
-(Frank) Whose world is this?
-(all) Ours!

1030
01:07:55,614 --> 01:07:57,574
-Whose world is this?
-(all) Ours!

1031
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:05,499
-Whose world is it? Ours!
-(all) Ours!

1032
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:07,918
-Whose world is it? Ours!
-(all) Ours!

1033
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:10,504
-Whose world is it? Ours!
-(all) Ours!

1034
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:12,881
-(Jack) Whose world is it? Ours!
-(all) Ours!

1035
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:15,550
-(Jack) Whose world is it? Ours!
-(all) Ours!

1036
01:08:15,634 --> 01:08:17,719
(sizzling)

1037
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:23,767
("You Belong To Me"
by Helen Foster & The Rovers
playing)

1038
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:28,188
(Jack) They're calling it
Operation Extract.

1039
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,524
It's higher security clearance.

1040
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,651
I'm gonna be heading
the whole thing myself,

1041
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:35,070
which is a real vote of
confidence from Frank, I think.

1042
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:48,834
(muffled knocking)

1043
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,669
-Welcome!
-(Jack) Welcome!

1044
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:51,711
There he is.

1045
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:55,257
Oh, my. Those are beautiful.
Come on in.

1046
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:56,508
Come on in.

1047
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:57,759
(Bill) I want it for you.
Thank you.

1048
01:08:57,843 --> 01:08:59,594
(Peg) Are we late?
I feel like we're late.

1049
01:08:59,678 --> 01:09:00,804
(Peter) We literally
are arriving at the same time.

1050
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,639
(Alice) What are these platters?
Wow!

1051
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,558
Whatever's going on here,
I love. I love.

1052
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,559
You like it?

1053
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,018
-Yeah, the decor is--
-I'm glad, Bill. I'm glad.

1054
01:09:07,102 --> 01:09:08,228
All right, buddy,
tell me the truth.

1055
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:09,062
Is he really coming?

1056
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,564
This is for you.
I think he's coming.

1057
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,315
How the hell did you get Frank
to come to your house?

1058
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:13,733
It wasn't me. It was Alice.

1059
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,569
These are the perks. I get it.
This is how you're living.

1060
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,696
Is everything in this house
from the catalogue?

1061
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,698
It's a house.
Show me the ring. Let me see it.

1062
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,157
Did we beat Bunny?

1063
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,702
Uh, she... she's not coming.

1064
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:26,997
-(Peg) Hm.
-Told you.

1065
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,498
-Sorry, boys. Can I just get...
-Yeah, yeah.

1066
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:29,666
You know, it's a good thing
you can dance,

1067
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:30,959
'cause you're so hideously
unattractive.

1068
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:33,169
-(Alice) They're here!
-How many secrets do you--

1069
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:34,170
(Alice) Thank you.

1070
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:36,131
-(Shelley) It's good to see you.
-Wow.

1071
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:39,593
I knew it. I told Peg.
It's gonna be a no-tie event.

1072
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:43,221
-Frank.
-Jack! You crazy son of a bitch!

1073
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:44,514
What do you want me
to do with this?

1074
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:45,682
Hold on to it.

1075
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,684
I told her it was gonna be like
a casual thing.

1076
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,269
-Put that on ice.
-Wow.

1077
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:50,604
-Thanks for coming.
-I'm proud of you.

1078
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,105
-Thank you.
-What a lovely home, by the way.

1079
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,024
Jack, could you make Shelley
a cocktail?

1080
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:55,233
(Jack) Of course.

1081
01:09:55,317 --> 01:09:56,943
Hey, Frank, that was
a hell of a party last night.

1082
01:09:57,027 --> 01:09:58,069
It was.

1083
01:09:58,153 --> 01:10:00,530
I'm trying to get my wife
into a martini glass.

1084
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:01,865
(laughs)

1085
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:02,949
-He liked that.
-No, he didn't.

1086
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:05,076
-(Peg) Where's your drink?
-(Alice) It's right here.
Cheers!

1087
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:07,746
(Violet) Cheers.
It's a wonderful home.

1088
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,456
-How are you?
-Me?

1089
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:10,832
-I'm amazing.
-Mm-hm.

1090
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:12,751
After the night Jack had,
I'm incredible.

1091
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:13,919
Right. Of course.

1092
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,712
Cheers. Thanks for coming.

1093
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,840
-You were a triumph last night.
-Oh! (chuckles)

1094
01:10:18,924 --> 01:10:20,091
We haven't stopped talking
about you.

1095
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:21,426
You guys go now
and enjoy yourselves.

1096
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:24,679
I'm gonna go back
to the plates and finish up,

1097
01:10:24,763 --> 01:10:26,681
-and, um, I'll see you in--
-Can I help you?

1098
01:10:26,765 --> 01:10:29,559
-No, go. Promise. Go snoop.
-You sure? Okay.

1099
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:31,019
I love this record player.

1100
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,145
-You do? You like it, Bill?
-I love it.

1101
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,314
At my house, I have a bench.
How did you get...

1102
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,566
("Desafinado"
by AntÃ´nio Carlos Jobim playing)

1103
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:38,735
(Peg) You can probably
tell by now

1104
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:41,488
that appetizers are where
I really express myself

1105
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,406
and buck convention.

1106
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:44,699
(Violet) It's a skill.

1107
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:46,284
Maybe you can
teach me sometime.

1108
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:47,953
Can't be taught.

1109
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:52,165
(humming melody)

1110
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,218
(Frank) I learned something
very exciting.

1111
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:04,719
(exhales)

1112
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:06,846
Oh, really? What's that?

1113
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:09,224
Rumor is you and Jack
are trying.

1114
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:10,558
Oh, well...

1115
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,644
-We'll see. (chuckles)
-Mm.

1116
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:15,105
Hope we'll see a little boy.

1117
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:17,065
(both laugh)

1118
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:24,280
(clicks teeth) I'm sorry
Bunny didn't believe you.

1119
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,287
(frank chuckles softly)

1120
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:38,294
But then again, you didn't
believe Margaret, so...

1121
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:42,424
why should anyone
believe you?

1122
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,599
My God, you fascinate me.

1123
01:11:52,851 --> 01:11:54,728
Because I've been waiting
for someone like you.

1124
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:57,981
Someone to challenge me.

1125
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:02,402
No great man has changed
the course of history

1126
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:06,031
without being pushed
to the limits of his potential.

1127
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:09,325
And you push me.

1128
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:11,786
Yeah.

1129
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:14,789
(chuckles lightly)

1130
01:12:14,873 --> 01:12:16,958
I do hope you keep going.

1131
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:33,224
And yet, here you are.
Preparing dinner.

1132
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:37,687
Like a good girl.

1133
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:42,692
(chuckles softly)

1134
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,030
-(Jack) Sit.
-(Frank) Absolutely.

1135
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,448
(Violet) Do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

1136
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,950
No, I hope it's a boy.
Thank you.

1137
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:52,619
-Can't get enough of 'em, right?
-(groans)

1138
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,496
-(Violet laughs)
-Girls are hard. They are.

1139
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:56,539
-I'll be right there, all right?
-Thank you.

1140
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,794
You know, Alice tells me you're
a hell of a tennis player.

1141
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:03,046
-Oh, she does?
-Is that right? Yeah.

1142
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,047
(Jack) She's being polite.

1143
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,049
(Frank) Well, we're looking
for some fierce competitors.

1144
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:07,967
If you're ever ready
to get out there, call me.

1145
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:09,928
I've heard about that backhand,
though, it's famous.

1146
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,846
(Frank) If you want a partner,
I'm yours, man.

1147
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,723
That's a lot of pressure.
I don't know if--

1148
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:15,225
Thank you.

1149
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,310
(chatter stops)

1150
01:13:20,522 --> 01:13:22,023
(chuckles softly)

1151
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,237
I'm having the fish. I don't
know what you guys are having.

1152
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,030
-(chatter resumes)
-(clears throat)

1153
01:13:29,114 --> 01:13:30,365
(Peter) Nice to see
a familiar face.

1154
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:32,283
(Bill) Um, so anyways,
those windows right there,

1155
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:33,326
the slatted windows?

1156
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,578
They're actually called
"jalousie" windows.

1157
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:36,663
Did you know that?

1158
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,248
-You didn't know why.
-(Peter) Oh, boy.

1159
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:39,624
So, the etymology is...

1160
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:40,875
(in French accent)
..."jealousy."

1161
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:42,252
And you say,
"Whose baby is this?"

1162
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:43,378
And they say, "It's your baby."

1163
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,213
And you say,
"How could that be?"

1164
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:46,714
And it is your baby.

1165
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:48,424
And I just do it every year.

1166
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,427
-Violet, where are you from?
-(chatter subsides)

1167
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:55,265
-Pardon?
-I said, "Where are you from?"

1168
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:57,600
Philadelphia.

1169
01:13:57,684 --> 01:14:00,395
-Mm! I'm from Philadelphia!
-(laughing) Are you serious?

1170
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:01,855
-I didn't know that.
-I knew I liked you.

1171
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:05,150
Most of the women here
are from Philadelphia.

1172
01:14:05,233 --> 01:14:07,443
Or Baltimore. Or Chicago.

1173
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:08,444
I've noticed.

1174
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:09,821
(Jack) Can I get
anyone anything?

1175
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,447
(Peg) I for one do not miss
the winters.

1176
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,241
No, no, no.
I thrive in the sunshine,

1177
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:14,617
even though
I'm alabaster-skinned.

1178
01:14:14,701 --> 01:14:16,953
I love the sunshine.
I love the beach.

1179
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:18,663
-(Peg) Mm.
-(Jack) She does.

1180
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:20,373
What was the last beach
you went to?

1181
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:21,624
(Peter) Oh, fun fact
about the beach.

1182
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:22,667
-I read this.
-Yeah?

1183
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,544
Beaches are actually some
of the filthiest places

1184
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:25,420
in the whole world.

1185
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:28,214
-Just a sandbox of disease and--
-Peter!

1186
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:29,591
Do not say "disease"
at the dinner table.

1187
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:30,842
(Peter) It's true.
They need to know.

1188
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:34,429
I can probably guess.
Hilton Head? Cape Cod?

1189
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:35,889
Or the Jersey Shore?

1190
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:41,561
And we all honeymooned
in Sea Island,

1191
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:45,148
or the Poconos,
or Niagara Falls.

1192
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,528
I think those are popular
honeymoon destinations.

1193
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:52,864
-Expensive.
-Beautiful, beautiful.

1194
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,908
Peter, you, uh...
haven't finished your story.

1195
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:56,868
(Peter) Mm!
Bill over here's probably

1196
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,369
-one of the worst golf players--
-I'm sorry, Peter.

1197
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:01,706
I'm not quite finished.
Violet, where did you meet Bill?

1198
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:04,626
Well, we met on a train.

1199
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:06,085
-To Boston.
-To Boston.

1200
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:07,754
Yeah.

1201
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,714
-Yes.
-(both laughing)

1202
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:11,925
You dropped your ticket.

1203
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:15,303
And he bent down, picked it up,
gave it to you, right?

1204
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,096
It is, yeah.

1205
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:20,350
That's how Margaret met Ted.

1206
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:23,311
And Peg, am I right in thinking

1207
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:25,730
that's how Debbie McIntyre
met her husband?

1208
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:28,024
Yes, I am. That's how they met.

1209
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,360
-Yes, that's true. I'm jealous.
-(Frank) Is it? Wow.

1210
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,445
Honestly, it's such
a sweet story. Yeah. Yeah.

1211
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,821
Isn't that funny,
the way those coincidences--

1212
01:15:33,905 --> 01:15:34,656
Incredible.

1213
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:36,491
(Alice) There are only so many
different stories we're told.

1214
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:39,202
We're told what we remember.

1215
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:41,579
Until...

1216
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:44,582
we try to remember things...

1217
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:47,377
that they want us to forget.

1218
01:15:48,503 --> 01:15:49,921
-Like Margaret.
-Alice...

1219
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:53,383
No. Jack. It's okay.

1220
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:57,804
I'm curious to hear
where she's going with this.

1221
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:02,892
Frank is doing something to us.

1222
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:12,610
Delusions, memory problems,
hysteria.

1223
01:16:12,694 --> 01:16:15,154
We saw these issues
with Margaret,

1224
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:17,365
and know that it's, uh,
completely curable.

1225
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:20,827
Dr. Collins prescribed you
a suite of medications,

1226
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,370
which you are
clearly not taking.

1227
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:23,579
The question is why...

1228
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:26,416
He's lying to us.
He's lying to all of us.

1229
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:30,003
Bunny, your best friend,
is worried about you.

1230
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:31,254
She thinks that you need help.

1231
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:32,922
Is that why she's
not here tonight?

1232
01:16:33,006 --> 01:16:34,424
Because you didn't want
to be reminded of that.

1233
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:35,967
He's using you.
He's using all of us.

1234
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,094
Do you even know what
the Victory Project actually is?

1235
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:40,430
-Have you ever asked?
-Do you?

1236
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:43,474
Is that why you went out there?

1237
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:47,687
To Headquarters?

1238
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:50,481
What?

1239
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:53,901
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-Alice...

1240
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:55,111
But you don't know
what he's doing.

1241
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,863
(Frank) You wandered out
by yourself.

1242
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,489
You ignored every rule.

1243
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:01,409
And she put all your lives
in danger.

1244
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,123
Yes, I did go out there

1245
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,375
and I went to Headquarters
and I saw what he's hiding.

1246
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:10,585
-(Frank) What I'm hiding.
-He's lying to us.

1247
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:11,794
-(Frank) Oh, dear.
-(Alice) He's lying to all of us

1248
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:13,671
about what the Victory Project
actually is.

1249
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:14,881
-He's trapped us here.
-(Frank) Alice...

1250
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,341
Trapped?

1251
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:20,511
I hope no one feels trapped.
Do you feel trapped?

1252
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:21,846
Violet?

1253
01:17:23,348 --> 01:17:25,224
-Peg?
-(awkward chuckle)

1254
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,936
This is your psychosis.

1255
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:32,732
You are experiencing trust
as a feeling of entrapment,

1256
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,942
yet you trust every day.

1257
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,070
We all do.

1258
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:40,656
Tonight, you've trusted us
in your home.

1259
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:45,578
Just like I trusted you
in my bedroom.

1260
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:58,007
Alice? Do you remember that?

1261
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:04,305
He's... he's trying
to create a world.

1262
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:06,307
If you want to articulate
your own argument,

1263
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:07,809
try using your own words,
Alice.

1264
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:09,185
He's using all of us.

1265
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,229
-In your own words!
-What's in this food?

1266
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:12,480
Let's talk about that!

1267
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:15,316
-Where did it come from? Huh?
-(Frank) Oh, I'm sorry,
everyone.

1268
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,734
-I'm sorry.
-Let's just think about it.

1269
01:18:16,818 --> 01:18:18,111
-I'm sorry, Violet.
-(Alice) Victory milk.

1270
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:20,613
-This is an anomaly.
-Victory meat. Victory eggs.

1271
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,156
-It doesn't usually happen.
-It all comes from him.

1272
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,826
She's very sick and she will get
the help that she needs,

1273
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:26,202
-I promise you both.
-Everything we are given

1274
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,453
comes from him!

1275
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:28,871
And it's all about control.

1276
01:18:28,955 --> 01:18:30,790
-It's all about control.
-(Frank laughs)

1277
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:32,750
We wouldn't even--
He might be poisoning the food!

1278
01:18:32,834 --> 01:18:34,168
Enough!

1279
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:39,632
We come to your house,
we sit at your table,

1280
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:43,428
and you insult
and degrade my husband?

1281
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:45,179
He invites you
to be a part of something

1282
01:18:45,263 --> 01:18:47,557
as extraordinary as he is,

1283
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,060
and you sit there
like a spoiled brat,

1284
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:53,855
demanding answers
to questions you've made up.

1285
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:58,192
There's a pattern, isn't there?

1286
01:18:58,276 --> 01:19:02,071
A pattern of selfish,
pampered whining.

1287
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:06,659
Or is it just a desperation
to be exciting?

1288
01:19:07,577 --> 01:19:08,786
Hm?

1289
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,873
Spitting in the face
of this opportunity.

1290
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:18,629
It's heartbreaking that your
sad, desperate paranoia

1291
01:19:18,713 --> 01:19:21,090
could destroy
what we're trying to build.

1292
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:23,551
Hm?

1293
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,432
Well, I won't listen to your
pathetic ranting any longer.

1294
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:35,062
Frank, honey?
I'll be in the car.

1295
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:44,238
-(clicks teeth)
-(door opens)

1296
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:46,324
-(sighing vocally) well...
-(door closes)

1297
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:49,619
Jack, I think you may have
overserved your wife.

1298
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,541
(whispers) Thank you.

1299
01:20:07,178 --> 01:20:08,638
(door opens)

1300
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,227
(sighing)

1301
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:19,148
I was expecting
so much more from you.

1302
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:25,363
(fork clicks on plate)

1303
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:30,159
Good luck, Alice.

1304
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:34,997
Jack, let's talk.

1305
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,961
(door closes)

1306
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:45,633
(moaning angrily)

1307
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,819
(record crackling)

1308
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:13,411
(door opens, shuts)

1309
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,438
Did you enjoy yourself tonight?

1310
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:41,647
What?

1311
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:44,609
No, I didn't
enjoy myself tonight.

1312
01:21:44,692 --> 01:21:47,737
You planned a whole evening
to sabotage me.

1313
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:52,283
No! No, I would never
do that to you.

1314
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:55,995
I would never do that to you.
I love you.

1315
01:21:57,663 --> 01:22:00,374
I'm trying...
I'm trying to save us.

1316
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:04,378
You're trying to save us
by going out there.

1317
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:09,175
Yes, because I saw
a plane crash. I told you.

1318
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:14,096
But Jack, everything I said
at that table is true.

1319
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,973
Frank even admitted it to me.

1320
01:22:16,057 --> 01:22:17,516
He admitted it to me
in the kitchen.

1321
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,853
That's why I did that.
That's why all of that happened.

1322
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,480
He wouldn't have done that.

1323
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:28,611
(deep, shaky breaths)

1324
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:31,864
Jack...

1325
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:34,992
Everyone is acting
like I'm crazy.

1326
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:38,204
And I'm not crazy.

1327
01:22:40,206 --> 01:22:42,500
And I need you to listen to me.

1328
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:47,380
I need you to listen to me.

1329
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,468
Hey.

1330
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:57,306
Hey. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

1331
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:05,773
To me...

1332
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:09,777
you are...

1333
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:12,655
you are bigger
than all of this.

1334
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:16,867
Mm-hm.

1335
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:20,454
You are bigger than Victory.

1336
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:23,499
You are bigger than Frank.

1337
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:26,544
I believe in you.

1338
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:28,713
I believe in you.

1339
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,843
I don't believe in him.

1340
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,388
(whispers)
And I don't trust him.

1341
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,350
And I don't trust this place.

1342
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:47,606
And I don't want
to be here anymore.

1343
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:55,114
I don't want to be here anymore.
And we need to leave.

1344
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:01,245
(sniffles) We need to leave.
And we can go anywhere.

1345
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,956
We can go anywhere
and we can create our own world,

1346
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,292
and it will be you and me
and we'll be okay.

1347
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:09,378
And it's not about where we go,
it's just that we're together.

1348
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:14,759
Please? Please? Please?

1349
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:21,140
Please?

1350
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:26,812
(whispering) Please.

1351
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:29,398
Okay.

1352
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:31,275
(light gasp)

1353
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:35,237
-Okay?
-(breathing deeply)

1354
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,908
(sniffles) Okay.

1355
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:44,622
(voice trembling) Okay?

1356
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:48,000
-Okay.
-(sighs in relief)

1357
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:54,965
(whimpering)

1358
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:01,222
I love you. I love you.

1359
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:06,101
But we need to go tonight.
We need to go. We can't be here.

1360
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:08,729
-(sniffles)
-Hey. Hey.

1361
01:25:10,481 --> 01:25:12,066
(sniffles)

1362
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,445
(both chuckle faintly)

1363
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:21,659
(whispering) I love you.
Let's go.

1364
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:23,118
I love you.

1365
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:26,539
-Okay.
-'Kay. Okay.

1366
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:50,604
-(door shuts)
-(Alice) Jack?

1367
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:54,149
I packed us a snack
in case we drive all night long,

1368
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:56,485
but I think I packed everything.

1369
01:25:57,778 --> 01:25:59,196
Let's go.

1370
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:06,412
Baby, let's go. Come on.

1371
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:08,831
(sniffs) I'm sorry.

1372
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:11,959
What?

1373
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:15,921
I love you so much, Alice.

1374
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:18,841
Baby, what's wrong?

1375
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:21,844
I tried so hard
to keep this from happening.

1376
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:25,097
-What? Let's--
-Please believe...

1377
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,599
Baby, we need to go.
We need to go.

1378
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:29,393
Baby, you need to drive.
We need to go. Go. Whoa.

1379
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:32,563
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-No. No! No!

1380
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:34,982
No, Jack, please!
I can be better!

1381
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:37,026
Alice, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1382
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:39,528
Let me be better, please!
Baby, please!

1383
01:26:39,612 --> 01:26:41,906
-Let me be better. Get off me!
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1384
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:45,868
Let me be better!
I'm so-- Jack, please!

1385
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:49,830
-They're hurting me! No! No!
-(sobbing)

1386
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:54,251
No! Jack! They're hurting me!

1387
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:56,045
They're hurting me!

1388
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:57,588
Fuck!

1389
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:01,175
(sobbing)

1390
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,885
Fuck!

1391
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:12,311
(crying)

1392
01:27:19,485 --> 01:27:22,780
No, please, please.
Please, don't--

1393
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:25,991
(faint, high-pitched whining)

1394
01:27:29,078 --> 01:27:31,205
(muffled screaming)

1395
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:33,707
(intense groaning)

1396
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:36,961
(high-pitched whine)

1397
01:27:38,045 --> 01:27:40,381
(Jack singing melody)
? Darlin' I ?

1398
01:27:41,924 --> 01:27:45,219
? With you all the time ?

1399
01:27:47,054 --> 01:27:49,473
? Can't you see ?

1400
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:52,935
? I long to be ?

1401
01:27:54,228 --> 01:27:56,063
(high-pitched whine continues)

1402
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:58,148
(Jack humming melody)

1403
01:28:02,486 --> 01:28:04,113
(strained, muffled gasping)

1404
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:05,155
(grunts)

1405
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:10,035
(Jack in American accent)
How am I gonna take care of you?

1406
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:11,954
(Alice) Don't say that.

1407
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:14,540
You're gonna get another job.
It's okay.

1408
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:17,001
(Jack) I'm sorry.

1409
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:22,214
(Alice) I'll take extra shifts.
It's not a problem.

1410
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:27,636
(high-pitched whine continues)

1411
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:30,097
(panting lightly)

1412
01:28:41,859 --> 01:28:43,569
-(whine stops)
-(monitor beeping)

1413
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:46,447
(surgeon) Done.
Resident, close her up.

1414
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:48,365
(Alice) Needle holder.

1415
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,410
Forceps.

1416
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:55,748
-(Alice) All right, guys.
'Night. -(woman) 'Night.

1417
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,249
(man) 'Night, doctor.

1418
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,883
(groans, sighing)

1419
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:10,721
(woman 2) Good
night, Dr. Warren.

1420
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:11,805
Good night.

1421
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,354
(door unlocks)

1422
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:21,607
(Frank on computer)
I mean, I suppose

1423
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,734
the primary question is...

1424
01:29:26,487 --> 01:29:27,863
(Jack) You're so late.

1425
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:29,615
I thought you were gonna
be home by ten.

1426
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:32,117
Yeah. So did I.

1427
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:35,370
Surgery ran really long.

1428
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:39,208
Well, I'm starving.
I haven't eaten.

1429
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,168
Why not?

1430
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:44,421
I wasn't sure what you wanted
and you never texted me back.

1431
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:53,180
I don't have my phone
in the OR, Jack.

1432
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:56,100
Well, it'd be nice to know that.

1433
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:12,074
Is the hot water
still not working?

1434
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:14,243
Called the guy.
He couldn't come today.

1435
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,583
Okay, well,
if I can't take a shower,

1436
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:23,252
-I gotta go to bed.
-Come on.

1437
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:24,545
I haven't gotten
to see you all day.

1438
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:26,588
I know, I'm sorry,
but I'm really tired, baby.

1439
01:30:26,672 --> 01:30:29,925
-Dance with me.
-No. No, Jack. Just stop.

1440
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:33,929
I just finished a 30-hour shift,
I sewed up 12 people,

1441
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,556
and I gotta be back
in six hours,

1442
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:37,099
and I'm so tired.

1443
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,518
I just need to go to bed. Okay?

1444
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:55,742
(Frank on computer)
I mean, I suppose

1445
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:58,078
the primary question is...

1446
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:03,500
do you know anyone
who's truly happy? Right?

1447
01:31:03,584 --> 01:31:05,169
Or satisfied?

1448
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:11,675
Modern society
has smothered our true selves,

1449
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:15,679
and driven us
from biological destiny.

1450
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:18,390
I see that version of yourself
that you've buried deep

1451
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:22,519
and that everyone else ignores.

1452
01:31:22,603 --> 01:31:26,481
That... that is the real you.

1453
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:31,945
I know that you are the man
you say you are.

1454
01:31:38,577 --> 01:31:39,786
That's better.

1455
01:31:40,287 --> 01:31:41,747
(Shelley) Welcome home.

1456
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:44,958
("You'd Be So Nice To Come Home
To" by Ruth Brown playing)

1457
01:31:45,042 --> 01:31:46,543
(English accent)
Look who's feeling better.

1458
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:49,171
Thank God! (laughing)

1459
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:51,548
(Alice) Okay, don't shout it
to the whole neighborhood.

1460
01:31:51,632 --> 01:31:53,717
-I'm here.
-Oh! I missed you so much.

1461
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,219
I started writing gossip
in a journal.

1462
01:31:55,302 --> 01:31:57,804
-You did? I should read it then.
-So sad. Hi.

1463
01:31:57,888 --> 01:32:00,224
-Hi!
-Wow, you look sensational!

1464
01:32:00,307 --> 01:32:01,683
Thank you. I feel better.
I feel good.

1465
01:32:01,767 --> 01:32:03,810
-I'm so happy you're back.
-Me, too.

1466
01:32:03,894 --> 01:32:04,645
Hi, Jack.

1467
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:06,980
-Wow! Look at this car.
-You like that?

1468
01:32:07,064 --> 01:32:08,690
Dean's gonna try to have sex
with this vehicle.

1469
01:32:08,774 --> 01:32:10,525
-(cracking up)
-Where is Dean?

1470
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:12,486
He's playing golf with Bill.

1471
01:32:12,569 --> 01:32:13,862
Honey, you should go.

1472
01:32:13,946 --> 01:32:15,614
All you've been doing
is looking after me,

1473
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:17,032
and you deserve
to have some fun.

1474
01:32:17,115 --> 01:32:19,076
Yeah, go. Leave her.
She's mine now.

1475
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:20,994
-We're gonna garden.
-What?

1476
01:32:21,078 --> 01:32:22,246
Just look at plants and drink.

1477
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:23,455
-Right.
-I don't have a garden.

1478
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:24,957
-(both exclaiming happily)
-Okay!

1479
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:28,794
-Bye.
-Bye.

1480
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,635
-I'll see you later. Okay.
-Mm-hm.

1481
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:45,060
(Bunny) Violet
would not stand up.

1482
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:47,104
It was like her ass was glued
to the chair.

1483
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:49,147
(laughing) And Peg!
Peg's face was so red,

1484
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:51,233
I thought her head
was gonna pop off.

1485
01:32:51,942 --> 01:32:57,030
Mm. Peg is, um... Peter's wife.
Always pregnant.

1486
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:00,575
-Right. Yes. Yeah.
-Kinda... Yeah.

1487
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:02,286
Right, okay. Of course. Sorry.

1488
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:06,581
My head's been a bit of a blur
since the treatment.

1489
01:33:07,624 --> 01:33:09,334
-Yeah. Okay.
-It's okay.

1490
01:33:09,418 --> 01:33:12,379
-It'll all come back to you.
-Yeah. Okay.

1491
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:16,174
(gasps) Oh, my goodness!
Uh-oh! Here they come.

1492
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:20,053
Oh, my goodness! Hi!

1493
01:33:20,137 --> 01:33:21,388
(girl) Did you see the sign?

1494
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:24,391
It is the most beautiful sign
I've seen in my life!

1495
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:26,310
Did you hire professional
artists to paint it?

1496
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:28,061
-(girl) We made it ourselves.
-You did? No, you didn't.

1497
01:33:28,145 --> 01:33:30,188
Quick, show me. Come show me!
(gasping playfully)

1498
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:32,357
(girl) I did this part.

1499
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:34,818
(Alice) Can you point to it?
Which bit? Go! Go! Go!

1500
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:36,403
(girl) I did the sunshine
and the letter--

1501
01:33:36,486 --> 01:33:37,779
(Alice)
You did the sunshine and--

1502
01:33:52,753 --> 01:33:54,504
(Shelley)
There is beauty in control.

1503
01:33:54,588 --> 01:33:56,631
There is grace in symmetry.

1504
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:58,300
We move as one.

1505
01:33:58,383 --> 01:33:59,926
(women)
There is beauty in control.

1506
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:02,346
There is grace in symmetry.

1507
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:04,348
We move as one.

1508
01:34:04,431 --> 01:34:07,851
There is beauty in control.
There is grace in symmetry.

1509
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:09,770
We move as one.

1510
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:13,315
There is beauty in control.
There is grace in symmetry.

1511
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:15,734
We move as one.

1512
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:19,696
There is beauty in control.
There is grace in symmetry.

1513
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:21,698
(Shelley) We move as one.

1514
01:34:24,743 --> 01:34:26,578
-Hi.
-Hi.

1515
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:30,624
-It smells amazing.
-Thank you.

1516
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:36,546
-How was your day?
-I don't even remember now.

1517
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:37,881
Good.

1518
01:34:38,799 --> 01:34:42,386
Well, you're a little early,
but I have...

1519
01:34:43,637 --> 01:34:45,555
so many things to finish.

1520
01:34:45,639 --> 01:34:48,809
So I'm gonna need to go
and get things out of the oven.

1521
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:52,187
(laughing)
No, it's gonna burn. No.

1522
01:34:55,941 --> 01:34:58,318
We'll eat first...

1523
01:34:58,402 --> 01:35:00,195
and that should build up
your stamina.

1524
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:06,034
(whispering)
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

1525
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:08,120
? Darlin' I ?

1526
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:11,706
? With you all the time ?

1527
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:14,292
? Can't you see ?

1528
01:35:14,793 --> 01:35:17,254
-(Alice humming along)
-? I long to be ?

1529
01:35:17,337 --> 01:35:20,048
? With you all the time ?

1530
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:22,509
? Now that I ?

1531
01:35:23,135 --> 01:35:25,470
? With you all the time ?

1532
01:35:25,554 --> 01:35:28,223
-? Can't you see ?
-(whispering) Can't you...

1533
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:31,184
-? I long to be ?
-...long to be

1534
01:35:32,102 --> 01:35:34,688
-? With you all the time ?
-With you all the time

1535
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:48,452

Chosen wife: Alice Warren.
Pre-existing relationship: yes.

1543
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:26,781
Do you understand

1544
01:36:26,865 --> 01:36:29,075
-to be a part of this community?
-(Jack) Yes.

1545
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:30,285
(Dr. Collins) Do you understand
the consequences

1546
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:32,412
-of indiscretion?
-(Jack) Yes.

1547
01:36:32,496 --> 01:36:33,914
(Dr. Collins) Are you aware
that you are responsible

1548
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:36,166
for preparing
your home device system?

1549
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:37,250
(Jack) Yes.

1550
01:36:38,502 --> 01:36:40,962
(sighing heavily)

1551
01:36:42,506 --> 01:36:44,049
(Dr. Collins) Do you consent
to the physical and medical

1552
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:46,468
requirements for entry
to Victory?

1553
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:48,136
-(Jack) Yes.
-(Dr. Collins) Are you aware

1554
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:49,846
that you are responsible
for the physical upkeep

1555
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:51,640
of your chosen wife?

1556
01:36:53,183 --> 01:36:55,352
-(breath rasping)
-(Jack) Yes.

1557
01:36:57,646 --> 01:36:59,648
(Dr. Collins) Are you aware that
you must exit the simulation

1558
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:01,650
through Victory Headquarters
every day,

1559
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:04,528
and return only for your
allotted number of hours?

1560
01:37:04,945 --> 01:37:06,154
(Jack) Yes.

1561
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:08,281
(Jack) ? Darlin' I ?

1562
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:11,326
? Miss you all the time ?

1563
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:13,161
? Can't you see ?

1564
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:16,164
? I long to be ?

1565
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:18,959
(Alice whimpering)

1566
01:37:19,042 --> 01:37:21,586
? With you all the time ?

1567
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:26,007
? Can't you see ?

1568
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:29,261
? I long to be ?

1569
01:37:31,221 --> 01:37:33,390
? With you all the time ?

1570
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:42,023
(beeps)

1571
01:37:42,107 --> 01:37:44,192
(Shelley)
Welcome to the Victory Project.

1572
01:37:44,276 --> 01:37:46,987
There are currently
72 active users.

1573
01:37:47,946 --> 01:37:49,781
Your reentry has begun.

1574
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:52,075
(Frank)
...the auspice of equality.

1575
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:56,496
We can fall deeper
into what we know is true,

1576
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,499
that we crave order.

1577
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:03,420
Can we yield
to nature's hierarchy?

1578
01:38:04,671 --> 01:38:08,717
Allow your consciousness
to sink into this world.

1579
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,136
Into this truth.

1580
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:17,767
Sink deeper into the way
things are supposed to be.

1581
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:22,272
(pan clattering)

1582
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:25,483
(panting heavily)

1583
01:38:29,321 --> 01:38:31,948
(moaning loudly)

1584
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:34,993
-Alice?
-(groaning) Don't!

1585
01:38:35,577 --> 01:38:37,579
(panting vocally)

1586
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:39,497
-Okay.
-(yelling)

1587
01:38:39,581 --> 01:38:40,832
Baby, you're having
another episode.

1588
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:42,500
Just take a deep breath.

1589
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:46,546
-It's okay. Just breathe, Alice.
-(groaning)

1590
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:49,549
That's good. Just breathe.

1591
01:38:51,051 --> 01:38:53,845
-That's good.
-(panting slows)

1592
01:39:02,896 --> 01:39:04,689
What did you do?

1593
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:22,707
-Alice, please, just stay calm.
-(gasping loudly)

1594
01:39:25,627 --> 01:39:28,380
(Jack) It's gonna be okay.
I can explain.

1595
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:29,923
What the fuck is going on?

1596
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:31,257
Look at me, you're my wife.

1597
01:39:31,341 --> 01:39:33,551
-What the fuck is happening?
-I love you. I love you.

1598
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:36,638
Oh, no. No.

1599
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:38,932
You can't say that.
You don't love me.

1600
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:41,017
-No, don't do that.
-You don't love me.

1601
01:39:41,101 --> 01:39:42,560
Alice, just think!

1602
01:39:42,644 --> 01:39:45,522
Think about your life
and what you actually want.

1603
01:39:51,945 --> 01:39:53,905
-(whispering) You're psychotic.
-Mm-mm.

1604
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:56,825
I had a life. You took my life.

1605
01:39:56,908 --> 01:39:58,910
No, I saved your life.

1606
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:00,704
-That's not true.
-No, listen to me.

1607
01:40:00,787 --> 01:40:02,372
You worked all the time!

1608
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:05,542
I wanted to work!
I loved working! What?

1609
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:07,127
(Jack) You were miserable.

1610
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:09,754
You were so unhappy.
You hated your life!

1611
01:40:09,838 --> 01:40:12,632
It was my life!

1612
01:40:14,551 --> 01:40:16,344
My life!

1613
01:40:16,428 --> 01:40:18,179
You don't get
to take that from me!

1614
01:40:18,263 --> 01:40:19,931
I gave this to you!

1615
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:25,311
I gave you all of this, Alice!

1616
01:40:28,481 --> 01:40:31,067
We are lucky to be here!

1617
01:40:34,696 --> 01:40:35,989
Frank built this world

1618
01:40:36,072 --> 01:40:39,451
so that we can live
the life that we deserve!

1619
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:42,704
I have to leave every day

1620
01:40:42,787 --> 01:40:44,622
just to make enough money
to keep us here,

1621
01:40:44,706 --> 01:40:46,958
and I fucking hate
every minute of it.

1622
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:49,544
I fucking hate it, Alice!

1623
01:40:50,837 --> 01:40:54,841
You get to stay here.
And you're happy!

1624
01:40:57,802 --> 01:40:59,179
You're happy.

1625
01:41:01,181 --> 01:41:02,891
That's okay.

1626
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:10,982
Alice. We're perfect in here.

1627
01:41:14,944 --> 01:41:16,988
Don't you want to be perfect
with me?

1628
01:41:24,829 --> 01:41:26,790
(angry laugh)
No. No.

1629
01:41:26,873 --> 01:41:30,293
You made me feel like
I was crazy.

1630
01:41:32,253 --> 01:41:34,297
I came to you...

1631
01:41:36,299 --> 01:41:39,761
and you made me feel like
I was fucking crazy.

1632
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:42,096
Alice, I'm so sorry.

1633
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:43,515
(sobs)

1634
01:41:44,182 --> 01:41:46,851
But I don't have to
lie to you anymore.

1635
01:41:48,895 --> 01:41:50,104
Alice...

1636
01:41:50,647 --> 01:41:52,982
-Alice, please, I love you.
-(crying) I know.

1637
01:41:53,066 --> 01:41:55,109
You know I love you.
I would do anything for you.

1638
01:41:55,193 --> 01:41:56,945
You're my whole life.

1639
01:41:57,695 --> 01:42:00,323
I love you. Oh, God.

1640
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:02,659
It's not about where we are,
it's just that we're together.

1641
01:42:02,742 --> 01:42:05,078
You said that.
You said that to me.

1642
01:42:07,247 --> 01:42:08,748
Alice.

1643
01:42:15,755 --> 01:42:18,049
-Alice, I'm so sorry.
-Oh, my God. (sniffles)

1644
01:42:20,927 --> 01:42:22,637
Are there others?

1645
01:42:24,597 --> 01:42:27,058
Are there other people like me?
Where are their bodies?

1646
01:42:28,226 --> 01:42:30,854
-I don't know where they are.
-(crying) Oh, God.

1647
01:42:30,937 --> 01:42:34,023
I don't even know
who the men are. I swear.

1648
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,901
It's not our business.

1649
01:42:36,985 --> 01:42:40,446
A man's responsible for his
own wife and nothing else.

1650
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:47,036
So all the wives
are trapped here?

1651
01:42:50,707 --> 01:42:53,001
(whispering)
Oh, my God, the kids.

1652
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:55,295
No. No, Alice,
the kids aren't real.

1653
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:56,713
-Oh, God.
-They're not real.

1654
01:42:56,796 --> 01:42:58,840
Don't worry about them.
It's you and me.

1655
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:00,383
-Look at me.
-(crying) No, I...

1656
01:43:00,466 --> 01:43:04,220
Don't worry about them.
Look at me. It's you and me.

1657
01:43:04,304 --> 01:43:05,972
Okay? It's you and me.

1658
01:43:06,055 --> 01:43:07,891
-(whimpering)
-Stay with me.

1659
01:43:07,974 --> 01:43:10,393
-I just need-- Mm-hm.
-We're gonna be happy.

1660
01:43:10,476 --> 01:43:13,730
-I just need a second.
-We're gonna be happy here.

1661
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:14,939
No, Jack.

1662
01:43:15,023 --> 01:43:17,233
No, Jack, please. Ple--

1663
01:43:17,317 --> 01:43:21,529
-(gasping for breath)
-(muffled) Stop. Stop. Alice!

1664
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:23,615
(breathless)
No, I need a second--

1665
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:27,410
Get off me! I can't breathe!

1666
01:43:27,493 --> 01:43:30,204
-Get off me! (yells)
-Alice, stop it!

1667
01:43:30,288 --> 01:43:33,833
-(coughing) No! No!
-Stop it, Alice!

1668
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,753
-Stop!
-(grunts loudly)

1669
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:41,507
(Bunny) Alice?

1670
01:43:42,175 --> 01:43:43,551
Alice?

1671
01:43:49,599 --> 01:43:51,601
A-Alice?

1672
01:43:53,686 --> 01:43:55,063
What happened?

1673
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:56,981
(telephone ringing)

1674
01:43:57,065 --> 01:44:00,026
(vinyl record crackling)

1675
01:44:03,947 --> 01:44:05,490
(telephone continues ringing)

1676
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:07,200
(stops record)

1677
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:10,995
What is it?

1678
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:12,997
(Dr. Collins)
Jack Chambers is dead.

1679
01:44:14,332 --> 01:44:16,084
(Bunny) Alice, listen to me.

1680
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,377
No, I need
to tell you something.

1681
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:18,419
No, you need to leave.

1682
01:44:18,503 --> 01:44:20,505
No. This world isn't real.

1683
01:44:20,588 --> 01:44:23,132
-Alice, they're gonna kill you.
-Frank created a program.

1684
01:44:23,216 --> 01:44:25,760
-And he created a world--
-I know. I know.

1685
01:44:25,843 --> 01:44:27,011
-And they're gonna kill you.
-What?

1686
01:44:27,095 --> 01:44:28,346
They're gonna kill you
in the real world.

1687
01:44:28,429 --> 01:44:29,597
They're gonna kill
your real body.

1688
01:44:29,681 --> 01:44:30,807
-What?
-You need to go.

1689
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:32,767
Okay? Oh, my God.

1690
01:44:33,184 --> 01:44:36,479
Alice, if a man dies here,
he dies in the real world.

1691
01:44:36,562 --> 01:44:38,231
Jack can't put you
back in this time.

1692
01:44:38,314 --> 01:44:39,816
He can't put you back in
like he did before.

1693
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:41,442
You need to exit again,
right now.

1694
01:44:41,526 --> 01:44:43,861
Alice, you gotta go.
You can drive. Take Jack's car!

1695
01:44:43,945 --> 01:44:46,030
-You need to go to Headquarters.
-Bunny, answer me!

1696
01:44:46,114 --> 01:44:48,825
-You need to go right now!
-What do you mean, you know?

1697
01:44:49,492 --> 01:44:51,744
(siren blaring outside)

1698
01:44:51,828 --> 01:44:54,080
(panting) Listen...

1699
01:44:54,163 --> 01:44:55,873
I've always known.

1700
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,129
I chose this.

1701
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:07,176
My kids are here.

1702
01:45:08,177 --> 01:45:11,139
-Bunny, your kids aren't real.
-No, they are.

1703
01:45:11,222 --> 01:45:12,974
-They're real to me, Alice.
-Nothing is real.

1704
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:15,268
Because here they're alive!

1705
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:18,062
In here, I didn't lose them.

1706
01:45:18,146 --> 01:45:22,233
Here, I can keep them.
Don't you see?

1707
01:45:26,154 --> 01:45:28,823
What ab--? Do they know?

1708
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:30,491
What about the women,
do they know?

1709
01:45:30,575 --> 01:45:31,743
No.

1710
01:45:33,161 --> 01:45:34,746
They don't know.

1711
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:39,250
(crying)

1712
01:45:46,049 --> 01:45:47,383
Go.

1713
01:45:48,718 --> 01:45:50,178
You have to go.

1714
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:06,778
Christ, Alice,
whose blood is that? Jack!

1715
01:46:09,322 --> 01:46:12,241
(Peter) What's going on?
Where's Jack? Dean?

1716
01:46:12,325 --> 01:46:15,620
Go back inside, Alice.
Sweetheart? Stop.

1717
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:17,955
(Peter) Where is Jack?
What is she doing?

1718
01:46:18,039 --> 01:46:18,956
(Dean) Jack!

1719
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:26,047
(Bill) Honey, let's go inside.

1720
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:27,924
(Peter) We have to go inside,
please.

1721
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:30,009
It's the kids.

1722
01:46:33,012 --> 01:46:35,098
Where is Jack?

1723
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:44,440
Peg. I need you to go inside
to the kids, Peg!

1724
01:46:44,524 --> 01:46:46,234
Peg, she is unwell.

1725
01:46:54,492 --> 01:46:55,952
They said nothing like this
could happen!

1726
01:46:56,035 --> 01:46:57,078
Shut up, Bill!

1727
01:46:57,161 --> 01:46:58,246
(Bill) They promised
it was safe!

1728
01:46:58,329 --> 01:46:59,539
(Peter) Jack!

1729
01:47:06,003 --> 01:47:09,340
(Frank) It's a reminder
of who we are!

1730
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:12,510
We came to save the world
from itself.

1731
01:47:12,593 --> 01:47:16,973
We are a vanguard of a promise.
We are the future.

1732
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:19,142
We are a brotherhood
of brilliance,

1733
01:47:19,225 --> 01:47:21,727
every single one of us.

1734
01:47:22,353 --> 01:47:23,855
(Dr. Collins)
Approaching Victory Portal.

1735
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:27,567
Prepare to exit
in ten, nine, eight...

1736
01:47:27,942 --> 01:47:30,611
-Whose world is this?
-(men) Ours!

1737
01:47:30,695 --> 01:47:32,822
-(Frank) Whose world is this?
-(men) Ours!

1738
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:35,074
-(Frank) Whose world is it?
-(men) Ours!

1739
01:47:35,158 --> 01:47:36,784
-(Frank) Whose world is it?
-(men) Ours!

1740
01:47:36,868 --> 01:47:38,953
-Whose world is it?
-(Bunny) Alice!

1741
01:47:39,954 --> 01:47:42,540
Go! Go, Alice! Go!

1742
01:47:42,623 --> 01:47:43,791
No, no!

1743
01:47:47,003 --> 01:47:48,171
(panting)

1744
01:47:49,005 --> 01:47:51,924
-(shrieks) Get off me!
-They'll find you!

1745
01:48:08,191 --> 01:48:10,818
(tires screeching)

1746
01:48:18,743 --> 01:48:21,245
(cars peeling out)

1747
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:29,003
Please, please, please!
Don't be such a fucking--!

1748
01:48:29,086 --> 01:48:32,882
They said it would not happen!
(exclaiming angrily)

1749
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:49,815
(horn blaring)

1750
01:49:06,791 --> 01:49:09,377
(indistinct chatter on radio)

1751
01:49:34,235 --> 01:49:35,736
(gasping loudly)

1752
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:38,656
Fuck!

1753
01:49:43,703 --> 01:49:45,162
(yells)

1754
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:52,378
(cries out)

1755
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:06,142
(Alice yelling)

1756
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:13,149
Stop her, you idiots!

1757
01:50:14,859 --> 01:50:16,360
(angry yell)

1758
01:50:18,279 --> 01:50:19,697
Stop her!

1759
01:50:29,123 --> 01:50:30,333
(yells)

1760
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:33,461
No, no!

1761
01:50:38,549 --> 01:50:40,676
(gasping)

1762
01:50:57,443 --> 01:50:59,487
(Shelley's voice on radio)
Security level is red.

1763
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:01,405
We are under a
shelter in place.

1764
01:51:01,489 --> 01:51:04,367
Stay inside and await
further instructions.

1765
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:06,327
Attention, Victory residents.

1766
01:51:06,410 --> 01:51:08,162
-Security level is red.
-(telephone ringing)

1767
01:51:08,746 --> 01:51:10,289
(Frank) Where is she?

1768
01:51:10,373 --> 01:51:11,999
-(man) Huge crash.
-(static crackling)

1769
01:51:12,083 --> 01:51:15,336
The two lead cars and Collins.
Collins is dead, sir.

1770
01:51:15,419 --> 01:51:17,797
(Frank) Listen to me,
you do not let her exit!

1771
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,465
If she gets there,
she gets through.

1772
01:51:19,548 --> 01:51:21,092
Who's gonna put her back in?

1773
01:51:21,967 --> 01:51:23,844
-Frank?
-(loud siren wailing)

1774
01:51:23,928 --> 01:51:27,098
Frank, what do we do? Sir?

1775
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:30,267
(knife stabbing)

1776
01:51:30,768 --> 01:51:34,480
You stupid, stupid man.

1777
01:51:40,194 --> 01:51:42,363
(grunting)

1778
01:51:48,119 --> 01:51:49,662
It's my turn now.

1779
01:52:02,758 --> 01:52:05,386
(panting loudly, gasping)

1780
01:52:10,683 --> 01:52:12,184
(screams)

1781
01:52:14,854 --> 01:52:17,273
-No!
-(engine roaring)

1782
01:52:17,857 --> 01:52:18,691
No!

1783
01:52:20,025 --> 01:52:21,861
Come on! Shit!

1784
01:52:32,955 --> 01:52:35,583
(panting loudly)

1785
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:49,305
(yelling)

1786
01:52:55,603 --> 01:52:58,105
(rocks clattering)

1787
01:53:05,863 --> 01:53:06,989
(gasps)

1788
01:53:11,994 --> 01:53:13,746
(yelling with exertion)

1789
01:53:26,675 --> 01:53:28,969
(panting)

1790
01:53:37,436 --> 01:53:38,896
(stops breathing)

1791
01:53:41,357 --> 01:53:43,567
-Don't leave me.
-(exhales)

1792
01:53:53,452 --> 01:53:54,870
(Alice) You and me.

1793
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,040
Always.

1794
01:54:00,042 --> 01:54:01,460
You and me.

1795
01:54:02,336 --> 01:54:05,381
(piano playing melody)

1796
01:54:28,696 --> 01:54:29,822
(gasping)

1797
01:54:35,786 --> 01:54:38,163
(Frank, echoing)
Once we acknowledge that
reality...

1798
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:41,292
we can let go.

1799
01:55:28,339 --> 01:55:31,967
