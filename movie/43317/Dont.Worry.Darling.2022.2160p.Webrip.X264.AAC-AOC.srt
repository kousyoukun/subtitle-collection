1258
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:52,651
- Can't get enough of 'em, right?
- [Groans]

1259
01:12:52,705 --> 01:12:54,384
- [Violet laughs]
- Girls are hard. They are.

1260
01:12:54,408 --> 01:12:56,709
- I'll be right there, all right?
- Thank you.

1261
01:12:58,379 --> 01:13:00,780
You know, Alice tells me you're
a hell of a tennis player.

1262
01:13:00,848 --> 01:13:02,983
- Oh, she does?
- Is that right? Yeah.

1263
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,618
[Jack] She's being polite.

1264
01:13:04,684 --> 01:13:06,329
[Frank] Well, we're looking
for some fierce competitors.

1265
01:13:06,353 --> 01:13:08,098
If you're ever ready
to get out there, call me.

1266
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:09,933
I've heard about that backhand,
though, it's famous.

1267
01:13:09,957 --> 01:13:11,825
[Frank] If you want a partner,
I'm yours, man.

1268
01:13:11,892 --> 01:13:13,726
That's a lot of pressure.
I don't know if...

1269
01:13:13,793 --> 01:13:15,329
Thank you.

1270
01:13:15,396 --> 01:13:17,364
[Chatter stops]

1271
01:13:20,568 --> 01:13:22,136
[Chuckles softly]

1272
01:13:25,339 --> 01:13:27,150
I'm having the fish. I don't
know what you guys are having.

1273
01:13:27,174 --> 01:13:28,943
- [Chatter resumes]
- [Clears throat]

1274
01:13:29,009 --> 01:13:30,444
[Peter] Nice to see
a familiar face.

1275
01:13:30,511 --> 01:13:32,422
[Bill] Um, so anyways,
those windows right there,

1276
01:13:32,446 --> 01:13:33,814
the slatted windows?

1277
01:13:33,881 --> 01:13:35,616
They're actually called
"jalousie" windows.

1278
01:13:35,683 --> 01:13:36,917
Did you know that?

1279
01:13:36,984 --> 01:13:38,395
- You didn't know why.
- [Peter] Oh, boy.

1280
01:13:38,419 --> 01:13:39,653
So, the etymology is...

1281
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:40,964
[In French accent]
"Jealousy."

1282
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:42,199
And you say,
"whose baby is this?"

1283
01:13:42,223 --> 01:13:43,591
And they say, "it's your baby."

1284
01:13:43,657 --> 01:13:45,326
And you say,
"how could that be?"

1285
01:13:45,392 --> 01:13:46,759
And it is your baby.

1286
01:13:46,827 --> 01:13:49,129
And I just do it every year.

1287
01:13:49,196 --> 01:13:52,333
- Violet, where are you from?
- [Chatter subsides]

1288
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:55,336
- Pardon?
- I said, "where are you from?"

1289
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:58,239
Philadelphia.

1290
01:13:58,305 --> 01:14:00,317
- Mm! I'm from Philadelphia!
- [Laughing] Are you serious?

1291
01:14:00,341 --> 01:14:02,042
- I didn't know that.
- I knew I liked you.

1292
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:04,189
[Alice] Most of the women here
are from Philadelphia.

1293
01:14:05,145 --> 01:14:07,514
Or Baltimore. Or Chicago.

1294
01:14:07,581 --> 01:14:08,748
I've noticed.

1295
01:14:08,816 --> 01:14:10,160
[Jack] Mm. Can I
get anyone anything?

1296
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:11,428
[Peg] I for one do not miss
the winters.

1297
01:14:11,452 --> 01:14:13,153
No, no, no.
I thrive in the sunshine,

1298
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,655
even though
I'm alabaster-skinned.

1299
01:14:14,722 --> 01:14:17,124
I love the sunshine.
I love the beach.

1300
01:14:17,191 --> 01:14:18,758
- [Peg] Mm.
- [Jack] She does.

1301
01:14:18,826 --> 01:14:20,294
What was the last beach
you went to?

1302
01:14:20,361 --> 01:14:21,705
[Peter] Oh, fun fact
about the beach.

1303
01:14:21,729 --> 01:14:23,130
- I read this.
- Yeah?

1304
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:24,608
Beaches are actually some
of the filthiest places

1305
01:14:24,632 --> 01:14:26,333
in the whole world.

1306
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,144
- Just a sandbox of disease and...
- Peter! [Chuckles nervously]

1307
01:14:28,168 --> 01:14:29,479
Do not say "disease"
at the dinner table.

1308
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,071
[Peter] It's true.
They need to know.

1309
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:34,508
I can probably guess.
Hilton head? Cape Cod?

1310
01:14:34,575 --> 01:14:36,043
Or the Jersey shore?

1311
01:14:38,512 --> 01:14:41,615
And we all honeymooned
in sea island,

1312
01:14:41,682 --> 01:14:44,885
or the poconos,
or Niagara Falls.

1313
01:14:48,255 --> 01:14:50,391
I think those are popular
honeymoon destinations.

1314
01:14:50,457 --> 01:14:52,660
- Expensive.
- Mm-hm. Beautiful, beautiful.

1315
01:14:52,726 --> 01:14:54,895
Peter, you, uh... you haven't
finished your story.

1316
01:14:54,962 --> 01:14:56,664
[Peter] Mm!
Bill over here's probably

1317
01:14:56,730 --> 01:14:58,608
- one of the worst golf players...
- I'm sorry, Peter.

1318
01:14:58,632 --> 01:15:01,402
I'm not quite finished. Violet,
where did you meet bill?

1319
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,672
Well, we met on a train.

1320
01:15:04,738 --> 01:15:06,240
- To Boston.
- [Violet] To Boston.

1321
01:15:06,307 --> 01:15:07,775
Yeah.

1322
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:10,010
- Yes.
- [Both laughing]

1323
01:15:10,077 --> 01:15:11,712
You dropped your ticket.

1324
01:15:11,779 --> 01:15:14,915
And he bent down, picked it up,
gave it to you, right?

1325
01:15:15,949 --> 01:15:17,217
It is, yeah.

1326
01:15:18,218 --> 01:15:19,987
That's how Margaret met Ted.

1327
01:15:21,622 --> 01:15:23,223
And peg, am I right in thinking

1328
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:25,726
that's how Debbie mcintyre
met her husband?

1329
01:15:25,793 --> 01:15:27,961
Yes, I am. That's how they met.

1330
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:30,230
- Yes, that's true. I'm jealous.
- [Frank] Is it?

1331
01:15:30,297 --> 01:15:31,441
- Honestly, it's such a sweet story.
- [Frank] Wow.

1332
01:15:31,465 --> 01:15:33,000
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [Frank laughs]

1333
01:15:33,067 --> 01:15:33,834
Isn't that funny,
the way those coincidences...

1334
01:15:33,901 --> 01:15:35,536
Incredible.

1335
01:15:35,602 --> 01:15:36,813
[Alice] There are only so many
different stories we're told.

1336
01:15:36,837 --> 01:15:39,306
We're told what we remember.

1337
01:15:39,873 --> 01:15:41,909
Until...

1338
01:15:41,975 --> 01:15:44,645
We try to remember things...

1339
01:15:44,712 --> 01:15:47,381
That they want us to forget.

1340
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:49,917
- Like Margaret.
- Alice...

1341
01:15:49,983 --> 01:15:53,220
No. Jack. It's okay.

1342
01:15:55,155 --> 01:15:57,558
I'm curious to hear
where she's going with this.

1343
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,229
Frank is doing something to us.

1344
01:16:10,137 --> 01:16:12,439
Delusions, memory problems,
hysteria.

1345
01:16:12,506 --> 01:16:15,042
We saw these issues
with Margaret,

1346
01:16:15,109 --> 01:16:17,277
and know that it's, uh,
completely curable.

1347
01:16:17,344 --> 01:16:20,849
Dr. Collins prescribed you
a suite of medications,

1348
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:22,483
which you are
clearly not taking.

1349
01:16:22,549 --> 01:16:23,550
The question is why...

1350
01:16:23,617 --> 01:16:26,320
He's lying to us.
He's lying to all of us.

1351
01:16:26,387 --> 01:16:29,690
Bunny, your best friend,
is worried about you.

1352
01:16:29,757 --> 01:16:31,191
She thinks that you need help.

1353
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:32,726
Is that why she's
not here tonight?

1354
01:16:32,793 --> 01:16:34,371
Because you didn't want
to be reminded of that.

1355
01:16:34,395 --> 01:16:36,096
He's using you.
He's using all of us.

1356
01:16:36,163 --> 01:16:38,108
Do you even know what
the victory project actually is?

1357
01:16:38,132 --> 01:16:41,268
- Have you ever asked?
- Do you?

1358
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:43,537
Is that why you went out there?

1359
01:16:45,874 --> 01:16:47,908
To headquarters?

1360
01:16:49,009 --> 01:16:50,911
What?

1361
01:16:52,346 --> 01:16:53,914
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Alice...

1362
01:16:53,981 --> 01:16:55,191
But you don't know
what he's doing.

1363
01:16:55,215 --> 01:16:56,885
[Frank] You wandered out
by yourself.

1364
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,385
You ignored every rule.

1365
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:01,121
And she put all your lives
in danger.

1366
01:17:05,926 --> 01:17:07,494
Yes, I did go out there

1367
01:17:07,561 --> 01:17:09,339
and I went to headquarters
and I saw what he's hiding.

1368
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:11,007
- [Frank] What I'm hiding.
- [Alice] He's lying to us.

1369
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:12,609
- [Frank] Oh, dear.
- [Alice] He's lying to all of us

1370
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:14,110
about what the victory project
actually is.

1371
01:17:14,134 --> 01:17:14,903
- He's trapped us here.
- [Frank] Alice...

1372
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:16,136
Trapped?

1373
01:17:17,738 --> 01:17:20,607
I hope no one feels trapped.
Do you feel trapped?

1374
01:17:20,674 --> 01:17:21,674
Violet?

1375
01:17:23,277 --> 01:17:25,145
- Peg?
- [Awkward chuckle]

1376
01:17:26,915 --> 01:17:28,749
This is your psychosis.

1377
01:17:28,817 --> 01:17:32,753
You are experiencing trust
as a feeling of entrapment,

1378
01:17:32,821 --> 01:17:35,122
yet you trust every day.

1379
01:17:35,857 --> 01:17:37,157
We all do.

1380
01:17:37,224 --> 01:17:40,694
Tonight, you've trusted us
in your home.

1381
01:17:43,197 --> 01:17:45,632
Just like I trusted you
in my bedroom.

1382
01:17:54,641 --> 01:17:56,677
Alice?

1383
01:17:56,743 --> 01:17:58,178
Do you remember that?

1384
01:18:01,381 --> 01:18:04,051
He's... he's trying
to create a world.

1385
01:18:04,117 --> 01:18:06,095
- If you want to articulate your own argument...
- He's using us.

1386
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:09,156
- Try using your own words, Alice.
- He's using all of us.

1387
01:18:09,223 --> 01:18:11,191
- In your own words!
- What's in this food?

1388
01:18:11,258 --> 01:18:13,060
Let's talk about that!

1389
01:18:13,126 --> 01:18:15,271
- Where did it come from? Huh?
- [Frank] Oh, I'm sorry, everyone.

1390
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,673
- I'm sorry.
- Let's just think about it.

1391
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:18,799
- I'm sorry, Violet.
- [Alice] Victory milk.

1392
01:18:18,867 --> 01:18:20,743
- This is... this is an anomaly.
- [Alice] Victory meat. Victory eggs.

1393
01:18:20,767 --> 01:18:22,178
- It doesn't usually happen.
- [Alice] It all comes from him.

1394
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:24,004
She's very sick

1395
01:18:24,071 --> 01:18:25,816
- and she will get the help that she needs...
- Everything we're told...

1396
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:26,851
- I promise you both.
- Everything we are given

1397
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:27,875
comes from him!

1398
01:18:27,909 --> 01:18:29,142
And it's all about control.

1399
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:30,720
- It's all about control.
- [Frank laughs]

1400
01:18:30,744 --> 01:18:32,814
We wouldn't even...
He might be poisoning the food!

1401
01:18:32,881 --> 01:18:34,114
Enough!

1402
01:18:36,116 --> 01:18:37,484
We come to your house,

1403
01:18:38,252 --> 01:18:39,520
we sit at your table,

1404
01:18:39,586 --> 01:18:43,357
and you insult
and degrade my husband?

1405
01:18:43,423 --> 01:18:45,158
He invites you
to be a part of something

1406
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:47,494
as extraordinary as he is,

1407
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:51,064
and you sit there
like a spoiled brat,

1408
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:53,433
demanding answers

<i>that we crave order.</i>

1717
01:38:00,347 --> 01:38:04,052
<i>Can we yield
to nature's hierarchy?</i>

1718
01:38:04,118 --> 01:38:08,823
<i>Allow your consciousness
to sink into this world.</i>

1719
01:38:08,890 --> 01:38:11,591
<i>Into this truth.</i>

1720
01:38:11,658 --> 01:38:17,664
<i>Sink deeper into the way
things are supposed to be.</i>

[Moaning loudly]

1724
01:38:32,345 --> 01:38:35,415
- Alice?
- [Groaning] Don't!

1725
01:38:35,482 --> 01:38:37,517
[Panting vocally]

1726
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:39,453
- Okay.
- [Alice yelling]

1727
01:38:39,519 --> 01:38:40,922
Baby, you're having
another episode.

1728
01:38:40,988 --> 01:38:43,057
Just take a deep breath.

1729
01:38:43,124 --> 01:38:46,660
- It's okay. Just breathe, Alice.
- [Groaning]

1730
01:38:47,929 --> 01:38:49,563
That's good. Just breathe.

1731
01:38:51,065 --> 01:38:53,767
- That's good.
- [Panting slows]

1732
01:39:02,944 --> 01:39:04,778
What did you do?

1733
01:39:20,427 --> 01:39:22,796
- Alice, please, just stay calm.
- [Gasping loudly]

1734
01:39:25,499 --> 01:39:27,734
[Jack] It's gonna be okay.
I can explain.

1735
01:39:28,502 --> 01:39:29,937
What the fuck is going on?

1736
01:39:30,004 --> 01:39:31,438
Look at me, you're my wife.

1737
01:39:31,505 --> 01:39:33,449
- What the fuck is happening?
- I love you. I love you.

1738
01:39:33,473 --> 01:39:36,510
Oh, no. No.

1739
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,813
You can't say that.
You don't love me.

1740
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,082
- No, don't do that. Don't do that!
- You don't love me.

1741
01:39:41,149 --> 01:39:42,616
Alice, just think!

1742
01:39:42,682 --> 01:39:45,652
Think about your life
and what you actually want.

1743
01:39:51,792 --> 01:39:53,961
- [Whispering] You're psychotic.
- Mm-mm.

1744
01:39:54,028 --> 01:39:55,529
I had a life.

1745
01:39:56,164 --> 01:39:57,364
You took my life.

1746
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:58,799
No, I saved your life.

1747
01:39:58,866 --> 01:40:00,835
- That's not true.
- [Jack] No, listen to me.

1748
01:40:00,902 --> 01:40:02,369
You worked all the time!

1749
01:40:02,435 --> 01:40:05,472
I wanted to work!
I loved working! What?

1750
01:40:05,539 --> 01:40:06,908
[Jack] You were miserable.

1751
01:40:06,974 --> 01:40:09,811
You were so unhappy.
You hated your life!

1752
01:40:09,877 --> 01:40:12,746
It was my life!

1753
01:40:14,648 --> 01:40:16,349
My life!

1754
01:40:16,416 --> 01:40:18,219
You don't get
to take that from me!

1755
01:40:18,286 --> 01:40:19,987
I gave this to you!

1756
01:40:22,489 --> 01:40:24,959
I gave you all of this, Alice!

1757
01:40:28,495 --> 01:40:30,797
We are lucky to be here!

1758
01:40:34,634 --> 01:40:35,970
Frank built this world

1759
01:40:36,037 --> 01:40:39,606
so that we can live
the life that we deserve!

1760
01:40:40,707 --> 01:40:42,642
I have to leave every day

1761
01:40:42,709 --> 01:40:44,578
just to make enough money
to keep us here,

1762
01:40:44,644 --> 01:40:47,048
and I fucking hate
every minute of it.

1763
01:40:47,114 --> 01:40:49,683
I fucking hate it, Alice!

1764
01:40:50,717 --> 01:40:53,054
You get to stay here.

1765
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,922
And you're happy!

1766
01:40:57,892 --> 01:40:58,926
You're happy.

1767
01:41:01,195 --> 01:41:02,662
That's okay.

1768
01:41:07,168 --> 01:41:09,103
Alice.

1769
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:10,770
We're perfect in here.

1770
01:41:14,809 --> 01:41:17,044
Don't you want to be perfect
with me?

1771
01:41:24,718 --> 01:41:26,686
[Laughs angrily] No. No.

1772
01:41:26,753 --> 01:41:29,756
You made me feel like
I was crazy.

1773
01:41:32,326 --> 01:41:34,594
I came to you...

1774
01:41:36,163 --> 01:41:39,699
And you made me feel like
I was fucking crazy.

1775
01:41:39,766 --> 01:41:42,169
Alice, I'm so sorry.

1776
01:41:42,236 --> 01:41:43,971
[Sobs]

1777
01:41:44,038 --> 01:41:46,941
But I don't have to
lie to you anymore.

1778
01:41:49,010 --> 01:41:50,543
Alice...

1779
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:52,880
- Alice, please, I love you.
- [Crying] I know.

1780
01:41:52,947 --> 01:41:55,182
You know I love you.
I would do anything for you.

1781
01:41:55,249 --> 01:41:56,583
You're my whole life.

1782
01:41:57,617 --> 01:42:00,487
I love you. Oh, god.

1783
01:42:00,553 --> 01:42:02,665
It's not about where we are,
it's just that we're together.

1784
01:42:02,689 --> 01:42:05,126
You said that.
You said that to me.

1785
01:42:07,295 --> 01:42:08,896
Alice.

1786
01:42:15,702 --> 01:42:18,105
- Alice, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my god. [Sniffles]

1787
01:42:21,075 --> 01:42:22,575
Are there others?

1788
01:42:24,412 --> 01:42:28,015
Are there other people like me?
Where are their bodies?

1789
01:42:28,082 --> 01:42:30,151
- I don't know where they are.
- [Crying] Oh, god.

1790
01:42:30,217 --> 01:42:31,451
I don't know where they are.

1791
01:42:31,518 --> 01:42:33,753
I don't even know
who the men are. I swear.

1792
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:36,824
It's not our business.

1793
01:42:36,891 --> 01:42:40,127
A man's responsible for his
own wife and nothing else.

1794
01:42:44,564 --> 01:42:46,733
So all the wives
are trapped here?

1795
01:42:50,637 --> 01:42:52,907
- [Whispering] Oh, my god, the kids.
- No.

1796
01:42:52,974 --> 01:42:54,974
- Oh, my god.
- No. No, Alice, the kids aren't real.

1797
01:42:55,009 --> 01:42:56,609
- Oh, god.
- They're not real.

1798
01:42:56,676 --> 01:42:58,712
Don't worry about them.
It's you and me.

1799
01:42:58,778 --> 01:43:00,147
- Look at me.
- [Crying] No, I...

1800
01:43:00,214 --> 01:43:02,316
Don't worry about them.
Look at me.

1801
01:43:02,383 --> 01:43:04,218
Look at me. It's you and me.

1802
01:43:04,285 --> 01:43:05,719
Okay? It's you and me.

1803
01:43:05,785 --> 01:43:07,620
- [Whimpering]
- Stay with me.

1804
01:43:07,687 --> 01:43:10,124
- I just need... mm-hm.
- It's okay. We're gonna be happy.

1805
01:43:10,191 --> 01:43:11,902
- I just need a second.
- We're gonna be happy here.

1806
01:43:11,926 --> 01:43:13,870
- I just need a second. Yeah?
- We're gonna be happy.

1807
01:43:13,894 --> 01:43:15,062
No, Jack.

1808

No, Jack, please.

- [Muffled] Stop. Stop. Alice!

1810
01:43:22,003 --> 01:43:23,871
[Breathless]
No, I need a second...

1811
01:43:23,938 --> 01:43:27,441
Get off me! I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

1812
01:43:27,507 --> 01:43:30,077
- Get off me! [Yells]
- Alice, stop it!

1813
01:43:30,144 --> 01:43:33,280
- [Coughing] No! No!
- Stop it, Alice!

1814
01:43:33,347 --> 01:43:35,182
No. No!

1815

[Bunny] Alice, listen to me.

1827
01:44:16,123 --> 01:44:17,467
No, I need
to tell you something, bunny.

1828
01:44:17,491 --> 01:44:18,526
No, you need to leave.

1829
01:44:18,591 --> 01:44:20,161
No. This world isn't real.

1830
01:44:20,227 --> 01:44:23,030
- Alice, they're gonna kill you.
- Frank created a program.

1831
01:44:23,097 --> 01:44:25,765
- And he created a world and its...
- I know. I know.

1832
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:27,177
- And they're gonna kill you.
- What?

1833
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:28,869
They're gonna kill you
in the real world.

1834

- They're gonna kill your real body.
- What?

1835
01:44:29,937 --> 01:44:31,038
- You need to go.
- What?

Okay? Oh, my god.

Alice, if a man dies here,
he dies in the real world.

Jack can't put you
back in this time.

1839
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:39,755
He can't put you back in
like he did before.

1840
01:44:39,779 --> 01:44:41,315
You need to exit again,
right now.

1841
01:44:41,382 --> 01:44:43,583
Alice, you gotta go.
You can drive. Take Jack's car!

1842
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:45,953

[Panting] Listen...

01:44:54,228 --> 01:44:55,229
I've always known.

1847
01:44:59,467 --> 01:45:00,467
I chose this.

1848
01:45:04,604 --> 01:45:08,075
My kids are here.

1849
01:45:08,142 --> 01:45:10,344
- Bunny, your kids aren't real.
- No, they are.

- Kids aren't real here.
- No, they are.

- They're real to me. They're real to me, Alice.

- Nothing...
- Because here they're alive!

In here, I didn't lose them.

What about the women,
do they know?

No.

You have to go.
