1
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:53,620
- Wait!

2
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:05,921
- Have you looked thru' them?

3
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,114
- Are you sure you are up for this?

4
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,911
- Can't Mrs MacLeod be nervous?

5
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:17,653
- Anna....

6
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:13,957
- Methos, try and listen to what I'm saying.
- Reggie, calm down, tell me what's going on.

7
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:19,414
- Over the past week, the planets of our solar system
have moved outside their orbital paths

8
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:20,997
- and are coming into alignment.

9
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,881
-  I mean, do you know how unusual that is?

10
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:26,759
- There's no simple way to explain this.

11
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:29,317
- But that could just be orbital wobble.

12
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:31,533
- How can that be possible?

13
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:35,949
- Orbital wobble is one thing, but this...

14
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:40,417
- This is outside the laws of celestial mechanics.

15
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:51,316
- And that's not all.

16
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:57,134
- Literally millions of celestial bodies from here to the 
central Sun of our galaxy are lining up.

17
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,956
- When that alignment is complete....

18
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:04,490
- In exactly 4 days, 3 hours, 47 minutes,

19
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:07,629
- The Earth is going to be bombarded with cosmic radiation.

20
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:09,877
- The moment of The Source.

21
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,744
- The Light of the cosmos is literally reaching out to us.

22
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:19,292
- Aye...

23
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:22,037
- What about Zai? Did we hear from him?

24
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:24,745
- No... Nah, he's overdue.

25
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:27,543
- Isn’t your friend MacLeod there? Can't he help?

26
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:31,236
- MacLeod is...

27
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,858
- Not the man he once was...

28
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:35,846
- Well, just try...

29
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:47,519
- I can't stay with you Duncan.
- Why?

30
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:50,087
- Duncan.....

31
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:44,480
- Hey, Hey you.

32
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,455
- Please something to eat...

33
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:12,781
- Oh God thank you. Thank you...
Thank you.

34
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:54,941
- Hey! Stop!
- No! No.... No!

35
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,827
 - Food..... Food.....

36
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,968
- Thank you.

37
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:40,998
- Ugh.... Hi.
- Hi.

38
00:12:42,743 --> 00:12:44,414
- Is it good?
- Uhuh.

39
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:17,082
- Oh, God... I hate that....

40
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:38,354
- Yes..

41
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,636
- There can be only one.
- Voice match accepted.

42
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:56,437
- Login confirmed.

43
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:58,678
- Connecting
- Yes!

44
00:13:59,024 --> 00:13:59,965
- Signal acquired

45
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:06,622
- Are you sure when the alignment will be complete...
- Guys!

46
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:09,286
- Come on... - Four days at most....
- Dammit!!

47
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,592
- They are going crazy out there.

48
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:31,438
- I suspect some big messy thing
are all going down the toilet

49
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:57,468
- Reg!
- Z... where the hell have you been, man?

50
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:02,452
- Reg, there's no time... It’s coming down... 
I think I found it.

51
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,557
- Where is Giovanni?
- What do you find Zai?

52
00:15:05,994 --> 00:15:10,830
- I found ancient writings in Gaza.... I followed them...
they took me to central Europe....

53
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,585
- And I found the location of the source.

54
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:24,049
- Z, I'm losing you mate...
Try and stabilize your signal.

55
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:27,343
- Zai... easy okay. From the beginning.
- I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

56
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:33,267
- Zai.... you do God's work.

57
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:37,239
- Don't be afraid.
- Your Eminence.

58
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:38,655
- Tell us what you found.

59
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:43,361
- The ancient writings I found In Gaza....
I followed them...

60
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:48,628
- They took me to central Europe....
then I knew I was getting close....

61
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,346
- I found a monastery where the monks 
studied an ancient text....

62
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:55,957
- That spoke of The Source.

63
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,227
- One of the monks took me to a place where
it last happened over 10,000 years ago.

64
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:05,076
- I feel the power of this place...

65
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:08,412
-And then.... he appeared...

66
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:16,223
- So I ran.... And I ran....

67
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,849
- He has risen...

68
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,407
- The Guardian....

69
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:30,515
- Signal failure...

70
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:40,525
- Reacquiring signal... Signal reacquired...

71
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:45,091
- I always thought the Guardian was bullshit.
- He's the immortal antichrist.

72
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,080
- The false prophet created in evil....

73
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,735
- Well if he's such a bad boy...
why did't he take Zai's head?

74
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:54,226
- To get to us...
He knows Zai's not alone.

75
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:57,097
- You think he knows we are looking for the source?

76
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:59,458
- He must...
- Signal acquired.

77
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:05,485
- He's more than an immortal...
- Zai... where is the Location of the Source?

78
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:09,678
- He's like...like death.
- Zai, you're in danger.

79
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,647
- Zai.... The location.
- He's coming.

80
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:22,550
- Zai! Get outta there.
- What have you learnt? Give us something...

81
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,265
- I've written the co-ordinates down on
this map.... the co-ordinates are...

82
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:29,785
- The co-ordinates are on...

83
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:36,455
- Okay, you have to get to the monastery.
you have to find the monks that bear the symbol

84
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,776
- Of the Brothers of Doleo.

85
00:17:39,863 --> 00:17:42,757
- They will help you find The Source.

86
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,614
- Zai.... you have to get out of there....
- Zai... we have enough... Save youself..

87
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:51,618
- Pray for me..... Father.

88
00:17:53,062 --> 00:17:54,777
- Reg...

89
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:58,154
- Did you get the signal back? Did you get the signal back?
- Requiem aeternam Dona eis Domine--

90
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:02,535
- Zai!- Zai!
- Arghh!

91
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:15,820
- What he mean by Delio Brothers?

92
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,871
- Brothers of pain.

93
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:19,865
- Sounds like a foul bunch.

94
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:23,224
- They're an ancient religious order in estern Europe...

95
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,771
- They are not a religious order...

96
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:28,748
- They are an heretical cult..

97
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,313
- But their Elder might be able to help us.

98
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:37,624
- Their elder corrupted his monks.... turned them from 
the true faith during the fall of Rome...

99
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:40,982
- Rome is a long time ago my friend.

100
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:43,828
- Not for me, it wasn't...

101
00:18:44,134 --> 00:18:46,643
- Giovanni, this could be it!
- Guys!!

102
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:50,326
- If this Elder could help us, who gives a toss?

103
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:53,274
- Let's go and find him..

104
00:19:00,876 --> 00:19:02,377
 - Zai’s no Jack-the-Lad.

105
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:05,352
- He can handle himself... 
He's got a shot... right?

106
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:33,174
- Joe...
- Methos... What do you got?

107
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:38,498
- The Guardian is awake....
Find MacLeod...

108
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,341
- There can be only me...

109
00:23:46,052 --> 00:23:48,211
- Hello....

110
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:54,425
- This is the end of time....!!!

111
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:03,111
- You think I'm mad?
Maybe a little bit crazy...

112
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:04,455
- What are you?

113
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:06,561
- I’m The Guardian...

114
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:10,388
- Question is.... who are you?

115
00:24:11,553 --> 00:24:14,236
- I'm Duncan MacLeod...
- I'm Duncan MacLeod...

116
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:19,021
- I'm Duncan MacLeod.... I'm Duncan MacLeod...
I'm Duncan MacLeod....

117
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,946
- You have squandered your precious gift!

118
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:27,519
- You could have ruled the world...
...and you pissed it away...

119
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:31,718
- Have a nice day...
- The female, Anna...

120
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:37,104
- She's not for you...
- What's Anna got to do with this?

121
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,583
- Nothing..Everything...Nothing..Everything...
..Nothing..Everything...

122
00:24:45,126 --> 00:24:49,257
- It's time for me and you to dance.
- In that outfit?

123
00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:53,557
- Foreplay....

124
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:03,010
- Let's go...

125
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:30,025
- Okay...

126
00:25:38,422 --> 00:25:43,465
- Are you the One, MacLeod... MacLeod?
 Would you kill to be the One?

127
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:47,214
- Would you kill her, MacLeod?

128
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:57,776
- Hello... Joe!

129
00:26:05,354 --> 00:26:06,923
- Joe...
- Get In the car...

130
00:26:07,336 --> 00:26:10,222
- Get out of here, Joe.
- I don't have time for this bullshit.

131
00:26:10,645 --> 00:26:12,811
- Get In the car!!
- What are you doing?

132
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:45,496
- Seek The Source...

133
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:29,029
- Seek The Source...

134
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:31,075
- What...?

135
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,466
- The Source....

136
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:10,053
- Joe....
- Before you get all whacked out, just listen...

137
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,869
- Joe, stop the car...

138
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,629
- Stop the damn car...

139
00:28:16,693 --> 00:28:19,241
- You're a Watcher... you can't interfere...
- I just said fuck it..

140
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:24,817
- You took an oath...
- There is no Watcher organization anymore...

141
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:27,274
- Most of my people are dead....

142
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:30,858
- You shouldn’t have interfered...

143
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:33,919
- If I hadn't... you'd be dead.

144
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:39,577
- Sure, fine.. Go ahead...Go back and let that thing kill you... 
What do you have to live for anyway?

145
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:45,867
- He mentioned Anna...
- Have you even talked to her?

146
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,534
- No, not in months...
and don't give me the ends of day bullshit.

147
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:55,087
- Methos and others don't think it's bullshit... 
They're looking for the source...

148
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:58,649
- Oh, the Source...
- You can join them and find out what that’s about..

149
00:28:59,263 --> 00:29:01,045
- And see what it has to do with Anna..

150
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:04,901
- Or you can go back and play with that freak...
It’s your call...

151
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:10,966
- Can't believe I’m letting you drag me into this...

152
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:27,283
- I know this is going to be hard to explain, but...
I’m Immortal....

153
00:29:31,524 --> 00:29:33,154
- It's just a dream..

154
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,287
- I was born In the Highland’s
of Scotland in 1592.

155
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:45,436
- It's more than a dream Duncan.

156
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:48,901
- Anna...

157
00:29:49,648 --> 00:29:51,020
- Nothing will hurt you...

158
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:57,823
- So you're not gonna grow old?
- This is how I am.

159
00:30:02,195 --> 00:30:04,195
- I’m going to grow old, though...

160
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:07,375
- Will you still love me when I’m old?

161
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,436
- I’ll always love you...

162
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:18,111
- I’m leaving.... I can't stay with you, Duncan..

163
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:25,248
- Why?
- You mean everything to me...

164
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,329
- But it’s not enough...

165
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:30,952
- What do you mean I mean everything to you ...
...but it's not enough?

166
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:33,228
- That doesn't make sense Anna...
- I can't!

167
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,840
- What do you want from me?

168
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:49,542
- The Impossible...

169
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,149
- I want a child...

170
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:53,827
- A child...

171
00:31:50,264 --> 00:31:51,679
- It’s good to see you, G...

172
00:31:57,154 --> 00:31:59,016
- Who are you?
- I'm Duncan MacLeod...

173
00:31:59,724 --> 00:32:04,014
- MacLeod... MacLeod...
 May I ask you what you're doing here?

174
00:32:06,273 --> 00:32:09,846
- Reggie Weller...
- My astronomer...

175
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,298
- And part time cultural stereo type...

176
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:16,777
- Sure,you are...
- Funny... Who's that?

177
00:32:17,507 --> 00:32:21,599
- It's Joe Dawson, a friend of mine.
- Hey...

178
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,109
- Methos.......
Been a long time...

179
00:32:32,969 --> 00:32:34,702
- This is different...

180
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:41,567
-Times are different... MacLeod...
- Yeah... 

181
00:32:42,037 --> 00:32:44,471
- Leather’s a really good look for you...
Methos...

182
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:49,832
- Giovanni...

183
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,478
- I hear you're on a quest for the Source...
- You make it sound so grand...

184
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:01,650
- We are here to get information...

185
00:33:02,617 --> 00:33:04,654
- Brave men died to get us this far...

186
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:12,063
- Brothers of Doleo.. Rumours have it they've been 
governed by the same Elder for thousands of years...

187
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,787
- One of us?
- I'm thinking so...

188
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:17,582
- Well let's find out...

189
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:26,275
- What's a man of the cloth doing on 
the quest for the source...

190
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:31,935
- I am here for the greater glory of God...
- But if you don't like what you find?

191
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:38,572
- You assume there will be an inherent contradiction 
between what we will encounter and the Gospel..

192
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:43,214
- I know that will not be the case...
- You seem very certain of that...

193
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:48,525
- Doesn't it? The Lord guides our
hands on this holy quest...

194
00:33:49,788 --> 00:33:51,823
- We are all in His service...

195
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:56,480
- Question is, Duncan MacLeod...
Are you?

196
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,485
- I had a sneaky suspicion you'd know where to find him...
- Yeah, well...

197
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:05,653
- You know I did it for him and not for you...
- Sure...

198
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:16,173
- What do you want?
- We have come to see your Elder...

199
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:18,791
- We have no Elder...

200
00:34:22,984 --> 00:34:24,339
- That went well...

201
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:37,906
- Oi! You! Open this door!

202
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:42,347
- Right!

203
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:50,469
- Aaah!!!

204
00:35:00,654 --> 00:35:01,449
- Wait a minute...

205
00:35:06,265 --> 00:35:07,155
- Who's that?

206
00:35:08,592 --> 00:35:09,794
- That's my wife...

207
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:16,583
- Hello...

208
00:35:19,026 --> 00:35:20,477
- I can explain...

209
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:30,511
- Stop!

210
00:35:37,394 --> 00:35:41,425
- The Elder will see you.....
Now that she is here...

211
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:00,837
- Hello Anna Teshemka...

212
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,934
- Hello Duncan MacLeod...

213
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:15,959
- You look like shit...

214
00:36:20,974 --> 00:36:24,728
- What are you doing here?
- Look, I have so much to tell you...

215
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:27,294
- You won't even believe what’s been happening to me?
- Lead us...

216
00:36:29,283 --> 00:36:30,800
- Duncan, I have visions...

217
00:36:31,632 --> 00:36:37,989
- Seriously, I saw this... I saw you... I saw all of you...
- Come, girl... I’m near...

218
00:37:33,098 --> 00:37:36,614
- Look... well....

219
00:37:41,944 --> 00:37:45,674
- There are worse things than death...

220
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:49,335
- Apparently...

221
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:55,983
- What do you want?
- We seek the Source...

222
00:38:06,556 --> 00:38:10,927
- Are you willing to pay the price?

223
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:22,761
- That's fixed...
- Thank you.

224
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:27,894
- Hoo! Hello.
- Yeah. That's a sweet piece... But a..

225
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:31,297
- This is my beat, okay, Reggie?
- Sorry...

226
00:38:36,962 --> 00:38:37,600
- What is it?

227
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:42,072
- I don't know...

228
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:55,904
- So you have encountered the Guardian...
a riddle that cannot be solved...

229
00:38:59,192 --> 00:39:03,955
- A force that cannot be defeated...

230
00:39:06,237 --> 00:39:08,046
- Man... that's one fast bird...

231
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,441
- You stay here...

232
00:39:14,157 --> 00:39:15,668
- I can take care of this...

233
00:39:19,077 --> 00:39:28,847
- I was once like you...
long ago, before recorded time...

234
00:39:29,764 --> 00:39:36,152
- Like now, the world had fallen into chaos...

235
00:39:36,932 --> 00:39:42,044
- The people cried out for a redeemer...

236
00:39:43,122 --> 00:39:48,168
- Do any of you have redeeming quality?

237
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,144
- Greetings, brother...
- This is holy ground!

238
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:18,996
- We were a group much like yours...

239
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:27,601
- All of us immortals from different tribes...
All seeking the truth....

240
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:33,388
- We all thought we would find the answer,
In the Source...

241
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:40,119
- But there were darker...
Secret desires in our hearts...

242
00:40:43,592 --> 00:40:46,042
- The journey was long...

243
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:52,863
- Our tempers flared... and being immortals...
...heads were taken...

244
00:40:56,792 --> 00:41:03,158
- Finally, there were only three of us left...
the strongest of our kind...

245
00:41:07,483 --> 00:41:14,079
- But the ancient one gaurding the source...
...was stronger still...

246
00:41:28,764 --> 00:41:35,922
- My friend fought valiantly...
...but I wanted my immortality...

247
00:41:43,307 --> 00:41:48,876
- The source wasn't mine to take...
Something went terribly wrong...

248
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:53,390
- It left us both cursed...

249
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:58,798
- Both, for ever...
...decaying...

250
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:02,772
- Me like this...

251
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:09,963
- And he doomed to take his place
as the Guardian...

252
00:42:13,332 --> 00:42:16,541
- You like graveyards?
I love 'em...

253
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:19,760
- I mean, who wants to live forever?

254
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:25,542
- Who wants to live forever?

255
00:42:26,473 --> 00:42:31,067
- Can you tell us the way to the Source?

256
00:42:32,697 --> 00:42:41,767
- You should ask her....
She's already seen the way...

257
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:45,351
- Come....

258
00:42:49,989 --> 00:42:50,812
- Anna..

259
00:42:54,193 --> 00:42:55,464
- It's alright...

260
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:14,332
- A child....

261
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,172
- It calls to you, does it not?

262
00:43:21,524 --> 00:43:26,258
- This is blasphemy!
- It is truth!

263
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,325
- Don't touch her...
- It's okay...

264
00:43:41,845 --> 00:43:47,852
- Follow the signs...
As for you lot...

265
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:50,852
- Follow the woman...

266
00:43:51,142 --> 00:43:52,633
- The women...
- Anna...

267
00:43:54,402 --> 00:43:59,308
- What did you see?
- Stars, worlds...

268
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:08,354
- A warning... as you get closer to the Source...
you will grow weaker...

269
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:17,231
- What's in it for you?
- Release....

270
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,504
- Release!

271
00:44:35,408 --> 00:44:37,644
- There can be only one...

272
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:42,198
- Maybe... but they weren't talking about you...

273
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,450
- Joe!

274
00:44:46,781 --> 00:44:48,615
- Man, come on! Have a shot!

275
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,856
- To the right...

276
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,301
- Come on!!

277
00:45:00,223 --> 00:45:00,949
- Ouch....

278
00:45:09,138 --> 00:45:11,346
- MacLeod!

279
00:45:21,293 --> 00:45:22,419
- No!!!!

280
00:45:25,545 --> 00:45:26,831
- Joe!!!

281
00:45:30,998 --> 00:45:31,724
- Joe!!!

282
00:45:34,146 --> 00:45:37,620
- Thank you... you've been a wonderful audience
good night!

283
00:45:40,163 --> 00:45:42,293
- Joe! Get me a bandage...

284
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,036
- Just get anything...

285
00:45:44,582 --> 00:45:45,334
- Joe...

286
00:45:48,535 --> 00:45:50,276
- Methos, you're a doctor... do something...

287
00:45:52,163 --> 00:45:53,702
- Oh, Joseph...

288
00:45:57,106 --> 00:46:01,717
- You shouldn’t have interfered...
- Most fun I’ve had in years...

289
00:46:04,198 --> 00:46:09,941
- MacLeod... Knowing you...
Watching you...

290
00:46:11,713 --> 00:46:16,973
- Was an honour... It’s been my greatest--

291
00:46:19,292 --> 00:46:27,208
- MacLeod, you...are...My...best friend...

292
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:29,664
- You're my best friend, Joe...

293
00:46:30,948 --> 00:46:33,367
- You are the father that never kick me out...

294
00:46:41,325 --> 00:46:47,389
- If there can be only one...
- It was never good for me..

295
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,994
- You can't cheat me now, Mac...

296
00:46:54,335 --> 00:46:58,757
- It’s...your destiny...
- No...

297
00:47:00,139 --> 00:47:04,985
- Joe...
- Holy Mary, Mother of God... Pray for us...

298
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:07,872
- Joe..

299
00:48:05,503 --> 00:48:07,249
- Amen....

300
00:48:09,622 --> 00:48:10,376
- Amen...

301
00:48:27,389 --> 00:48:28,286
- I’m done...

302
00:48:32,803 --> 00:48:34,528
- Didn't go quite as planned, huh?

303
00:48:35,091 --> 00:48:37,582
- Don't be glimp... Not now...

304
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:40,043
- Why are you upset, MacLeod?

305
00:48:41,525 --> 00:48:45,267
- Is it because Joe died? Or because you, 
the great Highlander couldn’t save him?

306
00:48:46,116 --> 00:48:49,389
- Go to hell...
- Is this the new MacLeod?

307
00:48:51,503 --> 00:48:55,545
- Someone who's going to betray the memory 
of his friend? Betray his history and his Clan?

308
00:48:56,307 --> 00:48:57,255
- You quitter...

309
00:48:59,204 --> 00:49:00,768
- Move it, MacLeod...
- Oh, no...

310
00:49:01,252 --> 00:49:04,109
- This is holy ground!
- I don't care!

311
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:06,140
- No!
- Get up!

312
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:09,779
- This is what we do...

313
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,987
- Do you know why he interfered?
- Why?

314
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,445
- It wasn't for me.. It was for you...

315
00:49:16,523 --> 00:49:22,261
- So that you might be the One... And now 
you're going to piss on his grave? Well, come on!

316
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:26,668
- You can hide behind that bullshit, Methos..
But if you're looking For someone to blame..

317
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,239
- Blame yourself!

318
00:49:30,953 --> 00:49:33,325
- We're leaving...
- No... I’m not...

319
00:49:34,913 --> 00:49:36,736
- I have to go with them...
- What?

320
00:49:38,102 --> 00:49:41,034
- It’s not your choice, Duncan, it’s mine.
- Anna...

321
00:49:41,901 --> 00:49:44,493
- I need to find the source...
- What do you want?

322
00:49:45,124 --> 00:49:47,575
- You want me to bury you next to Joe?

323
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:49,592
- Then stay with me...

324
00:49:50,845 --> 00:49:52,443
- You said nothing would hurt me.

325
00:49:58,472 --> 00:50:02,729
- I was chosen for this.. and so were you...

326
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:06,578
- Anna, this doesn't make sense.
- Yes, it does...

327
00:50:09,953 --> 00:50:10,760
- Look...

328
00:50:16,373 --> 00:50:18,406
- It calls to us...

329
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:22,668
- I saw it before..

330
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:26,261
- But it was over me like a cathedral...

331
00:50:28,098 --> 00:50:28,979
- Reggie...

332
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:32,579
- Yeah, yeah, I’m on it.
- Where?

333
00:50:36,903 --> 00:50:39,623
- Water... We need to go by water...

334
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,174
- The alignment is centred over an island...

335
00:50:45,356 --> 00:50:46,975
- Like the Lady said...

336
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:51,201
- We need a boat...

337
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:09,492
- I thought you would have found someone else
to have those kids with...

338
00:52:13,968 --> 00:52:17,767
- I don't want just someone's kids.. 

339
00:52:21,494 --> 00:52:24,963
- Duncan... I made a choice...

340
00:52:28,257 --> 00:52:31,847
- It went against everything I felt for you...

341
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:37,245
- You think it’s a coincidence..
We ran into each other?

342
00:52:38,097 --> 00:52:41,152
- Something, some power, is guiding us...

343
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:45,770
- Can that power bring Joe back?

344
00:52:59,586 --> 00:53:00,997
- We need to dock...

345
00:53:01,764 --> 00:53:04,133
- Impossible...
- Why?

346
00:53:05,294 --> 00:53:11,623
- Look.. Over there...There are maniacs
On that island, cannibals...

347
00:53:12,306 --> 00:53:14,370
- They must have seized the port...

348
00:53:15,444 --> 00:53:18,812
- That was Carl Louis, the port captain...

349
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:21,380
- I have no wish to join him...

350
00:53:23,184 --> 00:53:25,409
- I have no choice... the Lady has a date...

351
00:53:28,034 --> 00:53:31,962
- There is nothing there but death...
- There's death everywhere...

352
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:34,207
- May God take his soul...

353
00:54:47,226 --> 00:54:48,968
- Light.... Ha..ha...ha

354
00:54:51,312 --> 00:54:52,917
- We're not gonna let them do that, are we?

355
00:54:54,653 --> 00:54:55,686
- No, we're not...

356
00:54:59,887 --> 00:55:02,832
- Reggie.... Reggie...

357
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:10,353
- Reggie... Stop...

358
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:20,051
- I fucking Love this!
- Duck!

359
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:32,045
- What are you doing?
- God is mercyfull... Even in death...

360
00:56:40,316 --> 00:56:41,391
- Duncan!!

361
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:47,745
- Duncan!!

362
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,565
- Everyone get down!

363
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:51,083
- So here we are... Born to be kings..

364
00:57:51,383 --> 00:57:57,199
- We are princes of the universe..

365
00:57:57,749 --> 00:58:02,613
- Here we belong...
Fighting to survive..

366
00:58:02,963 --> 00:58:12,422
- In a world with the darkest hour..

367
00:58:30,577 --> 00:58:35,617
- And here we are at the princess of the Universe...

368
00:58:36,676 --> 00:58:41,045
- Here we belong....
Fighting for survival...

369
00:58:41,564 --> 00:58:49,597
- We're here to be the ruler
of your world....

370
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:35,587
- It’s turning into a surprisingly good day...

371
00:59:44,194 --> 00:59:45,317
- Blue house..

372
00:59:49,674 --> 00:59:51,889
- Where are we going?
- Okay...

373
00:59:55,867 --> 00:59:58,598
- It looks as if we're meant
to keep going to...

374
01:00:05,593 --> 01:00:09,362
- We keep going east, right?
- Right...

375
01:00:16,686 --> 01:00:20,861
- Listen MacLeod,thanks for saving my neck
at the dock earlier, yeah?

376
01:00:21,689 --> 01:00:24,483
- You didn’t really give me much choice,
now did you, Reggie?

377
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:27,454
- Did all right...
- Find anything?

378
01:00:28,178 --> 01:00:31,910
- More bodies.
- Did you find any food? - No...

379
01:00:32,686 --> 01:00:36,916
- Christ al-fucking-mighty, I’m starving...
- Do not blaspheme...

380
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:42,299
- Or what? Is your good Lord gonna come 
down here and slap me, is he?

381
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,736
- Wake up, G!
Look around you...

382
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:55,057
- I’m afraid, my old friend... 
that He has not turned His back on us.

383
01:00:55,909 --> 01:00:57,863
- Rather, we have turned away from Him.

384
01:00:58,803 --> 01:01:02,206
- Still, a roast chicken would be nice...

385
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:10,340
- What do you think, MacLeod?
Have we come to this because of who we are?

386
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:15,969
- We live, we learn...
- Except we don't Learn, do we?

387
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:21,245
- We were given the ultimate responsibility...
free will...

388
01:01:22,105 --> 01:01:29,353
- And what have we done with it? We watch generation 
after generation making the same mistakes, Methos...

389
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:37,845
- The Source is His gift to us... Through it,
one us may be reborn into something more..

390
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,102
- More than Immortal?
- Perhaps...

391
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:45,384
- Spare us the sanctimonious bullshit, Giovanni...

392
01:01:45,796 --> 01:01:49,426
- You don't know what the Source is...
No one does, if it even exists...

393
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:52,607
- How can we know we're gonna
get to the source anyways?

394
01:01:53,985 --> 01:01:56,296
- Maybe the Guardian will kill us before we reach it...

395
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,368
- That's if we don't all kill each other first...

396
01:02:02,126 --> 01:02:06,728
- That could happen...
- No... it’s not about death...

397
01:02:07,138 --> 01:02:10,122
- It’s about life...
- Life...

398
01:02:15,713 --> 01:02:17,713
- Okay, who wants first watch?

399
01:02:44,523 --> 01:02:47,569
- Sergeant Reginald Weller reporting for duty, ma'am...

400
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:00,162
- You look cold... you want some?
It warms the blood...

401
01:03:09,066 --> 01:03:13,040
- Please...
- Thanks...

402
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:24,276
- So how old are you?
- I'll be 314 years old 3 weeks from next Tuesday...

403
01:03:25,775 --> 01:03:28,879
- I’m just a wee lad compared to 
old Giovanni and Methos...

404
01:03:33,657 --> 01:03:37,876
- You're a smart guy, Reggie...
How come you make believe you're not?

405
01:03:38,634 --> 01:03:41,898
- Now, what makes you say that, love?

406
01:03:47,511 --> 01:03:52,276
- When people think you’re a bit of a cabbage,
they tend to underestimate you...

407
01:03:53,168 --> 01:03:56,107
- That's good for keeping a head on 
one's shoulder’s when you're Immortal..

408
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,358
- If you know what I mean...

409
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,071
- Yeah...

410
01:04:04,205 --> 01:04:08,212
- Why are you here?
- For the truth...

411
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:29,991
- I saw you...

412
01:04:33,213 --> 01:04:36,537
- You're supposed to get some sleep...

413
01:04:53,277 --> 01:04:55,438
- I know what Joe meant to you...

414
01:04:58,025 --> 01:05:02,542
- I spent my entire life watching the people I love die..

415
01:05:04,402 --> 01:05:09,564
- The women I love die... Tessa, Kate, all of them...

416
01:05:12,528 --> 01:05:23,062
- I kept telling myself... I’m an Immortal... 
it was the price I paid....

417
01:05:26,367 --> 01:05:31,474
- But deep down Inside, 
I always believed that one day..

418
01:05:32,045 --> 01:05:38,034
- The light bulb would come on, and 
I would know why I spent the Last 400 years..

419
01:05:38,548 --> 01:05:40,691
- Cutting people’s' heads off to survive...

420
01:05:42,156 --> 01:05:44,571
- I would know why I am what I am...

421
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,621
- Look, I haven't lived like you...

422
01:05:51,841 --> 01:05:53,638
- I haven't seen what you've seen...

423
01:05:56,173 --> 01:06:01,186
- I don't...
But we've come this far for a reason...

424
01:06:03,118 --> 01:06:05,338
- I won't lose you...

425
01:06:07,687 --> 01:06:08,552
- You won't...

426
01:08:05,644 --> 01:08:10,078
- Hello... Reggie....

427
01:08:10,533 --> 01:08:13,976
- How did you do that?
- How did you do that? How did you do that?

428
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:17,024
- I'm supposed to feel you coming...

429
01:08:18,893 --> 01:08:27,313
- Fresh... flesh....
So delicate....

430
01:08:28,503 --> 01:08:31,839
- Young...blue eyes...
- Fuck you...

431
01:08:56,148 --> 01:08:56,983
- Reggie!

432
01:09:06,006 --> 01:09:06,672
- Reggie...

433
01:09:12,752 --> 01:09:14,778
- I fucking hate this bit...

434
01:09:15,744 --> 01:09:17,547
- See you soon....

435
01:09:23,523 --> 01:09:26,626
- Why didn’t he take his head?
- Why didn’t we know he was here?

436
01:09:29,148 --> 01:09:31,028
- Help me get him in the car...

437
01:09:39,853 --> 01:09:42,235
- He should be alive by now, right?

438
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,690
- Why isn't he coming back?

439
01:09:45,233 --> 01:09:52,335
- As you get closer to the Source...
you will grow weaker...


440
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:06,272
- Reggie..... Reggie....

441
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:12,362
- Oh, my God... He's dead...

442
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:18,112
- It’s happening....
- He didn’t heal because his faith wasn't pure...

443
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,979
- Let's see how well you heal, brother...
- Methos!

444
01:10:25,009 --> 01:10:27,352
- Giovanni!
- Stop it!

445
01:10:45,065 --> 01:10:48,262
- We should go...
- In a hurry, Methos?

446
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,829
- Where are we going?
- What for?

447
01:10:51,337 --> 01:10:57,327
 - That’s all bullshit anyway... There can be only one....
the Source.... it’s all been a lie...

448
01:10:59,142 --> 01:11:04,331
- Yeah, maybe it is... maybe it was just a story 
we made up to make ourselves feel better at night...

449
01:11:04,879 --> 01:11:07,207
- Maybe this is the way the dream ends...
- You don't believe that...

450
01:11:07,548 --> 01:11:10,012
- Yeah? Why not?
We're mortal now...

451
01:11:11,158 --> 01:11:13,382
- Everything has changed...

452
01:11:55,402 --> 01:11:56,234
- Now what?

453
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:04,664
- I don't like it...

454
01:12:11,746 --> 01:12:13,028
- He's alive...

455
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:15,723
- This is a trap...

456
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,920
- Be careful...

457
01:13:08,174 --> 01:13:12,936
- Get out! Get out! Go!
Everyone out! Anna!

458
01:13:13,629 --> 01:13:15,211
- Get out now! Go! Go!

459
01:13:39,842 --> 01:13:42,558
- We are they?
- They are above us.... They are using the tree..

460
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,932
- Don't let them go!
- Behind us!

461
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:23,746
- Say your prayers..

462
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:32,284
- The heroes! Take them! For meat!

463
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:12,881
- I'm thirsty...

464
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:45,863
- I hope the bastards choke on me...

465
01:16:03,241 --> 01:16:08,503
- This can't be the end... God wouldn’t let this
happen to a true Christian...

466
01:16:09,888 --> 01:16:13,795
- You know Giovanni... I saw Christ...

467
01:16:14,174 --> 01:16:15,895
- I saw Him teach... I saw Him heal...

468
01:16:16,474 --> 01:16:21,903
- You! you self-centred son of a bitch..
you are no Christian!

469
01:16:25,355 --> 01:16:30,870
- Anna...
- I never saw this...

470
01:16:32,145 --> 01:16:34,307
- It'll be okay?
- I don't know..

471
01:16:34,872 --> 01:16:36,643
- It's okay...

472
01:16:41,447 --> 01:16:43,410
- There he is, Duncan...

473
01:16:46,851 --> 01:16:48,273
- I saw him before...

474
01:17:09,244 --> 01:17:11,144
- Hello...

475
01:17:12,309 --> 01:17:13,290
- MacLeod...

476
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:19,551
- How do you like being mortal?
- It could be worse... I could be you...

477
01:17:28,257 --> 01:17:32,684
- Gallows you more... That's funny...
That's very funny...

478
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:40,218
I like you MacLeod.... MacLeod...

479
01:17:40,667 --> 01:17:48,011
- Enough of the bullshit... bullshit...
- I have very high hopes for you...

480
01:17:49,574 --> 01:17:52,528
- Either kill me or piss off....

481
01:17:55,265 --> 01:17:56,187
- No, no!

482
01:18:02,857 --> 01:18:04,299
- Leave her alone...

483
01:18:07,518 --> 01:18:08,695
- Anna!

484
01:18:11,712 --> 01:18:13,056
- Woman, come...

485
01:18:15,431 --> 01:18:17,200
- The Source calls you...

486
01:18:18,117 --> 01:18:20,773
- Follow me now, or I'll kill them all...

487
01:18:24,432 --> 01:18:25,687
- Anna, don't listen to him...

488
01:18:33,734 --> 01:18:35,213
- Come for me...

489
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:40,331
- Anna!

490
01:18:43,742 --> 01:18:44,546
- Anna no!

491
01:18:51,633 --> 01:18:54,151
- We never should have
turned to be mortals...

492
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:21,597
- He's burning the rope...

493
01:19:29,947 --> 01:19:32,530
- The fires burning me free...

494
01:19:34,988 --> 01:19:36,986
- Giovanni .. please..

495
01:19:39,312 --> 01:19:40,980
- He's releasing me...

496
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:50,939
- Giovanni.... Come on Giovanni...
- He has chosen me..

497
01:19:51,648 --> 01:19:55,091
- Giovanni... Cut the ropes!
Giovanni... Cut the ropes!

498
01:19:56,235 --> 01:19:58,471
- No... There can be only one...

499
01:19:59,553 --> 01:20:01,295
- Giovanni...!!

500
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:03,838
- Giovanni, you bastard!

501
01:20:48,549 --> 01:20:53,164
- I will leave you...
- I need someone to watch my back...

502
01:20:57,487 --> 01:21:01,729
- You trust me?
- You’ll do...

503
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:11,818
- The Source calls to me...

504
01:21:20,595 --> 01:21:22,498
- Time to hunt!

505
01:21:23,976 --> 01:21:25,360
- They have escaped!

506
01:21:26,035 --> 01:21:27,592
- Time to hunt!

507
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:15,077
- Hey...

508
01:22:17,922 --> 01:22:19,114
- It’s really happening...

509
01:22:25,751 --> 01:22:26,179
- Go!

510
01:23:21,308 --> 01:23:22,847
- Hello little priest!

511
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:37,988
- You gonna be shit, ha! ha! ha!

512
01:23:40,514 --> 01:23:43,898
- God save me!
- Forgive me father for I have sinned...

513
01:23:46,675 --> 01:23:49,383
- Leave him...
- I can't...

514
01:23:50,889 --> 01:23:52,278
- Kill him! Die!!!

515
01:23:56,423 --> 01:23:58,087
- Ready to die, priest?

516
01:24:11,953 --> 01:24:13,303
- Giovanni...

517
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:23,569
- Giovanni!

518
01:24:52,761 --> 01:24:54,437
- Methos.. No!!

519
01:25:04,028 --> 01:25:06,345
- Go.. find Anna...
- What?

520
01:25:08,174 --> 01:25:14,184
- It’s you, MacLeod... I wanted it to be me, 
but...You are the best of us...

521
01:25:16,327 --> 01:25:21,634
- You're both totally human and totally incorruptible,
and Joe knew that, and... I know it, too...

522
01:25:25,743 --> 01:25:27,024
- You're such an asshole...

523
01:25:28,428 --> 01:25:30,043
- I never said I was deep...

524
01:25:30,915 --> 01:25:32,626
- Go!
- Methos...

525
01:25:33,602 --> 01:25:36,830
- Come on, you greasy mongrels!
fresh meat!

526
01:25:49,421 --> 01:25:50,511
- The Source...

527
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:55,121
- I'm almost there...

528
01:26:13,612 --> 01:26:17,953
- I await your blessings....
- Rise... Giovanni...

529
01:26:27,631 --> 01:26:32,067
- The end?
- Yes...

530
01:26:34,734 --> 01:26:36,530
- I'm the One...

531
01:26:42,709 --> 01:26:43,791
- No...

532
01:27:03,377 --> 01:27:04,233
- Anna...

533
01:27:39,575 --> 01:27:40,849
- Anna...

534
01:27:45,596 --> 01:27:46,889
- Anna...

535
01:27:52,427 --> 01:27:55,428
- Duncan....
I knew you would come....

536
01:27:56,184 --> 01:27:57,555
- Come on...

537
01:28:00,756 --> 01:28:01,825
- Come on...

538
01:28:23,705 --> 01:28:27,731
- Get out of my way....
- Doesn't work that way, MacLeod...

539
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:33,850
- You can't just run away with the women...

540
01:28:37,857 --> 01:28:39,658
- So why don't you just tell me
how it works...

541
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:42,410
- In your world...
- One of us has to die...

542
01:28:43,422 --> 01:28:45,069
- I’ve heard that before....

543
01:28:58,899 --> 01:29:00,186
- Duncan...

544
01:29:02,147 --> 01:29:03,040
- Duncan...

545
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:08,051
- Duncan...

546
01:29:08,779 --> 01:29:09,547
- Anna...

547
01:29:20,345 --> 01:29:23,243
- Supprise!!!
- What is this?

548
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:30,503
- It's not time... Face the Guardian...
- Yeah face tthe Guardian...

549
01:29:36,706 --> 01:29:38,883
- Atta boy...

550
01:29:42,354 --> 01:29:48,324
- Feel that speed.... Feel that power....

551
01:29:51,054 --> 01:29:52,433
- It's the Source..

552
01:29:55,998 --> 01:29:58,185
- And it can be yours...

553
01:29:59,309 --> 01:30:00,807
- Forever!!!

554
01:30:12,811 --> 01:30:15,355
- The Source.... Intoxicating, isn't it?

555
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:02,555
- Pick up the pace or die, Highlanders!
- It’s happening...

556
01:31:11,348 --> 01:31:13,228
- The moment is close...

557
01:31:13,848 --> 01:31:16,557
- Yeah! The moment is close...

558
01:31:55,928 --> 01:31:59,827
- It's happening...
- Anna...

559
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:39,935
- Go ahead...
- Joe Dawson screamed like a child when he died..

560
01:32:41,745 --> 01:32:45,874
- Are you willing to pay the price?

561
01:32:47,082 --> 01:32:56,436
- And Reggie Weller. He cried like a little girl...
You will fight McLeod....

562
01:33:07,704 --> 01:33:13,459
- Yes, I killed your friends... Take whats yours...
Take your revenge....

563
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:17,740
- Be who you are!!!

564
01:33:18,186 --> 01:33:20,756
- I am Duncan MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod...

565
01:33:21,453 --> 01:33:23,496
- Who I am is who I was...

566
01:33:24,033 --> 01:33:27,925
- Do it, you Immortal fuck!

567
01:33:35,762 --> 01:33:37,694
- Make your choice Duncan...

568
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:42,287
- Take my head!!!!
- No...

569
01:33:43,481 --> 01:33:45,008
- I'm done with this...

570
01:33:49,072 --> 01:33:55,990
- Aaaah! I'm cursed..
Forever! Forever!

571
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:31,446
- I feel life....

572
01:34:37,024 --> 01:34:39,514
- I feel our child...

573
01:35:03,677 --> 01:35:06,577
- He.... Is the One...
