1
00:04:52,546 --> 00:04:53,420
Wait!

2
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:05,721
<i>Here, let me do that.</i>

3
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,914
<i>You sure you are up for this?</i>

4
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:13,711
<i>Can't Mrs. MacLeod be nervous?</i>

5
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:17,453
Anna...

6
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:13,757
- <i>Methos, try and listen to what I'm saying.</i>
- Reggie, calm down, tell me what's going on.

7
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:17,400
<i>Over the past week,</i>
the planets of our solar system

8
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:20,797
have moved outside their orbital paths
and are coming into alignment.

9
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:23,681
I mean, do you know how unusual that is?

10
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:26,559
There's no simple way to explain this.

11
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,117
<i>But that could just be orbital wobble.</i>

12
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,333
<i>Fucking hell, Methos!</i>

13
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,749
Orbital wobble is one thing, but this...

14
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:40,217
This is outside the laws
of celestial mechanics!

15
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:51,116
And that's not all.

16
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:53,934
Literally millions of celestial bodies

16
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:56,934
<i>from here to the central sun
of our galaxy are lining up.</i>

17
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,756
When that alignment is complete...

18
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:04,290
in exactly 4 days, 3 hours, 47 minutes,

19
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:07,429
<i>the Earth is going to be bombarded
with cosmic radiation.</i>

20
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:09,677
The moment of the Source?

21
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,544
The Light of the cosmos
is literally reaching out to us.

22
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:19,092
Aye.

23
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:21,837
What about Zai? Did we hear from him?

24
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:24,545
No. Nah, he's overdue.

25
00:07:25,543 --> 00:07:27,343
Isn't your friend MacLeod there?
Can't he help?

26
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:31,036
MacLeod is...

27
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,658
not the man he once was.

28
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:35,646
<i>Well, just try.</i>

29
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,319
<i>- I can't stay with you Duncan.
- Why?</i>

30
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:49,887
<i>Duncan.</i>

31
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,280
Hey. Hey you.

32
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,255
Please, something to eat.

33
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:12,581
You're kind, lady. Thank you. Thank you.

34
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:54,741
- Hey! Stop!
- No! No, no, no! No!

35
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,627
Food. Food.

36
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:21,768
Thank you.

37
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:40,798
- Hi.
- Hi.

38
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:44,214
- Is it good?
- Uh-huh.

39
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:16,882
Oh, God, I hate that.

40
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,154
Yes.

41
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:54,436
- There can be only one.
- <i>Voice match accepted.</i>

42
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:56,237
<i>Login confirmed.</i>

43

00:13:58,424 --> 00:13:59,765
<i>Signal acquired.</i>

45
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,222
- <i>Are you sure it's only a few days
until the alignment is complete?</i> - Guys!

46
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:07,386
- Come on, come on!
- <i>Yes.</i>

46
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,286
- <i>Four days at most.</i>
- Damn it!

47
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:24,392
They are going crazy out there.

48
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:31,238
<i>Source better be some big medicine,</i>
or else we're all going down the toilet.

49
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:57,268
<i>- Reg!
- Z! Where the hell have you been, man?</i>

50
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:02,252
<i>Reg, there's no time. It's coming down.
I think I found it!</i>

51
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:05,357
- <i>Where is Giovanni?</i>
- What have you found Zai?

52
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:07,930
I found ancient writings in Gaza.

52
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:10,630
I followed them,
they took me to central Europe.

53
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,385
And I found the location of the Source.

54
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:23,849
Z! I'm losing you mate.
Try and stabilize your signal.

55
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:27,143
- Zai, easy, okay? From the beginning.
- <i>I can't hear you. I can't hear you.</i>

56
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:33,067
Zai, you do God's work.

57
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:37,039
- Don't be afraid.
- <i>Your Eminence.</i>

58
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:38,455
Tell us what you found.

59
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:43,161
The ancient writings I found in Gaza,
I followed them.

60
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:48,428
They took me to central Europe.
Then I knew I was getting close.

61
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,146
I found a monastery where
the monks studied an ancient text

62
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:55,757
that spoke of the Source.

63
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,027
One of the monks took me to a place where
it last happened over 10,000 years ago.

64
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:04,876
I could feel the power of this place.

65
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:08,212
And then, he appeared.

66
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:16,023
So I ran. And I ran.

67
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,649
He has risen.

68
00:16:22,408 --> 00:16:24,207
The Guardian.

69
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:30,315
<i>Signal failure.</i>

70
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:40,325
<i>Reacquiring signal.
Signal reacquired.</i>

71
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:44,891
<i>- I always thought the Guardian was bullshit.
- He's the immortal antichrist.</i>

72
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:47,880
The false prophet created in evil.

73
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,535
Well if he's such a bad boy,
then why didn't he take Zai's head?

74
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:54,026
To get to us. He knows Zai's not alone.

75
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,897
<i>Do you think he knows
we are looking for the Source?</i>

76
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:59,258
<i>- He must.
- Signal acquired.</i>

77
00:17:00,443 --> 00:17:05,285
- He's more than Immortal.
- Zai, where is the location of the Source?

78
00:17:06,004 --> 00:17:09,478
- He's like... like death.
- <i>Zai, are you in danger?</i>

79
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,447
- Zai! <i>The location.</i>
- He's coming.

80
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:22,320
- <i>Zai!</i> Get out of there!
- <i>What have you learnt? Give us something.</i>

81
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,065
I've written the co-ordinates down
on this map. The co-ordinates are...

82
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:29,285
The co-ordinates are on...

83
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay. <i>You have to get to the monastery.</i>

83
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:36,255
You have to find
<i>the monks that bear the symbol</i>

84
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,576
<i>of the Brothers of Doleo.</i>

85
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:42,557
<i>They will help you find</i> the Source.

86
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:48,414
<i>- Zai, save yourself. Get out of there! Zai!
- Zai, we have enough. Save yourself!</i>

87
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:51,418
<i>Pray for me, Father.</i>

88
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:54,577
<i>Reg.</i>

89
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:57,954
<i>Can you get the signal back?
Did you get the signal back?</i>

90
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:01,535
- <i>Zai!<i>
- Zai!

91
00:18:12,094 --> 00:18:15,620
<i>What are the Delio Brothers?</i>

92
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,671
Brotherhood of pain.

93
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:19,665
Sounds like a fun bunch.

94
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:23,024
They're an ancient religious order
in estern Europe.

95
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,571
They are not a religious order!

96
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:28,548
They are an heretical cult.

97
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,113
But their Elder might be able to help us.

98
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:34,050
The Elder corrupted his monks.

98
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,424
<i>Turned them from the true faith
during the fall of Rome.</i>

99
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:40,782
Rome's a long time ago my friend.

100
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:43,628
Not for me, it wasn't.

101
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:46,443
- Giovanni, this could be it!
- Guys!

102
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:50,126
If this Elder could help us, who gives a toss?

103
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:53,074
Let's go and find him.

104
00:19:00,676 --> 00:19:02,177
 Zai's no Jack-the-Lad.

105
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:05,152
He can handle himself.
I mean, he's got a shot, right?

106
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:32,974
- Joe.
- Methos! What do you got?

107
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:38,298
The Guardian is awake. <i>Find MacLeod.</i>

108
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,141
There can be only me.

109
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:48,011
Hello.

110
00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:54,225
This is the end of time!

111
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,911
You think I'm mad?
Maybe a little bit crazy.

112
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:04,255
What are you?

113
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:06,361
I'm the Guardian.

114
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:10,188
Question is who are you?

115
00:24:11,353 --> 00:24:14,036
- I'm Duncan MacLeod.
- I'm Duncan MacLeod.

116
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,821
I'm Duncan MacLeod.

117
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,746
You have squandered your precious gift!

118
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:27,319
You could have ruled the world...
and you pissed it away.

119
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:31,518
- Have a nice day.
- The female, Anna.

120
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:36,904
- She's not for you.
- What's Anna got to do with this?

121
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,383
Nothing. Everything.

122
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:49,057
- It's time for me and you to dance.
- In that outfit?

123
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:53,357
Foreplay.

124
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:02,810
Let's go.

125
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:29,825
Come on, over here!

126
00:25:38,222 --> 00:25:43,265
Are you the One, MacLeod, MacLeod?
Would you kill to be the One?

127
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:47,014
Would you kill her, MacLeod?

128
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:57,576
Hello, Joe!

129
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:06,723
- Joe.
- Get in the car.

130
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:10,022
- Get out of here, Joe.
- I don't have time for this bullshit!

131
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,611
- Get in the car!
- What are you doing?

132
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:45,296
<i>Seek the Source.</i>

133
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:28,829
<i>Seek the Source.</i>

134
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:30,875
What?

135
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,266
<i>The Source.</i>

136
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:09,853
- Joe!
- Before you get all whacked out, just listen to me.

137
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,669
Joe, stop the car!

138
00:28:12,133 --> 00:28:13,429
Stop the damn car!

139
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:19,041
- You're a Watcher, you can't interfere.
- I just said fuck it..

140
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:24,617
- You took an oath.
- There is no Watcher organization anymore.

141
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:27,074
Most of my people are dead.

142
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:30,658
You shouldn't have interfered.

143
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:33,719
If I hadn't, you'd be dead.

144
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:38,000
Sure, fine. Go ahead.
Go back and let that thing kill you.

144
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,377
What do you have to live for anyway?

145
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:45,667
- He mentioned Anna.
- Have you even talked to her?

146
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,334
No, not in months. And don't give me
any of that end-of-days bullshit.

147
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,887
Methos and others don't think it's bullshit.
They're looking for the Source.

148
00:28:55,218 --> 00:28:58,449
- Oh, the Source.
- You can join them and find out what its about.

149
00:28:59,063 --> 00:29:00,845
And see what it has to do with Anna.

150
00:29:01,374 --> 00:29:04,701
Or you can go back and play with that freak.
It's your call.

151
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,766
I can't believe I'm letting you drag me into this.

152
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:27,083
<i>I know this is going to be hard to explain,
but... I'm immortal.</i>

153
00:29:31,324 --> 00:29:32,954
<i>It's just a dream.</i>

154
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:39,087
<i>I was born in the Highlands
of Scotland in 1592.</i>

155
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:45,236
<i>It's more than a dream, Duncan.</i>

156
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,701
<i>Anna.</i>

157
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:50,820
<i>Nothing will hurt you.</i>

158
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:57,623
- So you're not going to grow old?
- This is how I am.

159
00:30:01,995 --> 00:30:03,995
<i>I'm going to grow old, though.</i>

160
00:30:05,642 --> 00:30:07,175
<i>Will you still love me when I'm old?</i>

161
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,236
<i>I'll always love you.</i>

162
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:17,911
<i>I'm leaving. I can't stay with you, Duncan.</i>

163
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:25,048
<i>- Why?
- You mean everything to me.</i>

164
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,129
<i>But it's not enough.</i>

165
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,752
<i>What do you mean I mean everything
to you and I'm not enough?</i>

166
00:30:31,078 --> 00:30:33,028
<i>- Make sense, Anna.
- I can't!</i>

167
00:30:40,925 --> 00:30:42,640
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

168
00:30:47,105 --> 00:30:49,342
<i>The impossible.</i>

169
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:51,949
<i>I want a child.</i>

170
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,627
<i>A child...</i>

171
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:51,479
It's good to see you, G.

172
00:31:56,954 --> 00:31:58,816
- Who are you?
- I'm Duncan MacLeod.

173
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:03,814
MacLeod, MacLeod.
 May I ask you what you're doing here?

174
00:32:06,073 --> 00:32:09,646
- Reggie Weller.
- My astronomer.

175
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:12,098
And part time cultural stereotype.

176
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:16,577
- Sure, you are.
- Funny! Who's that?

177
00:32:17,307 --> 00:32:19,399
It's Joe Dawson, a friend of mine.

177
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:21,199
Hey!

178
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:31,909
Methos! Been a long time.

179
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:34,502
This is different.

180
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:41,367
-Times are different, MacLeod.
- Yeah.

181
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:44,271
Leather's a really good look for you, Methos.

182
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:49,632
Giovanni.

183
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:58,278
- I hear you're on a quest for the Source.
- You make it sound so grand.

184
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:01,450
We are here to get information.

185
00:33:02,417 --> 00:33:04,454
Brave men died to get us this far.

186
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:08,000
Brothers of Doleo.

186
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,863
Rumour has it they've been governed
by the same Elder for thousands of years.

187
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,587
- One of us?
- I'm thinking so.

188
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,382
Well let's find out.

189
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:26,075
What's a man of the cloth doing
on the quest for the Source?

190
00:33:26,865 --> 00:33:31,735
- I am here for the greater glory of God.
- What if you don't like what you find?

191
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:40,072
You assume there will be an inherent contradiction 
between what we will encounter and the Gospel.

192
00:33:40,326 --> 00:33:43,014
- I know that will not be the case.
- You seem very certain of that.

193
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:48,325
Doesn't it? The Lord guides
our hands on this holy quest.

194
00:33:49,588 --> 00:33:51,623
We are all in His service.

195
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:56,280
Question is, Duncan MacLeod, are you?

196
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,055
I had a sneaky suspicion
you'd know where to find him.

196
00:34:00,095 --> 00:34:01,285
Yeah, well...

197
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:05,453
- You know I did it for him and not for you.
- Sure.

198
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,973
- What do you want?
- We have come to see your Elder.

199
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:18,591
We have no Elder.

200
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,139
That went well.

201
00:34:34,163 --> 00:34:37,706
Oy! You! Open this door!

202
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:42,147
Right!

204
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:01,249
Wait a minute!

205
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:06,955
Who's that?

206
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:09,494
That's my wife!

207
00:35:15,529 --> 00:35:16,383
Hello.

208
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:20,277
I can explain.

209
00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:30,311
Stop!

210
00:35:37,194 --> 00:35:41,225
The Elder will see you...
now that she is here.

211
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,637
Hello Anna Teshemka.

212
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,734
Hello Duncan MacLeod.

213
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:15,759
You look like shit.

214
00:36:20,774 --> 00:36:24,528
- What are you doing here?
- Look, I have so much to tell you.

215
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:27,094
- You won't even believe what's been
happening to me. - Lead us.

216
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:30,600
- Duncan, I have visions.
- Uh-huh.

217
00:36:31,432 --> 00:36:37,789
- Seriously! I saw this, I saw you, I saw all of you.
- <i>Come, girl. I'm near.</i>

218
00:37:32,898 --> 00:37:36,414
Look... well.

219
00:37:41,744 --> 00:37:45,474
There are worse things than death.

220
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:49,135
Apparently.

221
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:55,783
- What do you want?
- We seek the Source.

222
00:38:06,356 --> 00:38:10,727
Are you willing to pay the price?

223
00:38:20,597 --> 00:38:22,561
- That's fixed.
- Thank you.

224
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:27,694
- Hoo! Hello!
- Yeah. It's a sweet piece, but...

225
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:31,097
- This is my beat, okay, Reggie?
- Sorry.

226
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:37,400
What is it?

227
00:38:40,561 --> 00:38:41,872
I don't know.

228
00:38:49,316 --> 00:38:55,804
So you have encountered the Guardian.
A riddle that cannot be solved.

229
00:38:58,992 --> 00:39:03,755
A force that cannot be defeated.

230
00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:07,846
Man, that's one fast bird!

231
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:12,241
You stay here.

232
00:39:13,957 --> 00:39:15,468
I can take care of this.

233
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:28,647
I was once like you,
long ago, before recorded time.

234
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:35,952
Like now, the world had fallen into chaos.

235
00:39:36,732 --> 00:39:41,844
The people cried out for a redeemer.

236
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:47,968
Do any of you have redeeming quality?

237
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,944
- Greetings, brother.
- This is holy ground!

238
00:40:14,652 --> 00:40:18,796
We were a group much like yours.

239
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:27,401
All of us Immortals from different tribes.
All seeking the truth.

240
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:33,188
We all thought we would find
the answer in the Source.

241
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:39,919
But there were darker,
secret desires in our hearts.

242
00:40:43,392 --> 00:40:45,842
The journey was long.

243
00:40:47,577 --> 00:40:52,663
Our tempers flared, and being Immortals,
heads were taken.

244
00:40:56,592 --> 00:41:02,958
Finally, there were only three of us left,
the strongest of our kind.

245
00:41:07,283 --> 00:41:13,879
But the ancient one guarding the Source
was stronger still.

246
00:41:28,564 --> 00:41:35,722
My friend fought valiantly,
but I wanted my immortality.

247
00:41:43,107 --> 00:41:48,676
The source wasn't mine to take.
Something went terribly wrong.

248
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:53,190
It left us both cursed.

249
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:58,598
Both, for ever decaying.

250
00:41:59,903 --> 00:42:02,572
Me like this...

251
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:09,763
and he doomed to take his place
as the Guardian.

252
00:42:13,132 --> 00:42:16,341
You like graveyards? I love them.

253
00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:19,560
I mean, who wants to live forever?

254
00:42:20,315 --> 00:42:25,342
# Who wants to live forever? #

255
00:42:26,273 --> 00:42:30,867
Can you tell us the way to the Source?

256
00:42:32,497 --> 00:42:41,567
You should ask her.
She's already seen the way.

257
00:42:43,763 --> 00:42:45,151
Come.

258
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:50,612
Anna.

259
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:55,264
It's all right.

260
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:14,132
A child!

261
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,972
It calls to you, does it not?

262
00:43:21,324 --> 00:43:26,058
- This is blasphemy!
- It is truth!

263
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:30,125
- Don't touch her!
- It's okay!

264
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:47,652
Follow the signs. As for you lot...

265
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:50,652
Follow the woman.

266
00:43:50,942 --> 00:43:52,433
- The woman.
- Anna.

267
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:59,108
- What did you see?
- Stars, worlds.

268
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:08,154
A warning. As you get closer to the Source,
you will grow weaker.

269
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:17,031
- What's in it for you?
- Release!

270
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,304
Release!

271
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:37,444
There can be only one.

272
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:41,998
Maybe, but they weren't talking about you.

273
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,250
Joe!

274
00:44:46,581 --> 00:44:48,415
Hey, come on! Have a shot!

275
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,656
To the right!

276
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,101
Come on!

277
00:45:00,023 --> 00:45:00,749
Ouch!

278
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:11,146
MacLeod!

279
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,219
No!

280
00:45:25,345 --> 00:45:26,631
Joe!

281
00:45:30,798 --> 00:45:31,524
Joe!

282
00:45:33,746 --> 00:45:37,420
Thank you, you've been a wonderful
audience. Good night!

283
00:45:39,963 --> 00:45:42,093
Joe! Get me a bandage!

284
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,836
Just get anything!

285
00:45:44,382 --> 00:45:45,134
Joe!

286
00:45:48,335 --> 00:45:50,076
Methos, you're a doctor. Do something.

287
00:45:51,963 --> 00:45:53,502
Oh, Joseph.

288
00:45:56,706 --> 00:46:01,517
- You shouldn't have interfered.
- Most fun I've had in years.

289
00:46:03,998 --> 00:46:09,741
MacLeod, knowing you, watching you...

290
00:46:11,513 --> 00:46:16,773
was an honour. It's been my greatest...

291
00:46:19,092 --> 00:46:27,008
MacLeod, you... are... my... best friend.

292
00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:29,464
You're my best friend, Joe.

293
00:46:30,748 --> 00:46:33,167
You are the father that never kick me out.

294
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:47,189
- If there can be only one.
- It was never good for me.

295
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,794
You can't cheat me now, Mac.

296
00:46:54,135 --> 00:46:58,557
- It's... your destiny.
- Joe.

297
00:46:59,939 --> 00:47:04,785
- Joe.
- Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us.

298
00:47:06,966 --> 00:47:07,672
Joe.

300
00:48:09,422 --> 00:48:10,176
Amen.

301
00:48:27,189 --> 00:48:28,086
I'm done.

302
00:48:32,603 --> 00:48:34,328
Didn't go quite as planned, huh?

303
00:48:34,891 --> 00:48:37,382
Don't be glimp. Not now!

304
00:48:38,384 --> 00:48:39,843
Why are you upset, MacLeod?

305
00:48:41,325 --> 00:48:45,067
Is it because Joe died, or because you, 
the great Highlander, couldn't save him?

306
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:49,189
- Go to hell!
- Is this the new MacLeod?

307
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:55,345
Someone who's going to betray the memory
of his friend? Betray his history and his Clan?

308
00:48:56,107 --> 00:48:57,055
Quitter!

309
00:48:59,004 --> 00:49:00,568
- Move it, MacLeod.
- Oh, no.

310
00:49:01,052 --> 00:49:03,909
- This is holy ground!
- I don't care!

311
00:49:04,286 --> 00:49:05,940
- No!
- Get up!

312
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:09,579
This is what we do.

313
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,787
- Do you know why he interfered?
- Why?

314
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:15,245
It wasn't for me. It was for you!

315
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:18,600
So that you might be the One.

315
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,061
And now  you're going to piss
on his grave? Well, come on!

316
00:49:22,634 --> 00:49:26,468
You can hide behind that bullshit, Methos.
But if you're looking for someone to blame,

317
00:49:26,805 --> 00:49:28,039
blame yourself!

318
00:49:30,753 --> 00:49:33,125
- We're leaving.
- No, I'm not.

319
00:49:34,713 --> 00:49:36,536
- I have to go with them.
- What?

320
00:49:37,902 --> 00:49:40,834
- It's not your choice, Duncan, it's mine.
- Anna.

321
00:49:41,701 --> 00:49:44,293
- I need to find the Source.
- What do you want?

322
00:49:44,924 --> 00:49:47,375
You want me to bury you next to Joe?

323
00:49:48,077 --> 00:49:49,392
Then stay with me.

324
00:49:50,645 --> 00:49:52,243
You said nothing would hurt me.

325
00:49:58,272 --> 00:50:02,529
I was chosen for this. And so were you.

326
00:50:02,844 --> 00:50:06,378
- Anna, this doesn't make sense.
- Yes, it does.

327
00:50:09,753 --> 00:50:10,560
Look.

328
00:50:16,173 --> 00:50:18,206
It calls to us.

329
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:22,468
I saw it before.

330
00:50:23,234 --> 00:50:26,061
But it was over me like a cathedral.

331
00:50:27,898 --> 00:50:28,779
Reggie?

332
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:32,379
- Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
- Where?

333
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:39,423
Water. We need to go by water.

334
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,974
The alignment is centred over an island!

335
00:50:45,156 --> 00:50:46,775
Like the lady said.

336
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,001
We need a boat.

337
00:52:06,607 --> 00:52:09,292
I thought you would have found
someone else to have those kids with.

338
00:52:13,768 --> 00:52:16,567
I don't want just someone's kids.

339
00:52:21,294 --> 00:52:24,763
Duncan, I made a choice.

340
00:52:28,057 --> 00:52:31,647
It went against everything I felt for you.

341
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:37,045
You think it's a coincidence?
We ran into each other?

342
00:52:37,897 --> 00:52:40,952
Something, some power, is guiding us.

343
00:52:43,508 --> 00:52:45,570
Can that power bring Joe back?

344
00:52:59,386 --> 00:53:00,797
We need to dock.

345
00:53:01,564 --> 00:53:03,933
- Impossible.
- Why?

346
00:53:05,094 --> 00:53:11,423
Look. Over there. There are maniacs
on that island. Cannibals.

347
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,170
They must have seized the port.

348
00:53:15,244 --> 00:53:18,612
That was Carl Louis, the port captain.

349
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:21,180
I have no wish to join him.

350
00:53:22,984 --> 00:53:25,209
I have no choice. The lady has a date.

351
00:53:27,534 --> 00:53:31,762
- There is nothing there but death.
- There's death everywhere.

352
00:54:32,741 --> 00:54:34,007
May God take his soul.

353
00:54:47,026 --> 00:54:48,268
Light!

354
00:54:51,112 --> 00:54:52,717
We're not going to let them do that, are we?

355
00:54:54,453 --> 00:54:55,486
No, we're not.

356
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:02,632
Reggie! Reggie!

357
00:55:08,064 --> 00:55:10,153
- Reggie, stop!
- Now?

358
00:55:18,175 --> 00:55:19,851
- I fucking love this!
- Duck!

359
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:31,845
- What are you doing?
- God is mercifull, even in death.

360
00:56:40,116 --> 00:56:41,191
Duncan!

361
00:56:46,162 --> 00:56:47,545
Duncan!

362
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,365
Everyone get down!

363
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:50,883
♪ So here we are
Born to be kings ♪

364
00:57:51,183 --> 00:57:56,999

00:58:36,476 --> 00:58:40,845

369
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:49,397

370
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:35,387
It's turning into a surprisingly good day.

371
00:59:43,994 --> 00:59:45,117
Blue house.

372
00:59:49,474 --> 00:59:51,689
- Where are we going?
- Okay.

373
00:59:55,667 --> 00:59:58,398
It looks as if we're meant to keep going to...

374
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:09,162
- We keep going east, right?
- Right.

375
01:00:16,486 --> 01:00:20,661
Listen, MacLeod. Thanks for saving
my neck at the dock earlier, yeah?

376
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:24,283
You didn't really give me much choice,
now did you, Reggie?

377
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:27,254
- Did all right.
- Find anything?

378
01:00:27,978 --> 01:00:29,010
More bodies.

378
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,710
- Did you find any food?
- No.

379
01:00:32,486 --> 01:00:36,716
- Christ all-fucking-mighty, I'm starving!
- Do not blaspheme!

380
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:42,099
Or what? Is your good Lord going to
come  down here and slap me, is he?

381
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:47,536
Wake up, G! Look around you.

382
01:00:49,325 --> 01:00:54,857
I'm afraid, my old friend,
that He has not turned His back on us.

383
01:00:55,709 --> 01:00:57,663
Rather, we have turned away from Him.

384
01:00:58,603 --> 01:01:02,006
Still, a roast chicken would be nice.

385
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:10,140
What do you think, MacLeod?
Have we come to this because of who we are?

386
01:01:10,969 --> 01:01:15,769
- We live, we learn.
- Except we don't learn, do we?

387
01:01:16,592 --> 01:01:21,045
We were given the ultimate
responsibility, free will.

388
01:01:21,705 --> 01:01:23,000
And what have we done with it?

388
01:01:23,505 --> 01:01:29,153
We watch generation after generation
making the same mistakes, Methos.

389
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:33,000
The Source is His gift to us.

389
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,645
Through it, one of us may be reborn
into something more.

390
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:40,902
- More than Immortal?
- Perhaps.

391
01:01:41,501 --> 01:01:45,184
Spare us the sanctimonious bullshit, Giovanni!

392
01:01:45,596 --> 01:01:49,226
You don't know what the Source is.
No one does. If it even exists!

393
01:01:49,885 --> 01:01:52,407
How can we know we're going
to get to the source anyway?

394
01:01:53,785 --> 01:01:56,096
Maybe the Guardian will kill us
before we reach it.

395
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,168
That's if we don't all kill each other first.

396
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:06,528
- That could happen.
- No, it's not about death.

397
01:02:06,938 --> 01:02:09,922
- It's about life.
- Life.

398
01:02:15,513 --> 01:02:17,513
Okay, who wants first watch?

399
01:02:44,323 --> 01:02:47,369
Sergeant Reginald Weller
reporting for duty, ma'am.

400
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:59,962
You look cold. You want some?
It warms the blood.

401
01:03:08,866 --> 01:03:12,840
- Please.
- Thanks.

402
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:24,076
- So how old are you?
- I'll be 314 years old 3 weeks from next Tuesday.

403
01:03:25,575 --> 01:03:28,679
I'm just a wee lad compared
to  old Giovanni and Methos.

404
01:03:33,457 --> 01:03:37,676
You're a smart guy, Reggie.
How come you make believe you're not?

405
01:03:38,434 --> 01:03:41,698
Now, what makes you say that, love?

406
01:03:47,311 --> 01:03:52,076
When people think you're a bit of a cabbage,
they tend to underestimate you.

407
01:03:52,968 --> 01:03:55,907
That's good for keeping a head on
one's shoulder's when you're immortal.

408
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,158
If you know what I mean.

409
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:00,871
Yeah.

410
01:04:04,005 --> 01:04:08,012
- Why are you here?
- For the truth.

411
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:29,791
I saw you.

412
01:04:33,013 --> 01:04:36,337
You're supposed to get some sleep.

413
01:04:53,077 --> 01:04:55,238
I know what Joe meant to you.

414
01:04:57,825 --> 01:05:02,342
I spent my entire life
watching the people I love die.

415
01:05:04,202 --> 01:05:09,364
The women I love die,
Tessa, Kate, all of them.

416
01:05:12,328 --> 01:05:17,700
I kept telling myself... I'm an Immortal.

416
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,862
It was the price I paid.

417
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:31,274
But deep down inside,
I always believed that one day

418
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:37,834
the light bulb would come on, and 
I would know why I spent the last 400 years

419
01:05:38,348 --> 01:05:40,491
cutting people's heads off to survive.

420
01:05:41,956 --> 01:05:44,371
I would know why I am what I am.

421
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:50,421
Look, I haven't lived like you.

422
01:05:51,641 --> 01:05:53,438
I haven't seen what you've seen.

423
01:05:55,973 --> 01:06:00,986
I don't. But we've come this far for a reason.

424
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:05,138
I won't lose you.

425
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,352
You won't.

426
01:08:05,444 --> 01:08:09,878
Hello... Reggie.

427
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:13,776
- How did you do that?
- How did you do that?

428
01:08:14,565 --> 01:08:16,824
I'm supposed to feel you coming.

429
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:27,113
Fresh... flesh. So delicate.

430
01:08:28,303 --> 01:08:31,639
- Young... blue eyes.
- Fuck you!

431
01:08:55,948 --> 01:08:56,783
Reggie!

432
01:09:05,806 --> 01:09:06,472
Reggie!

433
01:09:12,552 --> 01:09:14,578
I fucking hate this bit.

434
01:09:15,544 --> 01:09:17,347
See you soon.

435
01:09:23,323 --> 01:09:26,426
- Why didn't he take his head?
- Why didn't we know he was here?

436
01:09:28,948 --> 01:09:30,828
Help me get him in the car.

437
01:09:39,553 --> 01:09:42,035
He should be alive by now, right?

438
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,490
Why isn't he coming back?

439
01:09:45,033 --> 01:09:52,135
<i>As you get closer to the Source,
you will grow weaker.</i>

440
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:02,172
Reggie.

440
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,072
Reggie.

441
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:12,162
Oh, my God. He's dead.

442
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:17,912
- It's happening.
- He didn't heal because his faith wasn't pure.

443
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,979
- Let's see how well you heal, brother.
- Methos!

444
01:10:24,809 --> 01:10:27,152
- Giovanni!
- Stop it!

445
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:48,062
- We should go.
- In a hurry, Methos?

446
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:49,629
Where are we going? What for?

447
01:10:51,137 --> 01:10:57,127
 It's all bullshit anyway. There can be
only one, the Source. It's all been a lie.

448
01:10:58,742 --> 01:11:00,000
Yeah, maybe it is.

448
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,131
Maybe it was just a story we made up
to make ourselves feel better at night.

449
01:11:04,379 --> 01:11:07,007
- Maybe this is the way the dream ends.
- You don't believe that.

450
01:11:07,148 --> 01:11:09,812
Yeah? Why not? We're mortal now.

451
01:11:10,958 --> 01:11:13,182
Everything has changed.

452
01:11:55,202 --> 01:11:56,034
Now what?

453
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:04,464
I don't like it.

454
01:12:11,546 --> 01:12:12,828
He's alive!

455
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:15,523
This is a trap.

456
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,720
Be careful.

457
01:13:07,974 --> 01:13:12,736
- Get out! Get out! Let's go! Get out! Anna!
- I told you it was a trap!

458
01:13:13,429 --> 01:13:15,011
Get out now! Go! Go!

459
01:13:39,642 --> 01:13:42,358
- Where are they?
- They are above us. They are using the trees.

460
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,732
Behind us!

461
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:23,546
Say your prayers.

462
01:14:27,239 --> 01:14:32,084
They're heroes! Take them! For meat!

463
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,681
I'm thirsty!

464
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:45,663
I hope the bastards choke on me!

465
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:08,303
This can't be the end. God wouldn't
let this happen to a true Christian.

466
01:16:09,388 --> 01:16:13,595
You know Giovanni... I saw Christ.

467
01:16:13,974 --> 01:16:15,695
I saw Him teach, I saw Him heal.

468
01:16:16,274 --> 01:16:21,703
You, you self-centred son of a bitch.
You are no Christian!

469
01:16:25,155 --> 01:16:30,670
- Anna.
- I never saw this.

470
01:16:31,945 --> 01:16:34,107
- It'll be okay.
- I don't know.

471
01:16:34,672 --> 01:16:36,443
It's okay.

472
01:16:41,247 --> 01:16:43,210
There he is, Duncan.

473
01:16:46,651 --> 01:16:48,073
I saw him before.

474
01:17:09,044 --> 01:17:10,944
Hello...

475
01:17:12,109 --> 01:17:13,090
MacLeod.

476
01:17:14,675 --> 01:17:19,351
- How do you like being mortal?
- It could be worse. I could be you.

477
01:17:28,057 --> 01:17:32,484
Gallows you more.
That's funny. That's very funny.

478
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:40,018
I like you MacLeod, MacLeod.

479
01:17:40,467 --> 01:17:47,811
- Enough of the bullshit, bullshit.
- I had very high hopes for you.

480
01:17:49,374 --> 01:17:52,328
Either kill me or piss off.

482
01:18:02,657 --> 01:18:04,099
Leave her alone.

483
01:18:07,318 --> 01:18:08,495
Anna!

484
01:18:11,512 --> 01:18:12,856
Woman, come.

485
01:18:15,231 --> 01:18:17,000
The Source calls you.

486
01:18:17,917 --> 01:18:20,573
Follow me now, or I'll kill them all.

487
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,487
Anna, don't listen to him.

488
01:18:33,534 --> 01:18:35,013
Come for me.

489
01:18:39,216 --> 01:18:40,131
Anna!

490
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:44,346
Anna, no!

491
01:18:51,433 --> 01:18:53,951
We never should have trusted the mortal.

491
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,000
Shut up, Giovanni! Stop moaning!

492
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:21,397
He's burning the rope.

493
01:19:29,747 --> 01:19:32,330
The fire's burning me free.

494
01:19:34,788 --> 01:19:36,786
Giovanni.

495
01:19:39,112 --> 01:19:40,780
He's releasing me.

496
01:19:46,501 --> 01:19:50,739
- Giovanni. Come on, Giovanni. Giovanni.
- He has chosen me.

497
01:19:51,448 --> 01:19:54,891
Giovanni, cut the ropes.
Giovanni, cut the ropes!

498
01:19:56,035 --> 01:19:58,271
No. There can be only one.

499
01:19:59,353 --> 01:20:01,095
Giovanni!

500
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:03,638
Giovanni, you bastard!

501
01:20:48,349 --> 01:20:52,964
- I'd leave you.
- I need someone to watch my back.

502
01:20:57,287 --> 01:21:01,529
- You trust me?
- You'll do.

503
01:21:09,795 --> 01:21:11,618
The Source calls to me.

504
01:21:20,395 --> 01:21:22,298
Time to hunt!

505
01:21:23,776 --> 01:21:25,160
They have escaped!

506
01:21:25,835 --> 01:21:27,392
Time to hunt!

507
01:22:13,133 --> 01:22:14,877
Hey.

508
01:22:17,722 --> 01:22:18,914
It's really happening.

509
01:22:25,551 --> 01:22:25,979
Go!

512
01:23:40,314 --> 01:23:43,698
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned!
- God save me!

513
01:23:46,475 --> 01:23:49,183
- Leave him.
- I can't.

514
01:23:50,689 --> 01:23:52,078
- Kill him!

515
01:23:56,223 --> 01:23:57,887
Ready to die, priest?

516
01:24:11,753 --> 01:24:13,103
Giovanni...

517
01:24:21,383 --> 01:24:23,000
Giovanni!

517
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,000
Giovanni!

518
01:24:52,561 --> 01:24:54,237
Methos, no!

519
01:25:03,828 --> 01:25:06,145
- Go, find Anna.
- What?

520
01:25:07,974 --> 01:25:13,984
It's you, MacLeod. I wanted it to be me,
but... you are the best of us.

521
01:25:16,127 --> 01:25:21,434
You're both totally human and totally incorruptible,
and Joe knew that, and... I know it, too.

522
01:25:25,543 --> 01:25:26,824
You're such an asshole.

523
01:25:28,228 --> 01:25:29,843
I never said I was deep.

524
01:25:30,715 --> 01:25:32,426
- Let's go!
- Methos...

525
01:25:33,402 --> 01:25:36,630
Come on, you greasy mongrels! Fresh meat!

526
01:25:49,221 --> 01:25:50,311
The Source!

527
01:25:52,949 --> 01:25:54,921
I'm almost there.

528
01:26:13,412 --> 01:26:17,753
- I await your blessings.
- Rise, Giovanni.

529
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:31,867
- Is this... the end?
- Yes.

530
01:26:34,534 --> 01:26:36,330
I am the One.

531
01:26:42,509 --> 01:26:43,591
No.

532
01:27:03,177 --> 01:27:04,033
Anna.

533
01:27:39,075 --> 01:27:40,549
Anna.

534
01:27:45,396 --> 01:27:46,689
Anna.

535
01:27:52,227 --> 01:27:55,228
Duncan, I knew you would come.

536
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:57,355
Come on.

537
01:28:00,556 --> 01:28:01,625
Come on.

538
01:28:23,505 --> 01:28:27,531
- Get out of my way.
- Doesn't work that way, MacLeod.

539
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:33,650
You can't just run away with the woman.

540
01:28:37,657 --> 01:28:39,458
So why don't you just tell me how it works...

541
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:42,210
- ...in your world.
- One of us has to die.

542
01:28:43,222 --> 01:28:44,869
I've heard that before.

543
01:28:58,699 --> 01:28:59,986
Duncan.

544
01:29:01,947 --> 01:29:02,840
Duncan!

545
01:29:06,791 --> 01:29:07,851
Duncan!

546
01:29:08,579 --> 01:29:09,347
Anna!

547
01:29:20,145 --> 01:29:23,043
- Surprise!
- What is this?

548
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:30,303
- It's not time. Face the Guardian.
- Yeah, face the Guardian.

549
01:29:36,506 --> 01:29:38,683
Atta boy.

550
01:29:42,154 --> 01:29:48,124
Feel that speed. Feel that power.

551
01:29:50,854 --> 01:29:52,233
It's the Source.

552
01:29:55,798 --> 01:29:57,985
And it can be yours.

553
01:29:59,109 --> 01:30:00,607
Forever!

554
01:30:12,611 --> 01:30:15,155
The Source, intoxicating, isn't it?

555
01:30:58,878 --> 01:31:02,355
Pick up the pace or die, Highlander!

556
01:31:11,148 --> 01:31:13,028
The moment is close.

557
01:31:13,648 --> 01:31:16,357
Yeah! The moment is close.

558
01:31:55,728 --> 01:31:57,327
It's happening.

558
01:31:58,428 --> 01:31:59,627
No, Anna!

559
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:33,000
Go ahead.

559
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:39,735
Joe Dawson screamed
like a child when he died.

560
01:32:41,545 --> 01:32:45,674
<i>Are you willing to pay the price?</i>

561
01:32:45,882 --> 01:32:50,000
And Reggie Weller. He cried
like a little girl as I cut him in pieces.

561
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:57,000
You will fight, MacLeod. You will fight!

562
01:33:07,504 --> 01:33:13,259
Yes, I killed your friends.
Take what's yours. Take your revenge.

563
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:17,540
Be who you are!

564
01:33:17,986 --> 01:33:20,556
I am Duncan MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

565
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,296
Who I am is who I was.

566
01:33:23,833 --> 01:33:27,725
Do it, you immortal fuck!

567
01:33:35,562 --> 01:33:37,494
Make your choice Duncan.

568
01:33:38,547 --> 01:33:42,087
- Take my head!
- No.

569
01:33:43,281 --> 01:33:44,808
I'm done with this.

570
01:33:48,872 --> 01:33:55,790
I'm cursed forever!

571
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,246
I feel life.

572
01:34:36,624 --> 01:34:39,314
I feel our child.

573
01:35:03,477 --> 01:35:06,377
He is the One.
