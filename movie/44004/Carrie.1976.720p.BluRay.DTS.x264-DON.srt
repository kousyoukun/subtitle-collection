00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,400
你应该早告诉我的 妈妈 你应该告诉我的
You should've told me, Mama. You should've told me.

133
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,000
哦 上帝啊! 拯救这个满身罪污的女人吧 让她认识到自己生命的罪恶
Oh, Lord! Help this sinning woman to see the sin of her days and ways.

134
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,300
告诉她 如果她清白无罪...
Show her that if she had remained sinless...

135
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
鲜血的惩罚就永不会降临在她身上...
...the curse of blood would never have come on her.

136
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,200
她一定是受了魔鬼的诱惑 有了不洁的想法
She may have been tempted by the Antichrist and had lustful thoughts.

137
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
- 我没有 妈妈! - 别对我说谎 嘉莉
-No, Mama! -Don't lie to me, Carrie.

138
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,400
我看透你了 我能看见你的罪恶 上帝同样也能看见
l can see inside you. l can see the sin as surely as God can.

139
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,700
-放开我 妈妈 你弄疼我了 -我们来祈祷吧 祈祷吧 女人
-Let me go. You're hurting me. -We'll pray. We'll pray, woman.

140
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,400
为我们罪孽深重的不洁的灵魂  向我主耶稣祈祷吧!
Pray to Jesus for our lustful, sinful souls!

141
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,200
"上帝降罪于夏娃 赐她鲜血的惩罚"
''God visited Eve with a curse. And the curse was the curse of blood.

142
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,900
然后他降下了第二项惩罚 这就是生育的痛苦
And He visited with a second curse. And this was the curse of childbearing.

143
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,600
以此增加血与痛的惩戒
And He brought forth pain and sweat and blood.''

144
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,000
《创世纪》 第一章 16节
Genesis 3:1 6.

145
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,000
妈妈 让我出去!
Mama, let me out!

146
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
让我出去 妈妈  求您了!
Please let me out, Mama. Please!

147
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,100
放我出去! 上帝啊!
Let me out! God!

148
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,100
我们的天父--
Our Father who art in heaven--

149
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,500
谢谢 妈妈
Thank you, Mama.

150
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,000
现在你可以去睡觉了
You can go to bed now.

151
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,500
力量啊 多么神奇的力量
There js power, power Wonderful power

152
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,800
羔羊的鲜血里 蕴含着的力量
ln the blood of the Lamb

153
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,200
嘉莉?
Carrie?

154
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,600
- 把门打开 - 门开着呢 妈妈
-Open the door. -lt's open, Mama.

155
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
刚才是什么声音?
What was that noise?

156
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,800
什么声音?
What noise?

157
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
上床睡觉去
Go to bed.

158
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,000
好的 妈妈 我正在做祷告
Yes, ma'am. l'm saying my prayers.

159
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,500
"你们会为我们留下些什么呢...
''What are you going to leave for us...

160
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,400
...你们享受着香车惬意...
...you people in your big cars...

161
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,700
...却不断地将大气污染
...spewing pollution into the air?

162
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,600
你们迈开大步 高歌猛进...
You people with heavy feet...

163
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,600
身后留下的 是践踏破碎的旷野家园
...trampling down the wilderness.

164
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,900
你们这些人啊 偷偷溜进我们的车里...
You people who peer into the back seats of our cars...

165
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,800
 又从后门旅馆后门鱼贯而出
...hours after you come out of the back doors of your motels.

166
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,900
就这样吧 不久之后 我们所拥有的 就只是彼此而已
Soon, all we will have is each other.

167
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,800
这对我们来说 已是足够...
And that could be enough...

168
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,400
...如果你们肯留给我们  充足的空间 新鲜的大气...
...if you will let us have room enough and air enough...

169
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,900
...和平安定的生活...
...and peace enough...

170
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,200
...我们就能籍此 彼此相亲相爱...
...to love each other...

171
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,600
而这些 你们永远无心给予"
...as you never could.''

172
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,600
我得说 我必须承认...
l must confess...

173
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,600
这首诗显示出了非凡的才华...
...this poem displays the most extraordinary talent.

174
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,500
至少你能写出这个来就够有才华了  汤米・罗斯
Talent extraordinary for you, Tommy Ross.

175
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,100
汤米 写诗和橄榄球比赛得分以及本垒打还是有区别的
This is slightly different from running touchdowns and hitting home runs.

176
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,200
诸位同学 有什么评论么?
Class, any criticisms?

177
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,200
有谁来说说么?
Anyone?

178
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,700
很美
lt's beautiful.

179
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,500
嘉莉・怀特! 你说很美!

180
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800

181
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,200
美啊!
 Beautiful!

182
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,000
哦 广袤的天空 美啊
''Oh, beautiful for spacious skies.

183
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,400
琥珀色的麦浪 美啊
For amber waves of grain.''

184
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,800
嘉莉 你说的是指这种美么?
ls that the beautiful you mean, Carrie?

185
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,400
恐怕这不能算是评论吧
l'm afraid this is hardly a criticism.

186
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,500
狗屁
You suck.

187
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,900
汤米 你说什么?
Tommy, did you say something?

188
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
- 谁? 我么? - 对 就是你
-Who, me? -Yes, you.

189
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,900
我是说 "够精辟"
l said, ''Aw, shucks.''

190
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,600
- 现在点名 布莱克 - 到

l want you all to know you did a really shitty thing yesterday.

207
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,600
你们当中有没有人想过 嘉莉・怀特也是有血有肉有感情的人?
Did any of you ever stop to think that Carrie White has feelings?

208
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,700
你们有人想过这个么?
Do any of you ever stop to think?

209
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,300
没有 我猜你们满脑子想的都是舞会的舞伴...
No, l guess you're too busy thinking about your dates...

210
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,100
还有参加舞会的事情...
...and the prom.

211
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,600
克莉丝 你有选择了吧

- 你舞会上的小王子是谁呀? - 比利・诺兰

很好
Right.

219
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,300
对于你们这次小小的恶作剧呢 我的意见是...
Now, my idea for this little trick you pulled...

220
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,100
停课3天 并且扣发你们参加舞会的门票
...was three days' suspension and refusal of your prom tickets.

221
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
什么?
What?

222
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,400
老天!
God!

223
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,300
这让你们不知所措了吧 是不是?
That'd get you where you live, wouldn't it?

224
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,900
这是你们应得的惩罚
And you'd deserve it.

225
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,300
因为我想 你们没人认识到...
l don't think any of you have any idea...

226
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,200
自己做的事情是多么过分
...of just how nasty what you did really was.

227
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,400
但是教务处决定  只让你们做一个礼拜的额外锻炼
But the office has decided you're to have one week's detention.

228
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,700
不过 我仍然是教练  额外锻炼内容由我决定和负责
Still there's one little catch. lt's to be my detention.

229
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,600
每天50分钟的时间...
That's 50 minutes every day...

230
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,300
地点在田径运动场... 就从今天开始
...starting today on the athletic field.

231
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,100
- 听明白了吧? - 我才不去
-Get the picture? -l'm not coming.

232
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,000
随便你 克莉丝
That's up to you, Chris.

233
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,500
你们也是 随便你们选择
That's up to all of you.

234
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,400
逃避额外锻炼的惩罚就是...
Punishment for skipping detention...

235
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,400
...停课3天...
...is three days' suspension...

236
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,600
并且取消参加舞会的资格...
...and refusal of your prom tickets.

237
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,900
还有别的想法么?
Any other thoughts?

238
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,500
很好 那现在换衣服去吧
Good. Now change up.

239
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,600
- 你们干吗去? - 不得不去了
-Where are you going? -l can't stay after.

240
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,400
- 快走吧 - 我才不去
-Come on. -l'm not coming.

241

- 你不想参加舞会了么? - 我就是不去
-You're gonna miss out on the prom? -l'm not coming.

242
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,400
我可不能错过舞会

因为对于嘉莉・怀特来说这是大事 这你也知道的
Because it is a very big deal for Carrie White, and you know it.

401
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,100
她已经拒绝我了
She already said no anyway.

402
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,800
- 再努力一下 她会改变主意的 - 别想当然了
-With some effort, you can change that. -Don't count your chickens.

403
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,000
- 不许再去了 - 好 我不会的
-Just don't try. -Fine, l won't try.

404
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,100
等一下 这不行!
Wait a second. lt's not fine!

405
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,800
你不能强迫别人不许带哪个人参加舞会
You can't order someone not to take someone to the prom.

406
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,100
我必须得确定你们绝对不会再伤害嘉莉・怀特
l can make sure you don't hurt Carrie White anymore.

407
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,100
我们不是要伤害她 柯林斯小姐 我们是想要帮助她
We're not trying to hurt her. We're trying to help her.

408
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,800
怎么帮?
How?

409
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,300
嘿 汤米 嗯...
Tommy...

410
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,700
要是你和嘉莉一起参加舞会的话 你难道不觉得自己看起来很荒谬么?
...don't you think you'll look silly when you walk in the prom with Carrie?

411
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,100
我们不在乎我们看起来是什么样子
We don't care how we look.

412
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,100
对么?
Do we?

413
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,000

- 嗨 嘉莉 - 嗨
-Hi, Carrie. -Hi.

415
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,100
嗯 这就是你住的地方是吧?
So this is where you live?

416
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,800
你来干吗?
What are you doing here?

417
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,500
你不邀请我进去么?
You going to ask me in?

418
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,900
为什么不呢?
Why not?

419
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,300
我妈妈在休息呢 你要干什么?
Mama's resting. What do you want?

420
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,800
老天 直奔主题 是不是?
God, right to the point, huh?

421
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,300
- 还是舞会的事情咯 - 我都已经和你说过了
-About the prom. -l already told you.

422
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,500
我知道 不过可别说无论如何你都不会改变主意  女孩子们总是这样说
But nothing says you can't change your mind. Girls do it all the time.

423
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,900
- 你干嘛要这样? - 因为我想
-Why are you doing this? -Because l want to.

424
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,000
- 不 你不是这么想的 - 嘉莉 听着 我不会做我不想做的事情
-No, you're not. -l don't do anything l don't want.

425
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
- 我不能去! - 不 你能去
-l can't! -Yes, you can.

426
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,200
- 你最好快走吧 - 除非你答应我
 -You better go. -Not till you say yes.

427
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,600
- 不 我不能去! - 不 你会的
-No, l can't! -Yes, you can.

428
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,500

429

不 你会的

00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,800
- 我求你快走好不好? - 除非你答应我
-Will you please go? -Not till you say yes.

431
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,800
你干吗这么执着?
Why is it so important to you?

432
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,800
不知道 或许是因为你喜欢我的诗吧
l don't know. Maybe because you liked my poem.

433
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,000
好吧 我去
Okay, l'll go.

434

Good. l'll pick you up at 8:00.

435
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,900
这是干吗? 我们是要叫这些猪起床么?  噜―噜―噜噜
What's the matter? We gonna wake up the piggies? Oink, oink.

436
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
开玩笑可不是好玩的 比尔
This is a hell of a risk for a joke, Bill.

437
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,700
- 你不想干了? - 不是 只是个玩笑而已

-All these pigs! -What are you talking about?

441
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,000
这些画着的猪
These painted pigs.

442
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,800
这都是那个蠢老头和他的傻侄子画的
The stupid old man and his nitwit cousin painted them all over.

443
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,600
我知道 我和那个给他做模特的女孩出去过
l know. l went out with the girl that posed for him.

444
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,700

00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,800
- 把我弄上去吧 - 小声点儿
-Will you let me up here? -Quiet.

446
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,300
你是去杀猪的吧?
You're gonna kill that pig, right?

447
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,800
猪啊! 到这来 小猪乖乖!

-Here's one right here. -Will you shut up and do it?

452
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,900
我要让它们享受一下
l've gotta give them a chance to burp.

453
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,600
你杵在这儿什么也干不了 把它弄过来 伙计 
You can't do it from standing out here. Get her done, man.

嘉莉 苹果派你一口都没吃
Carrie, you haven't touched your apple cake.

463
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,600
妈妈 我吃那个长疹子
lt gives me pimples, Mama.

464
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,500
疹子是上帝给你的惩罚

我就是这么教育你的么?
After all you've been taught?

不是所有的人都是坏人 也不是每做一件事都是罪过
Everyone isn't bad. Everything isn't a sin.

481

After the blood come the boys like sniffing dogs.

Grinning and slobbering, and trying to find out where that smell comes from.

妈妈 我不是特例

You poor child.

Don't you know he doesn't let you know he's working through you?

507
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,700
妈妈 我很清醒

所有的人都知道

00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,300
你必须弃绝这力量  你必须舍弃它并且永不再用它
You must renounce this power. You must give it up and never use it.

513

Why is he doing it? Everybody is talking about it.

555
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,700

-You gotta rent a tuxedo for the prom! -l only got $1 0.

10块钱你就能租一套礼服了! 不然你就不像样子
Ten bucks you can rent a tuxedo! You don't have to look great.

- 你怎么知道? 你穿过礼服么? - 我没长能穿礼服的身材
-Do you know? Ever put on a tuxedo? -l don't have a tuxedo body.

-l know they have tuxedos here for you. -l wouldn't look right.

脱掉你的裙子!
Take off that dress!

590
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,100
我们一起烧掉它 然后做祷告祈求赦免
We'll burn it together and pray for forgiveness.

591
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,700
不 妈妈

00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,900
- 他不会来的 - 他会来的
-He's not coming. -He is coming.

593

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,900
住手 妈妈! 别再伤害自己了!
Stop it, Mama! Stop hurting yourself!

598
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,000
我是对的 他会嘲笑你的 他们都会嘲笑你的!
l'm right. He's gonna laugh at you. They're all gonna laugh at you!

599
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,400
- 他们不会嘲笑我的 - 现在还不晚 留下来 和我在一起
-They're not gonna laugh at me. -lt's not too late. Stay here with me.

600
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,900
我不想和你待在一起
l don't want to stay with you.

601
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,500
我会去开门 然后告诉他你病了 快改变主意吧
l'll answer the door and tell him you're sick, you changed your mind.

602
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,400
坐下来 安静!
Sit down and be quiet!

603
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,800
- 我会告诉他的 说你改变主意了 - 给我坐下!
-l'll tell him you changed your mind. -Sit down!

610
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,400
- 你在害怕么? - 嗯
Are you scared?

611
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,100
或许这是个错误
Maybe this was a mistake.

612
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,800
哦 不会的 情况不会那么糟的

别这么紧张嘛
Don't be so nervous.

616
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,800
另外 要是我自己一个人跳舞的话 我看起来可尴尬死了 是不是?
Besides, l'd look awfully stupid dancing by myself, wouldn't l?

617
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,400

Ross, if l knew you'd look this sharp...

619
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,400
我宁可带你来而不带...她叫什么来着
...l would've taken you instead of what's-her-name.

620
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,200
别理他们 他们要是欺负你的话...
Don't bother about them. lf they self-destruct...

621
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,300
我就和你跳舞的

00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,400
嘉莉

636
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,600
嗨 柯林斯小姐
Hi, Miss Collins.

00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,300
- 你真漂亮 - 你也是
-You look so pretty. -You too.

638
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,400
你美丽极了!
You look beautiful!

639
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,300
谢谢 我知道我没那么好看 不过还是谢谢您的夸奖
Thank you. l know l don't, not really. But thank you anyway.

640
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:24,800
我可以坐这里么?
May l sit down?

641
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,900
- 请坐这里吧 - 谢谢
-Have a chair. -Thank you.

642
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
我去和别人说会儿话
l'm gonna talk to some people.

643
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,300
我还记得我的高中舞会
l remember my prom.

644
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,800
我当时的舞伴是篮球队队长
l had a date with the captain of the basketball team.

645
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,700
他足有6英尺7英寸高
He was 6 feet 7 inches tall.

646
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,700
所以我买了双3英寸的高跟鞋...
So l bought a pair of three-inch spike heels...

647
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:08,700
这样 晚上我们亲吻的时候 情况就不会...太尴尬
...so our kiss good night would be less awkward.

648
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,500
然后 我们坐进了他的敞篷车里...
So anyway, we went in his pickup truck...

649
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,300
然后 车抛锚了 我们就不得不下车...
...which, of course, broke down and we had to get out...

650
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,500
然后走完剩下的半英里路程去参加舞会
...and walk the last half-mile to the prom.

651
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
可是 当我们走到的时候 我满脚都是水泡了...
By the time l got there, my feet were so covered with blisters...

652
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,600
所以我就只能干坐着
...that all l could do was sit.

653
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,900
因为我没法跳舞了 所以我们所做的只是仅仅坐着 聊天
l couldn't dance. So we just sat there and just talked.

654

l should've killed myself when he put it in me...

774
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,800

罪恶无法消逝

然后他抱住了我

他抱住了我!
He took me!

788
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,400

With the stink of the filthy roadhouse whiskey on his breath.

789
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,500
