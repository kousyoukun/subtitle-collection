1
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:24,986
对于每一种动能

2
00:01:26,914 --> 00:01:30,514
都有大小相等、方向相反的反作用力

3
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:00,566
北极圈

4
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:48,609
致命螳螂
翻译制作anthrax06

5
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,240
雷达的设计，是为了保护我们免受攻击

6
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:38,874
雷达站建立在山顶上

7
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:41,973
在荒漠中，在杳无人烟的森林深处

8
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:46,102
更多的，是建立在保密和隔绝的地方

9
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:50,245
在两大洋的上空有雷达巡逻机

10
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:54,703
在大洋之中，人造岛屿雷达站保护着我们的侧翼

11
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:56,933
这是近海警戒船

12
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,823
数百海里外的它们正在担负海上警戒任务

13
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:04,384
还有一张雷达网横跨未设防的

14
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:08,025
美国与加拿大的边界

15
00:04:11,228 --> 00:04:13,528
一条松树雷达网

16
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:19,276
除此之外

17
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,719
还有另外一条侦查网络

18
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:25,955
加拿大中部雷达网

19
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:35,963
甚至再往北，在靠近北极圈的位置

20
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:40,214
还有一道被称为DEW的远程雷达预警系统

21
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:47,003
随时准备着，对在极地地区发生的偷袭首先发出警告信号

22
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:53,378
DEW远程预警舰队已经组建

23
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,920
自从诺曼底战役以来
它们执行了大多数大型的和秘密的军事行动

24
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:02,060
它们驰骋在广袤的极地冰海之中

25
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:05,116
义无反顾的同漫长的时间和恶劣的天气做着斗争

26
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:10,333
船上卸下堆积成山的补给品，以及大量的

27
00:05:10,536 --> 00:05:13,536
供冰上作业的设备、车辆和人员

28
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:26,558
首先，平整出供大型运输机起降的飞机场

29
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:33,607
然后修建营房、机库和指挥所

30
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,148
在一些人忙着铺设输油管道的同时

31
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,924
另一些工程坦克正在建设储油仓库

32
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:46,563
工作在日以继夜、昼夜不停

33
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,730
一周无休的进行着

34
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:53,184
终于，船队开走了，夏天也过去了

35
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:55,864
但是工程完工了

36
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,833
在人类探索北极一百周年的时候，红鹰一号

37
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:07,128
DEW远程雷达预警网的重要枢纽

38
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:09,047
正式投入使用

39
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:17,904
Parkman上校抵达，派出吉普车接机

40
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:33,278
Parkman上校?欢迎你到这来

41
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,178
更北边的

42
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:39,135
大陆顶端

43
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,367
是DEW网的前哨站

44
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:52,174
嘿Mike,嘿Mike,来看看这个

45
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:59,033
我什么也没看到

46
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,189
嘿，等一下

47
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:02,878
你听!

48
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:10,189
这声音好像就在我们头顶!

49
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,819
这里是Kane,7327号巡逻机，呼叫红鹰一号

50
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,240
红鹰一号请回答

51
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:40,376
这里是Kane,7327号巡逻机，呼叫红鹰一号

52
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:41,633
红鹰一号请回答

53
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:45,077
你好7327，这里是红鹰一号，收到你的来电，完毕

54
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:46,871
Pete，能帮我接一下老头子吗?

55
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,750
好的，收到

56
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:52,715
长官，Kane中尉有事找你

57
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,221
我是Parkman上校, Walter?有什么事？

58
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:59,439
长官，我们在气象四号上空

59
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:03,351
哨站遭到毁坏，看来像是屋顶塌了

60
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,050
如果里面有人的话肯定受伤了，甚至更糟

61
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,650
我试着联系他们，可是没有收到回话，完毕

62
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,550
我们这就过去!通话结束

63
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,560
气象四号最后一次报告是在什么时候?

64
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,960
是在八点钟，长官，准确无误

65
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,660
- 看你能不能联系上他们
- 好的

66
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,680
红鹰一号呼叫气象四号,
红鹰一号呼叫气象四号，请回答

67
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,860
没有回应，长官

68
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,060
再试试

69
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,260
红鹰一号呼叫气象四号,
红鹰一号呼叫气象四号，请回答

70
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,870
调度室，我是Parkman上校

71
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:50,728
把我的飞机准备好

72
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:52,019
还有，叫上Pizar中尉

73
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,970
红鹰一号呼叫气象四号
红鹰一号呼叫气象四号，请回答

74
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,870
两个人就这样不见了!

75
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,170
是啊

76
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,470
我不明白

77
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,410
当他们在八点钟报告的时候一切都正常

78
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,870
从那以后也没有什么反常情况的报告，没有暴风雪。。

79
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,270
这屋子不是被风刮倒的

80
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,680
像是有什么东西从屋顶掉了进来把墙砸塌了

81
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,480
如果是一架飞机的话。。

82
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,280
也许，这里发生的事并没有什么特殊的原因

83
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,620
也许他们现在正在回基地的路上

84
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
步行吗?

85
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,580
那他们也会留下脚印的，你看到了吗?

86
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,380
来看看这个!

87
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
你发现什么了?

88
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,580
我不知道!

89
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,980
- 是飞机吗?
- 没有一架飞机能滑行那么短

90
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,140
直升机?

91
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:36,314
不是，直升机不会留下这样的痕迹

92
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,790
如果这里发生的事不是因为什么特殊的原因，那。。

93
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:48,824
我可不会打这个赌的

94
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,383
那么，你最近一起与气象站联系

95
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:12,514
是在五天前直升机

96
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,090
给那里运送补给的时候?

97
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:15,098
是的，长官

98
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:17,399
- 你查过气象一号了吗?
- 是的

99
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,190
气象四号在八点十三的时候和他们联系过

100
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,790
一切都很正常!

101
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,490
我发现了些东西上校，但不知道是什么

102
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,790
我从来没有见过这样的信号

103
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,390
它在那，它又不见了!

104
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,490
嘿，它又出现了, 你认为这是什么？

105
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,990
我可不想冒任何险，拉响红色警报!

106
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,490
航向360，高度三千英尺，不明飞行物距离九十英里

107
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,500
红色领队呼叫塔台
什么也没有发现，请给我们提供新的航向

108
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,900
不明飞行消失，返回本部

109
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,155
Jerry!

110
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,500
飞糖呼叫红鹰一号

111
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,800
红鹰一号请回答

112
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,200
飞糖呼叫红鹰一号

113
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,600
红鹰一号请回答

114
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,400
你好飞糖，这里是红鹰一号，请讲

115
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,600
红鹰一号，我们正在C47残骸上空

116
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,010
他们找到它了，上校!

117
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,810
- 找到他们的位置
- 是的，长官

118
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,010
- 通知Pizar中尉
- 是的，长官

119
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,610
上校!

120
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,210
看起来和气象站那一样

121
00:15:44,755 --> 00:15:46,055
没错

122
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,117
他们在哪?尸体在哪?

123
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:23,210
别着急

124
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,590
小心!

125
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,910
这究竟是什么。。

126
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:53,434
这是什么?

127
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:55,459
我不知道

128
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,620
看起来像是从什么东西上折断的

129
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,792
头上就像针一样尖利

130
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,680
我看不出来，你难到我了

131
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,136
我们怎么办?

132
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:21,495
我们必须得通知CONAD

133
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,820
这里是CONAD

134
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:29,526
美国本土防空司令部
位于科罗拉多斯普林斯市

135
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:34,743
他们的工作重点是拱卫北美大陆领空的安全

136
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:38,298
他们工作的成败事关数百万美国人的

137
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,330
生与死

138
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,530
这些是热线电话!

139
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,730
使用这些电话，只要十五秒就能联通阿拉斯加

140
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,730
只要十秒就能给纽芬兰发去警报

141
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,330
五秒可以联系到各位!

142
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,030
三秒就能联系到五角大楼指挥部

143
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,730
我是Ford将军

144
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,230
是的

145
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,690
我知道了

146
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,230
好的，我会坐飞机过去

147
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,230
北方司令部的东西运到了

148
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,183
下午好先生们

149
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,330
我是Ford将军，哦，没关系的，请坐吧

150
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:30,096
先生们

151
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,930
我知道空军方面没有给你们太多时间让你们进行研究

152
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,758
而且在这么短的时间里，要把它完全搞清楚

153
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,454
也确实是有难度的

154
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,599
但是国防部希望

155
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:45,279
在接下来的两天里，你们要全力以赴，对这个东西

156
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,340
能够得出一些结论

157
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,840
Gunther教授，我想你应该是这里的负责人

158
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,540
我们所有人达成了一个共识

159
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,440
这样东西是从某种生物身上掉落下来的

160
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,640
但这个东西作为这个生物的一部分，它到底是什么

161
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,940
我们完全摸不着头绪

162
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,640
我们的物种学家Arnold Burton博士
也无法确定它的来源

163
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,540
Harvy Pierce教授通过他的研究确信

164
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,450
这个钩子状的东西，肯定不属于神经系统

165
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,850
看起来你们似乎还是搞不清这是个什么东西

166
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:27,862
你说的很正确，将军

167
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:32,856
先生们，让我们来梳理一下

168
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,950
刚才你们告诉这个钩子状的物体

169
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,850
是来自某种生物体，对吧

170
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,950
但这个东西不是军方的货物

171
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,350
而且在飞机起飞时它也并不在飞机上

172
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,150
所以它一定是在撞机之后掉落的，对吗?

173
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,250
听起来合乎逻辑

174
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,760
那我们面前的这个东西到底是什么?

175
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,160
这应该没有那么困难，你们知道北极没有多少种动物

176
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,760
这个我们也想到了，将军

177
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,860
你不会是想说这个东西所属的那个生物

178
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,460
是一个未知物种？

179
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,960
有这种可能性，我们建议你进行调查，将军

180
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,960
怎么做?

181
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,460
我们建议你去找一下华盛顿自然历史博物馆的


182
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,860
Nedrick Jackson博士来看一下这个东西

183
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,315
他是那里的首席科学家

184
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,984
和我国在食肉动物研究方面的权威

185
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,970
你把我说糊涂了，教授

186
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,870
他专门处理生活在远古地质时期的

187
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,770
动物和植物的化石

188
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:37,101
他只需要用少量的骨骼

189
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:39,400
就能够复原

190
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,371
史前生物

191
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,150

192
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,670
- 嗨Marge
- 嗨

193
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,370
你在做什么?

194
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,770
一个孩子在初中科学兴趣小组上做的

195
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,070
甚至还增加了一组额外的脊椎骨，就像它还不够多似的

196
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,250
给你，你想数数吗?

197
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,370
听我说，如果我还想让下个月的杂志出版发行的话

198
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,970
我们最好开始工作了

199
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,470
我拿了一些图片

200
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,680
穿越时代的生命之旅

201
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,880
展现史前生物的演化进程

202
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,780
从深海水母，到恐龙，再到原始人

203
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:35,771
听起来很好

204
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:38,980
而且我打算加入一些上次野外考察拍的照片

205
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:40,657
那真是太好了

206
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:42,042
哦，抱歉

207
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
我是Jackson

208
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,080
五角大楼?好的，我会等的

209
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,000
你知道嘛也许他们想重新招我回去服役

210
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,390
我是Jackson博士

211
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,190
Ford将军?

212
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,990
是的

213
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,390
是的

214
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,890
我明白将军

215
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,990
好的将军，我马上就赶过去

216
00:22:10,748 --> 00:22:11,848
没什么事吧?

217
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
当然

218
00:22:15,492 --> 00:22:17,792
是不是每天五角大楼都打电话找你

219
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,690
- 你可真是好打听
- 好吧，故弄玄虚

220
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,300
如果告诉你，你能保密吗

221
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,300
我保证!

222
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,300
他们在北极发现了一个古老的生物骨骼

223
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,500
五角大楼想知道那骨骼是属于哪种生物的

224
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,400
这看起来不像是骨头

225
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,700
更像是软骨或某种组织

226
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,178
如此巨大的结构一定有

227
00:23:06,203 --> 00:23:08,524
其非常特殊的用途从而便于卡特尔化

228
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,000
你知道它是属于哪种生物的吗?

229
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,300
不，不知道

230
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
如果它是骨头的话我们肯定能查出来

231
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,310
然而不管它是什么，它肯定不是来自一只动物身上

232
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:23,910
因为每种我们已知的动物物种都有骨骼结构

233
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,310
事实上，爬行动物和人类都有

234
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,310
甚至鸟类也有

235
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,610
看起来我们快无计可施了

236
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,910
相反，我们取得了很大的进展

237
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,510
至少我们知道了它不是骨头
这样能引导我们最终查出它到底是什么

238
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,310
那有什么生物是没有骨骼结构的吗?

239
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:46,110
那就多了，蠕虫、昆虫、蜗牛、贝壳类生物

240
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,710
一些无脊椎动物它们的骨骼在身体之外

241
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,814
它们的外壳就是骨骼

242
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,244
非常坚硬，足以保护体内器官

243
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,720
昆虫在它们的头和身体上有一些柔软灵活的地方

244
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,220
从而便于它们自由的活动

245
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,820
它们身上一些褶皱的位置是由肌肉相连接

246
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,820
这很有可能就是

247
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
那是一只虫子?

248
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,620
这就是引导我们使用排除法的过程

249
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,920
当然，如果它是一只虫子
它绝对不会告诉我们它究竟是什么

250
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
我们只能靠现有的这部分去寻找答案

251
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:26,425
但更多的只能依靠推论

252
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,530
博士，你的话听起来有点像是福尔摩斯

253
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:28,930
有一点

254
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,030
Gunther教授, 从这个钩状物根部流出的液体

255
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:35,916
- 你进行化验了吗? 
- 我们做了，当时能做的我们都做了

256
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:38,485
当然，你们也不知道到底应该找什么

257
00:24:38,517 --> 00:24:39,517
没错

258
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,160
我对昆虫学并不是十分了解，但我似乎记得。。

259
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,330
除极少数外，大多数昆虫的血液中

260
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,130
是不含有红血球的

261
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,730
现在我们怀疑这个东西可能是来自一只昆虫

262
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:53,231
你能帮我对这些液体进行一下化验然后把结果告诉我吗?

263
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:54,749
- 我很乐意
- 谢谢

264
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,640
好了将军，关于这个东西

265
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:59,175
Gunther教授会进行化验，然后。。

266
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:01,103
我们就会知道我们所想的到底是什么

267
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,010
你觉得我们会有所发现吗?

268
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:04,426
我们会尽最大努力的

269
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,542
极地悲剧被披露

270
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:46,264
空军公开了一起神秘的事故和失踪事件

271
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:51,835
那么，那就是他们把你找去的原因了

272
00:25:53,366 --> 00:25:55,466
别跟我兜圈子了，Ned Jackson

273
00:25:56,647 --> 00:25:57,647
我很抱歉

274
00:25:57,767 --> 00:26:00,467
有句老话说的好，不要想着对媒体有任何隐瞒

275
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:02,867
即使是我这种只负责一本博物馆刊物的人

276
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:05,034
也不会失去对新闻的敏感

277
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:06,803
事情就是这样

278
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:08,652
- 也许吧
- 我知道!

279
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:11,751
- 你也许不知道!
- 这就是明摆着的嘛!

280
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,580
听我说

281
00:26:14,245 --> 00:26:16,345
五角大楼以前从来没有找你咨询过

282
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:19,169
报纸上说他们掌握着一个秘密

283
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:21,400
一加一等于二，所以接下来

284
00:26:21,425 --> 00:26:24,079
他们必须要知道一些你的研究领域的情况

285
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:26,327
哦Ned, 跟我说说吧

286
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:28,946
你不知道那意味着什么，如果我可以

287
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:31,092
把一个发生在本世纪的故事刊登出来的话!

288
00:26:32,294 --> 00:26:33,394
我。。

289
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,100
- 他们没有说那是保密的
- 你知道?

290
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:41,766
好吧，就像报纸上说的那样

291
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,100
那里确实发生了坠机和失踪事件

292
00:26:44,297 --> 00:26:47,397
但故事的关键是，他们在上次坠机中找到的东西

293
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:49,741
它，它大约有五英尺长

294
00:26:50,327 --> 00:26:51,727
它的外表是绿色的

295
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:55,896
可能是从某种生物的身体上折断的

296
00:26:56,585 --> 00:26:58,385
你在说什么

297
00:26:58,388 --> 00:26:59,888
那东西是活的

298
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:04,198
那东西一定是巨大的令人难以置信

299
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:06,891
我认为那东西来自一只昆虫身上

300
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,170
一只昆虫?

301
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,270
我画给你看

302
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,770
即使尺寸缩小了可看上还是很吓人，是不是?

303
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,370
不，不会的

304
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,870
它看起来就是一直蚱蜢或是蟋蟀腿上的刺

305
00:27:24,788 --> 00:27:26,988
蚱蜢和蟋蟀可并不吃肉

306
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,380
已经至少有五个人失踪了

307
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,180
如果它是昆虫身上的

308
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,680
那它一定是有史以来最大的生物

309
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,580
你确定你没事吧?

310
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,380
在雪地里有很长的像刹车印一样的痕迹

311
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,980
仿佛那个东西是从天而降

312
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
我是Jackson

313
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,280
哦你好，Gunther教授，有结果了吗

314
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,680
我明白先生，谢谢

315
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:09,087
他们刚刚做完了血液化验

316
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:10,968
没有红血球

317
00:28:13,115 --> 00:28:14,415
它就是来自一只昆虫身上

318
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:20,256
这只琥珀里的蚂蚁已经有九千万岁了

319
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,190
现在我们已经能够从这样的琥珀标本中学到很多知识

320
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:29,590
某些古代昆虫直至今天它的外形都没有发生改变

321
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,890
另外一些为了满足不断变化的生存条件
而不得不改变自己的外形

322
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,090
还有一些种类则彻底灭绝了

323
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,790
我只是不能相信像你所说的竟然存在这么大的昆虫

324
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,590
看看你身后的墙上，教授

325
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,390
这只史前的蜻蜓根据测量它的翼展能达到两英尺长

326
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:52,690
而且它的外表和现在的蜻蜓很相似
它也是肉食性昆虫

327
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,200
没错，它是很大，但也只有两英尺

328
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,300
这就是你所说的巨型昆虫吗?

329
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,300
我可从来没说过我们要找的是一只蜻蜓

330
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:01,643
那你认为它是什么?

331
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,700
老实跟你说，我也不是很确定

332
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,500
你是一名病理学家Gunther教授

333
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,500
病理学的领域是有限的

334
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,300
但古生物学中我们真正探明的领域也很有限

335
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,623
反之，我们就是要尽量将

336
00:29:18,648 --> 00:29:20,524
我们的视野放宽要包罗万象

337
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,800
好吧，只是为了进行探讨

338
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,110
我们承认曾经存在过这样的昆虫

339
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,610
那它怎么能活到今天?

340
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:31,710
没错! 即使最近在西伯利亚发现的
那些史前动物，它们也都是死的

341
00:29:32,391 --> 00:29:33,891
尽管它们的肉能吃

342
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,773
它们的皮还能做衣服

343
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:37,366
象牙还能制成工具

344
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,410
但那些猛犸象被发现时已经死了

345
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,010
你确定它们死了吗?

346
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,510
什么意思?每个人都知道它们死了

347
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,210
每个人都说它们死了

348
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,520
假设那些当地人没有急着把它们切成肉块

349
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,220
假设它们在冰里被发现时还活着

350
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,140
你这位有学识的朋友总是喜欢这样吗?

351
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,920
好吧，教授

352
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,320
你我都清楚，如果一个活的有机体
被以极快的速度冷冻住

353
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,707
理论上讲可能会阻止其

354
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:04,544
原生细胞改变几何图形

355
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,520
会永远保持死时的状态

356
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,320
理论上讲，是的

357
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,220
那你自己想想这是不合理的吗？

358
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,620
是否那些猛犸象在那段时间里可能还活着

359
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,243
只是它们还没有来得及融化和复活

360
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:15,454
就被那些西伯利亚人给杀了!

361
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,530
你。。你相信这些吗?

362
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,830
我相信!

363
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,430
而且我坚信这一点，除非有人能讲出更好的理论

364
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,630
听着，五个人失踪了

365
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,430
他们死了，就这样不见了

366
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,530
一点踪迹都没有留下!

367
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:29,997
只能是被某种食肉生物吃了!

368
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:32,954
但是有很多昆虫都是以吃其它种类的昆虫为生

369
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:33,918
你从哪入手呢?

370
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,430
想想那个钩子

371
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,330
把它想象的非常非常小

372
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,140
把它想象成我们今天已知的那些昆虫的一部分

373
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,340
像蚱蜢、甲虫或是蟋蟀

374
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
那你再想想

375
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,640
在普通的食肉昆虫中，哪种会有这样的钩子?

376
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,440
Ned, 你做的都是假设

377
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,240
每一个古生物学家都会这样做

378
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,398
看啊，先是下颚骨，然后是牙齿

379
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:56,864
不管它们是吃肉的还是食草的，你都从那开始想!

380
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,940
一只普通的昆虫，还是食肉的

381
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,740
我想到了一个!

382
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,151
它的食物主要是小昆虫

383
00:31:09,176 --> 00:31:11,864
例如叶蝉、草蜢、毛虫等

384
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:16,510
很大一部分食物可能还包括小青蛙和蜥蜴

385
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,463
雌性要比雄性体积大很多

386
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:20,974
当交配完之后，雌性会杀死它的伴侣

387
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,870
这个钩子是他们在飞机上找到的

388
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,550
很有可能是它前腿上的刺

389
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:33,291
如果这就是我们要找的巨型生物的话。。

390
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,350
我会是否有什么东西能够杀死它

391
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,950
它的毁灭力远远超过它的外表

392
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,350
它能走，会跳还会飞

393
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,750
它的胃口永远不知道满足

394
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,130
你是说，是这个可爱的小虫子?

395
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,397
是的，那个可爱的小虫子

396
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:51,479
这地球的生物的当中

397
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,460
再没有比这更贪婪更致命的生物了

398
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:56,902
那就是掠食螳螂

399
00:33:31,891 --> 00:33:34,891
格陵兰岛的爱斯基摩人陷入恐慌

400
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,460
有什么新发生的灾祸吗, 将军?

401
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,560
没有了，先生吗

402
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,360
嘿，你是不是自然历史博物馆的Jackson博士?

403
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,360
- 没错
- 你为什么被叫来?

404
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,960
- Jackson博士是我的老朋友了
- 这不是真正的原因,将军

405
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,270
你是一个古生物学家，这是不是超出你的研究范围了?

406
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,970
你还有什么理论吗，Jackson博士?

407
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,670
先生们, 如果你们处在我的位置

408
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,770
你们所说的理论，那不是事实，只是一种推测

409
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,070
我相信你们对那些猜测不会乱写
因为那可能是灾难性的

410
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,970
我们相信你们已经意识到了

411
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:06,670
希望你们能跟我们合作从而避免民众的过度恐慌

412
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,870
我知道我可以相信你们的

413
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,370
祝你好运Ned

414
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,870
谢谢，我会尽力的

415
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,570
- 嗨!
- 准备好了吗?

416
00:34:35,288 --> 00:34:36,588
就差把它扣上了

417
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,380
我告诉了空军方面不喜欢等人

418
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,680
我这就好了，给你，干点你力所能及的

419
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,580
很高兴你能来送我

420
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,880
我也这样想

421
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,480
你知道嘛，北极是我唯一没有研究过的地方

422
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,180
那些也是我的吗?

423
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
不，博士，那些是我的

424
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,680
你的?

425
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,580
你不能光自己去而把你的摄影师丢下，是不是?

426
00:35:11,004 --> 00:35:11,904
我的什么?

427
00:35:11,922 --> 00:35:14,165
我给Ford将军打了电话

428
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,746
请求批准我作为你的摄影师和你一起去

429
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,790
我想他忘了告诉你了

430
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,890
小伙计，这次真的要写成一篇故事了

431
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,490
你为了这个故事早就做好准备了，是不是?

432
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,690
差不多吧

433
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,090
走吧!

434
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,690
上校

435
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,790
Jackson博士从华盛顿过来了，他带了。。

436
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,290
我是说。。

437
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,390
- 我们。。
- 说清楚点!

438
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,700
他和一个女人一起来的

439
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,000
一个女人

440
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,540
I thought they'd stopped
making them.

441
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Then show them in.

442
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,400
是的，长官

443
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,800
I'm Ned Jackson Colonel,
I'm sure that Washington...

444
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,100
Excuse me, this is Miss Marjorie Blain;
Colonel Joe Parkman.

445
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,600
El General Ford sent me up.

446
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,300
I'm magazine editor for the
Museum of Natural History.

447
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,300
How do you do?
How do you do?

448
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,810
Uh, that will be all men.

449
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,570
It looks like you don't have
too many women up here Colonel.

450
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,410
Ah we have a little joke up here...

451
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,010
The boys say there's a girl
behind every tree.

452
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,210
Only try and find a tree.

453
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,050
Well when do we see what
we came for.

454
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,510
I'll have a plane any
time you're ready.

455
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,010
I'm ready.
Fine.

456
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,410
These are the skid marks.

457
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,010
At least what's left of them.

458
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,110
We found the same marks at the
weather shack, and the Eskimo village.

459
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
Here Colonel.

460
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,420
Got it?

461
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,720
Eight and a half feet.

462
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,840
Let's get back to the plane.

463
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,920
At ease.

464
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,820
Gentlemen, this is
Marjorie Blaine.

465
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,800
I thought you wouldn't mind too much if
she had a look around your recreation room.

466
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,720
Aw she's like a butterfly.

467
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,720
Light and crosses
absolutely boss.

468
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,820
Yes Corporal?

469
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,330
Well, ah, with your permission
sir...

470
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:13,430
Would it be alright if...
would it be alright if...

471
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,050
I asked Miss Blaine to dance, sir?

472
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,830
Corporal that decision is entirely
up to Miss Blaine.

473
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,430
Yes sir.

474
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,830
Miss Blaine would you care to...

475
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,430
Well, what I mean
is... while I'm not...

476
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,469
yes Corporal I'd love to.

477
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:43,361
Oh hi. Hi.
Hi Ned.

478
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:44,833
Thought you were going to
join us.

479
00:40:45,203 --> 00:40:47,203
Ah I've been busy. You two
run along, have fun.

480
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:48,286
What are you up to?

481
00:40:48,585 --> 00:40:50,885
I'm trying to find out
how big this thing is.

482
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,240
You know, people used to think that
carnivorous plants were the funk.

483
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,340
Actually there are about 450
species of them.

484
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,892
Some are almost 6 feet tall.

485
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,340
I'm convinced that we're
dealing with a Mantis and...

486
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:13,404
whose geological world the smallest
insects were as large as man.

487
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,140
And, the failing to find those insects
for its food, it's...

488
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,100
Well it's, doing the best
it can.

489
00:41:20,636 --> 00:41:23,136
If there is such a thing why
hasn't anybody seen it?

490
00:41:23,323 --> 00:41:24,923
Well those who have are dead!

491
00:41:31,568 --> 00:41:32,468
Ah, who can be sure?

492
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:35,192
It may have been locked in a
prison of ice millions of years ago.

493
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,250
Well what could have released
it after all that time?

494
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:40,150
Oh, any sort of unusual vibration,

495
00:41:40,275 --> 00:41:42,575
You know how, mountain climbers
are afraid of thunder?

496
00:41:42,576 --> 00:41:45,576
Well, it's because the sound of the
vibration may start an avalanche.

497
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,920
Hit the alert button!
Yes sir!

498
00:42:11,874 --> 00:42:14,174
Operations! Colonel Parkman speaking...

499
00:42:14,674 --> 00:42:16,174
Condition Red! Scramble
all aircraft immediately!

500
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,199
Condition Red!

501
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:52,851
Coffee Colonel?

502
00:44:04,835 --> 00:44:06,635
Nine hours and not a whisper.

503
00:44:08,402 --> 00:44:10,302
Which is alright with me.

504
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,500
Red Eagle One, this is Otter 4

505
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,800
Hello Otter 4, this is
Red Eagle One, go ahead.

506
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,000
We have nothing here. Request
permission to return to base. Over.

507
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,500
Request denied, continue search
procedure. Over and out.

508
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,974
The only thing to do is
to keep the patrols out

509
00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:35,679
straight around the
clock until we're sure.

510
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,359
And remember, I want a report on
anything from Mid Canada, or Pine tree.

511
00:44:39,384 --> 00:44:40,724
Anything. You understand?

512
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,400
Yes sir.

513
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,400
Got the Mid Canada Radar Fence
on the line sir.

514
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:38,511
This is Colonel Parkman.

515
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:41,987
Oh Colonel, Blue Captain Hawkins, here.

516
00:45:42,216 --> 00:45:43,716
This is just a stab in the dark...

517
00:45:43,755 --> 00:45:46,655
but you chaps asked us to report
anything unusual and...

518
00:45:46,796 --> 00:45:47,596
yes...

519
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,610
As I said, it may not mean a thing,

520
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:53,310
but we caught an unidentified object
in our scope.

521
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,310
Could have been a storm
or a weather balloon.

522
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,910
It was a faint signal that
came a West.

523
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,310
But it might be that oversized
bug of yours?

524
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:01,810
What time was it?

525
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,710
Early. Zero four hundred
I suspect.

526
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,820
Thanks Hawkins.
Thanks very much.

527
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,220
Zero four hundred, that's almost six
hours after he left here.

528
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,720
Now it's 1500 miles to
the Mid Canada line.

529
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,420
Oh that's no good he'd have to
be doing better than 200 miles an hour.

530
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,520
Why not Joe?
We're dealing with an insect.

531
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,220
The deer fly does 600 an hour!

532
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,020
Well that's almost as fast
as a jet!

533
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,620
The Mid Canada line is 1500 miles
South of here, right?

534
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:31,520
Right.

535
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,330
And, where was that
Weather shack 4?

536
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,830
Right there, straight on
the eightieth meridian.

537
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,930
And the, and the C47
crash was here.

538
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,630
That's right, due South
of the Weather shack.

539
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,630
What are you getting at Ned?

540
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,730
And the Eskimo village?
Right there, between us and the C47.

541
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:45,930
Hey wait a minute.

542
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,930
He's been going straight South!

543
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,630
And he'll keep going South
till he reaches the tropics...

544
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,200
where he'll find the
same kind of climate

545
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:54,265
and jungle vegetation from
which he came originally.

546
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,340
Now let's see he'll probably
pass over...

547
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,240
Labrador, Nova Scotia, then
he'll hit the Gulf Stream.

548
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,420
And I'm sure the warm air above
the Gulf Stream will attract him

549
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:03,565
and he'll follow it all the
way down to South America.

550
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,240
I've got CONAD on the
hot line Colonel.

551
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,640
They say it's important.
Thanks.

552
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,440
This is Colonel Parkman.

553
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,640
Are you sure?

554
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,040
Thanks.

555
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,840
Pine Tree got it too.
It went through Newfoundland.

556
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,340
Well it looks like we're
on our way to Washington.

557
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,950
Come on Marge.
Grab your toothbrush.

558
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,950
"MANTIS REPORTED AT BANGOR"
"AIR FORCE ALERTED!"

559
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:33,750
"CURFEW ORDERED IN NEW ORLEANS!"
"Fear of Mantis Mounting"

560
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:38,350
"CONGRESSMAN CALLS MANTIS HOAX"
"DEMANDS INVESTIGATION"

561
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,550
All over the United States this morning...

562
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:44,150
Some 400,000 members, of the civilian
ground observer corp...

563
00:47:44,233 --> 00:47:47,233
are gathered to learn more about
this fantastic creature.

564
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:50,750
This program is being presented by the
Continental Air Defense Command.

565
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,450
Our first speaker is Major
General Mark Ford.

566
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,550
- General Ford.
Thank you.

567
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,160
I want to say at the outset...

568
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,460
That contrary to rumor, and certain
newspaper headlines,

569
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,260
the so called deadly Mantis is no
imaginary scare.

570
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,760
It's a very real and,
present danger.

571
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,160
With me this morning is
Colonel Parkman.

572
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,260
Commanding officer of an advanced radar
interceptor base deep in the Arctic Circle.

573
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,360
Colonel Parkman.

574
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,160
Thank you sir.

575
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,860
Ladies and Gentlemen...

576
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,560
I saw this creature attack our base.

577
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,793
I visited the weather shack,
and I also inspected the

578
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:30,294
wreckage of the aircraft
that this thing destroyed.

579
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,570
Now we have every reason to believe
that the Mantis is flying South...

580
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:35,170
Along the Gulf Stream.

581
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:38,270
And we believe that it will be one you
devoted men and women...

582
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:40,170
of the Civilian Ground
Observer Corp...

583
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,170
who will spot it next time it appears.

584
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,270
I have with me today
Dr. Nedrick Jackson...

585
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,970
Curator of the department of Paleontology
at the Museum of Natural History.

586
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:51,770
Dr. Jackson has something important
to show you.

587
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:53,270
Doctor.

588
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:54,970
Gentlemen.

589
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,170
Thank you.

590
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:05,892
This object, is a spur
broken off the fore

591
00:49:05,917 --> 00:49:08,394
leg of the Mantis when
it destroyed the C47.

592
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:12,670
Now the spur of a normal size Mantis
is so small it's difficult to measure.

593
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:16,170
This spur, as you can see,
is nearly 5 feet long...

594
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,070
which will give you some
idea as to the creature's size.

595
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,070
Thank you, doctor.

596
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:26,970
Now you ground observers are well
trained in the identification of aircraft.

597
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:32,080
Here, to scale, is
the deadly Mantis,

598
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,180
and here, is the C47,
which it destroyed.

599
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,580
One other thing.

600
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,524
You spotters should listen
for a loud droning sound,

601
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:48,004
much like that of a squadron of
heavy bombers flying in formation.

602
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,680
Now the Coast Guard and the Navy
have been alerted and are standing by...

603
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,980
On the Eastern seaboard.

604
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,980
If the Mantis is sited the procedure
will be the same as though...

605
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,980
an enemy aircraft
had been spotted.

606
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,280
Take no chances. Report any
unusual flying objects.

607
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
Thank you.

608
00:52:19,757 --> 00:52:21,757
Target is down!
Target is down!

609
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,843
Cannot confirm kill, due
to low overcast.

610
00:52:24,918 --> 00:52:26,418
Returning to Carrier.
Out.

611
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:57,290
Well, here comes another one.

612
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:04,090
Granary fire in Minneapolis.

613
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,390
Minneapolis not a stir.

614
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:09,190
There's some power lines
down near Richmond.

615
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,490
Richmond Virginia?
Yeah.

616
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:19,990
There's some birds flying in Fresno.
Fresno, Fresno...

617
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,190
Oh, I'm so tired.

618
00:53:24,224 --> 00:53:25,524
Where is Fresno?

619
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,640
California?

620
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,390
Fresno, California.

621
00:53:32,824 --> 00:53:34,324
Hi.
Hi Marge.

622
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,040
Hello. Ned.
Hey, what are you up to?

623
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,840
Well, it's kind of a private deal.

624
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,140
We call it operation Marge
because she dreamed it up. Oh?

625
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,940
We're charting every unusual
occurrence in the country.

626
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,040
Some may have been caused by the
Mantis. This might give us a clue.

627
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,050
Any luck? Well they're too
scattered to mean anything yet.

628
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,950
You kids know what time it is.
It's after midnight.

629
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:54,850
Now you're dismissed,
both of you... But General I have the...

630
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,450
No "buts" about it. You heard
what the General said.

631
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:59,950
Your going straight home
young lady.

632
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,050
And I'm the guy whose taking you.

633
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,850
Night Ned.
Goodnight Marge.

634
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,350
< We interrupt this program
to bring you a news flash >

635
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:30,550
< A train wreck has been reported north
of Laurel, Maryland, on U.S. highway one. >

636
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,637
< The Engine and 5
cars were overturned

637
00:54:32,662 --> 00:54:35,074
in what appears to have
been a freak accident. >

638
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,560
< We will bring you further details
as they come in. >

639
00:54:37,994 --> 00:54:39,494
It's only a few miles from here.

640
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,560
We'll have a look.

641
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,360
Sorry Colonel, been a train wreck.
You'll have to back to Warrington road.

642
00:55:00,757 --> 00:55:03,157
Take the detour to your left, to Laurel.

643
00:55:06,489 --> 00:55:08,489
Pretty bad?
Could have been a lot worse.

644
00:55:11,005 --> 00:55:12,005
How'd it happen?

645
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:14,041
Probably couldn't see the warning
in the fog.

646
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:16,518
Can't tell for sure. The
Engineer is still unconscious.

647
00:55:17,995 --> 00:55:19,495
Joe do you think it might...

648
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:22,970
No.

649
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:24,470
It's just an accident.

650
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:26,470
Come on. Let's go.

651
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:28,451
Gracias.

652
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:20,470
The light just turned green.

653
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,970
It's too dangerous to
drive in fog like this.

654
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:27,670
Remember what happened to
that train back there.

655
00:56:35,056 --> 00:56:38,056
M-m-m, this is more
dangerous.

656
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:39,770
We better get going.

657
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:00,670
Oh, you forgot your package lady!
Thank you driver.

658
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,620
You know, it's good to get home safely...

659
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,480
with all these strange things
going on around here.

660
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,580
Oh there's nothing to worry about 'mam.
You just be careful out in that fog.

661
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,680
Thank you.

662
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,280
< It's the very latest report! >

663
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,272
< An inter urban bus
was demolished at the

664
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:51,804
intersection of Forbin
Avenue and Arlington Road. >

665
00:57:52,442 --> 00:57:54,328
< The cause of the
accident, which occurred

666
00:57:54,353 --> 00:57:56,666
only 5 minutes ago is still
to be explained... >

667
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,724
<... since there was no other vehicle
involved. >

668
00:57:59,147 --> 00:58:01,147
< This accident, in
addition to the train wreck

669
00:58:01,172 --> 00:58:03,147
which was reported a very
short time before... >

670
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:07,080
<... makes a total of 7 accidents in
this area within the last 24 hours. >

671
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,459
Take it easy! How about a couple
of blankets up here.

672
00:58:22,483 --> 00:58:23,383
What happened?

673
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:27,190
Haven't got any idea Colonel. Something
must have lifted the bus and smashed it.

674
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,650
The front end's okay so
we know it didn't run into anything.

675
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,590
You boys might just as well go back.
There aren't any bodies!

676
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:34,850
Oh say, take care of this
lady for me, will you please.

677
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:43,890
Attention, all military and civil
defense personnel.

678
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:47,690
Attention, all police and fire
department personnel.

679
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:50,690
The Mantis has been
sighted over Washington!

680
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:54,890
I repeat. The Mantis has been sited
over Washington.

681
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,500
Let's go.

682
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,400
Excuse me, pardon...
This is a general alert!

I've got Baltimore, General.

693
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:14,310

Dropping fast.

701
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,122
It's still moving Northeast.

702
01:01:37,147 --> 01:01:39,134
You think you'll be able
to drive it out to sea?

703
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:40,210
I hope so.

704
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,220
Air Defense Warning Red!
Stand by to lock on.

705

717
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:03,729
What happened?
He dropped below the radar net.

718
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:05,130
Well does that mean you've lost it?

719
01:03:07,095 --> 01:03:08,895
One of the ground observers will
pick it up.

720
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:24,530
This is one nine hotel.

721
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:29,130
Bogey range...
Flying East. This is one nine hotel...

722
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:30,530
Thank you.

Vector one niner zero. bogey at 12 o'clock.
Steady on course, twenty miles, over.

726
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:52,830
That'll put it over
Newark in a few minutes.

727
01:04:13,339 --> 01:04:15,139
Archer, this is Beagle One Seven.

728
01:04:15,278 --> 01:04:18,178
When steady
on vector, bogey will be 12 o'clock.

729
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,930
Archer control, this is Beagle One Seven.

730
01:05:04,774 --> 01:05:08,874
We've splashed Mantis.
Give me pigeons to home plate.

731
01:05:53,642 --> 01:05:56,642
Hey Clark! They said on television that
the flyer who shot him down...

732
01:05:56,977 --> 01:05:58,777
is going in the tunnel
after him.

733
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:00,889
Did you see it crawl into
the tunnel?

734
01:06:01,475 --> 01:06:03,775
Hey bud!
Hey, hey bud! Bud! Hey!

735
01:06:07,188 --> 01:06:09,288
Hey bud,
is it still in the tunnel?

736
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,620
It ain't out here Mac!

737
01:06:11,493 --> 01:06:13,193
Anybody killed?

738
01:06:13,286 --> 01:06:15,186
I only know what I read
in the papers!

739
01:06:15,236 --> 01:06:18,236
Hey smart guy, I thought I told you
to stay out of that road, now come on...

740
01:06:18,381 --> 01:06:19,773
get back there! " I'm going
home and watch it on TV."

741
01:06:19,798 --> 01:06:20,905
Why go ahead home
and watch it on TV.

742
01:06:21,235 --> 01:06:23,635
Alright, don't push! " I'll
push..." I see anything anyway

743
01:06:24,006 --> 01:06:25,706
Yeah, tell it to your
neighbor will ya!

744
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,975
That's all the smoke we need.
Shut it off!

745
01:06:52,388 --> 01:06:53,788
How much longer do you
think it'll take?

746
01:06:53,797 --> 01:06:56,517
Well we got about a 90 percent
saturation of smoke in the tunnel now!

747
01:06:56,601 --> 01:06:58,321
I don't think we can
do any better, General.

748
01:06:58,385 --> 01:07:00,285
We'll be lucky if we can
hold what we've got.

749
01:07:00,378 --> 01:07:02,578
Those wet tarpaulins will hold
the smoke alright.

750
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,060
Just keep pumping!

751
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,320
Everything's under control
on the Jersey side sir.

752
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,260
What about the smoke?

753
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,360
It's packed in solid
the tarp's holding it fine.

754
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:34,060
Did you go inside?
Yes sir, but we didn't get too close.

755
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,060
How far in do you estimate it to be?

756
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,660
Oh I'd ah, I'd say, about
a quarter of a mile from this end.

757
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,860
That puts the Mantis
below the water line.

758
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,260
I don't think we ought
to wait much longer, sir.

759
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,160
What do you think Ned?

760
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,670
It's no question in my mind that
he's mortally wounded.

761
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:50,490
If we can keep him in that
tunnel he'll die!

762
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:52,670
Is there anything between us
and the Mantis on this end?

763
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:55,270
17 cars, according to
the automatic counter.

764
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:58,710
If he breaks through those tunnel
walls we'll have a flood on our hands.

765
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:01,670
What do you say, General?

766
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:07,870
Go ahead, Joe.

767
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:09,970
Good luck Joe.

768
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,370
Alright men.

769
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:19,050
You've all been told what to do.

770
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,180
Now the purpose of that smoke
in there is to give us cover.

771
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:26,080
Use it! Now which of you
men is carrying the chemical mines?

772
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,480
Stay up front with me!

773
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,280
And remember, those 3-R-G mines are
effective only in a limited area.

774
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:35,780
So watch for my signal
before you throw them.

775
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,580
Alright men, Take Masks!

776
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,380
Let's go!

777
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:38,056
There's your cover for next months
magazine, Marge.

778
01:15:45,243 --> 01:15:46,743
Well go on, take your picture.

779
01:15:49,348 --> 01:15:51,448
Would you mind telling me
what's so funny Colonel?

780
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:54,090
Who me?
Well nothing at all.

781
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:56,590
Can I help you with
the Camera? No thanks.

782
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:13,990
Exactly where did you
crash into him, Joe?

783
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:16,990
Well, just about center
of the right hand side.

784
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:18,690
If you follow me, I'll show you.

785
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,342
There. I think you can
see right there, sir.

786
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:46,014
It's at the uh,
base of the neck.

787
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:47,590
Ned what do you call...

788
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:52,990
Look out Marge!

789
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:04,810
I thought you said
you killed him?

790
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:08,390
Don't blame Joe, that was an
auto-reflex mechanism, it's dead alright.

791
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,000
Here, put me down.

792
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,400
I said, put me down!

794
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,100
I've got pictures to take!

795
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,300

797
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,000
What about my pictures?
