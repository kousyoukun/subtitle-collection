You still at the hospital?

我想他们是从太阳那边追来的。太快了，让斯科特反应不过来

I, erm...
我...

133
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,836
I only hope we can do as well, Quint.
只是希望我们能做得一样好，昆特

- 你现在是飞行队队长了？   -是的

Good. Mother and I will be proud of you.

How close do you wanna go?

Part their hair, Squadron Leader.

Noisy lot, weren't they?

141
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,475
That's a lot of flak for one chateau.
对一座城堡来说，这里太多高射炮了

142
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,598
They must have something they don't want seen.
他们一定有些不想被发现的东西

Which is a good reason for us to have to go in again.

How close do you wanna go this time?

It's gonna be a bumpy landing.

151

Major. Major!

152
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,755
- Kemble?    - He's in there.

Smash the cockpit. Smash the cockpit!

Let's hope those bloody pictures are worth it.

Away you go!
你开吧！

156
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,076
That's the squadron leader's ready room through there, ma'am.
女士，那是队长的休息室

157
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,156

对不起，但... 我只想看看这里

- 我忘了你会...   - 不，不...没关系

165

I, erm... I saw Scotty's batman on the way over.
我... 我在路上碰见斯科特的勤务员

to get one of those artificial hands fitted.

the place where he faced up to himself.
一个他真正面对自己的地方

- 他羡慕你，昆特   - 羡慕我？

Well, he had all the brains.

I cribbed off him all the way through school.

He told me all about that. And about the girls you passed on to him.
他都告诉我了，还有你传给他的女孩们

I put the rest of his things in here.

(knock at door)

How many miles does it do to the gallon?

Not many.

199
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,711

- 为何不把车卖了？   - 车会听到的

200
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,910

她是一只喜怒无常的婊子

201
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,271

对不起。那只是让词汇稍微变得粗糙的混乱生活

202
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,755
I know. It played havoc with Scotty's.

We'd even picked the names.

是的，不过别担心，我不会有事的

Well, I feel sort of embarrassed.

这是我们第一次真正单独在一起

斯科特在生时，我们都是家庭的一份子，可是现在

215
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,515
It doesn't feel right somehow.
不知何故地觉得不对劲

216
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,517
You feel guilty.

just two weeks after her first husband was killed.

I remember being absolutely shocked.

Time is so precious.

这都是关于一件事，他们不给我们定量的优惠

229
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,870

这是准将哈佛德，这是飞行队队长文路

- 是的，长官，是这样   - 肯布尔很优秀

Hold those a minute, Mason.

Now, what do you suppose that is?
你觉得那是什么？

237

- It looks like a tunnel, sir.   - Course it's a tunnel.
- 看上去像是隧道，长官    - 当然是隧道了

We know more about it than that.

What we want you to do, Munroe, is to chuck a bomb in there
文路，我们想要你做的，就是在那儿放置个炸弹

241
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,115
and addle their eggs for 'em.
并且完全地破坏他们的鸟蛋

242
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,230
In there?

至少要两个飞蚊飞行队去完成

现在你得为这特别任务，领导一个受特别训练的飞行队去完成

246
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,754
It's near impossible to put a bomb in there.
放置炸弹在那里面，这似乎不可能

247
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,792
Nonsense. Blinds down, Mason.

248
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,388
We'll run that film again.

This is top-secret film, Munroe.
文路，这是高度机密影片

What you're going to see is a development of Barnes Wallis.

251
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,753
The hydraulics start the bomb spinning.

this bomb bounces on land.
这种炸弹在地面弹起

- 直线地弹走吗？   - 是的，不受任何地形影响

255
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,838
It's beautiful. It's so beautiful, I've run this print a thousand times.
漂亮，太漂亮了，我们已经试了上千次

我想我们已看得够多了，梅森，谢谢你

你将要去那里。巴纳沃利丝，上帝保佑他，

260
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,834
has done your job for you, practically.

It'd take months to get that accurate.

文路，你认为怎样？成功率有多大？

不好了，贝丝还没告诉我护士的秘密

- 你俩是一对鲨鱼肉   - 别乱说了

When Doug bounces back he really bounces.

- 昆特！   - 工作进展怎样？

他反应慢，错失时机，由你决定吧

他在飞行中表现还好，可能是考试紧张吧

正如我说的，你做决定。但你们要做的是精密的工作

司令部知道敌人把我们放在什么位置

471
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,151

哈佛德说得对，这项任务要牺牲很多人命和机器

472
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,511
And there's the prisoners, the murder - oh, yes, that is the word -
还有那些战俘，应该这样说，是谋杀

Take a good look at those faces.

想想其他曾在这房间出现的脸孔，那些我和你最近见过的面孔。

你知道他们怎么了？飞行前紧张等待天气好转

493

闭嘴！安静，听话吧。那是这场战争的问题

Those who can see not telling these blind fools where they're falling. You daren't...
知道真相的人不告诉这群盲目的傻瓜，他们降落在哪里。你不敢告诉他们，是吗？

499
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,234
Get off me!

处境就是这样。你们应该都知道情况了。你们都知道了

508
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,594
And the directive remains: Charlon must be destroyed.
而命令是：必须摧毁沙尔龙堡

509
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,713
- But, sir, suppose...    - Templeton, do your job and I'll do mine.
- 长官，但是...   - 布列顿，做你的事，我做我的

510
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,628
Now, just look at this matter. If the work at Charlon continues,
现在看看这个问题，如果沙尔龙堡的工程继续下去的话

511
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,151
hundreds of thousands of people might die, all of southern England devastated,
成千上万的人就会死去，整个英国南部会被蹂躏，

512
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,670
our bridgehead in Europe destroyed, the invasion delayed months.
我们的欧洲根据地被破坏，我们的攻击会延迟数月

513
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,031
- Couldn't the paratroops go in?    - They'd be slaughtered.
- 不可以让伞兵加入攻打吗？   - 他们会被屠杀的

514
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,958
- The French underground?    - The Germans are on the alert.
- 那法国的地下游击队呢？   - 德国人正在警戒着

515
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,709
No, it must be a strike from the air.
不，一定是从空中攻击

516
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,432
There may be a way, sir. While we attack, we detach one aircraft to breach the wall,
或者有一个办法，当我们攻击隧道时，我们会分出一架飞机去破坏墙壁，

517
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,630
the French underground cross the breach,
法国的地下游击队穿过那缺口，

518
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,752
take on the Germans in the castle and help our chaps out.
和德国人在城堡内较量并救出战俘

519
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,916
- Just ahead of our bombing attack?    - Yes.
- 就在我们炮轰前？   - 对

520
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,589
- Then what?    - Well, then it's every man for himself.
- 然后呢？   - 然后各自逃跑

521
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,950
Scuttling out? Running in all directions?
逃跑？向四面八方跑？

522
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,277
At least this way they won't die under our own bombs.
这个方法起码他们不用死在我们炮轰之下

523
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,834
Yes. All right. I can see some sense in it.
对，我看得出这里面的道理

524
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,474
Then you get Headquarters to approve the plan.
那您让司令部批准这个计划吧

525
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,512
They'll need the cooperation of the French underground.
他们需要法国的地下游击队的合作

526
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,950
The underground couldn't mount an effort on this scale.
地下游击队不能承受这些任务

527
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:40,073
Even if they could, those prisoners who aren't killed when you blast open the wall
就算可以，当你炸墙时，那些未死的战俘

528
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,475
would be scattered throughout the castle,
会分散在整个城堡

529
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,479
locked up in dozens of cubbyholes and cellars.
被锁在幽闭的暗室和地下室

530
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,558
You'd need a force that could subdue the German garrison
你要有力量打败德国的防守部队

531
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,399
and stand off reinforcements from outside.
并抵住外面的援军

532
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,711
No. I applaud your motives but your scheme is impracticable.
不行，我赞赏你的想法，但你的计划不合实际

533
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,957
Giving men a chance for their lives is impracticable?
给别人生存的机会不合实际？

534
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,317
You have a particular emotional involvement with these prisoners.
你对这些战俘有特殊的感情困扰

535
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,911
Have you thought about the men on the ground you're asking to risk their lives?
你想过你派去地面冒险的人的性命吗？

536
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,749
Nothing must be attempted that would jeopardise the aim of the strike.
会危及主要攻击计划的都不能实行

537
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,711
Supposing...
如果...

538
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,670
Supposing, just before we blow the wall,
如果只是在我们炸毁那墙之前，

539
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,110
that the prisoners could be gathered together in one safe place.
那些战俘能集中在一个安全的地方

540
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,791
Couldn't the underground take them over and get them out on the escape route?
地下游击队不能接收他们然后帮助他们逃离出去吗？

541
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,759
Most of those that survive, I would say.
我认为这样的话，大部分的人会幸存下来

542
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,358
Then schedule the attack for Sunday morning.
那么安排在星期天早上进攻吧

543
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,708
Sunday morning?
星期天早上？

544
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,796
(Morse bleeps)
（摩斯密码）

545
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,757
Sunday morning. Of course. Of course.
星期天早上，当然，当然

546
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,158
- Mon pe, qu'est-ce que c'est?    - N'importe. Allez, dhez-vous.
- 神父，什么事？   - 无论什么事，走吧

547
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,756
- Morning.    - Morning, padre.
- 早上好    - 早上好，神父

548
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,276
Good day.
祝你开心，孩子

549
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,269
Morning, Father.
早上好，神父

550
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,675
Ah, Lieutenant Schack, bonjour.
斯加克中尉，你好

551
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,429
Bonjour, Father Bellague. The confessional is all ready for you.
早上好，贝拉格神父，已为你准备好忏悔室了

552
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,516
Thank you.
谢谢

553
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,319
Please remove your guards. I cannot ask these men
请你撤掉你的警卫，我不能叫这些人

554
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,670
to confess to God with a gun at their backs.
拿着枪在背后指吓时招供

555
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,872
Sorry, Father. The commandant's orders.
对不起，神父，这是司令部的命令

556
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,879
I think he suspects you give out more than absolution in the confessional.
我想他怀疑你会说和告解无关的话

557
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,833
Perhaps he'd prefer me to hear my confessions in the open,
或许他想我在室外聆听告解

558
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,190
where his entire garrison could watch?
好让所有的防备兵监视

559
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,276
As you please, Father.
神父，如果你喜欢也可以

560
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,354
Geben Sie mir einen Stuhl.
我到外面去

561
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,196
Tu, was er sagt.
先搬椅子出去

562
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,316
Here.
放这儿

563
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,028
- Give me your blessing, for I have sinned.    - Keep your lips moving and listen.
- 愿主保佑，我犯罪了    - 你继续说话，并且小心听着

564
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,832
I will not repeat this.
我不会重说

565
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,555
Tell all your men they are to be at Mass in chapel on Sunday morning.
告诉所有人，叫他们星期天早上去小礼拜堂做弥撒

566
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,638
Tell them that the order is from Air Command.
告诉他们命令是从空军司令部发出

567
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,877
Now, my son.
我的孩子，现在

568
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,117
For I have sinned. Through my fault.
我犯了罪，宽恕我的罪

569
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,117
Through my most grievous fault.
宽恕我最严重的错

570
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,196
(gives blessing)
（祝福）
                               
571
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,596
Go in peace and pray for me.
平静下来，为我们祈祷吧

572
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,674
Keep your lips moving, son, and listen carefully.
孩子，继续说话，并且小心听着

573
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,679
When all the men are in chapel tomorrow morning and the attack begins,
明早，当所有人在小礼拜堂内，轰炸开始时，

574
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,031
- they are trying to get you out.    - Thank God!
- 他们会试图救出你们    - 感谢天主

575
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,516
Gentlemen, this mission must be executed with exacting precision,
先生们，这任务必须非常精确才能实现

576
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,074
both in timing and accuracy.
在于时间的配合和进攻准确度

577
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,875
This tunnel... must be closed.
这条隧道...必须炸掉

578
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,312
Munroe, Clarke and Bannister will fly the first phase.
文路，克拉克和班尼斯特首先飞出

579
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,273
Each of their Mosquitoes will carry two highball bombs,
每架蚊式战斗机会带两枚炸弹

580
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,075
one of which is capable of destroying the entire underground facility.
每一架都能摧毁整个地下道

581
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,670
Munroe, as soon as one of you puts a bomb into the mouth of the tunnel,
文路，你们尽快地把炸弹投进隧道，

582
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,870
you may proceed to breach the wall.
因而你可以炸墙

583
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,355
The prisoners will be waiting in the chapel.
战俘们会在小礼拜堂等候

584
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,436
Once the wall is destroyed,
墙一倒下，

585
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,393
the French underground will start diversionary skirmishes
法国的地下游击队就会开始小战争来引开他们注意力

586
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,990
so that our men will have a chance to head for the woods to the west.
使我们的人有机会逃跑到西边的树林

587
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:47,511
Minutes later, waves of Mosquitoes will level Charlon.
几分钟后，蚊式飞机群将会摧毁沙尔龙堡

588
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,396
Any questions?
有什么问题吗？

589
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,350
Takeoff at 0625 hours tomorrow.
明天6点25分出发

590
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,356
Dismissed.
解散

591
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,790
Looks as though it's going to be pretty sloppy over Charlon.
沙尔龙堡上空看上去好像多云

592
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,673
Damned rain could ruin what little chances we did have.
讨厌的雨会毁坏我们的良机

593
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,075
Rain or no rain, we go tomorrow.
不管有没有雨，我们明天都要出发

594
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,795
Did Intelligence tell us how to get a decent bounce off this muck?
情报部门告诉我们怎样避开这些讨厌的东西吗？

595
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,435
Yeah. Just before you shoot, you use my guaranteed equaliser.
对，在你射击前，用我的平衡器

596
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,278
What's that?
那是什么？

597
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,631
Just before you shoot, you spit on your firing thumb.
在你射击前，吐口水在拇指上

598
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,349
What's so hilarious, chum?
有什么好笑的？

599
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,040
I've been a bit worried about him recently.
我最近有点担心他

600
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,948
- He was getting serious about his job.    - Is that so bad?
- 他对他的工作更认真   - 那很糟糕吗？

601
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:49,197
When a man like Quint Munroe gets serious, he gets cautious.
当像昆特文路这样的人认真时，他就会小心谨慎

602
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,880
- That's when his luck deserts him.    - And us?
- 那就是好运抛弃他的时候   - 我们呢？

603
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,514
And us.
我们也是

604
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,790
Hey!
嘿！

605
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,913
- They won't let me see Douglas.    - I thought you knew that already.
- 他们不准我见道格拉斯   - 我想你已知道了

606
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,593
I thought if I came here to the base, I...
我想如果我从基地来这里，我...

607
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,589
I had to see you, Quint.
我一定要见你，昆特

608
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,719
Well, I... I can't stay long.
我...我不能久留

609
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:34,036
Can't you tell me why he's confined to his quarters? Why I can't speak to him?
你能不能告诉我他为什么被软禁在房内？我为何不能和他说话？

610
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,278
- Insubordination.    - That's not true. To whom?
- 他违抗命令   - 那不是真的，违抗谁？

611
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,556
The wing commander.
违抗空军司令部

612
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,078
I... I shouldn't have come here.
我真不该来这里

613
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,514
When will I see you again?
我什么时候可以再见到你?

614
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,276
Tomorrow.
明天

615
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,476
With luck?
祝你好运

616
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:20,354
Come back, Quint. I couldn't bear it if you didn't.
昆特，你要回来。你不回来的话我不能承受

617
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,633
Stand easy, please.
请稍息

618
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,150
Don't worry, I'm going to spare you my usual tedious pep talk.
别担心，我这次不会象往常那样说闷话了

619
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,874
You know the importance of your mission.
通知你们了，你们知道任务的重要性

620
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,198
Just remember that our bomber wave will start their drop at precisely 1000 hours,
只要记住我们的轰炸机攻势会在精确的1000分钟内开始投弹，

621
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,472
regardless of whether or not all our prisoners are out of Charlon.
不管是否所有战俘都逃出沙尔龙堡

622
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:00,799
So any delay in dealing with the targets assigned to you could be very costly.
在处理命令要求击中的目标中，如果有延误的话，会有极大伤亡

623
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:05,516
That's all I wanted to say, except to wish each of you good luck.
祝你们好运，我的话讲完了

624
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,675
(horn honks)
(汽车的喇叭声)

625
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,359
'Shun!
立正！

626
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,436
Good morning, gentlemen.
早上好，各位

627
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,556
Stand easy.
稍息

628
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:24,559
I'm told the weather over Charlon will be ideal for our purposes today.
我被告知，沙尔龙堡上空的天气很适合我们的计划

629
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,989
- Everyone feeling well?    - Yes, thank you, sir.
- 大家的身体好吗？   - 好，谢谢，长官

630
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:31,557
- Perhaps you'd better break this news.    - As you wish, Wing Commander.
- 或许你可以通告这个消息    - 可以的，空军司令

631
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,717
It's from the air marshal. A slight change in your orders.
来自空军执行官的话，你们的命令有些改变

632
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:40,517
You are not to attack the prison wall until you have successfully sealed that tunnel.
你们要在成功切断隧道后，才能炸毁狱墙

633
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,789
What if it takes all six highballs to do the job?
要是用完了6枚炸弹才完成任务怎么办？

634
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,309
Then, regrettably, the escape plan is aborted.
那很遗憾，救人计划就会被取消

635
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,910
- The underground was told to withdraw.   - Our chaps will be blown to hell.
- 地下队员会被通知撤退   - 我们的伙伴会被炸死？

636
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,476
The tunnel has first priority. The escape plan is a bonus operation.
隧道是要优先处理的，救人计划是额外的行动

637
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,990
It made sense with a highball for the prison, but this is obscene!
炸弹对战俘们来说很重要，但这很讨厌！

638
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:03,274
That's enough! There will be no deviation from the air marshal's orders.
够了！空军执行官的命令是不会有错的

639
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,550
Is that clear, Squadron Leader Munroe?
明白吗，文路空军队长？

640
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,511
Sir.
是，长官

641
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:12,075
I'm sure you'll have several highballs to spare for that wall, Munroe.
文路，我肯定你们会留有炸弹去炸那墙

642
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,510
- I feel confident of that.    - I'm glad you do, sir.
- 我对这有信心    - 长官，我为此感到高兴

643
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,436
Carry on, Wing Commander.
继续吧，长官

644
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,116
All right.
行了

645
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,514
- You know the trouble with this war, sir?    - What?
- 长官，你知道这战争的麻烦吗？   - 什么？

646
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,074
The world's back to front.
世界就在前面

647
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,634
- Back to front?    - Yeah.
- 就在前面？   - 是

648
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,910
We go out and the sun's rising in our face.
太阳升起的时候我们出发

649
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,838
We come home and it's setting in our face.

650
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,916
Yeah. The world's back to front.
对，世界就在前面

651
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,118
- I bet the Luftwaffe doesn't think so.    - Ah!
- 我想德国空军不这样认为，维利   - 是！

652
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:06,313
They had years preparing for this rotten war. We just got it handed to us.
他们准备这场残忍的战争好几年了。我们要得到赞扬

653
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,596
(church bell tolls)
(教堂的钟声)

654
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,555
Suddenly, Father, everyone is very religious.
神父，很突然，所有人都很虔诚

655
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,636
You!
你！

656
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:09,396
He can't even remember his name. How does he know he's a Catholic?
他甚至不记得自己的名字。他怎知自己是天主教徒？

657
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,714
The Spirit moves in mysterious ways, Lieutenant Schack.
斯加克中尉，灵魂以其神奇的形式支配思想

658
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,751
Go.
走吧

659
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,952
The commandant is not so difficult to understand.
要了解司令官并不是那么难

660
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:29,114
The commandant dislikes mysterious occurrences.
司令官不喜欢神秘运作的事情

661
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,196
Take care, Priest.
神父，小心

662
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,837

You, erm... You do not know your name?

664
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,834
No, Father.
神父，不记得

665
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,872
Please, take your seat, my son.
请就坐，我的孩子

666
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,508
If anything ever puts me off religion, this will.
这会使我从此信教的

667
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,756
- What's happening?    - Escape.
- 发生什么事了？   - 逃跑

668
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,633
- Who says so?    - I do. The old priest's up to something.
- 谁说的？   - 我说的，老神父就是为这而来

669
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,230
That's right. He's gonna sneak us out under his robes.
对，他将要用长袍把我们偷走

670
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,193

672
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,035
Now what?
怎么了？

673
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,197
- She lost the ration books again    - we're starving to death!
- 她又丢了粮簿    - 我们要饿死了

674
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,709
Still, she makes up for it in other ways.
但她从另一方面补偿了

675
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,836
(priest administers Mass)

676

Five minutes to target.

You're a senior officer here.

Order your men to march outside at once... please!

Stay where you are, men. That's an order.
