1
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,616
Alles bereit.

2
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,535
Rampe räumen.

3
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,413
(tannoy) Achtung! Beistehen zum Feuern.

4
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,768
Achtung!

5
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,049
Zündung.

6
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,977
Beistehen.

7
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,215
Motor starten.

8
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,296
Fire three.

9
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,729
(air-raid siren)

10
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,936
Hurry up.

11
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,219
- Did you bring your driving licence?
- What for?

12
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,128
If you fly this thing any lower,
you're gonna need it.

13
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,819
Hunt Master to Hounds.
Level at angels six.

14
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,090
- Roger.
- Roger.

15
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,530
Target at ten o'clock, sir.

16
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,657
I see it, Tommy.

17
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,659
Look at those bastards.
Three V-1s ready to take off.

18
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,294
Enough to flatten
another square mile of London.

19
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,934
We're not stopping
enough of them, are we, sir?

20
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,496
No, we're just thinning them
out a little, Wiley.

21
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,134
Hunt Master to Hounds. Target identified.

22
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,416
(radio) Attack intervals of 15 seconds.

23
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,656
Bombs away, 1,000 feet.

24
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,176
Here we go!

25
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,892
Stand by!

26
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,896
Bombs away, sir.

27
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,170
(gunfire)

28
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,770
Stand by with the fly swatter, Wiley.

29
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,458
Sir.

30
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,136
Bombs away!

31
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,818
Bombs away!

32
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,776
Bombs away!

33
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,099
Hunt Master to Hounds. Let's go home.

34
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,053
- Roger, Scotty.
- Roger, Scotty.

35
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,776
Bandits! Bandits! Seven o'clock.

36
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,817
Hunt Master to Hounds.
Break. Break. Break.

37
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,175
Bannister! Clarke! Get that bastard
off Scotty. My fire control's jammed.

38
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,175
He's copped it, Quint.

39
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,095
(Bannister) Quint, let's get out of here.

40
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,896
Quint, they're climbing
for another pass at us.

41
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,452
(Clarke) Dog One,
you're leader now, Quint.

42
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,450
Dog One? Do you read me, Dog One?

43
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,776
Sir, they're calling you!

44
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,896
Are you all right, sir?

45
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,295
Dog One to Hounds. Follow me.
We're going out low and fast.

46
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,810
Stand easy. The strike report you
radioed ahead was relayed to Command.

47
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,330
You'll be pleased with the signal
I received from the air marshal.

48
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,610
''Please convey my personal regards

49
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,450
to flying officers and men
of 641 Squadron. Well done.''

50
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,655
We didn't even make a dent.

51
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,329
Their launching sites are hard to detect
until they go into operation,

52
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:59,329
but I assure you that Command is giving
the V-1 problem the highest priority.

53
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,170
Yes, sir.

54
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,972
Well, that's all.

55
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,777
I'm sorry about Squadron Leader Scott.
What happened?

56
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,176
A flight of Messerschmitts jumped us.

57
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,815
He was hit before he could manoeuvre.
Went down in flames.

58
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,613
- No parachutes?
- No, sir.

59
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,937
What does one say?
You were close, weren't you?

60
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,815
- We were brought up together.
- Really? Were there family connections?

61
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,137
No. My mother and father
were killed some time ago.

62
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,696
I've always thought of Squadron Leader
Scott's parents as my own.

63
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,936
I see.

64
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,779
Well, I suppose I'd better go and tell them.

65
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,973
It's a hateful business.
I can never find the words.

66
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,056
What about his wife?

67
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,016
Would you? I... I... I...

68
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,296
All right.

69
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,536
Hello, Quint.

70
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,296
Hi, Quint.

71
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,696
Hello, Quint.

72
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,096
What did you say to my sister?

73
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,976
I didn't have to say anything.

74
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,456
Scotty?

75
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,730
You still at the hospital?

76
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,250
Yes, convalescent. I brought this
crowd over. I wish to God I hadn't.

77
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,850
- When do you return to duty?
- Duty? What duty?

78
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,770
- Flying a desk one-handed.
- If that's all you think you can handle.

79
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,936
They've offered me a hook.

80
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,494
Makes a marvellous backscratcher,
so I'm told.

81
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,418
I'm sure Scotty
would settle for it right now.

82
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,136
He's dead.

83
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,249
Did you see it?

84
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,974
Yes.

85
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,056
No parachute?

86
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,974
There wasn't time.

87
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,056
Did...

88
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,654
Did it burn?

89
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,816
It blew up when it hit the ground.

90
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,456
- Beth...
- Leave me alone.

91
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,850
Please.

92
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,696
How did she take it?

93
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,053
- Do you think I should go to her?
- No, I don't. Just let her cry.

94
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,974
You're a hard-nosed bastard, Quint.

95
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,455
Scotty was practically your brother.

96
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,169
That's right, Douglas.

97
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,211
Scotty was practically my brother.

98
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,219
Ah, Munroe.
Meet Major Kemble, Military Intelligence.

99
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,291
The major's got a little job.
I thought you were the man for it.

100
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,217
- How do you do?
- Sir.

101
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,376
Nothing very exciting, I'm afraid.

102
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,377
Milk run, really.

103
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,253
I want to go over,
take a look at this place.

104
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,850
- Chateau de Charlon.
- (Quint) Very pretty.

105
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,656
Yes. What we're interested in is the, er...

106
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,736
underskirts.

107
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,610
- You've been briefed on the V-2 rockets?
- Yes, sir.

108
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,050
Intelligence has it that
there's a V-3, even a V-4, in development.

109
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,331
Larger, more punch.
More important: longer range.

110
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,532
We think the development work
is done at Chateau de Charlon.

111
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,616
That's why I want to take a look.

112
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,015
The Major will be flying with you.

113
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,813
I understood.
I had a few hours off base, sir.

114
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,172
The weather's closed in over France. We
have to fit the cameras to your aircraft.

115
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,530
- 24 hours enough for you?
- Yes, sir.

116
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,050
I'm going to see my...
Squadron Leader Scott's parents.

117
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,734
- What time is it?
- Half past four.

118
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,740
They'll just be having tea on the terrace.

119
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,416
Come on.

120
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,098
- (woman sobs)
- Walk with me, Quint, will you?

121
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,093
(Quint) We were pulling out -
you know, ready to go home -

122
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,529
when a flight
of Messerschmitts jumped us.

123
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,335
They came out of the sun. It was so quick
Scotty had no time to manoeuvre.

124
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,497
He just appeared to go
straight down into the ground.

125
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,975
He had no time, no time at all, to pull out.

126
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,660
I'm sure that, er, it was instantaneous.

127
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,858
When your parents died
and you came to live with us,

128
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,337
Mother and I always admired your spirit,
the way you handled your grief...

129
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,772
and went on with your life.

130
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,937
That's what they would
have wanted me to do.

131
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,096
I, erm...

132
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,336
I only hope we can do as well, Quint.

133
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,012
- You'll be leading the squadron now.
- Yes.

134
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,177
Good. Mother and I will be proud of you.

135
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,500
There's Charlon.

136
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,734
How close do you wanna go?

137
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,010
Part their hair, Squadron Leader.

138
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,255
(plane approaches)

139
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,656
Noisy lot, weren't they?

140
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,975
That's a lot of flak for one chateau.

141
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,098
They must have something
they don't want seen.

142
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,734
Which is a good reason
for us to have to go in again.

143
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,616
How close do you wanna go this time?

144
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,536
Knock their bloody heads off.

145
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,170
Have you had enough yet?

146
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,180
- You OK, Major?
- Let's go home.

147
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,972
(engine splutters)

148
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,696
More trouble, I'm afraid.
I think they've got the hydraulics.

149
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,254
It's gonna be a bumpy landing.

150
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,456
Major. Major!

151
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,255
- Kemble?
- He's in there.

152
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,178
Smash the cockpit. Smash the cockpit!

153
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,498
Let's hope those bloody pictures
are worth it.

154
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,096
Away you go!

155
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,576
That's the squadron leader's
ready room through there, ma'am.

156
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,656
I'll... I'll wait outside.

157
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,696
Thank you.

158
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,696
(chair scrapes)

159
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,216
Oh, it's you.

160
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,889
I... I came for Scotty's things.

161
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,098
I was gonna bring them over.

162
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,337
I'm sorry but...
I just wanted to see this place.

163
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,532
- I forgot that you would...
- No, no, that's... that's all right.

164
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,212
I, erm...
I saw Scotty's batman on the way over.

165
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,779
He was going
to fetch a uniform of Scotty's.

166
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,816
It was at the cleaner's.

167
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,654
- How's Douglas?
- He's gone back to the hospital,

168
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,294
to get one of those artificial hands fitted.

169
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,934
He said you convinced him.

170
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,016
- I did?
- You jolted him, Quint.

171
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,290
- Oh!
- That's what he needed.

172
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,656
You look tired.

173
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,696
Have you been flying?

174
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,812
Yes, just routine.
It was a milk run, really.

175
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,091
I should have known better.
You're resting. I'll come back...

176
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,657
No, no, that's all right. There's, er,
there's some more stuff in there.

177
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,858
Scotty called this room his confessional -

178
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,414
the place where he faced up to himself.

179
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,578
- He envied you, Quint.
- He envied me?

180
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,736
Well, he had all the brains.

181
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,494
I cribbed off him
all the way through school.

182
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,693
He told me all about that. And about
the girls you passed on to him.

183
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,017
I didn't pass, exactly. He took them.

184
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,896
Me too?

185
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,935
I put the rest of his things in here.

186
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,096
Oh, sorry.

187
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,010
No, no. That's mine.

188
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,210
Burned?

189
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,296
Oh, no, Quint. Not you too.

190
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,739
(knock at door)

191
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,169
- Yes?
- Vesey, sir.

192
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,530
Oh, er...

193
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,855
Yes, Vesey. Come in.

194
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,614
The squadron leader's uniform, sir.
Mrs Scott asked me to...

195
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,575
I'll get dressed and... and drive you home.

196
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,255
How many miles does it do to the gallon?

197
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,935
Not many.

198
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,211
- Why don't you sell it?
- Shh. She'll hear you.

199
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,410
She's a temperamental old bitch as it is.

200
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,771
I'm sorry. Mess life coarsens
the vocabulary somewhat.

201
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,255
I know. It played havoc with Scotty's.

202
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,736
You know what I regret most?

203
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,698
Not knowing what sort
of father he'd have made.

204
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,259
I'd love to have seen him
with his children.

205
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,496
We'd even picked the names.

206
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,496
If there's anything you need or want,
you will call me, won't you?

207
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,418
Yes. But don't worry, I'll be all right.

208
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,735
And you don't have to be so formal.

209
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,616
I'm sorry.

210
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,734
It's just that I...

211
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,896
Well, I feel sort of embarrassed.

212
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,335
It's the first time
we've ever really been alone together.

213
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,612
When Scotty was with us, we were
all part of the same family. Now it...

214
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,015
It doesn't feel right somehow.

215
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,017
You feel guilty.

216
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,654
Oh, Quint! That's very revealing.

217
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,175
Yes, it is, isn't it? I'm sorry.

218
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,689
Don't keep apologising. I understand.

219
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,930
- You do?
- Yes.

220
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,894
The day Scotty joined the squadron
his old navigator married a girl,

221
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,773
just two weeks
after her first husband was killed.

222
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,496
He was a pilot.

223
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,134
I remember being absolutely shocked.

224
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,490
Four days after the wedding,
he got shot down.

225
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,454
Then I understood.

226
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,536
Time is so precious.

227
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,173
It's about the only thing
they don't give us ration coupons for.

228
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,370
Air Commodore Hufford,
this is Squadron Leader Munroe...

229
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,253
You flew Kemble over Charlon,
didn't you, Munroe?

230
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,099
- Yes, sir. That's correct.
- Good man, was Kemble.

231
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,257
He'd have been decorated
for the results he got - excellent.

232
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,655
Come and have a look at this.

233
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,135
We made this model
from Kemble's photographs.

234
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,057
Hold those a minute, Mason.

235
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,694
Now, what do you suppose that is?

236
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,893
- It looks like a tunnel, sir.
- Course it's a tunnel.

237
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,056
We know more about it than that.

238
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,889
Down there, that's where
they're hatching their new bird.

239
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,296
What we want you to do, Munroe,
is to chuck a bomb in there

240
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,615
and addle their eggs for 'em.

241
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,730
In there?

242
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,250
Command plans a low-level
saturation-bombing mission

243
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,894
by at least two squadrons of Mosquitoes.

244
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,616
Now, you'd lead a specially trained
flight for this specialist task.

245
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,254
It's near impossible
to put a bomb in there.

246
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,292
Nonsense. Blinds down, Mason.

247
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,888
We'll run that film again.

248
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,816
This is top-secret film, Munroe.

249
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,376
What you're going to see is
a development of Barnes Wallis.

250
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,253
The hydraulics start the bomb spinning.

251
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,336
But here's the joker:

252
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,815
this bomb bounces on land.

253
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,698
- In a straight line?
- Yes. Regardless of terrain.

254
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,338
It's beautiful. It's so beautiful,
I've run this print a thousand times.

255
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,689
The civilian scientists have ironed
most of the wrinkles out for you.

256
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,654
Your job will be to perfect
the technique under combat conditions.

257
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,255
Well, I think we've seen enough.
Thank you, Mason.

258
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,769
There you are.
Barnes Wallis, God bless him,

259
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,334
has done your job for you, practically.

260
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,928
Your bombs would have a time fuse.

261
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,290
If you went in at exactly 60 feet...

262
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,411
S...?

263
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,735
It'd take months to get that accurate.

264
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,933
You have ten days to practise.
And I'll tell you why just ten days.

265
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,939
The French underground reports
the first of the Germans' new weapons

266
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,698
will be ready in 12 days.

267
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,573
You'll have special bombsights
and dummy bombs.

268
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,134
Building a replica
of the Charlon tunnel now.

269
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,854
Any justice in the world,
you'll be a national hero.

270
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,768
What do you say, Munroe? Hm?
What are the odds?

271
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,098
The same as spitting in an air
commodore's eye from an express train.

272
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,337
I like that. Yes, I do like that.
Sense of humour.

273
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,293
He'll do nicely, Wing Commander.
Just the man.

274
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,537
Now, get your team together and practise.

275
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,255
Stop that rocket flying
and you'll take years off the war.

276
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,940
Remember that. Years.

277
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,019
You've got ten days
to chuck your bomb down that tunnel.

278
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,096
All right.

279
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,053
Air scoop out.

280
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,016
Air scoop out, sir.

281
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,739
- RPM?
- 800.

282
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,253
Stand by.

283
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,859
Steady.

284
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,694
Steady.

285
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,656
Bomb away.

286
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,858
Missed.

287
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,171
(Quint) Bannister, change
your angle of approach. 60 feet.

288
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,292
- Drop from 60 feet, Bannister.
- Roger.

289
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,257
Stand by. Steady...

290
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,656
Bomb away!

291
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,375
Bomb away!

292
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,971
That's wide. Too wide.
Correct your angle of attack.

293
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,179
I thought I was right
on the money, skipper.

294
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,580
Steady.

295
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,376
Bomb away!

296
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,738
- What was your range that time?
- 1100, right on 60 feet.

297
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,771
I'm gonna try the same numbers.

298
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,496
Bomb away.

299
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,336
Missed.

300
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,651
Ah, Squadron Leader.
My congratulations, sir.

301
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,375
Your usual table, sir.
This way, if you please.

302
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,129
We haven't seen you all in so long,
I thought you'd found another place.

303
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,173
- With better market contacts than ours.
- That's not possible and you know it.

304
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,293
We try to do our best, sir.
Especially for our service clientele.

305
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,139
Is Squadron Leader Scott joining you?

306
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,216
No.

307
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,258
- What's not on the menu tonight, Victor?
- Chicken.

308
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,257
- Roasted?
- To perfection.

309
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,019
- Then chicken it is.
- Thank you. Thank you.

310
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,855
Scotty never did like chicken anyway.

311
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,177
I think the waiter thinks
we're having an affair.

312
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,932
Are you ever afraid?

313
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,496
Scotty used to be sick
with fear before every flight.

314
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,930
- Did you know that?
- Yes.

315
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,250
Funny thing, though.
When you're flying, you're free.

316
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,575
You're trained
to handle every emergency.

317
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,056
You're prepared for each eventuality.

318
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,216
It's a pattern that you can react to.

319
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,136
Down here the confusion starts.

320
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,014
Aha! Avast there, ye landlubbers!
Ye'll walk the plank for this.

321
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,973
- What do you think? Bit clumsy at first.
- You'll adjust.

322
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,375
I have. I'm reporting for duty tomorrow.

323
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,650
- Where?
- Quint's group. In charge of Link training.

324
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,295
- That's good news. When did you apply?
- Dear boy, they asked for me.

325
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,536
- ''Lend a hand'' I think the phrase was.
- Doug!

326
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,616
- Oh, I forgot. Susan.
- Hello.

327
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,096
She's a nurse. She likes the ironmongery.
She's got an itchy back.

328
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,734
- Doug, stop it!
- Would you, er, care to join us?

329
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,091
No, I'm not having Beth
tell the secrets of the nursery.

330
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,098
Besides, we'll ruin your evening.
Well, cheerio.

331
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,053
- Shark meat, the pair of you.
- Oh, Doug!

332
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,013
When Doug bounces back
he really bounces.

333
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,296
You suggested him for that job.

334
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,174
- Well, I sort of...
- I'm very grateful, Quint... for so much.

335
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,496
Food!

336
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,330
Mm! Looks delicious!

337
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,215
- That's enough rough air. Bring him in.
- Locks in, please.

338
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,255
Do you feel godlike
controlling the weather?

339
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,575
- Quint!
- How's the job going?

340
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,100
Apart from being rated next to the dentist
on the fliers' pet-hate list, OK.

341
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,815
- Tests and reaction tests on your men.
- What's this about Templeton?

342
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,091
Reactions slow and ill-timed.
Borderline. Your decision.

343
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,893
He seems all right in the air.
Maybe it's exam nerves.

344
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,013
Well, as I said, your decision.
But you are doing a precision job.

345
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,258
- You'd do him a favour if he could rest.
- I wonder how much of a favour it'd be.

346
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,258
- Oh, put him through again.
- Right.

347
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,814
- How's Susan?
- We're getting engaged.

348
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,693
- Why the rush?
- No rush. I've got time now.

349
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,415
- Time?
- My ticket. With luck I'll survive the war.

350
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,010
Fliers should never marry.
You saw what it did to Beth when Scott...

351
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,131
I'm sorry.

352
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,013
That's all right. I... I agree with you.

353
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,976
Yes?

354
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,494
Well, what I thought we should...
Thank you.

355
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,895
I thought we should get
a bottle of champagne,

356
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,409
and make a foursome -
you and Beth, me and Susan.

357
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,496
Sounds a good idea.

358
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,730
Erm, Quint.

359
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,809
I'm being delicately reminded there is one
member of our flight not yet checked out.

360
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,896
- Who's that?
- You.

361
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,649
No, you're way overdue.
When shall I write you in for?

362
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,169
As soon as you want
to get stood up. See you.

363
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,096
Stand by.

364
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,577
Steady.

365
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,090
Bomb away!

366
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,494
Bull's-eye. Good shot.

367
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,771
- Their average is one hit in ten, sir.
- We only need one hit.

368
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,051
Three planes can only carry
six highballs, sir.

369
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,489
Flight Lieutenant Mason
is still pessimistic,

370
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,975
but I say your chaps
will continue to improve.

371
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,056
Correct, Wing Commander?

372
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,613
Ohh!

373
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,696
Beth!

374
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,576
I'm all right.

375
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,970
Friends?

376
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,491
- Good luck.
- And blessings.

377
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,012
Come on. Kiss her.

378
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,613
- Quint, it's a public place.
- No, come on. She's your fiancée now.

379
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,291
That's the idea of this stuff. It's supposed
to fizz away your inhibitions.

380
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,488
Get away! That's enough.
I'd say you two have been practising.

381
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,612
Stop it, Quint.
You're making Susan blush.

382
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,129
- Is he always like this?
- Yes, he is.

383
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,333
We're gonna leave you two the bottle.
I never did believe in long engagements.

384
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,258
- Susan, I've had enough.
- She's hinting at something.

385
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,099
- I promised to get you home by midnight.
- Midnight?

386
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,610
Yes. All flyboys in their kips by 12.

387
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,810
Have fun, you two.

388
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,735
<i>(soldiers) I belong to Glasgow</i>

389
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,455
<i>Dear old Glasgow town</i>

390
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,493
<i>But there's something
the matter with Glasgow</i>

391
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,295
<i>Cos it's going round and round</i>

392
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,254
<i>I'm only a common old working chap</i>

393
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,417
<i>As anyone here can see</i>

394
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:14,738
<i>But when I get a couple
of drinks on a Saturday</i>

395
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:21,459
<i>Glasgow belongs to me</i>

396
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:26,176
The only way Charlon can be levelled and
the underground laboratory penetrated

397
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,053
is by extremely accurate
saturation bombing.

398
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,933
Squadron Leader Munroe,
with Bannister and Clarke,

399
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,972
will take off with highball bombs
to destroy the tunnel.

400
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,332
The second wave, consisting
of 636, 579 and 663 squadrons,

401
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:45,410
will follow exactly ten minutes later to hit
Charlon at low level - below 500 feet.

402
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:51,491
Now, I realise... I realise that dropping
from that level can be sticky,

403
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,855
but that is our assignment.

404
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,569
Air Commodore Hufford
has a word to say to you.

405
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,692
And it's a bad one.
Jerry knows you're coming.

406
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:06,098
A key Resistance man was picked up by
the Gestapo. We must assume he talked.

407
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,654
The Germans will
increase their defences.

408
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,419
With every passing day, they'll get hotter.

409
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,657
That makes it imperative
you get in there as soon as possible

410
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,455
and make the destruction
of Charlon as total as you can.

411
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,572
Well, that's all.
I know you're the men that'll do it.

412
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,930
Good luck to you all.

413
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,016
'Shun!

414
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,411
Ground's as hard as a billiard table.

415
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,656
You have reservations about our mission?

416
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,216
No, sir. I don't think
we stand a loving chance.

417
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,856
Air raid!

418
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,770
(gunfire)

419
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,816
Look out, Quint!

420
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,170
It's a roll of film!

421
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,855
My God! Those are RAF prisoners.

422
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,053
That's Webb - Alan Webb.
He was my wing man.

423
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:02,776
- There's Crawford and Greenwood and...
- They're all RAF aircrews.

424
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,296
That's Scotty!

425
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,851
- What the hell are they playing at?
- That's perfectly obvious.

426
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,813
Switch that damn thing off.
I've seen quite enough.

427
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,333
There you see the crude subtlety of
the Nazi mind, gentlemen, well illustrated.

428
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,054
- But what can they hope to gain?
- Two things.

429
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,330
Lowered morale amongst our aircrews

430
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,897
and a propaganda opportunity - the Royal
Air Force bombing their own men.

431
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,580
Headline: The Fratricidal RAF.

432
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,659
- It's monstrous!
- Penrose, there is one gift in all this.

433
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,659
This infantile stratagem confirms
our own supposition about Charlon.

434
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,773
We know now Charlon
is vital to the Nazi machine.

435
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,289
Charlon must be destroyed!

436
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,376
We'd be murdering our own men!

437
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:11,089
Not a word of what we've seen
must go outside this room.

438
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,053
Under no circumstances, to anybody.

439
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,536
What a hell of a mess.

440
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,697
Quint. We've got to tell Beth
that Scotty's alive.

441
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,850
Do you think that would be a kindness?

442
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,369
Quint, he's alive. You've got to tell her!

443
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,458
I know he's alive!
What do you want me to tell her?

444
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:59,209
That he's in Charlon?
My next mission is to bomb Charlon.

445
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,570
Who's gonna tell her
that Scotty died twice?

446
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,930
They won't go through
with the strike now.

447
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,016
You're a romantic, Douglas.

448
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,016
Command isn't.

449
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,779
What a hell of a... rotten mess.

450
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,856
Now you're repeating yourself.

451
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,489
Poor Beth.

452
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,575
(Beth) Quint!

453
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,536
Quint!

454
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,696
Quint?

455
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,336
What's the matter?

456
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,215
It's so peaceful here.

457
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,575
But you've brought the war with you.

458
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,695
It's this next flight, isn't it?

459
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,575
I know the signs.

460
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,656
Come on. Come on! Let's run.

461
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,774
''Alter Wein und junge Frauen
die Männer fröhlich machen. ''

462
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,092
What does it mean?

463
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,292
It means ''Old wine and young women
make a man happy.''

464
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,658
Do you think he... got out in time?

465
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,536
Maybe.

466
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,934
Quint!

467
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:26,053
Maybe in France...
there's a couple strolling,

468
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,450
and they... they see Scotty's plane.

469
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,132
(Penrose) Command knows the position
the enemy has placed us in.

470
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,651
Hufford was right. The mission itself
is costly enough in men and machines.

471
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,011
And there's the prisoners,
the murder - oh, yes, that is the word -

472
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,177
the murder of our men, and the
propaganda to be made out of it.

473
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,179
Nevertheless, the orders remain:
destroy Charlon.

474
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,739
- Regardless of the cost?
- Regardless.

475
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:31,569
Now that is a measure of
how important this thing is.

476
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,656
Group has been notified.

477
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,455
They hit the target ten minutes
after your highball attack on the tunnel.

478
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,175
Takeoff at 0600 hours tomorrow,
weather permitting.

479
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:46,856
It's off! The whole bloody
Continent's socked in. It's off!

480
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,016
- You mean it's postponed?
- For how long?

481
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,213
I don't know. It's thick and soupy for
as far ahead as we can forecast. It's off!

482
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,976
Ah!

483
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,974
For the first time,
I'm almost glad of this thing.

484
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,888
- Hey! A Scotch for the squadron leader.
- You trying to drink the bar dry?

485
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:31,616
Funny you should say that, Quint,
cos that is exactly what I intend to do.

486
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:36,336
Well, for the first time in my life,
I'm glad I'm not flying any more.

487
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,930
That's right, Quint, look around.

488
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,051
Take a good look at those faces.

489
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,856
Think of the other faces that have been
in this room, faces you and I saw recently.

490
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,336
- Faces of friends of ours, close friends.
- Take it easy, Doug.

491
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,812
You know what's the matter with them?
Pre-op nerves. Weather wait.

492
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:01,250
- If they knew what we know...
- I'm gonna take you to your room.

493
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,656
What would happen if they knew
about the POWs in Charlon?

494
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,736
- Shut up.
- There'd be a ruddy riot.

495
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,977
- I'm sure there would. That's enough.
- It's not enough!

496
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,649
''Shut up!'' ''Be a good boy!''
That's what's wrong with this war, Quint.

497
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:18,092
Those who can see not telling these blind
fools where they're falling. You daren't...

498
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,734
Get off me!

499
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,852
Do you know what the Nazis
have moved into Charlon?

500
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,336
- You don't know what you're saying.
- POWs, that's what!

501
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,576
Airmen - Mosquito pilots.
They're making you into murderers!

502
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,339
- Is this true, Quint?
- Course it is. Look at his face.

503
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,416
Gentlemen!

504
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,255
Escort this officer to his quarters.

505
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,450
There'll be a briefing
in one hour for all duty officers.

506
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:19,175
Well, that is the situation. You know
it all now. You would have been told.

507
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:23,094
And the directive remains:
Charlon must be destroyed.

508
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:27,213
- But, sir, suppose...
- Templeton, do your job and I'll do mine.

509
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:31,128
Now, just look at this matter.
If the work at Charlon continues,

510
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:35,651
hundreds of thousands of people might
die, all of southern England devastated,

511
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,170
our bridgehead in Europe destroyed,
the invasion delayed months.

512
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,531
- Couldn't the paratroops go in?
- They'd be slaughtered.

513
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,458
- The French underground?
- The Germans are on the alert.

514
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:49,209
No, it must be a strike from the air.

515
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,932
There may be a way, sir. While we attack,
we detach one aircraft to breach the wall,

516
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,130
the French underground
cross the breach,

517
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:02,252
take on the Germans in the castle
and help our chaps out.

518
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,416
- Just ahead of our bombing attack?
- Yes.

519
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,089
- Then what?
- Well, then it's every man for himself.

520
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,450
Scuttling out? Running in all directions?

521
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,777
At least this way they won't die
under our own bombs.

522
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,334
Yes. All right. I can see some sense in it.

523
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,974
Then you get Headquarters
to approve the plan.

524
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,012
They'll need the cooperation
of the French underground.

525
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,450
The underground couldn't mount
an effort on this scale.

526
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,573
Even if they could, those prisoners who
aren't killed when you blast open the wall

527
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,975
would be scattered throughout the castle,

528
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,979
locked up in dozens
of cubbyholes and cellars.

529
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,058
You'd need a force that could
subdue the German garrison

530
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,899
and stand off reinforcements
from outside.

531
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,211
No. I applaud your motives
but your scheme is impracticable.

532
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:49,457
Giving men a chance for
their lives is impracticable?

533
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:54,817
You have a particular emotional
involvement with these prisoners.

534
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,411
Have you thought about the men on the
ground you're asking to risk their lives?

535
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:03,249
Nothing must be attempted that would
jeopardise the aim of the strike.

536
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,211
Supposing...

537
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,170
Supposing, just before we blow the wall,

538
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,610
that the prisoners could be gathered
together in one safe place.

539
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:16,291
Couldn't the underground take them over
and get them out on the escape route?

540
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,259
Most of those that survive, I would say.

541
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,858
Then schedule the attack
for Sunday morning.

542
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,208
Sunday morning?

543
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,296
(Morse bleeps)

544
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,257
Sunday morning. Of course. Of course.

545
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:38,658
- Mon père, qu'est-ce que c'est?
- N'importe. Allez, dépêchez-vous.

546
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,256
- Morning.
- Morning, padre.

547
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,776
Good day.

548
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,769
Morning, Father.

549
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,175
Ah, Lieutenant Schack, bonjour.

550
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,929
Bonjour, Father Bellague.
The confessional is all ready for you.

551
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,016
Thank you.

552
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,819
Please remove your guards.
I cannot ask these men

553
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,170
to confess to God
with a gun at their backs.

554
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,372
Sorry, Father. The commandant's orders.

555
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:22,379
I think he suspects you give out
more than absolution in the confessional.

556
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,333
Perhaps he'd prefer me
to hear my confessions in the open,

557
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,690
where his entire garrison could watch?

558
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,776
As you please, Father.

559
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,854
Geben Sie mir einen Stuhl.

560
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,696
Tu, was er sagt.

561
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,816
Here.

562
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,528
- Give me your blessing, for I have sinned.
- Keep your lips moving and listen.

563
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,332
I will not repeat this.

564
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:21,055
Tell all your men they are to be
at Mass in chapel on Sunday morning.

565
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:24,138
Tell them that the order
is from Air Command.

566
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,377
Now, my son.

567
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,617
For I have sinned. Through my fault.

568
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,617
Through my most grievous fault.

569
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,696
(gives blessing)

570
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,096
Go in peace and pray for me.

571
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,174
Keep your lips moving, son,
and listen carefully.

572
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:52,179
When all the men are in chapel
tomorrow morning and the attack begins,

573
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,531
- they are trying to get you out.
- Thank God!

574
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:59,016
Gentlemen, this mission must be
executed with exacting precision,

575
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,574
both in timing and accuracy.

576
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,375
This tunnel... must be closed.

577
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:08,812
Munroe, Clarke and Bannister
will fly the first phase.

578
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,773
Each of their Mosquitoes
will carry two highball bombs,

579
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,575
one of which is capable of destroying
the entire underground facility.

580
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:19,170
Munroe, as soon as one of you puts
a bomb into the mouth of the tunnel,

581
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,370
you may proceed to breach the wall.

582
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,855
The prisoners will be
waiting in the chapel.

583
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,936
Once the wall is destroyed,

584
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,893
the French underground
will start diversionary skirmishes

585
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:32,490
so that our men will have a chance
to head for the woods to the west.

586
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:37,011
Minutes later, waves of
Mosquitoes will level Charlon.

587
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,896
Any questions?

588
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,850
Takeoff at 0625 hours tomorrow.

589
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,856
Dismissed.

590
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:04,290
Looks as though it's going
to be pretty sloppy over Charlon.

591
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,173
Damned rain could ruin
what little chances we did have.

592
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,575
Rain or no rain, we go tomorrow.

593
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:13,295
Did Intelligence tell us how to get
a decent bounce off this muck?

594
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,935
Yeah. Just before you shoot,
you use my guaranteed equaliser.

595
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,778
What's that?

596
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,131
Just before you shoot,
you spit on your firing thumb.

597
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,849
What's so hilarious, chum?

598
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,540
I've been a bit worried about him recently.

599
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:35,448
- He was getting serious about his job.
- Is that so bad?

600
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:38,697
When a man like Quint Munroe
gets serious, he gets cautious.

601
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,380
- That's when his luck deserts him.
- And us?

602
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,014
And us.

603
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,290
Hey!

604
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:03,413
- They won't let me see Douglas.
- I thought you knew that already.

605
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,093
I thought if I came here to the base, I...

606
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:13,089
I had to see you, Quint.

607
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,219
Well, I... I can't stay long.

608
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:23,536
Can't you tell me why he's confined to
his quarters? Why I can't speak to him?

609
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:27,778
- Insubordination.
- That's not true. To whom?

610
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,056
The wing commander.

611
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,578
I... I shouldn't have come here.

612
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,014
When will I see you again?

613
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,776
Tomorrow.

614
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,976
With luck?

615
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:09,854
Come back, Quint.
I couldn't bear it if you didn't.

616
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,133
Stand easy, please.

617
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:33,650
Don't worry, I'm going to spare you
my usual tedious pep talk.

618
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,374
You know the importance of your
mission.

619
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:40,698
Just remember that our bomber wave will
start their drop at precisely 1000 hours,

620
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:44,972
regardless of whether or not
all our prisoners are out of Charlon.

621
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:50,299
So any delay in dealing with the targets
assigned to you could be very costly.

622
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:55,016
That's all I wanted to say,
except to wish each of you good luck.

623
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,175
(horn honks)

624
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,859
'Shun!

625
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,936
Good morning, gentlemen.

626
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:10,056
Stand easy.

627
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:14,059
I'm told the weather over Charlon
will be ideal for our purposes today.

628
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:16,489
- Everyone feeling well?
- Yes, thank you, sir.

629
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:21,057
- Perhaps you'd better break this news.
- As you wish, Wing Commander.

630
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:24,217
It's from the air marshal.
A slight change in your orders.

631
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:30,017
You are not to attack the prison wall until
you have successfully sealed that tunnel.

632
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,289
What if it takes
all six highballs to do the job?

633
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:36,809
Then, regrettably,
the escape plan is aborted.

634
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,410
- The underground was told to withdraw.
- Our chaps will be blown to hell.

635
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:43,976
The tunnel has first priority.
The escape plan is a bonus operation.

636
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,490
It made sense with a highball
for the prison, but this is obscene!

637
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:52,774
That's enough! There will be no deviation
from the air marshal's orders.

638
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,050
Is that clear, Squadron Leader Munroe?

639
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,011
Sir.

640
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,575
I'm sure you'll have several highballs
to spare for that wall, Munroe.

641
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,010
- I feel confident of that.
- I'm glad you do, sir.

642
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,936
Carry on, Wing Commander.

643
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,616
All right.

644
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:35,014
- You know the trouble with this war, sir?
- What?

645
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:37,574
The world's back to front.

646
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,134
- Back to front?
- Yeah.

647
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,410
We go out
and the sun's rising in our face.

648
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,338
We come home
and it's setting in our face.

649
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,416
Yeah. The world's back to front.

650
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,618
- I bet the Luftwaffe doesn't think so.
- Ah!

651
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:55,813
They had years preparing for this
rotten war. We just got it handed to us.

652
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,096
(church bell tolls)

653
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:50,055
Suddenly, Father,
everyone is very religious.

654
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:52,136
You!

655
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:58,896
He can't even remember his name.
How does he know he's a Catholic?

656
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:03,214
The Spirit moves in mysterious ways,
Lieutenant Schack.

657
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:05,251
Go.

658
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:08,452
The commandant is not
so difficult to understand.

659
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:18,614
The commandant dislikes
mysterious occurrences.

660
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,696
Take care, Priest.

661
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:41,337
- Squadron Leader?
- Yes, Father?

662
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:44,258
You, erm... You do not know your name?

663
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,334
No, Father.

664
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:51,372
Please, take your seat, my son.

665
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:09,008
If anything ever puts me off religion,
this will.

666
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:11,256
- What's happening?
- Escape.

667
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,133
- Who says so?
- I do. The old priest's up to something.

668
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:17,730
That's right.
He's gonna sneak us out under his robes.

669
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:20,693
- All of us?
- We're going home.

670
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,690
- How's Daisy?
- Don't ask.

671
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:14,535
Now what?

672
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,697
She lost the ration books again -
we're starving to death!

673
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,209
Still, she makes up for it in other ways.

674
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:45,336
(priest administers Mass)

675
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,616
Five minutes to target.

676
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:29,895
New course, 160... now!

677
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,135
(air-raid siren)

678
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,898
Out, out, out, out!
Everyone back to his cell!

679
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,937
Squadron Leader Neale!

680
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,096
You're a senior officer here.

681
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:18,452
Order your men to march
outside at once... please!

682
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:21,253
Stay where you are, men. That's an order.

683
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,216
So we have a mutiny on our hands.

684
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,695
Priest!

685
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:33,776
Tell them to obey!

686
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:43,134
You're a foolish man, Father Bellague.

687
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,576
You insist on being a martyr!

688
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,933
You fascist!

689
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,296
Barricade the door!

690
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,698
- He's dead.
- Take him to the sacristy.

691
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:11,371
Now, men! Men!

692
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,129
Men, listen to me!

693
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,330
Gather round and listen.

694
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:21,094
- We've been ordered to stay here.
- We can't stay holed up here, sir.

695
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:25,099
We'll stick it as long as we can.
Now settle down. Back to your seats!

696
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:28,737
Hound Master to Pack,
one minute to target.

697
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:32,098
(Quint) I'll drop first at 60 feet,
1,000 yards out.

698
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,973
Watch how I bounce
and compensate accordingly. Over.

699
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,056
Roger. Good luck, Quint!

700
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,693
Air scoop out!

701
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,615
Air scoop out, sir.

702
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,897
- RPM?
- 6-5-0. 700.

703
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,338
Stand by.

704
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:23,610
Steady. Steady.

705
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,496
Bomb away!

706
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:43,017
Dog One to Hound Master.
I'm going to drop from 75 feet at 1100.

707
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:56,336
Bomb away!

708
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:06,377
Dog Two from Hound Master.
Same height at 1200. Over.

709
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,252
Roger.

710
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:11,815
Bandits on your tail, sir. Bandits!

711
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,775
We're down to two shots, Bannister.
We've still got two targets.

712
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,255
Then I'd better make this one good.

713
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,736
Dog One! Dog One!

714
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:44,216
Bannister! Are you all right?

715
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,088
Bannister. Are you all right?

716
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:58,690
Better get started
for that prison wall, chum.

717
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:01,334
Everything's under control here.

718
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:21,494
Make it good, Wiley.
It's their only chance.

719
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,532
(shouts order)

720
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:34,168
They're gonna blast us out.

721
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:36,669
This is suicide. We've got
to get out, sir.

722
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,260
No! Hang on until the last moment.

723
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:54,890
Stand by!

724
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:03,329
(Wiley) Hold it. Hold it.

725
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,456
Bomb away!

726
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,456
Come on!

727
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,055
Viens ici!

728
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:01,136
Vite, vite!

729
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:34,689
Wiley!

730
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:54,775
Scotty?

731
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,533
The tank! Get it! Get it!

732
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:02,619
Scotty, it's me! It's me - Quint.

733
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,936
Who?

734
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:14,572
- Scotty!
- What did you call me?

735
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,656
Someone's gonna have to get that tank!

736
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:23,534
You're Squadron Leader David Scott.
You've gotta remember!

737
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:26,896
Beth!

738
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:51,017
Got us pinned down, that tank.
Gotta get across that road.

739
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:53,096
Here, give me that.

740
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:20,293
Scotty!

741
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,816
That tank!

742
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,737
You've gotta listen to me.

743
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:29,016
You've gotta listen to me.

744
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:32,056
Scotty, what about Beth?

745
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:38,174
Scotty!

746
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,572
Scotty!

747
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,212
Beth.

748
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:55,976
Scotty!

749
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:27,256
Parade, 'shun!

750
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,694
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

751
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,531
This lot were picked up from the beach
last night by a submarine.

752
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:43,128
They've just flown in from Southampton.

753
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:47,617
The mission was a success.
Just the casualties are so damnably bad.

754
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:36,176
(Doug) Quint!

755
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:39,216
Thank God. Scotty?

756
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,136
He was killed.

757
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:48,051
Does, er...

758
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:50,853
Does Beth know he was alive?

759
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,936
No.

760
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:01,616
Munroe, well done.

761
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:04,174
What you and the others did,
my boy, was historic.

762
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:07,019
Yes, and costly.
We lost Bannister and Clarke.

763
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:10,257
(Hufford) But Germany
will always remember Charlon.

764
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:14,612
(Penrose) There'll be another squadron.
There'll never be another Charlon.

765
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:20,576
If you'll excuse me, sir.

766
