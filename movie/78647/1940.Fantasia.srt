1
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,031
How do you do?

2
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,118
It's my very pleasant duty
to welcome you here...

3
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,118
on behalf of Walt Disney,
Leopold Stokowski...

4
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,676
and all the other artists
and musicians whose combined talents...

5
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,032
went into the creation of this
new form of entertainment, Fantasia.

6
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,832
What you're going to see...

7
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,394
are the designs
and pictures and stories...

8
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,637
that music inspired in the minds
and imaginations...

9
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,751
of a group of artists.

10
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,711
In other words,
these are not going to be...

11
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,070
the interpretations
of trained musicians.

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,191
Which I think is all to the good.

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,833
So now we present...

14
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,999
the Tocatta and Fugue in D-Minor
by Johann Sebastian Bach...

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,112
interpreted in pictures
by Walt Disney and his associates...

16
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,390
and in music
by the Philadelphia Orchestra...

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,910
and its conductor,
Leopold Stokowski.

18
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,077
You know, it's funny how wrong
an artist can be about his own work.

19
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,351
Now, the one composition of
Tchaikovsky's that he really detested...

20
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,198
was his Nutcracker Suite...

21
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,595
which is probably the most
popular thing he ever wrote.

22
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,030
Incidentally, you won't see
any nutcracker on the screen.

23
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,628
There's nothing left
of him but the title.

24
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,034
And now we're going to hear a piece of
music that tells a very definite story.

25
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,039
It's a very old story.
One that goes back almost 2,000 years.

26
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,072
A legend about a sorcerer
who had an apprentice.

27
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,632
He was a bright young lad
very anxious to learn the business.

28
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,069
As a matter of fact,
he was a little bit too bright...

29
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,875
uh, because he started practising
some of the boss's best magic tricks...

30
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,070
before learning
how to control them.

31
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,229
Mr. Stokowski.
Mr. Stokowski.

32
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,710
My congratulations, sir.

33
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,675
Congratulations to you, Mickey.

34
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,552
Gee, thanks.

35
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,956
Well, so long.
I'll be seein' ya.

36
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,678
Bye.

37
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,630
When Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet,
The Rite of Spring...

38
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,991
his purpose was, in his own words,
to ''express primitive life. ''

39
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,874
So Walt Disney and his fellow artists
have taken him at his word.

40
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,594
Instead of presenting the ballet
in its original form...

41
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,872
as a simple series of tribal dances,
they have visualized it as a pageant--

42
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,390
as the story of the growth
of life on Earth.

43
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,557
It's a coldly accurate reproduction
of what science thinks went on...

44
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,672
during the first few billion years
of this planet's existence.

45
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,349
So now imagine yourselves
out in space...

46
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,948
billions and billions
of years ago...

47
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,277
looking down on this lonely,
tormented little planet...

48
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,233
spinning through
an empty sea of nothingness.

49
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,191
Uh, before we get into
the second half of the programme...

50
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,276
I'd like to introduce
somebody to you--

51
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,516
somebody who's
very important to Fantasia.

52
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,596
He's very shy and very retiring.

53
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,473
I just happened to run across him
one day at the Disney studios.

54
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,511
But when I did, I realized...

55
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,393
that here was not only an indispensable
member of the organization...

56
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,272
but a screen personality.

57
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,551
And so I'm very happy to have
this opportunity to introduce to you...

58
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,999
the soundtrack.

59
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,717
Come on. Don't be timid.

60
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,118
That a soundtrack.

61
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,834
Now, watching him, I discovered
that every beautiful sound...

62
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,520
also creates
an equally beautiful picture.

63
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,031
Now, look. Will the soundtrack
kindly produce a sound?

64
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,232
Go on, don't be nervous.
Go ahead. Any sound.

65
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,355
Well, that isn't quite
what I had in mind.

66
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,358
Uh, suppose we see
and hear the harp.

67
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,036
Uh, now one of the strings--
say, the violin.

68
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,555
And now--
now one of the woodwinds--

69
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,557
a flute.

70
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,473
Very pretty.

71
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,068
Now let's have a brass instrument--
the trumpet.

72
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,230
Oh, all right. Now, uh, how about
a low instrument-- the bassoon?

73
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,951
Go on. Go on.
Drop the other shoe, will you?

74
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,790
Well, now to finish, suppose we see
some of the percussion instruments...

75
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,911
beginning with the bass drum.

76
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,837
Thanks a lot, all of ya.

77
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,392
The symphony that Beethoven
called the ''Pastoral''...

78
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,796
his sixth, is one of the few pieces
of music he ever wrote...

79
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,115
that tells something
like a definite story.

80
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,708
He was a great nature lover,
and in this symphony...

81
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,877
he paints a musical picture
of a day in the country.

82
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,911
Now, of course,
the country that Beethoven described...

83
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,554
was the countryside
with which he was familiar.

84
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,433
But his music covers
a much wider field than that...

85
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,915
and so Walt Disney
has given the ''Pastoral''symphony...

86
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,917
a mythological setting.

87
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,114
Now we're going to do one of the most
famous and popular ballets...

88
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:46,470
ever written--
''The Dance of the Hours''...

89
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,989
from Ponchielli's opera
La Gioconda.

90
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,111
It's a pageant
of the hours of the day.

91
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,117
All this takes place
in the great hall...

92
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,878
with its garden beyond...

93
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,231
of the palace of Duke Alvise,
a Venetian nobleman.

94
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:54,713
The last number
in our Fantasia programme...

95
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:57,798
is a combination of two pieces
of music so utterly different...

96
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,993
in construction and mood that
they set each other off perfectly.

97
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,111
The first is
''A Night on Bald Mountain''...

98
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:07,596
by one of Russia's greatest composers,
Modeste Mussorgsky.

99
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:11,030
The second is Franz Schubert's
immortal ''Ave Maria. ''

100
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:12,878
Musically and dramatically,
we have here...

101
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,117
a picture of the struggle
between the profane and the sacred.
