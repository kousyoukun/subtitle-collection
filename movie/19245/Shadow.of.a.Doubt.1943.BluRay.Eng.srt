1
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:33,134
<i>Come in.</i>

2
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:35,887
Mr Spencer.
Mr Spencer, I hate to bother you...

3
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:38,556
but I thought you'd like to know
there were two men here.

4
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:40,558
Two men askin' for you.

5
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:43,519
A young man and a kind of older man.

6
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:46,522
They was sorry you wasn't in.
I said you wasn't.

7
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:50,860
- Did they say they'd be back?
- They didn't say, but I think they will.

8
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:55,031
Just now, when I had to go to the store,
I seen them standing there at the corner.

9
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,450
Maybe I shoulda let them in,
only you said not to disturb you -

10
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,371
- Yes.
- And I'm sure They'll be back.

11
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:04,774
You look kinda tired to me,
and that's a fact.

12
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:07,109
You got a headache or somethin'?

13
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:10,738
I think maybe you need a real rest.
That's what I think.

14
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:14,659
Why, Mr Spencer. You oughtn't to leave
all that money lying around like that.

15
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,370
Oh, it makes me nervous
to see money lying around.

16
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:19,580
Everybody in the world
ain't honest, you know.

17
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:22,041
Though I must say I haven't had
much trouble that way.

18
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:26,712
<i>Those friends of yours
told me not to mention they'd called.</i>

19
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:30,341
Wanted to surprise you. But I thought
you'd like to know somehow.

20
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,219
Yes, yes. Of course. If they come back,
you may show them in.

21
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:36,764
Yes. You know, Mrs Martin,
it's very funny.

22
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:40,184
They aren't exactly friends of mine.
They've never seen me.

23
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:43,396
- That's odd, isn't it?
- 'Tis odd, like you say.

24
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:48,359
And now that I'm here,
I'll have to meet them.

25
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:52,488
I may even go out and meet them.

26
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:55,866
And then again, I may not. Not yet.

27
00:03:56,075 --> 00:04:00,371
You go ahead with your nap.
I'll pull down the blind.

28
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:37,192
<i>What do you know?
You're bluffing. You've nothing on me.</i>

29
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:36,102
Hello, Postal Union?
I want to send a telegram

30
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:40,440
to Mrs Joseph Newton
in Santa Rosa, California.

31
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:43,068
Here's the message. Ready?

32
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:46,446
Lonesome for you all. Stop.

33
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:50,033
Am coming out to stay
with you awhile. Stop.

34
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:53,411
Will arrive Thursday and try and stop me.

35
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,414
Will wire exact time later.

36
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:58,708
Love to you all...

37
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:03,255
and a kiss for little Charlie
from her Uncle Charlie.

38
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:07,717
That's right. That's the signature.
"Uncle Charlie. "

39
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,886
That's right. Santa Rosa.

40
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:14,015
<i>Santa Rosa, California.</i>

41
00:07:52,512 --> 00:07:56,933
<i>Ann! Answer the telephone.</i>

42
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:21,500
Newton's residence.
Ann Newton speaking.

43
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:25,504
Oh, hello, Mrs Henderson. This is Ann.

44
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:27,964
Mother isn't home yet.

45
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:31,551
A telegram? Well...

46
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,679
I don't see a pencil, so maybe
she better call you back.

47
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:38,016
I'm trying to keep my mind free of things
that don't matter...

48
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:41,478
because I have so much
to keep on my mind.

49
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,730
Innumerable things.

50
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:47,192
I'll have her call back.
Thank you for calling.

51
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,277
Goodbye.

52
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,493
Hello, Ann. Where's your mother?

53
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,495
<i>- She ' s out.
- Out?</i>

54
00:08:58,703 --> 00:09:01,706
Mrs Henderson just called
from the Postal Union Office.

55
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,708
She says we have a telegram.

56
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:07,212
I would have taken it down,
only I couldn't find a pencil. I looked.

57
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,548
Telegram, eh?

58
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:14,803
I knew there'd be trouble if
your Aunt Sarah got her driver's licence.

59
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:17,514
<i>- Whereabouts was the accident?
- I didn't take notes.</i>

60
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:20,308
Oh. Then how about a kiss?

61
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:28,066
Isn't that the funniest thing?
Here I am, practically a child

62
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:30,193
and I wouldn't read the things you read.

63
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,904
Mm-hm. Well, I guess
they'd give you bad dreams.

64
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:37,075
Bad dreams? You don't understand, Papa.
Mystery stories have done -

65
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,286
- Where's Roger?
- Out. The average mind -

66
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:43,331
- Where's Charlie?
- Out. No, she's in her room thinking.

67
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,668
Well, don't read too much.
You'll ruin your eyes.

68
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,671
And leave my book alone.
What's that you're reading?

69
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,924
<i>- Ivanhoe.
- Hm? Oh.</i>

70
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:02,017
- Who is it?
- It's me.

71
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:08,440
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

72
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:10,901
No. I'm perfectly well.

73
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:15,780
I've just been thinking for hours,
and I've come to the conclusion I give up.

74
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:18,241
<i>- I simply give up.
- What are you going to give up?</i>

75
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,204
Have you ever to thought that a family
should be the most wonderful thing ever?

76
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:24,789
And that this family's
just gone to pieces?

77
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:27,834
- We have?
- Of course we have.

78
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:33,215
We just sort of go along and
nothing happens. We're in a terrible rut.

79
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:37,636
It's been on my mind for months.
What's going to be our future?

80
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:41,056
Oh, come now, Charlie.
Things aren't as bad as that.

81
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:44,476
- The bank gave me a raise last January.
- Money.

82
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:48,480
How can you talk about money
when I'm talking about souls?

83
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:51,525
We eat and sleep and that's about all.

84
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:53,860
We don't even have
any real conversations.

85
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:56,196
<i>- We just talk.
- And work.</i>

86
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:59,699
Yes. Poor Mother. She works like a dog.

87
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:02,786
<i>- Just like a dog.
- Where is she?</i>

88
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:06,832
She's out. When she comes back,
it'll be the same thing.

89
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,170
Dinner, then dishes, then bed.
I don't see how she stands it.

90
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:15,757
You know,
she's really a wonderful woman.

91
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:20,345
I mean, she's not just a mother. And
I think we ought to do something for her.

92
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:24,015
<i>- Don ' t you think we should?
- Yeah. What were you thinking of?</i>

93
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:28,478
Oh, nothing, I suppose.

94
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,856
I guess we'll just have to wait
for a miracle or something.

95
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:34,025
Oh, now, Charlie, you're right.
Absolutely right.

96
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:38,947
- I'll figure out some way -
- I don't believe in good intentions now.

97
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:42,701
- All I'm waiting for now is a miracle.
- Oh, Charlie.

98
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,953
Those back stairs are steep.

99
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:47,706
What's the matter, Charlie?
What's the matter, Joe?

100
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:52,043
- Well, it seems that, uh -
- Oh, I've become a nagging old maid.

101
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:55,380
You went downtown in that awful old
hat you'd promised you'd throw away.

102
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,633
<i>- Mama.
- Darling, does it matter what hat I wear?</i>

103
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:02,470
<i>- Mama.
- Why do you let that child yell at you?</i>

104
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,223
- If she -
- I'm going downstairs, anyway.

105
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:08,143
<i>Joe, what were you
both talking about when I came in?</i>

106
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:10,145
<i>Something about a miracle.</i>

107
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:12,731
<i>Oh, it's nothing.
Charlie ' s a bit under the weather.</i>

108
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:14,774
<i>Oh. Well, she ' II be all right.</i>

109
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:18,612
<i>Well, come on, dear. Let's go
downstairs. No use standing here.</i>

110
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:21,448
I'm going to get myself a bottle of beer.

111
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:23,533
Mother, I'm going downtown
and send a telegram.

112
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,911
Why, darling, who do you know
to send a telegram to?

113
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:29,623
I know a wonderful person who'll come
and stir us up. Just the one to save us.

114
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:31,958
What do you mean, "save us"?

115
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:35,128
All this time, there's been
one right person to save us.

116
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,466
- What's Uncle Charlie's address?
- Uncle Charlie?

117
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:42,260
- You're not going to ask him for money?
- Of course not.

118
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:45,222
That wouldn't help us.
What's his address?

119
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,266
- The last address I had -
- Do you know how many steps it is

120
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:50,185
to get from here
to the drugstore and back?

121
00:12:50,393 --> 00:12:54,773
- 649.
- 649.
- If you've forgotten, I won't tell you.

122
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,651
- I remember. Philadelphia.

123
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:01,613
You can't ask a busy man
to come all this way for nothing.

124
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:04,032
He'll come for me. I'm named after him.

125
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,618
Besides, we're the only relatives
he has in the world.

126
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:09,788
<i>If you come all the way up Fourth Street, it's 802.</i>

127
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:12,082
- Mama, guess what?
- I have no time for guessing.

128
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,209
What's that thing in your hair?

129
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:18,547
Well, I'll tell you anyway, even though
I think it's nicer when people guess.

130
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:22,759
Mrs Henderson said to call her at
the telegraph office. We have a telegram.

131
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,178
Ann, I don't think you ought to put things
behind your ears.

132
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:29,307
- Something might get into your ear.
- Emmy, Ann says we have a telegram.

133
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:32,936
I think you ought to find out about it.
Somebody might be sick or something.

134
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:37,399
Mrs Henderson didn't read the telegram
because I couldn't find a pencil.

135
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:36,219


136
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:40,527
When I have a house, it's going
to be full of well-sharpened pencils.

137
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,489
- Did Mrs Henderson say who it's from?
- No, she didn't.

138
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,789


139
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,367
She might have said who it was from.

140
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,036
Come on, Ann. That's my chair.
I'll call up and find out.

141
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:53,582
If you will be quiet just a second.

142
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,879
Hello. 181, please. I wonder who it can be?

143
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,965
Oh, nothing, Operator. Just 181.

144
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,676
<i>- If that's from my sister -
- Hello?</i>

145
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,721
Mrs Henderson? This is Emma Newton.

146
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,307
Ann says you have a telegram for me.

147
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:12,309
- Mama, you don't have to shout.
- Ssh.

148
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:15,770
Really, Papa. You'd think
Mama had never seen a phone.

149
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,898
She makes no allowance for science.

150
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:21,026
She thinks she has to cover the distance
by sheer lungpower.

151
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:25,197
Why, how wonderful. Thursday, you say?

152
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,199
Looks like somebody's coming.

153
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:31,203
- Who's coming, Ma?
- Well, it's the most wonderful surprise.

154
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:35,332
It's my brother, you know.
My younger brother. The baby.

155
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,211
Yes, of course, a little spoiled.
Families always spoil the youngest.

156
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,423
<i>Well, it's just simply wonderful.</i>

157
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,468
Thanks most awfully, Mrs Henderson.

158
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,679
Well...

159
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:54,226
What do you think? Charles is coming.

160
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:56,228
- Who?
- Your Uncle Charlie.

161
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,563
Did you say "Charles"?

162
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:04,569
And our Charlie's sending him a telegram.
Now, what made her think to do that?

163
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,863
<i>Hello, Charlie. I just called your house.</i>

164
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,574
- Telegram for your mother.
- Did you?

165
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,743
Gonna send that by Bill Forest,
but you can take it.

166
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,704
Thanks. From your uncle.
The spoiled one.

167
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,748
My uncle? My Uncle Charlie?

168
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,084
Yeah.

169
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:26,341
Mrs Henderson,
do you believe in telepathy?

170
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,301
Well, I ought to. That's my business.

171
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,680
Oh, not telegraphy. Mental telepathy.

172
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:34,724
Like...
well, suppose you have a thought,

173
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,602
and suppose the thought's about
someone you're in tune with.

174
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:42,065
Then across miles, that person knows
what you're thinking and answers you.

175
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,569
- And it's all mental.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

176
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:47,946
I only send telegrams the normal way.

177
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,999
He heard me. He heard me.

178
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:14,764
<i>- Mr Otis? Mr Otis?
- Yes?</i>

179
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:18,310
You're almost in Santa Rosa. Want to be
ready when you get into Santa Rosa.

180
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:22,314
<i>- I'm ready now. Thanks.
- Then I'll get all your bags out for you.</i>

181
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:24,941
<i>- How you feelin', Mr Otis?
- Pretty well.</i>

182
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,652
<i>A little weak
but pretty well on the whole.</i>

183
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,654
Mm-hm.

184
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,823
Harry, tell the porter you're a doctor.

185
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,160
Ask if there's anything you can do.
Maybe you can help that poor soul.

186
00:16:35,368 --> 00:16:38,872
- I'm on my vacation.
- My husband's a doctor and if there's -

187
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,417
No, Ma'am. He's a very sick man.
Won't see anyone.

188
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:45,545
I haven't set eyes on him myself
since we first got on the train.

189
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,256
<i>Well, you don ' t look very well either.</i>

190
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:01,102
Ah, here we are. Come on, children.

191
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,980
Close the door, there. That's right.

192
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,919
- Oh, are you -
- Charlie. Young Charlie.

193
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,505
At first, I didn't know you.
I thought you were sick.

194
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,382
- Sick?
- You aren't sick, are you?

195
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,634
Look, Pop! Here he is!

196
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:18,096
Why, Uncle Charlie, you're not sick.
That was the funniest thing.

197
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:23,143
- Me, sick? Well, Joe, how are you?
- Alright, Charles.

198
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:26,396
Roger. Hello, Ann.
I bet you don't remember me.

199
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,941
I remember you sort of.
You look different.

200
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,819
Well, we better get started.
Emma's got the dinner almost ready.

201
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,114
I couldn't persuade her to come
to the station. Dinner came first.

202
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,117
- Roger, get the bags. I'll take that.
- Thank you, Joe.

203
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,912
That's it. Come on. Let's go.

204
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,521
<i>Come on, Roger, get these bags.</i>

205
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,441
You, uh, sure that isn't
too heavy for you?

206
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,653
Oh, no. It's nothing. I love to carry.

207
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,158
Emma. Don't move.

208
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,494
Standing there,
you don't look like Emma Newton.

209
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:26,498
You look like Emma Spencer Oakley of
46 Burnham Street, St Paul, Minnesota.

210
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:29,292
- The prettiest girl on the block.
- Charles.

211
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,879
Mama, nobody got off the train
but Uncle Charlie.

212
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,423
- Let me look at you.
- There was only us meeting somebody.

213
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,844
- To think you could take the time off.
- There was only one bed made up.

214
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,556
- It's so wonderful to have you here.
- Emmy, Emmy, don't cry.

215
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,100
And imagine your thinking
of 46 Burnham Street.

216
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:47,519
I haven't thought of that
funny old street in years.

217
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,939
I keep remembering those things.
All the old things.

218
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:54,359
<i>Emmy, how's he look?
Same old Charles, eh?</i>

219
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,279
Roger, Ann, get these other bags.

220
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:04,870
<i>You have Charlie's room
right here at the head of the stairs.</i>

221
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:09,416
Emmy wanted to move Ann, but Charlie
thought you'd be more comfortable here.

222
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:11,585
<i>Come on, Roger.</i>

223
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:15,088
- Ah-ah! Don't put the hat on the bed.
- Superstitious, Joe?

224
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,175
No, but I don't believe in inviting trouble.

225
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,348
It wasn't the biggest yacht in the world,
but it had a fireplace in the library

226
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,434
and the bar was panelled
in bleached mahogany.

227
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:14,147
You pushed a button and...
What am I talking about? That's all over.

228
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,107
<i>Let's talk about you.</i>

229
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,736
Charlie,
that's the prettiest dress I ever saw.

230
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,780
<i>I think so, too.</i>

231
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:24,407
Why, Charles, don't you remember?

232
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,409
Remember? Remember what?

233
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,120
- Why, Uncle Charlie, you sent it to me.
- I did?

234
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,290
Well, say, I've been sitting here
all this time forgetting something.

235
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,335
Ann. Roger.

236
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,589
- Look at that. Oh, dear now.
- Joe. Don't know whether you had one.

237
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,593
You didn't have to think of me, Charles.
Presents for the children are alright.

238
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,555
Say... I've never had a wristwatch.

239
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,516
Fellows at the bank'll think
I'm quite a sport.

240
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,979
<i>I have two for you, Emmy.
One old and one new.</i>

241
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,523
<i>Oh, Charles. What is it?</i>

242
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:59,860
<i>- You shouldn't have. Really. No.
- Well, yeah.</i>

243
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,656
Oh, Charles.

244
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:08,118
Oh, how... beautiful.

245
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:10,203
Oh, I've-I've always wanted one.

246
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,373
Oh, Mother, it's exactly right.
It's what you should have.

247
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,625
Look, Emmy.

248
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,842
Charles. You've had these all along.

249
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,012
<i>Mm-hm. All along, Emmy.
All these years.</i>

250
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,764
Safe in a deposit box,
no matter where I was.

251
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,975
Oh. Grandpa and Grandma?

252
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,352
1888.

253
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,605
<i>53 years ago.</i>

254
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,274
Aren't they sweet?
My, she was pretty.

255
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:42,903
Everybody was sweet and pretty then.
The whole world.

256
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,656
A wonderful world.
Not like the world today.

257
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,035
Not like the world now.

258
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,037
It was great to be young then.

259
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,290
We're all happy now, Uncle Charlie.
Look at us.

260
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,419
- And we're all happy at the same time.
- Now, for your present, Charlie.

261
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:04,007
Oh, I don't want anything.
Right now, I have enough.

262
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,051
Before you came,
I didn't think I had anything,

263
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:10,222
but now I don't want another thing.

264
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,141
- She's crazy.
- She doesn't mean it.

265
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,728
If you ask me, I think she's putting on,
like girls in books.

266
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,898
The ones that say they don't want
anything always get more in the end.

267
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:23,151
- That's what she's hoping.
- She's not crazy.

268
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,237
The smartest girl
in her class at school.

269
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:30,242
<i>Won the debate against theEast
Richmond HighSchool. She's got brains.</i>

270
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,124
I meant it.
Please don't give me anything.

271
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,794
- Nothing?
- Oh, I can't explain it.

272
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:45,924
But you came here
and Mother's so happy and...

273
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:50,303
Oh, I'm glad that she named me after you
and that she thinks we're both alike.

274
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,099
I think we are, too. I know it.

275
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,727
Oh, it would spoil things
if you should give me anything.

276
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,940
You're a strange girl, Charlie.
Why would it spoil things?

277
00:24:02,148 --> 00:24:06,945
Because we're not just an uncle
and a niece. It's something else.

278
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:11,575
I know you. I know that you don't
tell people a lot of things.

279
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:17,497
I don't either. I have a feeling
that inside you somewhere,

280
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,750
<i>there's something nobody knows about.</i>

281
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,253
Something... nobody knows?

282
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:27,007
Something secret and wonderful and...
I'll find it out.

283
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,969
It's not good
to find out too much, Charlie.

284
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,847
But we're sort of like twins.
Don't you see?

285
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:38,310
- We have to know.
- Give me your hand, Charlie.

286
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,657
Thank you.

287
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,578
- You didn't even look at it.
- I don't have to.

288
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,747
No matter what you gave me,
it'd be the same.

289
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,832
Here. Let me show you.

290
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,838
It's a good emerald. A really good one.

291
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,929
Good emeralds are
the most beautiful things in the world.

292
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,064
- You've had something engraved.
- I haven't, but I will if you like it.

293
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,691
Yes, you have, Uncle Charlie.
It's very faint.

294
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,529
"T.S. From B.M."

295
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,990
But... Why, it must be someone's initials.

296
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,787
Well, I've been rooked.
The jeweller rooked me.

297
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,206
- Oh, it doesn't matter. Really.
- Give it back. I'll have it taken off.

298
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,708
No, No. I like it this way.

299
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,878
Someone else was probably happy
with this ring.

300
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,840
Oh, it's perfect the way it is.

301
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,342
You bring the coffee.

302
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,905
Sing at the table,
you'll marry a crazy husband.

303
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,992
Superstitions have been
proved 100% wrong.

304
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,579
Yes, I've been thinking of transferring
some money out here from the East.

305
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,789
I could put it in your bank, Joe,
until I found out what's what.

306
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,209
Uh, I suppose your bank
does take money, huh?

307
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,546
That's one thing we do.
Rake in the dough.

308
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,548
Can't promise to give it back.

309
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,592
Well, I'll go downtown in the morning
and open an account.

310
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,346
- 30 or 40,000 just to start things off?
- That's a lot of money.

311
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,016
He won't have it long.
The government will get it.

312
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,311
- The government gets -
- Don't talk against the government.

313
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,773
<i>The way men do things.</i>

314
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,526
I can't get that tune out of my head.

315
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,279
Maybe if somebody tells me what it is,
I'll forget it.

316
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,282
<i>- It's a waltz.
- I know it is, but what one?</i>

317
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,326
<i>You know, it's the funniest thing.</i>

318
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,745
<i>Sometimes I get a tune
in my head like that</i>

319
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,789
and pretty soon, I hear
somebody else humming it too.

320
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,167
I think tunes jump from head to head.

321
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,295
<i>Do you know whatit is,
Uncle Charlie?</i>

322
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,173
Uh, no. No. I-I-I don't know what it is.

323
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:17,969
<i>I remember.
Uh... It's on the tip of my tongue.</i>

324
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,263
<i>It's a waltz and it's Victor Herbert.</i>

325
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,935
- Victor Herbert wasn't a waltz.
- It's the Blue Danube Waltz.

326
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,063
Oh, yes. Of course it is.

327
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,652
No, it isn't, Uncle Charlie.
I know what it is. It's the Merry -

328
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,113
- I'm terribly sorry, Emmy.
- Nothing to make a fuss about.

329
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,450
Charles, while we do the dishes,
why don't you come in the living room

330
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,994
and stretch out on the sofa
and read the evening paper?

331
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,996
You never were much on helping.

332
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,750
<i>- Joe, here's Herbert.
- Ann, Roger, help me here.</i>

333
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:52,003
Herbert's a friend of Joe's.
They're literary critics.

334
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,841
Hello, Herb. Had your supper?

335
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,344
- Had mine an hour ago.
- Hour ago, huh?

336
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,346
- Oh. A watch.
- Yeah, a present.

337
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:05,016
Here, Herb.
I'd like you to meet my brother-in-law.

338
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,562
- Charles, this is Herb Hawkins.
- Nice to know you, Mr Hawkins.

339
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,981
- Fine, thank you.
- How's your mother, Herb?

340
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,734
- Oh, uh, just middling.
- Uh-huh.

341
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,695
- Excuse me, Herb.
- Oh.

342
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,031
Thank you.
I'm sorry your mother's not better.

343
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,243
- Thank you, dear. There, now.
- Thank you.

344
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,996
<i>Lead a life of luxury.</i>

345
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,917
<i>Well, I must go and see
what Charlie ' s doing.</i>

346
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,133
Wife's brother from the East.
New York man.

347
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,553
Good for the children.
You know what I mean?

348
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:46,266
In business?
Well, he takes himself very seriously.

349
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,852
Well, how's everything?

350
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,063
Say, ha-have you read this one? Huh?

351
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,065
That little Frenchman beats them all.

352
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,985
You can talk all you like
about Sherlock Holmes.

353
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,987
That little Frenchman beats 'em all.

354
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:02,449
I read it. Air bubbles don't
necessarily kill a person.

355
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,452
Those writers from the other side
get too fancy.

356
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,830
- The best way to commit a murder-
- I know, I know.

357
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,082
Hit 'em on the head
with a blunt instrument.

358
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,710
Well, it's true, isn't it? Listen.

359
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,837
If I wanted to murder you tomorrow,

360
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,924
do you think
I'd waste my time on fancy hypodermics?

361
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,967
- Or on Inee?
- What's that?

362
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,887
- Inee. Indian arrow poison.
- Oh.

363
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:28,308
Listen,
I'd find out if you were alone, walk in,

364
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,603
hit you on the head with a piece
of lead pipe or a loaded cane -

365
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,688
What'd be the fun of that?

366
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,441
Where's your planning?
Where's your clues?

367
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,110
I don't want any clues.
I want to murder you.

368
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,488
What do I want with clues?

369
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,616
Well, if you haven't got any clues,
where's your book?

370
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:49,329
I'm not talkin' 'bout writing books.
I'm talking about killing you!

371
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:53,458
If I was going to kill you, I wouldn't do
a dumb thing like hitting you on the head.

372
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,003
First of all,
I don't like the fingerprint angle.

373
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,173
Of course, I could always wear gloves,
press your hands against the pipe

374
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:04,302
after you were dead
and make you look like a suicide.

375
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:10,433
But you wouldn't beat yourself to death.
I'd do it so it didn't look like murder.

376
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,168
Oh, Ann?

377
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,130
<i>- What?
- Come here.</i>

378
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,509
Did you ever see a house
made out of newspapers?

379
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,887
Well, watch.

380
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,849
You-You take one sheet here.

381
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,102
OK? And you tear it down here.

382
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,855
And you tear it there.

383
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,900
You fold it over here at the side.

384
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,986
<i>Fold over the other side here.</i>

385
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,363
And turn it up there.

386
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,033
Now with... the door...

387
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,911
Right off... and there.

388
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,998
I'm not a baby any more.
Besides, that's Papa's paper.

389
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,919
<i>Oh, Roger, look what
we ' ve got. A nice, little red barn.</i>

390
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,048
- You've got Papa's paper.
- Oh, that's alright.

391
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,259
<i>Simply unfold it.
Nobody will ever know the difference.</i>

392
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,220
What are you two doing?

393
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:32,057
<i>- You know that's father's paper.
- It's my fault. I was playing a game.</i>

394
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,685
<i>- Didn't think about it as Joe's pap.
- Oh, that's alright.</i>

395
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,564
Here's page one, five... eight.

396
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,401
- What did you do with three and four?
- We never touched it.

397
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,571
<i>Really. Uncle Charlie ' s
the only one that touched it.</i>

398
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,240
Oh, well. I guess it's all right.

399
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,117
<i>If I fold it very neatly,
maybe he won ' t notice.</i>

400
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,169
<i>Come in.</i>

401
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,755
I brought you water.

402
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:06,383
Oh, thank you, Charlie.
That's very thoughtful of you.

403
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,926
<i>Pleasant dreams.</i>

404
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,348
Uncle Charlie...

405
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:18,103
- I know a secret you don't think I know.
- What secret?

406
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:23,275
Remember I said you couldn't hide
anything from me because I'd find it out?

407
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,444
Well, now I know there was something
in the evening paper about you.

408
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,489
About me in the evening paper?

409
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,075
<i>And that's why you played that game
with Ann and Roger.</i>

410
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:35,245
You didn't want us to know
and you wanted to tear the paper.

411
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,746
Now I know. You might as well tell me.

412
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,792
Well, you've got me there, Charlie.

413
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,794
Only it wasn't about me.
It was about, uh...

414
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,505
<i>someone I used to know.</i>

415
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,092
There!

416
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,137
It's none of your business.

417
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,599
Oh! Uncle Charlie, you're hurting me.

418
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,143
- Oh, Charlie.
- Your hands.

419
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,646
Charlie, I didn't mean to hurt you.

420
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,816
I was just fooling.

421
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:08,737
It was nothing. Just... Just some gossip.

422
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,991
Not very pretty,
about someone I once met up with.

423
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,829
Not for you to read.

424
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,334
Forget it.

425
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:28,006
- Good night, young Charlie.
- Good night. Pleasant dreams.

426
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:47,192
- How long is Uncle Charlie staying?
- Forever, I hope.

427
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,194
Hasn't he got a house of his own?

428
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,403
Not that I mind you in here,

429
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:54,157
but I never can tell
when I'll want some privacy.

430
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,827
You better go to sleep, baby.

431
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,912
- You said your prayers?
- I forgot.

432
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,206
You better say them.

433
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,001
I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep -

434
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,046
- Don't bless too many people. It's late.
- I pray the Lord my soul to take.

435
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:12,092
God bless Mama, Papa, Captain Midnight,
Veronica Lake and the president -

436
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,389
- You can't say them all tonight, dear.
- Oh, and Uncle Charlie. Amen.

437
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:53,383
- All ready for breakfast?
- Oh, coffee, Emmy.

438
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,970
I don't know how you do it.
Now, I'm never comfortable eating in bed.

439
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,306
I had to have my meals in bed for a while

440
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,267
after the children came,
but I never liked it.

441
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,687
I can't face the world in the morning.
I must have coffee before I can speak.

442
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,440
Well, I don't mind pampering you
your first morning,

443
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:12,444
but I think you're the only person
in this town to have breakfast at 10:30.

444
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,614
And while you were sleeping,
the newspaper called up for an interview.

445
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,157
With me?

446
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,952
And the women's club I belong to
wants you to give a little talk.

447
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,955
Women's club.

448
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:28,460
Oh! Oh, you haven't finished unpacking.
I'll do that for you.

449
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,463
<i>- Where ' s Charlie?
- She's running around like a mad thing.</i>

450
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,465
She thinks everything needs fixing.

451
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:38,470
But what I wanted to tell you was that
you're not the only celebrity in this town.

452
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,848
<i>- We're all going to be in limelight.
- What are you cooking up?</i>

453
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,310
<i>Well, a young man called this morning,
said his name was Graham,</i>

454
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,480
<i>and he wants to interview
everybody in this house.</i>

455
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,732
<i>- Interview everybody?
- That's what he said.</i>

456
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:55,737
He's being sent around the country
by some kind of institute or committee

457
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:59,658
and he has to pick a representative
American family and ask them questions.

458
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:04,120
<i>It's a kind of a poll.
It's called the National Public Survey.</i>

459
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,164
Wonder how he happened
to pick this family?

460
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,875
Well, he said he wanted
a typical American family.

461
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,628
I told him
we weren't a typical American family.

462
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,297
If he's going to ask a lot of questions,
he can leave me out of it.

463
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:18,134
Oh, but you could tell him so much more
than any of us could.

464
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,680
- He's going to take our pictures too.
- Pictures.

465
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,849
My, isn't that lovely?

466
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,977
You see, there were really,
there were two young men.

467
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,688
<i>One of them takes the pictures.</i>

468
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,108
<i>- Oh, there were two.
- Yes. Mr Graham was the nicest.</i>

469
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,527
Oh, he doesn't want us
to dress up or anything.

470
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,113
<i>He just wants us to act
the way we always do.</i>

471
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,699
Emmy, women are fools.
They'd fall for anything.

472
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:47,873
Why do you let two strangers come
and turn this place upside down.

473
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,835
<i>Why expose the family
to a couple of snoopers?</i>

474
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:56,214
- You should have more sense.
- Why, Charles, I -

475
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:59,092
<i>- Good morning, Uncle Charlie.
- Good morning, Charlie.</i>

476
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:02,554
Your mother says the Newtons have been
picked for all-American suckers.

477
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,848
- What do you know about it?
- Charlie wasn't here when they came.

478
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,977
But really, the way Mr Graham told it,
it wasn't like snooping at all.

479
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:12,731
It was our duty as citizens.
It's something the government wants.

480
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,734
<i>- Government?
- Well, it's for the public good.</i>

481
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,654
<i>I told them about you andtheplaces
you've been and he was very interested.</i>

482
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,198
Now, listen, Emmy.
I'll have nothing to do with this.

483
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,534
I'm just a visitor here and my advice
to you is to slam the door in his face.

484
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,995
Oh. Well, I-I couldn't do that.

485
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,164
But you don't have to meet him
if you don't want to.

486
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,166
Well, I think I'd be kind of exciting.

487
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,710
He'd take your photograph
and then we could have it for nothing.

488
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,588
No thank you. I've never been
photographed and I don't want to be.

489
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,548
Oh, Charles, how can you talk that way?

490
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,510
I had a photograph of you.
I gave it to Charlie.

491
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:45,263
I tell you, there are none.
I guess you've forgotten this one.

492
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,766
Get it, Charlie.

493
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,768
<i>You sure you don't remember?</i>

494
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:54,314
<i>Of course I don't
ever remember being photographed.</i>

495
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,110
<i>46 Burnham Street.</i>

496
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,531
Mm-hm. It was taken
the Christmas you got your bicycle.

497
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:06,117
- Just before your accident.
- Uncle Charlie, you were beautiful.

498
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:10,205
Wasn't he, though?
And such a quiet boy. Always reading.

499
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:14,543
Papa shouldn't have got you that bicycle.
You didn't know how to handle it.

500
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:19,297
He took it right out on the icy road
and skidded into a streetcar.

501
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:22,467
- We thought he was going to die.
- I'm glad he didn't.

502
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:27,430
He almost did. He fractured his skull,
and he was laid up so long.

503
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,308
And then, when he was getting well,
there was no holding him.

504
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,645
And it was just as though
all the rest he had was too much for him

505
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,648
and he had to get into mischief
to blow off steam.

506
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:39,734
He didn't do much reading after that,
let me tell you.

507
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,487
It was taken the very day
he had his accident.

508
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:47,075
A few days later when the pictures
came home, how mama cried.

509
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:51,663
She wondered if he'd ever look the same.
She wondered if he'd ever be the same.

510
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:55,125
What's the use of looking backward?
What's the use of looking ahead?

511
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,504
Today's the thing.
That's my philosophy. Today.

512
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,465
If today's the thing,
then you'd better finish your breakfast

513
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,593
and get down to the bank
because Joe'll be waiting.

514
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:09,306
<i>Charlie, don't be late back.
The survey men are coming at 4:00.</i>

515
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,360
- Good morning, Charlie.
- Hello, Madge.

516
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,030
<i>- Good morning, Charlie.
- Hello, Catherine.</i>

517
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,958
Did you see the way they looked at you?
I bet they wonder who you are.

518
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:41,296
Uncle Charlie, I love to walk with you.
I want everybody to see you.

519
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,610
<i>There's Papa in that window over there.</i>

520
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,953
Hello, Joe. Can you stop embezzling
a minute and give me your attention?

521
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,412
Oh, uh...

522
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:19,000
Charles, we don't joke
about such things here.

523
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,586
Oh, what's a little shortage in the books
at the end of the month?

524
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,464
<i>Any good bank clerk can cover up
alittle shortage. Isn't that right, Charlie</i>

525
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:29,511
- Everyone can hear you.
- Good. We all know what banks are.

526
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:33,348
<i>Look all right, but noone knows
what goes on when they lock the doors.</i>

527
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:36,226
<i>Can't fool me, though.
Well, Joe, let's see your president.</i>

528
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,562
Still want to open that account, Charles?
That's why I'm here.

529
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:43,024
Well, uh, you wait right here.
I'll see if Mr Greene's busy.

530
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:47,404
And, uh, Charles, he doesn't care much
for jokes about banks.

531
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,282
Well, $40,000 is no joke.
Not to him, I bet.

532
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,952
It's a joke to me.
The whole world's a joke to me.

533
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:56,413
I'll be right back.

534
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:06,298
You shouldn't tease Papa like that.

535
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:10,468
I wasn't teasing him.
I just hate this stuffy atmosphere.

536
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:15,140
They're waving for us to come in.

537
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,812
<i>- Hello, Mr Greene.
- Hello, Charlie.</i>

538
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:24,149
Well, Mr Greene, this is
my brother-in-law, Mr Oakley.

539
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,151
- How do you do?
- How are you, Mr Oakley?

540
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,570
Well, Mr Greene, I was thinking
of settling down here for a while.

541
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,363
Great country. Great country.

542
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,866
We think so. What have you been doing?

543
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,744
I suppose you might call me a promoter.
I've done a little bit of everything.

544
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:39,539
The only trouble is that once I make
the money, I'm not interested in it.

545
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:41,291
Not interested in money?

546
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,128
You know there's money just lying around
waiting for somebody to pick it up.

547
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:48,340
I thought maybe I'd put some of
my loose cash away for safekeeping.

548
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:52,010
<i>- In the bank where Joe works, naturally.
- Loose cash?</i>

549
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:55,972
Well, I got in a habit of carrying a lot
of cash with me when I was travelling.

550
00:41:56,181 --> 00:42:00,185
- A dangerous habit.
- Never lost a penny in my life.

551
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,771
I guess heaven takes care
of fools and scoundrels.

552
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:06,650
- Yes.
- Thirty, thirty-five...

553
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,694
Forty thousand.
Shall we start with forty?

554
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:13,824
<i>- If you'll just write out a deposit slip.
- Ah, details.</i>

555
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,577
I'm glad to see you're a man
who understands details, Mr Greene.

556
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:23,166
They're most important to me.
Most important. All the little details.

557
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,877
<i>Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were busy.</i>

558
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:30,715
<i>- We can come back.
- Come in, now that you're here.</i>

559
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:34,135
Mrs Greene,
I'd like you to meet my uncle, Mr Oakley.

560
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:36,888
Uncle Charlie,
this is Mrs Greene and Mrs Potter.

561
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:39,349
Mrs Greene, Miss Potter.

562
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,768
Mrs Potter.

563
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:45,480
- Something about you made me think -
- Yes?

564
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:49,943
- What did you want, Margaret?
- I need some money to go shopping.

565
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:51,945
There's one good thing
in being a widow, isn't there?

566
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:55,740
You don't have to ask
your husband for money.

567
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,285
<i>- Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.</i>

568
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,537
- Goodbye, Mr Oakley.
- Mrs Potter.

569
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,789
Bye, Mrs Greene.

570
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,960
There. There you are, Mr Greene.

571
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:09,671
- Charlie, let's see the town.
- Goodbye, Mr Oakley.

572
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,756
- Bye, Mr Greene.
- Call on us for advice anytime.

573
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,718
- Thank you.
- Joe, you may see Mr Oakley out.

574
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:19,764
Joe, keep your eyes open.
You'll have his job in a couple of years.

575
00:43:30,484 --> 00:43:32,068
Here he is.

576
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:49,127
Those must be the questionnaire men.
They're a whole hour early.

577
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:51,171
I won't see them.

578
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,674
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I'll see that you don't.

579
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:56,718
The way they got around your mother.

580
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:59,471
I thought she'd have better sense.

581
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,727
<i>- How do you do?
- How do you do?</i>

582
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:08,855
- You must have come to interview us.
- My name is Graham, Miss Newton.

583
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:11,149
- Oh, how do you do?
- And this is Fred Saunders.

584
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:13,485
How do you do? Won't you come in?

585
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,987
- I'll call my mother.
- Thank you.

586
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:19,157
<i>Mother, the government men are here.</i>

587
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:21,159
<i>Will you sit down?</i>

588
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:23,537
But you said 4:00. Nothing's ready now.

589
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,872
My husband is still at the bank
and-and the house is -

590
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:28,458
That's all we want now, Mrs Newton,
some pictures of the house.

591
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:31,503
Saunders can get busy
and I'd like to ask a few questions.

592
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:36,258
Alright, but I do wish you'd waited
until I had the house looking its best.

593
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:39,469
<i>I wanted flowers around
and fresh curtains in the kitchen.</i>

594
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:42,430
<i>And there are a lot of things
I don't want you to photograph.</i>

595
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:46,893
<i>- You said you own the house?
- Own it? It owns us.</i>

596
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:50,689
No sooner do I get one thing fixed
than something else gets broken.

597
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:53,024
And then it needs fresh paint and th-

598
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:55,026
<i>Mr Saunders, I'm very sorry</i>

599
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:57,279
<i>but you simply cannot
take a picture with that chair in it.</i>

600
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:01,074
<i>- It needs a new slipcover.
- And there are, uh, six in your family?</i>

601
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:03,702
- Five.
- Five? But -

602
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,745
<i>Well, my uncle ' s just visiting.</i>

603
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:07,789
<i>I told you about him.
He's here from the East.</i>

604
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:11,126
My uncle doesn't want to be bothered
with a lot of questions.

605
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,461
Well, you see, on a survey, we usually -

606
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,463
<i>He's not interested
in a survey</i>

607
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:17,924
<i>and I promised him
he wouldn ' t be bothered.</i>

608
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,926
Well, we'd like it
if we could get all of you.

609
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:22,304
You know, your opinions,
what you do or what you want to do.

610
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:25,682
My uncle's opinions aren't average
and I'm afraid they wouldn't help you.

611
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:29,227
<i>I think when someone asks for privacy,
they should have it.</i>

612
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:32,397
Well, we'll...
The whole idea of this thing is that -

613
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:35,275
Mr Graham, perhaps
you'd better choose another family.

614
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:39,654
We'll do anything you say, of course,
but this family seemed right and -

615
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,656
<i>It is a nice family.</i>

616
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:44,701
Charlie, let the young men go ahead,
so long as they're here.

617
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,162
Well, alright.

618
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,165
OK. Saunders, go ahead
and get another shot.

619
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:54,377
Mrs Newton, what organisations
do you and your husband belong to?

620
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:56,379
How about a picture in the kitchen?

621
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:59,758
Well, I'm afraid the kitchen
isn't quite the way I'd like it.

622
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,010
<i>Come along.</i>

623
00:46:07,516 --> 00:46:09,768
If you'll start by breakin' an egg,
Mrs Newton.

624
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,686
Oh, but you don't start a cake
by breaking an egg.

625
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:13,980
You have to put
the butter and sugar in first.

626
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:18,109
Survey or no survey,
I'm not going to start by breaking an egg.

627
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:21,988
<i>I thought I'd make a maple cake.
My brother Charles loves maple cake.</i>

628
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:25,367
What does your brother do?
I guess he just does about everything.

629
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:29,371
What does he do? He's just in business.
You know, the way men are.

630
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:34,125
My husband works in a bank,
but I think Charles is just in business.

631
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:37,629
<i>If you really want a picture
of me breaking an egg,</i>

632
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:40,632
you'll have to wait
till I cream the butter and sugar.

633
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,634
I'll wait.

634
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:44,803
I wonder if we could
take a look upstairs.

635
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,805
You show us, and your mother can call us
when she's ready.

636
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,933
- Alright.
- If you'd rather wait, Mr Saunders.

637
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,811
Folding in the eggs
has to be done just right.

638
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,813
<i>I can ' t beat them and let them stand.</i>

639
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:57,315
The minute I hear you've
broken the eggs, I'll come right down.

640
00:46:57,524 --> 00:46:58,525
Yes.

641
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:08,034
I really don't see
what you want to look up here for.

642
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:11,538
Whose room is that? It's mine.
My uncle's using it now, though.

643
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:15,417
I'd like to see what your room looks like.
Typical girl, typical room.

644
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,128
Typical of you to ask.
My uncle's resting.

645
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,422
I really don't want to disturb him.

646
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:24,968
- Is there a back stairs?
- Mm-hm. Right down the hall.

647
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:27,721
I'll bet you 50 cents
that your uncle isn't in there.

648
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,723
Oh, betting's silly.

649
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:32,684
All you want to do
is photograph my room, doesn't he?

650
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:35,770
- That's it.
- Besides, I know my uncle's in there.

651
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:38,482
Alright, I'll still bet he isn't.
Let me knock and see.

652
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,193
Oh, I'll knock.

653
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:43,987
Uncle Charlie?

654
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:46,490
Uncle Charlie, may we come in?

655
00:47:52,204 --> 00:47:54,748
- See?
- You were right.

656
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,667
Nice room. Do you mind if I take a picture
since he isn't here?

657
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:00,712
- I don't want to disturb your uncle.
- Oh, I suppose so.

658
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:04,508
But I really can't imagine
anyone being interested in my room.

659
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:09,471
It's not the way I'd like it.
I'd like to have it yellow and white.

660
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:11,473
Might as well let him work in peace.

661
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:15,268
Besides, I'd like to talk to you.

662
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:19,314
Your picking us as an average family
gave me a funny feeling.

663
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:23,360
- What kind of a funny feeling?
- Oh, I don't know.

664
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:26,279
I guess I don't like to be and average girl
in an average family.

665
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:28,406
Average families are the best.
Look at me.

666
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:30,909
<i>- I'm from an average family.
- As average as ours?</i>

667
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:33,286
Sure.
Besides, I don't think you're average.

668
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:37,791
Oh, that's because you see me now
instead of a few days ago.

669
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:43,255
I was in the dumps. Then Uncle Charlie
came and everything changed.

670
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:46,341
But your mother said he came last night.
Maybe you just think -

671
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,261
I don't think. I know.

672
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:54,641
Funny, but when I think about how I feel,
I always come back to Uncle Charlie.

673
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:58,854
Are you trying to tell me
I shouldn't think he's so wonderful?

674
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:03,608
<i>- Oh, no. I -
- Mr Saunders?</i>

675
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:07,445
<i>- I'm ready with the eggs.
- Mr Saunders mustn't move anything.</i>

676
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:11,283
<i>- My uncle's awfully neat and fussy.
- Saunders is neat and fussy, too.</i>

677
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:19,583
<i>- Is this your uncle?
- Yes, it is.</i>

678
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:26,256
Now, for one of the hall.

679
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:30,677
<i>Mr Saunders has been
taking pictures of my room.</i>

680
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:35,056
My sister told me to remind you
about eggs and a cake.

681
00:49:35,265 --> 00:49:38,310
I don't like to be photographed.
I'll have to ask you for the film.

682
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:41,646
- Oh, Uncle Charlie.
- Give it to me, please.

683
00:49:41,855 --> 00:49:44,316
Give it to him, Fred.

684
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:48,737
That's too bad. There's a picture
of Mrs Newton on this film.

685
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:59,498
<i>- Excuse me.
- The eggs are ready.</i>

686
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:02,417
<i>I can't let them stand another minute.</i>

687
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,006
That was my last roll of film.

688
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:10,509
Mr Saunders took
Uncle Charlie's picture by mistake

689
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,386
and Uncle Charlie made him
give him back the roll.

690
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:16,223
He wasn't joking
about not wanting to be photographed.

691
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,183
We didn't want to start a family feud.

692
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:20,185
I'll get you
making the cake again tomorrow.

693
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:22,729
I won't be
making a cake again tomorrow.

694
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:26,399
I want to help an important work,
but I cannot go on making cakes.

695
00:50:26,608 --> 00:50:29,444
You have helped, Mrs Newton.

696
00:50:29,653 --> 00:50:31,446
And now I'd like to ask another favour.

697
00:50:31,655 --> 00:50:34,866
Could I borrow your daughter?
I'd like to look around the town.

698
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:37,869
- Ann?
- Charlie.

699
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:42,040
Ann would be better.
Ann knows everything about everybody.

700
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:46,002
- Charlie.
- Well, if, uh, Charlie doesn't mind.

701
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:48,713
- I don't mind.
- Swell.

702
00:50:55,554 --> 00:50:56,847
- Goodbye, then, Mrs Newton.
- Goodbye.

703
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:59,349
- 6:30?
- 6:30.

704
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:00,559
- OK. Goodbye.
- Bye.

705
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,435
- Bye, Mr Saunders.
- Bye.

706
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:04,312
Goodbye.

707
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,983
He seems like a nice young man.

708
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:10,944
But I thought you were
going to the movies with Catherine.

709
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:13,989
Oh, I'll tell her
I don't feel well or something.

710
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,091
- Hello, Charlie.
- Well... hello, Catherine. Hello, Shirley.

711
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,554
- Hello.
- This is Jack Graham. He's in town.

712
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,556
- How do you do?
- Hello.

713
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:44,186
- How's your throat, Charlie?
- Oh, much better. Thank you.

714
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:46,438
Bill Forest was asking about you.

715
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:49,065
Oh. Bill Forest?

716
00:51:49,274 --> 00:51:51,359
Well, uh... goodbye.

717
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,612
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

718
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:04,206
I know what you are, really.

719
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:07,918
You're a detective. There's something
the matter and you're a detective.

720
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:10,545
- Charlie, listen.
- I don't want to listen.

721
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:12,214
Why, you're not on a survey at all.

722
00:52:12,422 --> 00:52:14,216
You lied to us. You lied to Mother.

723
00:52:14,424 --> 00:52:17,552
You just wanted to get in our house.
Police.

724
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:19,513
That's what it is.

725
00:52:19,721 --> 00:52:22,891
What do you want with us?
Why are you here, lying to us?

726
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:25,060
Look, Charlie, you've got to listen to me.
You've got to trust me.

727
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:27,062
When you've done nothing but lie?

728
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,940
And you probably didn't want to
take me out at all the way I thought.

729
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:32,108
You just wanted to ask me
a lot of questions.

730
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:35,111
Have I asked you a lot of questions?
Have I?

731
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,657
Alright, I'm a detective.
A pretty bad one.

732
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:40,659
Now, won't you even listen to me?

733
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:43,119
- Why should I when you lied to me?
- I had to.

734
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:45,997
When I came here to find a man,
I hadn't counted on you.

735
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:49,960
- I hadn't counted on your family.
- Find a man? What man?

736
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:52,629
There's a man loose in this country.
We're after him.

737
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:56,132
We don't know much.
We don't even know what he looks like.

738
00:52:56,341 --> 00:53:00,303
Charlie, think. How much
do you know about your uncle?

739
00:53:00,512 --> 00:53:04,599
Why, he's my mother's brother.
What's he got to do with it?

740
00:53:04,808 --> 00:53:06,768
This man we want may be your uncle.

741
00:53:06,977 --> 00:53:10,605
Oh, I don't believe you.
Go away and leave me alone.

742
00:53:10,814 --> 00:53:14,234
We're after one man.
Your uncle may be that man.

743
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:17,821
But in the East, there's another man
who's being hunted too,

744
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:20,407
through Massachusetts and into Maine.
He may be the one.

745
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:22,826
My uncle hasn't done anything.

746
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:25,745
He knows it would kill
my mother if he did.

747
00:53:25,954 --> 00:53:29,624
He's her younger brother,
just like Roger is mine.

748
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,710
Why don't they arrest
that man in the East?

749
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:35,130
<i>Why don't you go away
and leave us alone?</i>

750
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:38,300
Charlie, when we were eating tonight
and talking about our folks

751
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:41,928
and what we'd done and how we felt,
we were like two ordinary people.

752
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:44,055
We'd been brought up about the same.

753
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:48,143
<i>- You liked me and I liked you.
- Oh, it doesn't matter now.</i>

754
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:51,480
What do you mean, "It doesn't matter"?
It's the only thing that does.

755
00:53:51,688 --> 00:53:53,899
<i>If it weren't for you,
you don't think I ' d care</i>

756
00:53:54,107 --> 00:53:56,026
<i>how or where I caught up
with your uncle, do you?</i>

757
00:53:56,234 --> 00:54:00,447
Because if he's the guy, I'm going to
catch up with him. Remember that.

758
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:02,824
<i>And you're going to keep
your mouth shut.</i>

759
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:05,702
<i>You're going to keep your mouth shut
because you're such a nice girl</i>

760
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:09,581
you'd help if you knew
your uncle was the man we wanted.

761
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:12,542
<i>- I wouldn't help you.
- And I know you would.</i>

762
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:15,045
And I'm trying to make it easier for you.

763
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:18,256
If your uncle's the man we want,
we'll get him out of town quietly.

764
00:54:18,465 --> 00:54:21,218
<i>- We won't arrest him here.
- Arrest him here? With mother -</i>

765
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:24,262
<i>I'm trying to tell you we won ' t.</i>

766
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:30,185
- Please, Charlie.
- I won't say anything.

767
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:32,771
Oh, take me home!

768
00:54:46,618 --> 00:54:48,453
Good night, Charlie.

769
00:54:48,662 --> 00:54:51,665
It's going to be funny
when you find out you're wrong.

770
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:54,209
Good night.

771
00:55:26,408 --> 00:55:28,368
<i>- Hello, Charlie. Home already?
- Oh, yes, Dad.</i>

772
00:55:28,577 --> 00:55:31,621
It's so nice out, I thought
I'd get some air before I went to bed.

773
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,125
You better run in. Your Uncle Charlie's
been asking about you.

774
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,294
I think I'll just go up the back way.

775
00:55:37,502 --> 00:55:39,296
I- I'm tired and I don't feel like talking.

776
00:55:39,504 --> 00:55:41,882
Alright. Suit yourself.

777
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:43,842
- Take care of yourself.
- Mm-hm.

778
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,886
- Good night, Herb.
- Good night, Charlie.

779
00:55:46,094 --> 00:55:47,679
Good night, Charlie.

780
00:55:47,888 --> 00:55:50,724
What were we saying, Herb?
Did I notice what?

781
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:52,684
Well, did you taste anything funny

782
00:55:52,893 --> 00:55:54,978
about that coffee you had
at my house this evening?

783
00:55:55,187 --> 00:55:57,230
No. It tasted all right.

784
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,483
That's what I mean. It wasn't all right.

785
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:02,360
- Put something in it?
- Put a little soda.

786
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:05,989
About the same amount that I'd have used
if I'd wanted to use poison.

787
00:56:06,198 --> 00:56:08,617
Well, you don't say?
I never tasted a thing.

788
00:56:08,825 --> 00:56:11,745
Of course, I might not notice the soda.

789
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:15,582
You'd notice the soda more
than you would the poison.

790
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,876
For all you knew, you might
just as well be dead now.

791
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:51,159
- Aren't you asleep yet, Ann?
- Uh-uh.

792
00:57:03,088 --> 00:57:05,298
Charlotte, what are you doing?

793
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:08,301
Oh, I'm just looking for a recipe
I thought I saw,

794
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:11,012
but it's just so torn up.

795
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:14,307
They have papers in the "libarry",
new ones and old ones.

796
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:16,268
Miss Corcoran will get them out for you.

797
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:19,980
She won't even notice
if you cut out a little, bitty recipe.

798
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:22,440
Oh, it's not that important.

799
00:57:23,692 --> 00:57:25,068
What time does the library close?

800
00:57:25,277 --> 00:57:30,407
If you read as much as you should,
you'd know it closes at 9:00.

801
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:35,787
Oh, well.
If I think about it, maybe I'll go tomorrow.

802
00:57:35,996 --> 00:57:38,498
You really ought to go to sleep, Ann.

803
00:58:23,752 --> 00:58:26,630
Get back there!
Get back! Get back!

804
00:58:37,641 --> 00:58:40,519
Just a moment, Charlie.
What do you think I am out here for?

805
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:42,646
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Norton.

806
00:58:42,854 --> 00:58:44,898
Alright. Go ahead.

807
00:59:25,522 --> 00:59:28,191
Oh! Miss Corcoran, please let me in.

808
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:30,402
Oh, please!

809
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:34,781
Oh, thank you.

810
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:37,909
Really, Charlie. You know as well as I do
the library closes at 9:00.

811
00:59:38,118 --> 00:59:40,036
If I make one exception,
I'll have to make a thousand.

812
00:59:40,245 --> 00:59:43,915
I'm sorry, Mrs Corcoran, but there is something
in the paper I've got to see.

813
00:59:44,124 --> 00:59:46,459
I'm surprised at you, Charlie.
No consideration.

814
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:49,337
- Oh, I'll only be a minute.
- You've got all day to come here.

815
00:59:49,546 --> 00:59:52,090
I don't know why you want
to rush in here tonight like a madwoman.

816
00:59:52,299 --> 00:59:54,843
I'll give you just three minutes.

817
01:00:11,193 --> 01:00:14,738
Can't be anything really awful.

818
01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:17,616
I'll prove to him it isn't.

819
01:00:18,992 --> 01:00:21,077
Page three -

820
01:01:58,258 --> 01:01:59,885
Hello.

821
01:02:00,093 --> 01:02:04,431
- Where's Charlie?
- Still asleep. I don't want to wake her.

822
01:02:14,566 --> 01:02:16,943
- Charlie still asleep?
- No, she just woke up.

823
01:02:17,152 --> 01:02:20,864
I shouldn't have let her sleep so long,
but she needed it.

824
01:02:21,072 --> 01:02:24,659
She doesn't look quite herself.
She'll be down for dinner.

825
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:48,058
Mother, let me finish mashing those.

826
01:02:48,266 --> 01:02:51,144
I'll fix the rest of dinner
and get it on the table.

827
01:02:51,353 --> 01:02:52,604
You go talk to Uncle Charlie.

828
01:02:52,813 --> 01:02:54,564
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

829
01:02:54,773 --> 01:02:57,192
I must have been tired. I slept like a log.

830
01:02:57,484 --> 01:03:00,654
Uncle Charlie was asking for you again.
He's fond of you.

831
01:03:00,862 --> 01:03:06,451
That nice young man came to ask
after you. I told him you were asleep.

832
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:11,581
<i>I'm rested now. Is the gravy made?</i>

833
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:17,504
Now you're humming that waltz.
Please don't hum that tune anymore.

834
01:03:17,712 --> 01:03:20,632
I've just got it out of my head
and don't want it started again.

835
01:03:20,841 --> 01:03:23,343
Please remember, don't hum that tune.

836
01:03:23,552 --> 01:03:25,804
And don't keep getting up
every few minutes.

837
01:03:26,012 --> 01:03:27,556
You just sit there and be a real lady.

838
01:03:27,764 --> 01:03:32,018
Alright, if you say so,
but at least I can carry in the soup.

839
01:03:32,227 --> 01:03:37,899
Roger, wash your hands!
Joe. Charles. Dinner.

840
01:03:39,526 --> 01:03:44,447
- Mama -
- Ann, don't put things behind your ear.

841
01:03:44,656 --> 01:03:47,742
And don't whisper.
Anyone could hear you a block away.

842
01:03:47,951 --> 01:03:49,494
May I sit by you at the table?

843
01:03:49,703 --> 01:03:52,706
<i>By me? I should think
you'd want to sit by Uncle Charlie.</i>

844
01:03:52,914 --> 01:03:56,126
<i>- No, I want to sit by you.
- Why do you want to change?</i>

845
01:03:56,334 --> 01:03:58,128
Mother, let her change if she wants to.

846
01:03:58,336 --> 01:04:00,380
Roger doesn't mind.

847
01:04:00,589 --> 01:04:04,551
No, certainly not.
Uncle Charlie might think... Certainly not.

848
01:04:04,759 --> 01:04:09,347
- Mother, let her change.
- OK, but Ann has some foolish ideas.

849
01:04:09,556 --> 01:04:13,185
Go in the dining room, both of you.

850
01:04:20,525 --> 01:04:23,487
What's going on here?
Have I lost my little girl?

851
01:04:23,695 --> 01:04:26,031
<i>Roger wanted to sit next to you,</i>

852
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:29,242
and I thought it would be nice
if the children took turns.

853
01:04:29,451 --> 01:04:31,077
- I never...
- Never what, Roger?

854
01:04:31,286 --> 01:04:35,582
- Nothing.
- Come, Ann. Come and help me.

855
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:40,879
Joe! I brought it in by mistake.
Nothing special in it.

856
01:04:41,087 --> 01:04:44,382
- Want to look at the headlines, Charles?
- Thank you, Joe.

857
01:04:46,426 --> 01:04:49,137
<i>Roger, don't make so much noise
with your soup.</i>

858
01:04:49,346 --> 01:04:53,767
<i>If he holds his lips together, he
could draw it carefully, like a horse.</i>

859
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:56,770
<i>- Don't be disgusting.
- May I dip my bread in it?</i>

860
01:04:56,978 --> 01:04:59,856
<i>- Where's Charlie?
- She wanted to serve dinner.</i>

861
01:05:00,065 --> 01:05:03,693
<i>- She ' II be in in a minute.
- You're right, Joe.</i>

862
01:05:03,902 --> 01:05:07,030
Nothing special tonight. Oh, here she is!

863
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:10,075
<i>- Here ' s my girl.
- How many hours did you sleep?</i>

864
01:05:10,283 --> 01:05:13,036
If you could tell me
the exact minute you went to sleep,

865
01:05:13,245 --> 01:05:16,456
the exact minute you woke up,
if you woke up in between

866
01:05:16,665 --> 01:05:19,459
and how long you stayed awake
each time you woke up,

867
01:05:19,668 --> 01:05:21,419
then I could tell you exactly -

868
01:05:21,628 --> 01:05:25,257
You won't sleep tonight.
Nobody who sleeps all day can.

869
01:05:25,465 --> 01:05:28,301
I slept all right, and I kept dreaming,

870
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:32,222
perfect nightmares
about you, Uncle Charlie.

871
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:33,557
Nightmares about me?

872
01:05:33,765 --> 01:05:39,479
You were on a train,
running away from something

873
01:05:39,688 --> 01:05:43,191
and when I saw you on the train,
I felt terribly happy.

874
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,611
<i>How could you feel happy
seeing Uncle Charlie on a train?</i>

875
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:50,365
I don't want to see him on a train.
I hope he stays here forever.

876
01:05:50,574 --> 01:05:55,620
Well, he has to leave sometime.
We have to face the facts.

877
01:05:55,829 --> 01:05:58,373
I like people who face facts.

878
01:05:58,582 --> 01:06:01,960
Well, we're not going
to face any such facts as those.

879
01:06:03,503 --> 01:06:06,339
Oh, Ann,
would you like to see the funnies?

880
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:10,802
I'm too old for funnies. I read two books
a week. I took a sacred oath I would.

881
01:06:11,011 --> 01:06:14,598
Besides, no one's allowed to read
at the table. It isn't polite.

882
01:06:14,806 --> 01:06:16,433
Don't correct your elders!

883
01:06:16,641 --> 01:06:18,685
She's right, Emmy.
I'm forgetting my manners.

884
01:06:18,894 --> 01:06:21,771
Joe, I'm going to blame this paper on you.

885
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:27,110
Roger, go to the icebox and bring me
a big, red bottle you'll find there.

886
01:06:27,319 --> 01:06:30,447
You can throw the paper away.
Dad's read it, you've read it.

887
01:06:30,655 --> 01:06:33,200
We don't need to play any
games with it tonight.

888
01:06:33,408 --> 01:06:35,869
<i>Ann, you can help
Charlie carry the vegetables.</i>

889
01:06:36,077 --> 01:06:38,872
<i>I saw that bottle
when I was getting dinner.</i>

890
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:43,043
St Paul said, "Take a little wine
for thy stomach's sake. "

891
01:06:43,251 --> 01:06:45,128
Wine for dinner sounds so gay!

892
01:06:45,337 --> 01:06:49,966
Remember they had the champagne
when the oldest Jones girl got married?

893
01:06:50,175 --> 01:06:51,510
This is sparkling burgundy.

894
01:06:51,718 --> 01:06:56,223
One sip and I'll be calling it
"sparkling burgledy. "

895
01:06:56,431 --> 01:06:58,558
<i>Maybe I'd better not take any.</i>

896
01:06:58,767 --> 01:07:01,102
Oh... imported.

897
01:07:01,311 --> 01:07:03,814
Imported Frankie and his tweeds?

898
01:07:04,022 --> 01:07:06,066
And his loaded cane.

899
01:07:06,274 --> 01:07:08,360
His loaded everything!

900
01:07:13,657 --> 01:07:18,161
<i>Roger, go get four
of the small glasses with stems.</i>

901
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:23,959
<i>Charles, I promised Mrs Greene of our
club that you'd talk to the ladies.</i>

902
01:07:24,167 --> 01:07:28,755
What am I going to talk about?
Travel or current events?

903
01:07:28,964 --> 01:07:31,091
<i>Oh, not current events.
We get current events.</i>

904
01:07:31,299 --> 01:07:33,343
<i>Who'll my audience be?</i>

905
01:07:33,552 --> 01:07:36,805
Oh, women like myself.
Busy with our homes, most of us.

906
01:07:37,013 --> 01:07:39,224
<i>Women keep busy in towns like this.</i>

907
01:07:39,432 --> 01:07:44,646
In the cities it's different.
Middle-aged widows, husbands dead,

908
01:07:44,855 --> 01:07:49,776
<i>husbands who ' ve spent their lives
making fortunes, working and working,</i>

909
01:07:49,985 --> 01:07:54,197
<i>and then they die and leave their money
to their wives, their silly wives.</i>

910
01:07:54,406 --> 01:07:57,993
And what do the wives do,
these useless women?

911
01:07:58,201 --> 01:08:02,747
You see them in the best hotels
every day by the thousands,

912
01:08:02,956 --> 01:08:05,250
drinking the money, eating the money,

913
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:08,503
losing the money at bridge,
playing all day and all night,

914
01:08:08,712 --> 01:08:10,672
smelling of money.

915
01:08:10,881 --> 01:08:14,467
Proud of their jewellery,
but of nothing else.

916
01:08:14,676 --> 01:08:19,306
Horrible, faded, fat, greedy women.

917
01:08:19,514 --> 01:08:22,851
<i>But they're alive! They're human beings.</i>

918
01:08:23,059 --> 01:08:26,104
Are they? Are they, Charlie?

919
01:08:26,313 --> 01:08:30,525
<i>Are they human,
or are they fat, wheezing animals? Hm?</i>

920
01:08:30,734 --> 01:08:35,030
And what happens to animals when
they get too fat and too old?

921
01:08:35,238 --> 01:08:37,782
Well, I seem to be making
my speech right here.

922
01:08:37,991 --> 01:08:43,747
Don't talk about women like that
in front of my club! You'll be lynched.

923
01:08:43,955 --> 01:08:48,960
That nice Mrs Potter's going to be there.
She was asking me about you.

924
01:08:49,169 --> 01:08:54,216
The Greenes are bringing her here to
the party I'm having for you afterwards.

925
01:08:54,508 --> 01:08:56,468
<i>Joe, it's Herbert.</i>

926
01:08:56,676 --> 01:08:59,262
He always comes when we're eating.

927
01:09:01,223 --> 01:09:04,351
<i>Good evening, Mrs Newton.</i>

928
01:09:04,559 --> 01:09:06,978
- Good evening, Mr Oakley.
- Good evening.

929
01:09:07,187 --> 01:09:09,856
<i>Well, Herb, how's your mother?</i>

930
01:09:10,023 --> 01:09:12,067
Oh, she's just middling.

931
01:09:13,193 --> 01:09:16,988
- Had your dinner?
- Oh, I had mine an hour ago.

932
01:09:17,197 --> 01:09:21,785
You folks are getting pretty stylish.
Having dinner later every evening.

933
01:09:21,993 --> 01:09:23,870
<i>Ha ha!</i>

934
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:30,502
<i>- Joe.
- Huh?</i>

935
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:36,299
- Joe, I-I picked some mushrooms.
- You don't say?

936
01:09:36,508 --> 01:09:39,177
Mushrooms mean anything to you, Joe?

937
01:09:39,386 --> 01:09:44,558
I eat 'em on my steak when I'm out
and the meat's not good enough as it is.

938
01:09:44,766 --> 01:09:46,893
If I brought you some mushrooms,
would you eat 'em?

939
01:09:47,102 --> 01:09:48,895
Suppose I would. Why?

940
01:09:49,104 --> 01:09:54,109
Then I've got it. The worst I'd be
accused of would be manslaughter.

941
01:09:54,317 --> 01:09:58,029
Doubt if I'd get that.
Accidental death, pure and simple.

942
01:09:58,238 --> 01:10:02,617
A basket of good mushrooms and...
two or three poisonous ones.

943
01:10:02,826 --> 01:10:07,622
No, no. Innocent party might
get the poisonous ones.

944
01:10:07,831 --> 01:10:10,208
I thought of something better
when I was shaving.

945
01:10:10,417 --> 01:10:15,505
A bath tub. Pull the legs out
from under you, hold you down.

946
01:10:18,383 --> 01:10:20,302
<i>Oh, what's the matter with you two?</i>

947
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:22,971
Do you always have to
talk about killing people?

948
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,140
We're not talking about killing people.

949
01:10:25,348 --> 01:10:28,310
Herb's talking about killing me,
and I'm talking about killing him.

950
01:10:28,518 --> 01:10:30,437
It's your father's way of relaxing.

951
01:10:30,645 --> 01:10:32,731
Can't he find some other way to relax?

952
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:37,569
Can't we have a little peace and quiet
without dragging in poisons all the time?

953
01:10:37,777 --> 01:10:40,739
<i>Charlie!
She doesn ' t make sense talking like that.</i>

954
01:10:40,947 --> 01:10:43,241
<i>I'm worried about her.
Roger, bring her back.</i>

955
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:47,537
I'll go. You stay and finish dinner.
I'll catch up with her.

956
01:10:47,746 --> 01:10:50,290
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

957
01:11:02,177 --> 01:11:06,264
- Excuse me, Mr Norton.
- You're always running around at night.

958
01:11:06,473 --> 01:11:10,227
- Where were you hurrying to last night?
- Just doing an errand.

959
01:11:10,435 --> 01:11:13,688
- Is this your uncle I've heard about?
- Yes.

960
01:11:13,897 --> 01:11:17,150
- Uncle Charlie, Mr Norton.
- Glad to know you. What's the name?

961
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:19,611
Oakley. Charles Oakley. Nice to meet you.

962
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:24,157
Better keep your eye on your niece.
I'll have to give her a ticket for speeding.

963
01:11:24,366 --> 01:11:27,619
- City ordinance about running.
- Hear that, Charlie?

964
01:11:27,828 --> 01:11:30,330
Don't want to break the law.
I'll take care of her.

965
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:32,833
- Good night.
- Good night.

966
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:36,253
What's the matter, Charlie?
What's wrong?

967
01:11:45,887 --> 01:11:48,473
- I want to talk to you.
- You're hurting my arm again.

968
01:11:48,682 --> 01:11:51,643
- Come in here with me.
- I can't. I don't go to places like this.

969
01:11:51,852 --> 01:11:53,895
Go on in.

970
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,995
- Why'd you bring me here?
- What does it matter where we are?

971
01:12:10,203 --> 01:12:11,997
Hello, Charlie. Hello.

972
01:12:12,205 --> 01:12:16,209
Hello, Louise.
Uncle Charlie, Louise Finch.

973
01:12:16,418 --> 01:12:20,922
- This is my uncle.
- I was in Charlie's class in school.

974
01:12:21,131 --> 01:12:25,218
I sure was surprised to see you come in.
I never thought I'd see you here.

975
01:12:25,427 --> 01:12:29,347
I been here two weeks.
Lost my job over at Kern's.

976
01:12:29,556 --> 01:12:33,435
I've been in half the restaurants in town.
What'll you have, Charlie?

977
01:12:33,643 --> 01:12:38,857
- Nothing, thank you.
- A ginger ale for her, a brandy for me.

978
01:12:39,065 --> 01:12:42,527
- Well, Charlie?
- Well?

979
01:12:42,736 --> 01:12:46,698
Think you know something, don't you?
That young fellow told you something.

980
01:12:46,907 --> 01:12:49,659
Jack?
Why should he know anything about you?

981
01:12:51,286 --> 01:12:57,042
Charlie, something's come between us.
I don't want that to happen.

982
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:00,003
Why, we're old friends.

983
01:13:01,087 --> 01:13:05,217
More than that. We're like twins.

984
01:13:05,425 --> 01:13:08,678
- You said so yourself.
- Don't touch me, Uncle Charlie.

985
01:13:11,389 --> 01:13:13,183
What did that boy tell you?

986
01:13:13,391 --> 01:13:19,856
He's got nothing to do with it. I hope
he never knows anything about you.

987
01:13:20,065 --> 01:13:25,070
Charlie,
you're a pretty understanding sort of girl.

988
01:13:28,073 --> 01:13:30,742
If you've heard
some little things about me,

989
01:13:30,909 --> 01:13:35,580
I guess you're a woman of the world
enough to overlook them.

990
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:42,462
You're the head of your family, Charlie.
Anyone can see that.

991
01:13:42,671 --> 01:13:48,218
I'm not so old. I've been chasing
around the globe since I was sixteen.

992
01:13:50,262 --> 01:13:52,639
<i>I guess I've done
some pretty foolish things,</i>

993
01:13:52,848 --> 01:13:55,350
made some pretty foolish mistakes.

994
01:13:55,559 --> 01:13:59,271
<i>Nothing serious, just... foolish.</i>

995
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:19,958
Oh, Charlie, now,
don't start imagining things.

996
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:25,338
How could you do such things?
You're my uncle,

997
01:14:25,547 --> 01:14:27,257
<i>my mother's brother.</i>

998
01:14:27,465 --> 01:14:31,178
We thought you were
the most wonderful man in the world.

999
01:14:31,386 --> 01:14:34,973
- The most wonderful and the best.
- Charlie, what do you know?

1000
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:46,610
I'm sorry I was so long.
We're awful busy.

1001
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:52,157
Whose is it? Ain't it beautiful?

1002
01:14:54,534 --> 01:14:57,204
I'd just die for a ring like that.

1003
01:14:57,454 --> 01:15:01,291
Yes sir, for a ring like that,
I'd just about die.

1004
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,753
I love jewellery, real jewellery.

1005
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:09,508
Notice I didn't even have to ask
if it was real. You can tell.

1006
01:15:09,716 --> 01:15:12,469
- I can.
- Bring me another brandy.

1007
01:15:14,304 --> 01:15:16,431
Sit down.

1008
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,683
Sit down!

1009
01:15:22,521 --> 01:15:25,607
You think you know something,
don't you?

1010
01:15:25,816 --> 01:15:28,819
You think you're the clever little girl
who knows something.

1011
01:15:29,027 --> 01:15:32,823
There's so much you don't know.
So much.

1012
01:15:33,031 --> 01:15:34,699
What do you know, really?

1013
01:15:34,908 --> 01:15:38,829
You're just an ordinary little girl
living in an ordinary little town.

1014
01:15:39,037 --> 01:15:43,166
You wake up every day and know there's
nothing in the world to trouble you.

1015
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:46,044
You go through your ordinary little day.

1016
01:15:46,211 --> 01:15:52,050
At night, you sleep your ordinary sleep
filled with peaceful, stupid dreams.

1017
01:15:53,635 --> 01:15:56,012
And I brought you nightmares.

1018
01:15:57,639 --> 01:16:01,101
Or did I?
Or was it a silly, inexpert, little lie?

1019
01:16:01,309 --> 01:16:04,604
You live in a dream.
You're a sleepwalker, blind.

1020
01:16:04,813 --> 01:16:07,274
How do you know
what the world is like?

1021
01:16:07,482 --> 01:16:10,360
Do you know the world is a foul sty?

1022
01:16:10,569 --> 01:16:14,990
<i>Do you know if you ripped
the fronts off houses, you'd find swine?</i>

1023
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:17,534
The world's a hell.
What does it matter what happens in it?

1024
01:16:17,742 --> 01:16:21,288
<i>Wake up, Charlie.
Use your wits. Learn something!</i>

1025
01:16:21,496 --> 01:16:23,373
You goin', Charlie?

1026
01:16:43,477 --> 01:16:46,396
- Charlie, will you help me?
- Help you?

1027
01:16:46,605 --> 01:16:51,943
The same blood flows through our veins.
I was at the end of my rope.

1028
01:16:53,445 --> 01:16:57,741
Oh, I'm so tired. There's an end
to the running a man can do.

1029
01:16:57,949 --> 01:17:01,786
You'll never know what it's like
to be so tired. I was going to...

1030
01:17:04,164 --> 01:17:09,961
Then I got the idea of coming out here.
It's my last chance, Charlie.

1031
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:12,714
Give it to me.

1032
01:17:13,798 --> 01:17:15,717
Graham and the other fellow,
they don't know.

1033
01:17:15,926 --> 01:17:19,930
There's a man in the east they suspect,
and if they get him, I'll...

1034
01:17:20,138 --> 01:17:23,600
Charlie, give me this last chance.

1035
01:17:23,809 --> 01:17:26,228
Take your chance. Go!

1036
01:17:26,436 --> 01:17:29,189
I'll go, Charlie. Just give me a few days.

1037
01:17:29,397 --> 01:17:31,900
Think of your mother.
It'll kill your mother.

1038
01:17:32,108 --> 01:17:35,362
Yes, it would kill my mother.

1039
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:38,824
Take your few days.
See that you get away from here.

1040
01:17:39,032 --> 01:17:42,160
You realise what it'll mean
if they get me?

1041
01:17:42,369 --> 01:17:44,329
The electric chair.

1042
01:17:44,538 --> 01:17:48,041
Charlie, you've got to help me.

1043
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:53,421
You said yourself we're no ordinary uncle
and niece, no matter what I've done.

1044
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:56,842
You go in. I'll be in in a minute.

1045
01:18:11,565 --> 01:18:14,276
<i>- Home, sweet home.
- Where's Charlie?</i>

1046
01:18:14,484 --> 01:18:17,362
<i>- She's outside. Don't worry about her.
- What was the matter?</i>

1047
01:18:17,571 --> 01:18:21,950
<i>She was a little edgy. I persuaded her
to go for a walk. She's calmer now.</i>

1048
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:27,414
<i>- I'm so glad. I've saved dessert for you.
- We had an ice-cream soda.</i>

1049
01:18:27,622 --> 01:18:32,627
Oops-a-daisy! Off to bed you go!

1050
01:18:55,901 --> 01:18:58,570
<i>- Roger, come here!
- No!</i>

1051
01:19:03,241 --> 01:19:06,870
There's my girl. Psst! Ann!

1052
01:19:07,078 --> 01:19:10,123
Hello!
You must be trying to hide or something.

1053
01:19:10,332 --> 01:19:14,377
- We're not hiding.
- People who are hiding say "psst".

1054
01:19:14,586 --> 01:19:17,172
- We just don't want to yell on Sunday.
- Look, Ann.

1055
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:22,010
Ask your sister to run over here.
Just ask her quietly. We'll wait here.

1056
01:19:22,219 --> 01:19:25,722
- Did my father have a feud with yours?
- My father?

1057
01:19:25,931 --> 01:19:29,893
Because if they didn't, there's no sense
in my asking Charlotte quietly.

1058
01:19:30,101 --> 01:19:33,563
Mama won't care. She thinks
girls ought to marry and settle down.

1059
01:19:33,772 --> 01:19:36,233
- In a book I'm reading -
- Just ask her, Ann. Don't be literary.

1060
01:19:36,441 --> 01:19:39,277
- Alright.
- Remember, I'm doing all the talking.

1061
01:19:46,326 --> 01:19:47,953
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

1062
01:19:48,161 --> 01:19:50,497
Good morning, Mr Graham.

1063
01:19:50,705 --> 01:19:53,667
Catherine, this is Mr Saunders.

1064
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:56,211
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1065
01:19:56,419 --> 01:19:59,798
- Ann says you want to speak to me.
- Saunders wants to.

1066
01:20:00,006 --> 01:20:03,468
Come on, Ann.
Tell Catherine the story of Dracula.

1067
01:20:03,677 --> 01:20:05,720
Come on, Catherine.

1068
01:20:07,556 --> 01:20:11,768
- What do you want?
- Let them get a little bit ahead.

1069
01:20:17,315 --> 01:20:21,444
It's about that photograph we took,
the one of your uncle.

1070
01:20:21,653 --> 01:20:24,990
- He probably burned it.
- Not that one, he hasn't.

1071
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:27,409
We gave him the wrong film.

1072
01:20:27,617 --> 01:20:29,828
We got the picture alright.
We wired it East.

1073
01:20:30,036 --> 01:20:32,956
They've got witnesses can identify
the man we want from that picture.

1074
01:20:33,165 --> 01:20:35,542
- What do you mean, identify him?
- Just what I said.

1075
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:38,920
When the witnesses see that picture,
we'll know whether Oakley's the man.

1076
01:20:39,129 --> 01:20:42,132
- We're waiting for the wire now.
- And then Uncle Charlie will be -

1077
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:45,635
That's right. That's the way it is.

1078
01:20:48,305 --> 01:20:53,268
Graham thought you could get your uncle
to leave town now. It would be better -

1079
01:20:53,477 --> 01:20:56,771
I've got to, haven't I? I've got to!
What's the most time you'll give me?

1080
01:20:57,397 --> 01:21:00,901
- Two hours.
- I'll make him leave!

1081
01:21:01,109 --> 01:21:03,820
You seem pretty sure
he's the man we want. Why?

1082
01:21:04,029 --> 01:21:08,492
No reason why. I'm just scared.
You're the ones who seem sure.

1083
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:13,288
- I couldn't bear anything happening here.
- You know what he's done?

1084
01:21:13,497 --> 01:21:15,957
- No, I don't want to hear!
- Well, I want you to get this.

1085
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:21,421
We're doing you a favour. If you know
anything more about your uncle, tell us.

1086
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:23,924
We also want to know
when and how he leaves town.

1087
01:21:24,132 --> 01:21:25,675
- If you hold out on us -
- I won't. I'll tell you.

1088
01:21:28,595 --> 01:21:31,556
Step on a crack,
you'll break your mother's back.

1089
01:21:31,765 --> 01:21:34,309
I wish I knew we could trust you.

1090
01:21:34,518 --> 01:21:37,562
I won't do anything to help him,
I promise.

1091
01:21:37,771 --> 01:21:40,816
But you can't ask me to spy on him.

1092
01:21:41,024 --> 01:21:44,653
We've made a bargain.
I'll get him to leave. That's all I'll do.

1093
01:21:44,861 --> 01:21:47,531
Think, Charlie. The man's dangerous.
If he gets away from us -

1094
01:21:47,739 --> 01:21:52,786
I don't want to hear what he'll do.
We've made a bargain. I'll keep it.

1095
01:21:52,994 --> 01:21:55,497
I'll let you know when he leaves.

1096
01:21:55,705 --> 01:22:00,669
Funny if he turned out
to be the wrong man. Could be.

1097
01:22:00,877 --> 01:22:04,714
<i>- Ann!
- I broke my mother's back three times.</i>

1098
01:22:04,923 --> 01:22:09,010
Not bad. You didn't finish telling me
whether Miss Rose married the rich guy,

1099
01:22:09,219 --> 01:22:12,139
- or the one she was in love with.
- How long have you two such friends?

1100
01:22:12,347 --> 01:22:15,892
Oh, we play games. I ask questions.
She knows all the answers.

1101
01:22:16,184 --> 01:22:19,020
<i>The only trouble is
I can't make out what she's making up.</i>

1102
01:22:19,229 --> 01:22:22,524
I never make up anything.
I get everything from my books.

1103
01:22:22,732 --> 01:22:24,234
They're all true.

1104
01:22:24,442 --> 01:22:28,363
Come on, Ann. We'd better get home
and help with dinner. Goodbye.

1105
01:22:28,572 --> 01:22:32,033
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Graham. Mr Saunders.

1106
01:22:32,242 --> 01:22:34,286
<i>- Goodbye, Catherine.
- Come on, Catherine.</i>

1107
01:22:34,494 --> 01:22:38,874
- Why not pick flowers for the table?
- Simple flowers are the best.

1108
01:22:39,082 --> 01:22:42,460
<i>- I didn't ask for orchids.
- I wish I'd been born in the South.</i>

1109
01:22:42,669 --> 01:22:45,964
<i>Southern women have a lot of charm.
They pick flowers with gloves on.</i>

1110
01:22:46,173 --> 01:22:48,675
- Goodbye, Catherine.
- Goodbye, Charlie. See you after dinner.

1111
01:22:48,884 --> 01:22:50,552
Bye.

1112
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:53,763
<i>- Hello, Ann.
- Hello.</i>

1113
01:22:53,972 --> 01:22:58,768
How was church, Charlie? Did you
count the house? Turn anybody away?

1114
01:22:58,977 --> 01:23:01,271
No, room enough for everyone.

1115
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,482
I'm glad to hear that.

1116
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:07,903
Show's been running such a long time,
I thought attendance might be falling off.

1117
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:10,655
<i>Anything special on the noon broadcast?</i>

1118
01:23:10,864 --> 01:23:15,118
They caught that other fellow,
the Merry Widow Murderer.

1119
01:23:15,327 --> 01:23:18,497
<i>- They did, did they? Where?
- State of Maine. Portland.</i>

1120
01:23:18,705 --> 01:23:22,042
Didn't catch him exactly.
He was running away from the police,

1121
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:26,671
and they cornered him at the airport
and he ran into the propeller of a plane.

1122
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,715
- Oh, boy!
- Cut him all to pieces.

1123
01:23:28,924 --> 01:23:31,176
Had to identify him by his clothes.

1124
01:23:31,384 --> 01:23:35,305
His shirts were all initialled,
"C," "O," apostrophe "H."

1125
01:23:35,514 --> 01:23:37,974
Well, makes a good ending.
Couldn't have done better myself.

1126
01:23:38,183 --> 01:23:40,393
I guess that closes that case pretty final.

1127
01:23:40,602 --> 01:23:43,814
<i>Sure does.
Never cared much for that case.</i>

1128
01:23:44,022 --> 01:23:49,569
Well, I think I'll go get ready for dinner.
I'm hungry. I can eat a good dinner today.

1129
01:24:47,919 --> 01:24:52,048
Charlie, I have great news for you.
Where can we talk alone?

1130
01:25:03,143 --> 01:25:08,482
We got a wire from Maine. We can call
off the job. I'll bet you're relieved. I am.

1131
01:25:08,648 --> 01:25:10,400
Oh, I am relieved.

1132
01:25:10,609 --> 01:25:14,154
<i>You were trying to get youruncle out.
He must have thought you were crazy.</i>

1133
01:25:14,362 --> 01:25:17,449
Now that it's over, I don't
want to talk about it any more.

1134
01:25:17,657 --> 01:25:20,243
I'd like to pretend the whole
dreadful thing never happened.

1135
01:25:20,452 --> 01:25:24,581
<i>- There's nothing to pretend about.
- There's mother's gloves.</i>

1136
01:25:24,789 --> 01:25:27,709
Mother and her gloves.
She's always losing things.

1137
01:25:27,918 --> 01:25:31,171
<i>All mothers lose things.
Someday, she'll be losing you.</i>

1138
01:25:31,379 --> 01:25:35,050
Mothers don't lose daughters,
they gain sons.

1139
01:25:35,258 --> 01:25:38,595
Yes, but gain isn't always the word.
Now, take me.

1140
01:25:38,804 --> 01:25:41,223
Who'd want a detective
for a son-in-law?

1141
01:25:41,431 --> 01:25:43,558
- My father would.
- He would?

1142
01:25:43,767 --> 01:25:49,022
If you told him you were going to marry
a detective, he wouldn't disown you?

1143
01:25:49,231 --> 01:25:51,107
It wouldn't have to be me. There's Ann.

1144
01:25:51,316 --> 01:25:55,487
No, Ann wants to marry a librarian.
She told me.

1145
01:25:55,695 --> 01:25:59,449
So she'll always have
plenty of books around to read.

1146
01:26:01,409 --> 01:26:03,286
What's the matter?

1147
01:26:03,495 --> 01:26:07,082
I was laughing.
It's been so long since I laughed.

1148
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:08,959
I like it when you laugh.

1149
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:14,381
I like it when you don't.
I guess I like you whatever you do.

1150
01:26:14,589 --> 01:26:19,010
- I guess I like you.
- I'm glad. I like you too.

1151
01:26:19,219 --> 01:26:24,391
Funny how you happen to meet someone
and like them and... like them.

1152
01:26:24,599 --> 01:26:26,434
Mm-hm.

1153
01:26:26,643 --> 01:26:28,395
- Charlie?
- Yes?

1154
01:26:28,603 --> 01:26:33,150
I suppose it couldn't ever really happen
some day that you'd tell your father...

1155
01:26:33,358 --> 01:26:37,070
You know, about marrying someone,
a detective, I mean.

1156
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:40,490
- I don't know.
- I didn't mean to tell you.

1157
01:26:40,699 --> 01:26:43,952
I wanted to wait until you'd forgotten
the mess we've been through together,

1158
01:26:44,161 --> 01:26:47,122
till you didn't think of me as part
of something unpleasant and frightening.

1159
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:51,793
I wanted to wait and come back
and then tell you.

1160
01:26:52,002 --> 01:26:54,254
But I can't help it.
I want to tell you now.

1161
01:26:54,462 --> 01:26:58,008
I love you, Charlie. I love you terribly.

1162
01:26:58,216 --> 01:27:02,345
I know it's no time to tell you now
and I'm sorry. Do you mind?

1163
01:27:02,554 --> 01:27:05,348
- I don't mind.
- Do you think you could think about it?

1164
01:27:05,557 --> 01:27:09,769
- About your loving me?
- And perhaps your loving me?

1165
01:27:11,521 --> 01:27:16,651
I- I'd like us to be friends. I know that.
We are friends.

1166
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:20,405
- I'd like to have that to think about.
- Nothing more?

1167
01:27:20,614 --> 01:27:24,826
I don't know, Jack.
I... just don't know yet.

1168
01:27:25,035 --> 01:27:28,121
Alright. But I may come back?

1169
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:32,876
Oh, please come back.
Please come back.

1170
01:27:33,919 --> 01:27:35,712
Listen, Charlie.

1171
01:27:35,921 --> 01:27:38,507
When I go, go back to that square
in the middle of town.

1172
01:27:38,715 --> 01:27:42,344
Take a good look at it.
That's where I first knew I loved you.

1173
01:27:42,552 --> 01:27:46,431
That's where we had the fight
and I didn't know what to do.

1174
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,559
I like my job,
but I didn't like it that night.

1175
01:27:49,768 --> 01:27:51,728
I hated it that night.

1176
01:27:51,937 --> 01:27:55,023
- You hate it now?
- No, not now.

1177
01:27:56,817 --> 01:28:01,530
You know, this is a swell place.
I'm going to put a bronze plaque up.

1178
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:06,868
That door's always banging shut!

1179
01:28:07,077 --> 01:28:09,746
Oh! It sticks.

1180
01:28:10,789 --> 01:28:12,457
Uh!

1181
01:28:22,801 --> 01:28:25,679
What are you two locking yourselves
in the garage for?

1182
01:28:25,887 --> 01:28:28,056
- When I was young, it was the parlour.
- Hello, Mr Oakley.

1183
01:28:28,265 --> 01:28:30,600
- I was saying goodbye to Charlie.
- In the garage?

1184
01:28:30,809 --> 01:28:33,979
The door got stuck.
Now I'll have to say goodbye to you.

1185
01:28:34,187 --> 01:28:38,275
Let's say goodbye out here on the lawn.
No use taking a chance on the garage.

1186
01:28:38,483 --> 01:28:41,444
- Finished here?
- All finished, but I'll be back.

1187
01:28:41,653 --> 01:28:44,030
<i>- You ' II be seeing me around.
- Oh?</i>

1188
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:46,491
<i>Not on business, though.</i>

1189
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:50,704
I can understand you coming back.
Charlie's a fine girl.

1190
01:28:50,912 --> 01:28:53,331
She's the thing I love most in the world.

1191
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:56,793
I mean it. Have a nice trip, Mr Graham.

1192
01:28:57,002 --> 01:29:00,088
And don't take any more photographs
without permission.

1193
01:29:00,297 --> 01:29:02,591
Rights of man. You know, freedom?

1194
01:29:02,799 --> 01:29:06,511
We'll have a talk
about freedom some day, Mr Oakley.

1195
01:29:12,017 --> 01:29:13,768
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1196
01:29:16,021 --> 01:29:21,026
Don't forget to write.
Remember, you have the addresses.

1197
01:29:28,033 --> 01:29:30,076
Jack!

1198
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:08,824
Anything else? I've got butter, fruit,
green thread and go to the library.

1199
01:30:09,032 --> 01:30:13,286
And whatever vegetable looks freshest.
If I've forgotten anything, I'll send Ann.

1200
01:30:13,495 --> 01:30:15,288
Alright.

1201
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:22,212
Mother!

1202
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:25,173
Charlie! Darling! Are you hurt?

1203
01:30:25,924 --> 01:30:27,592
I tripped.

1204
01:30:27,801 --> 01:30:30,345
Oh, what is it? Is it your ankle?

1205
01:30:30,554 --> 01:30:33,473
I don't think I'm hurt.
I grabbed the banister.

1206
01:30:33,682 --> 01:30:35,183
You might have been killed!

1207
01:30:36,434 --> 01:30:40,564
<i>I worry myself sick every time
one of you comes down these stairs.</i>

1208
01:30:40,772 --> 01:30:43,608
<i>They're too steep and rickety.
They ought to be fixed.</i>

1209
01:30:43,817 --> 01:30:45,986
<i>Are you sure you're all right?</i>

1210
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:28,904
When are you leaving, Uncle Charlie?

1211
01:31:29,112 --> 01:31:33,241
Oh, come now. That other business,
it's all over. I'd like to forget it.

1212
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:36,119
- We're all happy here.
- When are you leaving?

1213
01:31:36,328 --> 01:31:38,371
I'm not going, you see.

1214
01:31:39,498 --> 01:31:41,666
Not yet. I'm not going.

1215
01:31:41,875 --> 01:31:45,796
I want to settle down. Live somewhere
people know me. Put some money by.

1216
01:31:46,004 --> 01:31:50,467
- Start a business. Be part of the family.
- I see.

1217
01:31:50,675 --> 01:31:55,096
The most sensible thing for you to do
is to be friends with me.

1218
01:31:55,305 --> 01:31:58,016
I can do a lot for you, Charlie,
for all of you.

1219
01:31:58,225 --> 01:32:02,187
No, not you.
We don't want anything from you.

1220
01:32:02,395 --> 01:32:06,942
- I wish I'd told my mother about you.
- I know what you've been thinking.

1221
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:10,821
How would your mother have felt?
What would it do to her now?

1222
01:32:11,029 --> 01:32:14,199
How about your father?
His job at the bank?

1223
01:32:14,407 --> 01:32:17,077
What would become of all of you
if everything came out?

1224
01:32:17,244 --> 01:32:20,580
You needn't be afraid. I can't tell them.

1225
01:32:20,789 --> 01:32:25,418
But I'm not afraid. What would you tell?
Who'd believe you?

1226
01:32:25,627 --> 01:32:27,754
A waltz runs through your head.

1227
01:32:27,963 --> 01:32:32,175
You don't like the initials on a ring and
connect it up with a newspaper clipping.

1228
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:34,845
Now, you haven't even got the ring.
I don't know what became of it.

1229
01:32:35,053 --> 01:32:37,931
- You have it.
- I?

1230
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:40,183
I gave it to you.

1231
01:32:41,726 --> 01:32:46,815
I don't want you here, Uncle Charlie.
I don't want you to touch my mother.

1232
01:32:47,023 --> 01:32:52,028
So go away, I'm warning you.
Go away, or I'll kill you myself.

1233
01:32:52,237 --> 01:32:54,197
See? That's the way I feel about you.

1234
01:33:21,391 --> 01:33:23,852
- Here you are, Joe.
- Oh, perfume.

1235
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:28,148
- Just the fresh, clean smell of lavender.
- Yeah, I know.

1236
01:33:28,356 --> 01:33:30,192
You look very handsome, both of you.

1237
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:34,488
- I'm proud of the two men in my family.
- Emmy, you're a dream.

1238
01:33:34,696 --> 01:33:37,240
It's a pity the children
have to sit on our laps.

1239
01:33:37,449 --> 01:33:40,702
It's going to be a tight squeeze.
It won't do my pants any good.

1240
01:33:40,911 --> 01:33:44,414
<i>- Joe, I wish you could drive.
- We do it this way.</i>

1241
01:33:44,623 --> 01:33:48,168
<i>- Charles, you'll sit -
- He can sit in the back with Dad.</i>

1242
01:33:48,376 --> 01:33:50,629
The children can fit in beside them.

1243
01:33:50,837 --> 01:33:52,589
Nonsense. I'm getting a cab.
You all go in the taxi.

1244
01:33:52,798 --> 01:33:56,593
<i>- Charlie and I'll go in the car.
- No, Uncle Charlie, you go in the taxi.</i>

1245
01:33:56,802 --> 01:33:58,011
I want to ride in the taxi!

1246
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:00,472
Course you do. So it's all arranged.

1247
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:04,601
- Charlie, run out and get the car.
- I'd rather drive the family.

1248
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:09,981
I want you to hear my speech
on the way. You're my severest critic.

1249
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:14,736
<i>Anyway, we need a taxi.
Ann, go call Mr Abercrombie.</i>

1250
01:34:14,945 --> 01:34:17,405
<i>Mother!</i>

1251
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:22,911
Mother, please ride with me.
Father can take the children. Please!

1252
01:35:11,710 --> 01:35:15,964
<i>Bet I'll be the only man outside
of Charles fool enough to dress up.</i>

1253
01:35:16,173 --> 01:35:20,302
<i>Then you'll be the only other on e
to be correct. You look distinguished.</i>

1254
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:22,846
Charles, are you all ready? Joe, are you?

1255
01:35:23,054 --> 01:35:25,474
Wait a minute!
I've got to get my overcoat.

1256
01:35:25,682 --> 01:35:27,726
Please, dear. Hurry!

1257
01:35:27,934 --> 01:35:31,021
Take your time, Emmy.
They can't start till I get there.

1258
01:35:31,229 --> 01:35:33,315
It's getting chilly in here.

1259

<i>KSRO, Santa Rosa,</i>

<i>Oh! Does it have to be so loud?</i>

1264
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:50,874

Joe, there's some whisky on my bureau.
Get it quick.

- Charlie. Charlie. Dear Charlie.
- Charlie?

I'm here, darling. Here's mother.
That's right, my baby.

1281
01:37:11,079 --> 01:37:14,875
That's right, my brave little girl. Here.

1282

- Take a little sip of this.
- No, I'm all right.

- Joe, call Dr Phillips.
- No, I'm all right. I just want to get up.

1284
01:37:22,549 --> 01:37:26,470
You had a wonderful escape. Someone
must have left the motor running.

1285
01:37:26,678 --> 01:37:30,182
- I couldn't find the key to turn it off.
- The key was there when I went in.

1286
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:32,559
Lucky thing I passed by.

1287
01:37:32,767 --> 01:37:36,271
She might have died. You saved her.
You knew just what to do.

1288
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:40,650
- Don't know how I happened across her.
- We'll put the lecture off.

1289
01:37:40,859 --> 01:37:45,322
Oh, yes, there is. I want you all to go.
There's the cab now.

1290
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:48,200
Oh, I couldn't. I just couldn't go.

1291
01:37:48,408 --> 01:37:51,661
Wh-Who found me in the garage?

1292
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:54,122
<i>Herb heard you beating on the door.</i>

1293

<i>I was coming across the backyard
and I heard gaspin' and bangin'.</i>

1294
01:37:58,502 --> 01:38:01,463
I figured there must be
a human bein' in there.

1295
01:38:01,671 --> 01:38:03,799
<i>- Quick thinking, Herb.
- Lucky thing.</i>

I'm glad you happened
to be going by, Herb.

<i>Come on, Mother.</i>

1298
01:38:09,095 --> 01:38:10,847
I- I want to stay with you.

1299
01:38:11,056 --> 01:38:15,644
I don't feel like making a speech now,
when I think what might have happened.

1300
01:38:15,852 --> 01:38:19,773
I'm all right. I just want to sit
on the porch a while and get the air.

1301
01:38:19,981 --> 01:38:21,775
No, darling, I won't hear of it.

1302
01:38:21,983 --> 01:38:26,988
I'm alright, really. I'd rather stay home
and get things ready for the party.

1303
01:38:27,197 --> 01:38:29,699
Darling, I want to stay with you.

1304
01:38:35,205 --> 01:38:38,542
Herb, will you take Roger?
Ann, you come with us.

1305
01:38:40,836 --> 01:38:46,299
I just don't understand it.
First the stairs and...

1306
01:39:05,443 --> 01:39:07,737
Mr Graham isn't there?

1307
01:39:09,948 --> 01:39:13,076
This is the Hotel Stewart in Fresno,
isn't it?

1308
01:39:13,285 --> 01:39:15,704
And you don't expect him?

1309
01:39:15,912 --> 01:39:17,998
I see. Thank you.

1310
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:23,545
He isn't there?
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

1311
01:39:24,254 --> 01:39:26,840
Can you tell me where I can reach him?

1312
01:39:27,048 --> 01:39:31,219
I've already tried to get him
at the address he gave me in Fresno.

1313
01:39:32,721 --> 01:39:34,764
Thank you.

1314
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:15,263
Mom, may we have some sandwiches?

1315
01:40:15,472 --> 01:40:19,309
Don't take anything from the dining room.
Go in the kitchen.

1316
01:40:19,518 --> 01:40:22,729
<i>Please go. And just leave your coats...</i>

1317
01:40:24,064 --> 01:40:26,358
<i>Joe, dear,
will you take care of everyone?</i>

1318
01:40:26,566 --> 01:40:28,068
<i>Charlie!</i>

1319
01:40:28,276 --> 01:40:30,070
I'll be right down.

1320
01:40:30,278 --> 01:40:33,323
<i>Well... now... hm.</i>

1321
01:40:35,867 --> 01:40:40,831
Now, Mr Oakley. I thought champagne
was only for battleships!

1322
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:46,670
None for me, nor I'm sure, for my wife.
But we hope you'll all forget we're here.

1323
01:40:46,878 --> 01:40:50,048
I'd like to propose a toast to...
Isn't Charlie coming down?

1324
01:40:50,257 --> 01:40:53,135
She'll be down in a moment.
Mrs Potter.

1325
01:40:53,343 --> 01:40:58,098
Not that one. Why do I make tomato?
They always soak through the bread.

1326
01:40:58,306 --> 01:41:03,019
Try one of these. It's whole wheat bread
and cream cheese. Paprika makes it pink.

1327
01:41:03,228 --> 01:41:05,564
- Mr Greene.
- Mrs Greene, what would you like?

1328
01:41:05,772 --> 01:41:07,440
Thank you.

1329
01:41:07,649 --> 01:41:10,527
- I think I'd like to propose a toast, too.
- Emmy.

1330
01:41:10,735 --> 01:41:15,907
To our distinguished visitor, who made
the best speech heard in town for years.

1331
01:41:16,116 --> 01:41:19,244
To that very good fellow, Mr Oakley.

1332
01:41:19,452 --> 01:41:21,955
- Herbie.
- Thank you.

1333
01:41:22,164 --> 01:41:24,124
<i>We don ' t get many American speakers.</i>

1334
01:41:24,332 --> 01:41:26,084
<i>Seems like foreigners
make the best talkers.</i>

1335
01:41:29,296 --> 01:41:32,799
Ah, here she is. Now for my toast.

1336
01:41:41,099 --> 01:41:43,143
Charlie...

1337
01:41:44,936 --> 01:41:47,230
You're just in time for a farewell toast.

1338
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:52,444
I hate to break the news to you like this,
but tomorrow I must leave Santa Rosa.

1339
01:41:52,652 --> 01:41:55,780
- Not forever.
- If that isn't the strangest coincidence.

1340
01:41:55,989 --> 01:41:58,533
<i>- I'm off to San Francisco.
- Charles?</i>

1341
01:42:00,243 --> 01:42:03,079
Oh, Emmy darling,
I didn't mean to spoil your fun tonight.

1342
01:42:03,288 --> 01:42:07,083
I got a letter today.
I have to catch the early morning train.

1343
01:42:08,043 --> 01:42:10,086
I'll miss you, Emmy.

1344
01:42:13,799 --> 01:42:18,053
But I want you all to know
I'll always think of this lovely town...

1345
01:42:19,346 --> 01:42:22,265
<i>as a place of hospitality
and kindness...</i>

1346
01:42:23,433 --> 01:42:26,394
<i>and homes... homes.</i>

1347
01:42:26,603 --> 01:42:31,358
- But I can't bear it if you go, Charles.
- Oh, Emmy, I'll be back.

1348
01:42:31,566 --> 01:42:37,197
<i>I've arranged with Dr Phillips
for our little memorial for the children.</i>

1349
01:42:38,365 --> 01:42:41,368
It isn't any of the things you've done.

1350
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:47,916
It's just the idea
that we were together again. I'm sorry.

1351
01:42:48,125 --> 01:42:52,087
<i>But you see,
we were so close growing up.</i>

1352
01:42:52,295 --> 01:42:55,799
And then Charles went away,
and I got married, and...

1353
01:42:57,134 --> 01:42:59,594
<i>Then, you know how it is.</i>

1354
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:04,015
<i>You sort of forget you're you.
You're your husband's wife...</i>

1355
01:43:06,893 --> 01:43:09,980
We'll be looking for you. We feel
you're one of us, don't we, Margaret?

1356
01:43:10,188 --> 01:43:13,775
Indeed. I want to thank you
on behalf of our club.

1357
01:43:13,984 --> 01:43:15,986
And bless you
for your gift to our hospital.

1358
01:43:16,194 --> 01:43:19,781
- The children will bless you, too.
- Thank you, sir.

1359
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:23,493
<i>Excuse me, sir,
but I-I can hear the train coming now.</i>

1360
01:43:23,702 --> 01:43:25,120
Excuse me.

1361
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:39,176
Better get aboard, Charles.

1362
01:43:39,384 --> 01:43:44,055
Alright. Goodbye, everybody.
Roger, Ann, come see the train.

1363
01:43:44,264 --> 01:43:47,058
Come on, Charlie.
You can see they get off.

1364
01:43:47,267 --> 01:43:49,102
Alright.

1365
01:43:49,311 --> 01:43:51,521
<i>I want to see the rooms,
the private ones.</i>

1366
01:43:51,730 --> 01:43:55,692
I've seen berths. I've slept in two uppers
and one lower with papa.

1367
01:43:55,901 --> 01:43:58,653
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Goodbye, Charles.

1368
01:43:58,862 --> 01:44:02,115
- Goodbye, Emmy.
- Goodbye. And don't forget to write!

1369
01:44:02,324 --> 01:44:06,369
I will. You write too.
I'll send you my address.

1370
01:44:11,583 --> 01:44:13,627
Goodbye.

1371
01:44:16,922 --> 01:44:19,257
Don't jump on the seats, Roger.

1372
01:44:19,849 --> 01:44:53,199


1373
01:44:21,218 --> 01:44:23,428
Roger, what did I tell you?

1374
01:44:26,932 --> 01:44:30,685
Porter, there's one more bag
in the other car. Will you get it, please?

1375
01:44:30,894 --> 01:44:34,105
Charlie, the train's going to start.
I don't want to get carried away.

1376
01:44:34,314 --> 01:44:37,067
Maybe it's too late!
Maybe I'll have to go along!

1377
01:44:37,275 --> 01:44:39,402
There's plenty of time.
You run along, we'll follow.

1378
01:44:39,611 --> 01:44:41,238
Charlie.

1379
01:44:42,072 --> 01:44:44,115
Just a minute.

1380
01:44:45,408 --> 01:44:49,496
I want you to know
I think you were right to make me leave.

1381
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:54,167
It's best for your mother,
best for all of us.

1382
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:58,463
You saw what happened
to her last night.

1383
01:44:58,672 --> 01:45:03,385
She's not very strong, you know.
I don't think she could stand the shock.

1384
01:45:03,593 --> 01:45:06,763
- I remember once, when she was little -
- The train's moving!

1385
01:45:06,972 --> 01:45:10,267
Listen, Charlie.
I want you to forget all about me.

1386
01:45:10,475 --> 01:45:13,228
Forget that I ever came to Santa Rosa.

1387
01:45:14,646 --> 01:45:16,314
Your hands!

1388
01:45:18,441 --> 01:45:21,444
Let me go, Uncle Charlie! Let me go!

1389
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:27,200
I've got to do this, Charlie...

1390
01:45:27,409 --> 01:45:30,162
so long as you know
what you do about me.

1391
01:45:41,965 --> 01:45:44,301
Not yet, Charlie. Let it get a little faster.

1392
01:45:46,261 --> 01:45:47,804
Just a little faster.

1393
01:45:48,013 --> 01:45:49,306
Faster.

1394
01:45:49,514 --> 01:45:50,974
Now!

1395
01:46:16,792 --> 01:46:19,044
<i>Santa Rosa has gained
and lost a son,</i>

1396
01:46:19,252 --> 01:46:21,713
<i>a son that she can be proud of.</i>

1397
01:46:21,922 --> 01:46:26,551
<i>Brave, generous, kindly.
With all of the spendid dignity -</i>

1398
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:29,763
I'm glad you were able to come, Jack.

1399
01:46:29,971 --> 01:46:33,892
I couldn't have faced it
without someone who knew.

1400
01:46:35,477 --> 01:46:39,523
- I did know more. I couldn't tell you.
- I know.

1401
01:46:41,566 --> 01:46:45,028
He thought the world was a horrible place.

1402
01:46:45,237 --> 01:46:49,032
- He couldn't have been very happy ever.
- No.

1403
01:46:50,784 --> 01:46:54,913
He didn't trust people.
He seemed to hate them.

1404
01:46:55,121 --> 01:46:57,374
He hated the whole world.

1405
01:46:58,959 --> 01:47:02,337
You know, he said that people like us

1406
01:47:02,546 --> 01:47:06,591
had no idea what the world was really like.

1407
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:09,719
Well, it's not quite as bad as that,

1408
01:47:09,928 --> 01:47:12,722
but sometimes it needs a lot of watching.

1409
01:47:12,931 --> 01:47:15,851
It seems to go crazy every now and then.

1410
01:47:16,059 --> 01:47:18,103
Like your Uncle Charlie.

1411
01:47:18,311 --> 01:47:22,232
<i>The beauty of their souls, and characters live on with us forever.</i>
