1
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,560
<i>Come in.</i>

2
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,200
Mr Spencer. 
 Mr Spencer, I hate to bother you...

3
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,760
but I thought you'd like to know 
 there were two men here.

4
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,680
Two men askin' for you.

5
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,520
A young man and a kind of older man.

6
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,400
They was sorry you wasn't in. 
 I said you wasn't.

7
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,560
- Did they say they'd be back? 
 - They didn't say, but I think they will.

8
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,560
Just now, when I had to go to the store, 
 I seen them standing there at the corner.

9
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,880
Maybe I shoulda let them in, 
 only you said not to disturb you -

10
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,640
- Yes. 
 - And I'm sure They'll be back.

11
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,520
You look kinda tired to me, 
 and that's a fact.

12
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,760
You got a headache or somethin'?

13
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,240
I think maybe you need a real rest. 
 That's what I think.

14
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,000
Why, Mr Spencer. You oughtn't to leave 
 all that money lying around like that.

15
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,600
Oh, it makes me nervous 
 to see money lying around.

16
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,720
Everybody in the world 
 ain't honest, you know.

17
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,080
Though I must say I haven't had 
 much trouble that way.

18
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,560
<i>Those friends of yours 
 told me not to mention they'd called.</i>

19
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,040
Wanted to surprise you. But I thought 
 you'd like to know somehow.

20
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,800
Yes, yes. Of course. If they come back, 
 you may show them in.

21
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,200
Yes. You know, Mrs Martin, 
 it's very funny.

22
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,480
They aren't exactly friends of mine. 
 They've never seen me.

23
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,560
- That's odd, isn't it? 
 - 'Tis odd, like you say.

24
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,320
And now that I'm here, 
 I'll have to meet them.

25
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,280
I may even go out and meet them.

26
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,520
And then again, I may not. Not yet.

27
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,840
You go ahead with your nap. 
 I'll pull down the blind.

28
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,920
<i>What do you know? 
 You're bluffing. You've nothing on me.</i>

29
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,960
Hello, Postal Union? 
 I want to send a telegram

30
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,120
to Mrs Joseph Newton 
 in Santa Rosa, California.

31
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,640
Here's the message. Ready?

32
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,880
Lonesome for you all. Stop.

33
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,320
Am coming out to stay 
 with you awhile. Stop.

34
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,560
Will arrive Thursday and try and stop me.

35
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,440
Will wire exact time later.

36
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Love to you all...

37
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,000
and a kiss for little Charlie 
 from her Uncle Charlie.

38
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,280
That's right. That's the signature. 
 "Uncle Charlie. "

39
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,360
That's right. Santa Rosa.

40
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,320
<i>Santa Rosa, California.</i>

41
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,480
<i>Ann! Answer the telephone.</i>

42
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,040
Newton's residence. 
 Ann Newton speaking.

43
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,880
Oh, hello, Mrs Henderson. This is Ann.

44
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,240
Mother isn't home yet.

45
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,680
A telegram? Well...

46
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,680
I don't see a pencil, so maybe 
 she better call you back.

47
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,880
I'm trying to keep my mind free of things 
 that don't matter...

48
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,200
because I have so much 
 to keep on my mind.

49
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,360
Innumerable things.

50
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,680
I'll have her call back. 
 Thank you for calling.

51
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,680
Goodbye.

52
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,600
Hello, Ann. Where's your mother?

53
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,520
<i>- She ' s out. 
 - Out?</i>

54
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,600
Mrs Henderson just called 
 from the Postal Union Office.

55
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,520
She says we have a telegram.

56
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,880
I would have taken it down, 
 only I couldn't find a pencil. I looked.

57
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,120
Telegram, eh?

58
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,160
I knew there'd be trouble if 
 your Aunt Sarah got her driver's licence.

59
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,760
<i>- Whereabouts was the accident? 
 - I didn't take notes.</i>

60
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,440
Oh. Then how about a kiss?

61
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,880
Isn't that the funniest thing? 
 Here I am, practically a child

62
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,920
and I wouldn't read the things you read.

63
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,520
Mm-hm. Well, I guess 
 they'd give you bad dreams.

64
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,520
Bad dreams? You don't understand, Papa. 
 Mystery stories have done -

65
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,640
- Where's Roger? 
 - Out. The average mind -

66
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,520
- Where's Charlie? 
 - Out. No, she's in her room thinking.

67
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Well, don't read too much. 
 You'll ruin your eyes.

68
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,600
And leave my book alone. 
 What's that you're reading?

69
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,720
<i>- Ivanhoe. 
 - Hm? Oh.</i>

70
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,440
- Who is it? 
 - It's me.

71
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,600
What's the matter? 
 Don't you feel well?

72
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,960
No. I'm perfectly well.

73
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,640
I've just been thinking for hours, 
 and I've come to the conclusion I give up.

74
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,000
<i>- I simply give up. 
 - What are you going to give up?</i>

75
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,800
Have you ever to thought that a family 
 should be the most wonderful thing ever?

76
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,280
And that this family's 
 just gone to pieces?

77
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,200
- We have? 
 - Of course we have.

78
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,360
We just sort of go along and 
 nothing happens. We're in a terrible rut.

79
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,600
It's been on my mind for months. 
 What's going to be our future?

80
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,880
Oh, come now, Charlie. 
 Things aren't as bad as that.

81
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,160
- The bank gave me a raise last January. 
 - Money.

82
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,000
How can you talk about money 
 when I'm talking about souls?

83
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,920
We eat and sleep and that's about all.

84
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,160
We don't even have 
 any real conversations.

85
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,400
<i>- We just talk. 
 - And work.</i>

86
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,760
Yes. Poor Mother. She works like a dog.

87
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,720
<i>- Just like a dog. 
 - Where is she?</i>

88
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,600
She's out. When she comes back, 
 it'll be the same thing.

89
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,720
Dinner, then dishes, then bed. 
 I don't see how she stands it.

90
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,160
You know, 
 she's really a wonderful woman.

91
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,560
I mean, she's not just a mother. And 
 I think we ought to do something for her.

92
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,080
<i>- Don ' t you think we should? 
 - Yeah. What were you thinking of?</i>

93
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,360
Oh, nothing, I suppose.

94
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,640
I guess we'll just have to wait 
 for a miracle or something.

95
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,680
Oh, now, Charlie, you're right. 
 Absolutely right.

96
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,400
- I'll figure out some way - 
 - I don't believe in good intentions now.

97
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,000
- All I'm waiting for now is a miracle. 
 - Oh, Charlie.

98
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,160
Those back stairs are steep.

99
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,800
What's the matter, Charlie? 
 What's the matter, Joe?

100
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,960
- Well, it seems that, uh - 
 - Oh, I've become a nagging old maid.

101
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,160
You went downtown in that awful old 
 hat you'd promised you'd throw away.

102
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,280
<i>- Mama. 
 - Darling, does it matter what hat I wear?</i>

103
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,960
<i>- Mama. 
 - Why do you let that child yell at you?</i>

104
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,600
- If she - 
 - I'm going downstairs, anyway.

105
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,400
<i>Joe, what were you 
 both talking about when I came in?</i>

106
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,320
<i>Something about a miracle.</i>

107
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,800
<i>Oh, it's nothing. 
 Charlie ' s a bit under the weather.</i>

108
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,760
<i>Oh. Well, she ' II be all right.</i>

109
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,440
<i>Well, come on, dear. Let's go 
 downstairs. No use standing here.</i>

110
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,160
I'm going to get myself a bottle of beer.

111
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,160
Mother, I'm going downtown 
 and send a telegram.

112
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
Why, darling, who do you know 
 to send a telegram to?

113
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,000
I know a wonderful person who'll come 
 and stir us up. Just the one to save us.

114
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,240
What do you mean, "save us"?

115
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,280
All this time, there's been 
 one right person to save us.

116
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,440
- What's Uncle Charlie's address? 
 - Uncle Charlie?

117
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,120
- You're not going to ask him for money? 
 - Of course not.

118
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,960
That wouldn't help us. 
 What's his address?

119
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,880
- The last address I had - 
 - Do you know how many steps it is

120
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,720
to get from here 
 to the drugstore and back?

121
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,120
- 649. 
 - If you've forgotten, I won't tell you.

122
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,880
- I remember. Philadelphia.

123
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,680
You can't ask a busy man 
 to come all this way for nothing.

124
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,000
He'll come for me. I'm named after him.

125
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,480
Besides, we're the only relatives 
 he has in the world.

126
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,520
<i>If you come 
 all the way up Fourth Street, it's 802.</i>

127
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,720
- Mama, guess what? 
 - I have no time for guessing.

128
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,760
What's that thing in your hair?

129
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,920
Well, I'll tell you anyway, even though 
 I think it's nicer when people guess.

130
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,960
Mrs Henderson said to call her at 
 the telegraph office. We have a telegram.

131
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,280
Ann, I don't think you ought to put things 
 behind your ears.

132
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,240
- Something might get into your ear. 
 - Emmy, Ann says we have a telegram.

133
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,720
I think you ought to find out about it. 
 Somebody might be sick or something.

134
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,000
Mrs Henderson didn't read the telegram 
 because I couldn't find a pencil.

135
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,000
When I have a house, it's going 
 to be full of well-sharpened pencils.

136
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,800
- Did Mrs Henderson say who it's from? 
 - No, she didn't.

137
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,560
She might have said who it was from.

138
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,120
Come on, Ann. That's my chair. 
 I'll call up and find out.

139
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,520
If you will be quiet just a second.

140
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,600
Hello. 
 181, please. I wonder who it can be?

141
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,560
Oh, nothing, Operator. Just 181.

142
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,160
<i>- If that's from my sister - 
 - Hello?</i>

143
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,080
Mrs Henderson? This is Emma Newton.

144
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,560
Ann says you have a telegram for me.

145
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,480
- Mama, you don't have to shout. 
 - Ssh.

146
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,800
Really, Papa. You'd think 
 Mama had never seen a phone.

147
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,840
She makes no allowance for science.

148
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,840
She thinks she has to cover the distance 
 by sheer lungpower.

149
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,840
Why, how wonderful. Thursday, you say?

150
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,760
Looks like somebody's coming.

151
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,600
- Who's coming, Ma? 
 - Well, it's the most wonderful surprise.

152
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,560
It's my brother, you know. 
 My younger brother. The baby.

153
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,280
Yes, of course, a little spoiled. 
 Families always spoil the youngest.

154
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,320
<i>Well, it's just simply wonderful.</i>

155
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,240
Thanks most awfully, Mrs Henderson.

156
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,320
Well...

157
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,680
What do you think? Charles is coming.

158
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,600
- Who? 
 - Your Uncle Charlie.

159
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,840
Did you say "Charles"?

160
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,600
And our Charlie's sending him a telegram. 
 Now, what made her think to do that?

161
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
<i>Hello, Charlie. I just called your house.</i>

162
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,400
- Telegram for your mother. 
 - Did you?

163
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,480
Gonna send that by Bill Forest, 
 but you can take it.

164
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,320
Thanks. From your uncle. 
 The spoiled one.

165
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,280
My uncle? My Uncle Charlie?

166
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,520
Yeah.

167
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,480
Mrs Henderson, 
 do you believe in telepathy?

168
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,360
Well, I ought to. That's my business.

169
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,600
Oh, not telegraphy. Mental telepathy.

170
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,520
Like... 
 well, suppose you have a thought,

171
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,280
and suppose the thought's about 
 someone you're in tune with.

172
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,560
Then across miles, that person knows 
 what you're thinking and answers you.

173
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,920
- And it's all mental. 
 - I don't know what you're talking about.

174
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,200
I only send telegrams the normal way.

175
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,800
He heard me. He heard me.

176
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,920
<i>- Mr Otis? Mr Otis? 
 - Yes?</i>

177
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,320
You're almost in Santa Rosa. Want to be 
 ready when you get into Santa Rosa.

178
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,160
<i>- I'm ready now. Thanks. 
 - Then I'll get all your bags out for you.</i>

179
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,680
<i>- How you feelin', Mr Otis? 
 - Pretty well.</i>

180
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,280
<i>A little weak 
 but pretty well on the whole.</i>

181
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,200
Mm-hm.

182
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,280
Harry, tell the porter you're a doctor.

183
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,480
Ask if there's anything you can do. 
 Maybe you can help that poor soul.

184
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,040
- I'm on my vacation. 
 - My husband's a doctor and if there's -

185
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,440
No, Ma'am. He's a very sick man. 
 Won't see anyone.

186
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,440
I haven't set eyes on him myself 
 since we first got on the train.

187
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,040
<i>Well, you don ' t look very well either.</i>

188
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,360
Ah, here we are. Come on, children.

189
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,120
Close the door, there. That's right.

190
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,440
- Oh, are you - 
 - Charlie. Young Charlie.

191
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,920
At first, I didn't know you. 
 I thought you were sick.

192
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,720
- Sick? 
 - You aren't sick, are you?

193
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,880
Look, Pop! Here he is!

194
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,200
Why, Uncle Charlie, you're not sick. 
 That was the funniest thing.

195
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,040
- Me, sick? Well, Joe, how are you? 
 - Alright, Charles.

196
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,160
Roger. Hello, Ann. 
 I bet you don't remember me.

197
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,560
I remember you sort of. 
 You look different.

198
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,320
Well, we better get started. 
 Emma's got the dinner almost ready.

199
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,480
I couldn't persuade her to come 
 to the station. Dinner came first.

200
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,360
- Roger, get the bags. I'll take that. 
 - Thank you, Joe.

201
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,040
That's it. Come on. Let's go.

202
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,600
<i>Come on, Roger, get these bags.</i>

203
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,360
You, uh, sure that isn't 
 too heavy for you?

204
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,440
Oh, no. It's nothing. I love to carry.

205
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,720
Emma. Don't move.

206
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,960
Standing there, 
 you don't look like Emma Newton.

207
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,800
You look like Emma Spencer Oakley of 
 46 Burnham Street, St Paul, Minnesota.

208
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,480
- The prettiest girl on the block. 
 - Charles.

209
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,920
Mama, nobody got off the train 
 but Uncle Charlie.

210
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,360
- Let me look at you. 
 - There was only us meeting somebody.

211
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,640
- To think you could take the time off. 
 - There was only one bed made up.

212
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,200
- It's so wonderful to have you here. 
 - Emmy, Emmy, don't cry.

213
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,640
And imagine your thinking 
 of 46 Burnham Street.

214
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,960
I haven't thought of that 
 funny old street in years.

215
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,240
I keep remembering those things. 
 All the old things.

216
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,520
<i>Emmy, how's he look? 
 Same old Charles, eh?</i>

217
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,320
Roger, Ann, get these other bags.

218
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,600
<i>You have Charlie's room 
 right here at the head of the stairs.</i>

219
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,960
Emmy wanted to move Ann, but Charlie 
 thought you'd be more comfortable here.

220
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,040
<i>Come on, Roger.</i>

221
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,400
- Ah-ah! Don't put the hat on the bed. 
 - Superstitious, Joe?

222
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,360
No, but I don't believe in inviting trouble.

223
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,560
It wasn't the biggest yacht in the world, 
 but it had a fireplace in the library

224
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,520
and the bar was panelled 
 in bleached mahogany.

225
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,040
You pushed a button and... 
 What am I talking about? That's all over.

226
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,920
<i>Let's talk about you.</i>

227
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,400
Charlie, 
 that's the prettiest dress I ever saw.

228
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,360
<i>I think so, too.</i>

229
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,880
Why, Charles, don't you remember?

230
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,800
Remember? Remember what?

231
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
- Why, Uncle Charlie, you sent it to me. 
 - I did?

232
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,440
Well, say, I've been sitting here 
 all this time forgetting something.

233
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,360
Ann. Roger.

234
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,440
- Look at that. Oh, dear now. 
 - Joe. Don't know whether you had one.

235
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,280
You didn't have to think of me, Charles. 
 Presents for the children are alright.

236
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,120
Say... I've never had a wristwatch.

237
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,960
Fellows at the bank'll think 
 I'm quite a sport.

238
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
<i>I have two for you, Emmy. 
 One old and one new.</i>

239
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,680
<i>Oh, Charles. What is it?</i>

240
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,880
<i>- You shouldn't have. Really. No. 
 - Well, yeah.</i>

241
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,480
Oh, Charles.

242
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,800
Oh, how... beautiful.

243
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,800
Oh, I've-I've always wanted one.

244
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,840
Oh, Mother, it's exactly right. 
 It's what you should have.

245
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,000
Look, Emmy.

246
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,880
Charles. You've had these all along.

247
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,920
<i>Mm-hm. All along, Emmy. 
 All these years.</i>

248
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,560
Safe in a deposit box, 
 no matter where I was.

249
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,680
Oh. Grandpa and Grandma?

250
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
1888.

251
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,120
<i>53 years ago.</i>

252
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,680
Aren't they sweet? 
 My, she was pretty.

253
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,160
Everybody was sweet and pretty then. 
 The whole world.

254
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,760
A wonderful world. 
 Not like the world today.

255
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,000
Not like the world now.

256
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,920
It was great to be young then.

257
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,040
We're all happy now, Uncle Charlie. 
 Look at us.

258
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,000
- And we're all happy at the same time. 
 - Now, for your present, Charlie.

259
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,400
Oh, I don't want anything. 
 Right now, I have enough.

260
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,360
Before you came, 
 I didn't think I had anything,

261
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,360
but now I don't want another thing.

262
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,160
- She's crazy. 
 - She doesn't mean it.

263
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,600
If you ask me, I think she's putting on, 
 like girls in books.

264
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,640
The ones that say they don't want 
 anything always get more in the end.

265
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,760
- That's what she's hoping. 
 - She's not crazy.

266
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,760
The smartest girl 
 in her class at school.

267
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,560
<i>Won the debate against theEast 
 Richmond HighSchool. She ' s got brains.</i>

268
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,120
I meant it. 
 Please don't give me anything.

269
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,680
- Nothing? 
 - Oh, I can't explain it.

270
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,600
But you came here 
 and Mother's so happy and...

271
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Oh, I'm glad that she named me after you 
 and that she thinks we're both alike.

272
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,440
I think we are, too. I know it.

273
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,920
Oh, it would spoil things 
 if you should give me anything.

274
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,960
You're a strange girl, Charlie. 
 Why would it spoil things?

275
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,760
Because we're not just an uncle 
 and a niece. It's something else.

276
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,200
I know you. I know that you don't 
 tell people a lot of things.

277
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,880
I don't either. I have a feeling 
 that inside you somewhere,

278
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,000
<i>there's something nobody knows about.</i>

279
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,400
Something... nobody knows?

280
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,000
Something secret and wonderful and... 
 I'll find it out.

281
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,800
It's not good 
 to find out too much, Charlie.

282
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,560
But we're sort of like twins. 
 Don't you see?

283
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,840
- We have to know. 
 - Give me your hand, Charlie.

284
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,600
Thank you.

285
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,360
- You didn't even look at it. 
 - I don't have to.

286
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,440
No matter what you gave me, 
 it'd be the same.

287
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,440
Here. Let me show you.

288
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,200
It's a good emerald. A really good one.

289
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,000
Good emeralds are 
 the most beautiful things in the world.

290
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,720
- You've had something engraved. 
 - I haven't, but I will if you like it.

291
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,240
Yes, you have, Uncle Charlie. 
 It's very faint.

292
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,920
"T.S. From B.M."

293
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,240
But... Why, it must be someone's initials.

294
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,840
Well, I've been rooked. 
 The jeweller rooked me.

295
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,160
- Oh, it doesn't matter. Really. 
 - Give it back. I'll have it taken off.

296
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,560
No, No. I like it this way.

297
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,600
Someone else was probably happy 
 with this ring.

298
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,440
Oh, it's perfect the way it is.

299
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,840
You bring the coffee.

300
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,520
Sing at the table, 
 you'll marry a crazy husband.

301
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,480
Superstitions have been 
 proved 100% wrong.

302
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,920
Yes, I've been thinking of transferring 
 some money out here from the East.

303
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,040
I could put it in your bank, Joe, 
 until I found out what's what.

304
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,320
Uh, I suppose your bank 
 does take money, huh?

305
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,520
That's one thing we do. 
 Rake in the dough.

306
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,440
Can't promise to give it back.

307
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,400
Well, I'll go downtown in the morning 
 and open an account.

308
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,960
- 30 or 40,000 just to start things off? 
 - That's a lot of money.

309
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,520
He won't have it long. 
 The government will get it.

310
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,680
- The government gets - 
 - Don't talk against the government.

311
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,960
<i>The way men do things.</i>

312
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,600
I can't get that tune out of my head.

313
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,240
Maybe if somebody tells me what it is, 
 I'll forget it.

314
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,120
<i>- It's a waltz. 
 - I know it is, but what one?</i>

315
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,080
<i>You know, it's the funniest thing.</i>

316
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,400
<i>Sometimes I get a tune 
 in my head like that</i>

317
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,320
and pretty soon, I hear 
 somebody else humming it too.

318
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,600
I think tunes jump from head to head.

319
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,600
<i>Do you know whatit is, 
 Uncle Charlie?</i>

320
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,360
Uh, no. No. I-I-I don't know what it is.

321
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,960
<i>I remember. 
 Uh... It's on the tip of my tongue.</i>

322
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,160
<i>It's a waltz and it's Victor Herbert.</i>

323
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,640
- Victor Herbert wasn't a waltz. 
 - It's the Blue Danube Waltz.

324
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,640
Oh, yes. Of course it is.

325
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,000
No, it isn't, Uncle Charlie. 
 I know what it is. It's the Merry -

326
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,320
- I'm terribly sorry, Emmy. 
 - Nothing to make a fuss about.

327
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Charles, while we do the dishes, 
 why don't you come in the living room

328
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,960
and stretch out on the sofa 
 and read the evening paper?

329
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,880
You never were much on helping.

330
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,480
<i>- Joe, here's Herbert. 
 - Ann, Roger, help me here.</i>

331
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,600
Herbert's a friend of Joe's. 
 They're literary critics.

332
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,280
Hello, Herb. Had your supper?

333
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,640
- Had mine an hour ago. 
 - Hour ago, huh?

334
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,560
- Oh. A watch. 
 - Yeah, a present.

335
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,080
Here, Herb. 
 I'd like you to meet my brother-in-law.

336
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,480
- Charles, this is Herb Hawkins. 
 - Nice to know you, Mr Hawkins.

337
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,800
- Fine, thank you. 
 - How's your mother, Herb?

338
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,400
- Oh, uh, just middling. 
 - Uh-huh.

339
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,280
- Excuse me, Herb. 
 - Oh.

340
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,480
Thank you. 
 I'm sorry your mother's not better.

341
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,560
- Thank you, dear. There, now. 
 - Thank you.

342
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,200
<i>Lead a life of luxury.</i>

343
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,920
<i>Well, I must go and see 
 what Charlie ' s doing.</i>

344
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,840
Wife's brother from the East. 
 New York man.

345
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,120
Good for the children. 
 You know what I mean?

346
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,640
In business? 
 Well, he takes himself very seriously.

347
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,120
Well, how's everything?

348
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,200
Say, ha-have you read this one? Huh?

349
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,120
That little Frenchman beats them all.

350
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,920
You can talk all you like 
 about Sherlock Holmes.

351
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,840
That little Frenchman beats 'em all.

352
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,160
I read it. Air bubbles don't 
 necessarily kill a person.

353
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,040
Those writers from the other side 
 get too fancy.

354
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,280
- The best way to commit a murder- 
 - I know, I know.

355
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,440
Hit 'em on the head 
 with a blunt instrument.

356
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,960
Well, it's true, isn't it? Listen.

357
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,000
If I wanted to murder you tomorrow,

358
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,960
do you think 
 I'd waste my time on fancy hypodermics?

359
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,920
- Or on Inee? 
 - What's that?

360
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,720
- Inee. Indian arrow poison. 
 - Oh.

361
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,960
Listen, 
 I'd find out if you were alone, walk in,

362
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,120
hit you on the head with a piece 
 of lead pipe or a loaded cane -

363
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,120
What'd be the fun of that?

364
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,760
Where's your planning? 
 Where's your clues?

365
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,320
I don't want any clues. 
 I want to murder you.

366
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,600
What do I want with clues?

367
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,600
Well, if you haven't got any clues, 
 where's your book?

368
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,120
I'm not talkin' 'bout writing books. 
 I'm talking about killing you!

369
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,080
If I was going to kill you, I wouldn't do 
 a dumb thing like hitting you on the head.

370
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,480
First of all, 
 I don't like the fingerprint angle.

371
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,520
Of course, I could always wear gloves, 
 press your hands against the pipe

372
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,480
after you were dead 
 and make you look like a suicide.

373
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:54,360
But you wouldn't beat yourself to death. 
 I'd do it so it didn't look like murder.

374
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,040
Oh, Ann?

375
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,840
<i>- What? 
 - Come here.</i>

376
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Did you ever see a house 
 made out of newspapers?

377
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,320
Well, watch.

378
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,120
You-You take one sheet here.

379
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,240
OK? And you tear it down here.

380
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,880
And you tear it there.

381
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,800
You fold it over here at the side.

382
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,760
<i>Fold over the other side here.</i>

383
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,040
And turn it up there.

384
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,600
Now with... the door...

385
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,360
Right off... and there.

386
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,280
I'm not a baby any more. 
 Besides, that's Papa's paper.

387
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,040
<i>Oh, Roger, look what 
 we ' ve got. A nice, little red barn.</i>

388
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,000
- You've got Papa's paper. 
 - Oh, that's alright.

389
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,080
<i>Simply unfold it. 
 Nobody will ever know the difference.</i>

390
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,960
What are you two doing?

391
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,640
<i>- You know that's father's paper. 
 - It's my fault. I was playing a game.</i>

392
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,120
<i>- Didn't think about it as Joe's pap. 
 - Oh, that's alright.</i>

393
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,840
Here's page one, five... eight.

394
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,520
- What did you do with three and four? 
 - We never touched it.

395
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,560
<i>Really. Uncle Charlie ' s 
 the only one that touched it.</i>

396
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,160
Oh, well. I guess it's all right.

397
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,920
<i>If I fold it very neatly, 
 maybe he won ' t notice.</i>

398
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,560
<i>Come in.</i>

399
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,040
I brought you water.

400
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,560
Oh, thank you, Charlie. 
 That's very thoughtful of you.

401
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
<i>Pleasant dreams.</i>

402
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,240
Uncle Charlie...

403
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,800
- I know a secret you don't think I know. 
 - What secret?

404
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,760
Remember I said you couldn't hide 
 anything from me because I'd find it out?

405
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,800
Well, now I know there was something 
 in the evening paper about you.

406
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,720
About me in the evening paper?

407
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,200
<i>And that's why you played that game 
 with Ann and Roger.</i>

408
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,240
You didn't want us to know 
 and you wanted to tear the paper.

409
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,680
Now I know. You might as well tell me.

410
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,560
Well, you've got me there, Charlie.

411
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,480
Only it wasn't about me. 
 It was about, uh...

412
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,080
<i>someone I used to know.</i>

413
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,520
There!

414
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,440
It's none of your business.

415
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,760
Oh! Uncle Charlie, you're hurting me.

416
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,200
- Oh, Charlie. 
 - Your hands.

417
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,560
Charlie, I didn't mean to hurt you.

418
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,600
I was just fooling.

419
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,360
It was nothing. Just... Just some gossip.

420
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,440
Not very pretty, 
 about someone I once met up with.

421
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,080
Not for you to read.

422
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,400
Forget it.

423
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,840
- Good night, young Charlie. 
 - Good night. Pleasant dreams.

424
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,240
- How long is Uncle Charlie staying? 
 - Forever, I hope.

425
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,160
Hasn't he got a house of his own?

426
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,320
Not that I mind you in here,

427
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,920
but I never can tell 
 when I'll want some privacy.

428
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,480
You better go to sleep, baby.

429
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,480
- You said your prayers? 
 - I forgot.

430
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,680
You better say them.

431
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,320
I lay me down to sleep, 
 I pray the Lord my soul to keep -

432
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,240
- Don't bless too many people. It's late. 
 - I pray the Lord my soul to take.

433
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,120
God bless Mama, Papa, Captain Midnight, 
 Veronica Lake and the president -

434
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,200
- You can't say them all tonight, dear. 
 - Oh, and Uncle Charlie. Amen.

435
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,720
- All ready for breakfast? 
 - Oh, coffee, Emmy.

436
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,160
I don't know how you do it. 
 Now, I'm never comfortable eating in bed.

437
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,400
I had to have my meals in bed for a while

438
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,240
after the children came, 
 but I never liked it.

439
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,520
I can't face the world in the morning. 
 I must have coffee before I can speak.

440
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,160
Well, I don't mind pampering you 
 your first morning,

441
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,000
but I think you're the only person 
 in this town to have breakfast at 10:30.

442
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,040
And while you were sleeping, 
 the newspaper called up for an interview.

443
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,520
With me?

444
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,160
And the women's club I belong to 
 wants you to give a little talk.

445
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,040
Women's club.

446
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,360
Oh! Oh, you haven't finished unpacking. 
 I'll do that for you.

447
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,240
<i>- Where ' s Charlie? 
 - She's running around like a mad thing.</i>

448
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,160
She thinks everything needs fixing.

449
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,960
But what I wanted to tell you was that 
 you're not the only celebrity in this town.

450
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,200
<i>- We're all going to be in limelight. 
 - What are you cooking up?</i>

451
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,520
<i>Well, a young man called this morning, 
 said his name was Graham,</i>

452
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,560
<i>and he wants to interview 
 everybody in this house.</i>

453
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,720
<i>- Interview everybody? 
 - That's what he said.</i>

454
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,520
He's being sent around the country 
 by some kind of institute or committee

455
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,280
and he has to pick a representative 
 American family and ask them questions.

456
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,560
<i>It's a kind of a poll. 
 It's called the National Public Survey.</i>

457
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,520
Wonder how he happened 
 to pick this family?

458
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,120
Well, he said he wanted 
 a typical American family.

459
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,760
I told him 
 we weren't a typical American family.

460
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,320
If he's going to ask a lot of questions, 
 he can leave me out of it.

461
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,000
Oh, but you could tell him so much more 
 than any of us could.

462
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,400
- He's going to take our pictures too. 
 - Pictures.

463
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,480
My, isn't that lovely?

464
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,480
You see, there were really, 
 there were two young men.

465
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,080
<i>One of them takes the pictures.</i>

466
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,360
<i>- Oh, there were two. 
 - Yes. Mr Graham was the nicest.</i>

467
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,680
Oh, he doesn't want us 
 to dress up or anything.

468
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,160
<i>He just wants us to act 
 the way we always do.</i>

469
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,640
Emmy, women are fools. 
 They'd fall for anything.

470
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,520
Why do you let two strangers come 
 and turn this place upside down.

471
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,320
<i>Why expose the family 
 to a couple of snoopers?</i>

472
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,520
- You should have more sense. 
 - Why, Charles, I -

473
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,280
<i>- Good morning, Uncle Charlie. 
 - Good morning, Charlie.</i>

474
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,600
Your mother says the Newtons have been 
 picked for all-American suckers.

475
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
- What do you know about it? 
 - Charlie wasn't here when they came.

476
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,760
But really, the way Mr Graham told it, 
 it wasn't like snooping at all.

477
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,360
It was our duty as citizens. 
 It's something the government wants.

478
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,240
<i>- Government? 
 - Well, it's for the public good.</i>

479
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,000
<i>I told them about you andtheplaces 
 you've been and he was very interested.</i>

480
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,480
Now, listen, Emmy. 
 I'll have nothing to do with this.

481
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,680
I'm just a visitor here and my advice 
 to you is to slam the door in his face.

482
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,040
Oh. Well, I-I couldn't do that.

483
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,120
But you don't have to meet him 
 if you don't want to.

484
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,040
Well, I think I'd be kind of exciting.

485
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,480
He'd take your photograph 
 and then we could have it for nothing.

486
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,240
No thank you. I've never been 
 photographed and I don't want to be.

487
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,120
Oh, Charles, how can you talk that way?

488
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,960
I had a photograph of you. 
 I gave it to Charlie.

489
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,560
I tell you, there are none. 
 I guess you've forgotten this one.

490
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,960
Get it, Charlie.

491
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,880
<i>You sure you don't remember?</i>

492
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,240
<i>Of course I don't 
 ever remember being photographed.</i>

493
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,840
<i>46 Burnham Street.</i>

494
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,120
Mm-hm. It was taken 
 the Christmas you got your bicycle.

495
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,560
- Just before your accident. 
 - Uncle Charlie, you were beautiful.

496
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,480
Wasn't he, though? 
 And such a quiet boy. Always reading.

497
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,640
Papa shouldn't have got you that bicycle. 
 You didn't know how to handle it.

498
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,200
He took it right out on the icy road 
 and skidded into a streetcar.

499
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,240
- We thought he was going to die. 
 - I'm glad he didn't.

500
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,000
He almost did. He fractured his skull, 
 and he was laid up so long.

501
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,760
And then, when he was getting well, 
 there was no holding him.

502
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,960
And it was just as though 
 all the rest he had was too much for him

503
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,840
and he had to get into mischief 
 to blow off steam.

504
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,800
He didn't do much reading after that, 
 let me tell you.

505
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,440
It was taken the very day 
 he had his accident.

506
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,840
A few days later when the pictures 
 came home, how mama cried.

507
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,240
She wondered if he'd ever look the same. 
 She wondered if he'd ever be the same.

508
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,560
What's the use of looking backward? 
 What's the use of looking ahead?

509
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Today's the thing. 
 That's my philosophy. Today.

510
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,600
If today's the thing, 
 then you'd better finish your breakfast

511
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,640
and get down to the bank 
 because Joe'll be waiting.

512
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,160
<i>Charlie, don't be late back. 
 The survey men are coming at 4:00.</i>

513
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,680
- Good morning, Charlie. 
 - Hello, Madge.

514
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,240
<i>- Good morning, Charlie. 
 - Hello, Catherine.</i>

515
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,680
Did you see the way they looked at you? 
 I bet they wonder who you are.

516
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,840
Uncle Charlie, I love to walk with you. 
 I want everybody to see you.

517
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,240
<i>There's Papa in that window over there.</i>

518
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,200
Hello, Joe. Can you stop embezzling 
 a minute and give me your attention?

519
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,600
Oh, uh...

520
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,000
Charles, we don't joke 
 about such things here.

521
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,480
Oh, what's a little shortage in the books 
 at the end of the month?

522
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,240
<i>Any good bank clerk can cover up 
 alittle shortage. Isn't that right, Charlie</i>

523
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,080
- Everyone can hear you. 
 - Good. We all know what banks are.

524
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,760
<i>Look all right, but noone knows 
 what goes on when they lock the doors.</i>

525
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,520
<i>Can't fool me, though. 
 Well, Joe, let's see your president.</i>

526
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,760
Still want to open that account, Charles? 
 That's why I'm here.

527
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,040
Well, uh, you wait right here. 
 I'll see if Mr Greene's busy.

528
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,240
And, uh, Charles, he doesn't care much 
 for jokes about banks.

529
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,000
Well, $40,000 is no joke. 
 Not to him, I bet.

530
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,520
It's a joke to me. 
 The whole world's a joke to me.

531
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,880
I'll be right back.

532
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,360
You shouldn't tease Papa like that.

533
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,360
I wasn't teasing him. 
 I just hate this stuffy atmosphere.

534
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,840
They're waving for us to come in.

535
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,280
<i>- Hello, Mr Greene. 
 - Hello, Charlie.</i>

536
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,480
Well, Mr Greene, this is 
 my brother-in-law, Mr Oakley.

537
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,400
- How do you do? 
 - How are you, Mr Oakley?

538
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,720
Well, Mr Greene, I was thinking 
 of settling down here for a while.

539
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,440
Great country. Great country.

540
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,840
We think so. What have you been doing?

541
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,600
I suppose you might call me a promoter. 
 I've done a little bit of everything.

542
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,240
The only trouble is that once I make 
 the money, I'm not interested in it.

543
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,920
Not interested in money?

544
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,600
You know there's money just lying around 
 waiting for somebody to pick it up.

545
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,680
I thought maybe I'd put some of 
 my loose cash away for safekeeping.

546
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,200
<i>- In the bank where Joe works, naturally. 
 - Loose cash?</i>

547
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,000
Well, I got in a habit of carrying a lot 
 of cash with me when I was travelling.

548
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,040
- A dangerous habit. 
 - Never lost a penny in my life.

549
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,520
I guess heaven takes care 
 of fools and scoundrels.

550
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,240
- Yes. 
 - Thirty, thirty-five...

551
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,160
Forty thousand. 
 Shall we start with forty?

552
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,120
<i>- If you'll just write out a deposit slip. 
 - Ah, details.</i>

553
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,720
I'm glad to see you're a man 
 who understands details, Mr Greene.

554
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,080
They're most important to me. 
 Most important. All the little details.

555
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,680
<i>Oh, dear. I'm sorry. 
 I didn't know you were busy.</i>

556
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,320
<i>- We can come back. 
 - Come in, now that you're here.</i>

557
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,600
Mrs Greene, 
 I'd like you to meet my uncle, Mr Oakley.

558
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,240
Uncle Charlie, 
 this is Mrs Greene and Mrs Potter.

559
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,600
Mrs Greene, Miss Potter.

560
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,920
Mrs Potter.

561
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,480
- Something about you made me think - 
 - Yes?

562
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,760
- What did you want, Margaret? 
 - I need some money to go shopping.

563
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,680
There's one good thing 
 in being a widow, isn't there?

564
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,320
You don't have to ask 
 your husband for money.

565
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,760
<i>- Here you are. 
 - Oh, thank you.</i>

566
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,920
- Goodbye, Mr Oakley. 
 - Mrs Potter.

567
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,080
Bye, Mrs Greene.

568
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,080
There. There you are, Mr Greene.

569
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,680
- Charlie, let's see the town. 
 - Goodbye, Mr Oakley.

570
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,680
- Bye, Mr Greene. 
 - Call on us for advice anytime.

571
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,520
- Thank you. 
 - Joe, you may see Mr Oakley out.

572
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,360
Joe, keep your eyes open. 
 You'll have his job in a couple of years.

573
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,160
Here he is.

574
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,520
Those must be the questionnaire men. 
 They're a whole hour early.

575
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,480
I won't see them.

576
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,840
You don't have to if you don't want to. 
 I'll see that you don't.

577
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,800
The way they got around your mother.

578
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,440
I thought she'd have better sense.

579
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,440
<i>- How do you do? 
 - How do you do?</i>

580
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,440
- You must have come to interview us. 
 - My name is Graham, Miss Newton.

581
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,640
- Oh, how do you do? 
 - And this is Fred Saunders.

582
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,880
How do you do? Won't you come in?

583
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,280
- I'll call my mother. 
 - Thank you.

584
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,320
<i>Mother, the government men are here.</i>

585
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,240
<i>Will you sit down?</i>

586
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,520
But you said 4:00. Nothing's ready now.

587
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,760
My husband is still at the bank 
 and-and the house is -

588
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,240
That's all we want now, Mrs Newton, 
 some pictures of the house.

589
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,160
Saunders can get busy 
 and I'd like to ask a few questions.

590
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,720
Alright, but I do wish you'd waited 
 until I had the house looking its best.

591
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,800
<i>I wanted flowers around 
 and fresh curtains in the kitchen.</i>

592
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,640
<i>And there are a lot of things 
 I don't want you to photograph.</i>

593
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,920
<i>- You said you own the house? 
 - Own it? It owns us.</i>

594
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,560
No sooner do I get one thing fixed 
 than something else gets broken.

595
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,800
And then it needs fresh paint and th-

596
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,720
<i>Mr Saunders, I'm very sorry</i>

597
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,880
<i>but you simply cannot 
 take a picture with that chair in it.</i>

598
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,520
<i>- It needs a new slipcover. 
 - And there are, uh, six in your family?</i>

599
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,040
- Five. 
 - Five? But -

600
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,000
<i>Well, my uncle ' s just visiting.</i>

601
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,960
<i>I told you about him. 
 He's here from the East.</i>

602
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,160
My uncle doesn't want to be bothered 
 with a lot of questions.

603
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,400
Well, you see, on a survey, we usually -

604
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,320
<i>He's not interested 
 in a survey</i>

605
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,680
<i>and I promised him 
 he wouldn ' t be bothered.</i>

606
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,600
Well, we'd like it 
 if we could get all of you.

607
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,880
You know, your opinions, 
 what you do or what you want to do.

608
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,120
My uncle's opinions aren't average 
 and I'm afraid they wouldn't help you.

609
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,520
<i>I think when someone asks for privacy, 
 they should have it.</i>

610
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,560
Well, we'll... 
 The whole idea of this thing is that -

611
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,320
Mr Graham, perhaps 
 you'd better choose another family.

612
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,520
We'll do anything you say, of course, 
 but this family seemed right and -

613
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,440
<i>It is a nice family.</i>

614
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,360
Charlie, let the young men go ahead, 
 so long as they're here.

615
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,720
Well, alright.

616
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,600
OK. Saunders, go ahead 
 and get another shot.

617
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,640
Mrs Newton, what organisations 
 do you and your husband belong to?

618
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,560
How about a picture in the kitchen?

619
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,800
Well, I'm afraid the kitchen 
 isn't quite the way I'd like it.

620
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,960
<i>Come along.</i>

621
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,400
If you'll start by breakin' an egg, 
 Mrs Newton.

622
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,240
Oh, but you don't start a cake 
 by breaking an egg.

623
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,440
You have to put 
 the butter and sugar in first.

624
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,400
Survey or no survey, 
 I'm not going to start by breaking an egg.

625
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,120
<i>I thought I'd make a maple cake. 
 My brother Charles loves maple cake.</i>

626
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,360
What does your brother do? 
 I guess he just does about everything.

627
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,200
What does he do? He's just in business. 
 You know, the way men are.

628
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,760
My husband works in a bank, 
 but I think Charles is just in business.

629
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,120
<i>If you really want a picture 
 of me breaking an egg,</i>

630
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,000
you'll have to wait 
 till I cream the butter and sugar.

631
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,920
I'll wait.

632
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,000
I wonder if we could 
 take a look upstairs.

633
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,920
You show us, and your mother can call us 
 when she's ready.

634
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,920
- Alright. 
 - If you'd rather wait, Mr Saunders.

635
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,680
Folding in the eggs 
 has to be done just right.

636
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,600
<i>I can ' t beat them and let them stand.</i>

637
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,000
The minute I hear you've 
 broken the eggs, I'll come right down.

638
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,160
Yes.

639
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,280
I really don't see 
 what you want to look up here for.

640
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,640
Whose room is that? It's mine. 
 My uncle's using it now, though.

641
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,360
I'd like to see what your room looks like. 
 Typical girl, typical room.

642
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,960
Typical of you to ask. 
 My uncle's resting.

643
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,160
I really don't want to disturb him.

644
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,520
- Is there a back stairs? 
 - Mm-hm. Right down the hall.

645
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,160
I'll bet you 50 cents 
 that your uncle isn't in there.

646
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,080
Oh, betting's silly.

647
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,920
All you want to do 
 is photograph my room, doesn't he?

648
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,880
- That's it. 
 - Besides, I know my uncle's in there.

649
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,480
Alright, I'll still bet he isn't. 
 Let me knock and see.

650
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,080
Oh, I'll knock.

651
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,760
Uncle Charlie?

652
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,160
Uncle Charlie, may we come in?

653
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,080
- See? 
 - You were right.

654
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,880
Nice room. Do you mind if I take a picture 
 since he isn't here?

655
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,800
- I don't want to disturb your uncle. 
 - Oh, I suppose so.

656
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,440
But I really can't imagine 
 anyone being interested in my room.

657
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,200
It's not the way I'd like it. 
 I'd like to have it yellow and white.

658
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,120
Might as well let him work in peace.

659
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,760
Besides, I'd like to talk to you.

660
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,640
Your picking us as an average family 
 gave me a funny feeling.

661
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,520
- What kind of a funny feeling? 
 - Oh, I don't know.

662
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,320
I guess I don't like to be and average girl 
 in an average family.

663
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,360
Average families are the best. 
 Look at me.

664
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,760
<i>- I'm from an average family. 
 - As average as ours?</i>

665
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,040
Sure. 
 Besides, I don't think you're average.

666
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,360
Oh, that's because you see me now 
 instead of a few days ago.

667
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,600
I was in the dumps. Then Uncle Charlie 
 came and everything changed.

668
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,560
But your mother said he came last night. 
 Maybe you just think -

669
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,360
I don't think. I know.

670
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,520
Funny, but when I think about how I feel, 
 I always come back to Uncle Charlie.

671
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,560
Are you trying to tell me 
 I shouldn't think he's so wonderful?

672
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,120
<i>- Oh, no. I - 
 - Mr Saunders?</i>

673
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,800
<i>- I'm ready with the eggs. 
 - Mr Saunders mustn't move anything.</i>

674
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,480
<i>- My uncle's awfully neat and fussy. 
 - Saunders is neat and fussy, too.</i>

675
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,440
<i>- Is this your uncle? 
 - Yes, it is.</i>

676
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,840
Now, for one of the hall.

677
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,080
<i>Mr Saunders has been 
 taking pictures of my room.</i>

678
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,280
My sister told me to remind you 
 about eggs and a cake.

679
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,400
I don't like to be photographed. 
 I'll have to ask you for the film.

680
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,600
- Oh, Uncle Charlie. 
 - Give it to me, please.

681
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,160
Give it to him, Fred.

682
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,400
That's too bad. There's a picture 
 of Mrs Newton on this film.

683
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,720
<i>- Excuse me. 
 - The eggs are ready.</i>

684
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,520
<i>I can't let them stand another minute.</i>

685
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,880
That was my last roll of film.

686
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,280
Mr Saunders took 
 Uncle Charlie's picture by mistake

687
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,040
and Uncle Charlie made him 
 give him back the roll.

688
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,760
He wasn't joking 
 about not wanting to be photographed.

689
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,640
We didn't want to start a family feud.

690
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,560
I'll get you 
 making the cake again tomorrow.

691
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,000
I won't be 
 making a cake again tomorrow.

692
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,520
I want to help an important work, 
 but I cannot go on making cakes.

693
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,440
You have helped, Mrs Newton.

694
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,360
And now I'd like to ask another favour.

695
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,640
Could I borrow your daughter? 
 I'd like to look around the town.

696
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,520
- Ann? 
 - Charlie.

697
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,520
Ann would be better. 
 Ann knows everything about everybody.

698
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,320
- Charlie. 
 - Well, if, uh, Charlie doesn't mind.

699
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,920
- I don't mind. 
 - Swell.

700
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,720
- Goodbye, then, Mrs Newton. 
 - Goodbye.

701
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,120
- 6:30? 
 - 6:30.

702
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,280
- OK. Goodbye. 
 - Bye.

703
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,080
- Bye, Mr Saunders. 
 - Bye.

704
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,880
Goodbye.

705
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,400
He seems like a nice young man.

706
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,240
But I thought you were 
 going to the movies with Catherine.

707
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,160
Oh, I'll tell her 
 I don't feel well or something.

708
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,480
- Hello, Charlie. 
 - Well... hello, Catherine. Hello, Shirley.

709
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,760
- Hello. 
 - This is Jack Graham. He's in town.

710
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,680
- How do you do? 
 - Hello.

711
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,120
- How's your throat, Charlie? 
 - Oh, much better. Thank you.

712
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,280
Bill Forest was asking about you.

713
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,800
Oh. Bill Forest?

714
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Well, uh... goodbye.

715
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,160
- Bye. 
 - Goodbye.

716
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,320
I know what you are, really.

717
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,880
You're a detective. There's something 
 the matter and you're a detective.

718
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,400
- Charlie, listen. 
 - I don't want to listen.

719
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,000
Why, you're not on a survey at all.

720
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,920
You lied to us. You lied to Mother.

721
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,120
You just wanted to get in our house. 
 Police.

722
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,000
That's what it is.

723
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,240
What do you want with us? 
 Why are you here, lying to us?

724
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,320
Look, Charlie, you've got to listen to me. 
 You've got to trust me.

725
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,240
When you've done nothing but lie?

726
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,000
And you probably didn't want to 
 take me out at all the way I thought.

727
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,080
You just wanted to ask me 
 a lot of questions.

728
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,960
Have I asked you a lot of questions? 
 Have I?

729
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,360
Alright, I'm a detective. 
 A pretty bad one.

730
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,280
Now, won't you even listen to me?

731
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,640
- Why should I when you lied to me? 
 - I had to.

732
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,400
When I came here to find a man, 
 I hadn't counted on you.

733
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,200
- I hadn't counted on your family. 
 - Find a man? What man?

734
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,760
There's a man loose in this country. 
 We're after him.

735
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,120
We don't know much. 
 We don't even know what he looks like.

736
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,120
Charlie, think. How much 
 do you know about your uncle?

737
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,240
Why, he's my mother's brother. 
 What's he got to do with it?

738
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,320
This man we want may be your uncle.

739
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,000
Oh, I don't believe you. 
 Go away and leave me alone.

740
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,480
We're after one man. 
 Your uncle may be that man.

741
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,920
But in the East, there's another man 
 who's being hunted too,

742
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,400
through Massachusetts and into Maine. 
 He may be the one.

743
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,720
My uncle hasn't done anything.

744
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,520
He knows it would kill 
 my mother if he did.

745
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,240
He's her younger brother, 
 just like Roger is mine.

746
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,240
Why don't they arrest 
 that man in the East?

747
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,520
<i>Why don't you go away 
 and leave us alone?</i>

748
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,560
Charlie, when we were eating tonight 
 and talking about our folks

749
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,040
and what we'd done and how we felt, 
 we were like two ordinary people.

750
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,080
We'd been brought up about the same.

751
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,000
<i>- You liked me and I liked you. 
 - Oh, it doesn't matter now.</i>

752
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,200
What do you mean, "It doesn't matter"? 
 It's the only thing that does.

753
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,520
<i>If it weren't for you, 
 you don't think I ' d care</i>

754
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,560
<i>how or where I caught up 
 with your uncle, do you?</i>

755
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,800
Because if he's the guy, I'm going to 
 catch up with him. Remember that.

756
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,080
<i>And you're going to keep 
 your mouth shut.</i>

757
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,840
<i>You're going to keep your mouth shut 
 because you're such a nice girl</i>

758
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,560
you'd help if you knew 
 your uncle was the man we wanted.

759
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,400
<i>- I wouldn't help you. 
 - And I know you would.</i>

760
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,800
And I'm trying to make it easier for you.

761
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,880
If your uncle's the man we want, 
 we'll get him out of town quietly.

762
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,720
<i>- We won't arrest him here. 
 - Arrest him here? With mother -</i>

763
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,640
<i>I'm trying to tell you we won ' t.</i>

764
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,320
- Please, Charlie. 
 - I won't say anything.

765
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,800
Oh, take me home!

766
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,840
Good night, Charlie.

767
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,920
It's going to be funny 
 when you find out you're wrong.

768
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,360
Good night.

769
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,120
<i>- Hello, Charlie. Home already? 
 - Oh, yes, Dad.</i>

770
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,240
It's so nice out, I thought 
 I'd get some air before I went to bed.

771
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,600
You better run in. Your Uncle Charlie's 
 been asking about you.

772
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,680
I think I'll just go up the back way.

773
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,600
I- I'm tired and I don't feel like talking.

774
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,080
Alright. Suit yourself.

775
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,960
- Take care of yourself. 
 - Mm-hm.

776
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,920
- Good night, Herb. 
 - Good night, Charlie.

777
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,640
Good night, Charlie.

778
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,560
What were we saying, Herb? 
 Did I notice what?

779
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,440
Well, did you taste anything funny

780
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,640
about that coffee you had 
 at my house this evening?

781
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,800
No. It tasted all right.

782
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,960
That's what I mean. It wasn't all right.

783
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,720
- Put something in it? 
 - Put a little soda.

784
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,200
About the same amount that I'd have used 
 if I'd wanted to use poison.

785
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,720
Well, you don't say? 
 I never tasted a thing.

786
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,720
Of course, I might not notice the soda.

787
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,400
You'd notice the soda more 
 than you would the poison.

788
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,600
For all you knew, you might 
 just as well be dead now.

789
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,520
- Aren't you asleep yet, Ann? 
 - Uh-uh.

790
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,080
Charlotte, what are you doing?

791
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,960
Oh, I'm just looking for a recipe 
 I thought I saw,

792
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,560
but it's just so torn up.

793
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,720
They have papers in the "libarry", 
 new ones and old ones.

794
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,600
Miss Corcoran will get them out for you.

795
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,160
She won't even notice 
 if you cut out a little, bitty recipe.

796
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,520
Oh, it's not that important.

797
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,040
What time does the library close?

798
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:07,160
If you read as much as you should, 
 you'd know it closes at 9:00.

799
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,320
Oh, well. 
 If I think about it, maybe I'll go tomorrow.

800
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,920
You really ought to go to sleep, Ann.

801
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,080
Get back there! 
 Get back! Get back!

802
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,400
Just a moment, Charlie. 
 What do you think I am out here for?

803
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,440
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Norton.

804
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,600
Alright. Go ahead.

805
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,120
Oh! Miss Corcoran, please let me in.

806
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,240
Oh, please!

807
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,440
Oh, thank you.

808
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,440
Really, Charlie. You know as well as I do 
 the library closes at 9:00.

809
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,480
If I make one exception, 
 I'll have to make a thousand.

810
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,200
I'm sorry, Mrs Corcoran, but there is something 
 in the paper I've got to see.

811
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,640
I'm surprised at you, Charlie. 
 No consideration.

812
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,400
- Oh, I'll only be a minute. 
 - You've got all day to come here.

813
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,040
I don't know why you want 
 to rush in here tonight like a madwoman.

814
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,680
I'll give you just three minutes.

815
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,760
Can't be anything really awful.

816
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,520
I'll prove to him it isn't.

817
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,840
Page three -

818
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,600
Hello.

819
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,960
- Where's Charlie? 
 - Still asleep. I don't want to wake her.

820
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,960
- Charlie still asleep? 
 - No, she just woke up.

821
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,720
I shouldn't have let her sleep so long, 
 but she needed it.

822
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,360
She doesn't look quite herself. 
 She'll be down for dinner.

823
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,800
Mother, let me finish mashing those.

824
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,760
I'll fix the rest of dinner 
 and get it on the table.

825
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,160
You go talk to Uncle Charlie.

826
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,040
- How do you feel? 
 - Fine.

827
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,560
I must have been tired. I slept like a log.

828
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,880
Uncle Charlie was asking for you again. 
 He's fond of you.

829
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:29,440
That nice young man came to ask 
 after you. I told him you were asleep.

830
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,360
<i>I'm rested now. Is the gravy made?</i>

831
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:40,040
Now you're humming that waltz. 
 Please don't hum that tune anymore.

832
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,040
I've just got it out of my head 
 and don't want it started again.

833
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,640
Please remember, don't hum that tune.

834
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,000
And don't keep getting up 
 every few minutes.

835
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,680
You just sit there and be a real lady.

836
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,960
Alright, if you say so, 
 but at least I can carry in the soup.

837
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,600
Roger, wash your hands! 
 Joe. Charles. Dinner.

838
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:05,880
- Mama - 
 - Ann, don't put things behind your ear.

839
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,040
And don't whisper. 
 Anyone could hear you a block away.

840
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,720
May I sit by you at the table?

841
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,800
<i>By me? I should think 
 you'd want to sit by Uncle Charlie.</i>

842
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,080
<i>- No, I want to sit by you. 
 - Why do you want to change?</i>

843
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,000
Mother, let her change if she wants to.

844
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,160
Roger doesn't mind.

845
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:25,160
No, certainly not. 
 Uncle Charlie might think... Certainly not.

846
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,760
- Mother, let her change. 
 - OK, but Ann has some foolish ideas.

847
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,440
Go in the dining room, both of you.

848
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,320
What's going on here? 
 Have I lost my little girl?

849
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,760
<i>Roger wanted to sit next to you,</i>

850
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,840
and I thought it would be nice 
 if the children took turns.

851
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,600
- I never... 
 - Never what, Roger?

852
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,920
- Nothing. 
 - Come, Ann. Come and help me.

853
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:00,000
Joe! I brought it in by mistake. 
 Nothing special in it.

854
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,360
- Want to look at the headlines, Charles? 
 - Thank you, Joe.

855
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,920
<i>Roger, don't make so much noise 
 with your soup.</i>

856
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:12,360
<i>If he holds his lips together, he 
 could draw it carefully, like a horse.</i>

857
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,240
<i>- Don't be disgusting. 
 - May I dip my bread in it?</i>

858
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,200
<i>- Where's Charlie? 
 - She wanted to serve dinner.</i>

859
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,880
<i>- She ' II be in in a minute. 
 - You're right, Joe.</i>

860
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,080
Nothing special tonight. Oh, here she is!

861
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,000
<i>- Here ' s my girl. 
 - How many hours did you sleep?</i>

862
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,840
If you could tell me 
 the exact minute you went to sleep,

863
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,120
the exact minute you woke up, 
 if you woke up in between

864
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:37,000
and how long you stayed awake 
 each time you woke up,

865
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,880
then I could tell you exactly -

866
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,560
You won't sleep tonight. 
 Nobody who sleeps all day can.

867
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,480
I slept all right, and I kept dreaming,

868
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,240
perfect nightmares 
 about you, Uncle Charlie.

869
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,520
Nightmares about me?

870
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:56,200
You were on a train, 
 running away from something

871
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,760
and when I saw you on the train, 
 I felt terribly happy.

872
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:03,040
<i>How could you feel happy 
 seeing Uncle Charlie on a train?</i>

873
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,640
I don't want to see him on a train. 
 I hope he stays here forever.

874
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:11,680
Well, he has to leave sometime. 
 We have to face the facts.

875
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,320
I like people who face facts.

876
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,760
Well, we're not going 
 to face any such facts as those.

877
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,960
Oh, Ann, 
 would you like to see the funnies?

878
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:26,240
I'm too old for funnies. I read two books 
 a week. I took a sacred oath I would.

879
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,880
Besides, no one's allowed to read 
 at the table. It isn't polite.

880
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,640
Don't correct your elders!

881
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,800
She's right, Emmy. 
 I'm forgetting my manners.

882
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,760
Joe, I'm going to blame this paper on you.

883
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,880
Roger, go to the icebox and bring me 
 a big, red bottle you'll find there.

884
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,080
You can throw the paper away. 
 Dad's read it, you've read it.

885
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,720
We don't need to play any 
 games with it tonight.

886
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,280
<i>Ann, you can help 
 Charlie carry the vegetables.</i>

887
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,160
<i>I saw that bottle 
 when I was getting dinner.</i>

888
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,160
St Paul said, "Take a little wine 
 for thy stomach's sake. "

889
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,160
Wine for dinner sounds so gay!

890
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:03,800
Remember they had the champagne 
 when the oldest Jones girl got married?

891
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,280
This is sparkling burgundy.

892
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,800
One sip and I'll be calling it 
 "sparkling burgledy. "

893
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,040
<i>Maybe I'd better not take any.</i>

894
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,480
Oh... imported.

895
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,080
Imported Frankie and his tweeds?

896
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,240
And his loaded cane.

897
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,440
His loaded everything!

898
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:30,840
<i>Roger, go get four 
 of the small glasses with stems.</i>

899
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:36,400
<i>Charles, I promised Mrs Greene of our 
 club that you'd talk to the ladies.</i>

900
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:41,000
What am I going to talk about? 
 Travel or current events?

901
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,240
<i>Oh, not current events. 
 We get current events.</i>

902
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,400
<i>Who'll my audience be?</i>

903
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,720
Oh, women like myself. 
 Busy with our homes, most of us.

904
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,040
<i>Women keep busy in towns like this.</i>

905
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:56,240
In the cities it's different. 
 Middle-aged widows, husbands dead,

906
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,160
<i>husbands who ' ve spent their lives 
 making fortunes, working and working,</i>

907
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:05,400
<i>and then they die and leave their money 
 to their wives, their silly wives.</i>

908
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:09,040
And what do the wives do, 
 these useless women?

909
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:13,600
You see them in the best hotels 
 every day by the thousands,

910
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,000
drinking the money, eating the money,

911
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,120
losing the money at bridge, 
 playing all day and all night,

912
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,200
smelling of money.

913
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,840
Proud of their jewellery, 
 but of nothing else.

914
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,480
Horrible, faded, fat, greedy women.

915
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,880
<i>But they're alive! They're human beings.</i>

916
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:36,000
Are they? Are they, Charlie?

917
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,240
<i>Are they human, 
 or are they fat, wheezing animals? Hm?</i>

918
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,560
And what happens to animals when 
 they get too fat and too old?

919
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,200
Well, I seem to be making 
 my speech right here.

920
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,920
Don't talk about women like that 
 in front of my club! You'll be lynched.

921
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:57,920
That nice Mrs Potter's going to be there. 
 She was asking me about you.

922
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:02,960
The Greenes are bringing her here to 
 the party I'm having for you afterwards.

923
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,120
<i>Joe, it's Herbert.</i>

924
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,800
He always comes when we're eating.

925
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,680
<i>Good evening, Mrs Newton.</i>

926
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,200
- Good evening, Mr Oakley. 
 - Good evening.

927
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,960
<i>Well, Herb, how's your mother?</i>

928
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,080
Oh, she's just middling.

929
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,800
- Had your dinner? 
 - Oh, I had mine an hour ago.

930
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,400
You folks are getting pretty stylish. 
 Having dinner later every evening.

931
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,400
<i>Ha ha!</i>

932
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,760
<i>- Joe. 
 - Huh?</i>

933
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:43,320
- Joe, I-I picked some mushrooms. 
 - You don't say?

934
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,080
Mushrooms mean anything to you, Joe?

935
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:51,240
I eat 'em on my steak when I'm out 
 and the meat's not good enough as it is.

936
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,480
If I brought you some mushrooms, 
 would you eat 'em?

937
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,400
Suppose I would. Why?

938
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:00,400
Then I've got it. The worst I'd be 
 accused of would be manslaughter.

939
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,160
Doubt if I'd get that. 
 Accidental death, pure and simple.

940
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,560
A basket of good mushrooms and... 
 two or three poisonous ones.

941
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:13,360
No, no. Innocent party might 
 get the poisonous ones.

942
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,840
I thought of something better 
 when I was shaving.

943
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:20,920
A bath tub. Pull the legs out 
 from under you, hold you down.

944
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,520
<i>Oh, what's the matter with you two?</i>

945
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,080
Do you always have to 
 talk about killing people?

946
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,160
We're not talking about killing people.

947
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,200
Herb's talking about killing me, 
 and I'm talking about killing him.

948
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,240
It's your father's way of relaxing.

949
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,440
Can't he find some other way to relax?

950
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:42,080
Can't we have a little peace and quiet 
 without dragging in poisons all the time?

951
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,120
<i>Charlie! 
 She doesn ' t make sense talking like that.</i>

952
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,520
<i>I'm worried about her. 
 Roger, bring her back.</i>

953
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:51,640
I'll go. You stay and finish dinner. 
 I'll catch up with her.

954
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,280
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

955
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:09,600
- Excuse me, Mr Norton. 
 - You're always running around at night.

956
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,400
- Where were you hurrying to last night? 
 - Just doing an errand.

957
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,720
- Is this your uncle I've heard about? 
 - Yes.

958
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,040
- Uncle Charlie, Mr Norton. 
 - Glad to know you. What's the name?

959
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,400
Oakley. Charles Oakley. Nice to meet you.

960
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:26,760
Better keep your eye on your niece. 
 I'll have to give her a ticket for speeding.

961
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,080
- City ordinance about running. 
 - Hear that, Charlie?

962
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,680
Don't want to break the law. 
 I'll take care of her.

963
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,080
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

964
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:38,360
What's the matter, Charlie? 
 What's wrong?

965
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,080
- I want to talk to you. 
 - You're hurting my arm again.

966
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:53,120
- Come in here with me. 
 - I can't. I don't go to places like this.

967
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,280
Go on in.

968
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,720
- Why'd you bring me here? 
 - What does it matter where we are?

969
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,640
Hello, Charlie. Hello.

970
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:16,680
Hello, Louise. 
 Uncle Charlie, Louise Finch.

971
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,200
- This is my uncle. 
 - I was in Charlie's class in school.

972
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:25,320
I sure was surprised to see you come in. 
 I never thought I'd see you here.

973
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,280
I been here two weeks. 
 Lost my job over at Kern's.

974
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:33,200
I've been in half the restaurants in town. 
 What'll you have, Charlie?

975
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:38,400
- Nothing, thank you. 
 - A ginger ale for her, a brandy for me.

976
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,920
- Well, Charlie? 
 - Well?

977
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:45,920
Think you know something, don't you? 
 That young fellow told you something.

978
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,760
Jack? 
 Why should he know anything about you?

979
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:55,840
Charlie, something's come between us. 
 I don't want that to happen.

980
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,680
Why, we're old friends.

981
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,680
More than that. We're like twins.

982
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,000
- You said so yourself. 
 - Don't touch me, Uncle Charlie.

983
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,320
What did that boy tell you?

984
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:17,720
He's got nothing to do with it. I hope 
 he never knows anything about you.

985
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,720
Charlie, 
 you're a pretty understanding sort of girl.

986
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,160
If you've heard 
 some little things about me,

987
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,800
I guess you're a woman of the world 
 enough to overlook them.

988
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:39,400
You're the head of your family, Charlie. 
 Anyone can see that.

989
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,920
I'm not so old. I've been chasing 
 around the globe since I was sixteen.

990
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,160
<i>I guess I've done 
 some pretty foolish things,</i>

991
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,760
made some pretty foolish mistakes.

992
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,520
<i>Nothing serious, just... foolish.</i>

993
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:15,360
Oh, Charlie, now, 
 don't start imagining things.

994
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:20,520
How could you do such things? 
 You're my uncle,

995
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,360
<i>my mother's brother.</i>

996
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,120
We thought you were 
 the most wonderful man in the world.

997
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,760
- The most wonderful and the best. 
 - Charlie, what do you know?

998
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,920
I'm sorry I was so long. 
 We're awful busy.

999
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,240
Whose is it? Ain't it beautiful?

1000
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:51,080
I'd just die for a ring like that.

1001
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,000
Yes sir, for a ring like that, 
 I'd just about die.

1002
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,320
I love jewellery, real jewellery.

1003
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:02,880
Notice I didn't even have to ask 
 if it was real. You can tell.

1004
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,720
- I can. 
 - Bring me another brandy.

1005
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,520
Sit down.

1006
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,680
Sit down!

1007
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,320
You think you know something, 
 don't you?

1008
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,400
You think you're the clever little girl 
 who knows something.

1009
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,240
There's so much you don't know. 
 So much.

1010
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,040
What do you know, really?

1011
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:31,000
You're just an ordinary little girl 
 living in an ordinary little town.

1012
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:35,160
You wake up every day and know there's 
 nothing in the world to trouble you.

1013
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,920
You go through your ordinary little day.

1014
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:43,680
At night, you sleep your ordinary sleep 
 filled with peaceful, stupid dreams.

1015
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,480
And I brought you nightmares.

1016
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,360
Or did I? 
 Or was it a silly, inexpert, little lie?

1017
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,720
You live in a dream. 
 You're a sleepwalker, blind.

1018
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,280
How do you know 
 what the world is like?

1019
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,240
Do you know the world is a foul sty?

1020
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:05,680
<i>Do you know if you ripped 
 the fronts off houses, you'd find swine?</i>

1021
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,120
The world's a hell. 
 What does it matter what happens in it?

1022
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,720
<i>Wake up, Charlie. 
 Use your wits. Learn something!</i>

1023
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,720
You goin', Charlie?

1024
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,800
- Charlie, will you help me? 
 - Help you?

1025
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,120
The same blood flows through our veins. 
 I was at the end of my rope.

1026
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,680
Oh, I'm so tired. There's an end 
 to the running a man can do.

1027
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,560
You'll never know what it's like 
 to be so tired. I was going to...

1028
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:58,400
Then I got the idea of coming out here. 
 It's my last chance, Charlie.

1029
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,040
Give it to me.

1030
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,920
Graham and the other fellow, 
 they don't know.

1031
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,960
There's a man in the east they suspect, 
 and if they get him, I'll...

1032
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,480
Charlie, give me this last chance.

1033
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,000
Take your chance. Go!

1034
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,840
I'll go, Charlie. Just give me a few days.

1035
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,440
Think of your mother. 
 It'll kill your mother.

1036
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:22,760
Yes, it would kill my mother.

1037
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,080
Take your few days. 
 See that you get away from here.

1038
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:29,280
You realise what it'll mean 
 if they get me?

1039
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,360
The electric chair.

1040
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:34,920
Charlie, you've got to help me.

1041
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:40,080
You said yourself we're no ordinary uncle 
 and niece, no matter what I've done.

1042
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,360
You go in. I'll be in in a minute.

1043
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,080
<i>- Home, sweet home. 
 - Where's Charlie?</i>

1044
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,040
<i>- She's outside. Don't worry about her. 
 - What was the matter?</i>

1045
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:07,440
<i>She was a little edgy. I persuaded her 
 to go for a walk. She's calmer now.</i>

1046
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:12,680
<i>- I'm so glad. I've saved dessert for you. 
 - We had an ice-cream soda.</i>

1047
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,680
Oops-a-daisy! Off to bed you go!

1048
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,560
<i>- Roger, come here! 
 - No!</i>

1049
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,520
There's my girl. Psst! Ann!

1050
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,640
Hello! 
 You must be trying to hide or something.

1051
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,720
- We're not hiding. 
 - People who are hiding say "psst".

1052
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,400
- We just don't want to yell on Sunday. 
 - Look, Ann.

1053
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:05,040
Ask your sister to run over here. 
 Just ask her quietly. We'll wait here.

1054
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:08,600
- Did my father have a feud with yours? 
 - My father?

1055
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,600
Because if they didn't, there's no sense 
 in my asking Charlotte quietly.

1056
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,120
Mama won't care. She thinks 
 girls ought to marry and settle down.

1057
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,680
- In a book I'm reading - 
 - Just ask her, Ann. Don't be literary.

1058
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,600
- Alright. 
 - Remember, I'm doing all the talking.

1059
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,920
<i>- Hello. 
 - Hello.</i>

1060
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,360
Good morning, Mr Graham.

1061
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,400
Catherine, this is Mr Saunders.

1062
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,840
- How do you do? 
 - How do you do?

1063
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,280
- Ann says you want to speak to me. 
 - Saunders wants to.

1064
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:44,800
Come on, Ann. 
 Tell Catherine the story of Dracula.

1065
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,960
Come on, Catherine.

1066
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:52,760
- What do you want? 
 - Let them get a little bit ahead.

1067
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:02,040
It's about that photograph we took, 
 the one of your uncle.

1068
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,440
- He probably burned it. 
 - Not that one, he hasn't.

1069
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,760
We gave him the wrong film.

1070
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,080
We got the picture alright. 
 We wired it East.

1071
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,080
They've got witnesses can identify 
 the man we want from that picture.

1072
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,560
- What do you mean, identify him? 
 - Just what I said.

1073
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,800
When the witnesses see that picture, 
 we'll know whether Oakley's the man.

1074
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,880
- We're waiting for the wire now. 
 - And then Uncle Charlie will be -

1075
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,240
That's right. That's the way it is.

1076
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:32,560
Graham thought you could get your uncle 
 to leave town now. It would be better -

1077
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,920
I've got to, haven't I? I've got to! 
 What's the most time you'll give me?

1078
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,880
- Two hours. 
 - I'll make him leave!

1079
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,680
You seem pretty sure 
 he's the man we want. Why?

1080
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:47,160
No reason why. I'm just scared. 
 You're the ones who seem sure.

1081
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,760
- I couldn't bear anything happening here. 
 - You know what he's done?

1082
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,320
- No, I don't want to hear! 
 - Well, I want you to get this.

1083
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:59,560
We're doing you a favour. If you know 
 anything more about your uncle, tell us.

1084
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,960
We also want to know 
 when and how he leaves town.

1085
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,640
- If you hold out on us - 
 - I won't. I'll tell you.

1086
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:09,280
Step on a crack, 
 you'll break your mother's back.

1087
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,920
I wish I knew we could trust you.

1088
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,040
I won't do anything to help him, 
 I promise.

1089
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:18,160
But you can't ask me to spy on him.

1090
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,840
We've made a bargain. 
 I'll get him to leave. That's all I'll do.

1091
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,600
Think, Charlie. The man's dangerous. 
 If he gets away from us -

1092
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:29,640
I don't want to hear what he'll do. 
 We've made a bargain. I'll keep it.

1093
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,240
I'll let you know when he leaves.

1094
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:37,200
Funny if he turned out 
 to be the wrong man. Could be.

1095
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,080
<i>- Ann! 
 - I broke my mother's back three times.</i>

1096
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:45,200
Not bad. You didn't finish telling me 
 whether Miss Rose married the rich guy,

1097
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,200
- or the one she was in love with. 
 - How long have you two such friends?

1098
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,800
Oh, we play games. I ask questions. 
 She knows all the answers.

1099
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,800
<i>The only trouble is 
 I can't make out what she's making up.</i>

1100
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,160
I never make up anything. 
 I get everything from my books.

1101
01:18:58,360 --> 01:18:59,800
They're all true.

1102
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,760
Come on, Ann. We'd better get home 
 and help with dinner. Goodbye.

1103
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,280
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye, Mr Graham. Mr Saunders.

1104
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,440
<i>- Goodbye, Catherine. 
 - Come on, Catherine.</i>

1105
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:13,840
- Why not pick flowers for the table? 
 - Simple flowers are the best.

1106
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:17,280
<i>- I didn't ask for orchids. 
 - I wish I'd been born in the South.</i>

1107
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:20,640
<i>Southern women have a lot of charm. 
 They pick flowers with gloves on.</i>

1108
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,240
- Goodbye, Catherine. 
 - Goodbye, Charlie. See you after dinner.

1109
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,040
Bye.

1110
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,120
<i>- Hello, Ann. 
 - Hello.</i>

1111
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:32,920
How was church, Charlie? Did you 
 count the house? Turn anybody away?

1112
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,320
No, room enough for everyone.

1113
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,440
I'm glad to hear that.

1114
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:41,680
Show's been running such a long time, 
 I thought attendance might be falling off.

1115
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,320
<i>Anything special on the noon broadcast?</i>

1116
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:48,600
They caught that other fellow, 
 the Merry Widow Murderer.

1117
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,840
<i>- They did, did they? Where? 
 - State of Maine. Portland.</i>

1118
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:55,240
Didn't catch him exactly. 
 He was running away from the police,

1119
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:59,680
and they cornered him at the airport 
 and he ran into the propeller of a plane.

1120
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,640
- Oh, boy! 
 - Cut him all to pieces.

1121
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,000
Had to identify him by his clothes.

1122
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,960
His shirts were all initialled, 
 "C," "O," apostrophe "H."

1123
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,520
Well, makes a good ending. 
 Couldn't have done better myself.

1124
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,840
I guess that closes that case pretty final.

1125
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,120
<i>Sure does. 
 Never cared much for that case.</i>

1126
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:21,640
Well, I think I'll go get ready for dinner. 
 I'm hungry. I can eat a good dinner today.

1127
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,560
Charlie, I have great news for you. 
 Where can we talk alone?

1128
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:37,320
We got a wire from Maine. We can call 
 off the job. I'll bet you're relieved. I am.

1129
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,160
Oh, I am relieved.

1130
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,760
<i>You were trying to get youruncle out. 
 He must have thought you were crazy.</i>

1131
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,920
Now that it's over, I don't 
 want to talk about it any more.

1132
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,600
I'd like to pretend the whole 
 dreadful thing never happened.

1133
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,760
<i>- There's nothing to pretend about. 
 - There's mother's gloves.</i>

1134
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,760
Mother and her gloves. 
 She's always losing things.

1135
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:59,080
<i>All mothers lose things. 
 Someday, she'll be losing you.</i>

1136
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,800
Mothers don't lose daughters, 
 they gain sons.

1137
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,200
Yes, but gain isn't always the word. 
 Now, take me.

1138
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,720
Who'd want a detective 
 for a son-in-law?

1139
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,960
- My father would. 
 - He would?

1140
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:16,200
If you told him you were going to marry 
 a detective, he wouldn't disown you?

1141
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,200
It wouldn't have to be me. There's Ann.

1142
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:22,400
No, Ann wants to marry a librarian. 
 She told me.

1143
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:26,200
So she'll always have 
 plenty of books around to read.

1144
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,880
What's the matter?

1145
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,520
I was laughing. 
 It's been so long since I laughed.

1146
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,320
I like it when you laugh.

1147
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:40,520
I like it when you don't. 
 I guess I like you whatever you do.

1148
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:44,960
- I guess I like you. 
 - I'm glad. I like you too.

1149
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:50,120
Funny how you happen to meet someone 
 and like them and... like them.

1150
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,080
Mm-hm.

1151
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,960
- Charlie? 
 - Yes?

1152
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:58,520
I suppose it couldn't ever really happen 
 some day that you'd tell your father...

1153
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:02,280
You know, about marrying someone, 
 a detective, I mean.

1154
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,560
- I don't know. 
 - I didn't mean to tell you.

1155
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,880
I wanted to wait until you'd forgotten 
 the mess we've been through together,

1156
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,920
till you didn't think of me as part 
 of something unpleasant and frightening.

1157
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:16,400
I wanted to wait and come back 
 and then tell you.

1158
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,760
But I can't help it. 
 I want to tell you now.

1159
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,360
I love you, Charlie. I love you terribly.

1160
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,520
I know it's no time to tell you now 
 and I'm sorry. Do you mind?

1161
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,400
- I don't mind. 
 - Do you think you could think about it?

1162
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,640
- About your loving me? 
 - And perhaps your loving me?

1163
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:40,240
I- I'd like us to be friends. I know that. 
 We are friends.

1164
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,840
- I'd like to have that to think about. 
 - Nothing more?

1165
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:48,080
I don't know, Jack. 
 I... just don't know yet.

1166
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:51,240
Alright. But I may come back?

1167
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:55,800
Oh, please come back. 
 Please come back.

1168
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,520
Listen, Charlie.

1169
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,200
When I go, go back to that square 
 in the middle of town.

1170
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,880
Take a good look at it. 
 That's where I first knew I loved you.

1171
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:08,800
That's where we had the fight 
 and I didn't know what to do.

1172
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,800
I like my job, 
 but I didn't like it that night.

1173
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,880
I hated it that night.

1174
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:17,040
- You hate it now? 
 - No, not now.

1175
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:23,280
You know, this is a swell place. 
 I'm going to put a bronze plaque up.

1176
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,400
That door's always banging shut!

1177
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,160
Oh! It sticks.

1178
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,760
Uh!

1179
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,440
What are you two locking yourselves 
 in the garage for?

1180
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,720
- When I was young, it was the parlour. 
 - Hello, Mr Oakley.

1181
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,160
- I was saying goodbye to Charlie. 
 - In the garage?

1182
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,400
The door got stuck. 
 Now I'll have to say goodbye to you.

1183
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,520
Let's say goodbye out here on the lawn. 
 No use taking a chance on the garage.

1184
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:01,560
- Finished here? 
 - All finished, but I'll be back.

1185
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,040
<i>- You ' II be seeing me around. 
 - Oh?</i>

1186
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,400
<i>Not on business, though.</i>

1187
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:10,440
I can understand you coming back. 
 Charlie's a fine girl.

1188
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:12,960
She's the thing I love most in the world.

1189
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:16,280
I mean it. Have a nice trip, Mr Graham.

1190
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,440
And don't take any more photographs 
 without permission.

1191
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,840
Rights of man. You know, freedom?

1192
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,600
We'll have a talk 
 about freedom some day, Mr Oakley.

1193
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,560
- Bye. 
 - Goodbye.

1194
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:39,520
Don't forget to write. 
 Remember, you have the addresses.

1195
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,200
Jack!

1196
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,360
Anything else? I've got butter, fruit, 
 green thread and go to the library.

1197
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:29,640
And whatever vegetable looks freshest. 
 If I've forgotten anything, I'll send Ann.

1198
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,560
Alright.

1199
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,200
Mother!

1200
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,040
Charlie! Darling! Are you hurt?

1201
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,360
I tripped.

1202
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:46,000
Oh, what is it? Is it your ankle?

1203
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,000
I don't think I'm hurt. 
 I grabbed the banister.

1204
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,640
You might have been killed!

1205
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,800
<i>I worry myself sick every time 
 one of you comes down these stairs.</i>

1206
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,720
<i>They're too steep and rickety. 
 They ought to be fixed.</i>

1207
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,000
<i>Are you sure you're all right?</i>

1208
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,160
When are you leaving, Uncle Charlie?

1209
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:46,320
Oh, come now. That other business, 
 it's all over. I'd like to forget it.

1210
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,080
- We're all happy here. 
 - When are you leaving?

1211
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,240
I'm not going, you see.

1212
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,400
Not yet. I'm not going.

1213
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,360
I want to settle down. Live somewhere 
 people know me. Put some money by.

1214
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,840
- Start a business. Be part of the family. 
 - I see.

1215
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:07,280
The most sensible thing for you to do 
 is to be friends with me.

1216
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,080
I can do a lot for you, Charlie, 
 for all of you.

1217
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:14,080
No, not you. 
 We don't want anything from you.

1218
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:18,640
- I wish I'd told my mother about you. 
 - I know what you've been thinking.

1219
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:22,360
How would your mother have felt? 
 What would it do to her now?

1220
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,600
How about your father? 
 His job at the bank?

1221
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,360
What would become of all of you 
 if everything came out?

1222
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,720
You needn't be afraid. I can't tell them.

1223
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,360
But I'm not afraid. What would you tell? 
 Who'd believe you?

1224
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,600
A waltz runs through your head.

1225
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,840
You don't like the initials on a ring and 
 connect it up with a newspaper clipping.

1226
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,400
Now, you haven't even got the ring. 
 I don't know what became of it.

1227
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,360
- You have it. 
 - I?

1228
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,520
I gave it to you.

1229
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,880
I don't want you here, Uncle Charlie. 
 I don't want you to touch my mother.

1230
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:01,880
So go away, I'm warning you. 
 Go away, or I'll kill you myself.

1231
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,960
See? That's the way I feel about you.

1232
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,400
- Here you are, Joe. 
 - Oh, perfume.

1233
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:36,520
- Just the fresh, clean smell of lavender. 
 - Yeah, I know.

1234
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,480
You look very handsome, both of you.

1235
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:42,600
- I'm proud of the two men in my family. 
 - Emmy, you're a dream.

1236
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,240
It's a pity the children 
 have to sit on our laps.

1237
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,560
It's going to be a tight squeeze. 
 It won't do my pants any good.

1238
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:52,120
<i>- Joe, I wish you could drive. 
 - We do it this way.</i>

1239
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:55,720
<i>- Charles, you'll sit - 
 - He can sit in the back with Dad.</i>

1240
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,080
The children can fit in beside them.

1241
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,960
Nonsense. I'm getting a cab. 
 You all go in the taxi.

1242
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:03,800
<i>- Charlie and I'll go in the car. 
 - No, Uncle Charlie, you go in the taxi.</i>

1243
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,160
I want to ride in the taxi!

1244
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,520
Course you do. So it's all arranged.

1245
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:11,480
- Charlie, run out and get the car. 
 - I'd rather drive the family.

1246
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:16,640
I want you to hear my speech 
 on the way. You're my severest critic.

1247
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:21,200
<i>Anyway, we need a taxi. 
 Ann, go call Mr Abercrombie.</i>

1248
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,760
<i>Mother!</i>

1249
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:29,040
Mother, please ride with me. 
 Father can take the children. Please!

1250
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,920
<i>Bet I'll be the only man outside 
 of Charles fool enough to dress up.</i>

1251
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:24,080
<i>Then you'll be the only other on e 
 to be correct. You look distinguished.</i>

1252
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,520
Charles, are you all ready? Joe, are you?

1253
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:29,040
Wait a minute! 
 I've got to get my overcoat.

1254
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,200
Please, dear. Hurry!

1255
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,360
Take your time, Emmy. 
 They can't start till I get there.

1256
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,560
It's getting chilly in here.

1257

<i>Oh! Does it have to be so loud?</i>

1262
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,400

Joe, there's some whisky on my bureau. 
 Get it quick.

01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,440
- Charlie. Charlie. Dear Charlie. 
 - Charlie?

1271

Emmy, rub her feet. 
 Roger, run get something to fan her with.

Charlie? What are you trying to say?

1275

I'm here, darling. Here's mother. 
 That's right, my baby.

1279
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,960
That's right, my brave little girl. Here.

1280
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:16,400
- Take a little sip of this. 
 - No, I'm all right.

1281
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:21,120
- Joe, call Dr Phillips. 
 - No, I'm all right. I just want to get up.

1282
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:25,080
You had a wonderful escape. Someone 
 must have left the motor running.

1283
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:28,640
- I couldn't find the key to turn it off. 
 - The key was there when I went in.

1284
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,920
Lucky thing I passed by.

1285
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:34,480
She might have died. You saved her. 
 You knew just what to do.

1286
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:38,680
- Don't know how I happened across her. 
 - We'll put the lecture off.

1287
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:43,160
Oh, yes, there is. I want you all to go. 
 There's the cab now.

1288
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,920
Oh, I couldn't. I just couldn't go.

1289
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,240
Wh-Who found me in the garage?

1290
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,600
<i>Herb heard you beating on the door.</i>

1291

<i>I was coming across the backyard 
 and I heard gaspin' and bangin'.</i>

1292
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,640

 a human bein' in there.

1293

<i>- Quick thinking, Herb. 
 - Lucky thing.</i>

1294

I'm glad you happened 
 to be going by, Herb.

01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,760
<i>Come on, Mother.</i>

1296
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:07,640
I- I want to stay with you.

1297
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:12,240
I don't feel like making a speech now, 
 when I think what might have happened.

1298
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:16,200
I'm all right. I just want to sit 
 on the porch a while and get the air.

1299
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,120
No, darling, I won't hear of it.

1300
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:23,120
I'm alright, really. I'd rather stay home 
 and get things ready for the party.

1301
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,720
Darling, I want to stay with you.

1302
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,200
Herb, will you take Roger? 
 Ann, you come with us.

1303
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:41,640
I just don't understand it. 
 First the stairs and...

1304
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,200
Mr Graham isn't there?

1305
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,320
This is the Hotel Stewart in Fresno, 
 isn't it?

1306
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,840
And you don't expect him?

1307
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:12,040
I see. Thank you.

1308
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:17,360
He isn't there? 
 Thank you very much. Goodbye.

1309
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,520
Can you tell me where I can reach him?

1310
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:24,720
I've already tried to get him 
 at the address he gave me in Fresno.

1311
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:28,120
Thank you.

1312
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:06,960
Mom, may we have some sandwiches?

1313
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,840
Don't take anything from the dining room. 
 Go in the kitchen.

1314
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:14,120
<i>Please go. And just leave your coats...</i>

1315
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,600
<i>Joe, dear, 
 will you take care of everyone?</i>

1316
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,240
<i>Charlie!</i>

1317
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,160
I'll be right down.

1318
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,280
<i>Well... now... hm.</i>

1319
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:31,480
Now, Mr Oakley. I thought champagne 
 was only for battleships!

1320
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:37,080
None for me, nor I'm sure, for my wife. 
 But we hope you'll all forget we're here.

1321
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:40,320
I'd like to propose a toast to... 
 Isn't Charlie coming down?

1322
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:43,280
She'll be down in a moment. 
 Mrs Potter.

1323
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:48,040
Not that one. Why do I make tomato? 
 They always soak through the bread.

1324
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:52,760
Try one of these. It's whole wheat bread 
 and cream cheese. Paprika makes it pink.

1325
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,200
- Mr Greene. 
 - Mrs Greene, what would you like?

1326
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,000
Thank you.

1327
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,960
- I think I'd like to propose a toast, too. 
 - Emmy.

1328
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:05,120
To our distinguished visitor, who made 
 the best speech heard in town for years.

1329
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:08,320
To that very good fellow, Mr Oakley.

1330
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,920
- Herbie. 
 - Thank you.

1331
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:13,000
<i>We don ' t get many American speakers.</i>

1332
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,880
<i>Seems like foreigners 
 make the best talkers.</i>

1333
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:21,320
Ah, here she is. Now for my toast.

1334
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,240
Charlie...

1335
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,160
You're just in time for a farewell toast.

1336
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:40,160
I hate to break the news to you like this, 
 but tomorrow I must leave Santa Rosa.

1337
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:43,360
- Not forever. 
 - If that isn't the strangest coincidence.

1338
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:46,000
<i>- I'm off to San Francisco. 
 - Charles?</i>

1339
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,360
Oh, Emmy darling, 
 I didn't mean to spoil your fun tonight.

1340
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:54,200
I got a letter today. 
 I have to catch the early morning train.

1341
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:57,080
I'll miss you, Emmy.

1342
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:04,720
But I want you all to know 
 I'll always think of this lovely town...

1343
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:08,760
<i>as a place of hospitality 
 and kindness...</i>

1344
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:12,720
<i>and homes... homes.</i>

1345
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:17,480
- But I can't bear it if you go, Charles. 
 - Oh, Emmy, I'll be back.

1346
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:23,080
<i>I've arranged with Dr Phillips 
 for our little memorial for the children.</i>

1347
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:27,080
It isn't any of the things you've done.

1348
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:33,360
It's just the idea 
 that we were together again. I'm sorry.

1349
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:37,360
<i>But you see, 
 we were so close growing up.</i>

1350
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,920
And then Charles went away, 
 and I got married, and...

1351
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:44,560
<i>Then, you know how it is.</i>

1352
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:48,800
<i>You sort of forget you're you. 
 You're your husband's wife...</i>

1353
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:54,520
We'll be looking for you. We feel 
 you're one of us, don't we, Margaret?

1354
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:58,160
Indeed. I want to thank you 
 on behalf of our club.

1355
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,280
And bless you 
 for your gift to our hospital.

1356
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,920
- The children will bless you, too. 
 - Thank you, sir.

1357
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:07,480
<i>Excuse me, sir, 
 but I-I can hear the train coming now.</i>

1358
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,040
Excuse me.

1359
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,520
Better get aboard, Charles.

1360
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:27,200
Alright. Goodbye, everybody. 
 Roger, Ann, come see the train.

1361
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:30,080
Come on, Charlie. 
 You can see they get off.

1362
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:32,040
Alright.

1363
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,360
<i>I want to see the rooms, 
 the private ones.</i>

1364
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,360
I've seen berths. I've slept in two uppers 
 and one lower with papa.

1365
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,200
- Goodbye, Joe. 
 - Goodbye, Charles.

1366
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:44,520
- Goodbye, Emmy. 
 - Goodbye. And don't forget to write!

1367
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:48,600
I will. You write too. 
 I'll send you my address.

1368
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,560
Goodbye.

1369
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:00,960
Don't jump on the seats, Roger.

1370
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:04,960
Roger, what did I tell you?

1371
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,920
Porter, there's one more bag 
 in the other car. Will you get it, please?

1372
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:15,200
Charlie, the train's going to start. 
 I don't want to get carried away.

1373
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:18,040
Maybe it's too late! 
 Maybe I'll have to go along!

1374
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,280
There's plenty of time. 
 You run along, we'll follow.

1375
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,040
Charlie.

1376
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:24,800
Just a minute.

1377
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:29,960
I want you to know 
 I think you were right to make me leave.

1378
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,440
It's best for your mother, 
 best for all of us.

1379
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:38,560
You saw what happened 
 to her last night.

1380
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:43,280
She's not very strong, you know. 
 I don't think she could stand the shock.

1381
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:46,520
- I remember once, when she was little - 
 - The train's moving!

1382
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:49,880
Listen, Charlie. 
 I want you to forget all about me.

1383
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,720
Forget that I ever came to Santa Rosa.

1384
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,680
Your hands!

1385
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:00,600
Let me go, Uncle Charlie! Let me go!

1386
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,120
I've got to do this, Charlie...

1387
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,960
so long as you know 
 what you do about me.

1388
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,520
Not yet, Charlie. Let it get a little faster.

1389
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:25,880
Just a little faster.

1390
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,320
Faster.

1391
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,920
Now!

1392
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,840
<i>Santa Rosa has gained 
 and lost a son,</i>

1393
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:58,400
<i>a son that she can be proud of.</i>

1394
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:03,040
<i>Brave, generous, kindly. 
 With all of the spendid dignity -</i>

1395
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:06,120
I'm glad you were able to come, Jack.

1396
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:10,080
I couldn't have faced it 
 without someone who knew.

1397
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:15,480
- I did know more. I couldn't tell you. 
 - I know.

1398
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:20,760
He thought the world 
 was a horrible place.

1399
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,600
- He couldn't have been very happy ever. 
 - No.

1400
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:30,240
He didn't trust people. 
 He seemed to hate them.

1401
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:32,600
He hated the whole world.

1402
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:37,360
You know, he said that people like us

1403
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:41,440
had no idea 
 what the world was really like.

1404
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:44,440
Well, it's not quite as bad as that,

1405
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:47,320
but sometimes it needs a lot of watching.

1406
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,320
It seems to go crazy every now and then.

1407
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,480
Like your Uncle Charlie.

1408
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:56,440
<i>The beauty of their souls, 
 and characters live on with us forever.</i>
