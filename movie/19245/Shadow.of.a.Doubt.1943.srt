<i>Come in.</i>

3
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:34,887
斯班塞先生
很抱歉打扰你
Mr Spencer.
Mr Spencer, I hate to bother you...

4
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:37,556
有两个男人来过
but I thought you'd like to know
there were two men here.

5
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:39,558
说是找你的
Two men askin' for you.

6
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:42,519
一个年轻人
另一个老些
A young man and a kind of older man.

7
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:45,522
我说你不在
他们好像不高兴
They was sorry you wasn't in.
I said you wasn't.

8
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:49,860
-他们有说会再来吗?
-没说但我想他们会再来的
- Did they say they'd be back?
- They didn't say, but I think they will.

9
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:54,031
刚才我出去买东西的时候
看见他们在拐角那里等著
Just now, when I had to go to the store,
I seen them standing there at the corner.

10
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,450
也许我应该让他们进来
但不能打扰你
Maybe I shoulda let them in,
only you said not to disturb you -

11
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,371
-是吗?
-我觉得他们会再来的
- Yes.
- And I'm sure They'll be back.

12
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:03,774
你样子看上去很疲惫啊
You look kinda tired to me,
and that's a fact.

13
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:06,109
有些头疼吗?
You got a headache or somethin'?

14
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,738
我想你应该好好休息一下了
I think maybe you need a real rest.
That's what I think.

15
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:13,659
斯班塞先生
你不该把钱到处放
Why, Mr Spencer. You oughtn't to leave
all that money lying around like that.

16
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:16,370
看到这样我觉得很不自然
Oh, it makes me nervous
to see money lying around.

17
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:18,580
世界上不是
所有人都是诚实的
Everybody in the world
ain't honest, you know.

18
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:21,041
但你可以相信我
我是很诚实的
Though I must say I haven't had
much trouble that way.

19
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:25,712
你的一些朋友打电话来了
还叫我不要告诉你
<i>Those friends of yours
told me not to mention they'd called.</i>

20
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:29,341
说想给你一个惊喜
但我还是要说一声
Wanted to surprise you. But I thought
you'd like to know somehow.

21
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,219
是啊当然了如果他们
再来就让他们进来吧
Yes, yes. Of course. If they come back,
you may show them in.

22
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:35,764
有一位叫马丁太太的人
很有意思
Yes. You know, Mrs Martin,
it's very funny.

23
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:39,184
他们并不是我的朋友
还没见过我
They aren't exactly friends of mine.
They've never seen me.

24
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:42,396
-很奇怪是吧?
-的确很奇怪
- That's odd, isn't it?
- 'Tis odd, like you say.

25
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:47,359
既然我在这里
我就要见他们
And now that I'm here,
I'll have to meet them.

26
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:51,488
甚至要出去见他们
I may even go out and meet them.

27
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:54,866
但现在还不是时候
And then again, I may not. Not yet.

28
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:59,371
你继续睡吧
我把窗布拉下来
You go ahead with your nap.
I'll pull down the blind.

29
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,192
你们知道什麽?
你们只是在作势
<i>What do you know?
You're bluffing. You've nothing on me.</i>

30
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,102
邮局吗?
我要发一封电报...
Hello, Postal Union?
I want to send a telegram

31
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:39,440

约瑟夫.牛顿
to Mrs Joseph Newton
in Santa Rosa, California.

32
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,068
下面是内容

Here's the message. Ready?

33
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,446
很想念你们句号
Lonesome for you all. Stop.

34
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,033

35
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,411
周四到达
请来接我
Will arrive Thursday and try and stop me.

36
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,414
准确时间稍後告知
Will wire exact time later.

37
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,708
祝福所有人...
Love to you all...

38
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:02,255
并附上查利叔叔的吻
给小查莉
and a kiss for little Charlie
from her Uncle Charlie.

39
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:06,717
没错签名就是查利叔叔
That's right. That's the signature.
"Uncle Charlie. "

40
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,886
是的圣罗莎
That's right. Santa Rosa.

41
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,015
加州圣罗莎
<i>Santa Rosa, California.</i>

42
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,933
安妮听电话啊
<i>Ann! Answer the telephone.</i>

43
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,500
这里是牛顿家
Newton's residence.
Ann Newton speaking.

44
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,504
噢你好汉德森太太
我是安妮
Oh, hello, Mrs Henderson. This is Ann.

45
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,964
妈妈还没回家
Mother isn't home yet.

46
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,551
电报?我...
A telegram? Well...

47
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,679
我找不到铅笔
还是等她回来吧
I don't see a pencil, so maybe
she better call you back.

48
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,016
我正努力使自己
专注一些...
I'm trying to keep my mind free of things
that don't matter...

49
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,478
因为我在思考许多问题
because I have so much
to keep on my mind.

50
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,730
数不清的问题
Innumerable things.

51
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,192
我会告诉她回电的
谢谢你
I'll have her call back.
Thank you for calling.

52
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,277
再见
Goodbye.

53
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,493
安妮你妈妈呢?
Hello, Ann. Where's your mother?

54
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,495
-她出去了
-出去了?
<i>- She ' s out.
- Out?</i>

55
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,706
邮局的汉德森太太
刚刚打电话来的
Mrs Henderson just called
from the Postal Union Office.

56
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,708
她说我们收到一封电报
She says we have a telegram.

57
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,212
我本可以记下来的
但我找不到铅笔
I would have taken it down,
only I couldn't find a pencil. I looked.

58
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,548
电报吗?
Telegram, eh?

59
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:13,803
我说过你们的萨拉阿姨
如果领到执照就有麻烦了
I knew there'd be trouble if
your Aunt Sarah got her driver's licence.

60
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,514
-事故地点在哪里?
-我没有记下来
<i>- Whereabouts was the accident?
- I didn't take notes.</i>

61
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,308
噢那麽来一个吻好吗?
Oh. Then how about a kiss?

62
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,066
那不是很有趣吗?
我是家里最特别的女孩...
Isn't that the funniest thing?
Here I am, practically a child

63
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,193
看一些你们都不看的书
and I wouldn't read the things you read.

64
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,904
我想那些书
会给你带来恶梦的
Mm-hm. Well, I guess
they'd give you bad dreams.

65
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:36,075
恶梦?爸爸你不明白
那些传说和神话...
Bad dreams? You don't understand, Papa.
Mystery stories have done -

66
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,286
-罗杰呢?
-出去了还有人类的思想...
- Where's Roger?
- Out. The average mind -

67
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:42,331
-查莉呢?
-她在房间里思考
- Where's Charlie?
- Out. No, she's in her room thinking.

68
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,668
别看太多了
对你的眼睛不好
Well, don't read too much.
You'll ruin your eyes.

69
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,671
别看我的书了
你在看什麽?
And leave my book alone.
What's that you're reading?

70
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,924
-艾凡赫
-噢
<i>- Ivanhoe.
- Hm? Oh.</i>

71
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,017
-是谁?
-是我
- Who is it?
- It's me.

72
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,440
怎麽了?
不舒服吗?
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

73
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,901
不我很好
No. I'm perfectly well.

74
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,780
我已经想了很久
然後得出结论我应该放弃
I've just been thinking for hours,
and I've come to the conclusion I give up.

75
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,241
-只能放弃
-你要放弃什麽?
<i>- I simply give up.
- What are you going to give up?</i>

76
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,204
你认为家庭应该是
世界上最美好的事物吗?
Have you ever to thought that a family
should be the most wonderful thing ever?

77
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,789
而我们的家庭正趋向分解
And that this family's
just gone to pieces?

78
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,834
-是吗?
-当然是了
- We have?
- Of course we have.

79
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:32,215
我们只是惯例地生活下去
那种惯例太可怕了
We just sort of go along and
nothing happens. We're in a terrible rut.

80
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,636
几个月前我已经在想了
我们的将来会是怎样?
It's been on my mind for months.
What's going to be our future?

81
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,056
噢查莉别这样
事情不是那麽糟糕的
Oh, come now, Charlie.
Things aren't as bad as that.

82
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,476
-银行一月份已经
给我加薪了   -钱
- The bank gave me a raise last January.
- Money.

83
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:47,480
在我说心灵的时候
你怎麽可以说到钱呢?
How can you talk about money
when I'm talking about souls?

84
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,525
我们一起吃饭然後睡觉
We eat and sleep and that's about all.

85
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,860
并没有真正的交流
We don't even have
any real conversations.

86
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,196
我们只是说话
还有工作
<i>- We just talk.
- And work.</i>

87
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,699
可怜的妈妈
那麽辛苦地工作
Yes. Poor Mother. She works like a dog.

88
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,786
-就像一个佣人
-她在哪里?
<i>- Just like a dog.
- Where is she?</i>

89
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,832
她出去了
她回来了也是一样地工作
She's out. When she comes back,
it'll be the same thing.

90
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,170
做晚餐洗碗然後睡觉
我不明白她怎麽可以忍受
Dinner, then dishes, then bed.
I don't see how she stands it.

91
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,757
你知道她是一个很好的女人
You know,
she's really a wonderful woman.

92
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:19,345
她不仅仅是一个母亲
我们应该为她做些事情
I mean, she's not just a mother. And
I think we ought to do something for her.

93
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:23,015
-你觉得应该吗?
-应该那你认为要做些什麽呢?
<i>- Don ' t you think we should?
- Yeah. What were you thinking of?</i>

94
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:27,478
噢我想不出什麽
Oh, nothing, I suppose.

95
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,856
我想我们只能等待
奇迹出现了
I guess we'll just have to wait
for a miracle or something.

96
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,025
噢查莉你说得对
Oh, now, Charlie, you're right.
Absolutely right.

97
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:37,947
-我会想办法...
-噢我不再相信什麽好意愿了
- I'll figure out some way -
- I don't believe in good intentions now.

98
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,701
-我现在只是等待著奇迹
-噢查莉
- All I'm waiting for now is a miracle.
- Oh, Charlie.

99
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,953
後楼梯真陡啊
Those back stairs are steep.

100
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,706
怎麽了查莉?
怎麽了祖?
What's the matter, Charlie?
What's the matter, Joe?

101
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:51,043
-看来...
-噢我成了唠叨的老太婆了
- Well, it seems that, uh -
- Oh, I've become a nagging old maid.

102
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,380
这帽子你答应会扔掉的
但你还戴著它进城里
You went downtown in that awful old
hat you'd promised you'd throw away.

103
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,633
-妈妈
-亲爱的我戴什麽
帽子有什麽紧要吗?
<i>- Mama.
- Darling, does it matter what hat I wear?</i>

104
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,470
-妈妈
-妈妈你怎麽让
自己的孩子这样向你大喊呢?
<i>- Mama.
- Why do you let that child yell at you?</i>

105
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,223
-如果她...
-我反正都要下去的
- If she -
- I'm going downstairs, anyway.

106
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,143
祖我进来的时候
你们在谈什麽呢?
<i>Joe, what were you
both talking about when I came in?</i>

107
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,145
谈奇迹的事情
<i>Something about a miracle.</i>

108
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,731
没什麽的
查莉只是心情不太好
<i>Oh, it's nothing.
Charlie ' s a bit under the weather.</i>

109
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,774
她很快就会没事的
<i>Oh. Well, she ' II be all right.</i>

110
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,612
好了亲爱的快下去吧
不要站在这里
<i>Well, come on, dear. Let's go
downstairs. No use standing here.</i>

111
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,448
我去喝一瓶啤酒
I'm going to get myself a bottle of beer.

112
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,533
妈妈
我要去发一封电报
Mother, I'm going downtown
and send a telegram.

113
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,911
为什麽
你要发电报给谁?
Why, darling, who do you know
to send a telegram to?

114
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,623
我知道谁可以来拯救我们
I know a wonderful person who'll come
and stir us up. Just the one to save us.

115
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,958
拯救我们?
What do you mean, "save us"?

116
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,128
现在就只有一个人可以做到
All this time, there's been
one right person to save us.

117
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:38,466
-妈妈查理叔叔的地址是什麽?
-查理叔叔?
- What's Uncle Charlie's address?
- Uncle Charlie?

118
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,260
-你不是去问他要钱吧?
-当然不是了
- You're not going to ask him for money?
- Of course not.

119
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,222
那对我们没帮助地址呢?
上次我放在...
That wouldn't help us.
What's his address?

120
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,266
你们知道从药房那里...
- The last address I had -
- Do you know how many steps it is

121
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,185
走回家要走多少步呢?
to get from here
to the drugstore and back?

122
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:53,773
- 649.
-如果你忘记了, 我就不告诉你
- 649.
- If you've forgotten, I won't tell you.

123
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,651
-我记起来了是费城
- I remember. Philadelphia.

124
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,613
-你不能无缘无故地叫一个大忙人过来啊
You can't ask a busy man
to come all this way for nothing.

125
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,032
他会来的, 我的名字是因他而起的
He'll come for me. I'm named after him.

126
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,618
此外, 我们是他唯一的亲戚
Besides, we're the only relatives
he has in the world.

127
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,788
如果从第四街走回来, 就是802步
<i>If you come all the way up Fourth Street, it's 802.</i>

128
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,082
-妈妈你猜猜?
-我没时间去猜
- Mama, guess what?
- I have no time for guessing.

129
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,209
你头发上面的是什麽?
What's that thing in your hair?

130
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:17,547
我要告诉你的
要猜的话有趣一点
Well, I'll tell you anyway, even though
I think it's nicer when people guess.

131
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,759
汉德森太太叫你打电话
给邮局我们有一封电报
Mrs Henderson said to call her at
the telegraph office. We have a telegram.

132
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,178
安妮你不应该
把东西放在耳朵後面的
Ann, I don't think you ought to put things
behind your ears.

133
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:28,307
-会进耳朵里面的
-艾玛安妮说我们有电报
- Something might get into your ear.
- Emmy, Ann says we have a telegram.

134
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,936
我想你应该去查清楚
可能有人病了
I think you ought to find out about it.
Somebody might be sick or something.

135
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:36,399
-汉德森太太没有读出来...
因为我找不到铅笔
Mrs Henderson didn't read the telegram
because I couldn't find a pencil.

136
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:35,219


137
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,527
等我有了屋子之後
我会在周围放满铅笔
When I have a house, it's going
to be full of well-sharpened pencils.

138
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,489
-汉德森太太有说是哪里来的电报吗?
-没有
- Did Mrs Henderson say who it's from?
- No, she didn't.

139
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,789


140
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:46,367
她应该说电报从哪里来的
She might have said who it was from.

141
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,036
-安妮那是我的椅子啊
-我会问清楚的
Come on, Ann. That's my chair.
I'll call up and find out.

142
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,582
你们静一会好吗
If you will be quiet just a second.

143
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,789


144
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,879
你好请接181好吗?
Hello. 181, please. I wonder who it can be?

145
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,799


146
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,965
没什麽就是181
Oh, nothing, Operator. Just 181.

147
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,676
-如果是我姐姐的...
-喂?
<i>- If that's from my sister -
- Hello?</i>

148
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,721
汉德森太太吗?
我是艾玛
Mrs Henderson? This is Emma Newton.

149
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,307
安妮说我有一封电报
Ann says you have a telegram for me.

150
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,309
妈妈你不用那麽大声的
- Mama, you don't have to shout.
- Ssh.

151
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,770
爸爸妈妈
好像没用过电话一样
Really, Papa. You'd think
Mama had never seen a phone.

152
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,898
她这样很不科学
She makes no allowance for science.

153
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,026
认为用声音
就可以压倒听众
She thinks she has to cover the distance
by sheer lungpower.

154
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:24,197
真好啊是周四吗?
Why, how wonderful. Thursday, you say?

155
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,199
似乎有人就要来了
Looks like somebody's coming.

156
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,203
-谁要来啊妈妈?
-那真是最大的惊喜啊
- Who's coming, Ma?
- Well, it's the most wonderful surprise.

157
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,332
是我的弟弟就是他
It's my brother, you know.
My younger brother. The baby.

158
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,211
是啊他被宠坏了家里
最小的一个总会被宠坏的
Yes, of course, a little spoiled.
Families always spoil the youngest.

159
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,423
这真是太好了
<i>Well, it's just simply wonderful.</i>

160
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,468
谢谢你汉德森太太
Thanks most awfully, Mrs Henderson.

161
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,679
好了
Well...

162
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,226
你猜是谁?
查理就要来了
What do you think? Charles is coming.

163
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,228
-谁?
-你们的查理叔叔
- Who?
- Your Uncle Charlie.

164
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,563
-查理叔叔?
Did you say "Charles"?

165
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:03,569
-我们的查莉正去给他发电报呢
-她为什麽那样做呢?
And our Charlie's sending him a telegram.
Now, what made her think to do that?

166
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:58,839


167
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,863
你好啊查莉
你妈妈刚打电话来了
<i>Hello, Charlie. I just called your house.</i>

168
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,574
-你妈妈的电报
-是吗?
- Telegram for your mother.
- Did you?

169
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,743
本来让比尔送过去的
你现在可以拿走了
Gonna send that by Bill Forest,
but you can take it.

170
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,704
-谢谢
-是你叔叔的
Thanks. From your uncle.
The spoiled one.

171
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,748
我叔叔?
查理叔叔?
My uncle? My Uncle Charlie?

172
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,084
是的
Yeah.

173
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,341
汉德森太太
你相信心灵感应吗?
Mrs Henderson,
do you believe in telepathy?

174
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,301
噢那是我的工作啊
Well, I ought to. That's my business.

175
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,680
不是邮件
是心灵感应啊
Oh, not telegraphy. Mental telepathy.

176
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,724
那就是说...
你想到了一些事情
Like...
well, suppose you have a thought,

177
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,602
假设你想到了一个
和你很相似的人
and suppose the thought's about
someone you're in tune with.

178
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:41,065
然後那个与你
相隔千里的人回应你
Then across miles, that person knows
what you're thinking and answers you.

179
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,569
-就是心灵感应
-我不知道你在说什麽
- And it's all mental.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

180
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,946
我只会收发邮件
I only send telegrams the normal way.

181
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,999
他听见我的
He heard me. He heard me.

182
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,764
-奥提斯先生?
-什麽?
<i>- Mr Otis? Mr Otis?
- Yes?</i>

183
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,310
就到圣罗莎了
你应该准备一下
You're almost in Santa Rosa. Want to be
ready when you get into Santa Rosa.

184
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:21,314
-我准备好了谢谢
-那我帮你拿行李出来
<i>- I'm ready now. Thanks.
- Then I'll get all your bags out for you.</i>

185
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,941
-你觉得怎麽了
奥提斯先生?-很好
<i>- How you feelin', Mr Otis?
- Pretty well.</i>

186
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,652
只是有点虚弱
其他都很好
<i>A little weak
but pretty well on the whole.</i>

187
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,654
哦
Mm-hm.

188
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,823
哈里告诉他你是医生吧
Harry, tell the porter you're a doctor.

189
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:34,160
看看他有什麽问题
你也许可以帮他的
Ask if there's anything you can do.
Maybe you can help that poor soul.

190
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,872
我正在休假啊搬运工
我丈夫是医生你去问问他...
- I'm on my vacation.
- My husband's a doctor and if there's -

191
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,417
不必了夫人
他不想见任何人
No, Ma'am. He's a very sick man.
Won't see anyone.

192
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,545
我们上车之後就没见他出来
I haven't set eyes on him myself
since we first got on the train.

193
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,256
你脸色也不太好啊
<i>Well, you don ' t look very well either.</i>

194
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,102
到了孩子们出来吧
Ah, here we are. Come on, children.

195
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,980
把门关好对了
Close the door, there. That's right.

196
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,919
-你就是...
-查理
- Oh, are you -
- Charlie. Young Charlie.

197
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,505
小查莉我开始
还认不出来呢我以为你病了
At first, I didn't know you.
I thought you were sick.

198
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,382
-病了?
-你没病的
- Sick?
- You aren't sick, are you?

199
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,634
爸爸他在这里!
Look, Pop! Here he is!

200
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,096
查理叔叔你没病啊
真有点奇怪
Why, Uncle Charlie, you're not sick.
That was the funniest thing.

201
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:22,143
-我病了?祖你好啊
-你好查理
- Me, sick? Well, Joe, how are you?
- Alright, Charles.

202
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,396
你们好啊罗杰安妮
应该认不出我了
Roger. Hello, Ann.
I bet you don't remember me.

203
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,941
我隐约记起
你样子好像不同了
I remember you sort of.
You look different.

204
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,819
我们赶快回去吧
艾玛就做好晚餐了
Well, we better get started.
Emma's got the dinner almost ready.

205
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,114
她不能来车站
晚餐第一啊
I couldn't persuade her to come
to the station. Dinner came first.

206
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,117
-罗杰拿行李我来吧查理
-谢谢祖
- Roger, get the bags. I'll take that.
- Thank you, Joe.

207
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,912
到了来吧
That's it. Come on. Let's go.

208
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,521
罗杰
拿这些行李
<i>Come on, Roger, get these bags.</i>

209
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,441
噢对你来说真的不重吗?
You, uh, sure that isn't
too heavy for you?

210
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,653
没什麽
我喜欢搬东西的
Oh, no. It's nothing. I love to carry.

211
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,158
艾玛别动
Emma. Don't move.

212
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,494
站在那里
你不像是艾玛.牛顿
Standing there,
you don't look like Emma Newton.

213
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,498
你还是艾玛.奥克里
住在明尼苏达州
圣保罗市本翰大街46号
You look like Emma Spencer Oakley of
46 Burnham Street, St Paul, Minnesota.

214
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,292
-那一区最漂亮的女孩!
-查理
- The prettiest girl on the block.
- Charles.

215
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,879
查莉妈妈车站里
只有叔叔一个人下车
Mama, nobody got off the train
but Uncle Charlie.

216
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,423
-让我看看你
-只有我们在那里接人
- Let me look at you.
- There was only us meeting somebody.

217
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,844
很难想像你会来这里
- To think you could take the time off.
- There was only one bed made up.

218
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,556
-噢查理你来了真好
-艾玛别哭啊
- It's so wonderful to have you here.
- Emmy, Emmy, don't cry.

219
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,100
你在想起
本翰大街46号吧
And imagine your thinking
of 46 Burnham Street.

220
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,519
我很多年没想过那里了
I haven't thought of that
funny old street in years.

221
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,939
我一直想起过去那些
美好的事情艾玛他样子怎麽了?
I keep remembering those things.
All the old things.

222
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,359
还是没变对吧?
<i>Emmy, how's he look?
Same old Charles, eh?</i>

223
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:56,279
罗杰安妮
去拿那些包
Roger, Ann, get these other bags.

224
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,870
你就住在查莉的房间里
<i>You have Charlie's room
right here at the head of the stairs.</i>

225
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:08,416
艾玛本想安妮搬出来的
但查理说你在这里会舒服些
Emmy wanted to move Ann, but Charlie
thought you'd be more comfortable here.

226
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,585
来吧罗杰
<i>Come on, Roger.</i>

227
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:14,088
-别把帽子放在床上啊
-你也迷信吗祖?
- Ah-ah! Don't put the hat on the bed.
- Superstitious, Joe?

228
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:17,175
不但我不想
带来什麽麻烦事
No, but I don't believe in inviting trouble.

229
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,348
那游艇并不是最大的
但在图书馆里有壁炉...
It wasn't the biggest yacht in the world,
but it had a fireplace in the library

230
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,434
酒吧的面板都是桃木做的
and the bar was panelled
in bleached mahogany.

231
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:13,147
只要按那个键...好了
不说我的
You pushed a button and...
What am I talking about? That's all over.

232
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,107
说说你们吧
<i>Let's talk about you.</i>

233
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,736
查莉这是我见你
穿过的最漂亮的裙子啊
Charlie,
that's the prettiest dress I ever saw.

234
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,780
我也这样认为啊
<i>I think so, too.</i>

235
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,407
查理你忘记了吗?
Why, Charles, don't you remember?

236
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,409
忘记?忘记什麽?
Remember? Remember what?

237
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,120
查理叔叔
这是你寄给我的是吗?
- Why, Uncle Charlie, you sent it to me.
- I did?

238
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,290
是啊看我
总是忘了一些事情
Well, say, I've been sitting here
all this time forgetting something.

239
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,335
安妮罗杰
Ann. Roger.

240
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:38,589
-看看你们
-祖不知道你有没有
- Look at that. Oh, dear now.
- Joe. Don't know whether you had one.

241
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,593
不用给我买礼物吧
给孩子们就可以了
You didn't have to think of me, Charles.
Presents for the children are alright.

242
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,555
噢...我还没有过
一苹腕表呢
Say... I've never had a wristwatch.

243
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,516
银行里的同事
还说我是运动型呢
Fellows at the bank'll think
I'm quite a sport.

244
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,979
艾玛你有两份
一新一旧
<i>I have two for you, Emmy.
One old and one new.</i>

245
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,523
噢查理
是什麽呢?
<i>Oh, Charles. What is it?</i>

246
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,860
你真是...
<i>- You shouldn't have. Really. No.
- Well, yeah.</i>

247
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,656
噢查理
Oh, Charles.

248
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:07,118
多麽漂亮啊
Oh, how... beautiful.

249
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,203
我总想有一件的
Oh, I've-I've always wanted one.

250
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,373
是啊妈妈
你应该有一件的
Oh, Mother, it's exactly right.
It's what you should have.

251
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,625
看看
Look, Emmy.

252
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,842
查理你一直带在身边
Charles. You've had these all along.

253
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,012
是啊艾玛很多年了
<i>Mm-hm. All along, Emmy.
All these years.</i>

254
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,764
无论去哪里
都存放在保险箱
Safe in a deposit box,
no matter where I was.

255
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,975
噢是外公和外婆吗?
Oh. Grandpa and Grandma?

256
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,352
1888年
1888.

257
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,605
53年前了
<i>53 years ago.</i>

258
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,274
-他们很和蔼对吗?
-噢她很美啊
Aren't they sweet?
My, she was pretty.

259
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,903
在那个时候
每个人都很美的
Everybody was sweet and pretty then.
The whole world.

260
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,656
一个精彩的世界
不像现在的那样
A wonderful world.
Not like the world today.

261
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,035
不像现在的世界
Not like the world now.

262
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,037
那时候年轻真好
It was great to be young then.

263
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,290
我们现在很开心啊
看看大家
We're all happy now, Uncle Charlie.
Look at us.

264
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:58,419
-我们第一次同时那麽开心
-现在是你的礼物了查莉
- And we're all happy at the same time.
- Now, for your present, Charlie.

265
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:03,007
噢我什麽都不需要
现在已经很满足了
Oh, I don't want anything.
Right now, I have enough.

266
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,051
你来之前
我以为我需要很多东西
Before you came,
I didn't think I had anything,

267
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:09,222
但现在我觉得不需要了
but now I don't want another thing.

268
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,141
-她傻了
-她并不是傻了
- She's crazy.
- She doesn't mean it.

269
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,728
她其实是在假装
像小说里面的女孩那样
If you ask me, I think she's putting on,
like girls in books.

270
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,898
口里说不需要
而後来就什麽都想要
The ones that say they don't want
anything always get more in the end.

271
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,151
-她是这样想的
-她不傻啊
- That's what she's hoping.
- She's not crazy.

272
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,237
在班里她是最聪明的
The smartest girl
in her class at school.

273
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:29,242
-独自一人在辩论赛中赢了里奇门中学辩论队
-她很有头脑的
<i>Won the debate against theEast
Richmond HighSchool. She's got brains.</i>

274
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:37,124
我是认真的
不必给我任何东西
I meant it.
Please don't give me anything.

275
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,794
-为什麽?
-我不知道怎麽解释
- Nothing?
- Oh, I can't explain it.

276
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:44,924
你来了之後
妈妈很开心...
But you came here
and Mother's so happy and...

277
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:49,303
噢我很高兴我们名字一样
Oh, I'm glad that she named me after you
and that she thinks we're both alike.

278
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:53,099
我想我们是相同的
I think we are, too. I know it.

279
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:56,727
你送我东西的话
会破坏事情的
Oh, it would spoil things
if you should give me anything.

280
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:00,940
你真是个奇怪的女孩
那会破坏什麽事呢?
You're a strange girl, Charlie.
Why would it spoil things?

281
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:05,945
因为我们并不仅
是叔叔和外甥女关系
Because we're not just an uncle
and a niece. It's something else.

282
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:10,575
我了解你
别人了解你不多
I know you. I know that you don't
tell people a lot of things.

283
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:16,497
我觉得在你身上有些事情...
I don't either. I have a feeling
that inside you somewhere,

284
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:19,750
没有其他任何人知道
<i>there's something nobody knows about.</i>

285
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,253
没有人知道?
Something... nobody knows?

286
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,007
是一些很惊奇的事情
我会知道的
Something secret and wonderful and...
I'll find it out.

287
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,969
知道太多并不好啊查莉
It's not good
to find out too much, Charlie.

288
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,847
我们就像双胞胎
不是吗?
But we're sort of like twins.
Don't you see?

289
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:37,310
-我们都知道的
-把手给我查莉
- We have to know.
- Give me your hand, Charlie.

290
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,657
谢谢你
Thank you.

291
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:55,578
-你不看一眼啊
-我不需要看了
- You didn't even look at it.
- I don't have to.

292
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,747
你送我什麽都是一样的
No matter what you gave me,
it'd be the same.

293
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,832
让我给你看看吧
Here. Let me show you.

294
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,838
这是一颗绿宝石
很漂亮的
It's a good emerald. A really good one.

295
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:12,929
绿宝石是世上
最美丽的东西
Good emeralds are
the most beautiful things in the world.

296
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,064
-你刻了一些字在上面
-没有啊如果你要我帮你拿去刻
- You've had something engraved.
- I haven't, but I will if you like it.

297
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,691
有的查理叔叔
不过有点模糊
Yes, you have, Uncle Charlie.
It's very faint.

298
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,529
B.M赠予T.S
"T.S. From B.M."

299
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,990
像是人名的缩写啊
But... Why, it must be someone's initials.

300
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,787
那麽我是给珠宝商骗了
Well, I've been rooked.
The jeweller rooked me.

301
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:40,206
-噢没所谓的
-先还我吧我叫人把字去掉
- Oh, it doesn't matter. Really.
- Give it back. I'll have it taken off.

302
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,708
不我喜欢
No, No. I like it this way.

303
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,878
其他人可能会
很喜欢这个的
Someone else was probably happy
with this ring.

304
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,840
噢真的很美
Oh, it's perfect the way it is.

305
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,342
你端咖啡吧
You bring the coffee.

306
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,905
在餐桌上唱歌
会嫁一个呆丈夫的
Sing at the table,
you'll marry a crazy husband.

307
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:15,992
迷信已被证明
是绝对错误的
Superstitions have been
proved 100% wrong.

308
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,579
对了我想把一些钱
转来这里
Yes, I've been thinking of transferring
some money out here from the East.

309
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,789
在我有计划前
先存在你们银行里祖
I could put it in your bank, Joe,
until I found out what's what.

310
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:25,209
我想你们银行
可以存钱的吧?
Uh, I suppose your bank
does take money, huh?

311
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,546
那是我们的一项
赚快钱的业务啊
That's one thing we do.
Rake in the dough.

312
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,548
但不保证可以拿回来
Can't promise to give it back.

313
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,592
我明天早\'上
就去开一个户口
Well, I'll go downtown in the morning
and open an account.

314
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,346
-4万美金应该够了吧?
-那是很大的一笔钱啊
- 30 or 40,000 just to start things off?
- That's a lot of money.

315
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:40,016
他不会保留很久的
政府会拿走他的钱
He won't have it long.
The government will get it.

316
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:43,311
-政府只会...
-不要说些反政府的话啊罗杰
- The government gets -
- Don't talk against the government.

317
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,773
天啊
<i>The way men do things.</i>

318
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,526
我的脑子里总是出现那首曲
I can't get that tune out of my head.

319
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,279
可能有人告诉过我
但我忘记了
Maybe if somebody tells me what it is,
I'll forget it.

320
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,282
-是一首华尔兹
-我知道但是哪一首呢?
<i>- It's a waltz.
- I know it is, but what one?</i>

321
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,326
真的很奇怪
<i>You know, it's the funniest thing.</i>

322
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,745
我脑子里总是
出现那首曲...
<i>Sometimes I get a tune
in my head like that</i>

323
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,789
不久我好像听到有人也在哼
and pretty soon, I hear
somebody else humming it too.

324
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:06,167
我想那首曲一定
在大脑里传来传去
I think tunes jump from head to head.

325
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,295
你知道那是什麽吗
查理叔叔?
<i>Do you know whatit is,
Uncle Charlie?</i>

326
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:12,173
不我不知道
Uh, no. No. I-I-I don't know what it is.

327
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:16,969
让我想想...
<i>I remember.
Uh... It's on the tip of my tongue.</i>

328
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:19,263
应该是维克托.贺伯特
<i>It's a waltz and it's Victor Herbert.</i>

329
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:23,935
-维克托.贺伯特不是华尔兹啊
-应该是蓝色多瑙河吧
- Victor Herbert wasn't a waltz.
- It's the Blue Danube Waltz.

330
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:27,063
噢是啊
Oh, yes. Of course it is.

331
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,652
不不是的查理叔叔
我知道了是快乐...
No, it isn't, Uncle Charlie.
I know what it is. It's the Merry -

332
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,113
对不起搞得一团糟
- I'm terribly sorry, Emmy.
- Nothing to make a fuss about.

333
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,450
查理我们洗碗的时候
你去客厅那里...
Charles, while we do the dishes,
why don't you come in the living room

334
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,994
坐在沙发上看看报纸吧
and stretch out on the sofa
and read the evening paper?

335
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,996
你也帮不了什麽
You never were much on helping.

336
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,750
-祖贺博来了
-安妮罗杰来帮我
<i>- Joe, here's Herbert.
- Ann, Roger, help me here.</i>

337
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:51,003
贺博是祖的朋友
他们是评论家
Herbert's a friend of Joe's.
They're literary critics.

338
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,841
你好啊贺博
吃过晚饭了吗?
Hello, Herb. Had your supper?

339
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,344
-一小时前就吃了
-是吗?
- Had mine an hour ago.
- Hour ago, huh?

340
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:00,346
-噢手表
-是礼物
- Oh. A watch.
- Yeah, a present.

341
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:04,016
贺博这位是我内弟
Here, Herb.
I'd like you to meet my brother-in-law.

342
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:07,562
-查理这位是贺博
-你好贺博
- Charles, this is Herb Hawkins.
- Nice to know you, Mr Hawkins.

343
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,981
-谢谢
-贺博你母亲还好吗?
- Fine, thank you.
- How's your mother, Herb?

344
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,734
噢还在恢复
- Oh, uh, just middling.
- Uh-huh.

345
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:15,695
不好意思贺博
- Excuse me, Herb.
- Oh.

346
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:19,031
-噢
-你妈妈的事我很难过
Thank you.
I'm sorry your mother's not better.

347
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,243
-谢谢你
-谢谢
- Thank you, dear. There, now.
- Thank you.

348
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,996
过一种清闲的生活吧
<i>Lead a life of luxury.</i>

349
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,917
我要去看查莉在做什麽
<i>Well, I must go and see
what Charlie ' s doing.</i>

350
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:37,133
我内弟从东部来
纽约人
Wife's brother from the East.
New York man.

351
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:40,553
对孩子们好啊
明白我的意思吗?
Good for the children.
You know what I mean?

352
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:45,266
在生意上?
他可是一个很出众的人
In business?
Well, he takes himself very seriously.

353
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,852
你的事怎麽了?
Well, how's everything?

354
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,063
你看过这本书吗?
Say, ha-have you read this one? Huh?

355
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:53,065
那个法国人把难题都解决了
That little Frenchman beats them all.

356
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,985
就像福尔摩斯那样
You can talk all you like
about Sherlock Holmes.

357
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:57,987
那个法国人把难题都解决了
That little Frenchman beats 'em all.

358
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:01,449
我看过了
但注射气泡未必可以致命
I read it. Air bubbles don't
necessarily kill a person.

359
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,452
那些作家想像力太丰富了
Those writers from the other side
get too fancy.

360
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,830
-谋杀的最好方法就是...
-我知道我知道
- The best way to commit a murder-
- I know, I know.

361
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,082
用硬器打击头的後部
Hit 'em on the head
with a blunt instrument.

362
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,710
对极了不是吗?听著
Well, it's true, isn't it? Listen.

363
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,837
如果我想明天谋杀你
If I wanted to murder you tomorrow,

364
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:17,924
我还会浪费时间
去给你做皮下注射吗?
do you think
I'd waste my time on fancy hypodermics?

365
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:19,967
-或者是伊尼?
-那是什麽?
- Or on Inee?
- What's that?

366
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,887
伊尼是一种
印度毒箭上的毒药   哦
- Inee. Indian arrow poison.
- Oh.

367
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:27,308
如果我发现你一个人走著
Listen,
I'd find out if you were alone, walk in,

368
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:30,603
我就用铁管给你的头几下
hit you on the head with a piece
of lead pipe or a loaded cane -

369
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,688
那有什麽意思?
What'd be the fun of that?

370
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,441
你的计划呢?
你的线索呢?
Where's your planning?
Where's your clues?

371
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,110
我不想有什麽线索
我只想谋杀你
I don't want any clues.
I want to murder you.

372
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,488
我要线索来做什麽?
What do I want with clues?

373
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,616
如果没有线索那怎麽成书?
Well, if you haven't got any clues,
where's your book?

374
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:48,329
我不是在说写书
我说的是要谋杀你!
I'm not talkin' 'bout writing books.
I'm talking about killing you!

375
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:52,458
如果我要谋杀你的话
我才不会用那些笨重的工具
If I was going to kill you, I wouldn't do
a dumb thing like hitting you on the head.

376
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:56,003
首先
我不想被人找到指纹
First of all,
I don't like the fingerprint angle.

377
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:59,173
我会戴手套
将你的手按在那铁管上...
Of course, I could always wear gloves,
press your hands against the pipe

378
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:03,302
造成是你自杀的情形,噢!
after you were dead
and make you look like a suicide.

379
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:09,433
但那是很难让人相信你是自杀的
所以我要谋杀你而不被看出是谋杀
But you wouldn't beat yourself to death.
I'd do it so it didn't look like murder.

380
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,168
-安妮?
Oh, Ann?

381
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:39,130
-什麽?
-来这里
<i>- What?
- Come here.</i>

382
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:43,509
你见过怎样用报纸
做一间房子吗?
Did you ever see a house
made out of newspapers?

383
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:45,887
看好了
Well, watch.

384
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:49,849
先拿一张报纸出来
You-You take one sheet here.

385
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:53,102
然後在这里撕开
OK? And you tear it down here.

386
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:55,855
那里也撕开
And you tear it there.

387
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,900
然後从两边折起来
You fold it over here at the side.

388
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,986
叠在一起
<i>Fold over the other side here.</i>

389
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:04,363
这样竖起来
And turn it up there.

390
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:07,033
然後门口...
Now with... the door...

391
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,911
就是这里了
Right off... and there.

392
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:13,998
我已经不是小孩了
而且这是爸爸的报纸
I'm not a baby any more.
Besides, that's Papa's paper.

393
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:17,919
罗杰看看这是什麽
一间可爱的小棚子
<i>Oh, Roger, look what
we ' ve got. A nice, little red barn.</i>

394
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:22,048
-那是爸爸的报纸啊
-没什麽的
- You've got Papa's paper.
- Oh, that's alright.

395
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:25,259
再摊开就没事了
-没人会看出来的
<i>Simply unfold it.
Nobody will ever know the difference.</i>

396
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,220
-你们在做什麽?
What are you two doing?

397
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:31,057
-你们都知道那是爸爸的报纸
-噢查莉是我的错, 我在玩个小游戏
<i>- You know that's father's paper.
- It's my fault. I was playing a game.</i>

398
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:34,685
-不知道那是你爸爸的报纸
-噢没什麽
<i>- Didn't think about it as Joe's pap.
- Oh, that's alright.</i>

399
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:38,564
第一页第五页
第八页...
Here's page one, five... eight.

400
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,401
-第三和第四页在哪里?
-我们没碰过啊
- What did you do with three and four?
- We never touched it.

401
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,571
只有查理叔叔碰过
<i>Really. Uncle Charlie ' s
the only one that touched it.</i>

402
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,240
应该没什麽的
Oh, well. I guess it's all right.

403
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:50,117
放整齐一点
爸爸可能看不出来
<i>If I fold it very neatly,
maybe he won ' t notice.</i>

404
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,169
请进
<i>Come in.</i>

405
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:03,809


406
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,755
-我给你拿了些水
I brought you water.

407
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,383
-谢谢你
Oh, thank you, Charlie.
That's very thoughtful of you.

408
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,926
祝你好梦
<i>Pleasant dreams.</i>

409
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,348
-查理叔叔
Uncle Charlie...

410
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:17,103
我知道了一些你以为我不知道的秘密
什麽秘密?
- I know a secret you don't think I know.
- What secret?

411
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:22,275
记得我说过不要隐藏什麽
因为我会发现的吗?
Remember I said you couldn't hide
anything from me because I'd find it out?

412
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:25,444
现在我知道今晚的报纸
和你是有关系的
Well, now I know there was something
in the evening paper about you.

413
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,489
-和我有关?
-是的
About me in the evening paper?

414
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:31,075
所以你才和
安妮和罗杰玩那游戏
<i>And that's why you played that game
with Ann and Roger.</i>

415
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:34,245
你不想我们知道
并把报纸撕掉了
You didn't want us to know
and you wanted to tear the paper.

416
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,746
我想你应该告诉我吧
Now I know. You might as well tell me.

417
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:39,792
被你捉到了查莉
Well, you've got me there, Charlie.

418
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,794
并不完全和我有关只是...
Only it wasn't about me.
It was about, uh...

419
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,505
我以前认识的某人
<i>someone I used to know.</i>

420
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,092
看看!
There!

421
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:51,137
那不关你的事!
It's none of your business.

422
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:54,599
噢查理叔叔
你弄痛我了
Oh! Uncle Charlie, you're hurting me.

423
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,143
噢查莉你的手
- Oh, Charlie.
- Your hands.

424
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,646
查莉我无意弄痛你的
Charlie, I didn't mean to hurt you.

425
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:03,816
我是玩著的
I was just fooling.

426
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:07,737
那只是...一些流言
It was nothing. Just... Just some gossip.

427
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:11,991
是我以前的朋友的绯闻
Not very pretty,
about someone I once met up with.

428
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:16,829
不适合你们看的
Not for you to read.

429
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,334
忘记它吧
Forget it.

430
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:27,006
-晚安小查莉
-晚安查理叔叔好梦
- Good night, young Charlie.
- Good night. Pleasant dreams.

431
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:46,192
-查理叔叔会逗留多久?
-他不走就好了
- How long is Uncle Charlie staying?
- Forever, I hope.

432
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,194
他自己没有屋子吗?
Hasn't he got a house of his own?

433
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:49,403
既然你现在来这里了
我希望...
Not that I mind you in here,

434
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:53,157
可以保留一点隐私
but I never can tell
when I'll want some privacy.

435
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,827
你还是睡觉吧小宝贝
You better go to sleep, baby.

436
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:57,912
-祈祷了吗?
-我忘记了
- You said your prayers?
- I forgot.

437
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,206
还是祈祷吧
You better say them.

438
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:04,001
我即将睡觉
希望上帝...
I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep -

439
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,046
-别说太说很晚了
-带走我的心灵
- Don't bless too many people. It's late.
- I pray the Lord my soul to take.

440
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:11,092
愿上帝保佑我妈妈爸爸
还有总统...
God bless Mama, Papa, Captain Midnight,
Veronica Lake and the president -

441
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:16,389
-亲爱的你这样说没完没了啊
-还有查理叔叔阿门
- You can't say them all tonight, dear.
- Oh, and Uncle Charlie. Amen.

442
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:52,383
-准备好吃早\'餐了吗?
-噢是咖啡啊艾玛
- All ready for breakfast?
- Oh, coffee, Emmy.

443
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:55,970
我不知道你怎麽会
喜欢在床上吃东西
I don't know how you do it.
Now, I'm never comfortable eating in bed.

444
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,306
孩子们回来之後
我有时也会在床上吃...
I had to have my meals in bed for a while

445
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:01,267
但我不喜欢那样
after the children came,
but I never liked it.

446
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:04,687
早\'上我不知道该做什麽好
说话前也要先喝一杯咖啡
I can't face the world in the morning.
I must have coffee before I can speak.

447
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:07,440
我不介意纵容你一下
Well, I don't mind pampering you
your first morning,

448
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:11,444
但我想你在镇是唯一
在十点半吃早\'餐的人了
but I think you're the only person
in this town to have breakfast at 10:30.

449
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:14,614
你还在睡的时候
报社的人说想来做个访问
And while you were sleeping,
the newspaper called up for an interview.

450
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,157
访问我?
With me?

451
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:19,952
我参加的那个妇女
俱乐部希望你去做一次演讲
And the women's club I belong to
wants you to give a little talk.

452
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,955
妇女俱乐部
Women's club.

453
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:27,460
噢你还没把东西放好啊
我帮你吧
Oh! Oh, you haven't finished unpacking.
I'll do that for you.

454
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:30,463
-查莉去哪里了?
-她在屋子里团团转像傻了一样
<i>- Where ' s Charlie?
- She's running around like a mad thing.</i>

455
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:32,465
她觉得什麽都需要修理一下
She thinks everything needs fixing.

456
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:37,470
我告诉你
你可不是这里唯一的名人
But what I wanted to tell you was that
you're not the only celebrity in this town.

457
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:40,848
牛顿一家都成为了镇里的
关注焦点你想说什麽?
<i>- We're all going to be in limelight.
- What are you cooking up?</i>

458
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:44,310
今天早\'上来的那个
叫格翰的年轻人...
<i>Well, a young man called this morning,
said his name was Graham,</i>

459
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:47,480
想采访我们家里的
<i>and he wants to interview
everybody in this house.</i>

460
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,732
-采访所有人?
-他是那样说的
<i>- Interview everybody?
- That's what he said.</i>

461
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:54,737
他说是什麽委员会派他来...
He's being sent around the country
by some kind of institute or committee

462
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:58,658
挑选有代表性的
美国家庭来访问
and he has to pick a representative
American family and ask them questions.

463
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:03,120
像是一种调查
国家公众调查
<i>It's a kind of a poll.
It's called the National Public Survey.</i>

464
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,164
为什麽他要选这个家庭呢?
Wonder how he happened
to pick this family?

465
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:07,875
他说要挑选有
代表性的美国家庭
Well, he said he wanted
a typical American family.

466
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,628
我告诉他我们不是的
I told him
we weren't a typical American family.

467
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:13,297
如果他们问我的事情
我就不会回答他们
If he's going to ask a lot of questions,
he can leave me out of it.

468
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:17,134
噢你的事情
我们也说不详细啊
Oh, but you could tell him so much more
than any of us could.

469
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:20,680
-他说还要拍照片
-拍照片
- He's going to take our pictures too.
- Pictures.

470
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,849
噢多麽漂亮啊
My, isn't that lovely?

471
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:25,977
他们两个都是很年轻的
You see, there were really,
there were two young men.

472
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:28,688
一个负责拍照
<i>One of them takes the pictures.</i>

473
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:32,108
-噢还有两个人啊
-是的格翰先生为人好一点
<i>- Oh, there were two.
- Yes. Mr Graham was the nicest.</i>

474
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:34,527
他说我们不必打扮的
Oh, he doesn't want us
to dress up or anything.

475
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:37,113
-他就想我们像往常一样
<i>He just wants us to act
the way we always do.</i>

476
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:39,699
-艾玛女人都是很笨的
-她们总会坏事
Emmy, women are fools.
They'd fall for anything.

477
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:46,873
为什麽你会让
两个陌生人进屋里捣乱?
Why do you let two strangers come
and turn this place upside down.

478
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:50,835
哪个家庭会欢迎
那些窥探者呢?
<i>Why expose the family
to a couple of snoopers?</i>

479
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:55,214
-你应该警觉一点
-查理我只是...
- You should have more sense.
- Why, Charles, I -

480
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:58,092
-早\'安查理叔叔
-早\'安查莉
<i>- Good morning, Uncle Charlie.
- Good morning, Charlie.</i>

481
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:01,554
你妈妈说牛顿家
被一些小毛孩选中了
Your mother says the Newtons have been
picked for all-American suckers.

482
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,848
-你怎麽认为?
-他们来的时候查莉不在
- What do you know about it?
- Charlie wasn't here when they came.

483
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:07,977
但是格翰先生的行为...
一点也不像是窥探
But really, the way Mr Graham told it,
it wasn't like snooping at all.

484
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:11,731
那是公民的责任
是政府的需要
It was our duty as citizens.
It's something the government wants.

485
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:14,734
政府?可能不太准确
但那是为了公众利益
<i>- Government?
- Well, it's for the public good.</i>

486
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:18,654
当我告诉他们你曾去过
哪些地方时他们很感兴趣
<i>I told them about you andtheplaces
you've been and he was very interested.</i>

487
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:20,198
艾玛我与此事是无关的
Now, listen, Emmy.
I'll have nothing to do with this.

488
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:23,534
我只是来探望你们
我建议你请他们吃闭\'门羹吧
I'm just a visitor here and my advice
to you is to slam the door in his face.

489
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:25,995
噢我不能这样做啊
Oh. Well, I-I couldn't do that.

490
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:28,164
如果你不想的话
可以不见他们的
But you don't have to meet him
if you don't want to.

491
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:30,166
我觉得那很有意思啊
Well, I think I'd be kind of exciting.

492
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:32,710
他拿你的照片
也没什麽作用啊
He'd take your photograph
and then we could have it for nothing.

493
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:35,588
不了我这一生都没拍过照
我也不想拍照
No thank you. I've never been
photographed and I don't want to be.

494
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,548
噢查理
你怎麽可以这样说呢?
Oh, Charles, how can you talk that way?

495
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,510
我有你的照片
给查莉保管著
I had a photograph of you.
I gave it to Charlie.

496
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:44,263
-我说过没有啊
-我想你忘记了
I tell you, there are none.
I guess you've forgotten this one.

497
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,766
去拿吧查莉
Get it, Charlie.

498
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,768
你真的记不起来吗?
<i>You sure you don't remember?</i>

499
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:53,314
被人拍下来的我
当然记不起来
<i>Of course I don't
ever remember being photographed.</i>

500
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,110
本翰大街46号
<i>46 Burnham Street.</i>

501
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:01,531
那自行车是你的圣诞礼物
Mm-hm. It was taken
the Christmas you got your bicycle.

502
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:05,117
-那时就在你出意外之前
-查理叔叔你很可爱啊
- Just before your accident.
- Uncle Charlie, you were beautiful.

503
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:09,205
是吧?他那时很文静
喜欢读书
Wasn't he, though?
And such a quiet boy. Always reading.

504
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:13,543
爸爸不应该给你买那自行车的
你不懂怎麽骑
Papa shouldn't have got you that bicycle.
You didn't know how to handle it.

505
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:18,297
他在冰滑的路上骑车
并撞到了电车
He took it right out on the icy road
and skidded into a streetcar.

506
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:21,467
我们以为他不行了
幸好他没事
- We thought he was going to die.
- I'm glad he didn't.

507
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:26,430
那真的很险头骨也裂了
躺了很久
He almost did. He fractured his skull,
and he was laid up so long.

508
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,308
然後他慢慢康复了
And then, when he was getting well,
there was no holding him.

509
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:32,645
之後的事情对他来说
似乎太不足够了...
And it was just as though
all the rest he had was too much for him

510
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:35,648
他开始变得淘气起来
and he had to get into mischief
to blow off steam.

511
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:38,734
那事之後
他再也没怎麽读书了
He didn't do much reading after that,
let me tell you.

512
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:41,487
他在意外养伤的时候
就已经读够了
It was taken the very day
he had his accident.

513
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:46,075
不久之後这张照片拿了回家
妈妈哭得很厉害
A few days later when the pictures
came home, how mama cried.

514
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:50,663
担心他的样子
和为人会不会变了
She wondered if he'd ever look the same.
She wondered if he'd ever be the same.

515
00:38:50,872 --> 00:38:54,125
回顾过去有什麽用?
展望未来又有什麽用?
What's the use of looking backward?
What's the use of looking ahead?

516
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:58,504
今天才是关键
那就是我的哲学今天
Today's the thing.
That's my philosophy. Today.

517
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:01,465
如果这样那你就
应该快点把早\'餐吃完...
If today's the thing,
then you'd better finish your breakfast

518
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:03,593
然後赶快去银行
祖在等你呢
and get down to the bank
because Joe'll be waiting.

519
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:08,306
查莉你不要迟到啊
做调查的人四点就来了
<i>Charlie, don't be late back.
The survey men are coming at 4:00.</i>

520
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:21,360
-你好查莉
-你好梅芝
- Good morning, Charlie.
- Hello, Madge.

521
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:24,030
-你好查莉
-你好卡芙琳
<i>- Good morning, Charlie.
- Hello, Catherine.</i>

522
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,958
看到她们怎麽看你的吗?
一定很想知道你是谁
Did you see the way they looked at you?
I bet they wonder who you are.

523
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:40,296
噢查理叔叔我想和你说话
大家都在看著我
Uncle Charlie, I love to walk with you.
I want everybody to see you.

524
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:02,610
爸爸就在那个窗口
<i>There's Papa in that window over there.</i>

525
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:11,953
祖挪用公款的事
晚些再忙好吗?
Hello, Joe. Can you stop embezzling
a minute and give me your attention?

526
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:13,412
噢...
Oh, uh...

527
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:18,000
查理我们在这里
不开那种玩笑的
Charles, we don't joke
about such things here.

528
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,586
噢那在月底总数的
不足是什麽?
Oh, what's a little shortage in the books
at the end of the month?

529
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:23,464
一个好的银行职员
知道该怎麽做的对吗查莉?
<i>Any good bank clerk can cover up
alittle shortage. Isn't that right, Charlie</i>

530
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:28,511
-大家都听到了
-那就好大家都知道这里是银行
- Everyone can hear you.
- Good. We all know what banks are.

531
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,348
看上去很正常但在内里
就不知道有什麽发生了
<i>Look all right, but noone knows
what goes on when they lock the doors.</i>

532
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:35,226
但骗不了我祖
带我去见你们的经理吧
<i>Can't fool me, though.
Well, Joe, let's see your president.</i>

533
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:37,562
-你还要开个户口吗查理?
-我就为此而来啊
Still want to open that account, Charles?
That's why I'm here.

534
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:42,024
那你在这里先等一下
我去找格林先生
Well, uh, you wait right here.
I'll see if Mr Greene's busy.

535
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:46,404
查理他不喜欢
开那种玩笑的
And, uh, Charles, he doesn't care much
for jokes about banks.

536
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:49,282
我想四万美金对他来说
肯定不是玩笑了吧
Well, $40,000 is no joke.
Not to him, I bet.

537
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:52,952
那是我的一个玩笑
这个世界都在拿我开玩笑
It's a joke to me.
The whole world's a joke to me.

538
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:55,413
我很快回来
I'll be right back.

539
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:05,298
你不应该那样逗我爸爸
You shouldn't tease Papa like that.

540
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:09,468
我不是要逗他
我只是不喜欢这里的气氛
I wasn't teasing him.
I just hate this stuffy atmosphere.

541
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:14,140
他叫我们进去啊
They're waving for us to come in.

542
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:19,812
-你好格林先生
-你好查莉
<i>- Hello, Mr Greene.
- Hello, Charlie.</i>

543
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:23,149
格林先生这位是我内弟
奥克里先生
Well, Mr Greene, this is
my brother-in-law, Mr Oakley.

544
00:41:23,357 --> 00:41:25,151
-你好
-你好奥克里先生
- How do you do?
- How are you, Mr Oakley?

545
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,570
格林先生我打算
在这里逗留一段时间
Well, Mr Greene, I was thinking
of settling down here for a while.

546
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:29,363
-强大的国家
Great country. Great country.

547
00:41:29,572 --> 00:41:31,866
-当然你最近在干什麽?
We think so. What have you been doing?

548
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:34,744
为这里做点贡献
I suppose you might call me a promoter.
I've done a little bit of everything.

549
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:38,539
问题是当我赚到钱
我就对钱没有了兴趣
The only trouble is that once I make
the money, I'm not interested in it.

550
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:40,291
对钱没有了兴趣?
Not interested in money?

551
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,128
外面有很多钱
在等著有人去捡啊
You know there's money just lying around
waiting for somebody to pick it up.

552
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:47,340
我想我应该
把一些零钱存起来
I thought maybe I'd put some of
my loose cash away for safekeeping.

553
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:51,010
很自然我就想到了祖工作的
银行零钱?
<i>- In the bank where Joe works, naturally.
- Loose cash?</i>

554
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:54,972
我有个习惯在旅行的时候
带著大量的现金
Well, I got in a habit of carrying a lot
of cash with me when I was travelling.

555
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:59,185
-是个危险的习惯啊奥克里先生
-我还没丢过一分钱呢格林先生
- A dangerous habit.
- Never lost a penny in my life.

556
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:01,771
我想上天是
保佑那些蠢人和恶棍的
I guess heaven takes care
of fools and scoundrels.

557
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:05,650
-是啊
-三万三万五四万
- Yes.
- Thirty, thirty-five...

558
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:08,694
四万开个户口好吗?
Forty thousand.
Shall we start with forty?

559
00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:12,824
只要填一张资料纸就可以了
奥克里先生细节的问题
<i>- If you'll just write out a deposit slip.
- Ah, details.</i>

560
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:16,577
你遇到我这样注意
细节的人就对了格林先生
I'm glad to see you're a man
who understands details, Mr Greene.

561
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:22,166
那些对我是最重要的
每个细节都很重要
They're most important to me.
Most important. All the little details.

562
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:24,877
噢不好意思
不知道你们在忙
<i>Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were busy.</i>

563
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:29,715
-我们迟点来吧
-进来吧既然已经来了
<i>- We can come back.
- Come in, now that you're here.</i>

564
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:33,135
格林太太这位是我叔叔
奥克里先生
Mrs Greene,
I'd like you to meet my uncle, Mr Oakley.

565
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:35,888
查理叔叔这两位是
格林太太和波特太太
Uncle Charlie,
this is Mrs Greene and Mrs Potter.

566
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:38,349
格林太太波特小姐
Mrs Greene, Miss Potter.

567
00:42:38,558 --> 00:42:40,768
是波特太太
Mrs Potter.

568
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:44,480
-我可不那麽认为
-是吗?
- Something about you made me think -
- Yes?

569
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:48,943
-怎麽了玛格莉?
-我们想购物但现在只有五块钱
- What did you want, Margaret?
- I need some money to go shopping.

570
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:50,945
做寡妇也有一点是好的
There's one good thing
in being a widow, isn't there?

571
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:54,740
就是不用问丈夫要钱花
You don't have to ask
your husband for money.

572
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:57,285
-给你
-噢谢谢
<i>- Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.</i>

573
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:59,537
再见奥克里先生
波特太太
- Goodbye, Mr Oakley.
- Mrs Potter.

574
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:01,789
再见格林太太
Bye, Mrs Greene.

575
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,960
好了格林先生
There. There you are, Mr Greene.

576
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:08,671
-查莉我们去吃午饭吧
-再见奥克里先生
- Charlie, let's see the town.
- Goodbye, Mr Oakley.

577
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,756
-再见格林先生
-有问题随时可以来查询
- Bye, Mr Greene.
- Call on us for advice anytime.

578
00:43:10,965 --> 00:43:13,718
-谢谢
-祖送奥克里先生出门吧
- Thank you.
- Joe, you may see Mr Oakley out.

579
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:18,764
祖只要你醒目点
他的位置迟早\'是你的
Joe, keep your eyes open.
You'll have his job in a couple of years.

580
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:31,068
他回来了
Here he is.

581
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:48,127
那些做调查的人来了
早\'了一个小时啊
Those must be the questionnaire men.
They're a whole hour early.

582
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:50,171
-我不会见他们的
-别担心
I won't see them.

583
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:53,674
你不想的话就不见吧
我明白的
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I'll see that you don't.

584
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:55,718
小心他们对你母亲做什麽
The way they got around your mother.

585
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:58,471
我想她要警惕一点
I thought she'd have better sense.

586
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:04,727
-你好
-你好
<i>- How do you do?
- How do you do?</i>

587
00:44:04,936 --> 00:44:07,855
-你们应该就是来做调查的吧
-我是格翰牛顿太太
- You must have come to interview us.
- My name is Graham, Miss Newton.

588
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:10,149
-你好
-这位是桑德斯
- Oh, how do you do?
- And this is Fred Saunders.

589
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:12,485
你好   请进来
How do you do? Won't you come in?

590
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:14,987
-我去叫妈妈
-谢谢
- I'll call my mother.
- Thank you.

591
00:44:15,196 --> 00:44:18,157
妈妈他们进来了
<i>Mother, the government men are here.</i>

592
00:44:18,366 --> 00:44:20,159
请做
<i>Will you sit down?</i>

593
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:22,537
你们说是四点的
现在还没准备好啊
But you said 4:00. Nothing's ready now.

594
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:24,872
我丈夫还在银行
而这里...
My husband is still at the bank
and-and the house is -

595
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:27,458
我们就是想这样
牛顿太太
That's all we want now, Mrs Newton,
some pictures of the house.

596
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:30,503
桑德斯会在周围拍照
而我就问你问题
Saunders can get busy
and I'd like to ask a few questions.

597
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:35,258
好的但我希望你们
等我把房子收拾好了
Alright, but I do wish you'd waited
until I had the house looking its best.

598
00:44:35,466 --> 00:44:38,469
我想在这里安放鲜花
还有在厨房里挂新的窗窗布
<i>I wanted flowers around
and fresh curtains in the kitchen.</i>

599
00:44:38,678 --> 00:44:41,430
还有很多东西我想你们拍照的
<i>And there are a lot of things
I don't want you to photograph.</i>

600
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:45,893
-你们拥有这房子吗?
-不是房子拥有我们
<i>- You said you own the house?
- Own it? It owns us.</i>

601
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:49,689
有一样东西开始要修理的话
整间房子都要修理了
No sooner do I get one thing fixed
than something else gets broken.

602
00:44:49,897 --> 00:44:52,024
要再刷一下油漆...
And then it needs fresh paint and th-

603
00:44:52,233 --> 00:44:54,026
桑德斯先生
不好意思...
<i>Mr Saunders, I'm very sorry</i>

604
00:44:54,235 --> 00:44:56,279
请不要给这张椅子拍照
<i>but you simply cannot
take a picture with that chair in it.</i>

605
00:44:56,487 --> 00:45:00,074
-要套一个沙发套
-你们家有六个人?
<i>- It needs a new slipcover.
- And there are, uh, six in your family?</i>

606
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:02,702
-是五个
-五个?但是...
- Five.
- Five? But -

607
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,745
我叔叔只是来探望我们的
<i>Well, my uncle ' s just visiting.</i>

608
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:06,789
我说过他的
他是从东部来的
<i>I told you about him.
He's here from the East.</i>

609
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:10,126
我叔叔不希望有什麽麻烦
My uncle doesn't want to be bothered
with a lot of questions.

610
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:12,461
做调查的时候我们要...
Well, you see, on a survey, we usually -

611
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,463
他对调查不感兴趣...
<i>He's not interested
in a survey</i>

612
00:45:14,672 --> 00:45:16,924
我答应过他不会骚扰他的
<i>and I promised him
he wouldn ' t be bothered.</i>

613
00:45:17,133 --> 00:45:18,926
我们希望你们都参与
Well, we'd like it
if we could get all of you.

614
00:45:19,135 --> 00:45:21,304
想了解你们做什麽
和想做些什麽
You know, your opinions,
what you do or what you want to do.

615
00:45:21,512 --> 00:45:24,682
我叔叔的意见很特别的
我想你们不会接受
My uncle's opinions aren't average
and I'm afraid they wouldn't help you.

616
00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:28,227
我想每个人都有自己的思想
<i>I think when someone asks for privacy,
they should have it.</i>

617
00:45:28,436 --> 00:45:31,397
其实我们这次的目的是...
Well, we'll...
The whole idea of this thing is that -

618
00:45:31,606 --> 00:45:34,275
格翰先生我想你们应该
选择另外的家庭
Mr Graham, perhaps
you'd better choose another family.

619
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:38,654
我们也有这样做的
但你们的家庭是...
We'll do anything you say, of course,
but this family seemed right and -

620
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:40,656
是一个很好的家庭
<i>It is a nice family.</i>

621
00:45:40,865 --> 00:45:43,701
查莉你为什麽
不让他问下去呢?
Charlie, let the young men go ahead,
so long as they're here.

622
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:46,162
那好吧
Well, alright.

623
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:49,165
好的桑德斯
去拍些照片吧
OK. Saunders, go ahead
and get another shot.

624
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:53,377
牛顿太太可以告诉
我你丈夫在哪里工作吗?
Mrs Newton, what organisations
do you and your husband belong to?

625
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:55,379
在厨房照一张好吗?
How about a picture in the kitchen?

626
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:58,758
我想不是很适合
Well, I'm afraid the kitchen
isn't quite the way I'd like it.

627
00:45:58,966 --> 00:46:01,010
过来
<i>Come along.</i>

628
00:46:06,516 --> 00:46:08,768
牛顿太太
你要先打鸡蛋吧
If you'll start by breakin' an egg,
Mrs Newton.

629
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:10,686
噢不不应该先打蛋的
Oh, but you don't start a cake
by breaking an egg.

630
00:46:10,895 --> 00:46:12,980
要先把牛油和糖放进去
You have to put
the butter and sugar in first.

631
00:46:13,189 --> 00:46:17,109
有没有调查
我都不会先打蛋的
Survey or no survey,
I'm not going to start by breaking an egg.

632
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:20,988
我要做一个枫叶蛋糕
我弟弟很爱吃的
<i>I thought I'd make a maple cake.
My brother Charles loves maple cake.</i>

633
00:46:21,197 --> 00:46:24,367
-你弟弟做什麽的?
-我想他什麽都做
What does your brother do?
I guess he just does about everything.

634
00:46:24,575 --> 00:46:28,371
-是什麽工作?
-应该是做生意的男人都是那样
What does he do? He's just in business.
You know, the way men are.

635
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:33,125
我丈夫在银行
但我想查理是生意人
My husband works in a bank,
but I think Charles is just in business.

636
00:46:33,334 --> 00:46:36,629
如果你要在
我打蛋的时候拍照
<i>If you really want a picture
of me breaking an egg,</i>

637
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:39,632
那就要等我把
牛油和糖放进去
you'll have to wait
till I cream the butter and sugar.

638
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:41,634
我会等的
I'll wait.

639
00:46:41,843 --> 00:46:43,803
我可以到楼上看看吗?
I wonder if we could
take a look upstairs.

640
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:45,805
请你带我去吧
你妈妈会叫我的好的
You show us, and your mother can call us
when she's ready.

641
00:46:46,013 --> 00:46:48,933
桑德斯先生
- Alright.
- If you'd rather wait, Mr Saunders.

642
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:51,811
加蛋的时间要很及时
Folding in the eggs
has to be done just right.

643
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:53,813
不能让它等得太久
<i>I can ' t beat them and let them stand.</i>

644
00:46:54,021 --> 00:46:56,315
我一听到你打蛋的声音
就马上下来
The minute I hear you've
broken the eggs, I'll come right down.

645
00:46:56,524 --> 00:46:57,525
好的
Yes.

646
00:47:04,365 --> 00:47:07,034
我不知道你想找什麽
I really don't see
what you want to look up here for.

647
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:10,538
那间房是谁的?本来
是我的现在查理叔叔住著
Whose room is that? It's mine.
My uncle's using it now, though.

648
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:14,417
我想知道
里面的布局是怎样的
I'd like to see what your room looks like.
Typical girl, typical room.

649
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:17,128
但我叔叔正在休息
Typical of you to ask.
My uncle's resting.

650
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:19,422
我不想打扰他
I really don't want to disturb him.

651
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:23,968
-那是後楼梯吗?
-没错可以到大厅的
- Is there a back stairs?
- Mm-hm. Right down the hall.

652
00:47:24,177 --> 00:47:26,721
我和你打赌
你叔叔不在里面
I'll bet you 50 cents
that your uncle isn't in there.

653
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:28,723
打赌很无聊的
Oh, betting's silly.

654
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:31,684
你只是想进去拍照
All you want to do
is photograph my room, doesn't he?

655
00:47:31,893 --> 00:47:34,770
我知道叔叔在里面
- That's it.
- Besides, I know my uncle's in there.

656
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:37,482
但我还是认为他在里面
我们进去看看吧
Alright, I'll still bet he isn't.
Let me knock and see.

657
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,193
我先敲门
Oh, I'll knock.

658
00:47:40,401 --> 00:47:42,987
查理叔叔?
Uncle Charlie?

659
00:47:43,196 --> 00:47:45,490
查理叔叔
我们可以进来吗?
Uncle Charlie, may we come in?

660
00:47:51,204 --> 00:47:53,748
-看到了吗?
-你说得对
- See?
- You were right.

661
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:56,667
不错的房间啊
可以拍几张照片吗?
Nice room. Do you mind if I take a picture
since he isn't here?

662
00:47:56,876 --> 00:47:59,712
-我真的不想打扰你叔叔
-我知道
- I don't want to disturb your uncle.
- Oh, I suppose so.

663
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:03,508
但我想不到
谁会对我的房间感兴趣
But I really can't imagine
anyone being interested in my room.

664
00:48:03,716 --> 00:48:08,471
我喜欢现在的颜色
我喜欢全部是白色
It's not the way I'd like it.
I'd like to have it yellow and white.

665
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:10,473
他想享受宁静啊
Might as well let him work in peace.

666
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:14,268
我想和他说几句
Besides, I'd like to talk to you.

667
00:48:14,477 --> 00:48:18,314
你说我们是普通家庭
但我觉得很有意思
Your picking us as an average family
gave me a funny feeling.

668
00:48:18,523 --> 00:48:22,360
-什麽有意思?
-我不知道
- What kind of a funny feeling?
- Oh, I don't know.

669
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:25,279
我想是我不想
做一个普通女孩吧
I guess I don't like to be and average girl
in an average family.

670
00:48:25,488 --> 00:48:27,406
普通家庭才是好的
看看我
Average families are the best.
Look at me.

671
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:29,909
-我也是来自普通家庭的
-和我们一样普通?
<i>- I'm from an average family.
- As average as ours?</i>

672
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:32,286
当然是了
但我还不确定你们很普通
Sure.
Besides, I don't think you're average.

673
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:36,791
那是因为你们现在来这里
而不是前几天
Oh, that's because you see me now
instead of a few days ago.

674
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:42,255
我那时很灰暗
查理叔叔来了就改变了
I was in the dumps. Then Uncle Charlie
came and everything changed.

675
00:48:42,463 --> 00:48:45,341
但你妈妈说他昨晚才到的
可能你...
But your mother said he came last night.
Maybe you just think -

676
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:48,261
我知道的
I don't think. I know.

677
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:53,641
很有趣每次我想东西的时候
总会想到查理叔叔
Funny, but when I think about how I feel,
I always come back to Uncle Charlie.

678
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,854
而你不想让我
觉得他很不简单吗?
Are you trying to tell me
I shouldn't think he's so wonderful?

679
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,608
-噢我只是...
-桑德斯先生?
<i>- Oh, no. I -
- Mr Saunders?</i>

680
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:06,445
我准备好打蛋了希望
桑德斯先生不会搞得很乱
<i>- I'm ready with the eggs.
- Mr Saunders mustn't move anything.</i>

681
00:49:06,654 --> 00:49:10,283
-我叔叔是很整洁和挑剔的
-桑德斯先生也是的
<i>- My uncle's awfully neat and fussy.
- Saunders is neat and fussy, too.</i>

682
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:18,583
-这是你提起的叔叔吗?
-是的
<i>- Is this your uncle?
- Yes, it is.</i>

683
00:49:22,879 --> 00:49:25,256
现在来一张走廊的
Now, for one of the hall.

684
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:29,677
桑德斯先生在
我房间拍了几张照片
<i>Mr Saunders has been
taking pictures of my room.</i>

685
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:34,056
我姐姐提醒你们
那些鸡蛋和蛋糕
My sister told me to remind you
about eggs and a cake.

686
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:37,310
我不想被拍照
我要拿回那底片
I don't like to be photographed.
I'll have to ask you for the film.

687
00:49:37,518 --> 00:49:40,646
-噢查理叔叔
-请给我
- Oh, Uncle Charlie.
- Give it to me, please.

688
00:49:40,855 --> 00:49:43,316
给他吧桑德斯
Give it to him, Fred.

689
00:49:43,524 --> 00:49:47,737
真可惜牛顿太太
的照片也在里面
That's too bad. There's a picture
of Mrs Newton on this film.

690
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:58,498
不好意思桑德斯先生
我准备好加蛋了
<i>- Excuse me.
- The eggs are ready.</i>

691
00:49:58,706 --> 00:50:01,417
我不能再让它等著了
<i>I can't let them stand another minute.</i>

692
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,006
-那是最後一卷胶卷了
-噢
That was my last roll of film.

693
00:50:07,215 --> 00:50:09,509
桑德斯先生
给查理叔叔拍照...
Mr Saunders took
Uncle Charlie's picture by mistake

694
00:50:09,717 --> 00:50:12,386
查理叔叔把胶卷拿了
and Uncle Charlie made him
give him back the roll.

695
00:50:12,553 --> 00:50:15,223
他不是在开玩笑的
He wasn't joking
about not wanting to be photographed.

696
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:17,183
我们都不想
有什麽家庭纠纷
We didn't want to start a family feud.

697
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:19,185
我们明天再来
看你做蛋糕吧
I'll get you
making the cake again tomorrow.

698
00:50:19,393 --> 00:50:21,729
我明天不会做蛋糕了
I won't be
making a cake again tomorrow.

699
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:25,399
我要做一些
很重要的事情
I want to help an important work,
but I cannot go on making cakes.

700
00:50:25,608 --> 00:50:28,444
你已经帮我们了
牛顿太太
You have helped, Mrs Newton.

701
00:50:28,653 --> 00:50:30,446
我还想问一下
And now I'd like to ask another favour.

702
00:50:30,655 --> 00:50:33,866
今天晚上可以约你的女儿
出去吗?我想四处看看
Could I borrow your daughter?
I'd like to look around the town.

703
00:50:34,075 --> 00:50:36,869
-安妮?
-是查莉
- Ann?
- Charlie.

704
00:50:37,078 --> 00:50:41,040
安妮会好些
她什麽都知道
Ann would be better.
Ann knows everything about everybody.

705
00:50:41,249 --> 00:50:45,002
-查莉
-如果查莉不介意的话
- Charlie.
- Well, if, uh, Charlie doesn't mind.

706
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:47,713
-我不介意
-太好了
- I don't mind.
- Swell.

707
00:50:54,554 --> 00:50:55,847
-再见牛顿太太
-再见
- Goodbye, then, Mrs Newton.
- Goodbye.

708
00:50:56,055 --> 00:50:58,349
-六点半好吗?
-六点半
- 6:30?
- 6:30.

709
00:50:58,558 --> 00:50:59,559
-好的再见
-再见
- OK. Goodbye.
- Bye.

710
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:01,435
-再见桑德斯先生
再见
- Bye, Mr Saunders.
- Bye.

711
00:51:01,644 --> 00:51:03,312
再见
Goodbye.

712
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:06,983
看来他是一个
不错的年轻人啊
He seems like a nice young man.

713
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:09,944
你不是要和
卡芙琳去看电影吗?
But I thought you were
going to the movies with Catherine.

714
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:12,989
我会告诉她我有点不舒服
Oh, I'll tell her
I don't feel well or something.

715
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,091
-你好啊查莉
-你们好啊卡芙琳雪莉
- Hello, Charlie.
- Well... hello, Catherine. Hello, Shirley.

716
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,554
-你们好
-这位是格翰他刚来这里
- Hello.
- This is Jack Graham. He's in town.

717
00:51:36,762 --> 00:51:38,556
-你好
-你好
- How do you do?
- Hello.

718
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:43,186
-你的喉咙好点了吗查莉?
-好很多了谢谢
- How's your throat, Charlie?
- Oh, much better. Thank you.

719
00:51:43,394 --> 00:51:45,438
比尔在问你的事呢
Bill Forest was asking about you.

720
00:51:45,646 --> 00:51:48,065
噢比尔?
Oh. Bill Forest?

721
00:51:48,274 --> 00:51:50,359
再见了
Well, uh... goodbye.

722
00:51:50,568 --> 00:51:52,612
-再见
-再见
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

723
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:03,206
我知道你其实是什麽人
I know what you are, really.

724
00:52:03,414 --> 00:52:06,918
你是侦探
You're a detective. There's something
the matter and you're a detective.

725
00:52:07,126 --> 00:52:09,545
-有些事情是侦探会做的
-听我说查莉
- Charlie, listen.
- I don't want to listen.

726
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:11,214
我不想听你们根本
就不是来做调查
Why, you're not on a survey at all.

727
00:52:11,422 --> 00:52:13,216
你对我们说谎
你们骗了我妈妈
You lied to us. You lied to Mother.

728
00:52:13,424 --> 00:52:16,552
你们只是想进我们家里
You just wanted to get in our house.
Police.

729
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:18,513
就是那样
That's what it is.

730
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:21,891
你们为什麽要骗我们?
What do you want with us?
Why are you here, lying to us?

731
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:24,060
查莉你要听我说
你一定要相信我
Look, Charlie, you've got to listen to me.
You've got to trust me.

732
00:52:24,268 --> 00:52:26,062
你说谎也要相信你吗?
When you've done nothing but lie?

733
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,940
我知道你并不是
想和我约会
And you probably didn't want to
take me out at all the way I thought.

734
00:52:29,148 --> 00:52:31,108
你只是想问我很多问题
You just wanted to ask me
a lot of questions.

735
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:34,111
我有那样做吗有吗?
Have I asked you a lot of questions?
Have I?

736
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,657
好了我的确是侦探
还做得很糟糕
Alright, I'm a detective.
A pretty bad one.

737
00:52:37,865 --> 00:52:39,659
你听我说几句好吗?
Now, won't you even listen to me?

738
00:52:39,867 --> 00:52:42,119
-为什麽你要骗我?
-我必须那样做
- Why should I when you lied to me?
- I had to.

739
00:52:42,328 --> 00:52:44,997
我来这里的目的
是为了一个男人不是你
When I came here to find a man,
I hadn't counted on you.

740
00:52:45,164 --> 00:52:48,960
-不是你妈妈和你家人
-一个男人?什麽男人?
- I hadn't counted on your family.
- Find a man? What man?

741
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:51,629
我们在追踪一个在逃的人
There's a man loose in this country.
We're after him.

742
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:55,132
我们知道的很少
连他的样子都不知道
We don't know much.
We don't even know what he looks like.

743
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:59,303
查莉你对你叔叔了解有多少?
Charlie, think. How much
do you know about your uncle?

744
00:52:59,512 --> 00:53:03,599
他是我妈妈的弟弟
他有什麽问题?
Why, he's my mother's brother.
What's he got to do with it?

745
00:53:03,808 --> 00:53:05,768
我们要找的人
可能是你叔叔
This man we want may be your uncle.

746
00:53:05,977 --> 00:53:09,605
噢我不相信
别再烦著我
Oh, I don't believe you.
Go away and leave me alone.

747
00:53:09,814 --> 00:53:13,234
我们追踪的那个男人
很可能就是你叔叔
We're after one man.
Your uncle may be that man.

748
00:53:13,442 --> 00:53:16,821
但在东部还有
另一个男人在被追捕
But in the East, there's another man
who's being hunted too,

749
00:53:17,029 --> 00:53:19,407
从麻省到缅因
他可能就是那个人
through Massachusetts and into Maine.
He may be the one.

750
00:53:19,615 --> 00:53:21,826
我叔叔没做什麽
My uncle hasn't done anything.

751
00:53:22,034 --> 00:53:24,745
他知道那会对我妈妈不好
He knows it would kill
my mother if he did.

752
00:53:24,954 --> 00:53:28,624
他是我妈妈的弟弟
就像罗杰和我一样
He's her younger brother,
just like Roger is mine.

753
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,710
他们为什麽不把
在东部那人捉了?
Why don't they arrest
that man in the East?

754
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:34,130
你们为什麽还要烦我们?
<i>Why don't you go away
and leave us alone?</i>

755
00:53:34,338 --> 00:53:37,300
查莉我们晚餐时
谈起各自的亲人...
Charlie, when we were eating tonight
and talking about our folks

756
00:53:37,508 --> 00:53:40,928
就像平常人一样
and what we'd done and how we felt,
we were like two ordinary people.

757
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:43,055
我们都在同样环境中成长
We'd been brought up about the same.

758
00:53:43,264 --> 00:53:47,143
-我们彼此都有好感
-噢现在已不重要了
<i>- You liked me and I liked you.
- Oh, it doesn't matter now.</i>

759
00:53:47,351 --> 00:53:50,480
什麽不重要这点才重要
What do you mean, "It doesn't matter"?
It's the only thing that does.

760
00:53:50,688 --> 00:53:52,899
如果不是你的叔叔...
<i>If it weren't for you,
you don't think I ' d care</i>

761
00:53:53,107 --> 00:53:55,026
我早\'就把他逮捕了
知道吗?
<i>how or where I caught up
with your uncle, do you?</i>

762
00:53:55,234 --> 00:53:59,447
因为如果他真的是我们要的人
我们就要捉住他
Because if he's the guy, I'm going to
catch up with him. Remember that.

763
00:53:59,655 --> 00:54:01,824
你必须保守秘密
<i>And you're going to keep
your mouth shut.</i>

764
00:54:02,033 --> 00:54:04,702
因为你是个很好的女孩
如果你知道了...
<i>You're going to keep your mouth shut
because you're such a nice girl</i>

765
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:08,581
你就会帮你叔叔
you'd help if you knew
your uncle was the man we wanted.

766
00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:11,542
-我不会帮你们的
-我知道你会的
<i>- I wouldn't help you.
- And I know you would.</i>

767
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:14,045
让我再给你一个好些的条件
And I'm trying to make it easier for you.

768
00:54:14,253 --> 00:54:17,256
如果你叔叔真的是那个人
我们会平静地把他从这里带走
If your uncle's the man we want,
we'll get him out of town quietly.

769
00:54:17,465 --> 00:54:20,218
-我们不会在这里逮捕他
-在这?在妈妈面前逮捕他?
<i>- We won't arrest him here.
- Arrest him here? With mother -</i>

770
00:54:20,426 --> 00:54:23,262
我想对你说我们不会的
<i>I'm trying to tell you we won ' t.</i>

771
00:54:25,097 --> 00:54:29,185
-求你了查莉
-我什麽也不会说的
- Please, Charlie.
- I won't say anything.

772
00:54:29,393 --> 00:54:31,771
噢送我回家吧!
Oh, take me home!

773
00:54:45,618 --> 00:54:47,453
晚安查莉
Good night, Charlie.

774
00:54:47,662 --> 00:54:50,665
你们发现做错了
就一定很有趣
It's going to be funny
when you find out you're wrong.

775
00:54:50,873 --> 00:54:53,209
晚安
Good night.

776
00:55:25,408 --> 00:55:27,368
-你好啊查莉回来了吗?
-是的爸爸
<i>- Hello, Charlie. Home already?
- Oh, yes, Dad.</i>

777
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:30,621
外面空气很好
我想出去呼吸一下
It's so nice out, I thought
I'd get some air before I went to bed.

778
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:34,125
你最好快点回来
查理叔叔找你
You better run in. Your Uncle Charlie's
been asking about you.

779
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:36,294
我会在後门上去的
I think I'll just go up the back way.

780
00:55:36,502 --> 00:55:38,296
我很累不是很想说话
I- I'm tired and I don't feel like talking.

781
00:55:38,504 --> 00:55:40,882
好的换衣服吧
Alright. Suit yourself.

782
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,842
小心照顾自己啊
- Take care of yourself.
- Mm-hm.

783
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,886
-晚安贺博
-晚安查莉
- Good night, Herb.
- Good night, Charlie.

784
00:55:45,094 --> 00:55:46,679
晚安查莉
Good night, Charlie.

785
00:55:46,888 --> 00:55:49,724
我们在说什麽贺博?
What were we saying, Herb?
Did I notice what?

786
00:55:49,932 --> 00:55:51,684
觉得有点什麽不妥吗...
Well, did you taste anything funny

787
00:55:51,893 --> 00:55:53,978
你今晚在我家喝的咖啡?
about that coffee you had
at my house this evening?

788
00:55:54,187 --> 00:55:56,230
没有啊
No. It tasted all right.

789
00:55:56,439 --> 00:55:58,483
这就对了
那里面有点不同
That's what I mean. It wasn't all right.

790
00:55:58,691 --> 00:56:01,360
-放了什麽?
-一点苏打水
- Put something in it?
- Put a little soda.

791
00:56:01,569 --> 00:56:04,989
如果我放毒药的话
也是这份量
About the same amount that I'd have used
if I'd wanted to use poison.

792
00:56:05,198 --> 00:56:07,617
你不说我还不察觉呢
Well, you don't say?
I never tasted a thing.

793
00:56:07,825 --> 00:56:10,745
当然我连苏打
也察觉不到
Of course, I might not notice the soda.

794
00:56:10,953 --> 00:56:14,582
更别提无色无味的毒药
You'd notice the soda more
than you would the poison.

795
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,876
如果是的话
你现在早\'死了
For all you knew, you might
just as well be dead now.

796
00:56:47,448 --> 00:56:50,159
-安妮还没睡吗?
-是啊
- Aren't you asleep yet, Ann?
- Uh-uh.

797
00:57:02,088 --> 00:57:04,298
查莉你在干嘛?
Charlotte, what are you doing?

798
00:57:04,507 --> 00:57:07,301
噢我在找我看过的新闻
Oh, I'm just looking for a recipe
I thought I saw,

799
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:10,012
但这已经给撕破了--
but it's just so torn up.

800
00:57:10,221 --> 00:57:13,307
图书馆里什麽报纸都有
They have papers in the "libarry",
new ones and old ones.

801
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:15,268
柯克然小姐会帮你找的
Miss Corcoran will get them out for you.

802
00:57:15,476 --> 00:57:18,980
就算你剪下来一点
她都不会发现的
She won't even notice
if you cut out a little, bitty recipe.

803
00:57:19,188 --> 00:57:21,440
那也不是什麽重要的东西
Oh, it's not that important.

804
00:57:22,692 --> 00:57:24,068
图书馆几时关门?
What time does the library close?

805
00:57:24,277 --> 00:57:29,407
如果你平时多去的话
就会知道是9点
If you read as much as you should,
you'd know it closes at 9:00.

806
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:34,787
这样啊那我明天才去吧
Oh, well.
If I think about it, maybe I'll go tomorrow.

807
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:37,498
你该睡了
You really ought to go to sleep, Ann.

808
00:58:22,752 --> 00:58:25,630
回去!回去!回去!
Get back there!
Get back! Get back!

809
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:39,519
查莉等一下
知道我为什麽在这吗?
Just a moment, Charlie.
What do you think I am out here for?

810
00:58:39,727 --> 00:58:41,646
对不起诺顿警官
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Norton.

811
00:58:41,854 --> 00:58:43,898
没事了走吧
Alright. Go ahead.

812
00:59:24,522 --> 00:59:27,191
噢柯克然小姐
请让我进去!
Oh! Miss Corcoran, please let me in.

813
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:29,402
求求你!
Oh, please!

814
00:59:32,071 --> 00:59:33,781
太谢谢你了
Oh, thank you.

815
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,909
查莉你真是的
明知道这里9点关门
Really, Charlie. You know as well as I do
the library closes at 9:00.

816
00:59:37,118 --> 00:59:39,036
如果我这次给你例外
以後还得了
If I make one exception,
I'll have to make a thousand.

817
00:59:39,245 --> 00:59:42,915
对不起柯克然小姐
我要找出那报纸
I'm sorry, Mrs Corcoran, but there is something
in the paper I've got to see.

818
00:59:43,124 --> 00:59:45,459
太令我惊讶了
你都不为别人著想
I'm surprised at you, Charlie.
No consideration.

819
00:59:45,668 --> 00:59:48,337
-我只需要一分钟
-你一大早\'又不来
- Oh, I'll only be a minute.
- You've got all day to come here.

820
00:59:48,546 --> 00:59:51,090
真不知道你为啥
夜晚赶来这里
I don't know why you want
to rush in here tonight like a madwoman.

821
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:53,843
我只给你三分钟
I'll give you just three minutes.

822
01:00:10,193 --> 01:00:13,738
老天保佑不要是坏消息
Can't be anything really awful.

823
01:00:13,946 --> 01:00:16,616
我会证明他不是的
I'll prove to him it isn't.

824
01:00:17,992 --> 01:00:20,077
第三版--
Page three -

825
01:01:57,258 --> 01:01:58,885
你好
Hello.

826
01:01:59,093 --> 01:02:03,431
-查莉在哪?
-她还在睡我不想吵醒她
- Where's Charlie?
- Still asleep. I don't want to wake her.

827
01:02:13,566 --> 01:02:15,943
-查莉还在睡吗?
-不她刚醒来
- Charlie still asleep?
- No, she just woke up.

828
01:02:16,152 --> 01:02:19,864
我不该让她睡那麽久
但她好像很累
I shouldn't have let her sleep so long,
but she needed it.

829
01:02:20,072 --> 01:02:23,659
她有点不舒服
她会下来吃饭的
She doesn't look quite herself.
She'll be down for dinner.

830
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:47,058
妈妈让我来捣碎这些
Mother, let me finish mashing those.

831
01:02:47,266 --> 01:02:50,144
我来弄晚餐吧
I'll fix the rest of dinner
and get it on the table.

832
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:51,604
你去跟查理叔叔聊吧
You go talk to Uncle Charlie.

833
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:53,564
-你觉得怎麽样?
-我没事
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

834
01:02:53,773 --> 01:02:56,192
我累极了
睡得死死的
I must have been tired. I slept like a log.

835
01:02:56,484 --> 01:02:59,654
查理叔叔找你很多次了
他很喜欢你
Uncle Charlie was asking for you again.
He's fond of you.

836
01:02:59,862 --> 01:03:05,451
那年轻人也来过两次
我说你睡了
That nice young man came to ask
after you. I told him you were asleep.

837
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:10,581
我又恢复精神了
这肉汁弄好了吗?
<i>I'm rested now. Is the gravy made?</i>

838
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:16,504
你又在哼那华尔兹曲了
Now you're humming that waltz.
Please don't hum that tune anymore.

839
01:03:16,712 --> 01:03:19,632
我好不容易才忘了它
I've just got it out of my head
and don't want it started again.

840
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:22,343
不要再哼了
Please remember, don't hum that tune.

841
01:03:22,552 --> 01:03:24,804
不要每次都站起来
And don't keep getting up
every few minutes.

842
01:03:25,012 --> 01:03:26,556
只要像个淑女那样
静静坐著
You just sit there and be a real lady.

843
01:03:26,764 --> 01:03:31,018
那好吧
至少我能把汤端出去
Alright, if you say so,
but at least I can carry in the soup.

844
01:03:31,227 --> 01:03:36,899
罗杰快洗手!
祖查理吃饭了
Roger, wash your hands!
Joe. Charles. Dinner.

845
01:03:38,526 --> 01:03:43,447
妈妈安妮我说过
不要把东西挂在耳後
- Mama -
- Ann, don't put things behind your ear.

846
01:03:43,656 --> 01:03:46,742
别低声说谁都知道
你在说坏话
And don't whisper.
Anyone could hear you a block away.

847
01:03:46,951 --> 01:03:48,494
我能跟你坐吗?
May I sit by you at the table?

848
01:03:48,703 --> 01:03:51,706
跟我?我还以为
你想跟查理叔叔坐呢
<i>By me? I should think
you'd want to sit by Uncle Charlie.</i>

849
01:03:51,914 --> 01:03:55,126
-不我想跟你坐
-为什麽想换?
<i>- No, I want to sit by you.
- Why do you want to change?</i>

850
01:03:55,334 --> 01:03:57,128
妈妈就让她换吧
Mother, let her change if she wants to.

851
01:03:57,336 --> 01:03:59,380
罗杰说不介意
Roger doesn't mind.

852
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:03,551
他当然不介意
但查理叔叔会不能
No, certainly not.
Uncle Charlie might think... Certainly not.

853
01:04:03,759 --> 01:04:08,347
-妈妈让她换吧
-好吧安妮总是有怪念头
- Mother, let her change.
- OK, but Ann has some foolish ideas.

854
01:04:08,556 --> 01:04:12,185
你们都去饭厅吧
Go in the dining room, both of you.

855
01:04:19,525 --> 01:04:22,487
什麽事了?
安妮不跟我坐了吗?
What's going on here?
Have I lost my little girl?

856
01:04:22,695 --> 01:04:25,031
罗杰想跟你坐
<i>Roger wanted to sit next to you,</i>

857
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:28,242
我想让孩子们换换座位
and I thought it would be nice
if the children took turns.

858
01:04:28,451 --> 01:04:30,077
-我才不想--
-不想什麽罗杰?
- I never...
- Never what, Roger?

859
01:04:30,286 --> 01:04:34,582
没事安妮快来帮我
- Nothing.
- Come, Ann. Come and help me.

860
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:39,879
祖!   我不该把报纸
带到饭桌上没特别的新闻
Joe! I brought it in by mistake.
Nothing special in it.

861
01:04:40,087 --> 01:04:43,382
-查理想看一下吗?
-谢谢祖
- Want to look at the headlines, Charles?
- Thank you, Joe.

862
01:04:45,426 --> 01:04:48,137
罗杰喝汤不要发出声音
<i>Roger, don't make so much noise
with your soup.</i>

863
01:04:48,346 --> 01:04:52,767
如果他能像马一样
把嘴唇贴近点就好了
<i>If he holds his lips together, he
could draw it carefully, like a horse.</i>

864
01:04:52,975 --> 01:04:55,770
-别那麽恶心
-我能把面包沾进去吗?
<i>- Don't be disgusting.
- May I dip my bread in it?</i>

865
01:04:55,978 --> 01:04:58,856
-查莉呢?
-她在准备晚餐
<i>- Where's Charlie?
- She wanted to serve dinner.</i>

866
01:04:59,065 --> 01:05:02,693
-她很快就来
-说得对祖
<i>- She ' II be in in a minute.
- You're right, Joe.</i>

867
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:06,030
没什麽特别新闻
她来了!
Nothing special tonight. Oh, here she is!

868
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:09,075
-我可爱的外甥女来了
-我想知道你睡了多久
<i>- Here ' s my girl.
- How many hours did you sleep?</i>

869
01:05:09,283 --> 01:05:12,036
只要你告诉我什麽时候睡
If you could tell me
the exact minute you went to sleep,

870
01:05:12,245 --> 01:05:15,456
你什麽时候醒
如果你中途有醒来...
the exact minute you woke up,
if you woke up in between

871
01:05:15,665 --> 01:05:18,459
那你醒了多久
and how long you stayed awake
each time you woke up,

872
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:20,419
然後我就能准确告诉你
then I could tell you exactly -

873
01:05:20,628 --> 01:05:24,257
你今晚准睡不著
没人能睡一整天的
You won't sleep tonight.
Nobody who sleeps all day can.

874
01:05:24,465 --> 01:05:27,301
我昨晚做梦
I slept all right, and I kept dreaming,

875
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:31,222
关于你的噩梦
查理叔叔
perfect nightmares
about you, Uncle Charlie.

876
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:32,557
关于我的噩梦?
Nightmares about me?

877
01:05:32,765 --> 01:05:38,479
你在火车上
想躲避某些东西...
You were on a train,
running away from something

878
01:05:38,688 --> 01:05:42,191
我很高兴看到你在火车上
and when I saw you on the train,
I felt terribly happy.

879
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,611
看到查理叔叔在
火车上又怎会高兴呢?
<i>How could you feel happy
seeing Uncle Charlie on a train?</i>

880
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:49,365
我才不要他离开呢
我要他留在这
I don't want to see him on a train.
I hope he stays here forever.

881
01:05:49,574 --> 01:05:54,620
他始终要走
我们要面对现实
Well, he has to leave sometime.
We have to face the facts.

882
01:05:54,829 --> 01:05:57,373
我欣赏面对现实的人
I like people who face facts.

883
01:05:57,582 --> 01:06:00,960
我们也不一定
要遇到那些事
Well, we're not going
to face any such facts as those.

884
01:06:02,503 --> 01:06:05,339
安妮你要看笑话吗?
Oh, Ann,
would you like to see the funnies?

885
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:09,802
我长大了
一个星期还看两本书
I'm too old for funnies. I read two books
a week. I took a sacred oath I would.

886
01:06:10,011 --> 01:06:13,598
而且在饭桌上
阅读是不礼貌的
Besides, no one's allowed to read
at the table. It isn't polite.

887
01:06:13,806 --> 01:06:15,433
不要顶撞长辈!
Don't correct your elders!

888
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:17,685
不关她事艾玛
是我忘了
She's right, Emmy.
I'm forgetting my manners.

889
01:06:17,894 --> 01:06:20,771
祖我不是说你带报纸来
Joe, I'm going to blame this paper on you.

890
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:26,110
罗杰去冰箱
找那红瓶子的酒来
Roger, go to the icebox and bring me
a big, red bottle you'll find there.

891
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,447
现在能把报纸扔走
爸爸读过你也读过
You can throw the paper away.
Dad's read it, you've read it.

892
01:06:29,655 --> 01:06:32,200
今晚我们
也不玩什麽游戏了
We don't need to play any
games with it tonight.

893
01:06:32,408 --> 01:06:34,869
安妮帮查莉
把水果拿出来
<i>Ann, you can help
Charlie carry the vegetables.</i>

894
01:06:35,077 --> 01:06:37,872
我准备晚餐
时就看到那瓶酒
<i>I saw that bottle
when I was getting dinner.</i>

895
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:42,043
圣.波罗说过「
为了胃部著想而喝点酒」
St Paul said, "Take a little wine
for thy stomach's sake. "

896
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:44,128
餐酒...
听起来多暧昧!
Wine for dinner sounds so gay!

897
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:48,966
记得老琼斯的大女儿
结婚时的酒吗?
Remember they had the champagne
when the oldest Jones girl got married?

898
01:06:49,175 --> 01:06:50,510
那是正宗
法国勃艮第红酒啊
This is sparkling burgundy.

899
01:06:50,718 --> 01:06:55,223
只要一口
我就知道是勃艮第红酒
One sip and I'll be calling it
"sparkling burgledy. "

900
01:06:55,431 --> 01:06:57,558
我还是不要喝了
<i>Maybe I'd better not take any.</i>

901
01:06:57,767 --> 01:07:00,102
噢...进口的
Oh... imported.

902
01:07:00,311 --> 01:07:02,814
法国进口和那些斜纹?
Imported Frankie and his tweeds?

903
01:07:03,022 --> 01:07:05,066
他把斜纹刻在拐杖上
And his loaded cane.

904
01:07:05,274 --> 01:07:07,360
他把什麽都刻上去!
His loaded everything!

905
01:07:12,657 --> 01:07:17,161
罗杰拿四苹杯子出来
<i>Roger, go get four
of the small glasses with stems.</i>

906
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:22,959
我答应俱乐部的格林太太
你给女士们演讲
<i>Charles, I promised Mrs Greene of our
club that you'd talk to the ladies.</i>

907
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:27,755
我讲什麽好呢?
一般都是时事和见闻
What am I going to talk about?
Travel or current events?

908
01:07:27,964 --> 01:07:30,091
不要讲时事
我们听得多了
<i>Oh, not current events.
We get current events.</i>

909
01:07:30,299 --> 01:07:32,343
什麽类型的观众?
<i>Who'll my audience be?</i>

910
01:07:32,552 --> 01:07:35,805
像我一样的家庭主妇
Oh, women like myself.
Busy with our homes, most of us.

911
01:07:36,013 --> 01:07:38,224
这城镇的女士们都很忙
<i>Women keep busy in towns like this.</i>

912
01:07:38,432 --> 01:07:43,646
在大城市就不同
中年的寡妇
In the cities it's different.
Middle-aged widows, husbands dead,

913
01:07:43,855 --> 01:07:48,776
她们死去的丈夫
穷尽一生积累财富
<i>husbands who ' ve spent their lives
making fortunes, working and working,</i>

914
01:07:48,985 --> 01:07:53,197
留下一大笔钱给
愚蠢的妻子
<i>and then they die and leave their money
to their wives, their silly wives.</i>

915
01:07:53,406 --> 01:07:56,993
这些没用的妻子们怎麽做?
And what do the wives do,
these useless women?

916
01:07:57,201 --> 01:08:01,747
她们出入
最豪华奢侈的酒店
You see them in the best hotels
every day by the thousands,

917
01:08:01,956 --> 01:08:04,250
吃喝玩乐
挥霍度日
drinking the money, eating the money,

918
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:07,503
花钱如流水
losing the money at bridge,
playing all day and all night,

919
01:08:07,712 --> 01:08:09,672
浑身都是铜臭味
smelling of money.

920
01:08:09,881 --> 01:08:13,467
唯一值得引以为荣的
是她们的珠宝
Proud of their jewellery,
but of nothing else.

921
01:08:13,676 --> 01:08:18,306
讨厌衰老肥胖
贪心的女人
Horrible, faded, fat, greedy women.

922
01:08:18,514 --> 01:08:21,851
但她们是人啊!
活生生的人啊!
<i>But they're alive! They're human beings.</i>

923
01:08:22,059 --> 01:08:25,104
是吗?是吗查莉?
Are they? Are they, Charlie?

924
01:08:25,313 --> 01:08:29,525
她们不像贪得
无厌的动物吗?怎麽样?
<i>Are they human,
or are they fat, wheezing animals? Hm?</i>

925
01:08:29,734 --> 01:08:34,030
动物变老
肥得不能动了又怎麽样?
And what happens to animals when
they get too fat and too old?

926
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:36,782
我好像在这就演讲了
Well, I seem to be making
my speech right here.

927
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:42,747
不要在俱乐部说这些!
你会被赶下台的
Don't talk about women like that
in front of my club! You'll be lynched.

928
01:08:42,955 --> 01:08:47,960
波特太太也去
她跟我提起你
That nice Mrs Potter's going to be there.
She was asking me about you.

929
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:53,216
格林把她带去俱乐部
演讲後我帮你介绍
The Greenes are bringing her here to
the party I'm having for you afterwards.

930
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:55,468
祖贺博来了
<i>Joe, it's Herbert.</i>

931
01:08:55,676 --> 01:08:58,262
他总是在我们吃饭时来
He always comes when we're eating.

932
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:03,351
晚安牛顿太太
<i>Good evening, Mrs Newton.</i>

933
01:09:03,559 --> 01:09:05,978
-晚安奥克里先生
-晚安
- Good evening, Mr Oakley.
- Good evening.

934
01:09:06,187 --> 01:09:08,856
贺博你妈妈还好吗?
<i>Well, Herb, how's your mother?</i>

935
01:09:09,023 --> 01:09:11,067
噢一般吧
Oh, she's just middling.

936
01:09:12,193 --> 01:09:15,988
-吃饭了吗?
-一小时前吃过了
- Had your dinner?
- Oh, I had mine an hour ago.

937
01:09:16,197 --> 01:09:20,785
你们果然新潮
这麽晚才吃饭啊
You folks are getting pretty stylish.
Having dinner later every evening.

938
01:09:20,993 --> 01:09:22,870
哈哈!
<i>Ha ha!</i>

939
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:29,502
-祖
-怎麽啦?
<i>- Joe.
- Huh?</i>

940
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:35,299
-祖我摘了些蘑菇
-你没告诉我
- Joe, I-I picked some mushrooms.
- You don't say?

941
01:09:35,508 --> 01:09:38,177
蘑菇令你想起什麽吗?
Mushrooms mean anything to you, Joe?

942
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:43,558
我在外面吃的肉排
还不如这个美味呢
I eat 'em on my steak when I'm out
and the meat's not good enough as it is.

943
01:09:43,766 --> 01:09:45,893
我送你些蘑菇
你会吃吗?
If I brought you some mushrooms,
would you eat 'em?

944
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:47,895
可能会吧
为什麽这样说?
Suppose I would. Why?

945
01:09:48,104 --> 01:09:53,109
对了我最多只会
被判一般杀人罪
Then I've got it. The worst I'd be
accused of would be manslaughter.

946
01:09:53,317 --> 01:09:57,029
造成意外死亡
乾净利落
Doubt if I'd get that.
Accidental death, pure and simple.

947
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:01,617
一篮子的蘑菇里...
只有两三个有毒
A basket of good mushrooms and...
two or three poisonous ones.

948
01:10:01,826 --> 01:10:06,622
不无知的陪审团
只会注意有毒的
No, no. Innocent party might
get the poisonous ones.

949
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:09,208
我在刮胡子时想到一方法
I thought of something better
when I was shaving.

950
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:14,505
浴盆把你倒挂著
而你的腿放在外面
这有人做过了但兵不厌诈
A bath tub. Pull the legs out
from under you, hold you down.

951
01:10:17,383 --> 01:10:19,302
你们怎麽了?
<i>Oh, what's the matter with you two?</i>

952
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:21,971
非得整天都说著杀人吗?
Do you always have to
talk about killing people?

953
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,140
我们不是说杀其他人
We're not talking about killing people.

954
01:10:24,348 --> 01:10:27,310
贺博想杀我
而我想杀他
Herb's talking about killing me,
and I'm talking about killing him.

955
01:10:27,518 --> 01:10:29,437
这是你爸爸的娱乐方式
It's your father's way of relaxing.

956
01:10:29,645 --> 01:10:31,731
他就不能用其他方式吗?
Can't he find some other way to relax?

957
01:10:31,939 --> 01:10:36,569
除了研究毒药
就不能有点安宁吗?
Can't we have a little peace and quiet
without dragging in poisons all the time?

958
01:10:36,777 --> 01:10:39,739
查莉!她在胡说八道
<i>Charlie!
She doesn ' t make sense talking like that.</i>

959
01:10:39,947 --> 01:10:42,241
真令人担心罗杰
找她回来
<i>I'm worried about her.
Roger, bring her back.</i>

960
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:46,537
我跟著她
你们继续吃
I'll go. You stay and finish dinner.
I'll catch up with her.

961
01:10:46,746 --> 01:10:49,290
她怎麽了?
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

962
01:11:01,177 --> 01:11:05,264
-对不起诺顿警官
-你总是在街上乱跑
- Excuse me, Mr Norton.
- You're always running around at night.

963
01:11:05,473 --> 01:11:09,227
-你昨晚匆匆忙忙去哪?
-只是有点事做
- Where were you hurrying to last night?
- Just doing an errand.

964
01:11:09,435 --> 01:11:12,688
-这位是你的叔叔吗?
-是的
- Is this your uncle I've heard about?
- Yes.

965
01:11:12,897 --> 01:11:16,150
-诺顿警官这是查理叔叔
-很高兴认识你你叫?
- Uncle Charlie, Mr Norton.
- Glad to know you. What's the name?

966
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:18,611
查理.奥克里
很高兴认识你
Oakley. Charles Oakley. Nice to meet you.

967
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:23,157
管好你的外甥女
下次我可要给她开罚单
Better keep your eye on your niece.
I'll have to give her a ticket for speeding.

968
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:26,619
在马路上横冲直撞
是违法的知道吗?
- City ordinance about running.
- Hear that, Charlie?

969
01:11:26,828 --> 01:11:29,330
不要知法犯法
我会看好她的了
Don't want to break the law.
I'll take care of her.

970
01:11:29,539 --> 01:11:31,833
晚安
- Good night.
- Good night.

971
01:11:32,041 --> 01:11:35,253
查莉怎麽了?
发生什麽事了?
What's the matter, Charlie?
What's wrong?

972
01:11:44,887 --> 01:11:47,473
-我要跟你谈谈
-你又弄痛我了
- I want to talk to you.
- You're hurting my arm again.

973
01:11:47,682 --> 01:11:50,643
-跟我来
-不我没来过这些地方
- Come in here with me.
- I can't. I don't go to places like this.

974
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:52,895
来
Go on in.

975
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,995
-带我来这干嘛?
-在哪里又有什麽关系呢?
- Why'd you bring me here?
- What does it matter where we are?

976
01:12:09,203 --> 01:12:10,997
-你好查莉
-你好
Hello, Charlie. Hello.

977
01:12:11,205 --> 01:12:15,209
路易斯你好查理叔叔
这是路易斯.菲治你好
Hello, Louise.
Uncle Charlie, Louise Finch.

978
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:19,922
-这是我的叔叔
-我是查莉的同学
- This is my uncle.
- I was in Charlie's class in school.

979
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:24,218
没想过你会来这里
I sure was surprised to see you come in.
I never thought I'd see you here.

980
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:28,347
我来这里有两周了
I been here two weeks.
Lost my job over at Kern's.

981
01:12:28,556 --> 01:12:32,435
我在全镇一半的酒吧干过
要点什麽?
I've been in half the restaurants in town.
What'll you have, Charlie?

982
01:12:32,643 --> 01:12:37,857
不了给她一杯
姜汁我要白兰地
- Nothing, thank you.
- A ginger ale for her, a brandy for me.

983
01:12:38,065 --> 01:12:41,527
-查莉怎麽了
-怎麽了?
- Well, Charlie?
- Well?

984
01:12:41,736 --> 01:12:45,698
你知道很多吗?
那家伙告诉你些东西
Think you know something, don't you?
That young fellow told you something.

985
01:12:45,907 --> 01:12:48,659
杰克?凭什麽说
他知道你的事?
Jack?
Why should he know anything about you?

986
01:12:50,286 --> 01:12:56,042
-查莉我不想
我们之间有什麽误会
Charlie, something's come between us.
I don't want that to happen.

987
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:59,003
因为我们是老朋友啊
而且...
Why, we're old friends.

988
01:13:00,087 --> 01:13:04,217
我们就像双胞胎
More than that. We're like twins.

989
01:13:04,425 --> 01:13:07,678
-是你自己说
-查理叔叔别碰我
- You said so yourself.
- Don't touch me, Uncle Charlie.

990
01:13:10,389 --> 01:13:12,183
他跟你说了什麽?
What did that boy tell you?

991
01:13:12,391 --> 01:13:18,856
他没说什麽
我也想他不知道你的事
He's got nothing to do with it. I hope
he never knows anything about you.

992
01:13:19,065 --> 01:13:24,070
查莉
你真是细心可爱的女孩
Charlie,
you're a pretty understanding sort of girl.

993
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:29,742
如果你听到
关于我的传闻
If you've heard
some little things about me,

994
01:13:29,909 --> 01:13:34,580
我想你肯定
不会把它当真
I guess you're a woman of the world
enough to overlook them.

995
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:41,462
人人都看出
你是家里的支柱
You're the head of your family, Charlie.
Anyone can see that.

996
01:13:41,671 --> 01:13:47,218
我老了我十六岁
就开始到处漂泊
I'm not so old. I've been chasing
around the globe since I was sixteen.

997
01:13:49,262 --> 01:13:51,639
我做了些蠢事
<i>I guess I've done
some pretty foolish things,</i>

998
01:13:51,848 --> 01:13:54,350
犯了愚蠢的错误
made some pretty foolish mistakes.

999
01:13:54,559 --> 01:13:58,271
没什麽大不了
只是...可笑的错误
<i>Nothing serious, just... foolish.</i>

1000
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:18,958
查莉别妄自猜测
Oh, Charlie, now,
don't start imagining things.

1001
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:24,338
你怎麽能做出这种事?
你是我的叔叔
How could you do such things?
You're my uncle,

1002
01:14:24,547 --> 01:14:26,257
我妈的弟弟
<i>my mother's brother.</i>

1003
01:14:26,465 --> 01:14:30,178
我们都认为
你是很成功的人
We thought you were
the most wonderful man in the world.

1004
01:14:30,386 --> 01:14:33,973
-世界上最成功的人
-查莉你知道什麽?
- The most wonderful and the best.
- Charlie, what do you know?

1005
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:45,610
让你们久等了
我们真的很忙
I'm sorry I was so long.
We're awful busy.

1006
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:51,157
这是谁的?
不是很漂亮吗?
Whose is it? Ain't it beautiful?

1007
01:14:53,534 --> 01:14:56,204
我一直都想
拥有这样的戒指
I'd just die for a ring like that.

1008
01:14:56,454 --> 01:15:00,291
这戒指简直让我目眩
Yes sir, for a ring like that,
I'd just about die.

1009
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,753
我最爱珠宝--真的珠宝
I love jewellery, real jewellery.

1010
01:15:03,961 --> 01:15:08,508
我根本不用就能辩出真假
Notice I didn't even have to ask
if it was real. You can tell.

1011
01:15:08,716 --> 01:15:11,469
-我知道
-我要多一杯白兰地
- I can.
- Bring me another brandy.

1012
01:15:13,304 --> 01:15:15,431
坐下
Sit down.

1013
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,683
坐下!
Sit down!

1014
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:24,607
你认为自己知道多少?
You think you know something,
don't you?

1015
01:15:24,816 --> 01:15:27,819
你以为你很聪明
You think you're the clever little girl
who knows something.

1016
01:15:28,027 --> 01:15:31,823
但你不知道的还多著呢
There's so much you don't know.
So much.

1017
01:15:32,031 --> 01:15:33,699
你知道什麽?
What do you know, really?

1018
01:15:33,908 --> 01:15:37,829
你只不过是个普通的女孩
You're just an ordinary little girl
living in an ordinary little town.

1019
01:15:38,037 --> 01:15:42,166
每天从床上醒来
无　无虑
You wake up every day and know there's
nothing in the world to trouble you.

1020
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:45,044
平平淡淡地过日子...
You go through your ordinary little day.

1021
01:15:45,211 --> 01:15:51,050
晚上睡在安稳的床
做些无聊的梦
At night, you sleep your ordinary sleep
filled with peaceful, stupid dreams.

1022
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:55,012
是我给你带来噩梦
And I brought you nightmares.

1023
01:15:56,639 --> 01:16:00,101
对吗?还是一个谎言?
Or did I?
Or was it a silly, inexpert, little lie?

1024
01:16:00,309 --> 01:16:03,604
你生活在梦境里
看不到现实
You live in a dream.
You're a sleepwalker, blind.

1025
01:16:03,813 --> 01:16:06,274
你知道外面的世界是怎样吗?
How do you know
what the world is like?

1026
01:16:06,482 --> 01:16:09,360
你能想像那就像
猪圈般肮脏吗?
Do you know the world is a foul sty?

1027
01:16:09,569 --> 01:16:13,990
你知道周围是带著
面具的卑贱小人吗?
<i>Do you know if you ripped
the fronts off houses, you'd find swine?</i>

1028
01:16:14,198 --> 01:16:16,534
这个该死的世界
有谁在乎发生什麽?
The world's a hell.
What does it matter what happens in it?

1029
01:16:16,742 --> 01:16:20,288
醒醒吧查莉
你的聪明去哪了?
<i>Wake up, Charlie.
Use your wits. Learn something!</i>

1030
01:16:20,496 --> 01:16:22,373
查莉你走了吗?
You goin', Charlie?

1031
01:16:42,477 --> 01:16:45,396
-查莉你会帮我吗?
-帮你?
- Charlie, will you help me?
- Help you?

1032
01:16:45,605 --> 01:16:50,943
我们身上淌著一样的血
一周前我几乎绝望
The same blood flows through our veins.
I was at the end of my rope.

1033
01:16:52,445 --> 01:16:56,741
我太累了我受够了
Oh, I'm so tired. There's an end
to the running a man can do.

1034
01:16:56,949 --> 01:17:00,786
你没法想像那种累
我准备--
You'll never know what it's like
to be so tired. I was going to...

1035
01:17:03,164 --> 01:17:08,961
嗯...我想离开这里
帮帮我查莉
Then I got the idea of coming out here.
It's my last chance, Charlie.

1036
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:11,714
给我一次机会
Give it to me.

1037
01:17:12,798 --> 01:17:14,717
格翰和那个家伙不知道
Graham and the other fellow,
they don't know.

1038
01:17:14,926 --> 01:17:18,930
如果抓到东部的那个
嫌疑犯我就--
There's a man in the east they suspect,
and if they get him, I'll...

1039
01:17:19,138 --> 01:17:22,600
查莉给我一次机会
Charlie, give me this last chance.

1040
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:25,228
好吧那你走!
Take your chance. Go!

1041
01:17:25,436 --> 01:17:28,189
我会走的查莉
给我几天时间
I'll go, Charlie. Just give me a few days.

1042
01:17:28,397 --> 01:17:30,900
为你妈妈著想
她知道後会疯的
Think of your mother.
It'll kill your mother.

1043
01:17:31,108 --> 01:17:34,362
我知道她会受不了的
Yes, it would kill my mother.

1044
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:37,824
那你几天後要离开这里
Take your few days.
See that you get away from here.

1045
01:17:38,032 --> 01:17:41,160
你知道如果
我被抓了後果是什麽?
You realise what it'll mean
if they get me?

1046
01:17:41,369 --> 01:17:43,329
坐电椅
The electric chair.

1047
01:17:43,538 --> 01:17:47,041
查莉全靠你了
你要帮我啊
Charlie, you've got to help me.

1048
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:52,421
你说我们不仅是叔叔
与外甥女关系
You said yourself we're no ordinary uncle
and niece, no matter what I've done.

1049
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:55,842
你先进去我跟著来
You go in. I'll be in in a minute.

1050
01:18:10,565 --> 01:18:13,276
-家是最好的地方
-查莉呢?
<i>- Home, sweet home.
- Where's Charlie?</i>

1051
01:18:13,484 --> 01:18:16,362
-她在外面别担心
-她怎麽了?
<i>- She's outside. Don't worry about her.
- What was the matter?</i>

1052
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:20,950
她有点烦躁
我让她去散散心
<i>She was a little edgy. I persuaded her
to go for a walk. She's calmer now.</i>

1053
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:26,414
-那就好给你留了甜品
-冰淇淋苏打
<i>- I'm so glad. I've saved dessert for you.
- We had an ice-cream soda.</i>

1054
01:18:26,622 --> 01:18:31,627
噢!你快点上床吧!
Oops-a-daisy! Off to bed you go!

1055
01:18:54,901 --> 01:18:57,570
-罗杰过来!
-不!
<i>- Roger, come here!
- No!</i>

1056
01:19:02,241 --> 01:19:05,870
我来对付她
嘘!安妮!
There's my girl. Psst! Ann!

1057
01:19:06,078 --> 01:19:09,123
你好!
你一定是藏著什麽
Hello!
You must be trying to hide or something.

1058
01:19:09,332 --> 01:19:13,377
-我没有
-只有藏著东西的人才会说嘘
- We're not hiding.
- People who are hiding say "psst".

1059
01:19:13,586 --> 01:19:16,172
-我不想在星期天吵闹
-听著安妮
- We just don't want to yell on Sunday.
- Look, Ann.

1060
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:21,010
叫你姐姐来一下
小声点我们在这等
Ask your sister to run over here.
Just ask her quietly. We'll wait here.

1061
01:19:21,219 --> 01:19:24,722
-我爸爸跟你爸爸有过节吗?
-我爸爸?
- Did my father have a feud with yours?
- My father?

1062
01:19:24,931 --> 01:19:28,893
不然你不会
瞒著别人叫她来
Because if they didn't, there's no sense
in my asking Charlotte quietly.

1063
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:32,563
妈妈不介意的
她说女人就该生儿育女
Mama won't care. She thinks
girls ought to marry and settle down.

1064
01:19:32,772 --> 01:19:35,233
-我读过一本书--
-叫她来吧别卖弄文才了
- In a book I'm reading -
- Just ask her, Ann. Don't be literary.

1065
01:19:35,441 --> 01:19:38,277
-好吧
-记住由我来说
- Alright.
- Remember, I'm doing all the talking.

1066
01:19:45,326 --> 01:19:46,953
-你好
-你好你好凯瑟琳
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

1067
01:19:47,161 --> 01:19:49,497
早\'上好格翰警官
Good morning, Mr Graham.

1068
01:19:49,705 --> 01:19:52,667
凯瑟琳
这是桑德斯警官
Catherine, this is Mr Saunders.

1069
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,211
-你好
-你好
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1070
01:19:55,419 --> 01:19:58,798
-安妮说你有事找我
-桑德斯有事跟你说
- Ann says you want to speak to me.
- Saunders wants to.

1071
01:19:59,006 --> 01:20:02,468
来安妮，跟凯瑟琳说说吧
Come on, Ann.
Tell Catherine the story of Dracula.

1072
01:20:02,677 --> 01:20:04,720
来吧，凯瑟琳
Come on, Catherine.

1073
01:20:06,556 --> 01:20:10,768
-你想怎样?
-让他们走远点再说
- What do you want?
- Let them get a little bit ahead.

1074
01:20:16,315 --> 01:20:20,444
我想说关于
你叔叔的照片的事
It's about that photograph we took,
the one of your uncle.

1075
01:20:20,653 --> 01:20:23,990
-你给回他了他也许烧掉
-不是那张
- He probably burned it.
- Not that one, he hasn't.

1076
01:20:24,198 --> 01:20:26,409
我们给了张错误的相片
We gave him the wrong film.

1077
01:20:26,617 --> 01:20:28,828
我们拿真正的照片
跟东部那边联系
We got the picture alright.
We wired it East.

1078
01:20:29,036 --> 01:20:31,956
那里的证人能认出
谁是我们通缉的罪犯
They've got witnesses can identify
the man we want from that picture.

1079
01:20:32,165 --> 01:20:34,542
-什麽能认出是他?
-对了
- What do you mean, identify him?
- Just what I said.

1080
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:37,920
当证人看到照片
就能知道他是否罪犯
When the witnesses see that picture,
we'll know whether Oakley's the man.

1081
01:20:38,129 --> 01:20:41,132
-我们准备跟那边联系
-那查理叔叔会--
- We're waiting for the wire now.
- And then Uncle Charlie will be -

1082
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,635
对了就是这样
That's right. That's the way it is.

1083
01:20:47,305 --> 01:20:52,268
格翰想你可以让他离开
这会好点--
Graham thought you could get your uncle
to leave town now. It would be better -

1084
01:20:52,477 --> 01:20:55,771
我会的一定会!
你能给多长时间?
I've got to, haven't I? I've got to!
What's the most time you'll give me?

1085
01:20:56,397 --> 01:20:59,901
两小时内
我会叫他离开的!
- Two hours.
- I'll make him leave!

1086
01:21:00,109 --> 01:21:02,820
你为什麽肯定
他是我们要找的人?
You seem pretty sure
he's the man we want. Why?

1087
01:21:03,029 --> 01:21:07,492
-没有原因我只是害怕
-你是唯一能肯定的人
No reason why. I'm just scared.
You're the ones who seem sure.

1088
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:12,288
-我不能让这里有事
-你知道他干过什麽?
- I couldn't bear anything happening here.
- You know what he's done?

1089
01:21:12,497 --> 01:21:14,957
-不我不想听!
-希望你知道
- No, I don't want to hear!
- Well, I want you to get this.

1090
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:20,421
我们想帮你
把知道的都告诉我们吧!
We're doing you a favour. If you know
anything more about your uncle, tell us.

1091
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:22,924
我们还想知道
他什麽时候离开
We also want to know
when and how he leaves town.

1092
01:21:23,132 --> 01:21:24,675
-如果你瞒著我们--
-不我会告诉你的
- If you hold out on us -
- I won't. I'll tell you.

1093
01:21:27,595 --> 01:21:30,556
走多一步
你会弄伤妈妈的背
Step on a crack,
you'll break your mother's back.

1094
01:21:30,765 --> 01:21:33,309
我们都想相信你
I wish I knew we could trust you.

1095
01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:36,562
我保证不会再帮他了
I won't do anything to help him,
I promise.

1096
01:21:36,771 --> 01:21:39,816
但你不能让
我去暗中监视他
But you can't ask me to spy on him.

1097
01:21:40,024 --> 01:21:43,653
我们来个交易
我叫他离开
We've made a bargain.
I'll get him to leave. That's all I'll do.

1098
01:21:43,861 --> 01:21:46,531
查莉他是危险人物
一旦离开我们视线范围--
Think, Charlie. The man's dangerous.
If he gets away from us -

1099
01:21:46,739 --> 01:21:51,786
我不想知道他做什麽
我会遵守诺言
I don't want to hear what he'll do.
We've made a bargain. I'll keep it.

1100
01:21:51,994 --> 01:21:54,497
他走的时候
我会通知你
I'll let you know when he leaves.

1101
01:21:54,705 --> 01:21:59,669
万一他不是通缉犯
那有好看的
Funny if he turned out
to be the wrong man. Could be.

1102
01:21:59,877 --> 01:22:03,714
-安妮
-我把妈妈的背弄伤了三次
<i>- Ann!
- I broke my mother's back three times.</i>

1103
01:22:03,923 --> 01:22:08,010
你还没说罗斯小姐
是否嫁给了有钱人...
Not bad. You didn't finish telling me
whether Miss Rose married the rich guy,

1104
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:11,139
-或者她的新欢
-你跟她那麽熟啊?
- or the one she was in love with.
- How long have you two such friends?

1105
01:22:11,347 --> 01:22:14,892
我们在玩游戏
我问她答
Oh, we play games. I ask questions.
She knows all the answers.

1106
01:22:15,184 --> 01:22:18,020
麻烦的是
我弄不懂她在胡扯什麽
<i>The only trouble is
I can't make out what she's making up.</i>

1107
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:21,524
我不会胡扯，说的都是书本上的知识
I never make up anything.
I get everything from my books.

1108
01:22:21,732 --> 01:22:23,234
我说的都是事实
They're all true.

1109
01:22:23,442 --> 01:22:27,363
安妮来吧
我们去帮忙做饭吧再见
Come on, Ann. We'd better get home
and help with dinner. Goodbye.

1110
01:22:27,572 --> 01:22:31,033
再见再见
格翰警官桑德斯警官
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Graham. Mr Saunders.

1111
01:22:31,242 --> 01:22:33,286
-再见凯瑟琳
-再见
<i>- Goodbye, Catherine.
- Come on, Catherine.</i>

1112
01:22:33,494 --> 01:22:37,874
为啥不去摘些花
点缀一下晚餐?越简单越好
- Why not pick flowers for the table?
- Simple flowers are the best.

1113
01:22:38,082 --> 01:22:41,460
-不用是紫罗兰的
-要是我在南方出生就好了
<i>- I didn't ask for orchids.
- I wish I'd been born in the South.</i>

1114
01:22:41,669 --> 01:22:44,964
南方的女人很有魅力
她们戴著手套摘花
<i>Southern women have a lot of charm.
They pick flowers with gloves on.</i>

1115
01:22:45,173 --> 01:22:47,675
-再见凯瑟琳
-再见查莉晚饭後见
- Goodbye, Catherine.
- Goodbye, Charlie. See you after dinner.

1116
01:22:47,884 --> 01:22:49,552
再见
Bye.

1117
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:52,763
-安妮你好
-你好
<i>- Hello, Ann.
- Hello.</i>

1118
01:22:52,972 --> 01:22:57,768
教堂怎麽样?
够座位吗?有人要让座吗?
How was church, Charlie? Did you
count the house? Turn anybody away?

1119
01:22:57,977 --> 01:23:00,271
不够了
No, room enough for everyone.

1120
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,482
很好
I'm glad to hear that.

1121
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:06,903
演出一段时间了
观众会陆续减少
Show's been running such a long time,
I thought attendance might be falling off.

1122
01:23:07,111 --> 01:23:09,655
电台有什麽新闻吗?
<i>Anything special on the noon broadcast?</i>

1123
01:23:09,864 --> 01:23:14,118
说抓到了另一个
嫌疑犯--玛丽寡妇杀手
They caught that other fellow,
the Merry Widow Murderer.

1124
01:23:14,327 --> 01:23:17,497
-真的吗?哪里?
-缅因州的波特兰
<i>- They did, did they? Where?
- State of Maine. Portland.</i>

1125
01:23:17,705 --> 01:23:21,042
不算真正的抓到
他逃避警方的追捕
Didn't catch him exactly.
He was running away from the police,

1126
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:25,671
跑进了飞机场
躲到飞机的推进器後
and they cornered him at the airport
and he ran into the propeller of a plane.

1127
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,715
-噢!
-他被切得肢离破碎
- Oh, boy!
- Cut him all to pieces.

1128
01:23:27,924 --> 01:23:30,176
只能从衣服辩认
Had to identify him by his clothes.

1129
01:23:30,384 --> 01:23:34,305
他的衣服印著「C」「O」
省略号「H」
His shirts were all initialled,
"C," "O," apostrophe "H."

1130
01:23:34,514 --> 01:23:36,974
很快就能划上句号的了
Well, makes a good ending.
Couldn't have done better myself.

1131
01:23:37,183 --> 01:23:39,393
这案子很快就结束的
I guess that closes that case pretty final.

1132
01:23:39,602 --> 01:23:42,814
当然不用太担心那案子
<i>Sure does.
Never cared much for that case.</i>

1133
01:23:43,022 --> 01:23:48,569
我今天可要饱餐一顿啦
Well, I think I'll go get ready for dinner.
I'm hungry. I can eat a good dinner today.

1134
01:24:46,919 --> 01:24:51,048
查莉有好消息通知你
哪里能聊几句?
Charlie, I have great news for you.
Where can we talk alone?

1135
01:25:02,143 --> 01:25:07,482
缅因州通知结束案子
你也能解脱了
We got a wire from Maine. We can call
off the job. I'll bet you're relieved. I am.

1136
01:25:07,648 --> 01:25:09,400
噢解脱了
Oh, I am relieved.

1137
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:13,154
还游说你叔叔离开这
他肯定说你疯了
<i>You were trying to get youruncle out.
He must have thought you were crazy.</i>

1138
01:25:13,362 --> 01:25:16,449
一切都结束了
我不想再提了
Now that it's over, I don't
want to talk about it any more.

1139
01:25:16,657 --> 01:25:19,243
我希望假装
这一切没发生过
I'd like to pretend the whole
dreadful thing never happened.

1140
01:25:19,452 --> 01:25:23,581
-你不需要假装啊
-妈妈的手套
<i>- There's nothing to pretend about.
- There's mother's gloves.</i>

1141
01:25:23,789 --> 01:25:26,709
她总是丢三落四的
Mother and her gloves.
She's always losing things.

1142
01:25:26,918 --> 01:25:30,171
迟早\'她连你也会失去的
<i>All mothers lose things.
Someday, she'll be losing you.</i>

1143
01:25:30,379 --> 01:25:34,050
她才没有损失呢
还多了一个女婿
Mothers don't lose daughters,
they gain sons.

1144
01:25:34,258 --> 01:25:37,595
也是但事情
总不那麽如意譬如我吧
Yes, but gain isn't always the word.
Now, take me.

1145
01:25:37,804 --> 01:25:40,223
谁想要个侦探做女婿?
Who'd want a detective
for a son-in-law?

1146
01:25:40,431 --> 01:25:42,558
-我爸爸会
-他会?
- My father would.
- He would?

1147
01:25:42,767 --> 01:25:48,022
如果你说要嫁给侦探
他会怎麽反应?
If you told him you were going to marry
a detective, he wouldn't disown you?

1148
01:25:48,231 --> 01:25:50,107
不一定是我啊
可以是安妮
It wouldn't have to be me. There's Ann.

1149
01:25:50,316 --> 01:25:54,487
不她跟我说要
嫁给图书管理员
No, Ann wants to marry a librarian.
She told me.

1150
01:25:54,695 --> 01:25:58,449
所以她经常读那麽多书
So she'll always have
plenty of books around to read.

1151
01:26:00,409 --> 01:26:02,286
什麽事了?
What's the matter?

1152
01:26:02,495 --> 01:26:06,082
我好久没这麽开怀地笑了
I was laughing.
It's been so long since I laughed.

1153
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:07,959
我喜欢你笑的样子
I like it when you laugh.

1154
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:13,381
我喜欢你做的每件事
I like it when you don't.
I guess I like you whatever you do.

1155
01:26:13,589 --> 01:26:18,010
-我喜欢你
-我也喜欢你
- I guess I like you.
- I'm glad. I like you too.

1156
01:26:18,219 --> 01:26:23,391
有趣的是你遇见一个人
然後...爱上她
Funny how you happen to meet someone
and like them and... like them.

1157
01:26:23,599 --> 01:26:25,434
嗯
Mm-hm.

1158
01:26:25,643 --> 01:26:27,395
-查莉?
-什麽事?
- Charlie?
- Yes?

1159
01:26:27,603 --> 01:26:32,150
我想有天你会
跟你爸爸说--
I suppose it couldn't ever really happen
some day that you'd tell your father...

1160
01:26:32,358 --> 01:26:36,070
要嫁给一个侦探
You know, about marrying someone,
a detective, I mean.

1161
01:26:36,279 --> 01:26:39,490
-我不知道
-我也不想现在告诉你
- I don't know.
- I didn't mean to tell you.

1162
01:26:39,699 --> 01:26:42,952
我想等你把这一切
不愉快的事忘记
I wanted to wait until you'd forgotten
the mess we've been through together,

1163
01:26:43,161 --> 01:26:46,122
直到你想起
我不再有恐惧和不安
till you didn't think of me as part
of something unpleasant and frightening.

1164
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:50,793
我希望能回来告诉你
I wanted to wait and come back
and then tell you.

1165
01:26:51,002 --> 01:26:53,254
但我想现在就跟你说
But I can't help it.
I want to tell you now.

1166
01:26:53,462 --> 01:26:57,008
查莉我爱你
I love you, Charlie. I love you terribly.

1167
01:26:57,216 --> 01:27:01,345
你介意我现在才说吗?
I know it's no time to tell you now
and I'm sorry. Do you mind?

1168
01:27:01,554 --> 01:27:04,348
-我不介意
-你会考虑一下吗?
- I don't mind.
- Do you think you could think about it?

1169
01:27:04,557 --> 01:27:08,769
-关于你爱我?
-也许你也爱我
- About your loving me?
- And perhaps your loving me?

1170
01:27:10,521 --> 01:27:15,651
我希望保持朋友关系
我们是朋友
I- I'd like us to be friends. I know that.
We are friends.

1171
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:19,405
-我想保持现状
-没有其他吗?
- I'd like to have that to think about.
- Nothing more?

1172
01:27:19,614 --> 01:27:23,826
我不知道杰克
我...还不知道
I don't know, Jack.
I... just don't know yet.

1173
01:27:24,035 --> 01:27:27,121
好吧
但我能回来看你吗?
Alright. But I may come back?

1174
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:31,876
噢当然能一定要回啊
Oh, please come back.
Please come back.

1175
01:27:32,919 --> 01:27:34,712
听著查莉
Listen, Charlie.

1176
01:27:34,921 --> 01:27:37,507
我去到市中心的广场
When I go, go back to that square
in the middle of town.

1177
01:27:37,715 --> 01:27:41,344
那是我们初次认识的地方
Take a good look at it.
That's where I first knew I loved you.

1178
01:27:41,552 --> 01:27:45,431
真是不打不相识
That's where we had the fight
and I didn't know what to do.

1179
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:48,559
我热爱我的工作
只是那晚不喜欢
I like my job,
but I didn't like it that night.

1180
01:27:48,768 --> 01:27:50,728
那晚我讨厌它
I hated it that night.

1181
01:27:50,937 --> 01:27:54,023
-你现在讨厌它吗?
-不
- You hate it now?
- No, not now.

1182
01:27:55,817 --> 01:28:00,530
这像口井
我要弄个装饰品上去
You know, this is a swell place.
I'm going to put a bronze plaque up.

1183
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:05,868
这门老是自己锁上!
That door's always banging shut!

1184
01:28:06,077 --> 01:28:08,746
噢!大力点!
Oh! It sticks.

1185
01:28:09,789 --> 01:28:11,457
啊!
Uh!

1186
01:28:21,801 --> 01:28:24,679
你们把自己锁在车房干嘛?
What are you two locking yourselves
in the garage for?

1187
01:28:24,887 --> 01:28:27,056
-我年轻的时候是在会议室
-奥克里先生
- When I was young, it was the parlour.
- Hello, Mr Oakley.

1188
01:28:27,265 --> 01:28:29,600
-我在跟查莉说再见
-在车房里?
- I was saying goodbye to Charlie.
- In the garage?

1189
01:28:29,809 --> 01:28:32,979
门被锁上了
现在我也要跟你说再见了
The door got stuck.
Now I'll have to say goodbye to you.

1190
01:28:33,187 --> 01:28:37,275
我们在草坪上道别好了
不用回到车房
Let's say goodbye out here on the lawn.
No use taking a chance on the garage.

1191
01:28:37,483 --> 01:28:40,444
-完了吗?
-完了我会再回来的
- Finished here?
- All finished, but I'll be back.

1192
01:28:40,653 --> 01:28:43,030
-很快就见到我的
-噢?
<i>- You ' II be seeing me around.
- Oh?</i>

1193
01:28:43,239 --> 01:28:45,491
不是因为公事
<i>Not on business, though.</i>

1194
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:49,704
我明白
查莉是一个好女孩
I can understand you coming back.
Charlie's a fine girl.

1195
01:28:49,912 --> 01:28:52,331
她是我见过最好的女孩
She's the thing I love most in the world.

1196
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:55,793
说真的格翰警官
一帆风顺
I mean it. Have a nice trip, Mr Graham.

1197
01:28:56,002 --> 01:28:59,088
下次不要乱拍照了
And don't take any more photographs
without permission.

1198
01:28:59,297 --> 01:29:01,591
你知道这是人权啊?
Rights of man. You know, freedom?

1199
01:29:01,799 --> 01:29:05,511
我们下次再讨论这个吧
We'll have a talk
about freedom some day, Mr Oakley.

1200
01:29:11,017 --> 01:29:12,768
-再会
-再会
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1201
01:29:15,021 --> 01:29:20,026
-记得给我写信
你有我地址吧-嗯
Don't forget to write.
Remember, you have the addresses.

1202
01:29:27,033 --> 01:29:29,076
杰克!
Jack!

1203
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:07,824
还有吗?牛油水果
蔬菜还要去图书馆
Anything else? I've got butter, fruit,
green thread and go to the library.

1204
01:30:08,032 --> 01:30:12,286
买些新鲜的
如果还有我会叫安妮去
And whatever vegetable looks freshest.
If I've forgotten anything, I'll send Ann.

1205
01:30:12,495 --> 01:30:14,288
好的
Alright.

1206
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:21,212
妈妈!
Mother!

1207
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:24,173
查莉!亲爱的!
你没事吧?
Charlie! Darling! Are you hurt?

1208
01:30:24,924 --> 01:30:26,592
我绊倒了
I tripped.

1209
01:30:26,801 --> 01:30:29,345
在哪里?弄伤了膝盖吗?
Oh, what is it? Is it your ankle?

1210
01:30:29,554 --> 01:30:32,473
没什麽事
我扶住了栏杆
I don't think I'm hurt.
I grabbed the banister.

1211
01:30:32,682 --> 01:30:34,183
噢你差点没命了!
You might have been killed!

1212
01:30:35,434 --> 01:30:39,564
每次孩子们走这楼梯
我都很担心
<i>I worry myself sick every time
one of you comes down these stairs.</i>

1213
01:30:39,772 --> 01:30:42,608
太陡峭和有点摇摆
要去修理一下
<i>They're too steep and rickety.
They ought to be fixed.</i>

1214
01:30:42,817 --> 01:30:44,986
你真的没事?
<i>Are you sure you're all right?</i>

1215
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:27,904
查理叔叔
你什麽时候走?
When are you leaving, Uncle Charlie?

1216
01:31:28,112 --> 01:31:32,241
查莉一切都结束了
我想忘记它
Oh, come now. That other business,
it's all over. I'd like to forget it.

1217
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:35,119
-我们现在很开心啊
-你什麽时候走?
- We're all happy here.
- When are you leaving?

1218
01:31:35,328 --> 01:31:37,371
我不会走的
I'm not going, you see.

1219
01:31:38,498 --> 01:31:40,666
暂时还不会
Not yet. I'm not going.

1220
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:44,796
我想在一个熟悉的环境里
安定下来
I want to settle down. Live somewhere
people know me. Put some money by.

1221
01:31:45,004 --> 01:31:49,467
而且成为这个家的一分子
- Start a business. Be part of the family.
- I see.

1222
01:31:49,675 --> 01:31:54,096
-我知道了
-乖乖跟我做朋友吧
The most sensible thing for you to do
is to be friends with me.

1223
01:31:54,305 --> 01:31:57,016
我愿为你做一切事情
I can do a lot for you, Charlie,
for all of you.

1224
01:31:57,225 --> 01:32:01,187
不我们不要你的帮助
No, not you.
We don't want anything from you.

1225
01:32:01,395 --> 01:32:05,942
-我真希望向妈妈揭穿你
-我知道你想什麽
- I wish I'd told my mother about you.
- I know what you've been thinking.

1226
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:09,821
你知道她会怎样吗?
她感受如何?
How would your mother have felt?
What would it do to her now?

1227
01:32:10,029 --> 01:32:13,199
你爸爸呢?
他在银行的差事呢?
How about your father?
His job at the bank?

1228
01:32:13,407 --> 01:32:16,077
如果这一切都没有了
你又怎麽样?
What would become of all of you
if everything came out?

1229
01:32:16,244 --> 01:32:19,580
你不用害怕
我不能告诉他们
You needn't be afraid. I can't tell them.

1230
01:32:19,789 --> 01:32:24,418
我才不怕呢
你能向谁说?谁相信你?
But I'm not afraid. What would you tell?
Who'd believe you?

1231
01:32:24,627 --> 01:32:26,754
你脑子里都是想著华尔兹
A waltz runs through your head.

1232
01:32:26,963 --> 01:32:31,175
你从戒指上的刻字
联想到报纸的新闻
You don't like the initials on a ring and
connect it up with a newspaper clipping.

1233
01:32:31,384 --> 01:32:33,845
-你甚至连戒指也丢了
Now, you haven't even got the ring.
I don't know what became of it.

1234
01:32:34,053 --> 01:32:36,931
-你拿了
我?
- You have it.
- I?

1235
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:39,183
我送给你了
I gave it to you.

1236
01:32:40,726 --> 01:32:45,815
我不要你在这
不要你碰我妈妈
I don't want you here, Uncle Charlie.
I don't want you to touch my mother.

1237
01:32:46,023 --> 01:32:51,028
快走--我警告过你
不然我会亲手杀了你
So go away, I'm warning you.
Go away, or I'll kill you myself.

1238
01:32:51,237 --> 01:32:53,197
看见了吗?
这就是我对你的感觉
See? That's the way I feel about you.

1239
01:33:20,391 --> 01:33:22,852
-给你祖
-噢香水
- Here you are, Joe.
- Oh, perfume.

1240
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:27,148
-清新芬芳的熏衣草
-我知道
- Just the fresh, clean smell of lavender.
- Yeah, I know.

1241
01:33:27,356 --> 01:33:29,192
-你们都那麽英伟
You look very handsome, both of you.

1242
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:33,488
-我真为你们感到自豪
-艾玛你也很迷人
- I'm proud of the two men in my family.
- Emmy, you're a dream.

1243
01:33:33,696 --> 01:33:36,240
-别在孩子们说这话
It's a pity the children
have to sit on our laps.

1244
01:33:36,449 --> 01:33:39,702
这裤子有点麻烦
It's going to be a tight squeeze.
It won't do my pants any good.

1245
01:33:39,911 --> 01:33:43,414
-祖我想你来开车
-我们这样分配
<i>- Joe, I wish you could drive.
- We do it this way.</i>

1246
01:33:43,623 --> 01:33:47,168
-查莉你坐--
-查理叔叔可以跟爸爸坐後面...
<i>- Charles, you'll sit -
- He can sit in the back with Dad.</i>

1247
01:33:47,376 --> 01:33:49,629
-孩子们坐在旁边
-不可以
The children can fit in beside them.

1248
01:33:49,837 --> 01:33:51,589
你们都上出租车...
Nonsense. I'm getting a cab.
You all go in the taxi.

1249
01:33:51,798 --> 01:33:55,593
-查莉和我开车
-不查理叔叔你坐出租车
<i>- Charlie and I'll go in the car.
- No, Uncle Charlie, you go in the taxi.</i>

1250
01:33:55,802 --> 01:33:57,011
我要坐出租车!
I want to ride in the taxi!

1251
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:59,472
当然可以
就这麽定吧
Course you do. So it's all arranged.

1252
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:03,601
-查莉去车房把车开出来
-我想全家人坐车
- Charlie, run out and get the car.
- I'd rather drive the family.

1253
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:08,981
我想你在途中听听我演讲
给点意见
I want you to hear my speech
on the way. You're my severest critic.

1254
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:13,736
安妮
打电话叫辆出租车来
<i>Anyway, we need a taxi.
Ann, go call Mr Abercrombie.</i>

1255
01:34:13,945 --> 01:34:16,405
妈妈!
<i>Mother!</i>

1256
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:21,911
妈妈带上我
爸爸坐出租车也可以!
Mother, please ride with me.
Father can take the children. Please!

1257
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:14,964
我肯定是全场
穿得最糟糕的人
<i>Bet I'll be the only man outside
of Charles fool enough to dress up.</i>

1258
01:35:15,173 --> 01:35:19,302
不会了你穿得很体面
<i>Then you'll be the only other on e
to be correct. You look distinguished.</i>

1259
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:21,846
查理你准备好了吗?
祖你去哪?
Charles, are you all ready? Joe, are you?

1260
01:35:22,054 --> 01:35:24,474
等等!
我把外套带上
Wait a minute!
I've got to get my overcoat.

1261
01:35:24,682 --> 01:35:26,726
噢亲爱的快点!
Please, dear. Hurry!

1262
01:35:26,934 --> 01:35:30,021
别急他们没见到
我是不会开始的
Take your time, Emmy.
They can't start till I get there.

1263
01:35:30,229 --> 01:35:32,315
这里有点冷
It's getting chilly in here.

1264
01:35:32,523 --> 01:35:34,817
这里是圣罗莎
<i>KSRO, Santa Rosa,</i>

1265
01:35:35,026 --> 01:35:38,279
加州的新闻联播
<i>with studios in Vallejo
and Santa Rosa, California.</i>

1266
01:35:38,488 --> 01:35:41,157
放点音乐吧
May as well have a little music
while we wait.

1267
01:35:41,365 --> 01:35:44,702
俄勒冈州警察局
把研究范围缩小
<i>Oregon State Police pressed theirsearch
today for five -</i>

1268
01:35:44,911 --> 01:35:47,830
噢!一定要那麽大声吗?
<i>Oh! Does it have to be so loud?</i>

1269
01:35:48,039 --> 01:35:49,874
把低音听清楚点
Gets the lower tones better.

1270
01:35:50,082 --> 01:35:54,378
我喜欢大声点!
太小声我听不到!
<i>I likeit loud! If the music's too soft,
I can't tell what they're playing.</i>

1271
01:35:54,587 --> 01:35:56,798
如果我有一支乐队
肯定要组成87人
If I have a band,
I'm a-least have 87 men.

1272
01:35:57,006 --> 01:35:59,884
救命!有人被困在车房
Help, everybody!
Somebody's caught in the garage.

1273
01:36:00,092 --> 01:36:03,054
那里令人窒息!
那门开不了
They're suffocating!
There's something wrong with the door.

1274
01:36:03,262 --> 01:36:05,181
祖!
Joe!

1275
01:36:29,205 --> 01:36:31,541
让我来抱她
I'll take her. I've got her.

1276
01:36:34,961 --> 01:36:38,214
祖从我衣柜里
拿瓶酒来快点
Joe, there's some whisky on my bureau.
Get it quick.

1277
01:36:38,422 --> 01:36:41,008
-查莉查莉
-查莉?
- Charlie. Charlie. Dear Charlie.
- Charlie?

1278
01:36:41,217 --> 01:36:44,178
艾玛擦擦她的腿
罗杰给她扇凉
Emmy, rub her feet.
Roger, run get something to fan her with.

1279
01:36:44,387 --> 01:36:46,722
查莉!
Charlie!

1280
01:36:46,931 --> 01:36:49,433
安妮不要这样
<i>Ann, don't, dear.</i>

1281
01:36:49,642 --> 01:36:52,895
查莉?查莉
你想说什麽?
Charlie? What are you trying to say?

1282
01:36:57,692 --> 01:36:59,735
走开
Go away.

1283
01:36:59,944 --> 01:37:01,779
走开
<i>Go away.</i>

1284
01:37:03,114 --> 01:37:05,074
艾玛她需要你
<i>Emmy, she wants you.</i>

1285
01:37:05,283 --> 01:37:09,871
我在这
亲爱的妈妈在这
I'm here, darling. Here's mother.
That's right, my baby.

1286
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:13,875
没事了
你真勇敢来...
That's right, my brave little girl. Here.

1287
01:37:14,083 --> 01:37:16,419
-喝一口
-不--我没事
- Take a little sip of this.
- No, I'm all right.

1288
01:37:16,627 --> 01:37:21,340
-祖叫菲利医生来
-我没事只想站起来
- Joe, call Dr Phillips.
- No, I'm all right. I just want to get up.

1289
01:37:21,549 --> 01:37:25,470
查莉你很走运
有人把车开著
You had a wonderful escape. Someone
must have left the motor running.

1290
01:37:25,678 --> 01:37:29,182
-我找不到钥匙关上它
-我进去时找到了
- I couldn't find the key to turn it off.
- The key was there when I went in.

1291
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:31,559
幸亏我路过
Lucky thing I passed by.

1292
01:37:31,767 --> 01:37:35,271
她差点没命
全靠你知道该怎麽做
She might have died. You saved her.
You knew just what to do.

1293
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:39,650
-我也不知道怎会经过
-把演讲取消吧
- Don't know how I happened across her.
- We'll put the lecture off.

1294
01:37:39,859 --> 01:37:44,322
不你们都快去车来了
Oh, yes, there is. I want you all to go.
There's the cab now.

1295
01:37:44,530 --> 01:37:47,200
噢不行我要在这
Oh, I couldn't. I just couldn't go.

1296
01:37:47,408 --> 01:37:50,661
谁在车房发现我?
Wh-Who found me in the garage?

1297
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:53,122
贺博听到你在拍门
<i>Herb heard you beating on the door.</i>

1298
01:37:53,331 --> 01:37:57,293
我在後院经过
听到拍门声
<i>I was coming across the backyard
and I heard gaspin' and bangin'.</i>

1299
01:37:57,502 --> 01:38:00,463
我就知道里面肯定有人在
I figured there must be
a human bein' in there.

1300
01:38:00,671 --> 01:38:02,799
-贺博真聪明
-真幸运
<i>- Quick thinking, Herb.
- Lucky thing.</i>

1301
01:38:03,007 --> 01:38:05,384
贺博你刚好
经过救了我
I'm glad you happened
to be going by, Herb.

1302
01:38:05,593 --> 01:38:07,887
来妈妈
<i>Come on, Mother.</i>

1303
01:38:08,095 --> 01:38:09,847
我-我想陪你
I- I want to stay with you.

1304
01:38:10,056 --> 01:38:14,644
我不想演讲了
一想到查莉有危险
I don't feel like making a speech now,
when I think what might have happened.

1305
01:38:14,852 --> 01:38:18,773
我没事
坐下来歇会儿就行了
I'm all right. I just want to sit
on the porch a while and get the air.

1306
01:38:18,981 --> 01:38:20,775
不亲爱的让我陪你
No, darling, I won't hear of it.

1307
01:38:20,983 --> 01:38:25,988
真的没事
我在家准备晚会了
I'm alright, really. I'd rather stay home
and get things ready for the party.

1308
01:38:26,197 --> 01:38:28,699
亲爱的让我留下来
Darling, I want to stay with you.

1309
01:38:34,205 --> 01:38:37,542
贺博你带罗杰好吗?
安妮跟我们坐
Herb, will you take Roger?
Ann, you come with us.

1310
01:38:39,836 --> 01:38:45,299
真奇怪
首先是楼梯有意外--
I just don't understand it.
First the stairs and...

1311
01:39:04,443 --> 01:39:06,737
格翰先生不在?
Mr Graham isn't there?

1312
01:39:08,948 --> 01:39:12,076
是弗雷斯诺的
史都华旅馆吗?
This is the Hotel Stewart in Fresno,
isn't it?

1313
01:39:12,285 --> 01:39:14,704
你没见过他?
And you don't expect him?

1314
01:39:14,912 --> 01:39:16,998
那好了谢谢你
I see. Thank you.

1315
01:39:18,583 --> 01:39:22,545
他不在?
谢谢再见
He isn't there?
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

1316
01:39:23,254 --> 01:39:25,840
你能告诉我怎样找到他吗?
Can you tell me where I can reach him?

1317
01:39:26,048 --> 01:39:30,219
我已经用他留下的地址找他
I've already tried to get him
at the address he gave me in Fresno.

1318
01:39:31,721 --> 01:39:33,764
谢谢
Thank you.

1319
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:14,263
妈妈我能吃三文治吗?
Mom, may we have some sandwiches?

1320
01:40:14,472 --> 01:40:18,309
不要在客厅拿东西吃
去厨房
Don't take anything from the dining room.
Go in the kitchen.

1321
01:40:18,518 --> 01:40:21,729
让我来拿大衣--
<i>Please go. And just leave your coats...</i>

1322
01:40:23,064 --> 01:40:25,358
祖你来招呼大家吧?
<i>Joe, dear,
will you take care of everyone?</i>

1323
01:40:25,566 --> 01:40:27,068
查莉!
<i>Charlie!</i>

1324
01:40:27,276 --> 01:40:29,070
我下来了
I'll be right down.

1325
01:40:29,278 --> 01:40:32,323
啊...现在...
<i>Well... now... hm.</i>

1326
01:40:34,867 --> 01:40:39,831
奥克里先生
我还想香槟只在打仗时喝
Now, Mr Oakley. I thought champagne
was only for battleships!

1327
01:40:40,039 --> 01:40:45,670
我和妻子都不要了
你们喝吧
None for me, nor I'm sure, for my wife.
But we hope you'll all forget we're here.

1328
01:40:45,878 --> 01:40:49,048
让我们来乾杯--
查莉还没下来吗?
I'd like to propose a toast to...
Isn't Charlie coming down?

1329
01:40:49,257 --> 01:40:52,135
她就下来了波特太太
She'll be down in a moment.
Mrs Potter.

1330
01:40:52,343 --> 01:40:57,098
别吃那个
我弄马铃薯仅为了调味
Not that one. Why do I make tomato?
They always soak through the bread.

1331
01:40:57,306 --> 01:41:02,019
试这个有小麦面包
奶油和辣椒
Try one of these. It's whole wheat bread
and cream cheese. Paprika makes it pink.

1332
01:41:02,228 --> 01:41:04,564
-格林先生
-格林太太你呢?
- Mr Greene.
- Mrs Greene, what would you like?

1333
01:41:04,772 --> 01:41:06,440
谢谢
Thank you.

1334
01:41:06,649 --> 01:41:09,527
-我也要乾杯
-艾玛
- I think I'd like to propose a toast, too.
- Emmy.

1335
01:41:09,735 --> 01:41:14,907
为我们的访客
近年来最好的演讲者
To our distinguished visitor, who made
the best speech heard in town for years.

1336
01:41:15,116 --> 01:41:18,244
为奥克里先生乾杯
To that very good fellow, Mr Oakley.

1337
01:41:18,452 --> 01:41:20,955
-贺比
-谢谢
- Herbie.
- Thank you.

1338
01:41:21,164 --> 01:41:23,124
我们没有什麽
美国的演讲者
<i>We don ' t get many American speakers.</i>

1339
01:41:23,332 --> 01:41:25,084
也许外来的才是最好的
<i>Seems like foreigners
make the best talkers.</i>

1340
01:41:28,296 --> 01:41:31,799
啊她来了我们来乾杯
Ah, here she is. Now for my toast.

1341
01:41:40,099 --> 01:41:42,143
查莉...
Charlie...

1342
01:41:43,936 --> 01:41:46,230
你来得正好
You're just in time for a farewell toast.

1343
01:41:46,439 --> 01:41:51,444
我不得不宣布
明天我会离开这
I hate to break the news to you like this,
but tomorrow I must leave Santa Rosa.

1344
01:41:51,652 --> 01:41:54,780
-暂时离开
-真巧合
- Not forever.
- If that isn't the strangest coincidence.

1345
01:41:54,989 --> 01:41:57,533
-我明天准备去三藩市
-查理
<i>- I'm off to San Francisco.
- Charles?</i>

1346
01:41:59,243 --> 01:42:02,079
噢艾玛
我也不想打扰大家的雅兴
Oh, Emmy darling,
I didn't mean to spoil your fun tonight.

1347
01:42:02,288 --> 01:42:06,083
我收到通知
明早\'要赶火车
I got a letter today.
I have to catch the early morning train.

1348
01:42:07,043 --> 01:42:09,086
艾玛我会想念你
I'll miss you, Emmy.

1349
01:42:12,799 --> 01:42:17,053
我觉得这个小镇的人...
But I want you all to know
I'll always think of this lovely town...

1350
01:42:18,346 --> 01:42:21,265
都很热情好客...
<i>as a place of hospitality
and kindness...</i>

1351
01:42:22,433 --> 01:42:25,394
令我有家的温暖...家
<i>and homes... homes.</i>

1352
01:42:25,603 --> 01:42:30,358
-查理我不想你走
-艾玛我会回来的
- But I can't bear it if you go, Charles.
- Oh, Emmy, I'll be back.

1353
01:42:30,566 --> 01:42:36,197
我还有建造
孩子们的医院呢
<i>I've arranged with Dr Phillips
for our little memorial for the children.</i>

1354
01:42:37,365 --> 01:42:40,368
不是你要做什麽
It isn't any of the things you've done.

1355
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:46,916
只是我们好不容易才一起!
It's just the idea
that we were together again. I'm sorry.

1356
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:51,087
我们从小相依为命
<i>But you see,
we were so close growing up.</i>

1357
01:42:51,295 --> 01:42:54,799
後来查理走了我嫁人了--
And then Charles went away,
and I got married, and...

1358
01:42:56,134 --> 01:42:58,594
大家都知道後来怎样
<i>Then, you know how it is.</i>

1359
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:03,015
身为人妻
就变得很健忘了--
<i>You sort of forget you're you.
You're your husband's wife...</i>

1360
01:43:05,893 --> 01:43:08,980
我们把你看成
是这里的一分子
We'll be looking for you. We feel
you're one of us, don't we, Margaret?

1361
01:43:09,188 --> 01:43:12,775
是啊你也是俱乐部的成员
Indeed. I want to thank you
on behalf of our club.

1362
01:43:12,984 --> 01:43:14,986
很感谢你给医院的礼物
And bless you
for your gift to our hospital.

1363
01:43:15,194 --> 01:43:18,781
-孩子们以後会感激你的
-谢谢你
- The children will bless you, too.
- Thank you, sir.

1364
01:43:18,990 --> 01:43:22,493
打扰了但我
我听到火车来了
<i>Excuse me, sir,
but I-I can hear the train coming now.</i>

1365
01:43:22,702 --> 01:43:24,120
不好意思
Excuse me.

1366
01:43:36,090 --> 01:43:38,176
查理上车吧
Better get aboard, Charles.

1367
01:43:38,384 --> 01:43:43,055
大家後会有期
罗杰安妮跟我来
Alright. Goodbye, everybody.
Roger, Ann, come see the train.

1368
01:43:43,264 --> 01:43:46,058
查莉来啊
Come on, Charlie.
You can see they get off.

1369
01:43:46,267 --> 01:43:48,102
好吧
Alright.

1370
01:43:48,311 --> 01:43:50,521
我想看看包厢
<i>I want to see the rooms,
the private ones.</i>

1371
01:43:50,730 --> 01:43:54,692
我见过卧铺
还睡过上层呢
I've seen berths. I've slept in two uppers
and one lower with papa.

1372
01:43:54,901 --> 01:43:57,653
-再见祖
-再见查理
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Goodbye, Charles.

1373
01:43:57,862 --> 01:44:01,115
-再见艾玛
-再见记得写信!
- Goodbye, Emmy.
- Goodbye. And don't forget to write!

1374
01:44:01,324 --> 01:44:05,369
我会的你也要啊
I will. You write too.
I'll send you my address.

1375
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:12,627
再见
Goodbye.

1376
01:44:15,922 --> 01:44:18,257
不要在座位上跳来跳去
Don't jump on the seats, Roger.

1377
01:44:20,218 --> 01:44:22,428
罗杰听到吗?
Roger, what did I tell you?

1378
01:44:25,932 --> 01:44:29,685
还有一个箱子
能帮我拿来吗?
Porter, there's one more bag
in the other car. Will you get it, please?

1379
01:44:29,894 --> 01:44:33,105
查莉车要开了
我可不想留下来
Charlie, the train's going to start.
I don't want to get carried away.

1380
01:44:33,314 --> 01:44:36,067
太迟了!
我要快点下去!
Maybe it's too late!
Maybe I'll have to go along!

1381
01:44:36,275 --> 01:44:38,402
我们就跟著来
There's plenty of time.
You run along, we'll follow.

1382
01:44:38,611 --> 01:44:40,238
查莉
Charlie.

1383
01:44:41,072 --> 01:44:43,115
等等
Just a minute.

1384
01:44:44,408 --> 01:44:48,496
我想告诉你
让我离开是明智的
I want you to know
I think you were right to make me leave.

1385
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:53,167
为你妈妈，对大家都好
It's best for your mother,
best for all of us.

1386
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:57,463
你看到昨晚她的反应了
You saw what happened
to her last night.

1387
01:44:57,672 --> 01:45:02,385
她不够坚强
我想她不能承受这打击
She's not very strong, you know.
I don't think she could stand the shock.

1388
01:45:02,593 --> 01:45:05,763
-记得当她还是个孩子
-火车开了!
- I remember once, when she was little -
- The train's moving!

1389
01:45:05,972 --> 01:45:09,267
听着查莉，忘记我的过去
Listen, Charlie.
I want you to forget all about me.

1390
01:45:09,475 --> 01:45:12,228
忘记所有
Forget that I ever came to Santa Rosa.

1391
01:45:13,646 --> 01:45:15,314
你的手!
Your hands!

1392
01:45:17,441 --> 01:45:20,444
查理叔叔
放手!让我走!
Let me go, Uncle Charlie! Let me go!

1393
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:26,200
查莉我不想的
I've got to do this, Charlie...

1394
01:45:26,409 --> 01:45:29,162
但你知道的太多了
so long as you know
what you do about me.

1395
01:45:40,965 --> 01:45:43,301
没到时候等车再快点
Not yet, Charlie. Let it get a little faster.

1396
01:45:45,261 --> 01:45:46,804
再快点
Just a little faster.

1397
01:45:47,013 --> 01:45:48,306
快点
Faster.

1398
01:45:48,514 --> 01:45:49,974
现在!
Now!

1399
01:46:15,792 --> 01:46:18,044
圣罗莎失去了一个好儿子
<i>Santa Rosa has gained
and lost a son,</i>

1400
01:46:18,252 --> 01:46:20,713
一个她引以为荣的儿子
<i>a son that she can be proud of.</i>

1401
01:46:20,922 --> 01:46:25,551
勇敢慷慨善良
优秀的人格
<i>Brave, generous, kindly.
With all of the spendid dignity -</i>

1402
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,763
杰克你来了真好
I'm glad you were able to come, Jack.

1403
01:46:28,971 --> 01:46:32,892
我想找人倾诉
I couldn't have faced it
without someone who knew.

1404
01:46:34,477 --> 01:46:38,523
-我知道很多但不能对你说
-我明白
- I did know more. I couldn't tell you.
- I know.

1405
01:46:40,566 --> 01:46:44,028
他认为这世界是很可怕的
He thought the world was a horrible place.

1406
01:46:44,237 --> 01:46:48,032
-他从来没有快乐过
-没有
- He couldn't have been very happy ever.
- No.

1407
01:46:49,784 --> 01:46:53,913
他不相信身边任何人
He didn't trust people.
He seemed to hate them.

1408
01:46:54,121 --> 01:46:56,374
他憎恨这个世界
He hated the whole world.

1409
01:46:57,959 --> 01:47:01,337
他说过，像我们这样的人...
You know, he said that people like us

1410
01:47:01,546 --> 01:47:05,591
不知道外面的世界是怎样
had no idea what the world was really like.

1411
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:08,719
也不是那麽糟糕
Well, it's not quite as bad as that,

1412
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:11,722
只是做人要留个心眼
but sometimes it needs a lot of watching.

1413
01:47:11,931 --> 01:47:14,851
有时人也会走向极端
It seems to go crazy every now and then.

1414
01:47:15,059 --> 01:47:17,103
像你的查理叔叔
Like your Uncle Charlie.

1415
01:47:17,311 --> 01:47:21,232
他高尚的灵魂讨人喜欢的性格，永远与我们同在
<i>The beauty of their souls, and characters live on with us forever.</i>
