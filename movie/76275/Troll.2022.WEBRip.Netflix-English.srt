00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:38,375
THE TROLL PEAKS
ROMSDALEN

2
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,583
Ah!

3
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,458
Hey Tiny, are you coming?

4
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,333
Or you gonna hang there all day?

5
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,458
I'd worry about yourself, you old fossil.

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,500
The Troll Peaks.

7
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,833
Do you remember the fairy tale?

8
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:37,958
Papa.

9
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:38,958
Come on.

10
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,166
I still don't believe in fairy tales.

11
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,000
That one was your favorite.

12
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,541
Hmm?

13
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,833
Once upon a time, at a big troll wedding,

14
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,875
13 drunk trolls lost track of time,

15
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:55,083
the sun rose and turned them to stone,
and now they're mountains.

16
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,416
Blah-blah-blah.

17
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,208
You do know that…

18
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,625
there's some truth to every fairy tale.

19
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,041
They're just mountain peaks.

20
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,166
You have to see it to believe it.

21
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:08,958
That's what they say.

22
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,166
It's the opposite.

23
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,708
You have to believe
in something to see it.

24
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,583
Can you see them, Nora?

25
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,208
Go on, try.

26
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,583
Look.

27
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,625
Not with your eyes.

28
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,166
With your heart.

29
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,500
Believe.

30
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,750
Made of earth and stones.

31
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,833
With a snow-clad heart.

32
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,625
And icy bones.

33
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,375
From darkness they came,

34
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:26,916
and died

35
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,916
in the light.

36
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:45,500
20 YEARS LATER

37
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,791
THE ATLANTIC COAST
NORTHWESTERN NORWAY

38
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,208
I understand that, sir,

39
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:57,291
but I can assure you,
we are working around the clock.

40
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,666
The whole team is, uh--
What was that, sir?

41
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,458
I can't hear you,
the reception out here is, uh…

42
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,750
Sir? Hello? Hello?

43
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,500
There's, there's…

44
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,333
There's wind and…

45
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,166
Schmuck.

46
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,708
Has anyone seen our fearless dino hunter?

47
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,958
She just started a new dig, Secord.

48
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,916
-Another one?
-Mm-hmm.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,166
Over there.

50
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,375
Of course.

51
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,041
You plan to dig up the entire beach, Nora?

52
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,375
Uh-oh.

53
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,458
I don't like that look.

54
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,708
I just got off the phone
with the university.

55
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,041
Ah, fuck.

56
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,541
Look.

57
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,625
We've been up and down this coast
for what, six months now?

58
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,458
-Nothing to show for it.
-But we just need a little more time.

59
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,666
Nora. Please.

60
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,500
We're so close. I can feel it.

61
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,916
I'm running out of excuses.
All right? And without financing…

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,833
Hell no. Screw the financing.

63
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,166
What are you doing?

64
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,041
If there was one thing
my father ever taught me,

65
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,625
it was to never, ever…

66
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,000
…ever lose…

67
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,916
faith.

68
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,666
Ha!

69
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,708
You're shitting me, right?

70
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,916
Get your ass down here, Secord.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,583
We've got something!

72
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,833
Nora, we got something, right?

73
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,333
Yes!

74
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,375
My God! Would you look at that?

75
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,125
From a time of giants.
Just like a… like a fairy tale.

76
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,708
This is no fairy tale.

77
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,916
Look at you!

78
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,708
Hi, beautiful.

79
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:03,375
HJERKINN

00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,375
WE ARE BUILDING THE DOVRE RAILWAY

81
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:13,166
Let the mountain live!
Let the mountain live!

82
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,833
TO HELL THROUGH A TUNNEL

83
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:19,666
Let the mountain live!
Let the mountain live!

84
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,875
Bring in the explosives.

85
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,583
Everyone, out!

86
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,000
Let the mountain live!

87
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,625
Boo!

88
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,416
Okay, let's get to work!

89
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,125
-Okay.
-Let's go, guys!

90
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,791
Huh?

91
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,000
Everybody out!

92
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,041
Get out! Now!

93
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,416
NORWEGIAN ARMED FORCES OPERATIONAL
HEADQUARTERS, AKERSHUS FORTRESS, OSLO

94
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,333
I'm getting a message about
high seismic activity in Dovre.

95
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,250
Where's Sigrid?

96
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,833
Requesting to send a reconnaissance
aircraft to Dovre Mountain.

97
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,083
Did I miss something?

98
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,875
ØRLAND AIR BASE
TRØNDELAG

99
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,291
Raven 4, standing by.

100
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,291
Raven 4, clear for takeoff.

101
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,458
HQ, this is Raven 4,
approaching Dovre.

102
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,291
Officer on deck, ten-hut. General.

103
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,500
As you were.

104
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,833
HQ, are you seeing this?

105
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,375
-What?
-We have visual here for you, sir.

106
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,583
Alert the Prime Minister.

107
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,916
THE PRIME MINISTER'S RESIDENCE
OSLO

108
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,291
-Good Morning.
-Good Morning.

109
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,500
-Prime Minister.
-How very formal of you, Andreas.

110
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,750
The Minister of Defense
will brief you on the way.

111
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:12,500
The only intel we have is from
the recon aircraft, which has produced

112
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,583
these images here.

113
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,666
Oh my God. It looks like
it could be a meteor crater.

114
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,333
The crew is on its way now
to assess the situation.

115
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,000
Has word of this gotten out?

116
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,625
I have the media under control.

117
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,333
Oh, Is that so?

118
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,583
There's one more thing.

119
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,125
The planes took images of the area nearby.

120
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,041
As of now, we haven't been able to confirm

121
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,833
that the imprints in the landscape

122
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,916
are directly related to the incident.

123
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,500
But, uh, we're working on it.

124
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,958
Thanks, Fred.

125
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,250
What the heck is that? Huh?

126
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,833
They almost look like footprints. Right?

127
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,041
I… I guess I shouldn't have said anything.
I'm not qualified.

128
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,250
That's right, yeah.

129
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,166
But we need to find someone who is.

130
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,208
Geologists. Archaeologists. Biologists.

131
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,500
Yeah. Ologists.

132
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,708
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

133
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,250
-Speech! Speech!
-Yes!

134
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,625
Speech! Speech!

135
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,541
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll do it.

136
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,666
Okay. Uh, "impossible", they said.

137
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,166
Absurd.

138
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,583
They even called us mad.

139
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,916
-Oh, you are mad!
-Yes. Just a little bit.

140
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,708
But I think this proves
that if you really have faith

141
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,750
in something…

142
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,208
What the hell?

143
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,083
Tidemann?

144
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,541
Nora Tidemann?

145
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,541
I'm here to escort you
to Oslo immediately.

146
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,166
-Huh?
-It's a matter of our national security.

147
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,208
Nora Tidemann?

148
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,333
Yeah.

149
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,750
Andreas Isaksen,
advisor to Prime Minister Moberg.

150
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,833
You guys know
that I dig up fossils, right?

151
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,375
I don't mean to be so mysterious.

152
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,375
-But this really is top secret.
-Top secret.

153
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,166
So I've been told.

154
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,375
You'll get more information very soon.

155
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,708
Yeah, I heard that too.

156
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,750
You could've just called me.

157
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,625
Once you see,
I think you'll understand why.

158
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,458
They don't include this area
in the guided tour.

159
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,708
-Star Trek?
-Sigrid and I have an ongoing thing.

160
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,458
-That sounded bad, not like that.
-Dude!

161
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,416
You've dragged me out here from a project
I spent years financing and planning.

162
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,750
Yeah? I didn't eat anything
and I'm exhausted,

163
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,541
which is a really awful combination.

164
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,125
-I'm in the dark…
-The reports we received have indicated…

165
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,041
…and I'm not getting one damn answer--

166
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,750
Hi.

167
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,416
This is Nora Tidemann.
She's a professor of Paleontology.

168
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,375
Paleontology? Really?

169
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,750
Dinosaurs?

170
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,375
That's right. I study fossils.

171
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:24,875
Hmm.

172
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,333
Dinosaurs have been extinct
for 65 million years, so…

173
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,750
Yes. Well, I guess
we can cross dinosaurs off, then.

174
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,375
Yes. Continue, Lunde.

175
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,125
First of all, I have to be clear

176
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,541
that at this moment
we cannot say with certainty

177
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,791
that this was not a military attack
or act of terrorism.

178
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,666
But the reports so far indicate
that the incident at Dovre

179
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,416
is geological in nature.

180
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,875
In addition to the crater
in the mountainside,

181
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,958
a series of indentations
were discovered in the landscape.

182
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,166
-Could it be a Karst?
-Excuse me?

183
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,541
Sinkholes.

184
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,166
Water seeps through
the mountain's porous crevices,

185
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,875
which dissolves calcium sediments
beneath the ground.

186
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,041
This creates underground caverns,
which ultimately collapse.

187
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:11,833
But it could also be the accumulation
of large subterranean pockets of gas.

188
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,500
Methane?

189
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,125
Yes, another consequence
of global warming.

190
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,583
Yes, well, I guess
we better call Greta.

191
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,166
The demolition work could perhaps
have caused a chain of explosions which--

192
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,250
Sorry.

193
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,833
Sorry.

194
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,750
Are you joking?

195
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,416
-Excuse me?
-Are you joking? Hello?

196
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,416
I can assure you, miss,
that this is deadly serious.

197
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,000
Mm… Okay.

198
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,083
But…

199
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,833
Everyone sees they're footprints, right?

200
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,500
Look at them.

201
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,291
Footprints.

202
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,625
Is there a… specific type of monster

203
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,416
the paleontologist had in mind?

204
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:58,291
Well, uh, it makes no sense
considering the deepest footprints…

205
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,541
We have something.

206
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,375
A protester got footage of the incident
with a cell phone camera.

207
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,250
It wasn't easy hacking
the cell phone remotely.

208
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,666
It was nearly impossible,
between you and me.

209
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,000
Then I found a back door.
Had to dig a little.

210
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,166
Um, long story short, bingo!

211
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,958
Let the mountain live!
Let the mountain live!

212
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,250
Let the mountain live! Let the mountain--

213
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,875
Oh God.

214
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,708
Run, go! Get back!

215
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,166
-Could that be methane?
-It very well could be, yes. After years…

216
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,375
-The explosion emanates from the same…
-Hey. Sigrid?

217
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,458
Can-- Is it possible to, uh,
go back a little… in the film?

218
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,375
Right there, if you can.

219
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,583
-Start from there.
-Let the mountain live--

220
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,708
That sound, it's like some kind of…

221
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,666
animal.

222
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:27,708
Stop.

223
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,958
The road past Dovre is temporarily closed

224
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,416
due to construction work
on the new express railway.

225
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,583
The road will be reopened soon,
according to government officials.

226
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,125
-I wonder what's gotten into Solo?
-Hm.

227
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,833
He's losing his mind out there.

228
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,416
Huh.

229
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,166
Ah, well.

230
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,416
Huh?

231
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,208
Dear God!

232
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,291
Honey? Get in the basement!

233
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,583
Hurry.

234
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,708
Oh! Ah!

235
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,708
Are you claiming it's a hominid?
Give me a break.

236
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,625
-Morphologically… See those footprints?
-That is enough.

237
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,958
You have to start using language
that everyone can understand!

238
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,458
As far as I can see,
we have two legs, right?

239
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,541
And two arms.

240
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,708
So what you're proposing here
is that it's a giant chimp?

241
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,708
King Kong. Perhaps?

242
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:10,750
The largest primates on earth
are only… ten to thirteen feet.

243
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,750
According to what we know.

244
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:16,250
This thing… seems to be
over a hundred and fifty feet tall.

245
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,208
That would be unnatural.

246
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,708
Or supernatural.

247
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,666
And is there nothing

248
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,666
else you've found?

249
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,458
Our searches haven't found
further evidence.

250
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,125
What plans do you have?

251
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,291
Are we gonna sit on our asses discussing
theories, or are we gonna take action?

252
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,291
Miss, please, restrain yourself.

253
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,500
Professor Tidemann, thank you.

254
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,833
I can put my work on hold
for the time being.

255
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,208
To help out with the efforts in Dovre.

256
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,541
But talking about gas pockets with
Professor Sinkhole is really not for me.

257
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,583
Nora Tidemann.

258
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,583
The Prime Minister has
made you a Scientific Adviser.

259
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,750
There's been an incident in Lesja.

260
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,791
-We need to go there immediately.
-"We"?

261
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,541
Oh. Yes, I've been assigned
to escort you there.

262
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,166
Uh, so what was, uh…

263
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,791
What was the reason
you started digging for fossils?

264
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,791
Uh…

265
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:53,458
Ever since I was a little girl,
I had a love of nature.

266
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,833
And, of course, I was raised
on stories and fairy tales.

267
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,916
My father was a professor
of origin mythologies and folklore.

268
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,625
Yeah, a folklorist.
I thought they were all extinct.

269
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,458
And your mother? What does she do?

270
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,458
-She died when I was ten.
-I'm sorry?

271
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,375
She died when I was ten.

272
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,500
Huh.

273
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,583
Well, at least you two had each other.

274
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,750
You and your father, right?

275
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,541
Yeah.

276
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,541
What?

277
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:33,083
My dad had a huge heart,
and an even bigger imagination, so…

278
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,375
Eventually, he kind of
lost touch with reality.

279
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,458
Really?

280
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,166
"You have to believe in something
to see it," he always said.

281
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,791
Yeah, and then,

282
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,166
his beliefs went a little too far.

283
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,166
-Ah.
-Yeah.

284
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,541
I once believed I'd be a writer.

285
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,208
I'm writing a book right now, actually,

286
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,291
about a monk that can tear his head off

287
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,625
and throw it at the bad guys
so he can bite them.

288
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,333
-That's unreal.
-Right?

289
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:10,291
Also, he'll pull off his fingers
and throw them like darts, and--

290
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,625
Professor Tidemann?

291
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,291
-Nora.
-Captain Holm, Special Operations Command.

292
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,583
-Andreas Isaksen, Prime Minister's Office.
-Welcome to Lesja.

293
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,333
Huh.

294
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,041
Here's what we know.

295
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,208
Whatever it was came from that direction.

296
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,500
It made its way across the river
and into the valley.

297
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,125
The tracks continue
two miles south into the mountains,

298
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,458
then come to a stop.

299
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,250
-Come to a stop?
-Yes.

300
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,041
Huh.

301
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,208
-There haven't been any other sightings?
-We did a sweep of the area.

302
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,291
We found nothing.

303
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:07,375
-You're a paleontologist?
-Her main field is paleobiology.

304
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,833
Ah… Right.

305
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,833
So, uh, what's the theory?

306
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,125
That a T-rex has strayed
into the Norwegian mountains?

307
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,875
Well, that remains to be seen,
Captain Holm.

308
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:18,791
Kris.

309
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,166
You can call me Kris.

310
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,166
Captain Kris?

311
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,541
Yeah.

312
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,666
Well, I, uh…

313
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,458
I couldn't see it clearly.

314
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,416
It-- It was dark.

315
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,500
I see.

316
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,041
Were the clouds outside

317
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:37,833
blocking the sun?

318
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:39,625
No, ma'am.

319
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,083
It was something else.

320
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,083
It was as if we were
in the shadow of the mountain.

321
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,541
And the mountain was m-- moving.

322
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,875
Ugh. It scared Solo to death.

323
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,333
Huh, Solo? Huh?

324
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,541
My poor boy.

325
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,166
- Huh? Yes, it did. Didn't it?
-And, um…

326
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,958
Are there any other details
you can remember?

327
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,041
Any memory of what happened,
anything at all.

328
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,166
I don't-- I'm so sorry, but I'm…

329
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,291
I'm still in shock.

330
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,291
It's okay.

331
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,125
Mmm. Thank you very much.

332
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:16,625
There was one thing…

333
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,583
-Mm-hm
-There was this sound.

334
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,541
It…

335
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,708
It sounded like it was… howling?

336
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:26,958
What are you talking about?
I didn't hear any howling.

337
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:30,250
Lars can't hear anything.
He has to wear hearing aids.

338
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,208
What?

339
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,541
Uh, howling?

340
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,375
Howling like some wind?

341
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:37,666
No, it sounded more like a… melody.

342
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,125
A sad melody.

343
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,208
It was heartbreaking.

344
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,958
It's almost like a natural disaster
made its way through this valley.

345
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,750
A natural disaster on two legs.

346
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,375
What is that?

347
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,541
What?

348
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,000
That smell?

349
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,500
Norwegian nature.

350
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,291
Yeah.

351
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:31,958
And something…

352
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:34,791
more.

353
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:36,750
More than nature?

354
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,916
Yes. Hypernature.

355
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,000
Hypernature.

356
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,250
Whoa.

357
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,083
Look how deep it is.

358
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,791
-What are you doing?
-UV light.

359
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,708
Checking for biological traces.

360
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:05,833
See anything?

361
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:08,875
Nothing.

362
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,541
Only earth and stones.

363
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,875
What?

364
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:16,958
Forget about it.

365
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,875
It's just some old rhyme.

366
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,166
Is there a plan?

367
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,625
What are you thinking?

368
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,875
Did you say it was
two miles south of here?

369
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,333
It stops down there.

370
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:48,083
No more tracks.

371
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,666
Look at the thermal scanner.

372
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,791
There's no sign of life.

373
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,958
Nothing's there, just mountains.

374
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:01,083
Impossible. It's too big
to just disappear into thin air.

375
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,541
And no place to hide.

376
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,916
CAMOUFLAGE?

377
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,416
Do you have a theory?

378
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,916
-Damn it!
-What is it?

379
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:29,916
Ugh.

380
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,916
There's someone we need to… visit.

381
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,000
Listen, if it's okay with you,

382
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,375
um, it's better if I do all the talking--

383
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:45,666
I'm staying here!

384
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,333
I won't go back there.

385
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:51,500
We aren't taking you anywhere.

386
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Lower the shotgun, Papa, please!

387
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,250
Tiny?

388
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,500
Can you lower the shotgun?

389
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:15,833
It's been a while.

390
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,791
Yes, I've been kind of busy.

391
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,083
Huh…

392
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,333
What's up with the egghead?

393
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:30,166
Andreas Isaksen.

394
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,416
Advisor to Prime Minister Moberg.

395
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,333
Ha!

396
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,791
Yeah.

397
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:36,333
-Everything okay?
-Hey!

398
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,541
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

399
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,083
-Easy!
-Hey, hey!

400
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,583
Put it down.

401
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,625
This is Captain Kris…

402
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,666
toffer Holm.

403
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,500
And Kris, this is Tobias Tidemann.

404
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,083
It's-- It's… It's her father.

405
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,041
Okay.

406
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,250
It's a pleasure.

407
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,750
Can we go inside and talk?

408
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:00,166
Come on. This is important.

409
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:06,333
Maybe…

410
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:10,000
Get some pants to put on as well.

411
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,875
I see you hired a decorator.

412
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,541
Uh… No.

413
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,791
The winter of 1943,

414
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,791
the Nazis used Russian war prisoners

415
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:49,875
to build the Nordland Railway,
but only got to Bodø.

416
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,375
Some believe the construction stopped

417
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,416
due to something they found
inside the mountain.

418
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,083
Oh yeah? What was it?

419
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,833
Something came out of the mountain.

420
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:02,583
Exactly. But it would've been hard
to prove, so they got rid of the witnesses

421
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:03,708
and suppressed all of it.

422
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,666
No, Papa. Today.

423
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,500
Something came out of the mountain today.

424
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,416
We have followed

425
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,750
footprints of this, uh, thing.

426
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,041
But they just stop, all of a sudden.

427
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,916
Huh, huh, huh,
huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.

428
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,458
And no superstition, fairy tales,
or fantasy, or any of that.

429
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:43,833
We've put all that to rest, right, Papa?

430
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:47,625
I just thought there may be
something in your work

431
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:49,458
to point us in the right direction.

432
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,416
You know these mountains
better than anyone.

433
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:57,291
Ah…

434
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,583
Did you know Norway
imposed the maximum penalty

435
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:07,458
for contact with trolls up until 1840?

436
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,458
Trolls?

437
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,541
Why were we never taught
that trolls actually existed?

438
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:12,458
Tobias!

439
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:15,125
They wandered freely
a thousand years ago. It's the truth.

440
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,375
Didn't I just tell you
not to bring that up again?

441
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:21,500
You know a thousand years is just
a blip in the evolutionary process.

442
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,958
If the trolls really lived here,

443
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:26,041
scientist would've found DNA profiles

444
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:29,833
or troll fossils in sedimentary rocks,
and their extinction could be explained.

445
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:33,166
We already know the explanation
for why they died off.

446
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,583
The Christianization of Norway.

447
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,750
Oh, and why does no one else
know about this except you?

448
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,541
That's because I was
this close to revealing it all.

449
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:46,875
They threw me in the loony bin.
They have always known.

450
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,000
For the love of God…

451
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:51,541
Kittelsen, what was he hiding?

452
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,791
This obvious mistake. Was it on purpose?

453
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:57,416
-Mistake?
-Please.

454
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,791
The collection of folk tales,
all the myths, all the artwork he did.

455
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,125
-It was to cover up the truth.
-Papa!

456
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:07,625
Every recorded fairy tale was written
to tarnish the trolls' reputation.

457
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:10,750
To make fun of them.
Asbjørnsen and Moe's contribution.

458
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:13,125
They portrayed them as dumb!

459
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:16,791
Evil and stingy. Meanwhile,
the humans were so great!

460
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,916
We're enlightened and mentally superior.

461
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,166
Yeah. If you tell a lie enough times,
people will take it as the truth.

462
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,416
-Ah! The egghead admits it.
-Huh?

463
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:26,166
Of course!

464
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:31,000
Wait. I think we should take
a couple minutes to breathe…

465
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,416
-That sounds like a good plan.
-A couple minutes?

466
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,833
We can't waste a second.
Let's get going, Tiny.

467
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:37,208
Don't call me that.

468
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,458
An adventure!

469
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:39,458
Watch your head.

470
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,916
They stop abruptly.

471
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:49,208
We're right here, is that right?

472
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
That's the spot.

473
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:52,541
Yeah?

474
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,625
That means he walked

475
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,250
from there all the way here.

476
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,166
"He"?

477
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:04,083
I suppose it could be a gyger.

478
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:05,416
A… gyger?

479
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,416
An ogress.

480
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,958
A female troll.

481
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,250
Ay…

482
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,000
Take the chopper down! Here!

483
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:22,791
Take it down!

484
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:24,708
Go down now!

485
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,250
Old man Tidemann.

486
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:35,708
An interesting guy.

487
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,208
He’s always been a tad… eccentric.

488
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:47,333
And then, he went so far down
the rabbit hole he lost his job over it.

489
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,208
It's pretty sad, actually.

490
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:52,625
He was committed
to a hospital for a while.

491
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,208
I see.

492
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:57,958
I… I hoped I would find him
in a better state.

493
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,833
Hey, I should probably help.

494
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,250
-Okay.
-I think that's a good idea.

495
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:13,666
You find anything?

496
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,083
It's wrong. Everything is wrong here.

497
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:18,000
What is?

498
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,083
Everything.

499
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,041
Topography. It doesn't match.

500
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,291
Everything is off.

501
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:24,958
See?

502
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:30,750
Eh…

503
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,625
What?

504
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,416
It's been a while.

505
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,833
You and I adventuring,
just like old times.

506
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,083
This isn't a reconciliation between us.

507
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,833
Please don't, okay.

508
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,291
I still remember the sparkle in your eye

509
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,708
when I told you about
the secrets of the world.

510
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,500
The same curiosity as your mother.

511
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:53,291
What happened?

512
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:55,916
I grew up, all right?

513
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,125
Oh, come on.

514
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:02,083
What do you think
we're looking for here, Nora? Hmm?

515
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,416
What you're suggesting
is nothing but a fantasy.

516
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,750
The dinosaurs were also once
considered fantasy creatures.

517
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:10,500
-Unnatural.
-No, they are nature.

518
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:13,250
-For God's sake.
-Made of earth and stones.

519
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,541
From within the mountain,
it rose from the ground…

520
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,333
Hm?

521
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:21,083
-What is it?
-That smell.

522
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,041
Look, I bathe every Saturday.

523
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,291
Not you, it's…

524
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,333
hypernature.

525
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,000
Hypernature?

526
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Hypernature…

527
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:53,250
-Papa?
-Huh?

528
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:07,000
Kris.

529
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:17,541
Start the engine.

530
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,250
Come on!

531
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:36,333
Come on!

532
00:35:58,541 --> 00:35:59,833
Call up Oslo!

533
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,666
Yes. Putting it on the screen now.

534
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,458
You need to see this!

535
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:24,041
What in the hell is that?

536
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,583
RENA MILITARY CAMP
ØSTERDALEN

537
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,041
-Pretty intense, huh?
-Yeah.

538
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,500
-Even the square is scared.
-Yes, it's big.

539
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,583
-Papa?
-Yeah?

540
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:44,958
No matter what they ask…

541
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Whatever the people in uniforms say,

542
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,750
swear you won't say the word "troll".

543
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,791
Okay?

544
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,958
Troll? What do you mean, troll?

545
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:56,375
-Does the sound not work or--?
-He doesn't mean a fairy tale creature.

546
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:57,750
-It's more like a…
-A troll!

547
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,625
This is a troll!

548
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,208
I'm sorry.

549
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:05,583
The point is that we really don't know
what kind of creature we're dealing with

550
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,125
unless we have more time to--

551
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:10,541
Time? We don't have one second to waste.

552
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,250
Yes, but we can't make
rash decisions either.

553
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,166
What are you suggesting?
Inviting the troll to a friendly race?

554
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,458
Just like in the fairy tales?

555
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,416
Here's my two cents. All due respect.

556
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,166
I don't think you're mentally stable
if you fail to see

557
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,958
that tunneling through
the Dovre Mountains…

558
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:27,500
-Papa.
-…is a mockery of nature.

559
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,750
-But that's what you guys do!
-Tobias.

560
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:32,958
Just move ahead.
Never stopping to ask if you should!

561
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,541
-What are you doing?
-I'm helping.

562
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,875
No, you're not!
This is just like our PTA meetings--

563
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:38,125
Are you finished?

564
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:40,833
-That crazy teacher of yours--
-If I may interrupt.

565
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:44,625
This isn't a small ogre we're talking
about, but a fully grown mountain troll.

566
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:47,583
-Get that man out of here.
-20 years I've been doing troll research.

567
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,583
And I'm the crazy one?! I'm the crazy one?

568
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:52,750
-I'll take care of it.
-Yeah, good luck!

569
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,083
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

570
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,000
Enough!

571
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,416
I'll go!

572
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,708
-Let go of me! Let go of me!
-Prime Minister.

573
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:01,708
The answer may come
if you please give us more time. Okay?

574
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:04,750
I'm sorry, Tidemann. The risk is too high.

575
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:07,041
We're implementing a military operation.

576
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,500
You insist on your fairy tale theories,

577
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,708
but this isn't some
mystical fantasy creature

578
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:21,041
that can smell Christian blood
and turns to stone in sunlight.

579
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,708
If you're so sure about it,
why'd you come to me?

580
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:31,958
This is the end of our little adventure.
I'm going back to the dig.

581
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:34,708
It was nice to see you, Papa.

582
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:37,291
Imagine waking up,
and everything you know is gone.

583
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,541
You wake up to a whole new world.

584
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:43,958
Like this troll…

585
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,125
This creature…

586
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,083
You think it wants to be here?

587
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,958
We can scare it with weapons.

588
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:57,708
We can push it around.

589
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:59,125
But I promise, Nora.

590
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,750
Nature will push back.

591
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:06,916
What do you want to do? Just give up?

592
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,083
Even egghead doesn't want to give up.

593
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,416
No…

594
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,541
The adventure has just begun.

595
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,583
There you are.

596
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:33,333
Kris!

597
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,166
Captain!

598
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,708
You're civilians, Tidemann.
This is a military operation.

599
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,291
Oh, so now we're on
a last-name basis, Captain Holm?

600
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:44,333
We won't be in the way.

601
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,625
We will only observe.

602
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:48,708
You won't even know we're there.

603
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:50,666
-Hey!
-Sorry. Sorry!

604
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,375
It's completely out of the question.

605
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:56,541
But we have to bend the rules
a little sometimes, don't we?

606
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:01,416
Kris. Please.

607
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,083
Tidemann.

608
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:06,416
-Yes?
-Yeah?

609
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,458
If you do come along,
you have to lay low and follow my orders.

610
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,833
Understand?

611
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:15,916
And if Oslo finds out I brought you along…

612
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,916
Yeah, I…

613
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,833
Don't worry.
You'll be dead before sunrise.

614
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:41,666
Go! Go! Go! Go!

615
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,708
Now!

616
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:11,916
Ladies and gentlemen,

617
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,958
we are live from Heidal.

618
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,333
Piranha, this is Viking.

619
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:20,000
Status? Over.

620
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:22,750
Viking, this is Piranha.
We are in position. Over.

621
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:25,375
3-Alpha, status? Over.

622
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:28,333
Viking, this is 3-Alpha.

623
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:29,916
We are in position. Over.

624
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:31,500
Copy that.

625
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:37,291
What now?

626
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,125
We wait.

627
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:46,583
So do I have this right?
He can take off his own head…

628
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:47,750
Yeah.

629
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,250
He can throw it at people
and bite them?

630
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,041
Exactly, or his hand.

631
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,958
He can rip it off and throw it,

632
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:55,500
like a fist-snowball.

633
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,958
Huh. Fascinating.

634
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:00,458
Yeah, it, uh…

635
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,250
Can you picture it?

636
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,708
Wandering around in large herds.

637
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,125
Families.

638
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:31,916
"Made of earth and stones."

639
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,333
"A snow-clad heart, and ice for bones."

640
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:41,916
I remember it all.

641
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,000
The fairy tales from you and Mom,

642
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:51,458
and all the… emptiness after.

643
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:56,375
How we dealt with it.

644
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,083
I remember that as well.

645
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,583
The adventures of Big and Tiny.

646
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,291
Is this a reconciliation thing?

647
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,625
You and me?

648
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:26,708
Is that a PVS-31?

649
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,291
Uh, it is, actually.

650
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:31,750
That's what I thought.

651
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:34,041
-Do you have military experience?
-A little.

652
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:35,416
Oh yeah?

653
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:37,291
"Call of Duty."

654
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,458
Nora, the truth is, um…

655
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:47,291
you lost us both,

656
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,833
when your mother died.

657
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:55,875
You're here now.

658
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:00,333
You old fossil.

659
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,416
Mm.

660
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:05,875
Are you crying?

661
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:09,625
It's my pine allergy.

662
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,083
I'm allergic to forests.

663
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:26,375
-Ah…
-Pretty sweet, huh?

664
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:28,958
These things give you
a real arcade feeling, am I right?

665
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,125
-Yeah.
-3-Alpha for Viking.

666
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:33,541
-3-Alpha for Viking, over.
-Viking, go ahead.

667
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,500
Copy that. I need my helmet.

668
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:39,750
Here… Loosen the strap.

669
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:40,666
-Ow!
-Hold still.

670
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,375
-Get your fat fingers out of there.
-Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

671
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:44,291
Man…

672
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:47,208
He's here.

673
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:02,541
Can I see?

674
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:16,708
It's stopping.

675
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:18,666
Ah, he knows we're here.

676
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,916
Oslo, this is Viking. Awaiting orders.

677
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:26,708
Viking,

678
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:29,666
you are authorized to open fire.

679
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,000
3-Alpha, this is Viking.

680
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,166
Engage the target.

681
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,041
Copy that.

682
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:39,041
Open fire.

683
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,208
You idiots!

684
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,250
What the hell…

685
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:55,833
It's not working.

686
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:57,333
You're pissing him off.

687
00:45:57,416 --> 00:45:58,625
3-Alpha, fall back!

688
00:45:58,708 --> 00:45:59,875
3-Alpha, fall back!

689
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:06,125
Piranha, open fire! Repeat, open fire!

690
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:08,666
Copy that, Viking. 9-8! 9-8!

691
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,791
Open fire!

692
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:12,333
Take cover!
We have incoming, take cover now!

693
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:49,208
-Stay back.
-Move back. Everyone get back.

694
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:50,291
Stay back!

695
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:05,791
Let's go!

696
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:07,750
Let's go!

697
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,000
Run!

698
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,166
Over here!

699
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,916
Hallowed be Thy name.

700
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,250
Thy kingdom come.

701
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:42,333
Thy will be done…

702
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:48,208
…on earth as it is in heaven.

703
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:52,541
Give us this day our daily bread.

704
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:55,083
And forgive us… our trespasses.

705
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,416
Amen.

706
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:03,583
Time to move out.

707
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:08,375
Oh God! Oh shit!

708
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,541
Someone help! Oh!

709
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,625
-God save me, please!
-Christian blood.

710
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,500
He smelled the blood.

711
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,125
We have to move. Come on.

712
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:30,083
-Hey!
-Papa!

713
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:33,041
Well, hello there.

714
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:33,958
All right.

715
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,833
Easy.

716
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

717
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,666
Easy.

718
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,458
That's right.

719
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,916
It's okay.

720
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:55,458
That's right…

721
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,083
Oh yeah.

722
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:02,541
I'm a friend.

723
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:49,291
Papa!

724
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,750
Papa? Papa?

725
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,041
Papa?

726
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:10,333
-Ah…
-Are you okay?

727
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:29,541
Don't move. We'll get some help.

728
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:33,458
Nora.

729
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:34,708
You saw it.

730
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:36,708
Shh, save your energy.

731
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:37,916
You saw.

732
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,625
The palace…

733
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:49,166
The king…

734
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:52,708
Home…

735
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,333
Listen, my child…

736
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:00,666
Believe…

737
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:23,541
Papa?

738
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,666
Papa.

739
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:36,541
No!

740
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:04,541
THE ADVENTURES OF TINY AND BIG

741
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:17,625
KINGDOM/CASTLE?
MEANING???

742
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:26,458
HOME!

743
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:43,375
So is he a robot?

744
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:44,458
No, no, no.

745
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:48,291
He's a zen master using his spirituality
to manipulate the physical realm.

746
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:49,625
Uh, okay.

747
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:53,750
-Oh, hey.
-Good morning.

748
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:56,208
Hi.

749
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:57,333
Any news?

750
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:00,416
Well,

751
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,708
we're tracking it with a drone.

752
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:05,291
It came to a stop in a valley.

753
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:08,500
And?

754
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:11,458
They're preparing an air strike now.

755
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:14,541
What? How come?

756
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,625
Nora…

757
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:18,958
We don't have a lot of options.

758
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,958
I mean, uh…

759
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:23,875
What are we even facing?

760
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:27,458
I can't explain what I saw.

761
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,375
I don't know what to believe anymore.

762
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,250
Let's assume.

763
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:35,708
Let's assume what?

764
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:38,250
Let's assume

765
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:41,083
there's truth to the fairy tales.

766
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:42,333
Nora,

767
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:45,208
you've been through a lot
in the last 24 hours.

768
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:47,333
-I think it's best--
-Hey, I found it!

769
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:48,250
Huh?

770
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:49,916
Your father.

771
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:54,666
He said that Kittelsen
made a mistake… in the drawing.

772
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:57,458
See? Trolls can't survive the sun.

773
00:53:57,541 --> 00:54:01,083
But look. The troll is roaming
the streets in broad daylight.

774
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:03,416
No, then Kittelsen was right.

775
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,958
What do you mean?

776
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,958
We've seen it during the day.

777
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:09,291
But,

778
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:11,750
what other rules
are there from the fairy tales?

779
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:12,791
Are you serious?

780
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,583
-Okay.
-It's-- It's just so…

781
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:15,833
So sunlight aside…

782
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:17,041
Remember. We…

783
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:18,750
We grew up with these, Andreas.

784
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:21,166
-Come on.
-Uh, don't feed them after midnight?

785
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,875
Tell me you guys are joking right now.

786
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:24,041
Crosses-- Crosses?

787
00:54:24,125 --> 00:54:26,833
-Isn't that vampires?
-Crosses? Not crosses…

788
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:27,875
The Christians.

789
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,041
The soldier.

790
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:35,666
Look. "It smells
like Christian blood in here."

791
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:38,458
-The Christianization of Norway.
-Okay.

792
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:41,125
MOISTURE - BOULDERS

793
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,375
The plan you're suggesting
is completely insane.

794
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:51,458
Foolish and insane!

795
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,625
We can't be advised by far-fetched…

796
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:54,833
Superstition?

797
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,916
Fiction?

798
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,208
Come on!

799
00:54:57,291 --> 00:54:58,291
Seriously?

800
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:00,458
Old myths

801
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:04,166
make reference to trolls
throwing boulders at churches.

802
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,375
Because they hated the sound of the bells.

803
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:09,041
This keeps
getting better and better!

804
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:12,708
Where do you stand on this, Andreas?

805
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:15,541
Uh, Prime Minister.

806
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:19,791
Um, up until this point, based
on the information we can gather…

807
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:21,625
-We can't seem to find…
-General?

808
00:55:23,708 --> 00:55:25,583
Permission to speak freely, sir?

809
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,750
Go ahead, Captain.

810
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:31,708
This enemy we're facing…
it's something we've never seen before.

811
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:34,083
The modern weapons we tried

812
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:36,000
had no effect.

813
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:38,916
I believe that
Professor Tidemann is right.

814
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:43,250
We have to think outside the box now.

815
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:45,625
Prime Minister.

816
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:48,250
Tidemann's proposal is radical.

817
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:52,250
That's for sure. And if there's one thing
that Captain Holm and I both know,

818
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:55,041
it's that extreme circumstances call for

819
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:57,250
extreme measures.

820
00:55:57,833 --> 00:55:58,833
Very well.

821
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:01,708
-Carry out the operation.
-Are you kidding me?

822
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,791
If we evacuate now,
it will be total chaos.

823
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:14,541
-People will panic.
-But we need a plan.

824
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:16,833
-But we just can't--
-It's up.

825
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,875
And it's moving southeast.

826
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:22,208
What's in its path?

827
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,083
HUNDERFOSSEN FAMILY PARK
LILLEHAMMER

828
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:40,750
-Thank you!
-Don't run too far, okay.

829
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:04,916
Viktor?

830
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,833
Earthquake.

831
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:52,875
Tidemann, what will the bells do?

832
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:54,291
Will it explode?

833
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:02,500
Oh great.

834
00:58:05,625 --> 00:58:06,833
This is Hocus 1.

835
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,916
Hold formation, let's make the first pass.

836
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:22,875
It's working!

837
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,500
This is Hocus 1. We have to move closer.

838
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:36,291
Viktor!

839
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:47,208
Hocus 3. Incoming, left side!

840
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:52,333
Mayday, mayday! We're going down!

841
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,625
Hocus 4, climb, climb, climb!

842
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,333
No.

843
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:40,625
You saw that, right?
Did he mean to do that?

844
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,333
We have shocking images
coming out of Norway at this hour.

845
00:59:56,416 --> 01:00:00,250
We are on the ground here in Norway,
and it's a nation in panic.

846
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:04,375
People running for their lives
from what seems to be a giant creature.

847
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,416
Could it be a Norwegian Godzilla?

848
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,125
They don't know what
kind of creature they're dealing with.

849
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:11,416
It just… really scared me.

850
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:14,541
More than a dozen buildings were crushed.

851
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,500
The military is everywhere!

852
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,250
We're talking about a monster here!

853
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:20,833
-Devastation.
-Destruction…

854
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:21,916
Total chaos.

855
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,250
Imagine the consequences if this creature
reaches more populated areas.

856
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:30,291
If we follow these tracks, it appears
to be heading straight for the capital.

857
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:35,000
In Norway, the military
is struggling to find a way to stop

858
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:37,875
what appears to be a monster.

859
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:05,208
We know it wasn't the desired outcome,
but… we are onto something here.

860
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:07,500
Because we saw the bells had an effect.

861
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:08,750
We have to face the facts.

862
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:10,208
-Sooner or later.
-Yes.

863
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,916
We have a killing machine
making its way towards the capitol.

864
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,708
Yes, time is of the essence.

865
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:18,791
Which is why it's important to find out
what we're up against here.

866
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,041
We have to find out why it's coming here.

867
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,708
Figuring that out gives us a chance to--

868
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:24,375
So what is it, then?

869
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:28,916
If you open up your mind to it…

870
01:01:30,916 --> 01:01:32,083
What do you think?

871
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:33,291
A threat!

872
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:35,958
That's all I need to know.

873
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:38,125
This is a threat
that must be stopped by force.

874
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:39,916
-And not hocus-pocus.
-Prime Minister.

875
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:46,041
The incredible isn't impossible.

876
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,750
Thank you kindly for your contribution,

877
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,375
Professor Tidemann.

878
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,541
Tidemann.

879
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:14,041
Uh, hi.

880
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:27,583
Nora?

881
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,416
No one could've done any better.

882
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:37,958
They're making a mistake.

883
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:39,166
That's what I think.

884
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:41,833
Captain Kris.

885
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:46,083
Just let me know,

886
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:47,916
if there's anything else I can do.

887
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,166
As long as church bells aren't involved.

888
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:54,375
I'll do my best.

889
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:58,291
We'll barricade all roads
from the northeast.

890
01:02:58,791 --> 01:03:00,541
And if it breaks through them?

891
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:02,458
Well, there is… another alternative.

892
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:03,708
No.

893
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:05,916
No? What are you talking about?

894
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,208
We, uh, have at our disposal,

895
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:11,166
missiles

896
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:14,500
that have yet to be approved… officially.

897
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,000
What you are suggesting

898
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:19,833
goes against everything
the Norwegian Armed Forces stand for.

899
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:21,750
Not to mention the catastrophic damage--

900
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:23,958
What kind of weapons are we talking about?

901
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:25,916
Why wasn't I informed of this before?

902
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
-It was still in development.
-We shouldn't even be considering this.

903
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,416
Prime Minister.

904
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,375
Um, should he be here?

905
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:35,833
Really?

906
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:39,000
Why don't you leave us alone
for a moment, Andreas?

907
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:55,500
You can consider this my resignation.

908
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:11,958
Excuse me.

909
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:18,666
Nora!

910
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:21,583
I'll take it from here.

911
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:22,625
What are you doing?

912
01:04:23,166 --> 01:04:24,416
You, uh…

913
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,541
You forgot this.

914
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,583
Come on. Come on. I-- I'll… I'll drive.

915
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,458
What's going on?

916
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:36,041
They're evacuating Oslo.

917
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:51,166
Fellow citizens.

918
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:57,000
Many of you have already heard
the news from the Dovre area.

919
01:04:57,583 --> 01:05:00,916
And the media coverage showing
what happened at Gudbransdalen.

920
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:04,000
And you could have thought that

921
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,958
these were special effects.

922
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:09,208
However, this is not make believe.

923
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:11,208
This is all real.

924
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:15,083
Norway has been prepared
to deal with major crises.

925
01:05:16,708 --> 01:05:20,875
But nothing could have prepared us all
for the crisis we are currently facing.

926
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:27,500
A creature unknown to science has
risen from deep within Dovre Mountain.

927
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,625
So now our history must be re-written.

928
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:36,166
But we need to ensure the safety

929
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,250
of our citizens and country… right now.

930
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,958
Since the first reports came in
from Dovre Mountain yesterday,

931
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:47,375
the government, the armed forces,
and our top scientists

932
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:50,416
have done their best
to get control of the situation.

933
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:56,208
It is with a heavy heart that I tell you

934
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:59,750
that our efforts so far,
unfortunately, have failed.

935
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,041
We have deemed it necessary
to explore all options

936
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:07,791
to prevent the loss of human lives.

937
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:14,416
I urge you all
to take this situation as seriously

938
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,916
as the administration and parliament does.

939
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:22,250
I hereby declare a state of emergency.

940
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:26,666
And the immediate evacuation
of Oslo and all neighboring areas.

941
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:31,000
We have faced crises
in the past, and endured.

942
01:06:31,916 --> 01:06:33,083
We stood united.

943
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:34,916
We took care of each other.

944
01:06:36,708 --> 01:06:39,708
With every fiber of my being, I beg you.

945
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:42,666
Look out for one another.

946
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,708
And God bless us all.

947
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,333
And our fatherland.

948
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,916
Resignation.

949
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:59,333
I said resignation.

950
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:01,333
That's something my grandpa would say.

951
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,375
Why couldn't I have said "I quit"
like normal people do?

952
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:09,125
I'm such a bonehead.

953
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:14,708
-Sinding?
-Mm…

954
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:18,750
I don't get what it means.
He's written it more than once.

955
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:21,375
Sinding, and something about a Gatekeeper.

956
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:22,833
It could be Rikard Sinding.

957
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,083
Who's that?

958
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,375
The Palace Lord Chamberlain.

959
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:30,958
I, uh, kind of know him.

960
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:33,666
We met a few times at the Royal Palace.

961
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:37,458
KINGDOM/PALACE?
MEANING???

962
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:39,958
The Palace…

963
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:42,000
Home…

964
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:44,500
The king…

965
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,166
-What is it?
-Turn around.

966
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:49,875
-Turn around?
-Home's the Royal Palace.

967
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:53,375
Okay…

968
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:55,583
Sorry, sorry.

969
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:57,750
Sorry! Prime Minister's Office!

970
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:09,250
THE ROYAL PALACE
OSLO

971
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:12,250
Stop!

972
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:16,541
Freeze!

973
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:18,833
-We come in peace.
-Hands in the air!

974
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:21,833
-Turn around, walk back to the car!
-We're from the Prime Minister's Office.

975
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:23,833
-Get back, all right!
-We don't have time for this!

976
01:08:23,916 --> 01:08:26,166
This is your last warning!

977
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,458
Fine. We can wait, I guess.

978
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:29,500
Walk back slowly, towards the car!

979
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:31,041
Stand down, gentlemen.

980
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:33,500
Stand down.

981
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,125
Sinding!

982
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:38,083
Remember me? Isaksen.

983
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:41,083
Prime Minister Moberg's advisor.

984
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:44,583
I assumed that someone
would show up eventually.

985
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:47,375
I can't say I'm surprised

986
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:49,291
that it was a child of Tidemann's.

987
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:58,875
You have your father's eyes.

988
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:01,791
I had a lot of respect for your father.

989
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:05,083
Although I know Tobias despised me,

990
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,541
he really was a good man.

991
01:09:08,291 --> 01:09:09,875
And stubborn as a mule.

992
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:17,875
I can count on one hand
the number of living people who have seen

993
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:19,958
what you are about to see.

994
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:31,916
I would normally insist

995
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:34,875
on ladies going first.

996
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:38,791
I won't tell anyone.

997
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,875
There was a time when
it was believed to be good luck

998
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:47,083
to build the Royal Palace
on top of another king's home.

999
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:53,291
It was nearly discovered in the 1920s
during construction for the subway.

1000
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,750
And once again.

1001
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,458
Twelve years ago.

1002
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,500
Twelve years ago?

1003
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:01,916
I deeply regretted what we did to Tobias.

1004
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,208
But it had to be done. I'm sorry.

1005
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:08,458
You destroyed the life of an innocent man,
and all you give is some bullshit apology?

1006
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:11,458
I hope this will provide you some answers.

1007
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:20,291
This was the home of the Troll King.

1008
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:25,666
Oh God!

1009
01:10:26,916 --> 01:10:29,000
During the Christianization of Norway,

1010
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:32,666
Olav the Holy rid the land of anything
incompatible with the new faith.

1011
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:37,750
He knew, that even for trolls,

1012
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:40,083
nothing could be more important

1013
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,666
than family.

1014
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:45,250
What happened?

1015
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:47,916
An ambush.

1016
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,333
It was a massacre.

1017
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:54,250
But, they spared one
of the Mountain King's children.

1018
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:58,500
And used it to lure him to Dovre,
deep into the mountain.

1019
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:02,333
Where they locked him up inside a cavern.

1020
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,791
Where they left him

1021
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:06,208
for dead.

1022
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,041
Then my father was right.

1023
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:19,708
The king is making his way
back to his castle.

1024
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:21,791
He's going home.

1025
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,500
Andreas.

1026
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:38,166
See that?

1027
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,541
From darkness they came.

1028
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:46,541
And died in the light.

1029
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:50,875
That can't be right. We…
We've seen him in broad daylight.

1030
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:52,416
We've seen him during the day.

1031
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:55,291
But have we seen him in direct sunlight?

1032
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,958
How does that help us?
We can't control the sun.

1033
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:02,625
What is the biggest vehicle you have?

1034
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:27,416
Open fire.

1035
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:38,000
Her Royal Highness the Queen's
personal favorite, right over here.

1036
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:41,083
Okay.

1037
01:12:41,666 --> 01:12:42,708
We've got wheels.

1038
01:12:44,541 --> 01:12:45,791
Now, we need muscle.

1039
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:46,791
Hmm?

1040
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:56,041
Tidemann.

1041
01:12:58,375 --> 01:12:59,208
Huh?

1042
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:01,625
A plan?

1043
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:14,125
It will destroy us.

1044
01:13:15,916 --> 01:13:16,875
All of Oslo.

1045
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,583
Prime Minister, it's your decision.

1046
01:13:25,041 --> 01:13:26,125
You have my approval.

1047
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:32,125
Let's kill this thing before it kills us.

1048
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:37,750
Downtown is too populated, but if
we lure him away from the city center…

1049
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:39,166
Maybe Holmenkollen?

1050
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,333
That's too far away.

1051
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,541
We need something closer,
and with an easier route.

1052
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,166
Mm-hm.

1053
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,125
Ekeberg.

1054
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:49,833
I can ask my buddies in the Home Guard.

1055
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:50,791
It's just…

1056
01:13:51,708 --> 01:13:54,000
Where will we find that much U…

1057
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:58,708
I've got an idea.

1058
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:20,958
The following code,
one, six, zero, three,

1059
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:23,250
seven, six, nine, nine,

1060
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:26,375
three, six, five, six, seven, nine.

1061
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:30,375
The following code, one, seven, eight,

1062
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:32,833
seven, six, eight…

1063
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,208
Code verified.

1064
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:43,541
Commencing mission immediately.

1065
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:49,750
All right! Get in!

1066
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:53,083
Sigmeister, give me good news.

1067
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:56,041
Oslo's barricades have been breached.
Their plan is to bomb Oslo.

1068
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:57,791
-No, that can't be.
-What's happening?

1069
01:14:57,875 --> 01:14:59,750
Oslo is going to be flattened.

1070
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:00,875
We need to buy more time.

1071
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:03,416
I mean, can't you just hack the system?

1072
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,208
How hard can it be
to hack into a military computer

1073
01:15:06,291 --> 01:15:08,583
and override the most high-tech
fighter plane ever made?

1074
01:15:09,166 --> 01:15:10,000
Well, sorry!

1075
01:15:10,083 --> 01:15:12,125
-I'm just trying to…
-No. Seriously.

1076
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,958
How hard can it be, right?

1077
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:14,875
Huh?

1078
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:17,291
Ah, there she is.

1079
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,250
Make it so.

1080
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:19,625
WELCOME TO OSLO

1081
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,833
There's no time to explain.
So I'll tell you later.

1082
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:43,416
EKEBERG FIELDS
OSLO

1083
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:24,916
All set.

1084
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:32,208
Come on.

1085
01:16:37,416 --> 01:16:39,416
The target is approaching the city center.

1086
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:44,583
HQ, this is Raven 4.
Confirming course toward Oslo.

1087
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:51,916
TARGET: ØRLAND_AIRPORT

1088
01:16:55,333 --> 01:16:56,958
"You shall not pass"

1089
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,166
Amir!

1090
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,500
Salaam alaikum.

1091
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:08,416
Alaikum salaam, brother.

1092
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:12,041
-You have a plan?
-You recruit anyone?

1093
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:13,416
-The cavalry?
-Hm?

1094
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:23,250
If we survive this…

1095
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:26,750
I'll owe you a Pepsi and a Toblerone.

1096
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:37,041
If your hacker friend fails us, then…

1097
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:38,916
Siggi is Spock to my Captain Kirk.

1098
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:43,000
Siggi has never failed.

1099
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:45,208
That's not even remotely possible.

1100
01:17:52,041 --> 01:17:53,833
This is Raven 4.

1101
01:17:53,916 --> 01:17:55,625
Target in sight. Awaiting orders.

1102
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:58,083
Engage.

1103
01:17:58,166 --> 01:17:59,791
Blow it into pieces.

1104
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:00,875
Copy that.

1105
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:03,791
Firing missile in

1106
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:05,750
five…

1107
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:07,041
four…

1108
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:08,208
three…

1109
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:09,958
two…

1110
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:10,875
one.

1111
01:18:12,416 --> 01:18:13,750
Huh? System malfunction.

1112
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:15,750
System malfunction. It's not working.

1113
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:16,791
Yahtzee.

1114
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:23,541
Oh…

1115
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:24,541
Siggi.

1116
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,500
Okay!

1117
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,458
-What's going on?
-Uh, I don't know.

1118
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:31,041
Why isn't anything happening?

1119
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:33,666
For some reason, I can't establish
contact with the control panel.

1120
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,916
Solve it! Just keep going.
Get connected, for God's sake.

1121
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:44,333
What if the plan fails?

1122
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:45,791
Hm?

1123
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:50,500
What if I'm just like my father?

1124
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:52,666
Completely nuts.

1125
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:56,375
In a world gone mad,
then only the crazy can be sane.

1126
01:18:57,625 --> 01:19:00,958
And you're the craziest person
on this planet, Nora Tidemann.

1127
01:19:03,833 --> 01:19:05,333
Thank you.

1128
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:07,833
I guess.

1129
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:12,708
Okay, Andreas.

1130
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,083
Let's do this.

1131
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:33,875
Dear God.

1132
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:42,250
Heigh-ho.

1133
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:45,000
Let's go.

1134
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:16,791
Now!

1135
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:31,375
He's coming! He's coming! He's coming!

1136
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:40,250
Oh!

1137
01:20:46,416 --> 01:20:47,250
Status?

1138
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:48,583
-We're close!
-Not yet!

1139
01:20:48,666 --> 01:20:49,833
Ah!

1140
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:52,291
We need more time.

1141
01:20:52,875 --> 01:20:55,000
We don't have it! We'll be there in 15.

1142
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,125
Oh shit!

1143
01:20:58,916 --> 01:21:00,208
Make it ten.

1144
01:21:00,291 --> 01:21:01,750
No, Nora…

1145
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:05,458
We're not ready…

1146
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,458
Attention!

1147
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,208
Let's bring it in!

1148
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:18,708
Come on!

1149
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:25,875
We have an incoming threat
from that direction.

1150
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:28,208
Estimated arrival is ten minutes out.

1151
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:32,708
What's about to come
over that hill right now

1152
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:35,208
is unlike anything
you've been up against before.

1153
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:37,791
And I'll be honest with you.

1154
01:21:39,666 --> 01:21:42,583
There's a very good chance
this operation won't go our way.

1155
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:45,666
But we have to ask ourselves…

1156
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:48,250
Who are we?

1157
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:50,875
If we lay down without a fight?

1158
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:54,750
Who are we if we let fear control us?

1159
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:56,208
Who could be proud

1160
01:21:56,291 --> 01:22:00,041
if we let some damn creature
waltz right over us without saying,

1161
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:03,166
"It ends here!
We'll put you back in the ground!"?

1162
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:04,958
Yeah!

1163
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,041
The bridge is closed!

1164
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:20,333
Wait! The skull!

1165
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:22,000
We-we-we… We lost the skull!

1166
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:17,875
Hi, beautiful.

1167
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:43,208
Party time.

1168
01:23:47,541 --> 01:23:49,250
He has nobody.

1169
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:54,291
The last one of his kind.

1170
01:23:56,666 --> 01:23:59,458
This reminds me of Big Billy Goat Gruff.

1171
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:03,625
Unless you think
a bigger billy goat is nearby,

1172
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:06,208
I suggest that
you step on the gas especially fast!

1173
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,416
Still no connection?

1174
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:00,208
No, something is blocking
the system from the inside.

1175
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:06,791
What are you doing?

1176
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:09,833
Uh… I'm glad you showed up.

1177
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:12,583
Um, I think someone hijacked my laptop.

1178
01:25:12,666 --> 01:25:15,625
I opened this weird email, it was…

1179
01:25:15,708 --> 01:25:17,666
from this prince in Nigeria--

1180
01:25:22,458 --> 01:25:23,916
Do you realize

1181
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:26,041
what you've done?

1182
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:34,625
This is Raven 4.

1183
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:36,500
The system is online.
Requesting new orders.

1184
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:38,875
You are still authorized to engage.

1185
01:25:39,416 --> 01:25:40,333
Copy that.

1186
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:42,458
Let's end this nightmare.

1187
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:52,250
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1188
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:03,875
You need to get out!

1189
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:08,833
Get ready!

1190
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,708
-Nora!
-Go, now!

1191
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:31,583
Nora!

1192
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:40,166
Amir, are we ready?

1193
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,666
We're close.

1194
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:48,250
Nora!

1195
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,666
Go! Go! Go!

1196
01:27:02,666 --> 01:27:04,083
Nora! Get up!

1197
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:16,458
Raven 4 approaching the target.

1198
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:17,875
Locked and loaded.

1199
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:44,250
Civilians spotted.

1200
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:46,375
I repeat, civilians spotted.

1201
01:27:46,458 --> 01:27:48,000
-Abort.
-Abort.

1202
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:49,166
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1203
01:27:49,791 --> 01:27:50,625
Abort.

1204
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:53,583
No, no, no, no, no.
Screw that. Blow that thing up!

1205
01:27:53,666 --> 01:27:55,958
-Raven 4. Abort.
-Blow up that monster!

1206
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:57,791
-Abort!
-God damn you!

1207
01:27:57,875 --> 01:27:58,708
Blow it up!

1208
01:27:58,791 --> 01:28:01,083
-I repeat, abort mission.
-Blow it up, God damn you!

1209
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:02,500
We have to blow it up--

1210
01:28:02,583 --> 01:28:04,416
Raven 4.

1211
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,750
Abort!

1212
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:06,916
Aborting mission.

1213
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:25,416
God, you're a genius!

1214
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:29,166
Whoo! We did it!

1215
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:00,833
Oh no… This is wrong.

1216
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:02,416
What?

1217
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,958
But the plan, Nora, it worked.
It's really working.

1218
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:07,833
No. He won't survive this.

1219
01:29:07,916 --> 01:29:09,125
Wasn't that the plan?

1220
01:29:15,791 --> 01:29:16,708
It's not right.

1221
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:17,750
Nora?

1222
01:29:19,541 --> 01:29:20,750
Nora, stop!

1223
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,375
Get back!

1224
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:43,666
Stop them!

1225
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:44,625
Stop!

1226
01:29:45,958 --> 01:29:47,083
You have to go!

1227
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:50,750
Please, just get away from here!

1228
01:29:50,833 --> 01:29:52,583
Amir.

1229
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:53,708
Stand down.

1230
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:55,291
Yes, sir.

1231
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:00,208
Go!

1232
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:02,791
Go back to the mountains!

1233
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,500
Please!

1234
01:30:06,416 --> 01:30:08,083
Go where you're safe!

1235
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:17,375
They'll leave you alone if you just go!

1236
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:15,125
No more Norway Cup here, that's for sure.

1237
01:32:20,166 --> 01:32:21,541
Oh.

1238
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:26,291
-Brother.
-Brother.

1239
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:41,208
What do we call it?

1240
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:44,583
"Dovre Boulder"?

1241
01:32:49,791 --> 01:32:51,666
"Tidemann Hill"?

1242
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:55,208
Maybe "Troll Rock"?

1243
01:32:58,875 --> 01:33:00,458
"Tobias Boulder".

1244
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:03,083
That's nice.

1245
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:39,291
You look good with a black eye.

1246
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:40,375
Huh?

1247
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:44,375
Professor Tidemann.

1248
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:48,666
I don't know what to say.

1249
01:33:59,541 --> 01:34:02,708
Prime Minister, before I go,
I want to be clear, when I resigned,

1250
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:06,375
I didn't mean with work altogether,
but just that I'm quitting this job.

1251
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:12,041
Berit, I'm gonna be a writer!

1252
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:16,833
Mm-hm.

1253
01:34:22,666 --> 01:34:24,458
Do you think there are more out there?

1254
01:34:24,958 --> 01:34:27,333
In a cave deep beneath some mountain?
