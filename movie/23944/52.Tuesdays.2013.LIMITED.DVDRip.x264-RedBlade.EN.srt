1
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,324
Once upon a time, I had a mum
who told me everything.

2
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:46,537
You know, I knew about
her lovers and her break-ups.

3
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:49,290
We'd go to these parties

4
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,417
and I'd notice strangers
who were flirting with her

5
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:53,211
and... you know, I'd watch.

6
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:55,004
I'd watch her life
from under tables

7
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:57,548
and I'd listen in
from my bed and...

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,510
You know, we used to cuddle up

9
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,679
and she'd tell me her thoughts
about the world.

10
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,938
In my family,
we made decisions together.

11
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,902
I felt like an adult.

12
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,453
<i>No fucking way.</i>

13
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:53,081
- Dad, Mum's is left.
- Right, strap your helmet on.

14
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:57,460
Can you imagine, just you and me
living together all the time?

15
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,754
- Like, for how long?
- I'm not gonna answer anything

16
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:02,256
until you put your helmet on
properly, yeah?

17
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:05,551
- I want to tell her something.
- What?

18
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,428
Private.

19
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:09,472
- Between me and Mum.
- Ah.

20
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:14,185
- When did you decide this?
- I didn't decide any of this.

21
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:16,604
She was supposed
to tell you herself.

22
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:35,164
Mum?

23
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,335
- Mum?
- Wait one.

24
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,590
- Hang on, honey.
- Hey.

25
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,635
Tom's been telling
the biggest bunch of lies.

26
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:49,512
What do you mean?

27
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:52,849
He said that I'm gonna
live with him full-time now.

28
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:55,184
I mean, I love Dad and all,

29
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:57,270
but can you imagine,
even for a little while?

30
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,773
Also, I've got something

31
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,650
I really want to tell you.

32
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:06,613
Mum.

33
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,034
Mum, open the door.

34
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:14,746
Mum!

35
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:32,764
I can give you some pamphlets
and books if you like.

36
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:34,307
It'll set out the steps.

37
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:36,643
Um, I'll take hormones,
take a male name...

38
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,854
Have you seen my cardigan?
That new one?

39
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:42,398
- She's not listening.
- No, I get it.

40
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:44,859
You feel like a man.
You want to become a man.

41
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:46,944
You need a little space.

42
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:48,905
Look, you don't have to leave
right now.

43
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:51,783
- Can we sit and talk about it?
- I get it, Mum. It's OK.

44
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:55,536
Have you washed it?

45
00:04:55,536 --> 00:04:57,163
- I don't know.
- Harry!

46
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,876
Harry?

47
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,131
Have you seen my red cardie?

48
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:10,093
<i>Hey.</i>

49
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,684
- Cold.
- Give it to me.

50
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,478
You can fuck off...

51
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:27,986
Warmer now.

52
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:32,824
Has she told you yet?

53
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:35,326
<i>You knew?</i>

54
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:41,291
Everyone knew except me.

55
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,377
My sister should just get
a fucking strap-on.

56
00:05:46,296 --> 00:05:48,840
Get a fucking strap-on, woman!

57
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:02,812
Oh, get off.
We need to talk to Billie.

58
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:05,690
Until your mum grows
a bit more hair on her chest...

59
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,110
...she doesn't want you around.

60
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,487
Yeah, exactly what we need.

61
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:15,116
Shipping you off
to chef man here.

62
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:18,286
Yeah, and you work late.
You're never home.

63
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:21,789
- I'll make it work.
- For how long?

64
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:29,172
Yeah, for how long, brother'?

65
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:32,425
Well, top surgery can
happen in about nine months,

66
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,052
maybe longer.

67
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:36,721
Full effects of testosterone
can take years.

68
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:40,224
- It's a long process.
- How long?

69
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:43,102
<i>- With your dad?
- Yeah.</i>

70
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:48,900
A year.

71
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,945
I was thinking a year.

72
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:01,412
My mum always used to tell me

73
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:04,123
how much of a drag it was
to breastfeed me.

74
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:09,754
You know,
I was a hungry child and I bit.

75
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:14,842
But she'd always tell me
that she never loved anyone

76
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:17,887
or anything in her life
more than she did then.

77
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:22,433
I loved my mum.

78
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:25,561
I wanted my mum to be happy.

79
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,209
You're not kicking Harry out,
are you?

80
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,961
- He's an adult.
- He's an idiot.

81
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:53,089
I just need my life
to be simple right now, Bill.

82
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:59,595
I'm not sure
I can finish this now.

83
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:02,223
I'll have it ready for you
next time you come around, OK?

84
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,768
Next time I come around?

85
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,190
A year.

86
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:17,905
Look. How about we make
a promise to each other?

87
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:20,575
How about every week
we set aside some time

88
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:23,411
to be with each other,
just you and me?

89
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:27,582
You could come over after school
and we'll drop everything

90
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:30,335
and it'll be our time together.

91
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:32,587
How does that sound'?

92
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:34,672
Every week?

93
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:37,383
Same time, every week,
without fail.

94
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,136
Every Tuesday?

95
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,182
Do you promise?

96
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:47,226
I promise.

97
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:55,777
There are just so many things
that I should have said.

98
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:59,155
There were so many things that
I just wasn't clear about and...

99
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:05,787
These are all the things that
I should have said before now.

100
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:19,384
So at the moment,
because it's under Medicare,

101
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:21,719
prior to surgery being approved,

102
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:25,390
something called Real Life
Experience is required.

103
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,184
Do you know about
Real Life Experience, Billie?

104
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:30,770
Yeah, I've told her about RLE.

105
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,064
Good.
So you must understand

106
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:34,774
that before we can
prescribe hormones,

107
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,235
your mum must continue
to come to us for assessment.

108
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:39,445
Second session now.

109
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,197
I think this whole process

110
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:42,991
should take about
two or three months.

111
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:45,994
Then after about six months,
we can look at surgery.

112
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:49,747
Female-to-male
chest reconstruction surgery.

113
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:53,251
Hysterectomy can follow,
if that's what you want.

114
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:55,086
What's a hysterectomy?

115
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:58,256
It's where they take
the uterus out.

116
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:00,717
Now, I understand
you've taken a male name.

117
00:10:00,717 --> 00:10:04,053
What do you think about
your mum's new name, Billie?

118
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:07,515
James is a lovely name.
Hello, James.

119
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:09,892
<i>Um, hello.</i>

120
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,398
<i>Thanks.</i>

121
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:20,903
So, do I call you Dad now

122
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:24,616
Um... whatever you're
comfortable with, I suppose.

123
00:10:29,787 --> 00:10:32,081
Dad.

124
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:35,293
When will I see you next, Dad?

125
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:39,631
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

126
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:40,882
Dad.

127
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:45,178
Next week, same time.

128
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,555
Eat with your chopsticks, honey,
not with your fingers.

129
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:50,433
It tastes better... Dad.

130
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:54,646
It's rude... Billie.

131
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:03,196
- Ow, that hurt.
- It did not. Eat properly.

132
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:16,960
<i>Mum? Harry?</i>

133
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:20,004
Uncle Harry?

134
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,124
You know, you shouldn't
be missing school because of me.

135
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,168
It's not the point.

136
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:42,086
I just thought
we could hang out.

137
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,963
Yeah, well,
I've got appointments before,

138
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,673
and then after I've got to work.

139
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,016
Nice sideburns.

140
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:00,438
Look, I can't keep having
the school call,

141
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:03,024
saying you're skipping out.

142
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:05,902
I thought we'd have
more time together.

143
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:09,447
Let's just stick to
an agreed time. Four till ten?

144
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:11,991
Sure. Four till ten.

145
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:14,410
You promise?

146
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:20,583
- Just promise, will you?
- OK, OK, I promise.

147
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:23,795
And stay out of my stuff.

148
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,128
What?

149
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:08,548
What are you eating so fast for?

150
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,551
What do you do
on the other nights?

151
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,804
Not much. I work.

152
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:16,472
Do you go out?

153
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:18,182
Nah, not yet.

154
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:21,644
You will.

155
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:33,239
<i>Jesus.</i>

156
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,617
This house is so fucking cold.

157
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:45,376
Got another exciting night
planned together?

158
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:08,441
I'll take back
what you don't want.

159
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,318
Dad won't even know
what's missing.

160
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:13,738
Frida!
How long are you here for?

161
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:15,740
- Dad?
- Just for tonight, remember?

162
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,575
And then it's back to Mum's
tomorrow.

163
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:21,079
Back to Mum's tomorrow.
I get to sleep in your bed.

164
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:23,665
What's this?

165
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,670
scissors,
wool crepe, spirit gum,

166
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,630
pencil eyeliner, mascara?"

167
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,131
It'll be fun.

168
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,929
And then he turns around
and goes "Salt-water thief!"

169
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:40,181
"You, sir,
are a notable pirate!"

170
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:42,100
And then the other one comes in
and he goes,

171
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,060
"Don't call me names, sir!"

172
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,698
Adam's Apple.

173
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:03,830
- You're still into women, yeah?
- - Yeah, of course.

174
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,791
If you're with them, are they
a lesbian or are they straight?

175
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:13,673
I don't want
to be with anyone yet.

176
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,718
- When, then?
- When I'm a man.

177
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:20,221
I thought you were a man now.

178
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:40,408
- Didn't you have any dinner?
- Nah.

179
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:03,014
<i>, HEY-
. H8'!-</i>

180
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,609
...because of
the vacuum and stuff,

181
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:17,862
but it feels kind of peaceful.

182
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,406
There's a great view, too.

183
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,241
Hey, I've lost weight.

184
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,744
- Really?
- Yeah, really, really.

185
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:30,166
I was checking out
binders the other day because,

186
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,168
well, I thought mine
had stretched out.

187
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:34,921
Now it looks like
I've just lost weight.

188
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:31,269
Sorry.

189
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:34,731
Have you told anyone?

190
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,650
Nuh-uh.

191
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,278
No one. I haven't told anyone.

192
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:41,654
Good.

193
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,823
I don't even know your names,
so...

194
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:52,540
Josh.

195
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:06,095
- Jasmin.
- Josh and Jasmin?

196
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,058
Josh and Jasmin.
Jasmin and Josh.

197
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:11,893
Fuck off, then.

198
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:15,146
Oh, no, no.
I was thinking about my mum.

199
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:18,232
Uh, my mum's name
starts with a J,

200
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:19,859
and so when I was growing up,

201
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,862
I always wanted my name
to start with a J.

202
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:26,115
It just feels like a better way
to start a name,

203
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:29,744
with a J rather than a B.
Uh, Billie.

204
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:34,707
You know, growing up, the only
Billies I knew were pet dogs.

205
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:41,798
So you wanna play a game?

206
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:45,093
- Sure.
- Yeah.

207
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:49,389
I'm so, so sorry.
I completely lost track of time.

208
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,808
<i>We OK, honey,
don't worry about it.</i>

209
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:55,228
<i>- No, I'm so sow.
- What were you doing?</i>

210
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:58,147
I'm on my way now.
I'll be, like, 3O minutes.

211
00:19:58,147 --> 00:19:59,899
<i>Look, by the time you get here,</i>

212
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,651
<i>we'll only have a couple of
hours together</i>

213
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,695
<i>and then H! have to
drive you home.</i>

214
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:05,822
<i>Just go straight to Tom's.</i>

215
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:09,117
Really?
I'm literally on my way now.

216
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:12,287
<i>It's OK, hon. If I go to work
early, I'll finish early.</i>

217
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:14,998
<i>- It'll be good.
- Are you sure?</i>

218
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:19,210
<i>Yeah. It'll be good to have
an early night for once.</i>

219
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,378
OK.

220
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:24,382
Well, I'll see you next week?

221
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:26,592
<i>H! see you then. Love you.</i>

222
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:31,681
Love you too. I'm so sorry.

223
00:20:49,324 --> 00:20:50,992
Can't you just hit it to me?

224
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:53,328
What, you don't want
to play properly?

225
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:54,996
This is supposed to be fun,

226
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:57,415
and instead you're just
making fun of me.

227
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:59,417
Making me run
all over the fucking court.

228
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,586
I'm trying to say something.

229
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:06,591
You never fucking listen to me.

230
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,388
Is this about last week?

231
00:21:15,183 --> 00:21:17,644
You were the one who was late.

232
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:20,438
I just thought it would be
easier if we just skipped it.

233
00:21:20,438 --> 00:21:23,441
And I'm just saying
that I'm really sorry

234
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:27,403
and I never want to miss
hanging out with you. Never.

235
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:34,369
OK, well, let's just make sure
we never miss out again.

236
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:36,663
OK, exactly.

237
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,289
Let's just make sure.

238
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:40,667
- OK, let's.
- Good.

239
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,795
Now, do you want to play
or what?

240
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:45,380
Yes.

241
00:21:56,057 --> 00:21:58,184
- Hey, open your mouth.
- Why?

242
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:01,145
Just open your mouth. Wider.

243
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:06,025
I've got spit all over my mouth.

244
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:10,655
- That's disgusting.
- Mm. Now the other side.

245
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:13,032
What does it taste like?

246
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,201
Minty fresh.

247
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:18,413
No, I mean...
what does he taste like?

248
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:21,291
Well, why don't you try'?

249
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:24,544
OK.

250
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,593
Oh, shit, I've gotta go.

251
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,471
- What, really?
- Yeah.

252
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:36,514
No, you don't.

253
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:38,975
Yes, I do.

254
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,979
You know this
is the last time we have here'?

255
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:44,355
What do you mean?

256
00:22:44,355 --> 00:22:47,942
Well, cos it's the play
this weekend

257
00:22:47,942 --> 00:22:51,696
and then us year elevens
go on holiday next week.

258
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:54,240
What, so we can't
come here anymore?

259
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,826
- No more rehearsals.
- That was the whole point.

260
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,165
I really have to go.

261
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,547
Your loss.

262
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,372
- Hi.
- Hey.

263
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:45,333
You have to get back?

264
00:23:47,168 --> 00:23:49,128
I could stay forever.

265
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:10,358
No. I mean, I can't
believe it at this point.

266
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,739
Lunch time hook-ups,
pleasuring a beautiful woman.

267
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:19,993
Maybe I could pleasure you
some time.

268
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:22,453
I'm taking all the pleasure.

269
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:25,873
But it is my pleasure.

270
00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:27,333
Charmer.

271
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:37,510
You're just a lovely surprise,
that's all.

272
00:25:00,825 --> 00:25:02,535
Hi.

273
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,288
Hey. I'll be out in a tick.

274
00:25:05,288 --> 00:25:06,664
OK.

275
00:25:12,337 --> 00:25:13,963
OK, look at this.

276
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:16,674
So, whenever I meet
another person

277
00:25:16,674 --> 00:25:19,510
with a transgender parent,

278
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,265
uh... one of the things
that we often talk about is...

279
00:25:25,516 --> 00:25:29,354
...the amazing gift of knowing

280
00:25:29,354 --> 00:25:33,024
that our parent has chosen
to live an authentic life.

281
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,985
What do you think about that?

282
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:40,865
You know,
what is an authentic life?

283
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:45,703
Is this an authentic life?

284
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,265
Oh, cool!
Your first testosterone shot!

285
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,434
- Yep, this morning.
- Awesome.

286
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:12,438
- About fucking time.
- Champagne.

287
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,482
So the doctor said
everything was fine, then?

288
00:26:14,482 --> 00:26:16,401
Well, I mean, obviously.

289
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:19,529
Yep. I passed all the tests,
so to speak.

290
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:21,823
It's really happening.
I'm on the T.

291
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:24,117
- Here's to bigger clits.
- Harry.

292
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:27,036
It's OK, sweetheart. Nothing
could spoil my mood tonight.

293
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:29,414
<i>So...
Fuck you.</i>

294
00:26:31,374 --> 00:26:33,543
Hey, Harry,
can you drive me home tonight?

295
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:39,382
You have dinner
and you hang out...

296
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:42,677
...and then you leave your house
and go to your other house.

297
00:26:42,677 --> 00:26:43,928
Yep.

298
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,308
This is ridiculous.

299
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:50,560
It's just fucking ridiculous.

300
00:26:52,145 --> 00:26:54,188
What time are you supposed to
leave Jane's...

301
00:26:54,188 --> 00:26:56,316
Fucking James's anyway?

302
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:58,109
Ten.

303
00:26:58,109 --> 00:26:59,652
We're already late.

304
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:04,282
It's OK. I told Dad 12.

305
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:22,216
Things might start
happening straight away.

306
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:24,052
<i>Like what?</i>

307
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:28,723
Um, my muscle mass
will increase and...

308
00:27:28,723 --> 00:27:32,852
Oh, my hair is gonna get
coarser and grow more.

309
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:35,063
Even facial hair?

310
00:27:35,063 --> 00:27:38,066
Um,
that'll probably take longer.

311
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:43,071
Just keep an eye out because
I could even start going bald.

312
00:27:43,071 --> 00:27:46,741
- Is that good?
- What do you mean?

313
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:50,370
Well, if you go bald,
it'll mean it's working, right?

314
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,372
I mean, only men go bald,

315
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:55,583
so if you go bald,
is that gonna make you happy?

316
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:57,919
If I start seeing that,
should I mention it'?

317
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,588
I mean, do you want me to only
mention the good things or...

318
00:28:00,588 --> 00:28:05,343
Um, how about, if you see it,
you just let me know, OK'?

319
00:28:07,762 --> 00:28:11,015
<i>Uh, this is my voice
on testosterone.</i>

320
00:28:11,015 --> 00:28:14,352
Um... One week.

321
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:18,773
Hey, I got some pictures
of some guys off the net too,

322
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:21,776
and these are guys that,
like me,

323
00:28:21,776 --> 00:28:24,028
were born biologically female,

324
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:27,031
but they've taken testosterone
so...

325
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:30,451
What, is that all from
just taking testosterone?

326
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:31,494
Yep.

327
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:34,372
<i>My gosh</i>

328
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,417
You wouldn't even know.

329
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:40,211
No.

330
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,214
It's good, huh?

331
00:28:47,844 --> 00:28:49,512
It's this one here.

332
00:28:54,684 --> 00:28:56,603
OK, now start walking forward.

333
00:28:56,644 --> 00:28:59,314
Harry.
Harry, can I just open my eyes?

334
00:28:59,314 --> 00:29:00,940
<i>No.</i>

335
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:08,448
OK, now open your eyes.

336
00:29:08,448 --> 00:29:10,450
Oh, my God.

337
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:15,997
Don't burn the place down
and don't go on the roof. OK?

338
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:23,379
What the fuck is this, anyway?

339
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,799
Boozing with buds or something?

340
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,968
No.

341
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:31,721
Well, what, then?

342
00:29:31,721 --> 00:29:35,558
<i>You're having
an E party? You're doing crack.</i>

343
00:29:37,101 --> 00:29:38,603
<i>Do you want me
to get you anything?</i>

344
00:29:38,603 --> 00:29:40,647
<i>I don't need anything.</i>

345
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:41,940
What is this?

346
00:29:43,483 --> 00:29:45,026
It's just friends from school

347
00:29:45,026 --> 00:29:47,654
and we just need
somewhere to hang out.

348
00:29:47,654 --> 00:29:52,909
Huh. You want me
to drop you off each Tuesday?

349
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:54,494
Yeah?

350
00:29:58,206 --> 00:29:59,374
Yes.

351
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,794
Please.

352
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:04,379
That'd be good.

353
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:08,424
It'll be our little secret.

354
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,897
Do you notice anything?

355
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:24,274
Mm...

356
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,777
I don't know is...

357
00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:30,363
Is it meant to have changed
in a week?

358
00:30:30,363 --> 00:30:31,781
I don't know.

359
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:44,544
<i>- Here?
- Yep.</i>

360
00:30:44,544 --> 00:30:47,005
Yeah, just in front
of the camera.

361
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:49,215
OK. And you can sit down in it.

362
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:54,846
Josh, come too.

363
00:30:54,846 --> 00:30:58,599
<i>No, Josh can go after.</i>

364
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,143
Just you first.

365
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,735
What are you going to ask me?

366
00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:18,870
Are you guys together,
like boyfriend and girlfriend?

367
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,246
Mm, no.

368
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:23,124
It's quite intoxicating, really.

369
00:31:23,124 --> 00:31:25,585
<i>So are you a man new</i>

370
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:26,961
I'm nearly a man.

371
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:29,047
It wasn't that stupid, you know,

372
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:34,260
the idea of rose petals on a
bed, listening to Barry White.

373
00:31:34,344 --> 00:31:35,887
It wasn't that.

374
00:31:35,887 --> 00:31:37,597
<i>Was it good?</i>

375
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:42,393
Yeah.

376
00:31:42,393 --> 00:31:45,313
No. No, no, it wasn't, actually.

377
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,779
That one.

378
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,489
<i>What noise do you make?</i>

379
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:02,413
Good quality clothes.
I've got a beard.

380
00:32:02,413 --> 00:32:05,041
I walk with, you know, intent.

381
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:08,252
You're a man.
It's like, you're smooth, man.

382
00:32:08,252 --> 00:32:10,922
OK, have you ever
gone down on a girl?

383
00:32:10,922 --> 00:32:12,840
- Yeah.
- What did it taste like?

384
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,885
- Tangy.
- Good?

385
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:17,887
- Tangy.
- Bad.

386
00:32:17,887 --> 00:32:20,682
<i>- Tangy. Just...</i>

387
00:32:23,226 --> 00:32:25,311
Do you like
that I'm filming you?

388
00:32:27,772 --> 00:32:29,524
I don't mind it.

389
00:32:29,524 --> 00:32:31,609
<i>What do you think this is?</i>

390
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:35,196
I think this is...
I think this is interesting.

391
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:40,034
The thing is,
I see myself every day

392
00:32:40,034 --> 00:32:43,329
so I'm not sure if I'll notice.

393
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:45,540
is your voice a bit deeper?

394
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:51,754
I've started shaving.

395
00:32:51,754 --> 00:32:53,881
<i>- Your face?
- Yeah.</i>

396
00:32:53,881 --> 00:32:56,301
Shaving it to make the hairs
grow thicker.

397
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:59,137
Oh. Is it working?

398
00:32:59,137 --> 00:33:02,056
Well, I mean, I can only feel
like nudey-bum, but...

399
00:33:02,056 --> 00:33:04,767
Ding-ding. Time.

400
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,185
Hey, hang on.

401
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:09,355
- See ya.
- See ya.

402
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:21,868
Are you more like
your mum or your dad?

403
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:26,414
I don't know my dad, so...
And I never want to be my mum.

404
00:33:26,414 --> 00:33:29,667
OK, Jas, take your top off.

405
00:33:38,134 --> 00:33:39,510
Lips.

406
00:33:40,637 --> 00:33:43,264
Don't hover. You can kiss them.

407
00:33:48,478 --> 00:33:50,980
Ah, don't lick them.

408
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,816
But you can bite, like a nibble.

409
00:33:56,694 --> 00:33:58,112
<i>Breasts.</i>

410
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:03,534
You can't tweak
or jiggle them, or suck on them.

411
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:04,994
But you can cup them.

412
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:08,164
And you can cum on them.

413
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:29,560
<i>Now Pm going to
have to start again.</i>

414
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,728
<i>Huh'?</i>

415
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:34,857
<i>I show that to my kid, remember?</i>

416
00:34:34,857 --> 00:34:36,192
<i>We met your brother.</i>

417
00:34:36,192 --> 00:34:38,987
<i>Yeah, I know. He fives with me.</i>

418
00:34:38,987 --> 00:34:41,864
<i>But you haven't told
your daughter about me?</i>

419
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,618
<i>No.</i>

420
00:34:45,618 --> 00:34:48,079
<i>Well, now's a good time
to introduce me.</i>

421
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:54,127
<i>- Hi, Billie. My name's Lisa.
- Oh, fuck!</i>

422
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:57,839
<i>Pm fucking...
fucking your mother!</i>

423
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:06,264
<i>You um tanned 'Ms week.</i>

424
00:35:08,516 --> 00:35:10,184
What, you can't see that?

425
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:13,271
No.

426
00:35:18,693 --> 00:35:21,279
But you look older.

427
00:35:28,286 --> 00:35:32,123
Josh, what does it
feel like to be inside a girl?

428
00:35:32,123 --> 00:35:35,418
- Do you hear something?
- Answer the question.

429
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:37,587
There it is again.
I swear I heard something.

430
00:35:37,587 --> 00:35:40,340
- Ha-ha.
- Like a high-pitched squeal?

431
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:45,178
- Like a slug being baked.
- Fuck you, then.

432
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:48,973
Maybe if the slug came a little
closer, we'd be able to hear it.

433
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:51,142
<i>What does it feel like?</i>

434
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,700
I don't know.

435
00:36:08,993 --> 00:36:10,495
Like a warm loaf of bread.

436
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:51,369
<i>Wake up.</i>

437
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:55,957
Merry Christmas,
my beautiful pumpkin.

438
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,754
Merry Christmas.

439
00:37:01,754 --> 00:37:03,881
How was it'?

440
00:37:03,881 --> 00:37:06,551
<i>- We didn't go.</i>

441
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:08,428
We stayed home.

442
00:37:11,472 --> 00:37:15,143
My folks are not pleased
about their new 38-year-old son.

443
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:17,687
No, they are not.

444
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:20,398
Lose a daughter, gain a son.

445
00:37:20,398 --> 00:37:22,775
It's like James
got married to himself.

446
00:37:28,865 --> 00:37:31,326
Your mum should never have said
anything to them, though,

447
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:33,369
that's the thing.

448
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:36,414
I mean, he just looks like
a dyke at the moment anyway,

449
00:37:36,414 --> 00:37:38,916
and it took them long enough
to accept that.

450
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:40,335
The fuckers.

451
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:45,089
Hey. Hey, you got to wake up.

452
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:48,926
You stink of smoke.

453
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,264
I think I smell like pussy.

454
00:37:57,268 --> 00:37:59,437
Billie...

455
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:01,522
Billie, you've got to wake up.

456
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:04,359
Billie...

457
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:08,947
I'm not so sure
I can take you tonight.

458
00:38:10,573 --> 00:38:13,993
Billie, because, um...

459
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:15,995
lam...

460
00:38:15,995 --> 00:38:21,626
lam very high...
and I will continue to be so.

461
00:38:25,797 --> 00:38:27,215
Billie.

462
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,594
I'll tell James
about your secret.

463
00:38:34,013 --> 00:38:36,224
OK. OK, OK, OK.

464
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:37,809
OK, I'm up.

465
00:38:38,977 --> 00:38:41,271
I'm up, I'm awake.

466
00:38:42,563 --> 00:38:44,649
- What?
- Um...

467
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:49,821
So, I've played
in every position, right?

468
00:38:49,821 --> 00:38:52,490
I've batted, I bowled,
I fielded,

469
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,159
I batted for the other team.

470
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,245
I always knew what I wanted.

471
00:38:57,245 --> 00:39:00,456
Not like your mum, you know,
and...

472
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:03,251
And, Billie, that's the thing.

473
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:05,878
I've got to tell you something
that's really important.

474
00:39:07,547 --> 00:39:09,674
What?

475
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:12,302
<i>Don't be like your mum.</i>

476
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:18,850
Because you... because you
look up to her so much.

477
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,352
And you can't be like your mum.

478
00:39:22,895 --> 00:39:26,274
- Like a man?
- Oh, no.

479
00:39:27,817 --> 00:39:29,736
Jesus,
you're retarded sometimes.

480
00:39:29,736 --> 00:39:33,323
I mean... unless you want to be.

481
00:39:35,116 --> 00:39:37,035
I don't know.

482
00:39:37,035 --> 00:39:39,203
How would I know?

483
00:39:39,203 --> 00:39:43,124
Just don't take
so fucking long to find out.

484
00:39:43,124 --> 00:39:44,876
You don't have to wait
for inspiration.

485
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:46,836
You're not fucking Rembrandt.

486
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:51,007
You take your clothes off and
you roll around in the paint.

487
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:52,508
Promise.

488
00:39:54,302 --> 00:39:56,804
OK, OK, OK.

489
00:39:56,804 --> 00:39:59,098
OK, OK, yes.

490
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:04,562
Now, Harry, you just...
just go and let me sleep.

491
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:08,733
OK.

492
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:21,079
<i>Hey, chef man!</i>

493
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:23,831
Happy Christmas, motherfucker!

494
00:40:32,882 --> 00:40:34,550
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

495
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,678
- Ready to go?
- Yep.

496
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:39,305
- See ya.
- See ya.

497
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:45,895
Merry Christmas, Billie.

498
00:40:45,895 --> 00:40:48,231
Merry Christmas, Mum.

499
00:40:48,231 --> 00:40:50,358
- See ya.
- See ya, babe.

500
00:40:57,115 --> 00:41:01,327
Dinner parties
and Christmas crackers...

501
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:07,709
<i>♪ Stupid family
Christmas time...</i>

502
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:19,387
Christmas sucks balls.

503
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:40,199
So, I can bite them,
but I can't lick them?

504
00:41:42,076 --> 00:41:44,454
And I can't hover over them?

505
00:41:44,454 --> 00:41:46,122
That's what I said.

506
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,292
Look, I'm sorry, OK?

507
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:34,087
Why? It's not your fault.

508
00:42:34,087 --> 00:42:37,131
Well, then what?
You're so grumpy today.

509
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,844
It's just a testosterone thing.

510
00:42:41,844 --> 00:42:43,388
What? Being fucking grumpy?

511
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:47,558
No.
There are just complications.

512
00:42:49,143 --> 00:42:50,520
Like what?

513
00:42:51,854 --> 00:42:53,606
Like... like this.

514
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:57,652
Like this.

515
00:42:58,903 --> 00:43:00,530
That's what.

516
00:43:03,866 --> 00:43:07,078
Hey. Hurry up with your
secret ladies' business.

517
00:43:09,622 --> 00:43:12,667
I'm waiting on some test results
so we just have to wait and see.

518
00:43:52,123 --> 00:43:53,833
What's wrong?

519
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:56,836
<i>Jesus, good morning to you, too.</i>

520
00:43:56,836 --> 00:44:01,382
Well, you never call,
and you knew I'd be sleeping...

521
00:44:01,382 --> 00:44:02,884
So, what's up?

522
00:44:11,351 --> 00:44:13,353
James?

523
00:44:13,353 --> 00:44:15,647
I've had to stop testosterone.

524
00:44:15,647 --> 00:44:18,900
<i>It's got something to do with</i>

525
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,319
over-production
of liver enzymes.

526
00:44:23,696 --> 00:44:26,324
Well, you saw me.

527
00:44:26,324 --> 00:44:29,285
So, are you gonna stop
the treatments for good?

528
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:32,997
It's...

529
00:44:32,997 --> 00:44:37,335
Apparently it's fucking rare,
but there K/e been other cases.

530
00:44:37,335 --> 00:44:39,587
If I'd stayed on T,
I would've died.

531
00:44:41,756 --> 00:44:44,884
I'm so sorry, J.

532
00:44:51,975 --> 00:44:53,643
I don't know how to tell Billie.

533
00:44:53,643 --> 00:44:55,353
<i>Jesus.</i>

534
00:44:55,353 --> 00:44:57,814
Do you know,
that was my first thought.

535
00:44:57,814 --> 00:44:59,816
How the fuck
am I gonna tell her'?

536
00:44:59,816 --> 00:45:03,486
She's gonna want
to move back in with you.

537
00:45:03,486 --> 00:45:04,946
<i>You know that, right'?</i>

538
00:45:04,946 --> 00:45:07,657
I can't... I can't do it yet.
Please.

539
00:45:11,828 --> 00:45:13,705
<i>I just need time to think.</i>

540
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:19,502
Tom?

541
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:25,425
I await your decision.

542
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:35,018
You should go to another doctor.
You can't just trust one doctor.

543
00:45:35,018 --> 00:45:39,272
There has to be other ways.
Right?

544
00:45:39,272 --> 00:45:40,773
No.

545
00:45:44,152 --> 00:45:45,445
I don't know.

546
00:45:47,905 --> 00:45:49,616
So, what now

547
00:45:53,578 --> 00:45:56,789
Look, I know this has been hard.
For all of us.

548
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:00,251
L...

549
00:46:01,794 --> 00:46:04,464
I still need time
to work it out.

550
00:46:06,215 --> 00:46:07,925
I think we should stick to...

551
00:46:07,925 --> 00:46:10,762
Well, I'd like stick to
our Tuesdays.

552
00:46:20,438 --> 00:46:23,650
I was always praised
for my sophistication,

553
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,362
my maturity,
my ability to adapt.

554
00:46:28,571 --> 00:46:30,406
But it was never true.

555
00:46:32,033 --> 00:46:34,619
You just have no choice, do you?

556
00:46:56,474 --> 00:46:57,850
Hey-

557
00:47:00,478 --> 00:47:02,647
Do you want me
to make dinner tonight?

558
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,540
It's time to get up!

559
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,167
Get up! Get out of bed!

560
00:47:25,628 --> 00:47:27,714
Hula-hoop time!

561
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:31,759
Hula-hoop crime!

562
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:34,262
Hula-hoop time...

563
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,021
<i>, HEY-
. H8'!-</i>

564
00:47:46,399 --> 00:47:49,193
is everything OK?

565
00:47:49,193 --> 00:47:50,778
Yeah.

566
00:48:23,353 --> 00:48:24,395
<i>Mum?</i>

567
00:48:26,773 --> 00:48:28,316
Mum?

568
00:48:34,822 --> 00:48:37,909
What the fuck, Mum?
Where were you?

569
00:49:14,946 --> 00:49:18,157
<i>Let's go, Bill. School.</i>

570
00:49:33,464 --> 00:49:34,966
Beautiful day.

571
00:49:36,634 --> 00:49:37,927
Yeah.

572
00:49:47,186 --> 00:49:48,229
Well?

573
00:49:56,112 --> 00:49:57,280
OK, watch this.

574
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,619
<i>We are currently on
our mission down</i>

575
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:06,247
<i>to the Pine Island Glacier
in West Antarctica.</i>

576
00:50:06,247 --> 00:50:08,249
<i>When looking out of the window
of the aircraft,</i>

577
00:50:08,249 --> 00:50:12,545
<i>we notice a fairly large crack
in the ice shelf.</i>

578
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,842
These things happen
on a semi-regular basis

579
00:50:17,842 --> 00:50:19,469
in both the Arctic
and the Antarctic,

580
00:50:19,469 --> 00:50:21,429
but it's still
a fairly large event.

581
00:50:21,429 --> 00:50:23,264
So we wanted to make sure

582
00:50:23,264 --> 00:50:27,226
we capture as much of
that process as we could.

583
00:50:27,226 --> 00:50:29,395
<i>So much stuff happens in a year.</i>

584
00:50:29,395 --> 00:50:31,439
<i>You know, the earth...</i>

585
00:50:33,107 --> 00:50:35,068
And there was...

586
00:50:35,068 --> 00:50:39,864
<i>There was civil wars
in Syria and Libya, and...</i>

587
00:50:39,864 --> 00:50:43,993
<i>And in Antarctica, a glacier
the size of New York split off.</i>

588
00:50:43,993 --> 00:50:48,831
<i>Or maybe it didn't split off
Fuck.</i>

589
00:50:48,831 --> 00:50:51,209
I can't remember
whose party it was,

590
00:50:51,209 --> 00:50:54,003
but we were against the door,
cos there was no look,

591
00:50:54,003 --> 00:50:56,506
and he pulled my pants down
straight away.

592
00:50:56,506 --> 00:50:58,675
Can I do it?

593
00:50:58,675 --> 00:50:59,968
No.

594
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,353
- Like that?
- A little rougher.

595
00:51:10,353 --> 00:51:13,064
Like you want to show me
how much you want me.

596
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:21,030
Come on, guys.
When can I have a go?

597
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,866
Josh, just wait a sec.

598
00:51:23,866 --> 00:51:25,618
Maybe cos it was Valentine's Day

599
00:51:25,618 --> 00:51:28,121
and his girlfriend
was in the other room.

600
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:30,957
He wanted to do it
pretty quickly.

601
00:51:30,957 --> 00:51:36,129
Sol let him, you know,
put it in me straight away.

602
00:51:36,796 --> 00:51:38,131
Here... grab my leg.

603
00:51:41,634 --> 00:51:44,304
Just put your fingers here.

604
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:46,931
Come on, guys.
I'm dying over here.

605
00:51:46,931 --> 00:51:48,308
Is that right?

606
00:51:49,684 --> 00:51:51,978
He kept on turning his head away
from me.

607
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:54,397
I forced it back
and got him to kiss me.

608
00:52:02,488 --> 00:52:04,449
<i>OK, let's go.</i>

609
00:52:04,449 --> 00:52:06,618
No, hang on, I'll do this.

610
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:08,202
OK, and go.

611
00:52:15,335 --> 00:52:18,212
- You have to do it rough.
- OK.

612
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,968
OK.
Jas, you weren't wearing jeans.

613
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:30,767
- Not easy.
- OK.

614
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:33,061
- OK.
- Right, hold my leg.

615
00:52:33,061 --> 00:52:34,479
- OK, come here.

616
00:53:05,718 --> 00:53:08,304
Billie, what do you think?

617
00:53:08,304 --> 00:53:09,347
Uh...

618
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:12,809
Come on, what do you like?

619
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:16,896
Uh, I... I don't know.

620
00:53:20,149 --> 00:53:22,360
Come on, Billie.

621
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,947
Dude, we told you everything.
You gotta give us something.

622
00:53:28,866 --> 00:53:30,285
Um...

623
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:08,197
So does this mean
you're still transitioning?

624
00:54:08,197 --> 00:54:09,866
Yeah, of course.

625
00:54:11,909 --> 00:54:14,037
I just don't remember
you telling me.

626
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:19,834
Don't worry. It'll happen.
Somehow.

627
00:54:23,504 --> 00:54:25,214
This'll get bigger.

628
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:34,766
Is Harry here?

629
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:38,019
He's never here.

630
00:54:49,197 --> 00:54:52,408
I hit the soap dish with my arse

631
00:54:52,408 --> 00:54:55,161
and broke the soap dish
and fell into the bath,

632
00:54:55,161 --> 00:54:57,538
but when I landed
I also passed out,

633
00:54:57,538 --> 00:54:59,207
but not because I hit my head,

634
00:54:59,207 --> 00:55:01,709
but because I thought
I'd cut my arse.

635
00:55:04,754 --> 00:55:06,506
And then just ride naked?

636
00:55:06,506 --> 00:55:09,676
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
Or dressed like a sperm.

637
00:55:11,511 --> 00:55:13,304
Are you two brother and sister?

638
00:55:13,304 --> 00:55:15,223
<i>She's my niece.</i>

639
00:55:15,223 --> 00:55:17,684
You look like you
could be her brother.

640
00:55:17,684 --> 00:55:19,435
She might as well be my sister.

641
00:55:19,435 --> 00:55:22,063
I mean, I take care of her like
she's my sister.

642
00:55:22,063 --> 00:55:25,692
Make sure my little Billie
doesn't get hurt.

643
00:55:25,692 --> 00:55:27,151
You taking care of my Bill?

644
00:55:28,653 --> 00:55:31,489
Are you using protection?

645
00:55:33,408 --> 00:55:35,243
<i>You're not...</i>

646
00:55:35,243 --> 00:55:38,788
You're not using
your mum's strap-on, are you?

647
00:55:38,788 --> 00:55:40,999
If you are,
I really hope you're washing

648
00:55:40,999 --> 00:55:43,293
that filthy fucking thing.

649
00:55:43,293 --> 00:55:44,919
It's unsanitary.

650
00:55:44,919 --> 00:55:47,630
No... No strap-ens here.

651
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,090
Is your mum a lesbian
or something?

652
00:55:52,176 --> 00:55:54,637
Why are you here, Harry?

653
00:55:54,637 --> 00:55:56,681
So, you just hang out here,
right?

654
00:55:56,681 --> 00:56:01,894
You shoot the shit and talk
about your... your stuff?

655
00:56:02,604 --> 00:56:04,314
What would you do
if you didn't have

656
00:56:04,314 --> 00:56:06,566
this glorious place
I gave you, hey?

657
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:08,526
Where would you go?

658
00:56:08,526 --> 00:56:12,405
I suppose you could go to your
mum's, Billie, couldn't you?

659
00:56:12,405 --> 00:56:14,115
James is always at work
at this time

660
00:56:14,115 --> 00:56:16,618
so he wouldn't know a thing.

661
00:56:16,618 --> 00:56:17,910
Who's James?

662
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:23,291
OK.

663
00:56:28,046 --> 00:56:30,757
...because I've already
been seeing the psychiatrist.

664
00:56:30,757 --> 00:56:32,967
So basically...

665
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:35,595
...due to the changes in the
international standards of care,

666
00:56:35,595 --> 00:56:39,891
I think I can get
chest reconstruction surgery

667
00:56:39,891 --> 00:56:41,559
without being on hormones.

668
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,729
So what I wanted to ask was...

669
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,482
...do you want to come?

670
00:56:47,482 --> 00:56:49,734
To the surgery?

671
00:56:49,734 --> 00:56:52,445
To the psychiatrist.

672
00:56:52,445 --> 00:56:54,238
For approval
in a couple of weeks.

673
00:57:00,078 --> 00:57:01,621
Somewhere you'd rather be?

674
00:57:03,164 --> 00:57:05,083
Yeah, sure, Mum. Book me in.

675
00:57:20,306 --> 00:57:23,434
- Awesome, right?
- Yes.

676
00:57:23,434 --> 00:57:26,479
This is so weird.

677
00:57:35,488 --> 00:57:38,700
- What?
- Harry, it's Tom.

678
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,576
<i>- Chef man.
- Is Billie there?</i>

679
00:57:40,576 --> 00:57:42,412
<i>She's not answering
any of my calls.</i>

680
00:57:42,412 --> 00:57:44,706
Go fish.
She's not here, Pastry Pete.

681
00:57:44,706 --> 00:57:46,582
<i>- Where are they?
- Don't know.</i>

682
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:50,169
<i>H! call Jane then.</i>

683
00:57:50,169 --> 00:57:52,797
Um, bad idea.

684
00:57:52,797 --> 00:57:55,008
<i>Why? Look,
/need to talk to Billie, man.</i>

685
00:57:55,008 --> 00:57:56,884
<i>I came off my scooter.</i>

686
00:57:56,884 --> 00:57:58,636
<i>Shit, dude.
Are you alright?</i>

687
00:57:58,636 --> 00:58:01,180
Cheers, mate.
Yeah, no, I'm good.

688
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:04,017
I'm alright, I was just son of
showing off at a friend's place

689
00:58:04,017 --> 00:58:06,102
and came off
and scraped up my left side.

690
00:58:06,102 --> 00:58:08,855
<i>But I need to talk lo Billie</i>

691
00:58:08,855 --> 00:58:10,732
cos I don't know
if I'm gonna be home.

692
00:58:10,732 --> 00:58:13,067
So I'll just call Jane, eh?

693
00:58:13,067 --> 00:58:15,361
<i>Not a good idea.</i>

694
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:17,739
You keep saying that.

695
00:58:17,739 --> 00:58:19,741
<i>Well, she's gonna be
back here anyway,</i>

696
00:58:19,741 --> 00:58:21,117
<i>so I can just tell her then.</i>

697
00:58:21,117 --> 00:58:23,578
Or I could just call Jane now

698
00:58:23,578 --> 00:58:26,164
No, don't.

699
00:58:26,164 --> 00:58:28,374
Dude, what the fuck's going on?

700
00:58:28,374 --> 00:58:30,251
Oh, fuck.

701
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:33,755
<i>Alright, here's the deal...</i>

702
00:58:41,846 --> 00:58:43,181
Billie.

703
00:58:50,521 --> 00:58:51,564
Sit down, mate.

704
00:58:55,526 --> 00:58:57,403
Why didn't you answer
any of my calls?

705
00:59:02,158 --> 00:59:04,327
Listen, Harry convinced me
not to call your mother

706
00:59:04,327 --> 00:59:05,828
looking for you.

707
00:59:05,828 --> 00:59:07,622
But he had to tell me why,
though.

708
00:59:09,415 --> 00:59:11,668
I don't understand why
you thought you had to lie to me

709
00:59:11,668 --> 00:59:13,252
about hanging out
with your mates.

710
00:59:18,508 --> 00:59:21,261
Alright, we'll duke it out,
you and me.

711
00:59:21,261 --> 00:59:23,221
I'm not gonna tell your mother.

712
00:59:23,221 --> 00:59:25,056
Good. I don't want him to know.

713
00:59:25,056 --> 00:59:26,766
No, you're gonna tell her.

714
00:59:28,476 --> 00:59:30,645
It's him.

715
00:59:30,645 --> 00:59:32,772
Fucking whatever, Bill.

716
00:59:32,772 --> 00:59:35,817
This is something you're gonna
son out yourself, yeah?

717
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:55,003
I just don't really wear
dresses like this at the moment.

718
00:59:55,003 --> 00:59:56,796
Well, it's your birthday.

719
00:59:56,796 --> 00:59:59,215
OK, well, can you just get out
so I can try something else on'?

720
00:59:59,215 --> 01:00:00,717
OK.

721
01:00:14,856 --> 01:00:17,025
I've been thinking
it might be good for me

722
01:00:17,025 --> 01:00:18,776
to start seeing people.

723
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:25,783
- Actually, I've...
- Do you need a hand?

724
01:00:25,783 --> 01:00:27,619
No, thank you.

725
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,662
There's this woman at work
that's...

726
01:00:30,872 --> 01:00:33,416
...kind of shown interest.

727
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:34,959
What, you're seeing someone?

728
01:00:34,959 --> 01:00:38,129
- No, that's not
what I was saying.

729
01:00:40,423 --> 01:00:42,383
How about trying this one on'?

730
01:00:42,383 --> 01:00:44,344
- Can you just give us a minute?
- Sure.

731
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,351
Look, I don't like any of these.
Can we just go?

732
01:00:51,351 --> 01:00:53,394
Did you want to try
somewhere else?

733
01:00:54,854 --> 01:00:56,481
No, just take me home.

734
01:01:17,835 --> 01:01:21,547
When we were here,
this place...

735
01:01:23,508 --> 01:01:27,595
Things made sense,
secret and separate.

736
01:01:29,138 --> 01:01:30,473
No family.

737
01:01:33,184 --> 01:01:37,981
It was precious, that stuff.
You know, it was mine.

738
01:01:53,413 --> 01:01:54,956
Tell your mum, Bill.

739
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,542
Just start talking.

740
01:02:14,892 --> 01:02:16,019
Where's the mother?

741
01:02:17,937 --> 01:02:19,731
She's around.

742
01:02:19,731 --> 01:02:23,610
Not enough to be in a photo
with her kids, though.

743
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,320
No, no, she's around.

744
01:02:27,363 --> 01:02:29,157
I'm glad to see you back here.

745
01:02:30,908 --> 01:02:32,619
We've spoken on the phone
a few times,

746
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:34,912
but your mum's not been here
for a while.

747
01:02:34,912 --> 01:02:37,874
And you, Billie, I haven't
seen you here for... ages.

748
01:02:37,874 --> 01:02:40,752
Seven months.
Yeah, it's been seven months.

749
01:02:40,752 --> 01:02:42,795
<i>OK.</i>

750
01:02:42,795 --> 01:02:45,048
How is everything, then'?

751
01:02:45,048 --> 01:02:49,928
Yeah, despite the hiccup,
things are pretty good.

752
01:02:49,928 --> 01:02:53,056
And the two of you'?
How has your time been together'?

753
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:56,851
Yeah, it's been good.

754
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:01,773
Yeah, time to get he is been good.

755
01:03:01,773 --> 01:03:03,483
Outside of that?

756
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:09,113
I've been lying to mum each week
about going to Tom's at ten.

757
01:03:09,113 --> 01:03:11,032
So, that's good.

758
01:03:11,032 --> 01:03:13,534
You know, actually, we just
been going out with friends.

759
01:03:13,534 --> 01:03:16,788
You know, fucking around without
anybody knowing where I am.

760
01:03:16,788 --> 01:03:19,916
So, you know, that's...
that's really good.

761
01:03:21,793 --> 01:03:24,587
And Mum hasn't known about
any of this until...

762
01:03:24,587 --> 01:03:26,589
...until just now, so...

763
01:03:26,589 --> 01:03:29,926
So that's really fucking good,
isn't it?

764
01:03:31,636 --> 01:03:33,846
And James here
has been seeing someone,

765
01:03:33,846 --> 01:03:36,516
I think someone from work, but
I don't know anything about that

766
01:03:36,516 --> 01:03:39,852
so you're gonna have to ask him
if that's been good because...

767
01:03:39,852 --> 01:03:42,480
...because I have absolutely
no fucking idea.

768
01:03:44,023 --> 01:03:46,276
I mean, maybe you could tell me?

769
01:03:52,657 --> 01:03:55,034
- I'm busy, guys.
- Unbelievable.

770
01:03:55,034 --> 01:03:57,161
I mean,
in front of the psychiatrist.

771
01:03:57,161 --> 01:03:59,414
Billie could've really
fucked things up for me today.

772
01:03:59,414 --> 01:04:02,500
I'm sure he deals with
fucked-up families all the time.

773
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,003
We gotta do this shit now, guys?
It's busy, yeah?

774
01:04:05,003 --> 01:04:07,505
Yeah, we have to do it now.
It needs to be sorted out.

775
01:04:07,505 --> 01:04:09,299
It's between you and Billie,
man.

776
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:12,468
No, it's not. This has been
really badly managed.

777
01:04:12,468 --> 01:04:15,263
And she's been lying to you,
too, you know

778
01:04:15,263 --> 01:04:17,056
I mean,
why the fuck do you think

779
01:04:17,056 --> 01:04:20,351
I would let her stay out till 12
on a school night?

780
01:04:20,351 --> 01:04:22,687
And have you bothered to ask her
what she's been doing?

781
01:04:22,687 --> 01:04:24,188
Cos she won't bloody tell me.

782
01:04:24,188 --> 01:04:27,025
I mean,
are you even remotely worried?

783
01:04:27,025 --> 01:04:29,110
I mean, this is our daughter
we're talking about.

784
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:31,904
Every Tuesday she's
your daughter, I agree, yes.

785
01:04:31,904 --> 01:04:33,990
But not at any other time.

786
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:35,867
You no longer decide
what happens to Billie

787
01:04:35,867 --> 01:04:38,620
after the clock strikes ten.
She's my responsibility then.

788
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,204
Oh, well, great job.

789
01:04:40,204 --> 01:04:42,248
Hey, this was your fucking idea,
remember?

790
01:04:42,248 --> 01:04:43,750
You need to fucking deal
with it.

791
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,501
For some reason
I can only guess at,

792
01:04:45,501 --> 01:04:47,587
you've chosen to be her mother
for a mere six hours

793
01:04:47,587 --> 01:04:50,173
out of every week.
That's 24 hours in a month.

794
01:04:50,173 --> 01:04:52,383
A day.
So in the last six months,

795
01:04:52,383 --> 01:04:55,261
you've chosen to be her mother
for, what, six days?

796
01:04:55,261 --> 01:04:58,598
Six days. Is that about right?

797
01:05:00,016 --> 01:05:01,935
You got no say, man.

798
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,428
is everything alright?

799
01:05:37,428 --> 01:05:39,931
I don't mind it rough,
don't get me wrong.

800
01:05:39,931 --> 01:05:41,391
No, don't...

801
01:05:46,271 --> 01:05:47,855
I'm bleeding.

802
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,527
I just hate it.
It's fucking painful.

803
01:05:53,945 --> 01:05:57,490
For me too. For lots of women.

804
01:06:01,494 --> 01:06:05,331
I used to think it was,
you know, hormones.

805
01:06:05,331 --> 01:06:08,751
- I didn't get it.
- Get what?

806
01:06:08,751 --> 01:06:10,712
That I hated it
because I couldn't escape

807
01:06:10,712 --> 01:06:12,505
that I was a woman.

808
01:06:12,505 --> 01:06:15,758
I mean, this body is still...

809
01:06:18,052 --> 01:06:20,597
...here.

810
01:06:20,597 --> 01:06:23,558
I didn't realize
you were getting periods again.

811
01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:31,357
Billie thinks I've been
seeing you for months, you know

812
01:06:31,357 --> 01:06:34,277
Thinks that I've been lying
about not seeing anyone.

813
01:06:34,277 --> 01:06:35,778
She's a smart cookie.

814
01:06:39,991 --> 01:06:42,410
<i>Tom and I split
when Billie was one.</i>

815
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:44,787
<i>We moved houses,
but kept sharing them,</i>

816
01:06:44,787 --> 01:06:48,333
<i>trying for some strange version
of a family, I guess.</i>

817
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:50,335
<i>Until it was clear
I was totally into women.</i>

818
01:06:52,962 --> 01:06:55,632
<i>In front of Billie,
he said he hated me</i>

819
01:06:55,632 --> 01:06:58,676
<i>for being so slow to realize
who I was.</i>

820
01:06:58,676 --> 01:07:03,806
<i>And when he finally moved out,
demanded we share Billie.</i>

821
01:07:03,806 --> 01:07:06,601
<i>And then my kid brother Harry
moved in.</i>

822
01:07:06,601 --> 01:07:08,269
<i>Messy.</i>

823
01:07:10,897 --> 01:07:14,067
<i>It was just so much
change for such a little kid.</i>

824
01:07:15,318 --> 01:07:16,903
Awesome, right?

825
01:07:18,571 --> 01:07:20,156
<i>I mean, there I was,</i>

826
01:07:20,156 --> 01:07:23,534
<i>hey, Pm a lesbian, ifs all cool.</i>

827
01:07:23,534 --> 01:07:26,704
<i>But there was something else.</i>

828
01:07:26,704 --> 01:07:29,415
<i>One night, it was so simple.
I dressed up.</i>

829
01:07:29,415 --> 01:07:31,709
<i>I just decided to do it.</i>

830
01:07:31,709 --> 01:07:33,711
<i>In what?</i>

831
01:07:33,711 --> 01:07:36,381
<i>I put on men's clothes,
drew a beard,</i>

832
01:07:36,381 --> 01:07:40,176
<i>and there I was.</i>

833
01:07:40,176 --> 01:07:43,596
<i>In the mirror I finally
recognized myself, and...</i>

834
01:07:44,931 --> 01:07:46,641
<i>“.5 was a beautiful man.</i>

835
01:07:49,227 --> 01:07:52,230
<i>I wish I had a photo of that.</i>

836
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:53,856
<i>No, you don't.</i>

837
01:07:56,276 --> 01:08:00,947
<i>It was so liberating, but
I was really scared, like. ..</i>

838
01:08:00,947 --> 01:08:04,200
<i>Pd screwed Billie and Tom
around so much by then.</i>

839
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,829
<i>So, I made a decision
that I'd just shelve it.</i>

840
01:08:10,123 --> 01:08:12,667
<i>I mean, I couldn't do anything
simple to change it anyway,</i>

841
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:15,878
<i>so it wasn't important.</i>

842
01:08:15,878 --> 01:08:17,964
<i>Billie was important.</i>

843
01:08:19,757 --> 01:08:22,802
<i>Then ten years later,
it came screaming out at me.</i>

844
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:27,181
<i>If you can't work out
how to live with yourself,</i>

845
01:08:27,181 --> 01:08:29,100
<i>you might as well not be here.</i>

846
01:08:31,561 --> 01:08:34,063
<i>Do you wish you were born a man?</i>

847
01:08:34,063 --> 01:08:35,732
<i>I mean, what would have happened</i>

848
01:08:35,732 --> 01:08:37,442
<i>if I kept putting it off'?</i>

849
01:08:37,483 --> 01:08:41,154
<i>The kindest,
most loving kid in the world.</i>

850
01:08:41,154 --> 01:08:43,656
<i>I didn't want to resent her.</i>

851
01:08:43,656 --> 01:08:45,575
<i>I just needed some time.</i>

852
01:08:48,161 --> 01:08:50,371
<i>Do you wish you were born a man?</i>

853
01:08:50,371 --> 01:08:52,999
<i>Yes.</i>

854
01:08:55,168 --> 01:08:57,712
<i>But then
you wouldn't have had Billie.</i>

855
01:08:59,297 --> 01:09:01,007
<i>No.</i>

856
01:09:01,007 --> 01:09:04,052
I'm sick of tiptoeing,
but I just...

857
01:09:04,052 --> 01:09:06,054
I just don't want to
do this anymore.

858
01:09:09,015 --> 01:09:13,394
Well...
how about you move back in'?

859
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,277
No.

860
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:33,623
<i>Hey, it's Billie.
Uh, leave me a message.</i>

861
01:09:33,623 --> 01:09:36,501
<i>- OK, bye.</i>

862
01:09:36,542 --> 01:09:40,129
<i>Hey, ifs Mum.
Um, ifs after five now,</i>

863
01:09:40,129 --> 01:09:42,757
<i>so I'm just wondering
if you're coming.</i>

864
01:09:42,757 --> 01:09:46,094
<i>I haven't heard anything
back from you, so, um...</i>

865
01:09:46,094 --> 01:09:49,138
<i>Well, H! be at home,
so give me a call.</i>

866
01:09:59,065 --> 01:10:01,276
<i>on!</i>

867
01:10:01,276 --> 01:10:04,487
<i>Hey, it's Billie.
Uh, leave me a message.</i>

868
01:10:04,487 --> 01:10:07,407
<i>- OK, bye.</i>

869
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:09,867
<i>Hiya. Um...</i>

870
01:10:09,867 --> 01:10:11,995
<i>I think we should at least talk.</i>

871
01:10:11,995 --> 01:10:15,039
<i>I'm not sure if you're even
listening to these messages,</i>

872
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:18,334
<i>and I'm not helping, at all.</i>

873
01:10:18,334 --> 01:10:20,336
Um, just...

874
01:10:20,336 --> 01:10:22,422
<i>Can we at least just talk?</i>

875
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,229
- Sorry I'm late. We're busy.
- Thanks for coming.

876
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:39,772
- Take a seat.
- OK.

877
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:43,109
I was just saying that,

878
01:10:43,109 --> 01:10:46,779
apart from a couple of
truancy incidences last year,

879
01:10:46,779 --> 01:10:49,490
we haven't had any trouble
with Billie before.

880
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:53,244
So, in our view, this incident
is out of character.

881
01:10:53,244 --> 01:10:55,705
Yeah, well, you know, we're
just as surprised as you are.

882
01:10:55,705 --> 01:10:58,041
Yes, it's really come
out of the blue for us as well,

883
01:10:58,041 --> 01:11:00,168
so that's why we're all here.

884
01:11:00,168 --> 01:11:04,005
Well, we're here to help.
So, what exactly happened?

885
01:11:04,005 --> 01:11:08,718
Well, Billie texted another
girl in a different year,

886
01:11:08,718 --> 01:11:10,803
Jasmin Miller,
during class time.

887
01:11:10,803 --> 01:11:13,932
And Jasmin's teacher
happened to notice

888
01:11:13,932 --> 01:11:16,684
and so he confiscated the phone.

889
01:11:16,684 --> 01:11:18,519
And he noticed that the message

890
01:11:18,519 --> 01:11:23,900
was a photograph of Billie
in a state of nakedness.

891
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,447
Really?

892
01:11:29,447 --> 01:11:31,449
And trust me, this is serious.

893
01:11:31,449 --> 01:11:34,953
I want to make it very clear
that if you're a minor,

894
01:11:34,953 --> 01:11:36,621
a naked photograph of yourself

895
01:11:36,621 --> 01:11:39,499
can be regarded
as child pornography.

896
01:11:39,499 --> 01:11:42,835
You know, normally I'd bring the
police into this straight away,

897
01:11:42,835 --> 01:11:45,463
but I'm not going to
in this case.

898
01:11:45,463 --> 01:11:48,091
I really want to just bring it
to your attention.

899
01:11:48,091 --> 01:11:53,346
Because a family like yours,
in a unique situation...

900
01:11:53,346 --> 01:11:56,015
I wanted to make sure
you understood the consequences.

901
01:11:56,015 --> 01:11:58,142
Unique situation?

902
01:11:58,142 --> 01:12:02,438
Well, I think you have
a more complicated view of life,

903
01:12:02,438 --> 01:12:05,525
- a family like yours.
- What? Separated?

904
01:12:05,525 --> 01:12:08,152
Look, I think Billie
has really good perspective,

905
01:12:08,152 --> 01:12:09,862
if that's what you mean.

906
01:12:09,862 --> 01:12:11,614
And I think we've equipped
our daughter

907
01:12:11,614 --> 01:12:13,324
with a better understanding
of things

908
01:12:13,324 --> 01:12:15,410
than most other parents might.

909
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:17,453
Yeah,
but I think it might have been

910
01:12:17,453 --> 01:12:19,872
a confusing time
for Billie lately.

911
01:12:32,969 --> 01:12:35,221
I'm not going through her stuff.

912
01:12:41,853 --> 01:12:43,771
You can watch
for hours if you want.

913
01:12:43,771 --> 01:12:45,690
She won't move.

914
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:49,861
She really doesn't do much else,
but especially on a Tuesday.

915
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:52,655
It's her favorite TV night.

916
01:12:52,655 --> 01:12:55,700
<i>Packed to the Rafters and NCIS.</i>

917
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:59,370
Now The Voice is on.
She likes to watch that.

918
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:01,414
Does she live here by herself?

919
01:13:01,414 --> 01:13:05,460
She has two kids.
A girl and a boy.

920
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,045
And if they're all
home together,

921
01:13:07,045 --> 01:13:08,379
they'll watch The Voice.

922
01:13:10,798 --> 01:13:15,553
She hates outside.
She doesn't really go out much.

923
01:13:15,553 --> 01:13:17,597
Wouldn't Child Services
know about this?

924
01:13:17,597 --> 01:13:19,265
They cover for her.

925
01:13:19,265 --> 01:13:22,435
They make excuses
if anyone asks for her.

926
01:13:22,435 --> 01:13:24,562
They can't afford
to get in trouble at school

927
01:13:24,562 --> 01:13:26,731
because the school
always calls the parents.

928
01:13:26,731 --> 01:13:29,859
And she won't come. She can't.

929
01:13:32,236 --> 01:13:35,490
- You have a brother?
- Younger.

930
01:13:46,542 --> 01:13:50,213
Now, what's so shit about
your life you haven't told us'?

931
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:56,928
What's so shit about yours?
You get to do whatever you want.

932
01:13:59,305 --> 01:14:00,807
Oh, my God.

933
01:14:02,809 --> 01:14:04,352
You don't get it.

934
01:14:06,187 --> 01:14:07,563
My mum's sick.

935
01:14:13,736 --> 01:14:15,613
I'm sick of being
your play-thing.

936
01:14:15,613 --> 01:14:16,906
Fuck off.

937
01:14:42,765 --> 01:14:45,184
<i>Hey. ifs 5:30 in the morning.</i>

938
01:14:45,184 --> 01:14:47,979
<i>Um, I'm still jetlagged,</i>

939
01:14:47,979 --> 01:14:52,483
<i>so it could be the crazy old
yelling man out here.</i>

940
01:14:56,279 --> 01:14:58,364
<i>Oh, can you see him'?</i>

941
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:05,204
<i>Anyway...
San Fran's pretty amazing.</i>

942
01:15:05,204 --> 01:15:08,666
<i>Um... I met some interesting
trans guys already,</i>

943
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:11,127
<i>and, um... Yeah.</i>

944
01:15:11,127 --> 01:15:12,921
<i>I hope you're watching these,</i>

945
01:15:12,921 --> 01:15:15,548
<i>and H! talk to you soon,
hopefully.</i>

946
01:15:24,307 --> 01:15:27,810
I have identified
as a trans guy for many years.

947
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:30,271
I identify as gender queer.

948
01:15:30,271 --> 01:15:32,023
Fuck if I know what a man is.

949
01:15:32,023 --> 01:15:34,984
For me, it's a thing that
I believed about myself

950
01:15:34,984 --> 01:15:36,986
from before conscious memory.

951
01:15:37,028 --> 01:15:40,865
I didn't know that I
was trans until I was about 26.

952
01:15:40,865 --> 01:15:43,076
As a child too,
I had a twin sister,

953
01:15:43,117 --> 01:15:45,286
so it was really easy
for me to understand

954
01:15:45,286 --> 01:15:47,997
what it looked like
to be comfortable as female,

955
01:15:47,997 --> 01:15:49,874
and I was not that.

956
01:15:49,874 --> 01:15:54,087
You know my questions, being,
OK, now that I can't take T,

957
01:15:54,087 --> 01:15:55,838
how do I kind of be the man

958
01:15:55,838 --> 01:15:57,882
that I've seen in my head
for me to be?

959
01:15:57,882 --> 01:15:59,968
That I've taken
this year off to do?

960
01:15:59,968 --> 01:16:04,806
Me, I've been on for 18 years
and, you know,

961
01:16:04,806 --> 01:16:09,394
I don't think that it's
necessary for gender identity.

962
01:16:11,396 --> 01:16:13,189
Um... I'm not on T,

963
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:15,108
but I just had top surgery.

964
01:16:15,108 --> 01:16:18,361
I'm on like day 16
after top surgery

965
01:16:18,361 --> 01:16:20,113
and it's really fulfilling.

966
01:16:20,113 --> 01:16:24,367
I'm married to a woman
and have a seven-year-old kid,

967
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:27,912
and I transitioned
before he was born,

968
01:16:27,912 --> 01:16:30,498
so he's always known me
as his dad.

969
01:16:30,498 --> 01:16:32,333
But I've still had
to come out to him

970
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:36,462
and help him know that
I'm a different kind of dad.

971
01:16:42,176 --> 01:16:44,137
<i>It took me a really long time</i>

972
01:16:44,137 --> 01:16:46,973
<i>to feel comfortable
accepting myself as a man.</i>

973
01:16:46,973 --> 01:16:49,017
<i>And still sometimes
after 11 years,</i>

974
01:16:49,017 --> 01:16:52,103
<i>I have moments where
I'm just like, it's so crazy.</i>

975
01:16:52,103 --> 01:16:53,563
<i>And not like I feel like
a woman,</i>

976
01:16:53,563 --> 01:16:56,774
<i>but it just feels like, um...</i>

977
01:16:56,774 --> 01:16:59,193
<i>I don't know,
I feel nervous or scared</i>

978
01:16:59,193 --> 01:17:01,904
<i>about claiming that identity.</i>

979
01:17:03,489 --> 01:17:07,118
<i>My dad became a woman</i>

980
01:17:07,118 --> 01:17:11,205
<i>about 14 years ago
when I was 17,</i>

981
01:17:11,205 --> 01:17:14,375
<i>and it really transformed
our relationship.</i>

982
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:16,294
<i>Initially, when my dad came out,</i>

983
01:17:16,294 --> 01:17:20,089
<i>I said, "Oh,
I Jove you no matter what. "</i>

984
01:17:20,089 --> 01:17:21,966
"That's be fine."

985
01:17:21,966 --> 01:17:24,886
<i>Then like a month or so later,</i>

986
01:17:24,886 --> 01:17:28,431
<i>I realized that I was, like,
sad about something.</i>

987
01:17:28,431 --> 01:17:31,768
<i>I lived with my mom,
and so I told her,</i>

988
01:17:31,768 --> 01:17:33,937
<i>like, "I feel a little weird
about something."</i>

989
01:17:33,937 --> 01:17:36,022
<i>She was like, "Do you think
it's because your dad</i>

990
01:17:36,022 --> 01:17:37,732
<i>came out to you
as transgender?"</i>

991
01:18:22,318 --> 01:18:23,611
Cheers.

992
01:18:27,991 --> 01:18:31,244
So, you want me to get
this camera off Harry'?

993
01:18:31,244 --> 01:18:34,205
- Yeah.
- Because...

994
01:18:34,205 --> 01:18:37,333
Because he stole it from me
and won't give it back.

995
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:40,169
Well, what's on there?

996
01:18:40,169 --> 01:18:43,298
Nothing's on there. I just
need it for a school project.

997
01:18:43,298 --> 01:18:45,258
So, why did he steal it'?

998
01:18:45,258 --> 01:18:47,176
I don't know.

999
01:18:47,176 --> 01:18:49,429
He was worried it had
shit of his own on there,

1000
01:18:49,429 --> 01:18:52,599
that it would incriminate him
or something.

1001
01:18:52,599 --> 01:18:53,975
I don't know.

1002
01:18:56,936 --> 01:18:58,521
Can you get it or not?

1003
01:19:05,403 --> 01:19:07,113
Tom still letting you
hang around

1004
01:19:07,113 --> 01:19:09,657
with those friends of yours?

1005
01:19:09,657 --> 01:19:11,576
Dad lets me be an adult.

1006
01:19:11,576 --> 01:19:13,786
I am able to make
my own decisions, you know.

1007
01:19:13,786 --> 01:19:18,875
Well, sending a naked photo of
yourself to a relative stranger

1008
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:21,002
doesn't seem like
the best decision to me.

1009
01:19:21,002 --> 01:19:23,588
Can you just give it a rest?

1010
01:19:23,588 --> 01:19:25,798
OK.

1011
01:19:25,798 --> 01:19:27,967
Why don't you come to mine
and we can talk together?

1012
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:30,386
And how is it any different
from you sending over videos

1013
01:19:30,386 --> 01:19:32,847
of your gay adventures
in San Francisco?

1014
01:19:32,847 --> 01:19:35,600
It's different.
You're a child, for one thing.

1015
01:19:37,352 --> 01:19:39,896
But in a year, all of a sudden,
I just won't be?

1016
01:19:39,896 --> 01:19:43,024
A year is a long time,
especially at your age.

1017
01:19:50,531 --> 01:19:52,492
I knew this was a bad idea.

1018
01:19:52,492 --> 01:19:55,244
You can't even get
my friggin' camera back.

1019
01:19:55,244 --> 01:19:59,165
Where are you going?
Just sit down.

1020
01:19:59,165 --> 01:20:01,042
Let's not do this.

1021
01:20:23,982 --> 01:20:28,987
...with this special robot
that we can remote control.

1022
01:20:28,987 --> 01:20:31,864
- It was really funny.
- That's really cheeky.

1023
01:20:36,035 --> 01:20:38,413
Right, I'm going to
take James' car.

1024
01:20:38,413 --> 01:20:40,415
I'll be able to pick him up
when he gets released.

1025
01:20:40,415 --> 01:20:42,333
I'll bring him home.

1026
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:44,252
But after that,
we've all got to pitch in.

1027
01:20:44,252 --> 01:20:47,922
- Who's the emergency contact?
- No one's gonna die.

1028
01:20:47,922 --> 01:20:50,466
There's the risk of death
in every surgery, alright?

1029
01:20:50,466 --> 01:20:52,594
Now, how do we find out
who the emergency contact is?

1030
01:20:52,594 --> 01:20:54,596
Just promise me you'll be home
when he gets out.

1031
01:20:54,596 --> 01:20:57,181
Yeah, yeah, look, I'll be there,
OK? Sponge in hand.

1032
01:20:57,181 --> 01:20:59,267
But I'm not riding your scooter.
I hate that thing.

1033
01:20:59,267 --> 01:21:03,521
- What's wrong with your car?
- It's dead. Died.

1034
01:21:03,521 --> 01:21:05,898
Anyway, if I'm gonna be
the emergency contact,

1035
01:21:05,898 --> 01:21:06,983
I should take the car.

1036
01:21:06,983 --> 01:21:08,901
Just take the damn bike, mate.

1037
01:21:08,901 --> 01:21:11,654
<i>- I'm gonna find out
- Dad, can we go new</i>

1038
01:21:11,654 --> 01:21:14,365
Just a sec, honey, OK?
Excuse me.

1039
01:21:16,784 --> 01:21:18,453
You've hardly said a word.

1040
01:21:20,038 --> 01:21:22,206
Please don't ask me to.

1041
01:21:22,206 --> 01:21:25,543
Look, I can't. Like, I just...
I really can't do it.

1042
01:21:25,543 --> 01:21:29,255
OK. You know she's gonna be out
of action for a while, alright?

1043
01:21:29,255 --> 01:21:32,967
I can't be the only one
holding this family together.

1044
01:21:32,967 --> 01:21:35,803
Why am I the only one
that James can rely on here?

1045
01:21:35,803 --> 01:21:38,389
Trust me, you're not
holding anything together.

1046
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,936
Give me the goddamn scooter key.

1047
01:21:42,936 --> 01:21:44,437
I'm the emergency contact?

1048
01:21:44,437 --> 01:21:47,023
Nope. Lisa.

1049
01:22:01,704 --> 01:22:04,958
Would you put that out?
You're disgusting.

1050
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:07,877
That's no way to speak
to your nurse.

1051
01:22:07,877 --> 01:22:10,463
I do have other stuff
I normally do, you know.

1052
01:22:14,092 --> 01:22:16,511
Will you put it out?

1053
01:22:16,511 --> 01:22:17,887
Make me.

1054
01:22:21,975 --> 01:22:26,229
it's probably seeping
into my wounds, poisoning me.

1055
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:29,983
It's right here so you can
just reach out and grab it.

1056
01:22:29,983 --> 01:22:32,068
You really are horrible.

1057
01:22:33,403 --> 01:22:36,823
Come on. This is so boring.

1058
01:22:36,823 --> 01:22:38,491
I need a break.

1059
01:22:40,576 --> 01:22:42,245
Where's your girlfriend?

1060
01:22:43,788 --> 01:22:45,331
<i>Busy.</i>

1061
01:22:46,666 --> 01:22:49,919
Busy? Trouble in paradise?

1062
01:22:51,921 --> 01:22:54,132
Shouldn't Billie be here?

1063
01:22:54,132 --> 01:22:55,550
What time is she getting here

1064
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:57,594
on this particularly
special Tuesday?

1065
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:11,024
Light breeze.

1066
01:23:38,509 --> 01:23:39,969
What?

1067
01:23:39,969 --> 01:23:41,804
How come
you're not at your man's'?

1068
01:23:41,804 --> 01:23:43,598
I thought I was grounded.

1069
01:23:43,598 --> 01:23:46,643
Not to help your
debilitated mother, you're not.

1070
01:23:46,643 --> 01:23:49,312
- James doesn't need me.
- I know.

1071
01:23:49,312 --> 01:23:51,856
I'm sure he's doing just fine
over there with Harry.

1072
01:23:51,856 --> 01:23:56,277
There are others.
Plenty of others.

1073
01:23:56,277 --> 01:23:58,905
And don't you
try and trick me again,

1074
01:23:58,905 --> 01:24:03,534
picking me up after school
and taking me there.

1075
01:24:03,534 --> 01:24:06,287
Hijacking me or something.

1076
01:24:07,664 --> 01:24:09,624
Scooter chef man.

1077
01:24:12,085 --> 01:24:13,711
Are you high?

1078
01:24:13,711 --> 01:24:16,339
<i>- Jesus, Billie.</i>

1079
01:24:18,174 --> 01:24:19,717
Come on.

1080
01:24:19,717 --> 01:24:21,844
<i>QR</i>

1081
01:24:21,844 --> 01:24:26,099
Look, I'm just doing
what he's always wanted.

1082
01:24:27,558 --> 01:24:29,727
You know, I'm staying away.

1083
01:24:29,727 --> 01:24:32,814
Don't test my patience
on this, Bill.

1084
01:24:32,814 --> 01:24:34,983
Do you really wanna do this?

1085
01:24:34,983 --> 01:24:37,735
<i>What are you gonna do, Pops?</i>

1086
01:24:37,735 --> 01:24:39,529
Double-ground me?

1087
01:24:44,784 --> 01:24:47,120
Yeah, well, she should be here.

1088
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,956
You guys have got
a responsibility to each other.

1089
01:24:49,956 --> 01:24:53,001
What, like you with Frida?

1090
01:24:53,001 --> 01:24:55,587
What do you mean?
We get along great.

1091
01:24:55,587 --> 01:24:58,089
Yeah, because you
only see her once a month.

1092
01:24:58,089 --> 01:25:01,342
Yeah, and we still
get along great.

1093
01:25:01,342 --> 01:25:03,511
Because you get to
come and go as you like

1094
01:25:03,511 --> 01:25:05,597
and she treats it like
she should be grateful

1095
01:25:05,597 --> 01:25:07,765
that you've graced her
with your presence.

1096
01:25:07,765 --> 01:25:11,436
I need a cigarette, OK?

1097
01:25:11,436 --> 01:25:13,062
Just sort your shit out
with Billie,

1098
01:25:13,062 --> 01:25:15,106
and save us all
a lot of trouble.

1099
01:25:16,524 --> 01:25:17,900
Great.

1100
01:25:19,193 --> 01:25:20,820
Oh, Harry.

1101
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,697
It wasn't me.

1102
01:25:22,697 --> 01:25:24,991
Must be the fuse again.

1103
01:25:24,991 --> 01:25:26,826
Very funny. Ha-ha.

1104
01:25:26,826 --> 01:25:28,828
Oh, pipe down, sport.

1105
01:25:36,294 --> 01:25:38,129
Oh, no, just making sure.

1106
01:25:38,129 --> 01:25:39,422
Great.

1107
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,967
Yep.

1108
01:25:42,967 --> 01:25:44,969
<i>Ne. Three (Mocks gram.</i>

1109
01:25:56,022 --> 01:25:58,358
Before I come in,

1110
01:25:58,358 --> 01:26:01,152
did you know I go by
the name James these days'?

1111
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,324
Yeah. I shouldn't be surprised.

1112
01:26:06,324 --> 01:26:08,034
Word gets out.

1113
01:26:08,034 --> 01:26:10,536
OK, I'll see you then.

1114
01:26:10,536 --> 01:26:11,871
Cheers.

1115
01:26:43,778 --> 01:26:45,154
How are you'?

1116
01:26:46,322 --> 01:26:47,740
OK.

1117
01:26:55,373 --> 01:26:56,874
Billie.

1118
01:27:00,378 --> 01:27:05,174
No offence,
but your dad is a scary dude.

1119
01:27:05,174 --> 01:27:06,676
I don't want to cross him.

1120
01:27:06,676 --> 01:27:08,219
Who cares?

1121
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:10,138
I don't have to do what he says.

1122
01:27:11,598 --> 01:27:12,974
Yeah.

1123
01:27:17,186 --> 01:27:20,189
- Have you heard from Jas?
- Oh, yeah...

1124
01:27:20,189 --> 01:27:23,318
She's not answering
my phone calls.

1125
01:27:23,318 --> 01:27:26,070
Yeah. I think she's blocked you.

1126
01:27:31,034 --> 01:27:33,786
If I gave you a message,
would you pass it on?

1127
01:27:33,786 --> 01:27:36,623
You know, something to apologize
or something?

1128
01:27:36,623 --> 01:27:38,082
Look...

1129
01:27:39,834 --> 01:27:41,336
I don't know.

1130
01:28:17,163 --> 01:28:20,458
You said you needed it tonight.

1131
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:21,834
Yes.

1132
01:28:46,651 --> 01:28:48,945
How many of these are there'?

1133
01:28:48,945 --> 01:28:50,321
Just that one.

1134
01:28:54,993 --> 01:28:57,412
Well, I can see
why Harry took it off you.

1135
01:28:58,705 --> 01:29:00,915
He wasn't protecting me.

1136
01:29:00,915 --> 01:29:02,417
This is...

1137
01:29:05,503 --> 01:29:07,088
...something.

1138
01:29:12,677 --> 01:29:14,470
Why record this?

1139
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,974
Why record your transition?

1140
01:29:17,974 --> 01:29:19,892
Or your trip to America?

1141
01:29:20,935 --> 01:29:22,604
To be able to go back.

1142
01:29:24,522 --> 01:29:27,609
To see things
I couldn't see at the time.

1143
01:29:27,609 --> 01:29:29,986
The small changes.

1144
01:29:29,986 --> 01:29:31,404
To show you.

1145
01:29:37,911 --> 01:29:40,288
You look exactly the same.

1146
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:45,418
Do I?

1147
01:29:45,418 --> 01:29:48,963
This whole year
was about becoming a man.

1148
01:29:48,963 --> 01:29:50,673
I know.

1149
01:29:50,673 --> 01:29:53,843
You said
you'd take testosterone.

1150
01:29:53,843 --> 01:29:55,929
You said you'd get a male chest.

1151
01:29:57,597 --> 01:29:59,933
Well, I got surgery
and it feels great,

1152
01:29:59,933 --> 01:30:03,311
but without testosterone,
it's gonna take a while.

1153
01:30:03,311 --> 01:30:06,147
I agreed to this

1154
01:30:06,147 --> 01:30:09,108
because I thought
you were going to become a man.

1155
01:30:09,108 --> 01:30:12,320
I was. I am.

1156
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,614
So, when the fuck do you change?

1157
01:30:16,115 --> 01:30:19,077
It's not just
about the physical.

1158
01:30:19,077 --> 01:30:21,371
- It never ends.
- No, it doesn't.

1159
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:26,417
This is why I still need
to sort some stuff out.

1160
01:30:28,628 --> 01:30:30,505
Where have I heard that before?

1161
01:30:31,923 --> 01:30:33,424
Do you need another year?

1162
01:30:35,301 --> 01:30:38,388
What could you
possibly have to son out?

1163
01:30:38,388 --> 01:30:39,722
You.

1164
01:30:42,475 --> 01:30:44,602
I need to son things out
with you.

1165
01:30:47,605 --> 01:30:49,232
Can I just have it back?

1166
01:30:59,075 --> 01:31:00,910
You want this for school, right?

1167
01:31:00,910 --> 01:31:02,745
This an project?

1168
01:31:02,745 --> 01:31:04,289
Does it matter?

1169
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:06,874
It's dangerous.

1170
01:31:06,874 --> 01:31:09,419
Look, it's not what you think.

1171
01:31:09,419 --> 01:31:10,837
It doesn't matter what I think.

1172
01:31:10,837 --> 01:31:12,880
You shouldn't have
what's on there.

1173
01:31:19,762 --> 01:31:21,306
You know what I should do?

1174
01:31:23,016 --> 01:31:25,768
I should burn this.

1175
01:31:25,768 --> 01:31:29,939
I should go through everything
you own and burn it all.

1176
01:31:29,939 --> 01:31:35,153
If you do anything to that tape,
I will walk out that door

1177
01:31:36,029 --> 01:31:39,365
and happily not speak to you
ever again.

1178
01:31:45,163 --> 01:31:47,332
If this gets out...

1179
01:31:48,875 --> 01:31:50,418
Please.

1180
01:31:57,133 --> 01:31:59,177
- Don't you dare.
- I'm sorry.

1181
01:32:49,227 --> 01:32:51,813
<i>When we were here...</i>

1182
01:32:51,813 --> 01:32:53,523
This place...

1183
01:32:55,108 --> 01:32:56,526
Things made sense.

1184
01:33:04,909 --> 01:33:09,205
This is my mum. This is
what his back looks like.

1185
01:33:42,405 --> 01:33:46,784
There are so many things that
I should have said before now.

1186
01:33:46,784 --> 01:33:49,245
You know, that I should've
told you about, but...

1187
01:33:49,245 --> 01:33:51,289
I felt stuck or something

1188
01:33:51,289 --> 01:33:53,458
and I didn't feel like
I could talk.

1189
01:33:56,419 --> 01:33:57,712
Fuck.

1190
01:33:59,505 --> 01:34:02,425
It is a really big thing to keep
from your daughter.

1191
01:34:05,303 --> 01:34:08,097
And then Tuesdays became
our special time.

1192
01:34:18,107 --> 01:34:20,568
<i>AH this stuff happened.</i>

1193
01:34:20,568 --> 01:34:22,403
<i>You know, important stuff.</i>

1194
01:34:22,403 --> 01:34:23,863
<i>It happens all the time.</i>

1195
01:35:26,134 --> 01:35:27,844
Jasmin?

1196
01:35:30,972 --> 01:35:33,099
There's food left
if you want it.

1197
01:36:48,675 --> 01:36:51,803
<i>Earth's population
reached seven billion.</i>

1198
01:36:51,803 --> 01:36:53,721
<i>And then, you know,
in Antarctica,</i>

1199
01:36:53,721 --> 01:36:56,641
<i>a glacier the size of New York
split off.</i>

1200
01:36:56,641 --> 01:36:58,726
<i>Or it nearly split off.</i>

1201
01:36:58,726 --> 01:37:01,020
<i>You know, there was all
that Arab Spring stuff.</i>

1202
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:03,106
<i>And Occupy Wall Street,</i>

1203
01:37:03,106 --> 01:37:05,358
<i>and, I don't know,
everything in Egypt.</i>

1204
01:37:05,358 --> 01:37:07,193
<i>I mean, you became a year 12,</i>

1205
01:37:07,193 --> 01:37:10,280
<i>Josh grew
three different beards,</i>

1206
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,949
<i>and... my mum became a man.</i>

1207
01:37:14,242 --> 01:37:15,660
<i>Al! this stuff happened.</i>

1208
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:17,412
<i>You know, important stuff.</i>

1209
01:37:17,412 --> 01:37:19,539
<i>And it happens all the time.</i>

1210
01:37:19,539 --> 01:37:23,334
<i>And how do you... how do you
know what bits realty matter?</i>

1211
01:37:23,334 --> 01:37:27,046
<i>Back at the start,
I didn't know how to be.</i>

1212
01:37:27,046 --> 01:37:32,051
<i>You know, how supportive,
how angry, how worried.</i>

1213
01:37:33,845 --> 01:37:34,971
<i>And you...</i>

1214
01:37:36,306 --> 01:37:38,099
<i>You just seemed so clear.</i>

1215
01:37:38,099 --> 01:37:40,143
<i>I mean, you both did.</i>

1216
01:37:40,143 --> 01:37:43,313
<i>You know, clear about what
you liked and what you felt.</i>

1217
01:37:43,313 --> 01:37:44,814
<i>I wasn't.</i>

1218
01:37:46,024 --> 01:37:48,318
And sex...

1219
01:37:48,318 --> 01:37:51,988
<i>...still didn't make sense, but
it did feel great and weird,</i>

1220
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:54,198
<i>and at least
I didn't feel like the Billie</i>

1221
01:37:54,198 --> 01:37:56,659
<i>that James was trying
to get away from.</i>

1222
01:37:56,659 --> 01:37:59,037
<i>I felt like myself.</i>

1223
01:37:59,037 --> 01:38:03,124
<i>Look, I just... I didn't
want to talk about my mum,</i>

1224
01:38:03,124 --> 01:38:06,169
<i>and how it'd be easier for him
if I wasn't around,</i>

1225
01:38:06,169 --> 01:38:09,297
<i>or probably even better for him
if I didn't even exist.</i>

1226
01:38:11,174 --> 01:38:14,010
<i>I wanted to know about you...
and Josh.</i>

1227
01:38:31,861 --> 01:38:34,322
<i>...clear about what
you liked and what you felt.</i>

1228
01:38:34,322 --> 01:38:35,865
This section here,

1229
01:38:35,865 --> 01:38:38,159
it's really obvious
that they're having sex.

1230
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:39,869
it's incredibly graphic.

1231
01:38:39,869 --> 01:38:41,913
And how much other footage
is out there'?

1232
01:38:41,913 --> 01:38:43,581
This is supposed to be
a school project.

1233
01:38:43,581 --> 01:38:46,167
- What is going on?
- I agree that this...

1234
01:38:46,167 --> 01:38:48,002
<i>...the Billie that James</i>

1235
01:38:48,044 --> 01:38:50,088
<i>was trying to get away from.
I felt like myself.</i>

1236
01:38:53,925 --> 01:38:56,261
You need to get rid of
it. If this got out online...

1237
01:38:56,261 --> 01:38:59,305
- Why would it get online?
- You're having sex on camera.

1238
01:38:59,305 --> 01:39:01,599
<i>It wasn't meant for anyone else.</i>

1239
01:39:01,599 --> 01:39:04,102
I can't believe you'd do this.

1240
01:39:04,102 --> 01:39:06,312
But you do understand
why you need to get rid of it'?

1241
01:39:06,312 --> 01:39:07,897
No.

1242
01:39:07,897 --> 01:39:09,565
You know we can take this
to the police.

1243
01:39:09,565 --> 01:39:11,276
But that'll get them
all in trouble.

1244
01:39:11,276 --> 01:39:12,944
Billie was under
the age of consent.

1245
01:39:12,944 --> 01:39:14,654
- Are you blackmailing us?
- Not at all.

1246
01:39:14,654 --> 01:39:16,656
I'm saying that
bringing the police in

1247
01:39:16,656 --> 01:39:18,783
is going to ruin
all their lives,

1248
01:39:18,783 --> 01:39:22,704
so we need to convince Billie
to destroy the footage herself.

1249
01:39:22,704 --> 01:39:25,999
Even if she agrees to it,
how can we take her word for it'?

1250
01:39:25,999 --> 01:39:28,376
Look, guys, I'll
make sure she does it, alright?

1251
01:39:28,376 --> 01:39:30,503
Maybe we can be there,
so we can make sure.

1252
01:39:30,503 --> 01:39:32,964
But my point is
that we can never be sure.

1253
01:39:32,964 --> 01:39:36,301
So, you're basically saying
you can't trust me.

1254
01:39:36,301 --> 01:39:39,929
I am trying to explain the
impossible position we're in.

1255
01:39:46,185 --> 01:39:48,229
Look...

1256
01:39:48,229 --> 01:39:51,274
After this, you won't have
to listen to me anymore,

1257
01:39:51,274 --> 01:39:53,026
I swear.

1258
01:39:53,026 --> 01:39:54,694
You won't even have
to have me in your life

1259
01:39:54,694 --> 01:39:55,945
if that's what you want.

1260
01:39:55,945 --> 01:39:57,530
But if you keep going like this,

1261
01:39:57,530 --> 01:40:00,617
you're not gonna have much else.

1262
01:40:03,244 --> 01:40:05,622
You just had
to give it to Jasmin.

1263
01:40:06,789 --> 01:40:08,416
How could you watch it'?

1264
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:11,961
Because I showed her.

1265
01:40:13,630 --> 01:40:17,091
What am I supposed to do
with all this?

1266
01:40:17,091 --> 01:40:20,386
I didn't know
what to do, so I showed Mum.

1267
01:40:20,386 --> 01:40:22,597
And then she called us,
eventually.

1268
01:40:28,853 --> 01:40:30,480
There are worse things
in the world

1269
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:33,107
than having a mum that
wants to be someone.

1270
01:40:33,107 --> 01:40:34,233
Trust me.

1271
01:40:35,902 --> 01:40:38,446
I wanted to hang out with you.

1272
01:40:38,446 --> 01:40:41,532
I liked the camera.

1273
01:40:41,532 --> 01:40:46,120
But now, I don't want
anyone else to see this.

1274
01:41:08,309 --> 01:41:09,560
<i>- Hit it.</i>

1275
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:11,771
Hit it. Hit it.

1276
01:41:11,771 --> 01:41:14,107
Hit it. Again.

1277
01:41:14,107 --> 01:41:15,817
Hit it.

1278
01:41:17,819 --> 01:41:19,904
Hit it. Hit it.

1279
01:41:19,904 --> 01:41:21,114
Keep going.

1280
01:41:21,114 --> 01:41:23,533
Hit it. Hit it.

1281
01:41:26,452 --> 01:41:29,455
So, you got
your fuck buddies back, then?

1282
01:41:30,623 --> 01:41:31,916
I got rid of everything.

1283
01:41:31,916 --> 01:41:33,876
Kiddie porn free now, are we?

1284
01:41:35,878 --> 01:41:37,463
Am I?

1285
01:41:39,382 --> 01:41:41,759
You think that
I've still got something?

1286
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:45,221
<i>Frida!</i>

1287
01:41:46,973 --> 01:41:49,267
Just tell me.

1288
01:41:49,267 --> 01:41:51,894
Come on, why worry'?

1289
01:41:51,894 --> 01:41:53,813
You're in the clear now.

1290
01:41:53,813 --> 01:41:55,815
No more games, Harry, please.

1291
01:41:58,192 --> 01:42:00,653
Later, when all this is over,
right, wouldn't it be great

1292
01:42:00,653 --> 01:42:04,324
to just have
one tiny piece left, you know

1293
01:42:04,324 --> 01:42:05,950
Fuck 'em. No-one's gonna know.

1294
01:42:07,952 --> 01:42:09,746
Why are you doing this?

1295
01:42:09,746 --> 01:42:12,081
Frida, will you stop that?!

1296
01:42:15,251 --> 01:42:18,338
- What do you want me to say?
- Say you don't have anything.

1297
01:42:18,338 --> 01:42:20,924
OK, well, how about anything
I say you won't believe.

1298
01:42:20,924 --> 01:42:23,092
How about that?

1299
01:42:23,092 --> 01:42:25,511
Yeah. You're right.

1300
01:42:25,511 --> 01:42:27,096
That's why we need to go
right now,

1301
01:42:27,096 --> 01:42:28,890
so you can show me
you don't have anything.

1302
01:42:28,890 --> 01:42:30,642
I can't, even if I wanted to.

1303
01:42:30,642 --> 01:42:33,102
I was lumped with Frida,
and then I've got sound check,

1304
01:42:33,102 --> 01:42:35,063
and then I've got the gig.

1305
01:42:35,063 --> 01:42:37,982
Go to the house yourself
and check. I don't care.

1306
01:42:37,982 --> 01:42:41,569
- You know James will be there.
- So?

1307
01:42:41,569 --> 01:42:44,572
- I'm not going on my own.
- You're just gonna avoid him

1308
01:42:44,572 --> 01:42:46,741
for the rest of your life now,
are you?

1309
01:42:49,077 --> 01:42:51,496
Why? You don't trust him?

1310
01:42:51,496 --> 01:42:53,414
Do you?

1311
01:42:53,456 --> 01:42:56,042
Well, you're gonna have to go
and look for yourself, alright?

1312
01:42:56,042 --> 01:42:58,253
I can't go over there.

1313
01:42:58,253 --> 01:43:00,672
I'm not going over there.

1314
01:43:00,672 --> 01:43:03,091
- Dude, I gotta go to work.
- Do you have to go?

1315
01:43:03,091 --> 01:43:05,218
Fuck, yeah,
I gotta go to work, Bill.

1316
01:43:05,218 --> 01:43:07,637
You know, they're dying
over there without me.

1317
01:43:07,637 --> 01:43:10,098
I've wasted too much time
on all this shit.

1318
01:43:12,517 --> 01:43:14,686
Sorry. I'm tired, alright?

1319
01:43:14,686 --> 01:43:16,062
Look, I'll go.

1320
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:19,607
I'll go right after work.

1321
01:43:19,607 --> 01:43:21,276
In the meantime,
don't wait up, kid.

1322
01:43:21,276 --> 01:43:23,444
Watch a movie, or read a book...

1323
01:43:24,737 --> 01:43:26,656
Just take care of yourself, eh?

1324
01:44:17,123 --> 01:44:18,875
<i>Billie.</i>

1325
01:44:20,501 --> 01:44:22,211
<i>You came.</i>

1326
01:44:24,422 --> 01:44:26,007
I wasn't sure.

1327
01:44:27,175 --> 01:44:29,469
<i>on, God.</i>

1328
01:44:29,469 --> 01:44:31,262
<i>Of course I came.</i>

1329
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,260
It's Tuesday.

1330
01:45:36,869 --> 01:45:38,413
Can't stay here forever.

1331
01:45:58,808 --> 01:46:02,520
I'll keep it quick so I don't
embarrass myself too much.

1332
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:04,314
Or cry.

1333
01:46:07,817 --> 01:46:09,986
<i>You watch your child grow older</i>

1334
01:46:09,986 --> 01:46:15,199
<i>and know they've changed,
but don't know how or what,</i>

1335
01:46:16,618 --> 01:46:19,746
<i>or exactly when it happened.</i>

1336
01:46:19,746 --> 01:46:22,081
It's hard to pinpoint the when,
isn't it?

1337
01:46:24,667 --> 01:46:27,253
But you were actually
pretty good at it.

1338
01:46:27,295 --> 01:46:30,465
Knowing the how or what or when.

1339
01:46:31,966 --> 01:46:33,801
<i>Much better than t ever was.</i>

1340
01:46:36,304 --> 01:46:37,805
So...

1341
01:46:39,766 --> 01:46:43,353
I hope you're around a lot
longer to keep me up to date.

1342
01:46:50,193 --> 01:46:52,237
Alright.

1343
01:46:52,237 --> 01:46:54,572
With the cheese, it kind of,
like, counter-balances it.

1344
01:46:54,572 --> 01:46:59,577
Balances out, so it's like the
creaminess and the broth base.

1345
01:47:00,536 --> 01:47:02,080
Sir, you're up.

1346
01:47:03,331 --> 01:47:05,625
Sir, you're up. Cup of tea.

1347
01:47:32,026 --> 01:47:33,778
How was school?

1348
01:47:50,587 --> 01:47:52,505
James visited earlier.

1349
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,508
He looks good.

1350
01:47:57,885 --> 01:48:00,847
He's slow, you know,
but he gets there.

1351
01:48:02,974 --> 01:48:05,184
He just put it off for so long.

1352
01:48:07,228 --> 01:48:09,480
Please don't tell me
it was all for my benefit.

1353
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:10,815
Come on, man.

1354
01:48:10,815 --> 01:48:14,152
You loved Jane. Unconditionally.

1355
01:48:14,152 --> 01:48:16,779
You idolized her.

1356
01:48:16,779 --> 01:48:19,115
What mother
would want to change that?

1357
01:48:20,909 --> 01:48:22,535
He certainly didn't.

1358
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:32,670
You know, most people do
things with the best intentions,

1359
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:36,090
and sometimes
it just doesn't work out.

1360
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:39,427
Things happen,
you make a stupid decision...

1361
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:42,096
You get lazy.

1362
01:48:43,473 --> 01:48:45,266
You crash your scooter.

1363
01:48:46,726 --> 01:48:48,478
That's life, Bill.

1364
01:48:52,732 --> 01:48:55,234
It Still hurts.

1365
01:48:55,234 --> 01:48:56,861
Sure.

1366
01:49:03,993 --> 01:49:05,995
You don't want
what you had before...

1367
01:49:07,538 --> 01:49:10,208
...knowing only
a few pieces of someone.

1368
01:49:12,293 --> 01:49:15,255
James has shown you, Bill.
He's not hiding anything.

1369
01:49:18,091 --> 01:49:20,551
You have a chance to know
who your mother really is.

1370
01:49:22,553 --> 01:49:24,889
And that's when you can choose
to love him.

1371
01:49:26,307 --> 01:49:28,309
Or not.

1372
01:49:28,309 --> 01:49:30,770
You can make that choice
every day, if you like.

1373
01:49:34,399 --> 01:49:36,651
But there's no other way.

1374
01:51:12,622 --> 01:51:16,417
