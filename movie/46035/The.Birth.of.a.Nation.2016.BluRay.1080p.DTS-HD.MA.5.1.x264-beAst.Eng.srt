1
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,460
Bring him here.

2
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,570
In the time of our ancestors

3
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:31,440
the cycle of our people lay in the hands of the children.

4
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,440
A child's position in the tribe was left to the maker.

5
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,980
Children bearing marks were brought before the elders

6
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,450
there, they were given titles...

7
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,490
...titles that would last a lifetime.

8
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,090
Wisdom...

9
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,930
Courage...

10
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,770
Vision.

11
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,680
This boy holds the holy marks

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,510
of our ancestors.

13
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,080
He is a leader.

14
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,720
He is a prophet.

15
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,920
We should listen to him.

16
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,990
We should listen to him.

17
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,560
I see you!

18
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,880
Nat?

19
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,850
Nat!

20
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,750
All right, you win again.

21
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,660
Come on out!

22
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,540
Sam? You come on in here for supper!

23
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,200
Yessum.

24
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,810
Bye, nat.

25
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,140
Bye.

26
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,920
You so much as bat an eye,

27
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,660
I'm gonna blow you from here to hell.

28
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,720
What you doin' out here, boy?

29
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,190
Pickin' up some food for my master,

30
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,830
Benjamin Turner.

31
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,660
In the middle of the night? Turn around.

32
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,740
here your pass at?

33
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,210
Bring it on. C'mon! Bring it!

34
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,880
Get back.

35
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,920
You think you're smarter than me, don't you, boy?

36
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,150
No, sir.

37
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,650
Jesse, who do we call a nigger

38
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,160
who done think he can outsmart a white man?

39
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,990
A dead nigger.

40
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,790
Turn around.

41
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,730
On your knees.

42
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,000
You done this to yourself, boy.

43
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,630
- What happened?  - Go on to bed.

44
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,360
I got caught stealing food.

45
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,030
I killed a slave catcher. I gotta go.

46
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,800
You take care of your mom and Nana, you hear?

47
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,100
You a child of god.

48
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,040
You got purpose. It's in you.

49
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,910
The lord put it there,

50
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,840
and there ain't nothing nobody can do to take it away.

51
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,080
You hear?

52
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,380
Yes, sir.

53
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,920
Now you go ahead on and go to bed.

54
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,890
I'll be back for y'all as soon as I can.

55
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,000
Go on back to bed. Go on to bed, girl! We sleep!

56
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,420
Bridget! Nancy! Y'all wake up!

57
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,950
Isaac's in a lot of trouble.

58
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,420
I need one of y'all to tell me where he is.

59
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,290
Don't know where he is, massa. We ain't seen him all night.

60
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,360
You sure?

61
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,430
Ben, I'm gonna ask you to leave.

62
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,130
- Huh?  - A white man has lost his life tonight.

63
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,840
You know like I do what that mean. Get!

64
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,770
Now, any harm done to these people,

65
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,440
I'm gonna call the sheriff! I'm serious!

66
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,450
None of y'all know where he is, huh?

67
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,720
No, sir.

68
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,490
Goddamnit.

69
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,730
What about you, boy?

70
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,930
He don't know nothing, either.

71
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,340
Where's your daddy at?

72
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,320
Now listen, you don't tell me where he's at,

73
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,050
someone else is gonna find him,

74
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,190
and they gonna kill him.

75
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,760
You tell me, I'll go get him.I'll bring him back here safe.

76
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,830
All right?

77
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,830
Tell me where daddy's at.

78
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,270
Say it. Spit something outta that mouth! Say it!

79
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,310
Tell me where he's at!

80
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,380
Goddamnit.

81
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,220
You that nigger's boy, all right.

82
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,120
If I find out y'all's been lying,

83
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,790
I'm gonna come back here, i ain't gonna be so nice...

84
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,800
Oh, massa, please! Please! Massa, please! Oh, lord!

85
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,530
All right, that's... That's enough! Stop!

86
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,530
You best teach that boy some manners.

87
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,200
Next time he look me in the eye,

88
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,440
you gonna get the same thing what waitin' for his pa.

89
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,290
Mind if I help you?

90
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
No, ma'am.

91
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,970
Samuel told me something this morning

92
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,430
I wanted to ask you about.

93
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,910
He said, nat knows how to read.

94
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,410
Nat don't not know how to read.

95
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,480
Part of me couldn't believe it myself.

96
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,310
So I tested him.

97
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Sure enough,

98
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,890
there he was sounding out letters.

99
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,260
You have him come by the house tomorrow after lunch.

100
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,130
He don't mean no harm.

101
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,260
I'ma whip him good the next time I see him.

102
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,000
Whip him? Nonsense.

103
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,940
I'm gonna teach him.

104
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,440
If the good lord gave that boy a gift to read,

105
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,140
we'd be remiss to let it go to waste.

106
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,950
And don't expect him back anytime soon.

107
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,450
He'll be living with us in the main house for a while.

108
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,290
Lessons best not be disturbed in the beginning.

109
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,220
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,180
It's okay, baby. It's okay. It ain't real.

111
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,180
It ain't real. It's all right. It's in your mind.

112
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,250
It's in your mind.

113
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,550
Momma's here now.

114
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,560
Want my poppa.

115
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,400
Me too, baby.

116
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,930
Me too.

117
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,070
Put your arms through.

118
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,570
How handsome.

119
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,290
He'll be all right.

120
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,620
These books are for white folks.

121
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,200
They're full of things your kind wouldn't understand.

122
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,300
But I do have a special one just for you.

123
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,270
And guess what?

124
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,300
It's the best book ever written.

125
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,750
You're a special boy, Nathaniel.

126
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,650
Study hard and heed my instructions, hear?

127
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,150
Your life,

128
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,790
it'll never be the same.

129
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,390
I'll see to that.

130
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,760
Yes, missus.

131
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,170
"Genesis. In the beginning..."

132
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,340
In the beginning...

133
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,670
Here, this word here, "the."

134
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,080
That's tricky. Now, these letters "t-h."

135
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,410
 Whenever you see them...

136
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,510
"...cleanse your hands, ye sinners...

137
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,520
"And purify your hearts, ye double-minded.

138
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,460
"Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep.

139
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,360
"Let your laughter be turned to mourning,

140
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,060
"and your joy to heaviness."

141
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,730
James 4, chapter 8 and 9.

142
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,190
Turn with me, if you would, to James 1.

143
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,160
Holding on to the goodness of the lord.

144
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,870
I spoke to Ben, before he went on to be with the lord.

145
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,470
He felt you'd be more useful to our family as a field hand.

146
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,420
I'm sorry, nat.

147
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,270
Now, you gonna start here,

148
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,600
and you're gonna work your way down yonder.

149
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,640
And I'll be right over here. You hear?

150
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,420
Ah!

151
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,410
Thank you, brother.

152
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,850
I had fainted, unless I had believed to see,

153
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,360
the goodness of the lord

154
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,230
in the land of the living.

155
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,860
Wait on the lord,

156
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,660
be of good courage,

157
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,430
and he shall strengthen thine heart.

158
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,540
Wait, I say,

159
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,610
on the lord.

160
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,610
Let us bow our heads.

161
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,560
Sam, that sister of yours,

162
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,890
gonna make a fine wife indeed.

163
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,730
It's been a true blessing

164
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,900
seeing her develop into the woman that she is.

165
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,400
It'd be an even better blessing

166
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,600
seein' her and momma

167
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,800
put their feet under his table instead of mine.

168
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,750
I gotta say,

169
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,420
Sam, your slaves sure do know how to behave.

170
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,290
I'm impressed with them every time I come around.

171
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,590
Well, they god fearin'. One of them's a preacher.

172
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,760
No one's gotta tell you

173
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,430
the times are tough with the drought.

174
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,800
It's gettin' harder for the whites in this county

175
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,600
to clothe and feed their niggers good.

176
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,610
Talks of insurrection

177
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,840
got folks scared.

178
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,680
I think people might pay good money

179
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,080
to have them calm down a bit.

180
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,850
Especially by one of their own.

181
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,830
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

182
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,470
You seen a nigger run past here?

183
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,470
Naw. Then again i doze off for a few.

184
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,740
What about you, boy?

185
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,810
Best not lie now. I know when y'all's lyin'.

186
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,110
No, sir.

187
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,610
Couple of niggers went missin'

188
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,980
off bill Johnson's place this mornin'.

189
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,610
Say they raised up on an overseer

190
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,550
before they took off.

191
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,890
All right, you see somethin' let us know.

192
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,420
Will do.

193
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,620
Giddyup.

194
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,000
You finish up here, I'll go square up inside.

195
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,670
Yes, sir.

196
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,020
Ma'am. The youngin', he dropped this a step back.

197
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,750
Thank ya.

198
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,990
Whatcha think you're doin'?

199
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,830
He was just tryin'... You spoke to my wife.

200
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,660
Where's your owner, boy?

201
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,100
I asked you a question.

202
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,880
You best goin' to put that stick down now!

203
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,010
I want the sheriff.

204
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,940
his boy assaulted me!

205
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,580
He assaulted my wife!

206
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,750
And I'm bringin' charges!

207
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,850
Sheriff Floyd?

208
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,780
All right, you fetch him if you like.

209
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,050
But in the meantime i will give you

210
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,050
to the count of three to put your stick down

211
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,420
before I give you some real charges

212
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,660
to give him when he gets here.

213
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,920
You threatnin' me?

214
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,160
One.

215
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,960
Two.

216
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,570
C'mon, get the boy.

217
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,470
Let's get home.

218
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,090
We got sweet corn!

219
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,560
C'mon now! Get your grits!

220
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,920
We got sweet corn here.

221
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,130
Here you go.

222
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,960
And this one here!

223
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,760
Strong as an ox!

224
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,030
Nothin' but good seed flowin' from this here buck.

225
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,800
Look at them teeth. Huh?

226
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,770
I'll start him out at...

227
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,670
200.

228
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,770
150?

229
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,110
C'mon now, I gotta make a living here, gents.

230
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,240
100? 75?

231
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,610
Sold! Get outta here.

232
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,020
Put a yoke on him. Bring her up here.

233
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:16,190
Now, consider this comely wench.

234
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,630
Not a day over 18.

235
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,630
All right, I'll start her off at 175.

236
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,900
I got 175. Do I hear two?

237
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,640
Now we're talkin'! Do I got 225?

238
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,000
Massa, that wench there sure would make

239
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,640
a good weddin' gift for miss Catherine.

240
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,740
225!

241
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,040
You keep sayin' she been askin'.

242
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,210
Do I hear 250?

243
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,010
She looks right young, if you ask me.

244
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,000
C'mon now.

245
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,850
You right, sir, she young. Gimme 250.

246
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,280
C'mon. But with the right teacher,

247
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,820
- a wench like that?  - 250.

248
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,990
Could be workin' a long time.

249
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,690
There it is! 275?

250
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,260
Massa, sure would be a shame to watch her

251
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,830
go to waste for such a low price.

252
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,030
And what the hell would you know about

253
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,830
what's a little and what's a lot, huh?

254
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,900
I don't know what's gotten into you lately,

255
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,570
but whatever it is, you better quit.

256
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,840
Are you seein' what I'm seein'?

257
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,670
You take this one home, you know,

258
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,080
clean her up,

259
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,710
won't be long before you find yourself

260
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,880
happier than a dog with three balls!

261
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,680
Smile, bitch.

262
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,590
That's 250 goin' once.

263
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,820
250 goin' twice.

264
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,060

265
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,830
We got 275!

266
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,300
275 goin' once.

267
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,840
275 goin' twice.

268
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,940
Sold to that fine gentleman in the back!

269
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,110
Whoa.

270
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,220
She be fine, sir.

271
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,290
I sure hope you're right.

272
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,220
Have your momma get her cleaned and fed.

273
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,000
- Start breakin' her in.  - Yes, sir.

274
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,090
You and hark can start on the north fence

275
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,630
- first thing in the morning.  - Yes, sir.

276
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,000
I ain't gonna hurt you.

277
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,640
Just gonna climb up and help you out.

278
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,150
It's all right.

279
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,310
Who is this child? What happened?

280
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,110
Burnin' up.

281
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,840
This mine! This my dress! My dress! This my dress!

282
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,050
Go now! Get out, ya!

283
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:57,220
We're not gonna hurt you. We're not gonna hurt you.

284
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,380
Don't take it away.

285
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,950
You just smile

286
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,820
and let them do the talkin'. All right?

287
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,690
Yessum.

288
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,430
Afternoon, massa. This here cherry-Ann.

289
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,800
Massa.

290
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,040
Catherine!

291
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,810
Catherine, this here is cherry-Ann.

292
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,980
Missus.

293
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,750
Oh, thank you!

294
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,050
Come on, i want you to meet momma.

295
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,060
Momma.

296
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,460
Thank you.

297
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,830
For what?

298
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:22,030
For gettin' her better. For makin' her so beautiful.

299
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,340
I didn't do nothin'.

300
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,210
That girl was brought into this world

301
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,240
as beautiful as she could be.

302
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,190
It sure is sad to see you and the missus go.

303
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,890
We'll be just down the road.

304
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,090
When we get all good and settled,

305
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,360
we'll come back and visit.

306
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,490
On Sundays for church and that.

307
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,230
Well, there's no rush.

308
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,860
Oh. I'm foolin'. Come here.

309
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,000
If y'all need anything,

310
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,370
or he ain't treatin' you right, you let me know.

311
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,300
Yes, big brother. I love you.

312
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,170
Love you, too.

313
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,940
Momma, you ready?

314
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,010
I'm worried about you, Sam.

315
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,880
This a big place to be out here all by yourself.

316
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,950
I'll be fine.

317
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,890
You take care now.

318
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,800
All right. Hmm.

319
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,140
Massa. For the horses.

320
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,470
Just one.

321
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,970
Yes, sir.

322
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,580
Hi.

323
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,980
Hi.

324
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,190
I'm nat.

325
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,560
I know.

326
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,330
Sorry for

327
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,060
fightin' you.

328
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,300
Oh, that's fine.

329
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,070
Um...

330
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,280
They're pretty.

331
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,380
Found them 'round here.

332
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,350
Thank you.

333
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,360
Bye.

334
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,200
Just as the planted crop

335
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,060
is harvested in its own time,

336
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,130
so too has the lord planted us.

337
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,410
Good lord.

338
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,210
The good lord, the good lord

339
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,950
will finish his work in us.

340
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,390
So, in closing, i urge you all to take heart,

341
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,260
for god is at work in your life,

342
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,130
and he will not stop until his job is done. Amen?

343
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,600
Amen. Dismissed!

344
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,480
It seems like it's been forever

345
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,410
since I last seen you.

346
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,580
There were a few miles between us.

347
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,320
Just feels like so many more.

348
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,250
How is it there?

349
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:41,190
It's fine. Not like what I come from 'fore here.

350
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,400
Most days I'm just tending to miss Elizabeth

351
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,170
or fetching this-that for miss Catherine.

352
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,610
You know if y'all coming back next week for church?

353
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,540
I know as much as you.

354
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,740
I suppose if missus is suggesting it,

355
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,350
master Reese don't mind the trip.

356
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,380
I sure wouldn't wanna wait another season to see ya.

357
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,350
Me, neither.

358
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,140
My Nana got it from my grandaddy.

359
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,470
She brought it with her when she was taken from Africa.

360
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,610
Said it was the only thing that kept her mind free.

361
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,080
It's pretty.

362
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,690
I want you to have it.

363
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,500
In case I don't see you for a while, you

364
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,230
have something that reminds you of me.

365
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,840
I don't know if it's right I take it.

366
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,610
'Sides, I don't have nothing to give you

367
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,580
to remind you of me.

368
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,080
I spend all my time thinkin' about you already.

369
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,120
Cherry?

370
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,820
Come help with momma. It's time to go.

371
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,400
Who there?

372
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,410
Nat?

373
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,750
What are you doin'?

374
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,430
I shoulda done that earlier.

375
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,530
You came here to kiss me?

376
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,910
No, no, no.

377
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,240
I ain't got much.

378
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,380
My faith, momma, Nana.

379
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,450
Up until now, enough.

380
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:31,720
Cherry, I'd feel right honored if you'd be my wife.

381
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:36,560
I'd treat ya right. Protect ya with my life.

382
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,460
If you'd have me.

383
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,700
Yes. Yes, I will.

384
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,490
What now?

385
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,750
Uh...

386
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,260
I talk it over with Samuel.

387
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,960
Get us a cabin set up when y'all visit.

388
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,830
All right.

389
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,020
 Heavenly father.  We are gathered here today

390
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,920
to join together these two children,

391
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,660
who have found the love that exists in you.

392
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,290
The love that surrounds all of us all the time.

393
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:43,800
We bless these children together with our hands

394
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,000
that the love that flows through our hands...

395
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
Well, hello, reverend.

396
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,700
I wasn't expecting to see you around

397
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,960
these parts 'till Sunday.

398
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,830
What brings you around the middle of the week?

399
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,830
Never a wrong time...

400
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,400
...to bring a blessing to a brother in Christ.

401
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,600
Oh lord.

402
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,510
Is this blessing gonna cost me money?

403
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,510
Not a penny. To the contrary, in fact.

404
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,780
Isaiah, run us out a water.

405
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,610
Gin, if you please.

406
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,480
So, I put the word out about your preacher.

407
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,960
Got a couple of farmers willing to turn a good coin.

408
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,830
- Is that right?   - Mmm-hmm.

409
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:51,060
Every bit counts these days.

410
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,530
Oh.

411
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,840
Ah!

412
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,610
Mmm.

413
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,740
If your boy does to their liking,

414
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,380
you could get outta debt.

415
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,450
Save your farm.

416
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,120
And all I gotta do is let nat preach.

417
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,390
That's it.

418
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:20,390
Now, I'm not vouching for the character of these fellas.

419
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,560
What business they runnin' or how.

420
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,630
I'm just here to tell you

421
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,460
that there's an opportunity there.

422
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,400
One you got the means to capitalize on.

423
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,170
Whereabouts we talkin'?

424
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,100
In southampton, at the start.

425
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,640
Well, sounds good enough.

426
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,040
I'll send you the details.

427
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,510
Names, locations, and dates, I'd say by tomorrow.

428
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,150
You already booked the dates.

429
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,920
I figured you'd say yes.

430
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,750
What's in it for you?

431
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,060
The pure joy of knowing that I'm helping a brother.

432
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,460
And, uh... Oh, here it comes.

433
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,160
Well, if I was to receive a gift offering,

434
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,430
I certainly wouldn't object.

435
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,000
You are caution, reverend.

436
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,840
I am but a servant.

437
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,480
Here's some salt pork and some tomatoes

438
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,780
for when you get hungry.

439
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,850
Thank you, momma.

440
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,620
Don't y'all go getting' worried now.

441
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,160
I'll be back directly.

442
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,960
I know.

443
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,530
Pray the lord brings you back safe.

444
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,140
You massa Turner's nigger?

445
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,910
I'm nat.

446
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,910
Massa Turner's in here.

447
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,680
Come on.

448
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,630
- We're here?  - Yes, sir.

449
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,100
Sam Turner.

450
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,000
Made it right on time. Joseph Randall.

451
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,300
This here's abner.

452
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,710
This little one? Jasper.

453
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,880
This the preacher? Yes, sir.

454
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,540
Nat?

455
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,550
Evening, sir.

456
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,050
He's a little young, ain't he?

457
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,720
Why, he's old enough.

458
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,280
You've been studying the word awhile, haven't you?

459
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,600
Studyin'?

460
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,190
I can barely train my niggers to learn their own names.

461
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,090
Come on!

462
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,300
 It's hard times

463
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,700
 for small farmers  like you and myself.

464
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,840
Breakin' even's hard enough,

465
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,740
but getting ahead's impossible.

466
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,000
So to save some,

467
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,310
I cut them back to a meal a day per head now.

468
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,350
A few of them started getting' fidgety,

469
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,010
so I had abner come down on 'em.

470
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,980
Abner, here, he's my only real protection.

471
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,890
Now, they needs to mind me. You speak on that.

472
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,920
They treasure in heaven from submittin' and all.

473
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,130
If they gets to moanin' or carryin' on,

474
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,760
ou don't pay 'em no mind,

475
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,230
because they lazy as all hell.

476
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,930
They do anything to get outta work.

477
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,670
You ready, boy?

478
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,950
Listen up! Got a preacher here tonight.

479
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,020
Come here, boy.

480
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,290
Now, he's a nigger here like y'all,

481
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,960
and he's here to talk to you about the lord.

482
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,700
So you listen to him

483
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,200
and you might just make it into heaven, you hear?

484
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,070
Brothers and sisters.

485
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:06,110
I lead you to Peter 2:18.

486
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:12,850
"Slaves, submit yourselves

487
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:17,190
"to your masters with all respect."

488
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,090
"Not only to those who are good and considerate,

489
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,400
"but also to those who are harsh."

490
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,040
You sure you don't wanna stay the night?

491
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,710
Got some fine Brandy

492
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,380
and a couple of choice wenches in the cellar.

493
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,720
Get abner here to strike out the fiddle

494
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,220
and sit around the fire, tell some old lies, huh?

495
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,720
No. We best be gettin' back before sun go down.

496
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,890
All right. Suit yourself.

497
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,330
Would take a bottle of that Brandy,

498
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,730
if you could spare it.

499
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,900
Oh, sure thing. Abner?

500
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,770
I got a chocolate one here

501

514
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,510
Momma offered you one of hers?

515
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,450

00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000

517
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,070

518
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,540

519
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,080
That's me.

520
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:56,080
My momma,

521
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,180
she put this dress on me

522
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:03,490

526
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:17,370
And that she was somewhere,

527
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:21,440
missing me and loving me.

528
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,380
I was 13.

529
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,220
I can call ya Madison, if ya like.

530
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,390
You can call me whatever you want.

531
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,490
I'll call you queen.

532
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,300
What's wrong?

533
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,240
We're gonna have a baby.

534
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,610
A baby?

535
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,310

539
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,330
I ain't mad.

540
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,550

569
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,470

00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,810

00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,300
Mmm.

581
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,270
Lotta Yankees makin' their way down that way.

582
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,410
Rabble-rousin', stirring shit on our way of life.

583
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:55,280
They're pullin' that same shit.

584
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,850
Earl. Got a little problem.

585
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,700
Which one? This one.

586
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,400
How long?

587
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,270
Mmm. About a day or so.

588
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:28,380
You ain't gonna eat, hmm?

589
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,880
You gonna eat? Come on. You ain't gonna eat?

590
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,420
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

591
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,860
All right.

592
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,630
If it ain't one thing, it's another.

593
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,380
You wonderin' why we could use that nigger of yours?

594
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,890
You're seein' it firsthand. All right, get his mouth open.

595
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,390
Well, if it ain't the yanks...

596
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,490
...it's the drought.

597
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:16,490
If not the drought...

598
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,460
...it's goddamn mutiny.

599
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,470
Get a funnel in there.

600
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,960
Truth is, even the meanest nigger's

601
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,630
fearful of the gospel.

602
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,630
Maybe a good word from your boy there,

603
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:56,030
discipline word,go a lot furtherthan my pistol would.

604
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,940
Nat's a good preacher.

605
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,270
I don't right care how good he is,

606
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,880
long as he say what he's supposed to.

607
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,900
Brethren.

608
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:40,740
I pray you sing to the lord

609
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,520
a new song.

610
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:53,860
Sing praise in assembly of the righteous.

611
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,900
Let the saints be joyful in glory.

612
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,860
Let them sing aloud on their beds.

613
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:01,970
Let the high praise of god

614
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:03,500
be on the mouths of the saints,

615
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,340
and a two-edge sword in their hand

616
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,840
to execute vengeance on the demonic nations,

617
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,510
and punishmenton those peoples

618
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,440
to bind their kingswith chains

619
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,710
and their nobleswith fetters of iron

620
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,880
to execute on them this written judgment.

621
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,880
This honor hath all his saints!

622
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,120
Praise the lord!

623
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:24,020
Praise the lord! Sing to him a new song!

624
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,620
Praise the lord! Praise the lord!

625
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,490
Don't suppose you got a pass anywhere

626
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,620
underneath that pretty dress.

627
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,300
No, sir.

628
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:05,660

629
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,530
You sassin' me, girl?

00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,400
No, sir.

631
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,640
Anybody that knows nothin' knows that state law says

632
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,840
that if a nigger's less than 10 paces from a tree line,

633
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,010

Well, sir, I can get one.

635
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,680

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,850
Either you gonna show me a pass,

637
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:27,520
or you gonna show me somethin' else.

638
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,090
What?

639
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,690
I'm sorry to disturb ya,

640
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,800
but nat's gotta talk to you.

641
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,960
Somethin' awful had happened.

642
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:41,100

643

I'll get to it in the mornin'.

644
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,870

648
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:57,820
I'm right here, sir.

649
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,550
Might as well come in then.

650
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:05,460
Sir, I am awfully sorry about all this. I...

651
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,590
What is it, nat?

652
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,890

653
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,060
Whatcha mean hurt?

654
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,230
A group of men, sir.

655
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,210
Isaiah, fetch me some paper. Yeah.

656
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,140
All right, you should go down there.

657
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:30,010
Take Jupiter, but don't start no trouble.

658
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,050
Stay the night, come back first thing in the morning.

659
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:36,650
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

660
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,010
God's gonna punish whoever did this.

661
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,950
Monsters.

662
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,080
Nat?

663
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,740

664
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,650
I'm right here.

665
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,590
It's me now.

666
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:17,090

667
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:21,960
I'm sorry.

668
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,260
No, no. You don't apologize.

669
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:28,670
You don't owe that to nobody.

670
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:36,140
You need to tell me who done this to you.

671
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,780
'Cause I'm gonna take care of it, you hear?

672
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:41,040
On my soul.

673
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,220
I need you to tell me now.

674
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:18,250
"Put up again thy sword into his place.

675
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:24,350
"For all they that take the sword

676
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,720
"shall pass with the sword."

677
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,730
You taught me that.

678
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,900
I need you here.

679
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,270
Joanna, too.

680
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,910
Leave this to the lord.

681
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,460
You wanted to see me, sir?

682
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,970
Yeah. How's cherry?

683
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,840
I'm believin' she'll be fine.

684
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,810
Good. Good.

685
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,010
Not many woulda let you go like I did.

686
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:23,850
Thank you, sir.

687
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:24,980
Mmm.

688
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,850
We're having a big get-together tonight

689
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:29,890
with a lot of very important people.

690
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,720
Kind of like when daddy was alive.

691
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,990
So I'm gonna need you and a couple of others in the house.

692
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:36,460
Anyone who's had experience

693
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,000
servin' and being respectable help.

694
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,800
Yes, sir.

695
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,070
Can't tell ya how important this is for all of us.

696
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:45,300
If we get this right,

697
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,440
the Turner name will mean something again.

698
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,380
Isaiah.

699
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:55,810
Yes, sir.

700
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,200
As you all know, this annual dinner

701
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,430
was a tradition of our daddy many years ago.

702
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,500
And for all he believed, he placed family, faith,

703
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,910
and tradition at the top of his priority list.

704
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,270
Twenty years later,

705
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,180
those same priorities have kept this property afloat.

706
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,350
That and the cash down from your colored preacher.

707
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:05,420
Yeah! That, too.

708
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,880
May god continue to bless all of us

709
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:09,350
for many generations to come.

710
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:13,160
Hear, hear.

711
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,990
Nat, would you please lead us in prayer?

712
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,530
Reverend, I trust you wouldn't mind.

713
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,900
I guess not.

714
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,340
Heavenly father.

715
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,150
We come to thank you for your word and your will.

716
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,280
We pray for and thank you

717
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:44,190
for your protection and your promise.

718
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,560
And in our obedience,

719
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,490
you will be an enemy to our enemies.

720
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,200
That you will oppose those who oppose us.

721
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,040
Continue to guide us, o lord,

722
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,210
and we will continue to follow.

723
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:06,880
Through fine tribulation we will push forward,

724
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,110
recognizing only you as our source and strength.

725
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,050
In your holy name we pray.

726
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:18,050
Amen.

727
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:20,190
Bon appetit.

728
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,360
Daddy always said,

729
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,060
"three black peppercorns in a glass of port,

730
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:28,400
"and you got yourself a excellent digestif."

731
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,570
Well, black is always tasty.

732
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:36,470
Especially a nice piece of black meat. Sweet. Juicy.

733
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,480
I ain't doin' it, all right?

734
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,240
Naw, naw. I need you to get out of here!

735
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:45,550
Ain't gonna happen, man. You just come out here...

736
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:48,390
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Ho, ho, ho!

737
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:50,420
What's goin' on, huh?

738
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,660
- I ain't doin' it.  - Huh?

739
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,590
- I ain't doin' it, nat.  - Doin' what?

740
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:55,430
He'd have to lynch me first.

741
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,630
Lynch ya? What are we talkin' about?

742
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:02,000
One of Samuel's guests...

743
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,040
What?

744
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:11,240
One of Samuel's guests requested Esther, and, uh...

745
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,650
Just go and talk to Samuel. Just tell him what happened.

746
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,550
Tell him what it was and he'll straighten this out.

747
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:26,120
But Samuel sent me over here personally, nat.

748
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,290
I can't do it, nat. I won't.

749
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,060
Brother hark...

750
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,530
But, what... Who are you?

751
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:35,130
Brother hark, do you think

752
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:38,400
that I wanna come over here for this?

753
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,370
You here, ain't ya?

754
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,340
Nat!

755
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,410
Where is she?

756
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:49,450
Samuel, sir. Please, you can't do this.

757
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,020
Everything all right?

758
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,990
Oh, it's just fine.

759
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:58,590
I'll be inside directly.

760
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:00,320
I hope you won't be alone.

761
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:05,330
I assure you, i will not be.

762
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:07,700
If you mess this up for me, my hand to god,

763
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,000
I will lynch every one of you come mornin!

764
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,630
Do you understand me?

765
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,640
Fetch her.

766
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,740
Yes, sir.

767
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,770
It's okay.

768
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:34,320
Where is he, nat? Where's god now?

769
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,830
Hark.

770
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:57,740
Excuse me.

771
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:01,850
I'm looking for a preacher named nat.

772
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,250
He's been banned from every church

773
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,000
in the county for his sins.

774
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:07,180
He's lucky that's all he got for what he done.

775
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:10,120
The world has its way with dealing with the immoral.

776
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,520
Above all those who cast that immorality

777
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,290
on the children as he has.

778
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:19,130
But no one is without sin, miss Elizabeth.

779
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:22,130
And this man wants to repent and be delivered.

780
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:26,800
As a Shepherd of the lord, it's my duty to serve.

781
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:28,440
So...

782
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:32,640
I'd like to baptize him.

783
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,710
The hell you will!

784
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:35,350
Jethro, you will mind your mouth.

785
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:36,580
With respect, miss Elizabeth,

786
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,200
a nigger can't baptize no white man.

787
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:42,700
I just think we should wait for Mr. Samuel to get back.

788
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,400
Jethro, go wait in the front yard.

789
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:46,290
Mr. Samuel gets back, he'll have both of us!

790
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,560
I won't ask you again.

791
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,400
Boy, you gonna get it.

792
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:59,340
Are you sure you want to do this, nat?

793
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,500
Samuel may not like it.

794
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:04,340
Nor will a lot of other folks around here.

795
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:07,810
Don't got too much choice, missus.

796
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:11,180
This man still belongs to god.

797
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:14,350
When you stand between the lord and his people,

798
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:16,890
it's a dangerous place to be.

799
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:20,580
We've been good to you. My whole family has.

800
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:23,750
And you go on and do something like this to me.

801
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,760
A nigger baptizing a white man on my property!

802
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,590
Do you know how this makes us look?

803
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:33,400
This could ruin everything we worked for!

804
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,500
Boy, you better say something and quick!

805
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,270
"Take heed therefore unto yourselves,

806
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:41,500
"and to all the flock over which

807

826
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,020
Get him to the post.

827
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:40,960
Hey, boy.

828
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:47,400
If you make it out of this alive,

829
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:51,100
I'm gonna ride you harder than hogs on slop.

830
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,110
Die.

831
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,780
You learned your lesson, boy?

832
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:21,120
Oh, yes, sir, I've learned.

833
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:23,790
Go on, get him off.

834
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,890
You're done preachin' for a little while.

835
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,900
And I don't want you runnin' off with any groups,

836
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,730
unless me and Jethro are there, you understand?

837
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:38,170
Yes, sir.

838
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:40,240
All right, go and get yourself cleaned up.

839
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,970
Be back in the field come morning.

840
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:00,990
Brother, you all right?

841
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:05,760
Hey! Hey!

842
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,750
I watched your grandfather die

843
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:25,110
in old land.

844
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,350
Saw him give up the ghost with my own eyes.

845
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:34,220
And he saw me.

846
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:37,030
He harnessed the holy spirit that day.

847
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:39,900
Yes, he did.

848
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,160
I was proud of him.

849
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,840
So proud.

850
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,400
I still thank god

851
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:52,910
that he died that day.

852
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:56,250
That he didn't live to see the things I seen.

853
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,990
To watch a strong man broken down

854
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:08,160
is a terrible thing.

855
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:45,460
Hey, Nana.

856
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:54,040
The stitches held up good.

857
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,350
Nana?

858
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:13,420
You all right?

859
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,990
Mostly.

860
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:35,470
I need you to round up a few men you trust.

861
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,140
Have them meet us at the big cypress

862
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:39,810
at cabin pond night after next.

863
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:44,850
Hark.

864
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,450
He's still here, brother.

865
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:51,020
Even now.

866
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:12,110
This is Simon.

867
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:14,910
Samuel bought him a month back in Norfolk.

868
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:16,910
I remember. Welcome, brother.

869
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:18,410
And you know Nelson.

870
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,980
Welcome.

871
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:22,350
This is will.

872
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:26,520
Word travels fast. Welcome.

873
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,460
Hey! This grown folk's business! Get! Get!

874
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,130
Hold on.

875
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:34,060
Come on over here.

876
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,440
Come from Randall's? Yes, sir.

877
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,140
He's just a boy.

878
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:44,510
So was David.

879
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:48,880
Come on. Have a seat.

880
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:03,160
I've been following the lord a long time.

881
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:07,030
Preachin', citing scripture,

882
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:09,570
sharing the gospel from the few pages

883
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:11,600
and sections I've been allowed.

884
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,900
But I've gone back through this word, all of it.

885
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:17,040
With new eyes.

886
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,910
I see now, for every verse

887
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:20,440
they use to support our bondage,

888
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,610
there's another demanding our freedom.

889
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:27,050
Every verse they use to justify our torture,

890
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:30,120
there's another damning them to hell for those actions.

891
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:35,990
Lord has spoken to me. Visions of what's to come.

892
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:38,530
A rise of good against evil.

893
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:42,260
The first shall be last, and the last shall be first.

894
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,470
Brothers, we've been chosen.

895
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:50,410
What are we gonna do?

896
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:52,370
Same as David and Gideon

897
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:56,710
and Joshua and Samson.

898
01:18:56,710 --> 01:18:59,010
We'll fight. The six of us?

899
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:01,120
At first. But once it begins,

900
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,520
our brothers and sisters will join.

901
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,120
There's a whole lot of whites.

902
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,960
How many slaves you think there are in the county?

903
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,560
On all the plantations? How many whites?

904
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,030
But they got guns.

905
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:12,390
We'll take the armory in Jerusalem.

906
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,130
We'll have guns, too.

907
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:15,730
Jerusalem?

908
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:18,370
That's right. It's only 10 miles north.

909
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:19,670
We'll start right here at Turner's

910
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:21,240
and fight our way there.

911
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,110
By then we'll number in the hundreds,

912
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:25,040
thousands even.

913
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,740
The grapevine's ablaze with talks of fightin'.

914
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:30,310
Slaves all over havin' meetins'.

915
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:32,250
They waitin' on something.

916
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,620
They waitin' on us.

917
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:38,650
We make a stop at Fowler place?

918
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,490
We will.

919
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:44,290
I'm with you.

920
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,530
Me, too.

921
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,500
- When we fight?  - Soon.

922
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,770
The lord will give us a sign.

923
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:51,430
Until then we remain steadfast,

924
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,270
ready to strike at the moment of the lord's call.

925
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:56,170
With the strength of our father,

926
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:57,640
we'll cut the head from the serpent.

927
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:01,210
We'll destroy them all.

928
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:32,500
Somethin' wrong?

929
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:36,180
There was a meeting a few nights ago.

930
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:38,810
And although I was not privy to what was said,

931
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:41,320
I can only assume

932
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:45,290
by the secrecy that it was not altogether productive.

933
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:04,740
 Now,  I don't know what ideas

934
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:08,340
 is floatin' around  in your head,

935
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:10,580
 but I been around here  long enough to know

936
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:12,680
that the result of certain ideas

937
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,850
is not gonna get you what you want.

938
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:17,350
All I want,

939
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:19,520
I want for the oppressed people of god.

940
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,120
You want death for them?

941
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:24,460
For your wife?

942
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,430
For your daughter?

943
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:28,700
If it be god's will.

944
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,770
God's will?

945
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:34,200
And who determined you

946
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:36,170
to be the instrument of such a thing?

947
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,870
He has.

948
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,550
You just make sure that he's the one doin' the orderin'.

949
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:50,550
Man of god is called to lead in love.

950
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:53,790
Anything else will leave us all worse off.

951
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:57,390
He is a god of love, nat.

952
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:59,900
Don't you forget that.

953
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,900
I won't.

954
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:05,170
Nor will I forget he's a god of wrath.

955
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:18,750
Mmm...

956
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:34,500
The lord's calling me.

957
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,370
To stand and fight.

958
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:52,210
I knew this day would come.

959
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:58,350
I told myself i wouldn't be scared.

960
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,460
All my life,

961
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:07,200
I've been praying for the lord to help us

962
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,370
or to send someone who could.

963
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,470
We all have.

964
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:19,210
Just wasn't expecting it to be my own husband.

965
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:34,490
If the lord's called you to fight,

966
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,890
you fight.

967
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:41,560
You fight for me,

968
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,730
and Joanna.

969
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:51,410
You fight for us all.

970
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:52,980
Hmm?

971
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:04,650
Who's there?

972
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:11,420
Nat?

973
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:12,990
Yes.

974
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:33,840
Wait, goddamnit!

975
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,680
Damn it!

976
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:18,650
Momma?

977
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:23,990
Momma.

978
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:28,920
Nat? Oh lord, i slept too late.

979
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:30,930
No, no... Momma.

980
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:35,000
You won't have to work today.

981
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:37,670
You free.

982
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:48,080
The battle's begun, ma.

983
01:27:49,110 --> 01:27:51,010
Simon.

984
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:56,950
Simon will take you to Reese's.

985
01:27:56,950 --> 01:27:58,850
And I need you to take care of cherry and Joanna

986
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,820
'till I get back, you hear?

987
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,190
What's wrong?

988
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,960
Nothing.

989
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:10,830
I'm proud of you.

990
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:30,650
What did you do, boy? Huh?

991
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,790
Huh? You killed them, boy?

992
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:34,890
Is that what you did?

993
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:38,730
ou kill them and you kill us!

994
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:46,540
You killed all of us.

995
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:49,740
We already dead. We already dead!

996
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:53,680
You dead.

997
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:56,010
We already dead.

998
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:02,250
We dead now!

999
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:10,560
Your

1000
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,560
earthly master is gone.

1001
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:18,700
You're now free men and women,

1002
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,270
servants of only the lord.

1003
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:25,570
As the sword of the lord bears down on our enemies,

1004
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:28,180
our ancestors and unborn children rejoice.

1005
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,780
Are we dead?

1006
01:29:35,050 --> 01:29:38,720
No. I say we are now alive,

1007
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,690
seeing through eyes that have been denied us

1008
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:43,790
since being born into the darkness of bondage.

1009
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,000
Stand with us.

1010
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:49,330
Let your other captive brothers and sisters

1011
01:29:49,330 --> 01:29:50,730
also know freedom.

1012
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:52,270
Stand that our children

1013
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:53,870
for generations to come will know

1014
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:55,370
that with the supernatural power of god,

1015
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:56,740
we straightened our backs

1016
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,940
against the works of the evil one!

1017
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:03,140
Stand with us.

1018
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:59,000
Can I do this myself?

1019
01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:59,930
The boy! He gone!

1020
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:10,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1021
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:31,830
Get down!

1022
01:32:34,230 --> 01:32:35,900
Hey, preacher!

1023
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,400
Hark!

1024
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,400
Are you out there?

1025
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,040
Tell the men to fall back.

1026
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,770
What?

1027
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:44,110
If we have a gun battle now,

1028
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:45,310
we'll never make it to Jerusalem.

1029
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:46,410
Me and my boys is ready!

1030
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:47,780
I want my revenge!

1031
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:49,010
This ain't about revenge, hark!

1032
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:52,110
You all gonna hang! You hear me?

1033
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,980
All of ya!

1034
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,250
The root,

1035
01:32:58,260 --> 01:32:59,450
not the branch.

1036
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:03,260
We must stay focused, brother.

1037
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:08,930
Will! Fall back! C'mon! C'mon, y'all. C'mon.

1038
01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:11,070
Let's fall back, y'all!

1039
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:37,530
You all right?

1040
01:33:40,230 --> 01:33:42,360
It's all of us.

1041
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:43,500
This it?

1042
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,190
Hark, what time you think it is?

1043
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:09,260
5:30, 5:35.

1044
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:12,360
What?

1045
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,870
By now I'd be two rows down,

1046
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:22,400
half a bag full.

1047
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:25,340
I'd be headed to the barn,

1048
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:27,340
gettin' ready to feed the stock.

1049
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:29,480
I'd be boiling water in the smokehouse,

1050
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,510
thinkin' 'bout dumping on massa's head.

1051
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,280
I'd be tying the barrels, sealin' cracks.

1052
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:37,420
Checkin' the leaves and straw.

1053
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:40,520
Packin' and stackin' 'em up.

1054
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:43,590
Dodgin' that cracker's lash.

1055
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:48,160
Not today.

1056
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:50,160
No, sir.

1057
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:52,500
Not today.

1058
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,170
On to Jerusalem?

1059
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:00,580
On to Jerusalem.

1060
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:02,110
On to Jerusalem!

1061
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,300
All right, this is how this is gonna work.

1062
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,710
You're gonna throw the weapons to the ground,

1063
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:33,440
then you're gonna lie down.

1064
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:37,510
Do it.

1065
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:42,680
The lord is our light and our salvation.

1066
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:44,990
Of whom we shall fear?

1067
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:48,620
Throw your weapons to the ground!

1068
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:51,960
The lord is the strength of our lives.

1069
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,230
Of whom shall we be afraid?

1070
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:59,370
When the wicked, even our enemies

1071
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:00,740
and our foes came upon us

1072
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:03,500
to eat up our flesh, they stumbled and fell!

1073
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:05,070
Goddamn, niggers.

1074
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:06,570
Though a host shall encamp against us,

1075
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:08,510
our hearts will not fear!

1076
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:09,610
Ready!

1077
01:36:09,610 --> 01:36:10,750
Though war shall rise against us,

1078
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,380
in this we will be confident!

1079
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:14,050
Aim!

1080
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:18,520
Rebel!

1081
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:45,540
Come on!

1082
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:01,520
Get down!

1083
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,590
Will!

1084
01:38:57,810 --> 01:38:59,750
Get back!

1085
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:13,160
I'm all right.

1086
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,380
Cherry.

1087
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:52,750
It's nat, love.

1088
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:56,060
Keep on workin'.

1089
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,070
They lookin' for you.

1090
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:09,770
They hurt you?

1091
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:12,770
No.

1092
01:42:14,110 --> 01:42:16,080
How's Joanna?

1093
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:19,780
She fine.

1094
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,550
Momma?

1095
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:24,790
She fine, too.

1096
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:29,420
Keep on workin' now.

1097
01:42:30,590 --> 01:42:32,690
Any word on the other men?

1098
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:34,700
They been hanged.

1099
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:36,960
All of them.

1100
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,740
They killin' people everywhere

1101
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:44,640
for no reason at all but being black.

1102
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:51,380
They say the killin' won't stop

1103
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:53,810
'till they get you.

1104
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:03,120
All these months

1105
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,830
I thought...

1106
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:15,140
I thought you were dead, too.

1107
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:20,140
I'm here, love.

1108
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:23,140
I'll always be.

1109
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:32,150
I miss you so much.

1110
01:43:38,630 --> 01:43:40,490
Cherry?

1111
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:43,160
Who you talkin' to?

1112
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:48,870
I's just talkin' to myself.

1113
01:43:52,570 --> 01:43:55,040
Wishin' things was different.

1114
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:40,920
Hey!

1115
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:49,560
That's him right there!

1116
01:44:49,570 --> 01:44:51,500
Kill that nigger!

1117
01:44:56,910 --> 01:45:00,110
I know you're angry. Trust me, I am too.

1118
01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:04,650
This boy committed mass murder and will hang for all to see.

1119
01:45:04,650 --> 01:45:06,250
Get him up.

1120
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:36,770
Go to hell!

1121
01:46:38,370 --> 01:46:40,070
Animal!

1122
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:07,640
Hang him!

1123
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:23,020
Is there something you wanna say

1124
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:24,920
to these good people?

1125
01:47:32,330 --> 01:47:33,730
I'm ready.
