在我们祖先那时候

A child's position in the tribe was left to the maker.

孩子的方位标志显现要早于大人
Children bearing marks were brought before the elders

8
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,450
这儿，它们是被赐予的标记

他会是个先知
He is a prophet.

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,920
我们应该听从他

18
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,990
我们应该听从他
We should listen to him.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
一个国家的诞生

20

再见

29
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,920
你就像蝙蝠的眼睛
You so much as bat an eye,

30
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,660
我要把你从这打回地狱去
I'm gonna blow you from here to hell.

31
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,720
你在外面做什么，伙计？

32
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,190
从我的主人那装点食物

33
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,830
本杰明 特纳

34
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,660
在午夜时间？转过来

35
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,740
你的通行许可在哪？

拿过来，快点
Bring it on. C'mon! Bring it!

37
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,880
退回去
Get back.

38
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,920
你觉得你比我聪明，是不是？
You think you're smarter than me, don't you, boy?

39
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,150
没有，先生
No, sir.

40
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,650
杰西，我们怎么叫黑鬼的
Jesse, who do we call a nigger

41
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,160
谁会觉得他比一个白人更精明？

42
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,990
死了的黑鬼
A dead nigger.

43
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,790
转过来

44
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,730
跪下
On your knees.

45
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,000
这是你自己找的
You done this to yourself, boy.

46
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,630
- 发生什么了？ － 上床去
- What happened?  - Go on to bed.

47
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,360
我偷食物被抓了
I got caught stealing food.

48
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,030
我杀了看守，我得逃走了

49
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,800
你照顾好你母亲和娜娜，知道吗？
You take care of your mom and Nana, you hear?

50
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,100
你是神的孩子
You a child of god.

51
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,040
你意志坚定
You got purpose. It's in you.

52
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,910
上帝把它放在了这
The lord put it there,

53
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,840
没有任何人和事可以把它们夺走
and there ain't nothing nobody can do to take it away.

54
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,080
你明白了？
You hear?

55
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,380
是的
Yes, sir.

56
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,920
现在你上床去
Now you go ahead on and go to bed.

57
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,890
我可能快点回来
I'll be back for y'all as soon as I can.

58
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,000
回床上去，我们睡觉
Go on back to bed. Go on to bed, girl! We sleep!

59
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,420
布里奇特，南希，起来了
Bridget! Nancy! Y'all wake up!

60
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,950
艾萨克有大麻烦了
Isaac's in a lot of trouble.

61
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,420
我需要你们当中的人告诉我他去哪里了
I need one of y'all to tell me where he is.

62
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,290
不知道去哪了，主人，我们一晚没见他
Don't know where he is, massa. We ain't seen him all night.

63
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,360
你确定
You sure?

64
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,430
本，我命令你离开
Ben, I'm gonna ask you to leave.

65
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,130
- 嗯？ - 今晚一个白人丧命了
- Huh?  - A white man has lost his life tonight.

66
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,840
你知道这样说代表着接下去要发生什么样的事，走
You know like I do what that mean. Get!

67
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,770
现在，我要给他们些颜色看看
Now, any harm done to these people,

68
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,440
我要报告警长，我是认真的
I'm gonna call the sheriff! I'm serious!

69
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,450
你们没人知道他在那？
None of y'all know where he is, huh?

70
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,720
没有，先生
No, sir.

71
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,490
他妈的
Goddamnit.

72
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,730
你知道吗，孩子？
What about you, boy?

73
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,930
他也什么不知道
He don't know nothing, either.

74
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,340
你父亲在那？
Where's your daddy at?

75
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,320
听着，你不告诉我他在那
Now listen, you don't tell me where he's at,

76
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,050
其它人也会找到他
someone else is gonna find him,

77
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,190
他们会杀了他
and they gonna kill him.

78
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,760
你告诉我，我会安全把他带回来
You tell me, I'll go get him.I'll bring him back here safe.

79
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,830
好吗？
All right?

80
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,830
告诉我你父亲在哪
Tell me where daddy's at.

81
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,270
说话，不要一言不发
Say it. Spit something outta that mouth! Say it!

82
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,310
告诉我在哪
Tell me where he's at!

83
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,380
他妈的
Goddamnit.

84
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,220
你是那个黑鬼的孩子，好吧
You that nigger's boy, all right.

85
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,120
如果让我发现你在说谎
If I find out y'all's been lying,

86
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,790
我会再回来的，到时我就不客气了
I'm gonna come back here, i ain't gonna be so nice...

87
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,800
主人，不要，不要，上帝啊！
Oh, massa, please! Please! Massa, please! Oh, lord!

88
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,530
够了，住手
All right, that's... That's enough! Stop!

89
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,530
你最好教教那个孩子礼貌
You best teach that boy some manners.

90
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,200
下次，他要用眼睛看着我
Next time he look me in the eye,

91
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,440
你父亲也会是这个结果
you gonna get the same thing what waitin' for his pa.

92
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,290
可以帮你吗？
Mind if I help you?

93
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
不用了
No, ma'am.

94
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,970
萨缪尔告诉我早上的事情了
Samuel told me something this morning

95
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,430
我想要向你打听下
I wanted to ask you about.

96
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,910
他说纳特知道怎么读
He said, nat knows how to read.

97
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,410
纳特不知道怎么读
Nat don't not know how to read.

98
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,480
做为我自己是不相信的
Part of me couldn't believe it myself.

99
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,310
所以我测试了他
So I tested him.

100
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
十分肯定
Sure enough,

101
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,890
他就在哪大声朗读
there he was sounding out letters.

102
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,260
你明天午饭后把他带来
You have him come by the house tomorrow after lunch.

103
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,130
他没有恶意
He don't mean no harm.

104
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,260
下次我看见他我会抽他一顿
I'ma whip him good the next time I see him.

105
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,000
抽他？不要
Whip him? Nonsense.

106
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,940
我要教育他
I'm gonna teach him.

107
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,440
如果万能的主给了这个孩子阅读的能力
If the good lord gave that boy a gift to read,

108
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,140
我们就不应该怠慢它，浪费它
we'd be remiss to let it go to waste.

109
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,950
你不要希望他能任何时候都能回家
And don't expect him back anytime soon.

110
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,450
他会和我们在主屋一起生活一段时间
He'll be living with us in the main house for a while.

111
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,290
课程最好在开始时就不要被打断
Lessons best not be disturbed in the beginning.

112
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,220
好的，夫人
Yes, ma'am.

113
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,180
没关系，孩子，不是真的
It's okay, baby. It's okay. It ain't real.

114
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,180
不是真的，没事了，它在你的心里
It ain't real. It's all right. It's in your mind.

115
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,250
它在你的心里
It's in your mind.

116
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,550
妈妈在这
Momma's here now.

117
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,560
我要父亲
Want my poppa.

118
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,400
我也是的，孩子
Me too, baby.

119
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,930
我也是
Me too.

120
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,070
把你的手臂穿过去
Put your arms through.

121
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,570
多帅气
How handsome.

122
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,290
他会没事的
He'll be all right.

123
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,620
这些书是给白人看的
These books are for white folks.

124
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,200
这里有着你无法理解的全部事情
They're full of things your kind wouldn't understand.

125
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,300
但是我会让你读一本特别的书
But I do have a special one just for you.

126
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,270
你猜是什么？
And guess what?

127
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,300
是有史以来最好的一本书
It's the best book ever written.

128
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,750
你是个特别的孩子
You're a special boy, Nathaniel.

129
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,650
努力学习听从我的指令，知道吗？
Study hard and heed my instructions, hear?

130
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,150
你的人生
Your life,

131
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,790
将会与众不同
it'll never be the same.

132
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,390
我能预见到
I'll see to that.

133
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,760
是，太太
Yes, missus.

134
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,170
创世纪，开始
"Genesis. In the beginning..."

135
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,340
开始
In the beginning...

136
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,670
这儿，这个词是这儿
Here, this word here, "the."

137
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,080
那是狡猾，机警
That's tricky. Now, these letters "t-h."

138
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,410
无论何时你看见他们
{\rENG} Whenever you see them...

139
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,510
洁净你的双手，罪人们
"...cleanse your hands, ye sinners...

140
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,520
心怀二意的人们，净化你们的心灵
"And purify your hearts, ye double-minded.

141
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,460
被折磨，悲哀，哭泣
"Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep.

142
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,360
让你的笑声变成了悲哀
"Let your laughter be turned to mourning,

143
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,060
和你的快乐变成忧伤
"and your joy to heaviness."

144
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,730
雅各书，第四章，第八至九篇
James 4, chapter 8 and 9.

145
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,190
随我翻到雅各书第一章
Turn with me, if you would, to James 1.

146
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,160
握着耶和华的恩惠
Holding on to the goodness of the lord.

147
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,870
在他去陪伴上帝之前，我曾对本说
I spoke to Ben, before he went on to be with the lord.

148
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,470
他觉得你作为一个农场工人会对我们家庭更有用
He felt you'd be more useful to our family as a field hand.

149
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,420
我很抱歉，纳特
I'm sorry, nat.

150
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,270
现在，你要从这开始
Now, you gonna start here,

151
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,600
你要去远一点的地方开始工作
and you're gonna work your way down yonder.

152
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,640
而我会在这里，明白吗？
And I'll be right over here. You hear?

153
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,420
嗯
Ah!

154
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,410
谢谢你，兄弟
Thank you, brother.

155
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,850
我已经不省人事了，除非我有看见
I had fainted, unless I had believed to see,

156
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,360
上帝的善良
the goodness of the lord

157
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,230
在我们生活的土地上
in the land of the living.

158
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,860
等待上帝的到来
Wait on the lord,

159
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,660
要变的善良勇敢
be of good courage,

160
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,430
他会使你的内心强大
and he shall strengthen thine heart.

161
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,540
等会，我说
Wait, I say,

162
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,610
依靠上帝
on the lord.

163
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,610
让我们低下我们的头颅
Let us bow our heads.

164
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,560
萨姆，那是你姐姐？
Sam, that sister of yours,

165
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,890
真是能成为个好老婆
gonna make a fine wife indeed.

166
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,730
我说的是真的
It's been a true blessing

167
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,900
看着她变成一个女人
seeing her develop into the woman that she is.

168
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,400
这可是个美好的祝福
It'd be an even better blessing

169
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,600
看她和她的母亲
seein' her and momma

170
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,800
她们把脚放在他桌子下而不是我的
put their feet under his table instead of mine.

171
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,750
我得说
I gotta say,

172
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,420
萨姆，你的奴隶确信知道怎么守规矩
Sam, your slaves sure do know how to behave.

173
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,290
每次我来都令我印象深刻
I'm impressed with them every time I come around.

174
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,590
好的，他们当中有个牧师
Well, they god fearin'. One of them's a preacher.

175
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,760
没人告诉我
No one's gotta tell you

176
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,430
干旱的日子真是太难熬了
the times are tough with the drought.

177
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,800
在这个国家对白人来说变得更艰难了
It's gettin' harder for the whites in this county

178
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,600
要给他们的黑人奴隶吃好穿好
to clothe and feed their niggers good.

179
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,610
这些关于暴动的谈论
Talks of insurrection

180
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,840
让白人家伙感到害怕
got folks scared.

181
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,680
我觉得人们应该付出更好的工资报酬
I think people might pay good money

182
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,080
可以让这些人能更冷静些
to have them calm down a bit.

183
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,850
特别是一个他们自己人
Especially by one of their own.

184
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,830
噢
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

185
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,470
你看见一个黑鬼从这跑过吗？
You seen a nigger run past here?

186
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,470
我睡着了没看见
Naw. Then again i doze off for a few.

187
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,740
你看见了吗，孩子？
What about you, boy?

188
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,810
最好现在不要撒谎，你骗不过我的
Best not lie now. I know when y'all's lyin'.

189
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,110
没有，先生
No, sir.

190
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,610
两个比尔琼斯地方的
Couple of niggers went missin'

191
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,980
黑鬼不见了今天早上
off bill Johnson's place this mornin'.

192
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,610
说是在逃跑之前
Say they raised up on an overseer

193
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,550
他们举起了工头
before they took off.

194
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,890
好的，看见什么就告诉我
All right, you see somethin' let us know.

195
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,420
好的

196
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,620
驾
Giddyup.

197
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,000
你把这里结束了，我去广场里面
You finish up here, I'll go square up inside.

198
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,670
好的，先生
Yes, sir.

199
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,020
夫人，杨斯掉了这个
Ma'am. The youngin', he dropped this a step back.

200
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,750
谢谢
Thank ya.

201
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,990
你在干什么那？
Whatcha think you're doin'?

202
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,830
他只是…你和我妻子说话了
He was just tryin'... You spoke to my wife.

203
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,660
你主人在那？
Where's your owner, boy?

204
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,100
问你话那
I asked you a question.

205
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,880
你最好收起你的棍子来
You best goin' to put that stick down now!

206
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,010
我要找警长了
I want the sheriff.

207
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,940
这个家伙羞辱了我
his boy assaulted me!

208
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,580
他羞辱了我妻子
He assaulted my wife!

209
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,750
我要指控他
And I'm bringin' charges!

210
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,850
弗洛伊德警长？
Sheriff Floyd?

211
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,780
好的，他归你了，如果你喜欢
All right, you fetch him if you like.

212
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,050
但同时我数三下
But in the meantime i will give you

213
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,050
你把棍子放下来
to the count of three to put your stick down

214
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,420
在我给你一些真实的指控之前
before I give you some real charges

215
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,660
让他回到这里
to give him when he gets here.

216
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,920
你威胁我
You threatnin' me?

二

219
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,570
走吧，带着孩子
C'mon, get the boy.

220
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,470
回家
Let's get home.

221
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,090
我们的玉米很甜
We got sweet corn!

222
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,560
来吧，来点玉米粉
C'mon now! Get your grits!

223
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,920
我们这玉米很甜

224
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,130
看一看
Here you go.

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,960
在这的这个
And this one here!

226
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,760
强壮如牛
Strong as an ox!

227
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,030
虽然不起眼，但是年轻的体内流动着活力的种子
Nothin' but good seed flowin' from this here buck.

228
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,800
看看他们的牙齿
Look at them teeth. Huh?

229
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,770
我将开始拍卖
I'll start him out at...

230
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,670
两百
200.

231
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,770
一百五
150?

232
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,110
拜托了，我还得在这接着混那
C'mon now, I gotta make a living here, gents.

233
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,240
一百？七十五？
100? 75?

234
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,610
成交，带走吧
Sold! Get outta here.

235
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,020
给他套上束具，带那个女过来
Put a yoke on him. Bring her up here.

236
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:16,190
现在，大家可以考虑下这个标致的乡下妞
Now, consider this comely wench.

237
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,630
不超过十八岁
Not a day over 18.

238
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,630
好吧，我从一百七十五元开始起拍
All right, I'll start her off at 175.

239
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,900
我出一百七十五元，还有出价的吗？
I got 175. Do I hear two?

240
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,640

Now we're talkin'! Do I got 225?

241
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,000

Massa, that wench there sure would make

242
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,640
凯瑟琳小姐

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,740
两百二十五

244
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,040
你一直在说小姐在问你
You keep sayin' she been askin'.

245
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,210
你出两百五吗？
Do I hear 250?

246
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,010
她看着十分年轻，如果你问我的话
She looks right young, if you ask me.

247
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,000
快点！

248
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,850
对的，先生，她很年轻，给我两百五
You right, sir, she young. Gimme 250.

249
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,280
但是如果跟对人的话

00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,820
- 一个像这样的姑娘？ - 两百五

251
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,990

Could be workin' a long time.

252
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,690
两百七十五元
There it is! 275?

253
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,260
主人，我们应该
Massa, sure would be a shame to watch her

254
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,830
用一个低价买了她
go to waste for such a low price.

255
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,030
你知道个屁
And what the hell would you know about

256
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,830
什么是高什么是低？
what's a little and what's a lot, huh?

257
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,900
我不知道你最近怎么了
I don't know what's gotten into you lately,

258
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,570
但不论是什么，你最好放弃
but whatever it is, you better quit.

259
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,840
你看见我看到的了吗？
Are you seein' what I'm seein'?

260
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,670
你带着个回家
You take this one home, you know,

261
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,080
把她洗干净了
clean her up,

262
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,710
不要太久
won't be long before you find yourself

263
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,880
你会比玩球的小狗还要高兴的
happier than a dog with three balls!

264
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,680
笑一笑，贱货
Smile, bitch.

两百七十五两次

271
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,940
卖给后排那个善良的绅士了
Sold to that fine gentleman in the back!

272
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,110
喔
Whoa.

273

我希望你是对的
I sure hope you're right.

275
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,220
你妈给她洗过吃了
Have your momma get her cleaned and fed.

276
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,000
- 先从擦地板开始  - 明白，先生
- Start breakin' her in.  - Yes, sir.

277
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,090
你和汉克可以从北面围栏那开始
You and hark can start on the north fence

278
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,630
- 这是明早的第一件事  - 明白，先生
- first thing in the morning.  - Yes, sir.

279
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,000
我不会伤害你的
I ain't gonna hurt you.

280
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,640
只是爬上来帮你出来
Just gonna climb up and help you out.

281
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,150
没事的
It's all right.

282
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,310
这孩子是谁？发生了什么？
Who is this child? What happened?

283
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,110
活力四射
Burnin' up.

284
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,840
是我的，这是我的裙子
This mine! This my dress! My dress! This my dress!

285
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,050
走开，出去
Go now! Get out, ya!

286
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:57,220
我们不会伤害你
We're not gonna hurt you. We're not gonna hurt you.

287
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,380
不要带走
Don't take it away.

288
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,950
笑一下
You just smile

289
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,820
让他们可以谈话，好吗？
and let them do the talkin'. All right?

290
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,690
好的
Yessum.

291
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,430
中午好，主人，这是切瑞安妮
Afternoon, massa. This here cherry-Ann.

292
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,800
主人
Massa.

293
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,040
凯瑟琳娜
Catherine!

294
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,810
凯瑟琳娜，这是切瑞安妮
Catherine, this here is cherry-Ann.

295
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,980
夫人
Missus.

296
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,750
谢谢你
Oh, thank you!

297
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,050
来吧，见下我母亲
Come on, i want you to meet momma.

298
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,060
母亲
Momma.

299
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,460
谢谢你
Thank you.

300
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,830
为了什么
For what?

301
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:22,030
你让她边得更好更漂亮了
For gettin' her better. For makin' her so beautiful.

302
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,340
我什么也没做
I didn't do nothin'.

303
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,210
那些美貌
That girl was brought into this world

304
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,240
都是那女孩与生俱来的
as beautiful as she could be.

305
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,190
很难过看到你和太太要走了
It sure is sad to see you and the missus go.

306
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,890
我们只是隔了一条路
We'll be just down the road.

307
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,090
当我们都安顿好了
When we get all good and settled,

308
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,360
我们会回来看看的
we'll come back and visit.

309
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,490
周日去教堂之后
On Sundays for church and that.

310
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,230
好吧，不急的
Well, there's no rush.

311
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,860
我开玩笑的，来这
Oh. I'm foolin'. Come here.

312
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,000
如果你有需要
If y'all need anything,

313
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,370
或者他对你不好，让我知道
or he ain't treatin' you right, you let me know.

314
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,300
是的，哥哥，我爱你
Yes, big brother. I love you.

315
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,170
我也爱你
Love you, too.

316
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,940
母亲，你准备好了吗？
Momma, you ready?

317
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,010
我很担心你，萨姆
I'm worried about you, Sam.

318
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,880
你要独自面对这么大的一个地方
This a big place to be out here all by yourself.

319
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,950
我没事的
I'll be fine.

320
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,890
你要小心
You take care now.

321
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,800
好的
All right. Hmm.

322
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,140
主人，为马准备的
Massa. For the horses.

323
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,470
就一个
Just one.

324
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,970
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

325
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,580
嗨
Hi.

326
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,980
嗨
Hi.

327
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,190
我是纳特
I'm nat.

328
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,560
我知道
I know.

329
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,330
不好意思
Sorry for

330
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,060
打扰你了
fightin' you.

331
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,300
没事
Oh, that's fine.

332
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,070
嗯…
Um...

333
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,280
它们很漂亮
They're pretty.

334
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,380
在这四周发现的
Found them 'round here.

335
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,350
谢谢
Thank you.

336
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,360
再见
Bye.

337
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,200
就像我们在
Just as the planted crop

338
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,060
收割庄稼一样
is harvested in its own time,

339
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,130
主也在播种着我们
so too has the lord planted us.

340
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,410
赞美主啊
Good lord.

341
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,210
赞美主啊
The good lord, the good lord

342
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,950
当我们完成了主赐予我们的工作时
will finish his work in us.

343
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,390
最后，我会敦促你们用心来敬奉上帝
So, in closing, i urge you all to take heart,

344
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,260
要用尽你们的一生
for god is at work in your life,

345
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,130
直到它的工作完成才算结束，阿门？
and he will not stop until his job is done. Amen?

346
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,600
阿门，解散
Amen. Dismissed!

347
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,480
仿佛命运已经注定永远
It seems like it's been forever

348
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,410
自从我上次看见你起
since I last seen you.

349
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,580
我们之间虽只有短短的几步
There were a few miles between us.

350
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,320
但我却感觉到很遥远
Just feels like so many more.

351
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,250
在哪过的还好吗？
How is it there?

352
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:41,190
很好，不像我以前待的地方
It's fine. Not like what I come from 'fore here.

353
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,400
多数时间我都是在照顾伊丽莎白小姐
Most days I'm just tending to miss Elizabeth

354
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,170
要不就是给凯瑟琳娜小姐拿这拿那的
or fetching this-that for miss Catherine.

355
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,610
如果你下周从教堂还回来的话？
You know if y'all coming back next week for church?

356
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,540
我很了解你
I know as much as you.

357
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,740
我猜想如果太太一直暗示下去
I suppose if missus is suggesting it,

358
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,350
里斯大人也不在意什么的
master Reese don't mind the trip.

359
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,380
我可不想等的太久才能见到你
I sure wouldn't wanna wait another season to see ya.

360
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,350
我也是的
Me, neither.

361
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,140
这是我奶奶从我爷爷那拿来的
My Nana got it from my grandaddy.

362
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,470
她被从非洲抓来时就一直带着它
She brought it with her when she was taken from Africa.

363
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,610
这是唯一能让她的心灵感到自由的东西
Said it was the only thing that kept her mind free.

364
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,080
很漂亮
It's pretty.

365
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,690
我把它送给你了
I want you to have it.

366
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,500
防止我有段时间不能见到你
In case I don't see you for a while, you

367
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,230
这个可以体醒你要时刻记住我
have something that reminds you of me.

368
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,840
我不知道是不是该收下
I don't know if it's right I take it.

369
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,610
我可没有能让你
'Sides, I don't have nothing to give you

370
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,580
思念我的东西给你
to remind you of me.

371
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,080
我已经对你念念不忘了
I spend all my time thinkin' about you already.

372
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,120
切瑞？
Cherry?

373
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,820
来帮下妈妈，可以走了
Come help with momma. It's time to go.

374
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,400
谁在那？
Who there?

375
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,410
纳特？
Nat?

376
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,750
你要干嘛？
What are you doin'?

377
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,430
我应该早点这样做
I shoulda done that earlier.

378
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,530
你就是专程来亲我的？
You came here to kiss me?

379
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,910
不是
No, no, no.

380
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,240
我要的比这多
I ain't got much.

381
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,380
我的信仰，妈妈，奶奶
My faith, momma, Nana.

382
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,450
直到现在，我要的更多
Up until now, enough.

383
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:31,720
切瑞，我希望你可以成我的妻子，我会无比的荣幸
Cherry, I'd feel right honored if you'd be my wife.

384
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:36,560
我会对你好的，用我的一生来保护你
I'd treat ya right. Protect ya with my life.

385
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,460
如果你嫁给我
If you'd have me.

386
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,700
我愿意
Yes. Yes, I will.

387
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,490
接下去怎么做？
What now?

388
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,750
嗯
Uh...

389
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,260
我会和萨缪尔先生谈谈
I talk it over with Samuel.

390
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,960
给我们找个小屋子，等你下次来的时候就会布置一新了
Get us a cabin set up when y'all visit.

391
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,830
好的
All right.

392
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,020
天父，我们今天齐聚一堂
{\rENG} Heavenly father.  We are gathered here today

393
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,920
来参加这两个孩子的婚礼
to join together these two children,

394
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,660
他们找到了爱的真谛
who have found the love that exists in you.

395
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,290
我们一直沐浴在爱的怀抱中
The love that surrounds all of us all the time.

396
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:43,800
我们祝福他们
We bless these children together with our hands

397
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,000
我们手捧鲜花与爱
that the love that flows through our hands...

398
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
哈喽，教士
Well, hello, reverend.

399
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,700
我没指望能在
I wasn't expecting to see you around

400
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,960
周日见到你
these parts 'till Sunday.

401
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,830
什么风把你吹来的？
What brings you around the middle of the week?

402
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,830
永远不要在错误的时间
Never a wrong time...

403
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,400
给一个基督兄弟带来祝福
...to bring a blessing to a brother in Christ.

404
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,600
噢，上帝
Oh lord.

405
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,510
这祝福要花钱吗？
Is this blessing gonna cost me money?

406
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,510
一个子也不要，实际从另一面来说
Not a penny. To the contrary, in fact.

407
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,780
艾塞亚，送点水来
Isaiah, run us out a water.

408
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,610
最好给我来些杜松子酒
Gin, if you please.

409
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,480
我要谈下关于你牧师的情况
So, I put the word out about your preacher.

410
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,960
有几个农民愿意出好价钱
Got a couple of farmers willing to turn a good coin.

411
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,830
- 是吗？ - 嗯
- Is that right?   - Mmm-hmm.

412
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:51,060
这些天价格看涨
Every bit counts these days.

413
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,530
哦
Oh.

414
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,840
啊
Ah!

415
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,610
嗯…
Mmm.

416
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,740
如果他能满足他们的愿望
If your boy does to their liking,

417
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,380
你能大赚一笔
you could get outta debt.

418
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,450
拯救你的农场
Save your farm.

419
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,120
所有这些都只要纳特牧师出面就行了
And all I gotta do is let nat preach.

420
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,390
就这么简单
That's it.

421
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:20,390
我不能担保这些家伙
Now, I'm not vouching for the character of these fellas.

422
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,560
是怎么运营这些生意的
What business they runnin' or how.

423
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,630
我就是来告诉你
I'm just here to tell you

424
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,460
有个机会可以尝试下
that there's an opportunity there.

425
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,400
你要做的就是好好利用它
One you got the means to capitalize on.

426
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,170
我们说的是哪里？
Whereabouts we talkin'?

427
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,100
是先从南安普敦开始的
In southampton, at the start.

428
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,640
好的，听起来不错
Well, sounds good enough.

429
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,040
细节我会在告诉你的
I'll send you the details.

430
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,510
姓名，地点，细节，我明天告诉你
Names, locations, and dates, I'd say by tomorrow.

431
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,150
你已经预定好时间了
You already booked the dates.

432
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,920
我就是来让你同意的
I figured you'd say yes.

433
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,750
你能得到什么好处？
What's in it for you?

434
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,060
什么好处也没有，就是为了帮助兄弟
The pure joy of knowing that I'm helping a brother.

435
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,460
还有，关键的来了
And, uh... Oh, here it comes.

436
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,160
好吧，如果我能得到好处
Well, if I was to receive a gift offering,

437
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,430
我当然也不会反对的
I certainly wouldn't object.

438
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,000
你太小心了，教士
You are caution, reverend.

439
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,840
我只是个侍奉上帝的仆人
I am but a servant.

440
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,480
好多咸肉和西红柿
Here's some salt pork and some tomatoes

441
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,780
你饿的时候可以吃
for when you get hungry.

442
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,850
谢谢你，母亲
Thank you, momma.

443
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,620
不要担心
Don't y'all go getting' worried now.

444
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,160
我会安全返回的
I'll be back directly.

445
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,960
我知道
I know.

446
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,530
向上帝祈祷，你能平安返回
Pray the lord brings you back safe.

447
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,140
你是特纳家的黑鬼？
You massa Turner's nigger?

448
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,910
我是纳特
I'm nat.

449
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,910
特纳在里面
Massa Turner's in here.

450
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,680
来吧
Come on.

451
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,630
- 我们到了？ - 是，先生
- We're here?  - Yes, sir.

452
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,100
萨姆 特纳
Sam Turner.

453
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,000
真准时，约瑟芬 兰道尔
Made it right on time. Joseph Randall.

454
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,300
这是艾伯纳
This here's abner.

455
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,710
这小个子是杰斯帕
This little one? Jasper.

456
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,880
这是牧师？是的，先生
This the preacher? Yes, sir.

457
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,540
纳特？
Nat?

458
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,550
晚上好，先生
Evening, sir.

459
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,050
他看着还是个小年轻？
He's a little young, ain't he?

460
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,720
没有，他蛮大了
Why, he's old enough.

461
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,280
他已经学习圣经很长一段时间了，是不是？
You've been studying the word awhile, haven't you?

462
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,600
学习？
Studyin'?

463
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,190
我能勉强训练我的黑奴们学习他们自己的名字
I can barely train my niggers to learn their own names.

464
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,090
来吧
Come on!

465
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,300
这是艰难时刻
{\rENG} It's hard times

466
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,700
对于我和你这些小农场主来说
{\rENG} for small farmers  like you and myself.

467
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,840
现在情况更糟糕了
Breakin' even's hard enough,

468
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,740
黑奴要想出入头地是不可能的
but getting ahead's impossible.

469
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,000
我只能做个好人
So to save some,

470
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,310
把他们带回来每天管顿饭吃
I cut them back to a meal a day per head now.

471
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,350
他们当中有一小部分人开始变得不安躁动
A few of them started getting' fidgety,

472
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,010
所以我让艾伯纳陪着我一起
so I had abner come down on 'em.

473
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,980
艾伯纳，这儿，他是我唯一真正的护身符
Abner, here, he's my only real protection.

474
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,890
现在，这些黑奴让我不满意，你要和他们说
Now, they needs to mind me. You speak on that.

475
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,920
他们所有的财富都在天堂里
They treasure in heaven from submittin' and all.

476
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,130
如果他们感到悲伤或是继续这样
If they gets to moanin' or carryin' on,

477
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,760
我可以毫不怜悯的分文不给
ou don't pay 'em no mind,

478
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,230
因为他们太懒惰了就好像生活在地狱里
because they lazy as all hell.

479
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,930
他们出工不出力
They do anything to get outta work.

480
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,670
你准备好了吗，伙计？
You ready, boy?

481
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,950
听着，今晚我请了牧师来
Listen up! Got a preacher here tonight.

482
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,020
过来，孩子
Come here, boy.

483
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,290
你们看他和你们一样都是黑人
Now, he's a nigger here like y'all,

484
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,960
他会告诉你们关于上帝的好处
and he's here to talk to you about the lord.

485
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,700
你们注意听着
So you listen to him

486
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,200
你们照样做也可以上天堂的，知道吗？
and you might just make it into heaven, you hear?

487
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,070
兄弟姐妹
Brothers and sisters.

488
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:06,110
我带你见彼得
I lead you to Peter 2:18.

489
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:12,850
奴隶们，奉献自己
"Slaves, submit yourselves

490
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:17,190
带着你所有的尊敬去你的主人那
"to your masters with all respect."

491
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,090
不仅那些好的和体贴
"Not only to those who are good and considerate,

492
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,400
但那些严厉的
"but also to those who are harsh."

493
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,040
你确定晚上不住这？
You sure you don't wanna stay the night?

494
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,710
拿些好的白兰地来
Got some fine Brandy

495
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,380
有几个女孩关在地窖里
and a couple of choice wenches in the cellar.

496
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,720
让艾伯纳来给我们拉小提琴
Get abner here to strike out the fiddle

497
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,220
让女士和我们围坐在壁炉边
and sit around the fire, tell some old lies, huh?

498
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,720
不了，我们要赶在太阳落山前回家
No. We best be gettin' back before sun go down.

499
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,890
好的，你自便吧
All right. Suit yourself.

500
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,330
我可以带瓶白兰地
Would take a bottle of that Brandy,

501
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,730
如果你愿意分给我的话
if you could spare it.

502
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,900
哦，小事一件，艾伯纳？
Oh, sure thing. Abner?

503
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,770
有了那个巧克力帮我办事
I got a chocolate one here

504
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,240
我可真是省力不少啊
that does it right every time.

505
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,910
你确定不要留下过夜了？
You sure you don't wanna stay?

506
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:11,780
不了，他们等着我们回去
No, they expectin' us back. You know how it is.

507
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,440
好的
All right.

508
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:18,250
你是个聪明人，萨姆
You's a smart man, Sam.

509
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,850
你带着那家伙前途光明
Man make a fortune with that boy.

510
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,260
和你做生意很愉快
Great doin' business with you.

511
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,170
走吧
Let's go.

512
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,490
你还好吗？
You all right?

513
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,190
S
Yeah.

514
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,430
那边的那件衣服
The dress there.

515
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,040
是你婚礼时穿过的吧？
That the one you were wearing that day?

516
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,140
对的
Yes.

517
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,510
是妈妈从她衣服里选给你的吗？
Momma offered you one of hers?

518
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,450
是的
She did.

519
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
阿比盖尔 海恩
"Abigail hayne."

520
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,070
我的母亲
My momma.

521
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,540
麦迪森海恩，那是谁？
"Madison hayne." Who was that?

522
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,080
是我
That's me.

523
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:56,080
我母亲
My momma,

524
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,180
她给我穿上这件裙子的时候
she put this dress on me

525
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:03,490
他们把我从她身边夺走了
the day they took me from her.

526
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:07,190
看见这块补丁
Showed me this here patch.

527
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,200
它提醒着我永远不要忘了我是谁
Told me to never forget who I was,

528
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,030
还有我的母亲
and that I had a momma.

529
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:17,370
她就在某个地方
And that she was somewhere,

530
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:21,440
我时刻都在思念着她，爱着她
missing me and loving me.

531
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,380
我那时十三岁
I was 13.

532
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,220
如果愿意我可以叫你麦迪森
I can call ya Madison, if ya like.

533
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,390
只要你喜欢，怎么叫都行
You can call me whatever you want.

534
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,490
你是我的皇后
I'll call you queen.

535
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,300
有什么不对吗？
What's wrong?

536
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,240
我们要有孩子了
We're gonna have a baby.

537
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,610
孩子？
A baby?

538
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,310
你肯定？
You sure?

539
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,320
你疯了？
You mad?

540
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,360
疯了？
Mad?

541
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,660
没有
No. No.

542
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,330
我没疯
I ain't mad.

543
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,550
作为仆人的眼睛
"...as the eyes of the servants

544
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,120
看向他们主人的双手
"look unto the hand of their masters

545
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,290
女仆的眼睛
"and the eyes of a maid

546
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,520
看向她主人的双手
"look unto the hand of her mistress..."

547
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,640
诺亚醒了酒
"...and Noah awoke from his wine

548
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,970
知道了小儿子向他所做的事
"and knew what his youngest son had done unto him.

549
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,680
他说到，迦南该受诅咒
{\rENG} "And he said,  'cursed be canaan.'"

550
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:18,620
必给他弟兄做奴仆的奴仆
"...servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.

551
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,760
他说到，我们在天上的父神
"And he said, blessed be the lord,

552
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,560
耶和华闪的神 愿迦南
{\rENG} "god of shem, and canaan..."

553
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,720
等在这
Wait here.

554
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,410
我去后面看下
I'll go check 'round back.

好的
Yessum.

556
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:33,460
你在我地盘干什么？
Whatcha doin' on my land?

557
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,200
嗨，叫你的狗走开
Hey! Call off your dog!

558
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,300
你在我地盘干什么？
Whatcha doin' on my land?

559
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,840
不要，他和我一起的
No! He's with me!

560
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,740
你他妈是谁？
Who the hell are you?

561
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,210
我是萨缪尔特纳，沃尔索尔教士派我们来的
I'm Samuel Turner. Reverend walthall sent us.

562
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:46,110

564
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,750
我们去找厄尔
Let's go find Earl.

565
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:57,250
你还好吗？
You all right? Come on.

566
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,760
在这黑鬼就是黑鬼
Niggers is niggers here.

567
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,160
我们不会把他们当成其它人来对待
Now, we don't treat none no different than another.

568
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,460
我们这有规矩
We got rules.

569
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,800
偷窃，财产损失
Cost of breakin' 'em, stealin', sassin',

570
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,730
或者其它我和厄尔能想到的事情
or any other thing that Earl and I think

571
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,640
任何的损失我们都会让他们遭到皮肉之苦
worth dealin' with, will be paid for in skin.

572
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,470
你要是干涉
You interfere with that,

573
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,810
我们会向你开枪
we'll shoot you where you stand.

574
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,290
还有问题吗？
Got any problem with that,

575
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,450
你也可以不干，从哪来回哪去
you can stop right now and go on back where you came from.

576
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,490
快点
Come on now! Come on!

577
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,390
厄尔
Earl!

578
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:34,360
这是萨姆 特纳
This here is Sam Turner,

579
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,160
还有个黑鬼牧师
fella with the nigger preacher.

580
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,370
你说你从哪里来的？
Where you say you come from?

581
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,670
南安普顿乡
We from here. Southampton county.

582
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:45,900
就在诺托韦的南面
Just south of nottoway.

583
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,300
嗯
Mmm.

584
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,270
罗塔 扬基 让他们走
Lotta Yankees makin' their way down that way.

585
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,410
暴民们正在对我们的人生进行破坏
Rabble-rousin', stirring shit on our way of life.

586
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:55,280
出同样问题了
They're pullin' that same shit.

587
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,850
厄尔，有个小麻烦
Earl. Got a little problem.

588
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,700
那个？这个
Which one? This one.

589
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,400
多久了？
How long?

590
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,270
大概一天左右
Mmm. About a day or so.

591
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:28,380
你不吃饭？
You ain't gonna eat, hmm?

592
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,880
你不吃饭，来吧
You gonna eat? Come on. You ain't gonna eat?

593
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,420
嗯？
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

594
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,860
好吧
All right.

595
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,630
这个不行，那就用另外的办法了
If it ain't one thing, it's another.

596
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,380
你肯定疑惑我们为什么要用你黑鬼？
You wonderin' why we could use that nigger of yours?

597
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,890
张开他的嘴
You're seein' it firsthand. All right, get his mouth open.

598
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,390
好的，美国佬
Well, if it ain't the yanks...

599
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,490
是干旱
...it's the drought.

600
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:16,490
如果不是干旱
If not the drought...

601
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,460
是这该死的叛乱
...it's goddamn mutiny.

602
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,470
把漏斗放这
Get a funnel in there.

603
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,960
即便是黑鬼们所惧怕
Truth is, even the meanest nigger's

604
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,630
的那些福音
fearful of the gospel.

605
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,630
从你的人嘴说出来也是最美好的话语
Maybe a good word from your boy there,

606
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:56,030
这些话要比我的手枪更有用
discipline word,go a lot furtherthan my pistol would.

607
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,940
纳特是个好牧师
Nat's a good preacher.

608
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,270
我才不关心他的好坏
I don't right care how good he is,

609
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,880
关键是他支持什么
long as he say what he's supposed to.

610
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,900
弟兄们
Brethren.

611
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:40,740
我向上祈祷你们的罪过
I pray you sing to the lord

612
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,520
你们的罪过
a new song.

613
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:53,860
歌颂义人在会中
Sing praise in assembly of the righteous.

614
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,900
愿圣民因所得的荣耀高兴
Let the saints be joyful in glory.

615
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,860
让他们大声歌唱
Let them sing aloud on their beds.

616
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:01,970
高声赞美主
Let the high praise of god

617
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:03,500
通过我们圣徒的口
be on the mouths of the saints,

618
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,340
他们手中握着双刃剑
and a two-edge sword in their hand

619
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,840
要斩断恶魔家园的复仇之火
to execute vengeance on the demonic nations,

620
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,510
还要惩罚那些
and punishmenton those peoples

621
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,440
束缚住他们国王双眼
to bind their kingswith chains

622
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,710
用枷锁捆绑住他们贵族的人们
and their nobleswith fetters of iron

623
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,880
去斩断他们，给予他们公正的审判
to execute on them this written judgment.

624
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,880
荣誉属于他所有的圣徒
This honor hath all his saints!

625
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,120
赞美主
Praise the lord!

626
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:24,020
赞美主，歌颂他吧
Praise the lord! Sing to him a new song!

627
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,620
赞美主
Praise the lord! Praise the lord!

628
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,490
不要想着穿这漂亮
Don't suppose you got a pass anywhere

629
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,620
裙子到处乱走
underneath that pretty dress.

630
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,300
没有，先生
No, sir.

631
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:05,660
我是有主人的，这儿是他的私人领地
I belongs to massa guiles and this here his property.

632
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,530
你骗我？
You sassin' me, girl?

633
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,400
没有
No, sir.

634
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,640
任何人都知道州法律的规定
Anybody that knows nothin' knows that state law says

635
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,840
法律规定如果一个黑人出现在小于树木线十步的地方
that if a nigger's less than 10 paces from a tree line,

636
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,010
那这个黑人需要通行证
that nigger need a pass.

637
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,940
好吧，先生，我可以拿到的
Well, sir, I can get one.

638
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,680
你无处可去
You ain't goin' nowhere.

639
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,850
要么你给我看通行证
Either you gonna show me a pass,

640
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:27,520
要不你给我看些其它的
or you gonna show me somethin' else.

641
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,090
什么？
What?

642
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,690
抱歉打扰了
I'm sorry to disturb ya,

643
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,800
但是纳特有事对你说
but nat's gotta talk to you.

644
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,960
发生了些可怕的事情
Somethin' awful had happened.

645
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:41,100
不管什么情况，告诉他
Whatever it is, just tell him

646
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,970
我早上会来这
I'll get to it in the mornin'.

647
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,870
主人，如果你能抽点时间
Massa, if you could just see nat

648
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:47,470
见下纳特
for just a moment, I...

649
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:49,870
见鬼了，艾塞亚
Goddamnit, Isaiah.

650
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:54,850
好了，告诉他我会在前面走廊那见他
All right, tell him I'll meet him on the front porch.

651
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:57,820
我就在这，先生
I'm right here, sir.

652
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,550
进来吧
Might as well come in then.

653
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:05,460
先生，我对此十分抱歉
Sir, I am awfully sorry about all this. I...

654
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,590
什么情况，纳特？
What is it, nat?

655
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,890
是切瑞，她受了很重的伤
Cherry... she's been hurt real bad.

656
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,060
什么伤？
Whatcha mean hurt?

657
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,230
几个人，先生
A group of men, sir.

658
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,210
艾塞亚，给我拿些纸来
Isaiah, fetch me some paper. Yeah.

659
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,140
好的，你下来吧
All right, you should go down there.

660
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:30,010
带上朱庇特，但不要惹麻烦
Take Jupiter, but don't start no trouble.

661
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,050
呆一晚上，早上回来开始做事
Stay the night, come back first thing in the morning.

662
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:36,650
好的，先生，谢谢了
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

663
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,010
上帝会惩罚那些人的
God's gonna punish whoever did this.

664
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,950
禽兽
Monsters.

665
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,080
纳特？
Nat?

666
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,740
我在这
I'm right here.

667
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,650
我在这
I'm right here.

668
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,590
是我
It's me now.

669
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:17,090
我在这
I'm right here.

670
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:21,960
对不起
I'm sorry.

671
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,260
不要，不需要道歉
No, no. You don't apologize.

672
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:28,670
你不要责怪自己
You don't owe that to nobody.

673
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:36,140
告诉我是谁干的
You need to tell me who done this to you.

674
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,780
我会处理的，你听见吗？
'Cause I'm gonna take care of it, you hear?

675
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:41,040
我的神啊
On my soul.

676
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,220
我需要你的指引
I need you to tell me now.

677
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:18,250
收刀入鞘吧
"Put up again thy sword into his place.

678
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:24,350
凡动刀的
"For all they that take the sword

679
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,720
必死在刀下
"shall pass with the sword."

680
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,730
你曾经教过我
You taught me that.

681
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,900
我需要你
I need you here.

682
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,270
乔安娜也需要
Joanna, too.

683
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,910
把这个留给上帝
Leave this to the lord.

684
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,460
你要见我，先生？
You wanted to see me, sir?

685
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,970
是的，切瑞怎么样了？
Yeah. How's cherry?

686
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,840
我相信她会好起来的
I'm believin' she'll be fine.

687
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,810
那就好
Good. Good.

688
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,010
我还能做些什么
Not many woulda let you go like I did.

689
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:23,850
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

690
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:24,980
嗯
Mmm.

691
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,850
我们今晚有个重要的活动
We're having a big get-together tonight

692
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:29,890
有很多重要人物出席
with a lot of very important people.

693
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,720
自从我父亲去世后就没有这样过
Kind of like when daddy was alive.

694
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,990
所以我需要你，还要几个人在这帮忙
So I'm gonna need you and a couple of others in the house.

695
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:36,460
还有谁能
Anyone who's had experience

696
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,000
懂礼貌，服务好，有经验的
servin' and being respectable help.

697
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,800
明白，先生
Yes, sir.

698
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,070
能告诉我对您来说这些客人有多重要吗？
Can't tell ya how important this is for all of us.

699
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:45,300
如果我们做的好
If we get this right,

700
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,440
那么意味着特纳的姓氏会再次崛起
the Turner name will mean something again.

701
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,380
以赛亚
Isaiah.

702
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:55,810
是，先生
Yes, sir.

703
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,200
就像你知道那样，这次年度晚宴
As you all know, this annual dinner

704
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,430
是我们的父亲多年来的传统
was a tradition of our daddy many years ago.

705
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,500
在他所有的崇尚中，家庭地位，信念
And for all he believed, he placed family, faith,

706
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,910
传统是他最为看重的东西
and tradition at the top of his priority list.

707
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,270
二十年后
Twenty years later,

708
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,180
我们的财富正是因为有了这些相同的优先等级而得以保持
those same priorities have kept this property afloat.

709
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,350
那个和即期付款都是从你这个黑人牧师那来的
That and the cash down from your colored preacher.

710
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:05,420
对的
Yeah! That, too.

711
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,880
希望上帝可以世世代代
May god continue to bless all of us

712
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:09,350
不停的祝福我们
for many generations to come.

713
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:13,160
对的
Hear, hear.

714
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,990
纳特，你可以带我们一起祷告吗？
Nat, would you please lead us in prayer?

715
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,530
尊敬的教士，我相信你不会介意的
Reverend, I trust you wouldn't mind.

716
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,900
我想不会
I guess not.

717
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,340
天父
Heavenly father.

718
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,150
我们前来感谢你的言行
We come to thank you for your word and your will.

719
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,280
我们祈祷并且感谢你
We pray for and thank you

720
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:44,190
为了你的保护与承诺
for your protection and your promise.

721
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,560
我们将顺从与你
And in our obedience,

722
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,490
你的敌人也将是我们的敌人
you will be an enemy to our enemies.

723
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,200
我们将反抗你所反抗的
That you will oppose those who oppose us.

724
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,040
继续指引着我们，我的主啊
Continue to guide us, o lord,

725
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,210
我们将继续跟随着你
and we will continue to follow.

726
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:06,880
穿越磨难，勇往直前
Through fine tribulation we will push forward,

727
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,110
认识到只有你才能作为我们的力量和源泉
recognizing only you as our source and strength.

728
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,050
我们将呼唤着你神圣的名字
In your holy name we pray.

729
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:18,050
阿门
Amen.

730
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:20,190
魔幻厨房
Bon appetit.

731
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,360
父亲总是说
Daddy always said,

732
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,060
三个黑胡椒放在一杯
"three black peppercorns in a glass of port,

733
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:28,400
这是最好的餐后酒
"and you got yourself a excellent digestif."

734
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,570
不错，黑色总是引入入胜
Well, black is always tasty.

735
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:36,470
特别是那块肉，多汁，甜美
Especially a nice piece of black meat. Sweet. Juicy.

736
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,480
我不干，好吗？
I ain't doin' it, all right?

737
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,240
我需要你离开这
Naw, naw. I need you to get out of here!

738
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:45,550
办不到，你才刚一露面
Ain't gonna happen, man. You just come out here...

739
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:48,390
嗨，嗨，嗨
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Ho, ho, ho!

740
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:50,420
出什么事了？
What's goin' on, huh?

741
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,660
- 我不同意  - 嗯？
- I ain't doin' it.  - Huh?

742
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,590
- 我不同意，纳特  - 什么情况？
- I ain't doin' it, nat.  - Doin' what?

743
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:55,430
他们要先对我用私刑
He'd have to lynch me first.

744
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,630
私刑？我们在讨论什么东西？
Lynch ya? What are we talkin' about?

745
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:02,000
一个萨缪尔先生的客人
One of Samuel's guests...

746
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,040
什么？
What?

747
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:11,240
一个客人要求伊森
One of Samuel's guests requested Esther, and, uh...

748
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,650
去找萨缪尔先生，告诉他发生了什么
Just go and talk to Samuel. Just tell him what happened.

749
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,550
告诉他，他会作出正确决定的
Tell him what it was and he'll straighten this out.

750
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:26,120
但这是萨缪尔先生亲自派我来的
But Samuel sent me over here personally, nat.

751
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,290
我不能这么做，纳特
I can't do it, nat. I won't.

752
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,060
汉克兄弟
Brother hark...

753
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,530
你是谁？
But, what... Who are you?

754
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:35,130
汉克兄弟，你觉得
Brother hark, do you think

755
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:38,400
我想为这个过来吗？
that I wanna come over here for this?

756
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,370
你听见了？
You here, ain't ya?

757
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,340
纳特
Nat!

758
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,410
她在哪里？
Where is she?

759
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:49,450
萨缪尔，先生，请不要这样做
Samuel, sir. Please, you can't do this.

760
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,020
都还好吗？
Everything all right?

761
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,990
都还行
Oh, it's just fine.

762
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:58,590
我会径直走进去的
I'll be inside directly.

763
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:00,320
希望你不要孤单
I hope you won't be alone.

764
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:05,330
我保证你不会的
I assure you, i will not be.

765
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:07,700
如果你把这个搞的一团糟，我发誓
If you mess this up for me, my hand to god,

766
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,000
我会在第二天让你体无完肤
I will lynch every one of you come mornin!

767
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,630
你明白我吗？
Do you understand me?

768
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,640
把她带来
Fetch her.

769
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,740
是，先生
Yes, sir.

770
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,770
没关系的
It's okay.

771
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:34,320
他在那，纳特，神在哪？
Where is he, nat? Where's god now?

772
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,830
汉克
Hark.

773
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:57,740
对不起
Excuse me.

774
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:01,850
我在找一个叫纳特的牧师
I'm looking for a preacher named nat.

775
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,250
因为他的罪过
He's been banned from every church

776
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,000
他被这个国家的所有教堂都禁止出现了
in the county for his sins.

777
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:07,180
对于他所做的事情，他已经是很幸运的了
He's lucky that's all he got for what he done.

778
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:10,120
世间对于不道德的交易有它自己的处理方式
The world has its way with dealing with the immoral.

779
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,520
重要的是谁来衡量发生
Above all those who cast that immorality

780
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,290
在他身上与孩子的这些不道德行为
on the children as he has.

781
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:19,130
但是我们所有人都是有罪的，伊丽莎白小姐
But no one is without sin, miss Elizabeth.

782
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:22,130
这个男人需要忏悔，而且需要被指引
And this man wants to repent and be delivered.

783
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:26,800
做为上帝的牧羊人，这是我的职责
As a Shepherd of the lord, it's my duty to serve.

784
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:28,440
所以
So...

785
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:32,640
我想要为他洗礼
I'd like to baptize him.

786
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,710
见你的鬼
The hell you will!

787
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:35,350
杰斯罗，注意你的言辞
Jethro, you will mind your mouth.

788
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:36,580
我很抱歉，伊丽莎白小姐
With respect, miss Elizabeth,

789
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,200
黑人不能为白人洗礼
a nigger can't baptize no white man.

790
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:42,700
我只是认为我们应该等萨缪尔先生回来
I just think we should wait for Mr. Samuel to get back.

791
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,400
杰斯罗，去前院等着
Jethro, go wait in the front yard.

792
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:46,290
萨缪尔先生回来前有我们在
Mr. Samuel gets back, he'll have both of us!

793
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,560
我不会再说第二遍了
I won't ask you again.

794
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,400
你等着
Boy, you gonna get it.

795
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:59,340
你确定你要这么做吗，纳特？
Are you sure you want to do this, nat?

796
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,500
萨缪尔不会喜欢这样做的
Samuel may not like it.

797
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:04,340
现在有很多白人围在这附近
Nor will a lot of other folks around here.

798
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:07,810
不要考虑太多了，夫人
Don't got too much choice, missus.

799
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:11,180
这个人依然属于神
This man still belongs to god.

800
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:14,350
当你站在了上帝与它的子民之间
When you stand between the lord and his people,

801
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:16,890
这会是个危险的境地
it's a dangerous place to be.

802
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:20,580
我们全家对你一直够好的
We've been good to you. My whole family has.

803
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:23,750
你就是这样回报我的
And you go on and do something like this to me.

804
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,760
一个黑人为一个白人洗礼，还是在我的地盘上
A nigger baptizing a white man on my property!

805
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,590
你知道这让我们看上去像什么吗？
Do you know how this makes us look?

806
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:33,400
这会毁了我们所做的一切
This could ruin everything we worked for!

807
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,500
伙计，你最好快点解释下
Boy, you better say something and quick!

808
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,270
圣灵立你们作为全群的监督
"Take heed therefore unto yourselves,

809
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:41,500
你们就当为自己谨慎
"and to all the flock over which

810
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:43,770
也为全群谨慎
"the holy ghost hath made you overseers.

811
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:45,380
牧养神的教会
"To feed the church of god

812
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:48,510
就是他用自己的血所买来的
"which he has purchased with his own blood."

813
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:50,450
劝…
Ex...

814
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:52,320
劝戒仆人
"Exhort servants

815
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,450
要顺服自己的主人
"to be obedient to thy own masters,

816
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:56,790
凡事讨他的喜欢
"and to please them well

817
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:58,000
不可顶撞他
"in all things not answering again..."

818
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:01,620
你是被买来的不要成为人的奴仆
"You were bought with a price, do not become slaves of men."

819
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,530
他会亵渎对抗圣灵
"He that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost

820
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:07,330
永远不会被原谅，但是非常危险
"hath never forgiveness, but is in danger..."

821
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:08,730
要防备假先知
"Beware of false prophets

822
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:10,300
就是那个披着羊皮的
"who come dressed in sheep's clothing,

823
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,870
但是内心确是贪婪饥饿的狼
"but inwardly are ravening wolves!"

824
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:13,600
你个黑杂种，纳特
You black bastard! Nat!

825
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:14,800
他的秘密出卖了他
"He that stealeth a man and selleth him..."

826
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:15,800
不要盯着我
Don't you eyeball me, boy!

827
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:17,370
或是如果他被发现在他的手里，他应该坚定无疑
"...or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely

828
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,440
被处以死刑
"be put to death!"

829
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,020
拉他去公示栏
Get him to the post.

830
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:40,960
嗨，伙计
Hey, boy.

831
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:47,400
如果你活着熬过来了
If you make it out of this alive,

832
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:51,100
我要让你日子更难过
I'm gonna ride you harder than hogs on slop.

833
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,110
去死吧
Die.

834
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,780
吸取教训了吗
You learned your lesson, boy?

835
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:21,120
是的，先生，我学到了
Oh, yes, sir, I've learned.

836
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:23,790
把他放下来
Go on, get him off.

837
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,890
你完成布道有段时间了
You're done preachin' for a little while.

838
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,900
我也不喜欢你和其它组成员去到处瞎跑了
And I don't want you runnin' off with any groups,

839
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,730
除非我和杰斯罗在的情况下，明白吗？
unless me and Jethro are there, you understand?

840
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:38,170
是，先生
Yes, sir.

841
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:40,240
好吧，去把自己弄干净些
All right, go and get yourself cleaned up.

842
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,970
回田里工作吧
Be back in the field come morning.

843
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:00,990
兄弟，你还好吗？
Brother, you all right?

844
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:05,760
嗨，嗨
Hey! Hey!

845
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,750
我看着你的祖父去世
I watched your grandfather die

846
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:25,110
在老地方
in old land.

847
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,350
亲眼看着他的灵魂升天
Saw him give up the ghost with my own eyes.

848
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:34,220
他看着我
And he saw me.

849
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:37,030
他的灵魂在那天得到了升华
He harnessed the holy spirit that day.

850
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:39,900
是的
Yes, he did.

851
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,160
我感到很自豪
I was proud of him.

852
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,840
非常自豪
So proud.

853
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,400
我依旧感谢着神灵
I still thank god

854
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:52,910
就在他死的那天
that he died that day.

855
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:56,250
他没有活着看见这些，而我看见了
That he didn't live to see the things I seen.

856
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,990
看着一个坚强的人被打倒
To watch a strong man broken down

857
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:08,160
被一些可怕的事情
is a terrible thing.

858
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:45,460
嗨，奶奶
Hey, Nana.

859
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:54,040
伤口缝合的还不错
The stitches held up good.

860
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,350
奶奶
Nana?

861
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:13,420
你还好吗？
You all right?

862
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,990
最主要的
Mostly.

863
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:35,470
我需要你聚集一些你信得过的人
I need you to round up a few men you trust.

864
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,140
让他们与我们在柏树林那见面
Have them meet us at the big cypress

865
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:39,810
就在小屋池塘那后天晚上
at cabin pond night after next.

866
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:44,850
哈克
Hark.

867
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,450
他还在这，兄弟
He's still here, brother.

868
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:51,020
尽管这样
Even now.

869
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:12,110
这是西蒙
This is Simon.

870
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:14,910
萨缪尔回来一个月后买了他，在诺福克
Samuel bought him a month back in Norfolk.

871
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:16,910
我记得，欢迎，兄弟
I remember. Welcome, brother.

872
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:18,410
你认识尼尔森
And you know Nelson.

873
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,980
欢迎
Welcome.

874
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:22,350
这是威尔
This is will.

875
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:26,520
世界变化真快，欢迎
Word travels fast. Welcome.

876
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,460
嗨，这是大人们的事情，走开了
Hey! This grown folk's business! Get! Get!

877
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,130
慢点
Hold on.

878
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:34,060
过来这
Come on over here.

879
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,440
从兰德尔来的？是，先生
Come from Randall's? Yes, sir.

880
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,140
他还是个孩子
He's just a boy.

881
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:44,510
大卫也是
So was David.

882
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:48,880
来吧，坐下
Come on. Have a seat.

883
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:03,160
我已经追随了上帝很长时间了
I've been following the lord a long time.

884
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:07,030
布道，引用圣经
Preachin', citing scripture,

885
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:09,570
从几页篇章里分享福音
sharing the gospel from the few pages

886
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:11,600
而且我也认同里面的部分内容
and sections I've been allowed.

887
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,900
但是回到这个现实世界，所有这一切
But I've gone back through this word, all of it.

888
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:17,040
用一种新的方式来看待的话
With new eyes.

889
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,910
在我现在看来，这些诗篇
I see now, for every verse

890
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:20,440
都是他们用来作为奴役我们枷锁
they use to support our bondage,

891
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,610
我们的自由在这看起来是一种苛求
there's another demanding our freedom.

892
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:27,050
每一个篇章都被他们证明现在对我们的这些折磨是合理依法的
Every verse they use to justify our torture,

893
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:30,120
而这些奴隶主的行为也不会轻易被下地狱
there's another damning them to hell for those actions.

894
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:35,990
上帝告诉我，接下去我们要开拓眼界
Lord has spoken to me. Visions of what's to come.

895
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:38,530
要用善良来对抗邪恶
A rise of good against evil.

896
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:42,260
有人想做首先，他必做众人末后
The first shall be last, and the last shall be first.

897
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,470
兄弟们，我们是被选中的
Brothers, we've been chosen.

898
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:50,410
我们要干什么？
What are we gonna do?

899
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:52,370
做大卫和基甸
Same as David and Gideon

900
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:56,710
约书亚和参孙
and Joshua and Samson.

901
01:18:56,710 --> 01:18:59,010
我们要战斗，就我们六个人？
We'll fight. The six of us?

902
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:01,120
开始是这样，但是一旦开始了
At first. But once it begins,

903
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,520
我们兄弟姐妹就会加入
our brothers and sisters will join.

904
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,120
这儿可是有很多白人的
There's a whole lot of whites.

905
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,960
在这个国家有多少奴隶？
How many slaves you think there are in the county?

906
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,560
所有的种植园里有多少？白人又有多少？
On all the plantations? How many whites?

907
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,030
但是他们有枪
But they got guns.

908
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:12,390
我们将夺取耶路撒冷的军火库
We'll take the armory in Jerusalem.

909
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,130
我们也会有枪的
We'll have guns, too.

910
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:15,730
耶路撒冷？
Jerusalem?

911
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:18,370
对的，就在北方十英里的地方
That's right. It's only 10 miles north.

912
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:19,670
我们就从特纳这里开始
We'll start right here at Turner's

913
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:21,240
打出我们自己的天下
and fight our way there.

914
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,110
到时我们就有几百人
By then we'll number in the hundreds,

915
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:25,040
甚至上千人
thousands even.

916
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,740
星星之火可以燎原
The grapevine's ablaze with talks of fightin'.

917
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:30,310
奴隶制结束了
Slaves all over havin' meetins'.

918
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:32,250
他们在等待
They waitin' on something.

919
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,620
等我们的召唤
They waitin' on us.

920
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:38,650
我们在富勒的地方停留
We make a stop at Fowler place?

921
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,490
可以
We will.

922
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:44,290
我加入
I'm with you.

923
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,530
我也是
Me, too.

924
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,500
- 我们什么时候战斗？ - 很快
- When we fight?  - Soon.

925
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,770
上帝会给我启示的
The lord will give us a sign.

926
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:51,430
在这之前我们要保持坚定
Until then we remain steadfast,

927
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,270
做好准备等待上帝的召唤
ready to strike at the moment of the lord's call.

928
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:56,170
带着我们强大的信念
With the strength of our father,

929
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:57,640
我们会最终获胜的
we'll cut the head from the serpent.

930
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:01,210
我们会全部摧毁他们
We'll destroy them all.

931
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:32,500
有什么不对吗？
Somethin' wrong?

932
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:36,180
前几天晚上有个会议
There was a meeting a few nights ago.

933
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:38,810
虽然我不知道说了些什么
And although I was not privy to what was said,

934
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:41,320
我只能靠假设
I can only assume

935
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:45,290
秘密不能让太多人知道
by the secrecy that it was not altogether productive.

936
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:04,740
现在，我不明白意思
{\rENG} Now,  I don't know what ideas

937
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:08,340
在你的脑海四周飘荡
{\rENG} is floatin' around  in your head,

938
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:10,580
但是我就在你周围，足够了解你
{\rENG} but I been around here  long enough to know

939
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:12,680
确信无疑的结果
that the result of certain ideas

940
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,850
不会让你随心所欲的
is not gonna get you what you want.

941
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:17,350
我想要的
All I want,

942
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:19,520
我想代表神为了被压迫的人们
I want for the oppressed people of god.

943
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,120
你愿意为他们去死？
You want death for them?

944
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:24,460
为了你妻子？
For your wife?

945
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,430
为了你女儿？
For your daughter?

946
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:28,700
如果这是神的旨意
If it be god's will.

947
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,770
神的旨意
God's will?

948
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:34,200
谁让你这么坚决
And who determined you

949
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:36,170
为了这样的事情而成为一个工具？
to be the instrument of such a thing?

950
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,870
他
He has.

951
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,550
你确定
You just make sure that he's the one doin' the orderin'.

952
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:50,550
神的仆人被称为爱的领路人
Man of god is called to lead in love.

953
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:53,790
所有都会离我们而去
Anything else will leave us all worse off.

954
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:57,390
他是爱的神，纳特
He is a god of love, nat.

955
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:59,900
不要忘记了
Don't you forget that.

956
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,900
我不会
I won't.

957
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:05,170
我会忘记他是愤怒的神
Nor will I forget he's a god of wrath.

958
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:18,750
妈妈
Mmm...

959
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:34,500
上帝在召唤我
The lord's calling me.

960
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,370
去战斗
To stand and fight.

961
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:52,210
我知道这天终会来到
I knew this day would come.

962
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:58,350
我告诉自己不要害怕
I told myself i wouldn't be scared.

963
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,460
我的有生之年
All my life,

964
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:07,200
都在祈祷上帝能帮助我们
I've been praying for the lord to help us

965
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,370
或者派个救世主来拯救我们
or to send someone who could.

966
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,470
我们所有人都这样
We all have.

967
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:19,210
只是没曾想盼来的确是我丈夫
Just wasn't expecting it to be my own husband.

968
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:34,490
如果是上帝召唤你去战斗
If the lord's called you to fight,

969
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,890
你就去
you fight.

970
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:41,560
你为我而战
You fight for me,

971
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,730
还有乔安娜
and Joanna.

972
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:51,410
为了我们所有人
You fight for us all.

973
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:52,980
嗯？
Hmm?

974
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:04,650
谁在那？
Who's there?

975
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:11,420
纳特？
Nat?

976
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:12,990
是的
Yes.

977
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:33,840
等着，他妈的
Wait, goddamnit!

978
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,680
可恶
Damn it!

979
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:18,650
母亲？
Momma?

980
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:23,990
母亲
Momma.

981
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:28,920
纳特？哦，上帝，我睡的太晚了
Nat? Oh lord, i slept too late.

982
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:30,930
没有，母亲
No, no... Momma.

983
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:35,000
你今天不用干活了
You won't have to work today.

984
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:37,670
你自由了
You free.

985
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:48,080
战役开始

西蒙会带你去里斯那里

990
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,190

没事

992

你做了什么？
What did you do, boy? Huh?

994
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,790
你杀了他们？
Huh? You killed them, boy?

995
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:34,890
是你干的吗？
Is that what you did?

996
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:38,730
你杀了他们，你等于杀了我们
ou kill them and you kill us!

997
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:46,540
你等于杀了我们所有人
You killed all of us.

998
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:49,740
我们死定了
We already dead. We already dead!

之前的主人已经不在了

01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:18,700
你们是自由的男人和女人
You're now free men and women,

1005
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,270
只服务与上帝

1006
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:25,570
就像上帝之剑赦免我们的敌人一样
As the sword of the lord bears down on our enemies,

1007
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:28,180
让我们的祖先和未出生的孩子高兴吧
our ancestors and unborn children rejoice.

1008
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,780
我们死了吗？
Are we dead?

1009
01:29:35,050 --> 01:29:38,720
没有，我说大家都活着
No. I say we are now alive,

1010
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,690
透过这些眼睛看到的
seeing through eyes that have been denied us

1011
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:43,790
自从出生以来就在受压迫和黑暗的日子里
since being born into the darkness of bondage.

1012
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,000
与我们站在一起
Stand with us.

1013
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:49,330
让你们那些被抓获的兄弟姐妹们

1014
01:29:49,330 --> 01:29:50,730
也知道自由的滋味

神的伟大与奇妙

1018

1019
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,940
对抗邪恶
against the works of the evil one!

1020
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:03,140
与我们在一起
Stand with us.

1021
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:59,000
我能自己做吗？
Can I do this myself?

1022
01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:59,930
孩子，他走了
The boy! He gone!

1023
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:10,810
呼呼
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1024
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:31,830
趴下
Get down!

1025
01:32:34,230 --> 01:32:35,900
嗨，牧师

01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,400
汉克

1027
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,400
你在外面？
Are you out there?

1028
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,040
告诉那个人后退
Tell the men to fall back.

1029
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,770
什么？
What?

1030
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:44,110
如果我们现在发生枪战
If we have a gun battle now,

1031
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:45,310
我们就永远到不了耶路撒冷
we'll never make it to Jerusalem.

1032
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:46,410
我和我的人准备好了
Me and my boys is ready!

1033
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:47,780
我要复仇

1034
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:49,010
这不是复仇
This ain't about revenge, hark!

1035
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:52,110
你们都要被吊死，你听见了吗？

1036
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,980
所有人

祖先
The root,

1038
01:32:58,260 --> 01:32:59,450
不要有分歧
not the branch.

1039
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:03,260
我们必须保持专注，兄弟
We must stay focused, brother.

1040
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:08,930
撤退
Will! Fall back! C'mon! C'mon, y'all. C'mon.

1041
01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:11,070
让我们撤退
Let's fall back, y'all!

1042
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:37,530
你还好吗？
You all right?

1043
01:33:40,230 --> 01:33:42,360
我们所有人
It's all of us.

1044
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:43,500
就这？
This it?

1045
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,190
哈克，你觉得现在几点了？
Hark, what time you think it is?

1046
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:09,260
五点三十，五点三十五
5:30, 5:35.

1047
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:12,360
什么？
What?

1048
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,870
现在我会两排下来
By now I'd be two rows down,

1049
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:22,400
半袋
half a bag full.

1050
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:25,340
我将前往谷仓
I'd be headed to the barn,

1051
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:27,340
准备喂牲口
gettin' ready to feed the stock.

1052
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:29,480
我要去烟熏室烧开水
I'd be boiling water in the smokehouse,

1053
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,510
倒在那些主人的头上
thinkin' 'bout dumping on massa's head.

1054
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,280
我将捆绑木桶，填补裂缝
I'd be tying the barrels, sealin' cracks.

1055
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:37,420
记录着树叶与稻草
Checkin' the leaves and straw.

1056
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:40,520
包装和消磨这一切
Packin' and stackin' 'em up.

1057
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:43,590
避开爆竹的飞屑
Dodgin' that cracker's lash.

1058
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:48,160
但不是今天
Not today.

1059
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:50,160
对的，先生
No, sir.

1060
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:52,500
不是今天
Not today.

1061
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,170
去向耶路撒冷？
On to Jerusalem?

1062
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:00,580
去向耶路撒冷？
On to Jerusalem.

1063
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:02,110
去向耶路撒冷？
On to Jerusalem!

1064
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,300
好了，接下去你们应该这么办
All right, this is how this is gonna work.

1065
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,710
把武器丢在地上
You're gonna throw the weapons to the ground,

1066
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:33,440
接着趴在地上
then you're gonna lie down.

1067
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:37,510
快点
Do it.

1068
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:42,680
上帝是我们的明灯，是我们的救世主
The lord is our light and our salvation.

1069
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:44,990
我们应该怕谁？
Of whom we shall fear?

1070
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:48,620
把你们的武器丢在地上
Throw your weapons to the ground!

1071
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:51,960
我们要相信上帝的强大
The lord is the strength of our lives.

1072
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,230
我们应该要害怕谁？
Of whom shall we be afraid?

1073
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:59,370
当邪恶，甚至仇敌
When the wicked, even our enemies

1074
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:00,740
还有我们的敌人来到面前
and our foes came upon us

1075
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:03,500
要生吞活剥了我们时，他们只会失败跌倒
to eat up our flesh, they stumbled and fell!

1076
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:05,070
他妈的，黑鬼们
Goddamn, niggers.

1077
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:06,570
虽然你们这些主人反对我们有安生之所
Though a host shall encamp against us,

1078
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:08,510
但是我们的心将不会感到恐惧

1079
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:09,610
准备
Ready!

1080
01:36:09,610 --> 01:36:10,750
虽然战争会影响我们
Though war shall rise against us,

1081
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,380
但在这方面我们有信心
in this we will be confident!

1082
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:14,050
瞄准
Aim!

1083
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:18,520
叛乱者

1084
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:45,540
来吧
Come on!

1085

01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,380

手上不要停
Keep on workin' now.

1100
01:42:30,590 --> 01:42:32,690
其他人怎么样了？
Any word on the other men?

1101

他们在到处杀人
They killin' people everywhere

1104
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:44,640
没有理由就因为你是黑人

他们说了会一直杀下去

这几个月来
All these months

1108
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,830

你是不是也死了
I thought you were dead, too.

1110

你在和谁说话？

我在自言自语

01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:04,650
这个孩子犯下了屠杀罪，我们将当众吊死他
This boy committed mass murder and will hang for all to see.

1122

1123
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:36,770
下地狱去
Go to hell!

1128
01:47:32,330 --> 01:47:33,730
我准备好了
I'm ready.
