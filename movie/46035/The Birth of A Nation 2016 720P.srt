1
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,970
All right.

2
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,599
- Toast time.
- All right.

3
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,102
This is, amazingly enough, to us.

4
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,983
Five incredible, incredible years.

5
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,946
Cheers.

6
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,867
Come here.

7
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,668
Brendan!

8
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,379
Leaving in five minutes, sweetie.

9
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,733
- Samuel?
- Yeah?

10
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,111
Do you want more?

11
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,654
No, thanks.
No, I've had lots.

12
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:40,784
No, no. Not lunch.
I mean more for us.

13
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,206
By which you mean...

14
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,418
- the big M, mariage, huh?
- Well, yeah.

15
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,380
I'm over 30, and I feel

16
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,674
like something's missing.

17
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,635
Okay.

18
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:02,055
What could possibly be missing?
Let's look at that.

19
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,433
Because, you know,
we live in a fantastic apartment,

20
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,935
my practice is really good,
it's thriving as they say.

21
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,272
We get on, I think, better than
most married couples.

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,191
Sure.

23
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,610
I'd say life was dangerously
close to perfection, actually.

24
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:18,655
So why would you want
to change things?

25
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,951
Why change what's perfect?
You know?

26
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,828
Right.

27
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,333
Okay.

28
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,711
New toast:

29
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,255
To stability.

30
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,925
Honey!

31
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,972
- Oh, God!
- Shit, honey. I hit a guy. Come on!

32
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,727
- Are you all right?
- Excuse me, ma'am. I know CPR.

33
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,946
Okay.

34
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,243
- Oh, you're conscious.
- Yes.

35
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,661
I thought you were
trying to French kiss me.

36
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,496
- I was trying to scream.
- Don't get up.

37
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,206
Don't get up.
You may have a concussion.

38
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,874
Sir, I think he's all right.

39
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,043
I've got it under control, madam.
Thank you, though.

40
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,128
- Does your head hurt?
- Yes.

41
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,672
- Are you nauseated?
- Very.

42
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,382
Okay, open your eyes.
Open your eyes!

43
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,801
Wide. Wide.
Okay. Okay.

44
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,095
Your pupils aren't dilated.
All right, you're okay.

45
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,888
- I brought you back.
- Sir.

46
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,682
- I brought him back, everybody!
- He's okay.

47
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,060
- Let him up.
- Oh, sorry, buddy.

48
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,687
- Careful with him.
- No lawsuit.

49
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,855
- Good. No lawsuit.
- Okay.

50
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,025
- Yeah. Marty Dwyer.
- Samuel Faulkner.

51
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,610
How you doing, buddy?
Good to meet you.

52
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,445
Listen, I'm sorry.
We were over there flying a kite,

53
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,239
and a big wind came along
and bam...

54
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,782
Cracked you right on the noggin.

55
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,367
But I guess you'd know that,
since you're...

56
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,245
Kids! Stop that!
Your manners!

57
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,956
Oh, no, there's plenty.
It's fine. Help yourselves.

58
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,043
This sucks!
It tastes like poo.

59
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,545
- Oh, bloody hell.
- Hey, hey.

60
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,715
What did I tell you about
spitting in other people's food?

61
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,552
No! Please.
Here, eat this.

62
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,220
Eat that, honey.

63
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,223
- You know, I know you.
- I don't think so.

64
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,058
You're Sean's friend,

65
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,437
the kiddie, you know, shrink.

66
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,230
Yes, I'm a psychotherapist.

67
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,898
Would you like some help
with your children?

68
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:21,111
I met you last year at Sean's loft.
I'm his sister, Gail.

69
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,906
- Oh, hi. I'm Rebecca.
- Nice to see you again.

70
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,659
Look, I'm sorry. That's beluga.
It's $64 an ounce.

71
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,578
- It's not dog food.
- Oh, sorry.

72
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,080
- I'll write you a check.
- No, it's fine.

73
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,498
Okay.

74
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,376
Kids, let's say thank you to the man

75
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,838
for the nice cheese
and give him a big hug.

76
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,924
Thank you!

77
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,802
Pleasure. Pleasure.

78
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,888
Kids, kids, break it up.
Come on now.

79
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,766
- Come on, we got stuff to do.
- Thank you!

80
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,893
- Have a little bit.
- No, no! Honey.

81
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,936
- No, no. Come on!
- All right.

82
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,023
Come on, Sprinkler, let's go.

83
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,483
Hope we didn't ruin your picnic.

84
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,651
Oh, no.
Why would you think that?

85
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,403
You guys take it easy.
We'll see you around.

86
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,946
Okay, bye.

87
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,282
You see? Breeders.

88
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,202
Perfect example
of the product of change.

89
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,607
The swelling's gone down.

90
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,485
It's still quite painful, actually.

91
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,239
All I'm saying is that there should
just be two areas on the beach...

92
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,324
One for adults
and one for children.

93
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,827
And then, you know,
everyone's happy.

94
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,413
Is that any better?

95
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,958
Yeah. That's much better.

96
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,671
You're too tense.

97
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,965
You need to loosen up.

98
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,177

Okay.

117
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,419
Good. Interesting.

118
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,256
Is that something you can maybe

119
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,800
elaborate on a little bit
for me, Truman?

120
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,677
Okay.

121
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,596
Great.

122
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,016
My dad's a giant asshole.

123
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,603
Yeah.

124
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,968
One... two... three.

125
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,012
Okay now, when you bring
your arms up round, like this...

126
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,307
Okay, Eleanor?
Round. Round.

127
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,480
- Like this, Miss Rebecca?
- Look. Look at that.

128
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,338
I don't know about Truman.
I mean, I'll get him to open up.

129
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,508
But, you know,
he's got very severe problems.

130
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,012
And we know who we can thank
for those problems, don't we?

131
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,680
- Huh?
- Hmm?

132
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,182
- You know, his parents.
- 32.

133
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,686
It's so incredible that the state requires
you to take a written test to drive a car,

134
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,397
but any complete moron
can become a parent

135
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,858
and just destroy a child's life.

136
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,569
It's like people just
have babies on a whim.

137
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,446
- 34.
- I mean...

138
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,948
surely to be a parent,

139
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,909
- you have to plan ahead a little bit.
- 36.

140
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,038
Say to yourself, "Do I really
want to become a parent?"

141
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,041
- 38.
- "Am I ready for that responsibility?"

142
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,043
I'm pregnant.

143
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,380
What? Pregnant?

144
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,009
Oh, Jeez.
Watch out!

145
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,097
Watch out!

146
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,310
Watch out!

147
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,153
Well, I guess
you don't want the baby.

148
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,251
Sir? Your car will be ready
in a minute.

149
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,255
- You're lucky the engine's in the back.
- Right.

150
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,638
Hi.

151
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,099
- Ready in a minute.
- Good.

152
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,102
So...

153
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,022
we are absolutely certain
about this, right?

154
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,484
- Well, my period's 10 days late.
- Right.

155
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:40,448
And there's no way you could've
had it and just not noticed?

156
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,368
Sorry. Ridiculous.
That's stupid. Stupid.

157
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,454
Could you be a little more positive
about this? More supportive?

158
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,124
I'm trying to be positive.

159
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:53,086
Killing us in a head-on collision
is not what I call positive.

160
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,255
I suppose it must've been shock.

161
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,424
You know, just out of the blue,
you say you're pregnant.

162
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,134
I think it was just
a little bit unexpected.

163
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,052
- No kidding.
- That'd be the reason for the crash.

164
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,679
I thought you
were using birth control.

165
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,099
- I was.
- Yeah. Right.

166
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,686
- Your car's ready now, sir.
- Great.

167
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,859
Oh.

168
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,112
- You don't believe me.
- No.

169
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,990
You think I got pregnant on the sly,
behind your back.

170
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,742
No. No. No.
No. No. No. No.

171
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,201
Do you think I planned this?

172
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,037
Because I'm as flipped out
about this as you are, Samuel.

173
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,499
Yeah, yeah. I suppose
I just thought that birth control

174
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,253
had a little teeny element
of actual control about it.

175
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,588
I thought it was
supposed to be foolproof.

176
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,298
Well, yeah, nothing is foolproof.

177
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,010
It's only 97% effective.
It says so right there on the box.

178
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,637
Yeah. Right.
97% effective.

179
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,682
So therefore,
3% completely bloody ineffective.

180
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,226
They should put that on the box.

181
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,895
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

182
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,521
We're off.

183
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,284
- Hey. Hey.
- Sean.

184
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,622
- Who's the blonde?
- No idea.

185
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,833
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

186
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,085
- Jesus.
- Hi.

187
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,088
Hey. How are you?
This is Bobbie.

188
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,800
- This is Rebecca and Sam.
- Hi.

189
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,053
I was getting worried about you guys.
What happened to this car?

190
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,348
Oh, long story.

191
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,516
Look at that.

192
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,895
- What happened to Christine?
- Oh, long story.

193
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,066
This is where
you two are gonna stay.

194
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,401
- Like it?
- Yeah. Lovely.

195
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,196
So, what do you think of her?

196
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,406
- You mean the blonde?
- Yeah.

197
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,700
She's attractive.
She's very attractive.

198
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,203
Sam, she's 25 years old.

199
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,665
Her skin is like ribbon candy.

200
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,751
Breasts like sponge cake.

201
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,045
Her calves are like calzoni.

202
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,464
I mean, highly edible.
Highly edible.

203
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,550
She's crazy about sex.

204
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:07,011
This is somebody who can
get me over the rough spots.

205
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,555
I'm telling you.

206
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,431
What do you mean?
What rough spots?

207
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,852
Oh, Christine left me.

208
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,438
- Shit.
- Yeah.

209
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,023
When?

210
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,985
Oh, a week ago.

211
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,280
- What happened?
- Well...

212
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,948
she wanted a child.

213
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,868
- I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

214
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,536
Yeah, yeah.
What an idiot.

215
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,037
No, no, leave that.

216
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,665
- Got it.
- Jesus. Here. Take this.

217
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,459
She was...
So she wanted... she...

218
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,545
Christine wanted a baby?

219
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,464
She was hungry for seed.

220
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,967
So I closed the iron door.

221
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,844
Denied her my essence.

222
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:52,056
You know, I'm not ready to be
biologically extraneous.

223
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,810
She would have devoured me
from the head down,

224
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,981
chewed up my manhood,
swallowed my youth,

225
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,401
and gobbled me up like
some praying mantis. Not for me.

226
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,904
What do you mean,
praying mantis?

227
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,866
The female mantis, after she has sex
with her mate, she eats him.

228
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,035
Oh, yeah.

229
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:18,917
But Christine wasn't pregnant
or anything like that?

230
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:23,004
No. What do you mean?
Like, on the sly or something?

231
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,841
On the sly, or just, you know,
in the run of things?

232
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,010
On the... no.

233
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,179
I mean...

234
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,932
Christine has her faults,

235
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,517
but I don't know
who would do that.

236
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,187
- That's a knife in the back.
- Yeah.

237
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,648
That's certain...
No, of course not.

238
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,316
That's some voodoo woman
who stays up at night

239
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,985
and puts pins in her diaphragm.

240
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,947
Spooky, Sam. Jesus.
That's a she-snake.

241
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,200
That's the most hateful,
cruel, sneaky,

242
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,369
horrible thing you can do.

243
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,037
Who would do that?

244
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,090
No! No!

245
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,888
They eat the father!
They eat the father!

246
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,557
- They eat him!
- Honey... what, honey?

247
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,936
Honey, what?
Who eats fathers?

248
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,479
- No one.
- What?

249
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,732
Sorry, honey. Sorry.
Just a bad dream.

250
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,151
- Silly, silly dream.
- Okay. You worry too much.

251
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,153
Just relax.
Lie down.

252
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,406
Okay? Lie down.

253
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,617
It's okay, baby.

254
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,996
Whatever happens,
we can work it out.

255
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,000
- I know.
- I love you.

256
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,462
I've loved you since
the first moment I saw you.

257
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,340
You're the only one I want to be
the father of my children,

258
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,759
whether it's now

259
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,928
or later.

260
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,849
Okay?

261
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,442
Oh.

262
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,238
- I love it when you do that.
- Do what?

263
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,617
That thing you're
doing with my knee.

264
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,121
- That is so good.
- Samuel?

265
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,623
Stop it. I love it. Go on.

266
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,501
Samuel?

267
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,962
Wow. Yeah?

268
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,007
I'm not doing anything
with your knee.

269
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,926
What?

270
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,972
What is it?

271
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,645
I found her. Come here, kiddo.
Where you been?

272
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,690
- Come here, you.
- Sweetie! Sweetie!

273
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,111
I'm sorry, folks. I'm sorry.
Come on, get away from him.

274
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,946
Go, go, go.
I'm sorry, folks.

275
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,783
She's going through a hiding phase.
It's something kids do for attention.

276
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,035
Hey, honey, off the bed.
Off the bed.

277
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,371
You're gonna get it dirty.
And God only knows what's on there.

278
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,083
Hey, honey,
it's the people from the beach.

279
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,210
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

280
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:11,005
This is great. Don't worry,
we didn't bring a kite this time.

281
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,466
But how about another
one of them kisses?

282
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,221
- Oh. What's going on?
- Yeah, we found her.

283
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,014
We've been looking
for her for an hour.

284
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,849
Here, quit reading that book.
Go call the neighbors.

285
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,018
Tell them to call off the search party.
Please, please, go.

286
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,479
You, please call the sheriff
before the choppers go up.

287
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,689
Folks, we're real sorry.

288
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,192
Looks like it's gonna be
a full house this weekend.

289
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,320
Party time then!
I'm sorry. Get back in there.

290
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,698
Listen. Sorry.
And I'm gonna take off.

291
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,991
You guys are gonna
be here all weekend, right?

292
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,702
- Yeah.
- Sounds great. Good to see you.

293
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,459
You didn't tell me they were
coming for the weekend.

294
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,878
My sister and her husband,
they didn't tell me, either.

295
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,006
They always show up uninvited.

296
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,885
- I hope they don't spoil your weekend.
- Oh, no. We'll be fine.

297
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,763
- The kids seem adorable, really.
- Oh, they're monsters.

298
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,765
They're monsters.

299
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,143
See, this is why I don't want kids.

300
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,398
Because of this nonsense.

301
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,081
No, what I'm saying
is that I just think

302
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,167
it's such baloney
and such a cliche

303
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,879
that the artist
has to be messed up

304
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,672
and have a life of deprivation...

305
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,175
Being an alcoholic or being
deprived in some way.

306
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,511
It's how you...
It's how you use,

307
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,389
obviously, with imagination
and passion whatever it is...

308
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,057
I love you.

309
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,103
Well, that's nice.

310
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,189
I think you're great.

311
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,566
Marry me, Captain Renaldo.

312
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,819
Well...

313
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,990
- Who's Captain Renaldo?
- Marry me. Make me your wife.

314
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,618
We'll honeymoon in Paris.

315
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,453
Well, I'd... I'm not sure.

316
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,331
It's King Stanislaw's daughter,
isn't it?

317
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,125
- You're madly in love with her!
- Who's King Stanislaw?

318
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,170
Don't deny it!
I saw the two of you kissing!

319
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,130
Brute!

320
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,258
- You betrayed me.
- She just hit me incredibly hard.

321
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,177
- Shannon, no hitting.
- Shannon.

322
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,346
Okay, you run along.
You go play with your sisters, okay?

323
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,307
- We're gonna talk about it later.
- You weasel!

324
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,393
God, I am so sorry about that.

325
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,813
She's been reading
these Harlequin romance novels

326
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,149
- and she's just obsessed with it.
It's kinda cute, really.

327
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,901
Isn't it cute?
Yeah, lovely.

328
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,654
Not many teeth left in the left-hand
corner of my mouth, but cute.

329
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,907
What a puss.

330
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,329
All right, everybody.

331
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,414
I've got an announcement to make.

332
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,292
Gail and l...

333
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,836
are gonna have a new baby.

334
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,342
Shit. Another one.

335
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,513
So I'd like to make a toast...

336
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,642
to my wife,

337
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,353
the most beautiful pregnant woman
in the whole world.

338
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,022
Oh, that's so sweet.

339
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,566
You can be
the toughest guy in the world,

340
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,568
but when you see your child
look into your eyes

341
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,570
and you know that that child knows
that you're their dad...

342
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:25,908
- Suddenly, it smiles.
- It's like... I just cannot explain it.

343
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,035
It's like magic.

344
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:31,455
Is it magic when they do that little
dribble of vomit down your shoulder?

345
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,881
- I'm sorry if we're boring you, pal.
- Just a joke.

346
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,842
Okay, just forget it.

347
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,552
- The guy is rude. He's rude.
- Drop it.

348
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,722
- Sorry. What did you say?
- You are rude.

349
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,890
- Rude? You think I'm rude?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

350
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,642
- Sam.
- I'm sorry. For a moment...

351
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,728
It's all right, honey.
It's fine. It's fine.

352
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,188
Let's just deal with this accusation
of rudeness.

353
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,190
Because like an idiot,
I was under the impression

354
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,775
that you were the one
monopolizing the conversation.

355
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,861
Well, I'm sorry, too,
if I'm a little excited

356
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,446
about my wife and I
having another baby.

357
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,072
I know it might not be
a big thing to you.

358
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,576
Yeah, and is that a reason to exclude
other people from the conversation?

359
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,912
I didn't realize this was a frickin'
group therapy session, Doctor.

360
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,331
How much do I owe you
for four minutes?

361
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,041
You didn't realize that
your dog was a menace.

362
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,293
You didn't realize that you
were a crashing bore.

363
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,670
I would walk over there
and kick your bony little ass

364
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,839
if I wasn't gonna have
my five-year-old daughter do it!

365
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,883
Okay, let's drop the whole thing.

366
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,427
Yeah, Marty, that's it.
After all, he does have a point.

367
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,972
- But, you know, just drop it.
- Sean, he's a dick.

368
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,933
And you're an even bigger dick
for taking his side over family.

369
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,478
No, it's just that you and Gail
used to be interested

370
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,605
in all kinds of other things...
Politics, music, art.

371
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,607
Now it's just nothing
but kids, kids, kids.

372
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,693
Well, my kids happen
to be very meaningful to me.

373
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,153
When my first was born,

374
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,572
it was one of the most
exciting moments of my life.

375
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,158
I felt like I really made
a contribution to this world.

376
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,951
Absolutely. Congratulations.
Absolutely.

377
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,245
And the world is overpopulated.

378
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,955
Our society has too many
starving children.

379
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:59,210
Well, I would say our society
has too many starving artists.

380
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,130
It hasn't been lucrative,
that's true.

381
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,967
But that doesn't mean that
what I do isn't respectable.

382
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,720
Look at Van Gogh.
He, while he was living,

383
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,139
didn't sell one painting,
and now his stuff goes for $40 million.

384
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,599
Sean, I got a quick question for you.

385
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,394
How long are you gonna have to be dead
before you can pay that phone bill?

386
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,479
Why do you guys
really come here?

387
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,523
Is it just to ruin my weekends

388
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,234
and embarrass me
in front of my friends at my home?

389
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,653
Your home?
This isn't your home.

390
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,405
It was our parents' home.

391
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,323
But I don't see you
making any contributions.

392
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,700
You've got no wife, no kids.

393
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,661
You insult the only family
you have.

394
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,038
You keep this up,
you'll die alone, like a dog.

395
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,166
Like a bum.
Like Van Gogh.

396
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,767
Hey, Doc.
You all right?

397
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,980
Are you okay?

398
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,690
Yeah. What?

399
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,567
You don't look so good.

400
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,610
You look like you're gonna puke
or something.

401
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,863
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Thank you, Truman.

402
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,573
I was just listening
to what you were saying there.

403
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,368
That was interesting.
That was a key sentence.

404
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,124
Would you mind repeating it
just so I can get it down?

405
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,209
You're an asshole.

406
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,920
Right.

407
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,381
And Dad's a bastard.

408
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,384
Yeah.

409
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,346
Right.

410
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,727
I can't be a father.

411
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,062
I can't.

412
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,484
Why would I want
to have a child?

413
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,403
So he can call me a bastard
in 10 years' time?

414
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,073
I mean, we'd have to move out.

415
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,952
We don't have space for a child.

416
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,705
Rebecca and me,
we're wonderful together.

417
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,583
It's just insane to spoil it.

418
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,336
Just the two of us...
That's how it should be.

419
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,756
This baby is not a good idea.

420
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,674
That's what I'll tell her.

421
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,761
- Bec?
- Hi. I'll be right there.

422
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,805
- Just stay back, okay? Bye-bye.
- Bye!

423
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,933
I'll tell her now.

424
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,185
- Hi.
- Bec.

425
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,772
- Listen, Bec...
- Samuel...

426
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,607
- No, wait. Wait.
- I've been thinking.

427
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,653
This pregnancy was an accident.
It took us completely by surprise.

428
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,530
Right.

429
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,615
We've been doing
really great together,

430
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,159
and a baby
would change everything.

431
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,245
Yeah, I suppose it could.

432
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,372
Our apartment's
not ready for a baby.

433
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,250
- No.
- I mean, we'd have to redecorate.

434
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,752
- Yep.
- I'd have to quit my job.

435
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,172
Nobody wants to take dance class
from a big, fat pregnant lady.

436
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,259
I mean, we're not ready
for a child.

437
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,303
There's not one good reason
that we should keep this baby.

438
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:02,268
But I still want to.

439
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,647
Right.

440
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,441
Maybe it's crazy,
but I feel it living inside me.

441
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,323
And I really want this baby.

442
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,202
Okay.

443
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,121
What about you?

444
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,498
What ab... you mean what...

445
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,500
- What do I think?
- Yeah.

446
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,502
I'm just saying how I feel.

447
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,838
So what do you feel?

448
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,174
Right.
How do I feel on that one?

449
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,802
Well...

450
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,848
I feel...

451
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,851
I...

452
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,191
feel exactly the same as you.

453
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,862
Really?

454
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,156
Yeah.

455
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,706
- We won't let it change us.
- No.

456
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,499
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

457
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,502
Can you wait here forjust a minute?
I have to go to the bathroom again.

458
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,340
It's one of the many,
many joys of pregnancy.

459
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,093
Okay. Oh, gosh.
We're gonna have a baby.

460
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,220
Oh, gosh.

461
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,725
I'm such a...

462
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,977
I'm such a coward.
Sorry.

463
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,021
It's nothing to do with you.

464
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,163
Oh, baby, you were incredible.

465
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,207
Not bad, eh?

466
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,753
That was the single most satisfying
sexual experience of my life.

467
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,048
Well, I aim to please.

468
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,761
And now...

469
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,763
now it's time for dinner.

470
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,309
Dinner?

471
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,235
No!

472
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,154
Samuel!

473
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,989
Time to get up.

474
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,325
Today's our first
doctor's appointment.

475
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,536
- Today?
- Yeah.

476
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,998
I told you about it two weeks ago.
And then last week.

477
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:34,169
Three days ago.
And twice, I think, yesterday.

478
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,798
Sorry, honey.
I completely forgot.

479
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,427
Yeah.

480
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:42,970
Figures.

481
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,889
I swear I won't forget the next time.

482
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,981
- Hi.
- Hi.

483
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,650
I'm Rebecca Taylor.
I'm here to see Dr. Green.

484
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,986
Oh, Dr. Green's
been out with pneumonia.

485
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,655
You can see his associate,
Dr. Kosevich.

486
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,242
- Or you can reschedule.
- Yes. Just reschedule.

487
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,411
No.
We can see Dr. Kosevich.

488
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,997
Are you sure?

489
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,916
- Why, is there a problem?
- No, no. Oh, no, no.

490
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,461
It's just that Dr. Kosevich is new.
From Russia.

491
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,546
He's a little nervous.

492
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,799
Oh, but very sweet.

493
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,636
Well, we're already here.
We may as well see Dr. Kosevich.

494
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,055
- Okay?
- Okay.

495
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,349
Okay.

496
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,189
Thank you.

497
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,787
Please, come sit down.
One moment.

498
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,039
Little family business.

499
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,585
It's not one thing,
it's your mother.

500
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,922
Please. Please, sit down.
I'm very sorry.

501
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,966
- Hello.
- Hello.

502
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,728
So we hear you're from Russia.

503
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,522
- You have a problem with that?
- No, no.

504
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,900
I am not a communist.
Well, I was briefly member of party,

505
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,777
but it was not a party for me.

506
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,154
It was only for medical reasons.

507
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,574
I was a scientist.
In Russia I was chief of obstruction.

508
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,743
- Obstruction?
- Abstraction?

509
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,454
- Abstraction?
- Obstetrics, I think you mean.

510
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,122
That's it. Obstetrics.

511
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,167
Hold on a moment here.
Not obstruction. It's obstetrics.

512
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,211
Yes, I was head
of obstetrics research

513
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,339
at Pasklovansky Hospital in Leningrad,
now St. Petersburg.

514
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,008
Oh, yes.
What brings you here, then?

515
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,803
Well, I never get a chance
to work with people in Russia.

516
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,763
Oh, more of the sort
of technical side.

517
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,181
No, animals.

518
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,434
- Animals?
- Only rats and monkeys.

519
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,104
- Rats?
- I like a little change of scenery.

520
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,649
After 10 years, you've seen one
rat ass, you've seen them all.

521
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,944
I also want a patient
who won't bite me.

522
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,946
And last month,
I received my new license,

523
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,448
and now I'm able to deliver
human babies.

524
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,868
Okay, now,

525
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,037
I have a computer program here
that I have written myself

526
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,708
that will calculate your due date
very accurately, okay?

527
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,710
Fine.

528
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,045
When was the first day
of your last menopause?

529
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,463
- Menopause?
- Menstruation.

530
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,299
- Menstruation.
- Period.

531
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,634
End of sentence.

532
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,846
- March 11.
- March 11 . March 11.

533
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,266
Three-one-one.
Okay.

534
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,145
Here it comes.

535
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,814
The baby will be due December 8.

536
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,317
- Okay.
- Congratulations.

537
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,028
And the baby
was conceived March 17.

538
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,363
Oh, that's clever.

539
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,948
Most people know that,

540
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,993
but some people are too drunk,
they don't remember.

541
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,287
- Oh, my God.
- What is wrong?

542
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,334
- I'm not the father.
- What?

543
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,628
- Samuel?
- Oh, my God.

544
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,838
On March 17,

545
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,759
I was away at a child-psychiatry
conference in Boston, remember?

546
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,845
- Samuel, what are you saying?
- Maybe I should leave you two alone.

547
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,056
- That's fine. I'm going.
- No, wait!

548
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:17,184
Come back. Sit down!
Samuel, sit down!

549
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,769
Now check your computer again.

550
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,687
- The computer is very accurate.
- No, now.

551
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,439
Check the goddamn computer.

552
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,107
- Check it!
- Check it!

553
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,943
Don't yell at me!
Please don't do this to me.

554
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,694
I spent a year in Afghanistan.

555
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,197
I have sometimes very
low tolerance for pressure.

556
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,616
- Well, come on!
- One moment. I will check it.

557
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,326
What is wrong with the thing?

558
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,788
Fuck me!
It's not working.

559
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,040
Hold on. Okay.
What is wrong?

560
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,085
Oh, okay.
Okay. Excuse me.

561
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,880
This is the problem.
It is feces flying into the fan.

562
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,548
Here's the problem.
There are function keys.

563
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,385
One is for humans
and one is for simians.

564
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,887
- You're not a simian.
- No, I'm not.

565
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,431
- I had you as a baboon. Okay.
- Sorry.

566
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,433
- I didn't...
- Hold on, I have figured it out.

567
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,395
There you go.
Were you here March 23?

568
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,773
- Yeah.
- With her?

569
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,025
- Yes.
- Okay.

570
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,403
Everything is fine now.
We're all back online.

571
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,780
And your baby...
Your baby

572
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,658
will be born on December 15.

573
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,578
Okay, now it is time
for the physical examination.

574
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,915
Let's go take a look
at your Volvo, okay?

575
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,377
Come with me into here.
I warm my hands up for you.

576
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,923
Please, come in.

577
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,844
All right, madam.
If you would take off your clothes

578
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,513
and get undressed,
we will begin, okay?

579
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,765
You may stay in the room,
sir, if you like.

580
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,308
That's fine, I'll wait in...

581
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,977
Don't you dare leave me
alone with him.

582
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,438
- I'll stay. I'd like to stay.
- Very good.

583
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,733
Okay.
Let me get it ready for you.

584
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,580
Okay. I think we've worked out
all the insects.

585
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,125
Giddyup.

586
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,255
Run.

587
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,135
- That lunatic is not delivering me.
- That's fine, he won't.

588
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,304
He's just a replacement.
Dr. Green will be the...

589
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,015
Let me help you, honey.
Just be gentle!

590
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,810
Honey, listen.
I'm just thinking, about the baby...

591
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,897
Let's just keep it
to ourselves, huh?

592
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,982
Yeah, all right.

593
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,651
Talking about it before the third month
is bad luck anyway, right?

594
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,195
- I think so.
- Yeah.

595
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,490
- Marty! Look who's here.
- Hey, look who's here!

596
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,326
- Hey, guys! What the hell?
- Hi.

597
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,870
- Good to see you. How you doing?
- Fine.

598
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,331
- Wow! When are you due?
- Yeah.

599
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,459
- Oh, I'm not pregnant.
- You're not pregnant?

600
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,711
- No.
- Yeah, right.

601
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,506
Huh. What are you doing
on the maternity floor?

602
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,676
Are we on the maternity floor?
Good grief, we're completely lost.

603
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,678
Poor old Bec.
She just had some bad Chinese.

604
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,180
Last night.

605
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,224
We're here to see
the gastrointestinal specialist.

606
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,977
- What's his name?
- His name?

607
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,939
Yeah, if you tell me his name,
I could tell you what floor he's on.

608
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,775
That's right. She volunteers here.
I've sold cars to almost every doctor.

609
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,194
I don't want to brag.
What's his name?

610
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,404
- Bec, what's his name?
- It's "Doctor" something, isn't it?

611
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,698
- It's Doctor...
- This is ridiculous.

612
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,867
Excuse me.

613
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,121
Oh, gosh, thanks.
I didn't even realize I'd left it.

614
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,872
Thank you very much.

615
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,791
You have a small pussy.

616
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,336
- What?
- I found the little hairs on the bag.

617
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,381
- What?
- You know, the koska.

618
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,882
You know, the...

619
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,802
- Oh, cat!
- Yes, we have a cat.

620
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,680
- Well, you must get rid of it.
- What?

621
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,266
Well, the cats,
they spread the disease.

622
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,310
Oh yeah, yeah,
with the small worms.

623
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,896
- Small worms, yeah, in the...
- In the poop.

624
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:53,191
- Toxoplasmosis.
- Toxoplasmosis. Thank you.

625
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,236
Thank you both very much,
but Skippy is old and clean.

626
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,947
I don't think there'll be a problem
in that direction.

627
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,658
Okay, well, it is your choice.

628
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,452
The cat or the baby.

629
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,289
Sorry to bring you that news.

630
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,294
- Baby.
- Congratulations, guys.

631
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,088
- It's so exciting!
- All right. Congratulations.

632
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,925
- Thank you. Thanks very much.
- Wow. That's great.

633
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,261
- Hey, buddy.
- I'm sorry.

634
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,930
That's all right, man.
I've been lied to before.

635
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,016
You're pretty good at it, though.

636
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,768
We could use a man like you
down at the car lot.

637
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,021
- Well, it's so exciting.
- We're happy for you.

638
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,066
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay. I've been a little tired.

639
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,943
Everybody gets tired, you know?

640
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,529
It's just that the whole thing
is just such a life-changing event.

641
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,908
- I'll give you my number. Call me.
- I'd like that.

642
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,951
We can go baby shopping.
Have lunch.

643
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,164
You've got to get that book
"What to Expect When You're Expecting."

644
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,124
We got some great videos
you can watch,

645
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,168
because we filmed
every one of her births.

646
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,296
You've got to film your first one,
'cause that's the best, it's the bloodiest.

647
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,632
Blood everywhere,
things are shooting in and out,

648
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,967
people are screaming,
stuff's getting torn apart

649
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,094
- and sewn back together.
- Oh, honey.

650
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,138
It's like a really good
World War ll movie.

651
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,140
- Let me give you my number.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

652
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,727
- So you gonna keep the car?
- Yeah, it's fine now, thanks.

653
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,355
Cost a bit of money,
but it's only three months old.

654
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,316
- But it only seats two people.
- It always did.

655
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,776
Right, but you're gonna
have a baby now,

656
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,194
so you're gonna need
something bigger.

657
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,238
Yeah, you could never fit
a car seat in there.

658
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,115
- You don't even have seat belts.
- I don't even know where the trunk is.

659
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,827
Listen, stop down by the lot.
I'll make you a good deal.

660
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,996
- All right?
- Great.

661
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,915
- Honey, we gotta go.
- Okay.

662
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,501
Bad Chinese.
Buddy!

663
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,004
Come on, baby!
Let's roll!

664
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,839
- See you guys!
- Okay.

665
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,634
I hate him.
I loathe him. I detest him.

666
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,845
You know, he just tried to sell me
a new car. Can you believe that?

667
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,722
- Tacky or what?
- Yeah, but he's right.

668
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,184
We're gonna need something bigger,
something with four seats.

669
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,396
But, hon, you know
how much I love my car.

670
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,356
And I've worked
pretty hard for it.

671
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,316
Well, what do you suggest we do?

672
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,860
Tie the baby to the hood like a deer?

673
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:04,614
Well, no, but maybe you
could get your own car.

674
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,367
On my salary?
Come on.

675
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,537
Well, put it this way: I'm not getting
rid of the car. Simple as that.

676
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,207
What about the cat?

677
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,042
Huh?

678
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,461
You believe Dr. Zhivago in there?

679
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,588
- The monkey doctor?
- He's right about the cat.

680
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,882
I've read about it.
Cats can be dangerous for a baby.

681
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,051
Not only can they give
a baby toxoplasmosis,

682
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,887
but they can suffocate the baby,
they could claw the baby.

683
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,308
Skippy is 16 years old.
He can barely move.

684
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,728
He's half blind. He hasn't got
the strength to suffocate anyone.

685
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,479
What about hygiene?
You know, in the kitchen.

686
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,649
You get cat hair on a baby bottle,
a cat can lick a baby's dish,

687
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,818
- you get cat saliva everywhere.
- Now just wait.

688
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,029
You said that this baby
wouldn't change our life!

689
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,572
Now suddenly
I have to sell the car I love,

690
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,615
I have to get rid of the cat
I've had for 16 years.

691
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,242
I mean, this is the second month

692
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,078
and our lives are
practically unrecognizable!

693
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,390
I really appreciate
your asking us to come along.

694
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:16,269
I'm kind of hoping that this will get
Samuel excited about having a baby.

695
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,021
Oh, yeah, sure.

696
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,399
Yeah, because if things
don't change, then...

697
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,570
I'm thinking about leaving him.

698
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,865
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, sure, you are.

699
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,575
I thought about leaving Marty
all the time.

700
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,869
But this is his first time.
You've got to give him a chance.

701
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,872
No, you don't understand.
He's completely uninvolved.

702
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,832
This whole baby thing
really scares him.

703
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,835
Yeah, he's just probably having
trouble facing it.

704
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,963
See, if you have a baby,
that means he's gotta grow up.

705
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:47,133
That's what he's really afraid of.
The baby's the fun part.

706
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,302
That's fun.

707
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,639
You know?
I mean, look at all this stuff.

708
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,225
Yeah! Whoo!

709
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,936
Boy, he's gonna love this.

710
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,522
So you know
you're having a boy, right?

711
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,357
Yeah.

712
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,819
- Gail took one of those amnio tests?
- No.

713
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,987
- Well, how do you know, then?
- I just know.

714
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,614
How?

715
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,867
I can tell it's a boy by the way
she's carrying it all in the front.

716
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,078
They don't often carry them
at the back, do they?

717
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,623
No.
Okay, if it's a boy,

718
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,501
you carry him low down, like this.
You know?

719
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,212
If it's a girl, it's up like this.
If it's a boy, it's down like this.

720
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,589
Right? Okay?

721
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,343
Plus, there are special ways
to ensure that it'll be a boy.

722
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,470
What do you mean special ways?

723
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,306
Well, when we made love...

724
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,685
- Yeah?
- ...we used special positions.

725
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,980
Please, that's an old wives' tale,
that stuff.

726
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,524
You'll see.

727
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,902
Sometimes I'm not sure
I want this baby.

728
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,322
Missy, of course you do.

729
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,616
It's just such a privilege.

730
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,827
There's hundreds of women

731
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,872
who spend thousands of dollars
every day trying to get pregnant.

732
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,499
It's like our profound
biological right.

733
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,543
It's something men
can never experience.

734
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,755
It has to be at the right time
for you, but really it's a miracle.

735
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,258
And then when the baby comes,

736
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:14,554
there's moments
of sheer happiness.

737
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,765
Even if you're alone?

738
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,897
I mean, I know that
it's fashionable, PC, all that,

739
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,232
to be a strong,
independent single mother,

740
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,194
and I'm prepared for that.

741
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,821
You know, I can do that.

742
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,575
But I would love this baby

743
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,036
to have a mother and a father.

744
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,455
I would love to have a family,

745
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,249
and I would love
to marry Samuel.

746
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,339
All he has to do is ask.

747
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,218
Oh, missy.

748
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,560
Okey-dokey.

749
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,896
Okay, girls, you tell your mommy
if she loves you,

750
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,774
she'll buy you
the whole Arnie collection.

751
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,609
Thank you, Arnie!

752
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,070
- Okay, who loves you, girls?
- Arnie.

753
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,656
You know it.
Bye-bye.

754
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,491
Hey, there, fellers.

755
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,786
How about taking home
a new Arnie doll for the kiddies?

756
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,871
No, thank you, buddy.

757
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,667
Hey, mister, you'd look great in one
of my "Arnie Loves You" t-shirts.

758
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,002
They come in extra-extra-extra large.

759
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,213
I bet they do,
but no, thank you.

760
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,966
How about one of my
new "Arnie Loves You" videos?

761
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:37,637
- ♪ Love is for you and me... ♪
- No, thanks! Okay?

762
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:41,683
- ♪ We are one big family. ♪
- Shut up, okay?

763
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,644
- I'm not gonna buy your damn video!
- But the kids will love it.

764
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,438
No, my kids will hate it
because they think your show sucks.

765
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,361
- Oh.
- But, thanks. Thanks anyway.

766
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,614
Well, sure.
Hey, no hard feelings, okay?

767
00:42:56,782 --> 00:43:00,660
- All right. Sorry.
- That's okay.

768
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,537
- So long.
- So long.

769
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,789
You cheap shit.

770
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,375
- What did you say?
- Huh?

771
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,670
Gee, I didn't say nothing, mister.
You must be hearing things.

772
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,131
- He didn't say anything. Forget it.
- Bye-bye.

773
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,175
Arnie loves you.
You penis-head.

774
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,012
- Now, I heard that!
- Heard what?

775
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,681
- I heard what you said!
- Come on, Marty, forget it.

776
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,600
He's someone pathetic
in a dinosaur suit.

777
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,643
There's children around here,
for God's sakes.

778
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,186
Forget it. Forget it.
Come on, let's go.

779
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,356
So long, you fat-ass pussy.

780
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,525
- That's it!
- No.

781
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,569
- Yes!
- Uh-oh.

782
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,696
No, no, Marty!

783
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,865
Come on.
Come on, you little wiener!

784
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,284
Come on, you bitch!

785
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,202
Here's one for the queen.

786
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,873
Hey! I'll get him, Sammy!

787
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,375
Hey, cut it out.

788
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,337
You hit like a girl,
you flatulent butthead.

789
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,380
I'll take both of you wieners on.

790
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:58,217
- You and that pussy boyfriend.
- Right, you bastard!

791
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,970
- You scum-sucking bottom feeders.
- Come on!

792
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,640
Hey, tell your sister
to let go of my tail,

793
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,933
you weak-wristed nancy-boy!

794
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,438
Get off me, you fat bastard!

795
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,066
I'll shove an "Arnie Loves You"
lunch box up your ass!

796
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,735
- Right!
- That was nothing.

797
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,071
- Marty!
- Samuel!

798
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,199
- Hi, honey! We'll be right with you.
- He is such a jerk.

799
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,242
- Shit, we're in trouble.
- Oh sure, run to Mommy.

800
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,745
- He started it.
- I'll wipe the floor with you.

801
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,845
Wow. That's quite
a breakfast you've got there.

802
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,972
Mm-hmm.

803
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,142
You certainly
got your appetite back.

804
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,687
Mm, boy.

805
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,146
I don't know if you noticed,

806
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,440
but the first three months
were really tough on me.

807
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,276
But now my breasts don't hurt,

808
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,279
no more nausea, no more insomnia.
I feel great.

809
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,949
Oh, good news.

810
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,284
So I was thinking, you know,

811
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,787
I know it's been two months
since we made love,

812
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:12,208
but maybe we could
fool around tonight.

813
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,295
Check!
Leave the breakfast.

814
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,798
No, but I haven't
finished the food.

815
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,446
- I'll be right back.
- What?

816
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,156
I'll be right back.

817
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,241
- Wait here for me.
- Yeah, right. Right.

818
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,326
Ready when you are.

819
00:45:56,962 --> 00:46:03,134
Ah!

820
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,432

- What is it?
- It moved.

836
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,612
Huh? What moved?

837
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,447
The baby, it moved.

838
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,783
Oh.

839
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:12,537
- Oh, right.
- Here. Put your hand here.

840
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,747
It's like bubbles.

841
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,673
- I don't feel anything.
- No, just wait.

842
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,680
Oh, it stopped.

843
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,224
- What a shame.
- Yeah.

844
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,434
- It's an incredible feeling.
- Yeah?

845
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,478
- Yeah.
- Well...

846
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,605
I guess I got
plenty more time to feel it.

847
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,149
Yeah. Yeah.

848
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,080
Honey, do you think
we're hurting the baby?

849
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,750
No. No.

850
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:07,300
Because if I can feel it,
then it can feel me.

851
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,344
No, I don't think so.

852
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:14,223
- I don't think so.
- Yes. Yes.

853
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,517
Yes, it can.

854
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,519
What if the baby can see?

855
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,064
Um, see what, my love?

856
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,775
Your penis coming toward it.

857
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,861
That could scare the hell
out of a baby.

858
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,071
Rebecca, I...

859
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,991
What if your penis hit it in the head
and caused brain damage or something?

860
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,952
- Are you serious?
- I don't know. I don't know.

861
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,123
I just don't think we should make love
until we talk to the doctor.

862
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,751
Please?

863
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:45,129
We don't know
what could happen, hon.

864
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,091
Okay.

865
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,135
Fine.

866
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,095
Fine. Fine. Fine.

867
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,432
But you know what?

868
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,519
I bet if we wait a while,
we can feel the baby move again.

869
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,941
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

870
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,527
That'll be just as much fun.

871
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,138
- That's my game.
- Fuck! Shit! Shit!

872
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,852
- Hey, hey, Sam.
- Fuck!

873
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,399
Okay, that's it.

874
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,276
No more tennis for today.
That's it.

875
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,779
What happened to
your British etiquette?

876
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:55,658
This John McEnroe thing
is scaring me.

877
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,870
Sam, what's the matter?
What's the matter?

878
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,081
I am in the middle
of a nervous breakdown.

879
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,208
I can see.
You're gonna have a thrombo.

880
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,377
What's the matter?
Why?

881
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:10,297
Okay.
Rebecca is pregnant. There.

882
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,341
What?

883
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,220
I am completely sexually frustrated.
I do not sleep at night.

884
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,556
I have these appalling
nightmares all the time.

885
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,307
About what?

886
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:23,144
The latest nightmare
is that the baby is deformed.

887
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,105
You know, it's missing an arm
or it's got little cauliflower ears

888
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,190
or an eye
in the middle of its forehead.

889
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,234
I can't stand it.
I don't know why.

890
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,153
Do you want the baby?

891
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,655
I don't know what I want anymore.

892
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,824
Well, what about an abortion?

893
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,827
No, we're in the fifth month.
It's too late.

894
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,705
Absolutely.
Sit. Sit. Sit. Relax.

895
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,166
Let's talk about this for real.
My God.

896
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,169
Jesus.
I mean, you love Rebecca, right?

897
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:51,380
- Yeah, I adore her.
- Okay, okay.

898
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,841
You've gotta be honest
with her, you know?

899
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,386
Always let her know how you're feeling.
You've gotta talk to her.

900
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,764
Talk to her.
Christine and I never talked.

901
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,141
We were idiots. We threw it all away,
and now look at me.

902
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,310
Look what I've become.

903
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,854
What do you mean? You have
a wonderful time dating young girls.

904
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,273
Sam, my life's a pile of shit.

905
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,026
It's a pile of shit.

906
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,778
It's empty and pointless,
all those women.

907
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,821
My sister Gail is right.
If I continue this way,

908
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,908
I'm facing a lifetime alone

909
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,660
without a family.

910
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:25,498
I don't want to die like Van Gogh.
It's terrifying.

911
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,292
If you want to know the truth,

912
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,046
man, I'd give anything
to have Christine back.

913
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,381
That's the truth.
And sometimes...

914
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:37,134
God strike me dead
for admitting this,

915
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,053
sometimes I think
I'd like to be a father.

916
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:45,434
Sorry. Right, you're serious.
You'd probably make a good dad.

917
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,311
Well, you know, whatever.

918
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,063
But me and you,
we're getting older.

919
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,900
I think it's time for us
to face our responsibilities.

920
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:56,445
But don't lose Rebecca.

921
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,240
She's the best thing
that ever happened to you.

922
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,118
Hey, guys.
It's the 30th.

923
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,621
- Your membership fees are due.
- My sister takes care of that.

924
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,164
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

925
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,625
Wait. Did she just say
it was the 30th?

926
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,794
- Yeah, why?
- Shit.

927
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,504
- What's up?
- Shit.

928
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,173
- What's the matter?
- This isn't happening. No.

929
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,342
What?

930
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,012
Today's our second ultrasound.
I've missed it.

931
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,098
I swore I wouldn't miss it.
I've missed it.

932
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,891
Uh-oh.

933
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,727
The appointment was at 11:00.
I can make it.

934
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:31,272
- Go.
- Yeah.

935
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,320
Shit.

936
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,364
Oh, shit.

937
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,992
Shit.

938
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,286
Shit. Shit. Shit.

939
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,793
Sorry.

940
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,004
- Dr. Thatcher, please.
- She's in there.

941
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,381
Sir, do I have you down
for an appointment?

942
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,800
Sir?

943
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,594
- Mr. Faulkner?
- Yeah.

944
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,637
She left about 15 minutes ago.

945
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,436
Thanks. Thank you.

946
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,771
Would you like to know the sex?

947
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,526
You mean the sex of the baby?

948
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,278
Mm-hmm.

949
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,822
Wow.

950
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,827
- Does Rebecca know?
- Yes.

951
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,956
Okay, then.

952
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,584
It's a boy.

953
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,633
A boy.

954
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,348
Thanks.

955
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,892
- Thanks very much.
- Mm-hmm.

956
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,644
Great.

957
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,188
So...

958
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:58,525
that means, presumably,
you can actually see his whatnot.

959
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,654
- Penis.
- Penis. Yeah.

960
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,656
And it's fine, is it?

961
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,532
I mean, size-wise
and all that kind of stuff?

962
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,201
Perfect.

963
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,246
Right. Lovely.

964
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:14,541
And I assume everything else
is as it should be.

965
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,920
You know, the lip and eyes
in the right spot?

966
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,340
And nothing whatsoever here?

967
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,550
Everything looks fine.

968
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:27,429
Here, watch this with Rebecca.
She forgot to take it.

969
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,431
Yeah. Okay, good.

970
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,520
This is... that's actually him?
That's my son?

971
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,397
Mm-hmm.

972
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:42,903
Thank you.

973
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,615
- Mr. Faulkner?
- Yeah?

974
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,785
Pregnant women need
a lot of support.

975
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,746
Be affectionate with her.
Kiss her a lot.

976
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:56,000
She was pretty emotional earlier.

977
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,504
Right.

978
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,135
Thanks.

979
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,354
Bec?

980
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,785
Hi.

981
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,916
What are you doing?

982
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,670
I'm leaving.

983
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,672
Bec, wait.

984
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,925
I mean, I know I've missed
a few appointments, but...

985
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,470
Look, you don't care about me.

986
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,347
You don't care about this baby.

987
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:55,434
You're too wrapped up in your own
feelings to deal with this pregnancy.

988
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,979
You're just not ready to be a father.

989
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,941
- Where will you go?
- Marty and Gail's.

990
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,069
Marty and Gail's?

991
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,654
I don't wanna
move in with my parents

992
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,615
and all my girlfriends are single.

993
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:13,494
They don't need some pregnant
person living with them.

994
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,288
Gail and I have gotten
to be really close.

995
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,499
She knows what it's like
to be pregnant,

996
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,667
and she'll get me through this.

997
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,839
- And the baby?
- I'll raise the baby.

998
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,510
Alone?

999
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,054
Yeah.

1000
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:37,142
I'll get an apartment.
I can do it by myself.

1001
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,980
Bec.

1002
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,210
His little heart's beating.

1003
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,382
- Marty, hi.
- Hi.

1004
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,841
Is she here?

1005
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,677
She said she never
wants to see you again.

1006
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,346
Please, please, just let me
talk to her for two seconds.

1007
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,515
I feel for you, buddy.
But if I let you in here,

1008
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,184
I'm gonna be in the dog house big time
and I'm gonna have to live with you.

1009
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,812
- You're a great kisser and all, but...
- Marty, who is it?

1010
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,982
- It's my mom, honey.
- But your mother's dead.

1011
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,110
- I know. It's really weird. I'm sorry.
- Marty, please. Please.

1012
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:36,488
Look, at least
just tell her one... just...

1013
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:11,481
What do you think of this?
Take a look at this.

1014
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:21,700
You're aiming specifically
at the hotel-room market now, huh?

1015
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,872
You're right.
It's a hotel-room painting.

1016
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,500
That's what it is.
It's terrible. Look at that.

1017
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:33,462
- What happened to the nudes?
- They weren't selling.

1018
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,589
It's cheaper for guys to buy
a copy of "Playboy."

1019
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,175
This is terrible. Here.
Bon voyage. Goodbye.

1020
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:41,303
I deep-sixed it. There.
Sleep with the fishes.

1021
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,180
You're absolutely right.

1022
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,057
I can smell the room service
on that painting.

1023
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,476
It's terrible.
But it's you.

1024
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,895
It's that you're around.

1025
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,064
That's why I'm painting this way.
You're very unhappy.

1026
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:55,817
You're like the antidote
to exhilaration.

1027
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,112
If I take any more of this in,
I'm gonna be painting cats and clowns.

1028
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,616
Is it Rebecca?
You haven't heard from her?

1029
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,035
No, I haven't heard from her.

1030
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:09,331
I've told you so many times,
she refuses to see me.

1031
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,709
She won't answer my calls,

1032
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:15,170
reply to my letters.

1033
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,632
It's a total shutoff.

1034
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:23,178
I've thrown away the most
important thing in my life.

1035
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,806
Just like that.

1036
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,393
You need a new outlook.

1037
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,104
No, no, don't scoff.

1038
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,981
Listen, forget about Rebecca.

1039
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:38,527
How could you say that to me?
You were the one who pointed out,

1040
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,821
reminded me that she
was the most important thing

1041
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:43,198
in my life only just weeks ago.

1042
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:47,494
I never said that.

1043
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,913
You said it at the tennis court.

1044
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,916
Oh, yeah, I did.

1045
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,836
Well, so what if I did?
That was then, but now it's over.

1046
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:58,755
You gotta get on with your life.

1047
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:02,259
Listen to this:
Buy some new clothes.

1048
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,887
I'm telling you,
we'll learn a new sport.

1049
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,558
I'll throw a party, and you'll meet
some new people.

1050
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,310
Come on.
We'll have some fun.

1051
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,688
I don't think so, Sean.

1052
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:18,150
Start with a smile.
Just smile, for heaven's sakes.

1053
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,612
Well, that's hideous.

1054
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,992
But, you know, that's the idea.

1098
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:54,347
- Thanks for the ride home.
- Pleasure. Pleasure.

1099
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,438
Wanna come up for coffee?

1100
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:07,527
No, thanks.
No. I'm just gonna shoot off.

1101
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,613
Oh.

1102
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,032
Do you wanna come up for sex?

1103
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:17,287
Wow.

1104
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:21,082
That's pretty direct.

1105
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,251
Um...

1106
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:29,132
No, the thing is, Lili, I think...

1107
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,468
I mean,
you're incredibly attractive,

1108
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,512
but I think it's just a bit early
for me to get involved.

1109
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,891
So I'll take a rain check on that.
Another day.

1110
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,275
All right, seriously folks,
if you guys travel a lot,

1111
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,485
this is the perfect vehicle 'cause you
got a lot of room in the back.

1112
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:14,154
You can actually put a queen size
waterbed in the back.

1113
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,197
- You ever been on a waterbed?
- I love waterbeds.

1114
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:19,993
- Can I help you, sir?
- I'm looking for Mr. Dwyer.

1115
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,620
- He's right over there.
- Thanks.

1116
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:25,623
That's nice on a cross-country journey.
Listen, I'll be right back.

1117
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,792
Okay, just enjoy the car.

1118
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,670
Thanks for coming down, man.
I missed you.

1119
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,672
Thanks.

1120
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,175
Well, this is very painful for me,

1121
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:37,719
but I want to buy a new car.

1122
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,346
Buddy!
It's about time.

1123
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:42,223
We happen to have a few
around here, you know.

1124
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,350
Listen, how's Rebecca?

1125
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:46,436
- She's great.
- You're taking good care of her?

1126
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,189
Yeah, Gail's taking her out shopping
and they're exercising and stuff.

1127
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:51,274
Then I make them
dinner every night.

1128
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,026
Right.
She's really doing okay?

1129
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,904
Yeah, she is.
The first month was bad, crying a lot.

1130
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,364
But she hasn't even mentioned
your name in the last two weeks.

1131
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:00,533
I think she's getting over you.

1132
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,203
Come here.
This is the car for you.

1133
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,413
Listen, Marty.

1134
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,373
- Yes?
- I need to see her.

1135
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,417
- She doesn't want to see you.
- I know, I know.

1136
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,545
But I really have to speak to her, okay?
I want her back.

1137
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,881
That's gonna take
a lot of convincing.

1138
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:19,219
Please, do something for me.
Just organize a chance meeting.

1139
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:21,471
Like you bring her
to a grocery store

1140
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,473
or a restaurant or something
and I just happen to be there.

1141
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,892
- I don't know.
- I know, I know, I know.

1142
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,770
Ask Gail if I could babysit your kids
on Saturday afternoon.

1143
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,272
- You want to babysit for my kids?
- Yes! In fact, it's brilliant,

1144
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,441
because then it will convince Rebecca
that I like being around children.

1145
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,986
No, no, no. That's gonna get me
in big trouble with Gail.

1146
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:39,239
You know how mad she gets.
No.

1147
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:41,741
Marty, please do this for me!

1148
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,494
Okay. Okay, I will.

1149
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,996
Thanks.
Excellent. Excellent.

1150
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:48,581
Excellent.

1151
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,223
Oh, there we go.

1152
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,350
- This is fun, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1153
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:10,145
Isn't this jolly, Molly?
Yes.

1154
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:11,980
Listen to this.

1155
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,984
"I removed the victim's brains
with an ice-cream scooper."

1156
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,861
Awesome, huh?

1157
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,612
Shannon, there are
other children here,

1158
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,614
and they really don't want to hear
all that beastly stuff, all right?

1159
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,199
So you just be quiet, hmm?

1160
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:25,660
- Higher!
- Yes, higher.

1161
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,121
Patsy, no.
That's not funny, my love.

1162
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,789
Don't strangle the little boy.

1163
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:33,001
But he likes it.
Say uncle!

1164
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,420
- Yes, that's it.
- Hey, Sam!

1165
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,630
- Just put him down.
- Sam!

1166
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:39,674
Shit.

1167
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,635
- Sam, are you okay?
- All right. Fine.

1168
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:44,804
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Good.

1169
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,307
We're all getting on well here.

1170
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:50,226
- Is Rebecca coming?
- No.

1171
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:54,522
- No? Marty, we had an agreement.
- She's in the hospital, Sam.

1172
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,317
- The hospital?
- Yeah.

1173
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:58,860
Why? What's wrong?

1174
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,570
There might be a problem
with the pregnancy.

1175
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,071
What kind of problem?
What are you talking about?

1176
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,032
The doctors don't know yet,
but she's with them.

1177
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,701
- And they're good doctors.
- Jesus Chr...

1178
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,870
Be careful, Sam.

1179
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,129
- Which room is Rebecca Taylor in?
- 615.

1180
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,465
- Where's that?
- Just around the corner.

1181
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:26,095
Gail.

1182
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:27,847
- Hi.
- So is she gonna be all right?

1183
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:31,267
- Yeah, she's gonna be fine.
- Oh.

1184
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:34,020
She just started
having some contractions

1185
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,521
and she started dilating a little,

1186
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:37,273
so they just want to keep her
here overnight,

1187
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:38,858
restrict her movement.

1188
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:40,902
It just sometimes happens
in the seventh month.

1189
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:44,906
- The baby's okay?
- Yeah, baby's great.

1190
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,370
So, can I see her?

1191
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,708
- Don't upset her.
- I won't.

1192
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:58,211
- Promise?
- Yeah, promise.

1193
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,048
Okay.

1194
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,300
Thanks.

1195
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:15,270
- Hi.
- Hi.

1196
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,235
What are you doing here?

1197
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:27,740
Well, you know, I was worried
about you and the baby.

1198
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,744
We're gonna be fine.

1199
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:34,497
Yeah, that's what Gail said.

1200
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:44,799
Is this... is this noise...

1201
01:11:46,176 --> 01:11:49,178
- Is that the baby's heartbeat?
- Yeah.

1202
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:54,183
- Strong.
- Yeah.

1203
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:00,898
Bec, I'm sorry.

1204
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,527
I'm so sorry.

1205
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:08,114
I was a disgrace.

1206
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,408
I mean, I know...

1207
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:14,078
I know now exactly
what a bastard I was.

1208
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:17,332
I was... I was completely selfish,

1209
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:21,002
and you had absolutely
every right to walk out on me.

1210
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,715
But I just want you to reconsider.

1211
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:29,552
- Sam, please, no.
- Let me just explain.

1212
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,095
I think...

1213
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:33,139
I know that I've changed.

1214
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,641
You don't believe in change.

1215
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,477
No, I do. I do now.

1216
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:39,312
Change is great.
Change is what it's all about.

1217
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,065
Anyone who doesn't believe
in change is a coward,

1218
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:43,983
which is what I was.

1219
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:45,735
I was scared.

1220
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,780
I was scared of losing control

1221
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:52,408
and of losing you

1222
01:12:52,576 --> 01:12:56,329
or what we had together,
and losing my youth.

1223
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:01,417
- Aren't you now?
- No, especially not my youth.

1224
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:04,712
I mean, my youth is here,
doing well.

1225
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,341
I'd really love to believe this.

1226
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:11,260
Listen, I've seen
the second ultrasound,

1227
01:13:11,428 --> 01:13:14,263
the one you left at Dr. Thatcher's
the day I was late.

1228
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:16,224
The point is...

1229
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,811
I don't care what I think
or don't think anymore.

1230
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:23,022
I don't give a damn about me.

1231
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:28,820
- I'm in love with my child.
- You are?

1232
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:34,200
And I'm completely in love
with you for having it.

1233
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:38,704
Samuel, you almost
ruined everything, and I...

1234
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:42,041
Please.
It's the seventh month.

1235
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,210
The baby can hear you.

1236
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:46,879
How do you know that?

1237
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:49,590
Because I know about babies now.
I've been reading up.

1238
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,384
You know, Dr. Brazelton.

1239
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:52,885
"What to Expect
When You're Expecting."

1240
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:55,012
Penelope Leach.
I've been to a Lamaze class.

1241
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,640
- I was the only single father there.
- Really?

1242
01:13:57,808 --> 01:13:59,684
And I sold the Porsche.

1243
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,310
Oh, I don't believe that.

1244
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:04,897
Yep. Marty gave me
a terrible deal on a big family car.

1245
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:06,983
- He did?
- Yes, it's parked outside.

1246
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:09,527
Car seat, family extras.

1247
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:13,489
It just needs a family.

1248
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,495
And...

1249
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,916
there's this.

1250
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,595
Open it.

1251
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:48,983
Would you be my wife?

1252
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,778
Yes.

1253
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:03,289
Yes!

1254
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,377
On one condition.

1255
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,630
Okay.

1256
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:12,465
Lose the earring.

1257
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:15,635
Okay, it's gone.

1272
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:11,148
Thank you. I've always wanted
to be carried over a threshold.

1273
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,359
- Good.
- Are you all right?

1274
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:15,194
Yeah.

1275
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:16,696
- I've got something to show you.
- Yeah?

1276
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,083
Oh, Samuel.

1277
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:34,547
It's...

1278
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:37,216
It's beautiful.

1279
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:40,219
You did this all by yourself?

1280
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,513
Yeah. Yeah.

1281
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,475
Thank you.

1282
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:51,105
It's perfect.

1283
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,081
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.

1284
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:12,627
But my feet are really swollen
and my back's killing me.

1285
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,380
Well, look, leave this to me.

1286
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,466
I'm going to pull a few strings.

1287
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,426
All right.

1288
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,390
Hi. Look, I'm sorry to bother you,
but my wife's pregnant.

1289
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:28,934
In fact, she's due in two weeks,
and I was just wondering...

1290
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,229
Lili.

1291
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:34,857
- Samuel.
- Hi.

1292
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,859
- Hi.
- What a coincidence.

1293
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:40,279
How long have
you been working here?

1294
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:43,282
- Three weeks.
- Three weeks?

1295
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:46,577
How are things?

1296
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:48,329
Busy.

1297
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,168
Obviously.

1298
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,505
So listen, Lili, how long is the wait
for a table gonna be?

1299
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:01,217
Give me a few minutes.
I'll seat you right away.

1300
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,260
Okay, great.

1301
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:05,304
Great.

1302
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,392
Well, succes.

1303
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:12,436
- She's just setting the table now.
- Do you know her?

1304
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:14,855
- Who?
- The hostess.

1305
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:16,691
- The hostess?
- Mm-hmm.

1306
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:19,485
I've never seen her before in my life.

1307
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,821
Samuel.

1308
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:28,994
- She called you Samuel.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1309
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:30,705
That's my name.

1310
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,998
Yeah, but you're on
a first-name basis

1311
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,501
with a woman you've never
seen before in your life?

1312
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,837
She took my first name.
See?

1313
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:40,464
Some places, they do that.
They take the first name.

1314
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:43,008
Some places they use last names.
Here, they use first names.

1315
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:45,511
- You're silly.
- Yeah.

1316
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,054
You're paranoid.

1317
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:49,348
- Well, sorry.
- Go on.

1318
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:57,189
- What is it?
- I think that...

1319
01:18:57,357 --> 01:19:00,151
- Shit!
- What? What?

1320
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:02,570
- I cut my hand.
- Wow, that's bad.

1321
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,530
- Samuel.
- Hang on. This is quite serious.

1322
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:06,115
- Samuel.
- That is going to need stitches.

1323
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:07,658
- Samuel.
- What?

1324
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,493
- My water broke.
- We'll get you another.

1325
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:12,037
No, my water broke!

1326
01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:14,457
- This water broke?
- Yeah.

1327
01:19:14,624 --> 01:19:16,876
- That means it's time, doesn't it?
- That's right, it's time.

1328
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:18,502
- Then we've gotta go to the hospital.
- Right.

1329
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:20,463
Go! Go! Go!

1330
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:22,715
Wait. Wait for me!

1331
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:28,804
I got the doctor's machine again.

1332
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:31,724
Where could he be?
At some bloody doctor's party?

1333
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:34,935
The bastard.
Come on. Please go faster.

1334
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:36,896
When did you sell the Porsche?

1335
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:40,941
I knew it!

1336
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:44,195
- What, hon?
- You slept with her, didn't you?

1337
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:47,656
- While we were apart.
- Listen, it was completely innocent.

1338
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:50,659
Nothing happened.
I was completely faithful to you.

1339
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:52,787
Lili, tell her.
Wasn't I completely faithful?

1340
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:55,372
- Completely faithful.
- There. See?

1341
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,541
No. I don't believe you.
If it was all so innocent,

1342
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,418
then why did you lie
about knowing her?

1343
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:03,172
Only because I didn't want to upset you
because you were in a fragile state.

1344
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,508
I'm in a much more fragile state now.

1345
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:08,135
Listen, I swear to you,
on the life of my child,

1346
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,429
I did not sleep with this woman!

1347
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:15,184
Samuel, stop!

1348
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:17,186
Jesus.

1349
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:26,278
Jesus.

1350
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:31,283
- I'm sorry. Are you all right?
- You stupid son of a bitch!

1351
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:34,203
- He has a heart condition!
- My wife...

1352
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,996
- Learn to drive!
- I'm sorry.

1353
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:39,625
What?
George! Are you all right?

1354
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:43,546
- I'm having chest pains.
- I'll call an ambulance.

1355
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:46,590
Look, I'm on the way to the hospital,
if you'd like a ride.

1356
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,188
Where is Dr. Green?

1357
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:05,818
Get off the phone and drive,
limey scumbag!

1358
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:08,445
Would you leave me alone?
Leave me alone, you mad witch!

1359
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:10,364
Get off! Sorry.

1360
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:12,116
Where is Dr. Green?

1361
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:13,909
- Did you try his home number?
- Yes.

1362
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:16,370
- What about his beeper?
- Yes. No.

1363
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:19,498
- Do you have that number?
- Yeah, it's around here somewhere.

1364
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:28,382
Where is that bloody number?

1365
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:33,178
Samuel.

1366
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:34,638
- I got it.
- The bicycle!

1367
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,859
Jesus.

1368
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:50,696
- I'm sorry. Are you all right?
- My leg is broken.

1369
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,865
- Shit!
- Help me.

1370
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,742
- Yes! Help!
- Help me.

1371
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,785
Just stay there.
Just stay there.

1372
01:21:56,953 --> 01:22:01,040
Are you trying to kill everyone
in San Francisco, you asshole?

1373
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:03,334
We don't have time for this.

1374
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:06,378
My husband is having
a heart attack!

1375
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:16,055
- Where are you taking me?
- Shut up, or I'll break the other leg!

1376
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:31,570
You! Over here.

1377
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:34,365
I've got stitches, heart attack,
woman in labor,

1378
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:35,866
oh, and broken leg.

1379
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:39,078
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- Oh, my God.

1380
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:41,705
Come! Quick!

1381
01:22:43,249 --> 01:22:44,708
Gently, gently.

1382
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:47,252
There we go.
Got it. Got it.

1383
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,510
Please. Please.
Please. Please.

1384
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,595
She's... please!

1385
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,599
Lady, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1386
01:23:02,268 --> 01:23:04,645
- It's all right, honey.
- I beg your pardon.

1387
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,696
Hi.

1388
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:15,656
Shit.

1389
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:18,659
- I'm sorry. Are you all right?
- Get me out of here.

1390
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,494
You all right?

1391
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:23,372
- May I help you?
- Yes. Rebecca Faulkner for Dr. Green.

1392
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,457
- Her water's broken.
- I'll get the doctor for you, sir.

1393
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:27,418
Okay.
Come on! Move!

1394
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:29,336
- Hey, don't push me!
- Okay, I beg your pardon.

1395
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,964
- I'll get the doctor.
- Honey, how are you feeling?

1396
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,091
- The baby's ready.
- What do you mean ready?

1397
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:35,801
To come out!

1398
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:38,887
Jesus Christ Almighty.
Where is the bloody doctor?

1399
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:41,473
Here I am.

1400
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:43,642
Please, don't do that.

1401
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,186
No! No! Hi.

1402
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,397
Where's Dr. Green?
Where's our doctor?

1403
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,232
- Miami.
- Miami?

1404
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,484
He is on vacation.
You are two weeks early.

1405
01:23:52,652 --> 01:23:55,154
You're not the replacement
doctor, are you?

1406
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:57,948
- Yes, I am.
- No.

1407
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:00,075
Oh, no.
I want someone else.

1408
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:01,994
- There is nobody else.
- There must be.

1409
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:03,829
There must be someone else.
Find me another doctor!

1410
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:06,248
There's no one else!
All right?!

1411
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:09,501
It is a full moon.
Everybody is going into labor.

1412
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:12,087
Look around you.
There are not enough doctors.

1413
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:15,007
There are not enough nurses
and not enough delivery rooms, okay?

1414
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:17,801
So unless you want to deliver
this baby yourself, follow me!

1415
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:19,636
Ow!

1416
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:23,766
Oh, God. I'm okay.

1417
01:24:23,933 --> 01:24:27,478
I'm a little nervous, okay?
It's my first delivery.

1418
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:33,358
If there aren't any delivery rooms,
where is she having the baby?

1419
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:35,360
I'm gonna put her in
with another one of my patients.

1420
01:24:35,528 --> 01:24:36,695
You mean we're sharing a room?

1421
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:39,406
I'm sorry.
We're a little overbooked, okay?

1422
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:41,366
Let's go!

1423
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:44,912
We must get this woman on the
delivery table immediately, if not later.

1424
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:48,040
- Come on. Let's go.
- Where are you taking me?

1425
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:51,668
You're looking good.
You're dilated to seven centimeters.

1426
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:54,797
- How much is that?
- Like that. Okay? Got it?

1427
01:24:54,964 --> 01:24:57,508
Very good.

1428
01:24:57,675 --> 01:24:59,593
You look uncomfortable.
I'm going to raise you down.

1429
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,554
- No! Don't touch anything!
- All right. All right.

1430
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:06,391
Hey, buddy.

1431
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:07,893
What are you doing here?

1432
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:10,646
I'm cruising for chicks. Come on,
I'm having a baby, for God's sakes.

1433
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:14,566
Hi. Hi.
How are you feeling?

1434
01:25:14,734 --> 01:25:16,902
You look terrible.
Just terrible.

1435
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,571
- All good. Sounds very good.
- Where's my husband?

1436
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:21,615
- She wasn't due for three weeks.
- I know, but it's a full moon.

1437
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,325
Women are spouting
them out like crazy.

1438
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:26,328
Oh, good, everybody's old friends.
Back to work!

1439
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:28,747
Smile, Doc.
How's she doing over there, Doc?

1440
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:30,999
She's great.
God bless America, okay?

1441
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:33,252
Honey.
Honey, smile.

1442
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:35,420
Smile for me, honey.
I love you so much. Smile.

1443
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:38,632
You're so beautiful.
It's not bad, is it? It doesn't hurt.

1444
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,468
- I need something for the pain.
- Okay, I'll get you something.

1445
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:43,804
I need something.
Knock me out!

1446
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:46,974
Knock me... ow!

1447
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,602
Can't you give her
something for the pain?

1448
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:52,938
- You don't want natural childbirth?
- No!

1449
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:56,233
- Okay. You want Anastasia?
- What?

1450
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,277
- Drugs, yes?
- Yes!

1451
01:25:58,444 --> 01:26:00,112
Okay, give me a moment.
I'm thinking.

1452
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,447
- You mean you don't know?
- Kind of.

1453
01:26:02,615 --> 01:26:04,449
Well, think, you commie bastard!

1454
01:26:04,617 --> 01:26:06,618
- Shut up, you limey bitch!
- Sorry.

1455
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,622
I can't take the pressure.
Don't yell at me.

1456
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:13,709
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
It's fine. It's fine.

1457
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:15,544
Valium!

1458
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:18,463
- Valium's no good for her.
- No, for me.

1459
01:26:18,631 --> 01:26:20,090
No!

1460
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:21,967
- I've got it!
- Oh, thank God.

1461
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:23,385
- Nurse.
- Yes, Doctor?

1462
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:26,263
Call the anesthesiologist.
This woman needs an enema.

1463
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:27,681
- An enema?
- Enema?

1464
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:30,767
- Enema?
- No. She needs a pedicure.

1465
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:33,312
- Pedicure?
- This ain't no goddamn beauty parlor.

1466
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:35,939
- Epitaph!
- She's not dead, you moron!

1467
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:38,066
Epidermis?
What is it? Epilady?

1468
01:26:38,234 --> 01:26:40,944
- Epidural, asshole!
- That's right!

1469
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:42,613
Yes! That's what I mean.

1470
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,740
- Go on, then!
- Epidural. Epidural.

1471
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:48,118
I always get those confused...
Enema, pedicure, epidermal.

1472
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:49,828
I should buy myself a clitoris.

1473
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:52,122
Clitor... you need
a thesaurus is what you need!

1474
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:54,291
A clitoris.
Don't even know what he needs.

1475
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,668
What are you doing?
Go away from here.

1476
01:26:56,836 --> 01:26:59,338
Honey, I'm so proud of you
and I love you so much.

1477
01:26:59,505 --> 01:27:01,548
I hate you.
You did this to me!

1478
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:05,219
You miserable piece
of dick-brained horseshit!

1479
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:09,890
Slime-sucking
son of a whore bitch!

1480
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:11,558
That's perfect, sweetheart.

1481
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:13,352
I got it all on film.
The kids are gonna love it.

1482
01:27:13,519 --> 01:27:15,479
Maybe I'll put it in the...

1483
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:17,189
Get out! Get out!

1484
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:19,608
You're the one!
You are the one!

1485
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:23,237
Hi, everyone. Hi, I'm Dr. Newsoe.
I'm here to administer the epidural.

1486
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:25,197
Oh, yes! Thank God!

1487
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:27,741
You're going to inject
that thing into my wife?

1488
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,535
Mm-hmm.
Right into her spine.

1489
01:27:30,703 --> 01:27:33,997
Uh-huh.
Good. Excellent.

1490
01:27:34,165 --> 01:27:36,166
- Hey!
- Where are you going?

1491
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:39,044
Look, you see?
That is why women have the babies.

1492
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:42,422
You see?
Because men can't handle the pa...

1493
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,341
- Hey, you guys!
- Nurse!

1494
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:47,386
Get some smelling salts
and get these men up off the floor!

1495
01:27:47,553 --> 01:27:49,554
- It's okay, honey.
- Help me. Help me.

1496
01:27:49,722 --> 01:27:51,723
Breathe.
We'll help you.

1497
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:55,185
- I need some help.
- Take a deep breath.

1498
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:58,230
I need some help.

1499
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,898
- No time for an epidural.
- No? Why?

1500
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:03,277
- Where are you sending him?
- There's no time for an epidural.

1501
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:05,070
I checked her cervix.
She's dilated to 10.

1502
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:08,115
Doctor, this woman
is also dilated to 10.

1503
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,908
Hi, everybody. Smile big!

1504
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:13,078
- Give me a smile.
- What are you doing?

1505
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:15,122
I'm recording history.
I'm making you guys a souvenir.

1506
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,582
- Isn't it great?
- Get that thing off her face now!

1507
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:19,626
- We watch them at Christmas.
- Give it to me!

1508
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:23,422
- Whoa, I got a great shot of the head.
- I don't give a...

1509
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:25,382
- Asshole!
- You broke my camera.

1510
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:28,427
- Yeah.
- Sam, I'm sorry.

1511
01:28:28,594 --> 01:28:31,096
Listen, I'm sorry, man.
I got a little carried away.

1512
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:33,140
You bastard!

1513
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,434
What?
Wait there.

1514
01:28:40,898 --> 01:28:43,275
It's too late for the medication.
Hold on. I'm coming.

1515
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:44,609
Whoa!

1516
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:49,990
Keep breathing.
Breathe, breathe.

1517
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:01,752
I cannot believe
you're fighting now!

1518
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:03,670
This is my moment.

1519
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:05,964
- It is your moment.
- This is my miracle.

1520
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:10,010
Samuel!

1521
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:14,639
Four, five, six, seven...

1522
01:29:14,807 --> 01:29:17,059
Now we're ready
for the final push, all right?

1523
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:19,394
And you push!

1524
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:21,897
There you go. There!

1525
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,983
And she's out!

1526
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:31,239
I will get the clamp. There we go.
And the scissors.

1527
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:34,409
There we go.
And she is free from you.

1528
01:29:34,577 --> 01:29:37,996
You have a girl.
Unless I cut the wrong cord.

1529
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:40,332
Bad joke. I'm very sorry.

1530
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,544
We go see Papa.

1531
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:52,177
Okay.
Hey, congratulations, Papa.

1532
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,179
You have a big, beautiful girl.

1533
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:57,057
Can we still call her Samuel?

1534
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:00,310
- She's not yours. She's yours.
- No, she's not.

1535
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:03,480
No, she's not.
I've already got three girls.

1536
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:06,024
- Four, actually, counting this one.
- Holy shit!

1537
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:09,194
Jeez.
Good luck on your new baby.

1538
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:15,534
What's going on here, honey?
I bought all that cowboy stuff.

1539
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:17,702
I bought all that cowboy stuff
and I bought the sports stuff

1540
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:20,038
and I bought all the other stuff.

1541
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:22,374
Is there another one in there, honey?
What happened?

1542
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:24,543
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Yes, she is, honey.

1543
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,378
But how's she gonna play
for the 49ers?

1544
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,381
- She could play.
- No. You think so?

1545
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:34,052
- Yeah, she could do anything.
- She's got a pretty good arm.

1546
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:37,848
Push.
One, two, three, four,

1547
01:30:38,015 --> 01:30:42,769
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10.

1548
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:44,938
Come on.
Work for your baby. Work.

1549
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:51,653
All right, I know it hurts,
but you have to come back now.

1550
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:53,738
Listen to me. Okay?

1551
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:57,242
I don't want you to tear.
You have to control your push.

1552
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:59,411
It's burning.
It's burning.

1553
01:31:01,914 --> 01:31:05,417
Here you go!
The baby's head is out. Syringe.

1554
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:08,420
One more push
and you will see your baby.

1555
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,340
Time for the final push.

1556
01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:14,968
You ready?
Here we go. Ready?

1557
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,762
Easy, easy, easy.
Easy. Easy.

1558
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:24,436
You have it.

1559
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:27,939
Another clamp, please.
Another clamp.

1560
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:32,569
Open your eyes.
Take a look at your son.

1561
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:37,282
- You have a boy, a beautiful boy.
- Oh, my God.

1562
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,126
Say hello to Papa.

1563
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,505
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1564
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:53,298
Thank you for choosing me.

1565
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:56,801
He's very handsome.
He's got very big testicles, too.

1566
01:31:56,969 --> 01:31:58,553
Well, yes, he would have.

1567
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:01,806
All right, okay.

1568
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:10,190
- Goodbye.
- Thanks.

1569
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:14,236
- You see this?
- I know. It's great, isn't it?

1570
01:32:18,157 --> 01:32:20,158
We're a family.

1571
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:26,414
Thanks.

1572
01:32:57,488 --> 01:32:59,197
Hey.

1573
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:01,658
She's looking at me.

1574
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:03,201
She's got your eyes.

1575
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:04,869
- Think so?
- Yeah.

1576
01:33:05,037 --> 01:33:08,164
- And your hair and your figure, in fact.
- Shut up.

1577
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:12,043
I guess having
another girl's not so bad.

1578
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:14,671
Yeah. I mean, you'll just have to
keep trying for a boy.

1579
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:17,465
- Yeah.
- Think of all the new positions.

1580
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:19,634
Yeah.

1581
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:21,970
Jesus, poor Gail.

1582
01:33:23,222 --> 01:33:24,723
Listen, I'm sorry
about your camera.

1583
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:27,684
Oh, no. I was out of line.
It's my fault.

1584
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:32,188
Mart...

1585
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:37,527
I just want to say thanks.

1586
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:39,863
For what?

1587
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:43,033
Well, for today.
For...

1588
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:46,828
Without you and Gail,
I just probably wouldn't be here

1589
01:33:46,996 --> 01:33:51,082
and probably wouldn't
be a dad, so...

1590
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:54,669
You're welcome, buddy.
I love you.

1591
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,048
And I love you, big guy.

1592
01:33:58,215 --> 01:34:00,800
- Hey!
- Hey, we did it, huh?

1593
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:02,886
- I'm sorry about what happened.
- Oh, no.

1594
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:04,763
No, really.
We underestimated you.

1595
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:08,850
Oh, please. Without you, come on.
Hey, we make a great team.

1596
01:34:09,018 --> 01:34:11,102
Hey, Doc, have you been
celebrating a little bit there?

1597
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:13,396
Oh, just a little.

1598
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:16,399
Come on, we'll crack
another bottle, okay?

1599
01:34:16,567 --> 01:34:19,986
I'll be right back.
First, I have to circumcise your son.

1600
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:22,614
Okay.
Huh?

1601
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:25,116
- What? Dr. Kosevich!
- Shit!

1602
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:37,754
I'll go.

1603
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:48,932
