1
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,246
Bring him here.

2
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,349
In the time of our ancestors

3
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:30,222
the cycle of our people
lay in the hands
of the children.

4
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:34,226
A child's position
in the tribe was left
to the maker.

5
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:37,763
Children bearing marks
were brought before
the elders

6
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,233
there, they were
given titles...

7
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:44,269
...titles that would last
a lifetime.

8
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,875
Wisdom...

9
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,713
Courage...

10
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,551
Vision.

11
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,459
This boy holds
the holy marks

12
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,295
of our ancestors.

13
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,866
He is a leader.

14
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,504
He is a prophet.

15
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:21,707
We should listen to him.

16
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,777
We should listen to him.

17
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,346
I see you!

18
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,664
Nat?

19
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,634
Nat!

20
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,537
All right, you win again.

21
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,439
Come on out!

22
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:41,320
Sam? You come on
in here for supper!

23
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,988
Yessum.

24
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,590
Bye, nat.

25
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:45,924
Bye.

26
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,703
You so much
as bat an eye,

27
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,439
I'm gonna blow you
from here to hell.

28
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,507
What you doin'
out here, boy?

29
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,976
Pickin' up some food
for my master,

30
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,611
Benjamin Turner.

31
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,448
In the middle of the night?
Turn around.

32
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,521
Where your pass at?

33
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,992
Bring it on.
C'mon! Bring it!

34
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,663
Get back.

35
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,700
You think you're smarter
than me, don't you, boy?

36
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,936
No, sir.

37
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,437
Jesse, who do
we call a nigger

38
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,940
who done think
he can outsmart
a white man?

39
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,775
A dead nigger.

40
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,577
Turn around.

41
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,515
On your knees.

42
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,788
You done this
to yourself, boy.

43
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,409
- What happened?
- Go on to bed.

44
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,144
I got caught stealing food.

45
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:56,815
I killed a slave catcher.
I gotta go.

46
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,584
You take care of your mom
and Nana, you hear?

47
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,886
You a child of god.

48
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,822
You got purpose.
It's in you.

49
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,690
The lord put it there,

50
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,627
and there ain't nothing nobody
can do to take it away.

51
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,861
You hear?

52
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,163
Yes, sir.

53
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,699
Now you go ahead on
and go to bed.

54
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,669
I'll be back for y'all
as soon as I can.

55
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,781
Go on back to bed.
Go on to bed, girl! We sleep!

56
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:51,203
Bridget! Nancy!
Y'all wake up!

57
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:52,737
Isaac's in
a lot of trouble.

58
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:56,208
I need one of y'all
to tell me where he is.

59
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,077
Don't know where he is, massa.
We ain't seen him all night.

60
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,145
You sure?

61
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,215
Ben, I'm gonna
ask you to leave.

62
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:03,215
Huh?

63
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:06,918
A white man
has lost his life tonight.

64
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,621
You know like I do
what that mean. Get!

65
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,556
Now, any harm done
to these people,

66
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,225
I'm gonna call the sheriff!
I'm serious!

67
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,233
None of y'all know
where he is, huh?

68
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,502
No, sir.

69
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,273
Goddamnit.

70
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,512
What about you, boy?

71
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,713
He don't know nothing, either.

72
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,128
Where's your daddy at?

73
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:57,102
Now listen, you don't tell me
where he's at,

74
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,837
someone else
is gonna find him,

75
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,973
and they gonna kill him.

76
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:06,545
You tell me, I'll go get him.
I'll bring him back here safe.

77
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,612
All right?

78
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,617
Tell me where daddy's at.

79
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:18,056
Say it. Spit something
outta that mouth! Say it!

80
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,092
Tell me where he's at!

81
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,164
Goddamnit.

82
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,002
You that nigger's boy,
all right.

83
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,905
If I find out
y'all's been lying,

84
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,576
I'm gonna come back here,
i ain't gonna be so nice...

85
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,579
Oh, massa, please! Please!
Massa, please! Oh, lord!

86
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,314
All right, that's...
That's enough! Stop!

87
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,318
You best teach that boy
some manners.

88
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,986
Next time he look me
in the eye,

89
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:51,222
you gonna get the same thing
what waitin' for his pa.

90
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,078
Mind if I help you?

91
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,880
No, ma'am.

92
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,749
Samuel told me
something this morning

93
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,217
I wanted to ask you about.

94
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:25,690
He said,
nat knows how to read.

95
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,192
Nat don't not know
how to read.

96
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:30,261
Part of me couldn't
believe it myself.

97
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,098
So I tested him.

98
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,701
Sure enough,

99
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,671
there he was
sounding out letters.

100
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,042
You have him come by the house
tomorrow after lunch.

101
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,910
He don't mean no harm.

102
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,046
I'ma whip him good
the next time I see him.

103
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:51,783
Whip him? Nonsense.

104
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,720
I'm gonna teach him.

105
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:59,224
If the good lord
gave that boy
a gift to read,

106
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,926
we'd be remiss
to let it go to waste.

107
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,730
And don't expect him back
anytime soon.

108
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,233
He'll be living with us
in the main house for a while.

109
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:12,070
Lessons best not be disturbed
in the beginning.

110
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,005
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,961
It's okay, baby.
It's okay. It ain't real.

112
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:40,965
It ain't real.
It's all right.
It's in your mind.

113
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,034
It's in your mind.

114
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,336
Momma's here now.

115
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,341
Want my poppa.

116
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,179
Me too, baby.

117
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,716
Me too.

118
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,853
Put your arms through.

119
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,358
How handsome.

120
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,075
He'll be all right.

121
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,408
These books are
for white folks.

122
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,980
They're full of things
your kind
wouldn't understand.

123
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:05,083
But I do have
a special one
just for you.

124
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,051
And guess what?

125
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:09,087
It's the best book
ever written.

126
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,530
You're a special boy,
Nathaniel.

127
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,435
Study hard and heed
my instructions, hear?

128
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,938
Your life,

129
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,574
it'll never be the same.

130
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,176
I'll see to that.

131
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,544
Yes, missus.

132
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,952
"Genesis.
In the beginning..."

133
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,121
In the beginning...

134
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,456
Here, this word here, "the."

135
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,860
That's tricky.
Now, these letters "t-h."

136
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,195
<i> Whenever you see them...</i>

137
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:53,298
"...cleanse your hands,
ye sinners...

138
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,302
"And purify your hearts,
ye double-minded.

139
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:01,239
"Be afflicted, and mourn,
and weep.

140
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:05,143
"Let your laughter
be turned to mourning,

141
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,847
"and your joy to heaviness."

142
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:13,518
James 4, chapter 8 and 9.

143
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,970
Turn with me,
if you would,
to James 1.

144
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:36,941
Holding on to the goodness
of the lord.

145
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:41,913
I spoke to Ben

146
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,649
before he went on
to be with the lord.

147
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:52,257
He felt you'd be more useful
to our family as a field hand.

148
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:01,199
I'm sorry, nat.

149
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,052
Now, you gonna start here,

150
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,388
and you're gonna work
your way down yonder.

151
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,423
And I'll be right over here.
You hear?

152
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,205
Ah!

153
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,191
Thank you, brother.

154
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:45,636
I had fainted, unless I had
believed to see,

155
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,139
the goodness of the lord

156
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:51,009
in the land of the living.

157
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,646
Wait on the lord,

158
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,448
be of good courage,

159
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,218
and he shall strengthen
thine heart.

160
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,323
Wait, I say,

161
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,392
on the lord.

162
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,397
Let us bow our heads.

163
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,339
Sam, that sister of yours,

164
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,674
gonna make
a fine wife indeed.

165
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,511
It's been a true blessing

166
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:30,681
seeing her develop
into the woman that she is.

167
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,183
It'd be
an even better blessing

168
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:32,183
seein' her and momma

169
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:36,587
put their feet
under his table
instead of mine.

170
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,535
I gotta say,

171
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:54,205
Sam, your slaves sure
do know how to behave.

172
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:57,075
I'm impressed with them
every time I come around.

173
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,377
Well, they god fearin'.
One of them's a preacher.

174
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,545
No one's gotta tell you

175
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,214
the times are tough
with the drought.

176
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,584
It's gettin' harder for
the whites in this county

177
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,387
to clothe and feed
their niggers good.

178
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,389
Talks of insurrection

179
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,624
got folks scared.

180
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,462
I think people might
pay good money

181
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,864
to have them
calm down a bit.

182
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,633
Especially by
one of their own.

183
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,612
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

184
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,250
You seen a nigger
run past here?

185
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,253
Naw. Then again
i doze off for a few.

186
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,521
What about you, boy?

187
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:47,592
Best not lie now.
I know when y'all's lyin'.

188
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,894
No, sir.

189
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,395
Couple of niggers
went missin'

190
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,763
off bill Johnson's place
this mornin'.

191
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,398
Say they raised up
on an overseer

192
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,334
before they took off.

193
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,670
All right,
you see somethin'
let us know.

194
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,205
Will do.

195
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,406
Giddyup.

196
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,783
You finish up here,
I'll go square up inside.

197
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,452
Yes, sir.

198
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:28,799
Ma'am. The youngin',
he dropped this a step back.

199
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,536
Thank ya.

200
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,775
Whatcha think
you're doin'?

201
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:41,612
He was just tryin'...
You spoke to my wife.

202
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,447
Where's your owner, boy?

203
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,884
I asked you a question.

204
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,659
You best goin' to put
that stick down now!

205
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:55,793
I want the sheriff.

206
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,728
This boy assaulted me!

207
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,363
He assaulted my wife!

208
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,531
And I'm bringin' charges!

209
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,632
Sheriff Floyd?

210
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,568
All right, you fetch him
if you like.

211
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,835
But in the meantime
i will give you

212
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,837
to the count of three
to put your stick down

213
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,206
before I give you
some real charges

214
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,440
to give him
when he gets here.

215
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,708
You threatnin' me?

216
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,943
One.

217
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,745
Two.

218
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,349
C'mon, get the boy.

219
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,251
Let's get home.

220
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,870
We got sweet corn!

221
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,339
C'mon now!
Get your grits!

222
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,707
We got sweet corn here.

223
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,909
Here you go.

224
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,744
And this one here!

225
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,546
Strong as an ox!

226
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,815
Nothin' but
good seed flowin'
from this here buck.

227
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,583
Look at them teeth. Huh?

228
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,552
I'll start him out at...

229
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,454
200.

230
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,556
150?

231
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,891
C'mon now, I gotta
make a living here, gents.

232
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:04,028
100? 75?

233
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,397
Sold! Get outta here.

234
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,799
Put a yoke on him.
Bring her up here.

235
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,972
Now, consider
this comely wench.

236
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,410
Not a day over 18.

237
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:22,413
All right, I'll start
her off at 175.

238
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:25,683
I got 175.
Do I hear two?

239
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:29,420
Now we're talkin'!
Do I got 225?

240
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:30,788
Massa, that wench there
sure would make

241
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,423
a good weddin' gift
for miss Catherine.

242
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,524
225!

243
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:34,825
You keep sayin'
she been askin'.

244
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:35,993
Do I hear 250?

245
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,795
She looks right young,
if you ask me.

246
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:37,795
C'mon now.

247
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,631
You right, sir,
she young.
Gimme 250.

248
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,067
C'mon.
But with
the right teacher,

249
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:45,603
- a wench like that?
- 250.

250
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:46,771
Could be workin'
a long time.

251
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:49,473
There it is! 275?

252
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,042
Massa, sure would
be a shame
to watch her

253
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,611
go to waste
for such a low price.

254
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:54,812
And what the hell
would you know about

255
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,615
what's a little
and what's a lot, huh?

256
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,684
I don't know what's
gotten into you lately,

257
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:01,352
but whatever it is,
you better quit.

258
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,621
Are you seein'
what I'm seein'?

259
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:07,458
You take this one home,
you know,

260
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,859
clean her up,

261
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:11,495
won't be long
before you find yourself

262
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,664
happier than a dog
with three balls!

263
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,467
Smile, bitch.

264
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,370
That's 250 goin' once.

265
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,607
250 goin' twice.

266
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,843
275.

267
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,612
We got 275!

268
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:31,082
275 goin' once.

269
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:35,619
275 goin' twice.

270
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:39,724
Sold to that fine gentleman
in the back!

271
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,896
Whoa.

272
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,001
She be fine, sir.

273
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,070
I sure hope you're right.

274
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,006
Have your momma
get her cleaned and fed.

275
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,074
Start breakin' her in.

276
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:57,074
Yes, sir.

277
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,877
You and hark can start
on the north fence

278
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,413
first thing in the morning.
Yes, sir.

279
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,787
I ain't gonna hurt you.

280
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,423
Just gonna climb up
and help you out.

281
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,929
It's all right.

282
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,089
Who is this child?
What happened?

283
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,891
Burnin' up.

284
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:50,628
This mine! This my dress!
My dress! This my dress!

285
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,829
Go now! Get out, ya!

286
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:56,000
We're not gonna hurt you.
We're not gonna hurt you.

287
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:57,168
Don't take it away.

288
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,736
You just smile

289
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,605
and let them
do the talkin'.
All right?

290
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,474
Yessum.

291
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:47,218
Afternoon, massa.
This here cherry-Ann.

292
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,586
Massa.

293
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,821
Catherine!

294
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,593
Catherine, this here
is cherry-Ann.

295
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:56,760
Missus.

296
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,532
Oh, thank you!

297
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,836
Come on,
i want you to meet momma.

298
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,842
Momma.

299
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,245
Thank you.

300
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:16,614
For what?

301
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:20,818
For gettin' her better.
For makin' her so beautiful.

302
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,120
I didn't do nothin'.

303
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:24,989
That girl was
brought into this world

304
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:27,024
as beautiful
as she could be.

305
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,970
It sure is sad to see you
and the missus go.

306
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,672
We'll be just down the road.

307
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:42,873
When we get
all good and settled,

308
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,141
we'll come back and visit.

309
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,277
On Sundays for church
and that.

310
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:48,012
Well, there's no rush.

311
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:50,648
Oh.
I'm foolin'. Come here.

312
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:50,648
If y'all need anything,

313
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:55,152
or he ain't treatin'
you right, you let me know.

314
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,087
Yes, big brother.
I love you.

315
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,956
Love you, too.

316
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,724
Momma, you ready?

317
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,798
I'm worried about you, Sam.

318
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,668
This a big place to be
out here all by yourself.

319
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,736
I'll be fine.

320
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,677
You take care now.

321
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,579
All right.
Hmm.

322
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,921
Massa.
For the horses.

323
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,257
Just one.

324
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,758
Yes, sir.

325
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,366
Hi.

326
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,768
Hi.

327
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,973
I'm nat.

328
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,341
I know.

329
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,111
Sorry for

330
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,847
fightin' you.

331
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,083
Oh, that's fine.

332
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:02,853
Um...

333
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,064
They're pretty.

334
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:17,167
Found them 'round here.

335
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,136
Thank you.

336
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,148
Bye.

337
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,979
Just as the planted crop

338
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,848
is harvested
in its own time,

339
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,918
so too has the lord
planted us.

340
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,194
Good lord.

341
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,998
The good lord,
the good lord

342
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,736
will finish his work in us.

343
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:08,178
So, in closing,
i urge you all
to take heart,

344
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,047
for god is at work
in your life,

345
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,916
and he will not stop until
his job is done. Amen?

346
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,384
Amen.
Dismissed!

347
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,259
It seems like
it's been forever

348
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,195
since I last seen you.

349
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:28,365
There were a few miles
between us.

350
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:31,101
Just feels like so many more.

351
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,038
How is it there?

352
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,977
It's fine. Not like
what I come from 'fore here.

353
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:43,180
Most days I'm just tending
to miss Elizabeth

354
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:45,949
or fetching this-that
for miss Catherine.

355
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,389
You know if y'all coming back
next week for church?

356
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,324
I know as much as you.

357
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,527
I suppose if missus
is suggesting it,

358
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:59,129
master Reese
don't mind the trip.

359
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:04,168
I sure wouldn't wanna
wait another season
to see ya.

360
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,137
Me, neither.

361
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,921
My Nana got it
from my grandaddy.

362
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:28,258
She brought it with her
when she was taken
from Africa.

363
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,395
Said it was the only thing
that kept her mind free.

364
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,865
It's pretty.

365
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,471
I want you to have it.

366
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:49,279
In case I don't see you
for a while, you

367
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:52,015
have something
that reminds you of me.

368
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,623
I don't know
if it's right I take it.

369
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,392
'Sides, I don't have
nothing to give you

370
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,361
to remind you of me.

371
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:09,867
I spend all my time
thinkin' about you already.

372
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,904
Cherry?

373
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:15,606
Come help with momma.
It's time to go.

374
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,181
Who there?

375
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,191
Nat?

376
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,531
What are you doin'?

377
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,209
I shoulda
done that earlier.

378
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,313
You came here to kiss me?

379
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,689
No, no, no.

380
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,028
I ain't got much.

381
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,165
My faith, momma, Nana.

382
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,235
Up until now, enough.

383
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,507
Cherry, I'd feel right honored
if you'd be my wife.

384
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:35,345
I'd treat ya right.
Protect ya with my life.

385
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,247
If you'd have me.

386
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,486
Yes. Yes, I will.

387
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,269
What now?

388
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,537
Uh...

389
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,040
I talk it over
with Samuel.

390
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,742
Get us a cabin set up
when y'all visit.

391
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,612
All right.

392
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,800
<i> Heavenly father.</i>
<i> We are gathered here today</i>

393
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:31,701
to join together
these two children,

394
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:35,439
who have found the love
that exists in you.

395
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:39,076
The love that surrounds
all of us all the time.

396
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:42,579
We bless these children
together with our hands

397
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,782
that the love that flows
through our hands...

398
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,743
Well, hello,
reverend.

399
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,479
I wasn't expecting
to see you around

400
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:16,746
these parts 'till Sunday.

401
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:18,615
What brings you around
the middle of the week?

402
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,617
Never a wrong time...

403
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,186
...to bring a blessing
to a brother in Christ.

404
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,387
Oh lord.

405
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,289
Is this blessing
gonna cost me money?

406
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:30,293
Not a penny.
To the contrary, in fact.

407
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,562
Isaiah, run us out a water.

408
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:35,398
Gin, if you please.

409
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,268
So, I put the word out
about your preacher.

410
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:44,741
Got a couple of farmers
willing to turn a good coin.

411
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,610
Is that right?
Mmm-hmm.

412
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:49,846
Every bit counts
these days.

413
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,314
Oh.

414
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,623
Ah!

415
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,392
Mmm.

416
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,528
If your boy
does to their liking,

417
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,163
you could
get outta debt.

418
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,231
Save your farm.

419
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,903
And all I gotta do
is let nat preach.

420
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:15,172
That's it.

421
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:19,176
Now, I'm not vouching
for the character
of these fellas.

422
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:22,345
What business
they runnin' or how.

423
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,413
I'm just here
to tell you

424
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:25,248
that there's
an opportunity there.

425
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,185
One you got the means
to capitalize on.

426
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:29,953
Whereabouts we talkin'?

427
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:31,888
In southampton, at the start.

428
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,424
Well, sounds good enough.

429
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,825
I'll send you the details.

430
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:40,297
Names, locations, and dates,
I'd say by tomorrow.

431
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:41,932
You already
booked the dates.

432
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:43,700
I figured you'd say yes.

433
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,536
What's in it for you?

434
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:50,840
The pure joy of knowing
that I'm helping a brother.

435
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,243
And, uh...
Oh, here it comes.

436
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:56,947
Well, if I was to receive
a gift offering,

437
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,217
I certainly wouldn't object.

438
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,785
You are caution, reverend.

439
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:05,622
I am but a servant.

440
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,266
Here's some salt pork
and some tomatoes

441
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:17,567
for when you get hungry.

442
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,636
Thank you, momma.

443
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,406
Don't y'all go
getting' worried now.

444
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,941
I'll be back directly.

445
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,743
I know.

446
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:30,313
Pray the lord
brings you back safe.

447
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,921
You massa Turner's nigger?

448
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,690
I'm nat.

449
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,693
Massa Turner's in here.

450
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,466
Come on.

451
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,409
- We're here?
- Yes, sir.

452
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,882
Sam Turner.

453
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:41,785
Made it right on time.
Joseph Randall.

454
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,088
This here's abner.

455
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,490
This little one? Jasper.

456
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,659
This the preacher?
Yes, sir.

457
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,328
Nat?

458
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,330
Evening, sir.

459
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:54,831
He's a little young,
ain't he?

460
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,499
Why, he's old enough.

461
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,068
You've been studying
the word awhile,
haven't you?

462
00:38:59,971 --> 00:38:59,969
Studyin'?

463
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:04,974
I can barely train my niggers
to learn their own names.

464
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,876
Come on!

465
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:13,983
<i> It's hard times</i>

466
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:17,487
<i> for small farmers</i>
<i> like you and myself.</i>

467
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:18,621
Breakin' even's hard enough,

468
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:20,523
but getting ahead's
impossible.

469
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:20,523
So to save some,

470
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:24,094
I cut them back to a meal
a day per head now.

471
00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:26,129
A few of them
started getting' fidgety,

472
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,797
so I had abner
come down on 'em.

473
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:31,768
Abner, here,
he's my only
real protection.

474
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,671
Now, they needs to mind me.
You speak on that.

475
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:37,707
They treasure in heaven
from submittin' and all.

476
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,910
If they gets to moanin'
or carryin' on,

477
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,545
you don't pay 'em no mind,

478
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,013
because they lazy as all hell.

479
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,716
They do anything
to get outta work.

480
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,451
You ready, boy?

481
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,735
Listen up!
Got a preacher here tonight.

482
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,804
Come here, boy.

483
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,075
Now, he's a nigger here
like y'all,

484
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,744
and he's here to talk to you
about the lord.

485
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,479
So you listen to him

486
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:20,984
and you might just make it
into heaven, you hear?

487
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,851
Brothers and sisters.

488
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:04,894
I lead you to Peter 2:18.

489
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:11,634
"Slaves,
submit yourselves

490
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:15,972
"to your masters
with all respect."

491
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:19,876
"Not only to those who are
good and considerate,

492
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:26,182
"but also to those
who are harsh."

493
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,826
You sure you don't wanna
stay the night?

494
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,495
Got some fine Brandy

495
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:41,164

wenches in the cellar.

496
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,501
Get abner here
to strike out the fiddle

497
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:48,004
and sit around the fire,
tell some old lies, huh?

498
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,507
No. We best be gettin' back

499
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:53,676
All right.
Suit yourself.

500
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,111
Would take
a bottle of that Brandy,

501
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,513
if you could spare it.

502
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:59,682
Oh, sure thing. Abner?

503
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,551

00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:05,021

505
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,690
You sure
you don't wanna stay?

506
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,560
No,

507
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:12,228
All right.

00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:17,033
You's a smart man, Sam.

509
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,636
Man make a fortune
with that boy.

510
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,044
Great doin' business

00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,950

512
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,273
You all right?

513
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,977
Yeah.

514
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,218
The dress there.

515
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,821
That the one you
were wearing that day?

516
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,925
Yes.

517
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,294
Momma offered you
one of hers?

518
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,229
She did.

519
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,783
"Abigail hayne."

520
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,852
My momma.

521
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:49,325
"Madison hayne." Who was that?

522
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,861
That's me.

523
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,864
My momma,

524
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,968
she put this dress on me

525
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:02,271
the day they took me from her.

526
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:05,975

527
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:09,979

00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,815
and that I had a momma.

529
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:16,152
And that she was somewhere,

530
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:20,223
missing me and loving me.

531
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,160
I was 13.

532
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,003
I can call ya Madison,
if ya like.

533
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:37,173
You can call me
whatever you want.

534
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,275
I'll call you queen.

535
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,082
What's wrong?

536
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,020
We're gonna have a baby.

537
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,391
A baby?

538
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,097

00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,142
Mad?

541
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,445
No. No.

542
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,115
I ain't mad.

543
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,335
"...as the eyes
of the servants

544
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:41,904

562
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:44,894

Let's go find Earl.

565
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,038
You all right? Come on.

566
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,541
Niggers is niggers here.

567
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:01,944
Now, we don't treat none
no different than another.

568
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,247
We got rules.

569
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:06,582
Cost of breakin' 'em,
stealin', sassin',

00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:08,517
or any other thing

worth dealin' with,
will be paid for in skin.

572
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:14,257
You interfere with that,

573
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:16,592
we'll shoot you
where you stand.

574
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:16,592
Got any problem with that,

575
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:21,230
you can stop right now
and go on back
where you came from.

576
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:28,271
Come on now! Come on!

577
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,173
Earl!

578
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:33,142
This here is Sam Turner,

579
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,944
fella with
the nigger preacher.

580
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,150
Where you say you come from?

581
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:43,452
We from here.
Southampton county.

582
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:44,687
Just south of nottoway.

583
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:46,088
Mmm.

584
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,057
Lotta Yankees
makin' their way
down that way.

585
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:51,193
Rabble-rousin', stirring shit
on our way of life.

586
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:54,063
They're pullin'
that same shit.

587
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:56,632
Earl. Got a little problem.

588
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,485
Which one?
This one.

589
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:18,187
How long?

590
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:21,057
Mmm. About a day or so.

591
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:27,163
You ain't gonna eat, hmm?

592
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,668
You gonna eat? Come on.
You ain't gonna eat?

593
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,204
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

594
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:37,640
All right.

595
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:40,409
If it ain't one thing,
it's another.

596
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:04,166
You wonderin' why we could
use that nigger of yours?

597
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,669
You're seein' it firsthand.
All right, get his mouth open.

598
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,172
Well, if it ain't
the yanks...

599
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:13,275
...it's the drought.

600
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:15,277
If not the drought...

601
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,248
...it's goddamn mutiny.

602
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,254
Get a funnel in there.

603
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,741
Truth is,
even the meanest nigger's

604
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:48,411
fearful of the gospel.

605
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:51,414
Maybe a good word
from your boy there,

606
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:54,817
discipline word,
go a lot further
than my pistol would.

607
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,720
Nat's a good preacher.

608
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:01,057
I don't right care
how good he is,

609
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:03,659
long as he say
what he's supposed to.

610
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,688
Brethren.

611
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:39,528
I pray you sing to the lord

612
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,299
a new song.

613
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:52,641
Sing praise in assembly
of the righteous.

614
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:56,679
Let the saints be joyful
in glory.

615
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:59,648
Let them sing aloud
on their beds.

616
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,749
Let the high praise of god

617
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,284
be on the mouths
of the saints,

618
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,120
and a two-edge sword
in their hand

619
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:06,622
to execute vengeance
on the demonic nations,

620
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,290
and punishment
on those peoples

621
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,226
to bind their kings
with chains

622
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:12,495
and their nobles
with fetters of iron

623
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:14,663
to execute on them
this written judgment.

624
00:52:14,665 --> 00:52:16,665
This honor hath
all his saints!

625
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:17,900
Praise the lord!

626
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:22,805
Praise the lord!
Sing to him a new song!

627
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:26,408
Praise the lord!
Praise the lord!

628
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,273
Don't suppose
you got a pass anywhere

629
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,408
underneath that pretty dress.

630
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:00,176
No, sir.

631
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:04,446
I belongs to massa guiles
and this here his property.

632
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:06,315
You sassin' me, girl?

633
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:08,184
No, sir.

634
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:10,419
Anybody that knows nothin'
knows that state law says

635
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:13,622
that if a nigger's less than
10 paces from a tree line,

636
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:14,790
that nigger need a pass.

637
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:19,728
Well, sir, I can get one.

638
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,464
You ain't goin' nowhere.

639
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:24,633
Either you gonna
show me a pass,

640
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:26,302
or you gonna show me
somethin' else.

641
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:32,875
What?

642
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,476
I'm sorry
to disturb ya,

643
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:36,579
but nat's gotta talk to you.

644
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:38,747
Somethin' awful had happened.

645
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:39,882
Whatever it is,
just tell him

646
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:41,750
I'll get to it in the mornin'.

647
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:44,653

648
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,255

00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,657

650
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:53,629
All right, tell him
I'll meet him
on the front porch.

651
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:56,599
I'm right here, sir.

652
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:58,334
Might as well come in then.

653
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:04,240
Sir, I am awfully sorry
about all this. I...

654
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:05,374
What is it, nat?

655
00:54:05,376 --> 00:54:08,677
Cherry... she's been
hurt real bad.

656
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,846
Whatcha mean hurt?

657
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,016
A group of men, sir.

658
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,990
Isaiah, fetch me some paper.
Yeah.

659
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:25,928
All right,
you should go down there.

660
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,797
Take Jupiter,
but don't start no trouble.

661
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:31,834
Stay the night, come back
first thing in the morning.

662
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:35,437
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

663
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,794
God's gonna punish
whoever did this.

664
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,730
Monsters.

665
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,860
Nat?

666
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,528
I'm right here.

667
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,430
I'm right here.

668
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:13,369
It's me now.

669
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:15,871
I'm right here.

670
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:20,743
I'm sorry.

671
00:56:20,745 --> 00:56:25,047
No, no. You don't apologize.

672
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,449
You don't owe that to nobody.

673
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:34,923
You need to tell me
who done this to you.

674
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,559
'Cause I'm gonna
take care of it, you hear?

675
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,828
On my soul.

676
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,001
I need you to tell me now.

677
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:17,032
"Put up again thy sword
into his place.

678
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:23,138
"For all they
that take the sword

679
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,508
"shall pass with the sword."

680
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,513
You taught me that.

681
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,687
I need you here.

682
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,058
Joanna, too.

683
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,697
Leave this to the lord.

684
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:06,248
You wanted
to see me, sir?

685
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,754
Yeah. How's cherry?

686
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:14,623
I'm believin'
she'll be fine.

687
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:16,592
Good. Good.

688
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,796
Not many woulda
let you go like I did.

689
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,631
Thank you, sir.

690
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:23,765
Mmm.

691
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:26,635
We're having
a big get-together tonight

692
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:28,670
with a lot of very
important people.

693
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:31,507
Kind of like
when daddy was alive.

694
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:31,507
So I'm gonna need you

695
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:33,775
and a couple of others
in the house.

696
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:35,244
Anyone who's had experience

697
00:58:35,246 --> 00:58:37,779
servin' and being
respectable help.

698
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:39,014
Yes, sir.

699
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:42,851
Can't tell ya how important
this is for all of us.

700
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:42,851
If we get this right,

701
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:46,221
the Turner name
will mean something again.

702
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,159
Isaiah.

703
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,596
Yes, sir.

704
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,982
As you all know,
this annual dinner

705
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:49,217
was a tradition
of our daddy many years ago.

706
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:52,287
And for all he believed,
he placed family, faith,

707
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:54,690
and tradition at the top
of his priority list.

708
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:56,058
Twenty years later,

709
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,961
those same priorities have
kept this property afloat.

710
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:01,129
That and the cash down
from your colored preacher.

711
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:04,199
Yeah!
That, too.

712
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:06,668
May god continue
to bless all of us

713
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,136
for many generations to come.

714
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,940
Hear, hear.

715
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,775
Nat, would you please
lead us in prayer?

716
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,310
Reverend, I trust
you wouldn't mind.

717
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:17,679
I guess not.

718
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,126
Heavenly father.

719
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:34,930
We come to thank you
for your word and your will.

720
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,067
We pray for and thank you

721
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:42,971
for your protection
and your promise.

722
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:45,340
And in our obedience,

723
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:49,277
you will be an enemy
to our enemies.

724
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,981
That you will oppose those
who oppose us.

725
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:59,821
Continue to guide us,
o lord,

726
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:02,991
and we will continue
to follow.

727
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,661
Through fine tribulation
we will push forward,

728
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:09,898
recognizing only you
as our source and strength.

729
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,836
In your holy name we pray.

730
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,838
Amen.

731
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,974
Bon appetit.

732
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:21,143
Daddy always said,

733
01:01:21,145 --> 01:01:23,845
"three black peppercorns
in a glass of port,

734
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:27,182
"and you got yourself
a excellent digestif."

735
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:29,351
Well, black is always tasty.

736
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:35,257
Especially a nice piece
of black meat. Sweet. Juicy.

737
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:37,259
I ain't doin' it, all right?

738
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:40,028
Naw, naw. I need you
to get out of here!

739
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:44,332
Ain't gonna happen, man.
You just come out here...

740
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:47,169
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ho, ho, ho!

741
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:49,204
What's goin' on, huh?

742
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:50,439
- I ain't doin' it.
- Huh?

743
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:52,374
- I ain't doin' it, nat.
- Doin' what?

744
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,209
He'd have to
lynch me first.

745
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,411
Lynch ya?
What are we talkin' about?

746
01:01:57,313 --> 01:02:00,782
One of Samuel's guests...

747
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:03,819
What?

748
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:10,025
One of Samuel's guests
requested Esther, and, uh...

749
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,434
Just go and talk to Samuel.
Just tell him what happened.

750
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:21,336
Tell him what it was
and he'll straighten this out.

751
01:02:21,338 --> 01:02:24,906
But Samuel sent me
over here personally, nat.

752
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:29,077
I can't do it, nat.
I won't.

753
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,846
Brother hark...

754
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:32,314
But, what...
Who are you?

755
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:33,915
Brother hark, do you think

756
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:37,185
that I wanna
come over here for this?

757
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:39,154
You here, ain't ya?

758
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,124
Nat!

759
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:44,192
Where is she?

760
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:48,230
Samuel, sir.
Please, you can't do this.

761
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:53,802
Everything all right?

762
01:02:53,804 --> 01:02:55,771
Oh, it's just fine.

763
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:57,372
I'll be inside directly.

764
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:59,107
I hope you won't be alone.

765
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:04,112
I assure you,
i will not be.

766
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,481
If you mess this up for me,
my hand to god,

767
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:08,784
I will lynch every
one of you come mornin!

768
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:10,418
Do you understand me?

769
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:13,421
Fetch her.

770
01:03:13,423 --> 01:03:14,523
Yes, sir.

771
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,549
It's okay.

772
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:33,101
Where is he, nat?
Where's god now?

773
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,614
Hark.

774
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,524
Excuse me.

775
01:04:56,526 --> 01:05:00,629
I'm looking for
a preacher named nat.

776
01:05:00,631 --> 01:05:02,030
He's been banned
from every church

777
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:02,030
in the county for his sins.

778
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:05,967
He's lucky
that's all he got
for what he done.

779
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:08,904
The world has its way
with dealing with the immoral.

780
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:11,306
Above all those
who cast that immorality

781
01:05:11,308 --> 01:05:14,075
on the children as he has.

782
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:17,913
But no one is without sin,
miss Elizabeth.

783
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:20,916
And this man wants to repent
and be delivered.

784
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:25,587
As a Shepherd of the lord,
it's my duty to serve.

785
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,222
So...

786
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:31,426
I'd like to baptize him.

787
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:32,494
The hell you will!

788
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:34,129
Jethro, you will
mind your mouth.

789
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:35,363
With respect,
miss Elizabeth,

790
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:39,134
a nigger can't baptize
no white man.

791
01:05:39,136 --> 01:05:41,970
I just think we should wait
for Mr. Samuel to get back.

792
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:41,970
Jethro, go wait
in the front yard.

793
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:45,073
Mr. Samuel gets back,
he'll have both of us!

794
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:47,342
I won't ask you again.

795
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,180
Boy, you gonna get it.

796
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:58,119
Are you sure
you want to do this, nat?

797
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,288
Samuel may not like it.

798
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:03,124
Nor will a lot
of other folks
around here.

799
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:06,594
Don't got
too much choice, missus.

800
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:09,965
This man still belongs to god.

801
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:13,134
When you stand between
the lord and his people,

802
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:15,670
it's a dangerous place to be.

803
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:19,367
We've been good to you.
My whole family has.

804
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,537
And you go on and do
something like this to me.

805
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:26,541
A nigger baptizing
a white man on my property!

806
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:28,376
Do you know
how this makes us look?

807
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:32,180
This could ruin everything
we worked for!

808
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:35,283
Boy, you better
say something and quick!

809
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,054
"Take heed therefore
unto yourselves,

810
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:40,288
"and to all the flock
over which

811

01:07:55,572 --> 01:08:00,408
"You were bought with a price,

01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,311
"He that shall blaspheme

825
01:08:10,654 --> 01:08:12,387
You black bastard!

"He that stealeth a man
and selleth him..."

01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:13,588
Don't you eyeball me, boy!

"...or if he be found

830
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,803
Get him to the post.

831
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,741
Hey, boy.

832
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:46,181
If you make it
out of this alive,

833
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:49,884
I'm gonna ride you harder
than hogs on slop.

834
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,890
Die.

835
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:14,562
You learned your lesson, boy?

836
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,901
Oh, yes, sir,
I've learned.

837
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:22,570
Go on, get him off.

838
01:12:27,544 --> 01:12:29,677
You're done preachin'
for a little while.

839
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,679
And I don't want you
runnin' off with any groups,

840
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,515
unless me and Jethro
are there, you understand?

841
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,951
Yes, sir.

842
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:39,020
All right,
go and get yourself
cleaned up.

843
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:41,756
Be back in the field
come morning.

844
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:59,774
Brother, you all right?

845
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:04,545
Hey! Hey!

846
01:13:18,828 --> 01:13:21,529
I watched your
grandfather die

847
01:13:21,531 --> 01:13:23,898
in old land.

848
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:29,137
Saw him give up the ghost
with my own eyes.

849
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:33,007
And he saw me.

850
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:35,810
He harnessed
the holy spirit that day.

851
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:38,679
Yes, he did.

852
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:39,947
I was proud of him.

853
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:44,619
So proud.

854
01:13:44,621 --> 01:13:46,187
I still thank god

855
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:51,692
that he died that day.

856
01:13:51,694 --> 01:13:55,029
That he didn't live
to see the things I seen.

857
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:02,770
To watch a strong man
broken down

858
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,941
is a terrible thing.

859
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,245
Hey, Nana.

860
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,820
The stitches held up good.

861
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:08,135
Nana?

862
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:12,199
You all right?

863
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:21,776
Mostly.

864
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:34,255
I need you to round up
a few men you trust.

865
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:35,923
Have them meet us
at the big cypress

866
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,593
at cabin pond
night after next.

867
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:43,631
Hark.

868
01:16:43,633 --> 01:16:46,233
He's still here, brother.

869
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:49,804
Even now.

870
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,891
This is Simon.

871
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:13,694
Samuel bought him
a month back in Norfolk.

872
01:17:13,696 --> 01:17:15,696
I remember.
Welcome, brother.

873
01:17:15,698 --> 01:17:17,198
And you know Nelson.

874
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,767
Welcome.

875
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:21,135
This is will.

876
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:25,306
Word travels fast. Welcome.

877
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:29,243
Hey! This grown folk's
business! Get! Get!

878
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:30,911
Hold on.

879
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:32,847
Come on over here.

880
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,221
Come from Randall's?
Yes, sir.

881
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,922
He's just a boy.

882
01:17:41,924 --> 01:17:43,290
So was David.

883
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:47,662
Come on. Have a seat.

884
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:01,942
I've been following
the lord a long time.

885
01:18:01,944 --> 01:18:05,813
Preachin', citing scripture,

886
01:18:05,815 --> 01:18:08,349
sharing the gospel
from the few pages

887
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:10,384
and sections
I've been allowed.

888
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:13,688
But I've gone back
through this word,
all of it.

889
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:15,823
With new eyes.

890
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:17,692
I see now, for every verse

891
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:19,226
they use to support
our bondage,

892
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:21,395
there's another
demanding our freedom.

893
01:18:21,397 --> 01:18:25,833
Every verse they use
to justify our torture,

894
01:18:25,835 --> 01:18:28,903
there's another damning them
to hell for those actions.

895
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:34,775
Lord has spoken to me.
Visions of what's to come.

896
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:37,311
A rise of good against evil.

897
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:41,048
The first shall be last,
and the last shall be first.

898
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:47,254
Brothers, we've been chosen.

899
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:49,190
What are we gonna do?

900
01:18:49,192 --> 01:18:51,158
Same as David and Gideon

901
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:55,496
and Joshua and Samson.

902
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:57,798
We'll fight.
The six of us?

903
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,900
At first.
But once it begins,

904
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:01,302
our brothers and sisters
will join.

905
01:19:01,304 --> 01:19:02,903
There's a whole lot
of whites.

906
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:04,739
How many slaves you think
there are in the county?

907
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:08,342
On all the plantations?
How many whites?

908
01:19:08,344 --> 01:19:09,810
But they got guns.

909
01:19:09,812 --> 01:19:11,178
We'll take the armory
in Jerusalem.

910
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,913
We'll have guns, too.

911
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,515
Jerusalem?

912
01:19:14,517 --> 01:19:17,151
That's right.
It's only 10 miles north.

913
01:19:17,153 --> 01:19:18,452
We'll start right here
at Turner's

914
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:20,020
and fight our way there.

915
01:19:20,022 --> 01:19:21,889
By then we'll number
in the hundreds,

916
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:23,824
thousands even.

917
01:19:23,826 --> 01:19:26,527
The grapevine's ablaze
with talks of fightin'.

918
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:29,096
Slaves all over
havin' meetins'.

919
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,031
They waitin' on something.

920
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:32,399
They waitin' on us.

921
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:37,438
We make a stop
at Fowler place?

922
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,273
We will.

923
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:43,077
I'm with you.

924
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:44,311
Me, too.

925
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:46,280
- When we fight?
- Soon.

926
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,549
The lord will
give us a sign.

927
01:19:48,551 --> 01:19:50,217
Until then
we remain steadfast,

928
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:53,053
ready to strike at the moment
of the lord's call.

929
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:54,955
With the strength
of our father,

930
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:56,423
we'll cut the head
from the serpent.

931
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:59,994
We'll destroy them all.

932
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:30,591
Somethin' wrong?

933
01:20:30,593 --> 01:20:34,962
There was a meeting
a few nights ago.

934
01:20:34,964 --> 01:20:37,598
And although I was not
privy to what was said,

935
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,100
I can only assume

936
01:20:40,102 --> 01:20:44,071
by the secrecy
that it was not
altogether productive.

937
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,524
<i> Now,</i>
<i> I don't know what ideas</i>

938
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:07,127
<i> is floatin' around</i>
<i> in your head,</i>

939
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:09,363
<i> but I been around here</i>
<i> long enough to know</i>

940
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:11,465
that the result
of certain ideas

941
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:13,634
is not gonna get you
what you want.

942
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:16,136
All I want,

943
01:21:16,138 --> 01:21:18,305
I want for the oppressed
people of god.

944
01:21:18,307 --> 01:21:20,908
You want death for them?

945
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:23,244
For your wife?

946
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,213
For your daughter?

947
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,481
If it be god's will.

948
01:21:27,483 --> 01:21:29,550
God's will?

949
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:32,987
And who determined you

950
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:34,955
to be the instrument
of such a thing?

951
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:36,657
He has.

952
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:44,331
You just make sure that
he's the one doin'
the orderin'.

953
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:49,336
Man of god is called
to lead in love.

954
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:52,573
Anything else
will leave us
all worse off.

955
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:56,176
He is a god of love, nat.

956
01:21:56,178 --> 01:21:58,679
Don't you forget that.

957
01:21:58,681 --> 01:22:00,681
I won't.

958
01:22:00,683 --> 01:22:03,951
Nor will I forget
he's a god of wrath.

959
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:17,531
Mmm...

960
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,280
The lord's calling me.

961
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:37,151
To stand and fight.

962
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:50,998
I knew this day would come.

963
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:57,137
I told myself
i wouldn't be scared.

964
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:01,241
All my life,

965
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:05,980
I've been praying
for the lord to help us

966
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:09,149
or to send
someone who could.

967
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:13,253
We all have.

968
01:23:13,255 --> 01:23:17,992
Just wasn't expecting it
to be my own husband.

969
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:33,273
If the lord's
called you to fight,

970
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,677
you fight.

971
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:40,347
You fight for me,

972
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:43,517
and Joanna.

973
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:50,190
You fight for us all.

974
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,759
Hmm?

975
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:03,430
Who's there?

976
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,204
Nat?

977
01:25:10,206 --> 01:25:11,772
Yes.

978
01:25:30,559 --> 01:25:32,626
Wait, goddamnit!

979
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:38,465
Damn it!

980
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:17,431
Momma?

981
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:22,769
Momma.

982
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:27,708
Nat? Oh lord,
i slept too late.

983
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,710
No, no...
Momma.

984
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,780
You won't have
to work today.

985
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:36,450
You free.

986
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:46,860
The battle's begun, ma.

987
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:49,796
Simon.

988
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:55,736
Simon will take you
to Reese's.

989
01:27:55,738 --> 01:27:57,638
And I need you to take care
of cherry and Joanna

990
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,606
'till I get back, you hear?

991
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:02,976
What's wrong?

992
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:05,746
Nothing.

993
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:09,616
I'm proud of you.

994
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:29,436
What did you do, boy? Huh?

995
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,571
Huh? You killed them, boy?

996
01:28:31,573 --> 01:28:33,674
Is that what you did?

997
01:28:33,676 --> 01:28:37,511
You kill them
and you kill us!

998
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:45,319
You killed all of us.

999
01:28:45,321 --> 01:28:48,522
We already dead.
We already dead!

1000
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,459
You dead.

1001
01:28:52,461 --> 01:28:54,795
We already dead.

1002
01:28:58,466 --> 01:29:01,034
We dead now!

1003
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:09,343
Your

1004
01:29:09,345 --> 01:29:12,346
earthly master is gone.

1005
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:17,484
You're now free
men and women,

1006
01:29:17,486 --> 01:29:19,052
servants of only the lord.

1007
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:24,358
As the sword of the lord
bears down on our enemies,

1008
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,960
our ancestors
and unborn children rejoice.

1009
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:30,564
Are we dead?

1010
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:37,504
No.
I say we are now alive,

1011
01:29:37,506 --> 01:29:39,473
seeing through eyes
that have been denied us

1012
01:29:39,475 --> 01:29:42,576
since being born
into the darkness
of bondage.

1013
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:45,112
Stand with us.

1014
01:29:45,114 --> 01:29:48,115
Let your other captive
brothers and sisters

1015
01:29:48,117 --> 01:29:49,516
also know freedom.

1016
01:29:49,518 --> 01:29:51,051
Stand that our children

1017
01:29:51,053 --> 01:29:52,652
for generations
to come will know

1018
01:29:52,654 --> 01:29:54,154
that with the supernatural
power of god,

1019
01:29:54,156 --> 01:29:55,522
we straightened our backs

1020
01:29:55,524 --> 01:29:57,724
against the works
of the evil one!

1021
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:01,928
Stand with us.

1022
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:57,784
Can I do this myself?

1023
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:58,712
The boy! He gone!

1024
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,589
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1025
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:30,610
Get down!

1026
01:32:33,014 --> 01:32:34,681
Hey, preacher!

1027
01:32:34,683 --> 01:32:36,182
Hark!

1028
01:32:36,184 --> 01:32:38,184
Are you out there?

1029
01:32:38,186 --> 01:32:39,819
Tell the men to fall back.

1030
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:41,555
What?

1031
01:32:41,557 --> 01:32:42,889
If we have a gun battle now,

1032
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:44,090
we'll never make it
to Jerusalem.

1033
01:32:44,092 --> 01:32:45,191
Me and my boys
is ready!

1034
01:32:45,193 --> 01:32:46,560
I want my revenge!

1035
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:47,794
This ain't
about revenge, hark!

1036
01:32:47,796 --> 01:32:50,897
You all gonna hang!
You hear me?

1037
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:52,766
All of ya!

1038
01:32:54,803 --> 01:32:57,037
The root,

1039
01:32:57,039 --> 01:32:58,238
not the branch.

1040
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:02,042
We must stay focused, brother.

1041
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:07,714
Will! Fall back! C'mon!
C'mon, y'all. C'mon.

1042
01:33:07,716 --> 01:33:09,849
Let's fall back, y'all!

1043
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:36,309
You all right?

1044
01:33:39,013 --> 01:33:41,147
It's all of us.

1045
01:33:41,149 --> 01:33:42,282
This it?

1046
01:34:01,902 --> 01:34:03,970
Hark, what time
you think it is?

1047
01:34:04,905 --> 01:34:08,041
5:30, 5:35.

1048
01:34:10,845 --> 01:34:11,144
What?

1049
01:34:15,783 --> 01:34:19,653
By now I'd be
two rows down,

1050
01:34:19,655 --> 01:34:21,187
half a bag full.

1051
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:24,124
I'd be headed to the barn,

1052
01:34:24,126 --> 01:34:26,126
gettin' ready
to feed the stock.

1053
01:34:26,128 --> 01:34:28,261
I'd be boiling
water in the smokehouse,

1054
01:34:28,263 --> 01:34:30,296
thinkin' 'bout dumping
on massa's head.

1055
01:34:31,867 --> 01:34:34,067
I'd be tying the barrels,
sealin' cracks.

1056
01:34:34,069 --> 01:34:36,202
Checkin' the leaves
and straw.

1057
01:34:36,204 --> 01:34:39,305
Packin' and stackin'
'em up.

1058
01:34:39,307 --> 01:34:42,375
Dodgin' that cracker's lash.

1059
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:46,946
Not today.

1060
01:34:46,948 --> 01:34:48,948
No, sir.

1061
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:51,284
Not today.

1062
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:57,957
On to Jerusalem?

1063
01:34:57,959 --> 01:34:59,359
On to Jerusalem.

1064
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:00,894
On to Jerusalem!

1065
01:35:24,285 --> 01:35:26,086
All right, this is how
this is gonna work.

1066
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:29,489
You're gonna throw
the weapons to the ground,

1067
01:35:29,491 --> 01:35:32,225
then you're gonna lie down.

1068
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:36,296
Do it.

1069
01:35:36,298 --> 01:35:41,468
The lord is our light
and our salvation.

1070
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:43,770
Of whom we shall fear?

1071
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:47,407
Throw your weapons
to the ground!

1072
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:50,744
The lord is the strength
of our lives.

1073
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:53,012
Of whom shall we be afraid?

1074
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:58,151
When the wicked,
even our enemies

1075
01:35:58,153 --> 01:35:59,519
and our foes came upon us

1076
01:35:59,521 --> 01:36:02,288
to eat up our flesh,
they stumbled and fell!

1077
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:03,857
Goddamn, niggers.

1078
01:36:03,859 --> 01:36:05,358
Though a host
shall encamp against us,

1079
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,293
our hearts will not fear!

1080
01:36:07,295 --> 01:36:08,394
Ready!

1081
01:36:08,396 --> 01:36:09,529
Though war
shall rise against us,

1082
01:36:09,531 --> 01:36:11,164
in this we will be confident!

1083
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:12,832
Aim!

1084
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:17,303
Rebel!

1085
01:37:43,258 --> 01:37:44,324
Come on!

1086
01:37:58,072 --> 01:38:00,306
Get down!

1087
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:37,377
Will!

1088
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:58,531
Get back!

1089
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:11,945
I'm all right.

1090
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:44,163
Cherry.

1091
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:51,537
It's nat, love.

1092
01:41:52,773 --> 01:41:54,841
Keep on workin'.

1093
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:02,849
They lookin' for you.

1094
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,554
They hurt you?

1095
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:11,557
No.

1096
01:42:12,893 --> 01:42:14,861
How's Joanna?

1097
01:42:16,363 --> 01:42:18,564
She fine.

1098
01:42:19,666 --> 01:42:21,334
Momma?

1099
01:42:21,336 --> 01:42:23,569
She fine, too.

1100
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:28,207
Keep on workin' now.

1101
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:31,477
Any word on
the other men?

1102
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:33,479
They been hanged.

1103
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:35,748
All of them.

1104
01:42:38,685 --> 01:42:40,520
They killin' people
everywhere

1105
01:42:40,522 --> 01:42:43,422
for no reason at all
but being black.

1106
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:50,163
They say the killin'
won't stop

1107
01:42:50,165 --> 01:42:52,598
'till they get you.

1108
01:43:00,174 --> 01:43:01,908
All these months

1109
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:06,612
I thought...

1110
01:43:11,552 --> 01:43:13,920
I thought you were dead, too.

1111
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:18,925
I'm here, love.

1112
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:21,928
I'll always be.

1113
01:43:27,968 --> 01:43:30,937
I miss you so much.

1114
01:43:37,411 --> 01:43:39,278
Cherry?

1115
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,948
Who you talkin' to?

1116
01:43:44,751 --> 01:43:47,653
I's just talkin' to myself.

1117
01:43:51,358 --> 01:43:53,826
Wishin' things
was different.

1118
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:39,705
Hey!

1119
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,347
That's him right there!

1120
01:44:48,349 --> 01:44:50,283
Kill that nigger!

1121
01:44:55,689 --> 01:44:58,891
I know you're angry.
Trust me, I am too.

1122
01:44:58,893 --> 01:45:03,429
This boy committed mass murder
and will hang for all to see.

1123
01:45:03,431 --> 01:45:05,031
Get him up.

1124
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:35,554
Go to hell!

1125
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:38,858
Animal!

1126
01:47:04,684 --> 01:47:06,419
Hang him!

1127
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:21,801
Is there something
you wanna say

1128
01:47:21,803 --> 01:47:23,702
to these good people?

1129
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:32,511
I'm ready.
