1
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:58,070
It's time for America's favorite game show:
Pig in a Poke!

2
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,410
Pig in a poke
It pays to be a glutton

3
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,210
Pig in a poke
Oink! Oink! Oink!

4
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,370
Pig in a poke
You could win all or nothing

5
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,880
"Pig in a poke
Oink! Oink! "

6
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,090
So, let's meet our current champions:
The Griswalds.

7
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,390
Here's the star of our show,
Kent Winkdale.

8
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,060
Clark, it's time for your big decision.

9
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,940
Will you keep what's in the poke,
or risk everything...

10
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,270
...and go for the big prize?

11
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,740
Johnny, remind the folks
what they've already won.

12
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,110
The super-charged Honda 750 motorcycle!

13
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,700
A dream kitchen with brand new
major appliances! And for Clark...

14
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,660
...the king of the family...

15
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,750
...a ten-year supply of Regal Car Polish...

16
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,500
...the car wax of royalty!

17
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,630
First, Clark, remind our audience
who you are and what you do.

18
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,970
I'm Clark W. Griswald.
I'm in food additives, not preservatives.

19
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,760
Not preservatives!

20
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,810
What about the family?

21
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,020
This is my wife, Ellen, my son,
Rusty, and daughter, Audrey.

22
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,150
Hello, Ellen.

23
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,610
Hi, Rusty.

24
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,110
Audrey.

25
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,340
You've won some fantastic prizes.

26
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,840
Do you want to keep them...

27
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,640
...or risk everything, and be a pig?

28
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,310
Be a pig!

29
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,190
Let's keep what we have.
I love the Signore Cappuccino.

30
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,730
Don't do it.
Nobody ever wins the grand prize.

31
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,690
We've decided.

32
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,150
Oink, oink. We'll be pigs.

33
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,030
So long, motorcycle.

34
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,660
You're very brave. I wish you luck.

35
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,830
Now, a fantastic surprise.
Back, by popular demand...

36
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,250
...the all-time winningest family
in the history of Pig in a Poke:

37
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,880
The Froegers.

38
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,850
The Froegers?
No one's ever beaten the Froegers.

39
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,180
Mr. Froeger, tell us about yourselves.

40
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,690
I won my Nobel Prize in 1967.

41
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,400
My wife won hers in 1970.

42
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,730
Our son, Moe, has just been elected
to the board of Microtech...

43
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,190
...a computer software corporation.

44
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:48,780
Our daughter, Ruth, is the youngest female
ever to be accepted at Harvard Law School.

45
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,040
Good luck to all of you.
Now, let's take a look at our categories.

46
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,250
Pharmacology.

47
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,130
American Explorers.
Chronology of the Pharaohs.

48
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,260
The Geography of the Brain...

49
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,590
...and History of
Early Hungarian Cabinet Making.

50
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,260
Not bad.

51
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,770
Froegers, since you're the challengers,
you get to pick the first category.

52
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,390
The Hungarian one.
Nobody knows anything about Hungarians.

53
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,730
I don't know. Kent, we'd like
The Geography of the Brain.

54
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,730
The question is:

55
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,650
What are the pyramidal tracts?

56
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,700
Five seconds.

57
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,790
The pyramidal tracts are
a housing development outside of Cairo.

58
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,380
Too bad.

59
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,090
You're the champions
if you answer correctly.

60
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,890
The pyramidal tracts...

61
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,640
...are a complex of multi-synaptic
lower motor neurons...

62
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,440
...which interconnect the basal ganglia
with the reticular formation.

63
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,520
You said, "Lower motor neurons."
The answer is: Upper motor neurons.

64
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,650
- Upper! Upper!
- Nobody wins.

65
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,450
- We're still in it.
- Froegers, select another category.

66
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,040
- Early Hungarian Cabinet Making.
- American Explorers.

67
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,500
American Explorers. Griswalds.

68
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,790
In 1804, an expedition explored an area...

69
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,090
...from the Louisiana territory
to the Pacific Coast.

70
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,300
For the grand prize,
what lieutenant led that expedition?

71
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,390
- I give up.
- Wait a minute, Dad.

72
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,930
Quiet down! I think I got this one.

73
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,940
Come on, Dad.

74
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,190
Time's up. Do you have an answer?

75
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,400
- Clark!
- That's it!

76
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,990
Clark, of Lewis and Clark.

77
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,370
The Griswalds are our grand prize winners!

78
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,040
No, that was a mistake!
She doesn't know that.

79
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,380
Come on out here!

80
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,480
The Griswalds have just won
a fabulous European vacation!

81
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,490
We'll fly the whole family
to London, England...

82
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,950
...to start a two-week vacation
extravaganza you'll never forget.

83
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,370
"On to Germany, where you'll enjoy
a fine meal at Dieter's...

84
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,460
"...and dance to the gay music
of Esther and the Black Forest Girls."

85
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,340
- This is going to be some vacation, kids.
- Yeah, Dad.

86
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,380
Rusty, give me a hand and set the table.

87
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,890
Why can't Audrey do it?

88
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,050
Because Audrey has company.

89
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,020
- Rusty, come on!
- Wait a minute.

90
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,230
Russ, obey your mother.

91
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,230
I can't stand the thought of being
away from you for whole two weeks.

92
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,240
It'll be like before we met.

93
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,780
Before we met, my life was horrible
and meaningless. Wasn't yours?

94
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,200
Sort of.

95
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's light it up!

96
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,260
Audrey, please eat something.

97
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,930
Everybody, listen up.

98
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,930
Let's look at the map
and go over our schedule.

99
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,640
The plane will fly us
from Chicago to London.

100
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,310
That's Madrid, Dad.

101
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,110
You're right. This must be
one of those old medieval maps.

102
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,030
Dad, I made a decision.

103
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,820
I can't leave Jack.
Besides, the food in Europe is fattening.

104
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,200
And I like her thin. She eats too much.

105
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,830
Clark, why don't you and I go alone?
It's obvious the kids don't even want to go.

106
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,500
Of course they do.

107
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,250
We're a family.
We're going to Europe as a family.

108
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,590
- Don't we have a say in this?
- I think we should vote on it.

109
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,010
I can be big about this.
We'll be a democracy. Everybody votes.

110
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,180
Who will be president?

111
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,470
Let's vote on that.
We'll have a secret ballot.

112
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,770
Write down your choice...

113
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,350
...give it to your mother.

114
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,650
This will be for the President
of the Republic of Griswald.

115
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,990
All right, that's one for Clark.

116
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,500
One for Rusty.

117
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,500
One for Jack.

118
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,710
One for Clark.

119
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,380
That's two for Clark.

120
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,840
As President of the Griswald Republic,
I move we go to Europe.

121
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,850
Jack, you wait here.

122
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,730
What are you doing?

123
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,900
A little memento before we go away,
I just got the kids.

124
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,450
I don't want anyone to see me like this.

125
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,870
No one will see you.

126
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,200
Remember that song you did
in college in that musical?

127
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,830
No, I'm not going to do that. I won't do it.

128
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,540
I'm going to erase this.

129
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,300
Okay. Go over there.

130
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,680
I'm ready. Wait a minute. Okay.

131
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,950
Don't stop.

132
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,160
Sexy. I love you.

133
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,100
The Pig in a Poke itinerary is just great.

134
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,810
It's down to the exact minute.
We won't miss a thing.

135
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,190
Why don't we forget the itinerary
and play it by ear?

136
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,150
Like normal people.

137
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,320
We're not normal people.
We're the Griswalds.

138
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,540
I saved the big surprise for last.

139
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,370
We're turning around?

140
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,540
No, we're visiting my relatives in Germany.

141
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,500
Not if we don't vote for it.

142
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,220
- You'll vote for it.
- Why should I?

143
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,050
Because I raised your allowance.

144
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,010
I think I'm going to like
this democracy stuff.

145
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,810
Something to drink?

146
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,020
- No, thank you.
- I'll have a Coke.

147
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,520
Do you want that in the can?

148
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,860
No, I'll have it right here.

149
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,740
Push "French."

150
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,330
- Give me a French word.
- Soufflé.

151
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,250
Soufflé. All right. Push "English."

152
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,420
Instant translation. Soufflé means...

153
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,220
..."Soufflé."
It's got to mean something else.

154
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,890
The Lord and Lady Poncenby Smythe.

155
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,560
The Lady Amelia Spicer
and the Baron von Richtshofen.

156
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,280
Mr. And Mrs. Clark and Ellen Griswald.

157
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,280
He came.

158
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,410
Wonderful.

159
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,540
Hey, Chuck.

160
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,630
Di.

161
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,550
This is my wife, Ellen.

162
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,720
Di. How are you?

163
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,640
I do hope we could have the first dance.

164
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,810
There you go again, Di. Listen, you know
the only princess in my life is my wife.

165
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,270
She gets the first dance.

166
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,150
- Clark, wait.
- Sorry.

167
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,350
There's Rusty!

168
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,400
"The hills are alive

169
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,990
"With the sound of Griswald

170
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,460
"This should spin around
for a very long time

171
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,670
"I'm feeling so high

172
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,630
"That I just can't stand it

173
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,550
"It's as though I've been here

174
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,640
"For at least a week"

175
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,980
The Royal lmperial Windsor Hotel.

176
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,870
Want me to give you a hand with that?

177
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,120
If you could just get that stuff in...

178
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,210
Carry that. I'll get the luggage out.
Rusty, we could use your help.

179
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,010
I can get these bags.

180
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,680
Sure I can't help?

181
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,520
Ellen, do you have any money?

182
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,190
- Would you pay?
- No problem.

183
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,900
Camembert cheese is also produced
on a large scale...

184
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,820
...molded by the thousands
in giant factories.

185
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,070
Hello!

186
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,840
Top of the evening. I'm Clark Griswald
from the United States of America.

187
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,710
I believe we have reservations for four.

188
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,890
No, you're scuppered, mate.
The place is full of macaroons.

189
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,270
I could get on the dog and
blow to my mate in Whitechapel.

190
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,900
Dad, he's speaking English.

191
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,190
I know.

192
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,440
This is from the Pig in a Poke show.

193
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,780
They said there'd be rooms for four
and a rental car waiting for us.

194
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,910
We're the grand prize winners.

195
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,280
Oink, oink! We'll be pigs!

196
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,660
Oh, the Yanks. Follow me.

197
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,250
Is there anybody to help with the luggage?

198
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,000
Mum!

199
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,300
Kids, help me out. No, please sit.

200
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,100
This is ridiculous.

201
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,520
"Sixty-five rooms tastefully decorated,
with private bathroom and shower...

202
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,770

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,820

"...combines old-world charm
and modem convenience."

205
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,530
Clark, does this look like
the room in the brochure?

206
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,950
No, I think they shot this picture
from another angle.

207
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,500
It's quaint. I like it.

208
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,580
It'll look better after I've had a hot bath.

209
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,130
Well, the bed is nice and soft.

210
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,300
- There's no bathroom.
- Of course, there's a bathroom.

211
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,680
Europeans go to the bathroom, don't they?

212
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,520
Maybe they don't.

213
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,160
Call the front desk.
Something's wrong with this thing.

214
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,820
We've only got four channels, and no MTV.

215
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,990
That's all there are.

216
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,840
Just think of it. Shopping on Bond Street.

217
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,260
Bobbies. Fish and chips. Big Ben.

218
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:07,010
Shopping on Carnaby Street.
It's going to be so romantic.

219
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,380
I have to warn you,
I'm feeling very naughty tonight.

220
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,430
Congratulations.

221
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,560
What can I do for you?

222
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,110
I want a wake-up call for 7 a.m., please.
Good night.

223
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,790
You're in bed, already.

224
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,790
I left a wake-up call
to get an early start in the morning.

225
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,430
I love you.

226
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,760
I've been waiting for this.
I can't believe we're alone at last.

227
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,600
Just you and me.

228
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,150
I'm so horny.

229
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,780
And these bubbles...

230
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,450
...make me feel so...

231
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,280
I feel like...

232
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,200
You know.

233
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,790
When did you stop shaving your legs?

234
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,800
Why don't you just jump in here with me?

235
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,270
I think I made a mistake.
Is my wife in here?

236
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,320
No.

237
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,360
I get confused with the numerous doors.

238
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
- I guess this happens a lot.
- No.

239
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,830
- Could you unlock your legs from my leg?
- No.

240
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,500
My right leg is asleep.

241
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,160
Oh, no. Please don't.

242
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,330
It's very hot in here.

243
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,000
It's hot, yeah.

244
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,510
I got a mild case of herpes.
I'll just get out.

245
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,180
Let me just check. I've got a wake-up call.

246
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,350
- You won't believe this. I was in the tub.
- I've been looking for our room.

247
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,190
- This guy came in with a toothpaste tube.
- I went into this lady's room.

248
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
- I don't know where our room is.
- It's right here.

249
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,860
They don't even put numbers on the doors.

250
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,870
Here's our English transportation.
Now we'll have some fun.

251
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,160
- Where's the wheel?
- Other side, Dad.

252
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,570
You're driving on the wrong side
of the road.

253
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,240
I realize that, honey.
I'm also on the wrong side of the car.

254
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,920
- I'm sorry.
- No trouble, my dear chap.

255
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,470
I've had this bump for ages.
Now I have an excuse to fix it.

256
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,930
I'm fully covered.

257
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,770
I should thank you.

258
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,730
- Very sorry, again.
- No problem.

259
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,610
God, he was nice.

260
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,950
It's not bad in England, huh?

261
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,790
God, I must say,
the English are certainly...

262
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,640
We seem to have run into a bit of trouble.
What rotten luck.

263
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,810
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to get back to our hotel.

264
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,980
An American! Delighted to meet you.

265
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,310
Are you enjoying our country?

266
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,980
If I could get the driving straight...

267
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,650
Don't worry about a little thing like this.

268
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,150
I was driving on the right side of the road...

269
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,490
...which is the left side of the road.

270
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,990
That's the whole problem.
Let me get this for you.

271
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,330
I'll put it back on for you.

272
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,080
Keep that.
Take it back to New York as a memento.

273
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,590
Thank you very much.
That's very kind of you.

274
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,800
There's another one.
Thank you. Good day.

275
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,390
I got the hang of it now.

276
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,520
Just stay on the right side...

277
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,190
Oh, please, let me help you.

278
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,820
No problem. No problem, squire.
No harm done.

279
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,740
- It doesn't hurt much.
- I'll pay for the damages.

280
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,700
Good heavens, no. No need for money.

281
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,040
I'll be all right.

282
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,210
Can I get you some help?
Get you to a phone?

283
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,380
Maybe he knows how to get to the hotel.

284
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:20,390
I hate to bother you, but we're staying
at the Royal lmperial Windsor Arms.

285
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,560
Royal lmperial Windsor! Very nice hotel.

286
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,890
It's a little small.

287
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:30,230
Well, you go back the way you came,
and you keep going to...

288
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,730
You've got a bad cut.
We better get you to a hospital.

289
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,740
It's just a flesh wound.

290
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,400
Nothing to write home about.

291
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,570
- Did you say a left or a right?
- Just a left.

292
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,410
Maybe it's broken.

293
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,580
It's just a leg. I have got another one.

294
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,920
I'll just pop into the chemist's.

295
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,920
Be right as rain tomorrow.
The final isn't till Sunday.

296
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,760
Sorry to bother you. You haven't seen
a bike around here, have you?

297
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,430
It's right here under the car.

298
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,430
The tire isn't flat, so we're in good shape.

299
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,850
Thanks for the directions. Sorry for
what happened. You're all right?

300
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,270
- Sure.
- Drive carefully. Have a nice day.

301
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,950
We just drive around this circle.
It should be the second left.

302
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,620
There's the hotel. Hey, look,
there's Big Ben and there's Parliament.

303
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,290
There it is!

304
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,630
I know, I can't seem to get over to the left.
I'll try next time.

305
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,340
Sorry. We'll get out of this jam
in a minute.

306
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,970
Kids, Big Ben, Parliament, again.

307
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,810
Kids.

308
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,310
- We know. Big Ben.
- Parliament.

309
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,820
That son of a bitch!

310
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,570
Look, kids. Forget it.

311
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,170
It's amazing. I cannot get left!

312
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,340
There's Big Ben, Parliament.

313
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:35,230
"When it's time to relax
One thing stands clear

314
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,230
"Beer after beer

315
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,030
"If you got the time

316
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,900
"We got the beer"

317
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:49,200
"Reach out, reach out and touch someone

318
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:53,960
"Reach out, call up and just say, 'Hi"'

319
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,540
What's the matter?

320
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,710
I can't stand it.
I'll never make it through two weeks.

321
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,130
Two weeks is nothing.

322
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,180
It's 14 times as long as yesterday,
and yesterday lasted...

323
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,550
...an eternity.

324
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,850
Why don't you call him?

325
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,350
- Are you crazy?
- What could happen?

326
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,890
Dad could rip out my tongue, that's what.

327
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,570
He wouldn't even notice
if you kept it short.

328
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,570
Okay, I'll just say hello
and good-bye. Short.

329
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,570
I wonder if anything good's on TV.

330
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,410
Should I watch cheese or snow?

331
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,410
- Hello?
- Hello, Jack.

332
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,920
Oh, God, Jack, I miss you so much.

333
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,170
- Do you miss me?
- Yes.

334
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,590
- Really?
- Yes.

335
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,590
I miss you so much it hurts.

336
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,340
- I got to go.
- What?

337
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,930
- I have to eat.
- Your mom's calling you to dinner?

338
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,930
Okay, I'll hold.

339
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,600
- Can we stop? I'm hungry.
- Yeah, Dad. Rusty's hungry.

340
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,560
We've got a schedule to keep.

341
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,120
That's it!
That's the way I want my hair cut!

342
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,960
You don't want to look like a rooster,
do you?

343
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:22,090
There's Buckingham Palace,
where the Queen lives and works.

344
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,800
Works? What does she do?

345
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,960
She queens and vacuums.

346
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,140
We'd like to check out, please.

347
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,640
Yeah, Mr. Greaseball.

348
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,150
Let's tally up your bill.

349
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,150
Will we really have time
to see Stonehenge?

350
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,400
No problem.
I've calculated the driving time.

351
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,070
If we skip lunch,
we'll make the plane to Paris.

352
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,660
I'm sick of English food. I feel like a blimp.

353
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,330
You look fine.

354
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,330
Don't I just sign?
Pig in a Poke takes care of this.

355
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:02,170
- It does not include the telephone bill.
- We just made a couple of local calls.

356
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,340
That will be...

357
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,680
...$253 American.

358
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,550
- You're mistaken.
- How could that be?

359
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,020
Who the hell called Chicago?

360
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,820
Audrey, your father
didn't really mean what he said.

361
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,200
Yes, he did.

362
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,870
Not really, honey.
He has nothing against Jack.

363
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,200
He's not really going to cut off his balls.
Are you, Clark?

364
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,710
Okay, I won't.

365
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,050
Let's relax and enjoy the countryside.

366
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,140
This country is eons old, kids.
That's centuries, to you and me.

367
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,300
Charming, isn't it?

368
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,720
It looks like Massachusetts.

369
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:02,640
It stands to reason. The English settled
Massachusetts. The old pilgrims.

370
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,730
Plymouth Rock. That's where it started.

371
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,740
And speaking of rocks...

372
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,070
See that? That's Stonehenge. Fantastic.

373
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,080
What the hell is this?

374
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,750
Nobody knows for sure. Some think
it's a calendar or an astronomer's tool.

375
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,590
Others think it was built
by men from outer space.

376
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,430
The consensus is that it's
an ancient timepiece built by the Druids.

377
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,640
Whatever, it's been here a long time.

378
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,890
Since 2,000 years before Christ.

379
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,940
It's bound to be here 1,000 more.

380
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,280
Stand over there.
Act like you're setting your watch.

381
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,450
This must be where they sacrificed virgins.

382
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,790
God, I miss Jack.

383
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,960
We've got to go
if we want to catch that plane.

384
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,330
You're right.

385
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,840
Let's go, Russ!

386
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,250
Come on!

387
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,970
Take a last look, kids...

388
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,720
...at one of man's most curious creations.

389
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,600
Built to stand the test of time
and the elements.

390
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,480
War. You name it.

391
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,240
A thing of glory
for a million future generations to see.

392
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,320
And we were here.

393
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,900
Gay Paris. The City of Lights.

394
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,860
This is the famous Left Bank.
Can you guess what's on the other side?

395
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,860
The Bank of America.

396
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,700
Everybody, get closer to the fountain.

397
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,290
If we get any closer, we'll get all wet.

398
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,630
It'll be a good shot.

399
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,380
The Griswalds in front of a fountain.
Major entertainment.

400
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,050
Russ, get in the middle.

401
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,550
Let me take it.
You haven't been in any of them.

402
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,720
I got a good idea.

403
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,640
Monsieur, excusez-moi.

404
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,940
Clark Griswald. United States of America.

405
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,320
My family and I.
Would you take a picture of us?

406
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,730
Je ne comprends pas.

407
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Could you photograph us?

408
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,780
- Oui, oui.
- Merci.

409
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,040
- Le bouton.
- Poussez.

410
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,580
Okay, Russ, get over here.

411
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,510
Fromage!

412
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,350
Non fromage, cheese!

413
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,440
Une idée! Enlevez les chaussures
et dans la fontaine.

414
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,820
Merveilleux, oui!
Les shoes, dans I'eau, vous.

415
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,950
Yeah! Let's take off our shoes
and get in the water.

416
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,610
Yeah, okay. It's fun.

417
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,990
Très bien!

418
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,260
Cold!

419
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,970
Parfait! Impeccable.

420
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,650
Clark, there isn't anything on that tape
that shouldn't be there, is there?

421
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,440
They took my camera!

422
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,990
There isn't anything on that tape
that shouldn't be there? Remember?

423
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,490
That's gone, right? You erased it?

424
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,580
Yeah, I erased it.

425
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,330
We'll check in and come back for the cases.

426
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,550
Here we are, kids. Chez Griswald.

427
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,140
We have a reservation
for the honeymoon suite.

428
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,350
Mr. And Mrs. Garland.

429
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,360
Clark, look. They must be honeymooners.

430
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,320
Either that or they're Siamese twins.

431
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,860
That's how Jack kisses.

432
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,200
Are you from America?

433
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,740
We are from Chicago.

434
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,790
Chicago. We're from Akron.

435
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,540
We're the Griswalds.
I'm Clark, and this is my wife, Ellen.

436
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,340
And my daughters,
Audrey and Rusty.

437
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,220
You're in Room 714. And please hurry.

438
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,890
I guess it's true. Paris is for lovers.

439
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,390
May I help you?

440
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,400
We're the Griswalds.
We have a reservation for two chambres.

441
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,070
We're the grand prize
Pig in a Poke winners. Oink, oink.

442
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,900
- May I see your passports?
- Of course.

443
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,570
I guess I sign this.

444
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:52,080
I sign "Griswald" first, right?
No, I put "Clark."

445
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,250
I put "Clark."

446
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,080
We don't really speak French.

447
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,260
This is our first day.

448
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,940
What do you think? C'est magnifique, huh?

449
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,440
I'll go get the kids.

450
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,940
Good idea. We'll get a move on.

451
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,460
- Where's Dad?
- I'm right here.

452
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,960
Just looking for the Bible. There it is.

453
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,960
Everybody ready?
We got a schedule to keep.

454
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,470
I vote we don't see any more museums.

455
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,140
I vote we don't get anything else to eat.

456
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,970
What's this?
Do I detect a note of dissension?

457
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,480
Yeah, Dad. Paris sucks!

458
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,140
Everyone's so rude.

459
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,400
- Come on, we're the visitors here.
- This isn't Wally World, it's a country.

460
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,980
We're the ambassadors of America here.

461
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,320
To be accepted, we have to fit in,
speak the language...

462
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,030
...wear French clothes.
That's why I got us all berets.

463
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,630
Come on, Dad.

464
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,670
This is really rank.

465
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,880
Come on now, Russ. Loosen up.

466
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,130
You don't want to look like a tourist.

467
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,680
All the French wear these.
It's the national hat.

468
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:41,520
I won't wear it. It looks stupid.
No girl will want to talk to me.

469
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,520
Then I guess they'll all talk to me.

470
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,860
I vote for berets.

471
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,440
I second the motion.

472
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,200
Berets.

473
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,700
That's three-to-one. You lose, fellow.

474
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,800
France is world famous for its cuisine,
so anything will be great.

475
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,630
Order what you want.

476
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,590
Garçon.

477
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:18,020
Nous voulons commander à déjeuner.

478
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:33,740
Les enfants desire hamburger et frites.

479
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,000
Coca-Cola for the les enfants.

480
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,210
Votre meilleur vin.

481
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,770
You want the soufflé?

482
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:05,690
My femme would like to
commander the soufflé fromage.

483
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,730
Et moi, I'll have the veau, the veal.

484
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,320
Good choice.

485
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,580
Du brie.

486
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,870
Just a little brie, yeah.

487
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,210
We'll get that later. Merci beaucoup.

488
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,590
Okay, just a little bit. That's about it.

489
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,340
Where would you find a waiter like that
in the United States?

490
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:42,100
Honey, speak the language,
they're going to be nice. Just try.

491
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,920
There she is, kids. The Eiffel Tower.

492
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,920
921 feet of historic landmark.

493
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,590
That's more than an acre to us, Russ.

494
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:31,270
- Let's go to the top, Dad.
- Yeah. Let's go.

495
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:38,780
It's magnificent.

496
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,700
It's breathtaking.

497
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,340
I'm glad we decided to be pigs.

498
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,300
Thank your father.

499
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,720
Thanks, Dad.

500
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,970
It's so beautiful, I feel so...

501
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,310
I feel my juices are just...
It makes me so...

502
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,480
I want to write. I want to paint.

503
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:12,480
I want to sculpt something massive.

504
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,820
I've got a creative urge to...

505
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,990
I wonder if there's a men's room
around here?

506
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,990
Look at those things.

507
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,830
- Let's get our picture taken.
- No, they're silly.

508
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,920
- I'll buy one for Jack.
- Okay.

509
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,540
Rusty.

510
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,680
Russ, what's wrong?

511
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,940
I feel like an idiot because
of this stupid hat you made me wear.

512
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,900
I want to talk to you.

513
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,570
Two things. First, you're never an idiot.
You're a Griswald.

514
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,160
Understand that?

515
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,280
Second, you know I'd never do anything
to injure you.

516
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,580
You know I'd never do anything
to hurt my opinion of myself.

517
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,710
If the beret bothers you, it bothers me.
If it upsets you, it upsets me.

518
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,930
How did you enjoy shopping today?

519
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,940
Wait until you see what I got.

520
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,110
I got it because the saleslady
said it's one of a kind.

521
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,780
I'll never find another like it.
I know it's silly...

522
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,320
...but I only got it for you.

523
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,410
Honey, I wouldn't want the kids
to see me in something like this.

524
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:42,790
Sparky, it's our first night in Paris.
Let's do something romantic.

525
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,300
- I'm taking you out to dinner.
- "Out"?

526
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,340
I felt like staying in.

527
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:53,140
I thought it would be really nice
to be alone.

528
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,850
I'd never go anywhere without you.

529
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,820
Cheer up.
I promised you a night on the town.

530
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,230
We'll see some French culture.
You'll love it.

531
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,480
Down with the feet, hip distance apart...

532
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,070
...stomachs pulled in, buttocks tight.

533
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,530
Let's start with head rolls.

534
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:55,410
To the right and back and left and forward.

535
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,420
Isn't this great?

536
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,090
They've done this for eons in France.
This is real culture.

537
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:18,930
Exhale and raise your arms over your head.
Reach with the right...

538
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,100
Clark, could I have the coat check?

539
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,770
I think I've had enough French culture
for one evening.

540
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,410
- Look.
- I am looking.

541
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,120
Back there.

542
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:42,620
- It's just a hooker. They're everywhere.
- Look who she is with.

543
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,060
Russell Griswald.

544
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:03,020
Oink, oink, my good man.

545
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,810
- How did you get in?
- I paid.

546
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,860
- I'm surprised at you.
- I'm surprised at you, Dad.

547
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,280
Don't talk back.

548
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,820
- Who was that cheap slut?
- Cherie's not a slut.

549
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,530
I'm disappointed in you.

550
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,120
Who said, "When in Rome,
do as the Romans do"?

551
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,290
I said Rome, not Paris.
This is Paris, and you're drunk.

552
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,540
Hold it!

553
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:57,860
Let me have it!

554
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,820
Today is my turn.

555
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,830
- Give them to me.
- No!

556
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,670
Look what you did to them.

557
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,500
They're mine!
How many times do I have to tell you that?

558
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,640
Will you slow down?
The kids are exhausted.

559
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,610
It closes in 15 minutes.
There are 100,000 works of art to see.

560
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,530
Great. Are you happy, Dad? She's dead.

561
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,220
I'm proud of you guys.

562
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,980
We've seen everything in Paris,
and we're on schedule.

563
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:13,770
Can't we slow down a little bit?
I'm exhausted.

564
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,900
We'll have a relaxing time
with my relatives in Germany.

565
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,580
Enjoying Paris?

566
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,330
Have you seen the Louvre yet?

567
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,580
Not yet.

568
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,590
The Left Bank is charming.

569
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,960
We plan to go there.

570
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,680
- Been up the Eiffel Tower yet?
- No, but it's on our list.

571
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,930
Have a good time.

572
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,270
What a waste. We've seen 10 times
as much as they have.

573
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,320
Hi, sweetie. You want some breakfast?

574
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,480
I'm not hungry.

575
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,450
He's got his hands on her tits
right at the table.

576
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,620
Stop staring.

577
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:08,450
European standards of public behavior
are different than ours.

578
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,410
But they're from Akron.

579
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,630
Audrey, I've missed the shit out of you.

580
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,300
Luckily, Debbie came by to cheer me up.

581
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,670
- That bitch!
- Something the matter, Audrey?

582
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,510
It's time we asked ourselves
this question:

583
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,480
Is this relationship strong enough
for us to consider seeing other people?

584
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,480
I think it is.

585
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,520
Pass the croissants, please.
And the butter and jelly.

586
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,190
I'm glad your appetite's back.

587
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,400
Who have I got to be thin for?

588
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,200
He's going to pork her.

589
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,870
He isn't going to pork her. Now eat.

590
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,290
I think he is.

591
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,630
He may pork her. Just eat, okay?

592
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,720
There it is, kids.

593
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,970
My motherland.

594
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,060
Dad, Grandma's from Chicago.

595
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:52,430
Shut up, Russ.

596
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:06,240
I can't wait to meet our relatives,
in person.

597
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,660
Dipplestrabe.

598
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,080
What are we looking for?

599
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:14,700
- Sechs.
- That will do, Audrey.

600
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:17,000
That's German for "six."

601
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:20,090
Is that true?

602
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,440
My family and I are looking for sechs.

603
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,150
There's number six.

604
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,830
Fritz, Clark Griswald. Good to see you.

605
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,000
Remember Ellen from her letters?
There she is.

606
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:07,800
And Rusty and Audrey.
They've gotten bigger since the pictures.

607
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,590
Sorry we're late. I went to
the wrong door. Thanks for the invitation.

608
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,190
This must be the German dining room.
Isn't it nice?

609
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,700
Clark, it's just as I imagined.

610
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,450
It's so quaint.

611
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:34,030
Yeah, maximum quaintness.

612
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,200
You must be Helga. We made it.

613
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,500
You know Ellen, my wife,
and Rusty and Audrey.

614
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,710
Let me help you in the kitchen.
Come on, kids.

615
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:50,510
Go help in the kitchen. Help Helga out.

616
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,430
So, Fritz, how you been?

617
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,350
Long time never seen.

618
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,790
Here's your cousin Al.
He's a hotshot lawyer.

619
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:21,410
They'll probably get him on tax evasion.

620
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,120
Here's the baby.

621
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,050
You don't believe that cock-and-bull story
about the baby being premature?

622
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,470
I didn't think so.

623
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:35,890
When me and Jack got together,
we'd been seeing other people.

624
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,970
But this is different, because Debbie
is my best friend, don't you think?

625
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,400
God, it's so good
to have someone to talk to.

626
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:48,270
I tell my parents stuff but they don't seem
to know what I'm talking about.

627
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,530
- What are you talking about?
- You see?

628
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,320
God, I miss Jack.

629
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,340
I was just thinking.
Blood really is thicker than water.

630
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,930
It's amazing how family ties
break through language barriers.

631
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,270
This has been my favorite part of the trip.

632
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,980
Dad, look. Bedpans.

633
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,200
You've been so sweet. Here's our address.

634
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:37,700
When you come to Chicago,
come stay with us.

635
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,040
Thanks for the marvelous conversation.

636
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,330
We'll write.

637
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,230
A festival.

638
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,400
It looks like fun. Come on, kids.

639
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,660
- What's your name?
- Claudia. And yours?

640
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:09,000
- I'm Rusty.
- Hello.

641
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,210
Do you ever get to leave here?

642
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,510
What's so funny? This is great, isn't it?

643
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,470
I love these.

644
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,850
Who wants bratwurst, mustard and relish?

645
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,500
Holy shit!

646
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:58,470
Hey, you! Come on!

647
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:02,430
Very good. We need one more.
A big strong man.

648
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:07,350
Hey, you! Come on!
Come on, don't be afraid.

649
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,950
I don't know if I can do that.

650
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:25,030
Just follow the others.

651
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,300
Isn't he great?

652
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,930
- Those bells haven't rung in years.
- What does it mean?

653
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,940
They're going to hang somebody!

654
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:00,690
Dad.

655
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:14,540
Hurry up!

656
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,080
Oh, shit.

657
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,260
- It's too narrow!
- There's plenty of room.

658
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,090
I know this car.

659
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,600
Get out! There goes the paint job.

660
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,390
Why the sour puss?

661
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,360
You ruined what could have been
the best day of my life.

662
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:09,230
What are you complaining about?
I lost my boyfriend thanks to this vacation.

663
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:13,410
- I vote we stop talking about Jack.
- I vote for that.

664
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,410
I vote we don't talk
about schedules anymore.

665
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:17,490
Me, too.

666
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:18,740
I'm for that.

667
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:23,670
I vote we don't talk at all until we get
to Rome and everybody calms down.

668
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:27,340
Maybe then we can act
like mature human beings.

669
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:36,460
Clark, I thought we'd talk.
What are we doing?

670
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:41,470
We're going to a travelers checks place
to get our money refunded.

671
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:43,850
We'll rent a new car, buy some clothes...

672
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:47,680
...and finish the best goddamn vacation
of our lives.

673
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,140
Let's go.

674
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,860
I think Dad's lost all sense of reality.

675
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,750
Let's get out of here.

676
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,870
What are we going to do with him?
Kill him?

677
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:13,670
Don't be stupid. We never kill anyone.

678
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,630
Then, what do we do?

679
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:20,220
I've got a better idea.

680
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,180
We can hold him for ransom.

681
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,680
He must be worth something.

682
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:30,850
Clark! I think this is something historical.

683
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,560
It looks real old, Dad.

684
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:37,480
That's great. We'll see it later.

685
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,030
Only four more miles. Let's go.

686
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:46,870
What we need now is a dupe.
Someone above suspicion...

687
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:49,830
...who will believe anything you tell him.

688
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:52,620
A real idiot.

689
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,380
Anybody here?

690
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,050
We have no proof
we lost the travelers checks.

691
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:00,970
We left the stubs in the suitcase.

692
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,100
Can I help you?

693
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:08,720
I'm Clark W. Griswald. We're
the grand prize Pig in a Poke winners.

694
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:14,940
We're in a bind. We lost our luggage,
a videotape camera, rented car...

695
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:19,230
...and $1,000 in cash.
So, I'm just here to get my money back.

696
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:23,450
I certainly hate to see
our customers inconvenienced.

697
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,170
- Name?
- Clark W. Griswald.

698
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,170
Ellen Griswald.

699
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:49,100
These are our children, Rusty and Audrey.

700
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,060
Come over here. Show yourselves.

701
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:57,770
Here we are.

702
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:07,950
Excuse me. We lost only $1,000.
This is $3,000.

703
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,990
That's to make up for your trouble.

704
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,500
I lost about $200.

705
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,960
Stay quiet. We'll get you out later.

706
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:27,470
Unfortunately, we somehow
misplaced the key to the trunk.

707
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:31,720
If you tell me where you're staying,
we'll send the key there.

708
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:34,680
At what hotel are we staying?

709
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,900
- The Nazionale.
- Very nice.

710
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,520
I didn't know you rented cars.

711
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,110
I'll see you, then.

712
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:51,160
Let's see some Roman ruins.

713
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:55,210
We've been in these clothes for ages.
Let's go shopping.

714
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:56,870
I vote for shopping.

715
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,040
I feel totally scuzzed out.

716
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:04,050
We'd all look good in some Italian fashions.
Got plenty of money.

717
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,030
- You look cool.
- I feel cool.

718
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,370
Looking good, Mom!

719
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:06,000
Let's go. We ready to conquer Rome?

720
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,190
I'll be back and we'll hit the fountains.

721
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:35,660
I'm terribly sorry. Are you all right?

722
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,540
No problem at all.

723
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,330
It's you. The guy from London.

724
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,160
You're the American I ran into.

725
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:45,880
What are you doing in Rome?

726
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:49,710
On sick leave. A little holiday. Recovering.

727
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,670
Still on holiday with the kids?

728
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,840
Yeah, we're here.
We've just been out shopping.

729
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:56,930
Nice choice.

730
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:59,760
They're right there.
Kids, look who it is! Say "hi"!

731
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:05,480
You've got a cast on your leg.

732
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:10,020
This? Think nothing of it.
Hardly matters at all.

733
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:11,780
It's just a big sock, really.

734
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:17,200
That's pretty nice of you. I feel bad.
At least, let me give you a hand.

735
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:18,580
No, thanks!

736
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:20,370
Isn't this your hotel?

737
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:23,660
No, my hotel's over there.
Have a nice holiday.

738
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:25,420
Okay. Cheerio!

739
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,630
This is the Piazza Navona.

740
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:30,750
Jack?

741
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,300
It's one of the most fabulous squares
in Rome. What's wrong?

742
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,890
I want to go home. I miss Jack.

743
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:43,560
We have a few more fountains to see,
then the Colosseum.

744
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,640
I don't want to see the Colosseum.
I want to see Jack!

745
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:48,690
Jack will always be there.

746
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:52,480
The Colosseum will always be there.
It's been there 2,000 years.

747
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:56,990
If I don't go home soon, Jack will fall
in love with Debbie, and I'll die.

748
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:01,410
Don't you want to see the Colosseum
before you die?

749
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,410
I hate you.

750
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,620
I'll meet you later at the hotel.

751
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,380
What about the fountains?

752
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,250
I'm fountained out.

753
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,000
Clark, let him go.

754
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,880
We're leaving in two days.

755
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,800
These are our last moments together
as a family.

756
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:23,600
Dad, we've been together every second
for the last two weeks!

757
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:28,400
By the way, I've been good.
I haven't complained or tried to escape.

758
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,150
Why can't you treat me like a man,
for once?

759
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:34,070
Because you're not a man.

760
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,280
I am, too!
I'm 15 years old, a world traveler.

761
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,410
I have a part-time job.
I need my independence.

762
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,120
If he's going, I'm going.

763
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,910
Why don't we give the kids
some free time?

764
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:51,130
Sure. Let them go.
They're just a couple of ingrates.

765
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:53,800
They're not ingrates, they're teenagers.

766
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,210
- Where's my allowance?
- Where's my passport?

767
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,430
Just a minute!

768
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,090
Let's settle down and be reasonable.

769
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:05,310
If we think about it,
we can all make some compromises.

770
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,310
Oh, my God!

771
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:21,360
- Take it easy.
- I don't believe this!

772
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:25,450
This is the most humiliating thing you've
ever done to me! This is the last straw.

773
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,200
It's not my fault they stole the camera.

774
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,620
You promised to erase it!

775
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:34,790
I was going to erase it.
The guy stole the camera.

776
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,840
This is the lowest, the worst, Clark!

777
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:42,640
Where are you going?
We're going to the Colosseum at 2:00.

778
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,550
I'm going back to the hotel!

779
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:47,720
We didn't vote on that.

780
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,440
Forget your vote!
I'm seceding from the Union...

781
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:54,020
...forming my own government,
and declaring war on you!

782
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:02,160
- She knows I didn't do it on purpose.
- I don't blame her.

783
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:06,030
Yeah, it's not even a good likeness, is it?

784
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,460
I guess it's just you and me, Audrey.

785
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,380
Buongiorno.

786
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:26,300
That's bellissimo.

787
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:28,350
Really choice?

788
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:34,560
And I think that
you are really bellissimo also.

789
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:37,770
You're not too shabby yourself.

790
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:40,990
- You speak English?
- I'm from California.

791
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,200
All right! I'm from Chicago.

792
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:48,330
Do you want to go scarf
some grimace proportions?

793
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:51,250
What are you doing in Rome?

794
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:53,250
Traveling with my folks.

795
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:54,830
Me, too. We won...

796
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:58,380
- Pig in a Poke. I saw the show.
- You saw the show?

797
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:02,050
You answered the Thomas Edison
question and won car wax.

798
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,720
- You remembered?
- Yes, I thought you were cute.

799
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,100
You thought I was cute?

800
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:22,940
Finally, there's one of them.

801
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:24,450
And she's alone.

802
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,780
Let's get the guy out of the trunk.

803
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,120
Too many people here.
We'll move the car first.

804
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:32,290
I'll get the keys from her.

805
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,830
I hate to see a beautiful woman
drink bad wine.

806
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:16,160
Then you should leave,
because I'm going to get plastered.

807
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,540
What is it?

808
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,630
Is it your husband?

809
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:24,590
That pig?

810
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,670
He's not a pig.

811
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:36,310
He is a pig. He is!

812
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,900
Thank you.

813
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:48,410
Operator, I'd like the number
for information.

814
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,700
I want to call the airport.

815
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:58,160
Numero, please-o.

816
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:02,880
Pan Am.

817
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:14,100
Va bene. Non si preoccupi.
Faccio io. Lasci stare.

818
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:18,690
È stata una disgrazia.
Ora rimedio io, piano piano.

819
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:19,890
Che fa?

820
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,930
Then I rolled on the floor
and started going...

821
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,640
I was completely naked.
Not completely, I had on a towel.

822
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:03,440
He promised me he'd erase that.
He promised me he'd erase it.

823
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:06,270
I'm a ruined woman.

824
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,940
I thought this was going to be...

825
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,620
...like some kind of second honeymoon.

826
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:19,790
We should have left the children
with Helga and Fritz.

827
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:27,130
I'm sorry, but I should go to my room now.

828
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,460
I'm going to throw up.

829
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,890
Let me help you.

830
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,810
No, no. I'll be fine, really.

831
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:41,940
I think you'll feel better if you lie down.

832
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:47,150
I have a philosophy
about dealing with my parents.

833
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,490
If I'm in school or hanging out
or something...

834
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:54,860
...there's all this pressure
to act cool or do the right thing.

835
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:58,160
But if I'm with my parents,
who really cares?

836
01:21:58,370 --> 01:22:02,000
They don't know what's cool and what's
not, so I just put everything on hold.

837
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:05,080
That's a great way to look at it.

838
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:08,340
I'm having a great time.

839
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:09,750
Me, too.

840
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:14,180
Imagine coming all the way to Rome
to meet someone from California.

841
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:21,350
Whatever happened to us?

842
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,520
We were high school sweethearts.

843
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:29,360
We never even did it until we got married.
Well, at least until we decided to.

844
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,820
And I left him all alone in that piazza.

845
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:36,070
I said the "F" word in front of my children!

846
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,870
What kind of woman am I?

847
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:40,740
Exciting.

848
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,910
Don't fight it, Ellen.

849
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:46,370
What are you doing?

850
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,880
Let me take you away from this.

851
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,210
I don't want to be away.
I want my Sparky back.

852
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:56,470
It was just a little argument.
He'll be here any minute.

853
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:58,390
He's very jealous.

854
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,140
I'm calling the manager.

855
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:05,230
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

856
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:17,110
Are you taking any calls?

857
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:22,620
The police are here.
Stay away from the Fiat.

858
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:23,950
I'm leaving.

859
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,710
I'll be right down.

860
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:28,460
Debbie, Audrey!

861
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:31,090
We've got a score to settle,
and you know what I mean!

862
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:36,260
If you want to salvage our last shred
of friendship, do me this favor.

863
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:41,260
I want you to book me on a Pan Am
flight out of Rome into Chicago today!

864
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,470
Yeah, I'll hold.

865
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,400
Bitch.

866
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:57,450
Take the car keys!

867
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,570
Find your father!

868
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,450
Don't move.

869
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:21,640
Mom, where are you going?

870
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:28,480
- What's wrong?
- Mom's been kidnapped.

871
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,940
- Where's the car?
- Over there. Here's the keys.

872
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:00,430
There they are!

873
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,530
Hey, Dad, there's the Colosseum!

874
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:37,550
I've talked so much. What about you?
What are your parents like?

875
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:41,050
There's really not that much to say.

876
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:43,090
They're just normal parents.

877
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,690
My Dad's all right.
He's a little slow sometimes.

878
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:05,200
God, that's Dad!

879
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:10,290
- What happened?
- Not much. Mom's been kidnapped.

880
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,690
Darn it all!

881
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:47,450
Excuse me. There's a man in the trunk.

882
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:57,290
I'm coming!

883
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,530
Take my hand!

884
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,670
Clark, where are you going?

885
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,840
Get back here!

886
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:11,870
You bastard!

887
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:15,040
Come here.

888
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,290
Still on holiday?

889
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:25,710
Sorry. I'm looking for someone else.

890
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:28,510
No problem. I'm used to it. Good luck!

891
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,940
He kidnapped my wife.

892
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,900
You all right?

893
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:04,090
I love you, Sparky. You're my hero.

894
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:05,500
I know.

895
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:08,920
Your parents are actually pretty cool.

896
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:12,430
Yeah, they're good
for a few laughs, sometimes.

897
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:15,760
Now can we go home?

898
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:08,020
Look.

899
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,200
The Statue of Liberty.

900
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:17,490
I never thought I'd be so glad
to see the Statue of Liberty.

901
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:18,540
Me neither.

902
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:24,000
The great thing about traveling
is you really appreciate coming home.

903
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:31,720
I've got to go.

904
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:40,010
I never realized
how much I've missed America.

905
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:43,350
I bet America's missed the Griswalds.

906
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:50,730
I'm very sorry. Let me get...
My jacket is caught.

907
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:04,160
Yup. The Griswalds are back!
