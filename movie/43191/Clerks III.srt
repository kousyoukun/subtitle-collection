Thor's a god.

00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,658
particularly "metal"
about blasphemy.

179
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:25,231
Shah, blasphemy
and biting off
a bat's head

180
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,231
are as metal
as it gets.

181
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,401
There were two men
who were crucified
with Jesus, Randal.

182
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:32,866
Holy fuck.

183
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:35,406
A good thief
and a bad thief.

184
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:36,739
If they were caught,
I'd say

185
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,276
that makes them both
bad thieves.

186
00:10:38,377 --> 00:10:39,841
The bad thief said,

187
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:42,206
"If you are really
the son of God,

188
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,013
"get us down from here
and save us."

189
00:10:45,114 --> 00:10:47,018
So why is this
guy called
"The bad thief"?

190
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:49,783
Call him "The practical
thief with common
fucking sense."

191
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:52,351
Ah. But the good
thief said,

192
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:56,924
"Jesus did no wrong,
whereas we are but thieves."

193
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:59,192
What the fuck
are butt thieves?

194
00:10:59,294 --> 00:11:02,062
Uh, well,
then the good
thief said,

195
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:04,635
"Jesus, remember me
in your kingdom."

196
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:06,330
And Jesus said
to the good thief,

197
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,309
"Today, you shall be
with me in paradise."

198
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:11,541
And Paradise
is a strip club.

199
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:13,747
It's not a strip
club, Randal.

200
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:16,846
It's Heaven.

201
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:19,179
So the moral of your
never ending story is,

202
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:21,851
even in Heaven,
it's all about
who you know.

203
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:24,153
The moral of the story

204
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:26,489
is if you didn't
go to Heaven
as a guest of Jesus,

205
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,757
like the good thief,

206
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:29,661
where did the bad
thief go, Randal?

207
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:31,697
Not that I wanna
prolong your sermon,

208
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,200
but how is it
blasphemy
to remind a guy

209
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:35,664
he's the son
of God?

210
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:37,330
Maybe the bad
thief thought

211
00:11:37,432 --> 00:11:39,031
Jesus had
a Bourne Identity
thing going on,

212
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,572
like Jesus fell
off a boat,

213
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:42,440
hit his head
and caught amnesia.

214
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,473
He was born
in a manger.

215
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:46,039
Now he's
Bourne again.

216
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,679
Matt Damon is
Jesus Bourne in...

217
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:51,747
The Bourne Nativity.

218
00:11:51,848 --> 00:11:53,651
Heavenly Father,
I beseech thee,

219
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,085
please smite
this braying heretic.

220
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,857
Oh.

221
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:02,158
Are you okay?

222
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,197
No, something's wrong, I...
I can't catch my breath.

223
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,330
Stop teasing me.

224
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,664
I'm not teasing, I...

225
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:10,502
I can't catch
my breath, man.

226
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,132
Really? Should I try
mouth stuff?

227
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:14,065
What is this,
a Tinder date?
Get off of me.

228
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,642
You said you
can't breathe.

229
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:18,036
I can breathe. I just...

230
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,236
I can't catch
my breath.

231
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,577
What are you doing
with your arm?

232
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,140
I'm trying to breathe.

233
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,942
You're really
sweating, Randal.

234
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,518
It's hot in here, man.

235
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,117
Can we open the door?
I got to...

236
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:30,119
Mr. Dante!

237
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,690
Oh, shit!

238
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,754
I need an ambulance
at the QuickStop.

239
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,991
Dr. Ladenheim,

240
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,695
report to the ER.

241
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:43,263
Dr. Ladenheim...

242
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:45,234
You had to call
an ambulance,
didn't you?

243
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:47,903
I just ate too much
fuckin' Mooby's,
that's all.

244
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:50,166
Well, if you know
what's wrong,

245
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,838
then I guess
I can go home.

246
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,541
Are you the doctor?

247
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:55,143
I'm the doctor.

248
00:12:55,244 --> 00:12:57,281
Dr. Ladenheim, I'll be
your savior this evening.

249
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:02,080
What in the fuck?

250
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,687
I apologize
for my wardrobe.

251
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:05,250
I just came from
a costume ball.

252
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,757
Listen, Doc,
I'm okay. I just...

253
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:09,726
I can't catch
my breath is all.

254
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:11,223
On a scale
of one to ten,

255
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:12,530
how bad would you say
your pain level is?

256
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:13,531
My pain level?

257
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:14,963
Like a negative three.

258
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:16,603
Well, you're
doing it
all wrong.

259
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:17,767
You're supposed to be
in a lot of pain

260
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:19,638
when you have
a heart attack.

261
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:21,166
Wait a minute.
I had a heart attack?

262
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,841
No, that's not
what I said.

263
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:24,202
You misunderstood me.
Oh, thank Christ.

264
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,575
You're having
a heart attack

265
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:27,309
right now
as we speak,

266
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:30,044
a massive one,
so we have to act
pretty quickly.

267
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:32,010
I just wish
I wasn't
so hung over.

268
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,046
I'm kidding.

269
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,018
I'm gonna go
get all glammed up

270
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,619
for our big date
and I'll see you
in the OR.

271
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:39,054
Look at me.
Uh-huh.

272
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:40,489
Everything's gonna
be fine, all right?

273
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:41,658
Good. All right.

274
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,322
He's not
gonna make it.

275
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:45,763
Jesus, could someone
page the Good Witch?

276
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:47,692
What's next,
a fucking Munchkin?

277
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:51,031
Shave and a haircut
two bits.

278
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:53,973
Shave and a haircut
two bits.

279
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:57,138
I see that you met
Dr. Ladenheim.

280
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:01,145
And she wants me to
prep you for surgery.

281
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:04,718
Surgery? No.
The doctor just said
I'm going to the OR.

282
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,950
Right! Which is short
for operating room

283
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:09,885
where they do...
Ding, ding, ding,
surgery!

284
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:11,517
She gotta get
into your heart.

285
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:13,789
Uh, is the doctor
gonna crack
his chest open?

286
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,588
Fuck.
No, no, no.

287
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,291
She's gonna thread
a camera through
his femoral artery

288
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:20,028
up to his ticker
through a very
small incision.

289
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,893
Where does
she make this incision?

290
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:22,960
In the groin.

291
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:24,968
The groin?
Come on.

292
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,604
So I gotta shave you.

293
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,304
Or I get
to shave you,

294
00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:31,142
depending on how much
you love your job
and I love mine.

295
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:34,841
So, as the wife
says at- 00 p.m.
after Dateline,

296
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,343
every single week,

297
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:39,051
take off your pants.

298
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:51,664
I gotta shave
your groin, sir,
so underwear too.

299
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,864
First, can we
establish geography?

300
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,593
Like, where is
the groin to you?

301
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,296
Where's the groin
to me?

302
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,171
What is this,
a metaphysical question?

303
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:02,200
We're running
out of time here
to save your life.

304
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,507
So come on,
let's go.

305
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,546
Can you avert
your eyes,
block your ears

306
00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:09,179
and sing something,
please?

307
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:11,276
Oh, for God sakes.
What do you
want me to sing?

308
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,914
Not you, him.
Oh, right.

309
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:14,379
All right,
here's the deal,

310
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:15,317
Nurse Jackie.

311
00:15:15,421 --> 00:15:16,854
Mmm.

312
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:18,651
I got a really
small dick, okay?

313
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,960
I promise you,
it's nothing
I've not seen before

314
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:24,223
because I work
in pediatrics.

315
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:25,864
If I take off
my underwear,

316
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,226
everyone in the ER is
gonna see my little dick

317
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,135
including my
friend here,

318
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:31,903
who thinks I got
a giant cock 'cause
I've been lying to him

319
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:33,903
about it since
we were 12.

320
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:35,840
Is this a long
fable, Aesop?

321
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:37,072
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do,

322
00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:39,174
give you a little
more privacy...

323
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:41,309
There you go.
Oh, thanks for that.

324
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:45,151
Unfortunately,
this is as far
as you can go

325
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:48,317
but we do have a waiting
room that's right
down this hall.

326
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,419

Why has he still

00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:03,494
so Jesus
attacked his heart
at my command.

351
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:07,628
Randal's mother
had heart
trouble, too.

352
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:10,395
No,
I gotta make
Jesus reverse this.

353
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:12,472
Pray with me,
Mr. Dante.

354
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:18,504
Oh, my sweet savior,
hear your
gentle servant.

355
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,604
Spare the heretic
I damned in jest.

356
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,682
Remember the words
of the good thief.

357
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,948
Jesus did no wrong,

358
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:30,222
whereas we are
but thieves.

359
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:34,057
DR.- A-ha.
What's up, Doc?

360
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,760
I can tell by your
very subtle tattoo

361
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:38,026
that you're
a superhero fan,

362
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:39,531
so you might
appreciate this.

363
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:40,832
Uh-huh.
You know,

364
00:17:40,932 --> 00:17:42,331
they have a name
for the type

365
00:17:42,432 --> 00:17:43,634
of heart attack
you're having
right now.

366
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:45,133
Really? Okay.

367
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:47,136
They call it
the Widow-Maker.

368
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:49,306
Now, doesn't
that sound like
some bad guy

369
00:17:49,406 --> 00:17:51,504
that Ranger Danger
has to fight?

370
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,878
Why do they call it
the Widow-Maker?

371
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:55,677
Because in 80%
of the cases

372
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:58,312
when there's 100%
occlusion like what
you have now?

373
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,484
Hands down,
patient always
dies, always.

374
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:03,020
Oh, fuck.

375
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,750
But don't worry,
you're gonna
be in the 20%

376
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:07,286
because keeping
you alive is good
for my brand.

377
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,224
Now, if you
excuse me,

378
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:11,259
I'm gonna go fool around
in your little crotch

379
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,031
and I'm gonna make
a little magic,

380
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,197
but I could use
all the help
that we can get.

381
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:16,833
So, if you remember
any prayers

382
00:18:16,937 --> 00:18:18,531
from when you
were a kid,

383
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:19,936
now would be
a terrific time
to dust those off.

384
00:18:21,973 --> 00:18:24,202
Are you there, Crom?

385
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:26,177
It's me, Randal.

386
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,443
Please don't let me die.

387
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:32,185
He won't answer me.

388
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:36,222
After all this time...

389
00:18:37,154 --> 00:18:39,651
devoting my life
to God.

390
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:43,228
Jesus has abandoned
all of us at QuickStop.

391
00:18:43,328 --> 00:18:46,526
I think Jesus
was always more
of a Wawa guy.

392
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:49,895
Yeah, well,
you know what I think?

393
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,838
I think I wasted
my life believing
in bullshit.

394
00:18:54,938 --> 00:18:56,338
I've been conned.

395
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:59,473
Fairy tales, faith
and pledging fealty

396
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:03,344
to a fictional
fucking phantom.
And for what?

397
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:05,312
In my darkest hour
when I need him most,

398
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,187
the Lord totally
ghosts me.

399
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,758
Well, to hell
with all that
made up Jesus jive.

400
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:19,557
Save Randal
this night,

401
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,333
and I will swear
my soul to you,

402
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,166
oh, sweet Satan.

403
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:26,833
Satan? Oh,
buddy, no.

404
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:30,603
I mean, isn't he kind
of like the Optimus
Prime of evil?

405
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,568
You don't have to
condescend to me.

406
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,473
You can just
say Megatron.

407
00:19:34,577 --> 00:19:36,973
I'm kind of
a Transformers virgin.

408
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:39,378
Well,

409
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,447
I'm an actual
virgin,

410
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:43,821
so I know Satan's
gonna want my soul.

411
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:46,358
For what?
Evil.

412
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,296
And butt
sex probably.

413
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:54,432
Do you have any lube?
Are you...

414
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:55,868
No!

415
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:57,964
I don't
deserve lube!

416
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,905
Take me, Satan!

417
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:01,270
Jesus! Pull up
your pants.

418
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,107
Make me
your concubine!
Jesus...

419
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,401
Pull up your pants.
No, stop it.

420
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:06,140
I have
to fuck Satan.

421
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:09,509
And that's when,
I shit you not,

422
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,744
Luke fuckin' Skywalker
shows up.

423
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:14,614
DR.- Uh-huh.
And I'm talking about

424
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:17,583
the young, fuckable Luke
from Return of the Jedi,

425
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:20,224
not the Gran Torino,
"Get off my lawn"

426
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:22,994
Luke from The Last Jedi.
DR.- Okay.

427
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,864
Quick heart update,
Mr. Graves.

428
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:26,723
Uh-huh.
During your thorough

429
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:28,494
retelling of
The Star Wars Show...

430
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:30,400
The Mandalorian,
season two.

431
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,333
...I was able to get
the stent in place.

432
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:33,932
So this is where
I need your help now.

433
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,906
I'm gonna open this stent
and all you have to do

434
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,306
is tell me
when you feel

435
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:39,108
the pressure lets up.
All right?

436
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,010
Let's do this, McDreamy.

437
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:42,646
"This is The Way."

438
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,150
The way to what?

439
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,510
Oh, that's a saying
from The Mandalorian.

440
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:49,317
Huh?
The Star Wars Show.

441
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:50,816
Okay, listen,
we need to hit pause

442
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,685
on all your pop culture
references for a minute

443
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:55,488
just until we open
the stent on three.

444
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,430
One, two, three!

445
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:00,165
Oh!

446
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:04,333
Holy shit, I can
fucking breathe again.

447
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:06,171
Does this mean
I'm gonna live now?

448
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:08,306
Yes, because
I'm an amazing doctor.

449
00:21:08,406 --> 00:21:11,208
You're a better doctor
than Doctor Strange

450
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,307
and Doctor Zaius
combined.
Doctor who?

451
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:16,281
Oh, no, I don't
watch that show,

452
00:21:16,384 --> 00:21:20,113
but I might start now
because I'm fucking alive.

453
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:23,787
"Mazel tov!"
As the Chinese say.

454
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,120
Thank you, Doctor.

455
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:27,589
Thank you for
saving my life.

456
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:30,562
You're like the Batman
of heart surgery.

457
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:31,787
Yeah?

458
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,161
With great power

459
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:34,395
comes great
responsibility.

460
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:36,369
What the fuck
was that?

461
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,536
You're alive!
- You're alive!

462
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,937
Are you okay?
If that was
a heart attack,

463
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,938
I'll take another one.
That shit was easy.

464
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,842
Okay, you must be
on a lot of drugs
right now.

465
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,875
No, they didn't
give me
nothing in there.

466
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,546
I had to do
the whole
thing sober.

467
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:56,448
He's high as a kite
on fentanyl.

468
00:21:56,552 --> 00:21:59,255
Kite imagery,
very cool.

469
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,750
See, Randal,
kites are in the air.

470
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,526
Stop with the
fucking kites.

471
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:04,921
DR.-
One more thing,
Mr. Graves,

472
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:07,894
since you were really
preoccupied about it,

473
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:12,368
so much so that
you wasted time
and nearly died,

474
00:22:12,468 --> 00:22:14,306
your penis is not
that small.

475
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:16,508
It's not that big,
but it's not that small.

476
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:19,338
That's the best
news I heard all day.

477
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,442
- Is he gonna
be okay?

478
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:26,711
How do I help?

479
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,352
Well, if you care
about him,

480
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:30,213
you'll jam a vegetable
down his throat.

481
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:32,920
The guy's got more
cholesterol in his
arteries than blood.

482
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,456
Got it. From now on,
I'm only gonna
order him food

483
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:37,060
off the vegan
menu at Mooby's.

484
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:38,896
Him and you.
Me?

485
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,197
If you're around
his age

486
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:41,796
and eat the same diet
as your friend,

487
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:44,063
you might wanna get
your heart checked out, too.

488
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,666
Will do.

489
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:47,270
But here's something
I want you to keep

490
00:22:47,374 --> 00:22:49,135
an eye out for
as regards to Randal.

491
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:50,604
Okay.

492
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,738
Middle-aged men tend to
go through a depression

493
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,645
after they've had
a heart attack.

494
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,677
Now your friend might
sound or act differently
now because

495
00:22:56,781 --> 00:22:59,249
he's come face to face
with his own mortality.

496
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:01,613
So, for the next
few months,

497
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,717
do whatever
you can do

498
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:06,989
to help Randal
keep his spirits up.

499
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:08,291
All right?

500
00:23:08,391 --> 00:23:10,593
Now, my bill
is in the mail.

501
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:17,035
Judgy.

502
00:23:17,135 --> 00:23:18,437
♪ Whatever it takes

503
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:22,473
♪ I know I can make it

504
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,941
♪ I know
I can make it through

505
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,786
I brought you a hat.

506
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:36,146
Yeah. Thanks.

507
00:23:37,786 --> 00:23:38,916
I can't believe
you're still awake

508
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,385
after the day
you've been through.

509
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:43,529
Yeah, I can't sleep.

510
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,498
There was only
a 20% chance

511
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:49,593
I was gonna make it out
of that OR alive tonight.

512
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,733
Hmm. Is that right?

513
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:54,567
I mean, I figure I got
a 50-50 chance of dying

514
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:56,640
any time I leave
my apartment.

515
00:23:57,307 --> 00:23:59,442
But today,

516
00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:03,244
there was an 80% chance
everything for me

517
00:24:03,347 --> 00:24:05,010
was just gonna stop.

518
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,181
There was an 80% chance

519
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,083
you and I were never
gonna talk about
Star Wars  again.

520
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:13,323
There was
an 80% chance

521
00:24:13,427 --> 00:24:15,060
I would never know
for a medical fact,

522
00:24:15,161 --> 00:24:17,458
I got a normal-sized dick.

523
00:24:17,561 --> 00:24:19,261
You always said
it was huge.

524
00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:20,729
I was gonna miss
a lot of shit

525
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:22,931
if you didn't call
that ambulance today.

526
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:26,630
You saved
my life, man.

527
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:28,438
Oh.

528
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:31,175
I wish I had a life
worth fucking saving.

529
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:32,276
Come on, man.

530
00:24:32,378 --> 00:24:34,508
What are you
talking about?

531
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:35,708
When I was lying there,

532
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,682
wondering if
I was gonna die,

533
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:42,555
I saw the whole
movie of my life
flash before my eyes.

534
00:24:44,156 --> 00:24:45,525
You know what?

535
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:48,088
It sucked.

536
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:52,993
I always thought,
hoped...

537
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:57,269
that my life
was building
towards something.

538
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:59,500
Turns out it was
just the hospital.

539
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:00,599
What are you
talking about?

540
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:02,901
We built our
own business.

541
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:05,576
So I co-own
a convenience
store. Big deal.

542
00:25:05,677 --> 00:25:08,379
I never went anywhere
outside of Jersey.

543
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:10,578
I never fell
in love like you.

544
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:12,042
If I'd have
dropped dead tonight,

545
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:15,520
only you and Elias would
remember I even existed.

546
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,555
I mean, look
at me, man,
I'm almost 50.

547
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:21,358
I sit around
and watch the same

548
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:23,286
stupid movies
over and over.

549
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:27,259
The fuck is
wrong with me?

550
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:29,927
I don't know.

551
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:31,801
You know so much
about all that stuff.

552
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:34,000
I always thought you could
have made a cool movie.

553
00:25:41,983 --> 00:25:43,208
Holy shit.

554
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,343
You're right.

555
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:51,182
I could make
a pretty cool movie.

556
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:53,921
I've been
watching movies
all my life,

557
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:55,859
I've seen all
these people
tell their stories

558
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:58,526
and never once
thought about
trying to tell mine.

559
00:25:58,628 --> 00:25:59,957
Well, fuck
that, man.

560
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,764
Since I almost
died tonight,

561
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:04,333
now I know I'm living
on borrowed time.

562
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,369
So, no more
watching movies

563
00:26:06,473 --> 00:26:08,135
because when
I get out of here...

564
00:26:09,604 --> 00:26:12,339
I'm gonna make
a movie!

565
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,979
- A movie?

566
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,750
Don't you have to go to
film school or something?

567
00:26:21,854 --> 00:26:25,285
It's like 75 G's a year
to go to NYU Film School.

568
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:27,917
And you know what
those kids pay
all that money for?

569
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,462
I don't know.
To watch movies.

570
00:26:30,562 --> 00:26:33,259
I worked in a video
store for 20 years

571
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,765
where I sat around
and watched
movies all day, too.

572
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:39,229
So basically,
I went to my own
film school.

573
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:42,301
Just because you've seen
every movie ever made,

574
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,708
doesn't mean you can make
any kind of movie at all.

575
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,708
Tell that
to Quentin Tarantino.

576
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,812
Oh, now you're
Quentin Tarantino?

577
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:52,581
I'm not saying
I'm gonna make
a movie as good as him,

578
00:26:52,682 --> 00:26:54,046
but I'm not good
at sex either,

579
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,084
and that doesn't stop me
from trying to get laid.

580
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:06,659
- You wanna
shoot a movie here,

581
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,391
at the QuickStop?

582
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,567
Yeah, I've seen
convenience stores
in flicks before,

583
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,599
but I've never seen
an entire flick

584
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:14,130
set in
a convenience store.

585
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:16,005
Because who would
wanna watch that?

586
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:18,135
I mean, it's my life
and I barely
wanna live it.

587
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,807
This movie's meant
to memorialize
my life.

588
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:22,140
And since
I spent the last

589
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,576
30 years of my life
working here...

590
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:25,451
Oh. Working?

591
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:27,583
I got plenty of
convenience stories

592
00:27:27,685 --> 00:27:29,180
to put into
a screenplay.

593
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,149
Convenience Stories.
Good title.

594
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,951
Well, what kind of
convenience stories

595
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:34,625
are we talking
about here?

596
00:27:34,727 --> 00:27:36,322
Remember the time
we went to

597
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:39,395
Julie Dwyer's funeral
and you knocked
the casket over?

598
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:41,228
You knocked
the casket over.

599
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,302
I did?

600
00:27:43,404 --> 00:27:45,000
Well, that's
a scene now.

601
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:46,734
Or how about the time
the old guy
was jerking off

602
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:48,536
in the bathroom
and dropped dead?

603
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,202
That's totally
a scene, man.

604
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,003
I mean, all the shit
you and I have said

605
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,442
sitting at
this counter,

606
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,041
these are all
scenes now, man.

607
00:27:55,145 --> 00:27:56,677
How about the time
you burned
the store down?

608
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,177
Is that gonna
be a scene?

609
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,581
I'm still pretty sure
terrorists did that.

610
00:27:59,682 --> 00:28:00,885
Uh-huh.

611
00:28:02,322 --> 00:28:03,286
- Hey, hey!

612
00:28:03,386 --> 00:28:04,953
Motley Crewneck.

613
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:08,526
Anyone in your
Christian Crypto Club

614
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:11,255
got a non-crypto camera
we can borrow?

615
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,223
It's called
the Crimson
Crypto Club now.

616
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:15,797
Our first drops
gonna be all
crypto kites.

617
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:17,666
Oh, put that
shit away,
Elon Muskrat.

618
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:19,229
What do you guys
need a camera for?

619
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,737
- Mmm.
Randal wants
to make a movie.

620
00:28:21,838 --> 00:28:23,406
Ooh, like
a pornography movie?

621
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:25,102
No, like
a movie-movie,

622
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,509
one with actors
and a screenplay

623
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:29,312
and Crafty.

624
00:28:29,412 --> 00:28:30,713
What's Crafty?

625
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:32,349
That's where the,
uh, crew hangs out

626
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:33,614
and practices
witchcraft,

627
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:35,313
you little
devil worshipper.

628
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,249
Cool.

629
00:28:37,352 --> 00:28:39,984
Crafty is where
you find all
the food on set.

630
00:28:40,088 --> 00:28:41,218
But if you're
shooting in here,

631
00:28:41,318 --> 00:28:43,087
I guess the whole
store's Crafty.

632
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,828
What's the movie
gonna be about?

633
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,526
Mmm, it's gonna
be about an hour
and a half.

634
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,128
I hate long movies.

635
00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:50,598
It's about him
working here.
- Wow.

636
00:28:50,703 --> 00:28:52,670
Meta. Never seen
a whole movie

637
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,338
set in
a convenience
store before.

638
00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:56,171
Right? Thank you.

639
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:58,003
I'm gonna fill
the script with
all the weird shit

640
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,375
me and Dante
have ever said

641
00:28:59,478 --> 00:29:00,510
or seen around here

642
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:01,978
over the years.
Oh.

643
00:29:02,078 --> 00:29:03,482
You should put
in that stuff
you used to say

644
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:04,979
about the Death Star
contractors.

645
00:29:05,082 --> 00:29:07,750
Get sued by Disney?
Fuck that.

646
00:29:07,854 --> 00:29:09,818
Besides, I don't want
this movie to be about

647
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:11,920
other movies.
I want it to
be about me.

648
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,655
It's my flick,
so I wanna write about

649
00:29:13,755 --> 00:29:15,322
the things that I do.

650
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,555
Like, um, like how
we play hockey
on the rooftop.

651
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:20,224
I've never seen
that done in a movie
or a TV show,

652
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:22,796
even though
it's just
fucking practical.

653
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,261
Remember
that fight

654
00:29:24,364 --> 00:29:25,602
where I hit you
in the face
with the bread?

655
00:29:25,703 --> 00:29:27,134
Ooh, that could
be a scene.

656
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:29,103
Or the time
I spit water
on that old guy?

657
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:31,540
That's, like,
the fucking
opening scene.

658
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,207
Ooh, I got an idea.

659
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:34,942
Maybe Jay and
Silent Bob
could be characters.

660
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:37,339
That is the
dumbest idea
I've ever heard.

661
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,880
- Well,
you're still
gonna have

662
00:29:38,983 --> 00:29:40,244
to get them involved
if you wanna set

663
00:29:40,348 --> 00:29:41,983
any of the scenes
in your old video store.

664
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,886
All right.
Watch the
register, dawg.

665
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:46,452
We got to go talk
to the Warner
Brothers.

666
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:50,395
What the fuck, man?
We heard you died.

667
00:29:50,495 --> 00:29:52,060
Almost.
What happened

668
00:29:52,161 --> 00:29:54,057
is I was taking a shit
in the high grass

669
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:55,467
when a rattlesnake
came up

670
00:29:55,568 --> 00:29:57,193
and bit me right
on the asshole.

671
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,504
But like the good
friend he is,

672
00:29:59,604 --> 00:30:01,802
Dante sucked
the poison out.

673
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:04,503
See? It happened
to them, too, man.

674
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:06,609
Well, listen,
when we thought
you were dead, man,

675
00:30:06,712 --> 00:30:08,745
I felt really,
really bad

676
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,172
'cause in all the time
I've been hanging out

677
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:11,812
in front of this
store and stuff,

678
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:14,051
I forgot to give
you something.

679
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,862
Dental School?

680
00:30:24,963 --> 00:30:28,499
Me and Veggie Dick
rented that shit
in 1994,

681
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,999
but we never
watched it

682
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:32,296
'cause we didn't
have a VCR.

683
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,703
But now,
you can put it
on the shelf

684
00:30:34,807 --> 00:30:37,072
in the video store.
Oh, yeah.

685
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:40,141
Uh, the video
store closed
ten years ago.

686
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,108
It did?

687
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,411
This was the
video store.

688
00:30:50,822 --> 00:30:52,186
Oh, yeah,
I'm getting senile

689
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:53,989
and shit right there,
you know?

690
00:30:54,093 --> 00:30:57,062
So listen,
how much we owe
you for late fees?

691
00:30:57,163 --> 00:31:02,364
Uh, well,
let's see, a dollar
a day for what,

692
00:31:02,468 --> 00:31:05,462
26, 28 years?

693
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:11,568
That's, like,
approximately...
$10,220.

694
00:31:13,546 --> 00:31:14,979
Oh, didn't rewind.

695
00:31:15,812 --> 00:31:19,411
$10,220 and 50 cents.

696
00:31:21,354 --> 00:31:23,014
You take crypto?

697
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,583
You guys got crypto?

698
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:27,557
No.

699
00:31:27,661 --> 00:31:28,957
If you never
watched it,

700
00:31:29,057 --> 00:31:30,520
why was it
not rewound?
Yeah.

701
00:31:30,624 --> 00:31:33,129
Hey, asshole,
I said we didn't
have a VCR.

702
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:36,000
We watched it.
We held it up
to the light.

703
00:31:36,868 --> 00:31:38,133
Fucking Luddite.

704
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:40,233
Listen, we'll squash
your giant late fees

705
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:43,203
on the 28-year-old copy
of Dental School

706
00:31:43,305 --> 00:31:44,838
if you let us shoot
a movie in here.

707
00:31:44,942 --> 00:31:47,072
Ooh, a pornography
movie?

708
00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:49,713
No, it's not
a porno movie.

709
00:31:49,817 --> 00:31:52,979
Sex sells, son,
and I'm always buying

710
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:57,587
'cause I am
the Clit Commander!

711
00:31:57,687 --> 00:31:59,020
Snootchie Bootchies.

Goodnight.

721
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,519
Thirty-seven?

722
00:32:36,697 --> 00:32:37,990
That's not
a scene, Randal.

723
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:39,291
Stop writing it
right now.

724
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:41,098
Thirty-seven cannot go
in your movie.

725
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:43,661
Shut the fuck up.
It's nighttime!

726
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:50,609
-  "In Convenience"?

727
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:52,374
It's the story
of my life.

728
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:54,270
Hundred and
sixty-eight pages
full of dick jokes,

729
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:55,744
set in
a convenience store,

730
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:57,375
written in one night.

731
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:59,447
Maybe don't
tell people
that last part.

732
00:32:59,551 --> 00:33:02,083
I thought, you were
gonna call it
"Convenience Stories."

733
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:04,281
Yeah, that
shit sounded
too precious.

734
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:05,822
What am I,
Wes Anderson?

735
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:07,186
Not based
on this script.

736
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:08,651
"There is only
one return

737
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:10,989
"and it ain't
of the King,
it's of the Jedi."

738
00:33:11,092 --> 00:33:12,623
Hmm.
- Hey.

739
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:14,327
You said that
same thing
about return

740
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,098
the day that
guy threw up
in Mooby's

741
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:17,628
and you made
me clean it.
- Yeah.

742
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,166
Everything
in the script
is something

743
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:20,364
either me or someone
I know said,

744
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:21,870
I just made up
new names.

745
00:33:21,973 --> 00:33:23,067
What am I,
some kind of writer?

746
00:33:23,171 --> 00:33:24,567
Ah, yes.

747
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,540
Blockchain
would like
to understand

748
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,639
why the two girls
are into this
"Dan-T" character

749
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,144
when the Randy
character is
much funnier.

750
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:32,750
Randy has been
asking himself

751
00:33:32,853 --> 00:33:34,312
the same question
his whole life.

752
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:36,016
What's wrong
with Dan-T?

753
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,151
Read his first scene
on page 37.

754
00:33:38,253 --> 00:33:39,685
- Are you
kidding me?

755
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:41,119
I'm in this
convenience store
way more than you,

756
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:42,421
but I don't come
into your

757
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,255
convenience store
movie 'til page 37?

758
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:46,290
I had a lot of
exposition to do.

759
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,823
"Enter Dan-T.

760
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:50,395
"A hideous fuckin'
chud of a man."
What the fuck?

761
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:52,770
- Well,
maybe Dan-T's not you.

762
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,167
Do you ever
think of that?

763
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,472
"Dan-T's
hideous fuckin'
chud of a beard

764
00:33:56,572 --> 00:33:59,468
"doesn't suggest Tony
Stark so much as
a male crack whore

765
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:01,406
"who is cosplaying
as Tony Stark."

766
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,339
That's just
in the screen
direction.

767
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:05,181
Nobody actually
calls Dan-T

768
00:34:05,281 --> 00:34:07,785
"a hideous
fuckin' chud."
To his face.

769
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:08,985
I can't believe
you made me

770
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:10,756
sign a non-disclosure
agreement,

771
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:12,387
only to read that
I'm not even

772
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,123
one of the main
characters in the
story of your life.

773
00:34:14,225 --> 00:34:15,520
I mean, I knew
I was never the Luke,

774
00:34:15,622 --> 00:34:17,156
but I thought
I was at least
the Han.

775
00:34:17,259 --> 00:34:18,863
Oh, come on,
I'm the Han

776
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:19,995
and the Luke,
right?

777
00:34:20,095 --> 00:34:22,459
Then who am I,
the Chewie?

778
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:24,364
I think Elias is more
the Chewie, no?

779
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:26,197
Unless this is Empire
then I'm the Lando

780
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,870
and he's the Lobot.

781
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,068
I'm not even
the Lobot?

782
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,571
Which one's Lobot?

783
00:34:30,673 --> 00:34:31,940
He's the one with
the headphones
who looks like

784
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:33,173
a dad who's trying
to be a DJ.

785
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:34,672
The bald fucker
from Bespin

786
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,343
who never
says nothing
the whole movie.

787
00:34:36,446 --> 00:34:38,382
Wouldn't that make
Silent Bob the Lobot?

788
00:34:38,482 --> 00:34:42,052
No. Jay and Silent
Bob are clearly the
C-3PO and R2-D2.

789
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:43,714
I mean, they've
been here since
the first movie,

790
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:45,749
which was
the last time
they were cool,

791
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,856
but they've been
with the franchise
so long

792
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:49,156
they still give
them cameos

793
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:50,521
and put them
on the lunchboxes.

794
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:54,260
So if I'm not
Luke, Han,
Chewie, Lando,

795
00:34:54,362 --> 00:34:56,068
the droids
or the Lobot,

796
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:57,866
then who the fuck
am I in your
Star Wars,

797
00:34:57,969 --> 00:34:59,865
Princess
fucking Leia?
No.

798
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,133
You're the Dak.

799
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:03,533
Who the fuck is Dak?

800
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,072
He's Luke Skywalker's
tail gunner

801
00:35:05,174 --> 00:35:07,041
in the Battle of Hoth.

802
00:35:07,145 --> 00:35:08,406
You know,
the guy who's ready

803
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,114
to take on the whole
Empire himself

804
00:35:10,216 --> 00:35:11,542
until the Empire kills
the shit out of him?

805
00:35:11,645 --> 00:35:14,985
Did Dak
even get an
action figure?

806
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:17,013
Not in the classic
Kenner line, no.

807
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,718
Because?

808
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,385
Because he was
deemed unimportant
to the story.

809
00:35:20,488 --> 00:35:22,125
But that's just
bullshit, man.

810
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:25,459
Without Dak,
Luke could
have never...

811
00:35:25,562 --> 00:35:29,364
Like, Dak was
the only guy
that's, like, uh...

812
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:33,071
I mean, Dak was
plucky as shit, man,
just like you.

813
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,135
Uh, I have a question
about the script.

814
00:35:35,238 --> 00:35:36,301
Great, more
fuckin' notes.

815
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:38,208
Go ahead.
- Yes.

816
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:41,076
Uh, I have a problem
with the Friar
Fuck character,

817
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:42,812
who, I believe,
is supposed to be me.

818
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:45,576
Friar Fuck, uh,
loves Jesus,

819
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,781
uh, to what appears to
be an unhealthy degree.

820
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:50,384
And?

821
00:35:50,486 --> 00:35:53,288
And Elias is a born
again Satanist.

822
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:55,125
Because it was Satan
who saved you

823
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:57,585
when my prayers
fell on the deaf
ears of Jesus,

824
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,656
the giant jerkoff.

825
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:01,360
All right,
listen up,
Friar Fuck.

826
00:36:01,461 --> 00:36:02,693
I get that you
just broke up

827
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,729
with your boyfriend
Jesus recently,

828
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:06,937
and clearly you're
going through
some couture

829
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,634
and cosmetic stuff
because of it.

830
00:36:08,737 --> 00:36:10,570
But for the
first 36 years
of your life,

831
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:13,541
you were into Jesus
to an unhealthy degree,

832
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:16,605
and that's the Elias
that I based
Friar Fuck on.

833
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,408
Then this script
is based on lies.

834
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,082
Welcome to
the movie biz.

835
00:36:20,184 --> 00:36:22,782
There's no truth
in this art!

836
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:24,051
Jesus.

837
00:36:24,153 --> 00:36:26,550
Everyone's a critic.

838
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,055
So, what do
we do next?

839
00:36:28,157 --> 00:36:29,720
What are you
asking Dak for?

840
00:36:29,822 --> 00:36:32,729
Well, I can't do this alone.
I need a producer.

841
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:34,558
That's your job.
Me?

842
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,562
What do I know
about producing?

843
00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:38,298
Come on. I'm already
writing and directing.

844
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:39,697
I can't do
everything, man.

845
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:41,767
All right. What does
a producer do?

846
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,502
Just build us a schedule,
keep us under budget,

847
00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:47,173
secure a DP,
and most importantly,

848
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:49,010
find us financing.

849
00:36:49,114 --> 00:36:52,083
What, I gotta
get money, too?

850
00:36:52,185 --> 00:36:53,343
How much are we
talking about here?

851
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,718
Mmm, 25 grand.

852
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,416
$25,000?

853
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,291
Well, technically,
it's $27,575

854
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:03,193
but it would be way more
if we were in Canada.

855
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:04,553
Where the fuck
am I supposed to find

856
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,093
that kind of
money from?

857
00:37:06,197 --> 00:37:07,695
We can find that
kind of cash.

858
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:09,760
What? How?

859
00:37:09,864 --> 00:37:11,364
We launch our
crypto kite
NFTs next month.

860
00:37:11,466 --> 00:37:13,071
So the Crimson Crypto Club

861
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:14,268
could have a lot
of money to invest

862
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,698
if the crypto
kites fly.

863
00:37:15,802 --> 00:37:17,635
- Again
with the fucking kites.

864
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:20,177
Guys, we need real loot
to make a real movie,

865
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,309
not your make pretend
Matrix money,

866
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,239
you fuckin'
kite fucker.

867
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:26,781
I'm sick and tired
of the kite killing
attitude around here.

868
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,552
- Anyway,
back to the budget.

869
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:33,954
What if we took
out a loan
against the store?

870
00:37:34,054 --> 00:37:35,355
A loan?

871
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why don't we just

872
00:37:37,364 --> 00:37:38,623
slow down a minute
and think about
this first?

873
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:40,725
Slow down?
I almost died, man.

874
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,562
It doesn't get
any slower than that.

875
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:45,267
I'm not getting all
"Dante" about this.

876
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:46,797
Uh, what's that
supposed to mean?

877
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,370
You're the guy
who can never decide

878
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,000
whether to shit
or get off the pot.

879
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:52,341
Well, I don't
have time
for that anymore.

880
00:37:52,443 --> 00:37:54,343
From now on,
I'm gonna shit bricks

881
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:56,176
or what's the point
of being here?

882
00:37:56,278 --> 00:37:57,575
So, come on, man,

883
00:37:57,677 --> 00:37:59,676
get behind me
when I shit for once.

884
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:02,279
So I can what,
wipe your ass?

885
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:05,617
You know, I don't wanna get
all "Dante" about this,

886
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,083
but find someone else
to take your shit.

887
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:30,781
- Well,
well, well,
here he is.

888
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:32,582
The escape artist.

889
00:38:34,955 --> 00:38:37,049
I Sit on Your Grave.

890
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:40,155
Didn't
we have that movie
at the video store?

891
00:38:40,257 --> 00:38:41,950
I Spit on Your Grave.

892
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:44,062
Hicks, you spit
on my grave
in a dream,

893
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:45,696
you better wake up
and apologize.

894
00:38:45,798 --> 00:38:46,791
Ah...

895
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:49,231
So this is a dream.
Uh, if it is,

896
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:52,031
then you need to learn
to dream bigger.

897
00:38:52,135 --> 00:38:53,235
I mean, really,

898
00:38:53,336 --> 00:38:54,833
this is the best
that you can do?

899
00:38:55,906 --> 00:38:57,371
A cemetery?

900
00:38:57,474 --> 00:39:00,875
You can't dream
us into sex...

901
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:02,447
on the beach...

902
00:39:03,113 --> 00:39:05,346
in Hawaii?

903
00:39:05,448 --> 00:39:07,644
Like you'd wanna
have sex with me now.

904
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:09,715
I'm an old man.

905
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:12,287
I'll have you know
that being dead only

906
00:39:12,387 --> 00:39:14,791
increases your
sex drive.

907
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:18,624
The dead live
to fuck.

908
00:39:18,726 --> 00:39:20,763
So you have sex
in the afterlife?

909
00:39:20,865 --> 00:39:22,300
Hell's yeah.

910
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:24,365
There's nothing to do
in Heaven except fuck.

911
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:26,736
That's what
makes it Heaven.

912
00:39:26,836 --> 00:39:29,135
I can't believe my
wife's having sex
with dead people.

913
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,469
Famous dead people.

914
00:39:30,572 --> 00:39:32,104
I'm on the celebrity
circuit now.

915
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:34,177
Bullshit. Name one
famous person you
fucked in Heaven.

916
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:36,073
One. Okay.

917
00:39:36,177 --> 00:39:40,312
I have knocked boots
with the ghost
of Cleopatra, sir.

918
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:42,550
Oh.
And Miles Davis

919
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:45,083
and Frederick
Douglass,
together.

920
00:39:46,388 --> 00:39:48,320
George Washington...
What?

921
00:39:48,422 --> 00:39:50,361
Carver.
Oh.

922
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:51,927
You know how much
I love peanut butter.

923
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:53,928
True.
Who else?

924
00:39:54,031 --> 00:39:55,362
Um, Carl Sagan.

925
00:39:55,464 --> 00:39:57,667
Oh!
A real thinker.

926
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,800
Um...

927
00:39:59,906 --> 00:40:01,666
Malcolm X.

928
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:04,541
Malcolm triple X.
Oh, settle down.

929
00:40:04,644 --> 00:40:07,309
And I'm sure you're letting
them all go ass to mouth.

930
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:09,745
Uh, yeah,
they're famous.

931
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,083
You think
I want this,
don't you?

932
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:22,085
You carrying
the torch for me?

933
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:26,028
I told you how
I feel about
romantic love, Hicks.

934
00:40:26,128 --> 00:40:27,694
Oh, I remember.

935
00:40:27,794 --> 00:40:30,333
You were very
convincing.
Mmm.

936
00:40:30,436 --> 00:40:32,229
Right up until the day
I proposed.

937
00:40:34,572 --> 00:40:36,669
We only knew each other
for, like, 15 minutes.

938
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:39,539
You've been mourning me
for, like, 15 years.

939
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:40,839
So what do you
want me to do?

940
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,874
You want me to just
forget about you?

941
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:45,614
You were all
I ever dreamed about.

942
00:40:46,216 --> 00:40:47,486
Both of you.

943
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:50,885
Now...

944
00:40:52,386 --> 00:40:55,218
God, I'm so alone.

945
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,498
I know.

946
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,798
I know losing me
and Grace...

947
00:41:03,937 --> 00:41:04,998
broke you.

948
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:09,135
But you don't know
how lucky you have it.

949
00:41:09,238 --> 00:41:10,739
What?

950
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:13,904
The Book of Life
is closed
for the two of us.

951
00:41:14,006 --> 00:41:16,777
But you... can still
turn a page.

952
00:41:16,878 --> 00:41:19,576
You get to keep writing
the story of your life.

953
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:22,782
Why bother without you?

954
00:41:22,885 --> 00:41:26,052
Because there are
more tales
to tell, Hicks.

955
00:41:27,555 --> 00:41:29,688
As long as
you're alive,

956
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:32,289
you can always
start another chapter.

957
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:38,260
So live while you can,
love while you can.

958
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,903
God damn it.

959
00:41:44,373 --> 00:41:45,740
Dream bigger.

960
00:41:48,677 --> 00:41:51,144
That all sounds
pretty romantic

961
00:41:51,246 --> 00:41:54,283
coming from a girl
who doesn't believe
in romantic love.

962
00:41:54,385 --> 00:41:56,250
I don't believe
in romantic love.

963
00:41:56,352 --> 00:41:58,115
That's my girl.

964
00:42:00,424 --> 00:42:01,888
But I do believe
in you.

965
00:42:30,822 --> 00:42:32,653
Hey, I wanna thank
you guys for having
me here today.

966
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:35,288
I've always wanted
to be an actor.

967
00:42:35,388 --> 00:42:36,888
Nice.

968
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:41,596
I'm not even
supposed to be
here today!

969
00:42:41,698 --> 00:42:43,193
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

970
00:42:43,293 --> 00:42:45,164
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

971
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:48,039
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

972
00:42:50,677 --> 00:42:52,506
I'm not even
supposed to be here today.

973
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:53,971
I'm not even supposed

974
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:57,678
to fucking be here
to fucking day, fucks.

975
00:42:57,781 --> 00:43:00,647
Oh, shit! I thought
that was the police.

976
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,385
I'm not even supposed
to be here.

977
00:43:02,487 --> 00:43:04,585
By the power
of Grayskull,

978
00:43:04,687 --> 00:43:10,258
I am not supposed
to be here today!

979
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,727
Hey, I'm Joe.

980
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:13,256
Uh, I'm 45-years-old,
recently divorced,

981
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,632
and I figured I'd give
this shit a go. Uh...

982
00:43:15,732 --> 00:43:17,735
I am not even supposed
to be here today.

983
00:43:19,072 --> 00:43:20,563
Damn right.

984
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:23,072
Uh...

985
00:43:23,176 --> 00:43:25,110
Lion face.

986
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,774
Lemon face.

987
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:31,679
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

988
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:33,614
Um...
A little about me.

989
00:43:33,718 --> 00:43:35,912
I'm known professionally
as Boston John.

990
00:43:36,012 --> 00:43:37,853
That's a nom de plume.

991
00:43:37,955 --> 00:43:41,657
Uh, Robert De Niro
is my fuckin'...
Lone star.

992
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,892
You know what I'm saying?
Close your eyes. Just...

993
00:43:43,992 --> 00:43:46,895
Close your eyes.
Just listen.
Ready? All right?

994
00:43:46,997 --> 00:43:49,166
I have nipples, Greg.

995
00:43:49,268 --> 00:43:50,960
Could you milk me?

996
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,934
Fuck, that is one,
bitch. All day.

997
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:56,104
Can you give me one
like Schwarzenegger?

998
00:43:56,206 --> 00:43:58,541
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

999
00:43:58,643 --> 00:44:00,872
But can you, uh,
Pacino that shit?

1000
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,177
Ooh-ah!

1001
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:03,843
When, Lord?

1002
00:44:03,946 --> 00:44:07,145
When will I see
the God damn sailboat?

1003
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,252
That came from a real
deep personal place.

1004
00:44:12,354 --> 00:44:13,656
I have a BFA.

1005
00:44:13,758 --> 00:44:15,084
Uh, I'm a theater
background actor.

1006
00:44:15,187 --> 00:44:17,121
As an actor with
a theater background,

1007
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,229
I was classically
trained in New York.

1008
00:44:19,332 --> 00:44:21,030
Have you
actually thought

1009
00:44:21,132 --> 00:44:22,332
about going
musical with this?
'Cause it could be...

1010
00:44:22,434 --> 00:44:23,497
♪ I'm not even...

1011
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,761
Supposed to be here.

1013
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,402
Hah, hoo, hah.
Yeah-cha!

1014

Kick ball change
and snap,
snap, jazz hands.

1015
00:44:35,544 --> 00:44:37,474
That is beautiful, man.

1016
00:44:39,283 --> 00:44:40,444
Freddie Prinze Jr.

1017
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,982
"I'll fuck anything
that moves."

1018
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:46,017
Wait, wait a minute, man,
is this a porno?

1019
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:47,986
I'll fuck anything
that moves.

1020
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:49,524
I'll fuck anything

1021
00:44:49,626 --> 00:44:50,989
I'll fuck anything
that moves.

1022
00:44:51,092 --> 00:44:52,562
That's a little bit
in your face.

1023
00:44:52,665 --> 00:44:54,324
Let me try it
like this, hold on.

1024
00:44:54,427 --> 00:44:56,027
Can I borrow
your underpants
for about ten minutes?

1025
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:57,694
I'll fuck anything
that moves.

1026
00:44:57,797 --> 00:44:58,895
And, fool,

1027
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:01,635
I always carry
a machete.

1028
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:04,969
I'll fuck anything
that moves!

1029
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:06,805
Sounds like the guy
I buy weed from.

1030
00:45:06,907 --> 00:45:08,177
You know what
this movie needs?

1031
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,678
Deez. Deez nuts!

1032
00:45:10,781 --> 00:45:12,717
Can I just offer you
a piece of advice?

1033
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:14,519
You know what
this script
needs right here?

1034
00:45:14,621 --> 00:45:17,218
Like an old lady
that says curse words.

1035
00:45:17,322 --> 00:45:18,956
Holy shit.

1036
00:45:19,058 --> 00:45:21,685
Who wrote this garbage?
His mother should
be ashamed.

1037
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:26,958
The fuck?

1038
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:29,229
He's auditioning
for Silent Bill.

1039
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,834
I don't know if you know
Sound of Music,

1040
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:35,539
the marionettes were
the best part of that.

1041
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:38,937
I think that's why
they won Oscars.

1042
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,976
It's worth
thinking about

1043
00:45:41,076 --> 00:45:44,177
maybe doing
the whole movie
with marionettes.

1044
00:45:52,922 --> 00:45:54,288
Take your
heart pills,
Tin Man.

1045
00:45:54,388 --> 00:45:55,923
Hey.

1046
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:57,791
So, how's it going
with the financing?

1047
00:45:57,893 --> 00:45:59,427
You raise
my money, yet?

1048
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,794
If it's your money,

1049
00:46:00,896 --> 00:46:02,059
then how come
I have to raise it?

1050
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:03,896
That's Hollywood.

1051
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,333
Did you finish
reading the script?

1052
00:46:05,436 --> 00:46:06,436
Last night.

1053
00:46:06,538 --> 00:46:08,335
And? It's funny,
right?

1054
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:10,169
It's funny,

1055
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:12,805
but it was like
my entire life flashed
before my eyes.

1056
00:46:12,907 --> 00:46:15,138
My life flashed
before your eyes.

1057
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,814
I was glad you left
some stuff out.

1058
00:46:19,714 --> 00:46:20,947
So, uh...

1059
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,047
which one of these guys
gets to play me?

1060
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:24,281
Well, the guys
are too young

1061
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:26,250
and hot to play you.
What the fuck?

1062
00:46:26,353 --> 00:46:29,084
And nobody's nearly
funny enough to play me.

1063
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:30,657
So then,
what are you gonna do?

1064
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,395
I'm gonna play
my part myself.

1065
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:48,544
All right, already,
we're closing.
Gee whiz!

1066
00:46:48,646 --> 00:46:51,614
Why? You're highly
offending me!

1067
00:46:51,716 --> 00:46:54,044
Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Jesus.

1068
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:56,449
I'm sorry, ma'am,
we're closed.

1069
00:46:56,552 --> 00:46:58,052
It's me, Randal.

1070
00:46:58,154 --> 00:47:00,756
Huh. Cool.
Blade Runner,
I like that.

1071
00:47:00,856 --> 00:47:02,958
Thanks. What's
a Blade Runner?

1072
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,126
Can we get back to you
acting in a movie

1073
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:07,696
that you're directing
even though you've
never acted in

1074
00:47:07,798 --> 00:47:09,060
or directed
a movie before?

1075
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:10,763
It worked for
Orson Welles.

1076
00:47:10,866 --> 00:47:12,468
You're not
an actor.

1077
00:47:12,572 --> 00:47:13,870
Neither was
Howard Stern,

1078
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,835
but he acted
in the movie
about his life.

1079
00:47:15,937 --> 00:47:17,000
If you
call that acting.

1080
00:47:17,104 --> 00:47:18,500
You think you
can do better?

1081
00:47:18,604 --> 00:47:20,974
Better than Howard Stern
did in Private Parts?

1082
00:47:21,074 --> 00:47:22,678
It's not a high bar.

1083
00:47:22,781 --> 00:47:25,145
Great, because
you're playing Dan-T.

1084
00:47:25,247 --> 00:47:27,883
What? No, no, no.
I'm not. I can't act.

1085
00:47:27,985 --> 00:47:29,210
You're as good
as any of the jokers

1086
00:47:29,312 --> 00:47:30,988
we saw at
1the audition.

1087
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,349
Besides, if I'm
gonna play me,
you gotta play you.

1088
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:35,491
You have
to do this,
Mr. Dan-T.

1089
00:47:35,593 --> 00:47:36,823
- Oh,
for God's sakes,

1090
00:47:36,927 --> 00:47:38,862
please stop calling me
Mr. Dan-T.

1091
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:40,895
That's another thing.
Fuck all the fake names.

1092
00:47:40,998 --> 00:47:43,158
What is this shit,
Mad Magazine?

1093
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,668
Randal is
playing Randal.

1094
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:49,770
Dante is playing Dante,
aka Mr. Dante,

1095
00:47:49,873 --> 00:47:52,937
and Elias is
playing Elias.

1096
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:54,304
- I'm in
the movie, too?

1097
00:47:54,406 --> 00:47:56,613
Yup. And as a Satanist
playing a Christian,

1098
00:47:56,715 --> 00:47:58,646
you've gotta
act the most.

1099
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,779
It's my very
own chance...

1100
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:02,344
to transform.

1101
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:05,020
And transform
you shall,
Bumblebee.

1102
00:48:05,124 --> 00:48:08,187
Soon as Mr. Dante
secures our
fuckin' financing.

1103
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,823
Yo, it's too bad
you didn't marry
that Emma chick,

1104
00:48:10,927 --> 00:48:12,490
the one with
the big clit.

1105
00:48:12,593 --> 00:48:14,894
Wasn't she like some
kinda car wash heiress
or something?

1106
00:48:14,996 --> 00:48:16,093
- Can you focus?

1107
00:48:16,197 --> 00:48:17,560
Even if we do
play ourselves,

1108
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,465
you still got to cast
all the customer parts.

1109
00:48:19,565 --> 00:48:23,135
Why am I casting
customers to say
all this stupid shit

1110
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:25,008
when I still see
the real customers

1111
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,843
who said all
the stupid shit
in the first place

1112
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,271
come in here every day?
They can do it.

1113
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:31,208
Oh, my God,
you can't just turn

1114
00:48:31,311 --> 00:48:33,210
regular people
into movie stars.

1115
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:36,450
Noinch, noinch, noinch!
Smokin' weed.

1116
00:48:36,552 --> 00:48:37,885
Smokin' weed!

1117
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:39,116
Pack of wraps,
my good man.

1118
00:48:39,218 --> 00:48:40,719
Time to kick back,
drink some beers

1119
00:48:40,822 --> 00:48:41,988
and smoke some weed.

1120
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,288
You own a whole
weed store.

1121
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:45,992
Hey, Randal,
I've got an idea.

1122
00:48:46,094 --> 00:48:48,863
What if Jay and Bob
play Jay and Bob?

1123
00:48:48,965 --> 00:48:52,131
Well, we can
ask 'em. Yo.

1124
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:54,572
Youse guys want to
be in my movie?

1125
00:48:54,674 --> 00:48:56,266
Ooh, a pornography
movie?

1126
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,105
- It's not
a porno movie.

1127
00:48:58,208 --> 00:48:59,875
It's the movie
we're shooting
in your store.

1128
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,173
That movie?
You still ain't done?

1129
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,211
We haven't even
started yet.

1130
00:49:04,313 --> 00:49:07,611
I don't know. Who would
we be playing
in this movie?

1131
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,312
Well, it's these
two characters
I kind of based

1132
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:11,622
on you
and Maggie
Simpson here.

1133
00:49:11,724 --> 00:49:14,020
Check out your
first scene.

1134
00:49:14,124 --> 00:49:15,819
- These guys
aren't real actors.

1135
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,188
But they are real
fucked up and I could
work with that.

1136
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:20,224
This doesn't sound
like me at all.

1137
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,832
What are you
talking about?

1138
00:49:21,934 --> 00:49:23,593
All the shit in there
is all the stuff

1139
00:49:23,695 --> 00:49:26,096
I've personally heard
you say around here.

1140
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:27,905
I do not talk
like this, man.

1141
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,805
Why do you have me
saying stupid shit like

1142
00:49:29,907 --> 00:49:31,333
"Snootchie Bootchies"
all the time?

1143
00:49:31,437 --> 00:49:33,106
- I'll tell
you what.

1144
00:49:33,209 --> 00:49:35,309
If you guys
play yourselves
in the movie,

1145
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:37,812
I'll let you guys
be in charge
of Crafty, too.

1146
00:49:37,915 --> 00:49:39,742
So what's
Crafty about?

1147
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:42,677
Well, in addition to
being the comic
relief in the movie,

1148
00:49:42,781 --> 00:49:45,148
you'd also be in charge
of all the food on set.

1149
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:47,251
Ooh, we learned
about food prep

1150
00:49:47,354 --> 00:49:50,188
back when we ran
the fucking Cock Smoker.

1151
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:51,621
Wasn't that place
just a drug front?

1152
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:54,563
No,
we had drugs
in the front

1153
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:56,767
and drugs
in the back.

1154
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:58,099
- So if Elias
is playing Elias

1155
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,968
and these dopes
are playing themselves,

1156
00:50:00,072 --> 00:50:01,364
who are you gonna get
to play Veronica?

1157
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:03,003
Well, funny you
should ask,

1158
00:50:03,105 --> 00:50:05,040
'cause earlier today
I sent the script

1159
00:50:05,142 --> 00:50:07,042
to someone who
will be absolutely...

1160
00:50:07,145 --> 00:50:09,104
...perfect to
play Veronica.

1161
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:13,850
Who the fuck
do you people
think you are?

1162
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,949
Veronica?
What is this filth?

1163
00:50:16,052 --> 00:50:18,416
What is this gamey,
tawdry trash

1164
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,219
that makes me out to be
some slutty sex maniac?

1165
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:22,989
- It's just
a movie I'm making

1166
00:50:23,093 --> 00:50:24,388
about my life,
and I thought

1167
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,021
it'd be fun for you
to play yourself in it.

1168
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:27,529
Oh, you did?

1169
00:50:27,631 --> 00:50:28,965
Yeah.

1170
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:30,934
Then you are
fucking sick!
Hey!

1171
00:50:31,034 --> 00:50:33,332
Watch it with
my artistic expression.

1172
00:50:33,434 --> 00:50:35,967
"Artistic expression"?
That's my life.

1173
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:37,367
It's my life.

1174
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:39,667
Okay, everybody,
calm down.
Jeez.

1175
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,239
- Oh, come on,
you would have killed

1176
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:42,778
to have been
in a film in college.

1177
00:50:42,878 --> 00:50:43,944
You majored
in drama.

1178
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:46,112
I minored
in drama.

1179
00:50:46,214 --> 00:50:48,246
I majored in
oral surgery.

1180
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:50,145
All hail the queen
of oral.

1181
00:50:50,249 --> 00:50:51,918
Fuck you.
Surgery.

1182
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,486
You didn't
let me finish.

1183
00:50:53,586 --> 00:50:55,251
And I'm not gonna let you
finish this film either,

1184
00:50:55,354 --> 00:50:57,190
not with me
as a character.

1185
00:50:57,292 --> 00:51:00,093
I'm not some
fucking joke
you get to tell

1186
00:51:00,196 --> 00:51:01,930
in your dirty
little B movie,

1187
00:51:02,032 --> 00:51:04,894
you two-bit
strip mall Soderbergh.

1188
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:07,904
I see myself
more like retail's
Richard Linklater.

1189
00:51:08,006 --> 00:51:09,267
- You want
to do this?

1190
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,732
Fine, but leave
me out of it.

1191
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,273
Unlike either of you,
I've got a grown-up job.

1192
00:51:14,376 --> 00:51:17,214
And unlike either of you,
I've got a family.

1193
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:22,318
Oh, man,
I'm so sorry.

1194
00:51:24,687 --> 00:51:26,520
I... Sorry.

1195
00:51:38,802 --> 00:51:40,135
Please don't cry.

1196
00:51:40,238 --> 00:51:43,867
It's just been a shit day.

1197
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:48,073
I had two
cancelations.

1198
00:51:48,177 --> 00:51:49,913
My ex calls
to tell me that

1199
00:51:50,013 --> 00:51:52,042
he's not putting
our daughter's car

1200
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:53,478
on his insurance,

1201
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,748
and so now somehow
she's pissed at me.

1202
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:03,020
And then I see you
and say that shit.

1203
00:52:03,124 --> 00:52:05,822
It's okay. Really.

1204
00:52:05,925 --> 00:52:09,357
I kinda feel like...
I feel like such
an asshole.

1205
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,398
Hey, Ronnie.

1206
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,672
If Randal told me he was
gonna send you the script,

1207
00:52:14,772 --> 00:52:16,174
I would've said no way.

1208
00:52:16,939 --> 00:52:18,834
But now,
I'm glad he did.

1209
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,805
Because it's...

1210
00:52:21,907 --> 00:52:25,414
it's really nice to see you.
Even under the circumstances.

1211
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:30,349
And you look great.

1212
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:32,115
You look way younger
than I do.

1213
00:52:32,218 --> 00:52:34,823
Yeah?
Yeah.

1214
00:52:34,927 --> 00:52:37,584
How young you
think I look?

1215
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,527
You don't look
a day over...

1216
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,429
37.

1217
00:52:43,966 --> 00:52:45,094
So, um...

1218
00:52:46,966 --> 00:52:48,065
You want to fuck?

You think
this means

1226
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:03,948
I think it means
Dante sure is.

"you are a rude
motherfucker.

1231
00:53:13,164 --> 00:53:15,763
"But you are cute
as hell."

1232
00:53:19,068 --> 00:53:20,365
Silent Bob!

1233
00:53:20,468 --> 00:53:23,840
You are
a rrr-rude
motherfucker!

1234
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,604
But you're cute
as hell!

1235
00:53:28,343 --> 00:53:29,839
- I brought
the cat, Randal.

1236
00:53:29,939 --> 00:53:31,741
Perfect. We don't
want him
going anywhere

1237
00:53:31,843 --> 00:53:33,381
near a litter box
until we're
ready to shoot.

1238
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:34,948
So you're gonna
have to hold
him all day.

1239
00:53:35,052 --> 00:53:36,779
But I'm allergic
to cats.

1240
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:39,187
You got to suffer
for your art, man.

1241
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:40,686
But it's not my art,
it's your art.

1242
00:53:40,788 --> 00:53:42,385
Shouldn't you be
the one doing
the suffering?

1243
00:53:42,488 --> 00:53:43,819
I didn't
suffer enough

1244
00:53:43,919 --> 00:53:45,388
when I almost died
from a heart attack,

1245
00:53:45,491 --> 00:53:47,228
which I might
add was after

1246
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:49,063
a heated exchange
about kites?

1247
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:50,728
My allergies
have made me immune

1248
00:53:50,831 --> 00:53:52,865
to your emotional
blackmail.

1249
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,600
Check out
this acting.

1250
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,437
Silent Bob,

1251
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,175
you are a rrr-rude
motherfucker!

1252
00:54:02,277 --> 00:54:04,377
But you're cute
as hell.

1253
00:54:04,479 --> 00:54:07,318
Very natural,
and subtle.
I like it.

1254
00:54:09,352 --> 00:54:11,647
So, how are you
feeling today?

1255
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,683
Oh, you know,
I feel like that kid

1256
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:15,422
that worked
in the video store,

1257
00:54:15,522 --> 00:54:17,520
fully fluent in
the language of cinema.

1258
00:54:17,624 --> 00:54:19,528
It's like I was born
to direct.

1259
00:54:19,628 --> 00:54:21,325
No, bro. I mean,
you had a heart
attack last month.

1260
00:54:21,427 --> 00:54:23,361
Oh, that.
No, I feel fine.

1261
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:24,760
How do you
feel today

1262
00:54:24,864 --> 00:54:26,797
after your Range Rover
sleepover last night?

1263
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:29,534
Stop it.
When I said
to be a producer,

1264
00:54:29,637 --> 00:54:32,072
I didn't mean produce
a late-in-life child.

1265
00:54:32,174 --> 00:54:33,739
Unwilling producer.

1266
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:36,573
I didn't ask
for this job,
but I am doing it.

1267
00:54:36,677 --> 00:54:39,114
So I have a meeting
today about money.

1268
00:54:39,217 --> 00:54:41,216
Fucking A,
that's producing, J.J.

1269
00:54:41,318 --> 00:54:43,184
And I found you
a cinematographer.

1270
00:54:43,287 --> 00:54:45,081
What?
May I present to you...

1271
00:54:46,924 --> 00:54:47,950
Shooter Bob.

1272
00:54:49,425 --> 00:54:51,325
Silent Bob is
gonna be our DP?

1273
00:54:51,427 --> 00:54:54,592
Shit, yeah,
we all gonna be
doing DPs!

1274
00:54:54,694 --> 00:54:56,459
Uh, DP is the name
of the job.

1275
00:54:56,562 --> 00:54:57,694
You said
it was cinematographer.

1276
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,269
The cinematographer
is the DP.

1277
00:55:00,371 --> 00:55:02,071
Man, don't be
acting like
you know

1278
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:03,437
all the industry
slang and shit.

1279
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,967
Me and Silent Bob
are the only ones here

1280
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:08,270
who've actually been
on a movie set. Twice.

1281
00:55:10,209 --> 00:55:11,575
- Come on.

1282
00:55:11,677 --> 00:55:13,581
Yes, he's an
unconventional choice,

1283
00:55:13,683 --> 00:55:16,116
but you are an
unconventional
filmmaker making

1284
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:18,017
an unconventional film.
Yeah.

1285
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,354
You want me to entrust
the story of my life
to the Quiet Place.

1286
00:55:21,457 --> 00:55:23,059
He has some
really nice shots

1287
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:24,391
on his Instagram.

1288
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:26,054
Come on, give him
a chance, man.

1289
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,095
Maybe he speaks
the language of
cinema like you do.

1290
00:55:28,198 --> 00:55:30,197
The guy never
speaks at all.

1291
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:33,070
Okay, so we just
scouted in here,

1292
00:55:33,172 --> 00:55:34,799
and the colors
are fucking ugly.

1293
00:55:34,902 --> 00:55:37,333
So Silent Bob wants to
shoot the whole movie

1294
00:55:37,437 --> 00:55:39,034
in black and white.

1295
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:42,145
Schindler's List
black and white?
What, is he nuts?

1296
00:55:42,248 --> 00:55:44,343
Uh, no,
I'm a fucking
filmmaker.

1297
00:55:44,447 --> 00:55:46,344
And any filmmaker
worth their salt

1298
00:55:46,447 --> 00:55:47,710
would know
that the colors

1299
00:55:47,812 --> 00:55:49,449
in this place
are fucking ghastly.

1300
00:55:49,552 --> 00:55:50,979
The only way
you could
deal with them

1301
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:52,850
is to neutralize
them by going in
black and white,

1302
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:55,156
which will also
kind of act as
a commentary

1303
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,561
on the soulless
nature of commerce

1304
00:55:57,663 --> 00:56:00,592
while subliminally
giving the audience
the impression

1305
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:02,930
that they're watching
our heroes

1306
00:56:03,032 --> 00:56:04,267
from the perspective

1307
00:56:04,367 --> 00:56:06,767
of an imaginary
store security cam.

1308
00:56:07,933 --> 00:56:09,534
That's what
I was thinking.
Mmm-hmm.

1309
00:56:09,636 --> 00:56:11,041
That's what
an artist thinks.
Yup.

1310
00:56:11,144 --> 00:56:12,604
But, you know,
it's up to you.

1311
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:15,412
However,
I'm shooting it
in black and white,

1312
00:56:15,512 --> 00:56:17,506
or I ain't shooting
it at all,
motherfucker.

1313
00:56:17,606 --> 00:56:19,010
That's right.

1314
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:30,687
Jesus, he looks fat.

1315
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:32,586
You're not
on mute, Emma.

1316
00:56:32,688 --> 00:56:36,099
I know. So? Hello.

1317
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:37,865
Hi, you.

1318
00:56:37,968 --> 00:56:39,767
How's Florida?

1319
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:41,302
Full of assholes,
but at least
it's not Jersey.

1320
00:56:41,405 --> 00:56:42,833
What do you
want, Dante?

1321
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:46,034
Okay, uh, this is gonna
come out of left field,

1322
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:51,273
but, um, I was hoping
I could borrow some money.

1323
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:52,510
Fuck no.

1324
00:56:52,614 --> 00:56:54,576
It's not for me.
It's for Randal.

1325
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:57,448
Oh, then double fuck no.

1326
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:59,187
He had a heart
attack, Emma.

1327
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,986
Good. I hope
he dropped dead.

1328
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,852
He didn't.

1329
00:57:02,954 --> 00:57:05,093
So he needs
the money for, uh...

1330
00:57:05,196 --> 00:57:06,459
for the hospital bills.

1331
00:57:06,562 --> 00:57:08,094
Randal doesn't have
any insurance.

1332
00:57:08,197 --> 00:57:09,696
So the fuck what?

1333
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:11,964
Even if I wanted to help,
which I don't,

1334
00:57:12,064 --> 00:57:14,871
I'm not giving
Randal Graves
any free money.

1335
00:57:14,971 --> 00:57:16,637
Emma, please.

1336
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:18,641
You and I once
promised that if
we ever needed help,

1337
00:57:18,741 --> 00:57:20,904
we'd always be there
for each other,
no matter what.

1338
00:57:21,006 --> 00:57:23,674
That was before
you cheated on me

1339
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:26,279
at a fucking
donkey show.

1340
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:27,645
Goodbye, Dante!

1341
00:57:27,749 --> 00:57:30,479
No, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

1342
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:32,489
Please, Emma.

1343
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,885
I'm desperate here.

1344
00:57:35,987 --> 00:57:37,894
Do you even have
any collateral?

1345
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,290
If I have to...

1346
00:57:40,392 --> 00:57:43,495
I can sign over my
half of the QuickStop
as collateral.

1347
00:57:43,595 --> 00:57:45,534
That shithole? Ugh.

1348
00:57:52,576 --> 00:57:55,145
What's all this about?
We're making a movie.

1349
00:57:55,247 --> 00:57:57,843
No shit.
A pornography movie?

1350
00:57:57,946 --> 00:58:00,614
How long does
that take?
Twenty-one nights.

1351
00:58:00,718 --> 00:58:03,011
It's gonna take
my auteur friend
here 21 nights

1352
00:58:03,114 --> 00:58:05,547
for him to cinematically
suck his own dick.

1353
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,885
In a row?

1354
00:58:08,427 --> 00:58:11,187
"In Convenience."
I don't get it.

1355
00:58:12,131 --> 00:58:13,756
Scene ten,
take one!

1356
00:58:15,895 --> 00:58:17,568
Cat Wrangler!

1357
00:58:31,249 --> 00:58:32,781
All right,
let's go.

1358
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:35,280
And...

1359
00:58:35,382 --> 00:58:36,981
action.

1360
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:41,089
Holy shit.

1361
00:58:41,189 --> 00:58:42,593
We got poop.

1362
00:58:44,529 --> 00:58:46,322
And action.

1363
00:58:46,426 --> 00:58:47,427
Fuck.

1364
00:59:01,777 --> 00:59:04,438
What are you
waitin' for?
Dance!

1365
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,083
I ain't doing this
with all these fuckin'
people watching.

1366
00:59:08,185 --> 00:59:09,614
Oh, my God.

1367
00:59:09,718 --> 00:59:11,013
Cut!

1368
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:12,653
The talent's
being a little bitch.

1369
00:59:12,753 --> 00:59:14,552
Can you guys wait
in the video store?

1370
00:59:14,654 --> 00:59:16,424
I'll run the camera.

1371
00:59:16,524 --> 00:59:18,926
- Unbelievable.
Really?

1372
00:59:26,537 --> 00:59:28,600
There, ya happy?
I cleared the set.

1373
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,468
So fucking
dance, man.

1374
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:33,406

a little action

1450
01:04:07,783 --> 01:04:09,114
so I added a scene
where Cohee

1451
01:04:09,217 --> 01:04:11,215
comes in to
rob the place
at the end.

1452
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:13,122

you get shot.

1453
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,987
No way. I'm not letting

1455
01:04:17,628 --> 01:04:20,093

01:04:20,196 --> 01:04:24,324

says I gotta cut
your scene, man.

1457
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,427
Yo, I'm still pay
or play, right?

1458
01:04:26,531 --> 01:04:29,200
Publicity? Isn't it
a little early for that?

1459
01:04:29,302 --> 01:04:31,038
I've been
reading the paper
my whole life

1460
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:32,739
and the only time
I've seen my name in it

1461
01:04:32,842 --> 01:04:34,206
was under
the headline,

1462
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:36,637
"Local grocer has
massive heart attack."

1463
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:40,312
So I thought in your
official capacity
as producer,

1464
01:04:40,414 --> 01:04:42,312
maybe you can get
a cub reporter
over here

1465
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:45,145
to do a story
about your director
in action.

1466
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,425
- "I assure you
we're open."

1467
01:04:50,527 --> 01:04:52,093
I don't get it.

1468
01:04:52,196 --> 01:04:54,227
Some savages are
always sticking
gum in the locks,

1469
01:04:54,329 --> 01:04:56,633
so I wrote it
into the script
to be the reason

1470
01:04:56,733 --> 01:04:58,162
the shutters
are closed all day.

1471
01:04:58,262 --> 01:04:59,635
That way,
we can shoot
at night

1472
01:04:59,737 --> 01:05:01,166
and pretend
it's day out.

1473
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:04,169
I fucking hate
how fake
Hollywood is.

1474
01:05:04,271 --> 01:05:07,038

Your ruse.

1476
01:05:08,978 --> 01:05:11,208

1481
01:05:21,954 --> 01:05:23,051

1482
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:24,489
- And cut.

1483
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,396
- Nice work.

1484
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,768
Nice work.

1485
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:33,770
Okay, now just give
me ten minutes

1486
01:05:33,872 --> 01:05:35,666
and then
I'll be ready
to do mine.

1487
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,040

1488
01:05:37,605 --> 01:05:40,072

1489
01:05:40,177 --> 01:05:43,279

a down note.

1497
01:06:00,864 --> 01:06:03,125

By this time,
your lung looks
like this.

1526
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:00,382
So why don't you put
the cigarettes back

1527
01:07:00,482 --> 01:07:02,218
and try some
gum instead?

1528
01:07:02,322 --> 01:07:05,056

try this.

What is that?

01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:11,259
What happened
to the model of
the lung I gave ya?

1532
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:12,865
I'm a method actor.

1533
01:07:12,968 --> 01:07:14,197
I ditched
the model lung

1534
01:07:14,301 --> 01:07:15,872
for this tripe
I got at Foodtown.

1535
01:07:15,974 --> 01:07:18,699
Jesus.
I used my power
of stagecraft

1536
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:21,777
to see that
stomach as a lung.
It's method!

1537
01:07:21,877 --> 01:07:23,572
- And you're
Dante Hicks.

1538
01:07:23,676 --> 01:07:26,309
We went to
the same school.
You played hockey.

1539
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:27,915
Yeah. How'd you
know that?

You still going

No, she's

01:07:30,982 --> 01:07:32,414

No.

1543
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:34,315

01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:36,190
- What is...
You know what?

1545
01:07:36,292 --> 01:07:39,420
Cut, cut, cut!
I can't abide
by this racist shit.

1546
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:41,790
Racist? How the
hell is it racist?

1547
01:07:41,892 --> 01:07:44,064
Just look at all
this fucking
lack of diversity.

1548
01:07:44,166 --> 01:07:48,503
And calling some
guy an Asian
design major

1549
01:07:48,605 --> 01:07:50,031
just feels racist.

1550
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:54,477
That's not racist.
The guy literally
majored in Asian design.

1551
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:56,312
Are you sure?

1552
01:07:56,414 --> 01:07:59,014
Wasn't he a, uh, Asian
student who was also
a design major?

1553
01:07:59,115 --> 01:08:02,945
He was a passionate
student of Asian design.

1554
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:06,952
It just so happens
he himself was
coincidentally Asian.

1555
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:11,287
Take it easy, man.

1556
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:15,730
So, uh, where are
we gonna shoot the
donkey show scene?

1557
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:17,700
Where it happened.
Mooby's.

1558
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,165
Our Mooby's?
Yeah.

1559
01:08:19,267 --> 01:08:20,829
How are we supposed
to get in?

1560
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,666
I got the locations
department
working on it.

1561
01:08:23,768 --> 01:08:26,839
It's stuck in my hair.

1562
01:08:26,941 --> 01:08:29,439
Shit. Can you
get it?

1563
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:33,046
Ugh. I hate wearing
the Mooby suit, man.

No what?
No, I... I can't
go inside.

1586
01:09:41,284 --> 01:09:42,783
Of course, you can.

1587
01:09:42,883 --> 01:09:44,617
Becks, I can't.

1588
01:09:44,717 --> 01:09:48,152
We had the best
times of our lives
in that place.

1589
01:09:48,254 --> 01:09:50,717
Until one of our
lives ended.

1590
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,689
It's just
a building, Hicks.

1591
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:56,332
It's just a building
I haven't been
inside since...

1592
01:09:58,296 --> 01:09:59,833
Since you...

1593
01:09:59,936 --> 01:10:02,064
I know. I'm sorry.

1594
01:10:04,004 --> 01:10:05,504
Just turn the page.

1595
01:10:06,404 --> 01:10:07,871
You can do this,
babes.

1596
01:10:08,812 --> 01:10:10,938
No.

1597
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:12,913
Don't go.

1598
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,524
Uh, Randal.
This is Lisa

1599
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,527
and her daughter...
Lisa.

1600
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,298
Uh, Lisa goes
to high school

1601
01:10:35,401 --> 01:10:37,198
at Henry
Hudson Regional.
Oh.

1602
01:10:37,298 --> 01:10:40,675
And this is my husband,
Lando, who can
go straight to hell.

1603
01:10:40,777 --> 01:10:42,109
I'm so mad at you.

1604
01:10:42,211 --> 01:10:43,872
Don't say a damn word
the whole night.

1605
01:10:43,974 --> 01:10:46,509
Don't even
think words!
- Uh...

1606
01:10:46,611 --> 01:10:48,115
We're gonna shoot
a movie in a minute

1607
01:10:48,215 --> 01:10:49,448
so I gotta
chase you guys

1608
01:10:49,548 --> 01:10:50,645
out of here.
- Oh, okay, my bad.

1609
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,251
I guess you
don't want press

1610
01:10:52,354 --> 01:10:53,349
for your little
YouTube video, then.

1611
01:10:53,451 --> 01:10:54,583
Did you say press?

1612
01:10:54,685 --> 01:10:56,223
- Mr. Dante
asked them

1613
01:10:56,325 --> 01:10:57,455
to come here
to cover the shoot.

1614
01:10:57,557 --> 01:10:59,794
So you're saying
little Lisa is...

1615
01:10:59,896 --> 01:11:02,358
Ah! High School Lisa.

1616
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,757
Don't call her
little Lisa

1617
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,600
and you better not
call me big Lisa.

1618
01:11:05,702 --> 01:11:09,301
High School Lisa
writes for the high
school newspaper?

1619
01:11:09,404 --> 01:11:11,298
And her parents
are the chaperones.

1620
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,935
Fucking great.

1621
01:11:13,037 --> 01:11:14,270
- Even though
one parent
just came out

1622
01:11:14,374 --> 01:11:15,937
of the strip club tonight

1623
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:19,041
spending all my $5 bills
that I got at bingo. Bitch.

1624
01:11:21,415 --> 01:11:23,916
Hey! The producer's
on set.

1625
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:27,185
So lights! Camera!

1626
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:29,020
Action!

1627
01:11:29,123 --> 01:11:30,789
He looks drunk.

1628
01:11:30,891 --> 01:11:32,890
He looks like
he needs a piece
of butter and bread.

1629
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:37,833
Ooh, it's cold in here.

1630
01:11:37,935 --> 01:11:39,898
Cough cold... Hey!

1631
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,401
All right, look,

1632
01:11:41,503 --> 01:11:43,905
I realize going to Mooby's
might have hit you hard

1633
01:11:44,006 --> 01:11:45,337
but you just take off?

1634
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,708
We couldn't even shoot
the donkey show!

1635
01:11:47,812 --> 01:11:48,770
Oh, big deal.

1636
01:11:48,873 --> 01:11:50,774
What the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

1637
01:11:50,876 --> 01:11:54,441
Try thinking of somebody
other than yourself for once.

1638
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,249
Myself?
Okay.

1639
01:11:56,351 --> 01:11:57,813
We're gonna
shoot this scene

1640
01:11:57,916 --> 01:11:59,646
because the kid from
the high school newspaper

1641
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,521
and her mom
are waiting.

1642
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:03,787
Thanks for understanding
the assignment on that one.

1643
01:12:03,889 --> 01:12:05,791
But since you
showed up here
shit-faced

1644
01:12:05,894 --> 01:12:08,560
and ruined tonight
before we even had
a chance to roll,

1645
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:10,858
we're gonna
re-shoot this tomorrow.

1646
01:12:10,961 --> 01:12:13,729
So get your selfish ass
out there on that cooler

1647
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:15,335
and let's pretend
for a minute

1648
01:12:15,437 --> 01:12:17,666
you've actually
been helpful
on my movie,

1649
01:12:17,769 --> 01:12:19,238
which is, like,
the only thing

1650
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:21,175
I ever asked you
to do for me

1651
01:12:21,277 --> 01:12:23,208
and only after I almost
dropped dead

1652
01:12:23,312 --> 01:12:25,708
from a fucking
heart attack.

1653
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:28,145
You're fucking
unbelievable, man.

1654
01:12:28,247 --> 01:12:29,714
Come on!

1655
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,152
What...

1656
01:12:41,229 --> 01:12:43,062
In Convenience.

1657
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,628
Stupid title.

1658
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:47,534
Scene 137.
Take one.

1659
01:12:47,634 --> 01:12:49,536
Are they shooting this
in black and white?

1660
01:12:49,639 --> 01:12:52,235
I see a lot of white.
I don't see the black.

1661
01:12:52,337 --> 01:12:54,642
- And action.

We're gonna need
a bigger boat.

1667
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,421
Man goes into cage,
cage goes into salsa.

1668
01:13:10,523 --> 01:13:13,122
Shark's in the salsa.
Our shark.

1669
01:13:14,892 --> 01:13:16,762
Oh, what?
What's with you, man?

1670
01:13:16,863 --> 01:13:18,594
You haven't said
anything in,
like, 20 minutes.

1671
01:13:18,698 --> 01:13:20,263
What the hell's
your problem?

1672
01:13:20,366 --> 01:13:21,770
This life.

1673
01:13:21,873 --> 01:13:23,833
This life?

1674
01:13:23,935 --> 01:13:26,771
I'm stuck in this pit
on my day off,

1675
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:30,640
dealing with every backward
ass fuck on the planet.

1676
01:13:30,742 --> 01:13:32,674
I smell like
shoe polish,

1677
01:13:32,776 --> 01:13:35,379
and my girlfriend
sucked 36 dicks.

1678
01:13:35,481 --> 01:13:36,580
Thirty-seven.
- Oh!

1679
01:13:36,682 --> 01:13:38,387
Cover your ears,
baby girl.

1680
01:13:38,488 --> 01:13:39,948
Why the fuck
are they cursing
like that?

1681
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,421
You need to shit
or get off the pot.

1682
01:13:42,523 --> 01:13:43,983
What the hell
are you talking about?

1683
01:13:44,085 --> 01:13:45,725
I'm talking about
this thing you have,

1684
01:13:45,827 --> 01:13:48,125
this inability
to improve your
station in life.

1685
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:49,291
Fuck you.

1686
01:13:49,395 --> 01:13:50,997
It's true, man.

1687
01:13:51,099 --> 01:13:53,399
You sit there and
blame life for dealin'
ya a cruddy hand,

1688
01:13:53,501 --> 01:13:55,333
never once
accepting
responsibility

1689
01:13:55,437 --> 01:13:57,063
for the way your
situation is.

1690
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,474
You better leave me
the fuck alone, man.

1691
01:13:59,576 --> 01:14:01,036
It's because
you're comfortable,
right?

1692
01:14:01,138 --> 01:14:02,673
This is the life of
convenience for you

1693
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:04,710
and any attempt
to change it
would shatter

1694
01:14:04,812 --> 01:14:07,079
the pathetic microcosm
you've fashioned
for yourself.

1695
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:08,517
What?

1696
01:14:08,619 --> 01:14:09,979
Man, if you
weren't such
a fucking coward.

1697
01:14:10,081 --> 01:14:12,621
Oh, would you
shut the fuck up?

1698
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:16,291
That's not
the line, man.

1699
01:14:16,394 --> 01:14:18,122
What are you doing?
My whole life

1700
01:14:18,224 --> 01:14:20,559
you've been running
your mouth a million
miles an hour

1701
01:14:20,661 --> 01:14:22,457
and saying
absolutely nothing!

1702
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,599
I gotta listen
to you talk shit

1703
01:14:25,701 --> 01:14:27,798
about everybody
and everything
you think

1704
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:30,666
as if the world's waiting
for you to weigh in!

1705
01:14:30,768 --> 01:14:33,206
Nobody fuckin' cares.

1706
01:14:33,308 --> 01:14:34,707
Oh, real nice, pal.

1707
01:14:34,809 --> 01:14:36,344
Get me all worked up
because it's not like

1708
01:14:36,446 --> 01:14:37,743
I had a heart attack
and almost...

1709
01:14:37,844 --> 01:14:41,310
Died! "I almost died
from a heart attack!

1710
01:14:41,412 --> 01:14:44,079
"Did I not mention
that a couple of
thousand times yet?"

1711
01:14:44,181 --> 01:14:47,287
Fuck you.
"Hey, everybody,
look at me.

1712
01:14:47,389 --> 01:14:48,618
"I'm the boy who lived."

1713
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,691
"So I gotta
make a movie

1714
01:14:51,793 --> 01:14:53,688
"all about what
a relentless fucking
asshole I am

1715
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:55,123
"to everybody
I ever met,

1716
01:14:55,225 --> 01:14:57,793
"especially my so-called
fucking friends."

1717
01:14:57,895 --> 01:14:59,598
Oh, we're not friends
anymore, man.

1718
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,234
You can fucking
believe that shit.

1719
01:15:01,336 --> 01:15:02,534
Oh, good!
Yeah.

1720
01:15:02,634 --> 01:15:04,366
Because if we're
not friends,

1721
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:07,375
I don't have to worry
anymore what
the cold, hard truth

1722
01:15:07,478 --> 01:15:09,236
might do to your poor,
wittle heart!

1723
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:12,181
Oh, don't worry
about me, pal,
I'll be just fine.

1724
01:15:12,284 --> 01:15:13,444
So since I can
be completely

1725
01:15:13,546 --> 01:15:14,743
honest with you?
Oh, please,

1726
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,509
be completely honest.

1727
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:21,217
You think you
deserve a movie?

1728
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:22,753
Yeah.

1729
01:15:22,855 --> 01:15:26,326
What did you
ever do in life
but watch it

1730
01:15:26,426 --> 01:15:27,890
and mock it?

1731
01:15:27,992 --> 01:15:30,394
What have you ever
fucking done?

1732
01:15:30,496 --> 01:15:32,062
I had a life.

1733
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:36,030
I was this close
to happily ever after

1734
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:39,905
and then, one drunk
driver later...

1735
01:15:41,243 --> 01:15:42,610
my movie's over.

1736
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,581
Forever.

1737
01:15:46,147 --> 01:15:47,606
No happy ending,

1738
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,711
no sequel.

1739
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:51,849
Not even a third
fucking act,

1740
01:15:51,951 --> 01:15:55,222
just, "Fuck you!
And, oh, by the way,

1741
01:15:55,324 --> 01:15:58,318
"fuck you!" Credits.

1742
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:01,598
But, hey...

1743
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:05,000
What's that compared
to a heart attack?

1744
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:07,062
I mean, shit!

1745
01:16:07,164 --> 01:16:09,806
You could have
almost died, right?

1746
01:16:09,908 --> 01:16:11,270
Yeah.

1747
01:16:11,374 --> 01:16:13,137
Well, some of us
did die.

1748
01:16:15,876 --> 01:16:18,912
Some of us have
been dead inside
ever since.

1749
01:16:19,014 --> 01:16:22,346
But then, just when
I'm able to walk
into this place

1750
01:16:22,448 --> 01:16:26,788
without wanting to
kill myself every day,
you have an idea.

1751
01:16:27,919 --> 01:16:29,890
You wanna make a movie
about your life.

1752
01:16:29,992 --> 01:16:32,924
Oh, and you...
you've been very
clear about that.

1753
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,091
It's your life!

1754
01:16:36,795 --> 01:16:39,860
Well, get this,
you self-centered,

1755
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:41,500
gaping wound
of a human being

1756
01:16:41,604 --> 01:16:43,730
with your insatiable
fucking ego!

1757
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,601
The fuck?

1758
01:16:45,703 --> 01:16:47,039
Your life...

1759
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:49,776
is my life!

1760
01:16:51,108 --> 01:16:54,341
I've been
there with you
the whole time!

1761
01:16:56,819 --> 01:17:00,083
And since you know
how hard that life's
been on me,

1762
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:03,451
did it ever
occur to you

1763
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:07,189
that maybe I didn't wanna
relive that fucking life?

1764
01:17:09,857 --> 01:17:11,095
So, I quit...

1765
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:13,395
as your producer.

1766
01:17:15,335 --> 01:17:16,871
And I quit...

1767
01:17:18,309 --> 01:17:20,204
as your fucking friend.

1768
01:17:23,746 --> 01:17:26,144
'Cause I'm not
even supposed to...

1769
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:33,048
Now that's what
I call acting!

1770
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:36,017
Come on, everybody,
clap it up for that.

1771
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,992
Okay, Drinkie-Mc-Stinky,
get up.

1772
01:17:41,229 --> 01:17:42,291
Dante?

1773
01:17:43,428 --> 01:17:44,424
Hey.

1774
01:17:45,268 --> 01:17:48,764
Hey. Hey! Dante!

1775
01:17:48,866 --> 01:17:50,303
Wake up, man. Hey!

1776
01:17:50,405 --> 01:17:51,704
Call an ambulance!

1777
01:17:51,806 --> 01:17:54,303
Wake up, man.
Dante. Dante!

1778
01:17:58,147 --> 01:17:59,941
Dante? Um...

1779
01:18:00,043 --> 01:18:01,684
Excuse me. We're...
What the...

1780
01:18:01,786 --> 01:18:02,978
No, you can't be
back here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1781
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,486
All right,
already. God.

1782
01:18:05,587 --> 01:18:06,715
They just brought
our friend in.

1783
01:18:06,817 --> 01:18:08,481
His name
is Dante Hicks.

1784
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:10,186
He's the drunk guy
that collapsed
at the QuickStop.

1785
01:18:10,288 --> 01:18:11,791
- Uh-huh.
The first
responder said

1786
01:18:11,894 --> 01:18:12,987
he's having
a heart attack.
Okay, okay.

1787
01:18:13,089 --> 01:18:14,562
You need to wait
out there, sir.

1788
01:18:14,664 --> 01:18:15,791
Someone will be by
to tell you more

1789
01:18:15,895 --> 01:18:17,362
as soon as
we know more.

1790
01:18:19,234 --> 01:18:20,229
Thank you.

1791
01:18:22,838 --> 01:18:25,474
This is where
I first rejected Jesus.

1792
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:28,575
Yeah, and now look
what's happened.

1793
01:18:28,675 --> 01:18:30,003
So weird to be
back here.

1794
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:32,307
Yeah, tell me
about it.

1795
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:34,881
All right, look.
I'm gonna get
out of here.

1796
01:18:34,983 --> 01:18:37,145
Call me as soon
as they say something,
all right?

1797
01:18:37,247 --> 01:18:38,851
Wait, what?
Where are you going?

1798
01:18:38,953 --> 01:18:41,618
I'm gonna go work
on my movie, man.

1799
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:42,820
Your movie?

1800
01:18:42,921 --> 01:18:44,520
Yeah, I mean,
it's almost done.

1801
01:18:44,622 --> 01:18:46,594
It's not like I'm doing
Dante any good
sitting around here.

1802
01:18:46,696 --> 01:18:48,693
I might as well
go work on my movie.

1803
01:18:48,795 --> 01:18:51,131
Are you kidding me?
Even now?

1804
01:18:51,233 --> 01:18:53,201
"Even now" what?

1805
01:18:53,301 --> 01:18:54,603
"Oh, my movie.

1806
01:18:54,705 --> 01:18:56,733
"My movie!
Everybody make
my movie

1807
01:18:56,836 --> 01:18:58,397
"because it's
so important."

1808
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,741
This is neither
the time nor the place

1809
01:19:00,841 --> 01:19:02,401
to do an impression
of Chris Nolan.

1810
01:19:02,503 --> 01:19:04,608
I'm doing
an impression
of you, Randal.

1811
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:06,041
We're in
the hospital.

1812
01:19:06,145 --> 01:19:08,111
That's stating
the obvious.
No.

1813
01:19:08,212 --> 01:19:10,383
The obvious statement
right now would be,

1814
01:19:10,486 --> 01:19:11,785
"Never mind the movie,

1815
01:19:11,886 --> 01:19:13,315
"my best friend's
in the hospital."

1816
01:19:13,417 --> 01:19:17,393
It's just a heart attack.
I had one. He'll be fine.

1817
01:19:17,495 --> 01:19:19,490
Fuck you, Randal.

1818
01:19:19,591 --> 01:19:20,823
Fuck you.

1819
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,695
Come on.
God, man.

1820
01:19:22,796 --> 01:19:24,796
I used to look up
to you so much

1821
01:19:24,898 --> 01:19:27,094
but you're the worst,
you know that?

1822
01:19:27,196 --> 01:19:28,667
The worst
in the world.

1823
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:31,834
Mr. Dante made
your movie happen.

1824
01:19:31,937 --> 01:19:34,068
I made my
movie happen.

1825
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:36,641
I had the idea
to make the movie.

1826
01:19:36,743 --> 01:19:37,940
I wrote the script

1827
01:19:38,042 --> 01:19:39,811
and I'm the
goddamn director.

1828
01:19:39,913 --> 01:19:41,709
I made this
movie happen.

1829
01:19:41,812 --> 01:19:43,311
It was all me.

1830
01:19:43,413 --> 01:19:46,353
Oh, it was
all you, huh?
Yeah.

1831
01:19:46,455 --> 01:19:47,582
Okay.

1832
01:19:48,856 --> 01:19:51,023
Take off your stupid
mask, Randal.

1833
01:19:51,657 --> 01:19:53,256
Yeah.

1834
01:19:53,358 --> 01:19:55,588
Because I remember
Mr. Dante
doing everything.

1835
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:59,535
He even called
his ex-fiancee
who hates his guts.

1836
01:19:59,636 --> 01:20:02,201
He put up his half
of QuickStop

1837
01:20:02,301 --> 01:20:05,271
just to get you
the money to make
your stupid movie.

1838
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,742
Wait a minute.

1839
01:20:06,842 --> 01:20:08,908
Dante got the money
for my movie from Emma?

1840
01:20:09,008 --> 01:20:10,579
Code Blue. ER 7.

1841
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:12,408
Dante, I didn't know
about Emma.

1842
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:13,945
I just found out.
You again?
What did I say?

1843
01:20:14,046 --> 01:20:15,142
I didn't know.
What did I say, huh?

1844
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,518
Security!
Is he okay?

1845
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:17,815
Get out of here,
man. Get out!

1846
01:20:17,917 --> 01:20:20,488
Is he okay?
Get out! Security!

1847
01:20:20,589 --> 01:20:22,518
All right.
Get off of me!

1848
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:25,728

I need your help
with Dante.

1875

Who's Dante?

1876
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:16,500
The fuck do
you mean? Dante.

1877
01:22:16,602 --> 01:22:19,839
The other guy,
the guy in the QuickStop
who's not me?

1878
01:22:19,941 --> 01:22:21,501
Wait, I thought
his name was Sergio.

1879
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:24,645
Ain't his name Sergio?
It's fucking Dante.

1880
01:22:24,749 --> 01:22:26,747
Are you gonna
help me or not?

1881
01:22:26,849 --> 01:22:29,249
Anything for
our boy Sergio.

1882
01:22:29,351 --> 01:22:32,583
I need to sneak
into the hospital
to get to Sergio,

1883
01:22:32,685 --> 01:22:36,920
so I want you guys
to create a very

in heaven.

01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:22,168
And because
Mr. Dante

1953
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:24,700
was the best person
that I ever knew,

1954
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,737

he's in heaven
right now,

01:28:39,215 --> 01:28:40,420
Si.

1960
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:01,001
Grazie,  Elias.

1961
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:08,776
I, uh...

1962
01:29:08,879 --> 01:29:12,315
I thought a lot about
what to say here today.

1963
01:29:12,418 --> 01:29:13,814
I was gonna pull
from the eulogy

1964
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:17,392
that Kirk gave Spock
in The Wrath of Khan,

1965
01:29:17,494 --> 01:29:19,390
but I've always
been more of
a Star Wars  fan

1966
01:29:19,493 --> 01:29:21,727
so I should say
something like,

1967
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:25,895
"May the Force be with you"
or "This is the Way."

1968
01:29:27,062 --> 01:29:28,729
But I think instead
of quoting a movie,

1969
01:29:28,833 --> 01:29:31,702
I'd like to paraphrase
the departed.

1970
01:29:31,803 --> 01:29:33,935
And by the departed,
I mean Dante Hicks,

1971
01:29:34,038 --> 01:29:36,708
not the Scorsese picture
that was pretty perfect

1972
01:29:36,812 --> 01:29:39,678
right up until that
stupid shot of the rat
at the end.

1973
01:29:42,117 --> 01:29:44,684
So in the words...

1974
01:29:44,786 --> 01:29:46,981

I ever knew...

1975
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,257

even supposed

01:30:16,847 --> 01:30:19,847
and assume your
new position.

1982
01:30:19,949 --> 01:30:21,814
But this was
Mr. Dante's spot.

1983
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:23,653
Yeah, well,
after all this time

1984
01:30:23,754 --> 01:30:26,421
of being my biggest
and only fanboy,

1985
01:30:26,523 --> 01:30:28,254
I'd say you
earned it.

1986
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:30,095
Besides, I told you
way back when
we worked at Mooby's

1987
01:30:30,198 --> 01:30:31,431
when Dante is gone,

1988
01:30:31,533 --> 01:30:33,062
you're gonna be
my new best friend.

1989
01:30:34,232 --> 01:30:35,700
No, I'm not.

else am I gonna

me, buddy.

1992
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:42,836
Oh, fuck.

1993
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:45,938
Well, look who it is,
Mr. Big Shit.

1994
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:49,282
Well, look who it is,
Mrs. Big Clit.

1995
01:30:49,383 --> 01:30:51,782
Classy. How am
I not surprised?

1996
01:30:51,882 --> 01:30:54,153
I was surprised
to see you
at the cemetery.

1997
01:30:54,254 --> 01:30:55,954
You flew up
for Dante?

1998
01:30:56,056 --> 01:30:59,724
Well, I did almost
marry the man,
and if I had... P.S.

1999
01:30:59,826 --> 01:31:01,521
He wouldn't have died
of a heart attack

2000
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:03,057
before he was 50.

2001
01:31:03,159 --> 01:31:05,430
Yeah, because
after a year
with you,

2002
01:31:05,532 --> 01:31:06,829
he'd have
killed himself.

2003
01:31:06,931 --> 01:31:09,871
I think I heard
you had a heart attack.

2004
01:31:09,973 --> 01:31:11,100
Am I right?

2005
01:31:12,573 --> 01:31:14,637
That must really
fuck with you.

2006
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:18,708
Dante's dead but
you're still here.

2007
01:31:18,812 --> 01:31:20,708
I guess it's true
what they say, Randal.

2008
01:31:20,811 --> 01:31:24,284
Only the good
die young.

2009
01:31:24,386 --> 01:31:25,812
To what do
I owe the pleasure

2010
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:28,749
of your entirely
unwelcome visit?

2011
01:31:28,851 --> 01:31:32,660
I loaned Dante
30 grand

2012
01:31:32,761 --> 01:31:37,193
and he put his half
of the store up
as collateral.

2013
01:31:37,295 --> 01:31:39,029
Now he's gone.

2014
01:31:39,130 --> 01:31:43,101
And if you can't
pay me back,
I own half this shithole.

2015
01:31:45,937 --> 01:31:48,207
How big's
my clit now,
motherfucker?

2032
01:32:21,404 --> 01:32:22,901
So?

2033
01:32:23,003 --> 01:32:24,441
The two of us

flex and buy sex.

Shit.

money, Big E?

2040
01:32:37,925 --> 01:32:40,625
I'll never be able

Here's your sucking

Oh!

out of our store!

2044
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:50,737
Well played, clerks.

- Sorry about
the mess.

2046
01:32:53,035 --> 01:32:55,937
That was from
Star Wars.

2047
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:57,809
I only said it
'cause you
and Mr. Dante

2048
01:32:57,911 --> 01:32:59,948

I know.

Yes! I wanna buy

Here's ten grand.

2055

Whoo! That's gonna
get you higher

Hey, kids!
It's me, Kevin Smith,

2100
01:36:52,412 --> 01:36:55,410
and I can't thank you enough
for making this third trip

2101
01:36:55,511 --> 01:36:58,750
to the convenience store
with me. Thank you.

2102
01:36:58,854 --> 01:37:01,054
Um... This time's
exciting for me

2103
01:37:01,157 --> 01:37:03,350
because this time everyone
finally gets to see  Clerks

2104
01:37:03,452 --> 01:37:05,290
the way I've always
seen Clerks.

2105
01:37:05,392 --> 01:37:07,588
Most people think that Clerks
is a black and white movie

2106
01:37:07,690 --> 01:37:09,895
and they're right.
It was shot on black
and white film.

2107
01:37:09,998 --> 01:37:12,962
But, to me,
whenever I watch Clerks,

2108
01:37:13,064 --> 01:37:14,161
even though
it's in black and white,

2109
01:37:14,262 --> 01:37:15,866
the movie appears in color.

2110
01:37:15,966 --> 01:37:17,196
Because I lived that life.

2111
01:37:17,298 --> 01:37:19,237
And so now, thanks to Lee Ron,

2112
01:37:19,338 --> 01:37:23,171
you're all seein' QuickStop
and the surrounding area,

2113
01:37:23,273 --> 01:37:25,208
uh, Dante, Randal,
Jay and Silent Bob

2114
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:28,646
as I've always seen them
from day one.

2115
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:31,017
Um, in vivid, living color.

2116
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:36,350
Uh, you know, QuickStop
is the unsung, uh, star

2117
01:37:36,452 --> 01:37:38,624
of all the Clerks movies,
if not,

2118
01:37:38,726 --> 01:37:40,157
you know, the epicenter

2119
01:37:40,258 --> 01:37:42,496
of the View Askewniverse
films in general.

2120
01:37:42,597 --> 01:37:44,257
Um, all stories emanate

2121
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:47,601
and flow from that
little building.

2122
01:37:47,703 --> 01:37:50,937
And when I worked there...

2123
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,465
um, I hated it.
I didn't want to be there.

2124
01:37:53,568 --> 01:37:54,970
I didn't wanna work
for somebody else

2125
01:37:55,074 --> 01:37:56,508
and I didn't wanna work there.

2126
01:37:56,611 --> 01:37:58,676
And people would come in

2127
01:37:58,780 --> 01:38:00,273
and I'd be like, "Oh, my God,

2128
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:02,142
"I have to actually
wait on people?

2129
01:38:02,244 --> 01:38:04,049
"I just wanna watch TV."

2130
01:38:04,152 --> 01:38:05,751
I didn't even wanna work
at the convenience store.

2131
01:38:05,854 --> 01:38:07,282
I tried to get a job
at RST Video.

2132
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:09,053
There was an ad
in the paper for it.

2133
01:38:09,155 --> 01:38:10,791
I went down
and talked to Mr. Topper.

2134
01:38:10,893 --> 01:38:12,354
He said... He goes,
"I see you have

2135
01:38:12,456 --> 01:38:14,458
"convenience store
experience as well."

2136
01:38:14,562 --> 01:38:16,292
I said, "Yeah,
I worked in a bunch
of convenience stores."

2137
01:38:16,395 --> 01:38:18,028
And he goes,
"Would you be
willing to work

2138
01:38:18,129 --> 01:38:19,966
"in this convenience
store next door

2139
01:38:20,069 --> 01:38:21,626
"from time to time because
we own that as well?"

2140
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:23,430
And I was like, "Uh, yeah,
if you need help."

2141
01:38:23,534 --> 01:38:25,068
And, uh, famous last
words because it...

2142
01:38:25,169 --> 01:38:26,641
it was a convenience
store job.

2143
01:38:26,743 --> 01:38:28,539
He catfished me.
I just wound up

2144
01:38:28,641 --> 01:38:30,337
working in a convenience store
with a couple of hours in...

2145
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:33,045
in a video store,
teased with paradise,

2146
01:38:33,147 --> 01:38:36,979
then seduced and abandoned
to sell, uh, goods.

2147
01:38:37,083 --> 01:38:39,620
So in  Clerks, Randal says,

2148
01:38:39,722 --> 01:38:41,119
"Man, this job would be great

2149
01:38:41,221 --> 01:38:42,988
"if it wasn't for
the fuckin' customers."

2150
01:38:43,089 --> 01:38:45,487
Uh, but in the script
for  Clerks III,

2151
01:38:45,588 --> 01:38:47,289
I'm gonna read you a little
something that was there

2152
01:38:47,391 --> 01:38:48,727
that I didn't use
in the movie.

2153
01:38:48,829 --> 01:38:50,392
During the pullback shot

2154
01:38:50,494 --> 01:38:52,227
at the very end,
you hear John Gorka's

2155
01:38:52,329 --> 01:38:53,929
beautiful
I'm From New Jersey.

2156
01:38:54,032 --> 01:38:55,461
And it was so lovely,

2157
01:38:55,564 --> 01:38:58,071
I left that moment alone
and didn't put in

2158
01:38:58,172 --> 01:39:00,471
what in the script called
for, the voice of Smod.

2159
01:39:00,575 --> 01:39:03,943
That would be me.
And this is what you
would have heard.

2160
01:39:04,045 --> 01:39:06,075
"Randal Graves spent
the rest of his life

2161
01:39:06,175 --> 01:39:07,813

01:39:07,916 --> 01:39:09,375

01:39:24,132 --> 01:39:26,727
"as well as their appetite

debut, Clerk.

2171

"The 90-year-old
Randal Graves replied,

2172
01:39:33,438 --> 01:39:35,172
"'I always thought that jobs
would have been great

2173
01:39:35,274 --> 01:39:37,236
"'if it weren't for

2174

01:39:39,448 --> 01:39:42,479
"'these jobs are great because

2176
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:45,277
He means it and so do I.

2177
01:39:45,378 --> 01:39:47,152
Thank you to everybody

2178
01:39:47,253 --> 01:39:48,653
whoever walked through
the door of that store

2179
01:39:48,754 --> 01:39:50,354
and made me think,

2180
01:39:50,457 --> 01:39:52,725
"Somebody should put this
in a fuckin' movie."

2181
01:39:52,827 --> 01:39:55,492
Somebody did. Thank you.

2182
01:39:56,563 --> 01:39:58,561
-  Yeah!
