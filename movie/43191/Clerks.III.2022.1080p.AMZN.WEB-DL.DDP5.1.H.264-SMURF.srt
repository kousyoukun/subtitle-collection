你已经36岁了
You're 36-years-old.

而不是无缘无故
And not for nothing,

152
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,213
但如果我不是向你们的基督教上帝祈祷
but how's it taking
the Lord's name in vain

153
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,131
如何妄称主的名呢？
if I don't pray
to your Christian God?

154
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,467
如果你不向上帝祈祷 那么你向谁祈祷？
If you don't pray to God,
then who do you pray to?

155
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,595
当我处于最低谷时 我总是向克罗姆祈祷
When I'm at my lowest,
I always pray to Crom.

156
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,679
谁是克罗姆？
Who's Crom?

-那是《野蛮人柯南》里的神
-你知道吗 兰德尔？

Come on, man,
give Crom a chance.

他虽然不比耶稣
He may not be all woke
and shit like Jesus,

165
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,114
但对于神来说他很酷的

166
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,117
好吧 兰德尔 你在开玩笑吧
因为只有一位上帝
Well, joke's on you,
Randal, because
there's only one God.

Yeah. What about Thor?
Thor's a god.

that makes them both

”如果你真的是上帝的儿子”

”耶稣没有做错 而我们不过是贼”

00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,028
拉登海姆医生 今晚我会是你的救星
Dr. Ladenheim, I'll be
your savior this evening.

282
00:12:57,384 --> 00:13:00,550
(CACKLING)

283
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,699
什么鬼？
What in the fuck?

284
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,201
我为我的衣着向你道歉
I apologize
for my wardrobe.

285
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,911
我刚参加了一个变装舞会
I just came from
a costume ball.

286
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,955
听着 医生 我没事 我只是
Listen, Doc,
I'm okay. I just...

287
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,249
我只是喘不上气 仅此而已
I can't catch
my breath is all.

288
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,960
按从1到10级来算 你觉得有多疼？
On a scale
of one to ten,
how bad would you say
your pain level is?

289
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,044
我的疼痛程度？
RANDAL:
My pain level?

290
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,546
大概像负三
Like a negative three.

291
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,005
好吧 你错了
Well, you're
doing it
all wrong.

292
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:19,258
当你心脏病发作时 应该会很痛苦
You're supposed to be
in a lot of pain
when you have
a heart attack.

293
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,802
等一下 我心脏病发作了？
Wait a minute.
I had a heart attack?

294
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,804
不 不是的 你误会了
No, that's not
what I said.

295
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:24,888
谢天谢地
You misunderstood me.
Oh, thank Christ.
You're having
a heart attack

296
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,808
我们说话的时候你心脏病发作了
right now
as we speak,

297
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,352
很严重 所以我们必须迅速采取行动
a massive one,
so we have to act
pretty quickly.

298
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,437
我只是希望我没有那么醉
I just wish
I wasn't
so hung over.

299
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:34,048

I'm kidding.

300
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,648
我在开玩笑
I'm gonna go
get all glammed up

301
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,483
我要去为我们的约会

302
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,151
打扮得漂漂亮亮的 然后在手术室见
for our big date
and I'll see you
in the OR.

303
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,403
看着我
Look at me.
Uh-huh.

304
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,363
一切都会好起来的 好吗？
Everything's gonna
be fine, all right?

305
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,574
-好的 好吧
-他快不行了
Good. All right.
He's not
gonna make it.

306
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,285
天哪 有人可以呼叫好女巫吗？
Jesus, could someone
page the Good Witch?

307
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,370
接下来是什么 一个他妈的芒奇金？
What's next,
a fucking Munchkin?

308
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:54,751
刮胡子和理发 25美分
(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
Shave and a haircut
two bits.

309
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:53,973
Shave and a haircut
two bits.

310
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,713
你已经见过拉登海姆医生了
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
I see that you met
Dr. Ladenheim.

311
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:01,758
她要我为你做手术准备
And she wants me to
prep you for surgery.

312
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,137
手术？不 医生刚刚说我只是去手术室
Surgery? No.
The doctor just said
I'm going to the OR.

313
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:10,434
对啊 就是他们做手术的地方！
Right! Which is short
for operating room

314
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:09,885
where they do...
Ding, ding, ding,
surgery!

315
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,019
她要打开你的心脏
She gotta get
into your heart.

316
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,229
医生会打开他的胸吗？
Uh, is the doctor
gonna crack
his chest open?

317
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,397
-操
-不
Fuck.
No, no, no.

318
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,566
她会通过一个很小的切口将相机
She's gonna thread
a camera through
his femoral artery

319
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,569
穿过他的股动脉到达心脏
up to his ticker
through a very
small incision.

320
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,487
她在哪里做这个切口？
Where does
she make this incision?

321
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,572
在腹股沟
In the groin.
The groin?
Come on.

322
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,490
-腹股沟？
-不是吧

323
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,117
所以我要给你刮毛
So I gotta shave you.
(ELECTRIC SHAVER BUZZING)

324
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,036
或者我给你刮胡子
Or I get
to shave you,

325
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,788
取决于你有多爱你的工作 而我爱我的工作
depending on how much
you love your job
and I love mine.

326
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,752
所以 正如妻子每个星期晚上10点
看完《犯罪故事》以后 所说的那样
So, as the wife
says at 10:00 p.m.
after Dateline,

327
00:14:34,944 --> 00:14:36,345
every single week,

328
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,296

I gotta shave
your groin, sir,
so underwear too.

332
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,394
首先 我们可以建立起位置吗？
First, can we
establish geography?

333
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,146
比如 你觉得腹股沟在哪里？
Like, where is
the groin to you?

334
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,565
我觉得腹股沟在哪里？
Where's the groin
to me?

335
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,776
这是什么 一个形而上学的问题？
What is this,
a metaphysical question?

336
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,363
救你一命的时间不多了 所以来吧 快点

你能不能看向别处 堵住你的耳朵

Can you avert
your eyes,

340
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,179

Oh, for God sakes.

want me to sing?

410
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,912
像现在这样100%的遮挡？
when there's 100%
occlusion like what
you have now?

411
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,874
老实说 病人总是死去 总是
Hands down,
patient always
dies, always.

412
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,083
他妈的
Oh, fuck.

413
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,377
但别担心 你会是那20%
But don't worry,
you're gonna
be in the 20%

414
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,838
因为让你活着对我的名誉有好处
because keeping
you alive is good
for my brand.

415
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,506
现在 如果你不介意的话
Now, if you
excuse me,

416
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,800
我要在你的裤裆里
I'm gonna go fool around
in your little crotch

417
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,510
做一个小魔术
and I'm gonna make
a little magic,

418
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,762
但我可以利用我们能得到的所有帮助
but I could use
all the help
that we can get.

419
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,640
所以 如果你还记得小时候的任何祈祷词
So, if you remember
any prayers

420
00:18:16,937 --> 00:18:18,533
from when you
were a kid,

421
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:21,143
现在用上它们的好时机
now would be
a terrific time
to dust those off.

422
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:21,871
(RANDAL GROANS SOFTLY)

423
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:23,937
你在吗 克罗姆？
Are you there, Crom?

424
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,273
是我 兰德尔
It's me, Randal.

425
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,775
请不要让我死
(ECHOES SLIGHTLY)
Please don't let me die.

426
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,613
他不会回答我的
He won't answer me.

427
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,491
毕竟这段时间
After all this time...

428
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,369
把我的生命献给上帝
devoting my life
to God.

429
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:43,165
耶稣抛弃了我们快速停止的所有人
Jesus has abandoned
all of us at QuickStop.

430
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,752
我认为耶稣一直更像是哇哇餐厅的人
I think Jesus
was always more
of a Wawa guy.

431
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:49,895
(SIGHS) Yeah, well,
you know what I think?

432
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,464
是的 好吧 你知道我的想法吗？

433
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,135
我想我这辈子都浪费在了相信这些垃圾上
I think I wasted
my life believing
in bullshit.

434
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:56,470
我被骗了
I've been conned.

435
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,639
童话 信仰和
Fairy tales, faith
and pledging fealty

436
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:03,101
向一个虚构的该死的幻影宣誓效忠 为了什么？
to a fictional
fucking phantom.
And for what?

437
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:08,232
在我最需要他的最黑暗时刻
主完全使我成为鬼魂
In my darkest hour
when I need him most,

438
00:19:05,414 --> 00:19:08,188
the Lord totally
ghosts me.

439
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:14,112
见鬼去吧 那些瞎编的关于耶稣的谎言
Well, to hell
with all that
made up Jesus jive.

440

(NECKLACE CLATTERS)

(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Save Randal
this night,

442
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,493
今晚拯救兰德尔的话

443
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,496
我向你发誓
and I will swear
my soul to you,

444
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,374
可爱的撒旦
oh, sweet Satan.

445
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,334
撒旦？伙计 不行啊
Satan? Oh,
buddy, no.

446
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,796
我的意思是 他是不是有点邪恶的擎天柱？
I mean, isn't he kind
of like the Optimus
Prime of evil?

447
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,923
你不必对我屈尊俯就
You don't have to
condescend to me.

448
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,508
你可以说是威震天
You can just
say Megatron.

449
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,261
我有点像《变形金刚》里的处男
I'm kind of
a Transformers virgin.

450
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,137
这个嘛
(SIGHS) Well,

451
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,431
我是一个真正的处男
I'm an actual
virgin,

452
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,184
所以我知道撒旦会想要我的灵魂
so I know Satan's
gonna want my soul.

453
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,562
-为了什么？
-邪恶
For what?
Evil.

454
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,357
可能还有性爱吧
And butt
sex probably.

455
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,778
-你有润滑油吗？
-你能安静点吗？
Do you have any lube?
Are you...

456
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,321
不！
No!

457
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,448
我不值得用润滑！
(LOUDLY) I don't
deserve lube!

带我走吧 撒旦！
Take me, Satan!

459

天啊！把裤子穿好
Jesus! Pull up
your pants.

-让我做你的妾！
-耶稣啊
Make me
your concubine!

-把裤子穿好
-不 停下来
Pull up your pants.
No, stop it.
I have
to fuck Satan.

462
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,707
我必须操撒旦

00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,918
就在那时 我不骗你
And that's when,

卢克他妈的天行者出现了

shows up.

DR. LADENHEIM: Uh-huh.
And I'm talking about

466
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:18,218
我说的是《绝地归来》中年轻 可恶的卢克
the young, fuckable Luke
from Return of the Jedi,

467
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:22,139
不是《最后的绝地武士》中的大都灵
“离开我的草坪”卢克
not the Gran Torino,
"Get off my lawn"

468
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:22,995
Luke from The Last Jedi.
DR. LADENHEIM: Okay.

00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,473
好的

473
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:30,981
是《曼达洛人》 第二季
The Mandalorian,
season two.

474
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:34,359
我能够将支架固定到位
所以我现在需要你的帮助
...I was able to get
the stent in place.

475
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:33,932
So this is where
I need your help now.

476
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:36,695
我要打开这个支架 然后你要做的是
I'm gonna open this stent
and all you have to do

477
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,573
当你感到压力减轻时告诉我 好的？
is tell me
when you feel
the pressure lets up.
All right?

478
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,450
我们这样做吧 麦克德雷米
Let's do this, McDreamy.

“这就是道”
"This is The Way."

通往什么的道？
The way to what?

481
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,997
哦 这是《曼达洛人》的说法
Oh, that's a saying
from The Mandalorian.

482
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:49,319

《星球大战秀》

484
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,460
好 听着 我们得暂停
Okay, listen,
we need to hit pause

485
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,337
你对所有流行文化的讨论
on all your pop culture
references for a minute

486
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,048
直到我们打开支架为止 我数到三
just until we open
the stent on three.

487
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,675
一 二 三！
One, two, three!
(GASPING)

488
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:00,165
Oh!

489
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:04,348
天哪 我他妈的又能呼吸了
Holy shit, I can
fucking breathe again.

490
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:06,683
这是否意味着我能活了？
Does this mean
I'm gonna live now?

491
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,852
是的 因为我是一位了不起的医生
Yes, because
I'm an amazing doctor.

492
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:13,857
你是一个比奇异博士和扎伊斯博士
加起来还更好的医生
You're a better doctor
than Doctor Strange

493
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,309
and Doctor Zaius
combined.
Doctor who?

494
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:14,942
什么博士？
Oh, no, I don't
watch that show,

495
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,818
不 我没看过

496
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:21,323
但我现在可以看了 因为我他妈的还活着
but I might start now
because I'm fucking alive.

497
00:21:20,215 --> 00:21:21,516
(LAUGHS)

498
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,867
“恭喜了！”正如中国人所说的
"Mazel tov!"
As the Chinese say.

499
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:25,577
谢谢你 医生
Thank you, Doctor.

500
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,996
谢谢你救了我一命
Thank you for
saving my life.

501
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,499
你就像心脏手术的蝙蝠侠
You're like the Batman
of heart surgery.
(CHUCKLES)

502
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,000
是嘛？
Yeah?

503
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,962
拥有权利的同时也被赋予了重大的责任
(SPEAKING GRUFFLY)
With great power
comes great
responsibility.

504
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,672
那是什么鬼？
What the fuck
was that?

505
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,135
-你还活着
You're alive!
DANTE: You're alive!

506
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,638
-你还好吗？
-如果那是心脏病发作
Are you okay?
If that was
a heart attack,

507
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,307
我能再来一次 简直太容易了
I'll take another one.
That shit was easy.
(CHUCKLES)

508
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,519
好吧 你现在肯定是麻药还没醒
Okay, you must be
on a lot of drugs
right now.

509
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,563
不 他们没有给我任何东西
No, they didn't
give me
nothing in there.

510
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,273
我必须清醒地经历整个手术
I had to do
the whole
thing sober.

511
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:57,025
他对芬太尼兴奋不已
He's high as a kite
on fentanyl.

512
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,403
风筝意象 很酷
Kite imagery,
very cool.

513
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:02,030
看 兰德尔 风筝在空中呢
See, Randal,
kites are in the air.

514
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,116
别再说你妈的风筝了
Stop with the
fucking kites.

515
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,034
还有一件事 格雷夫斯先生
DR. LADENHEIM:
One more thing,
Mr. Graves,
since you were really
preoccupied about it,

516
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:08,537
既然你真的那么在意

517
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,499
以至于你浪费了时间 还差点死掉
so much so that
you wasted time
and nearly died,

518
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,960
你的鸡巴其实没那么小
your penis is not
that small.

519
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,212
它没有那么大 但也没有那么小
It's not that big,
but it's not that small.

520
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,339
(CHUCKLES)
That's the best
news I heard all day.

521
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,923
这是我一整天听到的最好的消息

522
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:20,743
(CHUCKLING WEAKLY)

523
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:25,971
他会没事的吧？
DANTE: Is he gonna
be okay?

524
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,097
我该如何帮助他？
How do I help?

525
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:30,601
好 如果你在乎他的话 你要让他多吃蔬菜
Well, if you care
about him,

526
00:22:28,454 --> 00:22:30,215
you'll jam a vegetable
down his throat.

527
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,437
这家伙动脉中的胆固醇比血液还多
The guy's got more
cholesterol in his
arteries than blood.

528
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,023
知道了 从今以后 我只给他点
Got it. From now on,
I'm only gonna
order him food

529
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,566
菜单上的素食
off the vegan
menu at Mooby's.

530
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,318
-他和你
-我吗？
Him and you.
Me?

531
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:42,487
如果你和他的年纪差不多
并且和你的朋友有同样的饮食习惯
If you're around
his age
and eat the same diet
as your friend,

532
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:44,573
那你最好也检查一下你的心脏
you might wanna get
your heart checked out, too.

533
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:45,908
会的
Will do.

534
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:49,578
但还有一些关于兰德尔的事情我想让你留意
But here's something
I want you to keep

535
00:22:47,374 --> 00:22:49,136
an eye out for
as regards to Randal.

536
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:50,704
好的
Okay.

537
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,373
中年男性往往在他们心脏病发作之后
Middle-aged men tend to
go through a depression

538
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:54,666
会经历抑郁症
after they've had
a heart attack.

539
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,294
现在你的朋友的言行举止可能会有所不同
Now your friend might
sound or act differently
now because

540
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,755
因为他已经面对过自己的死亡
he's come face to face

所以 在接下来的几个月里 尽你所能
So, for the next
few months,

542
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,717
do whatever
you can do

543
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:07,429
帮助兰德尔振作起精神
to help Randal
keep his spirits up.

544
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:08,805
好吗？
All right?

545
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,641
现在 我要去忙了
Now, my bill
is in the mail.

我给你带了一顶帽子
I brought you a hat.

553
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:36,333
是嘛 谢谢
Yeah. Thanks.

554
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,712
我不敢相信在你经历了这一切后还醒着
I can't believe
you're still awake

555
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,387
after the day
you've been through.

是的 我睡不着
Yeah, I can't sleep.

今晚我能活着出手术室的几率
There was only
a 20% chance

558
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:49,680
只有20%
I was gonna make it out
of that OR alive tonight.

Hmm. Is that right?

560
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:51,890
真的吗？

561
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:56,812
我的意思是 我觉得我每次离开公寓
都有一半的几率会死
I mean, I figure I got
a 50-50 chance of dying

562
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:56,641

there was an 80% chance

有80%的机会
There was an 80% chance

00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,951
你和我再也不能谈论《星球大战》了
you and I were never
gonna talk about
Star Wars  again.

There was
an 80% chance

569
00:24:13,427 --> 00:24:15,060
I would never know
for a medical fact,

570
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,207
那就是我有一个正常大小的鸡巴
I got a normal-sized dick.

it was huge.

你救了我的命 伙计

my life, man.

(CLICKS TONGUE) Oh.

00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,471
我希望我有一个值得他妈的被拯救的生命

worth fucking saving.

576
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:32,764
别这样 伙计
DANTE:
Come on, man.

577
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:34,266
你在说什么？
What are you
talking about?

578
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,686
当我躺在那里 想着我是否会死去
When I was lying there,

579
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,683
wondering if
I was gonna die,

580
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:42,858
我在眼前看到了我整个人生电影
I saw the whole
movie of my life
flash before my eyes.

00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:45,569
你知道吗？
You know what?

582
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:47,905
它糟透了
It sucked. (SCOFFS)

583
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,826
我一直在想 也希望
I always thought,
hoped...

584
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:56,163
我的生活朝着某种方向发展
that my life
was building
towards something.

585
00:24:57,873 --> 00:24:59,708
原来就只是在医院
Turns out it was
just the hospital.

586
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,168
你在说什么？
What are you
talking about?

587
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:02,961
我们建立了自己的生意
We built our
own business.

588
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:06,131
所以我能共同拥有一家便利店 很了不起
So I co-own
a convenience
store. Big deal.

589
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:08,884
我从来没有去过泽西城以外的任何地方
I never went anywhere
outside of Jersey.

590
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,136
我从来没有像你一样坠入爱河
I never fell
in love like you.

591
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,804
如果今晚我就死了
If I'd have
dropped dead tonight,

592
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:15,849
只有你和埃利亚斯会记得我曾经存在过
only you and Elias would
remember I even existed.

593
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:19,436
我的意思是 看看我 伙计 我快50岁了
I mean, look
at me, man,
I'm almost 50.

594
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:23,774
我坐在那里一遍又一遍地看同样愚蠢的电影
I sit around
and watch the same

595
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:23,288
stupid movies
over and over.

597
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:27,694
我他妈怎么了？
The fuck is
wrong with me?

598
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:29,613
我不知道
I don't know.

599
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,449
你对所有的东西都很了解
You know so much
about all that stuff.

600
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,743
我一直认为你可以拍一部很酷的电影
I always thought you could
have made a cool movie.

601
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,877
天啊
Holy shit.

602
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,879
你说得没错
You're right.

603
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,802
我可以拍一部很酷的电影
I could make
a pretty cool movie.

604
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:54,304
我这一辈子都在看电影
I've been
watching movies
all my life,

605
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:56,515
我见过所有这些人讲述他们的故事
I've seen all
these people
tell their stories

606
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,976
从来没有想过要讲述我自己的
and never once
thought about
trying to tell mine.

607
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,602
好吧 去他妈的 伙计
Well, fuck
that, man.

608
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:04,565
既然我今晚差点死去
现在我知道我是靠借来的时间生活的
Since I almost
died tonight,

609
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:04,335
now I know I'm living
on borrowed time.

610
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:06,692
所以 不要再看电影了
So, no more
watching movies

611
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,610
因为当我离开这里后
because when
I get out of here...

612
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,656
我要拍电影！
I'm gonna make
a movie!

613
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:14,075
(MACHINE BEEPING)

614
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,205
电影？
DANTE: A movie?

615
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:22,249
你不需要去电影学校什么的吗？
Don't you have to go to
film school or something?

616
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:26,044
去纽约大学电影学院一年要七万五美元
It's like 75 G's a year
to go to NYU Film School.

617
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:28,589
你知道那些孩子花那么多钱是为了什么吗？
And you know what
those kids pay
all that money for?

618
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,966
-我不知道
-去看电影
I don't know.
To watch movies.

619
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:33,886
我在影像店工作了20年
I worked in a video
store for 20 years

620
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:36,388
我也整天坐在那儿看电影
where I sat around
and watched
movies all day, too.

621
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:39,683
所以也能说是我去了我自己的电影学校
So basically,
I went to my own
film school.

622
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:42,811
就因为你看过每一部电影
Just because you've seen
every movie ever made,

623
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:45,314
并不意味着你可以制作任何类型的电影
doesn't mean you can make
any kind of movie at all.

624
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,274
这话去跟昆汀塔伦蒂诺说吧
(SCOFFS) Tell that
to Quentin Tarantino.

625
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,401
哦 现在你是昆汀塔伦蒂诺？
Oh, now you're
Quentin Tarantino?

626
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:52,446
我不是说我要拍一部跟他一样好的电影
I'm not saying
I'm gonna make
a movie as good as him,

627
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:54,031
但我也不擅长做爱
but I'm not good
at sex either,

628
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,366
这并不能阻止我尝试跟别人上床
and that doesn't stop me
from trying to get laid.

629
00:26:56,188 --> 00:26:57,184
(SCOFFS)

630
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,626
我向你保证 他还活着！

631
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,252
你想在这里拍电影吗？
DANTE: You wanna
shoot a movie here,

632
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:08,587
在快速停止？
at the QuickStop?

633
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,131
是的 我以前看过电影里的便利店
Yeah, I've seen
convenience stores
in flicks before,

634
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:14,801
但我从未看过一整部都是在便利店里拍的电影
but I've never seen
an entire flick

635
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:14,132
set in
a convenience store.

636
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:16,637
因为谁会想看呢？
Because who would
wanna watch that?

637
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,805
我的意思是 这是我的人生
我都不想过这样的生活
I mean, it's my life
and I barely
wanna live it.

638
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:21,099
这部电影是为了纪念我的一生
This movie's meant
to memorialize
my life.

639
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:24,102
既然我过去30年都在这里工作...
And since
I spent the last

640
00:27:22,242 --> 00:27:23,576
30 years of my life
working here...

641
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:25,312
工作？
Oh. Working?

642
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:29,483
我有很多便利店的故事可以写成剧本
I got plenty of
convenience stories

643
00:27:27,685 --> 00:27:29,180
to put into
a screenplay.

644
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:31,818
《便利故事》 好标题
Convenience Stories.
Good title.

645
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:35,155
那么 我们要在这里谈论什么样的“便利故事”？
Well, what kind of
convenience stories

646
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:34,625
are we talking
about here?

647
00:27:34,727 --> 00:27:36,322
(LAUGHS)
Remember the time
we went to

648
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,242
记得我们去参加朱莉德怀尔的葬礼
Julie Dwyer's funeral
and you knocked
the casket over?

649
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:39,868
然后你把棺材打翻了？

650
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,662
你把棺材打翻了
You knocked
the casket over.

651
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:43,539
我吗？
I did?
(SIGHS)

652
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:44,998
嗯 这就是现在的场景
Well, that's
a scene now.

653
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:47,376
或者是那个老家伙在浴室里打飞机
Or how about the time
the old guy
was jerking off

654
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,044
然后突然就死掉？
in the bathroom
and dropped dead?

655
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,712
这完全是一个场景 伙计
That's totally
a scene, man.

656
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:53,924
我的意思是 你和我在这个柜台说的所有废话
I mean, all the shit
you and I have said

657
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:53,444
sitting at
this counter,

658
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,634
这些都是场景 伙计
these are all
scenes now, man.

659
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,094
你烧毁商店的那次怎么样？
How about the time
you burned
the store down?

660
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,345
会是这样的场景吗？
Is that gonna
be a scene?

661
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,597
我仍然很确定是恐怖分子干的
I'm still pretty sure
terrorists did that.

662
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:00,885
Uh-huh.

665
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:11,608
你们的基督教加密俱乐部中有任何人
能借我们非加密相机吗？
Anyone in your
Christian Crypto Club

666
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:11,256
got a non-crypto camera
we can borrow?

667
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:13,902
它现在被称为赤红加密俱乐部了
It's called
the Crimson
Crypto Club now.

668
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:16,363

Oh, put that
shit away,
Elon Muskrat.

670
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:21,743
-你们需要相机做什么？
-兰德尔想拍电影
What do you guys
need a camera for?

671
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,737
RANDAL: Mmm.
Randal wants
to make a movie.

672
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,912
色情电影？
Ooh, like
a pornography movie?

673
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:28,000
不 就正经电影 有演员和剧本
No, like
a movie-movie,

674
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,509
one with actors
and a screenplay

675
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,168
和伙食
and Crafty. (LAUGHS)

676
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:31,128
什么是伙食？
What's Crafty?

677
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:32,796
那是所有人一起吃喝玩乐
That's where the,
uh, crew hangs out

678
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,799
和练习巫术的地方 你这个小恶魔崇拜者
and practices
witchcraft,
you little
devil worshipper.

679
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:37,676
酷
Cool.

680
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:40,345
伙食部是在片场能找到所有食物的地方
Crafty is where
you find all
the food on set.

681
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,682
但如果你在这里拍摄
我猜整个店都是伙食部
But if you're
shooting in here,
I guess the whole
store's Crafty.

682
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:45,225
电影是关于什么？
What's the movie
gonna be about?

683
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:48,395
大概一个半小时 我讨厌长电影
Mmm, it's gonna
be about an hour
and a half.

684
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,128
I hate long movies.

685
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:50,314
这是关于他在这里工作的故事
It's about him
working here.
ELIAS: Wow.

686
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,191
多元
Meta. Never seen
a whole movie

687
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:54,818
以前从未看过整部都在便利店的电影
set in
a convenience
store before.

688
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:56,570
是吧？谢谢你
Right? Thank you.

689
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,572
我会把我和但丁这么多年来
I'm gonna fill
the script with
all the weird shit

690
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:01,783
在这里说过或看到的所有奇怪的东西写进剧本
me and Dante
have ever said
or seen around here

691
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:01,978
over the years.
Oh.

692
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,952
你应该把你曾经说过
You should put
in that stuff
you used to say

693
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:05,579
关于死星承包商的东西放进去
about the Death Star
contractors.

694
00:29:05,082 --> 00:29:07,752
(SCOFFS)
Get sued by Disney?
Fuck that.

695
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,290
被迪士尼起诉？去他妈的

696
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:11,126
再说了 我不希望这部电影是关于其他电影的
Besides, I don't want
this movie to be about

697
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:11,920
other movies.
I want it to
be about me.

698
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,503
我希望它是关于我的

699
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:15,506
这是我的电影 所以我想写下我所做的事情
It's my flick,
so I wanna write about

700
00:29:13,757 --> 00:29:15,322
the things that I do.

701
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,300
就像我们在屋顶上打曲棍球一样
Like, um, like how
we play hockey
on the rooftop.

702
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,886
我从未在电影或电视节目中看到过
I've never seen
that done in a movie
or a TV show,

703
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,930
即使这很实用
even though
it's just
fucking practical.

704
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,974
还记得我用面包打你脸的那次吗？
(LAUGHS) Remember
that fight

705
00:29:24,366 --> 00:29:25,602
where I hit you
in the face
with the bread?

706
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:27,184
那可以是一个场景
Ooh, that could
be a scene.

707
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:29,269
或是我向那个老家伙吐水的那次？
Or the time
I spit water
on that old guy?

708
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:31,688
那就是 就像 他妈的开场
That's, like,
the fucking
opening scene.

709
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,232
我有个主意
Ooh, I got an idea.

710
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:35,442
也许杰和沉默的鲍勃可以成为角色
Maybe Jay and
Silent Bob
could be characters.

711
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:37,694
这是我听过的最愚蠢的想法
That is the
dumbest idea
I've ever heard.

712
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:40,572
好吧 如果你想在你的旧影像店设置任何场景
DANTE: Well,
you're still
gonna have

713
00:29:38,983 --> 00:29:40,246
to get them involved
if you wanna set

714
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:42,115
你仍然需要让他们参与进来
any of the scenes
in your old video store.

715
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:44,451
好吧 先记着
All right.
Watch the
register, dawg.

716
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:46,745
我们得去和华纳兄弟谈谈
We got to go talk
to the Warner
Brothers.

717
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:48,664
如果您打算入店偷窃 吃我的鸡巴
What the fuck, man?
We heard you died.

718
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:50,832
什么鬼 伙计？我们听说你死了

719
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:54,670
差点 事实是 我正在高高的草丛中拉屎
Almost.
What happened

720
00:29:52,162 --> 00:29:54,059
is I was taking a shit
in the high grass

721
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:57,756
一条响尾蛇跑过来咬了我的屁眼
when a rattlesnake
came up
and bit me right
on the asshole.

722
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,716
但作为好朋友
But like the good
friend he is,

723
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:01,844
但丁把毒吸了出来
Dante sucked
the poison out.

724
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,263
看？这也发生在他们身上 伙计
See? It happened
to them, too, man.

725
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:07,099
听着 当我们以为你死了的时候 伙计
Well, listen,
when we thought
you were dead, man,

726
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:09,226
我感觉非常非常糟糕
I felt really,
really bad

727
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:10,811
因为一直以来我都在闲逛
'cause in all the time
I've been hanging out

728
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,479
在这家商店面前
in front of this
store and stuff,

729
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,231
我忘了给你点东西
I forgot to give
you something.

730
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:25,117
《牙科学校》？
Dental School?

731
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:28,871
我和菜屌在1994年租了那个东西
Me and Veggie Dick
rented that shit
in 1994,

732
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,205
但我们从未看过
but we never
watched it

733
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:32,124
因为我们没有录像机
'cause we didn't
have a VCR.
(CHUCKLES)

734
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:37,129
但是现在 你可以把它放在影像店的货架上
But now,
you can put it
on the shelf

735
00:30:34,807 --> 00:30:37,072
in the video store.
Oh, yeah.

736
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:40,143
Uh, the video
store closed
ten years ago.

737
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,632
这家店十年前关门了

738
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:43,510
是吗？
It did?

739
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,596
就是这里
This was the
video store.

740
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:54,521
哦 是的 我越来越健忘了
就在那里 你知道吗？
Oh, yeah,
I'm getting senile
and shit right there,
you know? (LAUGHS)

741
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:57,649
那这样 我们欠你多少滞纳金？
So listen,
how much we owe
you for late fees?

742
00:30:57,164 --> 00:31:02,366
(SCOFFS) Uh, well,
let's see, a dollar
a day for what,

743
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:02,696
好吧 让我们看看 一天一美元的话

744
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:06,158
26 28年？
26, 28 years?

745
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:09,494
也就是 大概
That's, like,
approximately...
$10,220.

746
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:12,039
10220美元

747
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,375
他们没有倒带
Oh, didn't rewind.

748
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:19,880
10220.50美元
$10,220 and 50 cents.

749
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,966
你收加密货币吗？
You take crypto?

750
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:25,093
你们有加密货币？
You guys got crypto?

751
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:27,846
没有
No.

752
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,097
如果你没看过
If you never
watched it,

753
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,933
-为什么不倒带？
-对啊
why was it
not rewound?
Yeah.

754
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:33,727
嘿 混蛋 我说了我们没有录像机
Hey, asshole,
I said we didn't
have a VCR.

755
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,811
我们看过
We watched it.
We held it up
to the light.

756
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:36,355
我们把它举到光下

757
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:38,732
蠢货
(CHUCKLES)
Fucking Luddite.

758
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:43,612
听着 如果你让我们在这里拍电影
Listen, we'll squash
your giant late fees

759
00:31:40,335 --> 00:31:43,203
on the 28-year-old copy
of Dental School

760
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:45,405
那滞纳金我们就不要了
if you let us shoot
a movie in here.

761
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:47,658
色情电影？
Ooh, a pornography
movie?

762
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:49,910
不 不是色情电影
No, it's not
a porno movie.

763
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:53,539
那种能卖 兄弟 我一直在买
Sex sells, son,
and I'm always buying

764
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:58,043
因为我是阴蒂指挥官！
'cause I am
the Clit Commander!

765
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,419

那不是场景 兰德尔

现在别写了

(SHOUTING)
Shut the fuck up.
It's nighttime!

780
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:50,888
《便利》？
DANTE: "In Convenience"?

781
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:52,472
这是我一生的故事
It's the story
of my life.

782
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:54,892
168页的鸡巴笑话
Hundred and
sixty-eight pages
full of dick jokes,

783
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:57,561
背景设在便利店 一晚上写的
set in
a convenience store,
written in one night.

784
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,938
也许不要告诉人们最后一部分
Maybe don't
tell people
that last part.

785
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:02,649
我以为 你会称它为《便利故事》
I thought, you were
gonna call it
"Convenience Stories."

786
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,902
是的 这听起来太珍贵了
Yeah, that
shit sounded
too precious.

我是什么 韦斯安德森？
What am I,
Wes Anderson?

788
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:07,779
不是基于这个剧本

嘿
Hmm.
ELIAS: Hey.

792
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,121
那个家伙在餐厅吐的那天你也说了同样的话
You said that
same thing
about return

793
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:16,099
the day that
guy threw up
in Mooby's

794
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:17,748
-你让我把它清理干净
-是的
and you made
me clean it.
RANDAL: Yeah.

795
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:21,001
剧本中的一切都是我或我认识的人所说的
Everything
in the script
is something

796
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:20,364
either me or someone

我只是编了新名字
I just made up
new names.

798
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:23,879
我是什么 某种作家？

是的

Ah, yes.

为什么这两个女孩都喜欢这个叫丹T的角色
why the two girls
are into this
"Dan-T" character

802
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:31,553
但是兰迪角色更有趣
when the Randy
character is
much funnier.

803
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:34,932
兰迪一生都在问自己同样的问题
Randy has been
asking himself

804
00:33:32,853 --> 00:33:34,314
the same question
his whole life.

805
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,558
丹T怎么了？
What's wrong
with Dan-T?

807
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,103
你在开玩笑吧？
DANTE: Are you
kidding me?

808
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:41,438
我比你在便利店里的时间更长
I'm in this
convenience store
way more than you,

809
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:44,858
但是我怎么到了第37页
才出现在你的便利店电影里？
but I don't come
into your

810
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,257
convenience store
movie 'til page 37?

811
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:46,902
我有很多事情要做
I had a lot of
exposition to do.

812
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,070
“丹T上”
(SIGHS) "Enter Dan-T.

813
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:51,031
“一个可怕的他妈的混蛋” 他妈的什么？
"A hideous fuckin'
chud of a man."
What the fuck?

814
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,242
好吧 也许丹T不是你
RANDAL: Well,
maybe Dan-T's not you.

815
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:54,576
你有没有想过？
Do you ever
think of that?

816
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,079
“丹T留着可怕的胡须”
"Dan-T's
hideous fuckin'
chud of a beard

817
00:33:57,162 --> 00:34:00,082
“与其说是托尼斯塔克”
"doesn't suggest Tony
Stark so much as
a male crack whore

818
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:02,000
“不如说是一个扮演托尼斯塔克的疯男人”
"who is cosplaying
as Tony Stark."

819
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:03,919
那只是在剧情方向
That's just
in the screen
direction.

820
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:08,130
没有人当着他的面说
丹T是“一个可怕的混蛋”
Nobody actually
calls Dan-T

821
00:34:05,283 --> 00:34:07,785
"a hideous
fuckin' chud."
To his face.

822
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,176
我不敢相信你让我签署了一份保密协议
I can't believe
you made me
sign a non-disclosure
agreement,

823
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,469
结果却发现我甚至
only to read that
I'm not even

824
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,638
不是你生活故事中的主角之一
one of the main
characters in the
story of your life.

825
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:17,724
我是说 我知道我从来都不是卢克
但我认为我至少是汉
I mean, I knew
I was never the Luke,
but I thought
I was at least
the Han.

826
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:20,518
拜托 我是汉也是卢克 对吧？
Oh, come on,
I'm the Han

827
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:19,995
and the Luke,
right?
(SCOFFS)

828
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,478
那我是谁 小楚？
Then who am I,
the Chewie?

829
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:24,982
我认为埃利亚斯更像是小楚 不是吗？
I think Elias is more
the Chewie, no?

830
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:27,943
除非这是帝国 否则我是兰多 他是洛博特
Unless this is Empire
then I'm the Lando

831
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,870
and he's the Lobot.

832
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:29,610
我甚至连洛博特都不是？
I'm not even
the Lobot?

833
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:30,904
哪个是洛博特？
Which one's Lobot?

834
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,239
他是那个戴着耳机
He's the one with
the headphones
who looks like

835
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:33,739
看起来像是想当DJ的老爹的人
a dad who's trying
to be a DJ.

836
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:36,784
那个秃头混蛋贝斯平在整部电影中一句话都没说
The bald fucker
from Bespin
who never
says nothing
the whole movie.

837
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:38,996
这样沉默鲍勃不就是洛博特吗？
Wouldn't that make
Silent Bob the Lobot?

838
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,541
不 杰伊和沉默鲍勃显然是C-3PO和R2-D2
No. Jay and Silent
Bob are clearly the
C-3PO and R2-D2.

839
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,458
我的意思是 他们从第一部电影开始就一直在
I mean, they've
been here since
the first movie,

840
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:46,420
那是他们以前很酷的时候
which was
the last time
they were cool,

841
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,255
但他们已经合作了这么长时间
but they've been
with the franchise
so long

842
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:51,091
仍然会让他们客串 并把他们印在午餐盒上
they still give
them cameos
and put them
on the lunchboxes.

843
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:54,844
所以如果我不是卢克、汉、小楚、兰多
So if I'm not
Luke, Han,
Chewie, Lando,

844
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,221
机器人或洛博特
the droids
or the Lobot,

845
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,348
那我他妈在你的《星球大战》里是谁
then who the fuck
am I in your
Star Wars,

846
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,350
-他妈的莱娅公主？
-不
Princess
fucking Leia?
No.

847
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:01,602
你是达克
You're the Dak.

848
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,812
达克到底是谁？
Who the fuck is Dak?

849
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:06,899
他是霍斯战役中卢克天行者的尾炮手
He's Luke Skywalker's
tail gunner

850
00:35:05,174 --> 00:35:07,043
in the Battle of Hoth.

851
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:10,068
就是那个准备亲自对付整个帝国
You know,
the guy who's ready

852
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,114
to take on the whole
Empire himself

853
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:12,154
直到帝国把他干掉的家伙？
until the Empire kills
the shit out of him?

854
00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:14,985
(SCOFFS) Did Dak
even get an
action figure?

855
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:15,115
达克有被做成活动玩偶吗？

856
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:17,534
不在经典的肯纳系列中
Not in the classic
Kenner line, no.

857
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:18,785
因为？
Because?

858
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:21,038
因为人们认为他在这个故事中不重要
Because he was
deemed unimportant
to the story.

859
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:24,833
但那只是胡说八道 伙计
没有达克 卢克永远不会
But that's just
bullshit, man.

860
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:25,461
Without Dak,
Luke could
have never...

861
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:28,962
达克是唯一一个
Like, Dak was
the only guy
that's, like, uh...

862
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,300
我的意思是 达克贼勇敢 伙计 就像你一样
I mean, Dak was
plucky as shit, man,
just like you.

863
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,636
我有一个关于剧本的问题
Uh, I have a question
about the script.

864
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,012
太棒了 要有他妈的更多笔记了
Great, more
fuckin' notes.
Go ahead.
ELIAS: Yes.

865
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:38,222
-说吧
-是

866
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:41,308
我对修道士这个角色有意见
Uh, I have a problem
with the Friar
Fuck character,

867
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,018
我相信 应该是我的角色吧
who, I believe,
is supposed to be me.

868
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:46,188
他妈的修道士爱耶稣
Friar Fuck, uh,
loves Jesus,

869
00:35:45,681 --> 00:35:48,781
uh, to what appears to
be an unhealthy degree.

870
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,274
到了看起来不健康的程度

871
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:50,734
然后呢？
And?

872
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:53,612
埃利亚斯是一个重生的撒旦教徒
And Elias is a born
again Satanist.

873
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,656
因为是撒旦拯救了你
Because it was Satan
who saved you

874
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:58,242
当大混蛋耶稣对我的祈祷
when my prayers
fell on the deaf
ears of Jesus,

875
00:35:58,325 --> 00:35:59,535
充耳不闻时
the giant jerkoff.
(SPITTING)

876
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,995
好吧 听着 修道士
All right,
listen up,
Friar Fuck.

877
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,415
我知道你最近刚刚和男朋友耶稣分手了
I get that you
just broke up
with your boyfriend
Jesus recently,

878
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,626
很明显你因此开始改变
and clearly you're
going through
some couture

879
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,294
你的时装和妆容
and cosmetic stuff
because of it.

880
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:12,548
但在你生命的前36年里
But for the
first 36 years
of your life,

881
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:13,542
you were into Jesus
to an unhealthy degree,

882
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:14,258
你对耶稣的喜爱程度已经很不健康了

883
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,885
而这就是以修道士为原型的埃利亚斯
and that's the Elias
that I based
Friar Fuck on.

884
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,012
那么这个剧本是基于谎言的
Then this script
is based on lies.

885
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,597
欢迎来到电影界
Welcome to
the movie biz.

886
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:22,474
这门艺术没有真理！
There's no truth
in this art!

887
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,309
耶稣
Jesus.

888
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,270
每个人都是批评家
Everyone's a critic.

889
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:28,313
那么 我们接下来要做什么？
So, what do
we do next?

890
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:30,148
你问达克干什么？
What are you
asking Dak for?

891
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:33,402
好吧 我一个人做不了 我需要一个制片人
Well, I can't do this alone.
I need a producer.

892
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:34,945
-那是你的工作
-我？
That's your job.
Me?

893
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:36,655
我又不怎么懂制片
What do I know
about producing?

894
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:38,866
我都已经在编剧和导演了
Come on. I'm already
writing and directing.

895
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:40,367
我不能什么都做 伙计
I can't do
everything, man.

896
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,452
好吧 制作人是做什么的？
All right. What does
a producer do?

897
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:45,581
只需为我们制定一个时间表
将我们控制在预算范围内
Just build us a schedule,
keep us under budget,

898
00:36:44,606 --> 00:36:47,173
secure a DP,
and most importantly,

899
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:49,501
找个摄影导演 最重要的是 为我们找到融资

900
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:49,012
find us financing.

901
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:51,587
什么 我还要找人融资？
What, I gotta
get money, too?

902
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:53,964
我们在这里说的是多少？
How much are we
talking about here?

903
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,718
Mmm, 25 grand.

904
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:56,133
2万5千美元

905
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,385
2万5千美元？
$25,000?

906
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,471
严格来说 应该是27575美元
Well, technically,
it's $27,575

907
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:03,724
但如果我们在加拿大的话那就更多了
but it would be way more
if we were in Canada.

908
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:06,685
我他妈的应该从哪里找到那种钱？
Where the fuck
am I supposed to find
that kind of
money from?

909
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,228
我们可以找到那种现金
We can find that
kind of cash.

910
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:09,521
什么？如何？
What? How?

911
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,940
我们下个月推出我们的加密风筝NFT
We launch our
crypto kite
NFTs next month.

912
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:13,025
基督风筝NFT
So the Crimson Crypto Club

913
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,484
所以如果加密风筝能行的话
could have a lot
of money to invest

914
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,028
就会有很多钱可以投资
if the crypto
kites fly.

915
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:17,946
又是那该死的风筝
RANDAL: Again
with the fucking kites.

916
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,782
伙计们 我们需要搞点钱来制作一部真正的电影
Guys, we need real loot
to make a real movie,

917
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:24,661
而不是你们假装黑客帝国的钱
和你们他妈的风筝钱
not your make pretend
Matrix money,

918
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:24,241
you fuckin'
kite fucker.

919
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:27,831
我厌倦了这里扼杀风筝的态度
I'm sick and tired
of the kite killing
attitude around here.

920
00:37:26,885 --> 00:37:27,913
(SCOFFING)

921
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,748
(DOOR OPENS)

922
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:32,669
不管怎么说 回到预算
RANDAL: Anyway,
back to the budget.

923
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:34,880
如果我们把店拿去抵押贷款怎么样？
What if we took
out a loan
against the store?

924
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,883
贷款？为什么我们不先退一步
A loan?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why don't we just

925
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:39,259
先考虑一下这个问题？
slow down a minute
and think about
this first?

926
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:41,386
退一步？我差点就死了 伙计
Slow down?
I almost died, man.

927
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,180
不能再拖了
It doesn't get
any slower than that.

928
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,390
我不想再那样了
I'm not getting all
"Dante" about this.

929
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:47,476
那是什么意思？
Uh, what's that
supposed to mean?

930
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,646
你是那种永远无法决定是拉屎还是下锅的人
You're the guy
who can never decide
whether to shit
or get off the pot.

931
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,898
好吧 我时间不多了
Well, I don't
have time
for that anymore.

932
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:56,693
从现在开始 我要赚大钱
要不然在这里有什么意义？
From now on,
I'm gonna shit bricks

933
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:56,176
or what's the point

1199
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:56,895
色情电影？
RANDAL: It's not
a porno movie.

1200
00:48:56,979 --> 00:48:58,438
这不是色情电影

1201
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:00,607
是我们在你店里拍摄的电影
It's the movie
we're shooting
in your store.

1202
00:49:00,691 --> 00:49:02,734
那部电影？你还没弄完？
(SCOFFS) That movie?
You still ain't done?

1203
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,403
我们甚至还没有开始
We haven't even
started yet.

1204
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:07,656
我不知道 我们会在电影中扮演谁？
I don't know. Who would
we be playing
in this movie?

1205
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:09,950
有两个角色是我按照
Well, it's these
two characters
I kind of based

1206
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:12,077
你和玛吉辛普森为原型创作出来的
on you
and Maggie
Simpson here.

1207
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,620
看看你的第一个场景
Check out your
first scene.

1208
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:16,164
这些人不是真正的演员
DANTE: These guys
aren't real actors.

1209
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:18,834
但他们是真混蛋 这也是我想要的
But they are real
fucked up and I could
work with that.

1210
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:20,836
这听起来一点也不像我
This doesn't sound
like me at all.

1211
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:22,337
你在说什么？
What are you
talking about?

1212
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:26,675
里面所有的对话都是我亲耳听到
你在这里所说过的东西
All the shit in there
is all the stuff

1213
00:49:23,695 --> 00:49:26,098
I've personally heard
you say around here.

1214
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:28,260
我才不会这样说话 伙计
I do not talk
like this, man.

1215
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:30,387
为什么这里的我会说这些蠢话
Why do you have me
saying stupid shit like

1216
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:33,348
-一直说“斯努奇布奇“？
-要不然这样
"Snootchie Bootchies"
all the time?
RANDAL: I'll tell
you what.

1217
00:49:33,557 --> 00:49:35,934
如果你们在电影中扮演自己的话
If you guys
play yourselves
in the movie,

1218
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:38,312
我也会让你们负责伙食区
I'll let you guys
be in charge
of Crafty, too.

1219
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:39,730
那么伙食区是什么呢？
So what's
Crafty about?

1220
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:43,358
除了在电影中扮演喜剧角色
Well, in addition to
being the comic
relief in the movie,

1221
00:49:43,442 --> 00:49:45,694
你们还将负责剧组里所有的伙食
you'd also be in charge
of all the food on set.

1222
00:49:45,253 --> 00:49:47,253
Ooh, we learned
about food prep

1223
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:50,782
以前我们自己开餐厅时
我们学会了食物准备
back when we ran
the fucking Cock Smoker.

1224
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:52,618
那里不就是你们分毒品的地方吗？
Wasn't that place
just a drug front?
(CHUCKLING) No,
we had drugs
in the front

1225
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:56,580
不 我们两边都有

1226
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:56,767
and drugs
in the back.

1227
00:49:57,206 --> 00:50:00,501
所以如果埃利亚斯扮演的是自己
而这些混蛋也扮演他们自己
DANTE: So if Elias
is playing Elias
and these dopes
are playing themselves,

1228
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:02,002
你打算找谁来演维罗妮卡？
who are you gonna get
to play Veronica?

1229
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:05,589
你怎么不早点问呢
Well, funny you
should ask,

1230
00:50:03,107 --> 00:50:05,040
'cause earlier today
I sent the script

1231
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:07,799
我刚刚把剧本发给一个
to someone who
will be absolutely...

1232
00:50:07,146 --> 00:50:09,105
(CLICKS TONGUE)
...perfect to
play Veronica.

1233
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,676
我觉得非常适合演维罗妮卡的人
(DOOR OPENS)

1234
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:14,056
你他妈的以为你是谁？
Who the fuck
do you people
think you are?

1235
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:16,266
-维罗妮卡？
-这是什么脏东西？
Veronica?
What is this filth?

1236
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:19,061
这是什么让我成为一个又放荡
What is this gamey,
tawdry trash

1237
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:21,813
又俗气的垃圾？
that makes me out to be
some slutty sex maniac?

1238
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:24,775
这只是一部我正在制作的关于我的生活的电影
RANDAL: It's just
a movie I'm making

1239
00:50:23,093 --> 00:50:24,390
about my life,
and I thought

1240
00:50:24,858 --> 00:50:26,568
然后我认为你在里面扮演自己会很有趣
it'd be fun for you
to play yourself in it.

1241
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:27,945
是吗？
Oh, you did?

1242
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:29,029
对啊
Yeah.

1243
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:31,448
-那你是他妈的有病了！
-嘿！
Then you are
fucking sick!
Hey!

1244
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:33,951
以我的艺术表达来看它
Watch it with
my artistic expression.

1245
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:36,495
“艺术表达”？这就是我的生活
"Artistic expression"?
That's my life.

1246
00:50:36,578 --> 00:50:37,913
这是我的生活
It's my life.

1247
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:40,123
好了 大家冷静一下
Okay, everybody,
calm down.
Jeez.

1248
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:43,252
你要是在大学里学电影的话肯定会被追杀的
DANTE: Oh, come on,
you would have killed
to have been
in a film in college.

1249
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:46,672
-你主修戏剧
-我辅修戏剧
You majored
in drama.
I minored
in drama.

1250
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:48,841
我主修口腔外科
I majored in
oral surgery.

1251
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:50,717
所有人都欢呼口腔女王
All hail the queen
of oral.

1252
00:50:50,801 --> 00:50:52,427
-去你的
-外科女王
Fuck you.
Surgery.

1253
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:53,637
你没有让我说完
You didn't
let me finish.

1254
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,848
我也不会让你拍完这部电影的
And I'm not gonna let you
finish this film either,

1255
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:57,766
除非你把我的角色去掉
not with me
as a character.

1256
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:02,437
我不是你在你肮脏的无脑电影中讲的他妈的笑话
I'm not some
fucking joke
you get to tell

1257
00:51:00,196 --> 00:51:01,932

1259
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:08,402

I see myself
more like retail's

1260
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:09,570
你想这样做吗？
VERONICA: You want
to do this?

1261
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,447
也行 把我的角色拿掉
Fine, but leave
me out of it.

1262
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:14,867
不像你们两个 我有一份稳定的工作
Unlike either of you,
I've got a grown-up job.

1263
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,494
不像你们两个 我有一个家庭
And unlike either of you,

(SOBBING)

1272
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:47,733
我遇到了两件不幸的事
I had two
cancelations.

1273
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:52,529
我的前任打电话告诉我
他不会把我们女儿的车
My ex calls
to tell me that

1274
00:51:50,015 --> 00:51:52,044
he's not putting
our daughter's car

1275
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:53,864
列入他的保险
on his insurance,

1276
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:57,117
所以现在不知怎的她在生我的气
and so now somehow
she's pissed at me.

1277
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:03,207
然后我看到你说那些屁话
And then I see you
and say that shit.

1278
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:06,502
没关系 真的
It's okay. Really.

1279
00:52:06,877 --> 00:52:09,505

If Randal told me he was
gonna send you the script,

1282
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:16,470
我肯定会说不行的
I would've said no way.

1283
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:19,223
但现在 我很高兴他那么做了

00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:07,664
很自然 很微妙 我喜欢
Very natural,
and subtle.
I like it.

1330
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:12,294
那么 你今天感觉如何？
So, how are you
feeling today?

1331
00:54:12,377 --> 00:54:16,006
你知道吗 我感觉就像
那个在影像店打工的孩子
Oh, you know,
I feel like that kid

1332
00:54:13,785 --> 00:54:15,422
that worked
in the video store,

1333
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:18,133
对电影的语言完全熟悉
fully fluent in
the language of cinema.

1334
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:19,718
就像我天生就是导演一样
It's like I was born
to direct.

1335
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:22,221
不 兄弟 我的意思是 你上个月心脏病发作了
No, bro. I mean,
you had a heart
attack last month.

1336
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:23,931
那 不 我感觉很好
Oh, that.
No, I feel fine.

1337
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:25,224
昨晚在车上过了一夜之后
How do you
feel today

1338
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:27,476
今天感觉如何？
after your Range Rover
sleepover last night?

1339
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:30,145
-别说
-当我说要当制片人的时候
Stop it.
When I said
to be a producer,

1340
00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:32,564
我不是说老来得子那一说
I didn't mean produce
a late-in-life child.

1341
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:34,233
不情愿的制作人
Unwilling producer.

1342
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:37,152
我也没有申请做这份工作 但我还是做了
I didn't ask
for this job,
but I am doing it.

1343
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:39,154
所以我今天有一个关于资金的会议
So I have a meeting
today about money.

1344
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:41,740
他妈的行啊
Fucking A,
that's producing, J.J.

1345
00:54:41,823 --> 00:54:43,700
我还给你找了个电影摄影师
And I found you
a cinematographer.

1346
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:45,577
-什么？
-我可以为你介绍吗
What?
May I present to you...

1347
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:48,497
摄影师鲍勃
Shooter Bob.

1348
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:51,875
沉默的鲍勃会成为我们的摄影师吗？
Silent Bob is
gonna be our DP?

1349
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:55,212
妈的 太棒了 我们都要做DP！
Shit, yeah,
we all gonna be
doing DPs!

1350
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:56,755
DP是名称
Uh, DP is the name
of the job.

1351
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:58,340
你说是摄影师
You said
it was cinematographer.

1352
00:54:58,423 --> 00:55:00,801
摄影师就是DP
The cinematographer
is the DP.

1353
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:04,012
伙计 不要表现得像你知道所有行业的俚语一样
Man, don't be
acting like
you know

1354
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:03,438
all the industry
slang and shit.

1355
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:05,931
我和沉默的鲍勃是这里唯一
Me and Silent Bob
are the only ones here

1356
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:08,851
去过电影拍摄片场的人 两次
who've actually been
on a movie set. Twice.

1357
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:09,644
(RANDAL SCOFFS)

1358
00:55:10,686 --> 00:55:11,979
来吧
RANDAL: Come on.

1359
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:14,189
是的 他是一个非常规的选择
Yes, he's an
unconventional choice,

1360
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:16,567
但你是一个非常规的电影制作人
but you are an
unconventional
filmmaker making

1361
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,610
-要拍一部非常规的电影
-是的
an unconventional film.
Yeah.

1362
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:20,779
你要我把我一生的故事
You want me to entrust
the story of my life
to the Quiet Place.

1363
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:21,905
托付到寂静之地

1364
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:24,783
他的Instagram上有一些非常漂亮的照片
He has some
really nice shots

1365
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:24,391
on his Instagram.
(SCOFFS)

1366
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:26,076
来吧 给他一个机会 伙计
Come on, give him
a chance, man.

1367
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,579
也许他会和你说同样的电影语言
Maybe he speaks
the language of
cinema like you do.

1368
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:30,289
这家伙从不说
The guy never
speaks at all.

1369
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:35,544
好的 我们刚看过这里侦察 颜色真难看
Okay, so we just
scouted in here,

1370
00:55:33,172 --> 00:55:34,799
and the colors
are fucking ugly.

1371
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:37,880
所以沉默鲍勃想把整部电影
So Silent Bob wants to
shoot the whole movie

1372
00:55:37,963 --> 00:55:39,298
拍成黑白的
in black and white.

1373
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:41,008
《辛德勒的名单》是黑白电影吗？
Schindler's List
black and white?
What, is he nuts?

1374
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:42,217
什么 他疯了吗？

1375
00:55:43,135 --> 00:55:44,845
不 我是他妈的电影制片人
Uh, no,
I'm a fucking
filmmaker.

1376
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:47,973
任何称职的电影制作人都会知道
And any filmmaker
worth their salt

1377
00:55:46,448 --> 00:55:47,712
would know
that the colors

1378
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:49,516
这个地方的颜色真他妈的可怕
in this place
are fucking ghastly.

1379
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,518
处理它们的唯一方法就是
The only way
you could
deal with them

1380
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:53,520
通过黑白来进行中和
is to neutralize
them by going in
black and white,

1381
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:55,647
这也可以作为
which will also
kind of act as
a commentary

1382
00:55:55,731 --> 00:55:58,150
对商业无灵魂本质的评论
on the soulless
nature of commerce

1383
00:55:58,233 --> 00:56:01,195
同时在潜意识里让观众觉得
while subliminally
giving the audience
the impression

1384
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:03,363
他们正在通过假想商店的
that they're watching
our heroes

1385
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:07,534
安全摄像头观看我们的主角的生活
from the perspective
of an imaginary
store security cam.

1386
00:56:08,577 --> 00:56:09,912
我就是这么想的
That's what
I was thinking.
Mmm-hmm.

1387
00:56:09,995 --> 00:56:11,496
-这就是艺术家的想法
-是的
That's what
an artist thinks.
Yup.

1388
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,915
但是 你知道 这取决于你
But, you know,
it's up to you.

1389
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:15,542
不过 如果不让我拍黑白的话
However,
I'm shooting it
in black and white,

1390
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:18,045
我他妈的就不拍了
or I ain't shooting
it at all,
motherfucker.

1391
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:19,421
没错
That's right.

1392
00:56:23,122 --> 00:56:25,115
(EXHALES)
(LINE RINGING)

1393

天哪 他看起来很胖
Jesus, he looks fat.

1394
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:32,976
你没有静音 艾玛
You're not
on mute, Emma.

1395
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:35,896
我知道 所以呢？你好
I know. So? Hello.

1396
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:38,273
你好
Hi, you.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

1397
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:39,525
佛罗里达怎么样？
How's Florida?

1398
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,693
到处都是混蛋 但至少不是泽西岛
Full of assholes,
but at least
it's not Jersey.

1399
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:43,111
你想要什么 但丁？
What do you
want, Dante?

1400
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,698
好吧 这会从左场出来
Okay, uh, this is gonna
come out of left field,

1401
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:51,787
但是 我希望我能借点钱
but, um, I was hoping
I could borrow some money.

1402
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:55,165
-他妈的不行
-这不给我的 是给兰德尔的
Fuck no.
It's not for me.
It's for Randal.

1403
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:58,001
哦 那更他妈的不行
Oh, then double fuck no.

1404
00:56:58,085 --> 00:56:59,670
他心脏病发了 艾玛
He had a heart
attack, Emma.

1405
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:01,380
好的 我希望他死了
Good. I hope
he dropped dead.

1406
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,507
他没有
He didn't.

1407
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,551
所以他需要钱
So he needs
the money for, uh...

1408
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:06,927
来付医院的账单
for the hospital bills.

1409
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:08,512
兰德尔没有任何保险
Randal doesn't have
any insurance.

1410
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:09,805
所以他妈的什么？
So the fuck what?

1411
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,641
即使我想帮忙 但是我真不想
Even if I wanted to help,
which I don't,

1412
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:15,269
我不会给兰德尔任何免费的钱
I'm not giving
Randal Graves
any free money.

1413
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:16,520
艾玛 拜托
Emma, please.

1414
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:19,231
你和我曾经承诺 如果我们需要帮助
You and I once
promised that if
we ever needed help,

1415
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:21,567
无论发生什么 我们都会一直帮助对方的
we'd always be there
for each other,
no matter what.

1416
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:26,738
那是在你欺骗我之前
That was before
you cheated on me

1417
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:26,279
at a fucking
donkey show.

1418
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:28,073
再见了 但丁！
Goodbye, Dante!

1419
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:29,366
不 等等
No, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
(GROANS)

1420
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:32,744
拜托了 艾玛
Please, Emma.

1421
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:35,706
我真的很绝望
I'm desperate here.

1422
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:38,292
你有抵押品吗？
Do you even have
any collateral?

1423
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:39,543
如果必须这样的话
If I have to...

1424
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:43,797
我可以签署我一半的店作为抵押品
I can sign over my
half of the QuickStop
as collateral.

1425
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:45,299

That shithole? Ugh.

1426
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:55,559
-这是怎么回事？
-我们在拍电影
What's all this about?
We're making a movie.

1427
00:57:55,642 --> 00:57:58,395
不是吧 色情电影？
No shit.
A pornography movie?

1428
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,148
-这需要多长时间？
-21晚
How long does
that take?
Twenty-one nights.

suck his own dick.

1431
00:58:06,153 --> 00:58:07,279
连续？
In a row?

"In Convenience."
I don't get it.

你他妈怎么了 伙计？
What the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

-我自己？

Myself?
Okay.

01:11:56,608 --> 01:11:57,901
我们需要拍摄这个场景

showed up here

然后被引诱 被拉去卖东西
then seduced and abandoned
to sell, uh, goods.

2266
01:38:37,793 --> 01:38:41,213
所以在《疯狂店员》里 兰德尔说
“伙计 这份工作会很棒”
So in  Clerks, Randal says,

2267
01:38:39,723 --> 01:38:41,119
"Man, this job would be great

2268
01:38:41,296 --> 01:38:43,549
“如果不是因为那些该死的顾客”
"if it wasn't for
the fuckin' customers."

2269
01:38:43,632 --> 01:38:45,467
但在《疯狂店员3》的剧本中
Uh, but in the script
for  Clerks III,

2270
01:38:46,176 --> 01:38:47,970
我要给你读一些
I'm gonna read you a little
something that was there

2271
01:38:48,053 --> 01:38:49,263
我没有用在电影中的东西
that I didn't use
in the movie.

2272
01:38:49,346 --> 01:38:52,140
在最后的回调镜头中 你能听到
During the pullback shot

2273
01:38:50,494 --> 01:38:52,227
at the very end,

2274
01:38:52,224 --> 01:38:54,476
约翰戈尔卡的歌 《我来自新泽西》

真的太棒了
And it was so lovely,

2276
01:38:56,270 --> 01:38:58,689
我没有采用那一段 也没按照剧本要求
I left that moment alone
and didn't put in

2277
01:38:58,772 --> 01:39:01,191
加入司默德的声音
what in the script called
for, the voice of Smod.

2278
01:39:01,275 --> 01:39:03,694

2298
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:50,490
